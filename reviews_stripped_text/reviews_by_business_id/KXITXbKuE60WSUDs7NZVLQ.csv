I expect most high-end restaurants to be able to put together something vegan, especially if you ask without regard to price. But after being seated here with a fairly large party, I asked what my options were for something vegan. I don't expect miracles, but in Carnevino, the waiter came back and said the chef would take care of me. I ended up with salad and some vegetables, but filling enough and very good. And I had something with every course.

At Table 10, I got a response that I'm used to from chains like Applebees. The waiter came back and said that they didn't really offer anything vegan, and only suggested a salad, though didn't offer specific recommendations on which had dressing without egg or dairy. Ultimately I ordered fries, spinach, and charred peas. It ended up being filling enough, but unsatisfying overall. The $9 serving of spinach was ordinary, though the charred peas were good.",SdKbaLOpxCn9zJPszXQltg,0,0,2,kWXS0JnrL9qXmjii9gUphw

I was part of a party of 5 and none of us were too happy with our entrees.

18949,2011-05-23,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Visiting Las Vegas from the Gulf Coast for a convention, my companion and I bee-lined to the first sit down restaurant we could find.  It just happened to be Table 10.  I was slightly disappointed when we were seated and I realized that this was one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants though - not because I have anything against him or his food, but because I didn't come from the Gulf Coast to Vegas to eat more Gulf Coast fare.  But at least Emeril always puts a unique spin on his dishes.

My friend and I walked in without looking at the menu or the prices, and I for one was a bit put off by how much the food costs - at least $30 per entr√©e.  I think my friend was too, because we ended up just getting a bunch of appetizers (a more reasonable $8-15 per plate) and sharing tapas style.  

We got the mussels, calamari, bacon, and their special snack of the day, potato chips.  The chips were just kettle chips with Parmesan on them.  The calamari was underwhelming.  The mussels were delicious.  But the hands down best (and surprisingly cheapest) dish was the bacon.  

The bacon was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  It came with a brown sugar dipping sauce.  Perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy, chewy in all the right ways... and for the price you get surprisingly a lot of it.  

It should come as no surprise that one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants ranks high for fine dining.  Just be aware that you're paying for the brand name just as much as the quality of the food.  While the price may be arguably worth it, when you're in Vegas, there are many more ways to blow your money than on food.",bAzdeuQiR80wVOLUh7ox7g,0,0,4,O02FcDs2urnuiifh0l7HMQ

Emeril's Shrimp Toast. Similarly delish.
Salt & Pepper Striped Bass with skin on.  Full of flavour and done to perfection.  Satisfying .
White Chocolate Malassadas Rolled in Cinamon sugar with Vanilla Bean Anglaise.  Have to give the full description.   So many celeb chefs and not so celeb do the 'gourmet' mini doughnut thing.

173777,2010-01-29,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"This is the second Emeril resturant I tried and once again very disppointed. The food wasn't all that great and the prices were very high. I came here with my family of 14 on Sunday to celebrate my niece's birthday. The place wasn't crowded at all but they had to wait until everyone showed up before seating us. 
When I looked at the menu, nothing really stood out to me that I really wanted. Since I had a very late lunch I wasn't all that hungry anyways. I ordered the roasted butternut squash. I tried to request to omit the better, but the waiter told me that it was pre roasted, which means by the time I ate it, it was either microwaved or reheated. However, it was good, but something I could have made at home and save $10.
My husband ordered calamari and it was something he could have got at the Cheesecake Factory for 1/2 the price. The rest of the family order some other dishes (too much to list). My sister didn't enjoy the food at all. Asteria in Burglingame,CA was better. 
So we left very disappointed. In fact, one of my sister and nephew had to order room service a couple of hours later due to hunger.
I will try my best not to go to another Emeril;'s resturant again. Both time I spent a lot of money and left very disappointed.

PROS:
-clean place

CONS:
-service was slow considering the resturant wasn't busy. We kept on having to ask for more water. Our food nearly took an hour to arrive. We almost got up and left.
-food didn't worth the price
-DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT order the truffle mac n cheese. It was disgusting. It tasted like throw-up.

Nice and polite service, however not too personable.  The interior and ambiance is nice but not extraordinary.  I've heard not to order any of their house salad, so I started with a Tomato Bisque, which was wonderful.  The whole showing of synchronizing the serving of dishes, and pouring the soup from the pot to your plate in front out you, appears to be a bit sloppy.  I prefer having the soup serve to me hot and simple.  Thank you. 

The lamb and foie gras appetizer cost $22, and was only alright.  Foie Gras was burnt on purpose which was weird.  Then I was surprised by the Mediterranean Sea Bass marinated with tomato, etc.  It was very very fishy... and it's at $37.  Obviously mediterranean sea bass is very different from the Chilean sea bass.  

One of the person in our party had requested a Vegetarian dish, and even though it wasn't on the menu, they had been graceful and helpful about our special request.

Given with the vast amount of other great choices in Las Vegas, I probably will not go back.  This restaurant is mediocre and doesn't worth a special trip to visit.",SmM_6LVEHXSz5qDk2rsPUg,1,0,3,L3KsTHOaQGW0D38mjQWKkA

We decided to take the family out for brunch to change it up a bit from the usual buffets out there.  The location is great.. being at the end of The Pallazio, you get to wander and enjoy the sights of the Venetian and The Pallazio.  The restaurant is beautifully done with ample seating for all group sizes.  They have tables outside also for those that want to see as well as be seen.

For service, it was well staffed.  We were seated promptly, even with no reservation maybe partly because there were plenty of empty tables?.. Our waiter was very attentive and his assistant was always there to refill our glasses and pick up our dishes.  Love the open kitchen where you can see the dishes being prepared.  

The food was great. Kids had the Croque Madame and Angus Beef Burger and the plates came in full. My lady had the Shrimp Po' Boy and that too looked great and filling.  Also enjoyed their Truffle Mac N Cheese.. Good flavor but a bit on the runny side.. still good. Only gripe was my lobster rolls. They came in looking like sliders.. 3 of them, almost in the same bread as they give in the beginning with about a tablespoon of lobster in each, so it gives the impression that you were shorted on the lobster. It was still good, just wish it had more lobster in it (Boy, do I miss their shrimp toast! That was Yum-ME!!).

Overall, the experience there has always been good.  The food is a good amount and it doesn't set you back far in the wallet.  It's a good change from the regular cafes and buffets and hey, it's from Emeril.. BAM!",6eYHnRWS75M0i5WGQ5s0Hw,0,0,4,6vJC4r1ZkZib9REuGH5qYg

The food on the other hand was not so good.   We started with the Boston salad,  the dressing was very bland, as was the salad overall.  Perhaps beefing up the dressing flavor and adding some Gorgonzola crumbles would help. 

My fianc√© ordered a Ribeye which turned out to be 80% inedible because there was so much fat.  He also had potato fritters, which again, were definitely lacking in flavor on the inside. 

My filet mignon was ok, but definitely not the best I've ever had, especially at that price point.  Honestly, my fiance grills filets from Costco on our gas grill at home that taste way better and have a much more palatable texture than what I paid nearly $50 for. 

Lastly, the Sangiovese should be taken off the ""by the glass"" wine list and replaced with something else,  it tastes and smells dirty. 

We did mention something to the Manager about the amount of fat in the Ribeye when he was doing his rounds to check on us.  He felt very badly and ended up comping one of our $16 glasses of wine, which we were fine with.

I'm sure they have great food, we just failed to order any of it.  Oh and the Cabernet on the ""by the glass"" menu was pretty good,  I'd say maybe a 7 out of 10, but stay away from that Sangio, yuk :)",ITZa_tDvd24TnfWKOcaDYQ,0,0,3,FxHW4w5z3a4cT6AYJJmMEw

Apps to try: Candied North Country Farm Bacon is tasty, hot, and has a kick. Too much of a kick, actually. I'm a wimp with spicy foods so it was too much for me. The Lobster Mac-n-cheese was fantastic. It was really difficult to share. Lots of cheddar, lots of lobster, and lots of flavor! Also, the bread they bring out when you arrive is GREAT!

Entrees to try: We only had apps/sides. 

Desserts to try: White Chocolate Malassadas. So.Good. I love malassadas normally, so these were an exciting treat. 

Service: Fantastic. The servers were quick to respond and very friendly.

Establishment: Nice place...very cool. The ambiance was great and so were the furnishings, place settings, etc.

Restroom: Nice! Clean!

Parking: Not sure...we were in Vegas and not driving from location to location.

My boyfriend and I arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation and I was glad to be seated despite our premature arrival.  We were seated near the back of the restaurant with a view of what I assume is the chef's table and the kitchen.  I was pretty stoked, since I consider that a pretty cool view.  
I think our waitresses name was Elizabeth.  We got our menus and I was very excited about the Parmesan cheese crusted pan seared scallops on portabello mushrooms with risotto and micro basil and a port wine butter.  WHAT? yes.  Probably one of the most delicious things I've eaten ever.  Seriously.  
The appetizer helped me decide that I should get the salmon for dinner, it had artichoke hearts, spinach, tomatoes, and wild mushrooms.  I asked Elizabeth if I should get the Riesling or Pinot grigio , and she suggested the latter because the fish was not spicy.  Boy, was she under exaggerating.  The cast iron pan seared salmon was completely unseasoned. And, to my utter dismay, our pepper grinder was not working.  It took until they reset the table next to us to get a functional one, and by that time I was nearly done with my bland and over-cooked salmon (I ordered it medium and it was very well done) anyway, and I was pretty over it.  However the wine did go very well and the two helped enhance each other.  It was a good recommendation.

The boston lettuce salad with chive buttermilk dressing was good -- although, ironically (for all the bitching Emeril does on Top Chef about lack of seasoning) there was virtually no seasoning in the dressing or on the salad.  After adding salt and pepper, it was a lovely salad with heirloom radishes and bacon ... although there could have been more of both.

My husband very much enjoyed his margarita pizza.  Great crust and flavorful and fresh tomato sauce with quality cheese.

The chicken and andouille sausage gumbo was the best I've had (I have not been to NOLA).  The rice was perfectly cooked and a perfect amount of it.  The ""gravy"" was dark brown, spicy, and had a perfect medium body texture to it.  Yum ... I'd eat that every day!

I'd say to skip the banana cream pie -- too many thick sliced bananas, cream was too thick, and whipped cream on top was flavorless.  Can't hold a candle to Tom Douglas's coconut cream pie ... now, THAT is a cream pie!",XqZVOEbTtuEeAwFWvcU-Qg,0,0,3,exkIiZolVA7tmTD02TomZg

574238,2011-04-04,2,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Our good friend's brother recently took over as Chef de Cuisine at Table Ten, so while we were in Vegas for a quick weekend of hiking (yep, you heard me right - we're not so much into the casino thing) we thought it might be fun to stop by this restaurant to introduce ourselves to him.

He (Sean) was previously Chef de Cuisine at Delmonico, another Vegas standout. So, I fully understand that my review may be a bit biased, since we received excellent service and a few creations directly from Sean - he's trying some new things out on the menu, which is a clear indicator to me that Table Ten is supportive of good-intentioned progress. A great sign for any restaurant, indeed. Sean spoke with us and explained his commitment to local, organic food sources - and how he's incorporating some of these items into the new menu.

We started out with an incredible array of appetizers - the knockout being a gumbo-style dish. The flavors were completely punch-you-in-the-face delicious and the shrimp was prepared perfectly. 

We also tried the pork dumplings (my husband's fave, he's never met a potsticker he didn't like), which were wonderful.

Organic Kentor Farm Spinach Salad - AMAZING. Perfect combination of flavors, Sean! I could've had this as a meal.

I know we had a couple other things, too - all of which were delectable. But of course, Sean treated us to my favorite dessert of all time (how did he know?!) - Bananas Foster.

AY CHEE WAH-WAH!

It was truly one of the best desserts I've ever had. The combination of warm bananas, ice-cold vanilla ice cream, and caramelized sauce is out-of-control luscious. It was elegant in its simplicity. YUM. 

I'd highly recommend this place - Sean is doing some great things here, and it will be great to see the changes he implements take hold. I'm sure there's a bit of an adjustment period taking place at Table Ten, but if our meal was any indication, everything is headed in a great direction.

I also have to mention that my friend is the farthest thing from a foodie.  He could care less about what hes having and rarely comments on the quality.  

One of the highlights was the bread served prior to the meal.  Apparently it is bread from the Parker Brothers Bakery in Boston?  I have never heard of them but again for such a simple ingredient it added a great element to the meal and experience.

590710,2011-02-07,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Our party of 10 dined at Table 10 at the Palazzo Hotel this past Saturday night.

First of all, the food was excellent.  Everyone at the table ordered something different, and we all got to sample each other's dishes.  Fish entrees were cooked perfectly, not dry at all, even including the lean halibut.  I ordered the rotisserie-grilled duck and not only was it delicious, the portion was surprisingly big (thigh and leg).  Highly recommended.

Why this restaurant ended up with 2 stars from me, however, was because of the service and other little things.  Let's start with the terrible service.  It started off fine, but unfortunately, after the waitress took our order and brought us our drinks, she disappeared for a solid 20 minutes.  She did come by after that to bring steak knives and take away salad forks and spoons as she ""prepared us for the food.""

However another 10 minutes passed, and now everyone's wondering where our food was.  One of our diners asked the waitress politely if our food was coming out soon, she told him rudely ""it's only been 30 minutes.""  Sorry for wondering where our food was.  The restaurant was almost empty.  I think we saw maybe 2 other tables that were seated and waiting for food.

Our food didn't come out for another 10 minutes.  This timeline is by my best estimation.  Let's put it this way.  We were seated at 8pm, and we didn't receive our food until 9:15pm.  

Like I said, the food was delicious, though certainly not worth the wait.

Our drinks went un-refilled.  We had to flag our waitress down to ask for refills.  She also did not bother to come back and check on us.  Our waitress's attitude stunk, to say the least, and ruined the dining experience.  What did we do wrong other than to ask where our food was after 30 minutes by her own admission.  There were no apologies, no ""thank you for waiting"", nothing.

Another criticism is the bread.  We were handed out dinner rolls that looked out of place at a higher-end restaurant.  Dinner rolls?  Really?  And they didn't look/taste like they were freshly baked.  They looked like supermarket-bought rolls.  Very disappointing.

It's a shame that such a great restaurant is ruined by poor service.",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,0,0,2,vkZuWzBtqWgG5lKH_6j0lQ

For drinks I ordered a well-made sazerac cocktail (this wasn't on the cocktail menu but is a New Orleans classic), and she had a glass of sauvignon blanc (don't remember the brand, but she said it was good).

We split the hush puppies for an appetizer. The tomato currant chutney they come with was tasty, though I didn't think it worked particularly well with the hush puppies (she thought it did), which were delicious on their own.

For entrees, she had the pasta jambalaya and I had the pork tenderloin. The pork tenderloin was very tender and paired nicely with the sweet potatoes. The mole and glaze were welcome accompaniments. She liked the jambalaya very much. I had a few bites and agreed.

We typically don't order dessert unless there's something unique, and the wait staff strongly recommended the white chocolate malassadas. These are essentially mini beignets or donut holes filled with white chocolate that you can dip in a fantastic vanilla bean cr√®me anglaise. You must order these. So, we unintentionally began and ended the meal with fried balls of dough.

Overall, the meal was a pretty good value--not cheap of course, but we were prepared for that. The atmosphere is classy but casual enough that it's not stuffy. In other words, all the good of fine dining and none of the bad.",WB17JEB44r17muk5-yMedg,0,0,5,orTPbFNVU-FI-x5DGP4wfQ

Appetizers were strong!  My daughter ordered the Candied North Country Bacon which were addicting.  My husband had the tried and true Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo and I started with a very refreshing, well-balanced Beet Salad.  We also really enjoyed the Sriracha Wings, nicely spiced and well prepared.

Then....the entrees came....with disappointment!!!
My daughter ordered the Smokey Mushroom Pasta from the hot appetizer menu because that is more than a small child will eat. She only ate a little bit of ham bits which came on the dish. She told me that the pasta was plain, tasteless and oily. The pasta was overcooked and someone must have forgotten to season the water!  We also got the pork chop which had a mole sauce that went all over the caramelized sweet potato. The sweet potato would have tasted better if it had been served in a separate dish on the side.  The mole sauce though delicious with the pork chop, is not good with the sweet potato!  The roasted chicken should be removed from the menu because that was really gross and dry! The sauce & the mushroom tasted a bit stale and strange...

792483,2014-12-31,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"This was a rare find in Vegas.  A 5 star restaurant that was also quiet, elegant and reasonably priced.  

My wife and I visit vegas quite often (5-10 times per year) mainly to enjoy the shows, restaurants and shopping. While there are many fine restaurants by some of the world's top chefs - few also offer this rare combination of a quiet dining experience (in Vegas!) plus world-class food, reasonably priced, AND with reasonable portions.  

On a Saturday night, my wife and I went to look for a nice restaurant for a quiet dinner.  We saw a few small signs for Table-10, and found it in a rather discrete location  (away from the concentration of restaurants and shops, pleasantly perched on the second floor)).   When we got there, we were pleasantly surprised by several things:

1. there was no wait!  (for such a restaurant on a saturday night - this was astounding).
2. the restaurant was not crowded, and it was quiet enough for us to enjoy and have a conversation.
3. they had a $45 dinner special - 4 courses - with a variety of choices that were memorable and delicious.

One notable part of the meal experience ...  the portions.  One of my main complaints about Vegas restaurants (and about everything in vegas) is stressing Quantity over Quality.  Most restaurants cater to the tourist who wants value (quantity) for their money, and thus they pile on the portions to the point where you really cannot appreciate the meal.  Table-10 ... the portions were just perfect:  Satisfying but just enough to truly appreciate the cooking and to look forward to the next course.

Last - I will echo some of the other recommendations here - the Banana Cream ""cake"" - was amazing  (while I expected the entrees from an Emeril restaurant to be 5-star, the deserts were also memorable)-   

Highly recommended!   But keep it a secret so we can get another quiet table next time!",rxkMt0Jz-GguUtco7aAadg,0,0,5,fEVkgjuVUq7MSicn6ycZxg

I picked the following:  Boston Lettuce with Bacon, Squash Gnudi (Dumplings) in Sage Butter, Crisp Roasted Chicken Breast with Leaks and gnocchi and Mini Dutch Apple Pie -  Everything was delicious and very well proportioned.  Other things we ordered were:
Whole Roasted Sea Bream -  Whole means whole Head and tail included - Good
Chicken Andouille Sausage Gumbo -  Not great, lacking some depth -no real kick
Beet Salad - Excellent 
Crisp Red Potatoes -  Good 
3 Scoop Sorbets - Gluten-Free   Excellent 
Mini Dutch Apple Pie -  Excellent and good portion
Prices are as expected  - between 26 and 40 for most entree's but not terrible for the Strip.

Prices were quite reasonable for both drinks and food, service was prompt although it wasn't terribly busy for a Saturday night.

We got the grissini - skinny breadsticks wrapped in prosciutto and dusted with truffle oil, a perfect snack (which is what it is on the menu) but don't expect anything more than an appetite teaser from this one under normal circumstances. We also tried the braised beef cheeks and wild mushrooms. The sauce, tender beef, and mushrooms were amazing. I highly recommend both of these dishes.

Our friends got the filet and chicken for entrees. Both enjoyed their food. 

Give this place a try, at least for some small bites - I really enjoyed it.",Woz6aKAwoSqsCv0JLc8vsw,0,0,4,NRZ3wz0V_xuiDicUc9Trmg

I see a lot of reviews on lunch and happy hour. This review is strictly regarding dinner. 

Made reservations for 8 and arrived at 7:45, no problem, immediately seated. The bar area was about 40% filled and the dining area was 60% filled. We were immediately met by our server who took our water order and left us to decide on our cocktail order (easy for me-Sapphire martini, up extra dry with a twist!). The only hitch in the drink orders were mine arrived with olives (eww) and my girlfriend's pinot grigo took about 10 minutes to arrive. 

We were given the ""chef's compliments"" small appetizer and munched on the wonderful bread and butter that was brought out. I could have just had the bread and been happy!

My girlfriend ordered the Creole Spiced & Seared Hawaiian Mahi Mahi
Clams, Baja Shrimp, Chorizo Sausage & Lobster tossed in Piri Piri with Toasted Garlic Bread. In a word-amazing. The layer after layer of different flavors was incredible. Just as incredible was my Slow Roasted Prime Seaboard Farms Pork Tenderloin Fired Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Spiced Pecans and a Tart Cherry Reduction.

We ordered the grilled asparagus and the bacon & blue cheese Yukon potatoes. OMG...enough said there. 

And understand, these are LARGE portions. My girlfriend couldn't finish hers and I left a little on my plate also. We didn't have an appetizer because the desserts looked so good, but we simply didn't have room for any more.  

The prices: Her wine was $14 for a glass. My martinis (I had two) were $15.50 each. The meals were $33 and $34 respectively. So for around $130 we had great drinks, amazing food, outstanding service in a welcoming setting. What more could you ask for, right?",YFHMPcMCIiTYKC8ibuNnLw,0,0,5,KohMncm8Gx1gCK9OVo69fg

started with a foo-foo drink $14 ,,,some sort of fruit punch mix - nice juice taste..but didn't get much of an alcohol taste. the specialty drinks ...i believe they were all $14

they give you parkerhouse rolls ...nice saltiness on the top - decent - nothing special - but good

they had an apps section ( most around $12-18 ) a salad section...i didn't look at it ...wasn't in the salad mood - i went with a miso cod app with a slaw noodle topping ( not sure why i went with that ) the server told me it would be a 4-6 ounces...that surprised me - my guess - at most 4 ounces and probably closer to 3 ounces ...  - it had a nice flavor..but while i ate it ...kept saying to myself ,  i'm not at tao or social house...dummy !!  even stranger - had a fat tire ale ( $7.50 )  with the cod ... oh well...

the mains - separate meat section ( deconstructed...asked the server ...huh ?  he said ...all it means is ala-carte...oh ok ...whatever ! )  filet, sirloin,,i believe there was a rib-eye too....the last item - short ribs ...server said it takes 3 days to make...again...not sure why...but i went with it ( $28 ) .  the special for the day was monkfish, there were also other entrees like rotisserie chicken, jambalaya, a pasta dish - there were 4 or 5 others...can't remember them.  they had sides - asparagus, mushrooms, mashed, all $7 the only expepensive side ...lobster mac and cheese....not lobster mashed potatoes....LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE...$15...i didn't get it....CHICKEN !!!

The short ribs - a large chunk of meat - about 6 ounces ..nice sauce....but a little unusual - like the meat was cooked in a different sauce....i didn't care for it overall.  the mushrooms in a pinot sauce...white shrooms...i think...didn't impress me.

for dessert - the chef recommended the white chocolate malasaca's ( sp ) - almost went with it but then i saw the strawberry bread pudding with almond ice cream ...i should've listened to the chef ...the bread pudding was ok...just boring.... cost $9 - i believe most of the other desserts were similarly priced.

total bill $96 ( also had a glass of pinot with the main entree )

overall - ok - will i go back....probably not.",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,1,0,3,0upMgmT9NJ_IbIg2P16KEw

So I was especially excited to try out his new venture at the Palazzo hotel. I was staying at the Wynn, so this was conveniently located ""next door"" and just a quick 10 min walk. 

To begin they have these fabulous warm fluffy and surprisingly slightly salty dinner rolls. Yes, salty. I loved this combination. The roll is served warm and buttery and has a light sprinkling of sea salt on top of the roll. Partnered with a small spread of butter it was a great way to begin the dining experience :)

My friend and I started our meal with one of the daily specials, suggested by our server, Crab Cakes. Now I'll admit that these were pretty small. It's a serving of three cakes about 2-3 bites each. However, they were light on filler and and filled with crab. Though given their size I would've been incredibly disappointed had they been mostly bread crumbs. 

For dinner I had the Grilled Salmon. It was SOOOO good! Served atop a homemade chorizo and tortilla hash, with corn and a tomatillo relish. The Salmon had a great outer crust and was flaky and moist on the inside. The tortilla hash threw me a bit but was a great accompaniment to the fish. The tortillas were just tender (not crispy chips) and the chorizo was fairly lean and slightly spicy.  This ""hash"" would've been a great dish by itself! To share, my friend and I split the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese. WOW O WOW!!!! This truly is a meal in itself and at $17 it could be! This was not your everyday mac 'n' cheese. It was cheesy, creamy, warm, filled with large lobster meat bits and topped with a crusty baked crumb top. HEAVEN! It was soooo good! It  warmed your insides (even though it was 100 degrees outside!) and is simply comforting comfort food :)

The service was prompt, friendly and courteous. Our server was warm and funny and a good sport.

The main dish was a grilled filet mignon with lobster mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus. For dessert, we had an apple cobbler with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.

Overall the dinner was quite good but not exceptional. The salad had too much dressing, the asparagus was overcooked and the sea scallops were a bit overcooked, in my opinion. The dessert was probably my favorite part of the meal. It was perfect. 

The service was exceptional and the waiter and assistant waiters were attentive, polite and good at anticipating the needs of the table.

I had the beef tartar to start which was garnished on the side with tasteless capers, dry egg, onion and chives. Served with baguette cracker from out of a box you could get at the supermarket - I was not overwhelmed. 

Followed this I had the pasta in a nice tasting sauce, fired corn, spring onions, a few crawfish tails, spicy andouille sausage and with 4 decent shrimp that was overall just slightly above average, with the shrimp stealing the show.

The service started off bumpy, there was a little wait which wasn't too bad. The host offered to give me a call when the table was ready. After getting the call and heading back to be seated - I was ignored from the same host and manager-like guy in a suit. Finally had to ask if they were ready for me or not, the host tells me to hold on and continues to seat 2 parties behind me. At this point, I'm getting frustrated and finally ask the manager-like guy to be seated, he brushes off my frustration and seats me closest to the front entrance - not the best spot for sure... seriously.

My server and her partner were pleasant and attentive, which made me reconsider staying versus leaving for a different restaurant. I order the ""Tasting Menu"", not a bad price for the options and portion sizes.  I ordered the Halibut, which is nicely presented on fennel spiced veggies - BUT half way into the filet... I smell an extremely strong ammonia odor. The first few bites were fine, maybe because the fennel spices are a bit powerful. But once I got to the thickest part of the fish, I had to stop dead in my tracks. Horrible!!!!

The manager-like guys comes over to check in on me and I tell him about the fish. He asks if I'd like to replace it and I tell him that I really wanted the fish - but was worried that the next filet might have the same ammonia smell. He says ""we don't treat the fish, so maybe it will"". WOW... Really? He offers another entr√©e and I settle for the Short Rib... it was pretty good.

Now I'm interested in why my dinner smelled like Windex, so while waiting for the Short Rib... I Google it. And I find that the smell of ammonia is an indicator of decaying, rotting fish. No way!!! I just ate half of a rotted piece of Halibut. After 2 bites of the Short Rib, I'm totally done with Table 10.

The overall service, quality of food and experience - not really worth it. There are tons of other options in Restaurant Row... better service and food for sure.",CiDhiqpRUYmI4c7uu30RFA,2,0,2,IpczSIUS1txPjXY6Rs1obQ

1349921,2016-08-14,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Good food and great service; the Taste of Table 10 special is probably the best bang-for-the-buck we encountered during our recent family vacation to Las Vegas (4 courses for $48).

My first course was the beet salad which was excellent. There was a nice combination of different beets (including pickled), as well as a generous dollop of goat cheese. But what really took this dish to the next level was the smear of pistachio butter on the plate - it was definitely a unique combination of flavor that put a huge smile on my face. The sweet corn soup was also very good. 

Next was the candied bacon - again, it was amazing. 3 generous, thick-cut slices of bacon with a maple syrup glaze. This dish doesn't need any more explanation, it was simply phenomenal and probably the highlight of my meal. 

For my third course I ordered the pork chop which was served on the bone over yams/sweet potatoes in a green-chili sauce. Although the entree was good, it simply doesn't stand up to the other courses. The thick pork, cooked mid-well, was a little too tough for my taste (hence the deduction of 1 star). The yams were delicious with a mild sweetness, and the sauce tied the dish together beautifully. Don't worry, it wasn't spicy. Other highlights include the beef short rib and filet mignon.

Finally came the carrot cake which far exceeded my expectations. The cake and cream cheese frosting had a nice, firm texture, but it wasn't overly dense or heavy. It came topped with pecans which delivered a satisfying crunchy texture. The banana cream pie, bread pudding, and chocolate torte were also very good. 

Service was also great - our waitress was eager to give us suggestions, and extra bread (excellent) was promptly brought out upon request. 

Everyone enjoyed their meal and there were absolutely no left-overs despite nicely-size portions.",8A7Gg3CLZdAhrId-AylfCA,0,0,4,v_KRmiNGeV-ys_QLQluh0g

Since I did buy the voucher, my fiance and I shared the 4 course meal and I also got a salad and truffle mac n cheese. The pre-fixe meal is honestly more than enough for 2 people so I recommend sharing if you're with one other person. The candied bacon, barbecue shrimp and filet mignon were incredible.

1374606,2017-02-14,3,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"My fianc√© and I were staying at the Palazzo on our most recent trip to Vegas.  We were walking through the casino and who walks past me, but none other than Emeril Lagasse himself!  I was totally star struck.  I had to compose myself and keep from yelling, ""Bam!""  So, when we got back to the room we were deciding where to have dinner and I was like, ""Let's go to one of Emeril's restaurants."" 
There are numerous Emeril restaurants located around town including I believe 3 in the Venetian/Palazzo, but we chose this one for several reasons.  1.  It was in our hotel.  2.  It had a 4 course meal for $48 special that looked pretty awesome.  3.  It is not all seafood.  I've watched Emeril on tv for a long time, but I've never been to any of his restaurants because I don't eat seafood and this is a focus at many of his restaurants.  We had considered going to one of his places over at MGM, but it was seafood.  There are 2 Emeril restaurants here in Orlando where I leave, but again, mainly seafood.  I checked out the menu at Table 10 and there were lots of non seafood options.  
We made a reservation for 6:30.  We were going to a 9pm show.  The restaurant was not crowded and we were seated promptly.  We both decided to go with the 4 courses for $48 because it seemed like a good deal and it was an opportunity to try lots of different things.  I knew I wouldn't be able to eat everything they gave me, but since this was my first outing at a Lagasse restaurant I would be able to try 4 to 8 different things (depending on how much I stole from my fianc√©)
We started with cocktails.  There were so many amazing cocktails on the menu.  This was definitely my kind of cocktail list.  It had lots of fruity martini style drinks.  
I started with a salad.  It sounds blah, but it was awesome.  The dressing on it was unlike any other dressing I've ever had in my life.  It was creamy, but still had that vinegar sort of kick.  It was chopped up really thin to give it an airy quality that was just fantastic.  I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing.  Our server told us the 4 course menu items were about 2 ounces smaller than the standard portions.  The standard salad must be massive.  My fianc√© had bbq shrimp.  He said they were good.  
For our second course I had candied bacon.  Shut the front door this was good!  It was 4 strips of thick cut bacon with this bourbon glaze.  It was sweet and salty.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My fianc√© had mushroom pasta.  I am not a fan of mushrooms, but the sauce on this pasta was outstanding.  
For my entr√©e I had the French onion short rib.  The broth was so flavorful.  The short ribs were tender and they were topped with cheese and crostini.  Yum!  My fianc√© had the petite filet and it was extremely delicious.  He said he liked his better than mine.  I thought they were both pretty fantastic.  
For dessert he ordered the banana cream pie and I order these little donuts filled with white chocolate.  Again, just outstanding.  I preferred his banana cream pie.  The donuts were too rich.  
Overall, this was an excellent meal.  We both really enjoyed it.  The service was outstanding.  The ambiance was cool, and we felt like we got a wide variety of high quality food for our money.",9Y1ljNsHeK-FpJ3SAYFC4w,2,2,5,rt80mPl6jb5Gk2IsqnLvwA

The appetizer came in a large portion and to make things worse, it wasn't even good! It was bland and I felt like I was basically eating fried bread. The truffle mac n cheese was also bland with barely a hint of truffle oil. The best thing about this place is the little roll of bread they serve you before your meal. Now that was good!

1396191,2015-09-08,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"For our last night in Vegas, we decided to try another Lagasse restaurant and being that it was in our hotel, it seemed like a worthy choice in sea of delicious options. I've dined at Emerils' Delmonico's Steak and that was impressively delicious, but figured that Table 10 would be a nice yet casual option. 

The environment is very nice, very chic decor with a warmth to it that was pleasant upon arrival. We had a reservation but the restaurant wasn't very busy so it wasn't really needed for some reason. Maybe because it was Labor Day weekend? Not sure. It was oddly not busy considering other places in Vegas were for the most part full, so that kind of struck me a bit. 

We ordered some cocktails which were good, nothing really special jumped out at us, but that was okay since we were there for the food. And the food did NOT disappoint! The menu is marked with a few of Emerils Signature dishes that made him famous early on, so we went with a few for starters. I had the crab hush puppies which were in a marmalade that was heavenly. My boyfriend had Emeril's New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, also a HIT for the palate! Then we both decided on the nightly dinner special of Waygu Skirt Steak with Shrimp, Asparagus and Lyonaise potatoes with Blue Cheese. We pretty much cleaned our plates because it was so good. We shared for dessert the White Chocolate Malassadas with Raspberry Sauce which are like tiny beignets filled with white chocolate and covered in cinnamon sugar. Great finish to the meal!

The service was good for the most part. Two waiters handled our table and were always around to fill glasses and replace drinks. The hostess was pleasant and helpful at the door.

Now you may be wondering why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars? For me it was a small thing but significant. Our dining room was somewhat empty. Maybe 4 tables full at 8:30 at night. And two tables over I see a customer drinking from a long plastic yard arm bottle filled with liquor from another place like Fat Tuesdays and her companion wearing a baseball cap. Considering I'm spending $48 for my entree alone, I found it totally inappropriate to allow customers to bring in alcohol from other places and not be dressed for dinner. Kinda felt like I was at a TGI Fridays. In that regard, Table 10 should readjust because it cheapened the vibe of the restaurant and Emerils' amazing cuisine.",n12Bn7T5Kh2Ak6a2bHfYLg,3,3,3,NmG5uUk-x1CBKorjEvO_3g

Emeril despite his attempts at upscale dining makes food I usually really like.  His Cajun/Creole offerings are very good, not Paul Prudhomme good, but close.

So we showed up at this place around 9:30pm on a Fri night, place is half empty.  Oh oh, bad sign.  I read the Yelp reviews and understood what I was in for, or at least I thought so.  Another dumb hostess, seriously do they breed these airheads on a sub off the coast?  She says there is a 20 min wait, umm check again we have a reservation and I can see 6 empty tables?!?  So we sit down to wait, 5 mins go by and now she is ready to seat us, at one of the 6 empty tables...nooo.  She marches us into the area in front of the kitchen door, no lie and points to the table.  I don't think so!  I tell bubble brain I don't want to sit in front of the kitchen door and point to the 6 empty tables, requesting one of them.  ""We aren't using them tonight, we don't have a waiter for that section""...wtf?

So great, now we are in the traffic pattern. Its too late to go anywhere else on a Fri night except this dump and eat before 11.  Should have gone to Beijing Noodle #9, better food, hotter hostess, no damn kitchen to sit in front of.

Waiter shows up, along with bread, water boy etc and we order.  Wedge salad for me, carppacio for my dining companion.  Both were good, salad slightly over dressed.  I ordered linguine with clams and counterpart ordered diver scallops.  Here's where it falls apart.  Linguine is over cooked, can't anyone in this town cook pasta?  It is a solid ball of gunk, put my fork in it and pick it all up.  I signal the waiter who comes over and I demo.  He looks at me and says I kid you not, ""Is there a problem""?  Seriously, he had no idea.  I tell the wunderkind that it is over cooked and he says ""Oh"".  I would have laughed if I wasn't so incredulous.  So he goes and gets the manager, who at least understands its overcooked.  So back it goes, I eat bread and wait and wait and seriously it takes 7 mins to cook pasta, less if its fresh are they farming new clams?
About 15 mins later I get another dish of linguine and clams, but get this, they used the same clams.  Including the one that didnt open the first time they cooked it!  The diver scallops were ok, nothing great.  Dessert was a weird flourless chocolate cake that I have had before elsewhere, but this one was tasteless.  Not a hint of chocolate, kept thinking nah its got to be me, but dining companion agreed.  How do you make a chocolate cake that is tasteless??",9mFYURF6ZivLXYKj8MOl5w,0,0,2,jNTOcbXpG6rVLMcFyWFhQA

Made a reservations for a party of 8 Saturday afternoon for the same night and was able to get a table at 7:30pm, which led me to think this place is not crowded. Arrived at the restaurant and seated us outside the restaurant by the shopping area, which was nice. 

Since I can only speak for the dished I ordered, I'll rate my dishes only.  I started off with the Sauteed Escargot. The escargots were shelled and sauteed over some sort of garlic sauce, I was surprised how many escargots were there and the texture was slightly chewy, which they should be. It was good but not great maybe because there wasn't enough gaaaaarlic. Then I ordered the special of the day, Monkfish with sauteed Main Lobster, this dish was very good. The monkfish was very simple and tender and the lobster has a buttery flavor, however there were only like 4-5 little pieces of lobster meat. I did not order any dessert but i had a taste of my friends Kahlua creme brulee, it had a very strong espresso flavor and was very smooth.

Overall, the service was subpar, food was good, price was a bit on the high side but expected, very friendly ambiance, and most of all I had a good meal with my friends.",hM9HMW8QGQUG03ITwntFcw,0,0,4,EakKHCDgiLmiHJNmGO3oHA

Course 1: Coriander crusted ahi with pineapple salsa, smoked paprika oil, and sweet soy glaze
Course 2: Seared scallop on mango risotto with chimichurri butter sauce
Course 3: Halibut with sake-braised bok choy, shaved fennel, red onion and shiitake mushrooms in spicy ginger broth
Course 4: Filet mignon on lobster mashed potatoes with foie gras and mushroom ragout
Course 5: The famous malasadas, but also carrot cake, flourless chocolate cake, coconut cream pie in tuile with chocolate whipped cream, and a malted creme brulee with malted milk ball chocolate shards

Everyone freaking adored the scallop, and the filet was amazing too.  It was really fun just turning up with absolutely no idea what to expect and having tasty food appear in front of us.  

Best part: we'd been told to expect to pay around $200 apiece, but even with three (out of five) of us doing wine pairings it came out to $110 apiece with tip.

1622762,2014-08-31,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Dear Mr. Lagasse:

I'm a long-time admirer of your work.  In the mid-90's, I can recall sitting down at my television set, waiting enthusiastically for your television show to come on.  I watched it religiously and learned much about cooking--good cooking--from your show.  

So, when I recently visited Las Vegas and was looking for a final lunch before heading to the airport, I was pleased to have stumbled upon Table 10, and was even more pleased to learn the restaurant served lunch.  I was thrilled--really thrilled.  I sat down at the bar and asked the friendly bartender about his favorites on the menu.  The first thing out of his mouth was the chicken sandwich.  I said, ""Sure, let's do it."" I ordered a tasty cocktail and waited anxiously for the meal/lunch to arrive.  

What did the sandwich look like upon arrival?  Great.  Stunning!  The visual presentation was spot on.

With mouth watering and a smile on my face, I picked up half of the sandwich and leaned in for the first bite.  

The result?  Simply put, the texture of the bread was wonderful.  It was a pillowy ciabatta.  I then caught the taste of the chicken as I continued my bite.  It was perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of salt and spices.  For a split second, I was in heaven.  

Then, I hit the chicken.  Or should I say my teeth hit the chicken.  Initially, I thought I had bitten into a toothpick or some other hard object.  I was stunned to learn I had not.  It was the texture of the chicken!  Tough, leathery--almost jerky-like--I had to grind through each bite of the chicken pieces until I finished the sandwich.  

Should I have gone no further than bite one and just simply sent it back? I suppose I could have done that, but it's not my job to demand that I be served a quality sandwich.  Rather, it's the kitchen's job to nail it on the first try.  

The kitchen served me the sandwich I got.  I ate it.  It was truly disappointing, as I've admired your work as a culinary giant for many years.  It was almost a great sandwich, but for the chicken.

1633100,2009-01-17,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,Table 10. Hmm.... Three yelp stars. I expected more from the guy who's face is on the hot sauce bottle in my pantry. There were six of us on a sunday evening. We basically had the place to ourselves. The service was impeccable but having worked for years as a server I expect nothing less on a slow night. We started out with wine and appetizers. It's hard to go wrong with wine when my stepdad picks(and is buying for that matter). Calamari and escargot were nothing to write home about. The calamari had a weird texture almost like it wasn't quite done and the aioli was bland. I was even more disappointed with the escargot. Hardly any flavor to it at all. My filet on the other hand was cooked to perfection. Although as long as you don't overcook it filet is good without any help. The smashed potatoes were the best I've ever had. No dessert. Didn't see one that stood out to me which shouldn't be that hard to do. The ambiance was great except for the the way the bar was set up. Every time the bartender set the bar down behind him it was so loud it made me jump. I also loved all the open kitchen and the spice shelves (emeril needs more than a rack apparently) although I thought the Costco size tub of Zatarains seasoning was weird(yes I know he's from New Orleans). One of these things is not like the other.... I would go back but would not be at the top of my list. I just felt a little let down by this famous food network guy.,ZZ1s6E0RBL0jRK4Gjitchw,1,1,3,l7q2Dwte9psYMlu7FUoVPg

We should have known we were in trouble when there were only 5 other tables of guests at 7:30 PM.  We were quite sad to learn the the wonderful creole menu that we had been attracted to had been completely changed that day, however we were not notified of this change when they confirmed our reservations.

Our server was completely unprofessional.  When we had questions about the new menu, we were repeated told that he was ""not sure"" as the menu was new.  We were all confused why he could not pass our questions on to the chef, but he did not.

The final straw for me was when I asked about the type of nuts in the dessert special, as I am allergic to SOME nuts, and he indicated to me that the chef was too busy to answer any questions about the kind of nuts in the dessert and I should just not order it.  Oh, really...thanks.

At the end of the meal we spoke to the manager, who was also totally unprofessional, and he just gave us excuses about why our service was poor and then gave us examples about accommodations that were made for others with food allergies - which made me feel terrible, since that

Gumbo, BBQ shrimp, bacon, & Cesar salad were as good as any dishes I've had anywhere. Dining at the bar was great as was the service and pace. The peach chicken was juicy & flavorful like dark meat but was a meaty breast -- I never order chicken for a nice dinner out, but this was really good and would recommend. 

Did I mention the roasted bacon appetizer? They use thick and lean cuts, apply brown sugar and cayenne pepper then roast. Served with a maple dipping sauce - really unique and so good. Was a tad on the spicy side but worked for me. 

If there was anything that wasn't a '10', I'd say the skirt steak. It was very good and lean and flavorful but I've had that elsewhere. Since it was 'only' an 8, it really underscored how great the rest of the dishes were. 

Finished with chocolate mousse which was also very good - wife had lemon bar which she said was top notch.

Table 10 is located in The Palazzo and it is one of Emeril Lagasse's Las Vegas restaurants.  The restaurant sits in a little shopping/restaurant area of The Palazzo that is a good distance away from the casino.

The decor is eclectic but not over the top.  It is a dark space with mostly dark browns (hardwood floor, high bar stools, half booths, walls, etc.).  There are splashes of color though as well as prominent but not ghastly decoration.  The overhead light fixtures are modern and alternate in color (blues and yellows).  Lots of design throughout the room with patterns in the bar seat cushions and the backs of the booths.  Also, the table tops are decorated in multi-colored tiles.  Some metal decoration too including a wrought iron spiral staircase at the center of the bar, which I think heads to nowhere.

The complimentary bread was a brioche roll, which was pretty good.  The crust was not much of a crust--kind of like the crust of a normal dinner roll.  There was a pretty good soft and flavorful brioche center that went well with butter.

I started with the Seared Maine Sea Scallops With Crispy Fried Leeks, Lobster Tail And Salsa Provencal.  Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced, but I felt they actually could have charged more for this dish.  For the price, there was a generous portion of seafood (scallops and lobster).  The quality was great too.  The scallops had a nice caramelized sear with a tender and moist inside (though the scallops were a little gritty).  The lobster was tender and sweet. 

The fried leeks went great with the seafood.  They were very crisp, but they were not oily or greasy.  Good onion flavor.  The sauce was the base of the plate and it consisted of oil, tomato and olives (the olive flavor was very strong).  The sauce had a little bit of spice to it.  The sauce was not bad though not the best flavor and I did not think it complimented the dish (the seafood stood out fine by itself).

My entree was seared tuna on a crispy corn cake over a tomato confit base.  The tuna portion was small (though it was a lunch dish).  The tuna was good.  Nice sear on the outside with a rare center.  The crispy corn cake had a crunchy outside and a sweet corn center.  The tomato confit base was kind of like a warmed up salsa and I was not a big fan of it (the sauce really reminded me of a tomato sauce I had at Xiomara Melrose so maybe this cuisine/style is just not for me).  While the tuna was good and everything was cooked properly, the resulting flavors did not really go together that well.

I think my disappointment with both sauces/flavors had a lot to due with how each dish had a flavor/ingredient that stood out too much--olive for the starter and tomato for the entree (and not necessarily the best flavor/representation of those ingredients).  It could just be a matter of preference.  They did use very good quality seafood ingredients so I could see how these dishes might appeal more to others.

Service was good.  The waiter was soft-spoken, polite and attentive.  Food came out at a good pace.

I have never been to an Emeril Lagasse restaurant before so I do not know how this one stacks up to his other locations.  For lunch, the ingredients they use here are better than some of the other Vegas restaurants serving lunch in the same price range.  There are definitely some positives here and it might be worth trying if you are a fan of Emeril Lagasse (or are curious about his food).

I walked here, but I imagine The Palazzo has complimentary valet and self-parking like other major Las Vegas hotels/casinos.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,12,14,3,towPh2FMCF-pZ0TXy-6xXg

Possibly because of that, the service was excellent - attentive refilling of water, second offering of warm fluffy rolls, and  refolding of napkins during bathroom breaks.  These little things are nice when unexpected.

My friends got filet mignons (~$40), which were delicious for their carnivore delights.  I opted to double up on appetizers for the same price (~$15 each).  The half rack of Kuronuta baby back ribs were very tender with the right amount of slightly spicy sauce, and the pickled corn on top actually pair welled with the ribs.  The mushroom fettuccine (I think it was fettuccine?) was delicious - the cream sauce was light, although some might think there were too many mushrooms (which I like).

The Frangelico cr√®me brulee was AMAZING.  The custard filling was just the right consistency and not too sweet.  This was balanced by the rich caramel burnt-crust goodness.  We were surprised to find a layer of baked hazelnut chocolate at the bottom, which was unnecessary and a bit too dark chocolately for my taste.  The birthday girl also got free coconut ice cream, which was good but merely an understudy to the spectacular cr√®me brulee.

The ambiance is a tad dark and romantic on the interior with a pretty cool glass partitioned room filled with wine dividing two dining areas.  I think if I were to eat here again, i'd request a seat inside.  We sat out on the patio...if you can call it that...more of a gated off section in the mall area of the Palazzo.  It was bright, loud, but great for people watching...I give it that!

The service is FANTASTIC...they give you three servers per table and when the food comes out, it ALL comes out...in one swoop.  So no waiting for your honey's plate to come out while yours sits there in front of you cooling off...THAT, I like!

As for the food, have to say, quite impressive but not for the cost.  We started with the escargot which was served up inside what appeared to be fried potato skins with a wine demi-glaze of sorts.  Divine flavor...the perfect blend of sweet and sultry.

Entrees...mom had the sea scallops which, if you like scallops, were pretty good.  They were served up in a bowl in some sort of corn and sweet tomato sauce.  I had the filet with the add-on of lump crab and chive butter and my honey had the lamb atop mashed potatoes. And funny thing, looking at the menu from their site now...NONE of the things we ate are even on there aside of the snails!  What the?  Most of the items I see on their online menu are less expensive than what we ate...

My filet alone (thanks mom for paying for dinner by the way!  whew...) was $38...for JUST the steak!  The crab add-on was another $15!!  And no veggie.  Just the beef and shellfish...$53.  Like I said...OVERPRICED.  Excellent but not worth the cost...The lamb on the menu is listed as $27 but when we had it...$38.  You would think in a recession that they'd LOWER, not RAISE the cost.

For desert...we had a trio of dishes.  I had the blueberry bread pudding with lemon and caramel sauce, mom had the chocolate malted creme brulet, and the honey had these little donut thingies which were essentially balls of white chocolate wrapped up in a donut hole and then deep fried.  Yuuuuuuum.

Overall...lovely meal but I won't be hitting up the place any time soon seeing as i'm unemployed. :(  I'd suggest saving up and splurging here or just taking your business to another establishment where you might get a little more for your $.",Mh7oEIX2oHYAXm-HAxlfWw,5,3,4,xqAs4Qwz3TLAFPaJGlLUVg
1858820,2013-07-30,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"My experience of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants is that they are generally of a high caliber.  Unlike other celebrity chefs, I do not get the impression that Lagasse is content to rest on his laurels, instead he gives the same quality attention to the menu and quality food that made him famous.  Table 10 does not disappoint.  

We wanted to go to one nicer restaurant while we were in town and this was the consensus choice after perusing menus and prices.  It certainly is a little more on the pricey side, but it is not unreasonable given the quality of the food and service.  I will begin with that: the service was tremendous.  Our waiter was vigilant and took good care of us.  He even honored our check-in deal of a free glass of sangria even though it was slightly after the check in time.  Needless to say, he got a good sized tip.  

My friend and I had the tasting menu which was incredibly reasonable for the price of $45 dollars.  For my first course I had the bacon.  It was perfectly cooked and not too crispy at all.  It was cured but not dripping with sugar as has happened at other places.  Given the sauce it had a bit of a bite which was quite pleasant.  For dinner I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked with a rich and creamy flavor.  They literally melted in your mouth.  I would recommend it as a main course for anyone; even if you aren't a huge fan of scallops these are well worth it.  Finally, for dessert I had ice cream which was delicious but not necessarily anything to write home about.

Our table was available upon our arrival at 7pm and we were immediately seated. Our server Kasey, immediately attended the table and introduced herself and her support staff. I started with a gin martini that came as ordered and with three olives! My companions studied the wine list that had a wide and varied selection.

After much debate, for appetizers, my two dining mates shared a calamari starter; the calamari had a light batter, was crisp and tender and came with two delectable sauces. I opted for the gumbo. This was worth the visit alone. A bigger portion and this could have sufficed for a main course.

For the main course one of my companions selected the lobster pot pie. This was an interesting concoction with lobster claws and vegetables in a light cream gravy. While tasty and unique, my companion didn't like the inordinate amount of corn in the pie. My other companion and I both ordered the grilled lamb. This was a ""deconstructed"" meal meaning that it was a la carte and sides were separate. The lamb looked and smelled delicious but the eating the meal had overtones of completing a decathlon. The meat was laced with fat and gristle throughout and the sinewy texture made it near impossible to chew thoroughly. When a tender piece was found it was delicious immersed in the accompanying red wine sauce.  the three of us shared two side dishes - the asparagus and a ""to die for"" lobster macaroni and cheese, though pricey at $17.50. 

We each had a glass of house wine and had no room for dessert. Certainly, for two of us we had no energy in our jaws to eat or chew further. 

We approached Kasey, our server and detailed the difficulties with our main course. She promptly approached the Manager who quickly and without fuss deducted the price of both lamb dishes from the bill. Without the deduction, the bill was $183. 

Overall, considering the ambiance, high quality of service and high quality of food, despite our run in with the lamb, we will return on another visit to Las Vegas. The management at Table 10 obviously believe in customer service.",kMhc2vVQZ39p6agn0arNiw,0,0,4,w9pUBewQg-lzmrjm7fXyYw

1919024,2011-12-20,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Oh, Emeril. 
I don't think this is a love connection.

I went to Delmonico's a few years back and found the service amazing, the food over seasoned, but I fell in love with his banana cream pie.  I wanted to give Emeril another try - but I wasn't prepared to spend Delmonico money again.

So for lunch, we went to Table 10 on a Saturday.  The food was average or below average.  We enjoyed the rolls and butter. For a starter we shared the Gumbo which we both really liked. Mr. R had the Shrimp Po Boy and liked it - nothing too spicy and it was a good sized sandwich with lots of shrimp.  The fries appeared to be the same ones served at Red Robin - which is nice since we like Red Robin fries - but this food wasn't Red Robin prices!  I got a special of Risotto with watercress, lemon, and shrimp (3).  I am not a risotto expert, and I probably do overcook it at home - but the risotto was so undercooked and crunchy. I was biting down on hard little risotto nuggets all during lunch.  Ew.  

The service was disappointing.  We got what we needed and we were served our food, but our server was clearly grouchy and did not smile.  This guy did not like his job, did not like us, and possibly kicks puppies. I felt like we really inconvenienced him by eating lunch in his section.

FIRST COURSE
FLAME-ROASTED MARROW BONES: $11 for three giant bones. This was a great start t our meal, with the gelatinous gold spread onto baguette slices and sprinkled with sea salt. (Not part of the 4/$48)
ROASTED PUMPKIN SOUP: I assume it's seasonal, and it is damn good. Get it while you can. This soup is surprisingly thick (like potato) yet smooth, with a light, rich flavor. The toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin oil added just the right bit of ""extra"" to keep it from being too simple.
CHICKEN + ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: it's not my favorite version, but a passable one for the Strip location. Slightly spicy, surprisingly meaty, and served over soft white rice.

SECOND COURSE
EMERIL'S BBQ SHRIMP: Overcooked shrimp seemed like it had been sitting out, the NewOrleans barbecue glaze wasn't well-received by others at the table, and the rosemary biscuit had nice flavors but was hard and dry.
SMOKEY MUSHROOM PASTA: A surprise hit! Fresh, perfectly al-dente pasta with tasso ham, smoked mushrooms, and parmesan cheese, with a zesty Cajun sauce. I could have done without the ham, and expected slightly more mushrooms given the name of the dish, but was pleasantly surprised by this dish.

THIRD COURSE (MAINS)
EMERIL'S PORK CHOP: served with caramelized sweet potatoes, which paired perfectly and went perfectly with the colder fall season. This was one of the best pork chops I've had, tender and juicy with plenty of flavor and a great seasoning/glaze. The menu description also mentions a ""green chile mole"" that I either didn't receive or that simply wasn't distinct from the other flavors on the plate.
CARAMELIZED SEA SCALLOPS: Got this over the short rib at the suggestion of our server, and ended up really enjoying it. Light flavors and portion, consisting of 3 large scallops served on a smear (there really should have been more!) of a great cauliflower puree, with a sea of brown butter sauce, accented with raisins, marcona almonds, and capers. This was surprisingly well-balanced, I liked that the capers didn't overpower the other, milder ingredients. I do wish the scallops had a better sear, though.

FOURTH COURSE (DESSERTS)
BANANAS FOSTER BREAD PUDDING: A decent bread pudding, topped with two lonely slices of banana, with a caramel glaze and more whipped cream and chocolate shavings. A less successful banana-based dessert.
EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE: Heavenly. A homemade crust topped with tons of fresh banana, a blanket of smoothly sweet banana cream, and decorated with chocolate curls, caramel sauce, and whipped cream. I would come back for this.

Our server, Diana, was great at making suggestions and checking on us without being overbearing. Interior seating is dark and quiet with a date-night atmosphere. Large bar area offers a limited ""bar bites"" menu, and there is a HH available, but by far the best deal is their 4 course dinner.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,8,4,A-WfPKt837x7_Fvnav_00Q

It was easy to partner with a friend and each of us select different dishes, try each other's, and therefore taste a good portion of all offerings.

HITS AND MISSES IN ALL AREAS
Who would choose the Candied North Bacon appetizer? Yes- I love bacon too. But a bowl full of thick, rubbery cuts is not as enjoyable as it seems. The accompanying syrup was overkill. At least Hub's Crawfish Chowder was flavorful and the spiciness was offset well with the plop of cream on top. My Spare Rib was very soft but the taste wasn't memorable especially when against their Filet Mignon. The Pistachio Panna Cotta was soft with the right amount of contrasting flavors and textures. Meanwhile my Bread Pudding was creamy with lots of banana but the whipped cream on top somehow seemed to melt, disappear, and not contribute anything.

The steak tartar was AMAZING. chopped steak, onions, fried capers, and three toast pieces.

I wish there were more pieces of toast to go with that tartar but it was truly an amazing dish! every bite was fantastic!

The meal came out and his pizza margherita looked like a cheese pizza from cpk with basil leaves on top. kinda sad since were were expecting chunks of fresh mozzarella on tomato pizza with basil..whatever, it tasted good.

My lobster roll looked more like sliders filled with imitation crab salad. soaking in mayo! I took a bite and realized that there was no way I could eat that! I was expecting a soft and fluffy roll with mayo and big chunks of lobster coated in butter! 

I called the waiter and he was very happy to change out the lobster rolls. I order the croquet madame instead. it came with a side salad the the most amazing roasted potatoes I have ever had! The sandwich was good. the ham was yummy. :)

WHAT?!?! Checking in using my Yelp app gave me a free sangria?! Hot stuff!! Alright, this is already starting well.  I ordered the Mango & Spice cocktail, which was very interesting. Sweet, but with a jalepeno kick at the end. It got better as I continued to drink it.

The service was...just so-so. Our waiter acted like he'd rather be doing something else.  He forgot my Sprite and was generally rather flat and somewhat unfriendly. Turned out, we came at the end of his shift, so we ended up with a different server for the last half of our meal. He was a bit better.

The meal started with the best, softest, warmest, most delicious rolls.  They just brought them out one at a time for each diner, so we ended up having to ask for more. I think I could have just eaten those rolls for my meal!!

I ordered the lobster mac & cheese and the BBQ shrimp (on the Happy Hour menu) for my meal.  I loved them both! There were just 3 shrimp, but they were nicely sized, and there was plenty of sauce. The lobster mac & cheese was obviously meant for sharing (it was $19), so I didn't finish the whole thing. It was yummy! Big chunks of lobster throughout, creamy mac & cheese with breadcrumbs baked on top.

My friends ordered the gumbo (said it was a bit too salty), and the shrimp po boy (pretty tasty).

We had a coupon from the Palazzo for an extra 15% off, which they honored with no problem, but I had to send the bill back to get the sangria taken off the bill (thanks again, Yelp!).

I finally settled for the truffle Mac and cheese. It's more of a side dish, but it was really good. You can really taste the truffle. It's definitely their very own Mac and cheese because I've never had it made that way before anywhere else. 

However, this restaurant deserves four stars for their service. They weren't busy at all, but our waiter was really nice. What he did which will forever be in my memory is that he asked if we wanted to split the check before we even asked him. No one, in my entire life, has ever done that.

2124015,2009-02-20,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"I thought about this review for a while.  The thing is, I had read about this place in Frommer's and this was a place they highly recommended, due to its reasonable (for Vegas) prices and high quality Emeril fare.  Vegas, as a whole, is incredibly high-priced and if you're not ready to routinely spend about 100 dollars a meal, I wouldn't go.  Unless you buffet it (and even though, that can get pricey).  OK, so I know that's not entirely true, but that's how it felt at least, not wanting to eat food court fare.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled.

In any case, we were excited about Table 10, and we ordered a calamari starter, the pork tenderloin and scallops.  All were delicious, although ultimately I believe it gave me food poisoning.  The pork was so tender, and thinking back on it, probably undercooked.  I did, after all, spend the entire next day reversing my fortune.

It was good food though, and pretty reasonably priced for Vegas.  If I'm going to go all out next time though, I might just head for the Wynn or Bellagio, I kind of wanted to try out the restaurant Picasso.",wQVSnX4s8gCExe5yq5m9CQ,0,0,3,DHj07QOcd7PqrK4en3ILzA

Table 10, an Emril Lagasse restaurant, was fairly empty and so seating was simple. This restaurant has pretty nice d√©cor with dark grain woods but a bit dim where we were seated.

The cuisine here is American with a Cajun flare. We all opted for a four course dinner for $48 that comes with a soup or salad, appetizer, entr√©e, and dessert.  

Our dinner started it some cocktails which were pretty good and strong. For our soup/salad option, we all chose the chicken andouille gumbo which was very tasty. For appetizers, we share the candied maple bacon, New Orleans bbq shrimp, and mushroom puffs. The bacon was utterly delicious as so was the bbq shrimp that came with Cajun bbq glaze and rosemary biscuit. Mushroom puff was just okay. For or entr√©e, we all chose the 6oz filet migon in a red wine sauce. Pretty good but wished I ordered the pork chop. 

Our last options included dessert which is the most important part of dinner. We chose the infamous banana cream pie, spiced carrot cake, and milk chocolate mousse smores. The banana cream pie was good. I've had it before so it didn't wow me. Came with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. The milk chocolate mousse smores was a bit too sweet for me. Spiced carrot cake with candied pecans and orange bourbon sauce was my favorite. One of the better carrot cakes I've had in the longest time. 

Service was great here and very attentive making sure our table was clean after each course.

(PS - if you think having a celebrity chef name would make the food somehow taste better... Think twice on whether you want good tasting or just subpar food because of the brand...) 

Make A Reservation - I can't emphasize this enough because I saw lots of families with small children waiting for table(s)... Probably passing their dinner time!)

We were a party of 6 and only 2 dishes were memorable... Amongst multiple starters/6 entrees/side veggies...  That says a lot about ones eating experience.

Our server recommended a ""seafood stew pasta"" dish for me.. It was terrible... Overly seasoned with salt & pepper, very heavy sauce and nothing special about this ""creole"" style dish.  Others had a variation of fish/chicken/porkchop/risotto dish...  

The pork chop was probably the only edible dish, thick cut and moist.  I think the risotto was the other decent dish... But I was so disappointed with the seafood stew that basically left me thirsting for gulps of water... To tame the acid eroding my palate that I couldn't bother sampling it... Thankfully I had a bite of the pork chop before diving on mine.  The calamari salad, as a starter was the best... (Watch out for the chili peppers!)

Service was excellent, attentive at a good pace, not rushed.  Drinks were good (we sat at the bar first and had wine before being seated at our table).  Overall a ""meh, we've had better meals especially in Vegas, no shortage of fine dining... ""  experience.

2191622,2016-03-25,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Went here with a group of friends when on vacation in Las Vegas. While wandering around The Palazzo in the afternoon we came across this restaurant. There was no wait for a table and the menu looked relatively good so we decided to give it a try.

When we went to ask for a table the hostess was looking down and did not acknowledge me standing there until I said ""Hello"" then she looked up from the screen and greeted us. We were seated immediately which was nice and our server immediately came over and took our drink orders. We had our drinks with in a few minutes which was nice and fast.

The menu looked great everything looked so good I just wanted to try it all. I ended up choosing the smokey mushroom pasta while my one of my other friends ordered the Chicken breast sandwich. There were more people in my group I just cannot remember what they all ordered. We were a group of 7 all together. Our food took longer then expected to receive considering there were not many other people in the restaurant and no other group larger than three were in there. It took 28 minutes to receive our orders. 

The food itself presentation wise was great. Flavor wise it was good, not great nothing to rave about. I have had some better mushroom pasta back where I am from at an Italian restaurant in Long Beach CA. My friends were satisfied with their meals but again, nothing to rave about.

The servers were nice and friendly but lacked attentiveness. On a couple occasions we ran out of water, waited for a few minutes (about 8 to 10) for a server to check in on us so I could ask but that never happened. I ended up just walking back over to the hostess and asked her to relay it to our server. She apologized for it and immediately went to the back to get us our server. 

The decor in the restaurant is really nice and appealing the overall ascetic of it is welcoming. 
In the end I probably would not return due to the fact that the food was nothing to brag about but I am happy we gave it a try and would say it's worth trying out if you don't mind spending a little bit more on a meal.",ORK92XXIpuE6fZg6x0tJ5A,0,0,3,9I7Ef27zVsM79x9Rwiyjjg

Intimate, well-lit but still romantic lighting, the type of chill lounge music that I listen to looping for the one hour that I was there and attractive decor that simply drew my attention. I was alone (quite possibly one of my first times ever eating alone in a sit-down restaurant!) so I had time to peruse over the menu and establishment. I sat at the bar hoping maybe I'll run into someone else waiting for their plane flight to come up. Well, she never spoke to me if she did make it to that bar.

Onto the Happy Hour! Ordered:

Beef Satay - No lie, I thought this dish was going to be horrible. I had it set out in my mind that I was going to hate it. However, I really enjoyed the grilled satay beef skewers. The lowest cut of beef they seemed to have use was chuck, the beef was flavorful and melt in your mouth tender. I normally don't like sriracha but the light satay sauce that came with it blended nicely with the sriracha sauce.

3 oysters: I don't have a thing for raw oysters and while they were not the best that I've ever had, I did not find them unenjoyable. Plus they come with three different types of dipping sauces? Yes, please!

Cheese Plate (3 different kinds of cheeses): I wish there was a description as to what sort of cheese I was given but alas, they were nowhere to be found. Each cheese came with a small pairing piece by it (jam or honey) and complemented the cheeses very well. Something I can sit and slowly enjoy. I was given a piece with the entire rind on the underside, which bothered me because I don't really like the wax. When I pointed it out to my bartender/server, they immediately rectified the issue and brought me a new slice.

No Happy Hour is complete without drinks, of course!  Ordered the house pinot grigio, house pinot noir, aqua fresca and vodka tonic. House wines were surprisingly not as bad as I thought it would be. Aqua Fresca and vodka tonic were perfectly refreshing.

The damage? Less than $50! I ordered so much stuff, the SO thought I went with someone else!

Happy Hour is daily (sat and sun included!) from 4-6PM.

For appetizer we got the seafood creole bouillabaisse- twinkly eyes- so good. For the main course bf and brother ordered the rib-eye steak with lobster scampi- took a bite of and the steak was juicy and tender and the lobster scampi tasted woo hoo!!!
I as usual ordered pasta-the creole crawfish pasta. For some odd reason I like to try different kind of pasta's. I was skeptical about what is going to be in it. When it came out I was delighted to see my dish. It was flavorful with good amount of seafood and the sauce was awesome.

Over the summer I was able to attend a bachelorette in Vegas and the beautiful bride to be, some pretty ladies and myself had reservations here for dinner before going out to get into some trouble, I mean, have some fun. I decided to share my plate with one of the maids of honors. We ordered the:

-Sake Braised Beef Short Ribs $35
The meat was tender and cooked to perfection. The short ribs were soooo tender that they were fall off the fork soft. The glaze over the short ribs was delicious and very savory. The plate comes with sweet potato puree which surprisingly wasn't too sweet for my taste and it had a few roasted garlics on the side which we all truly loved and didn't regret eating when we got to the club haha. The plate was big enough for myself and another girl to share without feeling too full or still hungry after the meal. I swear, the roasted garlic here is truly delicious and one of the best I've had. 

-Truffle mac and cheese $11
The truffle was good, I wish it was a bit more truffle-y though. The mac and cheese was still good though. Creamy, cheesy and a perfect side dish to add to the short ribs. You must try it.

Our waiter was really nice and even brought the bride to be a dessert to congratulate her on her future marriage.

This was our last meal in Vegas before going our separate ways from both sides of the family - I didn't want to go too far so I decided to book a hotel restaurant through Open Table (to get the points even though I knew there wouldn't be a wait, hehe).

Service was awesome and they made good recommendations! We got the following to share:
- Glazed bacon
- Crispy calamari: soy and chili glaze, very delicious, a good tang to the dish
- Mushroom pasta: very flavorful but heavy
- pork chop: good flavor profile but can be more tender
- crawfish etouffee: good balance of stew to rice ratio and not too salty, very delicious 
- shrimp po boy sandwich: shrimps on the salty side and fries very well done
- brussels sprouts and grilled asparagus: yummy veggies!
- panna cotta & coffee: very refreshing and complementary combo

2350543,2009-12-14,4,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Went here for an event dinner with a set 5 course meal. I was expecting a lot since it is Emeril Lagassi's restaurant.

Overall the food was VERY rich. Dishes you can really enjoy in small quantities. So I was happy to have 5 courses of different flavors. 

Appetizers - Mushroom dumplings were actually really really good. Made out of similar wraps they use at chinese restaurants. Other appetizers included shrimp. All I have to say is I've never seen such a big juicy shrimp! man! delicious!

Course 1 was a ""organic"" salad - nothing special
Course 2 was a serving of 2 big ravioli's filled with shredded bbq pork. It was SO sweet. The first bite was good, but I really hesitated in finishing the 2nd ravioli. The entire thing was drenched in teriyaki sauce. I did appreciate the chesse among the beef, it had a bitter kick to the sweetness. I could see a lot of people appreciating the saltiness of the beef with the sweetness of the sauce.. but I was not a fan.
Course 3 was Mahi Mahi. It was supposed to be seared, but definately cooked all the way through.  This was my favorite dish of the night. I could tell the work and effort it took to make all the flavors in this dish come together. The fish was on top of a corn puree with tortilla chips. Almost like a gourmet fish/mexican dish! You really had to taste each individual sauce and component to decipher what it was. But when put together, it worked so well! Fish was DELICIOUSLY cooked!
Course 4 - prime rib! Huge portion and i had 2 bites and left the rest of the plate. The meat was on top of mash potatos and asparagus. Most of the prime rib came out medium to rare and made a bunch of us a little queezy. I thought it was delicious, but was too full by this point. 

Dessert - creme brulee. I was expecting.. crunch on top, light cream in the middle. NO. We got the thickest pudding/fudge chocolate... I took one bite and left the rest there also. But I did hear that their desserts are excellent here. 

Overall, the food was all very different. Semething you definately can't find most places - especially the combination of ingredients!  Felt like all the dishes were well thought out and put together. And of course - the service was excellent!",Dg1cJ224IfS2YwuJV5d5wQ,5,5,4,wNtKZsgIY0mFUnxM8_Rb1w

Table 10 serves American cuisines with a flair of creole and cajun influences. Being from the South and knowing my New Orleans food, I'd say this restaurant does not live up to Lagasse's name and reputation. The food was not enjoyable because of the overwhelming amount of salt in the dishes; I could barely taste the flavors of where the cultures are supposed to combine.  

The crab cake was overcooked and not a familiar consistency, the chicken + andouille gumbo left a gritty taste in my mouth, and the two main entrees of barbecue gulf shrimp and filet mignon were just average (if I had to pick one to favor over the other, I'd pick the shrimp but would ask for less sodium). The winner of the night was the banana foster bread pudding which was a good amount of moist with caramelized bananas done just right.

Overall I'd rate this restaurant a bit less than average, but given the convenient location and nice atmosphere, I'd say it's ""OK"". Come on, Table 10.. in the words of Lagasse, himself: ""Kick it up a notch!""",_9w_8JCIWqZWZjoC2SXYNg,1,1,3,OzoIwvePjfH0lF4EOE8v5w

2417329,2014-11-27,2,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Reviews look to be a bit all over the place for this establishment and I'm probably not about to convince the masses one way or the other being that three of us happened upon this place on accident and then ordered an appetizer and sandwiches, hardly running the gauntlet that the menu provides. But even with that chance encounter, that slight sampling of the items offered and the fact that we were in and out of here within an hour, Table 10 is still a hidden gem in a crowded pavilion of ""me too!"" eateries that do not give you as much flavor and freedom from the touristy masses.

Admittedly, our luck in Vegas seemed to be solely related to food as it was blind chance that took us here: we were shopping around The Venetian and The Palazzo, and because these centers seem like they were designed with the sole purpose of disorienting you despite you being completely sober, it was not long at all before we ended up at one end of the boutique shops and found this place sitting before us. It rests near the end of one side of The Palazzo storefronts and is kind of ordinary looking: a hostess desk outside (but still indoors) sits alongside a brief patio to the right, as well as in front of a theatre-in-the-round bar that has this spiral staircase in the center of it that is either a great decoration or ascends into the Batcave.

We were seated in a small dining room to the right adorned with metal fence work on the wall, and within minutes our waiter greeted us and took our drink order. This guy seemed to be fielding every table in every dining room, as it was not unusual to see him through the open windows tending to other guests on the patio. And yet, despite walking more miles in the hour we were there than most people walk in a week, the man kept the pace up and the satisfaction of all his tables equally high. He really did a stellar job with being attentive but not suffocating like an ex when it came to refills and when to order food.

And the food... I was still nursing the huge breakfast I had prior to this, so I opted for an appetizer of beef skewers. Sounds lame, maybe, but when those six skewers arrived, they smelled heavenly and tasted probably akin to what the gods are used to gorging on after a day of smiting. My folks went the sandwich route, going for the pork po boy (with molasses BBQ sauce!!!) and the ""perfect '10' BLT."" Dad had the po boy devoured, citing it as among the best he has ever had. The fries that came with it were decent, but really, when french fries are the least memorable part of your meal, that's a problem along the lines of not driving your third Ferrari because the color of the leather seats clashes with your sunglasses. What I'm saying is the po boy would have been the best item any of us ate if not for Mom's BLT.

By now, anyone over the age of 14 is sick of the Internet culture adopting bacon and ruining it by repeatedly bringing it up, much like zombies, cats and zombies playing with cats. But trust me when I say this bacon is worth the price of admission alone. Mom was gracious enough to spare a slab for both Dad and myself and I'm pretty sure I lost track of time and space while eating mine, like I was having an out-of-body experience without leaving the table. I guess the rest of the sandwich was good but hey, bacon that good is a tough act to follow.

Like I said, we were here for just an hour and had an appetizer and sandwiches. Not really the full Table 10 experience but in no way indicative of some of the disparaging reviews I see below mine. Give Table 10 a shot - it stands out by not trying to stand out, and that's worth a minimum of five stars in my book.",6MizZ9yqvVMfnlgpbaVeVw,4,4,5,8GxnBo5Id6PmkyhOwrd5fQ

Happened upon this restaurant when I was staying in the Palazzo for a convention.

My buddy and I decided to go for their TASTE OF TABLE 10 MENU. For $45 you get four courses.  You can add the optional wine pairing for an additional $28. (Um...No brainer.)  

1st course - Boston Lettuce Salad (windrose farms head lettuce - bacon - chive - buttermilk dressing - heirloom tomatoes) paired with the Banfi Chianti Classico
 
2nd course - SQUASH Gnudi - pecan - sage butter - romano cheese (a very well put together dish so much lighter than gnocchi that paired well with the pinot) Talbott ""Logan"" Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir.

3rd course - WAGYU SKIRT STEAK with potato pur√©e - spinach - red wine sauce paired with a Don Miguel Gascon Malbec.  (This dish was so luscious and melted in your mouth)

4th course - EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE
with chocolate shavings, caramel sauce and whipped cream and that was paired with (I believe) a late harvest Chardonnay.

With tip and some additional wine it came out to be less than $110 per person.

If you step away for the restroom, a waiter will surely scurry over to refold your napkin for you, and lay it neatly on the table. It is definitely what you pay for though, because the food is heftily priced.

My friend and I shared the ahi tuna salad, jambalaya, calamari, and mallasada dessert.

EVERYTHING was SOOO good. Like the waiter said, the calamari was the best he's ever had. I have to say I agree.

2650868,2013-07-01,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Emeril Lagasse's Table 10 is located at the Palazzo Hotel and Casino in Vegas and in my opinion it is his best. Its name is fitting because it Deserves a 10 on almost every level.  It is pricey but I had a twenty percent off voucher which helped to keep the dollar amount reasonable. We started with drinks and this was really the only part of the meal that could have been improved on. Simone had a Lychee martini and I went with a mojito. They were good but probably not much better then I could find at any bar anywhere at half the price.  For the meal itself Simone and I decided that we would share everything. When I let the server know this he was more then happy to bring us extra plates with each food item. While we waited for our first food items we enjoyed some great fluffy, buttery flaky dinner rolls. Then the appetizers arrived. First was the Grissini Bread sticks wrapped with Pancetta and glazed with Truffle butter. These were as amazing as they sounded. They were handmade in the kitchen and were thin crispy, salty and rich and highly addictive. Next up were grilled salt and pepper Pea pods. Slightly charred and salty sweet, they were drizzled with Olive Oil and Lemon Juice. Upscale finger food at its best, the only small issue I had was that some of the peas were more tender then others but the taste was spot on. Our last appetizer was the Candied Bacon. Hand cut thick strips of smoked pork belly with a sugary caramelized amber crust. These melted instantly in your mouth and were taken up another notch when drizzled with the maple butter then came along with them. For our shared entree we choose the Beer Glazed Duck Breast with Creole seasoned house sausage, hush puppies and lightly steamed Green Beans.  The meal came out on two plates already cut into two equal portions for us. I thought this was a real nice gesture from the kitchen and it was much appreciated as many restaurants don't like people sharing plates but Table 10 actually seems to encourage it.  The duck was the most tender I have ever had and it was cooked perfectly medium as I requested. The glaze was slightly sweet but not overpowering and the sides were equally as good especially when dragged through the glaze. Because we split our meals, we had plenty of room for dessert and so we had two. One was an Almond cake and the Other a Chocolate Mousse cake. The Chocolate cake was dark chocolate so it was not to sweet but was topped with raspberry sauce that made up for it and balanced it out. I enjoyed it, but my favorite was the Almond Cake. It was super moist and rich but was topped with a very light and refreshing homemade Basil sorbet to cut through the deep flavor of the almond.   This was a terrific end to a top notch foodie experience. This will be one of my Vegas Favorites for many years to come.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,6,2,5,5eV8IN-K4zoHJwuVr8Vgqg

The only good thing I have to say about my experience here is that the appetizers were incredible.  The service was quite slow, even though there were more servers than patrons.  There were 5 - 7 staff members chatting at the host station throughout the meal.  Its pretty bad when you have to interrupt their conversation to ask for water and silverware.

For my main course, I ordered a steak medium-rare and the potatoes with bacon.  The potatoes were just plain bad:  flavorless and runny.  
The steak was also a failure.  It was obviously not rested, as my plate was covered in blood as soon as I cut in to it.  The outside was charred and the inside was cold.  The steak had no flavor accept for the ashy taste of the grill marks.

The reason Table 10 gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that they took the steak off my bill (I had 2 bites and sent it back.)  The server asked if he could bring me something else, but my appetite was gone after that meal.

The presentation of the scallops was excellent. 

My fiance got the chicken. It did not look appetizing at all. It looked like an underfed chicken sprawled across veggies. He did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed mine. I guess that may be what you get for ordering ""chicken"" but I think chicken at chain restaurants is more appetizing so I would expect more from this establishment.

Oh, Emeril, I think I just fell in love with you.  Okay, maybe not you... but Table 10 is my new love in Vegas and I will be going back at first opportunity!

Here's how it all happened.  My dad is a Grazie gold member at the Venetian and they offered him dinner for two at Table 10 as a part of his offer this week.  He could care less about food so he sent my mom and I to dine like queens in his stead.  THANK YOU DAD!!!!  Apparently, this offer is for a specific menu and I believe that this menu is available to order from otherwise, too, because it said at the top $75 for two people.  It's your standard Prix Fixe with three choices for each: appetizer, entree, and dessert, but I'm kicking myself because I don't remember all of the options on it, just what I selected!

My mom and I both made the same selections and we started with a tomato and burrata salad - what is not to like?  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  They also brought out pillowy soft dinner rolls that were so warm and delicious!  Our entree was tournedos of beef served over a potato puree with broccoli.  The beef was cooked PERFECTLY.  I asked for horseradish because I love horseradish with my steak and it was spicy and delicious.  The broccoli was crisp and fresh and the potato puree silky and tasty. We were also brought more rolls, oh YUM! But, the star of the night?  The pistachio cheesecake.  This is literally one of the best desserts I've had.  EVER.   The cheesecake was pistachio flavored on a chocolate crust with  whole pistachios on the plate.  It was served with vanilla ice cream.  It was the PERFECT combination of sweet and salty, crunchy and creamy.  I'm actually in love with a dessert!

We also ordered glasses of pinot grigio.  It was nice.  My only complaint is that I didn't check in on Yelp until we left and that was when I found out I could have gotten a free glass of sangria from my Yelp check in, if I would have checked in right when we got there since we had arrived just before happy hour ended at 7!  Ah, next time.

Our server, whose name I do not recall - sorry, was awesome.  He was professional and attentive, but unobtrusive.  I felt well taken care of even though they knew we were there receiving the free dinner. Our water glasses were kept full and plates removed at the appropriate time and there were no lags between requests, deliveries, and clearing.  The service was outstanding.

Literally, I have NO complaints.  They even have their own restroom in the restaurant, which is unusual for a casino restaurant.  This was one of the nicest dinners I have enjoyed and I will highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks where they should eat in Las Vegas.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,2,0,5,jHd_axW6sPV_uNuQ7bWUeg

2807794,2016-01-04,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"Okay, my last lunch at Table 10 was probably 4 stars rather than 5.  But my 5 star rating is sort of a lifetime achievement award, based on many meals at Emeril's restaurants in New Orleans and Las Vegas.  In addition to his winning personality on TV, Emeril Lagasse is one hell of a restauranteur.  If you eat at any of Emeril's restaurants, you can count on a first class meal; and the prices are not too bad for a high end restaurant.

I think it's fair to judge Table 10 based on my overall affection for Emeril, because it is an overall showcase for his New Orleans cuisine.  At restaurants like this, I like to order several appetizers and small plates, rather than an entree.  I mean, look, a great steak is a great steak, and there are a lot of places to get one.  But if you want to enjoy Emeril's special talents, try a few things that you can't get at the steakhouse down the street.

For my last lunch I started with the bacon wrapped dates.  This seems to be a new in-fashion thing, as I just had the same dish down the street at Giada's.  The dates were great at both places, but I don't remember seeing dates on many menus over the last several years.  Plus ca change...  

Next I had the chicken and sausage gumbo.  Not astounding, but quite good.  Same for the lobster mac & cheese (which is a side dish).  My wife enjoyed her shrimp po' boy - a hefty sandwich which she could not finish at one sitting.

One bad point - Table 10 is buried in the maze of the ""canal"" shopping center between the 
Venetian and the Palazzo hotels.  As a place to wander and shop, the canal is pretty cool.  I remember liking it the first time I was there.  But if you are headed for a destination in there, it is a bit of a pain in the butt.  The place is designed to walk you past as many high-end stores as possible.  I'm not certain if there is a minotaur wandering around in there (it wouldn't surprise me), but the mythical labyrinth has nothing on the trek from the parking lot to Table 10, and has the advantage of avoiding the crowds.

Once you get to Table 10, though, the restaurant is comfortable and the service is friendly and attentive.  Except for the nagging thought that you are going to have to find your way back to the parking lot, with multiple wrong turns and elevator rides along the way, I think you will really enjoy your meal.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,5,XGLmu5WRprKMgz5XV7SYEg

I couldn't believe we were sitting there with an order of bacon (lol) but it really was sooo good!
 Next, we tried the mac n cheese with truffle oil Amazing... But I could be biased. I love anything truffle heehee. Next, we tried an order of the sausage & chicken gumbo It was good, but not nearly as mind blowing as the first 2 items.... But i could have just been too full  to fully appreciate it at thatoint. I also had a glass of wine, Which was very good, as they have an incredibe selection and a big beautiful wine cellar. Also,  we got to sit at the bar, which faced an open kitchen. It was really cool to be able to watch them cooking everything and the kitchen was spotless. We were able to see that the food got out really fast too, and was never lingering under heat lamps. The chef was a huge fan of our show, so it was nice to meet him too. We will definitely go back here next time we are in Vegas.

Can't comment on pricing because....well, I'm a girl, I don't pay and its rude to look at the bill if you're not going to pay it, so I don't.... But, judging from the menu, it seemed pretty average to me

(average for Vegas, that is)

After landing and settling at our Palazzo room, we came down here for dinner. One of the few restaurants I haven't gotten to try here at the Palazzo so decided to go here to knock it off. 

And let's just say I was fine with Table 10 not in my history of places i have eaten at. The appetizer was decent, nothing special. Lobster Mac n Cheese and their Caesar's Salad was good. 

Then came the main dishes... Oh boy... When the entrees of pasta came, I was over my dinner after 1 bite. My bolognese pasta was one of the most blandest, basic entree I ever had in life. The other pasta dish, shrimp pappardelle one of my friends got was even worse. How the hell are you going to be an Italian restaurant with shit pasta dishes?! And everything was way overpriced for the crap they dish out here.  I could have spent the fraction of the bill and had a better meal at an Olive's Garden.

The service was solid, but that doesn't make up for the food overall. No thank you, and Table 10 is on my shit list. Blah! Bye mediocrity! Bye Felicia!",qAgeGYO7RXc9YCbHOAE3-g,5,2,1,CBh1Sdg_alM0loPEfo0FvA

Why bittersweet?!   Table 10 is closing its doors sometime in January I believe.  Chef Richards has flawlessly executed another wonderful gastronomic adventure tonight.  Wonderful fall flavors fully representative of the Thanksgiving timeframe.   We enjoyed the Chef's Tasting and wholeheartedly encourage you to book now - right now- before they close to get a wonderful chef's tasting menu experience before this landmark within the Palazzo casino closes.   

I would come back for another dinner or two if I could!!!   The dinner was worthy of rechecking travel schedules to see if we can get back in town before year end.

Highlights of the dinner included a wonderful Asian fusion savory noodle dish with seared ahi, mushrooms and plenty of umami, an earthy squash/pumpkin risotto (think burgundy wine pairing), and a rabbit sage hazelnut dish for warm ups.   Once gametime hit - we enjoyed a....   Drumroll please...

A suvi 105 degree prepared ribeye cap unfurled and Rerolled with bacon, crab, mushrooms, served with asparagus.   More dessert (worthy of a separate review) than we could eat.

That alone makes the rating 3 stars. It was basic mac and cheese drowning in butter/chemically flavored truffle oil. The truffle oil left such a horrid aftertaste, we could not eat any more than one bite a piece. The cornbread, however, was quite good. It was our favorite thing we ordered. The strawberry salad we got was pretty basic and left me wanting more, as did the calamari. The other thing that was pretty enjoyable was the bacon wrapped dates. The burger we got was just a basic burger, and nothing special. The service here was fantastic, which made for a better experience. Overall, I will likely come back when I go to Vegas because of the cornbread. It was that good. As for the other food we tried? Not really.",3ySZDkok1bH7uP-r3by2Ww,1,1,3,hPD115p7RuE4ecGYv9RnCw

For my entree I had the mac and cheese and that was unfortunately a bit disappointing.

The rabbit gnocchi was AWESOME! Not gamey and pillows soft gnocchi which were what made the dish. The pork dumplings were really excellent.

We sat down and our waiter handed us menus and took drink orders. We settled in and ordered our food. I ordered oyster appetizers and the smoky mushroom pasta. My wife ordered the truffle mac and cheese with a side of grilled chicken on top. Others in our party also placed their orders. 


The appetizers quickly came out and we thought thinks would be good but things slowly went downhill from there. The oysters were delicious but a few were not shucked properly and I had to pick out broken shell pieces from my mouth. 

After the appetizers, we waited and waited for our main course. People at the table were starving from walking around all morning and started to fill up on bread because they were hungry. 

We looked around for our waiter to get refills on our water and drinks but could not find him. 

Finally after about 40 minutes our main course came out.  I must admit the smoky mushroom pasta was creamy and delicious. The mac and cheese was also on point but partway through eating the mac and cheese, we found a rare piece of chicken. We told a passing waitress about the rare chicken and she just said ""oh, want a replacement?""  We declined a replacement as my wife had lost her appetite at this point. They did however take the mac and cheese off the bill. 

Overall I would not recommend coming to this restaurant again. We noticed other tables came in after us, who ordered the same items as us receive their meals sooner and faster. We noticed the people serving us were more interested in chitchatting with each other then checking in with their table. 

Also serving rare chicken in a restaurant that is $$$ signs is not acceptable. The kitchen should have checked better before sending out rare chicken which could have made us sick.",6BcsgtfHRz_WpGihQD-TEA,4,1,2,BKvhd3_L7s7xKBj_7RU73Q

We went in just after 11 AM and were quickly seated. We started with the gumbo appetizer. Very nice. Well spiced with large pieces of chicken & andouille sausage in it. Good start. For lunch I had the Angus beef burger. Wow this was a massive burger. Perfectly cooked although the onion marmalade was a bit jarring because of the sweetness. My companion had the quiche souffle, a warm & soft pastry loaded with cheese and large bacon pieces. Outstanding. I know we were there early but the service was excellent.

The house wine they pour is a good quality wine. The service has always been amazing but more importantly the food was always perfect and delicious. Table Ten is one of several restaurants by Celebrity Chef Emeril Lagassi. Table 10 Serves New American Cuisine laced with some New Orleans and Asian Flavors.

Since my review many things have changed.

In the Palazzo they've done away with the escalator that brings people near Table 10 from the Venetian. According to my waiter this resulted in fewer customers.

Table 10 no longer offers the tasting menu.

They no longer serve hot rolls and butter.

Service is not as perfect. On my visit they only had one waiter with two helpers.

Now to the food.

My husband started with the Gumbo. According to my husband who enjoys gumbo the gumbo is still excellent and according to him is still the best gumbo outside New Orleans.

I had the Scottish Salmon over Red Quinoa with Beets and Spiced Apricots. I think my meal was made by someone who is learning how to cook. The salmon was cooked but had a grainy texture and included the bloodline and had soggy skin. It was edible after I removed the bloodline and soggy skin but something wasn't right about the texture. The Quinoa had nothing added to it and was just plain. Beets were ok but the apricots were awful. I couldn't eat them....I don't think they were made right. This was the first meal I ever had at Table 10 that I didn't enjoy.

Our waiter was very busy since he was the only one on. He ran by our table and asked my husband how his meal was and kept running.

2975910,2008-12-19,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"People, let's be fair with our reviews of Table 10.  I could have avoided this restaurant and hopefully would have countless others.  

Table 10 gets two stars only thanks to very good service and would receive one star merely on food.  We spent about $100 per head and would have preferred that we had just eaten sushi next door.  

The disappointments, in order, were were dry, old biscuits that should have been thrown out; a wedge salad that was swimming in watery dressing; sterile gumbo that Emeril's mother would smack him for serving; blackened mahi mahi that had very little flavor served over bland, soggy polenta; and finally cinnamon-sugar doughnuts (Malassadas) that were unfortunately recommended and had less taste and appeal than two-day old Dunkin Doughnut holes (ok, they may actually have been that old). 

There were only two bright spots from the food, the fried calamari had a light but flavorful batter and a soft texture and the lobster pot pie was fully of generous claw meat and crispy vegetables (the only crispy ones that were served).  My other compliment goes to the well trained staff who were friendly, attentive, and helpful.  If the dishes they recommended were this bad, I can only imagine what we missed.  

What is to be done with Table 10?  I hope close it down and send more business to the well-run establishments like Delmonicos and Fish House in Las Vegas.  I love NOLA (the hickory roasted duck may be the best in the country, better than Gary Danko here in SF) and Emeril's in New Orleans and know that there is a something there I can, or could, trust for well-seasoned, exciting, and fresh food with signature BAM!

2980558,2015-02-02,5,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"This is the third Emeril restaurant I've been to. As for Table 10, just don't. I wish I had trusted the Yelpers that left 2-3 stars at this place.

There'e a reason why you can find such a good deal on a meal here, and there's a reason why I never saw it full in the 4 days I was at the Venetian. While the atmosphere is lovely, the food is generic in flavor, mediocre in preparation, and inconsistent otherwise. Everything was either incredibly bland or so oversalted that I didn't want to eat it.

- Host stand - Nice greeting and very welcoming.
- Service - Good, though our server had no personality. When I asked her to pass onto the kitchen that they need to fix their crappy house bread, she was indifferent and clearly had no pride or concern about what the restaurant serves. ""No big deal, just here to collect a paycheck...""

- Bread - The worst house bread I've had on the strip. So bad I'm writing an entire paragraph on it. When the server puts it on your plate, you can hear it drop like a rock because it's so dense. Flavorless. (The biscuit for the BBQ shrimp is equally hard and dry.) Emeril, please just save your money and stop producing a house bread, or ask the staff to run down to Delmonico and produce double batches on behalf of Table 10.
- 4 for $45 Bibb salad- Wow. Not good ""wow,"" but bad ""wow."" This is the most flavorless salad I've had in recent years. Burned bacon, under-seasoned buttermilk dressing (tastes like nothing), 3 baby tomatoes, and lettuce.
- 4 for $45 BBQ shrimp- these were good. Keep in mind that the BBQ sauce is not the normal barbecue sauce you are thinking of. I can't really describe it, except it's savory and has rosemary. Avoid biscuit on this plate at all costs.
- Bone-in filet- Share food if you get this! It is at least 12 ounces and comes with carrots and onions. Tasted nice, but super salty dish.
- Au gratin potatoes- these were miserably salty. After one bite we left them alone.
- Truffled lobster mac and cheese- kind of disappointing. The portion is good, and there is plenty of lobster, but you can't taste the truffle even when you can see it.
- 4 for $45 skirt steak- this was cooked nicely and tasted great, though too salty. Served with the same carrots and onions as the filet.
- Banana cream pie- This is my second time eating Emeril's banana cream pie, first time having been in NOLA. Honestly, it's good, but it's not great. 

We were at Delmonico a few days prior, and that was a delicious restaurant. I would not come back to Table 10 because of how inconsistent the food was. You never knew if you would enjoy what was coming out of the kitchen next, and I'd rather gamble on blackjack than on eating here again.",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,5,3,2,nD8Bzdeu4iX_0RNnucDNgw
2983526,2011-02-16,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"3-4 stars

Reason for going: 
V-day dinner with the hubby... we usually don't go out on V-day because of the crowds but because it was a Monday... we figured it wouldn't be all that crowded... and we were right... it wasn't all that busy at 6:45pm.  This was our first visit to Table 10.

Location: 
One of Emeril's restaurants... this one is upstairs in the shopping area of The Palazzo next to Sushi Samba.

Ambiance: 3.5 stars better than 'OK' but not super great
Dark woods, low lighting, modern, but not kitchy. What I thought was a bit odd... not that their patrons look up much and stare at the ceiling... was that the ceiling was a wire/mesh where you could see through it to the pipes and ducts and stuff that run through the ceiling.  I thought it seemed a little too industrial in that respect.  But it did not detract from the meal or enjoying an evening out.

Bar Area: 4 stars for looking nice
Circular with tall, high-backed stools.  Looked like a cool place to hang out.  There were a few TVs so if you were in the mood to watch a game and chill.

Wine Menu: 4 stars for selection
Extensive.... Good selection of California, French and some Australian and South American wines.  Some are quite expensive and others are not so bad.  Figure 2x to 3x retail.
We enjoyed the Nickel and Nickel Truchard Vineyard Carneros Chardonnay.

Service: 4 stars
Attentive and nice, but nothing special.  They refilled our water and wine glasses without us asking.  

Bread: 3 stars
They serve each person one warm roll.... (not a basket)... so that was good so that you don't fill up on bread.  (I think you can ask for more... I did not.)  The roll was pretty good... but I would have preferred it a bit crustier on the outside... with the inside nice and soft just like it was.

Appetizer: 3 stars
Artichoke - crispy/fried... good ... not super spectacular but it was a nice appetizer to start off ... portion was good for 2 people.

Salad: 4 stars
I ordered the Spinach salad which came with goat cheese, roasted head of garlic, marinated red onion slices and a crostini.  I thought this was Excellent.  The spinach was super fresh and green... not wilted or brown.  The dressing was light and not too much.  The roasted garlic was messy to deal with because you had to pick the cloves out of the head... but I managed.  The red onion slices were on the sweet and tasty (and I don't like onions and normally don't even eat them).
The husband ordered the caprese salad which was presented very nicely.  I didn't try it but he said it was very good.

Main Entr√©e: 3 stars
I ordered the Diver Sea Scallops.  The description said it was served with a chimichurri sauce and that's why I ordered it.  Honestly... it was all butter..I didn't taste any chimichurri.  If you like butter... you'll love this dish.  To me, it was dripping in butter and everything tasted like butter.  I thought the scallops were well prepared and were moist and tender...not gritty at all like they sometimes can be.

The husband ordered the Fish of the Day - Salmon.  It was supposed to be served Med Rare... it came out more Med-Med Well.  I got a taste.... It was good but not something we'd order again.

Dessert: 2 stars
Bananas Foster - big disappointment.  
The server recommended this item saying it was the best thing on the menu... if that was the best... YIKES! Not only did they NOT do this table side .... The bananas weren't carmelized like I expected them to be.  And the rum sauce they poured over the bananas and ice cream was straight rum and sugar... way too sweet and overpowering. I personally like the BF at Ruth's Chris much better.... They do it table side and it's AWESOME there.

Overall:
I'll probably go back to have a drink and hang at the bar if I'm in the area... not sure that I'd go back for dinner again. Too many places in town to try.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,1,3,ySyI2yIfk0nrRfk62ChXIA

Dishes we tried:
Tomato Bisque: I hate tomato soup and this was amazing.

Gumbo: I can't really eat shellfish, but I tasted and it was great as well, i just swelled up a little afterward. WORTH IT.

Fillet: Had it medium rare with a side of mushrooms. The steak was cooked just as requested and tasted great. The mushrooms in wine were nothing special at all. It was just some craminis with wine. I've made the same dish home plenty of time. A spring of fresh thyme does not a fancy dish make.

Salmon: This was pretty unique and I liked it a lot. It was a grilled salmon on top of what I can only describe as a tortilla bed. Kinda different, good!

Lamb: Cooked to perfection

Coffee Cake: This was a great dessert, but it was the doughnut things that shined.

Doughnuts: I can only describe these as white chocolate filled chorro flavored doughnut holes with a icing. My brain exploded at this point.",xQSWsTybKUuP327fMjYqMg,1,0,5,4BMzBmU8KIC4MVsEqRN-OQ

Reservations are made for a reason (especially on a Saturday night), so that we have a table as soon as we get there.When I asked the seating hostess about our table, she just looked so annoyed and told me it would be ready soon. When we finally did sit down, it was a table all the way in the corner when there were plenty of other open ones. Out waitress was very sweet at first and immediately took our order with no problems. My friend and I both opted for the Piri Piri seafood pasta (one of Emiril's CLASSICS), but then decided that since we both wanted it, we'd just share it. We asked our waitress if she could split it for us and said it wouldn't be a problem. The bread and appitizer salads came out very quickly, but nobody came to clear the plates away when we were or refill our water (likely because we were at the table all the way in the corner).  When the food finally came,  30 mintues later, the waitress put down the pasta in front of me and a side dish for sharing. This is a pasta dish with seafood. You can't just hand me a side bread plate and then say split the pasta yourself. So I proceeded to ask the waitress if perhaps the chefs in the kitchen could split it for us in 2 seperate bowls(like I'd originally asked), especially since my friend and I were at opposite ends of the table. She looked at me like I'd asked her to do something unheard of and took the plate back to the kitchen. She returned with 2 seperate bowls 5 minutes later and angrily dropped them in front of us and walked away. When I thanked her, she just walked away. We were really disappointed with the service. We then told the manager what had happened and she offered us a free dessert which we did not want, so the agreed to comp the pasta dish. While that was very nice of the manager to do, we were still very disappointed with the service and ended up being late to our next engagement that evening.

The second course was the Mushroom ""Vol Au Vent"".  The mushrooms were placed on three pastry shell. The third course, Wagyu Skirt Steak on top of spinach, potato puree, and red wine sauce.  The steak was very tender and flavorful.

::Customer Service::
On point, polite, and attentive. 

::Rating::
The Taste of Table 10 Menu was not bad especially for their four-course menu for $45 and the serving size was generous.  After tasting all the food, I liked the Shrimp Bisque, Chicken + Andouille Sausage Gumbo, Emeril's New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, Candied North Country Farm Bacon, and the Wagyu Skirt Steak.  The customer service was also good.

3108595,2011-04-29,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"So we were going to Las Vegas and so we could eat some higher quality food.  I chose this Emeril restaurant specifically out of his other three restaurants in Vegas because it was the only one that listed Bananas Foster's as a dessert on his menu.  I love his Cajun recipes on Food Network so I figure this should be good.  I also read that this was an offshoot of his original restaurant in New Orleans- which I really want to try, so I came in with high expectations.   

To start, my husband ordered the bone marrow and brioche, and also the braised veal cheeks.  We got three bone marrow bones, but 1/3 was barely filled.  He said the bone marrow was good... but very very rich and he said he couldn't eat a lot of it because it was so heavy.   It was salty, but edible... but funny enough, they gave an additional container of sea salt?  I had the braised veal cheeks with some carrots and mushrooms.  It was good- still salty, but I liked it and probably enjoyed the sauce and mushrooms more than the actual meat.  

For our main entrees, husband ordered the suckling pig and a side of truffle mac and cheese.  I ordered the seasonal monkfish with a tartar sauce and fried vegetables.  The monkfish was just saut√©ed, but it was so incredibly salty that it was inedible.  Even tried to mellow it out with the tartar sauce, but it was still too salty that it numbed my tounge.  The vegetables were coated in tempura but it was so over fried it just tasted like salty popcorn.  Any taste and nutrients were fried out of the vegetables.  Husband said the pork was good... mildly salty but not anything to write home about.  He had to send back the truffle mac and cheese.  The macaroni was so overcooked it was like mush and grease.  There was no cheese, was flavorless, and it was like the macaroni was just tossed in truffle oil alone.  The breadcrumbs were just sprinkled on at the end, and were not baked.  

Finally, I got my long awaited bananas foster, which I was waiting for.  They brought out a plate with a scoop of ice-cream and 2 fried bananas split lengthwise.  The server poured the sauce on top, tableside.  The sauce was completely separated.  The liquid was as dark as soy sauce and sank to the bottom.  There was a clear liquid sitting on top (presumably straight liquor), at least  1/2 an inch deep.  I took one scoop out of it and it was so incredibly bitter.  The fluid was watery. It was as if the liquid hadn't been flamb√©ed at all.  It should have been a caramel color and it should have thickened slightly because it was combined with sugar.  I guess I could have just eaten the ice cream alone but what was the point?  I wanted bananas and sauce.  To give the waiter some credit, he did waive the items we did not like, but I expected more.  So in summary, I had high expectations of Emeril, but was really disappointed and let down.  Everything was excessively salty.  I guess it's down to the actual chef executing it on the night of, but Emeril really needs to go in there and spend some time QA'ing the dishes that have his name on it.

P.S. I would have given a 2 because the service was alright, but the following days, my husband's stomach was not right and he was sick for days after the excessive amounts of grease from the bone marrow.",tCmtxxZMGWaweEosIGzsdg,0,0,1,ZpjntwDj6m24RXoPtJAFFQ

I had the gumbo and although it was salty it lacked any real depth or flavour to it despite the sausage so I couldn't even finish it. This was Followed by the roast chicken which was also ok. The best part were the little gnocchi accompaniments and even then it was only ok.

My partner had the salad and burger and both were bland and the sweet bread the gave us a starter was really strange.

3126926,2012-07-10,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"My husband and I ended up at Table 10 by chance while wondering around the Palazzo trying to find a place for dinner.  The good news is that most people eat dinner super late on the strip, so we had no trouble getting a table at a normal dinner hour (around 6:00 P.M.).

Service was a bit slow at first but then got better.  They were not busy, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  I'd say we waited a good ten minutes to order drinks.  After that there was a dramatic improvement.

I have mixed reviews to offer on the food.  I expected a better cocktail sauce to be served with the oysters.  In fact, we had much better oysters at a more reasonable price the next day at the Palace (right off the strip).  My husband's salmon was out of this world excellent--the best I've ever tasted.  On the other hand, my gumbo was nothing special.  That disappointed me, because of Emeri'ls BAM thing.  My gumbo definitely lacked the BAM factor.  Thankfully, I was saved by dessert.  We ordered and scarfed down the White Chocolate Malassadas, which are little donuts with white chocolate on the inside and cinnamon sprinkled on the outside.  Oh . . . my . . .God!!!!  Yes, they were THAT good.",8GlLooElGwaL0WNkunHgvw,0,0,4,hEvb9ulvdXwg3fQP3StOMg

And at Table 10 it is excellent in every sense. The service obviously is very friendly and professional. Very nice bar and great selection of drinks. The food is great of course and even more surprising to me were how amazing and creative the appetizers were. I got some varieties of cold crab on a small dish, with a great aioli sauce. But the presentation was amazing, I wanted to take a picture. The fillet steaks we got were cooked to perfection and beautifully prepared in a large, clean, kinda open aired kitchen where you can watch the chefs do their magic.

The candied bacon was a great novelty and I would recommend it. Beet salad was light and fresh.... not off the hook, but good. Loved the pistachios. Butternut squash lacked flavor and was rather doughy. Short Ribs were very good with a nice sauce and what appeared to be a sweet potato pur√©e. The salmon with couscous was bland and undercooked. Trust me, we love sashimi and sushi. The entire dish lacked any flavor. My wife ate about a fourth of it. Believing that a restaurant can only improve if you are honest when they ask you how the food is, we let our server know when she asked. She offered to bring something else, we declined. Taking it off of the bill would have been the right move. The puff pastry filled with white chocolate and a wonderful dipping sauce, was great. All in all, come here for the bacon and the desert.

We were going to dine at Sushi Samba, but wanted to check out this place across the way.  We thought the items and menu prices were reasonable and decided to give it a try.  We each ordered the Cactus Rose Martini off the drink menu and when we took our first sips, we were surprised how good this was.  Very fruity, light and refreshing.  Could barely taste the alcohol, but knew it was there because I could feel it a few sips in.   

For our main course, she had the Cordon Blue pasta, which was surprisingly good.  I had the Special, which was a petit filet mignon, small lobster tail, and included mashed potates with a light wine sauce with pieces of chorizo sausage.  Though the filet and lobster was a bit undersized, it still tasted great and I wasn't overly stuffed at the end.  The chorizo sausages in the mashed potatoes was a plus as it added a different change of flavors as I was plowing through the spuds.  Service was exceptional as our waiter was very attentive and the busser was refilling our waters at every chance.

3211047,2009-09-03,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"We had 5 pm reservations because we had a 7 pm show to make at the Wynn. We let the waitress know and she was really good at keeping us on track and we made our show on time. Also, there were way too many people waiting on us than necessary. That said, I was really worried that the food might be crappy because we were on a rushed schedule. I was wrong! 

Appetizers: We ordered crab cakes and calamari. The calamari was good, but we were wondering where the sauce was till the waitress noticed, and brought it. By then we were ready for our main course and they were about 2 min away. The crab cakes were good, but you have to avoid the cream sauce surrounding it. The sauce just made the crab cake too heavy. 

Main course: Everyone loved their food. It was a table for 11, so we got a little of everything. I'll try to rehash what I can remember. 

When the food came out, I thought they looked a little small, but I didn't even finish my food! I had the Creole Spiced Mahi Mahi. Sooo good. The chorizo was a little too spicy, and I usually have a pretty good tolerance. Another girl at the table ordered the lobster dome, and it was good, but the cream tends to become too much after a while. Scallops were fantastic, no complaints there. The bone-in strip was cooked perfectly. The lemon & herb chicken was really good and the gnocci was delicious with the sweet corn. The duckling was huge, and fantastic. Slightly sweet but played off the marinade. The butternut squash reminded me of sweet potato fries. 

Oh also, we got in just in time for the end of happy hour. Everyone loved the mojitos. Can't taste the rum, and the mint wasn't over powering. Some of us (ok, me) were double fisting.

The bread was I think the most delicious part of our meal. It was like a brioche with a salt herb crust line across, served warm.
The gumbo was tasty and rich, and they let us split it.
I ordered the scallops as an entree - it was very good. T hated his crawfish boil pasta - which was ok - but underwhelming for what we thought an Emeril dish should taste like. He's a dude and not a foodie and he didn't think much of it. He didn't even eat half of it. The truffle mac and cheese was meh - maybe it was the penne when we expected macaroni - shape matters.

The service was excellent - the bartender was very busy covering all of the bar patrons as well as the people at the lounge tables eating dinner, and he still managed to be very attentive and made sure I was taken care of. 

The major disappointment, however, was the food. I had the hush puppies, which were good, but I did not care for the tomato chutney they came with. The corn chowder was delicious, and that was definitely the saving grace of the meal. I ordered a salad from the specials that had mixed greens, tomato, crab, and some kind of cheese. It was not good. The dressing tasted like plain mayonnaise, and the lettuce did not taste fresh. The crab was also poached, which I didn't remember reading in the menu, because I probably would not have ordered it. Luckily the chowder filled me up, because I honestly could not eat more than a handful of bites of this salad. How do you mess up a salad??

The bartender noticed that I did not eat much of my salad, and when I told him I hadn't enjoyed it, he took it off my bill! That was awesome and totally unexpected.

I walked in at 7pm on Sat and the place is almost empty (should had taken that as a red flag).  The waitress was nice, but not with an enthusiastic personality you would expect from a celebrity chef's restaurant.  My friends and I pick a few dishes to share.  First disappointment, my friend's lobster bisque soup was lukewarm and watery.  Next the prosciutto pizza (I believe, from the daily special) is quite mediocre and was soaked with oil.  The deal killer, a white fish dish (I forgot what it was, also from the daily special), was completely overcooked as if it sat under a heat lamp for hours.  That dish makes me write this review as I have never seen such poorly executed dish at any restaurant let alone from a big-name restaurant like this.  I surprise the restaurant's kitchen manager even let that dish get out of the kitchen.  To me, if you server a very badly badly overcooked white fish in such restaurant, the kitchen manager might as well go work in a fast food restaurant.  Our last dish, braised veal cheeks, while more flavorful than previous dishes, was so salty that none of us could take a second bite.

Broccoli cheese soup was well seasoned and flavorful, and had tempura broccoli in the middle for extra flavor and a little crunch. Crab cake was well cooked and flavorful with a sweet aioli. The real star was the filet. Perfect char on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside, and bursting with flavor. My husband ordered the golden seared scallops (which were also very good) and wished he had ordered the filet. My only disappointment (and the reason I took away half a star) was the dessert. We took the server's recommendation and ordered the banana cream pie. The bananas were definitely not fresh,  and were browned and squishy.

There were only four pieces of jumbo shrimp though. Uh oh...still hungry? Fortunately, the appetizer was the beef carpaccio, which was served with truffle toast. That was good. The bread brought to our table was deliciously soft and squishy with butter. That helped a bit too.

Service was good and the prices are reasonable for Vegas. Don't forget to check-in on Yelp to receive a complimentary glass of Emeril's seasonal fruit sangria!",rl64kysIAlSg7zwCvGzjzw,2,2,3,6c--hwqSMt0Weyqkc5IGtQ
3295188,2011-08-02,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"""Wow"" is all I have to say for the mind-blowing shitty experience I had at Table 10 this weekend. I thought that Emeril was supposed to be great. What a huge huge disappointment.

My friend and I had a reservation at 7 and it was dead, so we at least figured the service would be great. Wrong. At times it seemed like our server was actually avoiding us on purpose. She was rude and condescending, especially to her assistant server (who was actually nice).

I started with the poached egg/frisee salad. The dressing was extremely salty, but the egg balanced it out a bit. My friend ordered the famous gumbo which looked and tasted very much like it came out of a Campbell's can.
For my main I had the special of the day, a blue cheese encrusted steak, with grilled shrimp. I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it came out beyond well done. The shrimp were rancid. Yuck!!!! When the floor manager came over to ask how my food was and I told him he didn't even offer to get me something else! Just took my plate away and brought me back a bread plate and a basket of bread. WTF??

I hate to be one of those picky diners but the whole dinner was really a nightmare. And I could not help but notice how many other tables around me (as the restaurant filled up) were sending back their dinners too.

Dessert was probably the best part of the whole meal. My friend had a delicious Frangelico creme brulee, and I had the white chocolate malasadas. Though I was more than surprised when we didn't get at least one of those comped.

(Do not go to this restaurant with the expectation that ""It's Emeril so it must be great.""  Emeril isn't actually the one cooking.  Unfortunately.)

Service and ambiance were good.

My wife and I each ordered the Pick-4.  For the first course, I ordered the BBQ shrimp, which were undercooked and had an unpleasant taint to the flavor.  (Sort of a gritty, dirty taste.)  My wife had the tomato salad.  She liked it.

For the second course, I had the gumbo, which was quite good.  It made me happy I tried it, but didn't make me want to get it again in the future.  My wife had the candied bacon.  It was excellent.  But then again, it was bacon.  How could it not be excellent?  Even still, you should definitely get the bacon if you come here.

For the third course, I had the chicken.  It was a bit overcooked and dry, but was otherwise fine chicken. My wife had the filet, which she had ordered medium and which came out rare.  The crust was overly charred.  Between the excess char and the rare inside, my wife only ate about half her steak.  (I tried a bite, and I probably would have sent it back.  My wife was more forgiving.)

Dessert was very good.  I had the banana cream pie, which was outstanding.  My wife had the dense chocolate cake, which she liked.  But she did end up eating more of my banana cream pie than her chocolate cake, and she's a chocolate freak, so that tells you something.

Overall, it was a nice dinner, and the price was fine for two solid four-course meals.  A couple elements were spectacular, several were fine, and a couple were quite disappointing.

Table 10 is a unique style.  It's supposed to be somewhat of a fine-dining place, hence the location in the Palazzo Hotel in the shoppes, but at the same time it's supposed to be casual dining as well.  

The prices aren't as high as Emril's other fine dining places such as Delmonico's but of course not as low as fast food like in n out. *chuckles*

After my friends went to go see Jersey Boys, we met them up here for dinner around 9:45.  The close at 10 but the gladly welcomed us in.  

First the bread came out and the rolls were warm and soft!  Very yummy!

We started off with the calamari which was pretty good but I've had better.  The parsley lemon aioli was  pretty tasty.  

We also got to sample the tuna tartar since they heard it was my friend's 25th birthday!  That was really good too!

My boyfriend and I shared the duck which was marinated in coca cola for 4 days and after it was prepared and it created a nice glaze that made the skin so crispy!  It was by far the best duck I've had!!  The portion was so much that my boyfriend and I had split that dish and we both didn't finish!

As for sides, we got the baked truffle mac and cheese! Delicious!

The mashed potato!  The best also that I've ever had! So creamy!

The frites - this I can totally pass on!!

3378469,2011-07-23,3,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"This morning when I found out that there were four Emeril Lagasse restaurants in Las Vegas, I almost had to bathe twice! I always loved watching Emeril on television, and Table 10 was my ticket to actually taste his food. BAM!

First of all, if you have any children two years old or younger that can't sit still, avoid bringing them to Table 10. While the prices, in my opinion, aren't that steep, this is a celebrity restaurant, dude! Would you bring a mentally unstable baboon to a fancy Jewish wedding? Please note : I'm not calling anyone's child (including my own) a mentally unstable baboon, and my child is not going to a fancy Jewish wedding.

The service was great (very attentive and properly mannered staff), the joint was spotless, and the food was borderline bodacious. My party of three went for lunch on a Friday, and we had no wait and a near empty dining room waiting for us. For just under 45 dollars (not including tip) we got a few complimentary bread rolls, a small pizza, pork po' boy with fries, and a Prosciutto Panini with a side salad. The six glasses of tap water I had were exceptional as well. Unlike the water they have on tap in New Orleans. 

I have not done the research, but even though Table 10 bears Emeril's name, I wouldn't doubt if the man himself hasn't even broken wind in his own restaurant. Hell, I'm just guessing, but Emeril Lagasse probably didn't even create the menu. Hey.... LEAVE THE GUY ALONE! HE'S A BUSY MAN CHOWING DOWN LOTS OF TASTY EATS AND SELLING FOOD ACCESSORIES ON TV! 

Even if Emeril had little to do with Table 10, I am proud to say that I ate at one of my favorite celebrity chef's restaurants. With the exception of an odd tasting pizza for an appetizer, Table 10 was a pleasant experience. When I go to Mc Donalds tomorrow (and three times a week for the rest of my life. I'm not proud of that.), I'm going to pretend my Mc Double is a Slow Cooked Pork Po' Boy from Table 10.",kKbGPQ1Cn-6J1XRkdA50Uw,0,2,4,gx4bscWidLU-whJXGaVPGA

With no reservation, we were ready for a dinner on a whim. We decided to pick Emeril Lagasse's latest venture, Table 10, billed as an ode to his humble beginning with a menu that leans towards the comfort food side of cuisine. 

We were seated presently on a Friday night and were immediately wow'ed by the stylish decor and attentive friendly service. But it was the food that upstaged everything. I had the finest grilled shrimp I've ever tasted, and the small filet and mashed potatoes were perfection. My love had pork tenderloin which was just outstanding. The food was rich and perfectly flavored, the kitchen quick but not rushed and the prices fair.. 

Really, it couldn't have been a better surprise. 

TIP: If you're single, they have a table bar at the rear of the restaurant that overlooks the sparkling kitchen. Would be a fun place to see the chef's at work.",BgZwJBhVWKq1Urs4rKBdiA,2,1,5,NL_FOdIGQyYdeUu-cEYvaA

Bread: it was delicious! I think the top was slightly salted and its warm because they bring it to you directly from inside (?) so every time you finish your bread, they'll bring you another hot ONE. Not a basket where the bread will get cold, but one. =)

Crispy Calamari (appetizer): it came with 2 dipping sauces. I forgot what they were but I absolutely LOVED one of them and hated the other. haha I like that the ""crispy"" calamari was soft, not too crispy. I think because of that, my bf wasn't as into it as I was. And it was a bit salty but I love salty food so it was perfect for me. 

Grilled Dry Aged 1855 Angus Rib Eye (my entree): I was very happy with this. I ordered it medium well and it was perfectly slightly pink. The grilled flavor was perfect especially with a slice of butter already melted on top. It wasn't tender but I wasn't really expecting that. My bf was surprised that I liked it because I tend to like food with rich flavors like with sauces and what not. 

Pasta Jambalaya (bf's entree): bf wasn't too happy with his jambalaya because he thought the flavor was too ""fishy"" probably from the shrimp. And he's very sensitive to that. I didn't taste it though because I couldn't even finish my own food!

Fruit on the Bottom Lemon Creme Brulee (dessert): we are such creme brulee lovers and wow. This one was spectacular. I really like lemons too so the combination was great. I think the lemon flavor brought out the lightness of the creme brulee. On the bottom were blueberries. They were really sweet so combined it was a light yet fruity sweet (not sugar sweet) tasting creme brulee. mMmMMmm bf said that the creme brulee was the highlight of the meal for him. =)

What made this experience even better that the service was excellent. My bf had ordered a half size wine bottle and they would constantly come and fill his cup to a certain amount after he takes like one sip. Our glasses of water were constantly refilled as well. And I like how they make a big deal out of presenting the entrees to the table at once so that we both get our food in front of us at the same exact time. They were very friendly and attentive. Great service!

3395917,2015-03-21,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"One of the WORST dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas, and this restaurant gives Emeril Lagasse a bad name. Hopefully things have improved since I dined here over 9 months ago (June 2014). My friend made reservations a few weeks ahead of time for her Bachelorette Party dinner (6:30pm on a Friday), and our table was ready upon arrival. The restaurant wasn't that busy at that time, but they ended up seating another large party at the table right next to ours, so it got pretty loud and difficult to talk. Also, our food took forever to come, and even though the other table sat down after us, they got their main dishes first. We had to follow up with our servers a couple of times to ask where our food was, which was super annoying. We tried:

-Complimentary Roll (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg&select=lOFU-u16Qf-At8sFyb-c7w): Good, especially with extra butter.
-Candied North Country Farm Bacon ($10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug#aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug): Yum, this was probably my favorite dish of the night, and a must order for any bacon lover.
-Truffle + Lobster Mac-n-Cheese (Trio of Cheeses, Real Truffle, Lobster, $19, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug#QtqUtF_UXKbrH7-6ZcINRA): Just ok- I was definitely disappointed since this is supposed to be one of their ""signature"" dishes. The mac n cheese was bland, and although you could see the pieces of lobster, you couldn't taste it. Skip!
-Sriracha Chicken Wings (Cucumber Buttermilk-Pickled Vegetables, $13, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug#2H8xRZiBNIxFBqub3UbYqQ): The flavor was ok, but some pieces were straight up RAW in the middle. Since we had to leave at a certain time and our food took so long to arrive, I ended up just cancelling this order. We barely got a apology (the server didn't even seem concerned) but at least they took it off our bill. Skip!
-Emeril's Banana Cream Pie (w/Chocolate Shavings, Caramel Sauce, Whipped Cream, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=_WXrRH36kqd_URMZIKVJPA#_WXrRH36kqd_URMZIKVJPA): Pretty good. This was a big portion, and you got a good amount of bananas, but I wished there was a bit more whipped cream.

Overall, the food was way below par of the other Emeril restaurant I've been to (Delmonico's in New Orleans), as was the service. The servers were all flocking to the other table with the large party next to ours, and we were sure it was because they were ordering a lot of alcohol than our table. I think the manager came by at one point to talk to the other table and chomp it up (I saw his title on his nametag) and our table just got a short ""Hope you're having a good meal"" sorta thing. I hope they improve their food quality and service soon, since there are plenty of other nice restaurants in Las Vegas to dine at.

Crab cakes: This was okay.  Way too much breading which made it mushy.
Bbq shrimp: Emeril's signature dish is usually pretty consistent.  While this was good, they ALWAYS overdo it with the salt.  I'm beginning to think that it's just what the recipe calls for...pounds of salt.  
Chicken and sausage gumbo: Meh.  Even my own gumbo puts this one to shame.

We arrived 15 minutes or so past our reservation but it was no problem. We were seated immediately to our table. 

The ambiance was light and calming. Their menu had a great selection and I had no problem selecting my entree. I ordered the Boneless Beef Short Ribs (sweet potato puree - cabbage au caramel - roasted garlic). The meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. I loved the sweet potato puree that the short ribs sat on top of. It was the perfect combination!

We also started with the Sriracha Chicken Wings. It came with a cucumber buttermilk sauce, which was kind of refreshing when dipped on the chicken wings. I would definitely order this appetizer again. 

One of my friends ordered the Kurobuta Pork Rack (rotisserie roasted rack - Weiser Farm carrots - roasted garlic sauce - Anson Mills grits). When the waitress said it was HUGE, she was not lying. It can definitely feed 2. The pork was also tender and went perfectly with the accompanied sauce. 

I normally love to order Linguine + Clams (manila clams - NCF bacon - broccolini - chili flakes - garlic - white wine sauce) but I knew I wanted a meat dish. My sister ordered this but she couldn't even finish it. The white wine sauce was a great pairing and it was not overwhelming.

Did the staff make up for the chefs failings? Our waiter never bothered to ask how out food tasted. Clearly my husband and I ate hardly any of the 2nd or 3rd courses. Yet, as they took our plates away, there was no notice or care.

The food is decent for the price it is offered at. Plates are about $40-50 a person and sides come out to be around $10-20. We ordered the salt and pepper sea bass, lamb shank with pumpkin risotto, and dry aged rib eye. For a side, we went with the lobster mac and cheese.

There was a mixup in the kitchen, and the manager came to apologize for the long wait. To make up for it, he offered a couple of appetizers to keep our stomachs happy: a dungeness crab salad and grissini wrapped with prosciutto. Both were above my expectations and very delicious. I would order both the next time i'm here.

When our entrees did make the table, we shared a bite of each dish and all agreed that the lamb shank was definitely the favorite. The meat fell off the bone easily like butter and the roasted garlic on the side intensified the flavors. The sea bass and brocolini were delicious as well. Being a steak-fan, there was nothing memorable about the rib-eye. However it was cooked perfectly and there was a nice crispy and butterfly crust. The lobster mac and cheese put a smile on all our faces as we tasted it. It came baked with a baked crust with large pieces of lobster floating in the creamy sauce.

Overall I would come back again. The service is great, the people are friendly and the food was affordable and delicious. Though the food did come out late, the service made up for it with a smile, nice conversation and a couple of free appetizers.

3583850,2010-09-07,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"My wife and I went there for our anniversary (reservation through opentable), and it was very pleasing.

First of all I have to give credit to their service, they obviously paid attention to details.  The reception greeted us and said happy anniversary, and so were the two main waiters who served us.  That by itself, is very important.  They also gave us a few bite-size appetizer and lighted a candle on our dessert, it's all those details that made the experience special.

We also enjoyed the food very much.  We ordered the cream corn potato soup, it's very creamy and smooth, but what I liked was that it's not too rich.  Although I would prefer it to have a little bit more salt and maybe stronger bacon taste.

We also got the escargots as appetizer.  Wow, this was REALLY good!  Cooked pretty differently as well, with some kind of white sauce.  The mushroom was very tasty.  The overall dish was just very pronounced and special.  Loved it.  But again, could have used a little bit more salt.

Before I forgot, I also want to mention we loved the bread.  It's very different, a little bit sour, but so warm and so soft, it was heavenly!  If we really have to pick on it, it would be the fact that they serve the bread one by one.  So you will have to keep asking them for more.  

For entree, my wife got the salmon with vegetable.  Because she's pregnant she decided to get the salmon medium well, but they did recommend medium.  It came out a bit dry as expected (no choice), but the sauce was very good.  My wife still enjoyed the dish a lot and said if she got the medium, it would have been perfect.

I got the buffalo with red wine glaze dish together with potato gratin.  They recommended medium or medium-rare and i opted for medium rare.  Thank god I did that.  The meat is so lean, anything more than medium rare I think is too dry already.  Very very different dish, it's not for everyone coz' it has very strong smell (much stronger than lamb), but it was great experience.  The red wine glaze was very good, works very well with the buffalo.  The potato gratin was perfect.

For dessert, we got the chocolate cake with raspberry sorbet, we both loved it.  The sorbet was some of the better ones we have had, not over powering, and together with the sweetness of the chocolate cake, they paired up very well!

The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, we got seated in a pretty quiet area, but with some open seating, you can have big parties and still work very well.

Overall we enjoyed our anniversary dinner very much, and given how diversified their dishes are, I am not surprised if we will come back soon again!",NF79y4GTgK89BSE1HhR4TQ,0,0,4,1O78KS0lzJMY788AHk32gg

had the Seafood Creole Bouillabaisse that had so much green pepper that it overpowered the dish and there was no rich sauce to sop up with the Chipotle Aioli Crostini. The Crostini had a very nice smokey flavor. 
The dish has a few little crawfish some very white Calamari and two Baja Shrimp. Well let me tell you, I had to cut it up the Shrimp into small pieces to savior the taste. It seemed to be grilled and then added into the dish, which means it maintained its grilled crunch and the sweet flavor. 
The bad news is that the total dish lacked seasoning. No wonder there are salt & pepper mills on the table. Without that there would be no flavor. 
My party had Creole Crawfish Boil, Shrimp Pasta and Pork Tenderloin. All of which had the rest of the party asking for another black pepper mill. The pepper ran out. Dishes are small except for the pasta dish and the side of Mac & Cheese a bit to runny for me. 
Needless to say we didn't stay for desert. 
I did have a glass of wine at the bar $5.00 (Happy Hour) before dinner that was a good deal. For dinner with a Cajun/Creole punch, go somewhere else.

We had dinner for 4 I only tasted a couple of the items so I will only rate those which I tasted. 

Roasted Beef Marrow Bones - I know that bone marrow is always rich but the one at Table 10 is extremely rich I believe because it comes with toasted brioche which is also buttered I think the combination of both just makes it a tad overwhelming for me. I have had it at other places before such as Charlie Palmer in Costa Mesa and it didn't taste overwhelming like that at all. The sea salt does cut the richness but this dish isn't for everyone that is for sure. Proceed with caution. 

Dungeness Crab Salad - This dish is basically a ramekin of crab meat with some greens on top and vinaigrette surrounding it. They do give you a good amount of crab meat which is always good. It was a tad over salted and I am a sodium monster so if it's salty for me then I have a feeling it is over salted. 

Porchetta - I must say this dish is good. The pork is very tender and the veggies that it comes with are beyond tender I had to look twice and see they were baby carrots! I would definitely recommend this dish. 

Lobster Mac - n- Cheese - must order. very good!

Dessert :

creme brulee - very good really enjoyed the hazelnut crust underneath pleasant surprise.

flourless chocolate cake - was okay.. tasted like a brownie more than anything. I have tasted better. 

There was also an Ice cream cookie selection - it was good but VERY rich and decadent proceed with caution for sure! covered in chocolate syrup!

Oysters on shell - love its special cucumber sauce, very light and fresh

Mushroom truffle soup - really tasty and creamy with lots of truffle flavor

Beets arugula salad - very fresh with just right amount of fruity dressing

Beef cheek - it was well braised with balance of sweetness and savory 

Beef tartar - I was quiet disappointed on this one. I felt it was less seasoned

Our waiter was very prompt and attentive, and even the gentleman refilling water was kind and personable. The delivered fresh baked rolls which were nothing special. My friend got caught in the mac & cheese trap, too, but he ordered the version with lobster.

We were both totally underwhelmed. It was just some penne noodles in a cream based sauce, with some breadcrumbs trying to dress it up. I could see bits of truffle, but it added nothing to the taste. I had to pepper the crap out of it trying to make it taste like much of anything.

3753527,2017-06-08,2,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"This place is awesome. We had been wanting to try Emeril's restaurants for a long time and finally decided to do it this vegas visit. Table 10 was very delicious. Not really sure why others have given the restaurant such a poor rating.

The backstory:
We decided to take ourselves on a tasty vegas food tour thinking mainly we could do a better job, with better company, then paying $125-200 per person for a guided foodie tour.  Upon researching, we decided to do the celebrity chef tour for ourselves and this was our first stop. Thus, we ordered mainly from the appetizers/snacks menu. 

The best items were the lovely pillowy rabbit gnocchi and the shrimp dip which was cheesy and just plain awesome. We tried the pork dumplings which were also great. The New Orleans style shrimp were very good and perhaps better than the ones we tried at the French market in New Orleans (¬ømaybe, but the setting of New Orleans might have given the edge to the original?). The gumbo was okay but definitely non competitive with the original in NOLA but still very good in my opinion. The bacon wrapped dates, unusual, my first time trying this devil's on horseback I think they call it. Tastes interesting is all I can say, took the blue cheese off and that improved the taste for me. Finally, the sole disappointing item, banana cream pie, custard tasted buttery, like overturned ice cream, no good. I was a bit saddened by that because having seen Emeril make that dish on his show when I was younger, I just knew it would be awesome, and, it was just okay. 

Nevertheless, I so enjoyed myself at the first stop of the self guided food tour. Food for rhe most part was awesome and the company was magnificent. Plus, got out of their at $90+tip so we are still coming out on top in my book. Next stop, Mario Batalli's Carnevino.",tRIHlMbHe4Hsg-ubVLg8Ow,3,3,5,czkqF1g2I-vTVNusYbvqhw

Decor: Interior decor was nice,  had a modern steakhouse feel to it with an illuminated bar.  Our table was actually outside on the indoor ""terrace"" meaning we got a chance to people watch people walking through the casino.  Although the tables inside were made of wood, our table outside was made of copper and I could smell copper throughout our whole dinner experience so that did put a damper on the dining experience (I would recommend a seat inside the restaurant).

Food: The food is upscale big easy Louisiana inspired seafood. We had a sampling of pretty much the entire menu: creole mahi mahi, seafood jambalaya, halibut, lobster pot pie, calamari, lobster mac & cheese, and crab beignets.  The food was o.k., nothing to rave about on the car ride back to Los Angeles that's for sure and I love Cajon/Creole food. The lobster mac & cheese sounded so good (I'm a huge fan of cheese) but it was actually a little too cheesy and salty.  The two pretty decent dishes were the seafood jambalaya and the lobster pot pie which was pretty creative but at $38 an entree, it should be creative!

Our waiter was a little off, but I'm giving him a pass because the rest of the experience was great. Maybe he had a tough night or something, but we were there for lunch and not sure he wanted to be. That being said, onto the food.

We decided to go family style and ordered a few of the New Orleans Fried Shrimp po'Boy's ($16). They were quite tasty the shrimp was fried to perfection, with a wonderful Creole mayonnaise, very similar to Lagasse's Stadium, but even better. They were also served with tasty, fresh cut fries that were devoured quite quickly.

We also got the La Quercia Prosciutto Panino ($15). It contained mozzarella, roasted heirloom tomatoes, balsamic vinaigrette and a garden green salad. It was a very tasty sandwich, think high caliber grilled cheese with tomatoes. It would've been nice if the tomatoes were chopped as I felt it needed a little more consistency throughout the sandwich. Quite tasty though. The salad was extremely fresh and tasty. 

The last shared item was the Kurobuta Baby Back Rotisserie Ribs with a pickled corn salad ($25). There was enough for the whole table to eat. It was a huge portion. The ribs had a great sweetness to them that worked perfectly. It was a whole rack, and the meat just fell off the bone.

One app came out over cooked, and they did return it and bring out a re-fired one quickly and without attitude.

Both of us also had the signature gumbo-and while the flavor profile was right, as Emeril himself would say-it needed to be kicked up a couple of notches.  Overall, it was bland.

The signature banana cream pie was huge and good, the bananas foster was served de-construcred and the flavors never really came together.

Overall-the food and service were OK, but you would expect more from Emeril's place.",nzw2dMshuQ4FbfA2GIZmWQ,0,0,3,NjlT7XIlPCGAi1uR6ZzfSw

We started off with red and white sangria. Both were VERY tasty! I couldn't resist and ordered 2!

For food we ordered lobster mac & cheese, bbq shrimp, popcorn shrimp, a andouille link platter, and Emeril's gumbo! 
The dish that stood out the most was most definitely the lobster mac! My, my, my!!!! We were supposed to be sharing it but I couldn't resist hogging it like my own lol! Full of lobster chunks and delicious cheesy penne noodles! Crazy thing is I didn't even order it lol! I ordered the least favorable dish, the gumbo! I was kinda surprised it wasn't better but it wasn't bad either. I expected a bit more flavor and maybe a little kick in the spice department.

The popcorn shrimp were actually a good size. Crispy, fried shrimp, served with a delicious mustard! There was more than enough to share amongst 3 people but I ended up scarfing that down as well lol! 
The bbq shrimp were tasty but not knock your socks off amazing. They were 3 large battered shrimp in a semi sweet bbq sauce.

The andouille platter surprised me! Im not a huge fan of sausage on its own but this was delicious! It was accompanied by a creole mustard, bread, and SUPER tangy/sweet pickles. Definitely worth $9 to try!

The appetizer portions are worth the money, drinks are delicious, and service was great! I can't wait to return to Vegas!",RGWFUjJkG54mJ_qZy9OBXQ,0,0,4,1nYnmsz1-1Dqk0CC3XEmfg

Table 10 only offers a lunch option during Restaurant Week but this is a good way to try a place.  For the first course, I went with the chicken and Andouille sausage gumbo.  This is Emeril's place so why go with a salad.  The gumbo also had steamed rice in it and my server added freshly ground pepper to my liking.  When I first tasted the gumbo, I thought that it needed something more to kick it up a notch.  I almost asked for some hot sauce but I thought that might be like asking for a salt shaker at Jo√´l Robuchon.  As I ate the gumbo, the spiciness started to kick in.  The spice was there.  It showed itself fully as you ate more of the gumbo.

For the main course, I chose the the pea tortellini.  This menu describes it as sweet pea tortellini with handmade pasta, pea shoots, Romano cheese, mascarpone and lemon oil.  It was really a flavorful dish and just the right amount for lunch considering dessert was yet to come.

For dessert, you can choose any of the desserts on the menu.  I went with the specialty of the house, the banana cream pie.  It was excellent.  A tall slice of goodness with layers of large, whole chucks of banana with seams of cream.  It's like a block wall of banana with cream holding the blocks in place.  It was excellent!

Service was good.  There weren't a whole lot of people here, but it appeared like one server was covering the lunch crowd except for the people sitting at the bar.

Now that we have the warnings out of the way, let's get to the review! I decided on the 1/2 chicken because I did not see any other reviews on here about it. 

The overall ambience of this restaurant was pleasurable to say the least. It has a modern vibe, but rustic look. Much like the chicken I had. 

The first item delivered to my table after my ice water was two bread rolls. These rolls had a sweet aroma, and right away my mouth began to water. I was getting sweet rolls! Very good, but not the best. The butter was cold, so it was a bit difficult to spread. 

Onto the main meal. A beautiful looking chicken was bestowed upon a bed of potatoes surrounded by a molasses looking goo around the plate. The smell was pleasant. When I cut into the chicken I could tell that the it had been cooked well. But when I started eating I was getting any flavor. I was quite disappointed by this. But the chicken was a good quality bird, so that makes up for the lack of flavor within the skin. The potatoes were ok, but they could have done more with this dish.

My mom had the crab cakes and the piri piri; the crab cakes had a nice taste to them but fell apart - I expected a bit more out of a restaurant quality crab cake. The piri piri was ok at best and included a mystery ""fish"" we couldn't identify (and we eat a lot of fish).

Although, the service was good, the food did seem as though there had somehow been a change to the kitchen staff since our previous dinners.
After our meal we were prepared to indulge in our favorite memory of our previous dinners, however with apologies to Marie Callander, Emerils famous Banana Cream Pie as well as his Carrot Cake seemed as though they were taken right out of the box and served to us still frozen.
With the multitude of choices in Vegas for food and drink,  I think we will have to change our last night out tradition to somewhere else.",lM17Whoo3XkYu6rvUzQIOA,0,0,2,UVKjsSW4wuV2DZhJbBAyjA

The food was good - the group chowed through the calamari and seemed to really like them.  I personally don't eat the chewy little rings.
My salad was bomb; I always love the salad dressings at Emeril's restaurants and this was no exception.  It was the mixed greens with a roasted tomato vinaigrette.
The table shared the smashed potatoes, garlicky mushrooms and truffled mac n cheese.  I also got a yummy bite of steak from a handsome dining companion and a scallop from the generous Denise F.  Both were phenomenal.  My pork with mashed sweet taters was good, but I think I like mine from Iron Chef Battle Chocolate a bit more; sorry Emeril.  I outbammed you.

My hub had a tall dark ale of some sort which I forgot the name of but was very smooth and tasty.

The toppings on the brussels was a little much, but it was still great.

4220665,2011-01-31,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"I was really excited to go here after seeing the menu, but was so incredibly disappointed! My company took us here, so I didn't have to pay, but had I paid, I'd want my money back. 

We had a prix fixe menu, so part of it is the lack of choice, but even so, if I am at a high end restaraunt, I expect that the chef will take pride in every dish, so nothing should be substandard, and this meal definitely was.

I had the vegetarian menu. Problem 1 was that they didn't give us a veggie first course at all. So there's a dozen people, eating a crab salad course around us, and the vegetarians are just sitting there waiting. Absolutely not ok. How hard is it to make the same salad and just skip the crabmeat. 

The second course for meat eaters were spicy shrimp that people seemed happy with and smelled pretty good. For veggies the course was creamy risotto with vegetables. Great idea in theory, but undercooked (and I do not mean al dente, I really mean undercooked) and oversalted. And I love salt, so that takes effort.

Third course. Vegetarians got pasta. A second starch. Really? We just had risotto. The meat eaters got halibut and gnocchi. I do eat fish, so my boyfriend traded with me and ate my pasta and I had his food. I did enjoy this course. It was also a bit salty, but well cooked and I really liked the veggies mix with it. The gnocchi was just ok.

Next, the main course. Everyone received a steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Time went by. An uncomfortable amount of time. Some people were almost done with their steak. Then the vegetarian food came. Surprise! They seemed to be fresh out of ideas because the meal was mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus, and a couple slivers of mushroom. As in, they just skipped the steak, piled on extra potatoes, and called that a main course. That's not a main course. That's a side, and after 2 other starch dishes, not even a creative one. Sigh. I had asparagus. The potatoes were good potatoes, but really not what you want as your main course. How hard would it have been to grill a whole portabello? My friend wasn't crazy about his steak either, and he loves steak.

Last but not least, dessert was cheesecake. It had a a berry sauce. The berry sauce was cook, the cheesecake completely average. You can't really have bad cheesecake, but I expected great cheesecake, not something equal to the stuff you get at Safeway. So I saved the calories instead, since there was a Bouchon Bakery downstairs that was infinitely better, and life is too damn short to eat average dessert.

One positive side - they carry a good selection of top shelf vodka, and my drink was great, which is what pushed my review to 2 stars. The sauvignon blanc was also good.

So the overall point is, I got this meal free, I'm thankful to my work for taking us out, but if I am ever given the choice to go again I will be passing on it.",2ysxAEmaUmTBMKHud3aSFQ,0,0,2,8V4ZPVmAeyQvRvtUmnAyQg

It's not a Vegas burger joint.  The set menu is a fantastic deal. My steak was perfection.  Candied bacon is great as were bacon wrapped dates.

While there was nothing wrong with the salad, as I said in the opening, it did not wow me in any way...just a solid preparation of a decent salad.

The entree was a Braised Lamb Shank with Pumpkin Risotto.  The lamb shank was done well, but it could have used a bit more seasoning, as I had to add salt and pepper to bring out the flavors.  The risotto was prepared well, but there was no pumpkin flavor to it.

I ordered the striped bass and it was cooked well. The dish was literally the whole fish, minus the head. The skin was taken off the meat, but it was draped back over the fish for presentation. Didn't choke on any bones, another plus. This seems like a healthier choice from the menu, since it's like steamed fish, but who knows how much butter was actually used!

My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to a nice meal and excited to try one of Emeril's signature restaurants.  This is what we concluded:

Pros: 
-The initial bread they give you (my boyfriend liked it, but I did not).  They serve you one piece of bread that tasted no different than a warmed up croissant. Not bad, nothing special.
- Casual ambiance and impressive wine cellar.

Cons:
-Food was cheap quality and unimpressive.  (I ordered the cheese plate...it came with 3 different cheeses, brie, manchango, and gouda I think it was, some honey, raspberries, and water crackers.  I am ALMOST positive they purchased all of these things from trader joes.  Ive seen all of these things at trader joes, and it tasted identical.  Not bad, but I should have just gone to trader joes to save money...)
-Quality of food did not match what you had to pay for it.
-Service was subpar.  We saw our server once or twice...and I felt bad for the guy.  He looked like he was scared to talk to us :(  It made for an awkward evening.
- Flavor was so so.

Overall:
All in all, not a terrible meal, but I was expecting better quality especially with how much you pay.  The service was also very disappointing since the atmosphere is so fun, and the server was virtually mute.  I would personally not go back.",x4FTUhMKSkblxXltklvSow,3,2,2,t0vjcqZX-nHitxa6jDBFnw

4382604,2016-06-14,2,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"When checking out the menus for Restaurant Week 2016 the lunch menu here really stuck out as a good option. Table 10 was offering a three course lunch for $20 which is a great deal.

The restaurant is located in The Grand Canal Shop area near some of the higher end stores like Kate Spade and Michael Kors. The restaurant seating is partly inside and part is in front of the restaurant where the halls are for the shops. The seating in front would be a good option for those that enjoy people watching since Vegas has plenty of gems to see.

Before we ordered we were served warm yeast rolls that were very good. I love fresh made bread. I started with the Beet Salad which was the best part of my meal. It had fresh roasted beets, goat cheese, and a pistachio butter. The pistachio butter was so good and definitely added something to the salad. My husband had the Chicken & Andouille Gumbo which he said was good, but not the best he's ever had.

For the second course we both had the New Orleans Shrimp Po Boy. The shrimp inside was nicely seasoned and there was a nice amount of shrimp. The sandwich was more than enough food for one. Overall, the sandwich was pretty good. I really liked the crispy, thick fries served with the po boy.

Dessert was a win for both of us. My husband had the Banana Cream Pie which he loved and the slice was a very generous slice. I had the White Chocolate Malasadas. I decided to order them even though I had no idea what malasadas are, but it was a good choice because they were so yummy. The malasadas are delicious and light fried dough with white chocolate in the middle and sugar on the outside. I loved this dessert and thought it was unique to the dessert options I see at other restaurants.

The service was not horrible, but could have been better. Our waitress was friendly and checked in on us, but we went long periods without seeing anyone. Our lunch was almost two hours long for a pre-fixe menu. We started out okay with bread and starters coming out without much wait, but then everything went to snail pace after that. Our po boys took a long time to arrive at the table. Dessert wasn't a long wait, but then we had to wait a long time to get the check. I actually started to wonder if the waitress had left for the day because she wasn't even walking around and nobody else was even passing by to ask for our waitress. Eventually she came back, but the slow service kind of soured the experience.

The dinner menu looks interesting and I liked the feel of the restaurant so I would consider coming here again. Our lunch was pretty good and hopefully the slow service was a one off.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,4,2,3,0lR5QtXGcF1DhZUPIwcefw

We decided to do the $45  4 course tasting menu.  Unlike many tasting menus not everyone in the group has to do it (though we all it).  This was an exceptional deal for the amount of and quality of food that we received.

My first course was the gumbo.  Such a true classic gumbo.  A taste of New Orleans, so pure with the right mild spices.   Did you eat your hot roll already? Don't worry just ask for another so you can wipe the bowl clean.

My second course was the Bbq shrimp.  The beautiful shrimp with a homemade Rosemary biscuit.  I recommend cutting/breaking up the biscuit so that as you eat the shrimp (savor each succulent bite) you can use the biscuit to sop up the bbq sauce on the plate.  Still sauce left...ask for another hot roll to leave a white plate.

Third course...the entree: the Short ribs-these were so tender they melted in my mouth. On a bed of saut√©ed kale and a beet and horseradish smeer.  The beet and horseradish with the short rib was the perfect complement.  The kale was a little moe challenging for me.  Was more like spinach and colored green sort of.  The first couple bites I was unsure but something was intriguing and I kept eating.  By the end I eat it all and could say I enjoyed it.  Was an earned win.

Desert my folks had Emeril's famous banana pie.  They loved it.  Not really my thing so I had the Malassadas.  Kind of like a benign filled with melted white chocolate, rolled in cinnamon and sugar with a raspberry sauce.  This should not be legal.  You put one in your mouth and the melted chelate burst in your mouth and mixes with the dough sugar and raspberry.  Mmmmmmm roll me back to my hotel.  

Big thanks to the server team-Creagan and guys were patient and well informed.  It was a delight.  So well coordinated.",VyZldifbBwXCC0g2tq7L7w,0,0,5,X14EZ_gKKhDxKkxTKh6oCA

The service we had was wonderful. They made sure to always check up on us, had our waters filled and took care of us out through the whole dinner.

Someone else at the table ordered a duck dish that had a nice, round flavor to it.  My cocktail was kind of gross--some monstrosity with big slogs of ginger chunks in it.  I like ginger but I don't like it that much, kids.

The best thing about the meal were the appetizers.  I remember the crispy shrimp toast one which was delicious.  If I had to come here again (not by choice, probably), I would like to just get a bunch of appetizers to share.

My fiancee is vegetarian, and the kitchen was happy to exclude chorizo from the mahi mahi for him -- and he still raved about the delicious meal.   Although the scallops themselves were gritty, the broth along with gnocchi and crab were very tasty.  The escargot made a great appetizer -- savory and just enough to whet our palates.

Emeril has been here for awhile so I think his standard fair at his restaurants are tested and true recipes with service that has been honed over time. When going to an Emeril restaurant you are most likely going to have a good meal with good service.

My mother and I ate here for lunch on their Restaurant Week 2014 menu. My one and only dining experience for this season's RW, unfortunately. We arrived shortly after they opened and were seated in the empty front dining area. Our server was prompt and courteous, continually checking on us throughout the meal and our drinks were topped off consistently.

My mother and I both started off with the Boston Salad that came with big, leafy greens, giant tomatoes, big chunks of bacon, and buttermilk ranch dressing with fresh cracked black pepper. Phenomenal! I could have this salad just as an entree and be fine. The quality of the lettuce was exceptional and each bite was crisp and enjoyable.

Next, my mother chose the peach roasted chicken and I wish I had gotten it too! It was flavorful, tender, and juicy, with a crispy skin, and spiced perfectly. It came with a savory bread pudding and grilled mushrooms. 

I opted for the lobster ravioli which was disappointing. While the raviolis themselves were well cooked and stuffed nicely with lobster the tomato butter it was served in was terribly off-putting for me and I really disliked the Cajun flavor to it (I know, Emeril's cooking style IS Cajun!), but still just not great in my opinion and very lackluster. It came topped with cuts of asparagus and not even they could pick the dish up.

Lastly, dessert was delish. I had the Chocolate Mousse Cake, which was so so decadent, but fluffy and sinfully sweet. My mother opted for the very famous banana cream pie (which I have had before), and she said it was exquisite. 

Overall the disappointment in my main entree was balanced by the good service, salad, and dessert. I am sure this miss with the entree is an exception, not a consistency.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,4,5ab7QZnoBfVvdM1NIWZZ2g

The smelt were fried perfectly.  Unfortunately, there was way too much salt sprinkled all over the smelt after they were fried.  Takes a lot for me to say that as I like big taste.  Also, tried the beef cheek appetizer.  This was tender and excellent with plenty of vegetables.  The Gumbo was rather mild and needed a Tabasco sauce kick.  I chose the suckling pig ""porchetta"" entree and was underwhelmed.  Bland meat with pretty bland sauce.

Well...we lucked out. Not only was the ambience perfect for a nice romantic but not stuffy dinner, but the food was absofrickinmazing!

I said to my fiance that if any of the other dishes are better than this one I will be a very happy man.

Table 10 is located by the shops in the Pallazo. At first, I kinda got the impression that it was a high-end restaurant with over-priced food and mediocre food. But after eating here, it definitely did change my mind. The service was good, the food tasted great and we all had a simply great lunch after a night of partying hard.

Their signature ""bloody mary"" was a little different from the original and a tab bit more on the spicy side, but it worked really well for me. I also noticed that it was dressed with olives stuffed with blue chesse and not celery. Olive stuffed with blue cheese, who thinks that ?! It worked awesome with the cocktail.

For appetizers we tried the Seafood Creole Bouillabaisse and another appetizer which was on a special menu for the day. Both tasted fabulous.
Main entrees: we tried the Grilled Rib-eye steak with lobster scampi, Carnitas Po-boy, Creole Crawfish ""boil"" Pasta, and i gotta say, it was blown away by the taste and the food quality. The steak has to be one of the best steaks Ive ever tried! It went perfectly with the lobster and the lemony dressing.

After reading all the great reviews and mouth watering menu choices, my boyfriend and I decided Table 10 would be a definite dinner location while being on vacation in Las Vegas.

Over-all service wasn't top notch however the menu selection was very inviting. Once we arrived were greeted however it must have been a shift change as the greeting was very mediocre. While ordering our server was very knowledgeable on wine selection, appetizers & main courses.

Roasted Beef Marrow Bones 
toasted brioche - sea salt; The beef marrow wasn't anything to call home about & a bit dull on flavoring. 

The Braised Beef Cheeks 
wild mushrooms - fava beans - Wiser Farms carrots; was mouthing watering, every bite melted in our mouths as we craved for more. 

Lastly, who can go wrong with a Bloomsdale Spinach Salad with
Hy Desert farm tomato - pickled onion - roasted garlic - Drake Family farms goat cheese ? Nothing unique about this salad however portion size was good for two people & the roasted garlic wasn't very over powering.

I have to admit that a 4 course tasting menu can sometimes not be too filling but I was pleasantly surprised at how large all of the portions were.  I started out with the candied bacon.  Not that I would ever complain about bacon but its kind of like a maple bacon you might get at a lot of places.  The wife got a crab salad which was excellent and had a surprisingly large portion of crab.  For 2nd course, I got a Boston Salad which tasted....... just like a Boston Salad.  The wife went with a beef carpacio.  The carpacio was sliced soooooo thin yet packed such a large amount of flavor..... genius!  For main course I got the Kurobota Pork rack.  It was a huge piece of pork and after I was done I was completely full.  Cooked perfectly as pork can get very dry if overdone.  The wife got scallops which was tasty but maybe the only dish that wasn't a heaping plate of food.  After we were both completely stuffed the waiter asked us what we wanted for desert.  I managed to stuff down maybe half of the banana cream pie I ordered.  Excellent pie and full of banana chunks.  The wife ordered a trio of sorbet and unlike the vast majority of restaurants that give you 2 tiny teaspoons of sorbet Emeril gave us 3 large ice cream scoopers of sorbet!

They had a large group there so we couldn't enjoy the actual dining room, but it was cool. We sat at a nice table not far from the bar. 

We started with the oysters which was on-special for the day, the avocado egg rolls, southern fried hot wings and crab cake! The oysters were once again a hit!!!... VERY nice, though I personally liked the oysters @New Orleans Fish House better. These came with a cucumber mignonette cocktail sauce which added a freshness and clean taste to the oysters. The egg rolls....WOW..... My wife and I both agreed these were very different! The smoked tomato aioli was very flavorful, the crunch of the shell offered a nice contrast in textures. It was again VERY nice and clean. The sriracha hot wings were okay. I was expecting that Emeril BAM in flavor. Here although well cooked they were much milder than I expected. The crab cake was VERY good... WOW.. It came with a mango, cucumber slaw and jalapeno dressing! There was the BAM I was looking for. The jalapeno wasn't over the top AT ALL!... It was sneaking around in the background against the sweetness of the mango and freshness of the cucumber! WONDERFUL!!.. Like his other place more meat less filling!... At this point in the meal our eyes were bigger than our stomach, but we pushed on. 

For the entr√©e, my wife had the salt & pepper crusted ahi-tuna. It came with bok choy-daikon & shiitake mushrooms in a lemongrass and ginger broth. The only compliant she had was wishing it came with MORE BROTH!... So they made her some. It was VERY CLEAN and actually VERY LIGHT!. The flavors were great, tuna was PERFECT! I had the pan roasted salmon. It came with red quinoa, sunflower seeds and wild ramps and a spiced apricot glaze.... WOW-WOW-WOW... It was ABSOLUTLEY DELICIOUS!... Although light and airy and well cooked the flavors worked VERY WELL together!.. The nice softness of the quinoa, crunch of the seeds and slight sweetness of the apricot was PERFECT!.. I Loved it. Probably the best Salmon dish I've had EVER!!!... WOW!. We finished out meal with the spice carrot cake with orange bourbon sauce and candied pecans..... DAMN!...... That's all I can say/type. BAM!.!!.!!!.!!!!

Also again, the staff were very attentive, quick and organized!... TOP NOTCH as the others.

We came right around 5pm, when dinner starts, so it was really slow and empty so our service was outstanding.  We chose to sit outside in the patio, which wasn't as dimmed as it was inside the restaurant.  We got the Taste of Table 10, four courses for $48 for dinner.  I ordered the Caesar salad for my first course, New Orleans BBQ shrimp for second, filet mignon for third and the raspberry panna cotta for fourth course/dessert.  I liked the Caesar, came with whole leafs of lettuce and a crostini, which was quite chewy and dry.  My friend got the gumbo, which I got a bite of, taste was okay, had the right amount of spices but no flavor. The second course had big jumbo shrimp with a sweet and light BBQ sauce drenched over it.  Only thing I didn't like was the biscuit, quite dry and cold when served.  Next, was the filet mignon, which was a lot more than I thought but no complaints there, served with a bunch of pearl onions and glazed carrots and was really tender and soft and cooked to my liking.

Service: IMO, the service was perfect.  They were friendly and extremely attentive.  Even if you leave the table just to use the restroom, they will come over and fold your napkins for you.  Sometimes at fancy restaurants, service gets snooty if you dont order wine, etc.  But they were completely respectful of our choices.

Food: They start off with bread rolls.  At first they looked like normal bread rolls and I felt disappointed but then i tried it!  It was warm, sweet, and salty at the same time.  DELISH.  We had 2 orders of calamari (the waitress told us the plates were small but actually it was big!  So 1 order should be enough).  

As for the main dishes:  nice big portions.  Mmm.  3 of us ordered Creole Spiced & Seared Mahi Mahi.  The mahi mahi was perfect and to have all the other seafood accompany the dish... mmm.  1 of my friend ordered the salmon and she loved it.  Another one ordered the Creole Crawfish ""Boil"" Pasta.

We get there around happy  hour and start off with a couple of mojitos and chips & salsa.  The chips & salsa appetizer is HUGE, and for $5...a good deal.  I opt for the pulled pork sandwich (with carnitas) and fried pickles.  Husband gets the burger.  I get the concept of the carnitas in a bbq pulled pork sandwich, but I just wasn't too impressed with it.  The fried pickles on the other hand were phenomenal!  My husbands burger was good, but I wouldn't say it was anything special.

Again, this place was not packed or full at all.. I guess that shows how meh this place is.

Easy to make reservations.  We were seated right by the walkway..  and the waiter was nice enough.   But really.. the culprit is the food.

I was never a huge fan of Emeril to be honest.. anybody who gained significant weight during the course of his show in addition to adding butter to make things better and yelling out bam... doesn't qualify as a good cook.  But hey, I decided to give it a try.  I loved the food when I went to NOLA this year.. but it's just better there unfortunately.

My food critique:
1.  I had the beef cheeks and they were tender.. but not really flavorful.  
2.  Also tried their supposedly amazing truffle mac and cheese.  It is pretty flavorless in my opinion.
3.  Heard the gumbo was nothing to write home about... and this is a standard Southern dish.
4.  Scallops were actually quite good... there were only three.  I didn't really care for the creamy sauce that was on the plate but it tasted delicious.  

My friends said they enjoyed their steak dinners but then again, there are a dozen steak places (like Cut which may be a tad more pricey) in the area.

My wife and I are in town celebrating our 15th anniversary, and we're staying at the Venetian for the first time due to its collection of celebrity chef locations.   Emeril has been a favorite of ours for a long time, so we were excited to try Table 10.  We wanted to stay on-property for our first night in town.

We were seated next to a half-dressed morning-after bachelorette party, which put a damper on the meal from the start.  We waited 5-10 minutes for menus while the party next to us had speakerphone conversations.  Our waiter ignored us most of the visit in order to placate their requests.

I'm sure the inside of the restaurant might be nice, but we were seated in what can nicely be described as ""mall ambiance"", between the retail stores and the escalator.

The waiter's assistant brought us a plain flat biscuit (looked like it was from a can) and some water, and appeared to be the only one doing anything.  Very slow return service on water, and no bread refill.

We chose to share the Crab Hush Puppies (4) as an appetizer.  Paired with the essence mayo sauce that came with it, these were tasty.  Definitely needed the sauce though, and they were a little undercooked.

My wife chose the Croque Madame, which was a ham and Swiss sandwich with a sunny-side up egg on top, with fried potato wedges and a small balsamic salad. The ham in this was excellent, and she was happy with the sides.  I chose the Lobster Rolls, which came with a small side of cole slaw. The lobster rolls were lobster + mayo on Hawaiian rolls, and they were fine, but since this was Emeril's restaurant, I expected them to be spicy or at least seasoned with Emeril's essence or ANY seasoning.  They could and should have been so much better!  There is an expectation (by me, anyway) that a lobster roll at an Emeril restaurant should be above and beyond what I could get at Lobster Me in Venetian, and it definitely was not.  The cole slaw was overkill on mayo.

We also ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese to share as a side.  We were really hoping this would be great, but it definitely was not.  It was not cheesy at all, and had very little flavor.  There was no taste of truffle at all, so it failed on every level to live up to its name except that it did have macaroni in it.

Our excitement to eat at celebrity chef restaurants has been lowered.  Our expectation was that food quality and presentation at a celebrity chef location would be better than average and I do not think that is setting the bar too high.  We have eaten in restaurants bordering the Grand Canal Shoppes that had way less mall-type distractions.  Most of the food was average, but we left half of the truffle macaroni & cheese on the table, which is not the norm for us.   Very disappointing.   I don't think we will be back.",XiO2G6mXut5pOy8dpPpmVw,0,0,2,JpFpvyZjjHLK7OUCsz-aoQ

Quiet enough to have a conversation and still considered a casual lunch.

Food: Hummus was great! The salad was slightly smaller than I expected, but I was still plenty full by the end of the meal. I recommend adding chicken if you are making a meal of it.

Of all the bar eats, the duck fat fries are an obvious standout.  Skip the summer rolls, they were disappointingly soggy and in general lacked flavour.  The BBQ shrimp arrived skewered and head-on.

My wife ate hers, but for the last hour she's been complaining how thirsty she is.  I could only stomach 3 spoonfuls of it.  When I told the waiter it was inedible salty he simply said: ""too salty?"" and then took it away without asking if I wanted anything else.

Next, the Po-Boys arrive.  It was difficult to eat, was very dry, and fairly tasteless.  We asked for some of the dressing/sauce on the side to give it some lubrication.  The sauce basically tasted like tarter sauce, and didn't really help much.  The fried shrimp didn't really have any flavor to it.  It came with a side of boring, plain fries with ketchup.   You would expect something a bit more exciting from Emeril.  Even some simple Cajun spice on the fries would have been a step up.  My wife gave up on her Po-Boy.

The good news is that the manager apologized and asked for feedback, and they stuck some of it off the bill.  Had we paid the full $60+ for the meal it would have been insane, especially for lunch.  When we left we had to go get some Mentos to get the French fry grease out of us.

For 2nd course, I got MUSHROOM RAVIOLI. Earthy, umami and creamy. That sauce was so delicious. My husband had EMERIL'S NEW ORLEANS BBQ SHRIMP. It was the BEST dish of the night.

I ordered the ANGUS SHORT RIB for main course. Unlike most braised short rib. This one was very juicy. I love that charred cauliflower puree too. Amazing. Husband got the bolognese pasta. It was fine. Light. The pasta was al dente which I like. But it is still a bolognese pasta after all.

We also all ordered salads. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad, which was very tasty. I especially loved the crostini that came with it--I wanted about 10 more of those. I also tried a bite of the beet salad, which was good.

The wine selection is excellent, and the wines by the glass are reasonable (10-14 or so). I had a delightful sauvignon blanc--really one of the better glasses of wine I've had in a restaurant.  I think everyone at our table had either wine or beer (they have an OK beer selection, but nothing fancy, and only bottles).

No desserts, so I can't comment on that.

The ambience is lovely, though I was surprised that there was no music playing. Eerily quiet. It also wasn't particularly crowded, and we were there on a Saturday between about 6 and 8.

The service was inconsistent--fast in the beginning, then slow before the entrees, and then slow again to pick up the check. 

The whole thing came to something like $450 including tax and tip, which I viewed as pretty good for Vegas. Still, I'd try another place before I'd go back.",LdIMvVKUVDxjlaaa9p2W-A,0,0,3,y4-arvR1uT1Gvw5YhqWReg

The restaurant and the menu was completely unexpected because it is a different dining experience compared to other Emeril restaurants.

The prosciutto sandwich was horrible.  We both ordered it.  It was vinegar SOAKED... the bread was falling apart, they put the prosciutto (AKA salt cured ham that is NOT cooked) into the panini maker they clearly used... and the entire plate was just a mess.  My salad had brown lettuce and mostly the SEEDS of tomatoes.

I ordered a sangria (white).  I should have known better.  It tasted like water, and had an ugly smooshed cherry on top and a tattered looking orange slice.

Wait staff?  What wait staff?  We waited up front so long for someone (over two minutes) we thought we seated ourselves.  I said I wanted NO water (we were at a small table and I don't like tap water, why waste the space?) and I was promptly delivered a glass.

She came back right after the food arrived and we never saw her again until the, ""Shall I bring you a dessert menu?"" conversation.

I get having 8 people do 8 different jobs... but one to seat us, one to bring us water we don't want, one to deliver menus, one to take an order, two to bring the food... is ridiculous.  Spend all that money on a better chef and I will wait longer for a refill.

4962594,2011-06-04,1,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"I was in Las Vegas for a company trip (haha, pretty awesome) and decided to go to Palazzo to check out what they had going on since I had not been. After walking about a bit my friends and I got a bit hungry. We decided to consult the Palazzo directory and spotted Emeril's Table 10 restaurant. We just couldn't pass up this opportunity. We got that and were seated immediately, it was a Thursday around 11am, people are probably still passed out from the night before from partying.

Here's what we got:

Spicy Sesame Pork Dumplings: I thought, potsticker or soupy dumplings, but they turn out being Char Siu Bao (BBQ pork bun, baked) looking items. Biting into one was like biting into a slightly denser puff pastry and then you are greeted with the spicy pork filing. The word dumplings and look made me think chinese style, but its more of a fusion between french and chinese styles. A good one worth trying.

New Orleans Fried Shrimp Po-Boy with natural cut fries: If you like shrimp, this one is a must. The shrimp are a good size and are lightly battered and fried to golden. I don't usually talk about fries but they thicker cut fries here must be double fried because they aren't soft like at most places. They are crispy on the outside and smooth and fluffy on the inside, and so good.

Slow Cooked Pork Po-Boy: Nice sweet molasses BBQ sauce in a freshly baked bread, with those great natural fries like above. The pulled pork was good but not stellar, the bread is what set it apart from others.

Emeril's Banana Cream Pie: When the plate arrives, you are greeted by a 4-5 inch towering slice of banana cream pie with chocolate shavings, caramel sauce and whipped cream. The pie is made well, since it does not sag in any direction. I ran my fork into it easily piercing through the whipped cream, chocolate shavings and caramel, but when my fork met the banana cream, it slowed to a crawl as my fork made its way through the velvety cream and breaking up the pieces of banana. The final layer was the graham cracker crust which require me to exert a bit of sharp force and with a crunch, my fork made it through. I places the forkful of pie in my mouth and my senses were immediately bombarded with a rush of banana taste and aroma. The banana cream was velvety and just sweet enough. The mouth feel was off the charts because of the crunchy graham cracker crust, mixed with the banana cream, sweet slices of banana, whipped cream and nuggets of sweetness from the chocolate shaving and and caramel sauce. I was sharing this and I seriously wanted to order another slice because it was that good, but then I remembered I was stuffed and really shouldn't eat anymore.

The major highlight of this meal was definitely the dessert. The Banana Cream Pie here redefined Banana Cream Pies for me. NOT TO BE MISSED, you will be sorry if you do.    

I make a very good banana cream pie, so I always try to taste test banana cream pies where ever I go and nothing ever beats the one I make. But this one! Hats off to Emeril, that man knows his banana cream pie.",09D7Y6dbzmVQ0F15MH1AQw,3,1,5,wiJaw9UhX0l24XYygwmiIw

For starters, the roasted bone marrow is outstanding.  Creamy and melt in your mouth delicious.  Perfect on the toasted brioche.  The braised beef cheeks; fork tender, deep flavor throughout and so perfect with the wild mushrooms and fava beans.

Soon after one of the chefs came up to our table and introduced himself. Really friendly person named Wesley. He gave us horderves that were compliments of the house. They were delicious.
The bacon they served us came with a side of syrup that carmalized as soon as it touched the bacon. Very decadent. 
Later he came back with some turkey for us to try. Which was also amazing.
My filet mignon was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life.
The timing between the courses was perfect I believe they were watching us and making sure we had finished the course we were working on before bring is the next course. So we were not rushed at all. Whenever my glass was low they refilled my drink right away. I cannot speak highly enough about the service I received at Table 10.

Without getting into details of every item I will say that everything we tried was excellent including several wine selections by the glass.  Nothing average here.  However, the Filet steak was incredible.  If you read my reviews you will find I have eaten (often) at many of the top steak houses in the country and I can't recall a better tasting steak, ever.  This steak was so full of flavor, cooked exactly to order and tender it was remarkable.  

The service was super from start to finish and at no time was my water glass much less than 1/2 full and we were checked on frequently despite the restaurant being very busy.  I should also note that our appetizer came out within 3 or 4 minutes of ordering and the second course was just minutes after we finished the first course.  Perfect timing.

Not a Chef known for failures, all four of his Las Vegas restaurants still going strong in an environment   that often fancies whatever is new as opposed to what is actually 'best,' it was during a Special Event book signing hosted by Emeril Lagasse himself that I originally met new Table10 Chef de Cuisine James Richards and sensing the new toque's passion it seemed only a matter of time before he made some changes, the first of these beginning less than one month ago with a ""Snack Bar"" looking to raise the stakes for Happy Hour while also allowing the kitchen staff a chance to play.

Appropriately named as the menu is offered only at hightop seats overlooking the sprawling kitchen in back, the idea behind Snack Bar is essentially serving a few classic Emeril bites alongside chalkboard specials priced at less than ten bucks, the freshly made share plates beginning at 4pm and offered in limited quantities depending on ingredient availability for each.

Considered by many a misunderstood place, the other Lagasse Restaurants clearly focused of Fish, Steaks and Tailgate favorites, items on the Table10 Snack Bar show the range of a kitchen equally capable of making a good pasta or searing a rack of Venison, both items sampled from the nightly dinner menu with the Lobster Mac and signature Smokey Mushroom Noodles from Pasta Shop each a bonafide sharable bargain for less than $20, the ""American Beauty"" Duck living up to its name with flower petals decorating rosy flesh and a salad tossed with crispy confit thigh.

Offering comfortable seating, the highback bar stools soft and wide enough that diners will want to stick around sipping cocktails while watching Richards and team hard at work, no trip to the Snack Bar would be complete without a plate of Emeril's Candy-like Bacon bolstered by Barrel Aged Nobel Tonic, not to mention locally sourced Devils on Horseback or the huge plate of Roasted Marrow Bones served simply with Bread and Sea Salt, the rare item cracking double digits and still a bargain at just $11.

Getting onto daily whimsy, the King Crab Benedict unfortunately tipped a bit briny by too much Tasso served in the hash on top, better balance was found in shredded beef cheek complimented by crisp French Fries and bubbling cheese curds, the duck fat popcorn studded with Black Truffles and Foie Gras surprisingly successful for something that at first seemed silly while the ""Rangoon"" were greaseless golden Potstickers far better than any to be found in Chinatown at a slightly higher price.

Never to pass up Dessert at a restaurant from my very first ""favorite"" Chef the trio of Carrot Cake,  Malassadas, and Banana Cream Pie proved no less perfect than ever while Snack Bar Beignets achieved the rare feat of being neither too sweet nor too doughy, the Bread Pudding finally making its return after a long absence reason enough to pay Table 10 a visit with the caramelized banana base and plenty of butter given levity by a touch of booze, shaved dark chocolate, and airy whipped cream.

****Taking a chance by thinking outside the box, something locals can only hope more Casino kitchens might do, the Snack Bar at Table 10 is poised to reinterpret the concept of Happy Hour by putting creativity back in the hands of its Chefs and whether for a full meal or just a few bites the results are quite impressive for the price point, the restaurant as a whole equally so.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,12,4,DMuDs59Wq93N3xm5sTihzw

Each one cooked to a perfect consistency. The rosemary biscuit was flaky, but on the salty side. With the seasoning and the shrimp, it got to be too much. Next came the scallops. They had the perfect sear on them. I loved the pairing with grapes, almonds and a parsnip puree that enhanced the natural sweetness of the shellfish. To finish off, we got to choose any one of their desserts. I got to taste the tiramisu, his famous banana cream pie, and the almond cake. The latter was definitely the winner of the night.

I let that pass, and grabbed it together and took a big bite, all I could taste was the feta cheese and cold ingredients (shaved lettuce, red onion, tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumber and tzatziki sauce), finally getting to the Lamb, which was room temperature, with some slices being cold.

I opened up the gyro and attempted to dig out the lamb and eat it, finally giving up because of it being cold.

The ratios were off, too much of the cold elements, as well as a under pita bread.

I signaled Matt over, the server, and apologized but simply couldn't finish the dish, in which is promptly apologized and removed it from the bill.

But we had friends from out of town with kids and this is the restaurant they chose.  I must say overall, I was surprised by the value for the amount of food.  Is this the best food on the strip? No, but we had 4 courses for $45.  The ambiance has a bar/lounge feel. They have some large tables facing the casino, that allowed for two strollers to fit.  So overall, I would say if you want a nice meal and want to bring young kids, this is an option.  To start with, they bring a complimentary amuse-bouche, a bacon wrapped date with an almond inside with blue cheese.  This was really tasty and a nice surprise.  The bread is also a warm croissant hybrid accompanied by soft butter.  For the first course, I had the chicken-andouille sausage gumbo.  I think most people would be disappointed by the spice level, but I prefer things mild.  It had more of a peppery taste than a spicy kick.  This was probably my least favorite item out of all the courses.  However, it sounded better than the salads.  Second course, I had the maple bacon.  I also tried a bite of the bbq shrimp and the mushroom vol au vent.  The bacon was thick, salty, sweet....great combination of flavors.  The bbq shrimp was also very tasty.  The mushroom was good but ranked last.  For the main course, everyone ended up ordering the wagyu strip steak...it was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the meat tasted almost buttery.  By the time dessert came around, I was stuffed.  I ended up trying the banana cream pie, since so many people were raving about it.  However, I found the banana to be a little overwhelming in flavor.  My favorite dessert was the apple pie crumble with ice cream.

But I just can't....

We love Emerils food and frequent his fish house a few times a year so we decided to try his Table 10.  Our waitress and the manager were really great but it just wasn't as good as we expected it to be.

Gumbo-  Great gumbo as I would expect from Emeril
Beef Cheek- very tender and perfectly cooked but not very flavorful...bland, just missing some BAM.
Gnocchi- My wife loved it because it had a unique texture.  I like my Gnocchi to be smooth and creamy...these had an oatmeal like texture and it just turned me off.  The marinara sauce was good, if not a little sweet.
Add-on lobster-  This lobster was so strange that I had to confirm what type of lobster it was with the manager, he replied Maine lobster.  It was a bowl of big lobster chunks but the consistency was not meaty at all as you would expect but more like mushy white fish that flaked apart.  I have never had lobster like this, we didn't finish it.
Spicy maple infused bacon-  This was awesome and unique.  I would go back just to have this again.

I wanted to love Table 10 but it just had more misses than hits.  I do want to stress that the staff was really great...we had an error occur with our left overs and the manager insisted on cooking new dishes for us.  He was very generous and very professional.

I may return and try it one more time in the future....maybe just for the bacon!",38u6Umpnj9s4QobruUH0nA,4,2,3,XVBoQnpehbUp-N-kPwTjfw

Right off of the bat, I was annoyed that we were seated where it was quite loud because we were next to widows that opened up to the mall & people with noisy kids. I wish that they would have asked us if the table was okay because I would have requested a different spot.

Clintele is an odd mix - oldins dressed in tube socks, shorts and New Balances, or people dressed up for a nice night out. I guess that's Vegas for you.

Service is good, but it felt like it took forever to get someone to take our order. It wasn't until I quipped, ""I wish someone would ask if we had any questions or something so that we could order"" did someone pop out of nowhere to take our order.

We came here for the 4 course meal for $48 pp. In addition to the multi course meal, we ordered a cheese platter as an appitizer - my favorite part of the meal.

My first course was 3 bbq shrimp with a biscuit. The shrimp were fine but the biscuit was dry and tasteless - which I didn't finish. Brian had salad for his first course.

My second course was mushroom pasta. I ate all the murshrooms and left the pasta. Unfortunately it was angel hair pasta which I loathe. The dish would have been better with a hearty pasta like penne. Brian had a gumbo, which was pretty tasty.

Our third course was braised shortribs. They were okay, not my favorite. It was fall off the bone tender, but tasted dry at the same time.

My fourth course was white chocolate malasadas. These were too sweet so I let Brian finish them. He chose the banana cream pie which wasn't too sweet and very toothsome. It was unique and very good but I was too full to finish it with Brian.

Overall it was cool to try, but it was too noisy and just okay for certain courses. While I might try happy hour, I doubt I'd  make a repeat visit for dinner.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,2,3,bgN5UpD6nEURV_dmP6k4vQ

The entrees were pretty good, though nothing was spectacular. We all ordered different items, including a couple of the specials. The seafood items were ok and the lobster pot pie had some whole pieces of claw meat. The rotisserie and beef entrees were good, as were the sides. 

The desserts were nice, but there was no bam to be found. Emeril's wines were surprisingly good. The rhone red blend was decent, the chardonnay much better. 

The service itself was hit or miss. Everyone was very friendly and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. The wine and starters all came out without a problem. Then we moved to our entrees. They were brought under those room service lids and placed on a tray next to our table. Where they sat for several minutes as 4 servers had to be rounded up to simultaneously place the dishes. And they didn't even need 4 because 2 servers gave us the mains while the other 2 gave us the sides - and there were only 2 side dishes. My dish probably wasn't piping hot as it was, but the extra wait basically made everything on my plate lukewarm.

Service is spectacular! Attentive, polite, knowledgable, friendly. It doesn't get much better.
On to the food.
Roasted Beef Marrow Bones were decadent, luxurious, mouth watering. Perfection.
Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo was awesome! An authentic Big Easy soup.
Emeril's NOLA BBQ Shrimp were okay. A bit over cooked. 
Croque Madame was fantastic. Flavorful ham, eggs cooked perfectly. No brown edges, yolks thick and rich. So good... My mouth is watering.
Pork PoBoy was really tender, juicy, flavorful.
Truffle Mac N Cheese was really good. A bit watery, but that didn't stop me!

My biggest thrill was the fact they serve Abita Beer and had Crystal Hot Sauce!!!!

Only thing missing was Bread Pudding. Com'on Emeril, It's a New Orleans based restaurant. Where  da bread puddin at?

If they would have had it, five stars.",-aOyKAkjjEEyaGrXB9uKCg,0,0,4,O8gmObfLeFwXkcHhkcpCCg
5702898,2010-10-17,0,KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,"BAM--Emeril kicks it up another notch!  A hidden gem in the Palazzo-Las Vegas.  Being in the shops it is a little hidden from the convention center business crowd.  This was my second visit here, and I continue to love this place.  Being a soup person, I love the country gumbo with steamed rice.  I had some great starters: jalapeno & corn hush puppies, adobe rubbed baby back ribs, and the truffle mac n cheese.  My entree was a wonderful dish: Seared Maine Scallops, jumbo lump crab, lima bean and tomato succotash, creole tomato glaze, and parmesan cheese.  I added a deshelled Maine lobster tail and some grilled baja shrimp to make a meal of Homeric proportions.  It was truly worthy of the name Emeril Lagasse.  For dessert I had one of my favorites: Emeril's: White chocolate malassadas rolled in cinnamon sugar with vanilla creme Anglase.  It is perhaps my favorite light dessert, unlike Emeril's banana creme pie at Emeril's fish house.  Table Ten is truly a hidden gem in the same Palazzo casino as his more heralded Delmonico, and Lagasse Stadium restaurants.  The next time I am in New Orleans I must pay homage to Table #10 in Emeril's original restaurant.  BAM!!!",jOU73K85NeMzBsqwJtfu0A,0,0,5,J1KrxohiJ7FbsRRSOLzSfA

This time though, we sat at the Chef's Counter. This is a bar that faces the kitchen where you can watch all of the food being prepared. The person cooking right in front of you will talk to you and explain what he is making if you ask.

The food here is pretty good. Everything is above average in quality and the portions are large.

I've had the chili chicken wings, gumbo, Brussel sprouts, duck, sweet potato gnocchi, calamari, and tried a few other random things.

Of all the things I have had, I think the gumbo is probably the best. It's slightly spicy and not too overwhelming on any ingredient.

One thing I really like is how they split plates. If you order something to share, they will give each person their own plate with a smaller portion.

I can't really say I've had an ""Oh my God!"" moment here. Everything has been pretty good though and I will eat here again.",z6C4omh8GlgJCvQB08PNrA,0,0,4,oP6eOtkAwS95vVMmzf4PEg

Based on this dish alone I would have given the place 5 stars. However, I have been back multiple times and they have taken it off the menu and The food has been good but not great since then. I've had really good dishes and some pretty mediocre dishes. That being said whenever I've had an issue with a dish I was well taken care of. Don't get me wrong, the food is good and the prices are definitely reasonable considering you are in the Palazzo but they set the bar really high on my first trip in and have yet to hit the bar again food wise.

Where Table 10 really shines is during happy hour with their app and drink specials. You can get a signature cocktail designed by master mixologist Max Solano for a really good price and if you check in on foursquare or yelp you get a free sangria. Actually if it were not for Max's drinks prepared perfectly by Hagan and Pedro I would probably have given table 10 three stars instead of 4. The bartenders take really good care of their customer and in my experiences here, they are better servers than the servers are. Hagan, who I have worked with most, is always on top of things and will make sure you have a good dining experience and Pedro saved the day one time when I had an issue with the bone marrow. One of the three servings was rock hard and my server told me that when it came to bone marrow that you just get what you get. Pedro happened to overhear that and he immediately came over, took my plate and walked back to the kitchen. Soon after I was presented with a replacement. 

In the end, I usually start my evening here since most conventions I go to are in the Sands and this is just a short walk from there and they are open early. I start my evenings here more often than not and it's a great atmosphere. I hope that eventually I will hit the jackpot again as I did on my first visit for dinner but in the meantime I am content with their generous happy hour offerings and great bar service.",2Nc1W2f-Dyn2_-XGVDhNxw,3,0,4,6xEPfOGf6XmUOagkZLP_jQ

We had intended to get pizza, but the pizza place next door had their ovens closed, so we headed here. The decor was great- just intimate enough, but still casual enough for lunch. This may be weird, but one of my favorite parts was the bathroom design and decor- I like the layout, and I love the floor tile. 

We decided to order a bunch of small plates and mostly share, instead of each ordering an entree. We also had some wine. 

We tried the Caesar salad, the gumbo, the stuffed red peppers, the flatbread, the salumi plate, and lobster ravioli, and the gnocci (there were four of us). Everything was great! The gnocci was delicious- moist, light, and pillowy. The peppers, stuffed with goat cheese, were fantastic, and the flatbread was very good. I didn't try the caesar salad, the gumbo or the lobster ravioli, but all three looked good (and I was told they were). The salumi plate didn't stand out as anything extra special, but it was good, and came with an interesting mustard. 
I did order an espresso after our meal, and that was tasty. It was bold but smooth, and came with the customary piece of lemon peel. Everyone else ordered a dessert, including an ice cream dish, a banana cream pie, and tiramisu. I tried a bite of the banana cream pie, and it was really fresh-tasting.

A review of the entrees - 

The scallops, which we ordered as an appetizer, were well-cooked and -seasoned, with some fantastic charring and garnishes surrounding a velvety interior. Although the pieces were large, at nearly $10/scallop this felt overpriced.

For the main, I had the small striped bass, a whole, deboned/deheaded poached in olive oil . The texture was fantastic, the sauce was light and complementary to the fish, and the portion was massive - well worth the $32. Three at the table ordered the salmon, which they seemed to enjoy. The jambalaya and ribeye seemed to be mediocre.

The side of creamed spinach was huge - easily enough for two.

The malassadas (donut holes) weren't very pleasant and the sorbets were unmemorable. Our bill came out to 650 for six largely due to wine and multiple orders of scallops. 

With some menu previewing, a small group could have a great experience here. Pricing disparities are counterbalanced by generous portions and good-quality food.

We made reservations for 5 of us and were seated promptly upon arrival.  The ambiance is dark and sultry.  It was nice to be seated at a table that could have easily fit 2 more people.  We actually 2 people servicing our table for the entire dinner and they were fantastic and on the ball!!  To start I ordered a spinach salad with goat cheese which was served with a whole bulb of roasted garlic. 3 words:  UH-MAAAAAAHHH-ZING!! loved the garlic it was served with.  The table also ended up splitting Lobster mac n cheese which was to die for!!  i don't even like lobster but it wasn't too sweet and the mac n cheese was extremely creamy and the dish wasn't too rich.  For my main course I had the linguine with clams and bacon...SUPER DELISH!!  it was a thick cut bacon with a white wine sauce that had just the right texture and consistency.  Sometimes they can be watery but not this one!!  We had a trio of desserts including coconut cheesecake, bananas foster and some kind of donuts filled with cream.  I don't even like coconut but the cheesecake was DE-LISH-SHUS and those donuts were ON POINT!!  Was not a huge fan of the bananas foster which is usually NOT the case but the other desserts made up for it!!

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT based off of my experience. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!",5yISknhzLiZY3TSDjgSIIg,0,0,5,oi-verDfuwYTBx-TwyYLXg

We came for lunch. I pre ordered the rib steak the day before since they do not regularly serve it for lunch. And it was with it. Cooked perfectly, and great flavor. The truffle mac and cheese was fantastic as well.

I would come back.

Only a 4 star rating since it does seem like eating in a mall.",NjX9gA250gs-wzLrFvvNkQ,0,0,4,AB7SqDj55c2eZ0zHBq26Dw
