23252,2017-02-23,0,21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw,"Terrible. I was quoted 15 minutes for a delivery of three easy hot sandwiches and calamari. 1 hour later we were still waiting and had to call to see where our order was, they didn't even have our name down for the order and had to find it by address. The lady which was the same lady who had taken my order suddenly changed and said typical delivery times are 45-60 minutes.....had that been told to me I would've drove the 10 minutes there and back myself. Not to mention she had a snotty attitude, But an hour and a half later everything shows up luke warm and soggy. I'm assuming they forgot about it....bottom line Do not go there they don't deserve to be called a business. Good waste of 40$",OYp0Z9TZi4oDpvu-7EZLGA,0,0,1,crjHWQMA68M1mHMfKLt_PQ

We ordered a specialty pizza and there was almost no meat on it. When we called to let them know, they were rude and stubborn. The girl on the phone offered us a credit on our next order so my husband said he wanted to order another pizza now. She didn't understand that this was the same as offering us a new pizza with actual meat on it and refused to place the order. My husband was upset enough about it to bring it back to them and they still refused to acknowledge that there was a lack of ground beef on the cheeseburger pizza. We are saddened to say that we won't be ordering from Angelina's again after this. It's a shame because we have had great service and quality food up until now.",wnkCOlXC9aFwshJKE1MBAg,2,0,1,B6bGUQnoZ2v30aRL0nREmA

The next to orders were the same pizza, but looked completely different when they arrived. Same pizza 100% different look. I wasn't to phased by this. They were inconsistent yea, but I had only ordered twice. Just got my 3rd/4rth order tonight. This time the pizza was covered completely in lettuce and mayo.. I always order a cheeseburger pizza. But it has never been this absurd. Don't get me wrong, after i peeled off all of the crazy amounts of lettuce covered with mayo it was a delicious pizza. But still very inconsistent. This pizza was LOADED with limp brown lettuce and mayo. I used to work at papa johns and one thing my location prided itself on was a consistent pizza. Even when I quit that job I only bought from that location. Maybe I'm spoiled with consistent pizzas. But for such a good tasting item, you'd think the restaurant would want to keep the customer coming back. I will most likely order one more time from this place. If the pizza isn't what I got the first time i ordered it.. I'll just find a new pizza joint. Great tasting pizza, when you get what you ordered. Other than that I've demoted the restaurant down to mediocre at best. Hope they get there ""stuff"" together for my 4th/5th order. I will order again, but I will not specify my order. I will ask for  the same order I've asked for in hopes of receiving the first pizza I got. If I don't get it, no more pizza from here. It's not too much to ask for a decent pizza.",Ga6_Pwv6aemSurmbVB3bHw,0,0,3,00ERIMdfSF0tTEuv997cCA

I broke into it and found large clumps of dough - called the place and they said theyd refund me for the raw dough calzone LIAR!!!! Its a good thing a was smart enough to take a video of the raw dough calzone before throwing it away. Had super stomach problems from it. I reported this to the Southern Nevada Heath District and will be forwarding them my video. The worst part (besides the cramps) was they never apologized and they straight out LIED about the refund-Charged the total to my CC. This is the Las Vegas angelinas.

445043,2013-02-06,0,21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw,"I've had Angelina's before, delivery has always been a little slow.  BUT, this time, I was at a friends house, and he wanted to give it a try.  He asked me what I thought.  I said it was pretty good.  I like the pizza.

He called in an order.  Pizza and an order of Calamari, with marinara on the side.  

1 hour and 4 minutes later, during midweek, ordered at 9pm.  Nothing going on in town or TV, that should hold it up this long.  OK, slow delivery is no big deal.  My friend kinda gave the driver a bit of a hard time, but he did say he didn't blame him for the hold up.  Driver left.

Pizza was cold, not luke warm, COLD.  Calamari?  Way over done, was chocolate brown, not golden.  Cold, and tough as chewing rubber bands.  They were the frozen, pre-made kind.  No big deal.  Just drop in the fryer. How hard can that be?  WAY OVER DONE!  On top of it all, NO MARINARA to dip them in.  So we're both eating a slice, because we're starving at this point.  My friend gets on the phone to figure out what could be done for us.  After saying the pizza was cold and there was no marinara, he was put on hold, then disconnected.  CALLED BACK. She got on..... said what was wrong, plus added the calamari was rock hard.  After chastising him for eating some of the pizza, she offered a discount on the next purchase.  Didn't talk amounts.  My friend said that wouldn't do.  He wanted it re done, or a refund.  She said the manager would be back a 11pm and to call then.  She didn't want to deal with it.  

With a bottle of Pepsi, it came to $30.  What a waste of money, for product that would have cost them less that $5 to replace, that would have kept a customer and gained a new one.

Not only was this his first and last time ordering from there, but I recommended Angelina's to him.  So guess what? THEY LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER TOO.  They need to train their employees to have better manners, and some customer service skills.  Their current rating reflects how the place is being run.  The owners should be embarrassed and disappointed.  Good luck staying in business when there is a pizza joint in every strip mall.",MLOT_Q6ZcNqsTligvQAI1g,3,1,1,TdsFVQR7dBHH9T9qGc8TWA
445436,2012-04-12,2,21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw,"I've ordered from this place numerous times being that it is close to my job. I'm a bag of lazy bones when it comes to bringing lunch to work so I tend to order out A LOT. I would have to say that Angelina's is the top place that I order from.

I've gotten a bunch of different items from their menu and I have never been disappointed. So, let's go down the list from some of my favorite items:

1. The Chicken Ranch Wrap - by far, my favorite item from their menu. The wrap is chockful of great flavors. The chicken is slightly crispy, the lettuce is fresh and the red onion gives it a nice kick. The ranch sauce they mix in is wonderful - not too much, not too little. It's $8.95 for the wrap and you get your share of greasy french fry carbs. You can't beat it! I'm definitely stuffed after I eat it.

2. Ricky Bobby Cheesesteak - I'm not a huge fan of BBQ sauce so I prefer it without, but other than that, this cheesesteak is delectable! American cheese, delicious steak, sauteed mushrooms and a mix of onion rings makes this dish one of my top favorites. The best part is the onion rings. When I bite into the cheesesteak, I can a taste of all the different flavors and a slight crisp from the deep fried onion ring batter. Mmm mmm good!

3. 8 Wings with Fries - They have a ton of sauces to choose from. My favorites, hands down, were the garlic parm and the sweet chili. The sweet chili has a little bit of spice but enough of the sweet flavor to keep me grabbing for more wings. The garlic parm ones were nicely doused in a sea parm and every bite is full of garlicky goodness.

I've never eaten at the actual establishment, but I'm quite content with ordering delivery or take out. The woman I speak with every time is pleasant and they conveniently have my work's address saved into their system for every time I order. Delivery time averages about 45 minutes around dinner time and I haven't had a problem with cold food from there. I absolutely love this pizzeria - one of my favorite places to order from definitely compared to the tons of pizza joints in Vegas.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken gyro and I ordered fingers and fries with a drink and dessert. Our total comes up to $35. About the price I'd normally pay at a sit down restaurant, but fine. Delivery time of 70-90 minutes. That's a little excessive don't you think? Ok, whatever. Food finally arrives, my boyfriend is waiting downstairs outside.. See's the driver get out and proceed to his trunk where he pulled our food out of (What in the world?) 

Fast forward to eating... Not only do we both have cold, soggy fries, the fingers are soggy as well!! Mushy texture, very unpleasant. Boyfriend said he didn't even think it was chicken in his gyro. Couldn't even eat 2/3 of our food. Went to dessert which was the only somewhat, appetizing carrot cake and chocolate later cake. Carrot care was really chewy, not cake like at all. Chocolate cake had a weird after taste.

Once we got the food is when I noticed and called the restaurant location of which was provided on my grubhub app. The lady on the phone was very quick to deny it was her location and said to try another one. I called two other locations and realized it really must be that first one. I called and she was still quick to deny it but finally decided to take 3 seconds and look up my delivery address and she soon realized it was her location. She then blamed the missing item on the grubhub driver saying it was his responsibility to check the items and I informed her it should be both the restaurant to check the order list to prepare and the grubhub person to make sure the right items are being delivered. Long story short she told me to call grubhub and I told her she should have some sense of taking responsibility and want to help me resolve this. She said she would place another order and have it delivered. I then got a call from grubhub saying they credited me the item and nothing was being delivered. The grubhub associate was kind enough to give me a $7 credit to reorder  so I did just that so my associate would be able to have a lunch. Unfortunately there's a minimum order amount and also a $4.99 deliver fee so even after everything I had to pay $15. The lady at the restaurant was so quick to pass blame and not take any responsibility for her mistake and made me go on a wild goose chase just to find the originating restaurant. I work in a high pace customer service environment and just to see the lack of interest in helping us was very disappointing. Also the driver needed some major help figuring out where to bring the food and I was pretty specific on the directions in the app but the driver was at least kind and that's all I could ask for. I didn't even want to reorder from them but I needed to get my employee his lunch so I reluctantly did. Two thumbs down.

Why? Just look at the number of items offered on the menu. If you're not already ready to order, keep reading. 

Hours of operation. You can get some good food almost round the clock. 

Taste. The food delivered on taste.

We ordered a cheese pizza, mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers, mango habanero wings, cheese cake, a Dr. Pepper, and a bottled water. It was all delivered promptly, piping hot and with all the necessary dips and seasonings. They even gave us cups and straws for our drinks. 

The cheese pizza was good, mozzarella sticks were a tad soft but the flavor was there, jalapeño poppers were great and large, husband said the mango habanero wings were on point, and the drinks are hard to jack up so there you have it.

Don't really understand the negative reviews as we didn't experience any poor service, long wait times, or misses on the food.

This time I ordered through uber eats and I wasn't disappointed with them at all. They were fast, efficient and they handled the problem that the restaurant made with a positive attitude. I ordered the fettuccine alrdedo meal which comes with garlic bread and a salad and I also ordered a slice of chocolate layer cake. Let's be honest I was most excited about the chocolate cake as it was my cheat meal and I never eat sweets! The delivery showed up just 20 minutes after me placing the order. I tipped the driver, went inside and checked my order to see that they had not given me the cake but of course charged my card. On the uber eats app you can send an email right away saying you were missing an item. I also called the store and they let me know they will either send the driver back with another piece (which I would've preferred because I'm a fatty) or refund the cost of the cake to the uber eats account and that the restaurant will call me back to let me know what was going on. The restaurant never called me back or did anything other than let me know that the person packing the order forgot to put the cake in the bag. Uber eats called me just 5 minutes after sending the email and let me know they have refunded me the cost of the cake plus tax and that they were sorry for the mistake on the restaurants behalf. I was very pleased with uber eats for correcting the problem. I shrugged off the cake and ate my salad, which after seeing had brown patches of lettuce I should not have. The pasta was decent but the salad kind of ruined my appetite and almost immediately my stomach started to hurt. I have been awake since 3 am Vegas time in and out of the bathroom with vomiting and diarrhea that I can only blame on Angelina's as it is the only meal other than an apple that morning that I had eaten all day.

I ordered the 14"" pizza with 2 sandwiches special for $21.99. They said it would take about 30-40 minutes - I called them after waiting for an hour and she could only tell me that the driver had already left. They finally arrived at 1 hour and 19 minutes after I ordered. 

I ordered sausage mushroom pizza, tuna sandwich and Philly cheese steak. The pizza wasn't hot so I heated it in the toaster oven and was still pretty good. The tuna fish was really good as the bread was fresh. The cheese steak filling was sparse and after sitting for awhile got a little soggy. I'm pretty sure it would've tasted good if it didn't take them so long to have it delivered. 

Based on my experience from other Angelina's I'll order from them again but will suck it up and pick it up from the Angelina's on Post Street.",kVAy8nol_GefMbR7awm5TA,7,0,2,hXJQIQmfQ6old6iFol8Org

So another 30 min passes and finally the food arrives (this place is literally less than a mile from our office so I figured they must have been really busy which is why it took so long). I was willing to ignore the fact it took so long to get to us (ordered just before 12pm and didn't arrive until about 1:30 I think it was) until we dug into the food.

We ordered a special which had a 18"" pizza with one topping and 10 chicken fingers. The pizza we got was bordering luke warm bath water temperature and cold. So we had to heat up our slices before we ate them. And the chicken was the same temp, not even hot!! AND they were dry! Ordered them mild and they were still looking like a plain chicken finger! We also ordered fries with cheese which was the only piping hot item we received and was actually pretty good (we thought); they used nacho cheese, yum. 

My two stars are for the ranch and cheese fries because they were the only things we truly enjoyed. Will not be back here. Unless I feel like burning $39 for cold food.",FTZdbIhC4Rccd6phcO86Ug,5,0,2,JSYQoV7BWlyIDp9jcgocmA

After we finally got our check we waited to have it collected, but they never came, so we walked up with it. They took the checks and one person in my party received a $10 bill as change on a just under $10 check, so after the bad service no tip because he surely was not going to leave a $10 100% tip after the bad service.

Silly me I gave them a second chance and had food delivered which my wings order was wrong. So I called and spoke to the manager. At first he was polite and after I informed him the issue and them once he came back to the phone his attitude changed. He said hid cook said he made the order right and started yelling at me. I asked him why was he yelling at me...his response was because I was upset. I told him that is not how you handle someone who is upset. A few days later I called the corporate number since the same guy owns all the ones in town. He was out of town with personal issues and was told that I would get a call back. The lady assured me since she was his sons personal assistant. She also said that the manager was new but still excuse. This happened a few months ago and never been back.,ru2MiluYr_tYWxh2nAhUlQ,4,0,1,XNKibPdkClB5MoJx-ywEng

A guy answered the phone, only to put me on hold several times before passing me onto a  girl who took my delivery order. After getting off the phone, the total didn't sit well with me.  I ordered 2 salads, an 18"" cheese pizza and an order of garlic balls. The total came out to $47 which was absurd.  Almost all of their items increased by $2-$3 over the course of maybe 3 months. I found this information by looking at their rates online. I called back and the same guy answered. I asked why I was charged the delivery fee when every menu I saw said free delivery on $30, I spent $47 and was asking for a delivery that was maybe half a mile away.  He 'placed me on a hold' or so he thought. He just put the phone down, told the woman who took my order that I wanted a refund on my delivery fee (which is NOT what I asked for) and she replied by saying, ""Bitch, really?!"" I can't believe you allow such rude and disrespectful people to be employed here. First of all, I was going off the information YOUR company had on the physical menu and online menu provided.

The first time I ordered lunch I ordered the lunch special of 8 wings with fries with a coke & a 3 layer chocolate cake. Ok, so 1st issue was that I ordered my food around 11:30am...food didn't arrive until almost 1pm =/ ok cool I got over that because I was STARVING. 2nd issue, I open up my meal & realize that instead of 8 wings there was only 6 =( that highly disappointed me because I did pay for 8 not 6 but whatever. 3rd issue i finally get to the dessert & the cake looks so yummy so I'm super excited to dig in, so I taste the frosting, it was to die for, I get to the actual cake & to my surprise it is dry as heck. =/  So those are my issues with the 1st order. P.s. the wings & the wing sauce ((mild)) were pretty good. I enjoyed them.

2 days later I order again, let me make this short & quick, I ordered a much larger order because I got some of my co-workers to order as well. So we got the chicken strips & fries, spaghetti with meatballs, mozzarella sticks & fried mushrooms. Ok, the fries & strips were really good. The spaghetti was ok, not the best, but not the worst. The mozzarella sticks & the fried mushrooms were NOT good at all, the mozz stick were super dry & the mushrooms were just gross. Another issue with this time, the delivery time sucked so much, we literally waited almost an hour & then some. 


Ok, moral of the story, i really like this place, yeah it has its flaws but all in all its OK. I have yet to try the pizza & some other things on the menu but honestly so far based on what I have had from there, I would say on a scale from 1-10 I'd give Angelina's a 5 1/2.",eXskPeD93RFw6E6kRSjepQ,0,0,3,DP_MXupOUbni1PHj0si5Vw

They told us the delivery time would be in 30 minutes to an hour, and it came in about 45. The delivery guy called our cell phone when he got to the hotel so we could come down and meet him.

This is at least 40 minutes after my initial call.  I am told it will be at least 20 mins and offers me a free dessert or free drink.  Ummm, how about comping the meal??  I continue to wait.  Finally the order comes out and it's almost 1hr 30mins since the initial call.  To make matters even worse, upon arriving home and getting the food out to eat we did not receive the salads that come along with our dinners nor the garlic bread that also accompanies the dinners.

After placing the phone order on our way back to our Shop, the location mind you is less than a mile or two from our Shop, problem number 1 happened, it took them over an hour to get our delivery delivered. I even had to call to follow up with the order. Then problem #2, my Credit Card. My CC doesn't have raised numbers like traditional cards do, it's flat. We told them over the phone that this was the case. Once the delivery driver showed up, he had to call in to confirm on how to process my CC; see they still need to imprint the CC like if it was 1982, who does this still?? Oh, THEY do! I called & spoke with a female manager and I asked if they were adamant on not taking my card because of no embossed numbers ans she very nonchalantly said correct, we will not. Then I said, then you need to refund me my charge. She, once again very nonchalantly & very perky, ok, no problem.

Ive tried several different items from there huge menu the funny part is Ive never tried there pizza but here are a few items I have tried...

The 1st thing I ever was the Fettuccine Alfredo it was generous portions of saucy creamy goodness I was surprised at how tasty it was being that most pizza places don't have the best tasting pastas.

Next time I ordered from here I tried the wings i got half Garlic Parmesan and half Hot wings bone in and they were very tasty and delicious, not to mention I must say they have the best ranch dressing Ive ever had in my life so i really enjoyed dipping these tasty critters into there wonderful ranch dressing. 

next time i tried the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich which was very yummy how can you go wrong with a good quality chicken patty hot sauce and mayo hmm hmm good.

Last but probably my favorite item Ive tried at this place was their Philly Cheese steak OMG juicy, flavorful, cheesy goodness this by far is one of the best cheese steaks Ive ever had I could of sucked down 2 of these tasty things my mouth is watering just writing about it. This is definitely a must try if you go to this place.

I absolutely love this place Ive never found a place where everything Ive tried on the menu is truly delicious and i must say they are reasonably priced. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because when I order from here I do delivery and it takes about an hour for me to get my food, other then that there is no going wrong with Angelina's.",hv_M1Kf1EPWDBB1bgnzu6Q,7,5,4,NfrlZe1ec5mNc9R7CE7ryA

An hour later I called to check the status and he told me they never received the order and the best they could do was start it now and it would be another 45min-1hr before it was delivered. Considering I received a confirmation email with an order number, I knew that was false. I contacted Eat24 and they were very helpful; they contacted the restaurant and spoke to Keith also. He told them that he confirmed the order and didn't make it due to it getting lost in the lunch rush. He also told them that he offered me a discount which he absolutely did not. So I called back to speak to a manager and Keith told me that ""Steely"" (don't know if that's the correct spelling) was not available and even if she was, she wouldn't do anything about it. I asked if she would be available if I came into the restaurant and he said she wouldn't be available then either. I have a shop full of people that I needed to feed and now we all look bad.

The Good
- Garlic cheesy bread was ok, but I think most places don't really know what ""cheesy bread"" is (see my village inn review)

The Awful
- The wife and I were the only people in the restaurant, they took 15 minutes to give us water
- Workers were too busy on their cell phones to pay attention
- When we told them we needed a minute to decided our order, we didn't mean another 20
- The pizza we received had the texture of semi-solid grease. There was absolutely no flavor on the pizza we ordered. I took one bite and threw the slice on the table in disgust. I couldn't taste the cheese, the crust or sauce. I had flashbacks to the 99 cent microwave pizzas I bought when I was just a mere dirty basement kid. 
- The waitress asked us if we needed more marinara sauce for the cheesy sticks. We said yes and she gave us more. Only to find out we were charged another dollar. I was pretty tilted on the fact that she phrased it as if it were standard to get extra marinara.
- The marinara sauce was not good

The most upsetting thing about this place was that it was Voted ""Best of Las Vegas"" so I had high expectations. I also say that I generally don't complain about the service, but that only applies to places that are worth the hassle.

This place pretty much inspired me to write on yelp again.",UER4m0CBVgcFlVbMqhCvCg,5,1,1,Hdk-1bDuKUf6AsZxxbbcIw

Just got a pizza & wings with some cheese fries (cheese on the side) & asked for everything to be extra crispy- well done - COOKED LONGER THAN THE MINIMUM!
When you order food it's usually due to a lack of desire to cook- not wanting to turn on your oven/especially during the vegas summer at 120 degrees! But with exception to pizza- the other food was seriously SOGGY! Crispy wings & fries should be a given at any fast food place with a fryer so idk what went wrong. The simplest of ideas like poking holes in the styrofoam of a fried item so it stays crispy was not even applied in their delivery preparations!  I don't know that much about it but even I know that!

I ordered a thin crust Hawaiian pizza for delivery and it had no marinara sauce as a base. The pizza was cold and flavorless. I had to add meat to it in hopes it would taste better after heating it back up in the oven.

Service with their new manager (Danny IS her name she has a thick accent) is terrible. I called to complain about the pizza. I just couldn't eat it and I did try my hardest to eat it. I asked for my money back the current employee who was kind, told me to call the next say when his manager came in. So i did. She offered me credit and I said no. I wanted moneu. Then for 20 minutes she argued with me about how she didn't know how to put money back on the card saying the receipt didnt say it was by card (though i have a duplicate receipt that clearly says it was). She proceeded to tell me she couldn't give me money back because it was already the next day. I said it shoulsnt be too hard since it was at midnight. She said she would call her supervisor but I'd have to wait til Monday to get it back. HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. if you couldn't get it because its from a previous day, then how do you expect to get it 3 days later?! 

So then I called cooperate left a voicemail and the Manager(Danny) called back 20 minutes after; giving me my money back to the card. So in other words, the bitch acted as if she didn't know and was playing games with me so she wouldn't have to give me my money back.

I suggest staying away from the pizza so you don't waste your money.

I always get their handbills stuffed in my door and after ruining my dinner I decided some baked ziti sounded good and Id give them a try since I hadnt recycled their handbill yet.

I was one of only two tables on a Friday night and it took 5+minutes for one of three servers to come over and greet me. 

Once I was greeted my attention was drawn to Jessica who Im guessing was the shift manager.  She was sitting in the middle of the dinning area on the phone with who I'm guessing was her boss/owner.

They were discussing shop talk at first but then it went to an upset customer. There she dropped the f bomb 4 times the s bomb twice and damn/hell a couple times each.

Since she was out in the open Im guessing they dont have acess to an office but venting unprofessionally and with vulgar language like that puts your patrons in bad moods and ruins the dining experience. Whom ever they were talking to should have asked them not to use that language or even better asked them where they were located so as not to impact the patrons in the restaurant.

My server was top notch. Answered questions about the menu and even changed the channel on the TV so I could watch the Cubs game. 

Ok, ok the food. The zitti wasnt bad. Not great but had good flavor. Of course my stomach decided half way home it didnt agree with my taste buds and I just barely made it home.

If Jessica hadnt been venting on the phone Id excuse the mad dash to the bathroom I had to do and give it a 2nd chance but a combo like that I cant excuse and won't be back.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,6,3,3,ujodTijdN07tLlWC5uuY4g

The woman in the front is unbelievably rude and won't listen to a customer for the life of her . She cuts you off when you just have a simple question . I've never been so upset . I can not believe I have to wait this long for two pizzas and a 32 oz soda . Never coming back .,BILLiMcjsI9G0SaLwzT_vw,0,0,1,9WhsGKYb2x-TRf7PHOMlaQ

Tonight, guy on phone was super nice, but the food was not. Was told an hour and 20 minutes for delivery, which seems excessive, but ok. 

My wings (hot and garlic Parmesan) were ok ( garlic, but no parm) wife's burger sucked and her fries were cold. 

I had ordered fries with my wings.... And extra ranches. Well the ""ranch"" was blue cheese and the fries did not come with the wings (even though I paid for them)

Called back. Guy on phone super nice and professional again. ""I'll get some fries over to you."" 40 minutes pass and I'm done with my wings and have no fries. 

Called him back and said the the fries were surplus to requirements now and that I was kinda pissed. He offered for a manager to call me tomorrow. Again HE is professional. 

Either the kitchen or the delivery guy (or both) sucked big time tonight.  Will not be ordering here again.",N6EEjh_LOfmXDh-I13NKbQ,3,1,1,261SM60jpaIiWPYwiQM6Pg

While they conveniently delivered all the way from Russell/Decatur to my home near Charleston/Rancho, they delivered the wrong order.  If the food had been at least edible I would have just kept it and avoided the drama, but it was not.  The food sucked, so when they then refused to make it right, I had to get in the car and drive the food all the way back to their restaurant for a refund.  A complete waste of time, bad food, poor customer service, and worse yet, I still have to go find something for dinner.",7biETSHudbJrvy0Jp5AkBA,4,0,1,SR5-XJitOguldXgi3EsZhw
