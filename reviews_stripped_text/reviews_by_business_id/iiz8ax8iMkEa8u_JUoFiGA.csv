489662,2017-09-05,0,iiz8ax8iMkEa8u_JUoFiGA,My side order is Sweet mango Habanero dip sause. And gave me hot sauce. Make sure you check your order when delivered so you make decision if this happens again cancel and don't pay. They're fucking stupid. Don't know what they do with my habanero they take it home. Really stupid.,V6yQLMGmW7hWZ-mRK2mnBg,0,0,2,v-cXbt-KF2s8T3XLvrloFQ

I've carried out at different locations such as the one on Simmons and Lake Mead in North Las Vegas (don't go there.. they make their food so sloppily) and no one is as good as them.

My favorites there are the mango habanero wings, chicken alfredo bread bowl, lava cakes, (OMG yummmmmmy) and their hand tossed pizza with chicken and bacon. 

I seriously eat there every week. I'm going to blow up, but I'll blow up satisfied haha!",NceveOgvp3QJoz-i0IJGPQ,0,0,5,Z8S-fUL9xxzzzTLpbPHYoA

I even doubled checked my order and it said peporoni pizza, red sauce and CHESSE!

I tried calling the establishment and my call was never answered. After I place my order and get it I see that the staff  is rude and did not take my orders correctly. When I told them it was not right they refused to help and just went about their business. They pizza toppings were wrong the there wasn't prepared correctly. It felt like there wasn't enough sauce.

I strongly suggest to STAY away from this location. Maybe try Pizza Hut.",MxY6TivSj2Gq9zvmf58PkA,0,0,1,0mw78Op5rXIUkMYiWWpoyQ
1611874,2010-08-30,0,iiz8ax8iMkEa8u_JUoFiGA,"I ordered from the website for this location.  Luckily enough it also gives you a tracker to tell you where your pizza is in the process.  Unfortunately for them it showed me that the pizza was out of the oven and sitting in the store for about 30 minutes before it even left with the delivery driver.  I don't mind waiting for pizza, but I do not expect it to be 40 minutes old by the time it gets to me.  On top of that I complained and was told that they would give 2 LG free on my next order and the credit was on my account (ph#) wouldn't you know.... I call and nothing was there no credit, no nothing.  Lucky for me that there lots of other choices for good pizza in the area.",9PLDiKZqqVmelPMrBfAgwQ,1,0,2,F3BKvRX-_JpwOHMJG8Irog
2054561,2018-04-11,0,iiz8ax8iMkEa8u_JUoFiGA,"I really like this Dominoes location. I spoke to Carlos, the manager, tonight to use my pizza credit from a previous order. I was so delighted by Carlos' demeanor and quick help, that I am writing this review now. Friendly, helpful and there is never a problem with fixing a mistake... because no one is perfect.
It is because of the little mistakes that I can't give 5 stars, but the pizza is so very good, a great value and ordering online is easy and rewarding (although I feel that if I order 6 pizzas that I should get 1 pizza free... but instead it is set up for 10 points for every time you order, no matter the amount, and after 6 orders you get a free pizza....).
Thank you Carlos, and thank you Dominoes Pizza.

Update: Today's pizza was made SO PERFECTLY! That I am upgrading my review to 5 stars! I love it! 
Thank you SO MUCH! My whole family LOVES it!",_OA07atEc_kx-idAzuzJ_A,0,0,5,8taqK8onLtDvrpPuMgh7Ew
2210509,2014-12-16,0,iiz8ax8iMkEa8u_JUoFiGA,i Can't believe the customer service i just received from Maria the Manager of this place i called to make a complaint and she started to argue with me on the phone and once i asked for her name she hung up on me and i had to call back to get her name and she continued to argue with me and then i asked for her district managers number and she continued to argue and told me to call the 800 number without giving it to me. i will never go to dominos again because of this experience. everyone should stay away from this place. from a once loyal customer which would order every week.,BmTqgJPvSfFVcikZg2ON7Q,4,0,1,BXAS6BZ1NAALnIujRUuzsA

He was very friendly, professional and accommodating. I was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I came back in 15 minutes and my order was ready. No over promising and under delivering here.

When you call the location they act so nonchalant about it remember stealing from the bank is a federal offense yes people they withdrew 500  dollars from my son's . For dominos sakes I hope they give the cops the information needed and we will also be getting a hold of the news I'm sure he wasn't the first this has happened to and if dominos keeps these theives as they're well then what does that tell us about domino's hope this helps anyone they rang his card the same day of his original purchase 5/23/16 and then had the nerve to withdrawal 500 bucks today 5/29/16  from a bank of America BEWARE AND STAY AWAY !!!!",F6catI6IapITWB_SbmcGgA,3,0,1,aUEBzHPJvkY5YAJHOX84bg
3440226,2015-01-05,0,iiz8ax8iMkEa8u_JUoFiGA,This is what I received from dominos when I ordered pizza online. This black debri was covering a hole on the pizza itself. It is truly disgusting and unacceptable. The lack of care that our food is prepared with how can dominos expect me to eat this! They offered to bring me another pizza but I will no longer order or eat dominos pizza. It is unacceptable and to deliver something like that  who knows what is in it. The manager said well if you don't want a pizza what do you want me to do. Of course I don't want another disgusting pizza I want my money back I'm not going to pay for something I'm not going to eat is what i said.

3706006,2016-11-23,0,iiz8ax8iMkEa8u_JUoFiGA,"Absolutely horrible service!! They have messed up our orders 3 times in a row now. The last order we put in was wrong again, so we called and asked for manager. A gal named Samantha was put on the phone claiming to be the manager. But her professionalism was anything but.. she just flat out was rude repeatedly to us, although we gave no reason. Maybe she was busy but that is no excuse to be rude. We will NEVER order from this dominos again, maybe from any. We've had called food and wrong orders but the rudeness of this so called manager is unacceptable. I really hope her superiors read this and proceed with action. I would never allow someone like this work for my company in a managers position.",zhhwlzUwpn2kmw6u53N_Rg,1,0,1,zdKbF_yiw3RzAhxnQrq_XQ

I get there 15 minutes after they called and the lady told me they gave my pizzas to someone else because I didn't answer the phone. 

And that they called six times.  LIAR there  are only four calls on my call list within about a six minute interval.  No voicemail to tell me they're giving my food away.  

 One of my family members likes it and that's the only reason I ordered there, personally the food is terrible there anyway.  There are an awful lot of pizza places, who needs them.",C_waPGy3fXHtLYlmyDCEqw,0,0,1,d-58OZdgWKUnuKBherk5yw
