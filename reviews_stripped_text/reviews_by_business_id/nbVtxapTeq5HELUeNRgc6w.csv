I am also born and raised in Chengdu Sichuan so we know what the authentic dishes are and what they are supposed to taste like. Sichuan Express captures every aspect that I  expect from these dishes. Their dishes are tasty and spicy, which is what we love. I highly recommend coming here if you're in the mood for not only authentic Sichuan food but also Chinese food. Also the servers are extremely considerate and can help you pick what to get if you need help. I will definitely be coming back here in the future.",XtG28J2NjZS9NhSdPlo8Kg,0,0,5,E_4PaAorRaTuHpa4VztlTw

Service was ok. If you could get their attention they were very friendly and helpful. The problem there lies in getting their attention. There were only two tables when I was there (ours and one other), yet it still took for ever to get someone to look our way. They seemed to be always preoccupied either staring back into the kitchen or just staring out the window.

Their cooking is extremely oily, and they use the cheapest, grittiest, grainiest beef; the smallest, hives-inducing shrimp; the weirdest burnt garlic-Szechuan-wannabe seasoning in the vegetables; the weakest, most corn-starched clay pot I've ever seen.

Ended up here because my visiting dad saw a misleading ad in the local Chinese newspaper and insisted that we eat here. 

To add to your pain, you *will* get hit with a surprise, $1 per small bowl of white rice charge. There were three of these rice charges on our check. This is unscrupulous and out of place in the local Asian restaurant market.

Okay, amazing was taking it a little too far because not everything on the menu was as awesome as I thought, but most of everything I ordered were awesome - and did I say fresh already? Lol. Price-wise, I'd say average. This is not fast-food Chinese like Rice and Noodles (I also love that place to death because they always make my ""special requests"" perfectly), so you can't compare the price to that. However, compared to the prices of say, KJ Kitchen, the more authentic and popular Chinese restaurant in Vegas, then the prices is about the same. You guys know what I'm talking about if you really do dig Chinese food. 

Both my experience there was really good. The waitresses mostly spoke English (quite well too), and were extremely helpful and nice. I'd go there again just for beers and their cold dishes. Cold dishes are popular as an appetizer to Chinese people, but I've rarely ever tasted fresh ones since I was little. So I kind of grew up disliking it.

Their Dan dan sauce was nice and spicy. (at least it was not sweet!!) After eating 1/3 of it. It became just plain noodles. No taste. I don't know why they skimp on the sauce. Bummer.
