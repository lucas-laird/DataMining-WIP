It was so loud half the show was unable to hear anything, and she refused to use the electrical hookup we provided!! When she was told it was a problem, she said tell the manager! Only a few people got food there, so I don't know if it was any good, mostly she just stood outside of it smoking. Rude and snotty!",p0eEY7k38JcKzA__jYyc2w,0,0,2,0XjpsFt3-0GJ-AnCn27XVA

But as their food started to come out I couldn't resist making my own order. I got the carne asada quesadilla with guac and sour cream. The meat was delicious. The only draw back I have is that it could've had more cheese. The guacamole was very good and fresh. I asked for a side of salsa verde. It was very clearly homemade and spicier than most places, which to me is a plus. I tried my friends burrito which was also very good. In addition to the good food the truck is ran by a very nice woman and her mother who does all the cooking. They were very kind and helpful. I'll definitely be finding this truck again to try their Cuban sandwich.",iblCaA2vrVchrGgTsKoaXg,1,1,4,b6q_SEschZj6gNiy5-09sQ

Worst place ever!!! I have to select a start in order to post my comment!!!!",QlyE1rlCSlF9CPGHCg0Vlg,0,0,1,efTHkBfhmjWzTXqcxIMIWw
