In sushi: salmon, eel, shrimp roll
In grill: yaki soba, shrimp tempura 
In desert: green tea soft ice-cream, mocha cake, and of course fresh fruits

Staffs are very rude. Maybe they are too busy or we caught them at the wrong time. I don't feel like I am in a restaurant at all. Instead of a fabric table clot, well they do have fabric table clot but they put a giant peice of paper on top of that (like a crawfish place). After each customer,  they only remove the paper.

To all those yelpers looking for quality sushi @ $20...it's called a buffet, not a high touch white glove restaurant. I don't understand how people complain about buffet's not having top quality? 

If you are pushing HUNDREDS of sushi or sashimi/hot food/udon/dessert on the trays to some hungry convention goers, gamblers, and party goers then I would say that the quality would be somewhat sacrificed.

That being said, Todai is just as good as any other all you can eat Sushi-Sashimi place. The place is clean, food was what you expect from sushi buffet's (it ranks up there with Minado in Morristown NJ or Long Island) and the service was prompt and polite.

The sushi isn't that great.  In fact, of all the times I have been there I barely eat any sushi unless I ask for a specialty item like the uni nigeri (they only give you two at a time, but I mean...that's understandable.  I wouldn't want to waste loads of sea urchin of some nub who thought he'd like it and didn't).  I usually stick with the tuna and salmon sashimi, poki salad, and cucumber salad.  I've never eaten off the hot bar.

And I eat the desserts, of course.  They offer a decent selection of petite desserts.  My favorite is the red bean paste cakes.

But back to the atmosphere--it is a nice place to hang out with a group friends if you don't mind paying a good deal for average food.  The restaurant is very open with fun decorations like octopus tentacles hanging from the ceiling and bright colors.  They don't impose a time limit like some all-you-can-stuff-in-your-pie-hole sushi places (one time, we were there for almost two hours..) or gripe if you leave rice on the plate.  I've never ordered drinks there, but I think they charge per glass on pop.  Water for the win.

674062,2009-06-07,0,zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA,"Went to dinner with a very close friend of mine who was visiting during the Memorial Day weekend.  I've been doing the research into Todai's/Makino's for months, but I really don't want to go to a buffet by myself.  (I guess I'm weird that way.)  Our eating habits: the only thing that consumes more than me is fire, so any place is fine with me; she is a vegetarian who eats fish, eggs and dairy products, so I am always careful and mindful of her dietary restrictions.  Since I haven't had sushi/Japanese cuisine for quite a while, we went here for dinner.

I've only been to one other Japanese buffet (in the States), and that was Minado's in Framingham, MA.  That buffet was good; my mission there was to eat my fill of sushi (and other Japanese delicacies, but sushi primarily), and I went there two different times.  They had a nice selection of foods, and I was happy I went.

Todai's is another beast altogether.  At least twice the amount of choices available (as compared to Minado's selection).  Some stuff I've heard about, but was never able to try (like the spicy Hawaiian poke). I seriously tried to take a sampling of everything, but to tell the truth, I was so hungry by the time we got there (last meal was dinner the night before) I knew I should have worn a bathrobe or a hospital gown.  My attempt to sample a wee bit of everything failed miserably; when I got back to my table with my plate, the waribashi was a blur from the plate to my face.  (I should have asked for a Diet Coke, ha ha ha.)  I do remember, after walking back to the Luxor and climbing into bed, we both had the sushi sweats.  I swear, when I find someone else to go with to Todai's the next time, I'll take it easy.  I really need to plan buffets a lot better in the future.

Ooh, the recommendation.  Yes, go to Todai, and bring your appetite.  Dudes:  let's cut through the fluff and just wear your sweatpants.  Ladies: I know you want to at least give the appearance of being ladylike, but indulge yourself.

I wasn't impressed during lunch hour due to lack of selection here.
However, I gave it another shot due to its oyster bar during weekday dinner.

Well... food was far better than lunch.
Oyster was good, but doesn't come to the station that often... 
Not that  much sashimi selection(salmon/tilapia only)
Sushi is somewhat average...
Udon was ok...
Teppanyaki- Shrimp is so so whereas beef quality was quite low.

Yeah, the problem happened when I used $25 restaurant.com voucher.
My 7 mth son started crying and he and my wife went outside immediately in order not to disturb other customers. 
I asked bill with voucher and waited for 20 minutes, yes, 20 minutes!!!
Finally, my server came to me and said there was voucher validation problem... Ok, I understand, but can you please update me earlier rather than leaving me unattended for 20 minutes? what an excellent customer service! 
She told me the bill reflects discount even though they couldn't validate it... haha what a joke...

The crab legs were small and all snapped up by the patrons in less than five minutes. Sushi was unimpressive with a lot of rice for one sushi roll. It was not as fresh and until the tray was completely empty, only then would they refill it with fresh sushi.

And this was a perfect option for us because my boyfriend is not the biggest fan of raw fish and there were plenty of cooked options for him (and raw options for me) ;)
The food tasted really good and it was very enjoyable.

I haven't been to one in a long time and so I can't really compare it to the times I went to Todai with my family in San Diego back in the good old days...(I haven't been to the San Diego Todai in years either)

But I do know that the atmosphere was not that interesting. I did like the decorations but as far as being a nice dining area, it's not really, I think the one in San Diego is more intimate. A woman interrupted us to take some pictures but I guess that's what comes along with being in Las Vegas.

Stop by a Tix4Tonight booth on the strip and by yourself a $2 coupon and the buffet will cost you about $27, so about $29 total before tax and tip.   We went there on Wednesday night(10-9-13) and once again the Snow Crab legs were decent size, fresh, and delicious.  They're not already opened for you which some people may not like, but I prefer them this way as they're kept more fresh and don't dry out.  The sushi was again very good for a buffet, especially the sashimi.   Probably the best sashimi and overall sushi selection at a buffet in Vegas.  They have other hot foods also, but their seafood, sushi, and sashimi is the best bet and well worth the price of admission all by themselves.  Their prime rib was actually juicy and good also on this particular trip, but still not at the level of other pricier buffets.  The biggest surprise on this particular visit to Todai was the raw oysters.  I usually never eat more than 1 or 2 raw oysters at any buffet including Todai because they're typically not 'fresh', no matter how fancy the buffet is.  But this time the raw oysters were completely fresh with a perfect slightly salty taste and no strange after taste.  So I had about a dozen which was a rare treat.  The desert bar is fairly minimal, but my choices of chocolate-covered strawberries, pumpkin pie slices, and creme brulee were delicious and sufficient.   Overall, if you want all-u-can-eat good seafood and a solid selection of other foods and you don't care about having a fancy decor, you just can't beat this buffet for the price.

When I walked in, I was a little disappointed by their overall selection, it was a bit meek.  I wanted some crab, and they had a lot of it.  The crab was absolutely disgusting, it was inedible in fact.  I rarely take things out of my mouth, but I simply could not stomach it.  The few sushi selections they had were alright, which was what the two stars would be for.  When we were asked what we wanted to drink, I wanted green tea, as well as my wife.

I think the important thing to remember sushi is how fresh the raw food is. The sanitation was also top notch. Our waitress was on top of her game and ready to take out finished plates out of our way.

I am a fan and I have been here every time I have traveled to Las Vegas on an empty stomach. Although it may be a little expensive, I would pay it because it is worth it. Come on, as much sushi as you want until your heart explodes! Complete win for me!

It not only serves unlimited sushi (quite a variety, I might add) but also some unique side Asian salads, some classic Asian entrées (fried rice, chow mein, soba noodles, etc.), even some classic American favorites (mashed potatoes and gravy, roast beef, bbq chicken, etc.), and a very, very nicely done dessert area filled with the perfect sized treats that make it so you can eat more than one and not feel guilty. Some sweets that they have include: cheesecakes (a variety including green tea cheesecake), ice cream (including green tea flavor), chocolate/stawberry mousse, cookies, cakes (including green tea flavored), jello, and everybody's favorite: a fresh crêpe maker.

The sushi is fresh and is made tinier than normal sushi-- ostensibly so that you can try all of the different types of sushi without getting super full, which is nice. I came here mostly for the udon. Warm noodle soup after a long night in Vegas? Yes please! I do think that there are better sushi buffets in Vegas (e.g. Makino), but Todai is not a bad option if you're looking for more general seafood/something more than just sushi.

Inside it's spacious and has the same decor as all Todai's. Oddly, even though there were plenty of open tables when my group of 8 stopped by, when we asked to switch to a table closer to a TV, it caused kind of a ruckus. Other than that, the staff was very nice.

Unlike other buffets, you have to pay extra for drinks, which is kind of a pain. Also, beware-- they clear away the food after lunch, so even though they may let you sit in the restaurant for past the lunch hours, all the food is sadly gone.

tl;dr: I don't really have anything against Todai. The food is good and plenty, but Todai is a chain, and I don't necessarily think you have to go to Vegas to enjoy it.",aSUmRlQxraEBVRnhpx9l9w,1,0,3,Qmp8slXjn05JoFhiHzx23w

Even when they open at 5:30 for dinner, there are people waiting. Staff is smiling and prompt,  the fresh and large buffet selection awaits. Service was attentive, but as others have pointed out, silverware and napkins are out on the floor and need to be picked up separately. Minor irritation that there are plastic cups available for condiments by the prime rib station, but not by the cocktain sauce or tempura sauce stations- odd and a little inconvenient. Not to mention the soy sauce on the tables but no cups for that, either.

Highlights include the make your own udon and dessert crepe sections, the veggie tempura spread, and of course- the seafood. No, the quality isn't what you'll find at the nicer AYCE places off-Strip, but the fish is super fresh and there is a small selection of sashimi, and the quality IS better than your average buffet. 

I really liked that there were about 12 rolls out on display, with labels. No confusion about what random roll I was eating, and the pieces weren't packed with tons of rice. I rather enjoyed that the pieces were cut small, so that I could try a bit of each rather than just a few before filling up.
In addition to sushi and sashimi, I also filled up on poke and shrimp cocktail, my usual buffet stand-by. Crab legs are also available at weekday dinner, but I did not partake.

EDIT; two months later, I'm subtracting a star for lack of consistency. Raved about this place to a fish-loving friend and visited for lunch just after picking him up from the airport.

My wife and I wanted to try it last year during our vacation to Vegas, but ended up going this time around instead.  It was a complete waste of time and money.  I can't say enough bad things about this place.  My wife and I may be a little spoiled when it comes to food, so maybe that's part of the reason we hated this.  

The sushi was luke warm, much of it was mislabeled and just overall terrible.  My wife had some kind of ""tuna"" that she ended up spitting out because it was so bad.  I had a bunch of crab legs and those were simply ""ok.""  I also tried a couple of the warm dishes such as the teriyaki chicken, which tasted like it came from Panda Express.  I'm not a huge fish person, but I've grown to like some rolls and sashimi.  This was worse than store bought boxed sushi.  With that said, I went for their ""prime beef,"" thinking there may be a glimmer of hope, but to no avail.  It was gritty and bland.  The potatoes were out of a box.  My wife had a $12.00 glass of plum wine that she couldn't even finish.  You definitely want to avoid a place where you can't even get a decent glass of wine.

The other patrons were rude and the lines for a crappy crab roll were insane.  People elbowing each other and physically pushing each other for some horrible seafood cevechi.

Ultimately, I felt like Clark Griswald in Vegas Vacation when Cousin Eddie takes him to that buffet place and loads a potato sack with rolls.  ""I'll have some of the yellow and don't get cheap on me,"" completely applies to this place.  There are plenty of other options in Vegas to waste $35 per person on food...

By the time we finished forcing our food down my wife and I both feared for food poisoning.  We were literally sick to our stomachs and grossed out by this dining experience.  Luckily we didn't get sick.  In the end, I probably should have complained to management, but that's not really my style.  I'm sure they wouldn't have done much.

Anyway, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!",lpIavO4GNKF4dg974eq40Q,0,0,1,Wti9w1647Wu3ynejEpIXAg

First plate snow crabs yes. It was big and good but I don't like cold crab legs I need them hot with all the good seasoning like how Gvr  did them. 

2nd and 3rd plate shoyu ahi poke, loaded with sushi, sashimi, and oysters. There was snapper and there was ahi they looked similar to the average eye then that news article posting a while back came up.  If they switched the ahi and snapper ill just eat my moneys worth in oysters.

The next few plates come and went in a blur, I was already full and only took tiny plates to pace myself just to eat things I really real wanted. There was shrimp tempura, asparagus wrapped in bacon, baked salmon, stuffed mushrooms.

There was turkey and prime rib but all dry. Some soups and salads and other hot food but not even close to was the website listed. Wanted some blue crab

Good choice in desserts. creme brulee, some fruit tarts and cakes, creeps and green tea ice cream but again not as.much as what the website listed.

Maybe they have a better selection on weekdays.

One dish you can't screw up that I always get is the udon. The noodles are sweet enough and you can add as much seaweed, fish cake, and spice as you'd like.

I wouldn't recommend getting the sushi rolls because you can't tell what's in them anyways / their ""labels"" don't explain which is which. So instead go for the nigiri, it's not the most fresh sushi ever, but it still tastes better than piling on endless amounts of ""toppings"" and calling it some absurd roll like a 'cats paw roll'.

Lastly, I suggest you stock up on the tempura because it's something everyone loves and it's not very difficult to make / screw up.

In Todai's defense, it is pretty decent for all you can eat.  

Sure the piles of rice under the nigiri are like mini footballs designed to fill you up fast.

Sure you gotta beat down six groups of families just to get to the crab legs.

There were loads of vegetables, but they were heavily doused in a thick-and-shiny, oily coat of what I presumed to be margarine. Why couldn't they have just cooked the vegetables in water, maybe add a touch of salt, some spices?

I've been here before for lunch and know that the food here is PHENOMENAL. Still not sure I peaked inside, saw crab legs and knew that I was going to get my money's worth. I did it right tonight.

You'll find a nicely decorated restaurant. Pay attention when checking  out the place. A fruit bar, in the middle of the restaurant, is an octopus that comes from the ceiling. How fitting for a sushi joint. The restaurant is well lit, clean and has a hip and trendy yet casual look that fits nicely into Vegas. My guess is that this place gets more than just tourists like me. I'd bet that locals come here quite often.

You'll find all types of sushi: typical California rolls to octopus, to different variations of tuna and salmon rolls.  I had a very significant share of their sashimi. Easily $20 worth served in any sushi restaurant. Their crab legs were not only delicious but the crab meat came out just perfect to dip into their melted butter. I think I had eight raw oysters, an easy $15 in any restaurant back home in Virginia Beach. They even serve hot foods to cater those who are intimated by raw fish. I tried a small piece of their prime rib and really enjoyed their flavorful bacon wrapped asparagus.

I finished off my fat kid adventure with an okay tasting green tea cheesecake. But what I really enjoyed was the strawberry-banana crepe offered in the dessert section made in front of me.

The best part of my trip here was my request for wet naps because of my sloppiness with my crab legs. I was expecting those stupid packaged wet naps you get at the store. Nope. We were given hot wet towels! Simple, but a short and awesome experience after a delicious dinner.

Okay, so I'm not often interested in spending $32 on my any meal but I will certainly come back again...perhaps even on this trip.",n5NatlzIpc17OOvAFqujHA,2,3,5,a1zjb7tfKuqlanxqzFQUzg

They carries most kinds of food like any other asian buffets as you expected: sushi, crab legs, shrimps, salads, tempuras, stirred fried vegetable, fried noodle, fried rice, beef, sausage, dessert including crepe served by order, 2 flavors ice creams, cream brûlée, cakes, cookies. You can name it. BUT
1. They place foods on the show cases just little, only bring some more when the foods almost run out. You might get a new hot dish if you have enough time and patience.

3. Table and chairs are as much standard as you might see at some affordable restaurants in a China Town.

3293747,2012-09-30,1,zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA,"In the land where the buffets are boss, do people really still prefer Todai? Evidently the temptation of Japanese seafood is too powerful to resist as even I have been here on multiple occasions. Through it all, there are better Japanese AYCE spots in the city, but what it may boil down to for most is the warm comforts a chain can bring.

The Miracle Mile of Planet Hollywood is no stranger to franchised storefronts, after all its the back bone of so many Vegas entities from casinos to restaurants. Where this Todai comes into play is the fact its the only Japanese branded buffet on the strip, where as anything similar is usually a hodgepodge of Asian items. Todai isn't really uniquely Japanese per se, but it is a great place to burn some moolah for a heap of food.

What should come as no surprise to anyone, Todai on the strip carries a semi-hefty price tag ($35 per person), especially during their dinner hour. I personally believe if anyone is going to throw down some bucks, let it be during dinner. Their full arsenal of ""the best stuff"" is likely to be on full display.

While the array of sushi rolls are visually appealing, they seem to be heavier on the rice and decorations and just a tad too skimpy with the meat. The same idea applies with the nigiri sushi. While the crab legs are plentiful in numbers, the actual legs themselves don't have a lot of substance. I'm not too hot on the hot food (pun intended), but I will shoot for the occasional baked claim, even if its loaded with mayo and crappy spices. 

Whenever possible, shoot for the sashimi, which includes more than just salmon and tuna, but yellowtail, white tuna, and scallops. It may not be overly fresh (just sitting on a bed of ice), but it represents the best of their raw selection and is probably the only way to get one's moneys worth without having to shovel endless food in your mouth. Unfortunately, many others will be adopting this philosophy so the sashimi inventory gets cleaned out pretty quick.

While everything noted has been generic and such, the two stars really comes from a lack of quality service. Sure, its a buffet and people are really serving themselves. But the service industry in Las Vegas is regarded as one of the best in the world, especially any establishment in any of the resorts or along the strip. I understand I'm holding Todai to what might be an impossible standard - but there is no excuse for being ignored for drinks or dirty plates almost every visit here.

Pros:  as much decent tuna and salmon sashimi as you want
lots of rolls and nigiri to choose from
The sushi rolls have good flavor and seem fresh
shrimp tempura
creme brulee
chocolate covered strawberries
actual Asians eat there (reassuring...)

Cons:
most of the rolls have fake crabmeat and/or cream cheese
most of the rolls do not have as much fish as I'd like

Then went for the fried rice, chow mien, lettuce wraps,  fried shrimp, gyozas,....etc. everything we ate was tasted pretty generic, typical, replica, Asian food. what else can i say other than eating as much as i can for what I paid for. 

services was OK from what i saw. it was bad enough that they opened late. we got seated and asked what drinks we wanted and practically didn't see the waitress after that. They refilled our drinks by carrying pitchers of the different soda, water, tea with them. They cleared out any empty plates on your table.

I basically stuck to everything else but the sushi. The dessert was delicious though. My favorite was the chocolate cheesecake.

My advice, you're in Vegas, and for about the same price, you can for sure go to a much much better restaurant. Try something that you don't normally see. I live in Northern California and Todai is around a lot.

There were about 5 types of rolls and 2 types of sushi. There was no sashimi. They did have some ""tartare"" which had some sort of spicy dressing on top of it. My guess is to disguise the fact that the fish is not fresh. The crab legs were leaking water. There was more water in there than crab meat, showing that the legs have been frozen for a long time and was recently thawed.

Eventually I just parked myself near the oyster station and snatched those up as soon as they were prepared just so i could make the dinner somewhat worth the $34, although I would've had to eat a lot more oysters to get there.

The first time that my husband and I came here together (I'd been coming for a few years prior.), we were here for a while. It's not that my husband hadn't had sushi before I came along, only that I actually broadened his food horizons. In addition to sushi (this is ok), there is a custom cooking section (good, but there is a slight wait time), hot foods like tempura (try the yams), stuffed shrimp (good), and teriyaki chicken (kind of fatty), a cold salad section like seaweed salad ( I love this salad) and a handful of others, the crab legs (better than most casino buffets- really favorful- we like to get a full plate of this) and full dessert section with ice cream, cheesecake bites, carrot cake bites, cookies, and candies (seriously you will want to try some of these delicious sweet things). Since there is a huge selection, it is hard not to find something for everyone.  

Since I don't want to be sick and get rolled out of the restaurant, I pace myself. I only get what I really want and I save room for dessert- ice cream, of course! My rule is two plates of food. I want to be satisfied but I don't want to overdo it. I use the rule of moderation. 

The service is excellent. The staff is very attentive and eager to please; filling drinks and taking the dirty dishes away. It's nice that there is a bathroom in the restaurant. There are numerous tvs all around and there is music playing (but you can't hear it if the place is pretty crowded).  Also, don't forget about the crab- it's really good.

In the AAA coupon book (AAA customers- you get this at the customer service desk, upon entering the center via the parking garage), there is a 10% off coupon and I believe that there is an ongoing Locals promotion, of 10% off.

The sushi was good, very small which was a good thing so you wouldn't get too full and tired from eating the same roll and they had a crepe station as well!  They had dessert and they were all mini too, so cute! but the strawberry cheesecake was pretty dry so I had to pass on that and just got a crepe instead.

The sushi was just basic sushi that you can get anywhere probably for a cheaper price. The meats, prime rib, roast pork, were beyond dry. Yes, I understand that it comes with gravy and au jus, but when a meat has to rely that much on sauces for flavoring, then the chefs definitely ruined the meat. The udon center was a joke. The noodles were frozen noodles that you can get in any convenient store, and the miso broth tasted like they simply used ramen packets to flavor it.

I have to preface with the fact that I am just not a buffet, or AYCE sushi girl because I just don't ever seem to be able to get my money's worth without making myself miserable. So..... MOSTLYY (yep meant to put that in there) I avoid these types of eating establishments. However, doing some entertaining with friends/family in town, and the BFF wanting to try this place for such a long time, I decided to suck it up and go. And not so surprisingly I was soooo miserable when I went home. However the food was very delish. The selection of Sushi that they had (for someone who really only likes a couple of different kinds of rolls) was a really nice selection covering several different likes (IMHO). 

After the sushi was done, it was time to check out some dessert (yes, even with as miserable as I was, I could not pass it up). There is a table at the far end of the buffet line that has mini desserts (which allows for tasting quite a few of their yummy desserts) a crepe station, and a ice cream machine that the lady behind the table has to serve you. It was sort of a bummer that the person waiting for a crepe was blocking the yumminess that could have gone on my ice cream but I just didn't want to be like 'dude, move along, she'll let you know when the crepe is done' but I didn't. I just got my plate of lotsa mini desserts, teeny bowl of ice cream and went back to my table to devour it all, and feel quite satiated from there.

I am not sure when we will make it back. When we are back down in the neighborhood we might consider dropping in again. However I am new to Vegas mostly new anyways... and I have lots of places I would like to get around to :-)",RdMD77Uwe8Mjy_EptbPa3g,1,1,4,IQcFdGwpeY4W2FBP5fPu9g

The worst part was the walk from the strip to the restaurant :)
Pricey, but when you consider the prices of the other buffets on the strip it is not bad.
Stuck with water since this was already at the top of any budget I wanted to spend.

I felt I needed to eat my money worth and set forth to do so.

I enjoyed the sushi, especially since when it was really bad you didn't have to eat it and you didn't feel like you were wasting money by not eating it.
When you found a sushi you like you would have to go up multiple times since there would only be a couple pieces on the buffet.  Not sure if this was because of the hour or it is how they always stock it up.
Was it awesome sushi? Not really comparing it to a sit down restaurant paying by the roll, but it was awesome sushi for a buffet.

The hot food was decent, the fresh grilled octopus was delicious, the first batch had been there a while and was extremely tough.

The Udon soup was very flavorful and you can decide what you wanted in it.

They have a tappenyaki station which I never even visited, my daughter would be so mad at me :) 

I am not much of a dessert person, not that I needed it, but I tried the green tea ice cream which was pleasant.

Server kept the table clear of empty dishes and was prompt refilling my water.

Great choice for someone wanting a major sushi fix and has friends that want something besides sushi.

We were seated right away as it was lunch on a Thursday. To my surprise, the restaurant wasn't busy at all even compared to other restaurants inside the Planet Hollywood. All that aside, I rushed to grab my first plate. My first plate consisted of different kinds of rolls they had and some nigiri. They had your everyday california roll to spider roll, dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, caterpillar roll, and even 'chef's special' roll. All the rolls were good, although nothing special. I did like one of their rolls but I cannot remember what it was called. It was shrimp tempura stuffed with rice and something else, but it was pretty good. All the fish used for nigiri sushi was fresh and it wasn't too overloaded with rice which is very important in my opinion when it comes to sushi. 
For my second plate, I got everything else they had besides rolls. They had several kinds of tempura (shrimp and vegetables), chicken and beef variations, fried rice and noodles, and, to my surprise, turkey (random). Their tempura was good, as it was crispy and not so greasy, just how I like them. They also had Teppanyaki station, but I didn't get to try because I was already stuffed. Now their udon is the good stuff. I don't expect much when eating udon at a buffet after trying udon at Makino at the Premium Outlet on Charleston (their soup for udon was terrible). Todai's udon was great! Their soup was very well flavored, without overusing artificial flavor (not sure about this but it didn't taste like artificial flavor loaded soup).
Their desserts are not bad. I had some green tea ice cream which was good and 2 dollar coffee with refills? not bad not bad.
Overall, very satisfied. Food was great, service was good, and ambiance...not bad. I would like to go back in the near future.",5PhGjB3gaWXgdOjZb3UyGA,0,0,4,ePevKL48kOuKSpzI42im5A

I probably ate three pounds worth, and while not the best I've ever had, it was certainly good enough to do the trick over and over again.

Even the desserts were numerous and delicious-- definitely the first time I've had crème brûlée at a sushi joint.

Nothing special - that about sums it up. They were very stingy with the nigiri sushi and I had to make a request for tuna. The ""chef"" made me two pieces, but didn't refill the serving tray. I kept an eye on him with the plan of getting more, but he didn't during the next 30 minutes that we were there. 

Overall, I liked the shrimp tempura with a dipping sauce, salmon sushi, & the over-sized Sprite. Frankly, I was most thrilled that I didn't get the intestinal travel blues since we had tickets for Mystere that evening.

Loosely made rolls, dry sushi rice from sitting in the open too long, imperfectly cut sashimi (I'm hoping they don't use a butter knife to slice fish) -  all these details started to bother me.  That's the problem with chains - quality isn't there.

The location is good.  You can just do valet right outside Planet Hollywood (east side).  So, if you're a tourist or don't know any better, Todai might be ok until you try smaller AYCE sushi restaurants this city has to offer.

       - Value - They buffet would be a really great $25 buffet, but charging $32-$34 for dinner seems a bit steep. For that much, Bellagio and Wynn is a much better bet.
       - Sushi - Everything I enjoyed at this buffet aside from the salmon sashimi (which you have to fight for because everyone keeps taking it) was not sushi. For sushi, there are many better AYCE sushi places that aren't buffet style.
       - Downhill - They use to mini lobster tails or baked prawns. Now they have tiny baked shrimp. It seems everything about this place has gone one notch down.
       - Ghetto - They were using butcher paper to cover the tables that had tablecloths on them. Is it that hard to wash a tablecloth?
       - Yummy - A lot of the non-sushi items are quite good, such as the crab and baked shrimp. However, for this price and the fact that this is a sushi buffet, I think they've missed their mark.

I'm absolutely convinced that last Fall's bout of food poisoning I thought I was going to die from was a direct result of their oysters.  But the missus likes the place, and well, you know how that goes.  I just avoid the oysters like they are cursed.

I'm generally okay with Todai as long as I make smart choices.  I've always thought it's a little pricey (when Yama Sushi has a much more fresh tasting menu for a cheaper price), but we went for lunch yesterday, and lunch is a cheaper meal.

Except for yesterday.

What should have been a $20 dollar meal turned out to be $40 a person.  Why, you ask?  Mother's Day.  So let me get this straight: To celebrate the love and all of the wonderful things our Mothers have done for us throughout our lives, the restaurant decides to celebrate Mom by charging double their regular prices on the same meal selections they offer the other 364 days of the year?

God, I'm going to dread seeing how they decide to honor our Dads.

Seriously, no balloons, flowers, nothing.  The server made no mention of the price doubling, though they maintained they had a sign out front.  And to their credit, they did... in a fairly discreet location that you could miss if you didn't go down the right walkway to get into the restaurant.

The people in front of us complained, as did we, and the manager very nicely apologized and gave us 20% off the meal's cost, though it was still more than what an average lunch would cost.  No incentives or unique items did not make it worth it.

I imagine I'll be back as the missus loves this place, and well, you know how that goes.  I just felt it was sneaky to double the prices, make no real mention of it (even on the website), and offer nothing to justify the ""value"" of this upgrade.

Dress ranged from cutoffs, muscle shirts, and flip flops to khakis with button down shirts and dresses.

Food Presentation:  We arrived at 8:00 PM, and although the buffet continues to seat people until 9:30, we were surprised to see so many empty or close to empty trays on the buffet, and many weren't restocked while we were there so it is hard to say how good the buffet might have been if it was fully stocked.  

Sushi:  The sushi was okay, but was in no way close to really good sushi.  The pieces were small which was okay since you can have as many as you want.  They were not well put together, and most fell apart when you picked them up from the buffet line.  If they didn't fall apart there, they certainly did when you tried to eat them.  Several pieces were tasty, but most were very bland with little flavor.  The texture ranged from marginally chewy to almost grainy.  The salmon was by far the best piece we had.  

Rolls:  There were lots of different rolls available, but the labeling of the offerings was all messed up.  California rolls were marked as spicy tuna, and something labeled ""Shrimp Tempura Roll"" was ..... well I don't know what it was, but it was NOT shrimp tempura.

Seafood:  For a place that bills itself as a ""Sushi and Seafood Buffet"" there wasn't much seafood beyond the sushi.  They advertise dungeness crab as a major offering, but the crab legs were only served cold, not hot.  And they were so salty that a salty food lover with us said that it was TOO salty even for her, so I didn't even try it.

Salads:  The salads presented were also ""okay.""  Frankly I wasn't very interested in eating too much salad in an all you can eat sushi and seafood buffet,.

Hot Food:  The hot food was ""okay"" as well, but again, it was NOT great.  There was a station presenting hand carved prime rib,  pork roast, and grilled sausage, except that there was no one manning it, so you couldn't have any.  I waited about five minutes at the station, making eye contact and waving to every employee running behind the station before I finally got someone to come over.  And it looked like these offerings had been under heat lamps for many hours and perhaps they were because the meat was very dried out.  There were several  trays of baked fish and other hot entrees that had only a very small amount of leftover food on them, and what was left there was dried out and very unappealing.  Perhaps they weren't going to refill these until someone took the last remnants, but looking at the dried up remnants on the corner of a large tray made me decide it wasn't worth trying.

Dessert:  This was both a high and low point.  There were a number of good offerings in the dessert line, the chocolate covered strawberries were really good.  there were also a couple cookies that were very tasty.  The low point here is that they offer a ""build your own crepe"" station which looked great.....except that they didn't have anyone manning it to make crepes, rendering it useless.",KF10eZ4ljJ-MtqKb_KXVbA,0,0,2,-hlqOxELXLuO4tewXxUYZw

Everything was very tidy and neatly organized. The tongs and spoons were clean and they did a good job of cleaning up the stuff that missed between heating table and plate.

However, needing to satisfy that raw fish urge that follows me everywhere I go now, we decided to eat here one evening while our carnivore friends did something else. Besides, we had a 10% off coupon and it was within walking distance. Sometimes that's how the choices are made.

I was so excited! A seafood and sushi buffet! I just couldn't imagine what all-you-can-eat of my favorite things was going to be like. I thought it would be amazing for sure.

There were plenty of things I could've loved here. Unfortunately, no way to possibly try it all. I pretty much settled on sushi alone, and then added some tempura prawns and veggies towards the end.

The sushi was ""ok."" So, now I'm becoming a connoisseur I see and can actually tell the difference! Ok, so perhaps this experience was a good thing. There was nothing wrong with it - it just didn't have the same wonderful wow factor that other sushi has given me. But, I persevered and tried almost everything they had set out. The nigiri was better than their rolls and got snapped up quickly by the predominantly Asian clientele  dining here. The tempura I had later on looked fabulous but did not really deliver in taste.

Had I not just been to an all-you-can-eat crab fest last month, I'm sure I would've enjoyed the piles of Snow Crab legs served here, but I skipped those. Tons of other offerings, but little me just wanted raw and I can't consume much, so I didn't try the other choices of Korean BBQ, 3 kinds of soups, stir fry, and lots of cooked fishies. Desserts looked great and Larry had a plate full of those.

Service was fast and friendly with our waitress coming by constantly to keep my teacup full and clearing plates.

In the end, I felt the price had been somewhat high for the quality (around $28 per person to dine here with the discount) and then later on when I was back in our room, I found a 20% off coupon in the hotel magazine. Damn! Wouldn't have made much difference of course, but I hate it when that happens. 

I probably would try a different place the next time as I saw other sushi buffets mentioned that sounded better. I'd give 3 stars here but I just felt the price for quality wouldn't justify that.",-WCFrbKuWQLF96Yp4ei4fg,2,2,2,oxqFZfe5ZFt0KQ1gMCS8XA

There is a plethora of sushi and other seafood to choose from.  If you don't like sushi, then there are plenty of hot entrees to choose from as well.  You're sure to find something you like.

Don't forget to save room for dessert.  The crepes are made right there in front of you, and they taste delicious!  There are plenty of mini desserts to choose from and sample.  All of them are much better than the ones found in Chinese restaurant buffets.

I started off with the sushi and thought it was decent. Some pieces fell apart which made it hard to eat but it still tasted pretty good.  Then, I had chow mein. I LOVE chow mein so I'll pretty much eat it everywhere I go. It was definitely decent but not wow I need more ASAP. I also tried the Udon soup and I really enjoyed the broth.  The tofu they put in my bowl did not taste good with the broth though. I felt like the tofu had another taste that didn't fit well with the brother. The desserts were super cute! They're bite size and pretty good. I tried the flan and the chocolate piece of cake. It wasn't outta this world but I still ate it. After the server dropped off our check, she never came back. We got our waters refilled from a server who was refilling everyone's water. The service as well as food was satisfactory for paying about $23 each after tax. The atmosphere was the nicest part probably, more than the food. I say if you want to eat A LOT then it's worth it. I was wearing a slim dress so I could barely breathe after my 2nd full plate! The food is good enough where you can eat large amounts. I think I didn't eat enough because I didn't recognize some of the foods they had so I didn't try it.

They offer a slew of sushi selections, some sashimi, crab legs (usually only at dinner time), a selection of hot Asian entrees, a selection of salads, some made-to-order noodle soups, and a variety of tastes-like-it-came-from-a-box desserts (one exception:  the made to order crepes are delicious).  

I'm usually a quality hound when it comes to food, but there is nevertheless something truly delightful to me about all-you-can-eat sushi, even if it's a hair on the mediocre side.  I just love it so much and can never get enough of it - except at Todai.  Todai indulges that little girl within me who keeps saying, ""More, more, more!!!!"" even when the adult Michelle knows it was time to stop a while ago.

It does get crowded, so coming at off-peak hours is your ticket to not having to wait.  Also, check out the ubiquitous coupon books that you can get in the cabs and on the street in Vegas; they often carry coupons for a few bucks off at Todai.
