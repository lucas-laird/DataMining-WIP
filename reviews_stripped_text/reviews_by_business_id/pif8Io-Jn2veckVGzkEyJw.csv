Thinnest crust I've ever seen on a regular pizza. Both pizzas were supposed to be stuffed crust but were both hollow inside. We were quoted 30 minutes but it took over an hour. I've literally never had a good pizza from this location, but never anything this bad. We usually opt to drive to the rainbow location rather than order delivery from this one. They are literally always out of whatever the special pizza that's being advertised is and the quality is horrible. 
There are too many pizza options in this part of town to order from this location. We used to order pizza hut weekly before we moved to this house and now don't just because the Flamingo store is the only one we can order from.
Yay another long rant on Yelp. Not bashing pizza Hut, because it's become my favorite, but I won't order from this location again.",DwwCw2YIE6a8xqPSolbDjA,0,0,1,3HIAY8jfdnj5XZHpEmN7dw

Last few weeks Pizza Hut has a carryout deal called the Hut Lovers deal.
Which is a large two topping pizza for $7.99 carry out only.
The caveat is that you have to specifically say ""Hut Lovers deal"" in order to get that specific deal.
If you walk in and say ""what carry out specials do you have?""
They will deny that they have any deals.

So yet again, after the Hut Lovers expired, they have a new deal called the ""Great Big Deal""

I went in asking if they had any carryout deals.
Was specifically told ""we don't have any""

But if you order using their app, the app will automatically tell you of the Great Big Deal.

So if you're coming in off the street or home from work and want a cheap carryout special make sure you utter their secret society password ""Great Big Deal""

Seriously Pizza Hut?
How about next time before I pay for my pizza, you have to utter my secret password.",FnerkhXZy1M0pgappwZ1TQ,2,0,2,6Rbm1zeBFCTH58k1jzDNzg
