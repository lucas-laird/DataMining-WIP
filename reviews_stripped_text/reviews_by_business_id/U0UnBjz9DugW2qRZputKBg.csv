Strawberry shortcake was really dry & when I bit into it, it crumbled.  Obviously the cake was a few days old, Albertsons would have thrown that 5 days ago.  So as the Napoleon cake.  The Nutella cake tastes good, a little too sweet and ...
So if you're looking for a cake fix, this is not the usual bakery to go to. This is more for a specific market, since pretty much make their cakes baklava like.",jT0wCucDeiY1OObp3vfShQ,1,0,1,RhusqB6tSghd_dsqtUxvqA

I always advertised at my work, to my friends about their amazing deserts. But my visit ended up it all. I asked person about dairy- free product,  I have explained that person is allergic to milk based products. So she told me that packaged baklava is dairy free. I asked again, and she said it safe. I bought with additional lent products. Later I gave it to a person, and he got sick right away. Sales person shouldn't advise anything she is not aware. They used to have another lady there, and she was absolutely amazing,  caring and very knowledgeable. Unfortunately I will never recommend this place anyone.

Than more people came in, she told me to wait AGAIN, until she help other people. I waisted good 30 minutes of my time and wasn't even able to order a came and I left. Didn't have any more patience with her. When I called back to speak with a manager, the owner answered so I was telling her about the issue, she didn't even listen , she kept telling me that lady from day before is her best employee.

I enjoy my baked goods so indulged by redeeming a $5 for $10 Yelp deal.  I went over so paid an extra $5 and some change.  Pricing is reasonable.  I decided on a ""sampler"" of goodies so I tried the following:

Tiramisu cake 
Brandy cake
Apricot shortbread cookie
Apricot crumb muffin
Ponchik (Armenian donut)
Meringues

I really enjoyed the first two- tiramisu was light and sweet & the brandy cake had a very nice buttercream with just hint of brandy (thankfully not overpowering).  The shortbread cookie was a bit dry as the apricot muffin was as well.  That might have been due to the hour I went...I think I went maybe an hour to close ( usually fresher in the morning, right?). The ponchiks were reminiscent of those one ""would get back home"" as my fianc√© put it (he's from Armenia- so I'll take his word for it LOL)

Also, I found the staff at the bakery to be very friendly, polite and eager to help.  That was definitely a plus. 

Overall a 4/5 bc of the dryness of the cookie and muffin.  I'll update the review as I plan to give the bakery a try during a morning hour soon! I recommend trying this lovely bakery!",7P2IdshiNUpQq4FBvuO3pg,1,1,4,_lcGYIMaX2Y7f6FBJucOjw

I never thought that I would come up rating a place.. I've always been a user of yelp for years. I tried what other people recommend. I'm always open minded and taking chances but last night I took a chance of this place.. knowing in back of my head this place has some bad reviews that pastries are old. Anyways, after last night dinner out with the family, I decided to make a detour to check out the place. There were a few foot traffic and staff was friendly welcoming.. so I got more than a couple slices of cakes. First of the bird milk was good! And the rest was not good at all.. srry. The chocolate mousse was horrible even my 9yr.old daughter was like what is this?? Taste like nothing and old without me saying anything.. My family and I love love pastries every time we travel out of state we always yelp and look for pastries bake shops same as we go out of country. We don't expect a lot for this place but sorry to say I'm very disappointed. Hopefully they would improve freshness and moist and taste. (Chocolate cake lack of taste and moist and its old) Thank you hopefully this is helpful for both parties. God bless!",j52l7YscLjfRzPKUC8nFCg,2,0,2,1eweBAHV2u5ihuNrGFVb2Q

Tried several items ( didn't write down the actual names so I will go with the ""Americanized"" names ) :

Brownie, chocolate cake, cheesecake and opera cake.  The brownie was very dense but lacking in chocolate flavor.  The cheesecake did not taste very fresh.  The opera cake was also old and the cake was very, very dry.  We didn't even try the chocolate cake.

The service was good - the lady that handled my order was very nice.  Unfortunately, none of the items I selected have me wanting to return.

Chabbiet - filling too heavy and rich, too sweet.

1254361,2017-12-19,0,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"My husband and I got married in May, and spent a week in Vegas the week of our wedding. We weren't doing any wedding thing traditionally...ceremony at a casino on the strip and reception at a different strip hotel room...food catered by a nearby Mexican restaurant...no bachelor/bachelorette party. But I was excited to find a bakery to make a wedding cake for us. I scheduled a visit to this bakery, not far from where we were staying, months in advance. When my fianc√©, at the time, and I arrived for our tasting, which we were excited for, we immediately felt awkward. They told us to sit at this small table in the corner to wait for the guy we would work with. We browsed through the booklet already at the table, getting excited and inspired, but when the worker who was to run our meeting arrived, he got right down to business, didn't even congratulate us on getting married or get excited with us about this great opportunity. No big deal. But he barely said anything to us and asked us what we wanted to try. We chose a cake to sample and he went away to grab it without a word. Immediately, we felt super uncomfortable. Maybe he thought we were looking for free samples and wouldn't make a purchase...which was wrong. I was determined to buy something if I was happy with it and someone actually tried to SELL me something. I was expecting someone to get excited with us and to give us a reason to spend hundreds of dollars for a cake, but instead, he dropped off our slice, we took a few bites, and offered to pay for the cake as we decided to leave. We had taken a 20 minute Uber for a 10 minute meeting, and left really fast. Do not come here for a wedding cake. Not sure if they get a lot of awful customers for weddings, but we were determined to be fun customers, amenable to any kind of suggestions, but they couldn't even give us that.",RSHbjOxTWqh4qKQkxuQlgA,0,0,1,36tCBGREhxXG4om_bXfBaw

Baklava, sweetly sticky delicious.
Fruited filled pastries with 3 different flavors, the pastry surrounding the fruit was flaky and buttery. 
Macaroons, kids liked them. Got the passion fruit and chocolate.
Chocolate Ganache, smooth, creamy goodness.
Bird Milk Roll, I can taste the condensed milk and chocolate, yum.
Kiev Cake, haven't eaten it yet, but I'm sure it will be great.
Nutella Cake, flaky nutella goodness.
Tiramisu Cake, tastes more like cheesecake with mocha, but still yum.
Whole wheat bread, will make sandwiches with them.

1375837,2014-11-22,7,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"Manan bakery has been on my radar for a while. I always pass by this place without a second thought, wondering if I would ever have the chance to stop in. Temptation had gotten a hold of me, not only when a buddy of mine recommended their macarons, but also when I saw the yelp deal. 

Walking in, there are large display cases that fills the entire bakery. There is a variety of cakes, cookies, and desserts all over the place. I noticed that they also had a large assortment of middle eastern desserts available. That really perked my curiosity.

First, I redeemed my free coffee. Not ""mind blowing"" in any type of way, but serviceable. I ordered an assortment of macarons as well. Let me go on record by saying this, now I don't know if they make all their macarons in house, or if it comes from an outside source, but Manan makes some of my favorite macarons in town. The texture of the macaron is perfect, and the fillings are well balanced and light. This will be my new place to procure them.

Then, I ordered a borek with a meat filling. I've never heard of this type of pastry before, and the owner told me that it is popular in the Middle East. It tasted like a strudel, but inside was a ground meat filling. I liked the taste of the dough, it had a nice chew to it. The ground meat filling was well seasoned and tender all around. Definitely another favorite.

My least favorite item proved to be the pumpkin spice cake. I thought all the flavors were there, and that the cream cheese frosting wasn't too sweet or too runny. But the problem for me was that I thought the cake itself was kinda dry.

Manan will be my go to spot for macarons. I would also like to try some more Middle Eastern desserts as well, they were quite intriguing.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,11,10,4,MRxyxcXlWhBsMgYo2jfpWg

These treats are the best- flaky layers of pastry filled with your choice of potato, meat, spinach, or feta! Delicious, high quality, and oh so satisfying. 

The lahmajoon ""Armenian pizza"" mentioned in other reviews is worth a try- took mine home to heat and eat, an easy lunch when paired with a  salad. Simple but solid flavors, adding Bulgarian feta kicked it up another level.

Grab a $5 for $10 Yelp deal while they're still up, you won't regret it. They have daily specials, like Monday's $1 cupcakes from noon to 5PM. If they ever have a mushroom piroshky to add to the rotation...  I might move in to the apartments next door.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,8,4,zRNxIBle3G971uteV9OLGA

Recently went to Shish Kabob House next door and saw the interior of the bakery through the glass. Curiously decided to step in and see what is inside, I was pleasantly surprised. This is a family operated Armenian bakery with delicious pastries, cakes, macarons, and BAKLAVA! Jackpot!!! Goodies that I love in one place. 

Going to a good bakery usually makes me feel like a kid inside a candy shop and this is exactly what happened. There was so much I wanted to try and not enough stomach space even when sharing with others. This is the best kind of dilemma to have. My mouth is greedy but I ain't ashamed to admit! 

There were many types of baklava and I tried the square pistachio baklava and the triangle baklava. I personally liked the square one more as it is more of a flaky pastry dough filled with chopped nuts like walnuts, almonds or pistachios. It is just the right amount of sweetness. The triangle baklava is a bit too sweet for my taste. It is delicious but not the best I've had. I would still eat it nonetheless. The Russian cake is great and not so sweet as well. I saved the slice of chocolate fudge cake for another day as I couldn't eat anymore, even when sharing. It is still moist and delicious even when it is a day old. Not overwhelmingly sweet or chocolatey, which I like, but given all the other yummy options I would skip this one next time. 

I would recommend coming here for a try. I look forward to more baklava and trying out the other goodies in this bakery. I save quoting great words of the terminator for the rare few, ""I'll be back.""",O_3ceyOjYpXxLxboGfusYA,9,7,4,OHBYwS6wgL_XedbanCFH2A

Their baklava was good but it was a little on the sweet side to me.  I guess I am picky as I make my own baklava. . .and their's just didn't seem to have  good balance in flavor for me which sucks. . .cuz I love to eat baklava and it's a huge long process for me to make it. . .=(

They do have this lebanese flat bread. . .which is like a tortilla with some ground lamb on it. . .that is da bomb!  I will definitely be back for that.  It was delicious.  =)

I have tried thier other sweets and really was not impressed.  And the cakes did not look all that great.  They didn't look that appetizing to me.  On the other hand their breads did look good though.  I am only saying that the appearance was good as I have never bought bread there.  

But the kicker for me is that if you call yourself a BAKERY it is wrong that you are buying French Style Macarons and selling them as your own.  I was very disappointed when I saw this.  I guess I figure that if you are bakery that ALL baked good should be made in house.

The strawberry short cake was dry but still okay. The fruit tart was lovey. They forgot my cheese borek so I call and they give me store credit. Fine, I can forgive that. Mistakes happen! 

Second time I ordered: Looked at their website and saw that there's no delivery fee for under 5 miles. I think great! We're under 5 miles so I don't have to pay that $5. I was wrong, though. Apparently it's only free delivery if you order a cake. That's fine but they should specify that on the website. I ordered the crepe again, it wasn't as good as last time. They ran out of cheese boreks so they give me a meat borek. Fine. The two large eclairs I ordered were clearly defrosted and completely INEDIBLE. The bottoms were soggy, filled with water and the cream inside was not fresh in the slightest. Those two eclairs go in the trash. The 3 macaroons I ordered were FORGOTTEN. AGAIN. I call the store and they tell me they'll give me store credit again. Nope, I know how this works. You'll give me store credit so that I keep buying from this bakery but I'm done. Also, nothing I ordered today was palatable so I paid almost $30 for nothing.

Several varieties of baklava tempt the senses, wrapped in phyllo, kataifi, or puff pastry made in-house. I took home a piece containing walnuts, and was surprised to discover three thin layers of puff pastry, two layers of nut filling, and a remarkably aromatic rose water soaking syrup.

2347851,2014-06-29,1,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"Crispy Napoleon- so light, crispy and delicious! I ordered a huge assortment of pastries and cookies and promptly started on the giant box of cookies as soon as I got in my car. Sadly, these are not the kinds of cookies I like. They were all SOFT, as in like a cake soft. Cookies are supposed to be crunchy for the most part, or at least chewy, so I was very disappointed to discover that every single cookie was soft. They also didn't have much flavor and kinda all tasted the same, even the chocolate ones. And they weren't very sweet which some people prefer but I do not... I ordered 2 of each kind they had in the display and took a bite out of every kind once I was in my car, hoping to find one that was at least somewhat crispy but that was not the case. My husband doesn't eat cookies so it looks like these will all go to waste. I'm going to try to air them out and hope they will dry up in the next couple of days before they go to the trash =( 

The cupcakes tasted good but were slightly on the dry side. I'm guessing because I went at the end of the week so hopefully next time I will get there on the day they were made. You also can't beat the prices. Most of the cakes and pastries were under $3 each!!",vX4zE6Plk7lOlSme_U2lKw,1,1,4,AzWL3vOgRvzwP9S9vwaBNg

When a nurse that I work with told me about this bakery I was excited. Today I decided to drive down with my husband, but the 20 minute drive (so I thought) was worth the drive. 

We arrived to the bakery and the gentlemen behind the counter was very nice. He asked me how I knew about the food and I explained it to him, he seemed pleasantly surprised. 

I pointed out what I wanted and asked how much the Lahmajoon was. 

He asked a girl in the back and she came out and gave the prices.

I continued to choose what I wanted and once I overheard the comments the chick was making about me being ""sev"", I just stood there and looked at her, waiting to interrupt in her native tongue.

The guy didn't hear her so well so he asked what he said, she looked at me and said ""hech"" as if she might have realized that I understood.

I paid, I left still more excited to have some of my favorite treats than annoyed about the stupid comments.

I get home the food was cold and the Napoleon was  rock hard and extremely stale.

I will never go back to that bakery ever again.

There are many European delicacies that are not seen at standard run-of-the-mill bakeries. We ended up choosing the bird milk cake because she said we have never had anything like it, nutella cake, baklava, almond, pistachio, and caramel macarons.

We dove in to the bird milk cake first which is apparently made of sweetened condensed milk. Who doesn't love that? It was creamy and broke apart in my mouth similar to a tres leches without as much liquid, if that makes sense. It was quite good and I would order it again. The nutella, which was right next to the bird milk cake in the display ended up being almost the same, which I was slightly disappointed about. I could not really taste the nutella in it. The only difference really was that it was more of a mille cake with many layers. 

The baklava was the best I've had! It was DELICIOUS. We got the cigar variety and they were perfectly crispy sticks filled with honey and nuts. I will definitely be back for the baklava. Lastly, they had a beautiful assortment of macarons. My least favorite would be the caramel because there was a strong coffee taste to it. I do not like coffee. My favorite was the almond. YUM! It reminds me of the way Jergens cherry almond smells. It was delicious. I will definitely be back to pick up baklava and almond macarons. Come here if you're sick of the standard bakery fare and are looking for something European. You may find a new favorite dessert. Thanks Manan.

We ended up getting the Napoleon, an OMG, and some French macarons.

The macarons were cheap. Price wise, not flavor.  I'd say half the price of the bakeries along the Strip, with the same amount of flavor.  The problem with a lot of local bakeries is that yes, their French macarons are cheaper, but you definitely can tell that you're getting what you pay for.  Not so here.  Their pistachio and chocolate macarons were perfect.

The Napoleon was also very delicious, as was the OMG.

The service was great.  As they have a large selection to choose from, we actually asked the girls behind the counter to help us choose what we'd get, and they were very friendly and helpful.",WTE4gtyCs1eJDSCj2Afo_A,2,2,5,hL2GjMNiJ36V-OzfJ3LI9g

As you come in you see that everything is there in front of you in a wide glass case. You can see that everything is labeled along with the price. I like the fact that the nice lady behind the counter was very polite in answering all our questions. 

With so much eye candy (pun intended), you can literally just close your eyes and point in any direction. What we or should I say the wifey ended up getting was a Waffle Basket ($3.49) and Cappuccino Mouse Cup ($3.49). We also was given a sample of their Napoleon which we almost got but I convinced my wife not to go overboard. 

So we pay and as we start making our way out, we see that on the backwall there is a boatload of assortments of Baklava. I quickly take my wife by the hand and calmly say in a Barry White type of sexy voice, ""Next time baby"". 

The taste? Well, originally we were gonna bring it home and share with other family members. Let's just say this trip to Manan never happened. Oh, that reminds me. As soon as this review is done, I need to go clean up the powdered sugar from the Napoleon off the dashboard. Hopefully none of my family members are reading this review as well. Hi mom! Love you!

In closing, it doesnt help that this place is literally a block away from our church that we go to all the time. I guess as long as im there to keep an eye on my wifey, we should be ok. Also make sure to take advantage of the 10 dollars for 5 deal.

Ok so this bakery is in a little shopping center. Nothing special from the outside but you open the door and you are hot with bouquet of sweet smells. And your eyes get wide by all the pretty cookies and cakes and baklava. 

I have tried cookies, cakes, napoleons, baklava, twisted bred things, cheese cake, cream puffs and let me say I loved everything!!!! 

First time I went here there was this older Russian lady working. I never got her name but she was soooo sweet. This time there was this young girl I think Arminian also soooo sweet. I have never had bad service. They get to you quickly to see if you are ready and if not the move on and come back to you. 

The coconut cake is so good and sooo sweet it is not your normal cake. It isn't spongy it's more crispy and has 3 layers of sweet frosting. They have three different napoleons my favorite is the frites topped it has the most yummy filling. I like the pistachio baklava it's unusual in shape and big on flavor. Out of the cookies so far my favorite is the triangle one with apricot it's not sweet it's more like my grand made slightly sweet. The cream puffs taste home made and delicious. They have a fried doughnut that's filled with custard and soooo good. They also have a savory meat filled one. I noticed on the signs they make crepes too!!! They have French macaroons I suggest the coconut it's my favorite. If you aren't sure what you want ask for help and their opinion on what to get.

You should definitely try one of their excellent macaroons, available in more flavors than you can shake a stick at.  Definitely get a slice of the Bird Milk cake.  It comes in roll shape or layer cake form.  Just get both.  You won't want to share one of these.  Definitely get the Russian cake.  The Russian cake is quite dense, two people could possibly share a slice.  Get a couple Bird Milks, a slice of the Russian, and a random third slice of cake and you're going to have a damn good time.

Last week I tried the sausage lamajoon.  WOW!   The dough is impossibly tender and the perfect vehicle for the just-spicy-enough sausage filling.  

As good as the cakes are here, and they are superb, I am just as excited about their savory offerings.  I can't wait to try all the other wonderful items they bake here.

We had hot chocolates, Madeleine, coffee Macaron, Cappuccino cup and at the end bought bread to take home.

Breakfast is the only time during summer in Las Vegas when you can seat outside before it gets too hot, so we did and really enjoyed that option.

The Madeleine was good but definitely didn't need the powder sugar they add on top of it !
The coffee macaron was very tasty, the ganache had a strong flavor of coffee, very good !
The Cappuccino cup is a mousse into a chocolate cup. The mousse is made with coffee and has the same texture like a usual chocolate French mousse. We ate it all except the chocolate cup because that was a little too much sweet.

The fridges were full of cakes; a tiramisu surrounded with Pirouline cookies, a Charlotte surrounded with lady fingers... and so much more !

2. bird milk roll - This was delicious.  It's a balanced cake, with chocolate, condensed milk, and yellow cake.

We were still stuffed from our brunch at Manon, but we still popped in to have a looksee...I was surprised to see French, Italian, and Greek items here as well. The lady behind the counter was very nice and helped answer any questions we had.

We decided to try an item called Gata- baked Katafi(shredded filo dough) with a milk/cream cheese flavored filling which came with a rosewater syrup on the side. This had an interesting taste and texture, but probably not something I'd order again. I prefer crispy filo sheets rather than sredded filo which kinda tastes like biting into underbaked shredded wheat cereal.

Visit # 2 ...

Returned to Manan and they did some re-arranging...The Filo pastries are now nicely displayed off to the side and it looks like they added a few more selections...We also wanted to try a Lahmajoon, or what the lady refered to as Armenian Pizza, or Armenian Meat Pies. I would desribe it as similar to a crispy baked tortilla/flatbread topped with ground meat, onions, and spices. Not too sure of it was beef or lamb but it was pretty good. At a dollar each, its also a steal. We also tried a cinnamon-walnut flavored baklava which wasn't bad either.Looking forward to returning to try other treats in the future.

Instead of going with some of the newer things, I opted for two tried and true bakery goods--a chocolate mousse and a raspberry mousse.  I had the raspberry last night and it was excellent.

Anyone with a child knows that when you hear these words they are mostly like in dire need because they've been holding it already for goodness knows how long! I apologize and ask if they have a bathroom she can use really fast and they say ""no"". I can honestly say I beg a little because I can see on my daughters face she has indeed been holding it. 

Now, I get not having a ""public bathroom"" but we're spending money in your store and she's only 7. There were no other customers in the store. Just us and Anastasia who then chatted with some other woman employee who looked so embarrassed. Anastasia didn't budge and we left without buying the cake or any additional treats.

However, the main reason I am writing this review is due to their awesome service recently. I currently live in Oregon, but wanted to send my mom something for her birthday. Being that she loves sweets too, I looked around for bakeries that deliver to her work. 

Manan was one of the few places that would deliver to North Las Vegas. Anyway, I called them and spoke to a woman who gave me suggestions on what the most popular items were to send to my mom, and I followed most of her recommendations. I paid over the phone, but she sent me an electronic receipt by text which was great. Then, they texted me a link so that you can track the driver as he delivers the goods. So nice to see that a business is up to date on technology. 

Anywho, my mom got a delivery of Russian cake, creme br√ªl√©e, tiramisu, chocolate ganache cake, and I'm forgetting the last two items.

I ordered cannolis, a Napoleon cake, and a strawberry shortcake. The cannolis weren't the best though. The filling was really dense and it just made me really thirsty. I like Carlos cannolis better. Manan did have a better Napoleon cake though! The cream was really fluffy and the icing top wasn't too sweet like at Carlos. That's a plus at this shop. 

The line wasn't ridiculous so I was in and out real quick. When you do a check in, you get a free cookie and black coffee. They do have cream and sugar on a station across the counter where you order from.

4529869,2015-01-10,0,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"Experience:  I was ordering some lunch for delivery on Eat24 for some friends, when I noticed a new bakery available for delivery. I thought it would be a nice treat to have some baked goods for after lunch. 

Service:  the delivery time was about an hour, which is what they advertised. I live in a high rise and was a little disappointed when the delivery chic called me and asked me to come down.  I told her she needed to come up, because I paid for delivery and tipped already. Then she came up without argument. 

Food:  I ordered the following items...
  1. Coconut cake - very good, but a little sweet.  I prefer the lighter whipped cream frosting versus the thick, sweet buttercream frosting, but this was still good. 
  2. Baklava - they sent the honey on the side, but I tried it without the sauce and then later with the sauce soaked in. It was good, but not the best I've ever eaten. I guess it's not a fair judgement though, because I did spend 4 years in the Middle East. 
  3. Honey Almond cake - this was my fav of all of these choices. It was light, not too sweet and had almonds on it. 
  4. Cream puff - the pastry was dry (versus soggy like others are) and the cream filling good. If you are not big on super sweet sweets, this is a good pick for you. 
  5. Fruit tart - this was very close for first place fav. I love the crunchy cookie tart the pudding and fruit was in.  The fruit was a little sweet with the glaze, but it also provided some tartness from the berries and tangerines to counter. I really enjoyed this. 
  6. Manan cake - this was such a beautifully decorated cake.  It had white chocolate shavings on top died in various pastel colors. This cake had the whipped cream topping I would have loved on the coconut cake. My only issue was the actual cake was chocolate, which I don't like. 

Overall:  each piece was like a work of art. It definitely pleased the visual side of my hunger. Most were delicious, but all were at least good.  I will definitely order again, and look forward to stopping in someday too.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,1,1,4,Knz1v23Pn2Rv3fHqKePXJQ
4548273,2017-01-14,1,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"This 4/5 rating is as high as it is specifically because of their amazing baklava. I have to say that everything else I tried either simply wasn't my style or seemed sub-par. But I can promise you that the baklava was on point. Now you should know that they offer baklava in three forms - in a roll, cut into a triangles and cut into squares. We tried the latter. It comes with a syrup that is meant to be poured on top. We didn't bother using that because it tasted so amazing just on its own. 

I also enjoyed the ""cookie"" I tried. I put it in quotations because it's really more of a cookie bar - it has a pie crust and your choice of three different toppings. I went with the chocolate chips. There was a solid layer of those chips that were then covered with what I guess might be a baked layer of condensed milk. Pretty unique and yummy. 

The other two items we tried were based on the girl at the counters suggestion, both apparently are their most popular. I wasn't much for either. Mostly because they were cakes with very little icing and I am an icing girl. If cake with little icing is your thing, I'm sure you'd love them. 

Lastly, there was a Snickers Bar that was totally catching my eye. Unfortunately, it was pretty disappointing. There were layers of cake, a peanut butter buttercream and a meringue, all topped with caramel and peanuts. Sounds fantastic, right? Well, it failed mostly due to the fact that the cake was dry to the point of being crunchy. And the caramel and peanuts on top? Completely flavorless. Not sweet, not salty. Not anything. I have to say that the layers of buttercream and meringue were absolutely delicious! But is it work $4 and picking apart the layers? No. 

I would definitely give this place another shot. I'd get that baklava again. But maybe try one of those chocolate mousses instead of anything cake-based.",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,6,7,4,GNJupWyk2psgQWlFwCtexw

Nice bakery with a beautiful display with a huge selection of baked goods.  I ordered a cannoli and a golden key (a meringue type of dessert).  The cannoli only came in with the chocolate coated shell (I'm not a chocolate fan).  The ricotta filling was too sweet so it was disappointing.  The meringue cookie was good tho!  I'm a big fan of French macaroons and anything meringue.  It was a super size version of a macaron with a hazelnut/coffee flavored buttercream filling.  The girl that helped me was friendly.

This bakery is terrible. We went there to order B-day cakes for our girls birthday and while we were ordering we decided to have pastries. It took about 30 to 45 minutes to place the order for 2 6 inch cakes it cost $65 each cake. Ok , no problem. We gave them a month notice. 
So the pastries we got we decided to take home and eat for dessert that night. OMG I have to tell you they were horrible tasteless and you could tell they were old not fresh at all. By the way $53 in pastries 
All of it went in the trash. 
So instead of canceling our cake order we said lets see how they could do with cake. Well another disappointment the cakes were very nice looking the way we ordered them with all the decor we asked for then when we tried them it was terrible my kids didn't like it either. No flavor.

5048451,2014-10-29,1,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"This has been on my list for a long while. I moved around all over Los Angeles, but a good chunk of my upbringing was in the Los Feliz/Glendale area which is a Armenian heavy area. I love the food and the sweets so I was excited to be able to get goodies like from home. If you haven't had Armenian treats, they're rather heavy on having layers,cream/custard, nuts/nut flavored cream, honey as components. Their offerings are wide though and have many usual kinds of cake too- shortcake, tiramisu, fruit tarts, etc so don't discount them simply as a ethnic bakery as their selection is wide. 

I came with Sarah-Marie V. after dinner a few shops down. 

One of my goals was to find this cake I used to eat as a kid that my aunt used to always get. She always just called it ""honey crumb cake"" which is pretty general, but if you look at Armenian pastries, lots have crumb or crush nuts on it which makes it even harder to identify this ""crumb cake"" among them. 

I chose a honey cake as I felt that was the obvious choice first and she got bird milk cake to eat here, and we also took treats to take home as well. My honey cake reminds me of a napoleon and the layers were a cross between phyllo and graham cracker in texture with the layers and some nice honey flavored cream. She loved the bird milk and I should have gotten one for home as I took a bite and liked it. 

At home I brought home this chocolate cream layered thing which was decent. I got the Russian cake based on the girl saying it was one of her favorites, and it was also on my list of possible ""honey crumb cake"". So when I took a bite of this Russian cake - this flavor is definitely the cake I was looking for! The texture is slightly different as the one I used to get had crisp layers, but this was it as I started looking around on Google.

To top things off, the prices are reasonable with most treats being around $3 and on top of that, they often have Yelp/livingsocial/groupon type deals.

Perhaps a couple of tables set up inside (as opposed to the one table exclusively reserved to discuss custom cake orders) would allow you to dine inside and allow you to enjoy a coffee etc...but maybe they aren't looking to clean tables and allow you to eat on the premises.

I got a coffee from my yelp sign in, but they forgot to make it, and I already had my food so I just left w/o the brew, but yeah, sign in through yelp and grab your free coffee.

The first time was prior to closing since I was going to eat at Shish Kabob House and saw the bakery sign and just had to go in, because I love sweets and baked goods.  This is not the best bakery I've been to.  It seems average priced.  

- red velvet cake: light and tasty, I actually enjoyed this a little bit more after refrigerating it since the cake was more dense.  Got this on both occasions.
- macaroons: just not good flavor or texture.  I wouldn't even really recommend these :X  (Patisserie Manon in Summerlin has some pretty tasty macs)
- creme brulee: not my favorite.  I'm biased in part bc I make a pretty mean creme brulee.  But what I didn't like about this was that there was no crispy sugar topping...perhaps because the dessert sits in the display case?  And like I said, I bought this treat before closing.  
- Perot(?): not memorable enough for me to describe it to you

The ladies that work there are very friendly and helpful when asked to described the desserts.  The cookies look pretty good so I'd try those next.

Tip: Buy the Yelp deal, $5 for $10!  Totally worth it.  Didn't get the Yelp deal my first visit and spent ~$10 that time, then used the deal the second time.

Definitely not the tastiest bakery in town, IMO.  Servers are nice.  I would only go back to this place if I was in the area or with the deal.",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,2,2,3,z09vs24FRKfv9juHOo0H_g

I had seen it before, but hadn't really registered that it was more than a cake shop. 

My fella and I decided to stop up for breakfast one morning this weekend, and I was really impressed.
They were missing a handful of items, namely, the Armenian meat pie that I desperately wanted to try...they weren't quite ready when we got there.  Had we not been in a hurry, we would have waited and tried one.  Next time.  Even with a few things not being ready though, they had a huge selection of cakes, cupcakes, mousse, biscotti, and more.

I chose a Nutella cake (of course I did.) with chocolate covered hazelnuts on top.  My fella tried the baklava and a small pastry with apricot inside.  

We also got a couple coffees:  I got a free cappuccino (with Yelp check in: one time only) which was tasty, considering it comes from one of those machines that does several coffee drinks in one.  My fella got a Mediterranean medium roast coffee.  The guy who helped us described it as Mediterranean espresso.  It was VERY strong, but delicious.  We put one creamer and a couple sugar packets in it to mellow it out a little bit, and enjoyed it. 

So...the food was delicious.  Its so hard to find good baklava in town, and Manan has GOOD baklava.  They have several different varieties, so I can't wait to try the others. The Nutella cake was light, sweet, and airy.  It was really delicious.  
The smaller pastry that we got was good too.  Flaky crust, and sweet fruit spread inside. 

Everyone was very nice, and we were able to sit outside at a little table to enjoy the cool air, before it turned into a ridiculously hot day.  

I like this bakery. 
I like supporting local shops, especially when they have a quality product.  Next time, I'm trying the cheesecake, and plan to buy a loaf or two of their fresh bread!

Dream Cake - Walnut, Graham, Pastry Cream
Bird Milk Roll - Condensed Milk, Chocolate, Yellow Cake

Described as an Armenian bakery by the lovely woman behind the counter, an encyclopedic knowledge of the country's baked goods along with those from Greece and Turkey, a Saturday afternoon visit at Manan Bakery would prove to be a rarity for me - a case of baked goods with more mystery than familiarity, and a delicious bit of education served in seven courses for a mere $14 after tax and a tip for such pleasant and patient service as I inquired about the origin, concept, and constituents of no less than a dozen items.  Playing on instincts and personal tastes but more than happy to allow the clerk to guide my hand it was with a few ""standards"" that I began and with the cupcake moist and dense beneath light buttercream while the baklava arrived crisp and intensely sweet the 'familiar' products would only get better from there, the macarons my pick for most Parisian-authentic in the city as a crisp bite gave way to a light crumb and filling that was ever slightly too thick, but nicely flavored and richly textured like that of Laduree at nearly half the price.  Moving on to more novel options, it was with personal interest and love for mille feuille that I ordered Manan's ""crispy version"" and with crisp layers divided by light cream before being rolled in fluffy icing and crunchy coconut-tinged flakes the Napoleon was not a bit soggy, just light, lovely, and perhaps the best non-traditional version I've experienced to date; an impetus for a later return to check out the 'standard' version which I'd venture to be equally delicious, particularly with seasonal fruits incorporated in the cream.  Focusing last on the two ""must try"" items suggested by my server, it was with the bird milk roll that I began and although good I personally found the cake to be a bit dry, my tastes instead trending toward the appropriately named ""dream cake"" whose Napoleon like crunchy layers of graham were divided by a lacquer of thick, nutty milk-jam while buttery crumble and light pastry cream added just enough levity to reign in the intense sweetness - a perfect complement to a good cup of coffee later that evening and something I'll absolutely return for soon, along with the Gata, Yojik, Manan Cake, Kartoshka, and Mikado...maybe the Smiling Cake, Nutella Napoleon, and Fruit Cookies as well.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,4,ep0QqizuYroN5VITYC_KbA

5383745,2017-12-12,32,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"I've been able to visit Manan Bakery twice now, and I feel it's a pretty decent bakery if you're looking for sweets in Vegas. They specialize in wedding cakes, but their storefront has a ton of baked goods that you can peruse. I believe they are an Armenian bakery and have items such as bird's milk roll, baklava, and napoleon cake. 

I was actually browsing through Yelp to try to find macarons. Even though Manan does sell macarons, I would suggest going to Patisserie Manon for macarons and coming here for cakes, etc. They're located on Flamingo Road with a parking lot out front. Workers are not the friendliest, and can make you feel like you are wasting their time as you decide what you want to order. 

They have a ton of individual baked good items for sale - most were pretty decent.

Macaron: I tried their salted caramel macaron, and for the price of $1.79, I felt like it was pretty good. Flavor was on-point, but nothing too special about it. I ended up forgoing the macarons on my second visit and trying out new items instead. 

Napoleon (crispy): They have a variety of napoleon cakes here, but I opted to try their crispy version. I liked that it was super crispy and not too sweet, but it was a tad bit dry; however, I could taste the custard and layers of flakiness in that cake - which I really enjoyed. At about $4, I thought it was a decent price to pay. 

Heaven roll: For $3.79, I thought this was a relatively decent price, but I wasn't a fan of the heaven roll at all. Out of all the desserts that we tried, this was the biggest let-down because of how dry it was. There wasn't much flavor and each bite just tasted stale. 

Bird's milk cake: $3.49 - after Karina's, it's hard to find another place that can compare. And unfortunately Manan's couldn't either. The cake was definitely sweet, but it didn't melt in my mouth - instead, it also tasted a bit stale. Don't think I'd try this again. 

Baklava: The best thing that night was the baklava - they sell this by the pound, but I only opted for one piece at $2.99/each. A great deal for how amazing this tasted. I haven't had good baklava since my friend ordered some from back home and had it delivered to New Mexico. This was amazing - crispy, tasty, fluffy - everything you could want in a baklava. It was hard not to scarf down the entire thing. 

If you check in on Yelp, you also get a complimentary cookie and coffee. She said the cookie was nothing too special - tasty and simple.  

tl;dr - Some desserts were a miss, but I did find some good baklava from here, which was a treat. If I'm in the area, I think I will definitely return to get some more baklava - I'll pass on everything else.",t3cu9DxXtGyaPIWNvPOXxA,49,43,3,tVGjp7P8XsSnujfz4mUPOA
5386756,2016-10-25,0,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"The cakes and cookies I got from here were good and the place had a great vibe. The prices were a little more than other specialty bakeries I've been to. I wish I could say that the service was great but it wasn't which is why I am only rating this place 3 stars, which may I point out is average, not a bad rating overall.  

That being said there was a lot that annoyed me from that experience. To begin with the place had 2 people behind the counter and only 1 set of customers prior to us. One young lady said she would be with us in a moment but we needed a little time to review the menu. When we were ready the other person, I think was a manager or owner, started to attend us but literally in the middle of us ordering she answered the ringing phone without so much as an ""excuse me."" She then walks away from us and leaves our half filled order on the counter.  We waited for maybe 5 mins before the other young lady came to finish our box of items. I said something out loud while waiting so I imagine this is what got her attention.

So we found this place through Google maps and I was unaware of the Yelp check-in offer until I got to the cash register and saw they had a note posted on their tip jar about it. So I went ahead and checked in. I showed the offer to the young lady and she even acknowledged it BEFORE she redeemed it herself. After having paid for my cookies, coffee, and slice of cake she said she'd get me my free coffee and cookie momentarily as other customers started flooding in. 

So I look at my receipt and didn't even see free items on there so not only did I pay my full order which included a cookie and a coffee, which she could've just used the credit towards, now I had to wait again for her to help others while my order is still incomplete. I sit down and have the coffee we already ordered and even finished my cake...still no cookie or 2nd cup of coffee or cookie (there was 2 of us and each wanted our own but ended up having to share). I made eye contact with her twice and asked her for my items after patiently waiting but she said she'd be with us in a moment. We finally just left...

Manan Bakery has been a bookmark for so long that I forgot about it until I was looking for some baklava to celebrate National Baklava Day today, November 17th.  I always try to celebrate any major holidays that involve sugar or eating, in general.  I dropped by last night and walked into a bakery that offers five different types of baklava, not to mention cases full of other sugary goodness.  Cakes, cookies, macarons, pastries galore can be found here.  I bought the five different types of baklava they had, the traditional, a pistachio flower-looking one, a rectangular one with a walnut on top, and two different rolled baklavas.  I tasted three of them and shared the rest with my co-workers today and the consensus was a collective thumbs-up.  If you love baklava, try Manan's.  If you've never had baklava, you should also try Manan's and see what you've been missing.
Use your Yelp check-in for a free coffee and cookie, too.

5779012,2014-04-21,1,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"My husband and I were craving macarons but didn't feel like going to sambalatte so what did we do? Look for places on yelp, duh lol. Manan bakery came up and their macarons looked pretty good compared to others so we hit the road. Once we got there I instantly started to drool! I mean their display case is just filled with tons of goodies! When I saw the macarons I started to feel suspicious about the place. Why? Because they look EXACTLY like the macarons at sambalatte! Bought 8 of them to see if they were the same and well to satisfy our cravings. We also needed a cake for Easter and they had some really cute ones. there were chocolate mousse cakes and chocolate caramel. Of course we got chocolate caramel for those who were wondering. Service was friendly don't have any complains there. Anyways back to the macarons...tell me why it is the same EXACT macarons from sambalatte!!!! Now I can't help but wonder who gets it from who! Either way I'd go to Manan since they sell it a couple cents cheaper. As for the chocolate caramel cake it wasn't too sweet but it was flavorful except for the caramel part. The Carmel had no flavor and was just straight icing which wasn't what I expected.",fSFpjl-C0fXY7h7cG8Wxeg,2,1,4,xIa4bx7yue26t10IKkcEGg

Cons: the worker ladies look like they DO NOT want to be working

Loved the variety of desserts they offer here and their cakes are sooo beautiful! I will definitely be picking up my friends bday cakes from here.
We checked in and got a free pastry and the not so happy to be working lady gave us a free coffee to go along with it. Everything was great minus the lady seemed very annoyed when we asked her anything about the origins of the pasties. 
Keep up the recipies but maybe work on that customer service!",Qi2Sp3o4_xU9TEiGff7Eqw,0,0,4,YThjRnnnwTOugkjHpv5WSg

I arrived 10min prior to my appointment and they refused to help me and said that my appointment was for an earlier time. The cashier had to go to the back and tell the Manager that I was there and the cashier came back telling me can't help me and start to blame me that it's my fault for missing my appointment. I find the manager to be a COWAD for not telling me personally and had to tell one of their workers to tell me that. What a waste of my time!!! Will just do business some where else!!!",7Aqk1-v5C8-x0QHannurEg,2,0,1,cXguPUJzkTZwyG-9kZxZ7w
5834164,2016-11-01,0,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,I am soooooo satisfied! We found them online before we traveled from the Napa valley area. It was my 21st Birthday and I wanted a very special cake I showed my mom what I wanted and she ordered a beautiful cake! I was so satisfied with the customer service! The owner is amazing. My cake was delivered to the restaurant we had reservations at! Not only was the cake beautiful but it was soooooo delicious! The bottom layer was red velvet with cream cheese filling and the top layer was champagne cake with strawberry filling. Cake was so moist and yummy! I will order from them for the next birthday or special event I spend in Las Vegas! They are the absolute best!!! I was so nervous to order from them since I'm not a local but they seriously did an amazing job and I have 0 complaints!!! You guys made my 21st Birthday extremely special and memorable.,Nhrrg8greUP8JI6rBlYgPA,1,0,5,uFxDlAebqLC1qojjefguNA

The staff girls are so sweet and eager to please! A friend of mine bought a beautiful fruit cream cake to my Thanksgiving day feast shin dig and it was the talk of the night. I visited the store and bought a slice of strawberry shortcake and a bavarian napoleon dessert. Mmmmmm yum yes, a very sweet pleasure for my taste buds! The store is adorable and you could pretty much order anything your heart desires. They have a full bakery of fresh desserts, pastries, and coffee. The only problem you will have is deciding on which mouth orgasm you would like to buy. The dessert cases are full of Awesome treats!

Their Macaroons are amazing, they just melt in your mouth. All birthday cakes for all my family and relatives are bought from here. They are perfectionists! They make exactly what you ask for and have it ready when you need it. Their bread is amazing. I stop just for bread about once a week and it's always fresh and amazing! And last but not least their Lamajun... it is the best I've ever had. Beats every place here and even in California. The staff is amazing and is always very welcoming.

5964342,2017-01-13,1,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"We needed a cake for my aunt's birthday. I Yelped $ bakeries and came across Manan. We headed over and upon walking in my husband and I looked at each other and realized we had walked into an Armenian bakery! It was like being back in SoCal. 

They have ponchiks and piroshkis here which are a  made of the same fried dough. The sweet ponchik is like a donut and can comes filled with custard or chocolate and topped with powdered sugar. The savory piroshki is more oval and filled with meat or potatoes. Being an Armenian bakery they also had lahmajoun which is like an Armenian flatbread. My husband was a little hungry so he ordered a lahmajoun while I perused the cakes. It was served cold... I prefer it warmed up and served with a slice of lemon.

We selected a Strawberry Short Cake which was super airy, light, fluffy and not too sweet. I would totally get another cake here again! I've been thinking about that strawberry shortcake for days!

When we got to my aunt's house we saw that they had piroshkis and ponchiks from Manan. I tried them all (for the purpose of this review... ya! That's why. Not because I'm a fatass) The ponchik was good, the potato piroshki was good too, but the meat one wasn't authentic. They had created a lahmajoun piroshki by just stuffing lahmajun meat in there. I guess that could be cool, but I didn't like it. Lahmajun meat is for lahmajoun! Maybe if I was mentally prepared to bite into a lahmajoun piroshki I would have liked it better?

The service was quick and I loved the variety of things you can buy here from pastries to nuts! Yup... nuts!",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,1,4,m01ciaGsQmTCvOO-6lFjZg
5985842,2016-12-24,0,U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"The desserts/pastries are pretty good and the delivery service is a plus. They put some serious effort into the tiramisu, the eclairs are generously stuffed but the cakes... I am nowhere near as happy with them. 

The cake was dry, the inside of the fondant was gummy and the filling was whipped cream instead of the lemon filling I had ordered. The cake was for my Great Aunts 80th birthday and it was the most disappointing food item and, unfortunately, the one thing everyone was waiting to have a piece of. All cake left overs were thrown in the trash after I listened to my aunt tell me how much she disliked it.  

I hate to say it but I won't be ordering from this bakery again. Even if it was a mistake, this was kind of an important day so the let down was impactful.",-jJTm50YRw71h_F9xJ3bmA,1,1,3,39_dRxSde_g4yP7YmAIKXA
