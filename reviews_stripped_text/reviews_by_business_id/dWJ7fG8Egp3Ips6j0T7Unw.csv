281268,2017-04-27,0,dWJ7fG8Egp3Ips6j0T7Unw,"So this place used to be known as the best pizza in Las Vegas growing up. We always ordered from Verazzanos. It was always delicious. I am not sure what happened or maybe it was just a bad food night for them, but I ordered pizza, onion rings and the garlic parmesan french fries .The pizza was ok, the fries had no garlic and maybe 10 grains of parmesan on them, and they were soggy...Now for the worst part.. the onion rings .. I was so looking forward to these. I opened the container and they were dark brown in color and clearly over cooked, I decided to try the less burnt ones and the oil on them tasted like it was so old... Yuck, spit them out. I was really hoping after not having this place for so long that the food would be just as it used to be ... Oh ya and now it's called Rizanos",DI9y0e1r2QPr0_VX5Q_pnQ,0,0,2,_cJ53DuZm85fYmDIchHbgQ

They have been in business since 1980.  Its wonderful to see a small business still alive and kicking after so many years.  The food is still great and the prices are very reasonable.   I've found that its better to dine in, the food comes out hot, fresh and always YUMMY.  I gave the place 4 stars instead of 5 because they have changed their ranch.  One of the things I craved the most!!!  It used to be a homemade style with a kick of garlic, it was perfect.  My absolute favorite but I just tried it yesterday and it tasted like ranch from the grocery store.  It wasn't bad but it sure wasn't that same old delicious ranch that they used to have.  I believe the Verrazano's on Windmill and Eastern still serve the homemade style.  Good eats, great prices, its a winner!",pI_njybTKxqScZ0-60mI5Q,1,1,4,Z1rMfoeV1VD2XL1PuZDm3A

What I tasted wasn't worth seeking out, and the service is a little dismal. Dated corner space in a busy plaza needs a facelift and better service to get in more business.

Lunch specials available even after the 3PM cut off time, reasonable prices. Signage says they also sell street dogs Fri-Sat-Sun, which may be something trying.

Pizza crust is crisp on the bottom with a good chew, but cheese tastes plain and cheap. I usually just grab a slice special but it's only out of convenience, the quality here isn't very high. The dinner salad side is fresh and well-sized though.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,3,dtBBYgORNQ9g9SJ8aupa7Q

I prefer to go with the hero's or sometimes the pasta lunch special. 1/2 order of rigatoni and meatballs is good and the 1/2 chicken parmesan hero with fries and a drink hit the spot. The roll is oven baked so the cheese can melt and there are two pretty nice cutlets doused with a subtle marinara sauce. Decent steak fries and only $8.99.  The 1/2 sandwich which is monster sized is normally $8 on it's own. Good deals. 

     The only semi-issue is that one of the workers there always smokes her ciggy's right in front of the place. She should take her smoke around back. Luckily, the cook in the back made my food, but that chick is doing this pizza place a disservice by puffing away right in front of the place.

I don't know anything about that since I'm not from NY. There is usually football to watch when you're there.

Pizza is thin crusted with a bit of a char (I always ask for ""well done"" as that * snap * is like Yo Yo Ma to my ears) with a great sauce to cheese ratio. Not too greasy, foldable and in a word: fabulous. 

The staff is friendly and I truly savor my slice. The only thing that would make this more Nona Bensonhurst for me would be a walk up window. But alas, you don't have to be a homesick NYer to eat like one.

Careful if you order it with cheese or with meat, it can make it very greasy so ask for extra napkins. I now order the vegetarian so there is hardly any grease. 
The restaurant is not in the best of spots. There can be some shady people around, but that seems to give the dining experience more character. The place hasn't been remodeled( I would assume in years)- old carpet and sad little chairs and minimal decor, but again, it kind of makes it part of the experience.
As far as service, the 20 times I have been in the 3 years- it's just been basic. Not overly friendly, but never rude. Just to the point and then off to make your order. 
Dining room is pretty tiny so get it to go so you can spread out your meal and sit in a comfy chair.

We had the white pizza with cheese, and were blown away. Often times white pizzas are bland to say the least, but this pizza had a great mix of spices and quality cheeses that made it something special. We also got a house salad and garlic fries. If we only got the pizza this would have been a 5 star review, but the garlic fries were very basic, fries with minced garlic on top...nothing special. The service was great (you order at the counter) and the decor was pretty typical for a NY style pizzeria in Las Vegas. We will definitely hit this place up again and again.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,2,0,4,5fdczucHgLdZ6gnuidCBnw

And yes, it's as rumored...the cheese pizza is very good, has plenty of taste, oregano is provided in a shaker, and the Italian Mac n Cheese is superb. Cheesy and comes with two pieces of garlic bread on the side. I'm stuffed. The atmosphere is relaxing, and staff are great to talk to. The owner himself was working and cooking the day I came in. Amazing. Thank you guys I'll be back again.",eynu0uJEon1ORH1nIf4pTA,0,1,5,Ld1T3_TPxwsGOmkesMBTzQ

They have some good pizza here. I've now ordered twice from them and will keep ordering from them from now on. I need to try some more menu items as well. The first time I got delivery and it was great, the pizza came hot and it was on time. The second time I picked it up on my way home from work. The pizza was good but a little on the greasy side. No big deal though. The staff has been friendly so far.
No major complaints here.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,1,4,g9U7LIfYcW0Eny_QJMKUzQ

They recently changed from pepsi to coke products, so that was a bummer. The pizza, chicken fingers, pasta are all good. I havent ever ordered anything here, that i did not like. This place has been here for over 30 years, and the price is well worth it. Hard to come by a flat out good italian pizza joint.",_mqgeMKlV3lEkl24skSsPg,0,1,4,wEfDDrnzh7pmvFBPm3h8Ww

I always order the ""New York"" style pizza which never lets me down, sausage, pepperoni and onions. Simple and delicious!

They have been in business as long as I have been alive so that says something!

They even sell pizza by the slice which you don't find often anymore. They have great lunch specials.

I only order pizza's as I was once in the mood for wings...bad move.
The wings were dry, tasteless and were not as I ordered ""garlic parmesan"" someone forgot the coating so there we were at home with dry, tasteless, cardboard like wings which ended up in the trash, my pug refused the offer for the appetizer. 

Great Pizza!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,5,2,3,6AqAF7Ro9_u8Dl5huFGRlg

I've been here quite a few times and usually get them for delivery. However today was the last straw. Usually I go in for slices and Johns always professional however the heavy set Guy is typically cold feeling and dismissive. Fine, I can deal wth that. However today I went in with my husband and he's not a big fan of pizza so I ordered two slices and a drink. He orders a slce with riccota. John looks to I can only assume is the owner and he says flat out we don't do that (rudely) and my husband asks why not since the sign says ""slice toppings 25c"" he replies we don't do that that's a specialty topping. He never said how much this premium topping would be or anything...seriously you couldn't put ricotta on a slice.... and to top it off they gave some woman a free refill on soda but there worried about losing 20c on cheese....Congrats on losing a customer",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,1,1,1,Ks8u5WuYA0yMoA8wMozw9g

I stopped in today for a single slice of cheese. The pizza was solid and I really liked the crust. Not too thin, not too thick. Perfect texture and chewyness factor was on point. For $2.25 I'll be back for a basic slice from time to time. They also offer quite a few lunch specials at reasonable prices. Why I always forget about this place when searching for pizza in the area is beyond me.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,14,7,4,TdsfFyHqz61ypuAv0p-1KQ
