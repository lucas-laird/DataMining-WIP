Before the remodel, they were good. Now...they're pretty awesome! The grilled chicken nachos are my favorite, but they also have steak, shrimp and a few other options. The servers are friendly and usually pretty good about refills on drinks and chips and salsa. The Ceviche I'd a great way to start your meal. It's big enough for 2 or 3 people to share. Prices are a little more than before but still reasonable. I definitely like the new spin on the place.",lfHVFjodimeix3bP6KdgnQ,2,0,5,2bWvh4U0eF3ihaX6ESx5PQ
88813,2015-03-13,0,_PQ1cKw_ZtKrXNxCMgIeYA,"I love to toss hearts and flowers when possible...tonight wasn't one of those moments.

We were frequent visitors when this restaurant was SuperMex...decent Mexican food back then at a very reasonable price.  And, silly us, we liked placing those whole crispy tortillas on a napkin and ""fisting"" it to make small pieces...that was kinda' fun.  The food also seemed more flavor.

The interior has been slightly updated and presented nicely.  We arrived before 6pm on a Thursday and it was perhaps 20% full.  We were seated across from a booth which held a large noisy family group (younger kids).  We asked to be moved to a booth far away and were accommodated...only to find the older kids that couldn't fit in the family booth were near us and didn't understand you shouldn't yell to the other table.  We almost left - a relaxing dinner was not to be.

We then inquired about Happy Hour as a cold beer would have been most welcome.  We were informed that Happy Hour was only in the bar section and that the entire menu was also available in the bar.  We asked if the bar permitted smoking and learned yes, it's a smoking bar.  If I recall, Nevada law does not permit served food and smoking in the same room.  We had no desire to smell like a cigarette once home and really would have liked to have been permitted to partake in Happy Hour without being subjected to smoke.  We would have spent just as much, or more, in the restaurant section than the bar section as to us, it's a preferred environment.  This didn't set well with us as we feel an accommodation could have been made knowing we do not want to be with smokers while having our meal.  We ordered a minimal meal, tolerated the very noisy family and left.

I will add that our server was outstanding and that another large family seated at a center table in the room was a delight.  As we had small combinations, I can't attest to the food as it was just average in presentation and flavor.  The fresh salsa was delicious.",BSszDPhilRplRVp7iQCSzQ,0,0,2,4dyTUTNbRHr3cZupG9ZeJw

We asked the waitress what was going on, she stated they could not get staff to work tonight, so they were short and trying to do their best.  We observed lots of people coming in and not being helped (they pulled their hostess to wait on tables) walk right back out after not being greeted at the door for over 30 minutes.

I've seen this place when I go get gas at the chevron next to it, but never ate here. Around 1am me and my boyfriend were hungry so I came to find this place on yelp. What got me at first was their late night happy hour (11p-2am). $2 margaritas? Can't beat that. 
So we got here around 1am and our server/bartender was Matt. Really friendly guy, easy talker, etc. customer service was on point.

Matt gave us some insight about the cook who is really passionate about what he does and even though it's after midnight, you expect food to be blah right? No not even like that. The chef knows what he's doing.

1146990,2015-02-21,0,_PQ1cKw_ZtKrXNxCMgIeYA,"Jalisco Cantina is not notably different than when the place was called SuperMex, but I enjoyed SuperMex, so that's a good thing. 

The one minor peeve I had with SuperMex, was the serving of whole, round fried tortillas that you had to break up into pieces, instead of being able to enjoy pre- cut chips. This has been rectified.

My one peeve in the restaurant's current incarnation, is in the naming of a dessert, which is not truly Fried Ice Cream, but a big ball of ice cream concoction that falls short of greatness, only as a result of being covered in corn flakes that must turn nasty when frozen, because they taste stale. If they fixed this one issue, or even applied fresh cornflakes prior to serving, I would consider going over just for dessert. 

Their salsa, burritos and fajitas are among my favorites of any Mexican restaurant's. I've sampled a variety of their dishes, and found consistently delicious entrees with savory, well-seasoned sauces. 

On the sides they have a decent, but not thrilling, guacamole, and the standard, but competently prepared beans and rice. Instead of the usual, try the green rice sometime. It is something special.

Jalisco Cantina is good value for the money, offering quality food,  along with nice, frosty margaritas, a dimly lit, comfortable, and overall pleasant dining experience.",rwpnGt8edhHxFbzMRd23YA,0,0,4,89KPvF0qfPZV2ouDBtkRyA

It was evenly seasoned and down right good.  For my girlfriend plate, she was overly pleased with the predation of it. I had a bite of her tostadas and it was good.

It was cool of her to do that and said it can be requested on future visits. 

I ordered the carne asada casero burrito but asked them to leave off the bbq sauce and add tomatillo instead. I also asked to have just meat, cheese and sour cream inside my burrito and no rice on my plate. When my burrito came it looked so good but when I cut it open there was rice and beans along with the meat, cheese and sour cream. I was disappointed because I said that I did not want any rice and was specific about what I wanted in my burrito. I could have said something but didn't want to wait for it to be remade and just ate around the rice. The tomatillo sauce was very good and so was the burrito aside from the goof. When our server came to check on us she noticed the pile of rice on my plate and was upset my burrito did not come out right. She offered twice to have it remade but I explained that it was fine, and that she even noticed meant something. My wife loved her meal and had no complaints.

I decided on this place because I ran into a groupon and I still haven't learned my lesson  that sometimes there's a good reason to skip on a groupon deal because the food isn't great. The food here was ok. No bold flavors and it's not a spot I would likely visit again. 

Mexican places should always have some authentic decor and the ambiance is key for me because the experience begin with your eyes. There's nothing of that nature here and the food pretty much went along with everything else. I ordered a hard chicken taco & a cheese enchilada which lacked in flavor and my mans mega burrito was a mega disappointment as well. Lots of food for sure but not traditional in any way.

Great food and great consistency*.

The drink prices are pretty steep. Especially for the margarita which consisted of sour and tequila with some line juice squeezed in. The bartender Imelda was very nice. Now the reason for the four stars was the food. I am kicking myself in the butt for not ordering the street tacos which I believe is what they are known for. I opted for the Jalisco carnitas plate which wasn't so good. I was hungry so I took it down. I'll try it again soon and get the street tacos next time.,CHRClRVBSeVrGtn6pAEbAQ,2,1,4,Z29uQikxh8qSGHRhCxDN3Q

I ordered 2 bowls of tortilla soup and one taco combo plate with one additional taco, got charged $ 32.00 That's crazy. Second I get the food home only live a couple minutes away the tacos are soggy and ice cold, the soup is ice cold too. I was wondering where the chicken was in the tortilla soup since I just received 2 bowls of broth. No toppings like cheese and avocado or tortilla. There was some tortilla in the soup soggy as hell too. I would recommend that you steer clear of this place the food was disgusting and I would not feed it to my dog. I basically just threw away $ 32.00. Also from what a patron their told me as he was disappointed too because he blew $ 80.00 in 5 minutes on 5 different machines and could not even hit anything better than a pair. I think this place is owned by crooks who cheat people anyway they can food, machines, whatever.

3303911,2013-12-08,4,_PQ1cKw_ZtKrXNxCMgIeYA,"I was craving some good late night Mexican food with my fellow Yelpers and we decided to check out one of the best happy hours at Supermex. To our surprise, Supermex was re-branded into Jalisco Cantina. Undeterred, we came in to familiar surroundings and sat down near the bar.

Though the restaurant looks the same as before, the menu has undergone some changes and unfortunately not all are for the better. There was no happy hour menu available and after finally getting the attention of our server/bartender, he quickly mouthed off a couple dishes on HH and left us. Unlike before, only select appetizers were half off and the portions/recipes have definitely changed. I wanted to order the chicken street tacos but our server quickly corrected us that they are now called the Tacos Tijuana and for whatever reason only the carne asada ones were covered under HH, no chicken. We also ordered guacamole as an appetizer and Mexican Pizza (new item!). Note: chips and salsa were included as well!

When we got the guacamole I was left wondering if the cook forgot to mash up the avocado. Now I don't mind big chucks, but this guacamole was really just diced avocados in pico de gallo. 

Unfortunately, the new Tacos Tijuana are nothing like what they used to be. Instead of the three generous street tacos before, I got two reduced size carne asada tacos with some rice and beans. The tacos fell victim to 'soggy tortilla syndrome' where the contents escaped to all over my plate. I really wish they didn't change it up as the street tacos were delicious and a great meal in themselves.

Now the Mexican Pizza was a pleasant surprise. Like the tacos, for whatever reason the happy hour special only covered the chicken toppings. The pizza was a good portion, with plenty of chicken, mushrooms, and cheese on a thin but crispy toastada like base. Definitely a great new edition to the menu.

Our server was terrible to put it nicely. He took about ten minutes to come up to us, and seemed annoyed when we asked him to repeat the list of ~8 happy hour options (they really should just print out a list). He never brought us out our utensils and we had to flag him down over and over for refills. Maybe he was just having a bad day but he just seemed hurried and uninterested, and there weren't even that many people in the bar area. 

I give kudos to the management for changing up the menu and trying new things but I really wish they didn't downsize some of their better dishes. I used to come here twice a month when it was Supermex but now I'm wondering if I'll ever be back.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,7,2,2,LceQNhSalBXae9MWEQ19Tw

When I heard there was a new Mexican restaurant serving a taco with a fried avocado on it, I knew I had to give it a try! When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by a woman who took us to a booth and took our drink order. When you walk inside there is a decent size cantina on the right and the dining area on the left. I noticed the dining area half full of customers so I took this as a good sign. The chips, salsa and bean dip brought to the table were delicious. The salsa could have been a bit more chunkier for me, but it tasted very fresh and good. 

I ordered ""Tacos Del Campo"" priced at just $8. This was 2 tacos with beer battered fried avocado, jicama slaw and pico de gallo in them. It was just so yummy! This wasn't like any dish I have tasted before and I will be ordering it again for sure. It also came with rice and beans. I'm pretty picky about rice at Mexican restaurants and really liked it here. The rice was moist and had great flavor as the beans. All this fresh tasty food for only $8 is a great deal. Hubby ordered the ""Casero Burrito"" priced at $13 and had some issues with the order accuracy of his food, but enjoyed it and really liked the tomatillo salsa that came on it. His food also came with a side of guacamole and since he is weird and doesn't like 'cados, I scooped it right up! That guac was definitely fresh made and freaking tasty! Our server was great and checked on us for refills regularly. 

Jalisco Cantina has a few different options as far as catering. They can host up to 100 people at the restaurant with live music and either a sit down dinner or buffet style dinner. They had other options too, but I can't remember them all so you can call for more info.

I set up a lunch meeting here with a client because it was close to her work. When we arrived at 11:30 AM the place was quite vacant - to be expected. But even as we sat for an hour+ it never filled up for lunch time.

Chips and dips came out quickly - a boring bean (but at least warm!) dip, and a watery salsa. Thus far not impressed. I ordered a hot tea, expecting, well a regular 'ol tea and I was brought out a Green Tea. Well, okay, I'll drink Green Tea, sure, but when someone orders quote, ""A hot tea"" - they typically just want a brown, regular 'ol tea - not GREEN tea. 

Being that I was entertaining le client, I ordered up some guac which came out and looked very pretty, but fell completely flat taste-wise. It had both myself and my client reaching for the salt shaker. There was not even any hint of lime which made me question just what the heck was going on in this place.

Entrees came out many, many minutes later (service was SLOW). I ordered a combination plate (1 carne asada enchilada, and 1 shrimp taco). Taco was filled with very good, plump shrimp. I enjoyed it - it had a bit of a sauce in it, but not too much. Filler/shrimp/sauce was very well balanced. Moving onto the carne asada enchilada - very sad little guy (SMALL ENCHILADA) with not enough sauce on the outside, and dry meat on the inside. Beans and rice were OK.

Overall this was a lackluster experience. Food was so-so, ambiance was meh, and service was on the BLAH side.

Decided on a comfy booth in the bar area and then shortly after a server brought over some menus. 

After ordering our food we decided on some happy hour dranks. The server told us the Groupon can not be used on Happy Hour.. which is the same as everywhere else but most places will just open a separate check for you.. Not here. That was fine though because I just made by man go to the bar and get our drinks there LOL How can you pass up $1 bud light and $2 margaritas?!!? 
-I got the shredded Baracoa salad which comes in a taco shell and is really delicious! Lots of fresh avocado and they don't use cheap lettuce.
-boyfriend got the 3 plate combo with carne asada tacos, beef taquitos, chicken enchilada, rice & beans.. This was just OK. 
-chips, salsa & bean dip were good. We were not offered a refill~ 

The service from the server was alright. She did her job and nothing more.

5712947,2015-05-23,0,_PQ1cKw_ZtKrXNxCMgIeYA,"I live near this restaurant and was hesitant to try it because I'm picky about Mexican food (from Texas and Tex-Mex is my favorite food group) and the yelp reviews weren't overwhelmingly positive. However, about 3 months ago my mom was in town and we were tired and wanted to eat something quick so we decided to finally give Jalisco's a whirl. 

Place wasn't very crowded and service was attentive and good. 

The salsa and bean dip they serve with chips is good. 

We ordered guacamole as an app and it was blech. I did not enjoy their guac. The avocados did not taste fresh. My favorite guac is the simplest & freshest and theirs has huge chunks of onion and tomato and was watery. Just say no!

I got a combo plate with a hard shell ground beef taco and cheese enchilada. Both, including the rice and beans, were very tasty. Whatever cheese they use in enchilada is bomb. The red sauce is good too. Thumbs up.

I got an agave marg on the rocks and it was so sweet I couldn't drink it. Next time I would skip the agave--maybe I just don't like agave.

My mom got a chile relleno and she said it was really good.

Since this first visit, I've ordered take out twice on nights I didn't feel like cooking and you just pick up from their bar. Definitely worth giving this place a try if you are craving Mexican and in the mood for a low key lunch or dinner. BUT, skip the guac & agave.

5761232,2015-02-28,0,_PQ1cKw_ZtKrXNxCMgIeYA,"I preferred this place much more when it was SuperMex. I don't know what other changes were made when it became Jalisco's but IMO it has gone downhill. The menu is a lot different. The carne asada nachos my son always gets is no longer the same dish. They now use a different white cheese that tastes so waxy and cheap. People who have eaten cheap cheese know what I mean! My former go-to meal was the steak fajitas. At $12.99 it used to be so tasty and portion was large enough to bring home another meal. I think the same item is $15.99 now. Smaller portion and not as good of flavor as the original. My son and I both agree the steak meat they use for the nachos and fajitas just suck!

I gave them one more chance when I dined in for breakfast and ordered the chorizo and huevos quesadilla. Honestly, it tasted like I made it at home. I'm definitely a doggie bag person but I wasn't inclined to eat the other half of my quesadilla anytime soon. 

The plus side is the chips and salsa. I'm glad they finally changed from whole fried tortilla rounds to triangular chips.",Tw3_-eahwaTZJjEsos1gpg,1,0,2,R81rVGuFU8t5l7vrI1xxAQ

5837414,2014-07-26,2,_PQ1cKw_ZtKrXNxCMgIeYA,"After two visits here I can now attest to the consistent excellence of this place for fine authentic Mexican cuisine.  Here, besides an addictive mild, mellow, and very tasty Bean Dip that is presented with homemade Salsa and warm tortilla chips, fresh guacamole is made three ways, two of which I have sampled.  Maiz Y Chipotle Guacamole features green avocado and large yellow kernels of corn, and is adorned with twisted Fried Onion Straws.  It packs a powerful spicy backbite that put my mouth on fire after downing just a few scoops.  While I liked it, I found much milder and chunkier Guacamole Classico, with avocado, tomato, onion, and cilantro, to be cold,  refreshing, and more to my liking.

Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp with a bit of melted Monterey Jack Cheese was excellent and succulent, with or without Adobo Sauce.  Coming eight to an order, and served with cucumber and tomato slices, and half a lime, this porcine app easily serves two diners, which Diane and I learned after initially ordering two platefuls.  This was just one of several leftovers that came home with us the first time, to serve as a great lunch the next day.

For a main dish I savored both a Casero Burrito Carnitas and a very nice Casero Burrito Verde, in addition to a very good Shredded Beef Crispy Taco just for a change of taste.   Diane had Chicken Mini-Chimichangas with the chicken marinated in a Chipotle Sauce, and a mild, well-melted Cheese Quesadilla filled with shrimp.   

Both times Janeth was a friendly, attentive, and very competent server.  On the first occasion, Diane's appetizer plate was chipped.  But everything was in order on the second visit.

I was left stunned and in shock when we rolled into the parking lot and noticed it was no longer SuperMex in which we had eaten at religiously over the last 7 years.  We decided to go in and see what the hell had happened. Ok so the staff informed us that Jalisco still has the same Owner and that they only changed the name. They also stated that there were only ""minor"" ""simple"" changes made. As Maury stated ""THAT WAS A LIE"" 

Yeah this was a big let down, I knew there was more than just a name change that had taken place. The décor was different, the menu was different and the complimentary chips and dip was different. This was getting more disappointing by the minute as we dined.

The plates are smaller, the prices have increased, the items that we had enjoyed over the last 7 years were no longer existent. I am disappointed in so many ways that I don't know where to begin.

It should have alerted me to the disappointment that was coming. As we sat only two other tables came in and both of them were Senior Citizen aged groups. 

I mention that only because as we were eating our food it reminded me of the food I ate at the nursing homes my grandmother lived at as a teenager. Very bland and not overly flavorful.

I was given three small soft taco shells for my shrimp fajitas. With all the peppers, onions, guacamole and cheese on the plate you could have easily used 6 to 9 more shells. The shrimp were incredibly overcooked and lacked flavor. 

The Fiance had a taco dish that was also very bland in flavor. We had to order extra Guacamole and Salsa just to add flavor to the food. 

The waitress had a total of four tables while we were there and we still only saw her three times. Once to take or order, once to deliver and finally to give us a bill. Never checked on us to ensure we were ok and I had to Flag her down to request my extra shells and get our bill.
