The food however could use a little love. I did have success with the steak fajitas this last visit and those where great! The steak was tender and full of juicy flavor... 
The beef enchiladas need help. They are flavorless, dry and very spicy. 
I would never order their tomale ever again since they add food coloring to make it a turquise blue color for some reason... It just seems wrong.. and is probably unhealthy.
I also feel that the pricing is a little high for mexican food. Im sure that they get away with overpricing their dishes because their main clientel is tourists but as a local, they need to have better food or lower their pricing.",hvZ5o9YNJJ-TVCcdT42VoQ,0,0,3,R6aO59fF_122zjxJdCdr5Q

I went to the sunday margarita brunch buffet, and this was totally awesome for people watching. Everyone that had too much to drink the night before was piling on the mexican food and stumbling around and it was really, really hilarious. I'm giving that part it's own star. The margaritas were decently strong when I went and the hostess and our server were great. The food was really good... they had a decent selection and had sections where they'd make you fajitas and omelettes/eggs and unlike some of the smaller buffets, had more than enough options for the vegetarians. Maybe not the vegans.

You have the option for BIG margaritas, which inevitably led to some problems later on.  The server was cheerful but the entrees took forever.

The pleasantly earthy smells and colorful flavors which make the tongue celebrate it's ability to taste, these are dishes which make this cuisine one of the most sought after in our culture.  I understand this, and I seek out these fine flavors from every corner of every town I visit....I even test my own chops in the kitchen, trying to imitate the better experiences I have had in restaurants and kitchens everywhere I have visited.  So it is with great appreciation of food and extensive culinary curiosity that I write this review of Gardu√±os at the Palms.  
Put simply, the 'food' here is absolute rubbish, an insult to the fine culinary traditions of its alleged roots.  The Posole was a salty, rotting mess...the worst EVER.  The adovada was more salt/vinegar flavored leather bits than food.  The enchiladas, well, if soggy tortillas drowned in sour cream, hardened cheese crust and surrounded in crunchy rice is your idea of an enchilada, you're in luck.  We went here starving, ate more than we should have of the slop they served (the shot of tequila added to the hunger pains, probably should have been avoided for that reason alone), and suffered the stomach pains and cold sweats all night and through this morning as a result.  Never again, never again.  McDonalds in the lobby would have been a better option, and I haven't done that in over 10 years.",A2XWbk2DF0MJgUcQE-uCog,0,0,1,-1oiXhC-6XoUgk0VuCLy-g

Our server was attentive until the food came, and then she disappeared for about an hour.  I wouldn't consider this the best Mexican restaurant, but it's ok.  The fajitas were of sirloin instead of the usual flat iron steak, so I was a little disappointed when it tasted more like stir-fry.  The machaca tacos and the handmade chicken tamales were good.

The ""salsa de mesa"" (the salsa served with the chips) was quite tasty. We also enjoyed the green salsa and mango pico de gallo from the salsa bar.

We built a combo with a chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and bean and cheese burrito.  The plate was saturated with cheese, as is common at tex-mex restaurants. The green chile sauce served on the dish was pretty mild, but tasty enough.  The chile relleno was surprisingly tasty, and we liked the enchilada tortilla.  The remainder of the dish was unremarkable.

We reminded the server about the sopapillas that were to come with our combo.  They were edible, but it would've been just as well if we'd forgotten about them.  They were essentially bready pillows served with a squeeze bottle of honey.

It took a long time for the waiter just to acknowledge us,  then, he took our drink order.   Took him about 15 minutes to come back with two drinks:  a weak, flat tasting rum and coke and an incorrectly poured, not very cold Sam Adams (it was half head.. of course by the time the waiter came back I'd drank almost all of it!).   Overall, from the time that we were seated until we received our food it was 50 minutes.  And, the dining room was at about 1/4 capacity.   The employees were milling about.. not serving the patrons.   
Our food was average.  Honestly, not a giant leap above Roberto's.  I think the service is better at Roberto's.  
Then, our check arrived.  It was incorrect.  They had added on an erroneous $2.50.  It took the bumbling staff members about 15 minutes to figure out that their cash register was (allegedly) malfunctioning.

The chip and salsa were good, not excellent but good and a provided a good thermometer for the rest of dinner. I also liked the fact that they had a self serve salsa bar which included an avocado salsa! I love avocado salsa and this was a good one! Creamy with small avocado chunks and slightly spicy a great combo with the warm tortilla chips! Mm Mmm!

Not being too hungry I just opted for the Rolled Tacos (or Taquitos as I normally call them). Pretty simple, you get 6 total tacos- 3 filled with chicken and cheese and 3 filled with shredded beef and cheese then the whole plate is topped with cheese and pico de gallo. Good stuff! The plate comes with sides of Chile con Queso (I didn't care for this one), Guacamole (ok, not great) and Sour Cream. I opted to dip my tacos in the avocado salsa instead :)

Overall we had a good dining experience. The service was friendly and prompt and our food came out timely and hot.

One of my girlfriends used to spend a lot of time at the Palms, so Gardunos was a perennial favorite. Plus as an added bonus, all meals here, including the most recent one, were comped for us. Until recently the food was great so I never had any complaints. 

I came here a few days ago for a quick lunch with the girls. There were maybe a grand total of 5 patrons in the restaurant (not including us). We opted to sit outside on the patio which overlooks the pool. We ordered our usual to share:

-guacamole
-shrimp cocktail
-salad
-combo of enchilada and a taco

The first offering of guacamole brought to our table was brown. BROWN. I have made home-made guacamole hundreds of times and I know that if you let it sit out for a day or so (even wrapped in the fridge with a pit and lime juice) it starts to turn color. This first offering of guacamole must have been at least two days old. Hardly ""fresh, made to order.""

The waiter saw our faces and immediately took it back. The second offering was made fresh, so he said, and it in fact was the correct color at least (green). However, the taste of it was off and we didn't eat more than a bite each.

That's how the meal started and everything went down hill from there. The beans were dried up, almost crunchy, the salad was wilted and the majority of the meal was over-salted.

The first thing I noticed was a confusing menu. I wanted fish tacos, so I searched the menu under tacos, and seafood. Neither section offered fish tacos. So I ask our server why they didn't offer fish tacos at a Mexican restaurant of this caliber. So she directs my attention to a separate menu called ""chef's specials"". So I order my fish tacos and house margarita on the rocks. My margarita makes it out 10 minutes later, and tastes like sugar water. So I asked my server if they put any alcohol in my margarita, because if I remember correctly, she had checked my I.D. She then explains to me that it is a premixed margarita, then offers me a $5 shot of tequila. So you're charging me 10 bucks for a premixed, practically virgin margarita, and then you're going to make me buy an extra shot just to have some kind of alcohol! Umm..you can have it back. 

Then my tacos come out. I explain to the others at my table that my tacos had no flavor. All I could taste was the sauce, bell peppers, and a tortilla (which was flour.

Better you should go somewhere else and actually have quality food. 

The salsa bar here is shabbily presented, outright messy (congealed spills everywhere, including on the few tiny cups available, and this was in a dead restaurant at 4:00 p.m.), somewhat limited in selection compared to other places, clearly old (the cilantro leaves looked like they died in the sun two days ago), not very finessed in flavor, and - depressingly - the bar has a *permanent* sign for one salsa that reads ""AVACADO.""

The vegetarian options go from ""standard yawn"" (cheese enchiladas, bean burrito, quesadilla, chile relleno, veg fajitas) to ""abysmal"" when you realize that the cheese of choice here is cheddar. This is a town where almost every grocery store carries Oaxaca, Panela, Cotija, etc., and Gardunos is using not just cheddar, but that Oompa Loompa orange cheddar that, when hot, takes on an oily sheen that slides right off the cheese with a little poking.

I had to specifically ask for the sopapillas that were supposed to come with my plate; complimentary sopapillas during the meal are a touch that sets Gardunos apart and something I enjoyed when I tried their Fiesta Rancho location several years ago. Alas, on this occasion the sopapillas were very thick, chewy, and dry, not the soft, puffy pillows that this veteran sopapillas nommer expects.

Missing sopapillas aside, the service was great. Everyone was friendly and refills were brisk. Of course, I'd expect no less when only three parties are dining, but if the servers have the same helpful, cheerful attitude when the house is full, then that's one thing Gardunos is doing right.

Locals have absolutely no excuse for eating here. 

Tourists, now you know better. The Strip has several better options for what I consider to be the three zones of Mex cuisine: street-style interpretations of ""authentic,"" familiar standards good for newbies and old-hands alike, and Michelin-bound inventiveness. 

(But don't be lazy and go to the wholly unremarkable La Salsa, which has surely earned its stars on visitors who think it's okay to go to Taco Bell when you're sober.)

Here is a brief summary of my experience last night that cemented my decision to give Gardunos a 2 star rating (dun dun dun):

After arriving at 8:42 PM (I was a little rushed and looked at my phone) we found ourselves waiting for over 35 minutes for our existence to be acknowledged. If we were waiting to be sat on a Saturday night this wouldn't have been a dire offense, but we we ordering food to-go and were told that they do not take orders over the phone. The colleague with me pointed out about 3 minutes into our visit that not a single person walking by had even attempted to make eye contact with us, a big pet peeve of mine. While we waited for someone, anyone to notice that we were living people, we made a game of it. NOT A SINGLE PERSON FROM START TO FINISH CONNECTED EYES WITH US. 

Finally, at 9:17 pm (again, looking at my watch) someone noticed that we were loitering or something around the host stand and timidly breathed the question, ""just two?""  

exasperated, I said, ""We just need to quickly order some food to go,"" even lowering myself a little in hopes that she would look up from her clipboard.

""The bar,"" she said, still looking at her clipboard and pointing toward the bar.

At the bar we were instantly greeted by someones back as he just asked, ""what'll it be?"" and then walked away for ten minutes. All without eye contact.

SKIPPING FORWARD.

When we finally got our food back to the office we noticed that on top of our mound of poorly packaged, dripping food was a large bag of chips next to one 2 ounce container, half-full of guacamole. The complimentary container of salsa that we ate with out chips was larger and, more importantly, filled to the top. And that was free. We paid $4 for less than 2 ounces of mediocre guacamole. 

Not all was bad, though. The shrimp tacos were large and flavorful, the steak in the enchiladas was very tasty (but the sauce was unremarkable) and I really would eat the mango salsa from the salsa bar for dessert. It's remarkable. 

For things that any business in the service industry should have refined (eye contact, greeting people within 1 minute of them sitting even just to say hello, etc):

1 star

For value, presentation and packaging:

2 stars

For the food (flavor, portion size, etc)

4 stars

Service
I have to start with the service which was abominable. My server spent most of my stay in the back polishing silverware, how do I know this? Well my table was facing a small window into the kitchen that allowed me see her location while she was not refilling my drink or attending to any of her tables. I was having trouble deciding between the monterey chicken and the chorizo chicken so I asked her to explain the differences and the her preference. Her answer, ::drum roll:: - 

Waitress: The chorizo chicken is spicier. 
Me: They are exactly the same except the chorizo chicken is spicier
Waitress: Well they come with different things
Me: Alright, how about this. Which one do you prefer?
Waitress: The Monterey Chicken

The Food
The Monterey Chicken sucked!! Unless you have a sodium deficiency do not touch this dish. The chicken itself  was good it was the sauce, the inedible beans, horrifically over salted enchilada and old corn cake that was the problem. Imagine having four different items on the plate and knowing that every bite you take with force you to cringe and put your fork down. This is Gardunos food!!!

Dessert was next!! Taco anyone? Ever have a choco-taco at the grocery store? Phenomenal little desserts those are. When I saw a dessert taco covered in chocolate and filled with strawberry ice cream I said lets DO IT!!!!! Well I have to cut through the rock hard pastry taco shell with a teaspoon like some kind of inmate. It tasted like it had been in the freezer for weeks. The ice cream had an awful flavor, indescribable really. Poorly presented dollops of whipped cream all around completed the dish making this meal an utter failure.

Whats funny about this is that my meal was free because I'm a gambler, I still won't come back even for a free meal. I rather pay a lot for a great meal or $15 at the cafe for a decent meal.",XHyjpxiGpL_0m4snbBfOKQ,2,2,1,LpfZdvR68vUrfydIF6RipQ

The restaurant itself is a bit dated, and dark. While the menu items descriptions sounded tantalizing, what was delivered to the plate was terrible. My low carb twist on chicken with chorizo sauce ended up being a dried-out chicken breast served with a blah diced zucchini and squash mix. My husband's carnitas were so unlike the traditional pulled pork presentation, he actually challenged the waitress that she had made a mistake - couldn't have been what he ordered! Alas, their take on carnitas was chunks of pork tenderloins smothered in onions and served with beans and cheese. 

The margaritas were hopelessly awful. A ""small"" house marg on the rocks arrived with way too much tequila and little lime juice/mix; after a return to the bar the second drink was a little better, but others in the group had much worse. One marg tasted like key lime pie; another was so watery and slushy it might has well have been a lime popsicle crushed in a glass.

We were seated after a short wait since we had walked up with no reservation. The hostess was fairly friendly when she seated us. We browsed the menu and after a short wait, Ferris, the middle aged balding server came over. We wanted to start off with  Margaritas, I got the El Presedente or whatever the top of the line one was and she got the Silver coin. We were brought out waters as well.  My margarita was pretty good, fair pours, well balanced. She enjoyed hers as well. 

For dinner she orders the soup and Taquitos and I order the veggie Fajitas. The chips and salsa were standard but good. I popped over to the salsa bar to test out different ones with the chips. All were fair to fairly good.  As we waited for our food, I noticed my dates water glass (mixing cup) was cracked. Something that happens from time to time in bars and restaurants from the dishwashers. Those pressure cracks that you cant really feel but can see internal to the glass. When the meals were brought out I mentioned it to Ferris and he took the water and went off.  The demeanor of Ferris the entire dinner was not at all rude but you could tell he just didn't want to be at work or had some things going on. He was missing for 90% of the dinner besides taking the orders but never checking back. He never did bring a new water glass out to her but it was par for course for Ferris.

My date enjoyed the soup and Her Toquitos were just OK. My veggie Fajitas came out steaming hot as is expected. The flavors and veggie assortment were nice. I would give them a solid 3.5 stars. The salsa  was nothing special but played the part.  It filled up up. Ferris brought the check, never asked if we wanted dessert or even a another2  Margaritas. I was too full for dessert but I am always happy to drink.  We sat and talked for about 10 minutes and Ferris never came over to get the check or ask if we needed change. 

I am never one to just leave a check as I like to make sure the server gets it so no shady dirtbags swipe the money inside. Ferris was no where to be found so I put the cop and the rest in cash in the check and left it but told the hostess it was there. I still tipped 20% because I am in the industry and I over tip almost everywhere but Ferris didn't deserve it. I had the comp but because of the mostly average food, above average drinks and way below average service I can only give Gardunos 2 stars. I will not be returning even if I do get another comp.

I find it ridiculous that especially in this economy that service wouldn't be top notch as restaurants are not very busy at all for the most part. This is when service should be at its best. The server can't control the food but he can control his attitude and I will not be back to any place that service isn't at least average. So many better options for Mexican food in the city and even in the area with much better service.

The gauc was actually really awesome, but the other three were not even close.  The bean dip and the queso were almost identical in flavor and color... did we get two bean dips??  I've never tasted queso dip like that... The fire roasted was too hot to eat... (which is weird cause we LOVE spicy food!) 

Hubby got a seafood chimichanga.  It was VERY fishy and inedible to me... He is my personal garbage disposal, he eats everything and anything... and he couldn't get past a few bites.

I was wrong.

I found the menu to be inspired, the service friendly and unobtrusive and the prices fairly reasonable.  Save for hole-in-the-wall Mexican food cooked by old mamacitas straight from the old country which are the best, this place held a candle to most Mexican restaurants I have ever been to.  

I noticed some reviewers said it was ""Chevy's-esque"" but not so.  On the menu, I found a number of tasty and hard to find Mexican regional specials like Carne Adovado and Hatch Green Chile's.  In fact, I was so excited to see the Carne Adovado that I ordered it.  A fantastic choice it proved to be.  Simmered in a rich chile marinade and served with roasted potatoes and ranchero beans, I was in a little bit of heaven.  On second thought, I might have been in heaven because of the delicious giant fishbowl Margarita that had over 6 shots of Tequila in it.

Also worthy of note, the chips and salsa provided are top notch with the salsa being a butt-kicker.  I think Im still sweating.  Prices were around 15 bucks an entree.

The wife and I came here today for a late lunch. She ordered the cheese enchiladas and I ordered the nachos with carne asada. Both of our meals arrived with that orange hue of low quality cheddar cheese. My food tasted OK, probably the sort of thing that would have made me very happy a few years ago, but somewhere along the line my standards for Mexican fare have been raised and this felt a little like the sort of ""Mexican"" you might find in a diner in the heart of Utah. No really distinct flavours, quick to congeal, and the sort of thing I'd be more likely to expect served up in a polystyrene, clamshell box in a food court rather than at a restaurant.

Gardunos has a salsa bar with a decent bean dip and some OK salsas -- a good thing since the stuff you get on the table by default tastes like it's straight from an economy sized plastic Pace bottle -- but the salsa bar at Guadalajara at Sunset Station thrashes this one senseless. The other issue I have with the salsa bar is it's a little dirty and when we were there there were only four of the little salsa bowls for us to use and those were splattered with salsa drippings from the bar. On top of this, they are so small that you have to snap your chips in half if you want to dip.

The restaurant is a typical Mexican establishment, although I question its authenticity as a Mexican establishment when they list two versions of Fettuccini Alfredo in their chef's specials.  

My acquaintances ordered the tableside guacamole, which I've always found to be a rip-off in any restaurant, especially because it's not like a teppan show when they're mixing the ingredients up.  Sure enough, the guacamole mixer was rather uninspired, as were the ingredients she brought with her.

I had the Stuffed Sopaipillas, mainly because I love sopaipillas.  You include sopaipillas in your menu, I will try them.  And they were... OK.  In the end, it might as well have been a burrito I'd had.

My friends may have thought they were someplace serving pretty good Mexican food.

on a busy friday night, we called before going to see if we could get a reservation.  we get one for 8pm, arrive on time, are seated right away and given our menus.  (the restaurant inside the palms is huge and had a bunch of empty tables.)  it took seriously at least 15 minutes for anyone to come check on us.  the guy takes our drink order, but he's not our server.  15 minutes is a long time at a restaurant!

then the chips and salsa finally came.  

then another 10 minutes later, our waitress comes, with the most unpleasant attitude i've experienced at a restaurant in a long time.  she took our order and went on her merry way.  the food took longer than i'd expect for a mexican restaurant, but the way the meal was going so far, it didn't surprise me.  

maybe our waitress just didn't like a table full of 7 girls, because she also had the two tables next to us and checked on them frequently.  she just avoided us.  came to us only once.  wouldn't even make eye contact over our way.  

we all liked our food and our fruity margaritas.  i had the tamale and taco plate and it was quite delicious.  it even had the hole-in-the-wall home-made feeling....not the artificial el torito type.  now if only they could work on their service.",E4UUqPlwClhSZ_JaRHvXPQ,3,2,2,ryC8H2xA2cq_24hFJ23Gbw

For the type of Mexican restaurant[0] that they are, Gardunos does pretty well.  Fairly large selection of dishes, including both the usual favorites (enchiladas, tamales, tacos, etc.), some less common yet definitely Mexican dishes, and a handful of fusion/Southwestern stuff.  Everything we had was solid to actually pretty damn good, and this is coming from Arizona and California natives, respectively, who have since seen what bad Mexican tastes like after moving to the East Coast.  There's not much I can say about the food that hasn't already been said, save for the fact that the tortilla soup was one of the best ones I've ever had, and they do NOT screw around with the salsa.  

Where they really stand out though, as you damn well should in Vegas, is the drinks.  The signature drinks, the margaritas, all of it, were amazing.  That especially includes the drink that, among other things, is served in a margarita glass rimmed with honey and roasted coconut.  I don't remember what was in it, and am a little embarrassed to admit that I loved a girl drink so much, but holy hell, I don't care.

what'd you do?
 
me: stayed
apparently, blue agave is the special menu at Gardunos
the stuff you saw online (Palms website)
 
Brette: that doesn't make sense?
was it mediocre?
 
me: terrible
 
Brette: oy
 
me: terrible
I was wondering why there was only one yelp review of blue agave
when I was researching in my room
 
Brette: i hope there are 2 now

me: now I know.
The Palms website deceives!
 
Brette: dude, you gotta yelp that
 
me: maybe I'll just copy and paste this chat in there

Brette: haha
it's not worthy of an actual review
 
me: But I'll get lots of ""funny"" and ""cool""
and maybe some ""useful""

Just as we sat down, they placed chips and salsa on our table. I couldn't even hear my friend from across the table it was so loud near these people, so I requested a different spot. The waitress came back and transferred us in the front where it was a lot better. They brought us more chips and salsa lol

They have a lot to choice food on the menu, and the prices were reasonable. The food didn't take long, and it was a big size meal. It was very good, but I couldn't even finish half of the plate it was so much. DOGGIE BAG lol.",T1XUUXIEU5uj3NmdWAdIlA,1,0,4,DNVkEWoWh6I158Fp9TgDWQ

The food: As yelp would say.. ""A-OK"". I got the fajita ""buffet"" if you will. Consisting of fajitas ""cooked to order"" (heated up for 20 seconds on a grill). Fajitas were decent, and you could get enchiladas as well. Only 9.99 for lunch.. not a terrible deal.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,2,0,3,XFAIaNmynhuMc6aChBMAtQ

convenient location as i stayed in the palms....

the downfall is that the gaucamole wasnt very impressive...i liked their bean dip more...and thats odd... how do they not make great smashed up avacado dip????

i had this dish that was like a burrito and nacho combined...the bottom was toritila chips and topped with carnitas and cheese with their house sauce...",QTXeJ0TmEoeb2nRUemWpZA,1,1,4,LJxdgfDgQ0PZgyqgyTRxcQ

It was good enough, again I'm a Mexican food aficionado, so you really have to pull something amazing for me to be wow'ed.

Chicken tacos was pretty good, meat was tender and juicy, as well as, all white.

Service was standard.  If you're stuck at the Palms and maybe too drunk to go anywhere else and have to have something vaguely Mexican-ish, sure, give it a shot.

5498958,2012-04-18,0,lfXfxBms5z1nwzkxxLFBWg,"Garduno's is home to one of the best Sunday brunch values in Las Vegas, and one of my favorite dishes in this city.

First the brunch. Every Sunday they serve an all-you-can-eat margarita brunch buffet for about $18. The margaritas are about what you'd expect, given the ""bottomless"" part - cheap and sugary - which is not to say they skimp on the tequila. You can get brunch-crocked very easily here.

The brunch includes made-to-order fajitas and a small assortment of dishes like enchiladas, ribs, chilaquiles, tamales, and more - it's not a full cross-section of the menu but it's more than enough to satisfy. The dessert selection is surprisingly robust too. Be sure to grab some flan.

Now, on to the dish that's an obsession of mine: the chile rojo. Rich, spicy red Hatch chile and melted cheese smother a huge bowl of flank steak. Add in diced tomatoes, red onions, cilantro and tortilla strips, scoop it all up in soft, warm, fresh flour tortillas and go to town. This is usually good for two meals for me.

The chips and dips served here are quality too. The bean dip is phenomenal (ProTip: you won't want to eat refried beans after this) and the avocado, jalapeno, arbol, mango and mesa salsas are all worth a taste. At the end of the meal, ask your server for a basket of sopapillas, tear off an end, squeeze some honey inside and drift into heaven.

Some of the more traditional dishes that I've eaten here have been unremarkable - the tacos, chiles rellenos and fajitas are all just OK.

Garduno's isn't a restaurant that gets everything right, but it is one that does a few things very, very well.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,4,vAoWY4CmVz49TUkF0jriqg
5500552,2010-02-22,1,lfXfxBms5z1nwzkxxLFBWg,"This was a mistake if i have ever made one. We had tickets to the 10:00Pm  showing of Avatar in Imax 3D at the palms and we ended up getting there early. We both had not eaten and after walking the floor at palms we decided that Mexican food sounded much better than McDonald's or any of the joints in the food court. "" Wrong Again"" we walked up to the hostess who was very nice and greeted us quickly and was ready to seat us, now if you have been to the palms you know how the seating works in this place, right as you walk in to the casino from the parking garage this place is to your right so you may know that the seating is somewhat open and does not ever really seem all that full; this was the case Saturday night, there was plenty of open seats and she still walked us back into this dark dungeonesque area. No more high ceilings, no more light, no music... It was like being sat in the cougar cage..... No offence to any of you good looking cougars out there but we got seated right in the middle of this room and a matter of moments from us being seated they put together a table for a party of 24 right next to us... Now i know that sometimes we exaggerate what right next to us means but this was really really close, so close that the lady who put the table together for them and seated them then walked by me and said sorry... so now, not only are we sitting in a dungeon, the echo of all the purring coming from the table of jungle cats was ridiculous loud and it smelled like we just walked into a saphora after a shipment of fragrances had been broken. So to the point.. Our food was ordered,  I ordered a Taco salad with Jalapeno vinaigrette and the lady ordered the taco sampler. 25 minutes later our waitress came to the table with our food.. One word says it all. HORRID. My tortilla shell was glistening like a fighter after 12 rounds, covered in grease and the lettuce looked as if they pulled entire leaves of lettuce off and stacked them in this grease bowl. Then piled ground beef on then and melted a slice of Kraft cheese on top. I got down maybe a quarter of it and called it quits, I could not handle the smell, the sounds, the service, it was all bad..The wife enjoyed one of her tacos and the rest was not that great... Avatar saved the night for us. I honestly feel that the popcorn and cherry Pepsi beat out the Gardunos slop by far.. I do not recommend this place.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,0,0,1,ibYf_jhJQPcuyG9dl4PBXQ

At one point a guy at the table next to us went back to the kitchen to refill his drink himself.  The margaritas were disgusting. We ordered the premium with ""fresh lime.""  It came loaded with bad tequila and thick sour mix.  The food was terrible and overpriced.

I went here for a late lunch approximately around 3pm. Not many people so it was pretty much quiet and we had the waiter all to ourselves. The food is ok, not good not bad. It will cure your fix for Mexican food but won't exactly wow you or secure a return visit. 

The enchiladas barely had any filling, I had one chicken and one cheese and they were very skimpy just mostly sauce. The rice and beans were moist but tasteless with zero flavor. I feel that I paid 15.99 for bland rice and beans seriously. 

The best thing that was fantastic but impossible to screw up was the table side guacamole.

The liquor drinks are strong and good I have to say at least, however I think those are made and brought over from another bar on the property and not the actual restaurant? Not sure I can even give them the credit for the drinks.

Food is just ok and for the higher prices for mediocre, I won't be back.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,3,3,3,e2ykY-uapXqr6CVOgXNCjw
5849772,2011-12-05,0,lfXfxBms5z1nwzkxxLFBWg,"I write this review with a sad heart.  My husband introduced me to Gardunos over three years ago... he was a huge fan of the original namesake in New Mexico and when he learned there was one at The Palms - we had to go.  It was fantastic - back then.  The service, the food, the chips and dips were all spot on.  We made multiple return visits from then on - the most important one being our first Vegas stop on the weekend we got married.  The coconut margaritas are so tasty!  Rich, creamy, potent, and sweet... On our most recent visit back to LV, I wanted a coconut margarita and my husband wanted the green chili stew.  We arrived at an off hour on a Monday, so of course there weren't many people.  I don't believe this to be any excuse for so-so service and blah food.  Blah.  I ordered a carne asada dish and my husband ordered the three item combo plate.  I, of course, sipped on my coconut margarita throughout the meal trying to remind myself that SOMETHING was still good.  My meat was slightly dry and the flavors were pretty boring.  How can New Mexican food be boring?  My husband was disappointed in his stew - having once been one of his favorite dishes.  After a 'meh' experience, we both decided that we wouldn't need to return... at least not to eat.  And there are plenty of other locations that are more convenient to go drink margaritas.  If you're AT The Palms - stop by for the Happy Hour or the chips and dips and just drink.  Otherwise, no reason to go out of your way for a special trip... not anymore.",nQYP01FewC4UpVG24TTRmw,0,0,2,CLreuP_wNu7sDAdefoqCew
