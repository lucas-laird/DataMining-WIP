2944171,2018-06-10,0,HUr7xaaplZQ5jxb_zF8ing,Totally f'd up my order.  Drive thru is a cluster!  I couldn't figure out what language she spoke.  Food was stale and cold.  Milk shake was horrible and thin like milk.   There was so much chocolate syrup I just threw it away with the rest of the order.,x__9ZVgs5dAX4h0TRhZC7Q,0,0,1,4GMfjDXiNkeBulrqXQxeEA

3633705,2017-05-21,0,HUr7xaaplZQ5jxb_zF8ing,This place is a joke... sitting in the drive through for 30 min for a burger is ridiculous.. I wish I would have read the previous poor reviews before coming here.. no Diet Coke.. drive through service is terrible and embarrassing... finally got food and the fries were old and inedible.. burgers seem to be hours old.,-iDdf8Rkt8fqCtQaqwuNuQ,0,0,1,eEX0i2_idZLFfECO4jIcGA

Management should have some quality control when it comes to both.  You can hear the way they speak to people please do something about it.  There are plenty of other people that would be willing to do their job with a smile on their face.",pShoCMKAM1J9NJGI7KxVzg,1,0,2,VB5YiMXIsPNWRP39NuDCbw
4393790,2013-02-10,0,HUr7xaaplZQ5jxb_zF8ing,The Manager was nice. The WHOPPERS I had fresher than usual. However very poor cost value ratio. The food is overpriced for what you get.,BkidByf5jyDAy1oN2U4qyA,0,0,3,uMp8NVsZMV-E5VbvoKrNUg

5351542,2011-10-01,0,HUr7xaaplZQ5jxb_zF8ing,Its the same as any other Burger king. Not a fan of the California Burger or maybe they didn't make it right. The guacamole was way to salty. No need to mess with guac leave it alone BK.,A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,0,0,3,KaTRhvRkX7eVkJQxHGotgA
5950011,2017-07-19,0,HUr7xaaplZQ5jxb_zF8ing,"Food is fowl, but that's nothing surprising. The cashier that rang my order up Meisha or something like that, black American female was horrible. First second she saw me, with me being white and I open carry, she rolls her eyes at me, not once would she make eye contact with. Acted like she could careless to be here absolutely no customer service at all. Looks straight out of prison. If you are white avoid this place. The Hispanic female was very kind to me and all other customers though.",SEjXquVnM0_2w1sr25RcKg,0,0,1,ZtGD_x7t8ObZyFJuP9ho3A
