Food:
We ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and green peppers, and garlic sticks. The pizza was really good, but the garlic sticks were not very good in my opinion, and didn't taste like much. 

Service:
The guy serving me was very friendly and efficient.

However, we ordered two marinara sauce cups for the garlic sticks, and only ended up receiving one. No big deal, but still. 

Overall experience at this Domino's location was great, and would order from them again!",iMhwsPY3aGZAa8i0R2c9mA,0,0,4,qQkRK7eDqRsWA922xotZNw

3338036,2015-06-12,0,xPwTSwLwxyBfj6v6tWJzmg,My friends and I just had a very bad experience with the manager Irene at this location. We are on vacation and staying at the Riviera hotel and casino in Las Vegas. We received a phone call from Irene at 7:42 pm explaining to us that the pizza could not be delivered to our hotel and that someone would have to come over to some restaurant called the peppermill somewhere near the hotel to pick up the food. She didn't even apologize for the inconvenience and insisted that we come to the restaurant to pick up the order. When my friend's husband expressed his displeasure with the situation the manager Irene never offered any compensation for the inconvenience. Not once did she apologize or make any effort whatsoever to accommodate us in any way. I don't know if this is a common practice with this manager but what she failed to realize is that my friends and I all have worked in customer service at some point and we know that someone from that establishment should have called us to let us know that they couldn't deliver to our hotel way before the pizza was ready. The address was put into the system so there really is no excuse. They have lost us as customers for good. This was unacceptable and as a manager I know that she knows better,J4ATUmWgBVj_FBeQFCkS4A,1,0,1,4c9HrSXgKSKLyQWSIKQYYA

3823012,2017-10-18,0,xPwTSwLwxyBfj6v6tWJzmg,"Personally I've had my bad experiences here before where there was staff yelling at each other behind the counter and the rest of the crew just keeps to themselves. Especially when it was a manager belittling a cashier who was not competent enough to take orders which could possibly have been a new employee who needed guidance. On top of that, I was charged a lot for them to make mistakes on my order. Shows how smart I was to trust that they would get the job right until I got home to find out I was missing some key items. I should've double checked before I left. 

Today, it was a whole different staff on shift and they were actually pleasing to have when ordering pizza. They were fast and efficiently functioning as a crew to get my order done.

5715190,2016-09-29,9,xPwTSwLwxyBfj6v6tWJzmg,"Ordered pizza delivery from here on September 23, 2016.  Our pizza arrived hot and fresh in about 30 minutes which was less time than I was expecting. Also the driver was very friendly and looked professional.  I hadn't had Domino's in about 10 years because I thought their pizza was shitty and would take forever but I gave them a chance and I'm glad I did. 

I got a large pizza with pineapple, ham, and jalapenos for $15.99.  It sounds terrible but trust me when I tell you it is so delicious.  Especially when you get a bite with all three ingredients in it...it's like a MOUTHGASM.  And if you wanna make it extra white trashy like me ask for some ranch dressing to dip it in.  They charge .50 cents for each little cup of dressing tho.  

I like that when you order online there is a tracker that tells you the status of your pizza.  Has society gotten so uppity and demanding that they need to know the minute-by-minute status of their pizza delivery?  I'm more of a wait-an-hour-then-call-and-see-where-my-damn-pizza-is type of girl.  

My husband also got 8 pieces of boneless chicken for $6.49.  They taste exactly like frozen popcorn chicken.  They're nothing special so I'd recommend getting a sauce to go with them.  They have a lot to choose from like hot sauce, sweet mango & habanero, BBQ, ranch, blue cheese, garlic butter, and marinara.  

$25 bucks is kinda more than I want to spend on mass-produced pizza and frozen chicken.  I think for the price I'd rather go to Little Caesars and get the same thing for like $6 less.  

Having said that I think the DXP is really cool...it's a little Chevy Spark economy car with a pizza warmer build into it.  I've never seen one in Vegas but I think the concept is pretty neat.  Maybe that's why their pizza is so garsh darn expensive...to pay for their fancy new lil' cars.  I dunno.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,13,12,4,my_N5DMNhvyp7F3u0Mt9wg
