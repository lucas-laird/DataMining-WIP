It tasted like a bad frozen dinner and was also lukewarm. The fried rice had no flavor and we only found a few chunks of what looked like really dried out pork and a few onions in it, also lukewarm. The Crab Rangoon were the smallest I have ever seen and tasted like cream cheese wontons. No crab tasted or seen and also cold. They came with a side of cold sweet and sour sauce (about 2 tablespoons) for 6. Our normal restaurant sends approximately half a cup of sweet and sour sauce with the Rangoons and never puts the sweet and sour sauce on the chicken when it is to go. The sauce comes separately in a soup container. We also get twice the amount of food, it's hot and fresh and tastes exactly like it should.

Because not only was it over/undercooked but it was bland... It was awful. The Sesame Chicken was vile...  Tasted like frozen food passed off as authentic food. This order was unacceptable so I put it up, to return. I called the next day (today), explained the situation the woman asked me what I wanted her to do about it. So I said, make it right. She said they would replace it. Well I they required me to bring the food and receipt for them to replace the food. But I honestly think they either added to what was already there or they only added one shrimp to the shrimp fried rice... The Sesame chicken is the same except it was fresh today, over time this dish gets really squishy and gross... Anyway... Waste of $18 ...

I have been dining here for several years, back when it was located in the 4444 Center on Craig Road. 

Their menu is extensive, offering all expected Chinese dishes, done with a nice home-cooked flair. They accept calling ahead for your order so pickup is easy and they also offer delivery. 

I work very close by and occasionally I order a take out lunch special. They offer a very good value lunch special for $6 I believe that includes two dishes and an egg roll. Their food is made to order and the family that owns it is extremely welcoming and appreciative during pickup and if you choose to dine in, the service is outstanding. 

When I go to pickup my food and it's not quite ready yet, I am always offered water while I wait and the food is nicely packaged and ready for you to enjoy. 

I have dined at many Chinese places in Vegas, and Grand China, though not fine dining nor fast food take out is a nice place that falls in the middle. My favorite dish is Singapore Noodles, Extra Spicy. Can't go wrong!",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,1,2,5,v15K4Bi92HhfGfV6NW0CVw

Having just received the Maverick badge, I kind of coaxed the Mrs. into giving it a shot. My bad. The place was empty upon our arrival. When the egg drop soup is the best part of your dinner, it's kind of hard to recover. The soup was hot and fresh. What followed was average at best. The fried rice was dry and had a bland taste. The Mongolian Beef had plenty of flavor, but some of the meat was rather chewy and full of gristle. The iced tea was some of the worst I have ever tasted. It was brewed tea, but old. It had a sort of ""spinach"" taste to it. No amount of sweetener was going to help. The gal that took our order was very pleasant and friendly. The older gal that brought our food out was not.

I was really craving some nice warm wonton soup and thought I'd just go ahead and order some Chinese food in tonight while my husband goes and plays a poker tournament. I placed my order for a dinner combination of Kung pow chicken with a substitution of wonton soup for a dollar extra and fried rice at 6:11 PM. It is now 6:51 PM and my husband is just now on his way back home with dinner after the young lady over the phone told me to be 10 to 15 minutes. I did go through and read the reviews but thought because some of them were a bit older that maybe they had changed a bit but apparently I was very wrong. If you order from here expect to wait a long time for your food because regardless of what the wait time they tell you they are lying and that is not the time he will wait it will be much longer and you'll starve. I am, by no means a Chinese cook extraordinaire but with all of the Chinese food I ordered before it generally is a wait time of 5 to 10 minutes on a slammed Saturday night... tonight is Tuesday! Just plain ridiculous I'm only giving them one star in hopes that once by feed gets here it's half way decent and that is all. Please please please go with the reviews that you read because they are correct don't be silly like I was and expect something different because you'll get exactly what the reviews reveal.

***UPDATE*** After getting a chance to eat my dinner I have to say the food is actually really good regardless of the wait time I feel like at least they should tell you a longer wait time out of courtesy. The wonton soup is so delicious and had a shrimp, pieces of chicken and pork wontons. The broth was super flavorful it also had snow peas and carrots. The crab Ragoon was, well a typical crab Ragoon and the egg roll was crunchy and had lots of flavor, pretty good. The thing that I loved the most is of course the Kung pao chicken that I asked to be extra spicy which it was. I liked that there were none of those extra vegetables like the mini corn etc. and then it had a nice amount of peanuts and zucchini and the chicken was really flavorful and definitely felt good on a sick stomach. As enjoyed the fried rice being that it was a dinner combination my expectations were just simple fried rice however they serve pork fried rice it was really good. 
In my opinion customer service is just as important as food quality and I really feel if you're going to tell someone 10 to 15 minutes for their food order to be ready then it should be ready in 10 to 15 minutes and not nearly 45 minutes.",EbS9oUv1e1PlRGrdL1Wdbg,1,0,3,Gt-kiKYCdtPaLH2VcdahwQ

I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. After hiking the Deer Creek Trail, there was sufficient time to make it to New Grand China to try their lunch special. 

   New Grand China is a full-service Chinese restaurant. When I walked inside, the woman working here told me to sit anywhere. Then she set the menu on the table. I went right to the lunch special page. I noticed that the majority of the dishes were either $6.25 or $6.95. I decided on the shrimp chow mein with wonton soup and hot tea. 

  Their default soup is egg drop, however, an additional $1 upgrades it to wonton soup. I have never tasted bad wonton soup. Wonton soup is up there as one of my favorite foods. This wonton soup included a couple of wontons plus a shrimp. I enjoyed it as much as the entrée. 

  The shrimp chow mein combo included fried rice and an egg roll. The shrimp chow mein was soft noodles interspersed with some shrimp. 

  As far as service, I've seen far better. It doesn't look good when the majority of the staff stops running the restaurant to eat lunch. There were more employees at the table than there were in the restaurant. With the majority of the staffs attention focused on their lunch, it caused a delay in my Waitress checking up on me and bringing the check. The check came out to $10 and change. 

  The reality is that New Grand China is neither new or grand. In my eyes they are an ordinary Chinese restaurant that I would pass over going out of my way to visit.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,11,3,HGMsEDlUv_HQRBd2wNfihg

The food: I had the general tsaos chicken which was pretty good. The egg drop soup was pretty average. I also tried the mongolian beef which was average and so was the szechuan beef nothing was spicy even though it was indicated on the menu. Suprisingly though their pad thai is decent still not at all spicy. So like I said pretty average food but if you're in a hurry decent lunch special with plenty of food. 

The Service: The service was pretty good. Our Ice teas kept getting refilled. It was a little ackward because when we first walked in we couldn't tell who was working there because there were two different tables of employees eating. It took a few minutes for them to finish up what they were saying and seat us. Other then that I would go again if i needed a quick cheap lunch.",Jnhcs0GotxoXfH2fb1lKvg,0,0,3,dCwKst5EohHoOcY-eAWV3A

The waitress was kind of short, not at all warm, but I think this was just her way.  I'll chalk that up to the fact that she didn't seem to understand a word of English outside of the actual menu items.  I can't really hold that against her, everything else was fine.  She even came running out to the parking lot to chase us when we forgot our leftovers.  Big points for that!

orange chicken $5.75
Teriyaki chicken $5.75 ... all DELICIOUS!
