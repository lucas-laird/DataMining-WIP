It was our first time in Vitality Bowl and we had no idea what to order. Maria took her time to tell us a little bit about what they offer and the health benefit in each bowl.

When we got there we went to the counter, a young woman helped us and she told us it would be 15 minutes. So we waited 25 minutes, during which 3 sets of people have come and left. So my fiance went to the counter and asked the guy working there now, if our order was ready yet. He checked the freezer & said it had been ready since we got there. OY! Okay no big deal my daughter  thankfully kept herself busy up until the last minutes. We're driving home & I take a drink, YUCK chocolate & chalky. I ordered a Tropical Paradise, talk about surprise to the palate. So disappointed.

They have great acai bowls when the equipment works and what you order you can get! For the price they charge they should have top of the line equipment. Pretty sad when the employees say they have told management about the issues and it's not fixed, that's just money out the door, i watched three customers walk out-one refunded while I was here. No discounts for the 40 minute wait! And that is for a to go order! $40 order! Sadly I will find a new acai bowl provider until they fix their issues!

Next visit (10/14) was almost closing time and was abruptly greeted with ""sorry half of our kitchen is already closed"" in other words ""we don't want your business"". I just don't get it.

I did try to order a sirloins  sandwich for my fiancé but I knew he was hungry and the sand which would've been small with only 2 ounces of meat. He's a bodybuilder so two answers of me won't do anything. I was helped by 3 to 4 different workers. They were all nice but I don't think that any of them knew much of the business. Maybe they focus on the vitality bowls more..?? I ended up getting him food somewhere else. This location is great the restaurant was full of guests when I first walked in.

1616272,2018-05-29,0,iSvYimxtJTiyXX1QCQr0Xw,"I hesitate giving a 3, but as almost everyone has said for some reason the customer service is really lacking here, especially when there is another bowl place less than a half a mile up the street. I really like their bowls and I'm a pretty picky açaí bowl eater. However, when I pay extra ($.75) for add ins I should get a little more than a swirl. But really why does it take so long when there are 3 people in the back making stuff? And to be told, ""just so you know the wait is at least 25 minutes"" before you order may not be the best wording to use to tell people your running way behind either. There may need to be some proper customer service language training done as well. 

Now I go to Vitality 1. because it's close,  2. because I don't think they add liquid to their base, and 3. because I've met the owner he is very nice, is military and supports young adults of the military, but something needs to change.  I will drive the distance to another bowl place if I have to, great tasting bowls or not.

1746721,2017-08-24,1,iSvYimxtJTiyXX1QCQr0Xw,"New Acai bowls so close to home! 

 THEY CARE ABOUT ALLERGIES! Finally a place that doesn't pre make their Acai blend. Great portions too. Brought my family the first time (they were visiting) so we got to try plenty of bowls.

 The bowls are very, very good. I feel like I'm in Hawaii again . Interior is clean and there's plenty of seating.

-1 star for the staff member that rang us up. Also, the staff hangs out in the back until there's a guest ready to order. She didn't know much about recommending or suggesting additional toppings. I don't expect great service but at least to be treated like a normal human. They're not very welcoming...Also, you can hear them talk to each other. Very unprofessional conversations and they'll wait to finish talking to each other then go out and help customers. I know this because I was missing an item from my bowl and I had to wait for their conversation to end before they came out. Made eye contact with 3 of them more than 5 times. She proceeded to go to the back yelling ""who made the vitality bowl?!?"" Just please get me the topping that wasn't in my bowl. 

-1 star for the music...kind of random. I feel like I'm in a Mexican love drama. Which is fine I guess? Sounds like they can listen to what they want until there's at least 5 consumers inside...then they'll change the music to something mainstream or what's supposed to be played?

-1 star for inconsistency. The guest in front of us and behind us got a coupon to come back. I didn't haha. The fourth guest got asked for a rewards program and I didn't. Would have signed up since I live 1 min away but maybe they're selective to who they ask. 


Don't get my wrong by the rating, the bowls are super delicious and it's a cute place but unfortunately, the staff there really just ruined it for me. Maybe I'll take one to go next time to avoid the inconsistent staff.",n9qd2GsOBzQf4pBCLcZ8CQ,4,1,2,GPtpd09LpkAdUEC3xQP5rw

Wasn't receiving loyalty points and repeatedly told several of the young ladies that work here. They look at me like I'm a bother and offered zero resolution or care. I heard other customers complain of the same problem. I later heard from another employee, young guy, that is the ONLY one that is ever any good that they are making sure everyone's trained properly. They weren't entering the loyalty number (your phone number) correctly. Tonight I asked if she wanted my number and she literally said ""you can just scan it yourself when the ticket comes out"" and again looked at me like I'm the problem here. 

Same girl another time I was here was so rude to another customer that told her that the bowl wasn't made correctly. Again just stared at her like she was the problem. Didn't offer to fix, remake, refund, anything. I believe they were remaking the bowl but the girl never said a word until the lady started to get upset.  

They are good but too expensive for such crap service and bad attitudes. 

**********

I think the bowls are delicious but I also tend to like healthy simple foods. My husband isn't a fan of the bowls but likes the smoothies and juices. They have a pretty good variety of paninis, juices, açaí bowls, smoothies and a small kids menu. The grilled cheese panini on the kids menu is good and I'm always stealing a bite of my kids when they get it. 

The food is a bit pricey , bowls are $10-$15 and juices are $6-$8. But the quality is great and I feel you get what you pay for. 

The place is always clean, been here about 5 Times now, and never anything dirty or out of place. The staff are all extremely friendly and will gladly tell you their favorites from the menu or describe an item for you. 

You may have to wait 5-10 mins but they are making everything fresh in the back. 

I only give four stars because it seems too expensive but perhaps I'm not aware of the full cost of the products offered. I recommend coming here if you want something completely fresh and healthy. lol",1GbtKqRpDAfv13fUYIBBmA,0,0,2,xNAsK9GktfDuHarK6ZdJhQ

Don't get me wrong, I've tried them before but, didn't seem to like them as I thought they were either too tart or too sweet.

But, they say your taste buds change every 7 years so, here I am ...obsessed with acai bowls! 
Specifically their tropical acai bowl **drool** I was eating it at work once and dropped all best parts (I was saving for last) on the ground. Talk about bummer.

I've tried their dessert acai bowl and, shockingly, didn't care for it much despite my love of their choco chips in there.
I like their vitality bowl, also. Good mix of things I like at a decent price compared to the other bowls.

The one thing that could use some upgrade is the service. Everyone is nice and friendly but, I swear, I wait longer than I should for these things. I even ordered through Yelp, ran some errands that took me 20 minutes and went to pick up my order to realize they didn't have it ready and I had to wait another 10 minutes for them to make it.

I asked for extra ginger (+$1). It was so good! So good that I wanted to try to make my own rendition of it. Of course, it wasn't the same. 

Asides from their juices, they also serve bowls, smoothies, kombucha, sandwiches and salads. I think the thing that really sticks out to me here is that they offer some rare and exotic fruits here--some of them I've never heard of. Those ones are supposed to be good for you, and I'm really excited to try their bowls with those exotic fruits.

I was not disappointed upon trying this place out! Everything is made from fresh fruit and no additives. My gf and I have been here a couple times already since they have opened. Every time we have ordered they never forget any of our add-ons to our bowls and make their panini's fresh and served right from the press! 

I usually order the ""Vitality Bowl"" as I do love acai bowls. Everywhere else I have been to in Vegas that emphasizes in acai bowls (fruits n roots, bowology, daily kitchen, etc) I would say this place tops all of them! I love that their menu has many different bowl options and they are also easily customizable. My bowl was made perfectly, especially in sweetness. It wasn't too sweet nor was it bland at all. We were never charged asking for extra honey either since I crave for extra sweetness sometimes!  

Their staff is very friendly and we also met the owner Charlie. Him and his entire team are awesome! I have rarely ever met a local business with a team so caring and attentive.

As other reviewers have said, the customer service is lacking.  I ordered one Vitality Bowl this morning.  From when I walked in the door, to when I left with my food, took nearly 40 minutes. There were only 3 people in front of me when I ordered, and they got juice.  This should be a fast casual restaurant, like a Jamba Juice or Chipotle.  I do not understand how it can take so long to make a few items. 

Also, their menu is absurd.  They have it displayed on two 50 or 60"" TVs and I can hardly read anything on there because there is so much text.  I think they need to go the In N Out route and simplify the menu.  Maybe that will improve their productivity.

As a food nut I never tried Acai bowls.  I was a skeptic. But after coming here (I ordered the Warrior!) I was sold.  It's a bit pricey but you are buying healthy.  It's worth it.  It's so refreshing but SUPER SWEET.  I highly recommend this place as one of the healthier choices for desserts.  You can share the small with someone.  It's right off Blue Diamond.   All the health food nuts swear by this.  All the hipsters eat this and it gives them amazing hairlines and nice fitted pants.  So why not.  TRY THEM NOW!


Location is CLEAN, NICE, NEW

The girl that took are order recommended a bowl that had peanut butter in it but when I came to the table there is no Peanut butter to be found. I asked and they said they forgot to put it on but it was the star of the dish! That's why I gave this place one star.,xsBHs6iW96WnDDpTcQ8d4w,2,0,1,zmqeAC8g5myke-ZKq1s8QA

This place had such a large variety of items on their menu that it was almost overwhelming to choose! So typically other juice places charge $9+ for smoothies that have like 5-6 basic ingredients in them, but I really appreciate that vitality bowls uses way more super nutrient dense ingredients for only $5-6. Along with that, they have salads, paninis, and their signature açaí bowls that I will definitely try the next time I visit.",wi0d3o8tU6ahnUllJ3332w,2,2,5,z_s8z_FKTdgDAKcsc5eEYA

I have had a couple of conversations with the owner, Charlie. He is always asking what he can do better. I can name a couple of owners that I've encountered on Yelp that were not so open to learning what their company needed help with. One thing I know for sure is that owners that are open to constructive criticism will never fail. For that reason, this place will continue to be successful. 
In the month that Vitality Bowls has been open, I have been here at least once a week. I've only tried their bowls and so far, I like everything that I've tried. My current favorite is their Energy Bowl. I will continue to be a loyal customer here because of their yummy açaí bowls, great customer service, and their strive to always be better!",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,26,19,5,CNFpb3wdMzjCzSTZU9GfMw

They have a pretty big menu with a lot of options. They even serve things like paninis and salads if you don't want to get an açaí bowl. 

Parking is simple - it's located in a large plaza so no troubles there. It does take a while for them to make the bowl, probably like 8-10 minutes, but that's because the food is prepared fresh. You can definitely taste the freshness. Service is quick and friendly.

Swung by after yoga since it is in the same plaza and they offered a discount for being a member of Trufusion. $12 for a mediums acai bowl (seasonal Avocado bowl) but it was packed with premium ingredients and very filling. The owner who took my order was super friendly and informative and customized my bowl to my liking. He even followed me to my car to make sure they made it right which was very impressive. One suggestion, I wish they would offer a bowl in a smaller size for snack purposes. The medium bowl was quite filling and sometimes you just want something to snack on. One less star because it appears as if they are always understaffed therefore the food takes quite some time even when calling ahead.",LcjbUhhe6-dPJreO9aJ0cA,0,0,4,9JQbR4kiP5G3kEZkfsIVlA

I went to go pick it up in person and arrived about 2 minutes before the time it said it would be ready as I only work a couple of minutes away. When I arrived there was only one person in line in front of me and I was very pleased as I was starving and in a hurry. The employee handling the customer had no idea what they were doing as it took them about 10 minutes to successfully get them out the door. At this point, I was in a huge rush so when they handed me the Acai bowl out the fridge I paid and quickly drove back to work. When I opened the bowl, the acai was a soup. It was completely watery and looked as though they made it 30 minutes ago.

An equal opportunity acai bowl eater, I stopped by Vitality Bowls last weekend since I was in the area.  A hot, new business for the Mountain's Edge neighborhood, this is a great place to get your acai fix. The menu lists 10 different acai bowls, plus dessert and oatmeal bowls. You can also request gluten-free according to the menu.  

I chose the small 20 oz. Vitality Bowl with acai, bananas, strawberries, flax seed, organic granola, goji berries, and honey.  Usually $8.99, Charlie the owner gave me $1 off since this was my first visit; he did this for another customer who came in after me, too!

5698123,2017-05-30,0,iSvYimxtJTiyXX1QCQr0Xw,"Been wanting to try this place out since I heard about it a few weeks ago while browsing Yelp. The menu is pretty extensive for acai bowls which I am a huge fan of. When I first entered it felt a bit awkward, there was a lot of people in the store and there was no music playing which would greatly impact the atmosphere in a positive way even at a low volume (update: while writing this I had been in restaurant about 15 mins and they started playing some country sounding music, think a more uptempo lounge/spa sound would fit the vibe better.. just an opinion). They offer cold brew coffee and kombucha on tap which I've personally never seen kombucha on tap before and I believe they offer different flavors at different times.

I placed my order to go and very unexpectedly the lady told me it will be 20-30 minutes which sounds quite crazy to me for two acai bowls. I understand they are made fresh on the spot but it's basically 20-30 minutes for a thick bowled smoothie with some toppings on it. They seemed kind of busy so 20 minutes seemed understandable, but 30 sounds crazy. At least I know and you now know for any future trips to vitality bowls. (Update it took exactly 22 minutes) The guy who brought out my order, who seemed like the owner was very nice and thanked me for my patience)

Anyway to the acai bowl itself, I got the tropical bowl.. and it was excellent! The actual blend was nice and thick and not the icey smoothie blend you get from some places. The bowl was not very sweet just kind of naturally sweet so you could tell there was no sugar added. My only negative on the bowl was that there didn't seem to be that much honey I added some at home which made it better. The granola was super fresh and very good. Bananas and strawberry's were perfectly ripe and the coconut shavings added that little extra that elevated the flavor nicely (i wish there was a little bit more coconut shavings. If you dig yourself an acai bowl go check this place out! The only reason for my 4 star rating is because of the long wait.",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,0,0,4,hapTTVY6m1bMaGEQgo5Ztw
