Ordering 2 coffees and 1 sandwich, I asked for soy in the coffee, 1 hot peppermint mocha and 1 iced chai and some how received a cold peppermint mocha and hot chai both with soy. I couldn't taste the peppermint in the mocha, not sure if it was served cold is the reason. The sandwich, I requested it to be cut in half and made without cheese, the lady responded back with the sandwiches are pre-made. I'm just wondering how long before was it made? At least the second lady who was making the coffee let me take 2 apples from the basket. If you are short on time and can't run out to a different location, this is the spot for you. If you are able to get out and have time to stop somewhere else, I would do that instead. Service may be kind of slow too.",574x3ezQTKDSsq37bi3HPw,3,3,3,ojCCWypH35jn6P2oh1OuBg

Like most hotels in Las Vegas, the Renaissance hotel offers both valet and self parking.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,6,6,3,iIJl0a_2otRkWlmFGGusvA

Everything is grab-n-go which is fine, but because it's in the hotel, it's over-priced and makes you feel kinda like they could have at least asked your name first before they...well you know. Convenient though and the Illy coffee is pretty darn good!",gVmUR8rqUFdbSeZbsg6z_w,0,0,3,-PjgQ-lN0OOR_ZwiuTDCDA

My usual morning breakfat combo meal includes choice or OJ or apple juice, hot tea or coffee & choice of a pastry for $7.95.  They also offer fresh fruit, bagels, panini's, parfaits & much more.  It beats the convention centers food.",0E3zMPX6TWMUJ1NKkJNNBA,3,1,3,IawP6_dtZk_eainARtav_g
