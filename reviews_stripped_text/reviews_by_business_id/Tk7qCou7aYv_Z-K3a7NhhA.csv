I understand they were very busy, and had a lot of things going on (large party in the other room), large parties in the main room - but there's a way to be busy, and gracious, without so much...tension? It was outright awkward. One person in the party didn't get their food, then another guest was accused of taking that dish - but I guess the server didn't punch in the order correctly for the ticket? It was just weird and uncomfortable. Another guest asked for help in getting drinks ordered, and no one would respond. I'd have typically given it 1 star, but hopefully I came here on an atypical night, and would like to give them the benefit of the doubt...or maybe suggest take-out to fellow yelpers? :)",dl69uaA2E0Ee2x7kyhNWQA,0,0,3,1ZcmZ2Ln-0z2I4Hd2Gw77g

 I had chicken kabob and chicken lulu. Rice was fantastic, chicken juicy and tender. Perfect for lunch or dinner. 
Nice selection of wine and beer as well.

I walked in on a wednesday evening at 7pm. It took 15 minutes to get a table for 5. Place was busy..... Now problem here. I undrestand. There were people ahead of me in line when I got there.
BUT !!!!
After 1 hour and 25 minutes we still did not get our order.
The table next to us (friends of the house, because the waitress greeted them and gave them a hug) came 30 min after we oredered and were out before we got our food.
THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!!
I eat there once a week and It is not the way to treat your regulars !!!!!!
We were starving and this is the reason we did not leave !!!
Now I am sorry I stayed...
It was a mad house. People waiting 30-45 min TO PAY for their orders and others waiting by the door to get a table!

The food is great and the prices are fantastic for the dish I always get.

I always get the double beef lula plate when I come here.  The beef lula tastes great and like everything else on the plate is fresh.  I always get half fries, half rice and salad.  The salad is my favorite around anywhere.  I love the dressing and you get a good amount of salad on your plate.  I always add some black pepper to it and a little extra lemon.  The rice is always fluffy and actually tastes good unlike most places.  You also get a grilled tomato, hot pepper and pita bread.  You get a lot of very good food for a low price.     

The wait to get your food takes a longer than other place but that is expecting because everything is fresh.  

They always take good care of me when I ask for extras and don't charge for them.  I always get a side of onions, extra dressing and lemons.  They always give me a good amount of extra onions unlike other places.

I just wish that place was a little closer to my house.",PAvUfCRzSSl97v5M3ddUfw,0,0,5,QEiWCjt4Wzw2VSpix1DVcg

Once She finally took our order after 30 min she said it would take 25 min for food. We reluctantly ordered that was the worst mistake I ever made the twilight zone music should of been playing in the background. after 45 min of waiting I stopped her passing by our table and asked about our food she said it would be another 10 min and then she said the food was taking about 35 min to come out that should of been a sign for me to leave right then. But I decided to wait the 10 min. That was another stupid decision. I waited 20 more min. And the stopped her again and ask her were the food was she said it was coming. I asked to speak to the manager. I am not kidding she left and did not come back. next time I saw her 10 min later she was bringing food to another table that came 45 min after us and we ordered the same dishes. I was livid by this point. And asked to speak to the manager to another waiter and he said the didn't have one. I felt like punching out everyone in that place. I just had to leave before that happened.  by the I was seated at a table with folding legs you know the kind they sell for picnics at sams club.,i_01xR3eGXNr-r9HrZFBeA,0,0,1,EvrPV5XYARcMN-MLb7wFVg

They remodeled but now the place looks like it's 90s all over again. It's almost like they tried to be classy but forgot to hire interior designer. 

Food sucked - Got chicken kabob and chicken lula. Kabob was OKish but lula looked like some kind of squishy  mass of unknown origin (not sure if it was even chicken to begin with). Tasted odd too. French fries were old like they were sitting in a tray for a while. 

Service sucks - 5 waiters hanging out at the front talking to each other but we can't even get a water refill. Waitress took my card for payment and instead of proceeding to the register went on to engage in another conversation for almost 10 minutes... then realized that she had my card in her hands and decided to finally take care of business. 

And don't get me started on ""Live Entertainment"". My wife wants the guy to perform at her funeral when the time comes (and if he is still alive by then).

The parking lot was small but the Kabob House seemed to be the biggest place in the area so I had no difficulty finding it. Immediately upon entering I was met with very friendly staff that asked me if I was dining in.  The ambience of this restaurant seems to be casual yet visually captivating. Simple modern designs with a stage for music at the front immediately make this place stand out amongst other kabob places I have encountered.  The menu is very helpful for first timers of Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean food, as it has photos of each plate (all of which look delicious).  I ordered the Pork Kabob and chose baba ghanoush as an appetizer. The baba ghanoush was brought out with warm pita bread, and I do not hesitate to say that it is the most flavorful that I have tried in the states. It had a light but creamy texture, with accents of eggplant and garlic. I was pleased to see that it was not as grainy as previous baba ghanoush that I have tried. After enjoying my appetizer my pork kabob arrived in a timely manner on a very large dinner plate. The kabob was accompanied by Armenian salad, white rice, a roasted tomato, and roasted jalapeno pepper. The salad was finely chopped and oil was used as a dressing, the vegetables tasted refreshing and crispy. Next I tried the rice, which was spectacular. It had a very buttery flavor and texture. Finally I tried the pork which was by far the most flavorful kabob I've ever experienced. The spices are effectively used to provide a great flavor profile that doesn't take away from the meat itself. The pork was tender and not dry in the least. The salad, rice, and meat all compliment each other in a great way. Overall this restaurant was a great experience and you can't beat it especially for the price!

This restaurant has gotten consistently better during the few years I've been going there. The service is sometimes hit or miss but is generally very good. They have entertainment in the evening and it's very nice as he doesn't play too loudly and the selection is to a large  selection of guests who would like his music.

The kabob is always juicy and flavorful. I also always get a side of hummus, which once again, they give you a huge amount (2x what you get in a Sabra container and half the price and tastes better too!).

I never, ever, order anything else.  I don't care to. I don't need to.

There was a period where I ordered lamb chops from this place maybe three times a week.  Not a healthy period, but a damn enjoyable one.  I actually preferred to have them delivered, rather than to eat in the restaurant, because by the time they got to my house, the juice from the chops had flavored the bed of rice up quite nicely.  The salad usually is dressed a little heavily, but there are plenty of veggies and not just a bunch of iceberg lettuce.  

Price is LOW for chops this fine.  

Eating IN the restaurant is kind of an odd experience, as the mix of fine linen, diner-type menu, large screen TV's, and ""exotic"" foods can be jarring for some.

The menu consists of a mix of traditional Lebanese and Armenian dishes and it is as authentic as they can be. Nice atmosphere with live piano music. My favorite place to treat my friends or first-timers to middle eastern cuisine. Do not expect a full Lebanese selection as they mostly have BBQ selections but the taste is excellent and quality of food which screams freshness, especially the Beef Kabob which is great. The best part is that they deliver and we order at least once a week to my place of work at Crystals, and even got many of my peers to get hooked on the place, especially with their free delivery! 
Before starting though, I recommend the famous Lebanese salad, Tabouli and the Hummus (not the best I had, but decent), the Babaganush (mashed eggplant paste) or the Grape Leaves (Dolmas as they also call it), among others... Just be careful not to indulge too much because the main dishes are huge and generous. If you are not sure what to get, man of the plates are combos with many combinations of chicken and beef to chose from... Their desserts are the only thing that is disappointing is the lack of middle-eastern selection of pastries which the region is famous for, but after you finish your main entree, I doubt you will have room for any anyway.
The place is good for groups or private parties, as we always run into one from time to time; but no worry, they have an extra room they open up to still accommodate others.

Recently, though, I had to take a break from this place as every time I ordered from them within the past year, I was getting chicken kabob with a really weird rubbery texture. It honestly was like they froze it, defrosted, froze it, and then defrosted again. 

Tonight I was really craving their rice and the way their food used to taste so I gave it another try hoping that this time it would be much better. 

I didn't eat the kabob at all because I was so disgusted by what they served me as the chicken lula.  It was hard on the outside, like it had been sitting out all day.  The outside was wrinkled and dry. 

I am never ordering from here again. Can't believe they would serve customers this food and think it's ok.

The décor is cheap and lackluster too, but the food makes up for it.
Lula Kebobs (chicken or Beef) always moist and delicious and portions are amazing for the price. Similar dish in most other places range from $14-$20 and doesn't come near the quality. Their Lula Kebob is a mere $9.99 and for that price it's incredible!
The Borch Soup is amazing - a must try.
Lamb chops are nice too.
Stuffed Grape leaves (Sarma) are very good, as are the Babaganush, the Tabuleh and the roasted Vegetable salad.
Stay away from the Chicken Kiev - it's not really chicken Kiev and it's awful.
The Hummus tasted not quite authentic, but maybe it's because it's more of a Russian Armenian place...? I'm also not a fan of the very dry and thin Pita bread. It's semi OK when it comes out warm, but turns into cardboard within 2-3 minutes.
Chicken Skewers are a bit dry, but nicely seasoned.
A friend of ours hosted/catered  a huge dinner party there last year. They served so many specially made dishes (that are not on their regular menu) and so much food and alcohol. The service was amazing and attentive, each dish was perfectly made, and the cost (considering what we got for it) was the best catering deal one can imagine. Highly recommended for large parties if you don't mind the décor being a bit cheap and tacky. 
The entertainment (live music) they have there is also on the painful side, but the Russians and Armenians seem to love it, so I guess it's a matter of opinion and culture.

We had reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away, but we sat there for 20 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order. We finally ordered 3 hummus & pita, 2 Greek salads, and two Kabob Platters (beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken lula kabob, beef lula kabob, rice , French fries.) They ran out of pork kabob. 

We finally got our water, hummus and pitas, and the Greek Salads, but we couldn't eat our salad because we didn't have any plates or utensils. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get our plates and utensils.

The inside of the plates are about 8""x8"".  Half plates cover with salad, one grilled tomatoes and one grilled jalapeno.  Half plate cover with buttery rice and topped with your order of meat.  It also comes with pita bread which I was too full to try.  Alot of food for reasonable price.  That's the best lamp chops, juicy, tender, and not gammy.  All meats are cooked perfectly, juicy and taste great.  If I have to put them in order, from the best: lamp chop, beef kabob, chicken kabob, beef lula. Soda is $1.95, refillable.

1721265,2012-12-31,1,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"Three years of living in Vegas and passing by this place atleast a dozen times, thinking I've got to try this, well, today was the day. Assuming it is a ""Middle Eastern"" restaurant, the waitress proudly mentioned it is actually an  Armenian Restaurant, but most of the dishes are interpretations of popular  ""Mediterranean dishes"".  I stand corrected, seriously, I appreciate the correction.  

Let's start from the beginning.  Waited to be seated about 2 minutes, but was graciously welcomed once acknowledged.  While waiting, I notice the decor was tasteful, simple, yet warm and the lighting soft, which distracted for the asbestos drop ceiling.  We were then seated and no one came back for atleast 10 minutes. I really wished someone would have dropped off atleast water and asked if we had any questions, but when the waitress came, her full attention was on us. 

At first, I wish the menus were a bit more sophisticated than a two-sided laminated 8 x 11 page with low resolution pictures and prices...even the wine menu looked like more effort was spent on it, thought it was also a laminated page, just better paper.  However, given the price point of the food (bargain!), pleasant setting, and nice service when attention is on you, who really cares?

We ordered our alcoholic drinks and our main entrees.  The wine list has ordinary wines (Yellowtail, Columbia Two-Vines), but all so had a few wines from their homeland.  However, regrettable I ordered a Two-Vines Merlot instead of trying Areni (Sp?), a dry red wine from either Armenia or neighboring Georgia.  My husband initially ordered a beer listed on their menu, but no longer have, the waitress sweetly and proudly convinced my husband to try one of their Armenian beers, which he was pleasantly surprised at the quality and taste.  Wines are pleasant prices around $5 bucks, beers are even a bit less.

It took about 5 more minutes to receive our drinks and wine, and about 20 minutes to receive our food.  I took this as a good sign that the food was cooked to order, when ordered. I had the lamb chops.  The waitress happily obliged my request to substitute additional salad for rice or fries.  My husband ordered the Beef Lulu and beef kebab.  The food: Beyond expectations, it came out hot, freshly made/prepared as requested, and very, very tasty, especially given the price point.   Honestly, I have been at restaurants that have lamb chops on the menu which are half the portion at twice the price, and nothing was prepared as well as Shish Kebab House....even my husband devoured my other two chops as he constantly expressed that they didn't taste ""gamey"".  Thanks hun, for finishing off my lunch tomorrow.  (LOL)

I love the waitress' confidence and pride in the food she served.  She chuckled as she confirmed we were pleased with our dishes, since there was nothing left on our plates.  What she doesn't even know is that we weren't even ""hungry"" yet we ""managed"" to finish our food.  

While service is a bit slow for my liking, the waitress was polite and there is no denying this is good food for a good value.  You will not be disappointed and you will be a fan too! I cannot wait to come back!",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,2,1,4,6xUKcuaEUasEMps-r4e0AQ

Meanwhile, every other guest who entered before and after us, received their food many of whom ordered the same plates we did. I brought this to the attention of another staff member who rolled her eyes in response and walked away. After approximately 90 minutes, we did not receive our food and left.

My colleague is obsessed with this place & has tricked me yet again to get lunch from them today. Never again...

We have ordered from here several times and the delivery guy is always late, this is annoying but because the food was flavorful we dealt with it. The first time we ordered I got a chicken plate which comes with a salad and rice. I always eat my Mediterranean meals with a side of yogurt sauce, it's just how I roll. We asked for a side of it and it came which was great. On the next order they ignored the request and no sauce came at all. I called to complain and they said you can buy a side of it for $5. A side of sauce for $5?!?!?!? This is nearly the price of the meal itself. They now want us to buy a huge side of it which nobody can eat. I don't want or need a gallon of yogurt sauce. 

Today we ordered again and I called to say I wanted a side of sauce just like the first order, the nasty lady on the phone with zero customer service skills said, sorry we can't & you need to order the $5 gallon of it. I told her this made no sense and I would no longer give them my money for the lamest nazi sauce rule in the universe. I just want a small side of it like the first round. 

Dear business owner, your policy is lame and you have lost weekly orders from our office. I would gladly pay you extra for sauce but never $5 for a gallon of sauce that will go to waste. It's sad to see local businesses making poor decisions.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,13,10,1,_adMAzyP1HVEqfEG37geWg

We all sat down and had our lunch and not one person was happy with the quality and or flavor.  Each persons comment was the same - no flavor and the salad is literally drowned in oil, soggy and completely flavorless nor did one person eat any of their salad.

Salad was full of fresh and perfectly ripe veggies, perfectly flavored, and a great accompaniment to the mix of meats in the plate: two small lamb chops, two pieces of lamb kabob, two pieces of chicken kabob, and a skewer of beef koobideh (ground formed beef), served with roasted tomato and pepper.

The restaurant is larger than I expected and the ambiance is quite pleasant. I guess I had expected a more fast food set up than an actual dimly lit restaurant setting. Pleasant surprise there, good job Shish Kabob. There is a stage right at the entrance and some chairs around the waiting area. Personally, I would recommend a set up for a host stand so people are not walking in confused if this is the entrance. Also, might help them keep things more organized. But anyway, there is live music on a Saturday night. I walked in to a keyboard playing and I loved it. It is not distracting but just very pleasant and calming. Come back again, keyboard man, you are pretty darn cool.

The portion size is fantastic. As a huge fan of Mediterranean food, this did not disappoint. Shared the lamb kabob plate and the kabob combo platter. Both come with pita, salad, and a choice of rice or fries. You can opt to have half and half, which is what we ordered. Also comes with a grilled tomato and grilled green pepper. The salad is pretty delicious and the meat is both tasty and tender. The portion size is fantastic. The lamb kabob is delicious and tender but the kabob combo platter won me over.

She said, you can sit wherever you'd like, so we did.

Okay here's the story, Buddy and I planned on hitting up Mother's Korean BBQ in China town. I no longer felt up to it and decided i needed a Kebab (I dont care to me it's KE-BAB, i talk about KE-BABS with my British and Australian friends it's not a kah-bob it's KE-BAB). My buddy works around the area and orders delivery at least twice a week. TWICE A WEEK?! other then rice i dont eat anything twice a week willingly. We GOTTA check this place out.

We arrived at 9:45 and closing is at 10:00. The staff allowed us to dine in regardless of their closing time. Our waitress was brand new and possibly fumbled our order so another waitress came over to confirm everything. Now some would consider this an annoyance because they should have got it right the first time but i actually approve of this. It's better to ask again and get it right rather then follow through only to discover someone made a mistake somewhere.

We both ordered #19s (Combo Kebab) but with personal touches. 
I had a straight 19 which has Rice, Salad, Grilled Chili & Tomato, A Pork Chop, two of each Chicken & Beef Kebabs, and a Beef Lula kebab.

Buddy had the same but replaced his rice with half rice half fries, all beef kebabs, and a chicken lula.

We also had a side of lamb chops were were...what ever i'll say it...ORGASMIC 

Rice: had that classic flavor found in middle eastern, indian, and mediteranean cuisine. I have been unable to replicated and havent found a female of listed above ethnicity to date so the rice will still impress me until i learn it's secrets. 

Beef Kebab: Perfectly seasoned not too dry but not all that juicy. Had a lot of flavor and was very tender. Epic Win

Chicken Kebab: Same as the beef but with chicken. Epic Win

Beef Lula Kebab: Nice flavor but the texture is what got me, it seemed softer then burger meat but had twice the flavor. The overly soft texture didnt sit too well with me but then again i ate it all. Epic uh...not sure if i like it but there's no trace of it on my plate

Chicken Lula Kebab: Perfect just perfect, the flavors and most importantly the texture was perfect. Epic Perfection

Pork Chops: No impact No idea. All i know is it fits VERY nicely in the to go box. Not a small pork chop either mine covered nearly half the plate. Epic Breakfst

Side of Lamb Chops: Words can not begin to describe...Should have sent a Poet. In all seriousness i was ready to throw my entire plate on the floor and completely devote the next few minutes to munching on these lamb chops. We as Americans need to embrace Lamb more...Epic Lamb

Having a salad on the side is a very nice way to balance out the savory and the salty with crunchy tartness. The Pita bread wasnt fresh but i cant expect more when they stayed open late to accommodate us very close to their closing time. 

Overall two combo plates, two sodas, customization on one of the combo plates, and a side of 4 pieces of lamb chops for 40 dollars.

WAIT WHAT?!?! 20 quid per person?! that's a 22oz steak @ the Cortez Room...That's All you can eat Korean BBQ @ Sula...here 20 bucks not only got us each a combo plate but the Lamb too?! 

Sorry my other favorite place for cheap eats you've already been forgotten and replaced with Shish Kebab House...",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,6,5,5,R565xmPA-aQQ0GYVgnriQQ

The chicken and beef was well cooked and seasoned well. It also came with pita and salad. My girlfriend ordered the lamb gyro and she loved it as well. They are very generous with the meat. The only reason why I would rate it a 4/5 is because the server was kinda awkward. Almost as if we were a burden to him. He also messed up my girlfriends order by giving her rice instead of fries. We made it clear while ordering she wanted fries. It wasn't a big deal we asked for him to get fries and it was done. The real issue was that he tried to tell me they voided the order of fries on the receipt, but it still showed up on the total.

Let me start off by stating that when it comes to SKH,  We usually have it conveniently delivered to the house. (Yes, they deliver).  I usually just stick with the Hummus with Beef, which is perfectly done hummus -accompanied by  warm beef on top with plenty of warm pita. Main course I usually indulge with the #3 ? Chicken Kabob & Beef Lula that comes with a heeping side of rice and Armenian salad, oh and a charred jalapeño and tomato - yummy . 

Service is great and attentive, there's plenty of vodka and huge bottles of Russian beer for under $5. The food is big portions, enough for the gf and I to share ..

That said - this place is a definite thumbs up.  It's quite obviously a family run restaurant, apparently Armenian, and extremely good.  The food was great - I wish I knew where they buy their lamb, some of the best I've ever had - event the rice was not clingy/starchy - but fluffy and good.  We also had the cheese platter and the Armenian salad - we're not Armenian, but if this is how they eat, maybe we can convert.

We ordered it for delivery - it arrived on time (well, maybe a little late) - delivered by a very polite young man - and there was a charge for delivery, but the owner assured us that the driver got the whole charge, and there was no need to tip (wish I had though).  It was not exactly hot, but it was warm enough to enjoy - and there was a little too much of it.  They gave us an entire bag of delicious pita bread along with over-sized orders of delicious food.  I suspect the dill and mint and onions included with the cheese platter are from someone's garden because you could actually taste them - and the grilled tomato and pepper with the kabobs was clearly from the same place.

One of the problems with Las Vegas is the over-abundance of large chain restaurants (come on, we don't need anymore BJ's Breweries, Mimi's Cafes, Claim Jumpers or (especially) Olive Gardens - and the strip joints are way overpriced and crappier than they claim to be - this kind of family owned, personal service place is precisely what we need more of.  And the price is VERY reasonable for what you get.

I told the owner when I called that she should make it good so that we would eat with them again - and I have to say she kept her end of the bargain.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND - and we'll be visiting the restaurant as soon as we can to have the experience in person.  By the way - brief message to the owner - not sure who the young man who delivered our order was - but give him a raise.",fPvu-YaYgvNN_LBWILes2w,0,0,5,xiNQvTxSZP3AWFvkqShX0w
2132948,2012-07-30,0,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"The Shish Kabob house is a wonderful family oriented dining experience. A visit to this restaurant was a special treat because I was dining with my sister, brother-in-law, and my darling nephew! 

Of course, dinner was delicious with the first courses being hummus (great texture and flavor), tabuleh (fresh herbs, bright flavors, and a zesty diced tomatoes), and cucumber yogurt (finely diced cucumbers with creamy texture) Overall, I'd give the appetizers a solid 3.5 

For  my main course, both my nephew and I ordered the lamb chops. Our entree came with a side of Greek salad (the salad was a bit wilted and the dressing was bland), Roasted tomato and jalapeno (perfectly charred), rice (a bit soggy), and lamb chops (my medium rare order was actually served medium well, and my nephew's well done order was so over cooked that  even one of the bones split in half when he picked the lamb chop up). However, even though they were over cooked, they still tasted good with only a mild gamey flavor. Overall, I'd give the main entree a 3.0

The service however was excellent. Our server was attentive and persistent. He had a cheery demeanor, happily provided us with our special requests (extra lemons ~ great drizzled over the lamb chops, and tabasco sauce for my brother in law's lula kabob.) Overall, I'd rate the service a solid 4.0

Lastly, the ambiance was very nice. They had a birthday party celebration and the restaurant was fully booked which my have accounted for the food being over cooked as in previous dining experiences, according to my sister, the food was much better prepared. 

Tips: They accept Restaurant.com gift cards, bring a little extra soy sauce to complement the rice (my nephew's advice), and request for the salad dressing to be served on the side. Also, they have live entertainment on Saturdays which would make for a great date night!

No problem until thirty minutes passed and more & more table that came in after us were getting their dinner. At this point, I was a bit frustrated. I asked another server about a large table getting their food before us. She responded with, ""they ordered before they got here."" (They literally got there 20 minutes into us sitting there. We should have already had our food.) I pointed to 4 other tables that had received their food and arrived after us. I feel I need to note we didn't have anything complicated. It was a very basic order of two plates, with no alterations. She didn't respond to me, went and talked to our server, & 3 minutes later we had our food. Hmmmm!!!

Their lamb chops. Perfectly chargrilled, flavorful, not at all gamey and super cheap. For around $15,  around 4-5 chops with a generous helping of salad and rice is an awesome deal.",HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw,3,1,3,F0YkL0K7Jb-whhpEuZmxFw

The dishes were all very good (except the lukewarm steak fries that came with the gyro) and the portions were huge.

3005489,2014-08-02,0,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"Came here about a week ago to pick up an order that we called in. We ordered the lamb chops, a beef/chicken kabob combo, a lamb/pork kabob combo (not on their menu, but they kindly combined it for us at no extra charge), and an order of dolmas. This was our first time trying this establishment and didn't realize it was more of a dine-in restaurant until we arrived there. That being said, the place is about a 10 minute drive from our house. 

When we arrived and said we were there to pick up our take-out order, the hostess told us it would be about another 7 minutes. That's fine. There was live music there to keep us entertained during the wait. As we waited, we noted the pleasant decor and atmosphere of the place. Impressive for just a ""house of shish kabob"". As we waited, we were kindly approached by another employee to ensure that we were being taken care of. After about a 15 minute wait, we still had not received our items. That in addition to the 10 minutes it took us to drive here. After about another 10 minutes, our bagged items finally arrived. All in all, it was a total wait of 35 minutes from the time I called in, until the time the items were ready. That's an very long wait for take-out in my book. 

The wait was disappointing although truth be told, they were extremely busy since it was a Friday night. The hostess finally handed us our items along with the bill and noted to us that 20% was already taken off of our bill due to our long wait. Needless to say, we were extremely appreciative of the gesture. That was totally unexpected and a great display of ensuring customer satisfaction. 

Now onto the food!!! What can I say? Outstanding. Definitely the best shish kabob I've had in Vegas and that I can recall in a long time. The chicken, beef, lamb, and pork were all moist and flavorful, and the lamb chops were terrific as well. The dolmas were okay, but it's a tall order to beat the homemade dolmas that my Lebanese neighbor used to make. 

All in all, the food was superb and the portions were large. Heck, even the bed of rice that the meats sat on was delicious. The quality of the food and the fact that they made up for the long wait by giving us a discount made this a win-win for us. We will definitely be back.

3183636,2013-04-29,0,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"TL;DR - This review is based on obtaining Take-Out.  Waited twice as long as estimated time, price of food was 3 dollars higher than told over the phone.  Service was unexpected and saddening.

I logged back onto yelp after two years just to write a review for Shish Kabob House.  Before I continue any further I would like to say that the food is definitely fine, however; much is to be desired in my opinion with the service.

Order: Chicken Lula with Beef Kabob.

Ordered at 11:59 am, I was told over the phone that this specific combination is not available on the menu.  The order taker re-assured me that it's fine, she will put it in and that my total will come out to be 9.95 since it comes as a ""special order"".  I am fine with this, any other order that relates to this one is around 9.95 and 8.95.  This is completely reasonable.  The order will be ready in ABOUT 15 minutes.

I arrive at the restaurant at 12:04, much earlier than anticipated.  One waitress (out of three) notices me after sitting for about 5 minutes and proceeds to ask me if I have been seated.  I inform her that I ordered over the phone and that I am aware it should not be ready.  She is friendly and acknowledges my comment and continues to do her job.   

The next time I check my phone is 12:22.  I look around and see there are a maximum of six tables occupied in the restaurant.  I sit for another three minutes, and that is when the same waitress is kind enough to check on my order for me.  12:27, a gentleman walks in and is immediately seated, and his food arrives a minute after himself.  I can only assume this gentleman had also ordered his food over the phone.  By this time I realize EVERYONE has their food.  At least two tables excluding the lone gentleman came after me.  

At 12:29:50 (which is what the receipt says) I am handed my check by the same waitress and am told that my total will be $12.92.  Absent-minded I hand my card over, but I catch myself as she is ringing me up.  

----------What occurs next is what I am most discontent over---------

Up until this point I have waited patiently for 30 minutes on an order that was supposed to take 15 minutes.  During those 30 minutes I watched as everyone got their food, people before I came in and after I came in.  

I stopped the waitress and explained that perhaps the price is wrong, and that I was told over the phone it was going to be $9.95.  Immediately I got a tone and haste that I only know too well myself having worked over two years in the service in industry; ""I work here and I know I am right, let me not only prove it, but also now try to rush our interaction so I can continue my job.""  I was not questioning her knowledge of the service at the store, and up until this point she was extremely friendly and attentive.  She proceeded to show me the menu and the $11.95 priced Beef Kabob and explain her reasoning, to which she stated three times in rapid succession the reason why it's $12.92 is because ""it is an inconvenience for the chefs"".  However; EVERY combos item (beef lula/chicken kabob, etc) is in the 8.95-9.95 range.  So how is it I am being charged three dollars MORE for a beef kabob/chicken lula combo if there are combos with a beef kabob only priced at 9.95?  I informed her again that I was told a lower price over the phone, and she curtly ""apologized"" for whoever took my order.   I was handed the card receipt and left at the counter, to which I signed and left the establishment with no acknowledgement or thank you.  

I don't mind paying for food.  I don't mind if I end up having to pay extra for someone else's mistake.   I don't mind waiting longer.  I don't mind watching everyone get their food before me even though they arrive later than myself.  

What I DO mind is being given horrible attitude for a mistake that was NOT made by myself.  Of course I don't want to pay extra for something that was originally going to be another price, and there should be an air of courtesy tied to that.  Our time could has easily been resolved is I was told, "" I'm very sorry about that, our waitress made a mistake.  I realize also that your order took much longer than expected, allow me to charge you the price that was discussed over the phone.  However; for next time this same combination will cost you $12.92.""

What I wrote above is acceptable service.  That is courteous service.  That is service that will make me return again and again.  I would return JUST for the same combination at $12.92 if that was the conversation we had. But that is not the case.  Instead I was treated as if ""these mistakes happen often and that I need to suck it up and pay and leave.""  If we weren't jostling over three dollars, they would have made way more in my return.

Although the food was fine, the experience left a very sour taste in my mouth.  I don't believe I will be headed back anytime soon.",pi9pLY85V4y_mC6GjzD8bw,1,0,2,yhy7Oc4b2r2pfPDRTMWc9Q

The wall decor in this restaurant is modern and looks more like a lobby than a dining theme.  But it's a pretty interior.  This is white table cloth dining which usually means more formal.  We weren't rejected for being casual.  

Their menu is a multi-page laminated binder type book, with appetizing photos and prices.  Pricing is decent and comparable to most Mediterranean or Middle Eastern restaurants I've dined.  But here the ambience is nicer.  

I tried their yogurt soup.  I liked it alot.  It wasn't recommended, which was odd coming from our waiter.  I understand yogurt generally is a cold food - not hot.  It reminded me of a sour tamarind soup Filipinos cook with gata (coconut milk). So I enjoyed the yogurt soup.

Service is mediocre. Thus minus a point from being almost 5 star.  The food took a little long, but super delicious.  We ordered family style for five, which is the smarter way to go if you have at least 4+ people.  Our check took even longer.  Unusual as they didn't offer dessert.  Good thing we were full.

3409050,2016-07-31,1,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"How have I never heard about this place until last night? My usual go-to for Mediterranean food was Mad Greek and since they closed down, I have tried a few places in the hopes that I would find one to fill the gaping hole that Mad Greek left (lol) 

My boyfriend has gone here before with his parents but failed to mention just how good it is here. Last night he said we should eat dinner here so thankfully it's about a 5 minute drive from my house, I believe this location is in a complex on Flamingo/Rainbow beside a hookah/vape shop. 

There's a wide parking lot in front of the restaurant so don't worry about finding a spot. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was that there was live music to my right. An older man with a piano was playing and singing in another language. At first glance this place looks like it could be or was also a ballroom. It's a wide open space with no counters or cash registers or anything that would indicate this is a restaraunt.

Tons of tables, tons of people. Compared to the almost always empty Mad Greek (and I loved Mad Greek) I had high hopes that this was going to really raise the bar for me. I brought in my service dog and was very pleased when there were no questions asked, aside from the expected staring from other patrons.

Well lit, simple decorations on the wall, music as we eat... Nice! I searched through their menu and to be honest, I was so hungry I really didn't focus too much on anything other than the words ""SALMON SHISH KABOB"" because, SALMON?! I love Salmon and I've never been to a Mediterranean restaurant that served Salmon, so obviously guess what I ordered? My boyfriend ordered the chicken Shish kabob. Our order took awhile to arrive, assuming that the chicken and salmon take longer, and the only reason I noticed it was taking longer was because people who had arrived after us had received their food first.

I didn't mind, because as soon as my glorious plate was placed in front of me, I couldn't think of anything else. It's a really large plate of food for the price. Same for my boyfriend's plate. The salmon and the rice almost melt like butter in your mouth, I couldn't stop eating! The salad was delicious although I could care less about the pepper and the roasted tomato.

Naturally I couldn't finish my food, although I would if I could! We were given to-go containers to pack the rest, but I will definitely be coming back and bringing some friends along with me! I have finally found my go to spot; you guys will be seeing me quite often ;D",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,2,2,5,joqVNQD24Mh7a_ubHmTXSw

The hummus was delicious and you can't go wrong with hummus. I was impressed with the prices as well. This place is maybe $3-5 cheaper than the other places, but it doesn't mean that the quality of food declines. We ordered the beef kebab, beef lula, and lamb kebab. You can request to get half French fries and half rice. The lamb kebab was well seasoned and tender. It was juice and flavorful! The beef lula, is like a koobideh. It was well seasoned and cooked well. The grilled tomato with the rice and meat was on point.  I will say, I liked the lamb better the the beef lula, but both were yummy.

3533817,2012-01-16,0,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"After having a craving for some fresh meats I took my boyfriend here last night. And while it's not my first time going to Shish Kabob House, last night made me a set in stone fan who will definitely be visiting on a frequent basis.

NOTE: I did notice that they had new menus printed and the prices went up just a tad recently. Nothing that would make me leave though, considering that I was surprised with how cheap they've been in the past. But I thought I'd let you know that the orange menus in the pictures are not the most recent prices.

The restaurant is in a simple room which holds a nice ambience, something my boy and I both really enjoy. There's a small stage up front on which they occasionally have live music and two TVs on opposite walls.

We started the evening by being greeted and seated immediately and ordered some hummus with pita ($4.95) for our appetizer. The pita is brought out warm and the hummus smooth and flavorful. If you happen to run out of pita before the hummus they'll bring out some more too ~

The entree menu consists of a standard plate that has salad, your choice of rice, fries or half/half, and then your choice of meats which covers practically the whole spectrum. Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Pork, Salmon and Shrimp (and there's even some ""American"" eats if you happen to have someone not so adventurous in your group). In the past I've always ordered the Lamb kabobs ('cause really, how often do you get to eat lamb?) while I sampled from my friends' plates, but I think I've officially found my regular. ($8.95 - $14.95)

 #19 ($13.95) - Beef & Chicken kabob, Beef lula and a Pork chop, which I found out from our waiter could be subbed for 2 lamb chops! Perfect! I snatched up that plate while my boyfriend order just lamb chops ($14.95).

Now let me say... those lamb chops are the reason why I'm writing this review. When something blows me away, I have to tell others, and while I did have to wait extra long for my chops, our waiter said the perfect line when he brought them to me. ""Belated, but delicious!"" He couldn't be more right. I was sorry when each bite was over; The meat was tender, flavorful and perfect. Those lamb chops were seriously one of the best things I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

Overall I can't say anything better about this place. It's nice for a casual lunch or even if you're taking out a group for dinner. The prices are reasonable enough that you don't have to feel bad if you want a full course meal and they constantly have Restaurant.com certificates available so you can't go wrong. The portions are generous, delicious and while it may take time to get your food out, you can tell it's because everything is prepared fresh. I dare you to leave this place hungry! :]",QwF1v-bnTPECj2nYEQczBw,0,0,5,DFhHJIVlzqLuKsKn7EKF_Q

I planned it for months and had around 100 guests of which half were from other states & overseas.  I specifically mentioned i did not want the crap wine (yellowtail) which was included in the price. They said no problem and to just let them know which wine i wanted and it would be $2-3 bucks upcharge per person. I spoke to manager and told him which wine i wanted.  He said they can't charge me per person becsuse it's an ""expensive wine"" and it would be $50 per bottle. It's a $9 wine at any store!! So we settled for the next crappy option they had for a few bucks per person. We then also upgraded to whiskey and ended up paying an extra $10 per guest, but they excluded the cognac.  Um why??!!  They also said that they would stop serving us at 2:30, but we could stay as long as we wanted. At 2:22am, with absolutely no warning, they put the lights all the way up and started taking all the bottles off the tables. I was mortified the way they did it!  Almost $8000 and they basically told us to go *uck ourselves.   I asked them to please turn the lights down and the head waiter was so rude.  Not to mention the serbian waiter was complaining since 9am (was there early to decorate) that he was going to have an 16hr day. So glad my mom told him ""i worked 72hrs, get over it"".  It was so damn embarassing the way they treated us!!!  I was and still am upset!  The food was good, but would never recommend this place for a private party.

Service: The head waiter assigned to us was great.  He made sure the servers got the dishes set, glasses were filled and cleared plates asap to keep the great food coming.  When my brother from another mother's contact lens popped out, he brought over one of the sauce containers with a lid to hold it temporarily so he wouldn't lose it.  Fantastic

Food: The kabobs are my current champ in Vegas.  All the kabobs on the group platter were tasty, fresh and juicy from all my visits.  The margarine rice works so well with all the kabobs.  The hummus, Pita Bread and all vegetables accompanying the kabobs were all fresh and prepped perfectly.  Great seasoning and preparation all around.  High quality mediterranean food for a really fair price.

Value: Mid range pricing for some high quality Kabobs and tasty complimentary plates with big portions.  All the dishes we had were top notch for the price.  Good times and great value.

Ambiance:  There's a stage with a mini-dance floor at the front of the restaurant. There was some live music during dinner and some guests took the mic from to karaoke some songs sang in a Middle Eastern language.  Lots of energy and the music kept it fun.  It might be a little loud for some especially if you're on a date.  Wide Open room with lots of tables and seats.  No walls or partitions to separate the seating.

A great place to have some great kabobs with family and friends.  A little too wide open, bright and loud for a quiet date night.  The kabobs really are a treat and accompanied with the great service makes for a great casual dining experience.  The portions are so big, you're most likely be taking some of the food home which is definitely a good thing.

1. Beef Lula- this was tender and juicy
2. Beef Kabob- also tender/flavorful
3. Chicken Kabob- too dry to fully enjoy it
4. Porkchop- overcooked and a lil too grilled for my liking
The rice was delicious, but I'm sure it had a lot of butter of salt. The salad was decent....a lot of onions, so if you plan on taking your significant other there, beware of onion breath!

She got this green salad with tomatoes for our appetizer I forgot what it was called but it was delicious. It was refreshing and we ate it with pita bread. She ordered the steak and chicken combo and I ordered the lamb chops. I was very happy with my lamb chops. They were juicy and tender. I also liked the rice that was under the lamb. It was flavorful and was moist rice. The salad that came with my lamb chops was very refreshing and great salad dressing as well. I love my dish. I'm really not a big Mediterranean eater but this place was delicious. Us girls each got a glass of wine. I got the white Zinfandel and Shannon got the Chardonnay. I wish they had Moscato wine here but the white Zinfandel worked. I like sweet wine although I was eating red meat and suppose to drink red wine I love me white wine. Definitely recommend this place.

She brought home some left overs.  We love ethnic food, but rarely eat Mediterranean style cuisine.  We started with an order of Humus $4.95.  I think that is too much for humus, but it is really good and there is a lot of it.  The humus comes in a large tub and they constantly refill the pita basket.  It is a lot of food.  You will be tempted to fill up on it while waiting for your entree.  The food takes a really long time to come out.  They are so slow.  While waiting we admired the dining area.  Seems to be well decorated.  Not many guests, but lots of family hanging around.  Turns out the place is Armenian, not Greek.  I know nothing of Armenian cuisine, but seems the same to me.  The food finally arrived and the portions were big.  Everything seemed super fresh.  The meat and grilled veggies were hot, juicy, and flavorful.  I love this food.  Plus, grilled items are healthier.  The meat was so juicy, not dried out.  The jalapeno pepper was hot.  I like slicing the tomato on the bed of rice.  The juices run and the rice soaks up the flavor.  I ordered the #19 Combo Kabob $14.95, which came with one pork chop, four pieces of beef kabob, and four pieces of chicken kabob.  Although it was good, I liked the pork chop the least.  My wife ordered the #5 Beef Lula Kabob $8.95.  It is like an uncased sausage grilled on a stick.  The seasoning was wonderful.  I think all entrees come with a Mediterranean salad, pita, grilled tomato, grilled jalapeno pepper, and white rice.  We could not finish the food and had to get a to-go-box.  I could not leave without a piece of baklava.  It taste good, but one little piece cost $2.95.  I think that cost too much for such a small piece.  I really, really like this place and recommend it highly, but beware, they are so slow and some of the pricing is a bit high.  (Entrees are priced fairly, but appetizer and dessert are a little high.)  Also, we went back twice since then and every time the food was so, so slow.

They interior decor was really nice. It certainly didn't felt like Las Vegas, but it didn't felt I was home either. We sat out on the patio, between the hookah lounge and the restaurant. It wasn't hot for some reason (we expected it to be).

Our waitress was a lady thats been working there for 12 years. (insane!) First thing I wanted, w-a-t-e-r!  (I chug down 2 large glasses of water before my order came out!)

I couldn't make sense what the menu entrees and I complained a little bit about it. My friend took it serious and told me to get the kabob with a choice of different type of meats. I chose lamb (because I haven't had lamb in years). After 2 glasses of water, our food finally came out. I have to say, they weren't the most presentable foods I've seen. They look like one long turd with a side of pilaf rice. After my first bite though I have to say, I don't recall looking up to my fellow travelers and talk with them until I finished my dish... the whole thing.

Very full filling, food coma status.

The sign says please wait to be seated. A couple patrons arrived and waited for a couple minutes and decided to sit themselves. I have made eye contact with a couple waiters and they did not even make any effort to acknowledge my presence! There are several tables of customers but it didn't look hectic at all.

Me, ""This is the best Medit. food I've ever had."" 
Them, ""Oh yeah? We'll be the judge of this.""  
After: Them: ""OMG, this is the best Medit. food we've ever had!!!!""

We went for dinner, eat in. Had the ""salad plate"" which is all of the appy salads - babaganooj, eggplant caviar, hummus, etc... You want to lick the platters clean. Ridiculously good. Enough for 4-5 people to share.

The kabobs have huge hunks of juicy meat, the fries are pretty typical, but bro said the rice was great. The side salad is super yummy. 

Food = awesome.
Prices = CHEAP!! (esp. for the quality and quantity)
Cusomer service = I'd say they haven't nailed it yet. Just figure its a mom-n-pop place, they don't have a ""customer service coach"" to help them polish up the nuances of what makes us all happy to be waited on. 

Go for the food, and just chill re: customer service. They try hard, and that counts.

4478460,2014-04-27,0,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"This is one of the best quality Mediterranean places in Las Vegas.  As a local we have tried everywhere, and this is among the top 5.  The Chicken Kabob is the best in Vegas.  Tender, seasoned and grilled perfectly.  Always cooked to order.  The specialty platters are enormous, so don't order unless you are hungry.  The Greek Salad has a near perfect light and flavorful dressing, the only downside is depending on who is in the kitchen you may get overly large lettuce chunks which makes eating awkward.  It is recommended you ask them to toss your salad for you, it will evenly spread the dressing and Fetta around - completely changes the flavor and quality.

If you like hummus, get the hummus with seasoned beef. Out of this world and simple but flavorful.  

The decor and ambience are the only downsides.  You feel like you are in a covered hotel banquet room, or having dinner at a retirement home. The lighting, background music, and overall space are a 2 out of 5. 

Service is a hit or miss.  A few of the staff there are fantastic, but, they randomly handle tables and so you sometimes may wait to get acknowledged.  However, the food quality if worth the wait.

WARNING:  Ordering to-go is a painful experience unless you tell them you will be there in 15-20 minutes.  I have ordered sometimes, showed up 45 minutes later, and they were still not ready.  If you don't tell them you need it fast, you will wait a while. And walk-in takeout is the worst - just plan on a long wait.",1kRe3uOri0NExKQO57BWHA,0,0,4,7VkPUYICYML_M15315VFeQ

Friends are visiting our great city in order to house hunt (yay!), and we wanted to show them how to eat like a local. We got there first and almost didn't recognize it: it has been redone, modernized, rearranged, and much nicer.

When we were seated, a one-man band was playing a keyboard, starting with several songs that evoked stirring memories of my childhood and my mother. But his music covered a variety of genres, so there was something for everyone. Well, no rap or heavy metal, sorry :) Unfortunately, a while later, a large group seated near him got him to turn the volume up to ear-ringing levels, so much so that my friend and I, seated inches apart next to each other, couldn't even have a conversation. He turned it down about 3/4 of the way through our meal when the group left, but that's my only complaint. I would like management to realize that some people like to talk during dinner; we weren't at a Bar Mitzvah, where you know in advance that you'll go deaf from the music. 

What hasn't changed much is the menu. Oh, the prices have gone up a dollar or two, but that's over a period of several years. It's still a great value for the huge amount of food, and the wine prices are very reasonable, too.

Our server was Peter, and he was wonderful. My friend ordered the sturgeon, something I've never had. Peter said he'd bring her the (very tangy) sauce on the side, saying he loved it but wanted to make sure she'd like it, too. He was extremely attentive throughout the meal. I tasted her fish and thought it was delicious. I'll probably have it next time. Our Kabob Combo dinners, which we ordered with lamb chops that were tender and juicy, were fabulous. There's a choice of the lamb or pork chops. We will enjoy the rest of it tomorrow night!

Lots of Mediterranean restaurants have opened since we first found Shish Kabob House. Many of them are pretty good, but we're happy to have re-discovered this place. Despite the music problem, I'm upping it to 5 stars, because the food, value, and service can't be beat.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,7,5,cW8YSNxOPCFm78Gx5RRvEg

I didn't want to pay top dollar for food that I know I could get at Yassou's for a decent price. My worries were put to rest when I saw the menu  because it looked really casual. It looked like a fast food menu with prices to match! 
I ordered a mix of beef and chicken with rice. When I first saw the rice wasn't yellow I wasn't sure what to think. (I was brought up on yellow Mediterranean rice with plenty of turmeric) The rice was delicious and the meat was tender. I thought. I would like the beef better but they were both equally yummy!

Facility: It was more of a restaurant than I expected.  I thought it would be more fast food type, but it was bigger than I thought. It  has tables and chairs and a stage in the front where they obviously have music events. 

Service:  I hate to do this, but this place is getting 3 stars because of the service. We walked in and they just kinda looked at us. Then they finally said we could pick any seat.  They wait staff were very friendly, but almost rudely inattentive.  Why do I say this? It started with our blonde haired waitress (I did not get her name) flirting with guys at the next table for 15 minutes, while we waited her to come back to take our order.  Then after the appetizers, she disappeared, so we had to flag down other staff. My friend said she was outside talking to those same guys.  At first, I thought she was mistaken, but then I saw her come inside 20 minutes later. Really?!?  
The problem with the rest of the staff, is they weren't walking around checking on the patrons either. 
They all stood at the front of the room, a few folding napkins, but most just standing around talking to each other. I posted a pic of the gathering place. Maybe the management will see this. 
When they finally come around, they are friendly, but getting them to your table is the trick. 

Food:  the food is great here...too bad the service sucks. 
We ordered the following treats:
Egg rolls - I got 3 different kinds. They were potato (2/5), beef (4/5), and cheese (5/5).  They were crispy, fresh and hot. The cheese were amazing!!!
Beef hummus - very good (4/5)
Mixed combo plate - delicious! (5/5) it came with chicken, steak, beef lula, lamb chops, salad, buttery rice, grilled veggies, pita bread, and French fries!  Everything on the plate was good. My fav meat were the lamb chops and my least favorite is the chicken. But the chicken was still good. 
Took most of it home and it will be at least 3-4 meals. Well worth the money!

Overall: I will be back. The food was too good to not come back, but I do wish the would teach the 8+ wait staff to check on their tables. It's so rude to be across the room with empty water glasses and the staff congregating in one corner for social hour. Or completely abandoning your table to go socialize outside.

She is always good about refilling drinks and always knows what to recommend when you don't know what to get. As far as the food goes portions are a good size and cheap.

I don't usually eat pork because I don't like the flavor, but their pork was the best ever cooked to perfection.

My office ordered from here through grubhub which the owners were skeptical about but I assured them I used grubhub all the time and I've never had a bad experience.We ordered over $63 worth of food and waited... and then waited more. After the over one hour mark I called the restaurant (I use this term lightly here) to see what was going on and I was told by the person answering the phone that they were waiting on the grubhub driver and they had at least another 15 mins to grab the food.. Okay, I completely understand but I was concerned about the food because they told me it was already made so I expressed concern if it was going to be hot or not and that our fries now would be soggy. I was put on a brief hold and another person picked up the call and assured me the food would be fine and not to worry.
   Another thirty minutes later the food finally arrived. And wow, we were NOT happy. The chicken kabobs were cold, not hot. The order of chicken fingers we ordered were BURNT, the salads were SOGGY, the fries were SOGGY and the thing that really tipped me off to their poor standards was that the sides of tzatziki sauce were room temperature.
   Knowing exactly when the grub hub driver is going to pick up the food, you would think the restaurant would make your food to order and NOT have it sitting around for who knows how long (at least 30 minutes by my first phone call) and just compromise an entire order. I couldn't even eat my gyro because who knows how sick I would get from eating room temperature yogurt sauce that had been just sitting around. YUK.
    I called the restaurant and the phone was answered by an employee. I told them what happened and was put on a 5 minute hold so they could talk to this places ""owner"". They came back on the line and told me they could give me 20% off my next order. I'm sorry, that's NOT good enough. EVERYTHING in the order was messed up in some way. I'd be trying to convince my bosses to order from here again after THIS kind of experience and that's the option I get? I told the employee this so I was placed on ANOTHER 5 minute hold so they can go talk to this ""owner"". When they finally came back they said well it's only the 20% off and they can send me another chicken finger meal. I told them no, and if I could speak to the owner. After a LOT of hesitation they finally put me on hold and got the owner for me. The owner told me that that's all they were offering and I explained that a 20% discount for ""next time"" would go unused because we wouldn't use it. If they could offer perhaps a comp meal or two for next time I could see us ordering from there again so we could give them another try. He didn't want to hear ANY of this and HUNG UP on me!! Wow, with this kind of service they'll be out of business in no time. Zero consideration for new (and possibly returning) customers and just downright rude.
    I then called grubhub and told them about my experience. The customer service rep who answered was very apologetic and commented of how I always order through grubhub and I've never had an experience like this. She put me on a brief hold and called the ""restaurant"". She returned and said they were going to do nothing for this complete mess up (on their end) and she even tried to compromise with them for half of a refund and other ideas to help the situation. The ""owner"" would have non of it. The rep apologized to me again and there's nothing they could do.

I looked over the menu online before calling in my order. The only thing I found was salads. When I called in I asked if they had a veggie kabob, which they said they did. I settled on that. 

The ""veggie kabob"" was mainly bell peppers and onion. There was one piece of tomato and one hot pepper, a lot of bell pepper, and even more onions. It was served on a bed of rice with a side of Greek salad and pita bread. 

The veggies were good though I wish there were other veggies like mushrooms or eggplant or something more than just bell peppers and onions. The rice and pita bread = carb overload. The Greek salad was good though it was light on dressing so it was a little dry. 

I have had veggie kabobs from other places that were so much better. 

Shish Kabob House earns the ""meh"" 3 star review. It wasn't horrible but I have had much better.",_ZMD-Abvm-DHCmsOF-f8FA,2,0,3,_X7v_Z92hXM5_83lH0Tq3w

I came here with my parents, straying away from our usual places we like to eat on our family outings. The servings were way bigger than we expected but we didn't complain since we came in with empty stomachs. 

We started with some hummus and tabbouleh. The hummus was so good we had to keep asking for more pita bread so we could finish all of it. I never tried tabbouleh before, but it was pleasantly fresh and tasty. 

You MUST get the lamb kabob or lamb chops. It was cooked to perfection, so tender and moist! It came along with a small salad and you get to choose between fries or rice for your other side, definitely go for the rice. It can get a little pricey with hungry people, but it's worth it with the huge serving you get. The only downside was that though our appetizers came out fairly quick, our entrees didn't. My father received his dish first, leaving my mother and I to wait what felt about another 15-20 for our entrees.

The second time, I ordered beef lula(ground beef), and asked to have extra meat and agreed to an extra charge of course. I guess I should have been more inquisitive as they charged me for a full-priced second entree and simply doubled the meat portion on my plate.

The sign is to one side over by the exit door and not directly above the entrance. Because of the decor, I thought we stumbled into some sort of private hall.

It seems my comrades thought their chickens were more on the okay side so I'm drawing to a conclusion that maybe the red meats are the star? My beef kabob and lula kabob were pretty good and lamb is definitely to try next time. The LuLa was nicely seasoned and the beef kabob was tender and juicy. This isn't really ""Mediterranean"" but I guess it's easy to lump it instead of call this Armenian. Salad was good and fresh and added a bit of the ""wetness"" the meal needs, but I still think maybe the meats should come with a sauce. Rice is buttered and they use jasmine rice so it is soft and not dry at all.  The plate had roasted tomato which was yummy to mix into the food and had a roasted pepper which I thought was the usual mild sweet peppers most Mediterranean places give. Beware- its a spicy pepper and I took a big mouthful like an idiot. Delicious in small bites, but not so much in a mouthful...ouchie. 

Next time I'll see if they can do a small dipping cup of their cucumber yogurt. They had it on the back listed in appetizers so I didn't even know they had some sort of yogurt...I think maybe that would be the missing link to marry all the flavors together. 

For the big plate I had and a drink it was around $10 which was a good deal so this would be a good lunch spot for people in the area (like me). I will come back for the LuLa , that was pretty decent. I saw a mention of Chicken Tabaka...wasnt on the lunch so maybe I'll go during dinner to order that- been missing this dish.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,7,4,JbKtfYO2BJqV9IENHjhsAg

We ordered the spinach dip and 3 entrees (pork kebob, chicken kebab and beef kebab, chicken kebab and beef lulu).  

The spinach dip was amazing!  The dip is prepared with labneh (a type of greek yogurt), spinach, garlic, and salt.  We had this as an appetizer with pita bread.  The dip was rich and creamy and honestly so good I wanted to eat it by the spoonful!

The entrees were also super delicious and large in portion.  While all of the meat was nicely seasoned and tender, our favorite was the beef kebab.  It was seasoned to perfection and prepared medium.  The entrees also came with a green salad with an amazing lemon, olive oil dressing, a side of rice and fries, a roasted tomato and a roasted jalapeno.

Great quality food, generous portions, excellent service, reasonable prices-we can't ask for more! (except for opening a restaurant in the LA area)

We will definitely recommend the Shish Kebab house to others and look forward to return visits!",Y-4YxkK37L24LEibi0a4Dg,0,0,5,0Trw-DaJcq6g-CGfztsrUQ

I love their combo plates that come with salad and the roasted tomato and roasted jalapeno and saffron rice and it also comes with grilled skewers of goodness. oh and pita bread which I really don't care for.  What I actually love to do is smash the tomato into the saffron rice and mix it all together before eating it... Yummy! my favorites here are the

beef and chicken (this is my favorite I love that it's filet mignon they use and it's so tender and juicy. the chicken is awesome too I end ordering an extra order of this chicken it's flavor is perfect)

lamb chops me and my wife agree that this Lamb here is one of the best we've eaten they do a perfect job cooking these chops and I usually don't eat lamb but it was really good not gamey at all

chicken tululu this wasn't my favorite thing but it wasn't bad it just tasted like something I've had before.

5227992,2014-05-19,1,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"Decided to stop by Saturday afternoon for a quick lunch.

We walked in, and were welcomed and asked to sit anywhere we'd like.  

Sat down, and waited...and waited...and waited...

Ok, it really wasn't THAT long of a wait, maybe 5 minutes or so, but...the restaurant wasn't busy, and there was a server just standing up at the front of the restaurant doing nothing.  

Our server finally came over and gave us menus, and took our water order.  

We asked the server for a recommendation on the appetizer, and she recommended the smoked salmon.  (After a brief misunderstanding about which two we were deciding on).  

When the salmon came out...it was glistening.  They had absolutely DRENCHED it in olive oil!  Why?  Smoked salmon doesn't need anything on it, its delicious on its own...my bf  and I tried one small piece each, and sent it back.  They sent another one that had far less oil, and tasted much better.

The hummus was ok. I've had better store bought hummus, but I've also had WAY worse.  There was a lot of oil pooling on the outside of the hummus dish here as well, but that doesn't really bother me too much...I've seen and had worse.  I'd have liked to have had just a hint more garlic in this batch of hummus, but it was good enough that my fella ate it, and he's not the biggest fan of hummus.

I ordered the grape leaves, which were very good.  
Although...I asked if they were vegetarian (not that I care, I was just curious, because I've had them both ways) and the server's response was:  ""Oh, yes, vegetarian.  You know, just rice and meat.""  Um...what?  Is there meat or isn't there?  

The redeeming quality, and what is keeping this a 3 star review instead of 2 stars, is the kababs. 

The beef and the chicken kebabs were both tender, juicy, and very flavorful.  
The rice it was served on was overcooked slightly, and the salad that they served with it (once again) had a touch too much oil, but the flavor of the meat was wonderful.

I'd like to try this place again, perhaps it was an off day?  They deliver, and are right around the corner from where I live, so I will definitely go back, or order in.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,3,1,3,P4E54nniVM164Qk8eXgnqg

If memory serves, I got #19. Some plate of awesomeness with beefy goodness and then some pork chop looking things on it (at least in the picture!). The waitress asked if I wanted lamb or pork, and I decided to go with the lamb based on Yelp reviews. The beefy things (kafta kabob + steak) were insanely tasty. Then came the ""lamb"". The sad thing is I'm still confused about whether I ate lamb or pork! I know, ridiculous! So it was pale and whitish like pork, but it had the size and taste of lamb (well sort of!). I've never seen white lamb so I'm uber confused? Neither me nor my carnivorous coworker could figure it out. LOL.

She got a chicken platter thing served with those chicken lula meatballs. She found them disgusting, I found them tolerable. Definitely not something either of us would order again. 

As others have mentioned, the decor is bizarre. You've got these casual tacky laminated menus, you've got decent prices but you're dining in what seems like a hotel ball room. A bit odd!

When we arrived, they were very busy and there were a lot of Armenian people sitting and eating at the restaurant.  It is always a good sign that the food is going to be great when you see people of the same culture/ethnicity eating at a restaurant.  My wife ordered the lamb gyro and I went for the chicken & beef kabob platter.  It took about 30 minutes for the food to be prepared; but, given the plates we saw going to other tables, we were willing to wait.

When our food arrived, it was a lot of food; huge portions.  The chicken and lamb kabob was expertly seasoned and cooked.  My wife loved her gyro.  The rice and salad that comes with the entrees was a perfect complement the entree.

I wish we lived in Las Vegas so we could frequent this place often;but, the best I can do is to encourage and recommend it highly to others.  Oh, and the prices are really good.

Hubby had warned me about the awful service here, but I'm open minded; I like to give every restaurant a chance before I write them off. Besides, I had heard that this place serves some awesome Mediterranean cuisine. With that being said, I'm not exaggerating when I say that we waited 2 HOURS for our food. The worst part is that we never even received it! After being told countless times by our waiter that our food will be done in ""10 minutes"", we eventually came to the conclusion that it was never going to arrive. Like several other smart parties before us, we decided to just get up and leave.

I don't know how the owners think this is acceptable. At some point when tables are leaving one after the other without even being served, they have to realize that some changes need to be made.

Very fancy decor and I believe they have live music instruments as well. I went there after seeing it a while back expecting the same corner food joint, instead we found a chic restaurant that looks like something you'd see on food network with the lack of a proper host and cloth napkin.

The food sucks and let me point out why. With appetizer (Domas), we were given the store bought and cold PITA bread (Notice the caps) with nothing to dip it with and with no butter. Rice with the order of # 7 were the type of rice they serve with Enchiladas. Chicken Kabobs were dry and the beef kabobs were unevenly cook. Some were well done while other were mid-well. Did I mention the paper menu which resembles the pizza menu you get on your door locks. Salad was just ok.

Service was somewhat impressive. Our server was very polite and gave a very professional impression. Halfway between ordering and getting our food, the music stops causing an uncomfortable amount of silence. 5 mins later, it resumed again. I couldn't actually tell where the music was from, didn't sound like Arabic or Persian. Could be Pashto.

In short, if you go for the food, don't expect anything close to Fresh Kabob on Sunset/Eastern where they serves fresh bread and Basmati rice. Pay $14 for plate with 6 pieces of Kabob look-alike Meat, rice you'd find in a Mexican taco shop with store bought pita bread but decor like a fancy restaurant at the strip. This is a classic example of when neighborhood food joints try to become a fancy restaurant and forget what got them a 3 thousand square-feet restaurant, THE FOOD.",3BHWly9idQw2_Ga5rg5Lxg,6,1,1,ItOBfr_VmYzfXMfxkfbHcw

It is downright AMAZING that not only have they stayed in business this long but thrived.  When so many restaurants have come and gone since they opened, SKH has been consistently great for 5+ years and there really aren't any other businesses nearby that contribute to their success.  People come to this rinky dink plaza for their delicious food.  That's it.

I love their huge combo platter that's around $15.  You get salad, rice or fries, and just a mountain of meats.

5641370,2016-04-23,0,Tk7qCou7aYv_Z-K3a7NhhA,"Being krazy about kabobs, I had to compare this place to our favorite kabob spot in town, Zaytoon. Here is the verdict:

Hummus - Zaytoon is superior. Better hummus and they serve freshly baked piping hot bread. At Shishkabob House (SH), you get pita bread from a package, sliced up and warmed. The hummus at SH also was very cold and obviously had been refrigerated for who knows how long.

Rice - I give the nod to Zaytoon for true basmati rice and bigger serving.

Kabobs - Tie. They both are juicy and flavorful. Delicious.

Ambience - while SH is more of a true restaurant, once again I am subjected to incessant music playing at too high a volume. It's bad enough that they play only wimpy Lilith Fair songs one after the other, but then periodically an ad gets played as well. Quite annoying to hear a silly ad for Jack in the Box in the middle of your meal. If you don't mind the half-market apperanace of Zaytoon, then this one is also a tie.

Bottom line: For my dollar, Zaytoon is still #1. No other place beats it in town.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,3,aPlSmwD-ocehFNCll0Yrsg

I find it absolutely ridiculous people on here complain about the menu being laminated and the decor looking like a ""hotel ballroom.""  You have to respect that this is a cultural thing and most family operated Middle Eastern joints look like that. Part of the reason is that they host numerous types of gatherings/celebrations in their restaurants so that is why they have that ""ballroom"" appeal.

Epic Fail! Really sad to be honest with you. I ordered a Lamb & Chicken kabob combo(Custom), roommate ordered the Salman & Shrimp (#9) combo and i ordered a Chicken Tabaka ( #12) for later. Would have been a somewhat reasonable price if there was any flavor. Absolutely no love went into this creation. Not authentic what so ever. 

Rice: Regular white rice, slightly fried making it oily. No seasoning on it at all
Chicken & Lamb Kabob: No flavor and REALLY dry. I ended up feeding it to the dog.
Salmon & Shrimp: Roommate said the salmon was over cooked, no flavor on it whatsoever. 
Chicken Tabaka: Regular roasted chicken lacking  flavor and moister. 

This place could be AMAZING! The Mediterranean has a plethora of spices. Why aren't they being used here?

The rice was a bit more moist than I was accustomed to and didn't have saffron pours over. The iceberg lettuce salad was meh. Everything else tasted great. I'm hoping it did because it was not because I was literally getting hunger pains prior. 

Our waiter was great. Checked up on us often, refilled our water. Brought us multiple hot sauces in little cups, not the containers. Even transferred our leftovers into to go boxes.

The restaurant is much larger than I was expecting. Very nice as well. They have a little stage near the entrance that, so I look forward to checking this place out on the weekends. Their menu is very well-priced. I was impressed with how inexpensive everything is. I ordered a gyro plate and combination kabob platter to-go.

The servers were all really nice and kept checking on me while I waited. 

After about 30-40 minutes, my food was ready, I paid my check and was on my way. When I arrived home, I was surprised to find the huge portions of the food. For about $23 and change I ended up with food enough for three people. The gyro was just ok, but our favorite was the kabob platter. It comes with your choice of 2 pork or lamb chops, some chicken and beef kabobs. It also comes with steak fries, a large side salad and some rice. So much food and so affordable.
