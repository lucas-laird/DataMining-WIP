Smiths generally are much cheaper than others (esp the Albertsons across the road), and in a year of going everyday I can't honestly recall the people other reviewers have complained about.  But lets be honest, it is a supermarket not a service industry, you go there for groceries and Smiths has some of the best prices and sales available in Las Vegas.

In addition this Smiths is in a well to do area (which is why it is surprising it is smaller and does not have as large a variety as others), so a nice bonus if your single is the pool of wealthier better looking healthier people who shop there.

884586,2016-07-18,0,4ZbRwCB9oGibxK21MUZKHA,"The only reason I come here is because this is the only place that stocks my pets' food at a lower price. The deals aren't that amazing, and I have yet to see any perks come from their rewards card. Their customer service doesn't stand out at all either.
What has driven me to write review, however, is the constant presence of children usually waiting to ambush you right in front of the store. You know, I get it, and I appreciate their enthusiasm, but it's dangerous. Obviously, the staff at this store don't see this as a safety concern because I've encountered this issue about every other week for the past year. One time, tiny elementary school kids were running through the parking lot approaching every person they could find, sometimes right in the middle of parking traffic at night. This is a busy shopping center, I would hate for any of these kids to get hurt.
This store really needs to take care of this issue. If not, contact the owners of the lot! The kids don't know what kind of dangerous people are lurking in these neighborhoods and drivers can be distracted at any moment. Fix this please.",c_3m68Ja-IMueDcwruipSQ,1,0,1,Xw1tqmc9AYtV1WsJv5up1g

He asked me if I looked for them in the organic section--I told him no, but I wanted the regular leeks and found none.  I went back yesterday and neither Swiss chard or leeks (none in the organic section or regular section) were there.
Last week I also bought some iceberg lettuce, though it was tough choosing one that didn't have brown gook at the cut end--I mentioned this to the cashier too.  My summertime favorite, peaches, were omitted from my shopping list after buying a bag there which cost me nearly $10.

First of all, Smith's is open 24/7. That's great if I need some late night munchies or commodities such as toilet paper. Second, they have self checkout registers. I feel weird getting checked out by an employee, it seems as if I should be tipping them or something.

If you have a shoppers card, you can save a lot of money on certain items that are discounted. And, if you use your card, you can redeem points towards gas discounts, which really isn't that great because the discount is at Shell stations, which charge a lot more than most gas stations.

I will continue to shop here because it's convenient. The prices aren't that bad either, it's better than Albertsons. I think the prices are better than Vons too.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,9,6,4,dNVbAmQ9t6lx3Dr222E4Ng

As much as I love their deli, during the rush times, they seem understaffed and the wait time for meat and cheese orders can take up to 30 minutes.

This is my first supermarket Yelp review because one thing pushed me across the line tonight.

I went in to get chicken noodle soup from the soup bar. Figured they would have it in stock for dinner time. The soup bar was empty. I asked the deli clerk if they had any soup in back. I was told, ""They pull the soup at 3PM.' What? 3PM? 

I am confused. Are they saying they only serve soup for lunch and pull whatever is left at 3? This would mean they don't offer soup for dinner. No need to go on at this point and I hope somebody from the store sees this post.

At night it's clear that the B team is working and the clientele is a bit hazardous. Road rage and occasional fisticuffs in the parking lot.... and it's best to use the south doors and avoid the street roughs that wait impatiently at the service desk near the north doors to cash their dole checks and get money orders for the rent. 

So, in the early day it's fairly nice, 5 stars. At night it reminds me of the Bronx (and that ain't good), 0 stars. Averages out to a solid 3.",5JY40klkhTY1tapwAL394Q,0,1,3,rLaOM0kqKtEwaKIaoJ6Tpg

The Eastern location feels a little newer or cleaner.  Can't put my finger on why I don't love this location.

The store is clean and fresh for the most part.  One star.

Staff is friendly and helpful.  One star.

The produce is always full and fresh. The butchers are so friendly when we need something from the case. And all the shelves are well stocked. Use your Smith's card for extra savings throughout the store. My only complaint is that sometimes when we have our shopping trips late at night after work, the store smells like raw meat and their meat selection is lacking. I only have this problem at night, but if you go shopping during the day, you're golden. Don't forget to bring your recyclable bags.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,0,2,4,l0pM7246Tdzng19gbG-jTw

Well today, I went in, with full intent to utilize my WIC benefits. I had a couple of extra items, that I purchased separately, but what really stood out about today was my cashier. She was patient and sweet, and went above and beyond her job duties. We had a whole ordeal about the milk not going through the WIC benefits part properly, so I would end up having to pay out of pocket. She took initiative and went ahead and exchanged the milk I had brought up with me out for the proper one, and really did change my entire shopping experience. I mean, she could've just said, oh well, it doesn't scan, you'll just have to pay for it.

I actually had a self-check cashier who was too lazy to push a single button to clear my screen for me, and kept INSISTING that I wait for her to finish her social conversation, while lying to me and claiming she was helping some man that she wasn't talking to... (She was instead gossiping with two other customers/friends of hers.) 

Of course, I get stuck with such incompetence while I've got meat in my car, baking at 110 degrees. Not only did she refuse to do her job, but she refused to page a manager, and then attempted to incite a fight between myself and another customer. After I went and got the manager, I returned to find the woman gossiping about me to another customer who wasn't even involved. 

Spoke with the store director the next day. Explained the situation, was informed that it was not the first time this woman had behaved poorly and not followed procedure... yet she's still working there a month or two later. She also seems to have a penchant for sticking her nose in everyone else's business, because every time I see her, she's gossiping with someone about someone else in the store or about other customers.

I tried holding my breath as I looked for what I needed but the odor was too much. I honestly thought I would puke. I said to my boyfriend who was at the other end of the aisle and told him I can't get what I need cause that dude smells too bad and my boyfriend said ""yeah, I know. I can smell him from here"".

We went to another part of the store to get the other things I on my list but before we went to pay, I decided to look down the aisle to see if the guy was gone and he was. I started walking down the aisle and I could still smell him!!!  His odor lingered in the air! Disgusting!!!

I don't think I'll go back to this store. I'm surprised his manager or coworkers didn't say anything to him about his body odor.

5711046,2018-01-25,14,4ZbRwCB9oGibxK21MUZKHA,"Every week when I need fresh produce and snacks for my meal preps, I prefer Smith's over other competing supermarket company. I never had issues with cleanliness, staff, parking, or the products they advertise. 
This review will be based on my multiple experiences I have encountered with Smith's Clicklist Pickup:

Pros: If you're short on time and already know what you plan to buy, I highly recommend to go with this stress-free system. You shop online, pay what you owe, reserve a pickup time at the Smith's store that does this service, park at their designated stall, and wait for them to load your vehicle with your groceries. Whoever came up with idea I will marry them because this is such a convenience for me and others who are limited on time. I've been timing their service and literally takes no more than 5 minutes. Granted, if all your items are available than you are out of the parking lot in no time. However, the items that may not be available will be substituted for a similar product. If you choose not to make a substitution then that item is off your cart and you don't pay for it. Their customer service is exceptional.

Cons: I do have to say that parking can be a hassle at times. You have incoming and outgoing traffic from the nearby gas station, restaurants, and stores nearby and the Clicklist Parking just so happens to land in front of all that traffic. Luckily, you have a one-hour window to pick up your groceries! 

Tips:
1) Service fee is free for your first 3 orders. On the 4th order, the service fee is $4.95.
2) Have any questions in general? Here is the website URL:
https://www.smithsfoodanddrug.com/topic/clicklist
3) You may use paper coupons but it will add more time to your pickup experience. I recommend using the digital coupons since they are automatically added to your total. Digital coupons can be found under the ""Savings"" tab beneath the Smith's Logo. 
4) Very Important! They do not accept cash, checks. and gift cards. Only debit and credit cards!",Bhc91b8DfAYeceqhHRnqHA,21,17,4,9c586FWOdHq0QfI2YV7MOQ

Do not eff with me and my produce. And by ""eff with my produce"" I mean please respect it like you would a baby and don't smash it with heavy stuff. Every time... no matter how I send my groceries down the conveyer, the teens at this location are guaranteed to put some cans in with your bread and put your coffee on top of your bananas.

Smiths Store is pretty easy to shop at as they are a few of the stores left that have self check out  in the store. I know VONS and Albertsons in my area has taken those lanes out. It is a pain when you only have a few item to check out and wanna go.
plus using the Smith rewards card can help on your gas pending o  your shopping dollars. more you spend of course the better your rewards at the pump will be.
