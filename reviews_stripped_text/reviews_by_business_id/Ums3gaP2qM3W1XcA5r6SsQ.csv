I got home and dug in. Then I was sadly disappointed.  The pork did not have the same flavor. The rice was soggy and not fresh. I didn't finish it.

The gentlemen handed us a bowl of the different types of meat they have to try. We both instantly fell in love with the pulled pork.

Today I was on the south west side of town and decided to eat at their W Warm Springs location and was really disappointed. The vegetables looked old, the cilantro in particular was black & slimy, the top of the guacamole was brown & looked slimy.  The only topping I went with was the cabbage which was fresh & crisp.
I got the same 3 tacos I had gotten at the other location, the Huli huli chicken was basically just salty chicken with no flavor, the fish was flavorless and salty as well, but the kalua pig was pretty good.",rJTlq-Y9SbQtMOm9l_ZvrQ,0,0,1,BW3nuuBfjGde8Smx3VSO3w

Josh the manager is always concerned to make sure guests have a wonderful experience. They have put a few twists on the traditional fare and salsa which keeps it lively and the food is incredible.

423432,2014-07-11,1,Ums3gaP2qM3W1XcA5r6SsQ,"I would probably give this place 3 stars if they weren't so darned friendly!  

Here's what I love about Braddah's:
- The service.  ALWAYS super friendly and accommodating! 
- The seaweed rice.  Very unique (and yummy) flavor.
- Their chicken and pork.  The steak is too sweet for me, but I love their chicken and pork.  Very flavorful and tender.
- The coconut bark.  Man oh man if I didn't think I'd blow up to 400 lbs, I'd be in there buying this stuff every day.  Soooooo good.

Here's where I think Braddah's could use some work:
- The tortillas.  If they made their own tortillas, or even just bought higher-quality tortillas, their tacos and burritos would taste 100% better.  Until they figure this out, I'll only be getting a salad or a bowl.
- The salsas and sauces.  The regular tomato-based salsa is pretty ok, but I haven't been impressed with any of their other salsas or sauces.  Blah.
- Pricing. It's nice that their pricing is simple until you realize you are paying the same price for your little salad as you are for a giant burrito.  And since I really hate their tortillas and will only get a salad or a bowl, I feel pretty jipped.

So there ya go!  Will I go back to Braddah's?  Yes.  Can they make some big improvements?  For sure.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,3,1,4,hPc-A3EA7DEonuSScAMYnw

The place is very clean and the menu is displayed on big screen TVs. The place smelled amazing as you get the infusion of flavors of Hawaiian and Latin foods. 

I had the pork burrito and steak taco and it was phenomenal! The food is prepared in front of you and you choose the ingredients. Much like Cafe Rio assembly line, but Bruddah's is levels beyond. I'm a fan at first bite. The pork was seasoned and cooked perfectly the steak had some sweet and a little bit of heat to it which is a perfect combination! 

All in all I'd give more stars if I could. Excellent customer service and amazing food. If you're for something different with a great atmosphere you have to stop by. 10 for 10.",9uF65w3eet38A7VKQ9xwUw,1,0,5,ts_iimrDY0K7dsb4GNrguQ

This was awesome. The guy in the front asked if it was our first time. He then gave us samples of the meats. It was very tasty. They had some variations with seaweed rice and coco bark for dessert. The meats were very tender and spiced just right. The setup is sort of a Hawaiian Cafe Rio/Chipotle. You can get it in a burrito style or in a bowl. 

Bonus points for free wifi and chill reggae music (""please don't rock my boat, because I don't want my boat to be a rockin""). The owner (I think?) made the rounds to ask everyone how they liked it and if he could do anything for them.

Assembly line is similar to Chipotle except the ingredients you can add were not explained very well. Missed the small type regarding $1.25 extra for sautéed peppers... Got pretty much everything in my bowl and it tasted like an Asian inspired rice bowl. Would probably come back again to try another type of meat.,bmEfgpcrKkHKZk_T9soIjg,0,0,3,4zLHm_knBVcpe4jbyRCGIQ

1032838,2016-01-26,0,Ums3gaP2qM3W1XcA5r6SsQ,"I've been to the Braddah's Island Style near UNLV, and I much prefer the one at Centennial. The restaurant is similar to Chipotle restaurants: you tell the food handler what you'd like in your burrito and they make it for you. It's a very casual place and not busy at all.

I got the Kalua Pig burrito with seaweed rice, pinto beans, lettuce, and cheese. The burrito was well made and the pork was very juicy and flavorful. If you're watching your salt intake, you might want to go easy on the pork because it's deeply marinated. The Braddah's at UNLV was way saltier though, so eating at the Centennial Braddah's was refreshingly good.

The restaurant is Hawaiian themed and has a relaxed atmosphere. The restaurant was clean and well-lit. There's not wait staff so you have to get water yourself, but that's what I expected from a casual restaurant.

If you're deciding on a quick bite to eat for lunch, don't hesitate to stop by Braddah's. I only had 30 minute for lunch and was able to order and finish my meal within that time (including the roundtrip to work).",URb6znpCCVzd1kZvugedwg,1,0,5,3sZgiIW2pxwmDGaC1pUc7g

My BFF happens to live around the corner from here and had been raving about the food.  I love island food and anytime I can get it is always great, when I heard this is a chipotle concept restaurant but that served island protein instead the sound of it instantly caught my curiosity.  

I walked in with a party of nine.  We came around 11:30 am and was greeted by the employees.  We were all asked if we had been there and most of us said no.  the young lady and gentlemen informed us of the concept and gave us samples while doing so.  The Kalua pig and pulehu steak were my top choices.  Both were so flavorful and moist.  I went with the salad bowl with pulehu steak and chose the mild and medu salsas.  They definitely give you huge portions and the prices and reasonable.  We were all so stuffed and couldn't finish all of our food.  Two people could definitely share a bowl.  I will probably do that the next time I go and order a burrito as well.  Those darn burritos looked epic!  By this time a swoon of customers rush through the door and seems they have their rush times like any good eatery. 

If you don't have room to enjoy their coconut bark at their restaurant... Take it home!!! It is so delicious.  I bought an entire pound for my group and we munched on them.  Munching accompanied with moaning and ahhhhs while we enjoyed every single morsel.  Haha!  Trust, get yourself at least a piece to try and enjoy!!",ODqvLJmx8UJHpGoPYsyfpQ,1,1,4,_foEbmq2qg4dcOoctR_FcQ

EVERYTHING was delicious, including the fish...which can be hit or miss with me.  I settled on the tacos and tried one wheat, one flour, and one hard shell.  For meat, I selected chicken and fish (combination).  Not only were the tacos filled to capacity, but each and every one of them were the bomb dot com.  

I was also able to unlock a yelp ""check-in"" offer for a complimentary coconut bark. What is coconut bark, you ask? It's CRACK! Yes, I said it...CRACK.  This delicious treat taste like a combination of a Twix bar and heaven!

Decided not to since I already had a side of their salad dressing (forgot the name). 

The steak itself was a little sweet, something different for a change which I appreciated. And adding that salad dressing made it even sweeter. Not regretting it at all.

Nowadays tho every time I go to Braddahs, I've been more and more disappointed. The biggest letdown is that every single time I've gone recently, they are out of ALL the salsas,   I would have been happy with any salsa even if the other ones are on the sweet side. It's a little dry without salsas but I expect that's just a preference. I don't understand how every single time I go they are out of something that is so integral to the flavor! 

Today I go in and of course they're out of all salsas..boo but OK I'm used to it by now. I order a salad it's smushed into a small plastic container.

LOL. Oh bah...! I know Vegas is considered the ninth island, but no need greet me as if we were actually in Hawaii. Slightly kidding! 
Went here to pick up some early lunch with the sister before I had to work today, and I had a mean craving for some Hawaiian flavors, and I Yelped this place. 
Walking in, we were greeted right away. The entire staff was friendly. The first guy we talked to was all-around friendly, and noticed that I could've been a newbie, so he offered me samples of the meat (steak, Kalua Pig, and Huli Huli Chicken). All good. 
You order your stuff (burrito, tacos, nachos, salad or bowl) the way you want down the line. Anyway, I had the bowl with brown rice and Kalua Pig, and my sister had ordered herself and our dad Kalua Pig and steak burritos. Yup... The meat satisfied my cravings. The bowl looked like a small container, but they loaded it, so now I'm going to devour the rest of that meal for my dinner. The sister was also kind enough to share her burrito 'cause it was huge and loaded, even though she didn't ask for a lot of toppings to go with the rice and meat. 
Did I mention that the guys that were working were nice? Didn't even pressure me for a tip to add to the total when he flipped the register screen. Hahaha... I had to ask if it was okay to add it on since I didn't have cash. If they get busy, no worries 'cause they multi-task pretty good.

Each was equally wonderful and I could not decide.  I was told I could mix and match the three taco deal.  I opted for all three meats in separate tacos.  The only other two choices I made was on deciding which kind of tortilla and rice I wanted.  I chose flour and the seaweed rice.  After that I let the order go as Conner chose all the other ingredients which would complement the meats.  He was spot on with his selections.

4) Your choice of Mango & Roasted Corn, Pineapple Verde, Tomato and Onions or Guacamole
5) Extras to choose from Lettuce, Cheese, Lime, Cilantro, Bean Sprouts or Sour Cream.
They have chips, sauce/vinaigrettes, and also their infamous Coconut Bark.

The two visits here, I've ordered the bowl with Kalua Pig, Brown Rice, Mango and Roasted Corn with lettuce and cheese! I find it so easy to eat right before going to work!

It made the tortilla and everything in the burrito wet and soggy.  Kinda gross.  The chicken was okay, had no flavor but smoke.  I know that they are going for a smoky flavor but it's overpowering.  I think my bites without meat were better.  Everything but the meat drenched in liquid smoke was bland.  We spent over 23 bucks on 2 below average burritos and 4 drinks.

After seeing that Slidin Thru was gone and Braddah's was in its place, we were both immediately intrigued. I got on Yelp and checked out the reviews, and was happy to see that they were amazing. Well, we decided to try the place out for dinner today, and I gotta say...the great reviews are justified. As soon as you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the employees, and they ask if you have ever been there. Since we never had, we obviously said no, and the girl helping us gave us samples of the three meats they offer: pork, chicken and steak. The pork was good but tasted like typical pulled pork...but the chicken and steak were damn good. The chicken has this nice smoky taste to it, and the steak is tender and has a touch of sweetness. We couldn't decide, so the worker told us that you can mix the meats if you would like...how awesome is that?? She also let us sample their different salsas...the green pineapple one and the corn one were both really good, so we mixed those in as well. The rest is pretty much an assembly line setup were you pick what you want. You start out by choosing either a burrito, bowl, salad or tacos. From there you just throw in whatever you want. It was a really great experience and I hope the place sticks around in this location because it is just plain awesome. The customer service was great, the food was delicious (and filling...a bowl is enough for two meals!), and the coconut bark is a great way to wrap up the meal. Nothing better than salty sweet chocolate toffee goodness to end a tasty dinner!",xqw2FqjGHigv6GlKsXueFA,2,2,5,AeR2yG5dOmN4XA-STdcwuA
2011462,2016-05-13,0,Ums3gaP2qM3W1XcA5r6SsQ,I had high hopes from other yelp reviewers but this place missed the mark. First off its a little pricey. Imagine getting3/5 of Chipotle bowl for 9$. The seaweed rice was pretty good but salty. The chicken was wayyyyyy too salty and made the dish nearly inedible. The toppings seemed to be wilted and soggy. If it was priced better I may be open in trying it again. But most likely not. I ordered at the drive thru and the guy helped me out on the ordering process which was nice.

I went thru the drive-thru btw since I had my dog in the car. Anyways today is their 1 year anniversary, for the original location on Rainbow, so they are giving out 2oz of free coconut bark. Damn that stuff is gooooood. 

For my meal, I decided on a pork bowl with seaweed rice, black beans, cabbage, cheese, and then all the salsas and sour cream on the side. When I pulled up to the window, the cashier informs me that the computer stopped working. No problem. I repeat my order back to her. She rings me up, and a few minutes later she's handing me my food in a brown paper bag. I thank her and pull off. As I'm about to turn out of the parking lot, I check my bag. There is the bowl I ordered, but no salsa/sour cream on the side. I check the bowl to see if maybe they had put it on the bowl instead, but it was dry. I pulled back into the drive-thru and told them what happened. They were very apologetic and gave me my stuff on the side. It's not such a big deal, but you would think after repeating the order to her after saying the computer stopped working, she would make extra certain I got everything I ordered. Luckily I hadn't gone far, because I would have been irritated getting all the way home and then finding out some items were missing. 

The food was just ok. I needed to add salt and pepper to the bowl for more flavor. I liked the pineapple and corn salsas, the other one was just tomatoes and onions. I wouldn't even call it salsa.

I appreciate they let you sample the meats beforehand. The steak was tender, the chicken was ok, nothing special, but the kalua pork was dry and greasy. We got one steak burrito and one chicken bowl. All the other components of the meal were very bland. The beans were bland and powdery. The rice was bland and mushy. And brown rice is supposed to have some texture and chew to it. Even the nori hardly had any of the toasty seaweed flavor.

The salsas weren't hot and they hardly put any on it. We asked for all three on our food. Thank god for the salt and pepper shakers on the table to make it edible. I also tried the pineapple jalapeno sauce they had on the table to see if it would help; way too sweet.

For the two of us and one drink set us back $18 something, and then the change for tip, it cost us $20 for what bf said was ""the worst burrito I've had in my life"". For the meats alone, I would have given two stars; meh. But for the price, the portion, and the workers just fooling around and not acting professional (server asking for more rice and one of the cooks told her to get it herself), I can't give this place more than one star.

If you're going to copy Chipotle, you better do it better than them! At least they give you a lot of food, and don't roll their eyes when you ask for more salsa or whatever. And the kicker? Chipotle is right down the street!",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,1,1,NJtJNNpqtGnJXDYGXmGWGw

Braddah's is open inside of the old Slidin' Thru space and is usually farily empty when I've walked in. For those who have never been to Braddah's, it is best described as a Hawaiian style Chipotle where you can create your own burritos, bowls, salads, and tacos with Hawaiian flavors and ingredients.

Customers are always greeted upon entry and they'll always ask you if it's your 1st time here. Say yes and you'll get samples of their most popular proteins including Huli Huli chicken and Kalua pig. Then you will have to decide whether you want a burrito, bowl, salad, or 3 tacos. Once you decide that and pick your protein you get to choose any of the ingredients you want on the line except guac and grilled veggies which are an additional charge. Even their salsas here are Hawaiian themed such as mango & roasted corn, charred pineapple verde, and tomato & grilled maui onion! There are also bottled sauces avaiable if you need an additional kick but I've never tried them.

I usually get a bowl since you seem to be able to pile on more toppings which means more food! I really recommend their coconut bark and chips and guac here as they are pretty darn delicious, but you'll need to share because I can never finish these extras on my own on top of eating my own bowl.

The staff here is always very friendly and they'll come over to check on you during your meal if you're dining in which is an awesome and friendly plus!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,6,5,5,ZMegE6uHpHM8DJXD6GOTog

Overall, it is basically a Chipotle/Zabas/Qdoba/Café Rio/Baja Fresh/etc style place, but with Hawaiian flavors.  Exactly the same.  Pick burrito/bowl/tacos/salad, then go down the line and pick your pork/beef/chicken/fish/veggies and assemble from the various salsas and toppings like guacamole, cheese, etc.  You get the idea.  Nothing new here.  

That being said, the difference is in the flavors.  The meats are all Hawaiian style flavors, like Kalua pig, and the salsas are things like roasted pineapple, which was quite tasty.  They do have 1 difference, which is coconut bark, which is basically a buttery, caramelly, chocolate coconut brick that is quite tasty.  The food was good and the prices were decent, although I had to get a second order because I was not full after the burrito I had.  My wife and I both got burritos and I guess it depends on who makes it, because mine was literally...LITERALLY 2 inches shorter than hers.  My guy was one of those people who seemed like he was about to get tweezers out to pick off a grain of rice because he exceeded the statutorily allowed amount of meat and rice, while hers was made by a guy who felt a little more free about it.  Funny thing is, I get portion control and all, but when you are skimping and it is obvious that you are desperately trying to shave off a strand of excess pork, it makes the customer feel slighted.  Anyway, I suppose if you get a good healthy sized portion, you should do fine with 1 entrée and the price is good.  The food was tasty and the staff were all friendly.  I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but alas, Yelp does not allow half stars, so I round up in this case.

A hilarious aside...I watched a kid fill an empty 96 oz bottle of apple juice from the fountain, which has minute maid apple juice in it.  No one seemed to care.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,1,0,4,jdJAk4u-oA8uumrF_cd5-g

The cool guys working the counter figured we were first timers and had us sample the proteins before ordering. My only gripe was the steak I ordered was slightly overcooked, falling just short of being a truly great protein filling.

The corn salsa was pretty good & my husband chose the tomato one which is their spiciest salsa, I'm not big on spicy. Their ranch was different & I didn't think I would like it so I asked for it on the side but we both ended up enjoying it so we poured it all on top of the salad. So good!

The woman whom served me was scooped less than a quarter of the spoon for my burrito. That really didn't sit well with me. Especially, not to mention, when I went through the drive thru the time before, I paid for guacamole and it never made it in the bowl....or better yet, maybe it did but that is how chincy the portion was--too small to not even taste that it was in there.

People recommend their pork, but I personally love the chopped steak they provide since it was the sweetest with a hint of ginger. You have a choice of a burrito, taco, or bowl to house your food. They struck up conversation as they prepared my food (it works like Cafe Rio or Chipotle) and were very easy to talk to. After all the social atmosphere seemed to please, the real test was now to taste the prepared meal which I already knew was going to be good since I tried the meat beforehand. In short, The burrito ensemble was delicious! If you want something to drink, they have Coke products and a wonderful pellet ice machine that we all love.

It was my first time here, so one of the guys who worked there gave me a sample of each meat: Kahlua pig, chicken, and steak.  The kahlua pig was a bit salty (but most kahlua pig I've tried are a bit salty), so I decided to go half and half with the chicken and steak bowl.  

I'm trying to remember all the toppings I picked because I probably picked about 90% of what they had. You have your choice of mild, med, or hot sauce.  I got my mild sauce (which is green and includes pineapples) and the hot sauce/salsa was good.  They were very generous with the guac.  

Also got some sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and tortilla strips.  I'm sure I got more toppings, but that's all I can remember.  

The only downside was the utensils - they seemed dirty.  Not sure if it was the water spots or what, but they didn't seem clean.  

I used a Groupon deal: $7.50 for $12 worth of food.  This typically gives you a bowl with a drink.  I'm wondering if I was charged extra for the guac.

I had the fish tacos and my husband had a steak bowl. The food had a nice fresh taste about it. It felt like we were eating really healthy and clean. The fish was good. I would definitely order it again. My husband's steak left a lot to be desired.

I have heard the coconut bark is amazing, and I would go back to try it, however my husband's words when leaving were that he would choose Zaba's, Cafe Rio or Chipotle over that any day. It was just ""ok."" Sadly, not as good as the Instagram pics make it look.

Last time I set foot in this place was when Ric Guerrero was opening up Slidin' Thru Northwest. Braddah's has taken over with their ""Hawaiian Style Chipotle"" concept.
The first time I tried Braddah's on Rainbow, I got a loaded burrito with Huli-Huli and Pulehu Steak, but the flavors of the meat got lost in all the toppings and the tortilla lost its chewiness and got solid real quick.

This time I was gonna get a bowl....no tortilla, minimal toppings and Huli-Huli Chicken. 
I kept it simple...Huli-Huli, Brown Rice, and Corn. What really bummed me out this time was the tiny size of the TRAY, not a BOWL that Braddah's uses, and the Keiki(kid) portion sizes given. Chicken tasted like Chipotle, but smaller pieces, not Huli-Huli Chicken. and my already small container was only two thirds full! I was already regretting not going to the other places who do sell bowls at similar prices around the area(Chipotle, Zaba's, T-Mad, etc.) and their bowls do fill me up for the same price or a tad bit more.

Yeah, the bark is bomb, but something that's easily duplicated at home. If you're coming in for a meal, I would suggest dining in, they probably give you more. ALOHA!!!

Last week sometime, I called and inquired about catering. It was during lunchtime, so they were understandably busy- the phone got set on the counter for 5 minutes as I listened to people take their orders before I hung up. So I called again the next day around 4 pm. They said the manager wasn't there, but took my name and number, and told me that he would call me back. He never did. The next day I called again, and was told that the manager would be there in an hour and would call me back. No call. I called again the next day, and they said that the manager was bringing in food and would be available in just a few minutes. I was put on hold, and I hung up after ten minutes. I called right back, and they said they would have him call me when he was done. Again, no call. I called them again yesterday around 4, supposedly not a busy mealtime, but the manager was busy taking an order. No one could have taken over taking the order for him so he could answer the phone, he had to finish what he was doing. I was put on hold and hung up after two minutes. I called back, an was told that he would give me a call back right away. I waited. 1 minute, 5 minutes, 20 minutes went by, so I decided to move on with my busy schedule and forget about them.

I still haven't received a call back.

Quick Review
+   Dollar tacos on Tuesdays: this past Tuesday was Kalua pig (Christmas came early!); however, I am not certain if it is the same every week or will remain the same in the future. These aren't skimped tacos for the promotion offer: they are loaded with enough food to keep one full for days if one orders a bunch.

+/- This is nitpicking: there is no way to directly enter the strip mall heading south on Durango Drive. A U-turn must be successfully completed.

A taste of Hawai'i at a fraction of the cost of a direct flight to Honolulu from Las Vegas + accommodations + rental vehicle + eating out once there. 

-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------

Personally, I wouldn't compare this to Chipotle® because Chipotle fucking sucks. No one patronised Chiptole with the intentions to remind themselves of a taste of Mejico. I patronise Braddah's because I lived on the island for five years and this is closer than what I am going to get anywhere else. And, it is much better than the Chipotle chain. 

Pro Tip: Taco Tuesday. 

Pro Tip: My favourites rank in order of precedence: chicken, pork, fish. 

Pro Tip: They have local magazines such as Las Vegas Weekly (http://www.yelp.com/biz/las-vegas-weekly-henderson) and Sunday (http://thesunday.com/) here.

There is a drive-thru.

This is where Sliding Thru was previously anchored yet they didn't make it. Here's to hoping that this is not a cursed location and Braddah's can make it in the extreme NW with continued support from the locals. No tourists here.

The manager let us try all the meats and did his best to try and make it a pleasant experience but you could tell his workers were either new or lacking serious motivation. Too many choices to make, confusing signs (basically read the menu from right to left), and nothing to write home about. We may or may not be back.

I do like me some Braddah's Island Style food, my biggest complaint was that it was a bit far from where I live.  No worries any longer with their newer 2nd location!  This one is less than 10 minutes from home!  Can get that Hawaiian-Mexican fusion food whenever the craving strikes!

Thankfully this location is pretty consistent with the original restaurant.  Menu is all there and still intact with all the same dining options.  Tacos, bowls, burritos, it's all there.  This location is roughly the same size as the other one, and the décor is very similar as well.  You got the local Hawaii, easy-breezy feel.  

The Hawaiian 'Chipotle' theme reigns as well.  You pick all of it - meats, rice, beans, salsas, toppings.  I like it, food my way.  

I stayed with my tried and true of all these make-your-own-Mexican places.  Burrito on whole wheat tortilla with chicken (Huli-Huli in this case), seaweed rice, black beans, little bit of the pinapple verde salsa, little bit of the tomato w/ Maui Onion salsa, sour cream, cheese, and extra lettuce.  Yep, that sucker is ginormous!  Good enough for a hungry local boy.

Burrito is still in excellent taste.  Love the sweetness from the Huli-Huli chicken and pineapple verde salsa, the char from the Maui Onion salsa, and the crunch from the lettuce.  So tasty!

Only gripe?  Bring back that damn addicting Pickapeppa sauce from Jamaica!  It made your burritos KILLER!  Sweet, tart, tangy, kick of heat...it was my favorite!  Your house made hot sauces are OK Braddah's but it doesn't compare to that stuff from Jamaica, mon.  In any case, at least add some Tapatio or Tabasco (Jalapeno or Chipotle flavor) to the hot sauce stable.

Don't even get me started on coconut bark.  I don't always get it because that stuff is a bit like crack.  Hard to resist after you first try!  Not much of a sweets guy but I like the stuff Braddah's puts in these little paper bags.  Almost like a drug trade of sorts, ha ha ha.

Braddah's...not bad brah, keep up the good work.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,1,4,SQUqDHljtgE42faX8ZLYzg

Before I knew it I was a semi-regular.  Now I am a true fan through and through.  I like coming here for a good burrito.  Its a nice alternative to the over crowded Chipotle restaurants and has a different take on the whole burrito thing.  A burrito with Hawaiian flavors.  I'll take it.  

My usual order is a burrito with huli huli chicken, seaweed rice, black beans, any combination of salsa with their 1, 2, and 3 toe-curl spice ratings, sour cream and cheese.  It is a tasty treat that I can get even in the drive-thru.  Safety warning, don't try to eat this on the road.  If you are a drive-thru explorer, wait until you get home.  The burritos can lean towards the large side and get messy as a result.

If you are so inclined, get adventureous with your burrito.  Don't be shy.  Ask for a half and half burrito with huli huli chicken and kalua pig.  The two together are so ono.  I get that every so often just to mix things up.  

In closing, try the cocount bark.  I'm not a big fan of coconut but this stuff is just awesome.  Sweet and chocolatey with a little toasted coconut added in.

Is what critics are saying. Or, maybe that just my taste buds. Either way, Braddah's Island Style is an absolutely amazing place. The second you walk in the door you are greeted by everyone working with a boisterous 'Aloha!'. Then, the samples. They let you sample the three types of meat they have. Pork, which has a little kick at the end. Steak, which is surprisingly juicy with a hint of sweetness. And, chicken, which is very hearty and tangy with just the right amount of spices.

My friend and I both opted for the steak. He got a bowl, I got three tacos with all the fixins. Also, try some of their house made sauces mango, pineapple habanero, raspberry gave jalepeno, or kiwi lime jalepeno. All are great! When you check in you can redeem an offer for free bark as well. Also, be sure to try one of the canned Hawaiian sun drinks, green tea lychee. Best drink ever. Will definitely be coming back!",1sghNitdObSPFhxqS5Othg,5,4,5,1OhlItZ2c13NyoiRTwKpOw

So far out of the 3 times, everything was seasoned.  I've felt items lacked flavor at the other location as they were very shy with the salt. I'm usually moderate with salt so if I think it's bland, it means its not being seasoned at all.. 

I come for the kalua pig as that's the best meat option they have. It's tender and nice light smokiness to it. I've had the chicken and that was pretty standard grilled chicken and the steak has a soy, sugar and almost cinnamon flavor to it. I havent tried the fish option yet. I dont really like going vegetarian here as I think a lot of the flavor comes from the great kalua pig so I only go meatless at other similar spots. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample of the meats.

I like that they have crunchy items like bean sprouts and cabbage to offer aside from standard lettuce as I like that much better.  

The only thing I wish is that they had a spicy salsa. The diced onion tomato salsa is supposed to be spicy but hasn't been. They do offer sliced jalapeno and habaneros though, but it's not the same as a sauce to fold into everything. I love my stuff spicy so I would pour on all three! 

They're always really friendly here and fast with service. My only other critique is that they close a bit early, it says on their site they are closed at 9pm.

( B ) urritos or bowls. You can also get tacos or salad 

( R ) ice - Brown rice or seaweed rice. Which is brown rice too. 

( A ) nimal -  ! Choose yours. Huli Huli Chicken ( my fav ) Pulehu Steak , Kalua Pig , or Fish !  

( D ) ress -  your item of choice with your toppings black beans , sautéed veggies , habanero ( chopped ) , mango corn salsa , pineapple salsa verde , pico ( couldn't get the flavor down on it ) Sour cream , chopped cabbage , lettuce , Guac. Guac was great ! 

( D ) ecadent - Coconut bark. Unfortunately we were in a rush to leave after our meal and I completely forgot about it :/ will definitely try next time :) 

( A ) gave - agave raspberry and jalapeño sauce or Kiwi lime and jalapeño sauce. Both are lacking heat from the jalapeño. I did enjoy smothering my half of a burrito in the agave sauce. The sweet sauce goes well with the flavor of the chicken. 

( H ) ealthy - u can chose wheat tortillas for tacos or burritos. All rice is brown rice and with fresh ingredients this place is definitely a healthier option. Just go with less cheese , skip sour cream and bulk up with protein from beans and meat ! 

( S ) how your toes ! wear flip flops and post it on their Facebook page and get free chips and Guacamole ! 

Great first time experience staff was friendly and helpful in letting us taste the meats to decide which one we wanted. I felt like the chicken was my fav , then Kalua pork then fish and lastly the steak. The steak had a off putting taste I didn't enjoy. The chicken was delicious. Did not taste exactly like Huli Huli chicken from Hawaii as they roast the whole chickens open fire for a while and baste it with that yummy Huli Huli sauce , but it was still yummy !   

We ordered a Burrito , a bowl and tacos. Burrito is the best option. All of the flavors combine and you can eat it easily. My boyfriends portion on his bowl was a bit small IMO. Tacos were hard to add sauce and such because you could barely open the shell to add anything else after its assembled without the shell cracking. They were delicious though do not get me wrong. The burrito was my just my personal favorite of the three. 

Just don't leave without trying the coconut bark. We were both still hungry after his bowl and my tacos. I went back to order a burrito for us to share and it completely slipped my mind to order some bark. They should display it somewhere for people like me who forget things easily ;).

Before I forget...the coconut bark is certainly a MUST BUY. It is definitely 5 stars for the treat.

Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to love the food (the ones we tried), I didn't one bit. I felt so ripped off. I ordered the fish tacos with the mango and corn, skipped on beans, then chose cilantro, cabbage, and lime, to be thrown in there. It was already looking dry from the moment the young lady placed the ""grilled fish"" that honestly tasted like the cheapest white fish out there! Swai perhaps? Not only that...the fish was pretty dry. There was no essence of it being grilled. 

I then requested if I could get their ranch dressing because I knew this taco was going to need some juice...even with the lime. She said sure. 

My husband is more of the food adventurer so I came in to pick some food up to bring to him for his lunch. I ordered him what seemed like an exciting burrito. It was the pulehu steak burrito with the tomato maui onions (which is their spiciest), black beans, sour cream, lettuce, cilantro, jalapenos, and cheese. 

We were so excited to dig into our lunch! Who wouldnt?! It just fell completely short. Even my husband, the food lover, who would be happy with Vienna sausage and rice...was disappointed. It completely lacked something that he wasn't sure what it needed or not needed. So the ranch I requested comes.on the side...the girl forgot to put it into my bag!  Which annoyed me. But I can't completely fault her as I should've ENSURED I had it in my bag. 

For that day, the price, quality, and vibe...really sucked. Some guy who looked like he was either the owner or manager looked flustered, agitated, something? 

I'll be honest, this is a super late post. We went in some months after they first opened so maybe the stress of getting the business settled was in effect. Since then, I've had no desire to come back. The customer service lacked, and so did the food. HOWEVER, it has been some time now and I certainly am open to second chances. Perhaps twas a bad morning for someone. Whenever I decide to take a chance on my money without having to go to the casino...I'll give it a try. Why not, right? That coconut bark though.

 Bruddah's has a nice simple format of -what do you want, what do you want on it. In short, you can get anything in front of you, just figure out if you want it on rice- bowl! On lettuce- salad! Wrapped in a tortilla- burrito! Stuffed in a shell- taco! 
Done and done. 
 Once you've figured out HOW you want your food packaged, decide on the meat. Steak, pork, fish, chicken or grilled veggies. 
Beyond that just pile on what you want- beans, rice, cabbage, lettuce, sour cream. 
 I was tempted by seaweed rice, but opted for salad option, piling on kalua pork, black beans, jalapeños, habaneros, guacamole (a bit extra) sour cream and spicy salsa. I was born in a year of a Dragon, I needed my fire breather recharged and my salad was nice and spicy, though I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. 
 Family got burritos and bowls with, again, kalua pig and chicken. They raved about chicken and while I tried it, I will say- if sodium is not your thing, steer clear. It was tasty, but WAY salty for me, glad I went with milder pork option. 
 Yes, everyone compares it to chipotle, yes I can see why. It's a tasty option on a random night you don't feel like cooking, and not in macaroni salad loco moco sort of way.
 I will say my family HAD to try the bark and got 1/4 lb. I don't eat sweets, so I'll just say they weren't nearly as impressed as 100% of Yelp reviewers. They said it was ""different"". Not sure what it means, but there you have it.

In all honesty, I can't help but compare their pork salad ($7.50) to Cafe Rio's pork salad ($8.99) - and frankly, Cafe Rio kills them. The salads here make me feel like I'm eating taco toppings as a make shift salad. The lettuce is julienned, and the toppings include rice, beans, sour cream, shredded cheese, salsa and your choice of meat. The pork is watery and needs a sweet element to enhance the flavor. I never get rice or beans (or tortilla at CR) in my salads at either place. At Cafe Rio I have leftovers, here, I leave still hungry.

I tried their bottled habanero sauce and it tastes like nothing. I guess my problem with this place is that it's bland and the portions are small for the price / compared to their competition.

Chips and a small guacamole, maybe 2-3 oz worth is in $4.99. Two small salads, 1 guacamole with chips and two waters is $20+ which I feel is too pricey for a fast casual meal that doesn't leave you satisfied.

While their bark ($4.99 for 1/4 lb) is tasty, it's not something that would make me choose to eat here over any other restaurant around this area.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,2,3,ZQ2ha61id9uoWzU3uQEOFw

The manager at the Durango location is a great individual who obviously takes great pride in their food.  This is a definite new favorite location for us.",iSFnLrF8vHZW_bkfwKFBCw,0,2,5,gSgPD4UlYAtf8LCFT4zPBQ

First, the wait in the drive through was ridiculously long and there was only one car in front of me. No one behind me. I ordered steak tacos and my husband got a steak burrito. The steak was very sweet. My tacos crumbled as I picked them up. My husband's burrito was tiny compared to the ones you get at Chipotle or zabas and all the guacamole was all at one end and all the steak was all at the bottom. I also ordered a side of chips and guacamole which had absolutely no seasoning. The girl in the window gave me free pumpkin bark because of how long we waited and that was pretty good so I'll give two stars for the bark and for her trying to make up for the wait. I'd pick Chipotle over this any time.",OVEEHmbdl_B0Zo9kttbLfA,1,1,2,lFQ8SnqUYCe7XAkyeOoZvQ

We were asked if we've been here before and upon saying no they gave us a bowl to sample each of their meats! Awesomess!!! The flavor was perfectly seasoned, tender and taste just like chopped up version of the real deal! I really could not decide between chicken or steak! So I got both :) This is the ultimate Hawaii version of Chipotle!! Everyone knows how much I love Chipotle !  I honestly would take Braddah's over Chipotle anyday!  PS it's a must to try the Coconut Bark! If you're completely full because of the huge portions they give ... To-go!!!",YeZrkKeJHb2KtdvYdJ8AIQ,0,0,5,hlB_GILzRdx5-CfDntslPw
