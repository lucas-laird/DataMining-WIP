They both apologized to me for running out of white bread as they were really busy earlier. They did tell me they just made some but were too hot to serve. So i opted for wheat bread instead...no biggie. Victoria then advised me they just ran out of tuna and offered to make a fresh batch if I didnt mind waiting. Again, no biggie (she was nice enough to offer to make fresh tuna vs forcing me to choose another option...Thank You Victoria! Much appreciated :) )...I was thankful because I really wanted tuna! While I was waiting Eric was nice enough to tell me about their breakfast menu and delivery using GrubHub. After Victoria whipped up my sandwhich, Eric suggested to try honeymustard on my sandwich and boy oh boy! It was even more yummy! Thank you Victoria and Eric for going above and beyond! Subway is lucky to have you both :)",4ojwa7X1fWPGNOrtqXfZcw,0,0,5,zixVeIqwzMCUlDMFEcRNHg

Unfortunately, when I ate my sandwich it was horrible! I think it was the bread that was the main problem, it just kinda fell apart and was super crumbly.",jnTNXzepydN2iegBJtuTqg,0,0,2,cuR4v0ZGAfNEm5LebPsziA

Okay, I'm not really a picky eater, but I do know what I order.
When I arrived, I was the only customer and an employee named Christopher was baking the breads. After he cleaned up a little, he came to me and asked what I wanted. I noticed he was wearing the same pair of gloves he was using when baking. I asked for my usual Italian bmt on wheat with provolone cheese. He only put 2 of the 3 meat that is usual on my sandwich. Before he put on the cheese, he stopped to bake the breads he was working on prior from my arrival. Twisting knobs, opening doors and cabinets WITH THE SAME GLOVES then continued on to my sandwich. I asked for it to be toasted and it came out burnt (I didn't notice till I got home). When it came to the veggies, same thing; sandwich, then twisting knobs, open doors, open cabinets, back to my sandwich WITH THE SAME GLOVES!! For condiments, honey mustard and mayo that's it. He had a hard time finding the condiments because the mayo was in the honey mustard container and he had to guess where the honey mustard is by guessing it's color. When checking out, I paid in cash. Counting my change, handing me my receipt, SAME DAMN GLOVES!! HE NEVER ONCE CHANGED HIS GLOVES NOR EVEN WASHED HIS HANDS PRIOR MY ORDER!!

Got home, opened up my wrappings and my sandwich was upside down (no big deal kinda but still upsetting) bread is burnt to where my teeth was hurting for the first half, and it was a mess!! Like unwrapping a salad!!
I felt so unsatisfied. If I wasn't so hungry, I would've just left and gone to another subway. Wouldn't recommend this place even to my enemies.
I'm not a picky eater. But I do still want a good sandwich. Smh first and last time coming here.",adJMoI3num6EVv9h0VOb_A,0,0,1,If6Z_SQdJ2wYO5sDivca-g
1964989,2011-01-13,2,8w2Mzdz-JKy3qOpndK1Wqw,"Well, it's Subway. I came here because I had to do laundry next door and the Filipino Buffet further down the stripmall wasn't looking so hot either.

I got the Cold Cut Combo and it was as good as a Subway sub gets. Bread was soft, meat was pre-packaged and the mustard wasn't watery. 

What more can you ask for?",IhmBr-yHC8xLjdnoq7O37w,0,0,2,5YaXNLOGAJC5UxDzMwC77w

However today I ordered a Ice Tea & Lemonade that is brewed behind the register. As I was drinking I realized it was old and has been sitting. I brought it to the attention of an employee Shawntae she apologized and offered me a new drink and said she would check on it, the manager interjected and said ""Oh yea its old"" Why would you admit that and why as THE MANAGER would you KNOWINGLY let OLD TEA SIT OUT?!

Nestled in an odd plaza containing coin launders, along with an eclectuc mix of oddities such as shoes for under $5, and a furniture store housing who knows what. (IKEA eat your heart out!)
