136073,2007-03-28,0,TgbzzpwFaTIXNgwwI1ih1w,If you like raw oysters that are not small and have great flavoring and meat on them... This is the place... Order Louisiana Oysters and be prepared not to share... LOL... They have big flat screens to catch the game or great creole food to have lunch.. Don't forget to ask for the flat bread...amazing,DCSe39OVjUfz6Bn28xjnPQ,1,1,5,SmzcOw2ON4o1tjxs6fQygQ

4693750,2008-10-09,0,TgbzzpwFaTIXNgwwI1ih1w,"We had dinner at Tides Oyster Bar using a 2/1 coupon from a locals mailer.  Tides is a spacious restaurant offering both table and, the more traditional, counter seating.  Ms. Westie ordered a cup of New England clam chowdah (we are from CT and know how to pronounce chowder) and a seafood Cobb salad (micro greens, tomatoes, crab, avocado, carrots, shrimp and blue cheese).  My entr√©e was a super sized piece of parmesan crusted red snapper over an almost spicy tomato sauce.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,0,0,4,cmOxuMg41OBP7Xb0BNpZxw

Our waiter was AMAZING! My co-worker wanted a bottle of wine they didn't have at Tides, so our waiter went to the restaurant next door and borrowed a bottle. He offered to bring us a sample of the House Touffe which we ordered afterward because it was delicious and gave us a spoon full of sour cream that didn't come with the dish. He totally went above and beyond our expectations and left him with a generous tip. 

I ordered the Lobster Roll which satisfied me and came with fries and cole slaw. I ate the whole thing and it wasn't a small portion either. The portions at Tides are humongous and the pastas would definitely make a grown ass man stuffed to the bone. The oyster platter comes with 4 varieties and a great choice. I'd most def come back for more.",PLdNNcecADe4Mt9V9d9J4g,0,0,4,DCPGHroFhmc6tJELZMfAIA

The thing is, I love oysters so I'm always looking for the best oysters in town.  I didn't like their oysters too much.  There seemed to be a very bad after taste to it.  My taste buds weren't too impressed.  For the price to pay, I wouldn't go back unless it's the last place where you can sit down and be served.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,0,0,3,CleHG3yIZXUD_MRxLwDuNw

The flat bread is good as well. I had some jambalaya that was delicious. The bartender was very accomodating and made sure our beers were full along with waters. He even let me use his cellphone to check my VM. 

A little on the pricey side but well worth it in my opinion. Good place to catch a game as there are tv's everywhere. 

I left here stuffed and satisfied.

Beware as Red Rock is about 45 minutes away from the strip and even worse during rush hour so expect a lot of red lights.",56fP-02ya5JdCcL--IpifA,0,0,5,fzNt-Jk751K_lHlyp-HLlw
