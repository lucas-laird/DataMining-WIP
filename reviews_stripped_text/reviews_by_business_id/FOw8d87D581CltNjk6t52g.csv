They have limited food options, drinks, refrigerated sandwiches, salads, parfaits, etc. We had coffee and egg & cheese croissant. The croissant was warm & crunchy; with a good portion of eggs stuffed in between. A decent place to grab a quick bite, if you don't have time to wait in the restaurant.",nx7hGb1sjJFtmdNh5RHYQg,2,0,3,Sm34Rf8AtKLra-gC-Xsf5g

Overall the pastries are.  Cinnamon roll was a little dry, but the apple danish was flakey.  The staff is very courteous and they are open from 6 AM - 1 AM daily.",1CFYzyco4gN6_6-8zxlAUQ,1,0,3,7cUAqQIgn36g-G_IDQGZfQ

So, you walk in, take forever to find the diner, only to find that it has three computers in the corner that you can pay by the minute to use.  Dang it!  Why did the sign lie?",XDnlriVXnZgFYXHqphBJ3g,1,0,1,vX3T9A485PiRO72ojihxSQ

When they made my iced coffee I watched them pour hot coffee into ice then dump some out and add more ice, are you serious! It tasted like water. Way too over priced for basic food that's still terrible.",RXUqZsI2kofYu-hkyQ8y2Q,0,0,1,obhorzctD4FTypE2qIo3RQ

We are not  the biggest fans of their other items that we tried (the shakes taste like they've been made from powdered milk and the cakes were a little dry).  However, if you're looking for a great hot dog before 10:00 pm (they should really stay open later), this is the place to go (although it is a little hard to find - it's way in the back).",uIphx0p-TnndNXX7i5EUVA,1,0,4,BG_9lpzeLiBNPxDRb83lSQ

The coffee I wanted to return, but we were in a hurry to get to the Rio so I kept it. Won't be coming back.",HLY9oDcVBH9D25lU4X_V5Q,0,0,2,mH83hmq_a3f3Ci6tS_NLEQ

2 adults 

Atmosphere - 3 stars
Food - 3 stars
Service - 4 stars

Background - Just looking for a quick bite for breakfast.

Atmosphere - The place needs the face lift like the rest to the Imperial Palace being changed into the Quad.   

Food
  Appetizer - None.

  My Main Course - I went with the six dollar yogurt parfait.  The yogurt had about five slices of strawberry fanned out on top.  They give you a bag of granola that you can add yourself.  The bag looks like it came right out of one of those little cereal boxes. 

  Dessert - Umm No.

Service - Just there.  

Future - I hope not.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,0,0,3,o1765TeeTLH4hhodba1qHQ

On a side note though, the lady who served me my ice cream last night did an awesome job of scooping! I mean.... yes it is over priced, but my one scoop looked closer to 3-4 instead.",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,1,1,3,2Z-IoMc-6nS1a5t2GkVwWQ
