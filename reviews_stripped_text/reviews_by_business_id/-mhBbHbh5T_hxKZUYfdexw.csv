Their food  is awesome though!  trust me, their sisig is way better than Cafe Moda's. Their Kare Kare is good too. I didn't see any cabbage or unnecessary ingredients in it. Their breakfast plates are served all day and they are good and affordable as well. They also serve Italian, Mexican, and American foods. They have Mahalo Fridays which is a Hawaiian theme but with awesome new dance music. All in all this place is not bad.",q5oVhxWdO3B-DS-BkwppVA,2,0,5,J058YrlznOM5IuMdgD3O-g

Along with the hot off the pot dishes, the ""family feel"" service, and the decent prices you pay for such a large amount of food, you really can't go wrong! Also this place is run by a Filipino couple, so if you have your parents, grandparents, aunts or uncles to bring, this place is the place they will sure to enjoy! Can't wait to go back! 

Food tip: Try their sisig and sinigang! The best!",fi12aPSCQIRsehHqrz_QGA,0,0,5,-Lw0DucczGFrJp0s9NVLPA
