The food here is always fresh and delicious.  The gyro meat is tender and flavorful, the hummus is creamy, and the pita is always fresh and hot. They have good tabbouleh and salads.

We started with the Saganaki appetizer, which was served with warm pita bread and was absolutely amazing! All of the food came out in a timely fashion.  My husband and I both ordered the steak kabobs which came with basmati rice, a Greek salad and a side of pita bread with hummus. The meat was lacking in flavor for me, but my husband said his was fantastic so maybe I just got a batch that hadn't marinated long enough. We ended with a rice pudding for dessert which was pretty mushy and definitely not the best that I've had.

Overall the service was wonderful and the food was good. I will definitely go back to try other things on their menu. The saganaki itself is worth returning for.",aEzoGdyimyKfMjL91UAoaQ,1,0,4,tvxH2a1vQ1xc2tW-hwaD2Q
121388,2012-10-16,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"This food helps me so much with my new Mediterranean kick. They fill the holes where needed. 

I am a plain jane, plain and simple kind of guy. So I will begin saying that their lunch specials ROCK! A Chicken Gyro or the Pomegranate Chicken salad is not only considered a healthy lunch but a tasty lunch as well. There are a couple items as well that are under their lunch specials and they're only 7.50. 

Aside from the lunch specials there is a HUGE selection of Mediterranean favorites to choose from which I have yet to begin to explore but will because I am already sold on their food, product, atmosphere and service.

If I had an award for Champion of Local Small Business, Market Grille Cafe would be it. In both restaurants you will find televisions playing video of the Market Grille family and it really makes you respect the place for being a family business. In Las Vegas, a family business and even a restaurant being a family business is a hard thing to come by because barely any succeed. I remember as a teen eating at their first location off of Tropical Parkway and Centennial. They expanded and opened up a second location off of Lake Mead and Rock Springs. Next thing I know they relocated their original store to an old abandoned Chili's building off of Durango between Elkhorn and Deer Springs. I really hope these guys are doing good and hope they're having resulted success with business volume.

The only thing I could recommend to these guys is keeping everything the same. Distinguishing between both locations they do a very good job at that. However, the Centennial restaurant offers table service. There are servers, they serve on you and I would consider it a casual style dining. At the Lake Mead restaurant, you fill up your own drinks, pick your own table and the only thing delivered to you is your food and your silverware. BOTH ARE FINE, I AM IN THE INDUSTRY AND TIP REGARDLESS! But I think it would be more successful for Market Grille to pick a method of service and stick to it as opposed to it being differentiated between both restaurants. There are penny pinchers that could be scared away from this location because they are accustomed to the style of service they receive at the Lake Mead and Rock Springs location.

They're friendly, the product is fresh and some could see it as a little pricy. Deal with it, because you get what you pay for. The service is awesome, the food is consistent and their PUMPKIN BAKLAVA CHEESECAKE is amazing. 

Keep strong Market Grille, I'll see you soon!",D6zI9HS6F7BldafPnJ5amQ,1,0,4,UaBCvVjwAKX-B23fFh_Hlw

Talk about bang for your buck!  

The original lamb gyro is my second favorite thing to order here.

Market Grille now has a waitstaff, which I am kind of disappointed in.  I felt the old system of ordering at the register, taking a number, and getting your own drink worked just fine.

The only dis-like's I have about the Market Grille are the following: the price they charge to add meat to a salad and also how they recently stopped offering a discount for LVAC members.,aKHRHlG-MQVImPAEak8qiQ,0,0,4,u_G6cI71ROBHNBiAIltmxA
303411,2011-06-15,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I have seriously eaten here over 50 times, and I know this because of all the ""frequent diner"" cards I burn through.

I came here when they very first opened and have been hooked ever since.  It is pretty hard to find a quality, affordable, non-chain, veg-friendly restaurant to go to in this town- but Market Grille fits the bill.

Everything is homemade and the ingredients are always fresh.  The service is always very friendly, and even though it's more of a fast-food set up, they are always coming by to make sure everything is ok.  The space is homey and casual.

The salad, hummus, and pita never disappoint.  I usually get the veggie skewers and my husband usually orders the veggie gyro.  When we really want to pig out, we order the combo appetizer platter as well.  

And I really can't even begin to describe to you my love affair with their cheesecake (and their pumpkin cheesecake, for that matter).  This has been my birthday cake for the last couple years.

Their prices are affordable and they have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free menus.  We have brought several family members here while they were visiting Vegas, and they all still talk about how great the restaurant was and how they wish they could have a slice of the cheesecake.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,3,2,5,EhlGY-tbhOTKLny35eOeOg

My favorite menu items are:
Gyros: I've had the chicken, traditional and the fillet (steak). The fillet is my favorite but they were all good! Get the dill yogurt sauce!

Soup and Salad Combo: Greek salad and lentil soup. I am on a quest to figure out the recipe for this lentil soup. It is delicious. The salad takes a back seat to the soup but it has always been fresh and tasty.



Hummus: Spinach Basil and the Roasted Red Pepper. They are both fantastic! They serve it with warm, fresh pita bread and it is difficult to not want to eat it all before your meal even arrives!


Fries: These were good, but Paymon's are better. I was surprised that they did not seem as ""home made"" as the other menu items. The seasoning is alright and the dipping sauce is good. I usually just stick to ordering hummus as our appetizer though. 

The only thing I have ordered and didn't care for was the falafel. And I think that was more my personal taste preference then incorrect preparation.

Desserts: Baklava cheesecake. Need I say more? The pumpkin version is wonderful as well.

Honey Walnut Cake: Super moist, not overly sweet. Kind of like a coffee cake/spice cake? We loved it. 

Ya Yas Cookies: Would be great with hot tea. Kind of like a short bread cookie. If you just want something a little sweet and not overly filling, give these a try! 

My family has tried other dished and loved them (stuffed bell peppers, moussaka etc) but I am sticking to what I have personally eaten and enjoyed :)

I am really pleased that they opened this location in the North end of town where I sometimes feel we are lacking quality restaurants. We go here several times a month (sometimes more!!).

362054,2015-04-02,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I went to this Market Grill today to try out their happy hour menu.  The server showed the part of menu where happy hour prices dishes are listed and at the same time she mentions that some of them are not in  happy hour menu / prices.  When I enquired which one's are  and which one's arent, she was not clear. I once asked her to point out, which dishes are in happy - prices and which are not, the server was very vague and did not clearly provide an answer and slid through it. That made me wonder if this was deliberate and sales tactics.

If Market Grill is sincere, they must print another menu with dishes qualifying for happy hour prices.  
The falafel was tasty and properly cooked.
I have been at this place for lunch and dinner. I have noticed, portions have become smaller and service poorer in the past two years.

 Telephonic information provision is inadequate and short.  The two women I have spoken with in the past two months sound irritated and want to cut conversion as short as possible

The food is amazing!  I typically start out with a soup and their pumpkin mushroom does not disappoint.  The hint of cinnamon makes it memorable and a new standard for my visits.  Lunch specials are a great value. The pomegranate chicken is pretty good and I love the hummus.  Atmosphere is casual and the waitresses are very friendly with speedy and enjoyable service.

It's seriously like a mission of his to serve those to the best of his and his families ability.

The lamb gyro is excellent, all of the food is very filling. There are so many options for sides to include or change in your meal, it's overwhelming. The patio is rather small, so it can get crowded with large parties or on busy days. I ended up being seated against a bush, a very awkward foursome lunch since we all had to face the wall.

857121,2017-11-11,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"Joe and Rhonda Pierro seem like they have a chain 2 chain restaurants because the place is so efficient and effective, but once you look at the menu and see that everything is a homemade recipe from their Italian and Greek origins, you start to realize and appreciate the thoughtfulness and care that went into this business model.

The owners do a great job keeping quality and knowledgeable employees and often will personally greet guests. I told them they should expand, but they actually love what they do and have a genuine commitment to the unique dining experience they provide.

Actual Greek and Italian food under one roof, with a fair price and great atmosphere probably has not been seen since the decline of the Greco-Roman empire. Other people try to do it, and I been around the world many times, but the Market Grille and Cafe is on the money in the way they provide their dining experience and cafe style.

If I had a physically attractive girl with a net worth of 1 billion dollars or more, then I would still take her here and she would love it. I know I can get a dining experience with distinction and class here or a quick bit of food. They even cater, have live music, and everyone acts right because they are well trained and/or the owners know how to both lead and manage.

You really can't have the Market Grille Cafe fail you. It's a top of the line small business and it is a pleasure and honor to know places like this still exist. Will be back unless I die sooner than I am planning on.

I live in Las Vegas. We have a lot of shisty people and businesses...that's what we are known for, among other things, but Joe and Rhonda have a great restaurant. Keep up the good work. Great to see this entity in our city.

1052577,2012-03-11,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"Ok then.  I reviewed many of the other reviews and thought I was in for a treat.  What a disappointment.  I have eaten here before, when the restaurant was in a corner off of centennial parkway. I didn't think it was that good then either, but I thought I would give it another try,

I ordered the traditiomal gyro platter.  It came with rice, salad, pita slices and dipping sauce, and a gyro pita sandwich.  I tried the rice first.  It was bland and dry.  The salad was good, at least the lettuce was fresh.  They gave me some little slices of pita bread and a little bit of dipping sauce.  Once again, bland. Then I tried the gyro.  It looked great.

Now I have eaten quite a few gyro sandwiches from different restaurants and am usually satisfied with the taste.  The meat (lamb in my case) is what makes the sandwich.  Oh my gosh what a surprise.  The meat barely had any flavor at all!  Additionally,  it didn't look like it was completely cooked and was very light colored.  It was so bland I didn't even eat half of the gyro.  Very disappointed.

I'll give you that the place is nicely decorated and the service staff was good, but the food just didn't cut it.  Prices could be better too, but they weren't that bad.

Won't be going back here, not while Paymons and my favorite, Yassou Grill on charleston/buffalo are still open.  The food at those two is much better than here.",tro7QPz1REVlVCB4W1Ehxw,0,0,2,TqB_YkIe3ck32jUp2HAWYg

We both decided we wanted gyros and dessert but the waitress pushed appetizers until we were caught in a bind of saying ""sure,"" so we got a plate of the ""Platos Potatoes."" They were decent steak-cut fries but very salty. That whole interaction is what took off one star from my review.  Though the waitress was super nice and thorough, we said right off the bat that we wanted entrees and dessert, and that we would skip the apps. Why not listen to the customer? No, we didn't have to say yes to apps but she wasn't taking no for an answer.

Our gyros were great (my lady got the traditional and I got the chicken.) We also ordered a slice of their ""award winning"" baklava crust cheesecake to go. It was interesting, but not my favorite off the wall cheesecake flavor. I think I would have liked a cannoli.

The second star comes off with the menu. There are several items listed as vegan that have dairy products listed in their descriptions. If it isn't actually vegan, why is that V there? It would make me nervous to eat here if I had an allergy or dietary restriction, or even a gluten intolerance just because the menu is blatantly wrong and potentially misleading.

We will probably check out the other location sometime when our next Greek food craving hits, but this one kind of left a bad taste in our mouths.",ROMD11t9rLV-FuNJPRoY1g,1,0,3,cckRHQDSs5IVKOzZLTIdUQ

Describing the food as incredible just does not do it enough justice.  There are very few places that I have eaten at over my 40+ years that serve food that has so much depth of flavor.  

I started with the pumpkin mushroom soup and honestly, I could have just eaten that all day long.  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever had.  I then moved into the entree where I had the pomogranate chicken and it about knocked me out of my chair.  The chicken was so tender, moist and the flavor was intoxicating.  I honestly could have eaten like 10 chicken breasts cooked this way.  Wow, what an amazing treat.  Then to finish off the experience I had the baklava cheesecake.  I was told that this dessert won an award at a food competition and I do not doubt it at all.  It was as lucious as it gets.  What an amazing way to finish.  The experience was basically a food orgasm.  

The Market Grille Cafe is a family owned business with two locations in town and the service and hospitality of ALL of the people that work there is just as impressive as the food.  The MGC has it all, atmosphere, hospitality, and most importantly incredible food.  If that was not enough the prices for the food are as economically friendly as it can be.  The MGC is very wallet friendly.  I do not know how they do it for so little but they do. I spend just as much or more for fast food and do not get anything close to this in quality.  

I am a huge Gyro fan so my next visit I am definitely going to try one.  I saw someone else having one and asked how it was and they said it was outstanding and the best they ever had.  I cannot say I am surprised.  

I urge all of my Yelpers out there to visit the Market Grille Cafe and enjoy the same amazing experience I had.

As a person who has never tried Greek food outside of trying it at this restaurant (thus having nothing to compare it to), I would still say that this place has delicious foods! I was vegan for a year and eating out with others was very difficult for me, but this place has so many great options for vegans! I usually get the lentil soup and they always ask if I want the cheese off, knowing that it is a vegan dish. :) I also get the hummus and pita bread and its so good! I usually get the trio with my family. The warm pita paired with the zesty-tangy hummus makes my mouth so happy! 

The atmosphere is nice and definitely a good restaurant to try out if you are in the mood for Greek or something different from fast food. (Some dishes may be a little ""sour"" for people if you are sensitive to Greek yogurt, dill, or lemon.

Their Gyros are awesome, the only criticism I would give is they tend to pack a bit too much lettuce in compared which seems that they are skimping on the meat.  The greek fries are also great as they are seasoned perfectly.  The dipping sauce they have is awesome.

On the down side, by wife and I have tried their tabouli 3 separate times, and each time, it was spoiled.  It wasn't just a matter of it being a bit old, it was flat out stinky and nasty.  The first two times we brought it back to the restaurant (carry out) and they confirmed it had spoiled and gave us a refund.  The third time we just gave up lol.

A few times some of our items have had tomatoes in them and they were mealy.  Not good :(

1291379,2018-05-13,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I have been a frequent visitor to Market Grille over the past 12 months, going several times a month to get their delicious food.

Unfortunately, something must have changed in the past month or so. I almost always get take-out, but the past 2 orders have been either incomplete or unfulfilled completely.

A few weeks ago, I ordered a traditional gyro lunch special with drink. The guy behind the counter could not understand a single thing on the phone, having to repeat myself multiple times. When I picked up my order, I did not have my drink when I departed. I had to drive 10 minutes back to the restaurant to pick it up (partly my fault - should of known my drink wasn't there). However, the issue with the same employee was no apologies or understanding of what had just happened. He was completely dumbfounded!

The second instance was just this morning. I called to make my order and told 15-20 minutes to get it ready. No problem. I show up 15 minutes later and there is NO record of my order! The young lady behind the desk, again seemingly clueless, is unable to log onto her computer to see what is going on. While this is transpiring, she is answering 2 phone calls (not putting them on-hold) instead of taking care of the in-presence customer. I patiently wait, but finally give up and cancel my would-be order. She offered to get the manager, but I politely declined (I should have). 

I'm not sure what is going on. Customer service at this place used to be 5 stars ALL the time. Recently, something is amiss. Either management has dropped the ball (inconveniently twice for me) or they are hiring people with zero social skills.

This is quite a shame. Whatever happened to the ""Best of Las Vegas""? No awards since 2014...",Ch-nAimrIBqgg4vWuQgllw,0,0,2,rH5ic1AZXrXrlkAipSKFHw

First, the good: staff and atmosphere. Our server, Carol, was excellent. She explained everything to us, was attentive, and even picked up a toy our 11-month old dropped. The restaurant itself was beautiful and comfortable. Food was delivered quick.

The not-so-good: the food. It was underwhelming. I got the gyro with a side of fries and my husband got the spanakopita, and we tried their baklava. My meal was basically boring; no flavors, other than the raw onions, stood out. The meat was tender and moist, but lacked flavor; the pita bread was nice though. The spanakopita was not memorable either. The baklava was enormous, but it was gritty - maybe from too much brown sugar, we're not sure. We didn't finish any parts of our meal.

We were very disappointed. We usually go to Paymon's, but it's a bit of a trek from our house, so we were hoping the Market Grille could be a substitute, but alas, it cannot compete with Paymon's.",dlakiiEemBIOdZGwbnlE-A,3,0,2,8wccGNJaRkoiz7N0ugC_Jw

Definitely get the hummus with fresh pita, it's a great start to the meal. For my main dish I tried the pastitsio and a steak skewer. The steak was cooked perfectly, and I mean perfectly. Better than I've had at some high end steakhouses. My only knock on the food was the pastitsio. It had good flavor, but was served barely above room temperature, so after the first couple bites it just did not hold up very well.

Not only are the food and the service delightful, but the vibe you get when you walk in, seeing Rose (the Matriarch of the family-owned restaurant) attending to the little things, greeting customers, making the utensil bundles in napkins, checking in on happy customers... It's simply wonderful. I have 0% Greek/Mediterranean blood, but the place feels like my Swedish Gramma's kitchen -- full of love, great aromas and happiness. 

I had the Gyro Platter (it was lunch-ish time). It was GENEROUS and delicious. I opted for the Traditional Beef and Lamb combo filling, but there are many choices, including Vegan. The homemade hummus was tangy and delicious. The Basmati rice - perfection. The green salad was all Greek with olives, cucumbers and Feta cheese and you MUST try the Pumpkin-Mushroom Soup -- a cup was just not enough. Next time, I'm getting a full bowl or maybe some to take home. It is comfort in a cup. 

My husband had the Greek Trio, Pastisto, Mousaka and one other item (sorry, I was more focused on tasting my delicious Gyro) and he was very pleased with all of it.

We opted for dessert to be taken out and it didn't disappoint. The Baklava was also generously served and was sweet, sweet, sweet.

Let me preface this with I can not spell, so please forgive me if I spell the dishes wrong!

The hummus was good, the pita bread was great and warm, not burned or dry. The consistency of the hummus was smooth, probably thanks to the yogurt it's made with.

I have the spanakopita plate (spinach pie) which I thought was very good. Great balance of phyllo dough, spinach and feta. It was nice to have the plate because it came with rice, a small greek salad (which was good - lots of feta, good salty kalamata olives and nice oil and vinegar dressing) and a taste of hummus (we had gotten an appetizer of the hummus as well...we love hummus).

My hubby had the chicken gyro and really enjoyed it. You can pick was dressing you want on the sandwich, which is nice (tsatziki, hummus or something else).

We also had a side plate of the falafel, which was really good! They were small little falafel balls, but the texture was really nice. Very smooth with a great flavor!

Despite it's location next to many prefab, commercialized eating establishments, Market Grille Cafe is truly a diamond in the rough
From the time you walk in you immediately notice a nicely decorated place setting the tone that you are about to enjoy yourself.

The next sensation are the smells that begin to prime the taste buds for the wonderful meal that you are about enjoy.

The first few times I was here I pretty much did the Gyro thing and as Gyros go, I was happy.

Tonight, while on a date with my girl, I thought I would branch out and try something different.  I ordered the steak skewers entree which included hummus with pita bread, salad and rice.

My girl ordered the pomegranate salad. An interesting chose I thought.

They staff is so darn friendly and helpful you almost feel transported to another time when this behavior was expected in all restaurants.  They do a great job.

Tonight seemed a bit slow and less noisy than the other times I have been here.  It made for a nice evening of conversation before and after our meal arrived.

Before even taking a bite, I went for a taste of the pomegranate salad.  My first bite told me that this was something special.  Your first hit with pomegranate flavor that explodes in your mouth,  It then begins to disappear and the texture and touches of chicken that did not soak up the marinade follow through.  

I could feel the foodie Barbarian inside me begin to take over but reminded myself that I am a gentleman and proceeded to allow my girl to eat in peace.

My meal was perfectly seasoned and looked incredible.  I started off with the house salad on the plate which was fresh and light with the prefect amount dressing.  The olives and cheese made it only better.

The steak was cooked to a medium well and when they were hot they melted in my mouth.

On must always eat their veggies.  I have a phobia about veggies that I am not going to talk about because I don't need to.  The veggie skewers after their consumption required me to get up an order one more because it was just so good.

Two Plates of great chow with drinks for twenty dollars even.  I found the deal most acceptable.

They also have a punch card program for $10 off your meal.  Don't forget to get one.

The desserts looked awesome but my ever expanding waistline told me that I had better not.

Even as the staff was closing up shop they allowed us to continue our conversation on of all things ""Andre The Giant.""  They gave no indication of being annoyed with us.  I appreciated that.

They will soon be making a move to a larger venue on Durango & Elk Horn.  I wish them continued success and will gladly drive 30 miles across the valley to eat there again.  This should say something about the experience.

1588303,2017-12-12,15,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I didn't even know about this location til a friend planned holiday meal here for a group- I'm a regular at the Lake Mead location, and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious and more formal interior here. The open grill area where the pita bread is made is a nice touch, too! Unfortunately, the service marred our festive gathering.

The flaming presentation of the Saganaki app set the bar high for food expectations but everything was downhill from there. Menu  is pretty standard- being familiar with their dishes, I know what I like and chose accordingly. The falafel wrap is my usual go-to, and this time I switched it up for the pom chicken and it was flavorful. I sampled friends' orders and the Mama Mia chicken (with goat cheese and balsamic) was tasty, but I did not care for the various pasta dishes, the sauces just did not taste right. Also, most components of the Mediterranean Medley app were off (hummus was bland, babaghanouj had a strange texture, hummus was thin and watery, and dolmas tasted plain).

Most of us enjoyed our food, but man. The service. It seems they are incapable of handling a large (10 person?) group. This was a classic example of why I hate autograt for groups- our server was polite enough when she was around but was less than attentive and repeatedly needed to be flagged down for the basics, like placing orders, correcting orders, address billing issues, etc. The bare minimum was not met. 

We interacted with the manager, who was also initially friendly, but even when he stepped in to help with billing, it was still a disaster: unable to honor a discount (several military in our group), unable to split the bill appropriately, that ridiculous autograt in light of the whole fiasco, several excuses and a bunch of time-wasting, and a general lack of capability. It took literally half an hour to resolve, and it only ended because one friend just put it all on their card and took cash and IOUs from everyone else. Generous, but ridiculous that it was warranted! And it wasn't just us- a third-party food delivery person came in, had an issue, spoke with the manager, and then knocked over a holiday display in anger as he left.

I could tell that the food had been prepared and was reheated to be served but still had thatgood flavor. my lady's dish was great!! the pomegranate chicken was so tender and was surprisingly sweet, not overpowering but it was done very nicely! we also had the saganaki for an appetizer and it was so good! The seared cheese with the lemon and brandy was awesome. They also have happy hour where the saganaki was for $6!!

I think the cutest thing is that there's a cute greek mama who works the cashier.  Everyone who works there seems really friendly, too.  Everything is supposed to be homemade, too.

Items I have tried:
1.  Gyro - tasty, seasoned lamb, chopped romaine, tasty dill/yogurt dressing and warm flat bread
2.  Gyro salad - everything in a gyro, just minus the flat bread and it's vinegarette dressing and feta cheese.
3.  Keftedes - Greek meatballs + some fluffy basmati rice
4.  Pomegranate Chicken Salad - White meat chicken marinated in pomegranate dressing and grilled to perfection, not to dry and juicy enough with a covering of more pom dressing, and all of it placed on a bed of baby spinach leaves.

The spanakopita was delicious, just the right amount of flavors.  The greek salad had an amazing dressing that didn't over power the salad and brought out all of the natural flavors.  The basmati rice was to die for - the rice literally melted in my mouth and so flavorful.  The hummis was hands down the best hummis I've ever had.  Hummis was the only greek thing I've ever had and only tried store bought.  The hummis here was so yummy.  My husband said this was the best ""spinach pie"" he's ever had.  I talked about this place so much at work that a gal who travels frequently and who is greek stated she never had been there.  Well, she went the next night after I talked it up so much.

After they claimed to correct the order, it was still completely wrong.  We spoke to owner/manager Joe later in the evening, not sure if anything can be corrected.  Staff think that customers don't know Greek food although many of us the customers are either Greek or from Mediterranean countries. Ordered the following:

1) Ordered plain Gyro with nothing on it.  Came as a Pita sandwich with thick combination of  inside the bread.  Sent it back, and it still came back 15 minutes later same way.  I don't believe they fixed the problem.  When the take out person went back to the kitchen to ask kitchen staff to fix it, I heard laughter from the kitchen. I guess it is pretty funny when you don't do your job right !

2) Ordered pita bread 'plain'.  It came with 'rosemary'.  Some people are allergic to rosemary.  Our order was very clear. 

3) Ordered salads with no onions in them.  They looked like they added extra onions to salads !

This whole ordeal took 1 hour !   for take out.  Is this a joke ?  When we brought the food home, it was cold.  and home is around the corner.

As frequent customers (twice a week) and occasional catering since the day they opened, this was the worst we have seen.  

Also the smart ass waiter asked for my ID for the $45 dollar order and questioned that I had a moustache in my ID photo and I don't have a moustache in person.

Although the guy who took my order was nice, I had to repeat my order twice and had to correct him when he read it back to me and was missing an item. Of course when I got there it was still wrong. I ordered 3 gyro sandwiches, 1 gyro platter, large order of platos potatoes (seasoned fries)  and some cheesecake. I received only 3 gyros so I was missing one. This was what I kept telling the guy over the phone that I wanted 3 gyros PLUS the platter but he still didn't get it. Oh well he didn't charge me for it and I didn't want to wait longer for them to make it so I just left with what I had.

The gyro was gross the meat was cold, very dry and flavorless. We asked for the cucumber sauce on the side and it came in 1oz cups. Same with the hummus that comes w/ the platter and the sauce that comes with the large order of fries. Reallly 1oz??? It makes me angry to pay 8.00 for a sandwich and get a little cup of sauce. Gyro time is way better for gyros if that's what your looking for do not waste your time here! I did enjoy the aphrodite cheesecake which is why the 1 star but everything else from the food to the service was crappy.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,8,5,1,yxxSErhc9OR0JsPjJhLOSg

The spinach basil hummus is off the chain.. The only thing I could say to encourage owners is the odd way that they hand deliver sweetener/ sugar..

So, I proceeded to get up myself and walk the 10 feet to the drink station directly across from our table to refill my drink and I was blocked by 2 different servers, who directed me to go sit back down and they would call my server over.

He was quick to offer us a gluten-free/vegan/veggie menu, as I said I couldn't ingest dairy.  During our meal, he came by and asked if we were happy with everything (we were).  I ended up ordering the lentil soup and the Plato's Potatoes (i.e., fries topped with a secret spice blend).  The soup was delicious, but the fries were so-so (I thought the accompanying yogurt dip was too yogurt-y and the fries on their own were surprisingly bland).  I also ordered a few of the butter cookies, which proved to be a good decision.  Lovely, shortbread-like cookies dusted with confectioner's sugar.

The place is clean and bright and is great for a casual meal with friends.  You make your order at the counter, pay, take a number, find a seat, then wait for your meal to be brought to you.  It's like a very upscale cafeteria!

Excuse me for not remembering the name of the dish but I got the appetizer with the cheese that they light on fire.  I've had it about 6 times in my life before and it always ends up spreadable and delish.   This time it didn't have great flavor and it hardened up way to fast.  I'd take a pass on this item if I had a do-over.   The falafel's didn't hit the spot.  But I've only had it once before so I'm not sure what good falafel even tastes like... so it gets a pass.  

The most major downer was the lamb and beef gyro.   It was bland and didn't have that rich tasty flavor I need in my gyro.  The meat wasn't doing it for me.  I kinda wanted to throw it across the room in sadness.   

But the service was very quality.  Our server was Athena and she was solid.  I asked for the feta and cheese on the side but when the gyro came out, it was on it.  She kept my soda full enough to look past it.

I was able to try their moussaka today. The eggplant tasted fresh, potatoes were tender and the beef was seasoned just right. Although nothing really comes close to the food in Greece, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It tasted fresh rather then cooked, freezed and thawed when ordered. Greek salad came on the side which was fresh as well.  Along with my entree also came pita and hummus. The hummus was quite tasty. Mmmmm...

Before leaving...I tried the Aphrodite's Cheesecake as I read it won a few food awards. It had a baklava bottom crust. Delicious! The cheesecake itself was rich and creamy. The baklava on the bottom was yummy, but not crisp due to the cheese cake sitting on top.

The menu has your standard Greek fare. Most items can be ordered a la carte, which comes with just rice, or as an entree, which then comes with rice, salad, hummus, and pita. If you have a smaller (ie, normal) sized appetite, the a la carte will be just fine. Dad and his gf enjoyed the lamb kabob and mousaka, and bf and I shared a gyro wrap and a lamb gyro. Wish the gyros had a bit more tzatziki but the flavor was good and the meats very tender.

Sat outside on the patio as it was a beautiful day. I had my 4 month old and we had plenty of space to start. Sever was nice and informative about specials and drinks. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and saganaki to start. The saganaki was the best part of our experience. The saganaki is a piece of cheese sitting in olive oil, lemon, and brandy that is lit on fire table side. It was served with warm pita bread. Delicious. We ordered three entrees to share (we often just pass plates to try a little of every thing). The Greek trio was odd and underwhelming. Think shepherds pie, baked ziti, and spinach with filo dough. Eh. The pomegranate chicken was highly recommended and was the dish the waitress said was an award winner. Didn't win any awards in our book. Was VERY sweet...but at the same time not flavorful? Lastly, the vasilios platter was basically a deconstructed gyro. Again, not a lot of flavor and a bit underwhelming. The sataziki and hummus were perfectly acceptable. Our peaceful evening turned a bit sour when a family of 8 arrived with their 70 pound dog. He jumped on another guest not a part of their party and tired multiple times to get over to us and our food. Waitresses frequently were seen petting and interacting with the dog, which left a sour taste in my mouth. Got dessert to go. The aphrodites cheesecake was again supposed to be another award winner per our waitress. We took about three bites before we threw it away. The worlds best dessert, aka the chocolate baklava, was terrible. Something was terribly burnt and bitter.

While many things have changed in Las Vegas, Market Grille remains consistent--in all the right ways. Whether we are picking up take out after a long day, or want to bring out of towners for a relaxed patio dinner on a nice summer evening, we know that everyone will leave full and happy.

My mom is gluten free, I have several vegetarian friends, the menu accommodates almost everyone's needs. My favorites are the lemon chicken soup, the pomegranate chicken, and the stuffed tomatoes. The baklava is also amazing, and the pumpkin cheesecake if you are feeling particularly indulgent. 


Market Grille has gone out of their way for me on several occasions - giving me a laminated copy of their nutritional information (before the menu changed a little - not sure if these are still available) to even pureeing lentil soup for me when I had suffered a dental emergency.

We finally decided we wanted to try something different for dinner and decided to stop in. We got lucky and went in during happy hour. They have some discounts on wine and appetizers. We tried the appetizer sampler so we could try a bunch of different things since we weren't sure what any of them were. For the most part, everything was great. There were a couple things we didn't care for but it was because of our personal preferences in tastes. He got the greek trio so again we could try a few different menu items and I got the keftedes and they were both pretty good.

I was bummed that it wasn't as good as I was expecting. I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the food tho. Everybody has different tastes.

I've come to the conclusion that every yelper from North Vegas has really bad taste in food or they're stuck in an area with atrocious food and they THINK places like this is actually good.

I started my meal with Falafels. Incredibly salty. They pressed the idea that everything is homemade at their location. Why isn't the chef or the cooks tasting any of the food before they're sent out? Don't order this unless you like making funny faces because the salt is overwhelming.

I ordered the filet tenderloin wrap and my date ordered a chicken skewer a la carte. My wrap was pretty bland and had barely any pieces of meat. It was mostly filled with carbs. My date's chicken skewer was dry. The best thing that came out of the kitchen was the vegetable skewer that came with the chicken skewer. 

If you want to get a really good chicken skewer, go to Crazy Pita. If you want some fresh falafels that are truly made to order fresh, go to Sababa's on Durango / Desert Inn.

2539834,2012-04-07,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"My first experience was when the restaurant first opened.  My boyfriend and I walked in and saw that there was not table service and the place was difficult to walk around in so we walked out and went somewhere else that night.  
The second experience was a take out order.  I walked in and was told that I could not place an order at the front and was told to walk around the restaurant to the other entrance and place an order there.  I wish I had been walked to that area, via the inside of the restaurant, and just been told that there was a separate entrance for take out orders so that I did not have to wait at the main entrance.  I ordered my meal and Rhonda was at the cashier station.  When I mentioned that I was from Tucson, AZ, she was even more welcoming and shared the history that she and Joe have with Tucson.  We exchanged business cards and they were both great and friendly.  The meal I took home was alright, nothing special but I thought I would try coming in and sitting down next time because the service format had changed and there was now table service.  Good idea.
The third experience was when my boyfriend and I walked in and we were first seated at a table in the middle of the room.  No thank you, we asked for a more private booth and were seated in a more comfortable area.  We noticed that every table that came in the restaurant was offered the same ""middle of the room table"" that we were offered and they all turned it down as well.  Our server was a young woman who was    friendly and welcoming,  I ordered the Jasmine tea after asking her she would recommend it or not, she said, ""I don't drink it so I don't know"".  I ordered it anyways and it was good.  She came back with our drinks and then took our order.  For an appetizer we ordered the Feta Cheese and Olive dish.  The chunks of cheese were too large and numerous, the olives were on the plate where the juices ran all over.  They should have been in a small bowl and then put on the plate.  The olives were pitted too and that is a sign of an inferior taste, and the flavor was strong but inferior.  They tasted like cheap olives.  I ordered the roasted chicken with potatoes and rice.  When the dish came I was so surprised that I was served the Back Bone Cut of the Chicken.  Never in my life have I ever served or been served the Back Bone of a chicken.  There are many very small bones that come off of the vertebra and the meat is tender but the pieces are difficult to get to with a knife and fork.  That is a piece saved for the stock pot.   I sent it back and was given a huge breast which was dry and over seasoned.  The meal was so bad that I ate three bites and we paid the bill and left.  I realize that this is not fast food and it is not a 4 star establishment but the food was not good and the servers are not well trained.  Our server filled our glasses every time we took a sip and checked up on us every 2 minutes, the knives were sent back because they were dirty, the food was terribly prepared, served and when we gave feedback we were looked at like we had two heads.  On top of it, when Joe came to the table to apologize, I reminded him of our previous meeting and he must not have heard one word that I said because he just stared at me and then went on about the food.  I owned 4 restaurants for many years and I know what good service is, this was poor service and poor food.  When the owner meets a customer, it is important to remember them because even when the food  is off for the night, the customer will give you another try.  For me, three strikes and you are out and I have a story that I will share with friends now.",ifwHqWqtakn47BDcvLyexQ,1,1,2,PS2dX_3BrSxdE5py7Gthjw

Salads do NOT count & we usually eat hummus/baba ganoush at home, anyway.

Lady on the phone had to check the actual vegetarian/vegan-ness of every option- kinda frustrating when I am used to ""Mediterranean/Greek"" style food always having tons of options for me. Usually I can just ask for no yogurt or no cheese. I appreciated the honesty & the helpfulness, because I genuinely have dairy allergies & don't want to risk it.

We decided not to order, because we were hungry & needed a substantial meal (not just appetizers).

That said, I think it is a really, really, REALLY bad decision to add feta cheese to your falafel, because I know a lot of us vegans go for it on a pita on the weekly & I doubt your omnivores would genuinely miss it. It's not usually used, in my experience.

The pita bread was soft, warm and tasted great. Unfortunately the meat had no seasoning which resulted in no flavor. A few too many diced onions for my taste. Ok to eat, but I have had better.

Here's his tip: When a guest complains before paying their bill, they are giving you a chance to fix their dining experience.  The most neutral thing you could have said and still salvaged a portion of your tip would have been, ""I'm so sorry""....

Every time I go to scan something, the punch card changes so it makes it nearly impossible to fill up your card because it disappears and you have to start all over with a new card. For example, it used to be: A) buy a pomegranate chicken, get a stamp; B) buy a dessert, get a stamp; C) buy an entree, get a stamp. Now it's get a stamp for every $10 you spend. By the time I come back, it will likely change again! Furthermore, the app hardly works. I reset the app multiple times and could not get the camera to work. The cashier at Take Out wrote a note on my receipt to bring in next time and hope that the app works then so they can give me the stamps from today's visit. This was all after I asked her if they had a back up system for when the app fails. Technology is great, until it doesn't work. Management should have a back up plan for this kind of error. The cashier stated she said had seen this error with the camera before. 

Also, I was expecting to see the Take Out area full since all the designated spots were taken out front... NOPE! I was the only one there. Note to customers, read the signs and don't park there if you aren't taking out.",Z2BrOYB0rPhBdD5dm3wb1A,0,1,4,U-I4r0PXKez7-BBMl3YeNw

2880069,2012-03-16,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I give a star for the food, but the customer service has been horrible, especially since the move to the new location. I order for pick up frequently and I always have to go above and beyond to make sure they get my order right. I always ask for chopped olives in my gyro. At one point, they had forgotten the olives and I called the manager to complain, the manager replied that I should've checked my food before I left. I said I did check my food, its hard to see the olives because they usually put them under the meat, so I asked the cashier if the olives were in there, and she said yes. Then he told me, well if you still weren't sure, you shouldve called for a manager. Seriously?? So I have to check my food, ask the cashier if she took the order down right, AND call for a manager, all just to make sure that the order is done right which is THEIR job in the first place. 

Yesterday, I ordered for pick up the exact same way I usually do, but this time they put the olives on the side and they weren't chopped. So I asked the lady if they could put it in the gyro, chopped. She then told me that I didn't specify to have it on the gyro. I told her, I always come here and I never usually have to say that, they usually have it in the gyro. She then said, well you can't expect us to memorize your order. 

Hmm..if I get pizza at Pizza Hut and I say, can you add sausage, they don't usually put in on the side. If I go to Burger King, and I said add onions in my burger, they don't usually put it on the side. At the very least, if they weren't sure, they would ask ""do you want it on the side"" before they do. They don't have to memorize my order for that. 

Bottom line, don't order pick up from here. And if they mess up your order, expect them to get a really defensive attitude about it before they fix it. Whatever happened to good customer service? Its nice to see a family owned business do well, but most family owned businesses have better customer service than they do. Whether it's poor training on the cash registers or poor customer service training, I doubt they will ever fix the problem, because they always seem to blame it on the customer than look at what's wrong with their service model.",43zg6n3HecGVywBioZ2ipA,0,0,1,NZDOxrtbHG3RKwfl0_k0xQ

If you're looking for take out or a nice place to sit and eat, stop by your nearest Market Grille Cafe and have a gyro.  I have to suggest the pumpkin soup because it was out of this world.  And if you are in the mood for interesting dessert, please have their butter cookies or their cheesecake.

The owners run their business very well, cook even better and mingle with their clients. Top marks for this family owned business!

I have asked mgmt if they have new cooks and they replied ""no we are just busy"". The food is also sub par, the hummus is thin and the dolmas are dry and hard to eat. Yesterday my bill came to $54.00, I put a $100.00 in the check folder and then left to do some quick grocery shopping at  Smiths Grocery in the same parking lot. I immediately realized I had not left a tip. I returned within 30 minutes to ask the girl for the check folder back and she denied I had left the $44.00 dollars. So basically they stole $44.00 of my money. I would of a left a very generous holiday tip but not $44.00. Mgmt was no help. They called the owner who also was no help. He basically didn't believe me. Is this the way to treat a patron who has continually spent around $250.00 a month over $44.00?

Lamb Souvlaki Gyro ($8.95): I ordered just the gyro, though, for $3.50 more you can get a side of rice, a Greek salad, and hummus and pita bread. I like how they provide the option of having either the traditional shaved meat or grilled meat. For my gyro I chose the shaved meat. The lamb was fine, but I thought it was under seasoned. On a future visit, I'd probably just stick with the traditional gyro consisting of both lamb and beef. 

Greek Trio Platter ($12.95): This was my boyfriend's order. The platter came with samplers of  Spanakopita, Mousaka, and Pastitsio. Plus, it came with rice, Greek salad, and slices of pita bread and hummus. The Spanakopita was the best with its flaky filo pastry and spinach and feta cheese layers. Our least favorite out of the three was the Pastitsio with its cinnamon and beef and tomato sauce combination. The Mousaka was just OK. 

The service was good. Our server was upbeat and knowledgeable about the menu, and she was enthusiastic about sharing her favorites and offering her suggestions.

There's a good amount of dining space with tables as well booths and there's also a spacious patio if eating outside is your thing. You can also place a phone order and use the door on the side of the building with a sign designated for pick up orders. I do recommend placing your order ahead of time instead of walking in to order because they get busy around dinner and it helps avoid a longer wait time. I have ordered before and showed up 5 minutes after they said it would be ready and still waited like 10 minutes. The staff is friendly and servers have been good about checking my table for refills while dining inside and I also appreciate how when I arrive to pick up a phone order that they go over everything to make sure it's all correct and that it's all there. 

Pomegranate Chicken Mediterranean Wrap ($9.50) - Pomegranate chicken, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, red cabbage, basmati rice, feta cheese with your choice of sauce (hummus or yogurt dill) and tortilla (flour, wheat and spinach-basil). I asked for extra yogurt dill (extra .50 cents) and spinach-basil for the tortilla. I really like the flavor of the pomegranate chicken and veggies together and the yogurt dill sauce is good. The wrap is huge I usually only eat half and save the rest for later. All wraps include a side Greek salad. The salad tastes fresh, but not the best I have had.

They have a lunch special from 11:30 am - 3 pm that's currently $8.50. You can choose from a gyro, pomegranate chicken, wrap or skewer and you also get to choose from platos potatoes (seasoned fries), salad, basmati rice or soup. The lunch special also includes a drink. Not a bad deal at all. The seasoned fries are really good and the dipping sauce that comes with them tastes good.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,60,63,4,R8FBXA4VbifGarwX5j6Y8g

From the moment we were seated (there was no wait), Raymond, our awesome server, greeted us with a superb introduction to this little family owned restaurant. He was prompt with our order and made fantastic recommendations. We had the Saganaki appetizer, the Avgolemono soup, the Pomegranate Chicken, the Greek Trio, and took home a big slice of pumpkin cheesecake for later. Everything, even the side dish of rice and hummus, was spectacular.

We had so much food, that we took our left overs and dessert back to our friends. The minute we shared our experience, the leftovers began to disappear.

The falafel is seriously the best I have ever had. Better than anything I had in Greece! I actually regret trying this because now no other falafel will compare. I stopped at the Mad Greek on the way back to Vegas and just as I suspected...not nearly as good. And it's normally not bad! 

We had a large order (there were 8 of us) and they checked each bag in front of us to ensure we got all the correct food. We got several orders of:
Falafel - Absolutely delicious. 
Hummus trio - Great.

I was craving kabob and a Greek salad, I couldn't decide which to order, salmon or filet kabob, our waitress explained that I could order one of each and it would be the same price as the entree, which was $12.95. I went with that. 

I receive my salad first, it had good flavor and all my favorites in a typical Greek salad. My entree comes out. I taste the basmati rice, bland, no flavor. I moved onto the hummus & pita. The hummus was ok, but my pita was basically store bought pita bread sliced into triangles. Another let down. So then I try the salmon, it was so dry and Inedible. Last thing, the filet kabob, again no flavor at all. I NEVER salt my food, this needed it terribly, I ended up using the hot sauce on the table to give it some flavor. 

When the bill comes, I notice she charges me $12.95 plus $6.95 for a ""side"" kabob. This is not how she explained this to me. This meal was terrible and not worth $5, let alone $20.

I had Gyros platter, the gyro was Nice sized and the meat was cut off the vertical spit (not frozen gyros ""patties""). the platter includes a nice sized Greek salad with tangy homemade Greek dressing and some seasoned rice and humus and pita ( I liked the humus with yogurt, then it's not the consistency of kindergarten paste).

This pita bread is about as good as you get in Las Vegas.

4106877,2017-12-10,7,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"The food was good, but the service left a sour taste in my mouth.

Market Grille Cafe is absurdly far from my place in Henderson, but I was willing to drive to Centennial Hills to meet up with some Yelp friends for a holiday gathering. We certainly had our share of socializing and gift-giving, but when it came down to the restaurant experience, we had service issues which added up to at least 30 minutes' worth of time wasted. And that's a very, very generous estimate.

For starters, our server seemingly ignored us for most of the time other than asking us what we wanted to drink. Perhaps this can be attributed to the crowded restaurant, including a large party in a private room to the side, but they should have either called in another employee or warned us in advance about the possible delay. We had to wave our server down both to order some appetizers and later on to request our entrees.

When entrees were brought out, my moussaka had mistakenly went to a friend who had ordered pastitsio, and an employee was calling out their pastitsio as moussaka. Yes, both are similarly layered dishes, but that shouldn't be an issue. You should be able to call the right dishes out regardless. (We did get the right entrees eventually.)

Finally, there was a concern with paying the bill which I'm not fully clear on, but some confusion at least resulted from the kitchen's mistake on one tablemate's entree necessitating a send-back/replacement order and some sort of change to the bill. And then there were concerns with splitting the check, which surely shouldn't be that difficult for a restaurant that has been around for so long and has such long tables as the one which accommodated the 11 of us. Oh, and it looked like 20% automatic gratuity was applied on top of all that? That was the last straw. I tip 15% minimum on principle and that would've possibly been too much tonight.

Food was pretty solid, for what it's worth. The saganaki ($11), a famous flaming Greek cheese dish, had all the presentation value and plenty of cheesy flavor (accompanied by sliced pita ""wedges""). The moussaka entree ($13) was surprisingly light and fluffy, perhaps ending up a bit light on the meat compared to other restaurants' renditions. The sides were pretty solid, although the basmati rice was a bit undersalted, the hummus was oddly a little thin, and I can't ever understand why they don't dice the olives up in Greek salad. Bites of dishes such as spaghetti and Mamma Mia's Chicken were also satisfying. I could've probably given 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 if I didn't have other concerns.

That said, I simply can't envision myself ever returning to Market Grille Cafe with any sort of larger group. The food was tasty but not unique, the location kinda sucks for me (and anyone else who doesn't live in Centennial Hills or perhaps Aliante), and although I'm usually patient person, I really could've used the wasted time tonight in particular.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,7,2,axKpEYcZ7sVZ8YILBNEOEw

There are times when even on vacation you want some comfort food and for me that's spaghetti.  I've had my fair share of it at a ton of places.  I like to compare.  Usually the taste, the type of sauce, taste of the sauce, is there even enough sauce? You know the basics.  Also if they have them with meatballs, sausage or meat sauce.  With me the type of meat is usually the only thing that differs.  
I proceeded to get the spaghetti with meatballs.  Time for some comfort!! Now this is a Mediterranean place so there is also a lot of Greek food which I'm sure is also delicious! Anywho when the waitress brought my plate I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a huge dish. Because as much as I love spaghetti sometimes you just get full.  My plate also came with pieces of pita bread which were awesome! Only downside was that there wasn't enough sauce. I usually like a lot of sauce but it tasted great so not really a downside. The meatballs were small and just a bit dry but it was a mix of beef, veil and another meat I can't remember.  But they were also delicious.  
All in all I was happy with their spaghetti!!
I also decided to have the rice pudding!! Omg it was delicious!! It was smooth and creamy with cinnamon on top, which I'm not a fan of cinnamon but it paired so well with the rice pudding.

Also they have to clock in for their shift according to the restaurant clock time which is set 5 minutes fast. So on the computer it shows them clocking in at 5 before the shift began. So at the end of the night they go into the computer and ajust the time and take away 5 minutes from each employee.

The Gyros were absolutely fantastic; we had the Gyro Meat, Pomegranate Chicken, and Falafel.  They also have salads, pasta, wraps, and a good selection of traditional Greek favorites.
3) Wine & Beer selection isn't robust but has a nice variety and surely something to match any taste.  You have some traditional domestics and imports and some draft beer options.  Red & white wines available from Napa Valley, California Coast, as well as Italian, Greek, Argentinian, and French wines.  Didn't try the Sangria but it was recommended.
4) Prices were more than reasonable and food portions were generous.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,0,0,5,YJb93jcbA-5CbAbTSRrWXQ

4228336,2016-09-29,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"Called in a take-away order and picked it up. I ordered pasta stefano - delicate al dente angel hair with a wonderfully light and tangy lemon and garlic sauce, nicely salty Parmesan cheese, capers and fresh basil. I really enjoyed it and wished it was served in a larger portion. I'm used to oversized portions so this was probably a dietary normal size!! 

We also had the traditional gyro plate. The gyro meat was nice and tender with traditional flavor. The tsatziki sauce was cool and creamy with a little tang. 

Of course we had to get pita bread with tsatziki on the side. The pita was light, served warm and was pleasantly chewy and soft. 

We shared a Greek salad to round out our meal. The greens were fresh and crispy. I always look closely at salads to make sure all the greens and vegs are clean. Everything looked well washed and appropriately cleansed. 

We finished by sharing the Aphrodite cheesecake and a slice of baklava. I'd never had cheesecake with baklava crust but now I'm convinced that's the way it should be served! It was a much appreciated departure from graham cracker crust although it did make it ultra rich - which was not a bad thing!  The cheesecake itself could have been a little smoother/creamier but it was light and not too dense. The slice of baklava was a little dry. I'm not sure what the authentic prep is but I'm used to baklava saturated in honey sugar glaze. The flavor was great though and I like eating it by peeling later after layer off. 

All in all, it was an awesome take away meal. We did without utensils, plates etc because we were just going home to eat it, but everything came well packaged in nice and sturdy containers which is nice for taking away. I am definitely going back for another take away and am going to try some of the other dishes. I can't wait to try the babaganoush, the dolmades, and the falafels, mousaka and spanakopita. They have a trio platter that looks yummy. 

If you want take away that is above your just average Chinese, this is the place. The menu has plenty of variety and take away is served nicely. It's convenient also as they have a separate walk in area just for take away orders. Nicely done, guys!  I'll be back.",izWbFJZWlagRHrFjqX2DIg,0,0,4,vM85QXkNy4deXRmxUPKF4g

My wife and I had just left the rudest gyro place in vegas and decided to try another one.  We find the Market Grille and decide to give her a shot.  We walk in and WOW.  The place was beautiful.  It was lit up but not too bright, music was playing just loud enough to be relaxing and everyone in there looked happy. 

After being blown away on the appearance, we get to the cashier and this girl was just a joy to be around.  Helpful, nice, smiling, happy and we couldn't have been happier.  So after taking our order we sit down.  I get up to go wash my hands and come back and see the waiter already at the table.  I sit down with my wife and this guy Michael or Mike has to be the greatest waiter i've ever met.  I've never laughed so much at a restaurant before.  He was able to describe everything on the menu to a science.  Nicest guy in the world.  

So we ordered 1 lamb and beef Gyro and 1 all lamb Gyro, a family size seasoned fries, and 2 drinks.  Before I could finish filling up my drink cup, Mike, with that huge smile on his face, was bringing us the biggest, most delicious looking fries i've ever seen with some kind of orange looking sauce.  We ask about the sauce and Mike just winks and says ""trust me.""  So we eat the fries and thank god we trusted him because we fell in love with that orange spicy sauce on those fries.  So good.......so good.

So then we get our Gyros and I swear, we took one bite and went into heaven.  I saw my wife's eyes literally rolled back when she took a bite.  She couldn't even finish chewing before she had to tell me how tender and good the meat was.  By  the way, those Gyros were massive.  We utterly destroyed those Gyros.  I can't remember the dessert she had, but it was a yellow looking cake and she finished it so fast, I'm not sure if she tasted it lol.

By far,one of the best experiences at a resteraunt.  I think we payed a little over 20 bucks for everything.  I know the Gyro's were 8 bucks each.  By far, the best 20 dollars you'll ever spend.

4382310,2016-08-07,6,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"This was a logical choice for a nice lunch after hiking at Mount Charleston on a Saturday. The restaurant is conveniently located near the 95 in a very busy shopping center.

The menu has too many good options to the point of being almost overwhelming! It offers wraps, gyros, salads, traditional Greek entrees, appetizers, pizzas, pastas, and soups. Entrees are offered a la carte or as a full entrée with sides for varying appetite levels. The lunch special is a great deal and includes a main item like a gyro, a side, and a drink for $8.50.

I went for the lunch special with a Mediterranean Wrap with Pomegranate Chicken (small upcharge) and Fries (with Greek seasoning). The pomegranate chicken inside of the wrap was delicious and a truly unique offering. The flavor of the overall wrap was great with plenty of vegetables inside. Half of the wrap was plenty of food for me. The Fries were nicely seasoned and tasty as well.

My husband had the Stuffed Green Peppers which were very good. The flavors in the stuffing were delicious and it had plenty of seasoning for flavor. The rice and hummus sides were tasty too. I loved the homemade Greek dressing that came with the salad. 

Our server was very friendly and gave us a nice overview of the menu to help us make our lunch choices. After our meal a manager or owner came by to make sure we had a good experience and enjoyed our food.

My Mamma Mia chicken may have been great but the chicken was so incredibly overcooked, dry, hard little shards on the outside, that it reminded me of the turkey in Griswold Family Christmas.  We nearly sent it back but since our waitress was already wildly efficient but none too friendly, I didn't feel like dealing with it.  The sides were okay (hummus, potatoes), my husband thought his spanakopita was just average but that his pastitio and moussaka were good.  I've had greek food before (not just in American restaurants but in Greeks' homes and in Greece) and this stuff was just spiced so oddly. I'm guessing perhaps it's the geographic influence or...?

4434152,2012-01-07,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I try to be generous when it comes to ""family owned"" businesses, but this one needs a wake-up call before it goes out of business for lack of business. 

I could not wait for the place to open this past October. You can smell what seems to be yummy-ness in the air outside the restaurant and inside. I haven't had the occasion to dine in there but I decided I'd order take-out tonight (Fri 1/6/12) to give it a try. Man was I disappointed.

First, some reviewers have written ""a little pricy"", I have to say IT IS VERY OVERPRICED. I mean, you'd expect to pay too much on the strip (still for a decent portion) but this is a neighborhood spot across from a grocery store. 12 bucks for 1 skimpy meat skewer, 1 ""vegetable"" skewer of sliced tomato & onions, about 1.5 tablespoons of dill sauce, chencey chopped salad with a thimble-full of dressing, and 1/2 of a pita, cut into fourths so that it gives the appearance of more. I mean for $12 you could at least give a whole pita; it's cheap bread. This had to be the skimpiest meal I've had in a long time. I was really hungry and I don't eat a lot of food. But I was still hungry when I finished. I think there might have been enough food for my 3 year old nephew. But any restauranteur should know that if you load up the plate with cheap sides (rice, salad, bread). You've at least given the appearance of a generous portion.

.... but let me continue. 

Second, the quality was really bad. There was a big wad of moistened seasoning mix in my rice that I bit into - yuk! Yet, the rice was dry, dry dry. The salad was too much chopped onion, some chopped cucumber (I'm guessing they chop them small for the dill sauce and save some for the salad), chopped lettuce and a few kalamata olives. The featured skewers (lamb & tomato/onion) were okay but I've had skewers just as good at the kabob place with the same amount of sides for half the price. By the way, the olives were the tastiest part of the entire meal.

Finally, the food temperature was just above warm. I'll give them a little reprieve in this area because they said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. We live just around the corner from the place and we picked it up at 15 minutes. I guess they hadn't planned on packaging to maintain the temperature of the food.

So will I return, nope, not without a half off coupon so that I can get my money's worth. I will continue to search for quality Greek food and know that I can get a least better food at the Mad Greek.",F_PGwNib2ntDfosxfCzciw,4,0,1,BsZvw0yYlPbmmML1SZaWsw

All four of us ordered the Greek Trio Platter - Spanakopita, Pastitsio, and Moussaka, which included a small Greek salad and a tiny cup of hummus on the plate, along with baby-sized pita triangles.  

The spinach pie was sorely lacking in spinach, and didn't even look attractive.  The meat in the other two items was ground so fine that it was like a paste.  I guess it's hard to avoid overcooking the macaroni in the pastitsio, since it's boiled, then baked, then reheated, but this was mush.  The pastitsio and moussaka were sorely lacking in flavor and seasoning, and the hummus was watery and tasteless.  Even the Greek salad, which I'm not a big fan of, since I don't love feta and always find the dressing too sharp for my taste, had a balsamic dressing that was too bland.

They have cute little separate to-go area complete with waiting area. Our food was ready and fresh and was SO good. 

Even better - the price was perfect.

4810364,2016-07-31,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"By far I would have to say this was the worst service I have experienced.  A couple friends of mine and I decided to eat here for lunch. We were asked if we had ever been in before, we replied that all but one of us had not and she had not been here for a very long time. 

We were explained to order off a board and then they would bring the food to us which was fine, the décor was very warm and inviting and did have almost an outdoorsy feel. Overall the interior was great. The guy who took my order was very informative, polite, and had extensive knowledge of their menu. 

I placed my order, then my 1st friend placed hers, and finally my 2nd friend placed hers. We sat down at a table. We were given our appetizer a few minutes after selecting our table, the hummus was ok, almost tasted like they used sour cream in it, not the best I have tasted but it also was not the worst. 

A few minutes later a younger girl came up to our table with 2 plates and just stared at me with a blank smile. It was really kind of uncomfortable. I was starting to think that she either could not speak, forgot how to speak, or was just memorized by our charming good looks, then she finally opened her mouth and I realized that all of the above were incorrect, she just did not really understand life or what was going on in it.  

She passed me my plate, passed the 3rd person hers, she then said ""enjoy"" and my 2nd friend, the one who placed her order 2nd never received her order. She spoke up and asked the dazed girl ""Are you bringing my order soon?"" The girl just looked at us with a glazed over look and flashed a half crooked smile , almost as to say I have no idea what you are talking about-I just work here or maybe am new and do not understand words kind of a smile and walked away. 

After several minutes this mindless girl emerged from what we believe was the bathroom and we tried to flag her down, she walked passed us and up to where the kitchen staff handed out the food. We noticed there were 2 more plates and assumed it was the 2nd friend's meal.  We again were wrong, it was the food of 2 patrons that had came in several minutes after we had sat down.  

Finally we flagged down Maria who was extremely rude and condescending and asked where the order was, we even flashed her the receipt. She question as if we really had even ordered anything for my 2nd friend and looked at her appetizer plate as if to say she already scarfed down her order. When she was informed that we are still waiting she snapped at us and told us that we were not on the same page as her and basically told us to settle down and did not understand what was going on, Apparently confusion runs rampant in this hole and the right hand has no clue what the left hand is doing at all! It is not even aware there is another hand. My 2nd friend asked if she could either have her money back or her order and Maria just stood there like a statue and glared as if my friend spoke to her in a foreign language. Extremely unprofessional, at no point in time did Maria ever say ""I am sorry for the mishap, let me figure out what is going on and I will be right back."" We were made to feel like liars. 

She walked away with the receipt which we requested to be given back and took several minutes at the register, my 2nd friend finally had to walk up and ask what was going on. Maria snapped at her ""WE ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE!!! DO YOU JUST WANT YOUR MONEY BACK?!!"" Well no, she wanted to eat since we only have an hour lunch and the majority of it was wasted trying to figure out where the food was she had paid for, NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!

Maria stated that she had nothing to do with this and she refused to apologize because it was not her mistake!!  I am sorry, but I would assume that the manager IS responsible for her employees and their mistakes! Maria asked ""Would you like an apology, because we are not on the same page!"" My 2nd friend said ""No, the way you are just staring at me with that confused look, makes me feel like you think I stole the food"" Maria just stood there for 10 minutes staring at my friend like an idiot. No refund was offered, but my friend was finally provided her order but was made to stand at the food line and had to walk her food over to our table. 

Upon leaving we asked for Maria's managers name and she was in shock like we would have the nerve to ask for this and again NEVER apologized for the crappy service. The best part is when she actually told us to have a nice day! I am sorry that I had actually gave a 20% tip at the beginning right after I placed my order.

The ""Beef/Lamb"" Gyro sucked, was the worst I have ever tasted, I would not recommend this to an enemy and the service sucks! Maria should not be dealing with the public at all.",r0rbHEB7kWJKhzweCOeyeQ,1,0,1,gKDKI6dpulGT2_WikSgzHg

Yes it was THAT good! 

I had a small cup of their mushroom and pumpkin soup. Delicious and very unique flavors. If you love all things Thanksgiving, you'll enjoy this soup. I probably could've eaten it for dessert. 

My lunch special was chicken and veggie skewers and I opted to upgrade my salad to the Village salad (for $1.50) cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, feta and fresh herbs which gave the salad a bright flavor. 

I appreciated that the chicken and veggies had their own skewers as cooking times a different for those foods. I felt like this allowed for moist chicken and a good char on the veggies. 

Who can resist homemade baklava?!?!!!!

I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that comments on the poor taste of people in North Las Vegas.  How you can give this place anything over 4 stars is just beyond silly.  The great thing about this place is that it fills a niche that is totally unfilled in the area.  The food is generally decent, even if a little over priced.  The portions are generous depending on what you get.  Be sure to order extra tzatziki sauce for your gyro, as they are very stingy with it here.  The most disappointing part of this place is the atmosphere.  From the outside, it looked like a very nice, perhaps even romantic atmosphere, akin to Macaroni Grill or even the Olive Garden.  The minute I walked in, all of those expectations were crushed.  The environment is much more laid back and cheap than what it seems from the outside. It has an almost fast food feel.  The best thing that I can compare it to is Fazoli's Italian fast food chain for those of you that have been there.

BUT, it has been three times now and I've asked for no onions in my wrap and they put onions in my wrap!  The first time, the OWNER told me I must have mistaken them for the red cabbage.  I am 1000% confident I did not mistake them (I think I can tell when my throat starts to feel tingly).  Plus, I frequently use red cabbage in my own cooking.  The owner still made us pay for the meal.  

The most recent time was a take-out order.  I must have said 10 or 20 times ""no raw onions"" in either of the two orders, and asked several, ""are you sure there are no raw onions?"" before I left.  As soon as I got home, I took a giant bite and behold- there were onions in both orders.  

Further.  Before you leave the take-out area, they quickly open the box to make sure the order is correct.  The server who opened the box saw that one of the wraps looked like it had fallen on the ground and was no longer a wrap.  Yet, he closed the box again as if I was going to take it.  They also forgot multiple things on my order and I ended up waiting even longer for the order to be refilled (45 minutes).",OS5p_5bdHXKCcN7ZEK2TXQ,1,0,1,7x1Fwr_i8OLHSFtUlcQnsQ

One Fri evening in mid-August, coming back after hiking on Mt. Charleston one Fri evening, my wife and I were hungry and thirsty. A quick check with Yelp showed a Greek restaurant nearby Durango off I-95. So, we happily rushed into Market Grill Greek Café for beers and dinner!

After settling down with a couple of Greek beers, (&3.5@, NOT BAD!), we began to notice something in the restaurant:

- It's spacious with high ceilings; has an airly, clean and comfortable decor; has a nice patio...

- Its TV continuously shows pics of theirGreek dishes, deserts, etc, and how they are prepared. It seems to us that this is the ONLY hint that Market Grill Café is a Greek restaurant. We did hear ""Oopa!"" a few times, but did not see any flaming cheese anywhere?

FOOD:
- We followed a couple ofYelpy recommendations and ordered the popular ""Chicken Parmegranate,"" ""Chicken Gyro"", anda ""Greek Salad"". The Greek salad was pretty tasty with lots of black olives; but the lettuce was too finely chopped. The Chicken Parmegranate was too bland, and the chicken not firm; Chicken Gyro needed salt and pepper to boost the taste. The dishes were not how we remembered as Greek cuisine would taste like as those served in Greek restaurants in Detroit, Chicago.... Well, perhaps, the regular Greek chef was not on duty that evening?

SERVICE:
- Our waitress was attentive and and helpful. [GOOD!] But, we did notice a couple of times when customers were waiting by the hostess station, but there was no hostess and the restaurant people just walked by WITHOUT greeting them, leaving them standing for a while! No one was busy at the time, as the place was pretty EMPTY! This is not a good practice! [BAD!] I was surprised that the customers did not turn around and leave the place!

HAPPY HOUR (3-6)
- $1 off drinks and appetizers. We were too late for the happy hour that evening.

5048607,2013-02-20,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I think the best way to describe this place is consistent, fresh and clean eating. Nothing here is overly greasy, everything feels light enough that this isn't your guilty meal spot. If you have dietary restrictions or are gluten free, vegan, etc, they are very accommodating. There aren't many places up here I would say you could eat fresh, and this is a nice solitude. 

This used to be in the Centennial shopping in a small space, but they've upgraded to a sit down service restaurant just up the road. I much prefer it here since you're not bumping chairs with the table behind you. I didn't mind getting up to get my own drink and all before, but now they have servers here which makes sense for the space.

I have tried a few things on the menu, but I normally get the same things. With entrees you can go a la carte with just rice or a combo has with salad, pita and tzatziki or hummus. Their rice is seasoned and soft, the hummus is more liquidy and plainer than I like but I do like their tzatziki. Pomegranate chicken is always cooked right and juicy. Greek Trio has moussaka, patstitsio, spanakopita. I think overall those are decent versions, but moussaka is my favorite of the 3.Gyro plate/Vasilios plate gyros are soft and never dried out, comes with rice, salad, pita, tzatziki and hummus already. Gyro pizza is different, but good! Think of it as like a open faced gyro sandwich with tomato sauce as a base.  Combination platter is a appetizer but makes for a good vegetarian meal too with hummus, babaganoush, salad, lots of pita, and some falafel. I think their falafel here is just okay, they are sort've dense when I prefer a fluffier and moist inside.

Their cheesecake here is surprisingly good. They do a baklava crust instead of graham cracker so that little bit does it over the top. I get the pumpkin cheesecake usually. Baklava is decent, but not my favorite in town. 

People who work here are pretty friendly and generally attentive. It's a  family owned business and I like to support our locals.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,2,5,Bbe4iLgFH0TAmGdlzvBrDA

It has a great smell in the restaurant, like they just baked all the desserts and it smells like heaven!

SERVICE: 5 - The service was great! the server was really nice and personable! she was patient and very attentive to our needs.

FOOD: 4 - I like my veggies and tried the spanakopita, which is baked well and tastes great! they put their salad as a side in most dishes, and I love it!!! 

Their Aphrodite's cheesecake is way improved! it's not as sweet anymore and I love it!! 

The food still has that fast food feel to it, I wish it had a more homemade taste! The cheesecake is perfect though!

I personally feel like they're whitewashing authentic Greek flavors to Americanize their food. Big mistake! Not sure what's in the Basmati rice but it's not Greek nor is it Indian. It's just full of herbs...no lemon flavor at all. And for the price the servings should be Greek size not one tiny piece of Spanikopita, dry rice, and a head of lettuce which the core should be removed first.

My picky friend wouldn't let me order a drink until she was absolutely certain she wanted to eat there. Lol. I assured her the pomegranate chicken was got good reviews here so she would be safe. She ordered that in a lunch combo. I ordered the gyro and salad lunch combo. The waitress was very patient through my friend's questioning of the ingredients she would be getting. Can I just say the service here is amazing. My drink never went empty during a packed lunch. My friend loved her moist grilled chicken. What a relief! My gyro was moist as well and the tzatiki sauce packed a savory punch. My only gripe is more of personal preference. I like the crispy pieces of gyro meat, salty and crunchy. The gyro meat here is like a moist slice of freshly cooked gyro meatloaf. It's delicious nonetheless but I'm big on texture and I missed that in their gyro.  The baklava was spiced generously and the sweet taste wasn't overwhelming the nutty cinnamon notes.

Plus they use fresh ingredients with lots of herbs and spices for flavor. It's one of my go to take out spots.",ChkQ2jkLKScO8WYXZ2lBFA,0,0,5,e6EH13w3RBUycYm5ViuwHg
5464766,2018-05-07,0,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"My wife and I have been going to the Durango location for years now. There are several reasons that we keep coming back.

First the staff, a family owned and operated business, they do a great job in ensuring you are taking good care of. I feel that once the team gets to know you, they basically know what your regulars are and will ask ""your regular""? The team is always checking on you and ensuring small things like ensuring you drink glass is never empty, asking if your food is prepared correctly all while able to have conversations. 

The food is always great. We have had several different dishes from pasta, steak and chicken and have never been disappointed. Food is prepared fresh and is always brought out hot. I feel the prices for the food are good and honestly we are always bring home leftovers. I would recommend the Gyros, they are awesome and remind me of my trip to Santorini. 

The store recently went thru a renovation, and thou I miss the pictures of Santorini (Sorry Joe), they  did a great job updating the restaurant giving it a warm inviting feeling . What I think is unique is they have videos playing of highlights of the activities the restaurant is involved with. 

If you on the fence about trying, I would highly recommend this local gem.",nPDFmoDt6hKkb7TbDHLGVQ,0,1,5,GNSeRDuI_9IhIvUfPLbd8g

5498567,2013-07-29,1,qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,"I'm a little embarrassed I have passed by but never noticed this place until a couple of weeks ago. Now last night I went here on a date night. I love the decor of the place. They try to do a modern Greek. The tables even have pictures under the glass I assume of Greece.

Now to the food. They have a Trio platter which is perfect so I can try 3 dishes most greek/med food places do. The Spanakopita was good. It consisted of spinach, feta & romano cheese, layered & baked in a buttery filo pastry. I love the flaky crust. The Mousaka was just like I have had at so many places which isn't a bad thing as it tasted great. It consisted of ground beef, eggplant & potato casserole, baked in tomato sauce cheese. Topped with a cream and grated cheese sauce. The Pastitsio which I had never had before was macaroni pie, baked with ground beef & tomato sauce with some cinnamon & nutmeg. It was really good. I got the entree so I had a Greek salad with it as well and it was fresh. The herb rice had a nice spice flavor to it. I'm not a hummus fan but boy this hummus was good with the fresh pita bread.

For dessert we decided on the Dolce Nannie which is 3 of their desserts. We chose the Canoli, Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake, Stellas Honey Cake. Canoli was like any canoli and that's not bad because it was good. The winners were the pumpkin baklava cheesecake and stellas honey cake. Perfect sweetness!

Service was excellent. The waitress seemed to know the perfect time to show up and ask to fill our drinks. She even offered to go boxes for the little leftovers my girlfriend had.

I give Market Grille Cafe 4 stars for such a great experience. Can't wait to go back.",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,1,1,4,rYKpRAh2FxHiXdzerlNl_A

The only thing I've enjoyed here was the hummus trio w/ pita bread. The offer some pastas, gyros, etc. The items were simply ok. Nothing above and beyond what we've tasted in the past from other Greek restaurants.

But this place has peeved me each time, yet, I still return because the pita and lemon cilantro hummus is my addiction and it offers such a great lunch menu. It definitely beats having to drive a way for Mediterranean food and I always double thumbs up for that! 

We used to eat here when they were back at the centennial shopping center area, and at the time I was not as impressed. However, I can honestly say they have greatly improved. Their pomegranate chicken is always tender and juicy. Although, I don't specifically order that for myself...I always can't help but to take a bite off my kids plate. 

Their veggies are always so fresh and crisp so I appreciate that especially because I'll order a wrap or gyro. Their gyros are usually stuffed as I find myself struggling to monster bite into it. Lol. Their Platos potatoes seem to be just the frozen store.bought fries...but that's okay because they season it well and the dip that comes with it is rather simple.but good! 

My only gripe that leaves me.annoyed is for the most part...service is very slow especially during lunch time. My husband works nearby so we like having lunch dates here and I have to go there first then do the text of I just ordered come.on up. We have gone for dinner and I was pretty irked at how.slow and seemingly neglectful the waitress was. She apologized because she had a lot of tables, but I mean...we were there before it got chaotic. From the look on everyone else's faces, I'm sure they were thinking the same thing. It's cool...I get it.

Other than that...yeah, good place to get your Mediterranean fix without doing the journey somewhere else! Definitely recommend! Kid and stroller friendly!

Since it was beautiful outside and the sun was going down, we elected to sit outside.  Despite the parking lot being right beyond the gate, the atmosphere was still nice.  Our waiter was attentive the entire night, but I wasn't very happy with management when the misters came on as the sun went down, and they balked at turning them off even though there was only one other patron outside who was fine with them being turned off.  

Anyway, the food was mixed for us.  The Mediterranean Medley app was pretty good overall; unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed the Dolmades.  As for the main courses, my wife had the gyro, which she enjoyed more than other places, but she felt the side rice was bland.  I really was expecting more from the lamb roast cabernet; it was just alright for me.  However, the side potatoes were excellent.

My only issue I had was with the staff, walked in, and guess they asume everyone's been there at one point or another.  Was directed to the take out area  after standing in the doorway looking puzzled for about 3-4 minutes.  Got there, sign on the wall says ""ring bell for service"".   OK.....this is a cafe, not a hotel, but alright.  Rang the bell....and nobody shows up after another 1-2 minutes, I ring it again, feeling a bit silly now.  I walked back out, and an older woman asked if I needed help and I said yea, I do, I've been ringing your bell for 5 minutes in the back and haven't seen anybody and I have $40 worth of food hanging out in your kitchen.  They brought out the food, checked it all before baging it up and even gave me a coupon for next time, which was nice, as I wasn't really mad about the situation, just annoyed that I was directed by the teenagers they have working as their cashiers but nobody had the motivation to go to the back and see what I wanted until I came back out and publicly and loudly asked for it.",gvC9vVIQbTSPOpXvtiUbUg,0,0,3,ywv-wjRweuxs_eyOuwVETQ

The restaurant interior is warm and welcoming. Everyone is friendly and this made me want to eat her even more. My friend discovered this place a while back and couldn't stop talking about how fresh and yummy the food was so I made her take me!  We started off our dinner with the Saganaki cheese appetizer. Oh my! This was so creamy and rich tasting. I could have easily enjoyed this with a salad and been satisfied but it was Friday night, just got paid so we proceeded to enjoy ourselves. Next came my entree which was the Mamma Mia chicken, goat cheese with a fig preserve and pistachios. Each bite of this dish literally melted in my mouth. I would have never thought to mix these ingredients together, but this dish was absolutely scrumptious. My friend enjoyed the Pomegranate Chicken which was marinated in pomegranate juices and herbs. Very flavorful!  The service was superb and our server was outgoing and bubbly. Whatever we needed, she had it brought out immediately. The owner made a point of coming over and asking me if I enjoyed my meal and had a genuine interest in what I had to say. She then gave me a card for a 15% discount on my next visit, which believe me there will be a second, third and quite possibly I could become a regular here. There are so many other dishes that I want to try and I did not get an opportunity to taste dessert. In addition to the food, they have a nice wine list to compliment your entree' which I took advantage of since red wine always makes you feel fine!

Growing up with homemade moussaka, pastitsio, pomegranate chicken, pita, hummus, spanakopita, dolmades & kourabiedes, etc etc etc means that I'm well versed in Greek & Mediterranean cooking. I can cook everything on this menu, but sometimes I don't have 3 hours to devote to prepping and making giant moussaka. Sometimes I just want to get Greek food (that isn't a Kronos gyro) instead of making it myself. 

I've been to this MGC a handful of times, including once with my sister and once with Brian P.

The prices are steep for the portions provided. The sampler platter is quite small for the price. They have a happy hour, but I have not been to it here. 

Meals are pita & pilaf heavy, which makes me wonder why the entrees are so steep. The pomegranate chicken is dry and flavorless. The saganaki isn't remotely tangy.

Service is slow, even when the place is nearly empty. Maybe it's because the servers are teens or because they want to draw out the meals. I don't know, but after my last visit with my sister, we agreed that there was no point in a return visit.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,2,3,qizErBIEpZQ1WZFddjJOMg

Totaling almost an hour wait taking up her whole lunch break! Because we love their food we decided to give them a couple more chances. On another occasion my co worker waited 15 minutes for premade hummus and carrots. The final straw was when we called to place an order for pick up and my coworker wanted the chicken and veggie skewers lunch special with a salmon kabob on the side. The young girl took the order over the phone and 25 min later we go to pick it up. She then tells my co worker the total was $25. She had charged her for a lunch special and a salmon kabob (full price) my co worker (she was hungry) explained she only wanted the kabob not the sides to which the young girl replied ""oh you have to ask for it ala cart, but I'll remember that for next time"".

I told the restaurant & my wife we will go there every time we come to Vegas & that's a promise!!! Oh, I NEVER write reviews! L.A.Y.",PTZB-PBrwRn2c0pQ0xclYg,0,0,4,2RkS83hdJoUNjCjTjIB3kg

My friend and I happened to make it here during happy hour, and the food, service, and atmosphere were all as great as I'd heard. I'm not at all an expert on Greek/Mediterranean food, so I can't speak to its authenticity, but my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed everything we tried. We also each had plenty of leftovers! Believe the hype - this place has delicious food with great service.",g_AhgIEyx7J3NVsOPoalhA,1,0,4,BAEEIREXHzUgu3i1jHOzQA

I may not get the most ""authentic"" of Greek food when I'm here. My meal usually consist if the chicken skewers, but those skewers are delicious. The rice and salad that goes along with the dish is perfection. Love it! I've tried the gyros among other before and all of it was good. Give this place a shot if you haven't. The service is really well and every time I go the wait staff is very nice and accommodating.",VsMwT9BTa445fN01-VQpMw,1,0,5,5zfbd8LOcSVfkmQAzpNdCA

I was put onto Market Fresh from a friend who would show up to work with leftovers. He preferred market fresh over the alternative ""to-go"" locations conveniently located on the Durango/Centennial Las Vegas drive-by.

Greek and Mediterranean style cuisine, family owned and operated with a knack for adding a flavorful twist to some well-known, basic recipes. My first meal, a chicken salad, was superb and left me with a twitch in my pallet for more. I intend on making this a frequent stop as I also venture to stay active and healthy!",EApIYB1lMaH-r2quP42vTA,0,0,5,yJdPki9uTgM5w5iVrt39pg

Rice was dry and old, spanakopita was awful, salmon too fishey, the only thing I finished was the tabouli salad.
