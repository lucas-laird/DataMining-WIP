2311220,2010-05-06,0,JrohSmutzhdJ5QGRMtaojg,The best subway I've eaten at. Really soft delicious bread. And its pretty cheap compared to other places to eat at on the strip. Plus they are open 24/7. So that even better,KVbEM5bNY6M8mNR_cYb98Q,1,0,5,zRdkfr1-qwef4iO6z-RK5A
2801705,2018-04-02,0,JrohSmutzhdJ5QGRMtaojg,The staff is friendly and nice but sloppy and kind of cheap with the condiments. Normally when I go and ask for pickles and pepperchinis I get half a handful and I don't get charged extra for it. I got 3 pickles and 4 peppers on a foot long. I wasn't happy but it was too late. This experience has taught me not to come to the strip at 1 am for food. Overpriced and poorly prepared.,K1LiUGtQ-b-2SD-A5gNHDw,0,0,1,kIlIyC8s4BdmOnqyCQy_Yw

 Coke machine was out of Coke but I wasn't about to wait an hour while they refilled it.

Overall, a poor Subway.",_YXNbr4PPvEaGdrfjmzdiQ,1,1,2,VAd91Z44ty6RBBUHbBwMig

Giving it two stars only because the sandwhich was good but customer service i feel what makes or breaks you.",su73NXehynv7bmP9F_WxVQ,1,0,2,ijBnH9yodzQKVhh-RzoKiA

It's what subway is; same deals, same prices and same taste. Everything met my expectations, and it was all really good. No free water is unfortunate; that's about as negative as it gets! Everything's fresh and nice.",blkmegIkRE-DkLzqkop2nw,0,0,4,iXSSH-IcGHg2Zsm0TFfiFg
5190104,2015-11-05,1,JrohSmutzhdJ5QGRMtaojg,"Subway is where I go when I am tired of the usual offerings found on the strip. lt's located in the Monte Carlo casino and open 24 hours a day.

The food isn't anything special, but it is fresh which is a nice change of pace .I've always found the service to be adequate and quick.",DH33jk6JCu18bDttLCalRw,1,1,3,-xsozC_p0nr-6-_VNTEBmQ
5790077,2016-02-05,0,JrohSmutzhdJ5QGRMtaojg,"Located inside the Monte Carlo's Food Court, it's among one of a few familiar choices for restaurants. Prices are higher than normal, of course we're in Vegas and in a food court, so it's expected. But to make your sandwich a meal? Whoa!!!! Take an average of $6.75 for a 6"" sandwich, then ADD $3-$3.50 for soda and chips. You've got yourself a $10 Subway meal! Wow! The food is nothing really special. The same as any other subway in America. I would return here only if I had to.

-1 Star for the prices 
-1 Star for bland service. But why be surprised about this, right?

3-Stars ""A-OK"" just because my experience was just okay.",7nEnXfmm3ICIJtGtFAMMuQ,0,0,3,-dQG4FWWcIftEErrM-tIWw
