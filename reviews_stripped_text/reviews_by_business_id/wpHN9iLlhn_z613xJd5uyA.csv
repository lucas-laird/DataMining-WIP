212250,2014-07-13,1,wpHN9iLlhn_z613xJd5uyA,Worst service ever in my life. Employees are under the influence while working. Today I had my friend go to subway and I wrote down what I wanted on a piece of paper...the subway worker messed my order up TWICE on a simple order. I will never go here again.,6izlo1fSb__7x9GRPgC5CQ,0,0,1,v7rJUV-G9CW3cAhWkAmBQA

We wanted to grab a quick bite in the area to take to the drive-in with us and were trying to get something a little healthier than the typical fast food options. Service was basic and quick. We'll probably be back when we come to the drive-in again.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,3,RUBBwks_82_7Nl6qQh2-Qg
