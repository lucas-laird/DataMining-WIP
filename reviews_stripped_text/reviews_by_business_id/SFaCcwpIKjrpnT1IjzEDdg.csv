Never got any drink refills. Couldn't get the check. Food was not that good. The cooks were either the first Mexican kosher people I have ever met or not kosher. Rice was plain tasteless, served with chopped tomatoes and cucumbers on the side, chicken schnitzel had zero spices in the bread crumbs, hummus had too much Tahiti in it not enough garbanzo beans, falafel undercooked in the middle, hamburger was well done instead of medium. Honestly we wouldnt go back. This is not good Jewish food I have tasted better anywhere. Don't waste your time. Our bill $78.00 overpriced not worth it. Very disappointed.

It's been 2 hours and I'm not thirsty.  Good sign that its not overly salted! The hamburger hit the spot -hot off the grill and realized  how much I craved some meat since I last had. The hommous shwarma plate was also very good and the Harissa - both green and red added perfect heat. The grilled tomatoes and onions was a big hit for my husband and I.  We eat Israeli grill very often and Jerusalem Grill in Vegas rates very high. We even took another sandwich for the plane and it s been smelling so good since we left the restaurant.

309003,2014-12-26,0,SFaCcwpIKjrpnT1IjzEDdg,"The pita was very good and the hummus was good. 
Other than that, the food was not good or improperly prepared. The Israeli Salad was not what I am used to. It was only diced cucumber with very little tomato without any olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper to dress it. The lentil soup lacked flavor. The couscous was soggy and bland. The rice was crunchy. The falafel was burned. The French fries were cold. The chicken was OK, but not what we expected. Overall, the food was extremely bland. I make better Israeli salad (which is not difficult to prepare) and hummus at home and will never return. I was extremely disappointed and hoped the food would rival at the food of my home.
Cleanliness was an issue as we observed at the restaurant in addition to the food. There were many filthy things we saw. I had to visit the washroom after using the salt and papper shaker because it was so disgusting I could feel the grime and see yellow and brown left on the handles from patrons before me. After that I was done. Grossed out. And by the way, the washroom was not clean. We were afraid of getting food poisoning or something else because of the cleanliness issues and because some of the food was not up to the proper temperature.
The other problem I had with the place was the service. The service was extremely slow. Our server was very nice, but it took almost 20 minutes just to get drinks. We waited about 40 minutes or so for our food after we ordered.

The average plate is around $20 and a kids burger is a whopping $12! A kosher steak at a fancy restaraunt is about $30 to $40 and this place is not that, although it is clean and pleasant. However the food is good and the staff is nice, so if you got money to burn or have no choice, its fine. However, I would not recommend shabbat takeout. They charge $44 a person and its a complete ripoff. We expected nice portions of food and got very little in return. Very dissapointing. The food was also very different in taste compared to eating in the restaraunt, not very good and again the portions were tiny.

739490,2015-04-25,0,SFaCcwpIKjrpnT1IjzEDdg,"3.5*, really, but 3* just felt low.

SE corner of Decatur and Trop

Had a nice falafel pita that took less than 5 minutes for them to make (ordered in store for takeout). The whole experience feels very Israeli, from the Hebrew being spoken in the store to the attitude (which was a combo of direct to the point of being abrupt, immensely friendly, and charming to the point that you feel like they're somehow getting over on you -- which if you've ever been to Israel, you know what I mean).

The schug (Note 1: this is spicy chili paste, otherwise known as harif or harissa. Note 2: remember that the 'ch' is as in challah, so this is 'sss-ch-oog', not 'shoog' as it would be in German) is intense, so I'd recommend on the side (and I like spicy food).

The veggies, pickled and otherwise, in the pita were solid, and if you want hummus in your pita, you should ask for tahini on the side, as the dab of hummus you get in the pita is quite small.

Overall super tasty though, and i'll update after trying the shawarma.",6arPqqPM-4O_OpT_Gf8agA,1,0,4,KXiuTotDRlJzNVhcDIeBDQ

However, I explained to him how it was already ate the food and at this point there was nothing to be done. Did offer to take it off the bill but that wasn't my point, nor what I wanted.

Getting seated was an experience, they tried to send us to their uncrowded dairy restaurant in the same mall.  

They do not have a liquor licence, but if you want wine, there is a liquor store in the same mall that carries kosher wines.  And they will cork for you for free at the restaurant.  

I would have rated them 4 stars, but they lose 2 stars since one of their employees stole my credit card.  After eating there,  I returned to my hotel and discovered $4000 in Skype charges were on made on my Amex at 11:30 that evening - probably after the crook got off work.

1340232,2018-02-12,1,SFaCcwpIKjrpnT1IjzEDdg,"One thing I learn about Kosher food is that it is exceedingly pricey. And it makes me wonder why is kosher meat way more expensive than non-kosher meat. While dining in, I had an opportunity to speak to the manager Aviva and learn a great deal about how to distinguish Kosher meat while also gaining some knowledge about Parve food. 

The reason why kosher meat is more expensive is that in Jewish Law, they follow specific criteria how an animal is slaughtered. In order for the meat to be kosher, the animal must be healthy, must not have any disease, punctured wounds, or broken bones. This information in itself gave me assurance that the meat I'm consuming is from a healthy animal. 

Next I ask what is it that makes Parve food so different. In Jewish Law, they cannot cook or consume meat together with dairy. However with Parve food, since it has no dairy and no meat, it can be eaten with either meat or dairy. It is a little confusing to understand, but I can see why it is important to consume good quality and clean food.

I begin my order with a Limonana Slushie ($5) which is a house blended lemonade with fresh mint leaves, and this drink taste light and it's so refreshing. I went for the Matzaball Soup ($9) which is a Jewish soup dumpling made from a mixture of matzah meal, eggs, water, and oil. The soup is serve hot and it comes with two homemade Matzaballs that are slow cooked in a savory chicken broth, and it has soft vegetables like carrots, onions, red bell pepper, zucchini, celery, and pumpkin. I like the soup and I can taste the flavor, I just wish I had more than two Matzaballs. 

For entr√©e, I chose the Hummus & Shawarma ($15) which is serve with thin strips of slow roasted chicken, Jerusalem hummus, and two freshly baked pita bread. The pita bread is thick and it's sourced from a vendor that makes real pita bread like in Jerusalem. The strips of chicken are tender and well-seasoned. The Jerusalem hummus has a pronounce taste of tahini flavor and it's garnish with cooked chickpeas, onions, bell pepper, paprika, and parsley. I like the hummus, it is very filling especially when it's eaten with pita bread. I wanted to save room for dessert so I had the rest of my meal packed to-go. 

Now there isn't a dessert list on the menu, it's something you would have to ask and inquire what they have available. I chose Parve Triple Chocolate Fudge Cake ($12) and given how there is no dairy, the cake does taste very light but I wish they had put more chocolate flavor to give this dessert a little more oomph. The interior restaurant looks modern and high end, there is good music in the background, they have TV for entertainment, and the service is exceptionally friendly. One important tip is if you are a local resident, you get a local discount on your meal.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,3,2,4,lvHfo-ekPvlxXPUnm593hg

1448109,2014-10-13,5,SFaCcwpIKjrpnT1IjzEDdg,"Everything on the menu except for the sandwiches is overpriced. And the service needs a serious upgrade. For years, the consistency has been the careless staff and quite frankly, the food isn't good enough for me to put up with it more than a few times a year.

Try to call in your take out order, but good luck getting them to pick up the phone.
When you enter, if there's anyone else waiting, beware that you'll probably get ignored by all four employees who will inexplicably assume you are with the other customer- even though you guys walked in separately, minutes apart, and look nothing alike.

Eventually you'll ask someone if you can place an order for takeout, and they'll act irritated that they have to give you a menu. They'll also give you the dinner-only menu that doesn't include the sandwiches, you'll have to ask again for it.

When you finally get to this point, your pita sandwich can be made with falafel, shwarma, koobideh, or a couple other things. The first two are your best bet. Be aware that upgrading your wrapping to laffa will be an extra $2.50. 
$10 and a side of fries is decent for the wrap, which is packed with tahini, cabbage, Israeli salad, and the world's tiniest dab of hummus, but it's hella filling and can easily be your main meal of the day even without the fries.

If you dine in, the all-you-can-eat salad for $3, added on to your meal, is a great deal...but be sure you will actually have room for it. And as others have said, the entire table needs to order it for you to be able to partake- if you're with more than one other person, it likely isn't worth it.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,3,3,Hh_6Ce1RIxCZ7MEO-RJ7gw

The food was palatable, but as others have noted, it was quite bland. I ordered the schnitzel with couscous and Israeli salad.  For a $22 entree, the couscous was bland, with diced vegetables on top, the salad was pretty dry, but the schnitzel itself was good.  Others in our party also remarked that soups and falafels that they had were good, but bland.

Our biggest issue with our dining experience was our server. He visited our table 3 times in short succession while we were still deciding on our choices, but then had to be flagged down whenever we needed something. Drinks? Ask for straws. Appetizers delivered?  Ask for plates. Then, he was scarce for the rest of our meal, often seen busily chatting with other staff off in a corner.

For dessert, I ordered a Turkish coffee and tiramisu. $7 for a tiny serving of mostly whipped topping.

This by far is one of my favorites. There is always a sense of consistency here with the service and the food. The stag is always friendly and the food is always delicious. 

I had some friends visiting from out of town this last weekend for the ASD show and we decided to come on in for a bite.

Needless to say it was extremely busy as most of the kosher restaurants were. But as usual the service was courteous and as speedy as they could be.

This time around we went with some of the smaller plates and tapas and then moved on to sharing a few of the entrees.

We went with the shawarma tacos and the sliders. I give them both a solid 4/5. They mix very traditional Mediterranean flavors with new and eclectic tastes to give a spin on something old. Have to love the innovation of the place. 

We decided to go ahead and get a couple of the mix grill platters which is a must have when you come here. A variation of their best selling skewers both beef and chicken. We definitely give them a 5/5.

Overall another magnificent experience. And everyone agreed this is the best kosher spot in Vegas for friendly service, a clean environment and a delicacy of flavor.",zIj-0Aa0bLomrCIsveQ8PA,0,1,5,fFm-8h7girm5HLINQnW1ng

Positives:
Shakshuka was pretty good even though it was a bit salty. The warm pita was excellent. 
Negatives:
Shawarma was one of the priciest and one of the worst we have had. It's not made traditionally on the stacks and it was very chewy and not fresh at all. Our salad didn't even have a dressing on them. Just some iceberg lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and onions. Seasoned fries was clearly old. To top it off when we mentioned these to the waitress she insisted that the shawarma is really good and no one has ever had problems with it. I find that very hard to believe. 
It is really unfortunate that a place that used to be a gem as far as kosher food in Vegas has turned into such low quality place.  The only reason why this doesn't have a lower score is because of the pita and shakshuka.",jKzjJ-lBZj4ntuKVnAKaFw,0,0,3,TXarCCfVsiSFm4cbFnPKhg

It was on a cutting board with a small salad next to it. Looked very nice and presentable. My bf started eating and i notice him cutting SO MUCH fat off of the steak. Literally more than half of the steak was fat. The waiter came by to see how everything was and my bf mentioned this wasnt a lean steak at all, the waiter looked like he didnt know what to say and said something like like oh it has a little fat. Uh no, it had a lot of fat. He went to the back to speak to someone and then just left us hanging. 

My salmon was just OK. I was expecting a grilled or baked piece of salmon and my fries and tabbouleh on the plate, but instead my salmon was 2 thin slivers of salmon cooked with a bunch of crap around it. There was a tomato, chick peas, green leafs of some sort. It looked as if the salmon was cooked in some sort of stew. My fries were wet and soggy from whatever was on the salmon. The salmon was bland, no taste. I only ate it because i was hungry. The tabbouleh was soooo tiny, omg. It was like 1 table spoon of tabbouleh which is disappointing cause i love tabbouleh. Anyways their tabbouleh was dry as hell and not that great. Its weird because when i ordered my meal the waiter asked me if i wanted my salmon on top of the tabbouleh... I would have died if my tabbouleh has the stew and chick peas from the salmon on it.

Once we flagged down the waiter and asked him for the check, he goes to get it and comes back to tell us hes taking 10% off the cost of the steak which was a joke. He acted like he was doing us a favor. It was like $6 or $7 our $80+ bill. This restaurant could have done a lot to make it right but they chose not to. 6 or 7 dollars off of my bill is an insult. You could have offered us something else off of the menu, you could have apologized for misinforming us about the steak and basically lying to us just to order the most expensive thing on the menu.Anything would have been better than acting like you were not at fault. Does the owner of this restaurant care that people are spending money like this at his establishment and then leaving hungry? We will never come back.

They have a good selection of a steak house and felafel house combined. Only issue was the prices are very high compared to any other kosher establishment. Also, they automatically add the tip in the bill, which I did not like. For example, I had to pay $3 for a side of babaganoush, should have been free of you ask me. Either way, I would probably return since there is no where else to eat in Vegas.",1MPTSDMljj5HzyV2pVfqaw,0,0,5,aLgq2dEksakhc98Y3N96EQ

Stopped in on a week day for dinner with a friend of mine. I knew about this place because my old coworker's husband is the one in the back who ensures all products are kosher. Otherwise, would be very difficult to spot along busy Decatur/Flamingo intersection. 

I got the salad w/ chimichurri steak on it, which ended up costing me $24 (I knew kosher food will be more expensive but geesh!). Friend got the shashuka w/ pita bread which she claimed was good. Service was a little slow, and we later came to find out that our waitress was the manager. She had some good recommendations and was pretty straight forward.

Ambiance is a little strange. It had potential of being a nice restaurant until they added the TV w/ sports. Lots of seating outside, w/ pretty string lights, but I would expect service to be even slower sitting out there.

All in all, good food but pretty pricey w/ slow service.",iOok30z2H8XVnaMeCjgqCQ,0,0,3,-ZGa4PH-KDE59T1smIM4fQ

We started with excellent hummus and warm pita along with a deep fried beef roll. It had a name but I cannot recall what it is.

On the recommendation of our waiter, I ordered the Jerusalem Grill which was a combination of chicken shawarma and beef kabobs. I ordered the Israeli salad and couscous as my sides.  The servings were generous and delicious.

Service was attentive but I had to request refills of my beverage two to three times.

The enjoyment of the evening was with the conversation I had with my friends but the Jerusalem Grill gave us a delicious meal and informal setting in which to visit.

Without trying to denigrate either of the other two restaurants, I will say that this was universally decided as our second best meal of the three - and it was $100 for the 4 of us instead of $300 or $400 of the two previous nights!
We all got their bottomless salad plates - pretty funny to call it bottomless since there about 12 of them and there is little to no way we could eat more than one, even though we did try. We also had the schwarma (amazing), the falafel (very good), and the schnitzel (eh).

Looking back.... So long story short is I got chicken and rice with pita and cucumber salad. All included with meal. 25 and change.

4894658,2012-08-10,3,SFaCcwpIKjrpnT1IjzEDdg,"The place was mobbed, loud, very warm and the tables were so tight my son was practically rubbing elbows with strangers.  We made the best of it by introducing ourselves to everyone around us.  There were 3 servers for 100 customers.   Be prepared to wait.  

We were told the difference between theHamburger entree and the children's hamburger is the following:
The adult hamburger is half a pound, while the kids hamburger is a quarter of. A pound.  Seems fairly reasonable right?!  We laughed hysterically when the kids opened their buns and discovered literally half a hamburger patty.  How challenging is it to mold 1/4 pound patties?!  Apparently they simply cut the 1/2 pound adult--size hamburgers for the kids.  Strange, but tasty.

They claim the food comes with French fries --- VERY small portions.... We counted approximately 18 fries per customer.  perhaps a small handful--- not a true restaurant size portion.

The best bargain/special at the Jerusalem Grill is the unlimited salad plate for an additional 3.99 per person, two person minimum.  Sounds pretty straight forward right?!

WRONG!

It took two servers, and the owner 30 minutes to clarify....  We were a party of eight, and two of us wanted the unlimited salad special.  But, NO this was NOT permitted.

I will clarify the policy to save you a lot of time and aggravation:

If you want to order the unlimited salad special EVERYONE in your party MUST order an entree AND add the $3.99 unlimited salad PER PERSON! 

If you are a party of 5 prepare for everyone to order entrees and add the 3.99 on top of  it, per person.... IF you are dining alone, you are FORBIDDEN to order the unlimited 3.99 salad.

We found the policy incredibly disturbing.  Sorry all you single,divorced, widowed people...NO 3.99 salad special for you.  We felt like characters in a Seinfeld episode or a Woody  Allen film.  

Jerusalem Grill is truly an alternate universe.
The food  was tasty.   It was fresh, cooked and obviously Glatt kosher.  

The hostess who seated us was exhausted, overworked, frazzled and a little brusque.  Clearly the owners wife.  She really needs more help.  It might have been nice to be welcomed with a smile and perhaps a cup of ice water while we waited.  It was over 100 that day.

I actually felt sorry for her.  However, we didn't drive all the way there to be snapped at when we made multiple attempts to order the bottomless salad special.

I believe this restaurant is worth the trip.  Especially if you are going off your diet to indulge while on vacation...  The 18 French fry serving is surely only 4 points on weight watchers?!

Whatever you do, smile, take some deep cleansing breaths and DO NOT, under any circumstances attempt to order the $3.99 bottomless salad special.",G7a43LYgxoZR8_vsww33jQ,4,0,3,BAldTILm-rXeHrMSerXOPQ

The food here is amazing I will definitely be ordering food from now on to my hotel room as well as feeling confident to bring my clients here. I have to truly say that show warm a grill in Las Vegas has quality food with the most amazing customer service I have ever seen in the last five years of me attending Vegas tradeshows.

5198975,2011-04-21,11,SFaCcwpIKjrpnT1IjzEDdg,"Favorite food? Well, that's a tough question, but banchan (delicious Korean side dishes) and falafel would definitely be contenders, and somehow Jerusalem Grill comes close to delivering both. No, it isn't some inventive Korean-Israeli fusion spot, but they have the option of adding bottomless salads to your meal! These tasty little suckers are pretty much the equivalent of Korean banchan. Granted, you have to pay for them, but they are bottomless! (Look how beautiful they are in my picture.)

I have never experienced bottomless Israeli salads, so perhaps I am overly excited by this. Either way, there were some tasty numbers in the spread, including plenty that was pickled and spiced, a perfect egg salad and a corn creation. There were so many! I wish I could go back and just eat the salads. In fact, I may try that soon. 

The bread was without question delicious- hearty and with a nice grilled flavor. For an entree, I ordered falafel, and they were pretty good. I thought they were a tad small and a bit overfried, but the taste was fine.

With the addition of the bottomless salad, the meal was a little more than I might have expected to pay for a falafel dinner, but it is hard to place a value on those salads! The atmosphere is casual and homey like a familiar neighborhood place. I definitely sensed there were regulars, and our service was charming, even if it was a little laid back.  

Again, the mere existence of the salads may be swaying my judgement a teeny bit, but I definitely think Jerusalem deserves a visit so you can at least be in the presence of such beautiful vegetables just once.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,19,13,4,0_a4lfUyTDiNTCZ91e8gVA

Guy in charge In a bull rush towards me and rather rudely: ""Sorry, the rabbi is here and he decided to close the place early.""  Hostess, while looking at the clock and in the middle of boss man's statement: ""But it's only..."".  
Needless to say, I will not be returning.  Besides the place is a cramped cafe/diner and I didn't smell any food in the air.  The only thing in the air was boss man's nose: dark heavy set fellow with charcoal grey hair and hebrew/mideast accent.",J7AHo3x07Ax8pdAeU1Gvog,6,1,1,u04qHrjt7Md4b9RoMz0g5g
