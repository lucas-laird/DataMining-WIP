Hands down the best brisket I have ever had, perfectly cooked to juicy, smoky, tender perfection. The pulled pork and chicken both melt in your mouth delicious.  The sides of potato salad, mac and cheese and bbq beans all great and obviously made with a lot of love. To top it all off, Cody himself comes over to our table to ask how everything was, he's a real deal pit master and a heck of a nice guy too! We rightfully praised his cooking and he blessed us with a couple of brownies on the house for dessert, the brownies were rich chocolate wonders so mad they were out of the praline banana pudding but there's always next time.

Pulled Chicken - Good...but I'm not really one to order chicken at a BBQ place!

Cole Slaw - Tangy and obviously homemade

Mac & Cheese - Polarizing. I thought it was okay, but the woman loved it.

They offer fresh smoked meats (Chicken, pork, BRISKET), and classic BBQ fixings. I opted for the 2 meat (Pulled pork, Chopped Brisket), Two fixin's (Baked beans & Mac & Cheese)and a DR. Pepper combo for about $12, They asked me if I wanted the meats in a bun at no extra charge which was great, I said yes. In Austin my favorite BBQ place is Rudy's BBQ, and I can honestly say this place is the best Las Vegas alternative I have found for fresh smoked BBQ. The Brisket was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of delicious smokiness, the Pulled pork was delicious and not saucy like some places, you choose the amount of sauce you want and add it yourself. They also offer full racks of ribs and meat by the lb or half lb. In my opinion, Cody's BBQ is definitely a hidden gem worth seeking out!

The pork was the perfect combination of salt and smoke.  The brisket was a little fatty, but it was tender and the fat melted in your mouth.  I also had the baked beans and potato salad as my sides. The beans were very good with a nice amount of sweetness that was not over powering.  I liked the potato salad, but I generally prefer it with a little more mustard and slightly more cooked potatoes.  That is just my preference.

1728885,2015-05-22,5,TYGVaav4hWZioQlk9Ig78A,"Here's the BBQ buzz on this new spot: It's straight up down home Texas style, where smoking meats in mesquite wood are their forte. Cody smokes em like nobody's business!  Low and slow with whole logs of mesquite wood in that industrial size smoker. 

The menu is simple.  Meats: Brisket, Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork and Pulled Chicken. You can order by the pound and/or rack, sandwiches, or combo plate.

The sides offered potato and mac salad, baked beans, Mac and Cheese, Momma's Slaw and chips.

The combo plate is perfect for a lunch meal. Along with your choice of meat(s), it comes with 2 fixins (side dishes) and a drink. 

Prices are pretty reasonable and portions are just enough. We actually think that paying $14 for a pound of brisket was great deal and worth it!

We both ordered the combo plates with choice of any two meats; pulled pork, baby back ribs and brisket.

- Pulled Pork: Pretty good. Nice flavor and tender. Right up there as other places we tried. 

- Baby Back Ribs: Perfect! Simple spice rub, meaty, slides right off the bone and smoky flavor not too strong or nor weak. The combo order has 3 bones served wrapped up in foil.

- Beef Brisket: Awesome! It's the tender melt in your mouth kind! Served chopped in it's juices, fat and all which made in even more flavorful. That's backyard bbq purist way right there! It drives me nuts when other places cut out too much of the fat and serve it lean. 

I agree with Cody when he says if you are a calorie counter, this probably isn't your place. When it comes to cheat day, forget about me being the healthy eats nut! I  will come here for my first choice, and would order Cody's brisket now!

Brisket was so delicious, we ordered more and got one pound to go!!  One pound made 3 sandwiches with generous servings of brisket.

Things To Note::

No one under 21 allowed inside since it  is a bar. That's the only negative. There are a couple tables on outdoor patio which is family and pet friendly though.

Since they lease space inside here, the kitchen space is limited. So dont go in expecting an extensive menu with burgers, fries...there's simply no room to store more food. Although they did manage to work in Fish Fridays and they will start serving links soon!

Walk in, order and pay at counter. Seat yourselves. Food is brought out to you. 

The place itself is small as dining space goes. Inside, counter top tables along the wall, two high rounder tables and seating at the gaming/bar area.  For a divey ish place, it was clean, ventilation good, not much cigarette smoke smell inside. 

The table bbq sauce is Sweet Baby Ray's tweaked up a bit.

Ooo and try the Pecan Praline pudding! Nice sweet treat! 

Also note....No fountain drinks, no ice tea. Only can soda. They would love to serve brewed tea, but being they leasing space in a bar, they are pushing it serving their own drinks as it is. But hey bbq and beer go hand in hand, so Hard Hat Lounge gotcha covered there!

LOCATION: Industrial Rd just off Wyoming. Look for the building that says Hard Hat Lounge. You'll also see Cody's Smokin BBQ banner and the smoker out front. Cant miss it. Parking in immediate lot and there's overflow right behind access on New York St. 

Service was great! Our food came out quickly.Everyone was welcoming and really appreciative that we came to check them out. 

Super friendly too! Manning the smoker at the time was Rex (Cody's nephew and only other person he trusts manning the smoker!)  and Tyler, front house was Ryan? (also Cody's business partner) and Cody's daughter. I learned they were partly behind getting Cody opening the business.  

Cody came up to us later and introduced himself. Had a nice chat about his business and he was cool to give Mr. B pointers on smoking bbq and give us a small tour of his setup he has going.

My own mama's version of this phrase was to say, ""If you can't do brisket right, don't do it at all."" Maybe that's why she never left Texas, it's pretty hard to find it done right anywhere else.

But Cody does! To be fair, he learned from a guy who was from Texas, and it shows. The brisket here doesn't even need barbecue sauce, it's so moist and flavorful on it's own with a nice crust of spices. I'd come back here and just get brisket!

The pulled pork was runner-up for best meat, but the pulled chicken was dry. Sides of mac and cheese and baked beans were not noteworthy, meals also come with a roll and drink.

Located within the Hard Hat Lounge, the open kitchen is quick and organized, and there's a smoker out front that smells amazing. Outdoor patio seating if you want to stick around and chow down.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,17,4,AUKsBdTWzL7gRzK8FpvmAA

I walked into a dive bar that immediately brought flash backs of my college bartending days... So of course I immediately fell in love with this place! 

Luckily for me the food was better then I ever expected! Homemade mac that was mouth watering! Pulled pork sandwich that left me wanting more, potato salad that had the perfect amount of mayo and not over dressed!

I ordered the baby-back RIBS and the brisket with a side of cole slaw and baked beans. You also get a can of soda. I was going to order the potato salad until they told me it came from the store :( which, imo, no Barbecue joint should ever do.

For $14 dollars, you cannot go wrong. The only problem is they have to contend with Rollin Smokehouse BBQ which has higher quality meats, and a better BBQ sauce. Cody's is a lot cheaper, but also lesser portions.

The brisket was very tender and juicy. The highlight of the meal.

The BBQ ribs were absolutely forgettable and had very little flavor. They fell off the bone almost instantaneously, and I had to pour the house BBQ sauce. The house BBQ sauce needs to be reinvented. This place has a lot of potential, but they have stiff-competition.

Let me tell you though, Cody's is no joke. The brisket is so tender and flavorful, one might not even need to douse it in sauce! Gasp! It's sweet, it's smoky, it's juicy. All of the sides I tried were great, the beans in particular, but the potato salad and mac n cheese were fresh, acidic, and gooey, respectively.

2811878,2015-05-22,11,TYGVaav4hWZioQlk9Ig78A,"Went here for lunch on a mild 80 degree thursday 5/21/15. Seeing somebody manning the smokers out front is always a good sign of whats to come. Went inside and found out that it was a bar style place with a few tables. I order at the counter and informed them that I would like to eat out on the patio.

I got the 3 Meat Combo ($14.50) Your choice of any 4 meats. Comes with 2 sides, bread, and a 12 oz can of soda. I went with the Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Babyback Ribs. For the sides I got Barbeque Baked Beans and Mac n Cheese.

The brisket was chopped and a bit on the greasy side. I was thinking maybe they let it swim in its own juices for a bit? As long as it wasnt dry it was decent. The pulled pork was on par with all the other bbq joints I have had. The best part were the babyback ribs. You are given 3 bones with your combo. Now this, folks is what definitely will bring me back. It's literally fall off the bone, moist, and seasoned just right. Almost had me singing the Chile's theme of baby back ribs instead its Cody's. The mac n cheese was good. Has some pepper in it. The baked beans had a perfect mix of barbeque sauce and seasoning.

Service was very friendly and they get your food out to you right away. They even check up on you to see if you need anything.

Some random info. Since its a bar on the inside, you have to be 21 and over to go in there whether its to order and eat there or just to hang out. You can, however, eat out on the patio if you brought your kids with you. You can even bring your pets since its outside. The barbeque sauce they provide for you is Sweet Baby Ray's with a couple tweaks here and there. They dont put any sauce on your barbeque. This is on purpose so you can taste the product in its own natural juices. Fridays are Fish Fridays. They serve Barbequed Smoked Salmon. Will check it out later on down the road. They use mesquite wood for their smoke flavoring. They are open monday through friday 11 am to 7 pm. Now this might change sometime down the road so make sure to pay attention and call ahead to make sure that they are open before you go out there.

Overall, the place is solid. The meats I had all had the nice smoky flavor to it. Now I love beef ribs so if they start serving that along with a nice sized burger with some brisket on there, boy they just might become my number 1 bbq joint. In the mean time im glad they are here to give the other joints some competition and no im not talking about the chains. For those that are curious, this here is Texas Style Barbeque.

Cody Smokin' Barbecue is on Industrial Rd, that weird labyrinth of strip clubs, body shops, and government housing. Not the most endearing place to visit, but as my hero Anthony Bourdain says, ""travel is about the gorgeous feeling of teetering in the unknown"".

It's always a good sign of BBQ place when there are giant meat smokers outside of the venue. I asked the fella working these black evil looking contraptions, what he was cooking... ""Brisket, pork, chicken"". Pleased with this no bullshit answer I walked inside and immediately ordered the ""Bucket"" and a pulled pork sandwich. 

""The Bucket"" should be illegal. I mean only an ex-con could think to pack this much evil goodness in such a small container. Layers of meat, mac n' cheese, and complex carbs, yumm. These treats are one hundred percent customizable and I myself created the Brisket, Mac n' Cheese, Baked bean Bucket. If you're hungry or just ""peckish"", this is a must order.

I only had a few bites of the pulled pork sandwich, but I'm sure I could kill an entire trough of this if dared. Juicy, flavorful, and melt-in-your-mouth tender, seriously amazing.

Eating in a dive bar isn't ideal because of the cigarette smoke, but the food here is totally worth it.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,18,17,5,1agzVp9nYLmH6Nlgmom9-Q

It's always a delicious, huge hit with our speakers at the event, but I also wanted to try out the restaurant.  I grabbed my BBQ-loving husband (who is from Santa Maria, so he thinks he's an expert on the art of BBQ) and headed down to Cody's.

When I heard it is inside of the Hard Hat Lounge, I thought it must be kind of like how Naked City Pizza is inside of Moon Doggies.  Cody's is reminiscent of that, but also has a nice patio outside if you don't want to sit inside the smoky bar, or if you have kids with you since they can't eat in the bar.  

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and my husband ordered a brisket sandwich.  I loved the pulled pork!  The bun/roll was very soft and the meat had a distinct smoky flavor (hence the name of the restaurant, I suppose!).  It was very tender and juicy and did not need any barbecue sauce, to be honest, but I slathered some on there anyway.  I usually find BBQ sauces either too vinegar-y or too sweet, but this sauce was right on the money.  It was a thicker sauce so it stuck to the sandwich and didn't leak out of the sandwich all over my hands.

As for sides, we got beans and mac and cheese.  The beans were tasty with a thick, molasses-y sauce.  But the mac and cheese...be still my heart.  Creamy with BLACK PEPPER sprinkled throughout!  That pepper added a really nice kick to the sharpness of the cheese.

There are a lot of good BBQ spots in this city, but I think Cody's is one of the tops!  And the fact that they love to help out their community is an added bonus!",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,3,4,5,oKkTJRycEqs7e21mhiI4vw

Parking was no issue since the lot is private for the bar which Cody's BBQ shares the dining room. Inside was air conditioned and comfy. They also have a couple of tables outside, which would be enjoyable on a nice evening.

Selected the three meat combination and choose brisket, baby back ribs and pulled pork. For the two sides - home made slaw and beans. The BBQ was bomb - smoked perfectly and the ribs were falling off the bone tender. The sliced brisket melted in my mouth and pulled pork was solid too. The sides were stellar and I could taste homemade love that went into them. Don't forget to save room for dessert. I went with the banana pudding which was a perfect way to end a super gratifying lunch.

But don't let the outward or even inward appearances fool you. The food this place is putting out is ridiculous.

I ordered a two meat combo for lunch. I wanted brisket and pulled pork. For my sides I ordered cole slaw and baked beans. Here again, appearances are not everything. The beans and slaw look generic but they taste entirely their own. The beans are a little sweet and a little peppery. Nothing overly special but still pretty good. The cole slaw was surprisingly fresh tasting. I was expecting soggy slaw like at KFC. This was, first of all, not soggy. Rather it was quite crisp. Also, this is a vinegar based slaw. Not a creamy slaw. Perhaps there was too much liquid left in the bottom of my clam shell but is that really worth bashing an otherwise delicious slaw?

As for my meats, it didn't look like I was getting much. Each meat was wrapped in its own little foil pouch. However, having eaten every bite I can confirm that it was more than enough food. I was really pretty full. Sure, other BBQ places around town may give you more food but quantity does not always win out over quality. And this is some quality meat. The pork was juicy and tender. I'm not always a fan of pulled pork but this was awesome. It was smoky and sweet. It almost reminds me of kalua pig. I put some on a half a hamburger bun (the bread they give you) and topped with a little bit of sauce. An open faced pulled pork sandwich. The rest I ate just strait up. I did the same with the brisket. It was fine on the bun half but, oh my sweet goodness, this brisket was otherwordly on its own. The smoke ring on this cow could put a dirty bathtub to shame. It penetrated so deep when all the fat rendered out in the cooking process. That was some quality smoke. I saved a few of the smaller bits for my final bite. This was the stuff sitting in meat juice. This was the most intensely flavored bite I've ever had. It was like liquid BBQ. A concoction of beef oil, rub and smoke. It lingered on my tongue for an easy hour. It made me hungry when I was full.

How could such a beautiful meal come from such a dingy place? Its all about the smoker. That diamond in the rough that sits proudly in the parking lot of the Hard Hat Lounge. Play heed to the good local Yelp crew and stop in here. Don't drive by unless you're lost. Then find your bearings, turn around and come back.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,31,22,4,aK7Q3azbRqnE75J6jgi9Ew

The meat is the star of the show.  We didn't get to try the brisket because they were out, but we sampled the pulled pork, ribs and chicken.  They aren't afraid of seasonings here - nice and salty and smoky. Pulled pork was nicely cooked and not overly greasy.  Chicken was flavorful and moist.  But the Ribs... The bark was beautiful, crusty, smokey over fall off the bone meat.  They make the beans, coleslaw, mac & cheese in house.  The beans and slaw were both great.  My husband wasn't thrilled with the mac & cheese, but I don't think he even likes any homemade mac & cheese - so that's not really a shocker.  We liked our meal so much after we ate we got more meat to bring home.  Oh yeah, the ladies at the counter were super friendly.

Hours are 11am to 7pm M-F. This time we came with the knowledge that Friday was fish day...and they had smoked salmon on the menu. 

My friend ordered the salmon/brisket combo and I went with the salmon/Rib combo. Both portions were good sized and plenty to eat for $12.50 which includes two sides and a drink. I had macaroni salad done similar to a Hawaiian BBQ place and baked beans that were sweet and smoky. 

The salmon was very good, although maybe a bit dry (it was the end of the day) but these were the best ribs I've had in Vegas in a long, long time. I didn't use any of their BBQ sauce because the flavors are just that good by themselves. A sample of my friends brisket was the same, tender, moist, and flavorful. He loved them as well, and we both know good BBQ and have sampled pretty much everything in Vegas worth trying (just a few newer spots to go).

The lack of the 5th star is because of the location, a bar in a not so nice part of town, the serving on a paper plate that was too small to accommodate all the meaty goodness (served in tin foil and set upon the bar to eat). It's divey, its cheap, and its good. Just a few minor things to work out (they had run out of a few items).
