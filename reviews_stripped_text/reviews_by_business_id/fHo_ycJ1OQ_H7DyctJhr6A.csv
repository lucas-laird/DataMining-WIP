1170300,2018-05-18,0,fHo_ycJ1OQ_H7DyctJhr6A,"5 stars for bartender service.
2 starts for waitress service.
2 stars for food.
Overall negative experience, save for the guy behind the bar.

After I walked in and chose my seat (I agree with the review that said they need a ""seat yourself"" sign), the bartender told me the waitress would be with me and asked me if I'd like something to drink ""to speed up the ordering process"". He also offered to change the TV if I wasn't happy watching the hockey game. Very thoughtful!

Waitress came over after another couple minutes. I got the small chicken fingers with chips. The fingers came out piping hot and huge, as expected from reviews. (This was my first time at the Blue Ox.) But actually eating them was impossible. The batter was so thick that it didn't cook through and was wet and slimy on the inside. To make it worse, the homemade chips were ice cold.

I ended up picking off the offending undercooked breading and getting through one piece of plain chicken breast before the waitress checked on me (which took FOREVER). I hated to do it because I understand that I've chosen to eat in a bar, but I had to send them back to the kitchen. I'm not that kind of person, either. They were just gross.

Btw, when asked if they are normally breaded that thickly, she said with an air of pride, ""Yes, they are tempura battered."" I know what tempura is, and it is not thick undercooked batter. Kind of the opposite, actually.

Thankfully they were cool about it and offered to make me something else. I chose the grilled cheese on sourdough with the chips again. The chips were piping hot and I like that they offered four different bread choices. It wasn't a remarkable grilled cheese or anything, but it made up a bit for the fingers.

Sadly, the experience at the end was not good either. I was basically ignored by the waitress after getting my grilled cheese. I sat for a good half an hour watching her take care of other tables multiple times. Not one glance in my direction. I actually had to go up to the bar myself and request a check because I really really had to go home. I slapped down money and called it a mistake I'll never make again.

Bottom line: I won't be back and I won't recommend this place to anyone for anything besides a beer and watching a game. Eat somewhere else.",kUQx_wxmHgZ4CvhNeDpPww,0,0,2,Qb_Mh-AVU2rZw9rOEr-Zbw

She took forever and beside that she was taking to the cook about how I told her that we were in a hurry and if she can take or order because we were ready. She even comment to the cook that she would take another 3 person order before use just because I had complain.

Up until yesterday I loved the place. Apparently saving a seat for your friend is prohibited at this place. Although everyone else was saving seats for their friends on this occasion & every other time I am in there. Owner came up & yelled at me for holding a seat for my friend & flat out lying to me & telling me that patrons were leaving because they could not find a seat. The place was 1/2 full at best so don't lie to me telling me some bullsh*t that patrons are leaving. I could see the door because I was watching it for my friend to come through it & no patron ever left the bar (only to smoke & then they came back in). I specifically arrived 40 minutes early to get a seat before kickoff & although someone was in the seat I wanted when I arrived I took a different spot. Some @$$hole arrives 35 minutes after the game has started & just because he can't have the seat I was saving (my friend was getting off work & on their way) he went all crybaby to the owner & hence I got yelled at. Yet the best part of it was there were 2 open seats on the other side of me that the crybaby wouldn't take because they weren't on the long face of the bar but instead the short side where I mind you a TV is completely pointed & you can see the same as I could. I could even see the actual TV that was pointed to the side bar. There were other people sitting on the short side of the bar that sit there every week so apparently you can see the TV otherwise they wouldn't sit there. There was also an open seat at the other end of the bar that the crybaby could have taken but wouldn't. Also many tables in the bar with just 1 person sitting at them - why didn't the owner go up to those one person tables & tell each of those people that they needed to combine tables & sit together with each other because he was having patrons leave (which was a lie)? The owner is a complete jerk & a liar (he definitely does not know what ""Minnesota Nice"" means) & it was completely uncalled for what he did to me by coming up & yelling very loudly at me in front of the whole bar causing a scene.  He definitely just created bad voo-jue for himself. I know plenty of MN fans that frequent that bar & after I told them what the owner did to me will never go in the bar again themselves. I will never go to the Blue Ox (any location) again & give them a penny of my hard earned money again.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,1,1,X5UbryTvnpMVQPI--4MMKA

As far as the menu, you can order the Minnesota Twin burger, the Kirby Puckett, the Timber Wolf French Dip and even Walleye.  There is a great variety of food since it is open 24/7. We ordered the Triple Decker Club and the Chicken Sandwich.  Crinkle cut french fries accompany the meals.  There were 6 of us and decided to get the homemade potato chips.  These are pretty darn good! Not healthy by any means but tasty!  My sandwich was good but I would just say good... not great.  The chicken sandwich was not chicken breast but ground chicken.  The hubby would say it was just ok and not really what he expected.   We have ordered the chicken fingers in the past and those are easily split between two people.  Huge portion and very filling.  

Our waitress did an amazing job.  She was funny, kept the drinks coming and chatted with us for a bit.   So the service was great.

Con: Turned off by staff, boarding on almost rude.  Get it that they are busy...  but, felt I was in way, and was a problem for them to order drink and get a menu for food.  Could only see one cook in kitchen, not 100% sure.  Probably reason for experience, under staffed for a known busy day.

2 words - CHICKEN FINGERS
I go into Blue Ox without knowing anything about this place, the ambiance, the food. the staff, etc. So I sit down, enjoy a few of the $2 PBR's and find myself a bit peckish. I call the bar keep over and ask for a recommendation, he instantly says the Chicken Fingers. I think to myself, ""Bar chicken fingers, oh joy, they must taste like EVERY OTHER BAR IN VEGAS"". Alas, I AM hungry, so I accept his recommendation and wait for my Tyson's frozen fingers to arrive.

A few minutes later I see this giant plate of something head in my direction, thinking that this must be a plate of nachos, a party platter or something. BOOM, a plate straight from heaven falls in my lap. HOMEMADE Chicken Fingers, each the size of a baby arm, WITH homemade chips! Fantastic! Everything about these morsels of chicken were great....a huge unexpected surprise. I am completely defeated by the quantity of food, barely able to finish the last finger and last sip of my beer and call it a night. What an adventure!

My hubster and I have always been curious about this place as we live right up the street and since the little one was spending the night at the in laws, we decided to pop in. It wasn't busy but then again it was a Thursday around 6pm. My husband ordered the jalapeno burger that came with thick crinkle cut fries and I had the chicken fingers. I only ordered them because I couldn't figure out what I wanted and I didn't want to hold up the waitress any longer so I was expecting your typical dive chicken fingers...fried with a nasty after taste and thin. I was wrong! Hands down these are the best chicken fingers I have had EVER eaten in Las Vegas (Cane's comes in a close second). Juicy, thick and hand breaded and they give you a shiyet load of them! It came with home made potato chips however I am not a potato chip fan period, so my the hubster ate them and I ate his fries (which were awesome). He also had a few of my chicken fingers and after we were done eating he said ""i feel like we've had fingers like that before."" We figured out that the fingers here are closely similar to the fingers at Cane's, another fave place of ours!

3113564,2013-03-11,0,fHo_ycJ1OQ_H7DyctJhr6A,"I have now had the HONOR of visiting all three of the Las Vegas BLUE OX locations, with my visit on March 10, 2013, to this central one.

Just like the other two, this one is equally spectacular, mostly because of ANGELIKA, who has the ""FIVE Ps"" needed to be a successful server: She's Polite, Pretty, Perky, Professional & Perfect!  (She also laughs at my moronic jokes.)

When I walked into this location on this Sunday afternoon, I felt obligated to ""introduce"" myself (and tell Angelika of my ""experience"" at the other places).  She smiled with recognition at the names I mentioned and said, ""Oh!  You're already family!""  And allowed me to sit at one of their BEST tables.  She then ""talked me into"" ordering the Pot Roast, and I'm sure glad she did.  it was  cooked up superbly, then Angelika excellently served it.  It filled me up for sure, leaving NO ROOM for dessert,which is actually a GOOD thing, as I am a Diabetic.

You know, there is one thing that I sometimes do at these restaurants, that I almost NEVER do at any other family-owned eatery:  I'll sometimes give the server a very large tip and tell her, ""Please give half of this tip to the COOK.""  That's what I did today and friends, it was worth every penny, believe me.

One thing I really like about the acoustics in this particular bar & grill, is the fact that you can sit on a side with almost NO noisy music or if you prefer, you can sit on the side where the music is somewhat louder.  So, if someone wants a quiet conversation with a potential lover or a ""business lunch"" with a client, you can achieve either by sitting on the northern side of the establishment, which is extremely quiet and has ""elevated"" seating.

The bartender, TED, is ultra-fantastic at what he does (he does EVERYTHING!) and even though he isn't from Minnesota (as are the owners), he was from my former state of Hawaii.  I moved here from Maui in 1992, while he arrived in the Las Vegas Valley in 1995.  It needs to be noted that Hawaiians are also very friendly and personable, as are folks from the Gopher State.  And, as information, I was a resident of the Twin Cities while attending the U of MN in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so I'm used to being around friendly Minnesotans.  In fact, my first wife was a wonderful born/bred Minnesota girl who attended college in St. Cloud.

There is also another terrific bartender named TOM, who has been there around 5 years and who hails from Rochester NY.  He cooks up one fantastic breakfast, every bit as tasty as his contemporaries.  He's also a wonderful conversationalist (when he has the time from his other duties), because there are things a man will only tell his bartender.  Bartenders are, as someone once said, ""Unlicensed psychologists, and BETTER at it.""

This is a quiet and laid-back place with a regular crowd of happy patrons and I'm glad to now be one of them.  It's located on busy Eastern Avenue (near Patrick Lane) and is convenient to everywhere in the Metro area.

Stop in soon, folks, and find out for yourself how special this place truly is.",EMqsN7DTFnR_VywY1SEc5w,3,1,5,jgXSfICQqpcn1BZOog3UnQ

Once we pointed out the lack of people the bartender reluctantly ""allowed"" us to sit at the bar but only if we agreed to ""move"" if someone wanted to gamble, which we, as locals and bartenders, completely understood.

Blue Ox is a small dimly lit tavern that you probably pass every day. That's okay with  me. Keep passing it PLEASE. More Ox for me:) They do have regulars I'm sure, but I don't know any of them. My favorite group was this older man and I swear his sister wives. This lady had the longest french braid with the bumped bangs in the front and a shirt buttoned up to the roof. The other lady looked slightly more modern with a slutty skirt suit on. Definitely 3rd wife material. Not Boss like 1st wife. Other than that the crowd is all over the place from what I gather.

FOOD: All about them chicken fangers. Not to be confused with fingers. You have to say fangers because you have to say it with love cuz they are in a class above the entire universe of chicken fingers. They are the size of Arsenio Hall's big ass alien fingers. All white meat dipped in that crunchy beer batter made fresh to order. NOTHING BEATS THEM. They have different sauces to dip them in and always served with their homemade potato chips and house-made Ranch. The fangers are the star here, but there are other delicious items on the menu as well. Example: Grilled chicken salad. I try to stay clear of fried foods most of the time so I do get this salad loaded with chicken, eggs, tomatoes and all the other salad fixings I like. However, my cheat day breakfast item of choice is the Country Fried Steak. I have only had it once, but hot damn it left a mark on my heart and on my thighs. It's the size of the Hustler Club. Excellent homemade soups are bomb, too and the kitchen is open 24/7.

DRINKS: Dirt cheap. I want to say my guy had a tall, spicy Bloody Mary for $3. No drinks are over $5 that I have ordered. The bartender is quick and friendly. Hell, all the staff is super cool.

Did I mention the jukebox? Full of 80's, Dave Matthews, Blink 182, etc. I spend more money on the music then I do on the food and booze!  

Blue Ox is my bar. I come here and can set the mood with the music and always have a good time. Please, keep passing it by and leave it all to me:)",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,18,21,5,LEB3qDTSAqql2rB0II2i7w

This is an unassuming bar I've must have passed hundreds of times. This may be my new dive bar. The first time I went here, they had Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap. This should have been my first clue that this place was good. That is still, by far, my favorite brew. I don't think they have it on tap anymore, but who cares. Hams was $2 a pint and I'm not even sure that is a happy hour price. Not a lot of times I've got some drinking on that only cost me $10. 

Now. Chicken Fingers. These are huge. HUGE. I'm not even sure fingers is an accurate description of what you get. More like chicken arms or something. They are ginormous. They are also as delicious as they are HUGE. They don't cost that much (less than $10 I'm sure) and you get a bunch of chicken ARMS. The breading is great, it's got that flavor that you can only get deep frying it but the breading remains crispy. Once you break apart that breading, you'll see some beautiful white chicken meat. Seriously, some of the best chicken fingers I've ever had. 

Oh what's that? You get home made potato chips. I almost opted for fries, but I had a food guardian angel tell me NO. I'm thankful for that. Their homemade potato chips are fantastic. They have a great crisp to them, no soggy chips here. They have the right amount of salt on them.

4654952,2016-06-28,10,fHo_ycJ1OQ_H7DyctJhr6A,"Blue Ox Tavern is a Minnesota Vikings and Minnesota Twins bar located on Eastern Avenue across the street from the McCarren Center Walmart Supercenter. At the entrance where guests transition from the outside into the dimly lit environment of the tavern, they are greeted by Minnesota Twins memorbelia. Throughout the pub there are pictures of Minnesota Twins and Vikings memorbelia. The Minnesota Twins and Vikings are displayed on the TVs throughout baseball and football seasons. Where the Minnesota Twins and Vikings are professional teams that play to win, the Blue Ox Tavern staff is a lousy unprofessional business team that plays to loose.

   I work close to Blue Ox Tavern. So between work and errands, I stopped there for lunch. This visit was around 2:30 PM on a Monday afternoon. And this was my second time. When I walked in nobody greeted me. There is a want for a ""Please seat yourself"" sign. After sitting down for a few minutes Pamela, the bartender became Pamela the waitress. I ordered a Coke. This time it wasn't borderline flat. After a few minutes, Pamela returns from the sporadically patronized bar to take my order. My mind was set on the BLT. 

   Pricing and selection trails behind competitive taverns including the Village Pub. When I looked at the menu, daily dinner specials and lunch specials were nonexistent. The value for the money trails behind commendable nearby restaurants including the Village Pub and Miller's Ale House. Here are a few examples of paying too much for average food in a mediocre setting. The onion rings were around $6, a Philly cheese steak was around $15, and Fish and Chips were $10.99. Most strikingly dessert is missing from the four page menu. Furthermore, their dinners are missing the included salad or soup that competitors such as Village Tavern include. Below this review, the picture tour includes all four pages of the menu. 

   When I ordered the BLT, I showed my Waitress Pamela on my phone, their very own Yelp check-in offer that takes $1 off the bill. Pamela representing Blue Ox Tavern did not accept their own Yelp check-in offer. She says, ""No, No, No, No, we do not accept the Yelp check-in offer. The Sahara location accepts it."" She takes my phone and looks at the screen claiming that the Sahara location accepts it."" Humm! I showed her that the north to south road on the screen that said Eastern Avenue with a Yelp dot for this location touching my phone's GPS dot under the Yelp check-in special was not Sahara Avenue. She is still claiming it is for the Sahara location. Pamela also said that she'd mention this to her boss and that they were taking the Yelp check-in special off. This bad business practice is not an isolated incident. In a previous review 21 days ago, Beki. C also mentioned this. So, if this was a Vikings game, Pamela caused her team to have a fumble. To support the fact that they did not follow the Yelp check-in $1 off special, following this review I posted a picture of the Yelp check-in offer and my bill. Additionally, I did not appreciate that Pamela was attentive to the regulars in back of me and practically ignored me and failing to ask if I wanted a Coke refill. 

   The BLT was a solid sandwich. Realistically with the sundry of restaurants serving BLTs in the Las Vegas metropolitan area it was average. I requested a lot of mayonnaise on the sandwich. They placed a little bit on it. It was good. The last visit they placed a lot of mayonnaise on it and the sandwich was tasty enough to lead me back here. The fries were nothing special tasting just as good as a bag of frozen fries that Walmart sells across the street. If only there was ketchup on the table, it might of made a slight difference.

    After paying the $10.06 plus tip, I walked around. At the right of the Tavern there is an area where you can hang out and play pool. If you leave this area to the left of the large picture of the blue ox, you are back in the center of the Tavern at the bar. Here they have gaming machines. On account of the fact that they need Caveman Keno with digital Keno machines, I have passed over gambling here. Now aware of their questionable business practice I regard gaming here with throwing my money in the garbage. 

    Blue Ox Tavern did not have the integrity to follow their own policy that is the customer gets a $1 off their bill with a Yelp check-in. However, I have integrity and follow my own policies. One of my policies is that when a business does not abide by a Yelp check-in special, I deduct a star. That is being nice because several Yelpers will righteously give the business 1 star. Concurrent to my policy I will suspend the business for at least six months and spread the word. In conclusion, Blue Ox Tavern is a convenient tavern to my work and errands that serves a decent BLT in a Minnesota Vikings and Twins tavern without a smile and integrity. The Minnesota Vikings and Twins deserve a better bar.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,17,9,2,qCuDOEOss_dBeu-AbCJBwQ

The place was very nice, well lit, and felt like a nice place to bring the family. They however are unable to serve anyone under the age of twenty one due to some kind of smoking law.
I will definatly  be going back!",r1GQcCXHL3dF93OvDosOaw,3,1,4,WDAVWQcRedwJHITjA-LAjQ

Reasonable prices. Unbelievable fresh quality. Served piping hot, by amicable, accommodating staff. The sauces are delectable. Please don't tell anybody! This place is a true hidden gem.

It is great to see what a great job Mike has done running the place since his fathers untimely death last year . Love this place.,5DuZbOCtUECYoWX7HPfMoA,0,0,5,2cgiMUxsgQwyPl8E4Ly0Wg

""Blue....Blue Ox...Blue Ox, B*tch!""

I haven't been to Blue Ox in a while, but I used to go every Sunday night for karaoke back in the day.

This place has the BEST chicken fingers I've ever had in my life. 
No joke.

Its been a while, like I said, so I don't remember all of the things I've tried here, but everything was always delicious, and the staff was always super great.

I've been craving good chicken fingers, and I'm off my nutrition plan next week, so  a trip to Blue Ox might just be in order...",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,4,4,dO23AeebnbyXJ8V4drlUYg

After another 15 minutes we finally got drinks. Since she had to explain how busy she was and that she was the only person on the floor I was surprised that the food came out rather quick for her being so ""busy"". Blue ox hire yourself a new server. I can say I won't be back if she's on shift that's for sure.",ctFzLKq-q8Tc-JfXkzOHfA,0,0,2,OV4FYBFtVZFRdcR4JPXbjA
