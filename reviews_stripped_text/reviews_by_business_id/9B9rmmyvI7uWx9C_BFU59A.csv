I was planning an event with very little lead time and had to figure out the food -- I was fortunate enough to find Smoke It BBQ.  I was very impressed with the level of service, knowledge, and attention I received.  Barry and Linda Greer were a dream to work with, they inspired trust from early on, made great recommendations and delivered on every single promise and then some.  Now... the food -- It was absolutely delicious, mouth-watering BBQ-- Brisket full of flavor, succulent pulled pork, corn casserole (must order), gourmet sausages, and huge beef hot dogs, and some beautiful salads/sides.  Everyone who ate raved about the food - nothing dried out here folks!  The bread was fresh and soft.  The presentation was also excellent - doing BBQ at a high end store might be tricky, but it was classy and professional.  They were generous with their time and expertise. Warm wonderful people who made my event easy, worry free, and DELICIOUS.  If we have another event it's a done deal.  Highly recommend -- use Smoke It BBQ big or small event I know you will be glad you did.",EElgsURPyFEh5CXrQbfaNQ,1,0,5,2LQRNlHLdTePcxjiJxxw1A

Everyone knows when you have a birthday for a one year old its more for the adults than the kids. Barry (owner) and his wife catered for 60 adults and let me say the food was AMAZING. I did picked two meats, pork ribs, BBQ chicken and two sides coleslaw and corn bread casserole. The ribs were the best I ever head, the chicken was amazing and the corn bread casserole was out of this world. There pricing is reasonable and they served the guests. Thank you Somekeit you made the event memorable and I will definitely be using you again.",Qtmidfrk8M1H4bFVfqujbw,0,0,5,6rLM-GoG-VRJ5bKaVEvUYQ
