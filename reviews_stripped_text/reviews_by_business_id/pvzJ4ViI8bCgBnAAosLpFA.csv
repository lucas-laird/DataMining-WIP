It was my first time trying Filipino food, and I wanted to grab as many selections as possible, so I got 4 combo plates. At $7.50 each. It was super cheap and each combo was served with 2 huge portions of sticky white rice. There will be leftovers for days. Tons of food.

My favorite items were as follows, and in the order of my extreme approval:

Dinguguan...made with organ meat, I believe, minerally, rich, and fabulous. Loved it. It was my favorite thing. The gravy was just magnificent. I want more now.
Sisig Lechon...the delicate pork skin, fat, and meat, chopped, and blended with crunchy, tangy veg and a vinegary sauce to cut the stickiness of the fat..so flipping good. I'm still drooling.
Binagoongan...reminded me of a delicious spicy beef stew..lots of hunks of yummy fat, and it was nicely spiced with jalapenos..but very mild. The meat nearly melted i my mouth.
Lechon...what can i say? These little nuggets of pork fat, skin, and meat are some of my favorite things. Kind of like cracklin' from down in the dirty South, but with a little more meat on them. They came with a yummy duck sauce, and made me super happy.
Kare Kare...normally made with ox tail, this one was done with pork hocks..and was so fatty and rich...the thick sauce really coated my mouth with this sticky wonderful flavor. There was also some nice veg in this dish. Loved it, and would definitely order again.
Caldereta...was spicy, flavorful, and seemed to be very exotic. I enjoyed it. It was difficult to navigate the many small bones in this dish, but it was worth it, and the guy actually warned about them when the order was made. Very tasty. I did find an over sized slice of ginger in there, and a few bay leaves. No worries though, as I was already minding the bones.
Pinakbet...maybe a little too exotic for me. It was a nice dish for someone adventurous. The one ingredient that turned me off, was the Amapalya, a bitter melon. I had never tasted it before, so I'm assuming it's an acquired taste. There were also lovely green beans in this, egg plant, and bits of pork. Interesting to say the least.
Liang...this is likely another one of those dishes that is an acquired taste, made with taro, which i was not fond of already. It reminds me a little bit of green tea, very herbal, and exotic, but I liked it a bit more with a hot vinegar sauce shaken on it at home, like I'd do my collard greens. I'm not knocking it though. I'm sure it's pretty authentic.

My only regret, was that I really wish there would have been a selection of dessert items to choose from today. I'm sure there were a few things I would have loved to try. Next time maybe. :) I will definitely be back for more.
Thank you for the experience. xoxo",CmTSZNEjcwxFfvq71WTM0g,3,1,5,0b6FL-Z2DAeYIDfZ1JWhMw

I've had take out there many times, but what happened there yesterday has happened to me frequently. I ordered a double order of pancit with rice. The server (male) very lightly gathered the noodles from the top, and then as he picked them up vigorously shook them. He did that with the next 3 or 4 scoops until both compartments were filled, successfully dislodging any pieces of pork that were in the tray. When I got home,  I discovered that there was not even the tiniest piece of pork in my to-go carton.
I always leave a tip, so I am wondering if such special service is merited since I'm a white guy?",1iOWydhXWMF3Up3gM9FqwQ,1,0,3,3l6HcudLqgOnxivRIbuDKg

1030402,2012-02-28,5,pvzJ4ViI8bCgBnAAosLpFA,"Growing up Filipino, I was exposed to the darndest things. It's no secret my fellow Filipino people will admit to at least one instance where their Filipino parents would overlook an expiration date, or drop a green bean or random item  and innocently place into a pot to be cooked. Besides, the ""germs"" will get cooked away in the heat...

Well ,that's how I've always felt about this restaurant. I came here a lot as a teenager. The food was always generous in flavor and never lacked spunk. Th service was always great and the people were always quick to help. HOWEVER not so long ago, my coworkers decided to pickup breakfast for a few of us in the office. I LOVE their longanisa and rice breakfast combo so I ordered that. We took it back to the office and ate in the breakroom. Bite after bite, I enjoyed my wholesome breakfast. I began to cut into the white part of my egg and saw that there was a sprig of ""something"". I assume maybe it's a part of a clove of garlic that somehow wasn't chopped thoroughly...I pick at it more with my fork, and begin to pull it out...
It was NOT garlic, it was a COCKROACH! 
A whole meduium sized FREAKIN' COCKROACH!
W....T....F?!?

This prompted the REST of my co-workers to want to return their food. Like I said earlier, the staff is nice, so the man at the counter refunded our money, but kind of ""shhhhhh-d"" us away,hoping we wouldn't make a scene.

1079737,2012-03-15,0,pvzJ4ViI8bCgBnAAosLpFA,"I've known about this place for well over 6-7 years but NEVER ate there before and now I REGRET it. I use to work down the street from it years ago. they are right beside a Thai BBQ place and, I'm sorry to say, when given an option between Filipino food or Thai food, I'm going to choose Thai every time. Silly me.

This place was AMAZING though. I've eaten at 2 OTHER Filipino restaurants before and this place beats them in service and portion easily. The restaurant, as ALL Filipino restaurants usually are, is a lunch line style setting where you pick out what you want from behind glass/railing and place it on a tray. The waitress/server was very nice and even gave me a discount (it seemed). Whenever I go to places like this, I like to order the fish because it's hard to find a whole fish cooked for you for so cheap. I ordered 2 whole pieces of fish w/ 3 scoops of rice and she even threw in a FREE soup ALL for only $9-$10!!! Now the review:

The Rice: Same as everywhere else just plain white rice but it was cooked well.

The Fish: They seemed to have 3 different fish options in the line. I got the one with tomatoes, garlic, and ginger (I think). The fish was mostly deboned and the meat was great. The tomatoes/ginger sort of had an overpowering taste. But hey they give you free fish sauce upon request so that was good. Most places give you only 1 fish for $10 but this place gave me 2 for $9!!!

The soup: Some type of homemade concoction with tomatoes, green beans, broth, other stuff I can't remember. The soup was OK  but the tomato/salty taste was a bit much. I felt like I had to drink a lot of water afterwards to get the taste out.

The Drinks: My only REAL complaint. I asked for a water and they literally handed me a bottle of water. No filtered water with lemon and ice in a cup, just a bottle. It didn't help that I noticed the water they gave me was the CHEAPEST water you can buy at Wal-Mart. That ""Nestle Pure Life"" crap that my wife buys EVERY TIME we go to Wal-Mart only because it's the cheapest. It seems like they only have BOTTLED/CANNED drinks which I'm sure they charge and arm and a leg for. Where is the soda dispenser???

So, all-in-all I'd suggest it for the price/portions but don't expect a REVELATION.",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,0,0,4,2npyjhaQu6el32SdddPSsA

Ok, so this restaurant is a point-and-serve establishment bka cafeteria-style aka ""turo-turo.""  So with that in mind, make sure you try to sample everything.  You can't do Vegas in a day and you definitely can't do DJ's either.  My last time here I had Laing and Bangus.  It was pretty much off the chain.  I don't know what it is about taro leaves that brings out massive flavor.  You know what kills flavor?  The quality of the restrooms.

If you're not Filipino then you probably won't understand what's happening on the television.  Usually a game show or a soap opera is playing, but more than likely a game show.  

You will definitely leave this place full and relatively happy.  I advise you head back to your room immediately afterwards because the ""-itis"" hits hard when you eat here.

It's no secret that one of my closest friends is Filipino, and I always joked with her that someday, I'd eat the food that is native to her country. 

Today, with some of my co-workers, we hit up DJ's. I don't really know what I ate, outside of the Pork Adobo and the spicy sausage, but I can assure you that this place is legit.

Everything is served Panda Express style. Leave your health freaks at home. Also, leave your pretentious bitches at home. This is the kind of place where you bring the type of people who know all forms of culture (whether it's fine dining, or ghetto-tastic ethnic).

You get a plate of rice, and two choices of entrees. ""Free soup"" as the server happily announces....and everything runs you about $6. Not bad at all.

The Pork Adobo was damn flavorful! The other stew that I had, was made out of a peanut style sauce and makes my mouth water from just thinking about it.

The list goes on! The dishes are kept well stocked since they have to accommodate long lines of people at a time. the food is never just sitting there very long because of the constant traffic they get throughout the day.

for about $6 you can get 2 entrees with rice along with their complimentary sinigang soup.  If you are a true filipino, it would be wise to get an extra order of rice. it's only 50 cents. For low carbers,,, you have no business eating here (just kidding)

Don't forget to order their melon drink or sago at gulaman! It's all good!

If you still have room at the end of your meal, try the halo-halo. You won't regret it. Instead of getting a scoop of ice cream on top, you get lecheflan instead. Mmmm!

Being Filipino, you would have thought I would have discovered this place while I was at UNLV because it's only a few blocks down on Maryland.  I didn't eat here till after I graduated from college.  Now this place is a staple for me.  You want some good, authentic Filipino food?  Grease and all?  Go here!  This place is so awesome!

When you step inside you will notice that all the food is behind the glass guard, and you ask for items just like in your local school cafeteria.  You start in the line with your tray and wait to get to the food line for your choices.  I usually get greeted with, ""Hoi nakong, what do you want to eat?""  Hehe, just like my grandma back in the day.  They have so many choices it's hard to pick your favorites.  Most people just pick 2 or 3 entrees to go along with your MOUND of steamed white rice.  You got daily choices from:

-Pancit Palabok and Pancit Bihon
-Bangus (so yummy with vinegar!)
-Lumpia Shanghai
-Pork or Chicken Adobo
-Dinuguan, Kare-Kare
-Roast Lechon (gimme the crispy skin)
-Beef Steak
-Longanisa
-Pinakbet

There's lots more!  They even got BBQ sticks and stir fry for you less adventurous Filipinos.  So good....and with your entrees you get your choice of soup!  Nilaga or Sinigang....so good for cutting into the fatty pork dishes and balancing them out.  It truly is a must have with your food.  Add me some Jufran (Filipino banana ketchup), vinegar, soy sauce, and Filipino All Purpose Sauce (no joke, that's what it's called...it's for the lechon) and I'm all set!  Best of all...2 entrees, rice, and soup only set you back $4-$6 depending on what you get!  Talk about enjoying your culture!  Wash it all down with a Boba drink or some soda...there's even a complimentary ice and water dispenser for you to use.  They do catering events as well.

At the end of the line where you pay, they even have some baked good for you to eat there or take home.  They have puto (yum yum with cheese), and other things like bibingka.  You can also order a freshly-made Halo-Halo with all the fixins' for dessert!  So good with the shaved ice on a summer day!  For those not in the know, Halo-Halo ('Mix Mix' in Filipino) is a concoction with coconut, beans, corn, and jackfruit among other things and is topped with shaved ice, and evaporated or condensed milk.  Go wiki it, it tastes a lot better than it might look.  That Dale guy on Top Chef: Chicago made a version of it on the show.

Place isn't fancy or anything, but at least it's clean and tidy most of the time.  There's usually a guy walking around cleaning up all the plates and such.  But the folks working there are generally really nice and willing to help you out with the names of dishes.  Knowing a little bit of the Filipino language (Tagalog or Ilocano) but isn't necessary.

So imagine my delight when hubby and I were in Vegas for his 40th bday celeb and we searched (and found) some highly lauded places.  We randomly picked BJ Bibingkahan and were so glad we did.

The place doesn't look like much...you walk in and it's got the food bar where you order your plate and the it's a pretty sizeable dining room with a few scattered TV's playing Tagalog dramas and variety shows.  

Although I'm very familiar with some of the foods, I still felt intimidated by the sheer size of the selection here at DJ Bibingkahan.  However, the friendly staff set us at ease, providing us with recommendations and samples.  We ended up over-ordering like we usually do at a new place and got the following:

- Kare-kare (w/ the requisite bagoong on the side):  This version uses pigs feet.  It was delicious but I prefer mine with oxtail and tripe.  
- Lechon kawali: This was really why we were there.  I could feel my arteries clog up but I'm sure the Diet Pepsi took care of cleaning the pipes!
- Diniguan:  Hubby's first time trying this...minerally and delicious, containing mystery meats and organs.
- Sisig:  Chopped pork, fat, skin in a vinegary sauce.  My fave!!
- Palabok: This version was premade with thicker noodles.  They had some chopped lechon on top and it was still pretty bomb a few hours later in the hotel
- Fried banana lumpia:  Surprisingly light due to using younger (tangy) bananas.  Addicting!

We are definitely going back next time. Forget the strip: you can't beat the prices/selection/service here!",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,3,3,4,NH71LuZ8bsM3Umyp-0kEyA

Likes:

-Price!
-Wide selection of food
-Longanisa served all day

It's setup like any other quick service style restaurant (think Panda Express with one, two and three choice plates) or you can order a-la-carte. 

Nothing beats rice, longanisa and chicken adobo when your hung over after a long night of partying in Las Vegas or watching Pac-Man fight!",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,2,1,4,lYylxpvHg5YbkT2hbP28vg

Finally took the OG's to Vegas for the first time since forever so I mentioned this place to mom and she was stoked to check it out. I enjoy navigating away from the strip because that traffic is always ridiculous. Checked the GPS and booyah were turning into the parking lot. 

All we came here for was the bibingka but they were all sold out. Fair enough we did come here later in the day so I was not surprised. Figured we grab some food to bring to the hotel room and save some money on dinner. Grabbed a combo plate for pops and waited for the rest of the family to arrive. A couple of days out in Vegas can definitely get ya craving for some rice. Everything is right on par with the Pinoy spots in San Diego.  Nothing  different from the norm.  

Is that TFC on the tv?

 Yeah now it feels like home.",rzIy4JY0QxnOSrgnAQwdoA,1,0,3,nu0_NqeLSoU5YjhVYDcmwQ

I don't remember flavor. I remember grease. There was so much grease on my lips I didn't need to put on lip gloss. Srsly I've tasted much better food in the Philippines - from  places that charge like $3 per meal.

It's 'Filipino' to treat your friends/fam when they're in town, to drive them around, take them somewhere nice for a meal. DJ's is most probably where you would take them - if you secretly kind of hate them, for whatever reason (maybe they 'forgot' to reimburse you that $400, or they're spreading rumors about your spouse, or something).

To homesick kabayans, don't waste your $ if you're looking for flavor or quality, or anything decent. You're better off eating Asian food from elsewhere & watching Wowowee at home.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,1,1,2,pArNwuSKHsEK3ja3dUm5ZQ
