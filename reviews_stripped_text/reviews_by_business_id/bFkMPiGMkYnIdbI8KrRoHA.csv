1340229,2018-01-21,0,bFkMPiGMkYnIdbI8KrRoHA,"There is a regional variation to how Middle Eastern food is prepared and why it's a little different from a Mediterranean cuisine. I ordered the Kafta Chicken Plate which comes with two ground chicken over yellow basmati rice, Middle Eastern tabbouleh, a pita bread, and a Middle Eastern yogurt. The Kafta Chicken is full of amazing flavor with the addition of many herbs and spices marinated into the meat. However, the yellow basmati rice taste kind of dry. I think it may have sat in the pot too long. Personally, a good basmati rice should always stay fluffy. 

Now the Middle Eastern tabbouleh is a mix of parsley, stir fry onion, slice tomatoes, and something that looks like a bright pink pickle. Honestly, I'm not even sure if that is a pickle or a radish. With their version of a tabbouleh, it's as though they prepare it more like a garnish than a salad. The Middle Eastern yogurt has a nice creaminess to it, I can taste a subtle hint of garlic. The yogurt is not overpowering and when you combine it with a piece of Kafta Chicken, it makes the meal delicious. 

The great thing about Afandi Restaurant is that after having your meal, you can walk to the next room and do a little grocery shopping at their market. Aside from canned goods and Middle Eastern tasty treats, they do have a small section for fresh produce at the back of their store. So if you're looking to find specific ingredients to make Middle Eastern recipes, this is a good place to go. Pricing is reasonable at the Market, and ordering food at the restaurant is affordable. They do make the food fast, and the people there are very nice. Also this place is as close as you can get to taste the amazing flavor of Middle Eastern food.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,2,0,4,ITOjzoh58tlLCirV1I0sQw

1420434,2014-02-27,0,bFkMPiGMkYnIdbI8KrRoHA,"Came in to grab a late take out lunch- saw the chicken shwarma praised in other reviews and ordered the sandwich. Half of the shop is a grocery and half is a restaurant. After placing my order, I I wandered around the grocery portion while waiting for my order.

Earned an extra star for having my favorite cheese here! It's a sheep milk feta, and it's in the back refrigerator in a square metal can with a pull-tab lid. Brand stars with a V, I never remember what it's called but you'll recognize it or you can ask for it. It's $14 and overpriced (you can find it for $10 in SF) but damn good.

Back to my takeout order.
Walked out with my food under five minutes after placing my order, it aws hot and fresh and had just been made.Sandwich was heavy and large, wrapped in several pieces of foil, probably about 9-10"" long.

Got home and devoured it- chicken was hot and fresh but a tad underseasoned, veggies and pita were fresh, but the garlic sauce was a little light for my liking. Per the menu, the garlic sauce is garlic and olive oil which is a little boring.

I had the best Shawerma of my life 5 years ago at Mediterranean Oasis in Naperville, Il, and ever since then I have been searching for something so good in Las Vegas.

The beef shawerma here was absolutely fantastic. Tons of beef, great tahini, and fresh vegetables all served wrapped up and super hot.  It was under $6 after tax, and right now I never want to live a day in my life without having another one. I concede that I will probably get tired of it eventually, but right now, there is nothing else for me.

The market attached offers other goodies at low prices, and it adds to the ambiance. The place is definitely not a full sit-down restaurant, which is part of the charm. I only interacted with one or two employees, but everyone was kind and welcoming to an obvious outsider.

The regular cucumber, tomato, lettuce salad is an authentic Lebanese salad and tastes almost identical to my grandmother's, with lots of lemon juice, garlic and mint.

New to me is the Afandi meat, which is like a spicy meatloaf kabob.  Not quite sure what spices are used, but it's delicious, especially when topped with the onions and parsley provided with the order. 

I have not been cooking at home lately, but was pleasantly surprised the adjacent Afandi market has a meat counter, where I could presumably request a special grind of meat for dolmas, if I ever make the time to cook those again.

I was running late to watch today's game RMD Vs LIV, called to order a sandwich and got to talk to Gino (owner and amazing guy), we got to talk about the Champ League Final and told him about my bad luck for not being able to watch it. 
He asked me to come over to watch it at Afandi restaurant on his new 65"" TV. 
That's what I call going above and beyond, besides the Beef Shawarma Sandwich was mouthwatering!!! 
They also have a full house Mediterranean market and meat department which I am sure will meet everybody's needs.",y-xCc3bJ-QiFDjSa1rARLA,0,1,5,bXgyXu-5rIfeqPWGovWnTg

The food in the restaurant is splendid. I usually get the lamb or chicken, and have brought many friends here. They recently increased the area for dining, so there are more tables and chairs. It's small, quaint, and lovely. Definitely recommend.",TFiz2L3uegEpakSjVXtkZQ,0,0,4,-sDWudyd3FXMAErB6ay3qQ

4578374,2013-12-10,0,bFkMPiGMkYnIdbI8KrRoHA,"Grocery store with a small restaurant attached. Owned by a very friendly and hard working guy who employs a small number of friendly people. Very good customer service and they have a full service halal butcher shop, too. Some of the meat is organic, ask the butcher. 

As for the restaurant portion, the food is good. I wouldn't say amazing, but very good. Their burger is very tasty though a little heavy on the mayo cabbage sauce. The other wraps and such are an acquired taste. There's a certain flavor that I can't quite figure out that I just don't like in the Falafel, Kabobs and so fourth. Price is very fair for the large portions. They make a good grilled chicken sammy too. 

As for the grocery store area, it is okay if you're looking for a few things but they are not a large store by any means. The best thing about Alfandi is the fresh meat selection. Beef, chicken and lamb. The beef is very lean and delicious. As well as all the other meats. A wonderful alternative to shopping at the grocery store for meat.

The space for dining is as small as it gets, there isn't waitress service, and there are no fancy folded napkins or hookahs, but it is hands down one of the best places I've eaten in Vegas so far for the buck. 

The food is fresh, portions are very generous, and just plain delicious! If someone in the group doesn't enjoy foreign foods, they do offer very cheap, American burgers for the boring people hehe ;). Dishes come out rather quickly and they are willing to alter spice levels to your liking. My favorites were the chicken and garlic side dish (forgot the name ?)

What a waste of money specifically after asking the cashier and her confirming they were. Last time I was there I bought tribe and the guy asked if he can cut it up and he did is very small pieces that it was impossible to clean.

5198921,2011-07-23,5,bFkMPiGMkYnIdbI8KrRoHA,"If you're questing for falafel, you might as well give Afandi a whirl! This super casual counter-service spot only has a few tables and also features a small Mediterranean market with a butcher, including halal meat. The service wasn't particularly noteworthy. They wouldn't let me sub something for the dolmas on the vegetarian plate, which made me moderately sad. But, I survived.

I ended up ordering falafel, fatoush, hummus and baba ganoush. I wish the order would have come with pita, but it did not.The falafel had a great flavor, but were a bit greasy. They did not travel well, and I suggest taking the time to eat them on the spot if you can and/or getting them in a wrap. The hummus and baba were solid. I was not a big fan of the fatoush as it seemed to be mostly tabbouleh without more substantial pieces of vegetables or lettuces, and there was something missing in the flavor. It simply tasted like tabbouleh. I did not try any meat dishes, but they appear to be a popular choice.

The no substitution policy, fatoush and lack of pita/bread left me a little less than thrilled. However, the falafel is promising and the baba and hummus were fresh and well-executed. Plus, if you actually use your home kitchen, there may be some exciting things in the market for you to cook up!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,10,5,3,-NBclPChl_lnqonTbS1k5Q

5580828,2015-12-19,0,bFkMPiGMkYnIdbI8KrRoHA,"I had a late lunch for the first time at Afandi. I've shopped in the market place, but never taken the time to sit down and eat. Food is prepared to order. I had the vegetarian plate and it was great. Every item on was delicious...I could taste all the spices and seasonings. Small/quaint and clean. I'm not foo foo, but I don't usually care for paper plates, however I can appreciate the idea to reduce the chance of spreading germs or utensils not always coming out of the dishwasher clean. It took a little maneuvering on my part with the plastic utensils, but I managed. Mainly because everything tasted so good. So, my thought was do what you need to do to consume your meal. It was a little too much for me to finish in one sitting, so I asked for to-go container and finished the rest today for lunch. I wanted to post a picture, but unable to figure that part out. I don't see any options on my page.

Oh, I found really really fresh pita bread. It's still not from Michigan, but it was a pleasure to feel fresh bread.

Yes, I will be back. I also love the idea that they have Halal meat.",utZdZNv82NHQh3sfYwsMWQ,0,0,5,ZkfHLzw1bAjVqB2iQk0g8g
