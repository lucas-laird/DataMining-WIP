Got the $50 prefix menu, also used the Costco gift certs... so definitely a great great value. Value:5 Star 

Location: Just plain weird, had to triple check the address on the navi to make sure we arrived at the right location. Location: 2 star 

Decor: No bad.. not great, although the open kitchen was both a plus and minus. Very interactive and fun with the... but the smell of the grill and some of the seafood was just overwhelming at certain times. Our clothing smelled semi-fishy from sitting at a table so close to the kitchen. 
Decor/layout: 3 star. 

Food: Major bummer. Let me just say, I never had rosemary's, I got nothing against them. Perhaps my expectation was too high... the food just didn't do it for me. 

-Hugo's BBQ shrimp and blue cheese slaw: Too salty, over cooked stiff shrimp. 
-Duo tar tar: Nicely done 
-Scallops and the Halibut were the best dishes of the night. Very Good 
-Meats were a major disappointment. 
The Veal Porter house was very tender but tasteless, very salty on the outside, but very bland on the inside. 
Rack of lamb were not bad, but not great either, portions were very small too. 
For dessert, we got the chocolate cream pie (very good), apple tart (very good), Bread pudding (super bad.... tasted like a doughy sponge... no we didn't finish it) and banana cheese cake (way too sweet). Over all food: 3 Star 

Service: Wonderful. We didn't have the heart to complain about the less than stellar taste to such wonder servers. 

Over all Rosemary's is not a bad restaurant, but I don't think it deserves the 4.5 star rating on yelp. Maybe they just had a off night, maybe my expectations were to high. We're from Calif, having to convince my wife and in laws to drive off the strip to eat at a 4.5 yelped restaurant for some delicious fine dinning... we were disappointed.",BF7dfuWmdb0TZyKpNlnr-Q,0,0,3,92abnypXlzKMuQ_oj_MgBw

You have some of the best food I have EVER eaten.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  Service was very attentive during the meal.  We elected to have the prix fixe menu which includes one entree and two sides or desserts for $55 per person.  The meal began with fresh baked rolls, one with a white chocolate filling which was OH SO GOOD!  I had a mushroom soup that was perfectly flavored while my boyfriend had a chilled avocado shrimp soup that was also fantastic.  These were followed by an asparagus salad topped with goat/blue cheese, bacon pieces and boiled potatoes/onions.  There were so many flavors in this salad, but they blended together perfectly.  For the main course I chose the prosciutto-covered veal and my boyfriend had halibut.  Both were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  We finished the night with their cheesecake....so light and airy.  Next time I come to Vegas I am spending all of my time here instead of watching the drunk skanks on the strip.",X0PCrAIwL3MkuasfjT5bGQ,2,1,5,tjipkEn_LJBnGuh3M6shcw
28265,2009-01-07,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"yum. yum. yum. As well as, ahh, so nice to get off the strip. Much better than many of the restaurants you'll go to in Vegas. So many strip restaurants tout that they ""fly this in from Alaska"" and ""this in from Maine"", but when it comes down to it, the menu and flavors at Rosemary's are top notch. 
We came here after I read so many wonderful recommendations. It is about 30-45 minutes off the strip, which can be a costly limo ride, but it's all worth it if you have a sophisticated palate. The wine list will not disappoint. 
I suggest sharing, as there are so many worthy plates.

38230,2011-03-21,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Dined here last night for the first time to celebrate my cousins birthday.  There were six of us - we ordered 4 apps (ended up with 5 b/c one of the apps was incorrect),  and we each ordered an entree.  
The risotto was pathetic - watery, bland & over cooked, salads - under dressed, carpacio - boring. The only app notable was the souffle of sorts.
Throughout the dinner I could see into the kitchen area and I thought I saw one of the owners (wondered to myself if he was watching the line and doing quality control).
Our entrees: 4 fish dishes and two meats.  I ordered the Pompano (a fish that I am very familiar with) and it was borderline overcooked, I also tried their Thai inspired striped bass - fail: couldn't even taste a hint of Thai influence in this dish.  Plating was also quite unimaginative.
If a restaurant wants to be considered ""fine dining"" and they are charging these high prices, they better be spot on, especially the food!
Our service was good - thanks Katie.",Ll8_RAGqMZ1rcS_TxcHP2g,1,0,2,d2TLD605qJz-U7yQ6GxDoA
39300,2009-02-02,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"One of my FAVORITE restaurants by far!!! My Dad introduced me to this place (off the Vegas strip) a few years ago. It's a bit of a drive and the location is in a strip mall, but once you walk inside the decor is very elegant and classy. 

I've been here about 4 times (only for lunch) with my fiance and friends. We tell everyone about this place whenever we hear someone is going to Vegas. I actually tried to take my colleagues to Rosemary's during a business trip; my boss said $25 was too much for lunch, but I would have paid because the food and service are soooo worth it. I've never had wait staff place my napkin on my lap everytime I got up and sat down.

Lunch Recommendations:
1. Hugo's BBQ shrimp - large enough for an entree. Delicious
2. Mahi Mahi - very tender
3. Chocolate cake - if you're a dark chocolate lover, you'll be in heaven

I can rave about this place all day. My fiance and I actually wanted to have Rosemary's cater our wedding, but the location wouldn't allow an outside caterer. Oh well, we just enjoy it when we're in town.",bJk_aw2xqokSNl30G3NVfg,2,1,5,Ony5x4MtUpBcDVnwI1GhLQ
54615,2010-05-23,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Was Rosemary's having an off-night this past weekend? The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was decent, but the food was underwhelming. I ordered the Texas BBQ shrimp and the Cheddar Hazelnut Pesto quesadilla, and my boyfriend had the Wild Salmon on special. The Salmon was overdone and lacking flavor. The BBQ shrimp were average at best, and the quesadilla was a bit tasteless. The dinner rolls sounded exquisite - chocolate/honey and potato, but tasted like cheap white dinner rolls from the supermarket. The amuse bouche quiche sent out by the chef was lovely. The complementary desserts that they sent out were greatly appreciated, but very supermarket-like as well. I wonder if the usual chef was out that night? Will have to try again sometime.",SvDBPy8VQoe7gdzR-RAcjg,2,0,3,Imq2IEpUamY0BZNu6Kd3oA
58797,2011-04-02,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"The wife and I ate at Rosemary's during a Vegas excursion for our 1 year wedding anniversary. It did not disappoint. It is wise to make reservations. Although it was a Tuesday, we witnessed a few couples walk in and were informed they could not be seated for at least an hour and a half. However, there is bar and small lounge area where you can enjoy a cocktail and appetizers while you wait to be seated. We dressed ""business casual"" but we did see some casually dressed diners. 

The service was excellent and the wait staff truly works as a team to ensure your dining experience is as pleasant as possible. The food was fantastic and our bill was about $120 (we each opted for the appetizer+entree+dessert prix fixe meal at $55 a piece). We used $100 in gift certificates that only cost $80 at Costco(in Summerlin or you can order them online). 

I highly recommend the Tasso Ham & Crawfish Risotto hot appetizer. Our entire meal was great, but this risotto dish was the star of the night along with the creamy mash potatoes (with kalamata olives) that accompanied my tasty rack of lamb. It was superb. My wife and I had expectations that were greatly exceeded. Additionally, ending the meal with the tart and refreshing lemon box dessert only escalated this dining experience. Certainly worth the money and drive as it is only minutes from the strip.",6DJdFn3oXBhBrc3fwXh3zQ,2,0,5,dXFHIfMrjl2llmzf-x72Jg
59164,2009-06-24,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Our dinner at Rosemary's Restaurant was a huge disappointment.  I chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews and I really felt betrayed. 

My husband and I went here on Father's day.  Our server told us about the 1/2 price bottles of  wine - which immediately put us in a good mood. My husband got the tasting menu and I went with the Prix Fixe menu. L'amuse bouche was goat cheese mousse on fried wonton - which was rather unimpressive - but it didn't taste bad, it just tasted as described. Next came beef tartar for my husband and beef carpaccio for me. The salad that came with the beef carpaccio tasted like the Field of Greens salad at CPK - again, it tasted good but seemed unoriginal and umimpressive.  Additionally, I didn't see the point of having the beef in this beef carpaccio - blue cheese and the sweetness of the salad dressing completely overpowered whatever beef was doing in there. My husband didn't say much about the beef tartar - which leads me to believe it was forgettable.  Then came sweetbreads for me and the Hugo BBQ shrimp for my husband. As others have commented here previously, the shrimp dish was good. Nothing about it said ""fine dining"" but it was good. These were followed by striped bass for my husband and baramundi for me. This was the beginning of the downhill portion of the evening. The barramundi I ordered was way over-salted where I could see the grains of salt completely covering the skin of the fish and the sauce on which the cabbage slaw and the fish were sitting was also extremely salty.  I took a few bites, but it literally was inedible.  This was the final dish of my Prix Fixe meal but my husband still had the rack of lamb to go. The lamb was well cooked - only dish of our meal that had a pleasing presentation. After mere one bite, my husband said ""this doesn't taste like it was tasted before it was brought out."" He said that the lamb and the Bordelaise sauce was way too salty and simply inedible.  At this point of our meal, I was extremely sad.  I really felt betrayed by yelp and just sad that I didn't stick with one of the famous chefs' restaurants on the stip but instead came to this suppsed ""hidden gem.""  I was so upset and disappointed that I couldn't even look at the server. When she asked how we liked our main courses, we answered honestly and for consolation prize she gave us free coffee and a piece of cheesecake. Which to me was rather offensive - considering how they served inedible dishes and they thought it will all be OK with some unoriginal, uninspired cheesecake?  

I felt that this restaurant should be classified as wannabe fine dining.  In addition to some of the food being inedible, there was serious lack of attention to detail which I couldn't overlook.  For example, flour-less chocolate cake had a piece of walnut shell on it - which my husband discovered when he took a bite of the cake.  When coffee was poured, our server filled the cup to the brim - was I at a diner? Did she think I was going to drink the cream straight out of the creamer? Portion of the kitchen is visible from the dining area.  While this concept is beautifully executed at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, at Rosemary's, you are literally looking into a commercial kitchen. Not only is it loud from pots and pans banging, it just isn't pretty nor interesting to look.  Lastly, this may actually be a positive for some, but the portion sizes were obscene. This was simply one more example of the recurring fault in our dinning experience at this restaurant - I felt that there was a lack of unity or integration of various aspects of the meal, which for me resulted in the failure to enjoy the meal both as individual components and as a whole.

This restaurant is not worth the trip if you are staying on the strip and we will never come back again.",ogPqAcpLqe5mB9DkWBUNgw,0,0,3,9aNrlzP75cKBcvIvY4_EHw
94901,2008-08-01,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"If  there is a Heaven, I fully expect chef Michael Jordan to be waiting for me at the pearly gates.  For me, there would be no moment closer to Nirvana than for him to say, ""Hi, Stacey.  What can I fix you to eat?""  

The dining experience at Rosemary's can only be described as sublime.  I do not have the priviledge of eating at high-end restaurants on a regular basis.  However, I do get to Las Vegas quite often, and I would gladly save my restaurant dollars to visit Rosemary's as often as possible.

Rosemary's has achieved the rare accomplishment of serving unbelievably delicious food and delivering superb service in a upscale, but completely unpretentious atmosphere.  Eating at this restaurant feels as if your best friend happens to be one of the most talented gourmet chefs in town, and he has invited you over for dinner (or lunch).

When I made reservations here for our 20th anniversary, my husband and I  were fawned over like rock stars.  Today we went over there for lunch, and for a price that was half of what we spent at Terra Rossa the night before (see my two-star review), we had one of the finest meals we've experienced in LV.

I am not exaggerating when I tell you that if you are wavering about whether to rent a car on your next trip to Vegas, do it, if only to make  it easier for you to get to Rosemary's.  Plus, you will get to go home and tell your friends that the best restaurant in Las Vegas is in a strip mall way west of The Strip beween a SteinMart and a dollar store.",IDBmm77l1Tgf8oUY1uNhxw,2,1,5,Z5haOD8ew3v_ntVcsIVoRA
110639,2011-09-30,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"This is a post mortem review just to say how awesome that place was. I am french, and came to that place last november, during my trip to vegas. While I wasn't overwhelmed bt lv, that place blew my mind. So far way from the prevention of most LV's restaurants. The food was delicious. Each plate was accompanied with an incredible sauce. And the service was I M P E C C A B L E (http://youtu.be/k7EeYQ_MbOM?t=25s). The waiters would wait in a perfect line out of the kitchen, one plate in hand, and once all the plate of the table were ready they would all go at once. I also remember my waiter being extremely polite, almost too much, and the thing was pretty funny because the place itself wasn't in an 5 star hotel (it was actually in a middle of a suburban mall).
I really open those guys are gonna do a follow up to that place, because I have been rethinking  a lot about this experience ever since I went there, and couldn't wait to go again.",-MVrLX80XYInhnKHVx4Z4Q,0,0,5,YSpI_S-qN-gi52vFQpM8QA

I had the house salad and grilled pork chops.  The salad was very fresh and the pork chopped was cooked medium which the waitress recommended.  I also sampled my friends arugula, endive & radicchio salad which looked like coleslaw and the combination blue cheese, pears, and hazelnuts went well together.   My portion of the bill was about $60 for appetizers, salad, pork chops.

I've purchased the Rosemary's cookbook ""Food of Love"" and tried to duplicate some of the recipes.  A feew successfully, others, not so.  But knowing how much time, energy, and detail went into each and every one of their dishes, I completely understand why it was so amazing.  What I cannot understand is why they closed.

Everything we had there was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. Nice staff was attentive to us during the meal. The  Wine Steward provided good advice for our wine selection that went well with our dinner that night.
We had reservations on a Friday night and we were seated promptly. The restaurant was busy. We tried a scallop appetizer, crawfish risotto appetizer, scallops for dinner and prosciutto encrusted halibut. All the dishes were excellent. The scallops were seared just right to ensure a good silky  texture to the center and sweet flavor. The risotto just got better with each bite as the broth was absorbed into the rice.

210667,2011-04-08,1,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Visit date 3/21/11:

So this is my fiance's favorite restaurant (ie: ""the best meal I've ever had"")  and we were there with our friends from France. One of whom is a chef. So I was hoping this would live up to his claims. We all were going to go for the prixe fix menu until we noticed that it may be cheaper to go a la carte. I was the only one who strayed and did three appetizers. I was going to get the scallops as a main but there was a special of scallops offered as an app and I was already afraid of having too much food. Looks like I was right because even ordering three starters overfilled me. Not a happy stuffed, but an uncomfortable stuffed. The little freebie desserts weren't even touched and went straight into a box for our table. We were all overfed and would've preferred smaller portions. 

For the food: Overall very nice but my scallop appetizer was a miss. It was too sweet with the sweet potatoes and not a good flavor pairing. The parmesan souffle was to die for. I ordered the mixed baby greens but was brought a different salad that was delicious, so no hard feelings. It had shallots that were so good I made everyone at the table try a bite (must re-create at home!). Fiance got the veal porterhouse and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked. The desserts that others ordered were passed around but everyone could only manage a bite or two being so full from the previous two courses. I wasn't too impressed with the desserts. Nothing memorable. 

The two dings against the restaurant... Our friends pointed out a couple of errors with the French that was written on menu/labels. I hope they get that fixed! The second was a lady's night where girls eat half off/ free. I thought our waitress was talking about something on the strip until I realized it was for this restaurant. Kinda left a bad taste in my mouth... why cheapen your fine establishment with... ladies night? Weird. 

Would I return? Absolutely. I would just order two courses though.",mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,1,1,4,paYcsF-BxbV6D6q412RvlA
236305,2010-09-09,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"After reading the rave reviews, I took my husband here for his birthday dinner last night. 

Pros: delicious prime steak (and he's a steak snob), yummy wilted spinach salad. They seated us quickly (with reservation). Nice interior atmosphere, romantic. Good rolls too. 

Cons: My husband got food poisoning. Thankfully, we did not share much foods, but we have narrowed it down to either the salad or steak. 5 hours after leaving he was in the bathroom all night. Which is a big bummer considering it was his birthday dinner and I surprised him with this restaurant. 
My entree was a pork chop, and I ordered it from the yelp recommendations and server. I didn't care for it. It was flavored well but the dish seemed cheap. Pork chops are not a nice cut of meat, and it was served with a bean/rice and bacon dish. Bacon is a cop out for flavor. I should have ordered seomthing else because I was expecting so much more.
Also, the service is slow. We were really waiting for our entree, 2nd course and even the check for sometime, he was beginning to get annoyed. We ordered everything in advance, so I really don't know what took so long between courses. 
We also were seated next to the kitchen's in/out door, which they covered with glass but still not a pretty view from many angles. I noticed several tables seated further away probably also had this view. Its a pet peeve of mine to be at a upscale restaurant and see the kitchen and wait staff in the back. 
Also, there is a very limited menu. It was fine with me, but if you find yourself with a picky eater, this could be trouble.

The food has not disappointed--it is an interesting blend of cal-french and cajun/bbq.  And, they have a very nice wine list. I would give them five stars but our service last time was less than stellar.  He was very confused about the wine, and kept offering us wines they didn't have and recommending glasses that they didn't have. So much so, that my Dad ended up saying ""forget it"". My mom ordered her salad with the dressing on the side and he attempted to pawn it off on her with the dressing on it. I had to specifically tell him to take it back in order to get him to replace it.  He did so but without apology or acknowledgment of his error. I couldn't tell if he was new or just having a bad day.  These are minor complaints however, given how much we do enjoy the food. 
The atmosphere is a mix of families (yes the table next to us had two babies), older people and couples. It's somewhat formal and a bit crowded for such a small place.  We ordered really excellent lamb and veal chop and the salad. But it was the appetizers that shone. The shrimp was fine but the chiles rellenos special was flavorful without being hot and the crab cakes were full of crab and flavor, with little bread.  We'll be back, but we do hope that server will be having a better day.
On our first visit we even got a call a few days after our visit to follow up on our experience. That first visit was perfect and I had nothing but good things to say. On the second visit, we didn't get any follow up call or I would have mentioned the waiter.

284703,2010-07-10,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Inconceivable! Tucked away in a sea of strip malls and suburban desert chain restaurants is this oasis of fine dining. My wife and I were visiting my brother who lives in Summerlin. It was a holiday weekend so I was sure we were not going to get a reservation at any of the fine dining restaurants on the strip. Plus I wanted to avoid the strip dining at all costs during the weekend. So we decided to check this place out based on the reviews and hoo-boy did they deliver. Service was superb. I knew we were eating at a special place when they asked if we wanted to change the color of our dinner napkins. Who the hell does that? Then they asked us if we had any food allergies. Score. I happen to have a walnut,pecan and freshwater fish allergy. This was the first time all year a waiter asked me about food allergies. Our server was Thomas and his assistant was Joe. They rocked! They were attentive but not breathing down our necks. They checked in frequently and made us feel very welcome. 
We started with an amuse bouche of pear poached in Riesling. Pear held it's own and was not overpowered by the alcohol and tasted very clean and crisp. Fine opener. They have different ordering styles, a chef's tasting menu, price fixed for $55/person, or a la carte. We decided to go with the price fixed. Great value. 
For starters I had Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes w/Emulsified Ravigote Sauce & G-ma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers. The sour cucumbers balanced the sweetness and richness of the crab. The Boulettes were ping-pong ball sized savory bites lump crab meat. My wife had the Twice Baked Parmesan Soufflé w/Garlic Cream & Wild Mushrooms. The star of this dish was the earthly mushrooms which balanced the richness of the cheese. 
We picked two of the meat dishes from the entrees. I had the veal wrapped with prosucitto. The crisp saltiness of the veal balanced out the rich tender meat. The fingerling potatoes were ok a bit firm. The peppercorn sauce was ok it didn't overwhelm the dish. My wife had the rib-eye which ended up being the star of the evening. A perfectly cooked large portion of meat with a charred crust and meat tender. What kicked up the dish was the awesome homemade steak sauce. It basically elevated the dish from a great steak to foodgasm! We had to restrain ourselves from fighting over the dish and save room for dessert. 
We finished this great meal with dessert which was more than generous. I had the creme brulee, my wife had a flourless chocolate cake I think, and we also got free tasting dessert. Noice. 
Dinner here made our weekend memorable. 

TLDR: 

Service-Best I had in recent memory 
Food-Great value for Great Food;Best Steak I had all year. 
Setting-Perfect for those who want to eat great food off the strip

Definately will return to order the Rib-eye.",YAx1fH7_x9ZJYSVKN_NKFw,0,0,5,jGFfJLIO9q1UfxbN5jTKrQ
290985,2009-05-26,1,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"I have eaten at a lot of amazing restaurants, all over the world... my husband and I both agreed that our night at Rosemary's may have very well been the best dining experince we've ever had.  Although I figured it wouldn't be acknowleged, I went ahead and wrote a note on Opentable.com about the fact that we were in Vegas for the weekend, celebrating his graduation from the LA City Fire Academy.   Not only did the staff at Rosemary's acknowledge his accomplishment; they went over and above to make us feel welcome, to congratulate him and to celebrate with us... a sure sign of a restaurant that values it's guests knows the importance of personal touch. The ambiance was warm and romantic and our server Tom, was incredibly sincere,  and just the right amount of attentive.  

Now on to the food... GOOD GOD!

We decided to go for it and order the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings.  Rosemary's has a lot of different menu options from very reasonably priced to much more expensive.  Because we had such a good vibe, we really wanted to put it in the chef's hands and experience all that they had to offer... we were so very glad that we did.

What followed were five courses of the most exquisite, stunning and delictely prepared food; perfectly paired with five diverse and delicious wines.  We were amazed.  Each and every dish was perfect... absolutely perfect, and so special.  To top it all off they brought out my husband's desert with a candle on it and the Chef, Michael signed a copy of the tasting menu for us. 

What a brilliant night.  

I know there are at least a dozen really good, swanky restaurants on the strip which would have easily cost us 50-100 bucks more than Rosemary's... I'm so glad we didn't go that route.  If you're in it for the glitz and glamour, be my guest.  I'll be in a strip mall in the middle of nowhere, eating the best food I've ever had in my life and marveling at the warmth and hospitality of the staff at Rosemary's Restaurant.",l4wVpLN_Zk1cDctMGYpl9Q,1,1,5,m0DPFQStSnQW2ar-TZ7l5A

Even when I lived in Henderson, I didn't mind driving to the west side suburban location.  It's quiet, easily accessible, and has tons of parking.  No walking through smoky, loud, annoying casinos; jostling your way through crowds of preoccupied tourists, and no over-the-top prices.  I relish the opportunity to patronize a locally owned/operated family business.  They face challenges that strip restaurants do not with staffing, employee benefits, and they don't have the benefit of buying their produce/meats/beverages 'en-mass' like the massive strip corporations.

Chef/Proprietors Wendy and Michael Jordan have truly created a local phenomenon.  Although I have dined there dozens of times since their opening years ago, my most recent experience in July 2009 was definitely most memorable.  Having dined at 3 Michelin star restaurants both stateside and abroad, I would have to say that Rosemary's delivers the atmosphere, service, and food quality equal to many of them.

From the initial phone contact with the host while making the reservation; the warm greeting when we walked in; the amazingly thorough menu description given by the server; the attentive, yet unobtrusive service given throughout the meal by the entire staff; the way the staff steps aside to give way as guests walk through the dining room; the napkin being folded and replaced on your lap when you return; to the petit fours offered (after you are so full you have to take them home); to the final goodbye and offer to come back, even the most discerning of diners would be impressed.

To add icing to the cake, they are currently offering a 3 course, weekday prix fixe lunch menu for $24, and they also offer a la carte, prix fixe, and tasting menu for dinner.  Most notably, our table was asked about dining restrictions and allergies by the busser/back-waiter as he poured our water selection - in less than 2 minutes, the server/front-waiter was discussing my options with me and the menu in great detail to ensure I didn't accidentally order something that could cause an allergic reaction.

If you are craving a fine dining experience, with all of the bells and whistles, without the hustle and bustle of the strip, the wallet-emptying prices, and the parking/valet nightmares, treat yourself to Rosemary's for a power lunch or an incredible dinner.  Although they have both a full bar and a well-balanced and eclectic wine list, don't be shy to ask their unpretentious and knowledgeable sommelier about an artisanal beer pairing with your food.  They have one of the best beer lists in town!",iZT3J9v_mFHPLw9PgaT9Iw,0,0,5,Wj0h1zNM_5jz7QTvEdXAOw

But this restaurant isn't like buying a ring from Zales, it's more like Tiffany's. Partners in crime Chefs Michael and Wendy Jordan are true artisans whos ""New American"", or whatever is the best way to describe their deliciousness, style cuisine is an experience all to itself. It's fine dining folks so I put it as one of those places where you get dressed up to eat. Where you buy a bottle of wine and take your time. Where you compliment the chef and the staff. This place is a treat and you treat someone special and start new memories.

Ok enough of the touchy feely and on to the food. Ok have you ever watched those TV cooking competitions like Top Chef or Chopped where they throw words out like confit, amuse bouche and reductions of this and that and use ingredients like foie gras and it looks super delicious but you're thinking to yourself ""I don't know what the hell that is but I wish I could get some of that.!"". Well here you go, here's your chance minus the pretentiousness that you think goes with eating it.  But worry not, they have totally approachable treats like pork chops, salmon, pasta and salads but it's probably the best damn chops, salmon, pasta and salad you've ever had or at least in your top 3 best. They have a small plates menu that'll knock your socks off. And again it's approachable with things like quesadillas, fries, sliders and pie but like the dinner menu it's the best damn quesadilla you'll ever have.

Both of us had salmon.  Excellent quality and cooked perfectly.

Again, both of us had apple tart and cinnamon ice cream.  Sounded much better than the taste.  It was good but did not match the previous dishes.

We were expecting a few smaller scallops like other ""fine"" dining places so it was nice they didn't skimp out.

Only thing that slightly disappointed what that they immediately asked about food allergies and wife said no gluten.  They seemed to understand but then brought out an amuse bouche that had bread.  They did apologize and brought another, cold poached pears which was actually better than the first one.  However the dessert amuse bouche they didn't do anything special and there were little cake things included.  It was not that busy either so it wasn't like they were rushed off their feet.

They have since moved 6 miles out away from the strip on Sahara/Cimmaron in a strip mall between Steinmart and the Dollar Tree. But, don't let this unassuming location fool you-- Rosemary's is the real deal and was voted Best Restaurant in NEVADA 2007 for a reason.

Sentimental us, we had to go back for a visit while in town for a trade show.  I can tell you that I also came back for the goat cheese cheesecake, but left loving the twice baked parmesan souffle in a garlic cream sauce the best. My husband and I opted for the $55 prix fixe menu which included 3 courses of your choice.


Hubs ordered:
* Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp w/Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw
* Grilled Pork Chop w/Hoppin' John & Creole Mustard Reduction Sauce
* A side of cheese grits(exra dish outside prix fixe)
* Carrot Cake (deconstructed and delicious)


I ordered:
* Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle w/Golden Chanterelles & Roasted Garlic Cream
* Brick Chicken w/Haricots Vert, Shoestring Potatoes & Dijonaisse Sauce
* Goat Cheese Cheesecake


The 2 things I loved the most were the cheese grits and the parmesan souffle. Maybe that says something about my love for comfort food, I'm not sure. But both of these dishes simply melt in your mouth and are the best in their class.

I should also mention the service-- a little stiff, but overall excellent. When dining out, I don't want stuffy-- I want an experience, I want to hear stories, I want to know WHY the food got on the menu. I really hope Rosemary's doesn't lose it's charm that they've been known for in trying to defend themselves against arrogant, snobbish foodies who tend to miss the point.

Reasonable price for exceptional food..My boyfriend and I both got the pre-fixe (1 appetizer, entree and dessert). He ordered a belgium beer and I got a pineapple mojito (yum!)..some of the drinks at the bar were i think 50% off during happy hour times..also it was ladies night (wednesday) so my dinner was 50% off which you really can't go wrong with! The staff was very attentive as they asked if we had any allergies or any foods that we did not enjoy-which i thought was a thoughtful question.

Before we got our appetizers, the staff brought out an amuse bouche which looked like a small quiche..my bf got nervous that this was the size of the meals..silly boy haha..it was quite yummy! they also give you complimentary bread, a potato roll and a chocolate roll..both delicious-i prefered the chocolate roll, the potato roll was a bit too salty but was still great. 
For my appetizer, i ordered the bbq shrimp and maytag coleslaw and my bf ordered the veal sweetbreads..i loved the shrimp, it was delicious..and usually i'm not a big fan of bbq sauce but this had a bit of tang to it which really complemented the blue cheese maytag coleslaw..my bf ordered the veal sweetbreads and I was not a fan of the taste or texture..he liked it so i guess at least one of us enjoyed it.
For the main entree, i ordered the rack of lamb and my bf had ordered the duck confit..we were both getting super full from the appetizers (pretty big portions) that i could only eat one piece of lamb..i really enjoyed it as it was on top of a bed of quinoa and veggies..my bf enjoyed his duck confit as well..
For dessert, i ordered the coconut bread pudding and my bf ordered the banana cheesecake..we were both so stuffed from the meals that we only had a few bites as it was also accompanied by 3 assortment of cookies..the desserts were okay, if i had the choice, i wouldn't of ordered the dessert again but hey, to each their own.

This restaurant was great, even though like everyone has said, its in such a random location quite far from the strip..The only reason I put a 4 out of 5 was because of dessert as well as it being quite far from the strip..it was about a $37 cab ride including tip which almost came out to a meal in it of itself..if it were closer or you have a car, i would definitely recommend it more.

I had better food and a better time here than at Wynn's Daniel last time (food was good there but service was a bit stuffy).

We went on a Wednesday so it was Ladies Night which meant everything (except alcohol) was 50% off for ladies.  My party of four each got the 5-course chef's tasting menu (normally $65) and it was absolutely delicious.  We started off with rich salmon tartare topped with American caviar, followed by a giant bacon crusted scallop on top of yam and chestnut puree (yuMMMM), grilled sea bass, a medium rare grilled filet of beef (super tender and meaty in taste), and a trio of desserts.  Their goat cheese cheesecake is to die for - it's super smooth and rich in taste but the sweetness is not so overpowering that you want to wash it down with coffee immediately.   I wonder if I can order it via mail...hmmmmm.  

Their service also exceeded my expectation - attentive, friendly, and not overly pretentious (which I find annoying at Strip restaurants).  There's no sommelier pressuring you to order the most expensive wine on the list.  They were great with getting your chair every time we got up, replacing utensils at each course, etc.  Tables were nicely spaced so you can talk at a normal voice level without feeling like the next table is sitting in your lap.  Basically, laugh out loud if you want =)

I would definitely go back for dinner and also try their lunch prix-fixe ($25) on the weekdays if I have a chance.   Sunday is also half-price wine night!

Despite being located in the back of a tacky strip mall, Rosemary's was quite an elegant place to dine. The waiters brought by a black napkin to match my black pants (and refolded the napkins every time one of us got up from our chairs.) The lunch special included a choice of appetizer, main and dessert.

Everything was delicious. For appetizers we tried the Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag blue cheese coleslaw: a healthy serving of shrimp with a tasty BBQ sauce. The blue cheese coleslaw was fresh and went perfectly with the shrimp (think buffalo chicken gone gourmet.) The salads were also excellent, the mixed baby greens tossed in a champagne vinaigrette with smoked salmon, quail egg, capers, house-made cucumbers, and drizzles of saffron aioli, was delicious as well as the arugula, endive and radicchio salad with Maytag blue cheese, Riesling poached pear, toasted hazelnuts and port wine syrup. I highly recommend both options.

The vegetarian main of fresh mozzarella and slow roasted tomato stuffed eggplant ""packages"" with roasted red bell peppers, green olive relish, and smoked tomato butter sauce was a little disappointing. The eggplant hadn't been cooked long enough and was a bit tough and bitter. Still, the smoked tomato flavor was really delicious. The creole seasoned shrimp with Anson Mills Carolina cheesy quick grits, Andouille red bean sauce, and grilled green onion was amazing. The smokiness of the Andouille went really well with the dish. All the portions were large and it was difficult to conceive of dessert.

Even so, we finished our meal with the rustic apple tart with caramel sauce, candied walnuts and cinnamon ice cream, as well as a selection of sorbet (made in-house.) All were very good, with the apple tart being particularly delicious.

562445,2011-01-08,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Overall:

Rosemary's should bill itself as ""Fancy Style"" because this is not an authentic ""Nice Restaurant.""  

I would never return to Rosemary's again.  The food was unimpressive, the service wasn't as good as it should have been and the atmosphere was a mockery of a fine dining establishment.  

Food:  

The food was OK.  Of the eight or so things I tried I thought two were above average.  The bread they served was slathered with butter and that's always a good thing.  It was delicious, warm and a great way to start the meal.  The one thing I'd describe as memorable was the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw.  I'd order a plate of this and go home.

I tried two soups and wasn't blown away by either.  My appetizers were a beef carpachio, which was fine and sweetbreads which were chewy.  

My main course was scallops, which were horribly overcooked.  My friends ordered fish which was also overcooked.  None of my friends raved about their food except for one (you'll see why under the service section).

The food aimed to be ""high end"" but there was nothing innovative or interesting about this food. 

The drink selection was good, specifically beer.  The drinks were expensive but they had a top notch beer selection.

Atmosphere:  

Rosemary's is located in a strip-mall.  Even better, the light over the front door was flickering like one outside a cheap motel.  The artwork on the wall wasn't especially interesting or noteworthy.  There were some framed mirrors by the bar which felt like something out of Crate and Barrel.

My friends who recommended the place made it sound like it was about to receive a Michelin star but nothing could be farther from the truth.  In a city like Las Vegas, which is full of world-class restaurants, Rosemary's felt like the place in a small town were folks go for their anniversary.

There's a reason this place is three miles from where all the tourists are.

Service:

The service here aimed to be good but failed at the one thing that supposedly makes them unique.  When we were seated we were asked if there were any food allergies or requests.  This on one hand was very nice because we had several people with food differences.  On the other hand why not just wait until people order to ask such a sweeping question?  Also most people with food differences don't wait until they're asked to share so it seems like a nice question but it's actually quite dumb.

Most servers, when presented with a table full of people with food challenges, would be sure to note any foods that were ordered which have ""hidden meats"" like chicken stock or pork.  Two people, who do not eat ham, were served food with two kinds of bacon.  The server didn't think, ""Hey these people don't eat red meat... maybe that extends to bacon!""  Since she had pretended to care so deeply my friends ended up eating things they didn't want to.

This place makes a big show out of being ""fancy"" and their servers are instructed on how to act.  They put on a good show but nothing could hide the fact that our server wasn't comfortable talking to the customers and established no report with our jovial table.  

Value:

Rosemary's used quality ingredients in their food but cooked them poorly, did nothing interesting with the food rendering it a waste.  For the $55 I spent on dinner I could have gone to a much higher quality place and had slightly less food.  I don't need to be stuffed with badly cooked scallops and bread to feel I got my money's worth.",r_NUKM2IWbJqcQUZIgnlzg,1,0,2,enyfveDrN_2ad8TQiwvQAA
565904,2011-06-28,1,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"I recently organized a dinner event at Rosemary's for a large group and it was a great success--everyone loved it! The events and catering director, Jennifer, was friendly, experienced, accessible, and super helpful.  She remembered our group's last visit, which was 5 years ago, and was able to immediately send me the menus and information from last time. The menu she put together for me presented a nice variety of options (they offered far more entree options for the set menu than other restaurants would have offered for a group this size), and they were able to accommodate special requests as well as late additions and late arrivals.  There were absolutely no mixups with orders and requests and the waitstaff was professional and courteous, timing of the service was perfect (also, I noticed that four waiters would coordinate so all 8 people at each round table had their food placed in front of them at the exact same time), and our drinks and wine glasses stayed full the whole time.  

Everyone thought the food was excellent and kept talking about it!  The goat cheese salad, halibut, lamb chops with quinoa, creme brulee, and chocolate cream pie dessert with ice cream seemed to be the most popular options and they all got especially enthusiastic reviews!  The cocktails and passed appetizers we had before the meal were excellent as well.

We were in the west wing room, which was perfect for our group of about 30 people (although we could easily have added more and still had it be comfortable).

Prices are definitely much lower than you'd pay for comparable food on the Strip, too.

673525,2008-07-17,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Maybe it was my fault for reading all the great reviews and expecting too much.  I think the major problem was the (we're assuming) brand new waiter.  He was horrible.  He messed up our order on 4 different occasions on different people and courses as we all went prix fixe.  How hard is it on a slow night?  Also, he would stand right in front of you and put his face into yours when he was talking.  Hello personal space!!!  The food was ok, SeaBlue has a tasting menu special for $60 or so right now so I was kinda irritated that I could've received much better food for relatively the same price.  Also since this was for a birthday we weren't expecting much but the server comes out, nearly drops the dessert plate on the table, mumbles happy birthday and walks away.  I don't know if it was because he had made so many mistakes on our orders by then his mgr had a talk with him & he was taking it out on us, but it was unacceptable.   Since we were a table of 6 it was mandatory gratuity which was fine but then I had to tip out the bus girl or sous server another $40 because she was more help than our designated server and she deserved it.  It was an expensive meal for mediocre food and bad service.  The creme brulee did rock tho.",g4CPdjclmHZu53FhJuSRrA,0,0,3,ndxWNpuCxFTQ5fWnTo7QFw
676981,2010-05-09,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Love this place!  The food is truly Creole and reminds me of New Orleans.  Interestingly, one night I mentioned to Chef Michael Jordan that Rosemary's reminds me of Emeril's restaurant NOLA in New Orleans and Chef Jordan told me he opened that joint and was head chef there.  No wonder, the service here is reminiscent of any Emeril restaurant - just truly excellent.

I recommend the Prix Fixe menu.  The Texas shrimp appetizer is always divine.  Any fish entree is very good, as well as the steaks.  I usually get full after the entree so I get my dessert to go.  The goat cheesecake never disappoints.

The 3 o'clock club (http://3oclockclub.com) often has deals for Rosemary's - you can get a $100 gift card for $50.

My soup was a garlic parmesan with shaved chives, a special of the day.  Hubby had the scallops.  Both were excellent.
For entrees I had the daily special of a salmon over risotto....melt in your mouth and creamy....made me moan with the tastes it evoked.  Hubby had a fantastic veal chop over swiss chard.  Dessert was also very good, but I prefer the quality and the uniqueness of the food rather than the sweet stuff.

Waiters Joe and Matt were very helpful with information to guide our decision making as so many items sounded like what we would like.  Service overall was top notch....someone always there but without the hovering we have had in some places.  And on duty also was a very pleasant, helpful maitre'd.

It's one of the few restaurants we have gone to in Las Vegas where the meal is memorable and we know we will continue to return.

You can't beat the fixed price of $55 for 3 courses, especially when you will be getting top notch quality.  Comfortable seating, tables nicely spaced so it's not noisy.  Make recommendations to be sure of getting in.

It's a pricey cab ride from the strip...about $30...but if you have a car, don't miss going to Rosemary's.

When you walk in you are greeted to a very high end looking restaurant. The menu's are always changing and the chef's tastings never let me down.  The food is great and the 50 dollar prefix dining a definite steal.  One of the things I always tells friends to pay attention to is the detail to service.  I've went several times in a party of 2 and a few times in a party of 6 or more.  Each time, no matter how many people are in your party, the staff attends to your every detail.

737473,2010-03-24,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Rosemary's has always had stellar reviews on Yelp and Chowhound so I wanted to try it for myself. The opportunity to do so came when I was in town with some girlfriends. We were staying at Red Rock so it was just a few miles away. 

When I walked in I thought the place looked a little suburban. I was not expecting much. Boy was I wrong!! Everything about that meal -from the food to the service to the call afterward to see if we enjoyed our meal - was amazing. 

We all went with the three course prix fixe menu. Since I am not a big dessert person you can order two apps and a main meal. I got the steak tartare for my first app. It was just perfect. I've had a lot of steak tartare through the years and as simple as the dish is, it is very easy to screw up. Not this time. Just perfectly seasoned and presented beautifully. It was one of the best steak tartares I have ever had. 

Speaking of presentation, I really enjoyed the coordinated serving of each dish. We were a group of 6 and every course was served simultaneously. I always think that is a nice touch. 

I then got the scallops with prosciutto and they also were great. Perfectly cooked and served over a delicious cous cous. I tried the cauliflower soup and risotto that my friends were having and both were excellent. 

I ordered the veal as the main dish at the waiter's recommendation. Again, it was flawless. The meat was cooked at the perfect temperature and served with the delicious lentils. I was so full from the other two dishes (the portions are very large) that I could not finish, though it did make for an excellent breakfast. 

The rest of our group also loved their food. We were all stuffed at the end. 

The service was wonderful. Roberto took very good care of us and was attentive without being too intruding or aloof. 

As we were driving back to LA after a fun filled weekend, Rosemary's called us to see if the meal was to our liking. I really enjoy when a restaurant goes that extra mile. There is no doubt I will be back and make the trip out to Rosemary's again. Thanks for a great meal.",fl0c5nPHTJ2zydFWFWqiIw,0,0,5,ooc4LAj8vsDgBxn4jshFHQ

 From the bus boy to the Manageress, everyone we encountered was really friendly and courteous.


 We chose from the fixed price lunch menu at $23 each for 3 courses. At the Doller exchange rate at the time that equalled around £15. terrific value!


 I had Arugela Endive and Raddiccio salad with poached pears and Maytag blue Cheese, A Monte Christo Ham & Cheese with slivers of Onion Rings and my dessert was an Apple Tart with Cinnamon Ice Cream and Hot Caramel sauce.


 My wife had Texas BBQ Shrimp, Soy marinated Beef Kabobs and a Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.

My wife and I taxi'd out on a Sat. night (downside -- it's about 15-minute cab ride from the strip, so will cost $25-30 each way). As others note, the strip mall location is not impressive, but once you step inside you forget about that.

I chose their Texas Shrimp appetizer, which was a bunch of bbq shrimp on a pile of coleslaw which had been mixed with bleu cheese. Fantastic, I'd go back for that alone. My entree was the pork chop, which was the only non-stellar part of the meal (it was however very good). Next time out, I'm going for the lamb chops. Dessert was fantastic, I got some kind of chocolate bomb. We waddled out to the taxi at the end of the meal.

The wait staff are very attentive and will take all the time you need to explain dishes to you. The wine selection is excellent, and although I did drink wine, I noted they have some excellent beer on tap as well.

Overall, the food was quite good.  We all ordered the prix fixe option, which is three courses for $55.  This is a great value, particularly for the quality and quantity of the food.  For my appetizer, I got the twice-baked Parmesan souffle.  This was the low point of the meal for me, but still not bad.  Nothing to write home about, flavor was ok.  For my entree, I got the pork chop.  I don't eat pork too much, but this was very good.  Pork seems like it's difficult to cook well, but this was well-cooked, flavorful and juicy.  Also, the portion was huge.   The best part of the meal however, was the dessert.  I ordered the dark chocolate bread pudding, which was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever had.  This was a special that they were running, but if you like dark chocolate, ask if they have it, it's AMAZING.  My three dining partners ordered the prix fixe as well, and everyone was very complimentary of their meals, two got the steak entree, one got the lamb.

The only caution that I would give is that there is absolutely nothing ""Vegas"" about this place.  It's quite a ways from the strip, dimly lit, in a strip mall.  It was definitely an older crowd as well.  There's nothing wrong with this, but if you're looking for a trendy Vegas experience, this is definitely not it.  It's just really good food.  The only complaint I had, which is small, is that they kind of bombard you with service.  They had two people assigned to our table, and seemed to interrupt us several times to announce that they were refilling the water and stuff like that.

Of course, you won't beleive that when you get there and see it's in a mini-mall across from a Wendy's, but hey, go inside and see.  

I've been here a few times.  I've always ordered their prix fixe, which is one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.   I usually prefer getting the BBQ shrimp for the starter, ribeye or pork chop for the meal, and the chocolate something for dessert.  They usually add in-between items between courses (I know there's a name for that) that are very tasty as well.  Last time we had chocolate strawberrys and various chocolates before (or was it after) dessert.   

You will leave this place full, and wonder why can't other restaurants be like this in Vegas.

For only $25 at lunch, you get a choice of an appetizer, a main course, and dessert.  you'd think you would only have a minimal selection in each couse, but actually there are quite a bit of choices and any specials of the day can be included.  i mean there are things like bbq shrimp, butternut squash soup for starters.  there are grilled mah-mahi, filet kabobs (which my lovely date enjoyed), and stuffed eggplant for entrees.  Finally, they have chocolate flourless cake, creme brulee, and coconut bread pudding.
my favorite appetizer that i recommend anybody to start with is the dry aged beef with maytag blue cheese carpaccio with a arugula & granny smith apple salad and dabbled with candied walnuts.  if you get each item in your mouth it's just a wonderful medley.
i always follow with the really really crispy leg of duck confit on a bed of lentils with brandy green peppercorn sauce.   i just love the crispiness and saltiness of the meat.  i just wish they would put another duck leg in there for all the lentils they put on that dish.  
usually i end the meal w/a very light dessert like the trio of sorbet, but this time i decided to go heavy with the goat cheesecake.  it had a lot more kick because of strong flavor of the goat cheese and was sweetened up by the scotch caramel sauce.
my lovely date, also pointed out that the service was ""amazingly fabulous!""  they work as a team.  they are very attentive to pushing your chair in, folding your napkins when you leave, refilling your water, delivering your food, and setting up your table.

Food (In order of appearance): 
-Vegetable Cake - A little croquette-like gift from the chef to start off the meal. Nice touch.
-Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp w/Blue Cheese Slaw - Figured I had to try this since everyone raves about it, but not sure I would order it again.  The BBQ sauce was amazing, but everything else was just average. 
-Arugula salad with cranberry vinaigrette, blue cheese sauce, chantarelle mushrooms, and duck breast - There was too much going on here for my tastes. The vinaigrette was good, but too sweet.  Blue cheese sauce was too thick. Mushrooms were delicious but seemed a little out of place.  Duck breast was tender and yummy.  Not sure how all of these elements work together though. 
-Creole Grilled Prime Ribeye - The house made steak sauce really made this dish. It was sweet, smokey, and made the perfectly cooked medium rare ribeye taste great.
-Flourless chocolate cake with peanut butter sauce and banana ice cream - Great combo. I thought the chocolate cake was going to be warm, but it wasn't. Still rich, sweet and delicious. I could have used more peanut butter sauce. 
-Dessert sampler - On the house. Peanut butter rice krispy bite (my favorite), lemon bar, flourless chocolate cake. 

Ambiance: Cozy, intimate, inviting. It is pretty much one big room with tables and chairs.  It would have been nice to have more privacy.  

Service: Stellar. Attentive, efficient, friendly, knowledgeable. Couldn't ask for more.

The chef's tasting menus have never let us down, and the wine selection is one of the best in the city.

For the tourists in Vegas, it might be a $15 - $20 taxi ride (each way) in which I might not suggest it's worth that much trouble.

There was an exciting and unusual set of selections. From the Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio and the Tasso Ham and Crawfish Risotto appetizers, to the Salmon entree and the coconut bread pudding, we found every bite to be a delight and a wonder. I almost wish I could live in Vegas so I could go to Rosemary's regularly and try everything they make. 

Try it. You will LOVE it. We did! Best in Vegas!",Newot9g209R-OI7IwV4SUg,1,0,5,DEX43fRTWWlfc9jY66ip4g

1144257,2009-10-12,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"On a recent pre-conference night my wife and I convinced four colleagues to join us for an off-the-Strip dining adventure at Rosemary's. What a night!

We all went for the $55 prix fixe - what a deal! Each of us ordered something different, and we sampled and shared our dishes. Collective voting placed the prosciutto-wrapped figs and goat cheese and the shrimp with blue cheese slaw in a tie for best appetizer. Entrees were not voted on, as everyone felt that their individual choice was the best (three veal tenderloins, and one each salmon, rib eye and striped bass).  My wife saved one of her three course choices for dessert, and she ordered the lemon ice box cake and graciously requested six forks!

The excellent wine list was a bit pricey but we found a very good Pinot Noir at the low end of the list. They also have an ""Under $50"" list which doesn't show up on the web site.  On our next visit to Vegas, I would go on a Sunday night (half-price wine) to explore some of the pricier bottles. 

All in all it was a fabulous meal, with service to match. (Thank you, Tony!) Every dish was meticulously seasoned and plated - and tasted as good as it looked.  When I got back to Chicago I ordered three copies of their cookbook as Christmas gifts.

1227280,2011-03-29,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Yeah, so far Las Vegas has a great track record with me! Giving out five-star reviews left and right. Well, I don't mean to sound like the girl who yelped wolf, but Rosemary's definitely, DEFINITELY deserves five stars.

It's in a strip mall about 15 minutes away from the strip (first plus). The windows are tinted, almost black even, and you can't see inside from the outside. You walk in and it's this amazingly cozy, warm atmosphere, with servers dancing (not literally) around tables making everyone's evening as pleasant as possible.

I came here with my husband, daughter, husband's boss and boss' family (wife and two kids, 17 and 7). While Rosemary's is by no means a ""family"" restaurant, they were extremely accommodating of our party. I've come to learn just how annoying it is to have babies in restaurants sometimes. Not like I didn't already know this...but I'm always more self-conscious of it now. The staff at Rosemary's acted like the kids were the guests of honor, which was so sweet. They even brought a silver cover for my meal so it wouldn't get cold when I had to tend to the little one away from the table. Very classy all around.

I should mention that the restaurant offers two different prix-fixe options nightly (app/app/entree or app/entree/dessert) in lieu of paying per item. There was also an amuse bouche, which, as I think back to all my dining experiences, I've only had a handful of times, and signals to me a special restaurant that's really got its shit together.

To start, I had the cauliflower soup. I know what you're thinking: what's the big deal? It was A BIG DEAL. Delicious, rich, like nobody ever thought cauliflower could be. Creamy, with a sprinkling of parmesan and a swirl of olive oil. Decadent, really!

Then I had the salmon on a bed of lentils. It was cooked PERFECTLY medium-rare (and the server mentioned this is how it is normally done and asked if that was ok). It had a flavorful, crunchy crust that was not overwhelming and didn't detract from the joy of the fish itself. The lentils were dressed lightly in some kind of lemony deliciousness. Yep, a real culinary vocabulary I've got. Anyway, they were great. I also got a really great white wine that the waiter suggested I pair with these dishes. (Pairing recommendations are offered on the menu for each dish.) 

For dessert, I decided not to order something else to eat, but rather, a ""fifth avenue"" dessert cocktail, consisting of cream, apricot brandy, and creme de cacao. Wowza! That was strong and delicious. There were a bunch of other drink options available, and the desserts looked wonderful too.

Overall, Rosemary's seems like a very well-kept secret, except that the word has apparently gotten out. Go for a special evening, go for a relaxed drink at the bar ... just go!",Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,0,0,5,v82EAzTMcvyI4Lo6n1vmGg
1228800,2007-09-04,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"For some reason, my friends and I thought that Rosemary's Restaurant is in the Sahara Hotel.  It is not.  Instead, it is hidden away in a small business complex with very little signage on the outside.  However, once inside, you will be treated to as good a dining ambiance as any - although I would not say that it was terribly romantic.  

Since we had dinner on Sunday all bottles of wine are half off so we ordered a Burgundy Pinot Noir.  The wine was nice.  My friend commented that the prices may have been a little inflated but the half-price was nice.  We all ordered pris-fixe meals that cost $50 for an entree plus two dishes (either appetizers, soup, salad).  The appetizers were good including stuffed figs, which were a little too creamy for me but extremely tasty; salmon tartare - standard salmon tartare but very well done.  The beef carpaccio we had was good but I also had that earlier in the day for lunch and it was better then - Country Club restaurant at Wynn.  This was due to the blue cheese overpowering the beef.  

I was a bit disappointed by the entrees.  Admittedly, I allowed the waiter to convince me to order the seared tuna which has never been a favorite of mine.  It came nicely prepared - raw with the top and bottom seared.  However, it was relatively tasteless.  The only entree worth mentioning was the scallops which were fresh and tasty.  One of my friends doesn't like ham so she ordered it without the prosciutto and I still found it to be extremely tasty.  The halibuts we ordered were very bland.  

We had desserts but all of them were pretty normal.  I would say comparable to eating the desserts at a buffet in Vegas.  Nice but not great.  

Overall, I enjoyed my dinner here but the food wasn't so amazing that I would ever crave going back there.  I recommend the restaurant but I would suggest people not to go in with incredible expectations - which is what other reviews seem to indicate.",jljERGzkhzlFT5F6A8q95g,2,1,3,AH8799heXKq_5N2rQEkQmA
1264538,2007-09-26,2,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Rosemary's deserves the full 5 stars for more than one reason. I had read about Rosemary's and liked some of the different dishes on their menu and so had booked a meal at this off Strip restaurant, allowing lots of time to get to Penn & Teller at the Rio for their evening performance.

Unfortunately, the cab driver from my hotel had no idea where he was going and dropped me off in the wrong place. After 15 minutes of searching, I found out that I was in the wrong place, miles from the restaurant. As I hate being late for reservations, I rang Rosemary's to advise them about my delay and that I would try to get another cab. Well, I must have caught the companies at peak period and there wasn't a cab to be had for love nor money.

After 30 minutes of increasingly desperate ringing, I rang Rosemary's back. The person on the end of the phone said not to worry and that they would try and get me a cab and they would ring me back. After 5 minutes, she rang back to say that they couldn't get a cab but that one of their regulars was on her way to pick me up!!!! A delightful lady duly arrived and we had a great natter in the car on the way over to the restaurant. What unbelievable service!

At the restaurant, they assured me that they would serve my food in time for me to catch my show and that they had already sorted out a cab for my trip to the Rio. If that was all they did, I would already be tempted to award them 5 stars for customer service above and beyond the call of duty alone.

However, the food just reinforced the 5 star rating. I gather that Rosemary's used to be located at one of the big hotels - well, it's their loss. This food is vibrant, it's full of flavour, it's different and it's confident in itself.

I plumped for the prix fixe dinner where there is a good choice of appetizers and entree with some choices attracting a supplementary charge. At my server's suggestion, I settled for one of the restaurant's signature appetizers - Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp. A flavourful interpretation of an old american favourite. I had the rack of lamb for entree and the meat was cooked perfectly. I'm afraid I can't remember the name of my dessert but a lovely sweet ending to the meal.

As it was such a fraught evening for me, the restaurant gave me some special home made chocolates to take away and enjoy at the show. Special people and definitely worth the trip off the Strip.",OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,8,9,5,jjEWqquvRTGzDXoEs7ivyw

The service was really courteous with our waiters. 

However i think this place deserves a 3-star because of my seating experiences.

The first time i was there it was quite busy, but i had made a request prior my second visit. I must say that i find the size of the dinning room/ kitchen to be quite tiny and the kitchen here is just not aesthetic enough to look at all night.

1557856,2011-04-08,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"What a strange, wonderful place. Definitely the best restaurant in a strip mall I've ever been to! Also, they had a ""lady's night?"" So my wife ate for half price. Las Vegas is an odd town; I totally am willing to accept that the ""good"" places in Vegas are all scattered about in assuming locations like strip malls, while the glitz of the main drag is all flash & no substance. At Rosemary's, I started with Harvistoun Old Engine Oil, a thick dark Scottish beer that I can't remember if I've had it before? I know I've had the Harvistoun Ola Dubh & hadn't been all that knocked out by it-- or rather, it hadn't lived up to the expectations that I had for it. Anyhow, for dinner we got the chef's tasting menu with the beer pairings-- a well cultivated beer list was a big part of why Jenny chose this place. Our first course was baby arugula in Meyer lemon vinaigrette with sliced salmon gravlax, shaved red onion, fried capers & braised leek cream, & the beer matched with it was a Belgian, Tripel Karmeliet. The second course was the star of the menu, if you ask me-- fried veal sweetbreads with foie gras butternut squash quinoa & bloody mary butter sauce. Oh, heck yeah, glands. The beer was Indian Wells Mojave Red-- take note of Indian Wells, because they have a nice output. I'm normally ""over"" reds, but I liked this. Course three was seared pompano with parsnip & potato puree, crispy proscuitto, parsnip strips & an apple cide beurre blanc. That came with Unibroue Ephemere Apple, which knocked our socks off. It is a really apple-tasting beer, & reminded us of our dear Professor Fritz Briem Grut. We kept bugging our server to tell us more about it & making him run back to their beer sommelier. The main course-- oof, I was stuffed by the time it came-- was roasted rack of lamb with swiss chard, caramelized red onions & garlic reduction. It came with the Devastator Doppelbock which was lighter in colour than I expected but had the requisite punch. Desert was chocolate cream pie, crème brûlée, & a Framboise Lambic ice cream float.

1585032,2009-10-26,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Last weekend, my husband and I celebrated his birthday by taking a trip to Las Vegas. We drove out Friday morning, spent the afternoon relaxing by the pool, and enjoyed a perfect meal at Rosemary's, a quaint restaurant located about 20 minutes from the strip.

When you enter the restaurant, you step into a world that is beyond the simple strip mall you entered. The scenery is romantic and classy. A bar on the right boasts top shelf liquors, along with a few specialty beers on tap. A cocktail before dinner is the perfect start to the evening, and I suggest any beer lover enjoy a pint of the Tripel Karmelite.

The dining room reveals comfort and luxury paired with exquisite service. Rosemary's offers all dishes a la carte, or you can enjoy their prix-fixe dinner, containing three courses, for $55. Everyone in our party of four opted for the prix-fixe dinner as most entrees were priced between $30 and $45, so it seemed to be the best deal.

For my appetizer, I chose the Tasso Ham and Crawfish Risotto with Smoked Tomato Jus. The dish was moist but not mushy, with a subtle smokiness from the tomato jus and the perfect amount of salt from the tasso ham. The crawfish was perfectly cooked and decadent--not fishy. I also sampled the Salmon Tartar, which was very fresh and perfectly seasoned. The Twice Baked Parmesean Souffle and the Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes were both rich, indulgent dishes best for sharing. Overall, the consensus was that the risotto was the favorite appetizer of the night.

For the salad course, the Arugula, Endive & Radiccio Salad came with Maytag Blue Cheese, a Riesling Poached Pear, Toasted Hazelnuts & Port Wine Syrup. The pepper in the arugula complimented the tart blue cheese and the sweet poached pear for a perfect combination of flavors. The Caesar for Mark salad came with Parmesean croutons and a fresh Caeser dressing with anchovies. While some of the diners at my table found it to be too fishy, I thought the dressing was exceedingly fresh and a perfect combination. The croutons, while tasty, were too large to be eaten in one bite, and therefore a challenge.

For the entree, I chose the Seared Sea Scallops with Parsnip Potato Puree, Apple Cider Beurre Blanc, Crispy Prosciutto & Fried Parsnip Strips. When I dine out, I often try to stay away from beef, even though I love it, because I am usually disappointed after being spoiled with the my husband's cooking. The scallops were the right choice. They were perfectly cooked--tender on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside--and the parsnip potatoes were rich and creamy. However, I also sampled the Grilled Veal Tenderloin, served with a Sauté of Asparagus, Prosciutto & Maitake Mushrooms & Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce. The veal was tender and succulent, cooked to perfection and complemented with the reduction sauce. Though not a traditional steakhouse, Rosemary's Roasted Filet of Beef stood up to the rest of the menu after being seasoned and cooked perfectly with a bourbon green peppercorn sauce, and complemented with horseradish souffle potatoes.

For dessert, I enjoyed the chef's special of the night--a Passion fruit cheesecake with pomegranate sauce. I also sampled a platter of miniature desserts, including a lemon bar, peanut butter crisp, and mint chocolate fudge. All were delicious, and the perfect cap to an excellent meal.

In addition to the fabulous food, the service was wonderful. The sommelier was attentive and helpful, as was our waitress. The waitstaff presented each course in sync, serving each dish at the same time and allowing ample time in between courses. Water and wine glasses were kept full, napkins placed gently on laps and every other need met graciously.

Overall, Rosemary's provided one of the most exquisite meals I have ever enjoyed, and it is a Las Vegas restaurant not to be missed.",u8tmRUxZzMRaE4X7X_0fwA,1,0,5,2Xjkj3wQOtBFW8Hr5zD87g

1760170,2009-06-17,1,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Dear Las Vegas, 
You nearly killed me this weekend with your all night gambling, drinking, dancing, and all day pool parties at pretentious spots like Tao Beach, but you revived me with a trip to Rosemary's restaurant waaayyyy off the strip!  We had a party of six and were seated in a more private part of the restaurant.  It was the best service I have ever experienced.  The multiple servers were incredibly attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  On to the food -- delicious does not even begin to describe the food!  I decided to get the 5 course tasting menu ($80 without alcohol).  The first dish was a duo of tartars -- salmon and beef tartar.  It was served with a few capers, a light lemon yuzu, and crisps to eat all the delicious yumminess. Course two was a Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with emulsified ravigote sauce and sweet and sour cucumbers.  They cucumbers were the perfect addition to the fried boulettes.  Course three was sesame seared arctic char served with sho-mai vegetable slaw and ginger soy butter sauce.  I could have had three servings of this because it was soooo good.  By course four, I thought I was going to die, but I had a little talk with my stomach and managed to devour the roasted rack of lamb served with kalamata olive mashed potatoes and fried arugula.  Course five was a trio of desserts -- creme brulee (perfect), a mini chocolate cream pie (good but not memorable), and a shot of a framboise shake (a take on a rootbeer float but made with framboise beer -- delicious!).  Other diners had the ribeye and said it was the best they had ever had (and they regularly dine at place like Cut, BLT, STK, Morton's, etc.)  Everyone said it was one of the best meals they had ever had.  So, Vegas, you may have taken my money at the blackjack table, but I definitely won the culinary battle.
Sincerely,
Still Recovering in Los Angeles",pdTSWWs4eEjgUlJHk6umWQ,2,1,5,wqHYkCv_8bK5g5QtCaTzZg

mayo, mustard, pecans

Service was strange, literally had two servers looking over our shoulder the entire meal, lost track of the amount of times they scraped crumbs from the table. 

Beef tenderloin was well cooked but the bourdelaise was just way too sweet, like almost ruining the meal.

1844245,2009-01-15,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"My boss and I casually heard about this place while we were working in Vegas for the week... We heard it was the best this and that and the other thing, it was in some strip mall of Sarah 15 mins from the strip, blah blah blah... We had Sunday off so we caught a movie and decided to bop over to Rosemary's. I had a beanie and a white T-Shirt on and I felt pretty confident walking into what I thought was some mom and pop restaurant next to the DOLLAR TREE in a STRIP CENTER. 

We opened the doors to one of the nicest restaurants I have ever set foot in. I immediately felt ashamed in my dingy Sunday-worst clothing, but strangely not uncomfortable. 

From the onset my boss and I were treated with the utmost respect and care. We were seated immediately on a Sunday night (half off wine night!!) around 9pm. This restaurant is highly professional and our waiter was the poster boy for professional service. 

We were brought rolls followed by some foie gras. The wine started flowing and our apps arrived. My boss got Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp, and it was incredible. 5 Shrimp... this thing was an entree! I got a Crawdad Risotto, and not only was it an entree itself  it was so incredibly rich and flavorful that I could have ordered it again and called it a night. 

The special of the house that night was the short ribs and my boss got that... I am not a fan of short ribs, but apparently they were wonderful. I got the Creole Grilled Center Cut New York Strip. I usually never order steak at a restaurant, but this was just perfect and cooked medium just to my liking. I couldn't even eat half of it though because of the giant apps, but it was excellent.  

Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, we got the Prix-Fixe style meal so we HAD to get dessert. This is where Rosemary's sealed the deal for me. Three words: Goat Cheese Cheesecake. I can never eat mere COW Cheesecake again. I would consider driving back to Vegas just to eat this dessert again. My boss got some Chocolate Bread Pudding or something... GOAT CHEESE CHEESECAKE PEOPLE!  

Overall this place is one of the best ever. Perfect mix of high class and casual candor, impeccable service, and extraordinary food. Take a cab, hitch a ride, or run to Rosemary's from the Strip, and you will NOT be disappointed.",2y4GB6HVyYTeryoF0pPLog,3,2,5,GDFPyvNk559nLYX3Lpe0uA

Thats a lot of words, but the most important ones are SAFFRON BEURRE BLANC.  Wow!  Forget everything else on the plate--this was clearly the star.  Multidimensional, dynamic, deep, and just perfect.  Drizzle this on some old, soiled newspapers and I'll still eat it.  Its that good.

I started off with Foie Gras (wasn't on the menu) and must say it was different, more on the sweet side, but it was a pleasant surprise. The Tasso Ham & Crawfish Risotto was delicious.The Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle was fluffy, creamy and quite good as well. 

For the main course, The Cashew Crusted Salmon with the creamed potatoes and some type of butter sauce was light and executed right. I also tried the Grilled Pork Chop,it was nicely portioned and the reduction sauce went hand in hand with the chops. 

Creme Brulee for dessert, just plain perfect

I would also like to mention that the presentation of all the dishes were beautiful. 

Most importantly, The Service. Let me tell you, I have never been to a restaurant where each staff member I encountered were so eager to please (and I've been to a fair share of restaurants). Their hospitality here is second to none! 

Examples of Outstanding Service: 
Our glass of water never reached half full

I had left my cocktail at the bar while waiting to be seated, went out to the parking lot, went back in the restaurant (about 15 minutes later), got seated and then the bartender approaches the table and brings me my drink

We took a smoke break before dessert and when walking back into the restaurant there were both our napkins folded on our table and  2 servers both with our chairs pulled out waiting to slide it in as we sat

Everytime a plate was set on the table there were 2 servers (1 on each side) placing down our plates in sync and briefly describing the dish

I took a quick bathroom break, came back to see my napkin neatly folded on the table 

We were brought bite sized appetizers a couple times during the meal compliments of the chef

Sunday is half price bottle of wine night, enough said. 
Seriously, this husband and wife chef team opened a place on the west side of town that is sublime. Order ANYTHING on the menu, in fact close your eyes and randomly point to things on the menu and have the dedicated amazing staff bring it out to you, I promise, you will eat every bite.

The staff of this place treats you with the utmost care, I haven't been to a place in a casino that treats you this way.

2069705,2008-05-13,3,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"The taxi ride was longer than I remembered, but that was probably because any recollection I had of Rosemary's was about the food. Twenty minutes off the Strip, Rosemary's graces its own strip (mall), where Chefs Michael and Wendy Jordan continue to rival any contortionist Cirque show for creativity and flawless execution. 

A flash of Mary Poppins extracting a coat rack from her carpetbag flooded my mind as I stepped from molten asphalt into a bath of beige and black. Somehow this desert mirage remained immune to the venom Vegas spit on the Strip. There was a whiff of reality here (along with deep breaths of garlic) and our initial steps inward lowered our temperature 10 degrees. 

They had expanded the space since my last visit in 2003 and it suited them well. An outstretched bar beckoned us with an array of elixirs and Venetian tendencies (as in Venice, Italy, not the Venetian, Vegas), basing neutral hues behind vibrant artwork. This ""breath of fresh air entrance"" flowed into the warm yellows and soft sconces of the dining room. 

Our twenty something waitress was enthusiastic, but much too comfortable with her use of the word ""sucked,"" which hacked through the fine dcor like a pick axe. Her dialectic destruction was buffed out by the open arms of an amuse bouche and I accepted the crispy wanton topped with salmon mousse and citrus aioli as a refreshing, bite-sized ""welcome"". Choices of bread like pecan wheat or macadamia white chocolate also opened with gregarious ""how-do-you- dos."" 

Besides ""gutter mouth gal"", service was a highlight here and a main reason for my return. Collaboration of courses played out in a choreographed routine, where waiters lifted silver covers and distributed plates in unison. Jazz hands- appetizers had arrived. Smitten as kittens we mewed with delight at the saucers placed before us, but upon tasting the first option, hissing (and spitting) became more our demeanor. 

Hugo's Texas BBQ shrimp with Maytag blue cheese slaw was a Hugo disappointment. Smokey was the bandit, unmentioned and unwelcome, in the barbeque sauce with its distinct embers lingering on my palate like match-heads. I was more disappointed by an insufficient menu description than the actual dish (some people like smoky) and this formidable food decision weighed on my mind as heavily as the soggy, blue cheese slaw accompanying it. 

The grass wasn't much greener on the salad side. I thought I was down at the boon docks with the smell that emanated from my Caesar and though anchovies are a necessary component for this classic, they in no way should be the prominent flavor (or smell). 

I hesitated to think that maybe my idea of the food was remembered too grandly from either multiple bottles of wine or a love for this opulent oasis, but then it appeared as a bird? A plane? No...Fabulous Fig! Donning a proscuitto cape and accompanied by his goat cheese sidekick (stuffed, snuggly inside), this salty, sweet superhero saved the day (a triumphant cheer went out over the crowd) and just like that, the cogs of this well (olive) oiled machine slid back into place. 

Possibly to make up for my prior disappointments, culinary karma delivered one of the most prolific entres ever to grace my lips. I believe that day my journal entry read, ""Today I became a woman."" Their veal filet had me throwing my head back and grunting involuntarily, similar to the overplayed scene from ""When Harry met Sally..."" Green lentils exploded like salty sparklers and bacon confetti rained on the sherry mustard butter sauce like it was a holiday- it sure felt like one. This could possibly be the best piece of meat I've ever had (#1 meat entree nationwide). 

The rack of lamb also managed magnificent feats of flavor, seeping natural juices into Kalamata olive mashed potatoes and blending with the rosemary bordelaise (a reduction of red wine, shallots and demi-glace) to form a potent jus.

We didn't have room for dessert, but that didn't matter- they brought it anyway. Peanut butter truffles, dark chocolate truffles and lemon squares were presented as their ""after dinner amuse bouche"" and was a tasty metaphor that symbolized what Rosemary's brought to the table- tangible appreciation. 

Playing to each olfactory sense, Rosemary's fine tuned performance gave an experience, rather than a meal. Even our two unfavorable selections were forgiven like a teenager's bad attitude, squashed by the overall success of the show. Somehow Rosemary's continues to elicit one of Vegas's most jaw dropping (and closing) illusions, where humble elegance outshines the neon bulbs.

Starting with the bar... awesome wine list and one of the best beer selections I've ever seen... coolest part is that they serve your beer with the authentic class that it was intended for it.  Very nice touch.  Also about the bar you can eat there or at the 4 or 5 two person high tops.  This makes for a nice dinner without feeling the need to be too fancy [as in the dining area].

The dining room is split into two areas the first of which has the California style open kitchen.  This makes it easy to see real professional chefs at work (Michael Jordan and his wife).  Michael trained under Legase and I believe his wife in New Orleans.  The combination makes an awesome menu (which they update very often).  Whatever the Prix Fixe menu offers is always great.

Just a few of my favorite standards:

Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp (based on family recipe) - awesome
Any Risotto on the menu (changes) - awesome
Proscuito Crusted Salmon (one of my fiances favorites) - awesome
Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw (one of the great sides) - super

Also important... ladies nite is Wednesday and everything is 1/2 off for them.  Sundays is 50% off all bottled wine.  Final note, sign up for the various wine and beer tasting events they have... they pair great food and great wine and I've never been sorry.  Neither will you be.

The Parmesan Souffle was a great starter - light, fluffy, flavorful with this amazing shitake mushroom cream sauce and creamed leeks on the side. The Flat Iron Steak fell short - a little dry and covered in ""Rosemary's Own Steak Sauce"". This sauce just tasted like A1 to me, but maybe I don't have a refined palette. I did enjoy the mushrooms and asparagus on the sides and the dish was plated beautifully. Lastly the Creme Brulee - Simple and very tasty. They also wrote Happy Birthday along the edge of the plate and served it with a candle.

2206286,2011-05-25,4,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"This is a review of their small plates lounge menu.

The Skinny: Poor execution ruins what could have been a great dish (2.5), service: impeccable even at the bar with lovely touches like an amuse bouche, bread service and mignardises (4) value: due to the poor execution, the bar food isn't something I'd return for... the prixe fixe is a better tasting meal overall (2).

It pains me to no end to write this review.

Here's the story: it's been a while since we've hit Rosemary's (too many restaurants, so little time) so we were excited when we saw that they were putting out a small plates menu for the lounge. So the hubs dutifully went to Costco and purchased their gift certificates ($100 for $79.99). It is pretty impossible to spend all of the money on one go (it's a lot of food), so we tried about 70% of their savory menu on two visits. (please check out the pics for info on individual menu items).

The good - even though we were sitting at the bar, we received great service by the staff. It was also nice that they offered amuse bouches, bread service (love the still warm white chocolate pecan roll) as well as a small plate of mignardises (lemon bars are my favs). You simply do not get this kind of service at any other happy hour bar menu anywhere else.

The bad and the ugly - the best thing on the menu were the things that required the least cooking (ie, the cheese plate and the deli meat plate). Given our past experiences here, I was surprised by the quality of dishes we tasted.

From the poorly grilled scallop (burnt in places, lacking a nice golden crust) served with a flavourless quinoa to the odd duo of tartars (too many ingredients mixed into the dish made you lose the aroma of the beef and salmon - plus the hard boiled egg it was scooped in kind of overwhelmed the food), there is clearly an execution issue here. Their version of a croque madame was one huge soggy mess. The quesadilla was overly heavy due to the avocado and really needed some acidity to provide balance.

In addition to the execution issues, there are also problems with how certain things were thought out. Who the hell wants to eat french fries shaved so thin that it's hard to eat even with a fork (plus, it loses it's crispiness quickly)? Or have a caesar salad crouton that is so big that you can't even get your mouth around let alone cut? Or a filet slider served overloaded with weird Asian flavoured pickles (I think the burger could potential receive signals from outer space) that don't go well with the burger at all?

I wanted to really love their bar menu but it was nothing but a disappointment. If it was for the service alone, I'd give this place a four but unfortunately the food just didn't hold up to standards of the dining room.

2227490,2010-10-14,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Rosemary's Restaurant has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the highest rated Las Vegas restaurants on Yelp.  With over 240 reviews and a 4.5 star average, I felt comfortable planning a reception here and was excited to finally try their food.

First off though, service is definitely the attribute that distinguishes Rosemary's from the rest.  Although they are typically closed on Sundays for lunch, they agreed to open their whole restaurant for our small party and to give us a private room.  

They then proceeded to customize the menu according to the favorites we had heard about on Yelp and were always quick to reply, respond, and help.  

The day of the lunch, their staff was professional, friendly, and flexible.  Food came out promptly and was hot and delicious.  I personally thought the meal was quite good and was happy with all I ordered.

Hugo's Texas Shrimp - this is definitely only for blue cheese fans, but the shrimp came out moist and delectable with the tasty BBQ sauce and was served on a wonderful bed of slaw flavored with blue cheese.  The blue cheese and BBQ sauce worked very well together and I see why this is a fan favorite.

Rack of Lamb - Normally a dinner item, Rosemary's was happy to include it on our lunch menu for no additional charge.  Two large pieces of lamb came out that were cooked medium rare.  The sauce was a slightly sweet combination that went went with the meat.  A solid entree.  I loved the diced olived and mash potatoes that accompanied the lamb.

Apple Tart - a warm apple tart was served with a cookie and caramel ice cream.  I found the tart to be lacking apple, but liked the cookie and ice cream.

Despite it's strip mall location and off-the-strip location (about 10 miles), Rosemary's is definitely worth the visit.  The value here is fantastic, including prix fixe lunch menus and $55 prix fixe dinner menus and you'll definitely get more than you could at a mediocre hotel restaurant.  

We look forward to returning the next time we are in Las Vegas and thank Rosemary's for their great service and hospitality.

2236568,2009-07-02,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Rosemary's was one of the nicest meals I've ever taken part in. I had the Texas Striped Bass with Grits and some delicious brownies at the end, and my girlfriend had the Fettucini.

We also got an added bonus with our meal - painful sickness. Both of us were physically sick, her during the meal, and both of us in the days afterwards. While the staffing was very helpful and apologetic at the time, I cannot say that the calls I received in the following days (after I emailed essentially saying this review) were particularly caring nor concerned.

Both calls were apparently on a 'cover your behind' mission, as they were purely concerned with seeing if I was 'well,' and thanking me for coming to the restaurant. They seemed far more concerned, I'll be honest, with whether I'd recovered rather than my actual wellbeing. It felt as if they were more worried I'd sue, or complain to someone with some actual authority.

So, no, I'm not particularly happy with a restaurant that had great food that would have been reasonably priced had the restaurant not been so far off the street it was basically in Iowa, that also made me feel so sick that I couldn't do much in my last day in Vegas but sit down and occasionally run to the restrooms in Bally's. 

It's annoying, too, because the service/food really did taste great. What was offensive was being told over the phone that ""the food is quite rich so it can have an effect on people who don't eat a lot of rich food."" So what you're basically saying is I cook crap at home, really. Sorry, but I'm a good cook, and I cook all kinds of different, rich things.

My only suggestion for a group of three people would be to get two prix fixe meals and another entree for a party of three.  This gives you four appetizers/desserts instead of six.

It's location was a bit off putting, being in a strip mall and all, but once you go inside, you find it is very pleasant inside. The service was good, although the waiter seemed a bit young (maybe im getting old). Maybe seeing a young kid act as stodgy as he could was sort of amusing.

Appetizer: Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag Blue Cheese Coleslaw.

Entree:  Grilled Wild King Salmon on a Granny Smith Cabbage Slaw with Candied Walnuts...

Dessert: Coconut Bread Pudding with Coconut Sorbet and Dark Chocolate Sauce

The appetizer I had read about on ahem...Chowhound to overwhelming accolades, but i found it to be overrated. The BBQ sauce was overly sweet and the blue cheese a bit gimmicky. Tasty but unspectacular. The entree was substantial and robust, tho I actually enjoyed my moms choice best, which was the Pan Seared Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. It was very succulent. By dessert, we were already stuffed but they stood out as the highlight. The Chocolate Flourless Cake was a surprise favorite. The Rustic Apple Tart would have been better served warm. The Coconut Bread Pudding was very sweet and very good.

2346601,2010-06-15,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Thank you Yelp for recommending this place! I celebrated my 25th birthday at Rosemary's Restaurant, and had a wonderful time with my husband. 

We chose the $55 prie fixe menu since it was a great deal. It was so hard to decide on which items you can choose since there are a lot of options on the menu! I chose the appetizer, main entrée, and dessert route. My husband chose the 2 appetizers and main entrée route. 
The complimentary bread is so good! There was a white roll and a walnut raisin roll. Yum! I could eat the walnut raisin roll everyday, especially since the rolls were warm.

For appetizer we had the following: 
1) Warm Mozzarella Crepe with Tomato Vinaigrette and Pea Sprouts and Popcorn Fried Morel Mushrooms (Special of the day) - The crepe was really delicious with the mozzarella cheese inside. The morel mushrooms were interesting. The batter was really light, so I wouldn't consider it as ""popcorn fried."" 

2) Pan Fried Veal Sweetbreads - Wow! This was yummy. The sweetbreads were very tender. It's one of the best sweetbreads that I've eaten.

3) Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with Sour Cucumbers - This is the Rosemary's version of a crab cake. The texture was a bit mushy to me, but you can taste the crab. There wasn't a lot of carb fillers either. I prefer the other two appetizers over this one.

We also received an amuse busche of a vegetable lasagna which was complimentary of the chef.

For the main entrée we had the following:
1) Pan Fried Soft Shell Crab on bed of Chanterelle Mushroom and Fingerling Potatoes with Sweet Corn (Special of the day) - The dish is presented beautifully with the crab on top of the mushrooms and potatoes. The batter was very light, and everythign tasted great! I always like to eat chanterelle mushrooms. 

2) Roasted Rack of Lamb - Oh goodness. The lamb was very tender and cooked medium rare. The portion of the lamb was very generous. I love the balsamic reduction sauce. I soaked up every bit of sauce with the lamb. I'm not a fan of olives, so I didn't enjoy the mashed potatoes too much. 

At this time, I was extremely full, but there is always room for desserts! I ordered the following as my birthday treat:

1) Rustic Apple Tart with candied walnuts and cinnamon ice cream -MmMMm.. the dessert was so good! I was also thrilled that the pastry chef wrote ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate. Love the extra touches that the restaurant gives. I love how the apple tart came in a tiny puff pastry. It wasn't what I expected since I thought it would be a mini pie. The dessert also came with a butter cookie underneath the ice cream.This is definitely a sweet dish but very good.

We also received a complimentary dessert from chef:
1)  Fudge brownie which is really rich
2)  Lemon tart
3) Two peanut butter balls - They reminded me of eating a really rich and soft Reese's peanut butter cup.

The service was great, and food was delicious. Highly recommended place in Las Vegas!",_H1VvAk65d2z-2-XuLHkmw,3,0,5,Y6fPFCDMylXBJRJzeMi9_g
2362169,2009-03-22,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Rosemary's is a delightfully surprising gem tucked away in a strip mall on Sahara, about 15-20 minutes west of the Strip.  It doesn't quite offer the ""show"" that is expected of fine dining in Las Vegas, but Rosemary's marksmanship with food presentation and service were dead on.

Our party of four arrived a few minutes late for our reservation on a Sunday night, but were seated fairly promptly in the dining room off by the bar.  The server and his assistant were always on point, anticipating our every dining need.  Each of us opted for the three-course prix fixe dinner at $55 per meal, $65 if you wanted to upgrade entrees to rack of lamb or filet of beef.  Our servers started us off with Rosemary's tasty signature dinner rolls and some cocktails.  

For my dinner, I opted to start with one of the night's specials: a blended winter vegetable soup.  The taste and texture of the soup was wonderful, only to be heightened more so by the subtle scent of truffle oil drizzled as garnish on top of the soup.  The second course was seared bay scallops with a deliciously rich sauce.  My third course was the roasted rack of lamb, beautifully seared, served with a side of homemade mashed potatoes blended with fresh cut olives, a side of fried arugula and a signature bordelaise sauce.  Each course was presented so beautifully and cleanly.  By the end of dinner, we all barely had room for dessert but eventually prevailed to at least taste some of it.

Rosemary's is definitely a restaurant I'd like to visit again on my next trip to Vegas, and would certainly recommend this to others!",nfp5M3TiAeiq8ANwzrFuqQ,0,0,4,jmEqrLibXep5O2TBaayufw

2411007,2010-11-14,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"I really wanted to love this place.  From all of the reviews and buzz, I've heard. It made me think to myself, ""I've got to check this place out before I move from this town.""  It was good but not memorable.

I arrived here on a Wednesday night at about 6:30 pm.  One hostess was nice and the other took herself way too seriously.  I told them that I knew that they were booked heavily for that evening but when could I get a table.  The evil one told me 9 pm with a serious scoff in her voice then asked if that would be suitable.  The nicer one asked if I wanted to wait there or come back.  I told them I would wait. (I didn't really want to, but I was curious as to what they would do.)  The nicer one said, ""Let me see if there's a table we can get you in the bar."" The evil one stopped her and said, ""No, she doesn't need a table in the bar.""  The nicer one, ""There's no one sitting there. All I have to do is get a chair.""  The evil one, ""No.""  The nicer one looks at me like ""help me"".  I smiled and told them I would be back in a bit.  I went out to my car to check my email and to see who kept calling me.  Anyone works at a 24/7 type career field will tell you that your work is never really done, so I answered emails, phone calls, and texts.  By the time I looked up, it had been 2 hours, so I went back in.  Lo and behold, the evil one was gone, and I didn't have to deal with her the rest of the night.  Thank God!

I told the nice one I would be in the bar until my table was ready because I had a few more loose ends to tie up.  She smiled and told me my table was ready-- 1/2 hr early-- and started to apologize for the other girl.  I raised up my hand and told her that the gesture is appreciated but the explanation is not needed.  After I was seated, the wait staff was prompt.  I had my sparkling water and declined the drink menu.  I was driving, and I wanted to taste my food to see what the hype was about.  The waiter handed me the menu and asked if I wanted some time.  I told him I wanted the tasting menu ($80 with no wine or beer pairings. I believe it goes up to $115 for beer and $135 with wine or at least somewhere in that ballpark.).

It was five courses of better than average cuisine but nothing ground breaking.  The first was the Creole Beef and Bison Tartar.  That was very fresh.  My second was the Cashew Crusted Salmon w/Wasabi Creamed Potatoes & Ginger Soy Butter Sauce.  Well executed salmon, but my favorite part of the dish was the wasabi creamed potatoes.  This was something to write home about.  Course three was Pan Fried Veal Sweetbreads w/Black Beluga Lentils & Bloody Mary Butter.  The waiter mentioned that this is one of his favorites, and it is for good reason.  My main course was Roasted Rack of Lamb w/Kalamata Olive Creamed Potatoes & Balsamic Reduction Sauce.  I must say now I know for certain that I do not like lamb, but this also was still very good.  The dessert course was a trio-- creme brulee, chocolate cake, and a framboise lambic and hazelnut float.  That chocolate cake was very rich.  I took a bite and that was plenty for an non-chocolate lover.

My water was refilled periodically and kept on ice 2 tables away. They really weren't on top of that.  Service, in fact, was average at best.  Honestly, throw the wait staff from Yardhouse in different attire and give some of them European accents, and the service would have been better. The espresso I ordered after dessert was average at best.  I didn't know that I came in on ladies' night, which meant my food was 1/2 off.  That was a great surprise with the check and 18% gratuity was added in automatically even though I was dining alone.  Maybe when the food is not 1/2 off it will live up to its reputation.

Overall, I would say that this place has all the dressings and presentation of a fine dining restaurant.  It has its niche following.  The ingredients were reasonably fresh and were seasoned to highlight the natural flavors but not accent them or to intrigue you.  For me, it was all a bit unimaginative... And to get on my soap box slightly, a good meal can open your eyes to another place, challenge your beliefs, make you fall in love, remind you of a time gone by, or to raise you expectations of what can really be done in a kitchen!  This why I dine out!  None of this is happening here, which means I really could have cooked all of this at home myself-- especially since I could have gotten the cookbook on disc for an additional $10.  A well-executed tasting menu can take you on a journey.  Ordering it can be like telling a chef to tell you a story and/or to show you his wares.  For me the story was ho-hum.  As for his wares, he knows how to cook and can follow a recipe but cannot challenge his guests to something more... which makes  this place grossly average.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,1,1,3,E90R73Fi2PxsAk0Hz1ltbw

2450181,2010-01-27,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"My boyfriend and I took the 204 bus there, taking under 30 minutes in the early evening of a Sunday. This destination was where we planned our one splurge meal for our four-day stay in Sin City. We didn't have a reservation since we weren't sure when we'd decide to head over (about 7 miles west of Sahara), but there wasn't a problem getting our table for two at 5:45 PM. (It did get pretty bumpin' around 6:30 PM, though.)

There are three styles of dining at Rosemary's:
1) A la carte, which is what we are used to doing at fancy restaurants.
2) Prix fixe, which was the most flexible option for a set price of $55: any entree and two other courses from the menu (except for the foie gras, which you'd just add $15 to get, and the appetizer sampler, which can only be ordered a la carte).
3) Tasting menu, ranging from $80 to $125 for five courses and whether you want wine or beer pairings (or neither) with each course.

We went with the prix fixe option, and I don't regret our choice:

1 amuse bouche: vegetable bread pudding
-- I'm a huge fan of bread pudding, so this savory take was a fresh look at a familiar texture. Add some sharp bits of caramelized onions on top, and the picture is complete.

2 fresh rolls: potato and white chocolate pecan
-- Fresh bread is irresistible in my book, and both of these were delectable. The white chocolate pecan sticks out in my memory since it was little dessert preview before our meal formally started. Yum!

3 appetizers: Hugo's Texas BBQ shrimp, pan-fried milk-fed veal sweetbreads, and twice-baked Parmesan souffle
-- My favorite out of the three was the twice-baked Parmesan souffle. Normally, you'd think of souffles as a sweet, takes at least 30 minutes after ordering to bake and arrive at your table sort of dish. But Rosemary's disrupts both of these norms. The garlic cream sauce and wild mushrooms couldn't have complemented the fluffy, savory souffle any better. (It also helps that I am a fan of both garlic and mushrooms.)
-- The shrimp was quite good, but I was drawn more towards the coleslaw (actually a cheeseslaw). It strayed away from the normal sour taste of coleslaw and made me enjoy blue cheese, which I usually don't.
-- The sweetbreads were fun to eat just because we don't get to very often.

2 entrees: roasted rack of lamb and Creole-grilled prime ribeye
-- Jon A. ordered the lamb rare, and, boy, did they deliver. They cooked the entire rack first and then sliced it, so each piece was quite obviously pink. I'm not sure how I felt about there being Kalamata olives in the mashed potatoes, but overall, this dish was satisfying.
-- The ribeye was huge, especially after everything we'd already devoured thus far. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, and I couldn't get enough of the creamy grits. My absolute favorite flavor of the evening came from the fried onions on top of the steak: Rosemary's used red onions rather than the traditional white, and the batter coating the onions was seasoned with a beautiful combination of herbs and spices. Why can't all fried onions be made this way?

1 dessert: goat cheese cheesecake
-- A modest helping of dessert after a marathon of a meal, the goat cheese cheesecake didn't hide its origins (i.e., you can definitely taste the goat cheese if you are paying attention). A generous dollop of freshly whipped cream sat on top, and underneath was a decorative spread of Scotch caramel sauce. An excellent finale to the meal.

3 mignardise:
-- Just when we thought it was over, our waiter presented us with bonus desserts: peanut butter buckeyes, lemon squares, and brownie bites. My favorite of the three were the peanut butter buckeyes: they were coated in something extremely crispy, which balanced out the soft peanut butter texture.

----

Sunday nights is when Rosemary's offers up many of their bottles of wine (including half bottles) at 50% off. We asked our waiter for a recommendation to go with what we ordered (above), and we ended up trying a $74 bottle for $37. A super Tuscan, the Terre del Marchesato ""Emilio Primo"" (vintage 2005) went pretty well with every course. Unlike other reds I've had, it didn't overpower the taste of the food but did a great job clearing the palate between each bite.

The service was unbeatable: they paid attention to every detail, down to pulling your chairs out at the same time when you are initially seated.

The verdict: Wow, what a wonderful surprise this off-strip restaurant was! Food + service + ambiance were all stellar. I wish there were something like it closer to home. It was definitely worth the trek off the Strip.

Had 5:30pm Resv. but found the place already buzzing due to 50% ladies night. Didn't even know.....50% off? Yes! extra money for the vino.  Celebrated my  wife's bday and it was worth every cent.  
The apptz. were carpaccio & sweet breads- Unbelievable!.  So delicious were these choices, we actually added the foie gras - smile~tear drop!
Shared Wilted Lettuce Salad- very nice refresher b/f entree.

Entree was lamb for me. Terrific as everyone else has pointed out so I won't, but my wife's Butterfish in prosciutto / panko bread crumbs was ""outta this world"" superb. It was the best seafood dish I have ever tasted!!
Wine and more wine....then nice desert to celebrate the bday which they did a great job picking this up off my 'comments' when making the reservation on line at Open Table.com
Hats off to our dynamic duo Servers - Matt & Tony (please forgive if i miss one of your names....it's your fault for bringing me the wine!).  They took exceptional care of us the whole night.  The thing that impressed me the most is they actually came back to ensure I meant to add more to the Tip.  I'll try to explain:
Even though he explained when he brought me the check, *burp* I didn't quite grasp *burp* that he had already added the gratuity based on my wife's half price entree @ full price, then discounted the tkt.
I added tip as usual....one, because I felt it was worth it & 2...the vino.  He made sure to alert me to this and offered for me to scratch out.  Instead I initialed the additional tip.  You don't typically find such honesty, unfortunately.  This was just outstanding character and a reflection of the Associates of Rosemary's.

This is a special kind of place that you don't really want to keep a running total in your head of what is being spent....the pre-fix is the way to go, enjoy, splurge....skip another fancy meal some time later.  Trust me.

This is a cozy place and all was great until towards the end when a table of 6 young ""hotties"" were seated next to us.

During my business trip to Vegas, I was fortunate to have a friend who is a local who took me here so I could enjoy a good meal and stay far off the awful strip.  This was a great time, with only a few suggestions for improvement.

Service - although they made us wait 15 minutes past our reservation for a table, our waitress was FANTASTIC as was the supporting staff.  Lots of little details attended to that I loved - very classy without being snooty, from the simple pulling out (and pushing in) of my chair to asking if we had any food allergies.  The waitress was funny and entertaining and really genuine - we adored her (I forgot her name but she looks like the gorgeous Hilary Swank).  The food was fantastic - started with the crab boulettes (really creative and good) and chestnut soup (wow the soup was phenomenal), and I had the sea scallops while my friend had the filet mignon.  My scallops were prepared gorgeously and were atop pureed parsnips (maybe a bit more flavor to the parsnips would've been nice?) and the hush puppies side order were great.  We were too full for dessert, but the cocktails were good (thank you for asking what kind of vodka I wanted in my lemon drop) and the cote du rhone was perfect.  My only significant issues?  1) they serve foie gras, supporting a horribly cruel practice; and 2) they do not recycle!!  There were huge garbage cans full of bottles - they said there is no recycling available but my friend said there indeed is recycling in Vegas, so that left a bad taste in my mouth.  c'mon Vegas, with all that waste as it is, the least y'all can do is show some environmental sensitivity....but alas, everything else was so perfect that I still give them a great rating.  

Note:  not sure that $25 is ""a steal"" for lunch as per another review.  Las Vegas is exorbitantly priced and  being off-strip I had hoped for more reasonable prices but the two of us still spent $150 on dinner excluding tip.  boo.",gJBSFLeiof3gAfAMaCOqbw,1,0,4,xGKchtal-UKYiIsQzG0dIQ

2665001,2010-01-22,9,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Just about the smartest thing Jamie W. and I did on our trip to Vegas this past weekend was rent a car. Last time, we were stuck on the Strip with either extravagantly expensive restaurants trademarked by brand name chefs or the $6.99 Prime Rib special. Nothing in between...nothing. Driving eight miles west of the Strip on Sahara Drive, you can find a stylish, low-key bistro in the middle of a strip mall. Yes, a strip mall. It's called Rosemary's, and there wasn't a sign of an obnoxious out-of-town gambler in the entire place. 

So here's the deal - $55 for a three-course prix fixe dinner, and you don't have to get two desserts. Instead, we went with three appetizers, two entrees and shared one dessert. Bonus points to Rosemary's for allowing such flexibility for the more peckish diners. It ended up being a whole lotta food, and most of it really good. We automatically got two big rolls on our bread plates, a Glazed White Chocolate Pecan and a Potato (see photo). Freshly baked and very tasty. We tried to save one for the dinner itself, but it was hard. Then we were given an amuse-bouche, a little square of Vegetable Bread Pudding with Shaved Chives that was a homey, heavenly pop in the mouth. 

The appetizers turned out to be a bit more hit-and-miss. The Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle with Garlic Cream Sauce and Saute of Wild Mushrooms (see photo) was impeccably presented but could have used more kick and texture to offset the excessive creaminess. The prawns in Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp were really succulent covered with the thick barbecue sauce, an unusual mix that mostly worked, but the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw was just a little too mayo-like to fully enjoy (see photo). I think a vinaigrette would have worked better. The winners among the appetizers had to be the Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with Emulsified Ravigote Sauce and Grandma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers (see photo) where the crunchiness of the boulette's outer crust went very well with the relish-like sauce. 

There was nothing wrong with the Arugula, Endive & Radicchio Salad (see photo) except for the fact that it was completely overshadowed by the showy appetizers. Our luck significantly improved with the two entrees - the Creole Grilled Prime Ribeye with Anson Mills Carolina Quick Grits, Crystal Red Onion Crust and Rosemary's Own Steak Sauce, and the Grilled Veal Tenderloin with Saute of Asparagus, Prosciutto & Maitake Mushrooms and Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce (see photos). Both were excellent - especially the way the meat was prepared, very tender and flavorful. Jamie and I were pretty full by this time (...we already had a to-go box ready for the leftover meat), but we couldn't leave without trying their Pecan Tart with Brown Sugar Ice Cream. If that wasn't enough, they left us a little plate of little cookies with the check (see photos). 

As good and abundant as the food was, it was really the attentive service that was most memorable about the meal. There seemed to be a trio of guys who were making sure we were served at exactly the right time and refilling our water glasses before they were empty. I kept imagining how much this experience would have cost if the place was in the Bellagio or the Wynn. So is it the Strip or a strip mall for you? Let your palate and pocketbook decide. 

FOOD - 4 stars...some dishes soared, a few flailed a bit in execution, but the meat was very well prepared 
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...quiet, dim lights in the main dining room...the typical romantic spot 
SERVICE - 5 stars...truly stellar 
TOTAL - 4 stars...a very solid four stars overall for Rosemary's",m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,14,14,4,aAjbphRTHgBWv7H-7TCmIg

I have traveled to Vegas on business more times than I can remember and usually settle for one of the hundreds of destination restaurants. I was glad to have learned about this place. Rosemary's would be on the top of my list in any city. The atmosphere is ""local elegant"" and the food was special without being over-thought. Also, I can't say enough good things about the wine list. There were treasures from an original list of small production vineyards. The manager/sommelier was very helpful and educated - we found the right choices for the group and uncovered the last bottle of something special for the end of the evening.

2921987,2011-06-20,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Fantastically surprised about this place. Its located in one of the most unusual places (stuck between a $1 store and some other cheapy markets). Walked inside to find a very clean and fancy/romantic atmosphere. Was able to seat 12 of us no problem when we went for a Father's Day dinner.

The service at Rosemary's was incredible. Waiters/waitresses would pull your chairs out for you or put your napkins on your lap. When serving dinner all meals would come out at the exact same time, literally. The waiters would wait until they were in position and then place all of our dishes in front of us at the exact same time. Because my family had been there occasionally before (Parents went on their own several times), the chef made our table an extra appetizer for everyone as well as extra dessert. 

Food was delcious. Depending on what you order you may get a small portion that is rich in flavor like I did with the seared scallops. As an appetizer I had their signature BBQ shrimp dish which was very tasty and tangy. The dessert definitely sealed the deal on the meal with the Banana Cheesecake that had a touch of fosters caramel on it. 

The only downside I can find in this place is the pricing, but if you're going there I can only assume you know you will be paying quite a bit for dinner. The best deal is probably going for their Pree-fixe meal for $50 and getting any appetizer, main course, and dessert.

Definitely worth going to if you happen to be in the Vegas area.",IH-FpfZkhIM6ram3H7zPXg,0,0,5,51iwpP3Yc3RkzgtPgdg5bA

Nice change of pace from all the trumpery. If you sign up for their email list they send out coupons which is courteous of them and they love it when you use them. They have a beer selection for the food which is awesome for beer lovers. I have to admit it is small but it's very cozy.

3014776,2008-07-13,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"This restaurant itself is located in a regular looking shopping center, but the experience inside itself outshines its looks. It was about a 15 minute drive away from the strip for us, luckily very easy to find with a gps unit.

The server and waiter (yep, two for a party of four), that helped us were both very sincere and polite. They were also useful in assisting us in determining which dishes may best suit our tastes. They didn't react negatively at all when my mother chose to just sample our prix fixe three course dinner, since she wasn't so hungry.

I'll try to remember everything we had

(1) Dogs wouldn't touch it --- (10) Gods/goddesses dine on this

Pan fried Sweet breads - (6) Was a little bland for my taste
Goat cheese stuffed Proscuitto FIgs - (10) THE HIGHLIGHT of the dinner, the combination was genius in my mind, and I can't wait to make this dish on my own.
Salmon Tartar - (8) Fresh salmon, tasted great
Grilled Veal tenderloin - (7) Cooked nicely, but it was cold when it came out
Crispy Bass - (8) Well seasoned, the hushpuppies and shrimp were awesome compliments.
Flat Iron Steak (7) - Nothing stood out to me, it was a well made steak, but nothing unique, even with the sauce.
Flourless Chocolate cake - (5) This is for extreme chocolate lovers only, it's like biting into a brick of bitter chocolate, dipped in ultra dark chocolate, covered in cocoa powder. I love bittersweet Lindt chocolate bars, but this was way powerful.
Carrot cake - (6) Unfortunately, the cake was dry, but the flavor was passable.
Ice Box lemon tart - (5) I am very selective on lemon based desserts, and this didn't float my particular boat.

Rosemary has its hits and misses, but I could see why they have repeat customers. According to the waiter, Carrot-top visits this place often. The staff is polite, the décor is nice, and the food is creative and fun.  It was a pleasant surprise to find that Mondays were industry nights, which gave a discount for those who service the restaurant industry (my mother). For me, the desserts here disappoint, but there is much variety to savor in their main dishes. I will be back another time to try out other entrees I missed. Proscuitto wrapped Figs with Goat Cheese are genius, I realize I stated that before, but I would drive back here just to have a plate of that appetizer alone.",4j7C6TbmjysuuF1D3o9xBQ,0,0,4,JYVmwQKIN9QbT3XQnaXHcg

Though the restaurant is located aggravatingly far from the strip, it is well worth the visit.  I went with a party of three and used their online coupon to get the price fixed lunch for 23 dollars a head.  It was worth far more than every penny.

I highly reccomend the shrimp appetizer, mahi mahi, and pecan tart dessert.  The shrimp was in a highly disciplined barbeque sauce and served up with cole slaw that complimented it perfectly.  The mahi mahi was out of this world and the pecan tart measured up to any I've had ever before.

3033824,2009-09-09,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"The best way to describe this place is a 'Diamond in the Rough'. I really enjoy a great fine dining experience and based on previous experiences (Tableau and Daniel Boulud Brasserie at the Wynn) I couldn't help but judge a book by it's cover and cringe when we drove up to a strip mall. My cousin attends the Cordon Bleu and his chef owns and runs this restaurant and we went to try it out. 

It was a bit uncomfortable being dressed up walking to this restaurant it just looks like a normal faced strip mall restaurant. But as soon as you walk in it is real nice and a typically dim lit environment the ambiance is relaxing. The service is phenomenal being a lady it's always a joy to be treated as one should be. My chair was pulled out and gently pushed in. I was always served first (it erks me when people aren't taught manners and courtesy) this wait staff has been trained to proper manners. The menu had a great selection it was really hard to chose. I went with the prix fixe option crab boulette (basically a crab cake), halibut linguist and coconut bread pudding. It was all so delicious! My bf had brick chicken (so moist and wonderfully seasoned), his bro had the scallops (yummy perfectly cooked), and my cousin also had the prix fixe option sweet corn soup, sea bass and flourless chocolate cake (yumm!). Bottles of wine were 50% off so we had to check out the menu and let me tell you only great restaurants carry Cakebread so we enjoyed a great bottle of chardonnay. 

Like I said the service was phenomenal when any of us left the table either the napkins were folded or when we'd come back to the table someone was there to assist us with our chair. Silverware was replaced without our notice we called them ninja servers our water or wines were always filled never even near empty. We were also offered some tastings of some seafood dip and chip and some bite size desserts lemon tart, peanut butter balls and chocolate covered mints.

We all really enjoyed our dining experience and couldn't complain about the check for the service and the fine food $250 is cheap for 4 people with a bottle of wine. 

I totally recommend this for a date it's not all that impressive on the outside but for you males you're female date will appreciate being treated like a lady!

3068734,2007-11-06,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"We had dinner at Rosemary's on a Sunday last month.

I arrived early and peppered the hostesses with questions on dishes they would recommend, the art on the walls (from local independent artists and available for purchase), and the age of the restaurant. I also found out they offer full-service catering. The hostesses were friendly (they put up with me) and knowledgeable.

The place eventually became crowded. It was somewhat hilarious (and a little offensive) how one kid was watching a DVD at the table (who brings their kid - and their personal player - to a place like Rosemary's?). It was all the more obvious since the room was dim (relatively speaking: the tables in the front bar area were better lit). Our dining room suffered from ""mood lighting"" and would benefit from seat or table spotlights; I like to see what I'm eating. Others may argue that they don't want to see their date, so this place may be good for you!

Service was outstanding. Our primary server and his assistant explained every dish (even the beer selections). Like Perrier's Le Bec-Fin, the servers were enthusiastic and placed the dishes on the table in unison. Unlike LBF, the servers didn't buzz around the table like insects.

I was running on an hour of sleep, so I (wisely) refrained from having alcohol but a friend had the beer-meal pairings, which he enjoyed.

A few of us ordered the chef's tasting menu ($70). Compared to typical tasting menus, the overall package was a generous size and we weren't able to finish it all. The courses which grabbed my attention (even through my sleepy stupor) were:
- l'amuse bouche (I was amused)
- First course: salmon tartar appetizer with watercress, caviar, crackers and a saffron sauce
- Fourth course: rack of lamb with Kalamata olive mashed potatoes, fried arugula, and a rosemary bordelaise sauce (mmmmmm - quite savory and the lamb was oh-so-tender)

Lackluster courses:
- Second course: Panko crab boulettes with marinated cucumbers (flavorless)
- Third course: Crispy skin striped bass with hushpuppies and a creole meuniere sauce (not too much flavor, and not a fan of fish)
- Dessert: I don't remember the dessert - not my thing anyway.

Rosemary's is 30-40 minutes from the Strip, but worth the cab ride there. It's popular and is booked quickly, so reserve your table in advance!",6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ,2,1,4,DknSI7Lgz072RHbdaTj79A
3072522,2010-12-29,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Rosemary's is definitely overrated.  It gets 5 stars for great service, but only 2 1/2 to 3 for the food..

My girlfriend and I both ordered from the Prix Fixe options.  She got the house salad for her first choice, while I ordered the special, which was some kind of creamy tomato soup.  We ended up switching because we liked each other's more.  The house salad was actually really good and had some crunchy crouton chips that went with it.  My girlfriend really liked the soup.  It was rich and was served with some kind of gourmet potato chips.

For my second option, I got the barbecue shrimp appetizer.  It was served with a bleu cheese slaw.  The barbecue sauce was really good.  My girlfriend doesn't like shrimp, so this was the perfect amount for me.  However, the dish was too small to share.  The slaw was just ok.  

We got a sampler before our entree came out.  It was some kind of fish mixture on a wonton.  They were actually pretty good.  

Then the entrees came.  Neither of us were crazy about the entrees.  This is where Rosemary's and so many of these high-priced restaurants mess up is on their entrees.  My girlfriend played it safe and got the parmesan angel hair pasta.  It was good, but is something you could make on your own for much cheaper.  She got some of the fingerling potatoes.  They were ok.  There was a funny flavor to them.  I ordered the rack of lambs.  While they were cooked perfectly, the sauce gave them this awful flavor.  And the potatoes were not edible with the strong flavor of kalamata olives mixed in (probably a preference type of thing).

For dessert, we got the blueberry and pear cobbler.  My girlfriend didn't like it, because it was mostly fruit and not much cobbler.  And they give you a tiny tiny tiny scoop of vanilla (seriously?!?!?! half the deliciousness of any cobbler is the vanilla ice cream)  But I ate the whole thing anyway.

They also brought out a little sampler and the peanut butter buckeyes are really good.

You can even pair up on salads or apps which I did so I got 2 apps and an entree.  If you come in a group order one of everything.

I would classify the cuisine as Lousiana, Cajun, Southern Fine Dining fusion.

Chef MJ has clearly got the goods!

We ended up getting the following:

Texas BBQ Shrimp with Blue Cheese Slaw - Huge portion for an appeteizer.  Pretty awesome but I've had better BBQ shrimp in Lousiana.

Twin Baked Parmesan Souffle  with Mushrooms - A few more mushrooms would hit the spot.  This is also a must order.

Tasso Ham and Crawfish Risotto with Tomatoe Jus - Defintely my favorite of everything I ate.  It had a great kick to it.  I could eat a huge dinner portion of this.

Seared Sea Scallops w/ Parsnip Potato Puree, Apple Cider Beurre Blanc - the sauce was the boss (shout out to Cane's) and the scallops were perfectly cooked

Grilled Pork Chop w/ Hoppin John and Creole Mustard Reduction Sauce - Maybe one of the juiciest pork chops i've had and the hoppin john was some tasty rice

Alaskan Day Boat Halibut - NOt my favorite but good for mild fish lovers

Cashew Crusted Salmon - Perfectly cooked, clean, with a light taste.  

Desserts (i was going to pass out from a food coma)

All good - we got the pecan pie, apple tart (?) - flaky and good, chocolate flourless cake (the best!!), and a coconut bread pudding - YUM YUM YUM

My friends rented out the main room for the evening. Everything was superb (this is one of those times I need more than 5 stars). We had a delicious seven course tasting menu. Both wine and beer pairings were offered. I've never heard of a beer pairing and thought that was an awesome idea, especially for the non wine-drinkers.

The service was impeccable. The coolest part? Even though our table was a table of 14, we all got served at the exact same time. No, really! Each waiter had 2 plates and they placed them at the same time.  That was an excellent touch!

One waiter was especially in charge of my friend and practically jumped over tables to make sure she never had to pull out her chair and also that she and her new hub were perfectly happy. They were.

When we pulled up (in a big, huge bus, mind you!), a few of us were taken aback by the strip mall and the green neon. Don't let the Krazy Buffet or Stein Mart in the same lot fool you!  The atmosphere was lovely and we soon forgot we were tucked away in such a lovely little restaurant.

3255995,2009-01-19,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Based on Web research I visited Rosemary's this past week when in Vegas for a birthday rest and relaxation trip.  It is indeed in an unlikely location but the decor is upscale and pleasing to the eye yet very soothing.

Their three course fixed price lunch is a bargain at $28.00 but I had a Web promo printed out that brought the price down to $23.  Absolutely an outstanding bargain at either price.  

Ordered a salad with arugula, poached pears, nuts and blue cheese - outstanding. Entree was duck confit with lentils.  It was not rendered for long enough and thus was a bit fattier than it should have been and wasn't quite at the optimal pull-apart stringy texture that marks a great confit but still very tasty.  Dessert was a flourless chocolate torte - very good but IMHO served a bit too cold.

Service was from an attentive young staff - obviously well trained and eager (almost to eager) to please.  I likea  slightly more subdued presence that is nearly invisible but from an overall standpoint I still have to give them high marks for service.

I'm very picky about food and have eaten in some very good restaurants on my travels.  I can safely recommend Rosemary's to anyone who is serious about food and service and has high expectations.    They are obviously very committed to a high level of service and focused on both the quality of food and the presentation.

High praise from dad who is rather culinarily challenged and measures food on a scale of ""MMMMM"" and ""tastes funny.""

The biggest attraction though, the service.  Not only did the waiter explain everything to my father rather patiently, but he also knew exactly what wine to recommend with each dish.

When you pull up to a strip mall that contains a fine dining restaurant you already go into the meal with a strange feeling in your gut. That feeling is almost instantly vanquished when you enter and are greeted and sat by the courteous wait staff. Black napkins for those wearing black slacks or a dark dress was definitely a snazzy touch I was impressed by.

Now, on to the most important part, the food! Our table did the Prixe Fixe menu and basically tried to share everything. I had the crawfish risotto which was melt in your mouth delicious for my starter. I honestly wished they created an entree version so I could have had more. My entree was a salmon dish which I honestly forgot the accompanying sides but every bite was memorable and this meal happened quite a few months ago. For dessert each person at the table tried something different so we could basically sample all the sweets they had to offer. The apple tart was by far my favorite and their special of the night which was a raspberry chocolate cake honestly tasted burnt. It was the definite low-light of the meal for me. 

Overall this place is amazing for the price, not to mention we get $25 off gift certificates randomly in the mail. Their attention to detail and excellent service is amazing. From the amuse-bouche for everyone before the meal to the complimentary desserts with the check this place is a keeper.

Despite its strip mall location, it's one of the best spots in the suburbs to have a sophisticated and elegant meal. When my wife and I moved to Las Vegas a few years ago some friends brought us here for our first ""nice"" meal in town. We were blown away back then and on our return visit a couple days ago we were still impressed.

There wasn't a single disappointing dish. They started us off with two rolls each. The potato roll was good, but the sweet white chocolate pecan roll was delicious, with a texture like a sticky, chewy cinnamon roll.

Shortly after dropping off the rolls the waiter returned with an amuse bouche of goat cheese quiche with bacon. It's salty and tart flavor was a bold way to start the meal.

I opted for the $55 prix fixe option -- ordering two apps and an entree. My wife ordered a la carte, getting one app and entree. It's great that Rosemary's allows customers to either order two apps and an entree or an app, entree and dessert as part of the prix fixe. That kind of flexibility is nice for people who want to skip dessert.

//Appetizers//
Panko crusted crab boulettes w/ g-ma's sweet & sour cucumbers and emulsified ravigote sauce. The cucumbers were the star of the dish with its combination of sweetness and acidity. The sauce was tangy and added good flavors to the mild tasting crab.

Shrimp with pistachio crusted goat cheese, avocado. This dish was a salad topped with slices of avocado, three large shrimp, and goat cheese balls. It was a deliciously refreshing and light app.

Butternut squash soup with chipotle aioli, pumpkin seeds and creme fraiche. There were hints of spiciness from the chipotle aioli with a sweetness provided by the creme fraiche and a nice crunchy texture from the seeds. This was one of the best butternut squash soups you'll find.

//Entrees//
Seared sea scallops w/ parsnip potato puree, crispy prosciutto, parsnip strips and apple cider beurre blanc.  Delicious scallops that didn't have any hint of gritiness. The prosciutto was so light and crispy and the beurre blanc was so creamy. In combination, all the ingredients made this an excellent dish.

Crispy skin Texas striped bass w/ garlic spinach, sizzled leeks and meyer lemon caper beurre blanc. The fish was meaty and perfectly cooked. I'm not usually a fan of leeks but these were delicious. Another dish with a beurre blanc sauce, however this one didn't seem as buttery or thick as the one used with the scallops.

//Dessert//
They dropped off a plate of mignardises to end the meal. Three bites of a lemon bar, a peanut butter dessert that was crunchy and airy, and a chocolate brownie that was dense and moist. The sweet bites were a perfect way to end the meal without leaving us feeling too full.

Service was very good. There were two waiters swooping in and out setting and resetting silverware, cleaning off the table, pouring water, and checking in on us. Even though they were around a lot, they were as unintrusive as possible.

The price of the meal, while not cheap, was reasonable. Armed with a $25 gift card from restaurants.com, we walked out after spending $145 (including tax tip and two drinks).",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,2,5,247f_L1NZtXDlxFM8GIzug

Both times I was here, I opted for a three course dinner -  you can go with an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $55 or you can go two appetizers and an entree for $65.  In my most recent visit in May 2011, my date opted to go with the chef's tasting menu- a five course dinner coupled with either a glass of beer or wine per course which was approximately $120.  The option per the menu were either all beer or all wine, but the manager was very accomodating in letting us choose one or the other per course.  I love the fact that the menu includes a recommended beer and wine pairing, with the vast assortment of beers and wines available, the recommended pairings complemented the food very well.

The prix fixe meal is a steal, $55 for a 3-course dinner of your choice, when most a la carte entrees are already over $30.  By going prix-fixe you're getting way more food than you would be for the same prices elsewhere.

Dinner started off with an amuse bouche and 2 fresh, soft dinner rolls.  I ordered the ham and crawfish risotto, sweet corn soup, and halibut lindquist.  The halibut was fantastic, I was already stuffed by the time I finished my soup but I forced down the entire dish just for the taste of it, and I still enjoyed it.

from making the reservations to even the a follow up phone call days later to ask how the experience was, rosemary's TAKES CARE OF YOU. my goodness, they service was attentive and wonderful.

and the food. AMAZING. the white chocolate bread was incredibly delicious. never had anything like it.  for appetizer I had the figs stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in prosciutto. the right amount of salty and sweet for an overall orgasmic party in your mouth.

for my main, I had the rack of lamb. this was by far the best quality of lamb (so well marbled with the right amount of fat) and cooked JUST perfectly (medium rare). The meat was so tender.  The temperature was also perfect and served still warm. The sauce with the olives was pretty good although I personally would've liked some sort of touch of sweetness to complement lamb. Nonetheless, this dish was absolutely delicious. I also added the foie gras to my entree and it was HEAVEN. it was the most generous SLAB of foie gras I had ever seen!  so wrong but so good! my goodness. it was also cooked to perfection. the temperature of it was also just right with the warm seared outside. yes I want to cry just thinking about this entree. tt was THAT good. u HAVE to add the foie.

the waiter suggested a glass of a bordeaux to go with the lamb and it was the perfect complement with a bold but smooth spiciness. 

for dessert had creme brulee which wasn't mind blowing but it was good. the shell was nice but the inside was cold and I prefer the inside to be a bit warm. the consistency and creaminess of the creme was very good though.

they also gave complementary truffles and this crispy peanut butter ditty which were amaaazzzzing. what a great finish to a great meal!

He started with the Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp, Sweetbreads, Cajun Ribeye Steak.  I chose the Wilted Spinach salad, Filet, and then the Coconut Bread Pudding dessert.  

AMUSE BUCHE:  Whitefish salad on fried wonton chip, goat cheese mousse, roasted onion vinaigrette.  I really liked this - didn't taste the goat cheese but loved the onion dressing.  

BBQ SHRIMP: the shrimp were well cooked but he felt that the bbq sauce lacked some acidity or sweetness.  I actually enjoyed the slaw with the blue cheese but he wasn't a huge fan of the dish overall. 

WILTED SPINACH:  This was a mound of dressed spinach leaves, with little dabs of goat cheese and pecans around it, caramelized spears of onion, and a round of fried goat cheese.  Loved the onion, wished the pecans were broken up instead of halves and thought there was too much goat cheese but liked the fried disc. 

SWEETBREADS:  This was well fried and well cooked.  Beware, this is a huge portion, at least fist sized!  It came with Israeli couscous, and brunoised carrot, which I actually thought was the best part of the dish. 

CAJUN RIBEYE:  Not sure what made this Cajun, but it wasn't as tender as we hoped and fatty.  It was served over a pile of cheesy grits. 

FILET OF BEEF:  Cooked as I requested, came with three little potato croquettes, which are like fancy tater tots, and 3 spears of asparagus.  This was fine but unmemorable and I was so stuffed from all the apps so really we both took the majority of our entrees home as leftovers.

COCONUT BREAD PUDDING: Tom our server recommended that we take bites of both the coconut icecream and the bread pudding in the same bite to fully enjoy the dish.  The bread pudding itself is really unexpected.  It's less of a bread pudding and more of a Vietnamese coconut pudding (no bread).  It's a gelatinous coconutty pudding haphazardly decorated with huge globs of chocolate sauce, sweetened shredded coconut, and nuts -- maybe almonds?  

More desserts!  The restaurant also brought out brownie bites, tiny lemon squares and peanut butter buckeyes.  All were great but we were so full that we just snuck a bit of each.  

SERVICE: Excellent.  5/5.  The team of servers was well run, promptly refilled water and drinks, took away empty plates, brought new silverware.  Our actual waiter was slightly on the formal side but I guess I can't complain about that.  

The food is definitely solid but nothing so memorable that I'd make it a Vegas staple.  It also gives me the impression it's a suburban place trying to be fancy by throwing in blue cheese or goat cheese wherever it can.",Y5oH9VlzH0IfhCQ3SSESoQ,1,1,4,KOCmI49fRpvVng8FsibRWQ

3862216,2009-07-11,1,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"I always research the best places to eat prior to any trip - even if I've been to the place multiple times like Vegas. There are always new places to try and for me that is pretty exciting. I read all the rave reviews about Rosemary's on 10 Best, Trip Advisor, govegas.com, yelp, and the list goes on. Based on the fairly consistent reviews I was determined to add Rosemary's to my dining list while visiting over the 4th of July weekend. 

The bf and I had reservations, but the snooty hostess still made us take a seat and wait it out. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful with menu selections. However, she seemed to forget about us after our order was taken. 

The Service - Extremely slow. And our food took forever to come out. 

The Food - I ordered the Barbecue Texas Shrimp which was good but did not live up to all the rave reviews. The barbecue sauce seemed to be lacking something and the coleslaw was heavy on the blue cheese - it over powered the dish. My bf ordered the chicken dish which seemed to have a light pan-fried crust just over the top - delicious! 

The disappointment came when after waiting an excessive period of time for my $42 rack of lamb it came out rare when I specifically requested medium well. Off to the kitchen it went for another 25 minutes. In the meantime, there was no offer to compensate for their mistake. 

Shame on you Rosemary's. This is definitely not good customer service. The manager did not even come to our table to apologize. Guess they were too busy hob nobing with the other surrounding tables. 

When the same rack of lamb finally came out 25 minutes later it was totally overcooked and dry. 

For dessert, I ordered the seasonal berry cobbler. I love sweets but this was a disappointment. It could have been a bit less tart. I really wanted to give this establishment 5 stars, but the slow service, overcooked lamb, tart dessert and snooty hostess left a bad taste in my mouth. The manager could also attempt to be more accommodating and concerned about the level of service. 

I really wanted to give Rosemary's five stars.  However, this was just not a very good first experience.  Not sure I would return.",cSvwgRq74ElhrE6AQEm3DQ,0,0,3,GmJ8XI0ttB7ZpZS36OlxfQ

Like the other reviews have advised, ignore the Krazy Oriental Buffet and Steinmart randomness... this place is amazing. SO GOOD.  My family has been here a few times (minus me... jerks!) and I was finally able to try it this week.  We all went with the fixed menu for lunch ($28... but you can buy discounted gift certificates at Costco.com).

I ordrered:

Appetizer:  BBQ Shrimp & Maytag Cole Slaw

Main Course: Mahi Mahi with assorted citrus fruits and chopped veggies

Dessert: Flourless chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream

All three of these things were absolutely amazing. The BBQ sauce for the shrimp was the perfect combination of tangy and sweet, the mahi mahi was tender and juicy and was complimented by the citrus and veggies, and the cake... well.  It was super rich and so chocolatey, I was only able to finish half.

A few other dishes I tasted but didn't order:

Appetizer: Dried Beef & Carpaccio salad (a strong taste... different but tasty)

Main course: chicken main course (I forgot what was on it, but the chicken was super juicy and flavorful), Angel hair pasta (probably my least favorite option out of all the dishes... but still, not too bad... just not very exciting)

Dessert: Sorbet trio (it was mango, pineapple, and coconut... TASTY), creme brulee (very creamy)

Seriously. So good. Go eat there. Definitely worth the money.

Also, I've never had better service at any other restaurant. EVER.  The waiter called me ""Miss"" about 20x throughout the course of our lunch.",pULRA0ALAnDSN3W8Alb4_g,1,0,5,RwJZDz5QlMu_AYYieiZrzw

If you are planning a trip to Las Vegas, you must go to this restaurant.

The Jordan's have in my opinion the prefect restaurant for any occasion.  Everything here is stellar.  Food, presentation, ambiance, service.  If I could give this establishment more than 5 stars I would.

This past weekend was my second visit to Rosemary's and I was just in shock that any place could maintain such excellence.

Food tried:

Complimentary Dinner rolls- (addictive, freshly baked in house and just plain wrong on so many levels.)

Appetizers-

Prosciutto Wrapped Sonoma Goat Cheese Stuffed Figs.  
(Warm, soft, delicate, complex flavors that linger.  Very Satisfying...but somewhat on the heavier side, although the figs provide a good balance.)

Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp
(Unbelievable-  The shrimp, the sauce, the bed of Blue Cheese Slaw.....I am sure Jesus dines on this every night.)

Smoke Duck Breast Salad
(The most perfectly cooked duck I have ever tried.  The assortment of berries and greens were a perfect match to the duck.)

Roasted Rack of Lamb
(Served Medium Rare....the most tender delicious meat I have had in a while.  I have ordered this twice and so far, both times it has been one of the most satisfying entrees I have ever had.)

Dessert
Apple Tart w/cinnamon ice cream.  Good, although after such a big meal, next to impossible to truly enjoy since I had stuffed myself.",SRz0Q-tsPd1SU8bvFi_ToA,5,7,5,cznyEP0me3EVcY7yOeAxWw

Prix Fixe, with wilted spinach, goat cheese, and pecans, a veal entree, and chocolate bread pudding with peanut butter sauce and banana ice cream for dessert. Every bottle of wine on the menu was half off, as they are every Sunday, and all of a sudden bottles that I could never look twice at were a bargain.

The exterior of Rosemary's is, well, a strip mall, but walking inside feels like opening a present wrapped in brown paper. Sure, it's boring on the outside, but who remembers the paper anyway?

The service was just shy of overly attentive. Every few sips of wine our glasses were refilled. The timing of all of our courses kept us from waiting too long, while not feeling rushed at the same time.

Our waitress was both professional and casual, making great suggestions, keeping up friendly banter, and ensuring that every one of our courses was to our liking.

There were 8 of us girls and we all got the prix fixe, so make no mistake there were a lot of food.  We went though and through the menu, maybe next time, if I have the opportunity to come here again, I will have a better meal. 

I had the risotto, some special salad of the night, and the prime rib-eye... I have to say I am like the risotto appetizer, I think we were all impressed by the appetizer, and the overall service.  Oh and, the chef gave all of us a taste of this beef angel hair cold noodle appetizer, that was great. 

It all went down hill after the appetizer.  The sweet corn soup my friends had was way too sweet.  The salad was too sweet, the strong flavor of the smoked bacon didn't go well with the sweetness and the oil that soaks the salad.  The steak meat quality was excellent, but the BBQ + A1 sauce was not a compliment to the steak at all, the sauce made the steak unbearable and tasted cheap, the sauce itself brought the overall quality way down, not to mention the chef did not cut off all the very fatty unedible part of the meat. 

The desert was not very impressive, neither... 

The overall decor of the restaurant is cozy and comfortable with like typical American higher-end restaurant (this is suppose to be a French restaurant?), however few of my friends are skinnier and thought the chair were uncomfortable to sit on, so I don't think it's so acceptable.  

The service was great!  They match your napkin with what you are wearing.  All girls wearing black dress got black napkin, I like that.

3972841,2011-05-06,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"I have been going to try Rosemary's for quite awhile.  It's just down the street a few miles, but I never got around to it.  I recently got a gift certificate for Rosemary's as a result of an NPR donation so off I was to try it out.  I had spoken to a friend who's been here with his wife several times, and I decided to sit where he suggested.  When I arrived about 15 minutes early, I requested a seat at the rear food bar.  There is a counter that looks directly into the cooking area with the two grills and you can watch Leonard and Jason do their magic--along with the rest.

I decided to do the 5 course tasting menu.  Smart idea--it was great.  I had two amuse-bouche--an eggplant caviar on a fried wonton and sauteed mushrooms.  

The courses:

First:  Duo of Tartars - Beef and salmon tartars.  The beef tartar was on a soft boiled egg, part on each egg half.  Very nice plating.

Second:  Pan seared pompano on a bed of sauteed spinach.  This was the first time I had pompano and I was pleased with the taste of the pompano and I liked it a lot.

Third:  Texas BBQ shrimp with Maytag blue cheese slaw.  Outstanding!  The combination of BBQ sauce with the blue cheese and slaw was amazing!

Fourth:  Rack of Lamb over sauteed kale.  Another winner!  Perfect rare cooking for the lamb and very tasty.  I wanted to gnaw on the bones.

Fifth:  Dessert - this was a trio of desserts - creme brulee, chocolate cake, and a beer float.  Since I had no alcohol, the server asked if I'd want root beer instead of the lambic beer they use and I chose the root beer.  The trio was quite tasty, especially the creme brulee.

After dessert, I was brought some mignardises, a brownie,  a lemon square, and a peanut butter cookie.

Service was impeccable.  Before my iced tea was finished, the server brought me a fresh glass when I had less than 1/3 left.  He asked me again later if I need another replacement and he was there in a few moments.

Some of my friends from Yelp have mentioned the saltiness of some things.  I noticed that last night, but as a person to loves salt, it was not an issue for me.  You might want to be aware of this in advance.

I have to say a word about my seating.  SInce I dined alone, this was just perfect.  I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff do their thing and it was great fun to watch the ballet of grilling, searing, sauteeing, and plating that took place before me.  Even if you were there with a significant other, it would be a good place to sit but not for a romantic dinner.

So, for our first time, we decided to ""Go big or go home."" (As my friend put it!)  We had one of everything and shared it all.  We chose to do the prix fixe menu.  This seemed like the best deal and in keeping with our mission statement to try everything.  And it was ladies night (50% off for ladies on food plus an 18% gratuity).

Here's what we got:

Parmaesan souffle

Texas BBQ shrimp - blue cheese coleslaw was so good.  very creamy and the shrimp was cooked perfectly and not chewy like some jumbo shrimp can be.

Crab Boulettes - I was not a fan.  Bland.

Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio Salad - Order this! so good if you love carpaccio and I definitely do!

Arugula, Endive & Radicchio - Excellent.  Basic salad

Some other salad which was on the specials menu - Don't recall anything other than thinking it was good.

Milk Fed Veal Porterhouse - I didn't try my friend's dish, but she professed her undying love to it.  Repeatedly.  So I assume it was good.

Seared Sea Scallops - The scallops were cooked perfectly.  My friend had to keep stabbing me with her fork to keep me out of this.  The prosciutto really sent this over the edge into heavenly.  Very yummy.

Prime NY Strip - This was excellent and a really big portion.  My friend had enough for lunch the next day.  This is one of the dishes which has an additional $5 surcharge on the prix fixe menu, but worth every penny.

Striped bass - I ordered a bass dish off of the specials menu.  It had scallops and some sort of cream sauce.  I thought the fish was really well cooked but the scallops were kind of rubbery.  Especially when compared to my friends seared sea scallops.

Although there were a few misses, overall I found Rosemary's to be pretty out of this world.  So glad I finally made it here.  It was nice to go to a nice restaurant off strip.  I get really tired of walking a mile in a casino for a great meal.  Four ladies, tons of food, copious amounts of alcohol and our total bill was $230.

We started with the Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles .. I have to say it's one of the best Carpaccio appetizers I have had in Vegas. The flavors blend wonderfully in you mouth and the thinly sliced beef just melts in your mouth. They also offered the Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio and it was a tough decision between the two. I overheard the woman at the next table say the Tuna was also delicious! 

The Angel Hair Pasta was yummy as well, but the Coconut Bread Pudding was to die for! It's comes out warm, and is topped with chocolate and has a side of vanilla icecream .. it kinda reminds me of a cross between a coconut macaroon and butter mochi. YUM.

I saw Rosemary's on Yelp and Chowhound and decided to check it out. Thanks to Mike C for the heads up on the restaurant.com certificate which I also used. Food roundup:

Appetizer of BBQ shrimp: Nice and plump perfectly seared shrimp with bbq sauce on top. It also comes with some creamy blue cheese coleslaw, very funkalicious. Whole dish kinda creamy and rich, could've used some citrus to brighten it up. Still tasty.

Entrees of seared scallops and salmon: Both of these were cooked beautifully and tasty. Parsnip puree with scallops a bit lukewarm, but loved the fried thin parsnip garnish. Sauces also were nice with these dishes.

Dessert of bread pudding: I don't remember exactly what it consisted of, but it was warm and tasty with some nice ice cream.

Lowdown: Great random place (strip mall) for some well-executed, straightforward, delicious food. Nothing is going to be out there, completely new, or innovative...just tasty. There's a lot of restaurants at this price level who try to do the same type of thing, but fail, Rosemary's does it right. Also, they have awesome service: asking for any food allergies, folding your napkin when you go to the restroom, just anticipating your every need and exceeding expectations. I see why locals and tourist alike come here, you're treated like royalty. I was taken a bit aback, but it's their thing. If you've got a car, nice place to go.

We were late for out reservations but they were very kind to seat us promptly and we informed them that we had to leave within two hours to make a show. They were very receptive to this. Out waitstaff was amazing and friendly and I cannot say enough good things about them. Unfortunately the food was not so good.
The two of us ordered the 3 course menu for $55- which seems like a good deal.
We ordered:
-BBQ shrimp which was delicious although the highlite of the dish was not the shrimp but instead the cole-slaw with blue cheese underneath.
-Panko crusted scallop special served over grits. The scallops were fresh and tasty but ruined by the soggy panko mush on top and the bitter tasteless grits underneath.
- Caesar salad. Worst caesar salad I have ever had! The romaine was wilted and soft, the dressing was tasteless. I actually had to eat the anchovies whole to make the salad taste like anything.
- Lamb chops. Highlite of the meal. These were perfectly cooked and delicious but the mashed potato with olives  underneath were an awful combination. One bite was all I needed to make my decision on those.
- Sea Bass special. The fish was fresh and tasty but the potatoes and andouille underneath was cold and mushy as if the sous chefs could not get their timing right to plate it. I would have sent it back if I wasn't in a rush to make a show.
- Flourless chocolate cake. This was delicious but I have never eaten something chocolate that I didn't like.

All in all I won't go out of my way to eat here again. I will stay on the strip where the prices are higher but so is the competition thus the food is more consistently good.",Q5zxztnhEqgrpmLbuH0e0A,0,0,3,ahjDkhIydW1DFtVfa6hBGg

4339322,2010-05-25,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"We were in town for the weekend and found this place on Yelp. It took a lot of convincing to get our party of 15 to agree to travel outside the strip for dinner, but it was soooo worth it. 

Everything just worked out perfectly. I called that afternoon several times and finally got ahold of someone. I was so excited when they agreed to accommodate our large party at 8PM. They asked if we were celebrating any birthdays and when I told them yes, they did something special for that person for dessert.

The pre-fixe menu is a great deal, but you can also order ala carte. The portions are generous, so no one left the place hungry. I had the warm spinach goat cheese salad. Yum! The crawfish risotto was apparently very good too. I ordered the angel hair pasta for dinner... I am sure there are better things on the menu, but I'm not much of a meat eater. The apple tart was very good too...though I was really very stuffed and should have stopped eating after the salad! The only odd part about the meal was the mountain of butter that they served with the rolls...seriously, I have never seen so much butter... yum!

The service was top notch. The waiters take their jobs seriously and it showed. Everytime I went to the ladies room, there was someone there to greet me and pull out my chair for me when I got back to our table. I was never without wine in my glass and the dining experience was similar to what you would get at a 5 star restaurant. Believe me, you'll get over the fact that it's in a strip mall real fast.

Our table was nice and roomy...we didn't feel crammed, rushed, or unwelcomed -as large parties in Vegas might sometimes feel.

They served us all a delicious amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal and every dish was served all at once... no one waiting around for their dish to show up. Everything was nice and hot cooked perfectly.

The cost was about $75 per person...considering we ordered 5 bottles of wine at $60 a pop...that is really inexpensive and well worth the cab ride to the restaurant.

To top it off, the restaurant called me to day to find out how I enjoyed my dining experience.... how nice is that???

I would definitely come back here whenever I return to Vegas...which could be awhile given my lack of luck in the casinos.",TvyjBnEAe2JsQEtJ42KjIA,3,1,5,JwWy9hvKlVnMl9aBk62dBw

As previously stated, it's located in a strip mall which makes you think that the restaurant that everyone speaks so highly of may not be what you are expecting. *buzzer* WRONG! You walk into Rosemary's and the idea you had of entering a nail salon is quickly diminished. You walk in and are immediately taken to a beautiful restaurant that looks as if it is in a high-end casino and hotel. The wait staff is eager to serve you and is ready to make sure that your entire experience is a positive one.

Our server, Theresa, was awesome. She went over the menu with us and explained that we could choose most anything and make it a 3-course Prix Fixe meal. 

While looking at the menu, hubby and I choose some appetizers. I opted for the Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle which is a regular souffle which has replaced sugar with Parmesan cheese.  Hubby chose their BBQ Shrimp. Both were mouthwatering and fantastic. You wanted to just order more of it and make it a meal. This was only after the chef gifted you with his special creation of the night. I can't remember what we were given but, just like the appetizers, you wanted more.

As my main course, I chose the filet of beef. Hubby opted for the veal. While both were amazing, the filet just blew us both out of the water. When we go back, and we WILL be going back, we have both decided to have the filet. It came with asparagus and some extremely tasty potato fritters. I could not finish my meal but I could have continued eating until I made myself sick and it would have been worth every moan. My food was so good that I took it with me in hopes of getting hungry later so I could finish it. Alas, it never happened, but the thought of it was enticing.

Upon completion of our meal, Theresa asked how everything was and I couldn't even vocalize just how good everything was. She quipped, ""We have to try extra hard to please. I mean, we are next to a dollar store."" Which is so true. It took about 15-20 minutes to get to Rosemary's since it is off the strip. To stress just how good it is, I would be willing to look at local bus schedules to get my butt there if I was without my car and the taxi drive would prove to break the bank.

So if the other reviews haven't convinced you to get out to Rosemary's the next time you're in Vegas, I hope mine has. It really is not to be missed.",5zzP3HvPaGjtVYiIvRd6Mg,9,5,5,t0A9-sEKzL4g8FeuDsSuBw

The steak was the favorite for the entree and for dessert, the coconut bread pudding tasted exactly like a warm almond joy.

4474141,2009-08-30,1,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"My wife and I wanted to get away for a short weekend to celebrate our 10 year anniversary, so like most So Cal residents Vegas was a sure bet.  Thanks to Yelp, we found this gem of a little restaurant for our celebration dinner.  Better yet, I was also able to purchase the $ 25 gift certificate for $ 2 at Restaurant.com using a coupon code.   The only requirement in using the certificate was to just spend $ 50.   At first, my wife was a little hesitant, especially seeing that the location was off the strip.  But I showed her all the glowing reviews from fellow Yelpers, and she thought it was worth a try.  

We arrived and no kidding, this place is in the middle of a strip mall...not to much to look at from the outside.  Once inside, the surroundings were very nice and classy.  The service was prompt, we were seated in a nice little corner.  To our delight, we were congratulated by the staff at least 5 times within the first 10 minutes of sitting down....nice that the make it a point to acknowledge the special occasion. 

Looking through the menu I was first pleasantly surprised at some of the items...Foie Gras, Sweet Breads, Aussie Barramundi...they don't mess around.  We both opted for the Prix Fixe menu.  I had the Crab Boulet to start, while my wife had a nice spinach salad topped with hazelnuts, blue cheese, and pears.   Both were delicious, the boulet was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy inside...and had a nice bit of crab in it too...reminded me of a cross between a crab cake and a hush puppy.  Honestly, I was quite full by the time I finished the third boulet....I know they give you three of these puppies!

As we waited for the entree to arrive, the chef sent over a nice tasting of something he was thinking of putting on the menu....vegetable bread pudding.  Sounds a little iffy, but not at all.  This would make a great side dish!  For the main course, my wife had the halibut, and I had the grilled cajun prime rib eye steak.  Both dishes were great! The fish was cooked perfectly, a nice crispy crust while still tender and moist on the inside.   My steak...at a loss for words..da bomb.!  Easily ""The"" best steak I've had anywhere, to top it off this thing was huge...20 0z, and was served with a side of some incredible cheese grits, and a nice wine sauce.   Needless to say after this, we were stuffed (I was only able to polish off 1/2 of the steak at best).  

Now for desert, I had the apple tart served ala mode with a side of vanilla ice cream and my wife had the chocolate bread pudding served with banana ice cream and side of peanut butter sauce.   Both deserts were great, but they wouldn't stop sending food...the chef then sent us a tasting of hand made chocolates....were in a food coma by this point. 

Bottom line, this is a great place for any occasion. What made the restaurant stood out was not just the eclectic menu, but most of all its the service.  I saw numerous times where the wait staff nearly tripped over themselves trying to beat a guest to their table so that they could pull out the chair!  Yeah...there are those fancy and pricey restaurants on the strip, but for 1/2 the price you get the same high quality exquisitely prepared food with a staff that will put most restaurants to shame...nuff said.",byc5auHaEfCjy3QmeK-dYg,3,3,5,mWoA5V0Gk7GIxVsZ9VrwvQ

When I go home I try to steer clear of the strip and go in search for the city's soul -- so when I read about Rosemary's I was intrigued. A peek at the menu and I realized this would be a splurge but not so much that I would break the bank. 

I took my parents, who still live in LV, and it was unanimous -- hidden behind a draped doorway, in just another innocuous strip mall, beats a culinary heart and a giving soul. Having long given up on the search for a good restaurant nearby, Mom and Dad were surprised to find a local restaurant so close to home. And, so good! 

From the bufala appetizer to the delicious desert cookies -- we were in heaven. The wine list offered selections that paired well with the food but didn't inspire me to explore something new -- although that's not a deal breaker -- this may be disappointing to a true vinophile. And, if it is, Rosemary's is worthy of your coveted bottle beginning with the word 'Chateau'. Bring it with you to celebrate the season of love or just to celebrate discovering an excellent new restaurant without the continuous soundtrack of mega bucks in the background.

I held back from 5 stars due to the slow service. Slow and steady is fine especially when savoring flavors -- but it bordered on inattentive at times. I have a feeling Rosemary's will continue to improve their service and impress with their food  -- so I'm looking forward to returning and adding to this star.",gXlhd8E7yKP3db5xdgVEbA,2,0,4,qF5CRGtW_pTXvg0ZwHECog

Good thing I noticed the bacon right as the plate was being set down because nobody ever came to ask if our entrees were okay.

The pricing was reasonable--$28 for a 3 course prix fixe lunch (I think they only serve lunch on Fridays).  The presentation of all the dishes is really nice.

They have a nice bar area as you first walk in with high top seating options. We sat here before our table was ready and we were lucky enough to catch happy hour (which goes till 7). The restaurant has 2 different rooms for seating (both connected though a doorway). Depending upon your mood you may want to make a request as to which one you prefer.

It's the only item on the menu that has been consistently on the menu (since the restaurant opened 12 years ago.)  Even after I had the last bite I was still craving it.  My husband ordered the risotto starter and Tasso crusted salmon. Both were delicious. 

Entrees are pricey here ($37 range). They also offer a chef tasting menu ($80) and a fixed prix menu ($55).

It could be that we ordered the wrong food or simply this is just not my type of restaurant.  

I had book-marked Rosemary's Restaurant for more than a year.  As often as I come to Vegas, I hadn't made it here until last Monday, 11/23/09.  The restaurant is in a strip mall.  From the exterior, it's unassuming, but the interior decor and atmosphere make this place cozy and charming.  

We arrived 20 minutes early than our reservation, but were seated quickly.  2 assistant servers came to introduce themselves and who our server would be.  Service was very attentive, too attentive to the point that I actually felt unease.  The assistant servers walked around and checked on us so often as if we were being rushed to finished our food so they can take the plates, which they had asked a couple of times if we were done and if they could take the plates.  'No, not yet!'.  

We ordered the following:

Appetizer - Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw ($14.50).  This was EXCELLENT!  The shrimps were grilled to perfection with the right smoke flavor.  The slaw was creamy and crunchy.  5 stars!

Entree - Brick Chicken with Haricot Vert, Shoestring Potatoes & Dijonnaise Sauce ($30).  I had the Oven Brick Chicken at the AT LAST CAFE in Long Beach and it was so good that I thought I'd try it here at the Rosemary's.  I took one bite and it was nothing like At Last Cafe!  The skin was not crispy and the meat tasted mushy.  By mushy I meant it almost seemed it's got 'filler' in it.  While the skin tasted salty, the meat itself tasted sweet.  It was just a really weird combination.  I also didn't care for the shoestring potatoes.  It didn't add anything to the chicken (other than the presentation) and were really hard to eat.  

My fiance had Roasted Filet of Beef and Horseradish Soufflé Potatoes, Onion Marmalade, Hydroponic Watercress & Bourbon Green Peppercorn Sauce ($40).  This was a HUGE disappointment.  The beef was tasteless.  Even the sauce failed to add any more flavor to it.  

I got a phone call from the restaurant to see how everything was.  I think the lady expected me to rave about the food.  Unfortunately I had to tell her it was disappointing.  Maybe I'll give it another try next time, or maybe not.",VVMqxCARIOdUzpqngpFMgA,7,7,2,sQ9HVY3iwDwc2NypNJZXtQ
4846144,2010-01-16,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"This is the best-run restaurant my husband and I have ever been to in our lives together and separate. 
The service is impeccable even before our arrival and continued after we left:
-they called to confirm our reservation (nothing special, but i'm just getting started here).
-took our coats when we came in the door.
- pulled out BOTH our chairs at the same time. 
- refolded our napkins immediately after one got up to go to the restroom.
- a server was going the opposite way as my husband on his way back to his seat from the restroom, server stepped aside, let him pass and turned around and followed him to his seat so that he could pull out his chair!
-the for both of us not only arrived at the same time, but was always LAYED DOWN ON THE TABLE AT THE SAME TIME! and we observed larger parties around us and it's the same no matter how many people (so 3 people would bring out the food for a party of 6 so all 6 plates would touch the table at the same time)
-server was knowledgeable, friendly and professional. 
-we tried to buy a book, but they didn't have any, so they shipped it to us for free (free shipping not free book) and had Michael sign it for us. 
-They called a week after our meal to get feedback and to tell us that our book was on its way--no wonder everything is perfect! It's obvious that they care very much about improving, even though I'd say there's no more room for improvement. 

Food was great, but it didn't blow my socks off like I thought it would, it's probably because I hyped it up too much in my head; it's not as innovative as I thought it would be, though everything is very well executed. The dessert was underwhelming. We each had a $55 prix fixe menu, it was ladies night, so my food was half off, but still we managed to end up paying $200 after tax & tip & book. 

I'm uploading photos of:
appetizer: crabcakes (I thought pretty good, DH loved)
veal sweetbread (I didn't like, DH liked very much). 

main course: veal (we both loved) 
lamb chop (I liked the rare parts very much, he liked all of it very much)

desert:
chocolate cake (I liked, DH liked)
apple tarte (DH liked, I didn't try).",PaBOdDfrgs1n4qPWNlUARA,0,0,5,mkiNi-9dxkBXA9Y98Vko3Q

YOU EAT (however, not to excess) and don't let the fact that Rosemary's is sandwiched between Stein Mart and Dollar Tree scare you away. I think the owners had a REASON for placing this treasure 30 minutes from Las Vegas Blvd. 

Don't get me wrong, we've eaten at many of the ""Celebrity Chef"" places in the various casinos, but whoever said Rosemary's was the best HANDS DOWN in Vegas, was right.

Without knowing Sunday was 1/2 price wine night, we made reservations for Sunday, March 30th. Our Wait Staff, Justin & Katie, were about the best we've had anywhere. Attentive, without hovering, friendly, knowledgeable and obviously very well trained - Not once did anyone say ""How ya guys doing tonight?' I HATE THAT!!! I overheard one of the other Wait Staff telling of the history of Rosemary's and how the restaurant was named after the owner's Mother and how they had moved to the present location about 9 years ago, etc. I LOVE stuff like that!

We opted for the 3-course prix fixe menu and splurged on a bottle of wine - an Australian sauvignon blanc that we'd had before - since it was 1/2 price. We did try the signature Texas BBQ shrimp even though the thought of shrimp paired with blue cheese seemed...odd... and it was FABULOUS! The warm white chocolate dinner rolls (yes, white chocolate) were orgasmic; Katie even tucked 4 extra into a box for us to take back to our hotel to have with our coffee in the morning. WOW, a sweet reminder of the night before.

Rosemary's is romantic and the dining room was dimly lit. If I had to say one negative thing, it's a very minor negative, the portions are really generous, so show up hungry if you decide on the 3-course or 5-course prix fixe menus. We didn't have room for dessert but a small plate of sweets came at the end of our meal: 2 dark chocolate truffles, 2 lemon squares and 2 buckeyes. A perfect ending.

I'd give Rosemary's more stars but Yelp only goes up to 5 and I'd give 5 stars just for the service alone. When we go back, and we will, I hope Justin and Katie are still there.",nuG5UpCvswNdDXJP_Efl8Q,2,1,5,PomCm_o0_9DnKeZYxugfLQ

Rack of lamb and broiled scallops were perfectly prepared and presented. Great selection of very interesting appetizers. Parmesan souffle, salmon tartare, risotto were all nicely prepared.

4888140,2010-07-12,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"While there are tons of great reviews here on Yelp, I feel that Rosemary's Restaurant deserves all of it so I will add mine as well. This place was soooo good, all the way around. Great service. Fantastic food. Yummy dessert. Tasty drinks. As everyone has mentioned, this place is tucked away in a strip mall about 15 minutes from the strip. Not hard to find though but off the beaten path. 

We dined on a Wednesday night which is ladies night so we received a 50% discount - great deal! We both opted for the 3 course tasting menu which essentially allows you to order anything you want from the menu as long as one entree is included. It's the first 'tasting menu' I have ever experienced like this. We both chose appetizers, entree, dessert but you could choose 2 appetizers and an entree and I suppose an entrees and 2 desserts if you wanted.

The chef provided a bite of a FABULOUS veggie quiche sort of thing before we began our meal. It was sooo yummy - I would have loved a few more bites! Then I had the Tasso Ham and Crawfish Risotto as my starting course while M had the Caesar Salad. Both were delicious. The risotto was a little spicy but done just right - a little burn, not a big fire in my mouth. Then I chose a special entree they were offering that night which was a crispy skin striped sea bass. M chose the Ribeye. Again, both were absolutely DELICIOUS. For dessert I had the pecan tart and she had the apple tart. Yum yum yum. Again, the chef provided a dessert tasting as well which includes bites of lemon bars, brownies, and peanut butter buckeyes. The buckeyes were my favorite of the three.

I also feel that I should point out the service was impeccable. Very on the ball but not overbearing. And, even though it wasn't extremely busy while we were there they had enough servers to take care of a party of 8 nearby and delivered all 8 entrees simultaneously, one server per person. 

The bread was good. The drinks were good. Really, there is nothing to complain about. It was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time!",VX-dXFNRffoQuzHKIWdrtw,0,0,5,FCdXGK2ihes4uYCuZu6m5A

4957163,2010-09-25,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Had my first Rosemary's experience last night, and I was blown away. This is definitely one of Las Vegas' best kept secrets.

My girlfriend and I had reservations at 7:15, but we arrived at about 6:15 to take advantage of happy (4-7 everyday) hour. The service was impeccable -- and we were sitting at a bar table. We had two appetizers -- the sweet corn soup is amazing -- and six cocktails for around $70 including tip.

The staff at this restaurant is absolutely amazing. One would've thought that we were at a much more expensive restaurant. Our chairs were pulled out for us when we were seated, my girl friend was given a black napkin to better match her dark dress, and those napkins were folded for us before we returned from using the restrooms.

The food follows the impeccable service. Every thing melts in your mouth from the bread to the main course to dessert. The staff is very helpful offering opinions on menu options, and every menu item is paired with both a beer and wine selection that goes best with it.

My girlfriend had been here before, and she knew of the amazing peanut butter buckeyes offered for dessert -- free of charge. Were talking about them when our server came to the table, and she offered to get us the restaurant's cookbook. I've never been to any other restaurant that has offered to share their recipes with their customers.

Although I couldn't see coming here on a daily bases due the higher prices compared to chain restaurants, for example,  I will definitely be returning as you definitely get your money's worth and then some.

There are only two minor down sides. The first is that reservations are a must. There are also tables available in the bar section that are reserved. We saw at least two couples that had to be politely turned away on a busy friday night because they did not have reservations. Secondly, the main dinning room was a bit on the cold side. This is likely due to the fact that the kitchen opens up to the dinning room -- which is another amazing feature of this restaurant.",jnBBQOyN1apWBSsZkzFnCQ,1,0,5,rwMQoa6IKIXdrOV3SUnQGA
4960768,2011-06-01,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Came in a group of 9 so I was lucky to be able to try multiple dishes on one visit.  Staff were very polite & courteous.  Used multiple Costco giftcards (costco.com if you're from out of state), so the value of the dinner was even better :) 

Appetizers:
*Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio (5 stars): light, fresh, simply delicious.  This was everyone's favorite.  
*Twice Baked Parmesan Soufflé (3.5 stars): first few bites are good, then it becomes too cheesy.  Fluffy and light, yet full of flavor...it sits in a cheese sauce too...I love cheese & even I thought it became too much after a few bites.  But then again, I have a habit of liking to clean my plate & not wasting food.
*Cornmeal Fried Oysters (4 stars):  Good, but not that special; tastes exactly how it sounds.  I wouldn't order this unless you LOVE fried oysters so much that you'd be willing to miss out trying better appetizers offered. This dish is yummy tho, so I don't want to downplay it.
*Foie gras (3 stars): We paid extra to try this (not part of prefixed menu).  It was seared foie gras on a soggy bread/pancake thing; I was disappointed by it.  I've had much better foie gras.. I like my foie gras more seared..& this one just didn't have too much flavor..I also did not like the soggy bread/pancake thing it sat on at all.

Main Course:
*Special of day: braised lamb (5 stars): WOW....the meat is so tender, it doesn't require a knife to cut..the meat falls off the bone.  No game taste at all...one of the best lamb i've ever had.  Marinated to perfection.
*Roasted Rack of Lamb (5 stars):  Another WOW.  Similar to above, no game taste, tender meat, and just plain amazing.  Between the 2 lambs, I can't even choose which one is better b/c they're both equally amazing.  
*Moroccan Spiced Sea Scallops (4 stars): Well prepared.  Soft, no-ocean taste, fresh.  Sits in a light curry sauce.  

Dessert:
*Crème Brulee (5 stars): DELICIOUS.  Creamy, soft inside with light, crunchy caramelized sugar on top.  I've had plenty of good creme brulee before, but this one just stands out...loved this dessert...not even a scrap leftover.
*Panna Cotta w/ strawberries (5 stars):  As delicious as the creme brulee above (these 2 were the table favorites).  The strawberries were nice & sweet and the panna cotta was done just right..not too sweet and had a nice soft, creamy texture.  I would order this one over the creme brulee only b/c it's harder to find good panna cotta than it is to find good creme brulee.
*Seasonal Ice Creams or Sorbets (4 stars):  cookies w/ 3 scoops of different flavors of icecream or sorbet gave nice variety.  Nice palette cleanser, but the 2 above desserts are much better choices.

Petit-fours: Lemon cake, peanut butter w/ rice crispy ball, and chocolate fudge.  Best piece was the peanut butter ball...i liked the crunch of the rice krispies in it.  The other 2 were only ok...",53EWBX2QGISTDZJ1NZfyrA,0,0,4,nTcSxujdSIF6hyNVoxZvBg

4974822,2006-11-28,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"A FABULOUS choice for lunch on weekdays, if you can steal away for a moment for the five star service and delicious food!  

They are two choices for lunch - a la carte or the prix-fix menu at $25!  And at $25, what a steal!  How could I resist?  I have already heard great things about this place by my Vegas go to man, so how can I say no?!  (I tried going on a weekend and only discovered then that they weren't open for lunch on weekends!  Wow!)  At Rosemary's, there is a good selection of starters, entrees, and desserts to choose from for the prix-fix menu, making this place an ideal choice for a variety of palates.

To start, I had the recommended Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.  What a fabulous and light salad to start with!  The cheese is swirled into the beef and has an amazing mix of flavors going on in your mouth!  Yum yum!

My entree was the Soy Marinated Bistro Filet Kabobs with Prosciutto-Wild Mushroom Hash, Micro Greens & Caramelized Shallot Reduction Sauce.  The kabobs came on two skewer sticks.  They were small pieces of beef, but full of flavor.  The mix of mushrooms and greens complemented the dish well.  My companion had his favorite - the Crispy Leg of Duck Confit on a bed of French Green Lentils with a Brandy Green Peppercorn Sauce. The crispy skin of the duck was full of flavor, but the dish wasn't a particular favorite of mine.  I was more pleased with my beef kabobs.

For dessert, I closed with the Chocolate Flourless Cake with Scotch Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Ice Cream.  I noticed they were offering Peppermint Ice Cream in another dessert and asked if they could substitute the vanilla for peppermint and it was done!  The toasted almond slivers added a nice crunch to the cake and sweet ice cream.  The cookie underneath the ice cream also added a nice bite to the lovely dessert as well.  I was pleased with my choice!  My companion had the Goat Cheese Cheesecake with Scotch Caramel Sauce.  The goat cheese was a bit heavy for me, especially after my very filling starter and entree, so I was glad I stuck with my chocolate cake.  He seemed quite content with the stronger tasting and pungent dessert than I.

Service - amazingly fabulous!  Servers here are particularly anal and I love it!  The old school way of serving from the left and taking from the right applies here!  And my favorite - the waiters wait until all plates are present and they are set down in front of each diner at the same time.  Love it!  They also fold your napkin and push in your chair should you use the restroom during your meal.  This place works fabulously as a team and they get FIVE stars on service alone!  (This was just for lunch too!)  I can't wait to go back for more!

Side note: Check out their website for various promotions going on like half price wine night on Sundays and ladies' night on Wednesdays, which means half off!  You can even purchase $100 GC for $79.99 at Las Vegas Costcos!

Update!  02/02/08 - Had the pleasure of having their prix-fix lunch here again today and couldn't pass up the ""Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.""  It's so good that the BF and I each order our own plate.  (We usually like to get different things and share, but this one is so good we just want our own!)

For the main, I had the ""Creole Seasoned Shrimp with Anson Mills Carolina Cheesy Quick Grits, Andouille Red Bean Sauce & Grilled Green Onion.""  It was so much food!  Embarrassingly, I couldn't finish it all!  Too much grits!  

The BF had ""Rosie's Monte Cristo - Ham, Turkey & Cantal Cheese on Battered Dipped Brioche with Crispy Onion Crust.""  I especially liked his flaky and light onion rings.  Again, very plentiful and he couldn't finish it all either!

The BF ordered some kind of dessert that I forgot the name of.  The waiter said it was really good, but it was alright to us.  (You can check out the photos from the business profile and tell me what it was!)  I had the trio of seasonal sorbets because you can never go wrong with seasonal sorbets!  Yum yum!

We had to sit in the front this time since there were no tables available where we could sit side by side.  Service was still good for the most part, but I think it's a bit better when you're inside.  And I should mention the yummy bread rolls they give you in the beginning, oh so good!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,2,3,5,OF01E0Eem9teRU5Pc2qj0w

I wanted to eat like the locals do. So my friends and I headed over to Rosemary's...rumored to be one of the best restaurants in Vegas.

Our entire table ordered the five course meal which was an easy way out; I mean, we were staring at that menu for a looooong time because everything sounded so good. Believe it or not, it was actually a good value (strange term to be used in an upscale restaurant) and featured the chef's favorite items. And as someone had mentioned elsewhere, you can choose a wine or beer pairing if you like. None of us did or we wouldn't have made it out the door to our next destination. 

Strangely enough, as great as the food was, that's not what impressed me the most. The service was really....different. Usually I go to these expensive restaurants, and expect it to be kinda stuffy; I feel a bit like a kid, struggling to sit properly. But Rosemary's isn't like that. The service is stellar. They cater to your every whim just like they do at any other upscale restaurant, but the dining room isn't darkened with hushed voices from other patrons. It's lively and bright, just like the servers. 

Our adorable server was full of anecdotes and little stories about the dishes and of his own interesting past in the restaurant business.

5058218,2009-11-09,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Only in Las Vegas can a fine dining restaurant the caliber of Rosemary's exist in the same strip mall as a restaurant called the ""Krazy Buffet"". But once you get into Rosemary's, you realize that it's the real deal. The ambiance of the room is pleasant, basically what you'd expect from a neighborhood fine dining restaurant. Even with the open kitchen, the room was moderately lit and fairly quiet, with a clientele of mainly couples in their fifties. The bar up front is small but perfect for couples waiting for other guests to join them, with a friendly bartender and probably the best selection of Belgium beers I've seen in the city.

The food we had was excellent, particularly the specials they had for the evening. My rib eye steak was delicious, though particularly fatty even for a rib eye. The other guests at our table really enjoyed their food as well, and we wanted to really like Rosemary's. Unfortunately the service was such that I doubt we'll be going back any time soon.

To be fair, it all came down to our particular server, who was surly, humorless and did everything he could to make us feel uncomfortable short of being overtly rude. The service systems they have in place are excellent (all the food is brought to the table at once, offering napkins to match clothing etc.), but when your server frowns, doesn't tell you the wine selections being brought to your table and generally does everything with a sneer, by the end of the meal what should have been a great experience becomes tainted to say the least.

It's a shame really, because a great fine dining restaurant off the strip is something we have been looking for. And Rosemary's could have been that place we would go back to again and again.

Well, it has, and the place is outstanding.",O43tL4--1RlSe-0TDiPIdg,0,0,5,p5_Qck9wtj6u57pNG7uD8Q

From the reviews it sounded like the perfect Birthday restaurant for my wife. It was OK at best. 

Lets start from the top.
Place from the outside was not the typical fine dining restaurant, it's in a strip mall but I knew that from other reviews so didn't count that. 

Got seated right away with reservation, received menus and then sat there for 15 mins + after we closed them and put them on the side. 

Food: The gifts from the chef were a nice touch, they were good. 
Appetizers, the Risotto was good but heavy, the parm souffle was good as well but nothing special. 

Entree: Flank steak, I love flank steak because it has nice texture and flavor, this one has flavor but a little tough on certain parts, I cut my pieces against the grain but still a little chewy. 
Lamb chops: good but a couple of pieces had a lot of fat still on it which made it more gamey, I know I could of just trimmed it but it's fine dining... The mushrooms under the lamb was over buttered. 

So overall the food was good so 4 stars, the service was bad for fine dining standards though. The place is not big so how is it that the waiter seemed to be busy. He walked passed us a few times with his head in the clouds and ignored us. There is a waiter and his help but the waiter is the one for orders, checks, etc. He was not to be found for most of the night. 

Service was cold. Right before Dessert he asks "" wasn't is someone's birthday"" 
Yeah from the different color napkin my wife had and the person making sure she spelled my wife's name right, I assumed they would put her name on the dessert plate. Didn't happen, he probably forgot and did it last minute with a pre-done plate. 

Overall with all the options out there not worth it.",C7xugvjzMhmPkADOEGkQdw,5,1,2,8UEW_hZUkO28OmNFTFRR3Q

I love Yelp and the community. I'm always using the reviews to find the best food places in US but I usually don't write reviews myself because my english is so bad...
I also have to say that we have experienced many upscale restaurants both in Europe and US.

While we were in the US with my husband this summer, we've spent few days in Las Vegas and we wanted to experience some restaurants on the Strip but also one off the Strip to taste a true Vegas restaurant. 
When we saw all this unanimous reviews about Rosemary's Restaurant on Yelp (but also in the Zagat) we thought that the ""precious"" was found...
Generally, the reviews we found on Yelp were very useful but for Rosemary's, we were completely disapointed and disgusted.
We just can't understand this unanimity about this crappy place. I understand that for american people the service is important but for us, it was just too much. The waiters were omnipresent and with a fake kindness. Just ass-kissers!
Few days before we went to the French Laundry, the restaurant of Thomas Keller in Napa Valley. This is great service, discreet, relax and really professional! And we don't even evoke the food...

About the food in Rosemary's what to say? It's just nonsense! 
As recommended, we ordered the 3 course prix fixe. The 1st dish was the ""famous"" Texas BBQ Shrimp, the 'signature dish"". Just a salad with some shrimps you can't even taste because of this salty, sugared and unpleasant sauce. The crab boulettes were on the same tone, nothing special.
The real problem is that shrimps and crab weren't really good fresh products (frozen?), not what you expect from a grand restaurant! Same thing for the fish and the beef (perhaps one of the worse steak we had in US and it's $39 à la carte).
Maybe the desserts were the more eatable food in Rosemary but nothing to remember. In fact, we've already forgotten. Best thing was the californian Viogner Sauvignon blanc. Maybe because they don't make it...

It's a pity that I can't put zero star for Rosemary's... For $170 (without tip and we weren't very generous of course!), we prefer to eat excellent burgers in New York or a steak at Peter Lugger...",qBeLig8BeuU8D0lGYVA-4A,1,1,1,klGxhMPFo6yLJxI8wL60SQ

Excellent wine list and an interesting vegetable quick amuse bouche started the evening off well.
We opted not to do the prix fixe menu and ordered two salads, two entrees, and shared a dessert so the cost came out about the same.  My wife had the arrugula, endive, and radicchio salad and I had the wilted spinach withshallots and goat cheese.  Both were intresting and worth repeating.  She had the sea scallops with parsnip potato puree and apple cider beurre and they were excellent.  I had the veal tenderloin with fingerling potatoes and green peppercorn sauce.

The food was a little hit or miss for me. For my three courses, I went with a cauliflower soup, wilted winter green salad and the Jidori chicken. The soup was good. The wilted salad was delicious! Definitely the winner of the evening for me. However, the chicken was teetering dangerously on the edge of being overcooked, and when it originally arrived at the table it was perched on a moat of red sauce that was not tasty (and it wasn't visually appealing). We actually had them replate the chicken without the sauce, as there was no way to avoid it. I had visions of a juicy, tender succulent chicken, but this did not happen on my visit.

My husband swooned over their angel hair with crawfish small plate, but he had to send back a burnt scallop dish. The server remedied the situation promptly and did not charge us for the dish, so kudos for service!

Still, the overall impression was that there was just a little something off in the kitchen that night, or perhaps the real winners on the menu are the seafood items or something else I didn't order.

*Salmon crusted with proscuitto over cheddar mashed potatoes plated in a bloody mary butter (yup, the bloody mary butter is as insanely good as it sounds!!)

*Lamb chops glazed in balsalmic sauce.. MMMM

This is a classy and dressy kind of restaurant. With an atmosphere like Rosemary, this is a type of restaurant you'll never see me dine at. Once in a while, I need to use the Gold Credit Card and dine at nice places like here. 

We started out with endless refills of water. Our waiter suggested a Prix fixed meal for $55.00 per person. With little experience what is a Prix fixed meal and LiLy not being all that hungry, we went our separate ways and ordered a dish for ourselves. 

We were started with a pair of dinner rolls (one sweet and one savory).

She also had a glass of ""Old World"" Cabernet with her meal. You'll need to read her review for her take on her dish.

My higher-end steak was very moist and juicy. And the homemade steak sauce made my steak a added kick. I know, I can get an affordable Rib-eye Steak dinner elsewhere, but my presentation for my steak dinner absolutely blew me away.  I also enjoyed my dish with a ""New World"" Cabernet.

Enter confusion. Though only for a few minutes until we got inside.

Since we had a large group, we were eating off a predetermined menu with a couple choices for each course. Wine was ordered, poured, and drunk happily by the masses at the table. This is the kind of place where all the meals are served simultaneously. For our large party, that meant around 10 servers each holding two plates, and putting the meals down in unison.

We chose the three course prixe fixe meal, which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert for each person. We started with amuse bouche, which is like a little pre-appetizer. It was a delicious vegetable cake with caramelized, diced, vinegar-y onions on top. It was delicious, the sweet, tart combination of the onion and the cake was fantastic. It was followed by another, grits with mushrooms which were fantastic. The grits were creamy and fine, not gritty at all, and the mushrooms were tender and savory. James opted for the bbq shrimp with blue cheese slaw for his appetizer and I went with the duo of tartars, salmon and beef. Both were fantastic. The entrees we chose were lamb chops (James) and seared scallops (me). My scallops were simple and fantastic, served with creamed potatoes and mushrooms in a light broth that added just enough flavour. For dessert, James went with the chocolate cream pie and I had the trio of sorbets (of which the blackberry was best). Our waiter also brought out a special dessert, with the words ""Happy 1st Anniversary"" written in chocolate along the edge. 

Our meal took about 2 hours, so plan to spend time there. We never felt rushed, and even though the restaurant was a bit loud, it still felt intimate and we had no trouble talking to each other. Our waiter was attentive, but never intrusive and always asked us if we were satisfied with out orders. I had the impression that had we not been, he would have offered a different choice.

Faraway in the desert horizon, 20 minutes by cab from the Strip, sits a nondescript little restaurant right smack dab in a strip mall.

Impressive is the word I would use for Rosemary's. They take courteous and warm front of house staff to pair with the elegant and comforting New American/French cuisine brought forth from the kitchen. 

Our party of nine had many challenges: two people didn't eat meat, one person had an aggressive food allergy (garlic, onions and dairy), we came into the establishment with one extra person, and finally, half of us needed to make a show at 9pm. 

We sat at 6pm in an intimate dining room made exclusive for large parties next to a nice wine cellar. I ordered the prix fixe menu, where at $55 for three courses, was an overabundant amount of food. I started with an appetizer of fried sweetbreads, then had a warm spinach salad with a fried patty of goat cheese and candied walnuts. My main was a huge slab of prime ribeye, executed to perfection (a warm, red center with char on the outside) sitting on top of a dark red pond of spicy, homemade steak sauce. The grits were creamy and smooth, and the fried onions were the perfect accessory to the meat.

My bf tried carpaccio for the first time, and loved it. I decided against dessert, but would have loved to try a smidgeon of the cheese course.

Did I forget to tell you everything was absolutely delicious? The vegetarians were quite happy with their choices and the allergy-prone friend had an excellent meal centered around a perfect filet.

The manager helped us select two very nice grenaches, one of which had gorgeous tannins and creme caramel, and the other with the whiff of barnyard and graphite.

First course - Salmon Tartare - this was excellent, I've had a lot of tartares and so often they seem either under or over seasoned, but this one stood out.... it was seasoned perfectly, the saffron sauce enhanced the dish, and the texture was just right.  

Second Course - Parmesan Souffle - I love everything about the ingredients.. parm, mushrooms, garlic... but the overall result was a bit of a letdown.. the flavor of parmesan did not come through for me as much as the garlic cream sauce did. It also made the souffle a soggy mess to chew. I don't know if this dish was intended to be this way, but I wouldn't order it again. 

Third Course - Texas Striped Bass - served with adouille, shrimp, hush puppies, potatoes, meniere sauce... almost too much going on in this plate for me. However that's a very minor complaint.  The bass itself was awesome.. skin was crisped perfectly , fish cooked well throughout, and the sauce full of flavor.  The portion of fish was very generous too.

Service and presentation were excellent.  Also got to love the beer pairings offered with each course, I don't drink much wine and wish more foodie centric restaurants would offer this option.

If you're a light eater I'd recommend not choosing two apps like I did and substitute one for a dessert or soup.. I've got a good appetite but I felt like I had more food than I could handle..

I can't believe all of this time I have overlooked this gem of a restaurant because of the location. It is in a strip mall shared by Marie Callendars after all. Upon the advice of friends and the reluctance to want to fight traffic and parking on the strip, I visited this fine establishment for my anniversary. We arrived early for our reservations and sat at the bar to get a drink. The dirty martini I ordered was spot on perfection! It wasn't too salty or too watered down, just strong and perfect. The bartender was so warm and friendly, asking us if it were our first time dining there. We told her yes and she started rattling off suggestions for our dinner. We ordered another drink each (since it was happy hour in the bar) and followed the hostess to our table. The service was impeccable! From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, the staff made us feel that they were only there to serve us, despite the busy dining room. The chefs, knowing it was our anniversary sent out various complimentary tastings. We were served a small portion of grits (yay! i love me some grits) with wild mushrooms and shaved cheese. It was mouth watering deliciousness. Next we got a vegetable bread pudding bite with a bell pepper jelly that was equally exceptional. The appetizers we ordered came out and the suggestion from the bartender held true- the BBQ shrimp were beyond comparison. The shrimp were grilled to the point of perfect doneness, the outside was crispy and the inside still moist and mild. The BBQ sauce itself was the star of the dish, it was tangy and sweet and spicy all at the same time- perfectly balanced flavor. Although the hubby wouldn't dare try the cole slaw, I was more than eager to relieve him of it. It was maytag blue cheese after all! It was so creamy and tart, a perfect complement to the tangy BBQ sauce and shrimp. I ordered the raw trio appetizer (sorry can't remember the name), beef tar-tar, ahi tuna and smoked salmon. The beef literally melted in my mouth with a blend of spices that harmonized with the rich raw meat. The smoked salmon had capers which I appreciated and the tuna was satisfying as well. For entrees we ordered 2 red meat options since we wanted to share and the hubby won't eat most fish or lamb. I ordered the Grilled Flank Steak w/Roasted Garlic Creamers, Crystal Fried Onion Crust, & Rosemary's Steak Sauce. At first I was disappointed that the rib eye wasn't on the menu that night because I am a BIG fan of rib eyes, however the flank steak swept any disappointment away after the first bite. The texture of the steak was soft and tender, the taste was heavenly. The sauce on this dish was again a star! The hubby got the Grilled Veal Porterhouse w/Swiss Chard, Caramelized Red Onions & Bourbon Green Peppercorn Sauce. The sauce on his was tasty too, but he much preferred the sauce from the flank steak. I liked the bitter swiss chard element on his plate, it provided a nice contrast to the buttery velvet veal. After our entrees the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert plate with 6 little bites of sweets. There was a lemon bar, a brownie and a buckeye. I cursed myself for giving up desserts for lent! My hubby got to enjoy them all by himself. Once he tried one of each he sat back and declared the buckeye was the best dessert he had ever eaten. He doesn't even like peanut butter, but was proclaiming his love for the little treat. He told me to try it, even though I had managed to make it almost to Easter without breaking my lent vows. I fought back the temptation and told him to go ahead and finish it, which he quickly obliged. The whole night he couldn't stop talking about that buckeye. After all was said and done, our bill came to about $130 with tip and we left on Cloud 9. I am in love with this restaurant and can't wait to go back and try all of there creations!",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,2,1,5,Uf4dD680jmDQtbKd5BLrdA

When the server placed it in front of me it looked like the chef had opened a can of dog food and plopped it on a plate. It tasted great but was a little strained to eat thinking about the canned dog food. Monday's are great they offer all their wines at 1/2 price. If you go in any other day and want to order wine be prepared to pay $40.00 and above for a bottle of wine. If you bring in your own they have a $25.00 corkage fee.

5437001,2009-06-19,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Went to Rosemary's last night and here are my quick impressions... I had the prix fixe for $55 and thought my meal was excellent. Started with the foie gras and it was cooked perfectly! The only thing I didn't like about it was the marmalade tended to take too much away from the foie gras, rather than complementing the flavor it almost took over too much. Then on to the beef & maytag bleu cheese carpaccio which was outstanding! For the main course I had the creole grilled prime ribeye which was not only cooked perfectly but was excellent in flavor & texture.
My wife had the seared scallops and thought they were amazing as well. I tried one and they were cooked perfectly and I don't think they could've been made better.
The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was I felt that the service was a little lacking and by that I don't mean bad. I feel that our waiter could've been a little more attentive so hopefully next time we go that will change.
We will definitely be going back and I would definitely recommend this to my friends & family. The cost for one prix fixe, seared scallops and 4 drinks was roughly $120 if that helps anybody.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,1,0,4,PBAq0KjEW0DbjTUdgcwGsw
5498544,2010-04-07,8,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Oddly enough I wasn't looking to do any gambling on this trip to Vegas. Sadly though, the only gambling that did happen was rolling the dice on what I expected to be a sure bet (this place based off reviews/praise) and we ended up losing. 

I'm not even sure how to describe the nightmare of this dinner. You ever get waiter envy? You know, like you're eating at a restaurant and you happen to notice the people next to you get a waiter serving them that is so much better than the one you got? Oh man. I was so coveting my neighbors waiter! 

If I were to say the service was flat out horrible, that would imply that there was any level of service. There was none. This had to be the waiter experience ever. 

Made reservations for 8, got seated by 8:05, Waiter 2 came and took water request. Waiter 1 came by to give us menus by 8:15... disappeared for a good 20 minutes without explaining the food menu at all even though we told him that it was our first time. 

Also note.. two waiters? Hmmm. Okay, one was for clean up and the other was the ""main waiter"" 

Waiter 2 brings us silver wear around 8:20. 8:25 passes.. oddly enough, no water still. 8:30 I finally flag him down and ask ""where's the water?"" He's surprised and you can tell he forgot. He goes back and gets water quickly. Well, at least he came back. Waiter 1 still has not shown back up from giving us our menus at 8:15 and it's now 8:40

I could not hear waiter when he first explained menu from my side of the table, so I get my order placed in wrongly for the three course pre-fixed menu. He ask what do we want to drink.. We never got a drink menu.. Ugh, 

By 8:50 we finally have our order placed. Sitting there 50 minutes and our food was barely ordered because of disappearing waiter. Was he performing at the Rio with Penn & Teller?!? 

He comes back with drink menu, we place order.. he comes back and tells us one drink is out.. he offers no suggestions as to what would be like it. 

First course comes out around 9:15 - it's pretty decent. Texas shrimp were tasty. Not too bad. NOT WORTH THE DAMN HOUR AND 15 MINUTE WAIT IT'S BEEN SO FAR! 

We sit there for a good 30 minutes and no one's checked on us, no one's done anything. The people to my right have the same waiter and they mention how bad the service is and how the person sitting on my side of the table couldn't hear the waiter either when he explained the menu. 

At this point I'm pretty damn peeved. Where's this great service? An hour and forty five minutes later I get a manager and tell them, what the hell. The lack of service was killing me. The entree finally comes out after which I've been complaining. You can tell the wait staff got a mouth full from her as there's tension there. 

Steak was cooked rare when ordered med, my bass was tasty, but it was made bitter from this extra long wait. At this point we just had a bad taste in our mouths and, well.. the whole night had been ruined. 

When traveling we generally do one ""fancy meal"" and this was expected to be that fancy meal. It turned out to a disaster and we just wanted out of there. 

What made it worse was that through the whole wait period we couldn't help but notice the table to my left who had a different waiter who was getting amazing service. She was on top of her game. She went down the menu and explained it perfectly. I mean, I couldn't even hear our waiter from the other side of the table and yet this other waiter was talking loud and clear enough that I could hear her two tables down. 

She also had a situation where the wine that was ordered was out and she went down a list of other recommendations as to what to replace it with in terms of same likeness. I mean, this waiter was something else. It made our situation with our waiter feel so much worse. Like; ""You mean to tell me that if we only sat two tables down this whole night would have been so much better?"" 

Now I know how it feels to piss your quarters away at a slot machine and then have the person one machine over win the jack pot. 

But this nightmare wasn't over yet. We were done. We didn't want to eat anymore. The appitite was so an hour and thirty minutes ago. So we asked them to box it up... Which leads to an even more awkward situation.. um.. how do I trust someone who just got a verbal ass kicking because of me? 

I don't think I ever trusted any left overs less than I did that box that came out...

Then they asked if we wanted dessert forgetting that it came with one of the pre-fixed meals... thanks. 

The manager that night apologized and gave me her card. Why? I have no idea. She deducted about 60% off the bill.. But even then, $40 for what amounted to appetizers and the worse service I have ever received? Yeah, no thanks. I have 700 reviews and only 50 1 stars... that should tell you something about how I felt completely fucked coming here.

The place is off the strip. We walked in, and they greeted us and told us that if we wanted to dine inside the other room, we would have to wait about 45 minutes. We were both starving, so we didn't want to wait so they seated us at this table in the corner of the outside room. We later understand why they did that. Apparently this is a ""fine-dining"" meaning, everyone supposed to dress all semi-formal-ish. Yelp didn't tell us that, so we showed up in shorts and flip-flops. OOPS. But it's okay, we had the table with the comfy chairs :)

Our waitress is super nice and was willing to assist us with our menu due to the fact that this was our first time. She recommended us to the prix-fixe meal. The prix-fixe meal is $55 3-course meal of your choice. When most entrees on the menu are over  $30, by going with the prix-fixe, you're getting more food for a much better price.

Now, lets talk about their service. I've never been to a place with such excellent service as Rosemary's. Everyone is so polite and attentive to your needs. I'd have to give a 5 stars for their service!",c5rdNgcc_x9HxgiYjFUo5g,10,10,5,x4Wlwxik2fFLZiMlBxQVFQ

What I loved!
1) Atmosphere was very romantic, clean, relaxing with a great view of the kitchen. I loved to watch the chef preparing all the wonderful dishes
2)The service was TOP NOTCH. Our server was fantastic and always attentive to our table and needs
3) The food was incredible! I had the pre fix dinner starting with the special of veal ravaoli, crispy sea bass and coconut bread pudding. Everything was perfect! The food tasted awesome!
4)They bring you a little plate of 3 tiny desserts complimentary so if you are not a huge dessert fan you can get two appitizers and your meal if you like. 
5) Fine dining at $55 per person pre fix (2 sides and an entree - either 2 appitizers or 1 appitizer and 1 desert) Perfect well rounded meal!

What made me sad
1) We mentioned to our server that we had recieved gift certificates for Christmas and when we went to use them they would only accept one. ($50 each) He said if we had had seperate tables they would have accepted both. No where on our certificates did it say that you could only use one per table. It said one per visit and this was our first time visiting (2 seperate couples). We were very frusterated since we had notified them of these prior to starting our dinner. It is not cheap to eat here and our bill was almost $300!  The manager did not even come to the table to explain which was somewhat odd. It did leave a bad taste in all our mouths since everything up to that point had been perfect! We did not understand how if we had got them as gifts and dined together it could not be used. They need to change their verbage to one per table per visit if they is what they mean. Also, make sure that if you notify the waiter they look at what you have first to eliminate the suprise at the end of your meal.

Other than that though, this place was a wonderful place to dine. The chef prepared some of the tastiest food I have had in a long time. I am sure I will be back, after I get over being so bitter :)",-gQm-IoK2_BMEMx9OgtQnw,4,2,4,TbQXssB7GdApoG-_AR4uXA

Service is phenomenal and the restaurant itself is very comfortable. Not too fancy shmancy and all stuffy with a bunch of snobs like you may encounter at the high end restaurants on the Strip. Rosemary's is in West Las Vegas, about 25 min and $30 cab ride off the  Strip, but worth it!

My friend and I had the pre fixe option which was any three items on the menu for $55pp. We added half a bottle of wine and the total came out to be around $165 for two.

My three choices were the veal sweetbreads, crawfish risotto and rack of lamb. 

I've never had sweetbreads before, so I figured why not try it out! I was surprised at how delicate and perfectly breaded the sweetbreads were. They were accompanied with a bed of french lentils and the pairing was perfect! The crawfish was accompanied with a wonderfully savory ham and this combo was also delightful. Melt in your mouth delight with a little kick to wake you up! The rack of lamb was cooked just as I asked and just the right amount of racks (3) to make a meal complete.

Forgot to add the amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a great start! Also, even though we didn't order a dessert, we did receive a mini  trio of desserts. All of which I can only remember the peanut butter chocolate truffle like candy. yummm

Corkage: $15
Cost: $140 - Seven Course Tasting Menu (inclusive of tax, tip & corkage)
Phone: 702.869.2251

I've not heard of this restaurant before, not until I flipped through the WS Restaurant Guide and spotted this Award of Excellence recipient. Decided to check out the website, happy to see that they regularly offers a three course prix-fixe and also 1/2 price wine on Sunday evenings, both good signs to the restaurant's food quality and wine friendliness.

After contacting Jennifer Hollifield, their Sales & Catering Director, a seven course tasting menu was setup for 13 happy winos. The menu itself was $95 and we were able to come to an all inclusive price of just under $140 per person, can't ask for any better in Vegas. 

The restaurant setup a separate table for all our wines, Nick Hetzel, Sommelier/Restaurant Manager took great care on all aspects of the service for the entire evening, especially considering our party size and the amount of stems and decanters we went through.
All 13 plates for each course always arrived at the same time for all guests.
We were brought fresh stems matched to varietal for every single wine we brought in, which I found out from Nick we went through 252 stems to be exact. Decanting were promptly suggested if necessary without any of us asking.

The only surprise of the evening was the amount of food per course, lesson learned here but this in no way shape or form a negative thing. 
Figuring all tasting menu are build the same, at least portion wise, I asked for a seven course menu. When the price came back to be $95 for the menu, I didn't even think about it twice that the portion size would be out of ordinary, boy, am I dead wrong on this.
I think by the time we finished the amuse and the first two course, I started to get yelled and questioned at, ""how hungry were you when you planned this menu?""  
The amount of food on each plate was at least two times as much as I expected for a seven course menu, the rack of lamb at the end was about three times as much. The really amazing thing here was Anwar was able to finish two servings of the rack of lamb after cleaning every single plate that was put in front of him for the night.  

We finally cleared out of the place close to 1:00am, a huge thank you to the staff of the restaurant with Nick and Jennifer in particular to make this wonderful evening possible and went off without a hitch.
Rosemary's will be my go to restaurant for any future wine dinners in Vegas, just have to remember to down size the menu so we won't require stretchers to get us out of the restaurant.  

For those of you that's not been to Rosemary's before, please do so on your next visit to Vegas. It's a bit out of the way, but definitely worth the taxi ride or drive to seek the restaurant out. On top of that, the time you spend at this restaurant will definitely save you money on the blackjack table.

But, the food is the main event and what a delicious show it is. And a rarefied bargain at $55 for the prix fixe dinner. And for that added 'oomf!'...trust them on their wine selections. 

I categorize the food as continental with a french emphasis--definitely fine dining. Rosemary's can't be considered an insider's culinary find anymore it is just too good not be discovered. Thank you Chef Michael and Wendy Jordan!",0kuiIA6PCYx24C6ZvzJhZg,1,1,5,vjv34GJaSwrmM9Bw0urTow

My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.  We both got the prix fixe courses, this is a list of both our food choices:

Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp-Absolutely delicious!  Must try if you love blue cheese and bbq sauce
Marinated Jumbo Asparagus-Good, like a fancy breakfast salad
Duo of Tartars-Very good!  I didn't try the beef but the salmon was amazing
Moroccan Spiced Sea Scallops-Perfectly cooked and seasoned
Nightly Special Beef Filet-Amazing! 
Chocolate Cream Pie-So good I will go back to Vegas just for this dessert

In addition to the fantastic meal we ordered, the staff brought us a few small dishes to taste, the first was a savory bread pudding that was excellent, and the second was a trio of desserts: lemon bars, mini peanut butter cookie bites and chocolate coconut bars which were all delicious (my favorite were the chocolate coconut bars).  Also, the portions were very generous which is not always the case with fine dining.  Our server, Thomas was super helpful and knowledgeable.  The bf and I are self proclaimed foodies and love to eat and we both agreed that Rosemary's was simply stellar.  We will definitely be going back!

Rosemary's is in a strip mall a couple miles west of LV Blvd.  Its nondescript location belies the gastronomic experience that awaits those willing to endure the 10-minute (*gasp!*) cab ride from their hotel.  The place is a little slice of heaven a la American cuisine.

Food, service, ambiance; all top drawer quality.  And, if you like to cook as much as you like to eat (like me) then you will be well-served to purchase the Rosemary's cookbook.",rPyq8rS0CN9ABMIRHO-GVQ,0,0,4,_nzhmCO50IZke2rfPXjQGQ

We both got the prix fixe option of getting one entree and two items (We both chose an appetizer and dessert each.). I really enjoyed the food. I got scallops for my entree, and the sauce was superb. The dessert was good too. I got an apple tart, which is ordinary, but the flavors were still good. For my appetizer, I got something with goat cheese and fig, but don't remember exactly anymore. It was good. My husband got the cheese puff appetizer and lamb entree. He thought both were good, but seemed to enjoy my appetizer more and had better lamb elsewhere, but still thought this was good quality. I only give it 4 stars instead of 5, because for the price range, it's not quite on par with some Strip restaurants, but is a great place to go off the Strip. I'd recommend it.

Compared to other neighborhood restaurants in Vegas, Rosemary's is certainly near the top.  However there are much better restaurants on the strip in the same price range as long as you're willing to deal with traffic and parking to visit them.  Bouchon I'm thinking of you.

I highly recommend trying their beer pairings with whatever dish you have.  The wine list is your standard fair but the beer list extensive and one of the best I've seen in a while.

Keep an eye out for specials.  Some of their deals (25% off and up) can make Rosemary's a real bargain.",bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,0,0,4,5OiUxINoKL2tbpLKmyGSeg

5875515,2010-02-20,0,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"I can't believe I didn't write a review before! My sister and I L.O.V.E this restaurant. Every time we're in town (we live in LA) this is a must for us ... we used to come at least once for lunch and once for dinner - however they stopped serving lunch except for Fridays :( It's a bit off the strip but so well worth it ... everyone MUST eat here!!! I swear, I died and went to heaven!! Don't let the strip mall fool ya, this is by far my FAVE restaurant EVER!! 

We always do either the pre fix menu or the tasting ($55 per person). Love that Wednesdays is ""ladies night"" and ladies get 1/2 off! Oh, and if you sit at the bar, they have a different tapas menu which is aaaaaaamazing!! The food is superb, the staff is top notch (we love that one of the waiters always remembers us! haha makes us feel like we're at home!). 

If you've read my reviews, you know I eat ... a lot!! hahah So my sis and I both did the prefix .. we split our 1st dish - she ordered the beef carpaccio (to die for ... we've been to France and this is served slightly different with blue cheese, apples and candied walnuts) and I ordered the twice baked souffle (our first time ordering this and it was delish! wild mushrooms with a beautiful parmesan souffle - so light and fluffy). She ordered the special appetizer beef tartar (we split it as our 2nd course) ... ohhhhhh myyyyyyy goshhhhhh, I know some people get creeped out with raw beef, but if you enjoy it and it's on the menu for the night - you have to try it ... you won't be disappointed ... i think it became my fave appetizer from here!! For our entree, she had the lamb (cooked perfectly, so tasty and love the sauce) - I had the special salmon that had a bit of a citrus-y glaze to it, over a bed of apple slaw. I ordered the special dessert - blackberry cobbler that we split, unfortunately this was the least favorite thing I've had here ... I like my cobblers to have a thick crumbly biscuit/topping and this just had little chunks of dough mixed in and the blackberries were a bit overpowering for this dish since the seeds get quite chewy. So, since we didn't want to end a fabulous meal with an average dessert, we ordered another one to split! :) Our fave dessert is the ice box cooler but they didn't have it that night so we had the trio of sorbets - they have the best sorbets and ice creams!! 

I have never been disappointed with this place and highly recommend it!! This makes me want to change any other place I've rated a 5 to a 4! It's as good as it gets, fine dining, great ambiance and a very reasonable price. If I lived in Vegas, I'd go every Wednesday for ladies night 1/2 off!!",lu0td3A2uIT6gbl2dAkljg,0,1,5,_0IpABaclcWl583s7N_vMg

Located 20 mins from the Strip, the taste is as good as it gets in LV hotel's fine restaurants and the price is very agreeable. My boyfriend and I had the $55 pre-fixed menu, which includes appetizer, entree and a dessert. (If you don't want a dessert you can substitute it by choosing ANOTHER appetizer. What a deal.) I did a research on Yelp and picked BBQ Shrimps, Salmon Tartar, and sea scallops as the appetizers, and Roasted Lamb and Flank Steak on duck (as a nightly special) as entree and we had trio of sorbet as our dessert. Service was phenomenal, and the timing of each dish was just right. The servers are really ""providing quality service"" to customer.

5918932,2011-03-18,2,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,"Because of Groupon, I made several visits to dine at Rosemary's.  Service here is top notch here (in the dining area, not so much in the lounge/bar area).  And making a reservation ahead of time is definitely recommended, the restaurant is busy even during weekdays (I can only guess how much more busy they must be on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays).

The amuse bouche that were served during my visits were mostly good to excellent.  Too bad they don't offer an appetizer portion for these, because I think they as a whole were better than the apps on the menu.

Like Misti has mentioned in her review, the food here is a little hit or miss.  I tried the 5-couse Chef's Tasting menu on my first visit.  The Fourst Course: Roasted Rackof Lamb was great. The First Course: Duo of Tartars (Filet of Beef was good, the Salmon Tartar was way too salty) was okay. The Second Course: PanFried VealSweetbreads w/ Foie Gras Butternut Squash Quinoa (sweetbread was probably way too over-fried, but the quinoa and the Bloody Mary Butter Sauce was really good). Third Course: Yellow Fin Tuna on Andouille, was okay. Fifth Course: Dessert Trio was uninspiring.

I have also tried other items from the regualr and daily menu. Likely it was good or so-so.  Below are a brief review of what I have tried:

Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes w/ G-ma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers & Emulsified Ravigote Sauce $15 - Pretty good. 

Baked Crab Stuffed Shrimp w/ Apricot Hollandaise & Herb tossed Pea Shoots $14.50 - Kind of hard to eat (messy), but the shrimp and crab were good. Didn't like apricot in this dish.

Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp w/ Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw. $14 - Overall, alittlesalty for me.  Good Maytag Blue Cheese flavor on the slaw, shrimp was cooked cook (probably be better if it was seared on the grill quickly and not cooked all the way through), not a fan of the ""sauce"".

Twice Baked Parmesan Soufflé w/ Wild Mushrooms in a Roasted Garlic Cream Sauce. $14 - Good Soufflé, love the wildmushroom in roasted garlic cream sauce.  If you like soufflé then I highly recommend this hot app.

Seared Sea Scallops w/ Parsnip Potato Puree, Crispy Prosciutto, Parsnip Strips & Apple Cider Beurre Blanc $36  - One of my scallops was starting to have that off-flavor, but it was cooked perfectly. The parsnip strips was a great garnish.

Duck ""Corned Beef"" & Mustard Braised White Cabbage w/ Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce. $37  Overall, it was good, but the sauce was too salty for me.

From what I have heard, Rosemary's was a really excellent restaurant when it first started, but it has lost some of the shine since then.  Too bad I wasn't here to try it back then, but it is still a nice little neighorhood restaurant to enjoy a good meal and good service.

The reason I am only giving it 3 stars on Yelp (A-Ok) is that for this kind of restaurant it is just okay compared to others in its class.  Service is what you expect from similar quality fine dining restaurants.  Price is average compared to its peers.  Taste - have items I truly enjoyed and others that I will not order again.  Probably the best deal here is Lady's night and happy hour pricing on drinks.

Decor:  4/5 Dimly lit for that intimate and romantic atmosphere.  Seats are comfortable.
Food:  3/5 Hits and misses, sauces are on the salty side for my taste.
Location:  3/5 Perfect for locals living on the SW side of LV.  Cab fares will add up for those staying on the Strip.
Price: 3/5  AVerage compared to similar quality restaurants.
Service: 3/5  Knowledgable staff providing good service.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,zZPEnhsrOINUzh1NS17cRQ

As soon as you walk through the doors, you are greeted by friendly young girls and an impressive bar. After waiting about 10 minutes (after our reservation time) to be seated, I was again surprised to see the white tablecloths and formally attired waiters. We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks, but waited too long for our menus (about 10 min) We  took advantage of the ""prixe fix"", where you order 3 courses of your choice for $55. Wednesday is Ladies Night, so I got my meal for half off! Great deal!  I ordered the BBQ shrimp (yummy, and perfectly cooked) and the beef carpaccio as my appetizer and salad. I didn't know what carpaccio was, but the waiter explained it so elegantly that I ordered it. It's basically, really thin sliced raw beef with chunks of bleu cheese sprinkled on them. Eh, I'm not that gourmet, so I didn't really like it, but maybe someone who has a more refined palette would. My husband ordered the crab boulettes, which, in English, are crab cakes shaped into balls. They were okay...more breading than crab. We did get a ""gift"" from the chef which was a ceviche type salad on a piece of wonton. We liked it, maybe more so because we were so hungry? 

My entree was Alaskan Halibut...yummm! Perfectly cooked and a generous portion. My husband ordered the rib eye. Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned. This came with grits (no flavor and kind of mushy)...potatoes would have been better. 

I didn't order a dessert since my entree made 3 choices. My husband ordered the coconut bread pudding. I do not like coconut, but I really liked this dessert! Deeelicious! We also got another ""gift"" from the chef which was a sampler of a cookie, a brownie and a lemon bar. They all had fancier names, but that's how I labeled them. They were all delicious! And not just cuz they were free! 

Overall, Rosemary's was a unique and pleasant experience. You need to have a LOT of time to dine there. Our reservations were for 8:30 and we did not leave there until 10:30. And that was not due to drinking and conversing, either. I'm all for enjoying my dining experience without feeling rushed, but this was a bit too slow for me.  That is why they get the 4 instead of a full 5 stars. 

I would go again on Ladies Night or with a coupon because otherwise, it's a bit expensive.",XdtIZ5tUDY6IICs4Df6nlw,0,0,4,tN7OZgOxROrtGvPIeVX9-Q
