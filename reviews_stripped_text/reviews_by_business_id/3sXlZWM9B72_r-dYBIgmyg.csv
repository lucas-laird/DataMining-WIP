When I did, and I took off the top bun I found that someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I mean seriously I always tolerate the crappy service, and the stupid and careless Mexican lady that always takes my orders wrong ( I'm also a Mexican I promise I'm not racist or prejudice) in the mornings at the drive-thru, but c'mon seriously someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I took it back to the register, and informed the cashier of my surprise, and he was kind enough to replace it for another Big Mac. I brought it back to my table, and I took it out of it's box, and guess what? It looked like shit! Seriously this thing looked so bad I wouldn't be surprised if it fucking winked at me! It looked as if an elephant had sat on it after it had finished taking a slim dump between two hamburger buns. Okay, now I know McDonalds isn't a five star restaurant, and I definitely know it isn't even a quality restaurant, but can't the customer at least expect some service quality? I mean seriously I couldn't even expect to receive a semi-attractive decent tasting burger or a Big Mac with its Patty as a whole. Ugh.. what can you do right?

The other evening, I picked up a shamrock shake, coke, vanilla cappucino, caramel frappe and a 20 piece nuggets. (It wasn't all for me!) Being allergic to chocolate, I can never get mint without the chocolate in ice cream until St. Patrick's day rolls around, then there it sits in the middle of the order screen, beaming at me like an old friend. 

It was lovely. I wish I could have ordered a bucket. I just wanted to be inappropriate with it. Yes. It was THAT good. Granted, if I could eat mint chip ice cream I probably wouldn't be so ridiculous, but I can't, so I am. 

The nuggets were crispy and sufficiently naughty. I had mine with hot mustard. But that shake... That shake makes me want to go back tonight for more. So good. I love you McDonald's. I really do.",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,10,12,4,WGAb5A-82l35sTtgEvkt2A

I begrudgingly took my place in the drive- thru line. I had assured both my fiancé & my mother that they'd NVR have shakes & cookies around this time (1am) being it was pretty late (or early depending ) but I asked anyway & was shocked when he said YES!!! Wow, ok that's unusual! the line surprisingly moved along fairly quickly & next thing I knew, the man in the window was repeating my order back to me... 
Yes I said he repeated my order back to me! ...& guess what  it was 100% perfect Not 1 flaw ~ not a one... I've NVR had such a great experience at ANY McDonalds in my entire life! & considering I lived next door to this location & had several issues wth them over the years, this is sincerely a breath of fresh air!

4701531,2014-02-27,2,3sXlZWM9B72_r-dYBIgmyg,"My mom needed to meet a client to pick up documents and I was her chauffeur for the day. The lobby is really nice, as is all their locations in the Southwest that I've been to, due to recent renovations. Very modern, classy, and extremely clean. This location featured an opaque black and white rendition of the Las Vegas Strip on the glass separating the restaurant from Terrible's convenience store. The new digital menus are really nice as well and easy to read. 

I don't really eat at McDonald's, so I can't say much about the food. What I do usually order and enjoy was their Vanilla Cone. Delicious non-fat vanilla soft serve in a light and crispy cone. The best part of this location is the fact that it is one of the very few corporate stores in the valley and offers the Vanilla Cone at just $0.49 ($0.53 after sales tax)!! What an awesome deal! Especially when franchised locations charge $1 and up.

So, based on the nice, welcoming lobby and consistently delicious Cone, I have no complaints.

I ordered about 8 burgers, some fries, and some nuggets. When I got home, I realized I was missing 2 burgers. When I called in to let them know about the missing burgers, the person on the phone blatantly told me, ""well, why didn't you check your bag before you left?"" I didn't appreciate her attitude nor her tone at all and it was very evident in my response, ""well, why did you charge me for something if you weren't going to give it to me?!"" It wasn't a huge problem at all, it was only $2, but the way the situation was handled was completely uncalled for. 

Btw, they have this absurd promise where you'll be in and out of the drive-thru in under 60 seconds [they even give you a timer at the first window after they take your payment], and this is probably why! You don't get everything you ordered and charged for, and when you call in, they make it sound like it's your fault.

Not sure if the kids there are back in school or not, but there seems to be a few just hanging out or waiting for their orders.

I don't think it is one of their fancier locations, but I saw way too many McDonald's commercials this morning while at work. Damn those $1.49 Iced Coffee commercials that kept popping up on Fox.  

And I was almost able to get all the way back home, just 0.7 more miles or so, and I failed.  Washed out of SD-6*, the covert branch of the CIA, because I couldn't stay focus and on mission like Sydney, even after she got a few molars yanked out of her jaw, and still managed to complete her mission in Taiwan (where the fake Chinese there all somehow were very fluent in Cantonese).  I guess ABC failed even harder then me, and they have a much bigger budget too.

Anyway. Anyway. Anyway. Anyway, I thought I get some Garlic Fries too, but the dude taking my order kindly told me, without shouting ""are you nuts bro?"", that they just have regular French Fries.  It is not that I don't believe the man, but all the chatter about trying Garlic Fries at the ball park, at fancy restaurants and even at McDonald's got me craving some decent Garlic Fries. So is it just being tested at selected test markets, like the San Francisco Bay Area, and not at the boring suburb of Las Vegas??? I have a very odd feeling that I have been punked!!! Not even sure if I was even the intended target, as the false rumor was disseminated over group text.

 Well, at least the French Vanilla Iced Tea was decent. A little too much ice, and tasted on the weak side, but for $2.48 for their large, it was not a horrendous fiscal disaster.

* Watched Season 1 episode 1 of Alias for the very first time, in case you are not up to date about this reference. I know it is not like GOT or Walking Dead or anything, or is it?

Well thanks for making the Iced Coffee cold for me to enjoy. 3 stars.  Mainly because the mailman that placed his order is probably going to blame you for him being confused about the 20 piece McNuggets not being a combo, and he messed up his order. He can blame it on the heat, or pneumonia or spin it whichever way he pleases, because the American people just don't care. We only want all our USPS employees to not hoard our mails and steal our drugs sent through the US Postal Service.

3 stars. Next time less ice. And have Garlic Fries!!!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,6,3,h8SqLtzB5QgRNDvbPkzHHw

I have never been inside, only ordered at the drive-thru. The employees are pretty friendly, they have fast service, and no problems with my orders so far.  I love the $1 large sweet teas!!

I moved to the area a few weeks ago and have driven by here before, but could not remember if I saw a sign saying that they had a 24 hour drive-thru. So the first time I came here, I asked the cashier at the first window:

Me: Is your drive-thru 24 hours?
Employee: Ummm...... I think so? But I'm not sure. Do you want me to ask? 
Me: That's okay, I'll ask at the next window.

LOL he works there and didn't know what their drive-thru hours were?!?! Come on!! Well, as I drove up to the second window to get my food, I saw the 24 hour sign. 

But still, as an employee, you should at least know what the restaurant's hours are right??",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,0,4,80fI46_H94JRq5Gb9rGoxA
