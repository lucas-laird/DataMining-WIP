Got my order to go and after the very short drive home when I unwrapped my food it was a nasty mess inside the bag.

Customer service was lacking especially when it was obvious it was our first time. Few of the female workers just had blank stares waiting for us to decide what to order. The impatient vibe was definitely not welcoming at all. The only male worker was pretty friendly & suggested certain things for our meals. 

I was ecstatic to see Al Pastor since it's not very common so I ordered a bowl of that. Scoops of rice & meat were so little that my bowl was more of a salad full of lettuce drenched in salsa, cheese and sour cream. Al Pastor was also advertised as spicy & there was no spice at all. If anything, it was simply too salty. 

I ate half of my bowl & thank goodness I ordered chips cause I just ate that with little scoops of my soupy, drenched, salty ""supposed to be bowl but became a salad"" meal.

I know that's somewhat typical to find in meat dishes but that's not the reasoning for the 3-star review. Chips were either stale or were too oily I couldn't tell the difference.

2276921,2017-05-21,5,5pxRAyPz1PrW2amW7yYaxA,"I kind of had high hopes for Chronic Tacos. I heard about the original one in San Diego area from friend. He was telling me need to give it try. It been while since had tacos so figure Chronic Tacos it is.

The first impression is digging the vibe and the look of the restaurant. The artwork on the walls especially on one side with girl face painted like Day of the Dead. Pretty cool. The way the bar set up (really tiny bar and truth not bar bar but they do have HH specials, frozen margarita machines) different but in good way. They have lot of wide screens one above the bar area and few others spread out around the restaurant. The dining area more fast food looking cause you go up order and then pick spot eat if dining in. 

The food was nothing memorable. I ordered three tacos (one al pastor, two carne asada). You have option of want corn or flour tortillas. I went with the corn cause true street taco no such thing as flour. Both the al pastor and carne asada it was ok. I have had way better at other taco shops around Vegas. Not huge fan seeing all the proteins sitting in containers all cooked or the tortillas instead of traditional on flat top they use press get it warmed up. To be fair both al pastor and carne asada not dried out but also lacked any kind of flavor. Carne asada more use finer diced chopped meat but here get nice size cubes. Both proteins you do get nice size portion. I also ordered Chronic Fries. It sounded good. The gentlemen took my order said it is one of the more popular menu items. Chronic Fries is basically nachos except instead of chips you have fresh fries right out of the fryer. You basically load it with whatever you want for the most part. I went with chicken, black beans, cheese, mild salsa, and it killing me forget this orange looking sauce that kicked it up another level. Nacho cheese fries or chili cheese fries. They got NOTHING on Chronic Fries. Not only do the fries hold up cause thinking so much toppings they would get soggy quick. The combinations of flavors with every bite is addicting. I wish I knew cause would have passed on the tacos. 

The staff was awesome. The gentlemen took my order recommended the Chronic Fries and happy he did!!!! Friendly, nice, and attentive.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,10,9,3,3E9fj_AKKISjJFtAOB209w

I had a El pastor. It was good. It was 3.99 + tax. It wasnt spicy as described. I added green salsa to it and that got it there. 
Had a Fish taco baja style. It cost 3.99 + .50+ tax $4.86
Nothing special the baja sauce is spicy which I like but it sure didnt feel like I got 4 bucks on that taco.
I askedthe person doing the service about what makes their tacos worth the price. She said it was all natural ingredents. So I had to ask "" are these sustainable protiens and organic toppings""  She did not have an honest answer so she asked the cook. He didnt now what ""sustainable "" meant. Im not trying to be a biotch but I want to know why the cost is so high here. 
Probably wont be back. Foods ok, but I can get a pretty good fish taco at Del taco for 2 bucks, as a matter of fact I could get 4 for what I spent on two very ordinary tacos. And at least I go in knowing its not organic or sustainable.  Lol  They got 2 out of 3 stars due to the young lady who was honest and courteous.

It was my 4th attempt to go there because the past few times I either showed up or called they were closed (even though it was still open time). Their reason was that it was too slow so they closed up early. 

Anyway, finally went and ordered 3 tacos  (they have 3 tacos for $8.49 otherwise they're  $4 each), a burrito (also $8.49 but it's a dollar off on Mondays), and made it a combo which added Tortilla chips and a drink for an additional $3 or so. 

First off, the tortillas were kinda cold, mushy, and flabby even after they had just warmed them. Got two carne asada and one pollo taco. The chicken and meat in the taco were also cold (who knows how long they'd been sitting) and practically had no flavor at all. The burrito was absolutely flavorless.. I couldn't make sense of it -- it had white rice, black beans, carne asada, lettuce, pico de gallo, and cheese in it. It was so disappointing and bland. The rice was mushy and we had to add lime to the burrito to taste a bit of anything. The chips were extremely boring and cheap, and guac... do I even need to say it was flavorless?  Practically, everything was. As slow as it was (no customers were coming in or ordering) the employees still left the already cold meat and chicken sitting out uncovered.

Unfortunately, the entire meal was a disappointment. I will never go back and I consider it a waste of $20. I wouldn't be surprised if they closed down.",cG64QKCJbTSil-KOSksZ7w,11,0,1,b1PkUfc6P7gJp408k0b-hg

This is their version of loaded fries or more familiarly, ""Carne Asada Fries"" (though for this dish, only Carne Asada is extra $).

I understand not liking your job but at least fain liking it. The only saving grace making this a two star review v. A one start review, were the churro bites. They were delicious! All in all don't waste your time or money. If you want authentic then go to Los Tacos. If you want chipotle, then just go there. This knock off isn't worth it.",kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,0,0,2,TPyHaPF5rbPDBGHBfQKp_w

After I ordered my food I waited for another 10 minutes. Don't come here for your lunch break. And they play the music so loud you can't even hear them call your order. Also, my shrimp burrito had like 6 pieces of shrimp. So it was basically crap.",jGtjioSZuux094_dxd-4NQ,0,0,1,7cym-6Vh2T6FWpCkJzHfYQ

First visit was quick, second was painfully slow (partially due to the customer in front of us who was incredibly rude - to everyone - and kept adding things to her giant order). I love their carne asada tacos though, so I'll probably keep coming back. Just keep in mind it might take a while.

Side note, the first time we ate here the refried beans were unbearably salty. We couldn't even eat them. I haven't risked trying them again yet to know if it was a fluke or not. Chips and rice were good, green salsa is delicious!

It's a little expensive for tacos. About 9 bucks just for 2 carne asada tacos, which are a little bigger than other places like Pinche's, but still feels overpriced. Guacamole is included in the carne asada price which is annoying since I don't want that on my tacos - give me onion, cilantro, lime juice and green salsa and I'm a happy girl.",FX6SQ1GhLf2O_J1JnrfjkQ,2,1,3,_LXOo0MviD2U2P-9W2mK1w

The guacamole was the only selling point of the whole taco. My husband got the carne Asada fries and he didn't mind it, fries were good. The decor is really nice and looked like it was going to have potential but came up short. We both have heard people love the place and we both agreed we rather go somewhere else.",vqe-wt1H-H6AksHY252-tA,0,0,3,L_oOHG5uTuCsezbKCF3SXw

I had gone with some friends this past weekend and although my food was fine, they were out of Spanish rice. Which they told my friends it would be a couple minutes. Then the guy burnt the rice which turned into 30 minute wait. Then they were out of steak. It wasn't very busy so I don't know why they waited until customers came in to start making the rice. 

I'll give it one more try, but it's nothing like the Chronic Tacos in California.",4IVtQfL1jRv_83y46eiY5Q,0,0,3,6pnP6e8yoQmTlaR7oUO-Hg
