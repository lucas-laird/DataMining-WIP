We ordered egg rolls which were filled with crisp bell peppers not soggy cabbage! They were perfectly fried and not that greasy. For entrees I got the Mongolian beef and my boyfriend for the kung pow chicken. Both were delicious and served with fresh veggies mixed in. They also give you hot towels after each course which I thought was a nice touch (especially after egg rolls),Zq-Qsf_T6BxQvOybnblzmA,0,0,4,mZj70bqFDiZQptGTqD05Uw

And you know how you hardly ever get a ""how was the food?/ is there anything else you need?"" or get any attention when you're at a Chinese restaurant, well, you won't get that here.  You'll get all the attention you need.  Their BBQ pork ribs are a mouth watering dish, full of flavor and just cooked enough to be tender and not falling off the bone.  Fried Chilean Sea Bass was terrific.  Very expesive place though, I guess it comes with the territory.  So expect to put out at least $100 for party of 2.

288418,2017-05-28,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"Very nice modern style Chinese restaurant. Food quality is above average although can be a little greasy (primarily speaking about the fried rice). Although this is a hit or miss, as the last time I was here, it was perfect. I am Chinese and have eaten my fair share of Chinese food so I know what is good. I have tasted better Chinese food in Canada, and this no where compares to the authenticity of the food in China. But overall, it is decently high quality with good service. You pay a premium to eat in the hotel, but you get a nice atmosphere. 

Nonetheless it can be fairly affordable--we paid around $120 for a dinner for two after tax and tip. Fried sea bass for $38, lettuce vegetable wrap $16, OX spicy fried rice $32. That's the prices off the top of my head. Could be worse considering the sky is the limit for high end Vegas food. Portion is good and is a convenient eat for those staying here. Primarily eat here because was comped credits.

Note: they offer if you want to take pictures. Probably don't want that. We did that once as a group, had two pictures and it was probably $50 or $100 for the pictures. They don't tell you the price. Don't get shocked, nothing is free in Vegas",rCOKe6JU_Wu8hFv28mb1sA,0,0,4,eT4Kd2oza0ciGXndzY-7yA

468081,2015-10-12,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"What were we thinking?  The combination of food we ordered just didn't work.

Peking Duck-Choice of buns or pancakes.  Go with the pancakes.  We asked to try both.  The buns are good, but the thin pancakes definitely allow the flavors to come through.  My wife liked the cucumber and scallions, but I could have done without the cucumber.  It detracted from the dish.  The duck was good and presentation and service was excellent, but I have had a crispier skinned duck at a better price here in Hawai'i.

Crispy Chilean Sea Bass-Thick, crunchy crust. This dish lacked presentation and its textures were not complementary.  Two steaks leaning on a mound of shredded daikon. The crust was hard to break through. I marveled at its crunchiness, and the wife thought it was gummy.  Flavors were good, soy sauce, peanut oil?, and scallions. However, the delicate, fresh fish was not allowed to shine because of that thick crust which was also quite oily.

Yang Chow Fried Rice-Char siu (pork) and shrimp.  Typical, but the shrimp was abundant and cooked perfectly...and a little oily.  

Pea shoots-Sauteed with garlic.  There was a lot of garlic...a whole lot, but it was good....

Food service was very good.  Water service was poor.   On our part, food selection could have been better.  We left the restaurant feeling like we had just eaten at a greasy spoon.  The duck we expected to be fatty, but everything we ordered seemed to be oily.  Considering the price point, I expected better.  This is a decent restaurant that uses quality ingredients.  Some dishes are a little off the mark and in the wrong combination, can make the meal a fail.",LYqweFmnkZ155q4sZBIzkw,1,1,3,4EmugmADZ7rFQZzww-qslA

Two points of constructive criticism:

1) They did not stagger the appetizers and entrees  well at all. No more than three minutes after finishing our appetizers did our dinner arrive. I would have appreciated some time to digest the appetizers. 

2) There were extra table chairs in the vicinity of our table and an unoccupied chair at our booth. The hostess sat us at the booth and did not remove the chair. Our waiter arrived, took our drink order and did not remove the chair. The waiter came back to take our dinner order and still did not remove the chair. Employees of Blossom!, if there is an unoccupied chair at a table, you need to remove it. I had to get up and remove the chair myself.

581350,2016-01-04,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"We reserved the large private dining room for a group of 19 for our wedding reception. The reservation was done through Aria group dining, but they worked with the chef to customize our menu. There were too many items to go into detail about each one, but overall they were excellent. I especially recommend the goose liver and lobster. Quality of food would be a 5/5, although the crispy sea bass was one item that was somewhat disappointing. Portions were huge, way more than our group could manage to finish.

I had a couple of minor drink-related gripes. First, they didn't tell us what the price would be for the Fiji water they were pouring. They would end up charging us for 11 bottles of water at $9 each, so as a group we were charged over $120 for water after tax and gratuity! If we had known it would be that much, we would have asked for regular tap water. Second, we ordered 2 bottles of wine - one for each table that our group was seated at. Once the 2 bottles were done, they automatically opened 2 more and started pouring - even though everyone had already had enough wine. So that's another extra $140+ that we ended up paying. I really don't like to feel like I got price-gouged when the menu is finalized beforehand, so Blossom gets 4 stars instead of 5.",TDOVp-BzKusKbNB5myoDeQ,1,0,4,8s8Mi-hBUjtTK6c2JFbGCQ
615360,2013-09-24,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"One of the BEST Chinese restaurants Las Vegas has to offer!  

As any Foodie knows, Las Vegas is home to some of the GREATEST restaurants in the country, Blossom is NO exception!  I have dined here twice and both times received EXCELLENT service and OUTSTANDING dishes!  

My second time here I treated a few casino hosts to dinner that have never been here and even they were impressed!  The decor is ultra modern, very comfortable, and spacious.  From the moment you sit down, the great service begins from Blossom's friendly and courteous staff.  You will NEVER need to flag anyone down, they are aware of your every move and will anticipate your every need before you have to ask, thus allowing you to enjoy your meal, drinks, and company to perfection!  

THE FOOD:
There are many great dishes here, and truth be told I don't believe you will ever have a bad meal here.  For starters I would recommend the Egg Rolls with Bell Pepper, Pot Stickers (Pork), BBQ Back Ribs, and their Hot and Sour Soup!  Any and all of these will be sure to please any taste palate and prepare you for amazing main courses to come.

For main courses, you can again, order many dishes that are large enough to share family style.  The Peeking Duck may be a bit pricey, but it is very good and served in wraps (A bit different than the norm, but VERY good)  I also recommend the Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken, and Beef Tenderloin in Black Pepper Sauce.  All are excellent dishes!  

THE BOTTOM LINE:
Blossom is at the TOP of my list for Chinese dining while in Las Vegas, this place is consistently EXCELLENT in both food and customer service!  The ambiance is both inviting and comfortable, and allows you to hold conversations among your party at a reasonable level without having to shout.

While yelp stars for Blossom wasn't the highest, I still selected Blossom based on the treatment of the duck. I was looking for table side carving with lots of crispy skin served with steamed buns. And while Blossom did this well, they also took the rest of the duck back to be chopped up as a duck entree. This was okay, but I was hoping for a larger serving Peking duck style with buns/wraps than just regular duck to eat with rice. We actually got our Peking duck served with both buns and wraps - the sauce was tasty and the cucumber/onions were fresh and crunchy. It was yummy and reminded me of similar experiences eating Peking duck in Bejing.

In addition to the duck, we had the hot and sour soup (spicy and tangy, one of the better hot and sour soups out there) and sauteed pea shoots (simple yet executed perfectly). 

For drinks, I tried the Blossom cocktail, which consisted of a ginger/lemongrass infused soju, rock sugar, and was served with a Thai bird chili. It was very flavorful and I wish I remembered the rest of the ingredients! Definitely give it a try.

992669,2014-08-29,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"For our second Restaurant Week meal, benefitting Three Square Food Bank, we dined at Blossom inside Aria. My brother joined us. He's matured so much over the years and I'm happy to share my love of food with him. It's something he's definitely come to appreciate. He used to eat nothing but chicken fingers and BBQ cheeseburgers. Now, he can find the value in a good meal and I respect his willingness to try new things. 

Blossom receives little attention, yet reviews for the restaurant are pretty solid. Prices are steep, but in line with other fine dining Chinese restaurants. The restaurant has a lovely quiet ambience tucked away near Baccarat. Service was attentive. The Restaurant Week menu offered dinner for $50.14, we were started with Wor Wonton soup, then we had the choice of Pot Stickers or Shrimp Toast for appetizers, followed by entree selections of Crisp Fried Chilean Sea Bass or Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushroom, served with Pork Fried Rice. Dessert was Mochi Ice Cream. 

We sampled all that was available. The Wor Wonton soup had large shrimp, scallop and two wontons with broccoli and mushrooms. The broth lacked depth, flavor improved with a spoonful of garlic sriracha. 

The Potstickers were large and nicely prepared, but it was the Shrimp Toast that were memorable. Each bite was so buttery it seemed to melt in your mouth. It was a pleasant surprise. 

Chilean Sea Bass is my second favorite fish, so I was very excited to dig in. The filet was deep fried and it had a nice tempura crust, but I found it unfortunate that the breading overwhelmed the natural flavor of the fish. Still, it was beautifully presented. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was nicely done, but the flavor was a bit mild for my taste. Another spoonful of sriracha, gave it the kick it needed. The Bok Choy was fresh and tender. The Beef Tenderloin was bursting with flavor from the black pepper marinade. It was a tasty dish.

Dessert concluded our meal with Mochi Ice Cream, Green Tea and Mango were the flavors. I usually enjoy green tea ice cream, but the mango was a strong favorite. It was light with bold refreshing flavor. The Mochi was chewy without being too gummy. When asked how he enjoyed his meal, my brother replied, ""It's fucking weird, but I like it."" Just like that another foodie is born. 

Blossom was a great choice for Restaurant Week, it's not likely a restaurant I would have chosen otherwise. However, it was a nice treat and it left me drooling over their peking duck and dungeness crab on the regular menu.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,2,4,hVYDzLCoEc4jP7XlrG3lMA

1049980,2014-09-06,1,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"Blossom is a high end restaurant located in City Center at the Aria. The restaurant looks beautiful and it really sets the mood for an intimate dinner. Waiters and guest are most definitely at the top of their etiquette. Table setting was decent to me and their menu look beautiful. However, when opening their menus, I was blown away that their menu wasn't entirely expensive. Yes, they do have dishes that cost between $50-$200, but they also have a wide variety of dishes between $10-$40. I went to this restaurant with a few other people and we decided to eat family style. We ordered a bunch of rice dishes like Walnut Prawns, Clams, Bok Choy, Choy Sum, Seabass, Duck, Beef Tendon, Duck Tongue, and Fried Rice. I had to say though, the presentation of the dishes was not all that great. They seemed to just placed the food on the plates and bring them out to the table. Plus, they did not clean the plates before serving.....what kind of high end restaurant doesn't clean their plates?!? The portions were small, but it was expected. Now the food, it didn't have the flavors that stuck out to me, in fact, a lot of dishes tasted bland to me. The only dish I actually enjoyed was the duck, I was actually surprised that this dish wish tasty and the texture was just right. Overall, if I am going to pay hundreds of dollars to eat an expensive restaurant, I'm going to need more than a fancy setting, I want my food to actually look and taste good.

1184070,2017-01-03,1,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"I had made a reservation for a group of 8 at 8:30pm. Due to traffic we ended up arriving at 8:53pm and they were nice enough to seat us regardless of our late arrival. 

That was about the best thing that happened at this restaurant. We decided to come here based on the reviews about the food and their ""great"" service. Sadly, we did not get to experience anything of that caliber. Instead we were met with non existent service and a waitress who came off very rude. We had ordered our dishes and the waitress said ""you should probably order one more dish it won't be enough."" So no big deal we ordered another dish. 

Some of our food came out and noticed all the tables around us had bigger dinner plates, except we had the small appetizer plates. We waited for about 15 mins till we could track someone down. Finally we asked the manager Eddie, his response ""we thought you guys would be more comfortable with the smaller plates since there is a lot of you. In response I said ""that's funny because you guys changed the plates of the table behind us and they have the same group number and size table"" he quickly said he would have them changed and he did. 

We let one of the guys changing our plates know we were still waiting for one soup & another chicken plate and he said he would let our server know. After 15 mins or so, our waitress finally showed up. And when she did she created us with ""you guys did not order anymore food."" And I said ""yes we did my father asked for our macadamia nut chicken"" and she said ""no he did not. I can place that order for you now."" With that said my father then asked ""well, what about the soup?"" And she said ""you didn't order that either, I can place it for you now."" 

At this point I didn't even want to be in this restaurant anymore. I feel like it would have been very different if she came up and said ""I apologize for the confusion but..."" instead of going straight into ""you guys didn't order anything else"" when we all know we specifically did because she even suggested ordering more food.

I really don't want to play the race card here but I feel like we were discriminated against. Our table was the only colored group in the mix. As an Mlife member I expected more. But for mediocre food for $30 a plate, & non-existent service I can for certain say I will never come again.",UZuDZyDJhYtYPtCzen4FFw,3,0,1,v_1j1Kb3weEcfG5G3WERJQ

The duck was served with skin and meat and sauce on a wrap. Ummm. It should be served with skin only? The skin is not crispy enough. The sauce is ok. After that the duck was brought back to chop.

Peking (Beijing) duck: crispy flavor skin and wrapped in the Chinese tortilla wish hoisin sauce. God damn it was great. I had it in china and the taste was comparable. If you want to try the Peking duck then you will jot be disappointed!! Maximum flavor.

Mushroom appetizer: there's a mushroom appetizer they make that is really good. Comes out infused with some candy glaze that just takes over the flavor. It's great.

BBQ ribs: perfect. Not overdone or slimy or anything. Color was a deep red, candy like. Just perfect!! 

Also I have to add that the service was great. They knew not just how to help us order and suggest items but also they did a great job at controlling the tempo if how the food came out to us. Everything seemed to flow out at a great pace dish after dish and all prepared and ready right when they brought it to us. Nothing we ate had the notion of being under a heat lamp or anything like that. I have to mention his because the amount of dishes we ordered would be challenging even for a experienced waiter to be able to time for us. 

Oxtail was great, nice consistency on the sauce. Meat was falling off the bone too,

Spicy chicken was really good. I can't put a finger on the flavor in it but it had an aromatic smell/taste so unique and good I keep thinking about it.


Drinks: the family ordered singapore slings and they were very good. Not too sweet. I ordered Hendricks and tonic and it 
was strong with a nice lemon garnish. Prepped nicely.

Chinese dinner was a hit at this one. I'll definitely do it again. I'll order Peking duck, mushroom appetizer and the soup.

1416077,2013-10-29,1,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"I was a bit skeptical when I found out about this place at Aria.  Given the experience with Chinese places inside a hotel on the Strip tended to be an expensive mediocre food quality meal.  When we arrived, there was not anybody at the reception for some reasons, minutes later somebody showed up and seated us at our table.  The décor matched the level Aria has with a darker theme like many fine dining restaurants.

First impression we got was our waitress really talk down on us based on our familiarity with their menu.  Not off to a great start.  We got some BBQ Back Ribs and BBQ Pork (Char Siu) for starter.  The ribs tasted decent, the meat was tender and it leaves a teeth mark after biting onto it.  The char siu was ok, even though they used a more expensive area of the pig, but the food color usage sets the quality back.   They have luxurious items like shark fin, bird's nest, and abalone here as well.

For main course, we had Braised Bai Ling Mushroom with Baby Bok Choy.  It was a bit disappointing, they did not cook the mushroom long enough, which made it taste like can mushroom.  Foo Jian-style Fried Rice was tasty, probably the best dish among what we ordered for the night, there was a nice balance between the sauce and fried rice.  In comparison with, Egg White & Dried Scallop Fried Rice, which was decent, but just not as good as the Foo Jian rice.  Pan Fried Fish Patty with Daikon was ok.  Spicy Chicken had an overwhelming flavor in it, almost felt like a bit too much.  Salt & Pepper Fried Tofu was a bit uneven seasoned.

I have mixed feeling about their service, on one end, we got an odd waitress with rude attitude and she took forever to get the bill right at the end.  On the other end, we have great supporting service with our plates getting swap for clean one after each dinner phase and there was a floor manager figure making service was up to par.  They all still had that poker face though.

Blossom has potential to become the best Chinese restaurant in town, I am still not convinced yet, perhaps I am judging them harsher being a fine dining place.  Some elements are still missing here.  Price was actually not too expensive compared to some of the place I visited in Vegas.",B2F7f8NdlBUESv8cskE-jw,1,0,4,z9f-tcumPzjU-PG_uDS0cQ

We started with cocktails.  One was baijiu based, and had a unique taste, while the other was a sweet and fruity one.

Next we had appetizers.  Their Crisp-Fried Eggplant was delicious.  Even better was the Crisp Fried Shrimp on White Toast, served on top of cabbage, with side dishes of mayonnaise and a tangy (tamarind?) sauce.  Almost ordered a second one.

For entrees we had their Crisp-Fried Chilean Sea Bass and Jian Bo Beef.  Chilean Sea Bass is one of my favorite fishes, and they gave a generous portion of fish that was perfectly fried.  Sole critique: this dish needs a bit more flavor, some kind of sauce.  In contrast, the Jian Bo Beef came with a delicious sauce.

We recommend the BBQ pork appetizer, the steamed bass and tofu in black been sauce which was light and flavorful, the mustard greens cooked in savory broth, topped with shredded dried scallop...yumm.  The mustard greens can be bitter but it was well balanced with the other ingredients and made a great soup.

The Mongolian beef dish was also cooked just right and complemented by mushrooms and other veggies.  Cocktails were made just right.

The only issue we had was the fancy chopsticks was not comfortable due to its shape and weight distribution!  I am used to the regular bamboo chopsticks!",HHtFyuYaWxHvXUzYD_1HYA,0,0,4,Lkz4hd3Q4AnTq0mKE5OlPQ

First, the wine list - not too shabby. A decent selection with fair prices.  We ordered a bottle of Whitehall Lane Cabs.  (One of my favorite wineries in Napa.)  Markup on this bottle was not bad for a Vegas restaurant!

There was 5 of us and we shared the food family style. 

Potstickers - I didn't try these but everyone at the table really liked them.

Chicken Lettuce wraps - pretty good.... didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for.  I added some of their house hot sauce to spruce it up!

Shiitake Mushrooms - WOW!  These were amazing.  These meaty mushrooms were fried to perfection and then sauteed in a delish sauce!!!  This is was the table favorite for the appetizers.

Chicken Chow Mein - Standard.  I liked that it wasn't too oily!

Spicy Indian-style Fried Rice - I LOVE CURRY so this was amazing!  Perfect heat too!

Ma Po Tofu - I have an emotional tie to this dish...  the tofu had the perfect texture and the sauce was delicious and spicy!  (The portion of this dish was HUGE!  basically this is only thing that didn't get finished at the table.)

Spicy Chicken Hot Pot - I did not try this but was told this was good.

Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushrooms - The table ordered this cooked medium rare.  I didn't try this either, but this was the rest of the table's favorite main dish.  They raved about how perfectly the meat was cooked and how amazing the sauce was. 

There were so many other items on the menu we wanted to try so I cannot wait to come back here and try some more new dishes as well as reorder some of our favorites!",eDynZ2A4rIfp-9xLnE-_lA,3,3,4,N-P8nZTVYQrCMdW7ZkgFBA

Firstly, they really have delicious dishes, which I think is the best Sichuan Cuisine that tastes very similar with my hometown food in the town. The restaurant is located in the casino floor and takes few minutes to walk from the self-parking or Valet parking. The front of restaurant is not very obvious and might need to ask for direction. The whole decoration of restaurant is close to modern Chinese style and the light inside is not bright, but for me it's comfortable and quiet during the dining time. I did not have tour to the kitchen. The best dish I like over there is the Sichuan Style boiled beef. The Spicy boiled beef appearance red chili peppers on the top; the soup in the dish also is dull, close to the dark red. It smells pungent, spicy with Chinese prickly ash. The dish includes beef, tofu, and lettuces, beef is chewy, tofu is soft and absorbed soup become very juicy. Whole flavor is very spicy and pungent with oily soup. The taste could stay in the mouth for long time. To balance this spicy dish, it could add some vinegar for a little bit sour.",ahZgA0--rCw9Ln5k2gUnwQ,0,0,5,CUuZ-71-LZDzdaldSWktqA

A friend and I came wanted to try fancy schmancy places and this past weekend we went to two different places.  Blossom is cute, it reminds me of those Chinese soap operas where a kung fu fight is about to break out at. HAHA.  We made reservations and was seated right away, they were not packed but there was a good amount of people.  

The food had great presentation.  We tried:
- Lettuce Wrap
- Spicy Indian-Style Fried Rice
- Walnut Prawns
- Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushrooms
- Lychee Creme Brulee

The food was delicious.  It is definately more tasty than most traditional chinese restaurants.  It is pricier than the traditional places but it is actually slightly cheaper than fancy American joints. 

Next time we will try the Peking Duck.  You get a whole duck and they slice it in front of you.  We really wanted to get it but one whole duck is too much for just the two of us.

We were stuffed after our main dishes but wanted to try the dessert, it sounded tempting.  Boy were we glad we got it! The LYCHEE Creme Bruless is to die for! DELICIOUS! 

Our server was nice and helpful.  He also joked with us about traditional chinese restaurants.  We asked for sliced oranges and fortune cookies at the end to joke about. :]",udeR1S-eZM25E_ztg5x53w,0,0,5,fZHVZRnGUwtrXc_er6h9nQ

I tried very hard to convince myself and my table of colleagues that Blossom was aiming for the highly refined palate, and we were to ""experience the essence of ginger"" in our very bland potstickers.  There was hope in the delicious bowls of vegetarian hot and sour soup (although not very hot and very expensive at $10 a bowl -- more like a cup).  After this, our hopes were dashed repeatedly, first with the kung pao chicken that had no ""pao"" in it and second with the crispy sea bass that had large pieces of bone.  One person received a piece with vertebrae and hardly any fish meat to try.  I ordered the tofu and shiitake mushroom dish, which on most accounts tends to be bland to begin with.  I enjoyed this the most; the tofu was high quality and silky, and the mushrooms were fresh.  Unfortunately, my table mates were disappointed even with the hot sauces and chiles they requested on the side.  If you like real authentic Chinese food, you will be disappointed by the lack of flavor and the high prices here.

Service was excellent, though.  And the tea was very good -- similar to what I have had in Taiwan.

It's interesting to note that along with the rest of the ARIA resort, the restaurant is poorly designed.  Everything here is maze-like, with no simple (effective) throughway.  It seems this would be a safety hazard.  What if there was some kind of emergency?  We couldn't figure out how to get out of the restaurant without someone pointing the way, and we were in no hurry.

Pot Stickers - Tender and tasty. Standard potstickers.

Egg Rolls - Standard.  Toasty when fresh.

BBQ Pork - Tender and well flavored.

Kung Pao Chicken and Shrimp - Tasty, spicy, excellent quality.

Pan Fried Beef Tenderloin - Really liked this one.  Great texture and flavor.

Beef Broccoli - Standard and tasty.  Two types of broccoli for options.

Hong Kong Style Chow Mein with seafood - This was great and went fast.  Lots of variety and nice textures of crispy noodles.

Some other type of Chow Mein - Also good.  Not pan fried noodles though.  Good sauce.

An interesting note, there is a $44K bottle of wine listed on their wine menu (it's a 1990 vintage I believe).  Hard to justify that, but it was the first time seeing that before.

Summary: Food was very good as far as flavors and quality goes.  The service was impeccable.  Very attentive and efficient with ensuring everyone had drinks, food, etc. whenever needed.  The only qualm I have with this place is the price.  It is an upscale Chinese restaurant, and definitely elegant inside, but $30 for beef and broccoli... One can't honestly say that it's worth that much.  So it wasn't.  The dinner was too expensive to warrant it a ""good deal,"" but it was still a nice dinner and good for a large group.",mrPUDzaxNQDc-JXG3JmuFw,2,0,4,fTQpc3nL7x4DlGAMwGs7_g

First, I hate how hard of a hit Vegas in general has taken due to the economy, and having the restaurant be less than 25% full on a Saturday night was a sad reminder of the current state of affairs.  But back to Blossom... outstanding service.  Sounds like others have had similar surprise desserts due to a passing mention of a special occasion.  I felt a tad guilty, because it was clear that the waiter misunderstood us... we didn't actually get married that day, we just got our marriage LICENSE that day.  Oh well, we still got a fabulously gorgeous and delicious dessert - for free!

Back to the beginning... I actually can't remember what our appetizers were - we ordered several, and I know they were very tasty, but clearly neither were true standouts.  Several of the entrees we ordered were enormous portions!  My mom ordered the sea bass, and it was notably good.  I had the mongolian beef and it was good enough for me to finish the entire thing (despite being on the standard bridal pre-wedding diet, so that says a lot).  My now-husband had a great entree that I can't remember, but nothing special.

Overall, we had a wonderful time celebrating the procurement of our State of Nevada marriage license at Blossom, and I hope we'll find an occasion to return soon.",xSI4zpl9EaETOHyzshOIBw,3,0,5,Fl6WelgsAFc3RcGL1PErDg

2800166,2015-05-18,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"Best duck!

We will be back. Would have given 5 stars for outstanding service and great food, but towards the end of our meal they seemed to forget about us (or they just got too busy).  I recommend you go with as many people as you can get to go with you because you'll want to try many items. The portions are generous - unusual for a restaurant with prices this high. When I asked the server about specials or items not on the menu, she freely and openly tried to list the numerous options from cold appetizers like jellyfish and duck wings to spicy szechuan style soup.  

Our meal started with an amuse bouche of bitter melon in a sweet and spicy sauce (delicious). We followed this with the roast port (char siu) - this portion looked to be about 8 oz - also delicious, and the goose liver. The goose liver was presented as two slices (about 1/4"" thick) nicely charred and crisp on the outside and incredibly creamy on the inside served over shredded radish/carrot. For our main course(s), we ordered the duck 3 ways. With the first duck course we were offered a choice of pancakes/wraps or buns, we chose both. Usually, I like the buns best, but their pancakes were so light and delicate, I will choose the pancakes in the future. The duck itself was moist and flavorful with the right amount of crispy skin. Our second duck course was a stir-fry with bean sprouts and onion. We finished with the soup. Here they served it in two parts. They cut up the bones with tofu, mustard greens, garlic, etc. to make the broth, then they served the soup as a consomme and put the bones + on a separate platter. We loved all three duck courses. We've had Peking duck all over the world and this was probably the best version we've ever tried.

Honestly, I think you wind up paying high prices for mediocre, routine Chinese food just because it's placed on nice plates and surrounded by beautiful decorations at Blossom. 

Yes, they have a wide variety of dishes and specialties like shark fin, giant clam, abalone, and bird's nest but aside from that, their entree selection is no different from other standard Chinese restaurants (Panda Express is not an example). Like most Chinese restaurants, the entrees are made to share and the portions are decent size. They have plenty of wine and beer to choose from. Our service was excellent. Without us having to ask, the waiter brought out toothpicks and complimentary sesame balls.

If you're just dying and in need of some Chinese food loving, then this place is not bad and will satisfy your craving. But if you're visiting Vegas and looking to try the ""best"" restaurants, I would pass this place up.",lOVu-In8ypGCZzIKYEZU7Q,11,4,3,EngspPdqVo24G7q3lfaGOQ
2877797,2018-04-22,9,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"The thing about the high-end restaurants in Las Vegas is that so many of them are offshoots of famous restaurants in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Miami Beach. I skip most of them on my trips to Vegas because I can go to the exact same restaurant in New York City (or San Francisco or Miami Beach or LA). 

Blossom is a restaurant that you will find only in Las Vegas. Prior to my first time at Blossom about half a decade ago, I would never have thought that I would travel to Vegas to dine at a Chinese restaurant. The Hong Kong style black pepper goose liver appetizer at Blossom has forever changed my views about the use of offal in Chinese cuisine. It's unlike anything else I've found anywhere else in the US. The best way I can describe it is foie gras with a delightful black pepper kick. I will sometimes get 3 servings of this phenomenal appetizer as my main dish. 

Another unique appetizer that Blossom used to offer was the seafood medallions. This was like the lovechild of shrimp toast and crab rangoon. Much to my dismay, this menu item was discontinued a few years ago.

They had a special dim sum lunch menu special for the Chinese New Year, and that won us over. I was able to share my (minuscule) knowledge of authentic Chinese street food with my guy that I gained while in China. He was open to trying the chicken feet and ox tripe (which were both excellent, it brought back memories). We ate here three times during our five night stay.

My boyfriend went crazy for the Giant Clam (at $200+, it's far from cheap). I enjoyed it as well, but would only recommend it if you're a fan of clam to begin with. We had the Giant Clam sashimi-style and the ""head"" (we're still not quite sure what it was) of the clam came to our table later, deep fried with salt & pepper. It was very tasty as well. 

The Peking duck is both beautiful and delicious, however it is only available for dinner. The only thing I found peculiar was that they didn't make duck bone soup with the bones (it's traditionally served after the meal), but I overlooked that.

I took my family here during our family trip up to Vegas since my parents are difficult to please. I figured the menu is in Chinese so they can order what they felt was appetizing. Here was the dinner:

Goose liver: Absolutely ahhmaaaazing! It's two slabs of liver that is way too much for one person. I think it would've gone well with a small piece of toast, kind of like a spread. But eating it by itself was delicious too.

Peking Duck: $80?!?!? but i have to say it was the best duck I've ever had. Super juicy and flavorful. You get to have the skin with the buns and then the rest of the duck is cut up afterwards.

Chilean Sea Bass: Pretty small portion but definitely not a dish for one person. The batter was very light and crispy. Bass was juicy and flakey. 

Spicy Chicken hot pot: Pass. It was a pretty average dish that I wouldn't pay that much for ever again.

Sausage Fried Rice: We ordered this just to accompany the other dishes. It was pretty pricey for what it is, but at least it wasn't bad.

Beef Chow Mein (crispy): My sister ordered this to compare with another Chinese restaurant she liked in Vegas. She thinks the other place was better. I thought it was pretty good. Very typical but at least the flavors were all there, the beef was tender, and the noodles were crispy and not oily.

The water! Omg GROSS! It kind of ruined the meal for a lot of us. I think if the water was better, I would've enjoyed the meal a little more.

Service was great. The hosts and the waitstaff were all very polite and attentive. The floorplan was simple and I loved the interior. It was Asian but very modern.

Its also a beautiful, sophisticated ambiance, great for impressing a group of Business clients or date night. The food was pretty good, but the ambiance made up for it.

The best was the Garlic Prawn fried rice. Im always impressed when fancy restaurants could make a simple dish taste so unique and enjoyable without packing on the salt.

I had also asked for a side of XO spicy sauce that i noticed they had on the lobster fried rice. This sauce is AMAZING as a spicy kick to your dishes, or for me, just devoured that plate as a side dish. Theyve made this in-house with dried shrimp and scallop. I will warn you though (since the waitor didnt), that they will charge you 6$ for this. But i found it well worth it if youre a Spicy/Seafood lover like me.

The next best thing thats a must is their ""Steamed Seabass & Tofu"". That fish tasted like pure butter, melted right in my mouth, atop the soft tofu, finished with thin slices of scallion, spices & black bean sauce.

The other dishes we ordered that were pretty good, but not ""MUSTS"" were the Beef tenderloin with portabella mushrooms (quality beef, but too salty), pan-fried beef with sweet ginger & pineapple and kungpao chicken.

We ordered soups (corn chowder, 3 hot and sour, and a tofu and mushroom). My tofu and mushroom soup wasn't very good. The broth was salty and tasted like the canned chicken broth. 
     On the other hand, the steamed spot prawns were to die for. These prawns were the size of my pointer finger all the way down to the end of my thumb (and I have big hands). Don't forget to slurp all the ocean-y goodness from the head. I feel cheated though because I was told they would have eggs in them. They must not be in season. They were mild, fresh, and sweet. Loved their condiment with spicy peppers soaked in soy sauce. Watch out, it's spicy! We ordered two pounds, roughly about ten pieces. 
     We also ordered the tempura fried ice fish with salt and pepper. Salty but anything deep fried will always taste good. Next was the Peking duck served with buns and wrappers. There was nothing special about the duck. Pretty standard duck, I'll pass on it next time. Chinese sausage fried rice and garlic ong-choy (spinach family) were also just mediocre. 
     Steamed red cod live fish was HUGE. A whopping four pounds ($48/LB). The fish was steamed with soy sauce, green onions, and probably garlic and ginger. The flesh was flaky, sweet, and the sauce complemented the fish well. 
     The damage at the end was over $600 and that's without tip. Oh yeah, I had a Stella just one! Overall, the meal was a well-rounded meal. Service was great. Overpriced for sure.

Here you can get your typical Chinese entree for $290 or a bottle of wine for $44,000.  However, we chose several entrees ranging from $20-$30 and our sommelier, Simon, chose a lovely bottle of zinfandel for around $50.
I really enjoyed the Kung Pao shrimp, as the prawns were huge and flavorful. Just watch for those dried red peppers.   I also enjoyed the Spicy on Spicy pork dish.

We had a little of everything to make the most of our first time. Besides the wine and the Fiji water, we had the Peking duck, full live cod, xo green beans, wonton and hot and sour soup. To begin, the soups were both fantastic. While the hot and sour was more traditional, the wonton was a full ensemble with enoki mushroom, scallops, and large wontons - delicious. The Peking duck was fantastic. The skin melt in your mouth good and the buns sticky and fresh. The wrap portion of the Peking duck was tasty. But the actual cooked duck served as part of the main meal was something else entirely. Fantastic meat and cooked through perfectly. The live cod was the standout of the meal though. Served full, bone in, with bok choy and tofu on the side of the dish, the dish was beautiful to say the least. The fish was chewy but the braised sauce really tasted fantastic, especially coupled with some of the truly spicy complimentary sauces. The dish was great with tasty vegetables and tofu, easily 10x better than the xo green beans ordered as an extra. 

The meal will surely set you back. But it will also fill you up so you definitely get out of there under $100 per person if you order the right dishes and go for the lower prices alcohol.

The dinner menu has many familiar classic Chinese dishes that you could order elsewhere for much less, but you're coming here for the quality of the food and the experience. For one night, just forget that you saw the $20+ price tag for that walnut shrimp. There are also two prix-fixe options: the Early Evening Menu and the Signature Tasting Menu. My boyfriend and I went with the latter, which offers a well-rounded dining experience.

Soup - Wor Wonton: A delicious, mellow broth with dumplings, rice noodles, plenty of enoki mushrooms, and scallops and shrimp. 

Appetizer - Goose Liver (not on the Signature Tasting Menu):  Superb. There was a sweet and savory blend of spices that complement the fatty richness of the tender liver. The flavors were unique and unlike other goose livers I've tried. 

Appetizer - Crisp-fried beef roll with enoki mushrooms: This was fine. I wasn't expecting a small meat roll inside. A word of caution: cut this sucker in half before eating. This was HOT!

Appetizer - Crisp-fried eggplant: Out of the three, this was my favorite. Pairs well with the spicy HK vinaigrette sauce, though perfect on its own.

Appetizer - Pot Stickers: Plump and filled with a lot of flavorful meat. 

Main Course - Beef Tenderloin With Portabella Mushroom and Black Pepper Sauce: Cooked to medium-rare perfection with heavy black pepper.

Main Course - Crisp-fried Chilean Sea Bass: Flaky and delectable, but it definitely requires the sweet soy sauce that it comes with.

Main Course - Yang Chow Fried Rice: If you aren't full by now, the fried rice will do the trick and fill you up. Tasty, high-end fried rice. 

Entree - Hong Kong Style Chow Mein (Seafood): Plenty of seafood and garnished with stalks of Chinese broccoli. Loved the crunchiness of the noodles. 

Dessert - Mochi Ice Cream: There are three flavors: green tea, red bean, and mango. Both green tea and red bean were delightful.

Service -  Excellent, and they even gifted a box containing a pineapple cake and sachet of tea.

Overall - I had an enjoyable dining experience.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,8,6,4,mPfXFNvtFDtNaqtWTMdtCw

3657429,2012-02-17,9,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"This will be my very first review for Yelp.  I don't normally write reviews because 99% of the times I eat out I am with my husband Dennis T.  Now, for those of you who are familiar with Dennis' reviews you will understand why I don't find it necessary to write reviews.  He says it all, and in a much more creative and descriptive way than I ever could.  Who would want to follow his act?

Dennis decided for Valentine's Day that we would eat at Blossom in Aria and follow it up with the Viva ELVIS show.  Excellent choices, but I won't be reviewing either one.  My sole reason for writing this review is to make you and the management at Blossom aware of an excellent server named Jackson V.  Immediately after I was seated he presented me with a perfect long stemmed red rose for Valentine's Day.  That was a very nice surprise, but not the reason for my review.  Jackson was simply one of the nicest servers I have ever encountered.
 
We asked what kind of hot tea they had and after naming three types we weren't sure if we wanted Oolong or Jasmine.  We expressed to Jackson that we thought it was Oolong that we liked and ordered a pot.  After he poured our tea and we both tasted it he inquired how we liked it.  I said it was okay, but I really think I prefer Jasmine.  Without our prompting he immediately went to the kitchen and procured a piping hot order of Jasmine tea and gave each of us new teacups.  Now Dennis has two teacups in front of him and when he went to pour the second cup of Oolong tea for himself he learned just how hot that pot was and spilled the tea in the process.  Jackson and another server immediately appeared to clean up the mess.

Dennis ordered potstickers as an appetizer and asked for and received five different sauces to complement them, including a small vial of red wine vinegar.  Dennis did not know to hold on to the top when pouring the vinegar.  You guessed it, the top came off and red wine vinegar was splattered all down the front of his shirt in a curious polka dot pattern.  This time three servers rushed to our rescue.  Jackson left and promptly returned with a glass of club soda and small cloth so we could attempt to clean up his shirt, to no avail.

Now I am probably one of the pickiest eaters in the country.  I hate all vegetables (except potatoes if you consider that a vegetable), only eat a couple of fruits, and don't like anything spicy.  Even black pepper is too much for my sensitive palate.  You know how they say your taste buds change every seven years?  Well mine are still stuck at age seven!

I ordered the Wor Wonton Soup without any vegetables because Jackson said it wouldn't be a problem and I did receive it sans vegetables.  I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp without the fruit and it also was presented the way I ordered it.

Everything we asked for we promptly received from a smiling Jackson who was not even slightly fazed by my weird ordering style or Dennis' mishaps.  Blossom's management should know what a gem they have in Jackson.  He was efficient, courteous and friendly and Dennis and I will request him the next time we dine there, and I highly recommend you do the same.   By the way, the food was also excellent and deserves this five-star rating.",_ne1sBJmLHxa5bYGAATEqQ,12,12,5,qOBoPkrWpw-2QFmNw-f1jA

3910617,2012-08-13,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"This is my new go-to place for Chinese food. It's always a good sign to see Asians  dining in an Asian restaurant too, which is the case here.

Off to a slow start waiting 5-10 minutes for a waiter or menu but the service was great after that.  I was dining alone and the entrees are big enough for 2 to share, especially if you get appetizers.

I had the hot and sour soup which was great. There are several other apps I wanted to try but it would have been too much food for one person.

FYI they only use white meat chicken (the stringy thin pieces all Chinese restaurants use). 

Be sure to ask the knowledgeable waitress about the dishes. The chicken hot pot says ""spicy with garlic and onions."" The waitress told me it also has basil and mushrooms and when I got it it had much more basil and mushrooms than onions and garlic. They should make the menu more accurate. It was not as spicy as I expected. I would say 3 out of 10 so if you like hot and spicy ask for it extra hot.  The hot pot is a large portion but I was able to finish it on my own. They charge extra for a small side of steamed rice which is annoying.

Overall not many chicken dishes and not too many hot and spicy dishes. Many seafood options and a good number of beef dishes.

I also but down into what I think was a clump of dirt or sand which was gross and the texture and grains lingered a bit, very surprising.

They have loose leaf tea which comes in a  large pot but with no strainer! Do not only do you get bits of tea in your cup but by the 3rd cup the tea is bitter since you can't remove the tea. I would expect much better than this. The tea was good and the pot poured at least 4 or 5 small cups of tea.

I had the Asian sweet mango soup dessert which was refreshing but essentially is a fruit smoothie served with a spoon or the equivalent of melted fruit sorbet. It had a few fruit chunks and was good but I think they could make it more interesting by thickening it or giving it a custard or frozen smoothie texture. They also have French pastry desserts.

Overall very good, closer to 3.5 stars. I will be back to try more apps and beef dishes.",pz1HWfUdT4JPwh7HiynyEA,0,0,4,cbIMiqWwQtww8faPkiSTLQ

I had a ticket to see Zarkana so I went last night and ordered from the early dining menu which is a prix fixe 4 course meal.

I started with the corn egg drop soup.  It was standard fare.  Very tasty and a good starter.  Next came crisp fried beef roll with enoki mushroom and Mandarin brown sauce.  The rolls had a crisp exterior and very good tasting, moist beef inside.  The brown sauce was flavorful.  The main course has a choice option and I went with the beef tenderloin with portabella mushroom.  The beef was coated with black pepper and there was a small amount of black pepper sauce with the meat.  Accompanying the meat were stir fried bok choy and rice.  The meat was so very tender it could almost be cut with a fork only.  For dessert, there were two mochi--red bean and green tea.

Service was superb!  The servers knew I had a 7 PM show.  Since the restaurant opens at 5:30, time is an issue.  The courses were brought out in a timely manner with enough time between so not to feel rushed yet never was I tapping my foot nor looking at my watch.  They know what they're doing!

My server, Kenny, was very polite and pleasant.  The restaurant is quite elegant.  It was relatively quiet with modern music playing at a low, background volume which would be conducive to conversation.

My buddies and I wanted to experience a higher end Chinese restaurant on our trip to Vegas, and the Yelp reviews (for the most part) were favorable. Unfortunately out of the 7 entrees and 2 soups we ordered, all of them looked good in terms of presentation, but ultimately were very disappointing in taste.

My chow mein was particularly very salty, in a MSG type of way. How you tell the difference? Salt makes you very thirsty right away, while MSG will hold off on that thirst until the very end, then you will do anything for water. 

It also concerned me that many of the items were not recommended by the waiter, who said spiciness level of hot pot cannot be adjusted as they come pre-mixed, and e-fu noodles were very soggy. Why are they on the menu then!?

4120425,2015-10-09,1,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"Since we were staying at the Aria for our anniversary and this was our first stay I relied on the concierge to help me plan our trip.  She suggested Blossom for our anniversary dinner and I am very happy I followed her advice.

We had early dinner reservations, we wanted to have our evening free.  We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation.  I was a little concerned with our initial contact to this restaurant.  The hostess at the desk was busy on the phone and pretended we were not standing in front of her.  Not even an acknowledging smile.  When she completed her phone call, there was no apology or acknowledgment of our wait.  She (with tone) asked if she could help.  Hubby told her we had reservations and she looked incredulous.  I looked down at our clothing, is it maybe we were under dressed and this was giving her cause?  But no, we were dressed in business casual and when we entered the restaurant realized even better dressed than most of the clientele.  

En route to our table she did wish us a happy anniversary and told us that they had reserved a special table for us.  No smile though.  We were escorted and seated at a beautiful, romantic booth.  We were set away from everyone but yet had a complete view of the restaurant.  It was perfect.

Once sour face left our table, the service went up 100%  We were greeted by smiling face after smiling face.  The menu had some common Chinese dishes and many we had never seen or heard of before.  We made a decision to not choose our normal and try something new.

Drinks - Hubby went for a traditional Dirty Martini, I went off the menu and asked if they could make me a Lychee Martini, the immediate response was OF COURSE we can.  LOVE the enthusiasm and the excellent martini I ended up with.  We chose the Tempura Fried Ice Fish as our starter. They are small fish that are fried whole (this means heads on people).  Hubby is from Ghana and I am from Greece, we both have similar fish dishes from our prospective countries that we love.  These fish were AMAZING.  They were fresh, light, crispy and very tasty.  We will be going back for this appetizer if nothing else, again and again.

For our main courses (we over ordered) we ordered the Szechuan Shrimp, Spicy Wok-Fried Scallion Veal Cheek (OMG), Fried Chilean Sea Bass and the Yang Chow Fried Rice.

The Veal Cheeks are out of this world delicious and they mean the spicy part.  My mouth definitely felt the aftermath of the spice..  Definitely my favorite dish this night.  The Szechuan Shrimp was delicious and perfectly prepared, it is just the right amount of spice and is in a broth that is excellent over rice.  The fried rice was a little bland for me, but the pork within the rice was delicious.  The least favorite, and we both only took a bite of, was the sea bass.  That one was very disappointing.  Too greasy, very fishy and not too much flavor to it.

The service here is impeccable (with the exception of the hostess) and the romantic setting makes for a wonderful dinner experience.  This is a restaurant that you can come too and have a nice conversation with your meal, and not have to yell over noise to get heard.

Definitely adding this restaurant to our list of places to come back too.",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,3,3,4,3paf5BMSVFllT9Fsgk8jIg

All of this was great and the husband even ate the vegetables!

Main courses were crispy fried sea bass, a delicious prime sirloin, baby bok choy and combination fried rice which was some of the best fried rice I have ever had.

Blossom wasn't busy on a Wednesday evening around 9p, but I'd still recommend making a reservation to ensure your party gets a nice spot.

Service was friendly but a bit bizarre. We inquired about certain items on the menu since dish names are vague & descriptions are short. We specifically asked about the Pan Fried Stuffed Shrimp Moss on Tofu & Pepper.... what is moss? Our waiter gave a really odd reply, saying that the shrimp's set on top of the tofu & 'looks like moss,' hence the name. Hmm. We rolled with it, but when the dish came out, it was obvious that our waiter had never eaten nor served it before. Or perhaps the kitchen gave us a different meal altogether... we'll never know! Either way it was so delicious and overall our favorite order. The cubes of tofu were delicately crispy on the outside but so smooth inside. And surprise!... a little shrimp is waiting for you in the center of each square - so good! Beware of the the shrimp stuffed peppers though - they are so so so SPICY.

The beef of the Mongolian Beef was quality and tender, but the sauce was a little too sweet for our liking. The Spicy Indian-Style Fried Rice wasn't really spicy at all and the plate presentation was lacking.

My partner and I were celebrating our 3.5 year anniversary, so we wanted to splurge and find a place with good eats. Everyone had something positive to say here and so we decided to check it out. We made a last minute reservation and thus, seating and dining was quite effortless from there. 

This restaurant business is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of drunks and gamblers (aka away from the slot machines and card tables). You'll know you're going the right way when you see the golden statue/fountain right out front.

We were a little hesitant to get Chinese food in Vegas, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the meals at the ARIA so we decided this place had to be just as good. And we were RIGHT.

Our meal consisted of:
- the Walnut Prawns
- the Beef Chow Fun
- Stuffed Crabcakes/Meatballs (I think)
- a vegetable dish

It's been awhile since I was there so it's kind of hard for me to remember all of the details. But the Walnut Praws were my favorite part of the dinner. They were so large and succulent, my tastebuds were watering. The Crabcakes/Meatballs were very thick, but the sweet and sour sauce they added made it a lot easier to eat, and enjoyable too.

The hostess and our waiter were all excellent. They provided us with water all the time, asked us if we were okay or if we needed anything else, and so kindly wrapped our leftovers so we could take it back to the hotel room.

I'd definitely recommend this place if you want upscale Chinese food. The pricing of each dish here is rather on the more expensive side of Chinese cuisine. Expect to pay between $20-30 for each entree you decide to get. Sharing it family style makes it a lot more manageable and tastier too!

I made note of our special occasion and it was mentioned by the host right when we were seated. We were given a beautiful big booth facing out towards the rest of the restaurant. The waitress came right away to get drink orders and hand over the menu. 

We decided to order a few things so we could share them, however we did not expect the portions to be so huge! We order the bbq duck, beef (forgot the name), and garlic prawn fried rice. The speed that the food came was so impressive! Literally within 10 minutes even though the restaurant was some-what busy. 

Everything tasted so delicious. I don't eat anything spicy which is why we chose out these dishes. The seasonings were all fantastic! The beef was way better than I expected and same with the fried rice. We had to ask for to-go containers as we had more than half the food left over.

After the meal we were too full for dessert so we asked for the bill. However our sweet waitress knew of the special occasion and presented us with some mochi ice cream as well as a cute little gift box! What a fantastic way to end an already great experience!

5095010,2016-06-14,20,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"When good luck brings great fortunes then feeding that luck feeds the fortune.  So explains my Macao poker / gambling bud.  Fortune cookie aside, the philosophy makes for incredible meals.

VERY IMPORTANT:  The use of fresh, high quality ingredients, expertly prepared, great ambiance and service, and the ever present Chinese fortune building philosophy results in a luxurious meal at high prices.  Expect dinner for two to top $500.

Tip: Ask for the Luxury menu (features shark fin, birds nest, and abalone dishes) and the ""secret"" menu of chef's specialties (extremely authentic and rewarding dishes).

Tip:  Try the prefix meal with wine pairing if it's your first visit.  Good selection of more familiar dishes.  The pairing of Chinese food with Western wines is eye opening.

From the regular menu, do not pass on the foie.  Brushed with  a black pepper sauce then flashed fried.  The powerful black pepper sauce adds a punch that brings out the natural sweetness of the foie while the earthy grip keeps the richness in check.  Impressive.

The giant clam (geoduck) is outstanding.  OK it's $200 but try it and you'll understand why the Chinese are crazy for this candy of the sea.  Prepared two ways, the foot, makes for incredible sashimi.  Sweet, toothsome, clean oceanic finish.  The mantel is fried with a delicate crispness and aggressive seasoning.  Still tender but with a more pronounced oceanic finish and heightened sweetness.  

Santa Barbara spot prawns in salted pepper is outstanding.  Just cooked through.  Incredible texture and sweetness.  The head fat, creamy goodness.  The same, simply steamed with a sweetened with garlic, outstanding.  Pungent yet oh so juicy.  The head fat, suckably delicious liquid crack.  

The Dungeness and  Australian crystal crab (aka Snow Crab) are both excellent.  The first benefits from a stronger black bean sauce, while the second's sweetness and delicacy is heightened by the ginger and scallion sauce. 

The only faux pas, the Peking duck.  Carved table side. Beautifully presented but not true Peking duck.  More like carved duck breast served in bun or on lettuce.  Juicy and delicious for sure but not the ethereal, crispy skin only that practically melts on the tongue.  

Finally, from the special menu, the bird nest soup is incredible.  High quality nest, the filaments are nearly white and translucent.  The texture and flavor are unique.  Not unpleasant but very different.  Something that must be experienced.  

Service is excellent.

Good wine list but more impressive is the amazing pairing possibilities.  Definitely use the sommelier.  Pairings with this food far surpass the usual Riesling.

A worthy choice for anyone wanting to experience great Chinese cuisine.  Who knows, It may just bring you good luck and great fortune.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,33,27,5,9puW-E7-xSlhHeN9FTsgWg

5210248,2009-12-29,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"Blossom is the Chinese restaurant located inside Aria, in City Center.  We stayed at Aria on opening weekend, and ate at Blossom that Sat.  

I love Chinese food, and I'm always looking for the next great place here in Las Vegas.  So far my favorite is Red 8 at the Wynn.  But I had high hopes for Blossom.  

Blossom's interior is nice, but a little busy.  It fits in well with the rest of Aria.  We were seated right away.  The tables are fairly close together, and if it was really busy, it could have been a bit cramped.  But we didn't have that problem.  

Our waiter arrived to the table quickly and had our drinks ready within 3 minutes of arriving.  The menu at Blossom is simple and pricey, with some entrées at $300+.  

One item that popped out at me was the ""live fish"".  I'm hoping this just means fresh fish, not an actual live fish, like the disgusting YouTube video.  I thought about asking, but it's so odd that I thought it might be offensive.  

Everything we had was really good, but I wouldn't say it was good enough to justify the price.  Red 8 is significantly less expensive, and is far better quality food, in my opinion.  I would say that Blossom is more on par with Shanghai Lilly in Mandalay Bay, except at 3X the price.  

I would have rated the place at 3 stars, but something happened that made me add a star for service.  As we were being seated, we were offered drinks.  My girlfriend just asked for a Diet Coke.  I asked her is she wouldn't prefer having a drink to celebrate the fact that this is her birthday dinner.  (she was turning 30, and I thought that would require a drink)  She said no, and we had our dinner.  After dinner the waiter brought over a beautiful, and exotic looking tower of deserts for my girlfriend's birthday.  This was unsolicited, and beyond the call of duty for our server.  The entire staff of Blossom and Aria were top notch, and made everything very pleasant.  

So in summary, not the best Chinese in Las Vegas, especially for the price.  But if you're staying at Aria, and you appreciate good service, Blossom is a good bet.",JOR6G--IM6p9ltgyU25gWg,4,2,4,ixoXkHdeQYjRkFOPiB05sQ

Having spent the vast majority of my life in Ohio and thus isolated from most Asian cultures save for during my travels I'm embarrassed to say that prior to relocating to Las Vegas I'd never truly realized the grandeur of the Chinese New Year, a fete celebrated by nearly 20% of the world's 6.5 billion people, but vowing to remedy this situation through both a literature search and at least a couple meals commemorating the Year of the Horse it was with good fortune that I found a friend happy to join me at Aria's highly praised Blossom on Saturday night.  Seemingly a cuisine underappreciated by many Americans, or at least most frequently enjoyed 'on the cheap,' yet one whose bold flavors I'd previously seen brought to new light by exemplary ingredients in both Toronto and New York it was just after 7:30pm when my friend and I arrived for dinner and seated at a plush two-top given full vantage of the room's center dining area it was with stellar service from a team of at least a half dozen that the night progressed; a cocktail, quartet of savories, and a single dessert plus complimentary cookies served in three courses with every plate stunning in quality, quantity, and presentation.  Starting off with a duo of creamy true/goose foie gras with pronounced sapor balanced by light pepper and seared caramelization served alongside four ""medallions"" melding concepts of Crab Rangoon and Shrimp Toast it would be difficult to name another spot in the States to find a better version of either, yet progressing to the 'main course' it was soon that round one disappeared to the ages as Chef Chi Kwun Choi's farm raised Peking Duck arrived tableside to be deftly carved and plated by a veteran service team claiming to have performed the ritual ""at least two thousand times,"" the crisp and meaty skin placed delicately on bao and in pancakes with crisp vegetable and aromatic hoisin before the rest of the bird was taken to the kitchen to be disarticulated, deboned, and presented hot, supple, and ever so rich.  Rounded out with large, lightly fried prawns and candied walnuts topped with delicately honeyed mayo over chilled winter melons and finally six small dumplings filled with silky Kahlua cream plus a duo of gifts for the table it would be easy for me to say Blossom was the best Chinese restaurant I've experienced to date but taking it one step further I'd place it amongst my ten best meals in Las Vegas; food, room, and service rivaling some of the French, Spanish, and Italian Masters at a slightly more favorable price point.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,5,IpgHQj0JGAcddxC6au4-NQ

The ambience itself was great: intimate lighting without being too dark, clean and shiny surfaces, cool but not chilly temperatures, great view of the restaurant from any location. Service was modeled after the classical french restaurants in their golden age of haute cuisine.

I was expecting a plate of duck with the appropriate side dishes to come out, but what I got was much more impressive. A whole roasted duck with everything except the guts, feet and feathers was carted out on a huge trolley accompanied by 3 men. While I waited, they carved out the breast meat in front of me and assembled my ""sandwiches"" with the pancakes and spring onions. All I had to do was pick up the food and eat while they did all the work for me.

After the breast was gone, they carted it back in and chopped up the rest of the duck so I could eat the legs.

The atmosphere is modern and beautifully lit. We were sat in a rather luxurious feeling booth overlooking a section of tables. There is a feeling of grandeur with the super tall ceilings and large round pillars.

The service was absolutely incredible. The wait staff were friendly and personable with a knowledge of the menu that left a feeling of authenticity towards the cuisine. My water glass was never empty. As a heavy water drinker, this was appreciated. They were simply on top of it.

The food was impressive. As a fan of oriental cuisine I was not expecting to wander into a resort restaurant and receive such amazing flavor. The recommended wonton soup is subsequently now my favorite version of this classic dish. We ordered a variety of dishes for the table and were satisfied with them all.

The crème brûlée for dessert was a surprise. It is actually chocolate that when the topping is poured over makes the dome artfully dissolve (very neat experience!).

Bottomline: Certainly recommend Blossom for an elevated dining experience.",HxK7u2fIB6dNC_2E6X6UPQ,5,2,4,HGsqM9wCY4_MkJmE-SN-ng

There's something here for all tastes and price points - for around $100, we had two entrees, two appetizers, and one amazing mojito. There are some more authentically Chinese dishes, but as fans of American Chinese takeout, it was fun to try the premium versions of our favorite lazy weeknight dishes. The walnut shrimp is out if this world - delicious fried shrimp on a bed of melon and candied walnuts, with mayo drizzled over. Sounds weird, but comes together beautifully. The shiitake mushroom appetizer was surprisingly tasty, but was swiftly overshadowed by the aforementioned pork. The kung pao chicken was perfection. I can't wait to come back and try the Peking duck - the table next to us ordered it and it smelled incredible.

The decor is lovely and the space is well-arranged. The service is without fault - attentive but unobtrusive, no waiting for refills or plates to be cleared. Fantastic meal!",eZ0WO0H_1CaD4kUeR0Y2TQ,0,0,5,CE4YY7lMP8-22XBJ9ewDdQ

I was fortunate to be able to dine at Blossom many times during my stay at Aria, all of which were complimentary. Though I did notice that food could be on the pricey end, it's totally worth it! Their food is as authentic as it could get and I enjoyed it! The servers were very attentive and the decor of the place is amazing.

- Hot and sour soup was very tasty and just right.
- Won ton soup was also delicious! 
- We ordered both the maine lobster and dungeness crab, steamed with scallion broth. Of the two, I like the dungeness crab better!
- Peking duck was superb with the buns!
- Chow mein and vegetable fried rice were also very delicious. I prefer the chow mein though.
- Kung pao chicken has just the right flavors.
- Beef broccoli is something you can't go wrong with.

Walked in on a Monday early evening with the baby and husband . The prior day we had checked with the hostess ( a different one... The nice one ) if it would be okay to bring our baby . She had assured us it's ok as long we take care of her if she gets cranky (very reasonable and fair). We had also what time slot is the slowest for them. The Monday hostess gave us a look when she saw our baby. The restaurant had a total of 4 tables occupied while we were there included us and another family with a baby. On asking if they had a high chair , the Monday hostess sarcastically replied we need to sit down before someone can bring it over , which was very off putting. 
Thankfully every other server after her was wonderful . They put us and our lil one at ease.
We had the egg rolls, garlic prawn fried rice and Kung pao chicken. The fried rice was amazing. A lil box with tea bags and pineapple cake accompanied our bill.

5704772,2011-09-02,4,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"This was our first restaurant when we arrived in Aria. We were so hungry we didn't put our bags up to our room. 

Chilies (see pic) = $6.50
Beef Chow Fun = $22
Indian Fried Rice = $18
Large Prawn in Mayo with cashew = $24
Jasmine tea = $5.50/ person

Total $120 for three people

If you go online you'll find their menu but no price. Why? Because they're cool like that. No, it's because they want you to come in based on the restaurant decor and let the premium price of beef chow fun slided. It worked on us, or maybe we were butt hungry and don't want to be walking around looking for food.

All three dishes were really good. The flavoring were spot on. It wasn't too salty or too bland. Surprisingly this has been an issue with some of the restaurants I've visited. ""Sage"" which is considered one of the top restaurants in Aria, their food were way too salty. See Sage review when I get to it.

Skip to recap, this is a funny incident. So we waited for a friend who lives in LV. When he got to our table the first thing he said, aloud was, ""I'm so fucking plaster drunk!"" He sat down take a drink of the tea, ""Fuck this is good. Hey waiter get me a bottle!"" Mind you we never met this guy. Then he waved the waiter over and asked if he can smoked a cigarette, ""No sir, there's no smoking in here."" ""Ok, no problem."" The waiter walked a way and guess what he did. Yeap, he lit a cigarette. A second later a manager ran over asked him to put it out he said, ""Ok, ok"" and pursue to sucking on the cigarette repeatedly until there weren't anymore then he putted it out. Hilarious. 

I left out something. He offered me a cigarette. I don't smoke don't like smoke but I was done with the food and I like humor and I'm curious. So let's see what would happened. So he and I lit a cigarette. That was fun. I'm sure nobody enjoyed that experience except us. What? I didn't say I'm an angel.

Recaps:
Food flavor spot on
Beautiful restaurant decor
Excellent service
Jasmine tea here is the bomb. They probably grab this from heaven. Best jasmine tea I've tasted now that I think about it. 
Pricing is not heaven send, it's -- wait for it... legendary!!! I'm trying to say that it was very expensive. Beef chow fun for $22?! Where I come from Sam Woo bust that out for $3.99 yo! and the tea was free. But then again your in LV can't do apple to apple comparison.
The food were clean and elegant. You can tell the chef/cook got skills. It's not sloppy it's well put together, well timed, well flavors. Well I noticed these things anyway - yeap I was trained and look where it got me, middle of no where. Sorry off topic. 

I would go back delicious Chinese food. We left a big tip for being an ass. I'm sure we're forgiven. Heck, they even welcome us back tomorrow.",ell8rxpNo6YLS6uPL8bI2A,1,1,3,-IGqEzr0SEvmamQlc_4qmw

Ambiance - Place is dark, has a nice seating and set up and if you sit in the back area table or booths, it is a more romantic feeling than the middle section where there are larger tables for big groups. 

Food - We were so lost! This was actually our first time to a ""Real"" Cantonese food place thingy. One of the ladies working there was kind enough to take a few minutes and go over the menu and point out favorites and ask about our tastes and after a few questions we made our order!  We chose to share two entrees, an appetizer and a fried rice. The portions were HUGE! Since we had never been here, we assumed fancy place, tiny portions, which is why we ordered so much, but next time, one entree would be more than enough for two people with a side of their awesome rice. 

BBQ Pork -  This is made by an in house specialty bbq chef and it shows! When I first ordered it, I had the mindset of bbq pork from a normal Chinese take away restaurant, and wow I am glad I was wrong! This was so tender, juicy and just a little bit of the bbq sauce. It was perfection! No fat on the meat and none of that weird taste, I could barely tell it was pork. 

Garlic Prawn Fried rice - Holy Prawn batman! These things were HUGE. I thought it would be a small portion of rice, but it came in this enormous bowl with at least 10 HUGE shrimp .. did I mention they were huge? More than enough for two people to share! 

Chilean Sea bass -  This was so good, it was just ridiculous at this point. The outside was crispy and crunchy, perfection and the inside was juicy and melt in your mouth delicious. I wondered how on earth they were able to keep the inside So wet while the outside was crispy, but who cares, my taste buds didnt ask just questions, they just enjoyed. 

Kung Pao shrimp - Not your favorite take aways kung pao, but like a billion times better. The shrimp were huge again, juicy succulent awesome shrimp. You know the shrimp you see on television commercials that just look so big and awesome but then you get sad little stuff at the actual place? Well these bad boys were the ones from the commercial, but better?!

Egg Rolls (different- they had a noodle inside- you get 4)
Garlic Shrimp Fried Rice (JUMBO shrimp)
Jian Bo Beef (go for it, blows Mongolian away)

5745413,2015-06-25,0,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"There is a final scene in Ratatouille when Anton Ego bites into a rustic peasant dish of ratatouille and drops his pen, amazed by the haunting replication of his mother's country cooking.  That would be me eating hom yu ji yuk bang at Blossom. 

For the uninitiated, this is a rustic peasant Chinese dish of ground pork cake with salted fish.  It is an easy dish to make, but a difficult dish to make well.  The smell of this dish is akin to an Asian smelling blue cheese for the first time.  My wife smiled at me slyly anticipating some anguished white nose whiffs as the dish travels through the restaurant.  Who would ever order that here, she asked, how fresh can the salted fish be? When I bit into the dish, I slowly dropped my chopsticks to mimic Anton Ego.  This shit is good--the salted fish was tender, flaky,  and flavorful and the ground pork had a sweet salty taste that has the addictive allure of high quality spam--and I don't mean that in a bad way!

The walnut shrimp was almost perfect--it was just slightly overdone as the shrimp was not at its peak juicy, but the batter was light, the shrimp was jumbo, and the mayo was light.  It was served on a bed of cantaloupe and honeydew.  The dish had terrific textures of crunchy, slippery, hot and cold.  The lil guy's chicken soup had a clean sweetish broth taste that came from long-simmering chicken.

The only disappointment was with the stir-fried filet mignon.  The sauce was flavorful and peppery, but the texture was off.  It tasted a little like it had been in the freezer a little too long; the beef had a slightly mushy, dryish feel to it that did not seem right.  This was a surprise for us because it is precisely the kind of dish that would be popular here with non-Chinese, so the beef should be fresh due to turnover.  There was no wok hei(flavor that comes from the wok) in this dish.

The service was unparalleled.  I don't think I've had better service in a Chinese restaurant.  When they brought the sweet and sour soup for the lil guy, the waitress caught his crinkled expression and offered immediately to replace the spicy soup with something else.  When the lil guy expressed a wish for noodles in his chicken soup, the kitchen quietly made an off-menu dish for him.  When we had the hom yu boxed, the server offered another bowl of rice, as he knew this salty protein required a balancing carb.  Service was efficient, unintrusive, and friendly.  About half the customers were Asian, with Cantonese being spoken pretty freely.  

Prices are high, ranging in the 20s to 40s, with rarer dishes upwards of $100-300, but still extremely reasonable compared to other such restaurants:  a dinner at Jean Georges or Bardot next door is easily twice the price.  It takes a particular skill to cook good Chinese food that is different from say putting a seasoned steak in a broiler.  Decor was beautifully tasteful.  I will definitely return to try other dishes, but the hom yu will be a staple for me at this restaurant!",1wEGvdhBdxaoTC7PKHdzYQ,2,0,5,NvROZRhKI7IEzu1_6Vj6DQ
5768849,2014-01-30,1,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"The concierge at the Aria recommended this place to me and my buddy. I was almost certain he was just pushing one of their restaurants, but I'm glad I did not give into my paranoia as this was the best Chinese meal I have had in my life. As someone who has eaten a lot of Chinese food (across the entire spectrum of qualities), I can confidently say this.

Atmosphere: phenomenal

Service: also phenomenal - our waitress was extremely helpful in helping us order, it was as if she was as determined to pick exactly the right items as us. She recommended exactly the right amount of food and despite the numerous land mines on the menu (which I define as exceptionally expensive items inconspicuously hidden amongst normal priced items), she focused solely on what was relatively normally priced.

Cocktails: These were very good. Not mind blowing but in the top 20% of restaurant cocktails I've had.

Food: Most important item hit it out of the park. Despite eating a lot of it, I did not feel sick whatsoever afterwords. Most items were very common orders at a Chinese restaurant but very clean and high quality. I split with my friend the pork appetizer, pork dumplings, kung pao chicken, and some side I can't remember.

5838054,2011-07-08,1,5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ,"Blossom is a gorgeous restaurant, with a Chinese modern decor featuring black lacquered tables, very comfortable booths with long and plush rose-hued cushions that provide great back support, and green and orange accents on the seats of small carved Chinese throne chairs and hanging table lamps that look like bottomless bird cages. Flowers and candles at the entrance, and additional flowers on dining table tops as well as some dishes, along with soothing music, just added to the relaxing ambiance. My party of four remained dining in this leisurely comfort for a solid 2-3/4 hours. This long sojourn at the restaurant also helped us amortize the high prices for food items over a longer period of time, which, based on other Yelp reviews, we knew we would face going in. And, yes, the superior quality of the cuisine and service was worth the cost. 

We opened with an order of 5 nicely-sized pan-fried Pot Stickers Our server called them medium, but they looked large to me. The outer dough was perfectly cooked as a Pot Sticker can be. But the pork on the inside was unusually dense, and almost devoid of any vegetables, which was just a bit off-putting to me. But I made do dressing up the Pot Stickers with a large array of sauces, oil, and other accessories that I had requested. Everything I asked for I received: besides regular soy sauce a thin soy-based sauce, a thick Hoisin-based sauce, XO sauce, a rich and plum-colored Sweet & Sour sauce, Chinese Chili Oil, and matchsticks of fresh ginger. Fashioning varying combinations was fun before inserting large bites in my mouth. But what was even more enjoyable was savoring the very fine, well-assembled Lettuce Wraps that were topped by wonderfully tasty, small boiled shrimps, several of which cascaded down the front of my dress shirt before I noticed. I hardly cared, for the shrimps were bathed in a light and delicate glistening dressing, which washed right off with water. I only regretted that a few tasty crustaceans had eluded me. 

Next was a small bowl of Hot & Sour Soup. Spicy and delicious! As was my tablemates' Wor Won Ton Soup that I sampled, which  featured a delicate clear broth, large scallop, one giant shrimp, an interesting to behold clear and flexible bundle of glass noodles, and two beautiful filled won tons. 

For entrees we enjoyed tender, medium-rare pan-fried Beef Tenderloin with Chinese Black Mushrooms in a light brown sauce, which was modified to our taste from the menu offering of pan-fried Beef Tenderloin with Portobello Mushrooms in a Black Pepper Sauce; Hong Kong Style Chow Mein with large scallops and prawns; large Garlic Prawn Fried Rice, and gigantic Walnut Prawns glazed by mayonnaise, accompanied by slightly sticky Steamed Rice. Everything was delicious, if a little bland. But I had the sauces to give the repast before me a greater kick whenever I so desired. The only problem was that as the night wore on, understandably the warmth of the Tenderloin began to ebb. So, I deliberately sought to gobble up this dish as fast as I could. Pots of addictive, very tasty hot Jasmine Tea that were repeatedly re-poured into ceramic cups and regularly replenished by our servers washed everything down. Portions were large and more than adequate; we took a few leftovers home. 

Not to close such a fine meal too abruptly, we finished the evening gorging on very rich Chocolate Ginger, composed of chocolate-ginger pudding, chocolate mousse, a dark chocolate glaze, a few ground nuts, and a topping of white chocolate orange ice cream supporting a fragile and finely constructed circle of chocolate ribbon, IN ADDITION TO a trio of Mango, Red Bean, and Green Tea Japanese Mochi resting on sleek green leaves accompanied by two half-strawberries and a red carnation. The waitstaff were friendly and as accommodating as I have encountered in any restaurant.  The only error in service delivery that occurred all night was our principal server forgetting to provide separate checks as requested at the time of our initial order, a slight oversight that was promptly remedied.

Our entire party was pleased with the quality of food we got.  We started with the tempura ice fish and the beef roll with enoki mushroom.  Both were spectacular (although how can a pile of little fried fish be anything but?).  Everyone ordered their own entree and didn't really share, but for me, the steamed sea bass on tofu was a great follow up to the heavier appetizers.  The sauce sufficiently allowed the sea bass to shine through.  The fish itself was perfectly flaky.  The tofu added more substance to the dish while not making it heavy.  Can't think of any way to improve this one!  

The service was also impeccable.  We were never waiting for drinks and the waiter was always right there if we had a question or wanted to order something.  Even though he was very attentive, he didn't hover.

To be fair, the taste is fair but for $30 per plate .  The interior design is spectacular and the service is outstanding.  However, expect the food to taste like a much more expensive version of PF Chang.",YQrVTGz8een3Zdbz8z0Vwg,0,0,2,QoRR_6_fi_BGYLSHd7bg5w
