I started with a nice ICED COLD THAI TEA it was delish
Then I enjoyed Basil Noodle, a nice lite flat noodle with fresh basil, onions, chicken, bell peppers and JALAPENO mmmmmmm so delish",-RFQ8i8ENi7B9d9oPHd_wA,0,0,5,DX9plkf3LEwkv5UppYVWDA

1208807,2013-02-25,0,L-q2fn9CDKmWX5c2hXUD5w,"We went here for lunch last week and it was very good. The service was fast and pleasant.
They do have the $5.95 lunch specials, but we ordered off the regular menu. 

We had:
Papaya Salad  $6.95
Pork Larb  $7.95
Pineapple Curry  $7.95
Beef & Black Mushroom $7.95
Tom Yum Noodle Soup $6.95

Plus 3 drinks for only $45 and we were stuffed and had plenty to take home.

We were sharing the papaya salad and the larb so we kept the spice level at a 6. I would have gone a little spicier, but the 2 people with me were afraid to go higher than a 6. One of them thought the spice level was just right the other thought it was just a little too much. 

My Tom Yum was very tasty and loaded with lots of yummy bits.

The Pineapple Curry would probably be great for someone who isn't sure if they like thai food. It was sweet and mild.

Beef & black mushrooms was my least favorite, but the other 2 thought it was great and said they would order it again.",NoONN8dswjSPnPKhtHgPjQ,0,0,4,Vgr7fMKYtwq_c45tqGC2zA

We stumbled upon this little Thai restaurant along Sahara one day... and fell in love! The lunch specials are cheap and delicious, and the staff is amazing. I almost always get the pad Thai or pad see-ew. Never ever disappoints! Each lunch special comes with a side salad and an eggroll too. Their spicy levels are very advanced. Rated from 1-10, I usually have to get a 0. Friends who can handle really spicy stuff can never go higher than a 3-4, so keep that in mind! The basil fried rice is also amazing! We come here once a week now at minimum for our Thai fix. Probably one of the most underrated places I've been too in a while!

We came in sat down the waiter came over took our Oder very friendly we started off  with the chicken satay as a appetizer it was pretty small portion size to me the chicken was ok I had better. For our main course I ordered the Crab noodles in Thai it's called Jad pad poo and my cousin ordered the soup it was actually pretty good would I come here again yes.,hfQUVWKkXIqMaOds9-O0KA,0,0,3,sNk3B9HjWHmsxVw0bIS_SA
2621877,2013-02-11,0,L-q2fn9CDKmWX5c2hXUD5w,"This has been the third set of owners for this location since I've started eating Thai food.  The new owners have been here for a year and half, so I was told by the wait staff.  Has it improved or not?  Neither, really!

I ordered the Catfish Curry and the Crab Rangoon.  The Crab Rangoon was pretty ok.  It had a really thin, crispy pastry exterior that sort of lacked flavor.  At least it wasn't candy-like or overly greasy!  The filling consisted of the standard bit of cream cheese and crab. There wasn't enough crab meat for me to tell if it was imitation or not, but it certainly tasted like it.  The sweet and sour sauce was similar to many Thai restaurants, you know the type.. light and clear and not very sweet.  I like this kind of sweet and sour as a standard.  

The Catfish Red Curry was also just pretty ok.  I asked for a 7/10, and it was more like a 4/10 for me.  Don't be afraid of the spice levels here, they seem to run a little light.  The catfish wasn't breaded or fried, which made feel a little healthier compared to how a lot of Thai restaurants prepare their curry fish dishes.  I did enjoy the light taste of the fish, however the curry was a little bland. While definitely not a sweet red curry, it was nice and creamy.  After digging down under the spice flavor though, there wasn't much there.  I added some fish sauce to liven it up and that helped.  

Curry is a tough dish to judge a Thai restaurant on, and I am sure they have other great dishes here.  Skip the curries though unless you just can't help yourself.  I am betting that some of the more traditional dishes like Thai Beef Soup might be really good here.  The cook takes a lot of pride in her food, so I know there are some gems at this place!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,4,2,3,lC5EVFabJ8lcpVE-93TdDw

We are food snobs and are very picky with what we eat.  The owner was hard working and super friendly.  He seemed to sincerely care about our satisfaction with the food.  He wasn't annoyed either when I asked for stir-fry veggies instead of rice (I'm on a low carb diet).
 
The food was phenomenal.  The Chicken Satay melted in our mouths and was not dry at all.  They had the spiciness down to an art and was accurate to our liking.  Hubby ordered the chili cashew nut and I order the seafood in foil.  The seafood dish had way more seafood than other Thai places I have eaten at!  The picture posted here is AFTER I ate several shrimp.

It's not the most modern or newest restaurant, but the food really is good and they keep the place pretty clean!  Thank you for a great lunch!!!",JDtoZC7RKvX6rA23f52FUw,0,0,5,KxqwCy3r0J5NGQKWMLuGvQ

3091677,2014-01-21,33,L-q2fn9CDKmWX5c2hXUD5w,"I am so disappointed in my recent experience with this thai restaurants. I discovered this place on yelp and noticed the high reviews it had but only 12 people reviewed this place. So I decided to give it the my benefit of the doubt. While service was very nice and attentive it cannot get all it star for just the service. When I enter Baan Mae Toy, my guest and I noticed that it was empty and no one was dining at the restaurant beside us. 

The Thai Style Ice Tea was decent. We ordered the fish cake, pad kee-mao and chicken pad thai.The fish cake cost $7.95 and it came out really greasy. It seem like they just pulled it out of the fryer and served it to the guest. The fish cake itself lacked favor and seem like it needed a dipping sauce. The grease itself was a turn off and we did not finish eating the dish. It was the appetizer so maybe the chief will be on his/her A game during the meal. We ordered the pad kee-mao and chicken pad thai. The pad kee-mao was really nothing to rave about but it was more decent than the tradition pad thai. The Chicken Pad Thai was extremely sour. It might have been the sauce on the overall dish. It left this really bad after taste in your mouth that need water to wash away. This is probably the worst Pad Thai, that I had tried and I was unable to finish my dish. I definitely  will avoid this place in the future and probably go back to Thai Style Noodle House.",9quoE4bUcVKbnqTLCaZNzg,33,28,1,BAAOtT2Zo8JLxnoH-KuDQQ

4386031,2014-08-08,1,L-q2fn9CDKmWX5c2hXUD5w,"I've had Thai food in Thailand, from many places in the SF Bay Area, in LA (especially around ""Thai Town""), various other places around the US, and in Europe... every place is slightly different, every place brings a new angle to a typical or maybe not-so-typical dish.

My favorites are the smaller places owned and operated by family or small business owners in general... off the beaten path sometimes.  This is that sort of place, give or take.

They have some items on their menu that aren't so common and the people working have always been friendly and courteous (and they even put up with my rusty Thai language skills in most cases).  The food was tasty and reminded me of the home-cooked meals I've had many, many times in my travels.

There are other, more popular Thai restaurants in the Vegas area and they are pretty good, but this one remains high on my list of favorites.",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,3,2,5,nX4ADyrvk2oEcXrAxmjzuw

The server motioned for us to take a seat.  There were only 2 other couples dining.  It took a few minutes for the server to bring us our menus and even longer to take our order.

We ordered the Yellow Pork Curry and the Garlic Shrimp.  The carrots and potatoes in the curry were way over cooked.  The flavor of the curry was good and the pork was tender.

The Garlic Shrimp was served on a bed of raw cabbage with a sliced cucumber and shredded carrot garnish.  There were 10 small shrimp with the tails on.  I would order this dish again.

The server actually came by to check on us.  When we were done, I asked for a box for the left over rice.  The server took the rice and boxed and bagged it which was a nice touch.

If we did return, we would come back for the $5.95 lunch special which includes salad and a wonton.",XKo5IT6o-WslzHPT69PRSQ,0,0,3,3AkHxjXqCSlsGYU2ElpNpQ
4484666,2013-01-17,1,L-q2fn9CDKmWX5c2hXUD5w,"First time visit with a restaurant.com certificate, and it was a winner!  Sammy, our waiter, is the son of the owner; her name is Toy, and he explained that Baan Mae Toy means ""House of Mama Toy.""  Sammy was terrific, taking time to explain things on the menu, showing us bottles of wine that were available, and hanging around and chatting all through the meal.  Some people don't like this, but we encourage it; it makes us feel ""part of the family"" and adds to the restaurant experience, since we don't feel like just another face in the place.  We were the only people in the restaurant at 8 p.m., so he had no one else to attend to.

The wine was only $3 a glass; if we were real drinkers, we could have staggered out of there!  The other prices were reasonable, too.  We started with Tom Ka, and the coconut soup was fragrant, with a lot of chicken, and just the right amount of spice.  It helped take the chill out of me, since were were there on the coldest night of the year so far.  Sammy said the thermostat was set to 83 degrees, but something's obviously wrong with their heating system.

We followed that up with Pad See Ew, broad noodles which we got with beef, and a chicken curry dish served with a good-sized portion of rice that made a great leftover meal for me last night.  Both dishes were excellent.

The room is set up with booths surround tables in the middle of the room.  It's spacious, and is nicely decorated with attractive dark coral walls above, and wood below.  Large framed posters of scenes of Thailand grace the walls.

5390812,2012-10-22,1,L-q2fn9CDKmWX5c2hXUD5w,"Was in the area around lunchtime and wanted to try something new.  Whipped out my trusty Yelp iPhone app (tm Yelp) and scrolled through Best Match results until I found Baan Mae Toy.   Even with only 3 reviews, them all being 5 stars made me figure it was worth a shot.   I called them up even without finding a trace of a menu online and asked if they had some sort of Spicy Basil dish with chicken.  This is my measuring stick for Thai restaurants as of late   Not surprisingly they did.   They asked how spicy I wanted 1-10 which pleased me (I don't have time to explain, read further Thai reviews of mine for more), and then I asked if it was available as a lunch special.   It was!   Okay so I'm batting 1000 at this point and decide to order an iced tea to go as well, and hope against hope that they have to-go cups.  Before I hung up I really tried to test my luck and ask if they had brown rice.  Ended up batting .750 after that strikeout.

I arrive about 10 minutes later and was pleased to see my take-out order already bagged up and ready to go.   $8 all in AND the iced tea was handed to me in a standard to-go cup with a straw already in it.   It looked like they had some sort of buffet setup inside, and Ill be honest I don't really know what that was all about because as far as I can tell they do not have a buffet.  Perhaps they have some ready made food for quicker service at lunch?  Or maybe it wasn't even cooked yet.  I didn't investigate.

Upon arriving back at my office I was pleased with the offering when I opened the to go container.  The colors on the basil dish were pleasant, with two heapings of white rice to go with it and a small eggroll included as well.  It looked very similar to what I expect from most other Thai restaurants when I get the same dish.   Unfortunately for my preferences that's where the similarity ended.  I'm a fan of the chicken being ground up as Archi's or Pin Kaow does it, or with sliced cuts of chicken like Prommares provides, but this was almost somewhere in between.  They weren't nicely sliced pieces of chicken, nor were they finely ground up chunks.   Most of it was stringy and sort of clumped together.  Texturally there was also quite a bit of fat which was slightly unsettling to me, and trust me, I love fat.  As far as flavor, it was successful for the most part, though I didn't think the heat on it equaled a true 7/10.  It was more what I expect out of maybe a 5.  The egg roll was fairly average.

I was close to giving it a 2 but the price and extremely friendly service bump it up to a 3 for me.  

At $5.95, it might be the cheapest thai food lunch special I know of.  In this case it seems that old adage of getting what you pay for might apply.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,1,3,Z7A7aEcY_UvnVZ00nQ1zOQ
