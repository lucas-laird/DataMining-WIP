     After paying at the register, we went to the self serve coffee counter to pour our coffee, only to find a little more than 2 cups of burnt coffee left, we asked if we can get some fresh coffee, the same cashier who took our order began to speak in a loud manner in spanish accent: YOU DON GET REFILLS WITH YOUR BREAKFAST SPECIAL, I stated to her thats fine we will pay you more for fresh coffee, we just need fresh coffee with our breakfast, so we ate our breakfast and dumped our burnt coffee could not drink it so it would not ruin our breakfast, we both had to go next door after all to starbucks just to get fresh coffee, I even informed the starbucks cashier about our experience next door at empire bagels, she said many of her customers have voiced their complaints about rude service from empire bagels, obviously they dont care about my repeat business.",nd9Zs0viCYCSNxw1wWl9mQ,0,0,1,J1PTjZvCGieme_Jo43NvDg

A woman with a toddler comes out WITH her toddler and says to me ""what did you want"" super rude but i'm in a good mood so i repeat it to her. She makes my bagel and just like anyone else I check my order and what do you know it's wrong. She tells me how you want your bagel it shouldn't be that way... well EXCUSE me. So nicely i tell her how to make it and she takes the old container balls it up really meanly and tosses it hardly into the trash. She makes me a new one and it's still wrong but I don't bother to complain and she charges me $6.42 for a bagel that maybe costs $4.

I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch with my boyfriend. We both really like the food when it's available almost every time I've been here they have been completely out of bagels( you call yourself a bagel shop).  I usually get the Tijuana Hot bagel sandwich on a jalapeño bagel which is really good. They make the food fresh right in front of you (except the bagels) I've had a few of their wraps too which were also good. So the food is great I think, I mean I've never had an issue with that, it is pricey for what you get a bagel sandwich ONLY will cost $7 no drink or side. If you get a meal you're looking at $13 and the portions are small, filling to a 5'1 105lb girl, my boyfriend usually has to get more food to feel full. BUT the environment is pretty gross, the tables are often dirty and sticky the place seems really unkempt, like they aren't really concerned about the appearance of the place at all floors are dirty and overall it just looks...well not super sanitary. Another thing is the service they are nice but not attentive, they get you your food and then they disappear.

BF was underwhelmed by the Brooklyn  Bomber.  On future visits,  we'd  probably both stick to the Fresh Nova lox sandwich instead. We will keep  trying different types of bagels since they're all  pretty average so far, comparable to store bought.

Props for having salads available for the lunch crowd, and smart location next to Starbucks. I   like that they offer flavored spreads, but they're pretty light on actual flavor. As others have said, the bagels here aren't the best  but they don't have much competition.

The bagel is great, but the sausage and hash brown inside is no better than McDonald's IMO.

Like another yelper said, it's hard to find good bagels on the West coast but you have to make do with what you have and this and Brooklyn bagels are my favorite in town. My favorite bagel is an everything bagel and my pet peeve is when bagel places don't put the ""everything"" on both sides of the bagel and they do here! 

My favorite sandwich here is the uptown turkey, fresh sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, alfalfa sprout and scallion cream cheese spread, if you're watching carbs it tastes great on wheat bread but if not, of course an everything bagel then.

2998319,2014-06-17,2,E6VoYfE4YDQueOHYpdyQaQ,"Quick look: Unlike any deli's in the Empire State, the ""Empire Bagel's"" versions were stale, bland and stored in what looked like plastic garbage bags. The sandwiches can best be described as mediocre at best. 

In depth review: Instead of waiting in line at the busy Starbucks next door we decided to get lunch at someplace new and Empire Bagels looked ideal. We are from NY and assumed that a business advertising the ""Empire State"" in it's name would have bagels that tasted like what we used to get back home, sadly we were wrong. Entire place was empty except for one table at 12pm (lunchtime) on a Monday. This should have tipped us off. 

The menu board looked messy as someone has tried to change prices w/ duct tape and paper. A few sandwiches and their ingredients were also changed or covered up. The sign above the drink cooler telling us to ""smile that we are on camera and to be honest and pay for our beverages"" was a nice welcoming touch. Was loud inside the shop as two large industrial fans are blasting overhead. They also nickel and dime you and charge you an additional 50 cents to use a credit or debit card. The sandwiches already cost about $8 - $10 on average, not exactly reasonable when you add in the extra fee. 

The sandwiches are made fresh and they took about 10 minutes before they were ready. So if you are pressed for time you nay want to call ahead. The Asiago Cheese Bagel that was on my California Club was stale and crunchy like a saltine cracker. The avocado slice on the sandwich was turning brown and starting to oxidize (see photo) - thought they were made ""fresh?"" Why serve a customer a brown avocado? The turkey was wet and dripped water from the bottom when I attempted to eat it. My wife also complained that her plain bagel was also stale and tasteless. She also had wet meat on her sandwich and dripped all over when trying to eat. The sandwiches were edible at best and they did give us good sized portions. 

Summary: We were a bit disappointed by our first visit here. Expected so much more for a place called ""Empire Bagel's.""  Most likely will not stop back if we are on this side of town again. 

We are still on the hunt for the perfect bagel in the Las Vegas valley that reminds us of the chewy and tasty bagels we grew up on back home...",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,1,0,2,G7wH5nOOZ8m6hQiFAAY-ew

It has such potential being close to home and considering how much I love bagels. However, my roommate and I went here and the staff was cold at best. They weren't friendly or inviting. The store itself is dingy and not open consistently. They even took the hours off the door so you don't know when they're open and when they close. The bagel was stale and had mountains of cream cheese. I had to scrape some of it off. Also, there's a fee if you use your card and it's under a certain amount which I believe violates the agreement most companies have with Visa and MasterCard. The prices are entirely too expensive for what you're getting too. From my personal experience, I never want to go back. Other people seem to have had good ones though.

Of course you have! But if you're like me, you've probably woke up closer to lunch a few times with that same desire.  Empire's got you taken care of.
They'll turn your hopes for a bagel breakfast into a sandwich more appropriate for the lunch hour.

Sure, they're not the first to offer bagel sandwiches for breakfast and lunch, but they do seem to make them fresher and tastier than some of the others (especially the chains).  They also make regular sandwiches that look pretty darn good but I haven't tried those yet. 

Me and my cousin came in the other day and tried this place out for the first time.  It was a kind of small place, only two employees working, there was no one else eating there but it was around 1:30 so most of the bagel-loving crowd had probably flown south by now I figured.  

The ambience wasn't bad, but it was almost creepy how quiet it was. Empire, if you're listening, get some house music going, or hire some mariachis or something. I don't like to hang out in total silence.  It looked like they started to decorate at one point and then just kinda gave up.. But other than that, there's nothing I can pick on.

The food was actually much better than I expected.  I got the Tijuana Hot bagel sandwich, because I like to party with all things spicy. This did the trick. Tasty little jalapeño bagel, with cream cheese, jalapeños, a fried egg, bacon, and melted cheese.  If you think that sounds delicious it's because you also know how to live.

My cousin got the traditional nova lox bagel sandwich, which was also really tasty. It had a lot more fish on it then I expected with is a plus for sure.

Prices were $7 and $9, with chips and a drink.  A little pricey, but at least it was fresh and delicious so I can't complain too much.

It's messy, employees are sluffing off / chit chatting / cursing, speaking to each other in Spanish and they even left their prescription drugs sitting on a messy table!!! (See photo)

During my order, I discovered that there's no fountain drink dispenser, the chairs are hard and uncomfortable.

There's also no working music and the television was broken (at least when I was there), it takes an unreasonably long time to make a bagel - I was able to go next door to Starbucks, get my drink, and I STILL had to wait a long time for a simple bagel sandwich.

After getting ""The Ultimate"" I was surprised to find that my bagel was cold and barely toasted, while the center was so hot it felt like it was microwaved. Not to mention, that I think the cheese they use is the single slice Kraft cheese that anybody could get from the grocery store.

What this store could use is a good butt whooping or its sure to fail. Fire ALL employees and start over. Hire a store designer and pay them a couple thousand to make customers feel comfortable, and clean out the grease trap or whatever the heck it is that is stinking up your store.

NEVER coming back, unless I decide to buy this bagel shop myself and turn it around.

With that said here is my review:

Staff was very friendly
Prices are ok and fair.
Bagels are good, fresh, a bit tough but that could be cause I was there at 9:45am and their daily stock was almost out or it was a bad batch, so I'll try again another day.
Taste of the bagels was fine not disappointed and no different than the larger chain in the area, but not New York City bagels (the NYC water is the key to the taste when having a NYC bagel)

Also had a sausage egg and cheese on a bagel and the portions were great...

Overall I'd recommend this place to people to give it a try as I will do the same again vs waiting on insane lines at the other chain bagel shop cause it's a ""fad"" and place that dominates the market.

The store appearance is simple and frankly I'm there for the bagels not the ""wow this is a nice place factor""

I find the best bagel / Deli places to eat are always the ones who focus on the food quality and portions vs spending their money on wowing customers with their appearance....

4654823,2015-02-10,10,E6VoYfE4YDQueOHYpdyQaQ,"Eleven miles southwest of New York-New York there is a New York style bagel shop named Empire Bagels at the southwest corner of Fort Apache and Patrick. I was unaware of Empire Bagels up to the time that my Yelp friend Lea checked-in here. I was under the impression that I tried all of Vegas's independent bagel shops. Lea's check-in developed into a mental bookmark that I was going to erase the next time I was in the southwest part of the Valley. 

  Yesterday morning, I erased this mental bookmark at the time that I stopped here on the way to a Summerlin park adventure. The first thing that I noticed from the parking lot is that it is next to Starbuck's. What a clever concept having a bagel shop next to Starbuck's. Customers can pick up a bagel sandwich to bring into Starbuck's and others could bring in a Starbuck's coffee or Frapucino to compliment a bagel. 

  When I walked in, the woman working behind the counter greeted me. She let me take my time ordering off the menu displayed on the wall. I ordered a Nova lox with cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, and numerous toppings for $8.99. At 11 a.m., they were out of a handful of bagels. I was satisfied with a sesame bagel. The sandwich was good (3 stars) at the same time it fell short of the New York bagels (5 stars) that I vividly remember. The sandwich included a can of a Coke Beverage and bag of chips, which reminds me more of a Jason's Deli that authentic New York Bagel shop. New York bagel shops generally follow the practice of including either potato salad or macaroni salad plus a pickle with the sandwich. In my taste, fresh potato salad or macaroni salad tastes better than a bag of chips. In Las Vegas, the Bagel Cafe follows this practice. 

   Noticeably missing in Empire Bagels was the scent of fresh baked bagels. The smell of fresh baked bagels is one of the most delicious smells. It is evidence that the bagels are being made fresh and on the premises. In New York, bagel shops are also called bagel bakeries. To be fair, the scent of fresh baked bagels is missing in all of the bagel shops that I have visited then consequently reviewed in Las Vegas. The upshot was that this bagel was missing the softness and warmness of many bagels I have enjoyed up in the Empire State. If a five star New York Bagel shop was at this location, I assume it would be so popular that the Clark County Highway Department would expedite installing a traffic light at Fort Apache and Patrick. 

   I am happy that there is a New York style bagel shop eleven miles southwest of New York-New York. In my heart, I know there are better bagel shops 3,000 miles northeast of New York - New York. In conclusion, I  rate Empire Bagels at a 3 stars equals good.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,15,12,3,uGyfRND1_P8CQCB5ro3aIg

I came here twice, The first time, I really did not enjoy my food and this time, I just went bc the line at starbucks was super long and I needed my morning snack/ tea. The first time I had a plain bagel with egg salad. It was so gross. The egg  salad was green and it was just weird. The bagel wasn't that great. I would have given it a 1 star based on that experience.

This time, I got the sesame bagel with scallion cream cheese and it was not terrible but it still just was not good. The bagel was pretty bland. And I asked for it toasted and it was warm but definitely not toasted!! The schmear tasted like plain cream cheese with like a few scallion pieces in it.

I didn't like how they had like 20 boxes of tea but they did not have any plain black tea or a breakfast tea or just plain lipton. How do you not carry that?! Weird. Also the staff both times were not very welcoming. This morning, I was the only person in the place and they were rushing me!! They had like a bunch of cream cheese choices, I had to read them all before I picked one!! Jeeze!! lol.

Anyways, it's edible and it's the only bagel place close to my work so I may end up here again but I can't say it's anything close to the best bagel I've had.",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,3,0,2,d5VpSxPc85pLWPVkRdOi8w

The second time I went for myself and they were nice and helped us with our order. The food was very good! Something we will recommend next time we're out that way. A great quick breakfast after a long weekend.",JVPQ_HW6ARf0UBTqZDXJEQ,0,0,4,M3hfhPpabZGtA5sCcRAWDA
