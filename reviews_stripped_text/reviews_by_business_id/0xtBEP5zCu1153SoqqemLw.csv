Unfortunately Vegas is littered with the standard ""Roberto's"" style taco joints. In an unassuming spot in the K-Mart shopping mall on Sunset just east of Pecos lies El Panzon Taco y Torta! You want quality food at amazing prices? You want authentic flavors?! This is the place! I had a chille rellenos plate and a carnitas taco and I have to say, this was the best carnitas in the valley! Flavorful, tender with an aroma that draws you in! I was so full when I finished, but managed to down two more tacos before I reluctantly had to leave. The chille rellenos was large, fresh and had such amazing flavor as well! Fresh made tortillas and chips and salsa when you dine in?! Even the toothpicks are top notch!What?! The staff is soooo nice and so eager to please. It's always good when they truly appreciate your business. I live two miles away and have no idea why I've never been here before, so much time lost!

143426,2012-10-17,0,0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw,"Sorry, I wanted to like this place.  Very nice owner/server.

First this is a very tiny place.  Someone posted they ordered a marguerita and I cannot imagine this place ever having a liquor license.  Beverages were pretty much in the can or from the soda fountain only.  That was no big deal but we were hoping to go somewhere where you could have a few drinks.

Had Carne Asada tacos (just OK), Tripe tacos (better than the Carne Asada), Carnitas (probably the best choice) and Adobada (the worst).  We were there with no one else in the place.  Salsa is very good but chips are obviously from a bag (no surprise as this is a tiny low volume restaurant).  

We ate our tacos and left wishing we'd tried something else.  Again not bad food but after seeing all the hype here on Yelp, we were very much let down.",7nvtBJv3ZLiop7vzuEw3mw,0,0,2,DhW2xhQaZ95Km0ZYmGwiJA

253227,2014-10-20,0,0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw,"This is hands down my favorite place to get a breakfast burrito since I've moved to Las Vegas in 2004. I'm originally from Los Angeles where all the best Mexican food is made but have been unable to find anything remotely close to it here in Vegas. I've found this place as it's not too far from my office and went there one day. 

I've ordered a chorizo burrito with no cheese (no clue if it has cheese. Just everything I order, I must specify ""no cheese"" because I don't like cheese on anything). It took a while for it to be made but once it came out with a side of hot salsa, it was perfection. It was a nice size and perfect price (I believe it's $4.85... I don't pay too much attention as I usually pay $6 to include a tip).

Since then, I've gotten a copy of their business card and learn if I want a burrito, I call ahead and pick it up 10 minutes after I placed my order so I'm not waiting there too long. After reading the reviews from others, I will try their lunch burrito to see if it's just as good.",OjSxPkFaBuuFvZrRd2b31Q,1,0,5,ibR0Kx3qnOtYHlC7z6v1QQ

1834773,2013-10-23,0,0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw,"This place is just down the street from my work. So today I figured I'd give it a try and I was so excited because it looked legit! So let's do this chronologically:

I start by asking the cashier what is in their tortas aside from your choice of meat. She lists off a few ingredients including: beans, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, avocado, etc. I feel like she said there were more things included in the torta but maybe that was it. Maybe she said salsa? So I order a Torta de Milanesa with everything except tomato. No tomato. And an horchata to drink. I ordered dine-in because I didn't feel like going back to my windowless office to eat. So far so good, and the lady seems nice enough. 

She gives me my horchata immediately and I turn to look for a seat. I had to take the empty chip basket and salsa dishes off my table before sitting because it hadn't been cleaned yet. I see three people come up and place an order after I've taken my seat. I've been sitting there for a while and realize I haven't been brought any chips and salsa - no biggie, I don't need it. 

About 15 minutes go by - I'm still waiting for my food and I just watched two of the people who came in after me get their food and leave. The lady comes to my table and I'm thinking she's bringing my torta - NOPE: chips and salsa. At least the chips were warm. The salsa was tasty but a little weak on the spice level. 

Over 5 minutes go by and I see the 3rd person get their order and walk out. As I'm turning to say something to the lady - she comes out with my torta. It took over 20 minutes just to get my food. I'm thinking - if the food is worth it, I'll just place my order over the phone ahead of time next time. 

The torta de milanesa was decent at best.  First - the ONE specification I made was NO TOMATO. It had FOUR slices of tomato - which is really generous if you happen to like tomato - which I don't. The bread was slightly over-toasted so it had a slight burnt taste; there were NO jalapenos on my torta; and they skimped on the avocado. The least I can say is that it tasted good, but after 20 minutes I expected something MUCH better. 

Needless to say - I'm not in a rush to return to this place. The service was slow and my meal was disappointing. Maybe in a few weeks or months I'll give it a 2nd try - after I've made my rounds at the other local Mexican places.",9j0uWpVWgOcgrJqy6VwUkQ,0,1,2,ue7rQI2r7Q_u-MPZLkZbYw

Everyone likes tacos but you have to admit we all LOVE authentic style street tacos. In Las Vegas or anywhere for that matters most every restaurant is trying to duplicate Mexican street tacos but it is just never the same. 

Our order consisted of...yes you guessed it...TACOS! Carne Asada, Lengua, and Pastor. The tortillas are grilled perfectly as it is slightly brown on the outside. the Asada and Pastor we asked to be grilled extra giving every bite that light crisp texture. Both had a wonderful marination which you can still taste even after the extra grilling. The Lengua was nice and tender and full of flavor. All three were dressed with the traditional onions and cilantro and a splash of lime. If you dine in you will be served with nice warm tortilla chips and 3 various salsas (2 red and 1 green...all equally tasty and spicy). 

Definitely a place worth trying if you haven't already!",75COHfu_drTAx1G9rtZnAA,8,9,4,vVs0kNHf0FhMS3ukQbES1w
2462751,2011-04-11,2,0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw,"From a service standpoint I would have given Tortas Y Tacos El Panzon Five glowing stars. It's clear that this is a family run operation and the two ladies working were fantastic the day my wife and I ate here. I was considering a bean & cheese burrito so they allowed me to test their beans (1 extra star given just for this). 

So let's get to the food itself. After trying the beans (they were very good) I decided to go with a combo plate, Cheese Enchilada's with Rice & Beans while my wife ordered the Bean & Cheese burrito with extra cheese - there can never be enough cheese. 

The first problem we had wasn't with the food, but with our beverage options. They ran out of coke in their fountain drinks. That narrowed the choices down to Diet Coke, Sprite, and Fanta Orange - all wonderful in their own right, just not for me. Minimal damage (but shouldn't you have extra's??). So then came the chips and salsa, which was a nice surprise considering this is a taco shop. The major problem was with the entree's. Portion size was fantastic with my enchilada's. The rice and beans were far above average. The problem was the enchilada's. There is no way that these were fresh. The red sauce looked as though it had been sitting on the tortilla's for quote some time - almost as if they were made days in advance then microwaved warm. I understand most Mexican restaurants pre-make several of their dishes, I take no issue with that. However, when it's completely obvious that these aren't relatively fresh I have a major problem. It's too bad because they actually tasted pretty good, I can only imagine how good they would be if they were fresh...The next issue was with my wife's bean and cheese burrito. The cheese tasted old. Bleh. Not good, very bad. When you have an item with three key components (tortialla, beans, cheese) and one of them is jacked up, it messes up everything. I tasted the cheese, it wasn't good. It's too bad, from a service standpoint this place was pretty good, from a quality standpoint it was pretty bad. **No one got sick, but we both felt pretty bad a few hours after eating here. 

I doubt I'll give Tortas Y Tacos El Panzon a second chance since Pepe's Taco's 7 or 8 minutes down the road.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,1,1,2,zbzAmAJXv6EAJm2XVL1NzA

Got it to go and when I got back to my office about 15 minutes away, I was happy to find it was still hot when I unwrapped it. But then I realized there hadn't been a salsa bar and I forgot to ask for sauce. :(

The first bite revealed that it didn't need sauce at all! Everything was perfectly spiced and delicious. I don't remember stopping to breathe the entire time I was demolishing it...it was THAT good. (I did manage to pause long enough to photograph it though; photo in the gallery.)

3369670,2016-09-11,1,0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw,"This is one of my favorite ""hole in the wall"" Mexican restaurants and conveniently located not too far from me.  

When you dine in, they serve you with 2 types of salsas and chips: the bigger salsa bowl is a mild/medium flavored salsa while the smaller bowl is spicy salsa, which has a great amount of spice to it.  I'm pretty sure that's why they give you a smaller serving bowl incase you can't handle it.  

I've had their chorizo plate that comes with rice and semi-refried beans.  I like their refried beans because it tastes fresh, and it's not 100% mashed, so you'll still be able to see some beans there.  

There are some mexican places where they serve you a load of protein and beans with very little spanish rice.  Well, this place will give you a good amount of spanish rice to go with your plate.

I've been searching for a place to grab some legit tacos without it being a sit-down restaurant or making a drive outside of Henderson for quite sometime. I turned to yelp for my search and they recommended this place. Thanks yelp, I owe you one. 

Upon arrival today, 1/16/13, I thought the place was closed. The inside was dark compared to the Port of Subs and Smoke shop it sits in between. Yet to have eaten, I exited the car with my fingers crossed. The door was unlocked - yes! With no one in sight, not even an employee, i walked up to the counter. (If i had to cook the food myself i would have, i was starving.) Luckily, an employee popped her head from behind the kitchen. She was kind and let me know that all the tacos were a $1.40, even the carne-asada tacos which are usually more expensive at other places i've been. I ordered four (two chicken, one pork, one carne) with everything, to go. 

As I drove home, the delicious scent of the tacos were louder than my sound system. I picked up the bag to get a better whiff. Somehow it escaped me but the tacos were not in a box or container, but on a paper plate wrapped in tin-foil. For some reason, I liked it! It made me feel like i just came from a house party and took someones mothers authentic home-cooked tacos as a parting gift. 

The tacos were STUFFED with meat. So much, that i had to take the second layer of tortilla and make a makeshift additional taco. (Am i the only who does that?) The chicken, was good. The carne-asada, not the best.(probably wouldn't get it again) The pork, the pork literally brought tears to my eyes, the reason why i'm even writing this, is for the pork taco. All praises to the pork taco. 

I have to go back and get more of the pork tacos, maybe even tomorrow - maybe even tonight. When ever i do return, i definitely want to dive more into the menu as well. 

With the price and quality of the meat per taco, I recommend this place. The carne-asada may have been a fluke today and thats the only reason i can't give it a full 5-stars.

Until next time. And if you know of a place (preferably in Henderson) with similar prices and tacos that you think are just as good - let me know.",kcPu4K_ZfI3tr-jrCd5ymA,1,1,4,yQ5YQOh4E53aDxxIjEnjtQ

All three were delicious but my favorite was the chorizo. The pork was a little fatty, I would not order that one again but the steak and chorizo were yummy!

I was first here around a year ago and ordered a fairly safe carne asada torta. I think it was under $5 then, and it's still under $5 now. We had a fairly large group and kinda overwhelmed the small kitchen, so we had to take our entrees to go after eating some chips and salsa while still in the restaurant. The torta was really awesome, although I was disappointed that I had to eat it in a hurry.

Today, I made my own taco sampler with one each of the buche, cabeza, adobada, and carne asada tacos.  $1.40 is a tough price to match, but what's even more important is how great they all tasted!

I started with the buche, which purports to be from a pig's esophagus but ate a lot like some roast pork I've had with great crisped up skin. The crunchiness was different from what I've had before. Next up was carne asada, which was probably my favorite because it was just so packed with savoriness. The adobada was almost as good and carried plenty of sweetness, and it didn't suffer from overcooked meat syndrome even though I had walked into an empty restaurant. Finally, the cabeza was definitely good and wasn't even completely fatty. There was also some solid yet still soft head meat.

For all you people who are currently nuts about tacos over on Tropicana, head on to this strip mall near Sunset and Sandhill and park right next to Port of Subs, and make sure to give yourself enough time. You'll love this place.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,3,1,5,anny0UWwGOUThPKWdTj0aw

Super tasty and delicious, another big point for me is it is a family owned small business so get out and support them.",6S1TOP1RsPt-mwyyhk8XoQ,0,0,5,HPIAFGzhjZ-YLyCgkTdTjg

My husband had the menudos - a tripe soup that is not very common and very few places have it. He loved it! Also, they have the real deal tacos - you can get the usual but also the more rare tongue or trips tacos. 
Overall, we were super impressed with the food, the price, and the ladies. We will definitely be back soon",AY-giXkQLUQYA4tzwhR-JA,0,0,5,vdsFXdGghwlYnPAZAwZJEw

This one is one of the few in Las Vegas that can hold a flame to those true authentic restaurant. Give it a try!!",cc6XcRAXcPkAW9C15VvBmg,3,2,4,-SV_nBt5xCwwj0qN833G8Q

He asked guy how much longer guy said 45 mins for breakfast burrito.  seriously. We asked for refund and went somewhere else. Had to get to work. He did apologize....,UwNjqpz8QuR2_TyPkt2A3g,0,0,4,dze2R8D5FlH_gXgXCmw9XA

Spicy sauces for the chips were hot and delish. Friendly staff and a great spot to chill. I suggested selling the Grilled Corn on the Cob with What I believe to be Queso Fresco on them. Great cost wise and people love them. I recommend this place for those Taco munchies.... you won't be sorry......
Sorry pics next time.",nzISqo80rL0cMgQ3MuFZuQ,0,0,5,gtgGYYkaz8y7dE7ga1EFrQ

5996712,2013-09-16,0,0xtBEP5zCu1153SoqqemLw,"Tacos were great...for what they had available.  

This what was on the menu:  Carne Asada, Carnitas, Adobada, Buche, Cabeza, Lengua, Pollo, Cameron, Suadero.  Great selection, right?  Well, this is what was available:  Asada, Carnitas, Pollo, Cabeza.  So everything I was craving wasn't there.  I opted for 1 each of what they did have and had a decent meal anyway.  Oh yeah, they were also out of fountain sodas (despite the big soda machine staring me in the face) so I was limited to their can options.  

Good food, large menu of false hopes.",s81YWGDJpgdIfsC3rOtiyQ,0,0,2,uBdpzu5lfuf3cmdXxBw8Pw
