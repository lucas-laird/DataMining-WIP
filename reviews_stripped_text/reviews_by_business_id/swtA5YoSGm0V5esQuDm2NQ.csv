We stayed at the Palms this weekend & hit up Social Bar before heading up to our room. Gary was the bartender on both Saturday & Sunday night. He was very friendly, and helpful. My boyfriend asked him for suggestions on a sweet drink for me. He took his time & came up with the best drink I've ever had.. some pomegranate cocktail! It was so good the first night that I had to go back the second night for the same drink!   Thanks Gary!",79fwE0vfe5kSDZTm7Hddsg,0,0,5,ANSIITUIhsuSbcevdTUzSA

We actually had a great service here. We are going to nominate  him as ""The BEST Bartender "" in town. Thank you for everything  tonight and making our experience pleasurable!!  See you next time friends!",wmxcc22cMDaKpkqs8EZDQA,0,0,5,nZBEFF5GwDgw4q76HrlFmg

Now you can sit in a pretentious setting in the middle of the casino floor and order overpriced, not well-made cocktails. Boo. I miss the old center bar. While this updated version is nice in the sense that you can now see the casino floor so you can people watch more, it pretty much lost me in every other way. Poorly made cocktails. Crappy, unfriendly service. Go to the lobby bar over at Palms Place instead.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,3,4,2,UEOFSkZ0dxas95x1YBoqGg

The cocktails here ranged from $14-20 which is probably normal for a hotel bar. Still, at that price, I want my drinks to be excellent, which these were.

3234990,2013-09-23,1,swtA5YoSGm0V5esQuDm2NQ,"Cool lobby bar in Palms.  As I discovered, the theme of this bar is whiskey.  I found that there was a wide disparity in the ability of the bartenders.  A lovely young lady, Veronica, made a fantastic Old Fashioned.  Alas, none of her coworkers could do the same.  The house specialty drinks were good.

All-in-all an above average place to sit and have a cocktail.  Oh, and they don't have those in-counter poker/blackjack machines, which is a bonus for me.

I was staying at Palms, and despite it's shortcomings, this was my go-to bar.

3519449,2015-07-16,3,swtA5YoSGm0V5esQuDm2NQ,"Occupying the spot previously known as Pizza Lounge, Social joins the ranks of restaurants that try, or have tried, to succeed in Tivoli. Walking in during happy hour one day not too long ago and the place was empty, except for a couple seated in a corner of the dining room. We only tried a few dishes, but left somewhat underwhelmed. First the good... the kale salad was amazing. I typically don't like kale and refuse to jump on that bandwagon, but the lemon dressing with olives, almonds, goat cheese and avocado made for some dynamic flavors. The ahi tuna stack was quite the opposite. The orange wedges and mango dominated the flavors, drowning out mediocre quality tuna. The cheese plate needed more variety. All three types of cheeses were of the hard variety and accompanied by crackers, almonds, grapes and honey that seemed like an afterthought. 

The service at the bar was good, but then again the place was almost empty. There are some happy hour drink specials and a handful of food specials that are half off -- the ahi tuna stack, pork sliders, and flatbreads.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,4,3,O7gj2YiddAhvAoEqxYfYGQ

To start, friendly and professional bartender Veronica served us the Social Class and the Devil Went Down to Georgia (more like a bourbon mojito) and later, the very outgoing and equally engaging Martin poured us some nice glasses of chardonnay.  The bar seats were full and the atmosphere was fun, but mostly I liked having an expansive view of everything going on across the casino floor, including a blackjack table next door who were having a fabulous time.

3703785,2013-05-02,2,swtA5YoSGm0V5esQuDm2NQ,"The first day I was at the Palms I checked out Social and ordered a few drinks. The bartender was busy, but I didn't mind waiting. I had a drink coupon for 2-4-1 drinks. So of course I ordered a few drinks! The bartender made my drink how I wanted it was delicious! 

The 2nd day that I was there my experience was horrible! I politely asked the bartender if she can make me a Ciroc berry, a splash of lime rosé, crushed strawberries and a sprite on the side. We had to repeat our drink order 3 times to her! When she made my drink it was disgusting! I couldn't taste any Ciroc berry all I taste was the lime rose! I had to crush my own strawberry. Then I had told her my drink was disgusting and she replied back ""Im sorry my brain is fried"". Okay? So your brain is fried and it caused you to not make my drink correctly? Then you shouldn't be a bartender!!

Anyways. So then she ""fixed"" my drink by pouring a crap load of simple syrup, which made it sweet! So I had to order a shot of Ciroc. I couldn't believe she wanted to charge me full price for the shot of Ciroc. If she hadn't messed up my drink order then it would've been okay. But my bf complained and asked to speak to the manager and she then replied ""I have to charge you something I'm going to charge you $3 for that shot."" While she took my credit card, I see her hand nervously shaking bad. Smh. If I'm ever at Social at the Palms I'll definitely NEVER go to the blonde again!",CNKS9lCDbQVA2F-w3__XIQ,0,0,3,8YmcM43h_BugS0AvWZPcqw
4094682,2013-02-04,0,swtA5YoSGm0V5esQuDm2NQ,"It seems like a long time since I have been to the Palms because everything has been changed or updated. 
This change is the new casino middle bar called Social. It's very open and right in the middle of the casino floor so you can see almost everything that is going on. 

We were just chilling and having a couple of drinks and since it was Sunday night, not that busy. I certainly see the potential the place has to be packed. 

Pricing is normal for Las Vegas bars but it you are a guest (I guess depending on the package) they give you a couple 2 for 1 vouchers.

4294618,2015-05-07,0,swtA5YoSGm0V5esQuDm2NQ,"My wife and I are not big bar-goers.  Or Vegas-goers. We don't even gamble. But we've somehow been to Vegas twice in two months. Social is by far our favorite place to kick back and relax in Vegas. We've stayed at the Palms Place both times so far and LOVED it.  Not only bc the studio suites are amazing, but bc of Social. This bar is so chill, has great roomie booths, phenomenal drinks (the infused  whiskeys are UNreal and my wife's cucumber watermelon gin martini AND espresso martini that Rico made was delicious) but the bartenders are amazing. Rico made an espresso martini at the request of my wife that wasn't even on the menu. He literally walked all the way over to the Coffee Bean to get an espresso to make a legitimate espresso martini (not using the espresso liqueur). It was the best one she's ever had. And... To really top off everything... JC totally MADE our experience each time. He's extremely talented, does his job correctly, he's not all ""Vegas-y"", not douchey... super kind, friendly, not just nice to get tips. We even talked about hiking and places to visit for good hikes. The drinks he made were on point. Pretty sure my wife walked away with a little vegas crush. He's the kinda guy that u think, huh, if I lived here, i'd wanna be his friend. 
We'll be back to the Palms not only for the great and reasonably priced rooms, but because of Social. Great bar. And JC and Rico are phenomenal bartenders.",ctaiv9A-RFtiKyvT4pjuQg,0,1,5,sxyAUxn4QC977VjhK3YhcQ

The female bartenders wear a low cut black bustier as the uniform (thats for those of you who don't like Bourbon) My bartender, Veronica was not fooling around when she mixed my drink.

5022996,2013-07-29,1,swtA5YoSGm0V5esQuDm2NQ,"During the fiancée and my two-night stay at the Palms, we twice ventured into Social, the Palms' newly refurbished casino bar found in the center of the gaming floor.  While many casino bars are pretty unremarkable, Social immediately appealed to us with its focus on whiskeys and a compelling list of whiskey-based cocktails.  Social has a modern look, great sightlines over the gaming floor, and has spared no expense in its upgrade by going as far set its drink menu on iPads.  Based on our two experiences at Social...

The Good:  Social offers a better than average selection of bourbons and ryes and a well-conceived list of cocktails.  The 46 & Barrel, a barrel aged cocktail made with cherry and fig infused Makers Mark 46, Carpano Antica Vermouth, and orange bitters ($14).  It was the best of breed in Socials' lineup.  Oh yeah, the bustier clad bartenders are friendly and attractive.

The Bad:  Bartender training and cocktail execution was wildly inconsistent.  I twice had The Outfit made with Templeton Prohibition rye, Borghetti Espresso Liqueur, and Carpano Antica ($14) and it was made differently both times...most likely it wasn't made, either time, the way it was originally conceived and instructed to the bar staff.

The Ugly:  No scotch to be found on the iPad or printed whiskey list.  Although Social did have some good scotch available (I saw several bottles on the shelf), but for some reason they neglected to list any of it on its printed or iPad version of its otherwise comprehensive list of whiskeys.  So, even if you didn't see a particular scotch you may have wanted to try on the shelf, they may have had it somewhere in the bar...not that you and potentially the bartenders would know, though.  

Social does hold a lot of promise, especially for a casino bar, with its singular focus on whiskey and some great sounding cocktails.  However, it still has some way to go to clean up its inconsistencies in order to become the heart of Palms' social scene.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,1,3,g5BiRQ3WWFBwJSg7KHTXmw

- My buddy and I had the   http://www.OnTheRocksLasVegas.com/ticket-information/  (3 Day Pass) wristband which included some free drinks per night at Social.
- Friendly staff, sometimes service was slow when they got busy (maybe too many people getting free drinks that time frame)
- Their $20 ""Social Misfit"" drink includes a 6-oz ""SOCIAL"" engraved drink flask that you get to keep.
- Cheap bottle service such as $75 for 375-ml Grey Goose (or $65 for 375-ml Ketel One), plus a 20% service charge.
- Since Social is centrally located in the Palms casino pit it's great for people watching.  
- Social is my favorite casino bar overall.  (I also enjoy the Rio's casino bars since as a local with a players card I get 25% off drinks).",0nqshyLgABOSyTfJUTthjQ,2,0,5,TxbD2QDrKXtV25oTVAAYGA

The extensive menu includes some great drinks, and I had a fig infused whiskey served in a snifter with a huge round ice cube. This was a great drink and loved the presentation. I also tried a mojito type whiskey drink which was very refreshing.
