16851,2014-04-05,0,JMwwxARF34aR1aq7hzpiJQ,Stopped by to pick up dinner. Wait time was about 15-20 min but definitely worth the wait. Ordered a couple of pupusas and platanos fritos to go and they were made fresh which is why there was a small wait time. I would recommend calling ahead if planning to pick up an order. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself was really clean. Ended up being a great dinner option and paid less then 15 dollars for 2 people!

Hot tips: get the zucchini AND herb (you can combine pupusa fillings). Bring friends who speak Spanish if possible but do not get offended when they ask your friends what ""La Americana"" wants. Just embrace it. Servers might try to talk you out of things they think you can't handle, like El Salvadoran horchata (nuttier and coarser than its Mexican counterpart). Know thyself.

I'm an octo-lavo vegetarian/pescetarian so I always order the zucchini and cheese pupusas and the beans and cheese. If I'm dining in, I get the Sopa 7 Mares: 7 Seas Soup (delicious with plenty of seas food!). The zucchini pupusas are soooo good. Sometimes it's a hit or miss with flavor, but usually it's juicy and seasoned perfectly. Other times the zucchini has no flavor, so I dust my pupusa breading with garlic salt. Either way it's a MUST TRY!! The bean and cheese is fail-proof and always good! I also order their coffee when I dine in, but it's plain. Nothing too special. 

The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice. Not overly amazing in service, but I've never had a problem.  Its clean with plenty of seating and parking. I recommend this location if in the area for yummy El Salvadoran food. Enjoy!",ka8Pk_MXUXNmPy9kPaO43w,2,0,4,E8rL967jN8sqxN5XaXhScA

I have never had pupusas before, but have been wanting to try them.  I opted for the mixed pupusa, which had beans, cheese and pork.  The filling was seasoned well and came out piping hot.  I enjoyed the coleslaw-like curtido served along side.  Though it didn't have a ton of flavor on its own,  it was a wonderful textural contrast to the filling.  The restaurant was very clean, there was a ""soccer"" game on tv and there were scenic photos on the walls to put me in the mood for some ethnic cuisine.
Really the only down side was some rude and extremely slow service.  There were only two tables when we entered, but they both left and for at least some of our meal, we had the place to ourselves.  However, our server was not very friendly or helpful when I explained I didn't know what pupusas were.  Then, our order took at least 15-20 minutes to arrive.  Once we were done, I tried to get our server's attention to ask for the bill, but that also took far longer than I would expect since I could easily see that the restaurant was not busy.
The pupusas were only $1.75 each, which were quite the good deal since one was actually fine for a light lunch.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,2,1,3,TGLvwdmlc0UqsFsh6WMfwQ

Nice little neighborhood place that is sure to satisfy your pupusa cravings. My husband and I decided to have a laid back Friday night and opted for Las Pupusas for dinner. 
Thankfully I did not experience any of the horrific service mentioned by others. Our waitress was polite and patient with us. The only gripe is that I had to ask for a water refill.
We sampled several of their dishes and some stood out more than others.

Nachos: pretty standard with fresh chips and plentiful toppings. We requested them without onion on top and the request was fulfilled without a problem.
Caramelized Plantains: I realllllly enjoyed these. It was a generous portion of the subtly sweet plantains that were cooked perfectly. They came with a side of sour cream which balanced the flavor of savory and sweet perfectly.
Beef Tongue Plate: A generous portion of perfectly cooked, juicy yet tender beef tongue, accompanied by rice, beans, and greens. This was probably my favorite of the items we ordered.
PUPUSAS: And of course, we made our way to their pupusas opting to try several flavors consisting of cheese, herbs and cheese, pork and cheese, and beans. The cheese was overwhelming and dominating all of the flavors, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The pupusas were some of the better I have had here in Vegas, and fairly priced at $1.95 a pop.

This was a generous quality dinner that left us stuffed without breaking the bank. We will be returning to sample more of their offerings, more specifically their tortas.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,9,9,3,NyL4qrVo1u5KEbN5CduPlw

I spoke to the manager Maria, le dejé saber que no estaba tratando de comer gratis pero que tuvieran cuidado que algo no estaba bien ya sea con el chorizos, chicharron o queso y su respuesta fue que los ingredientes han estado el el refrigerador, yo entiendo pero no cuando están cocinando las pupusas, tienes todos afuera por horas sin un contenedor con hielo para mantenerlos frescos.

The nachos come out first and they are ok. Ground beef, tomatoes, beans and sour cream top them. The nacho chips are homemade so they are warm and have a nice crunch to them. Pupusas come out shortly after. They are hot and delicious and are served with all the accompaniments. In the meantime we need refills and no one is to be found. So we have to walk up to the counter and ask for them. They finally bring out the plantains and I don't mind because they are sweet so it's kind of like dessert. They are cooked perfectly.

The whole Tilapia or Beef tongue are my favorites and the pork chunks and yucca as well as the chicken and cheese Pupusas are my daughters favorites. Be sure to have some Tamarindo and horchata, they are delicious and different from the Mexican versions I have had. The Salvadorian  Regia beer is also pretty good but comes in a large 32oz bottle so be prepared .

When you try these El Salvadorian ""quesadillas"", make sure to top them with the coleslaw and the sweet sauce they serve them with.  They are good on their own, but when you comibine all those flavors and textures, they become REALLY good.

We started off with some of their horchata which is Salvadorean style. That style is not milky cinnamon but had much more of a strong cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate flavor to it. Liked it, but it was perhaps a bit too strongly flavored for me. 

We got two pupusas - bean& cheese and the revueltas (mixed). Theirs was good and served piping hot. Curtido was nice and the chilled slaw with a hot pupusa was a really nice temperature and flavor contrast. I prefered the mixed one as that is what I'm used to eating in LA, the BF preferred the bean&cheese one. 

BF ordered to share a garlic shrimp plate. The shrimp was fresh, cooked right and the seasoning was decent. It came with white rice, beans that were more liquidy/pasty, salad, tortillas (basically unfilled pupusas). 

Service was decent enough. 

I think I would come back here for the pupusas for sure. They're cheap, filling, and done really well here. Definitely, their namesake is solid.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,4,4,yyG4ws2y_GzyDThc_t20Eg

she stood at our table and didn't say anything, she just stared at us. then she asked me if i spoke spanish, which i don't cause i'm Filipino not Latin, I told her no, then gave her my order.  

I wanted 2 papusas and a coke, i said it slow (without being rude) and i even pointed at the picture; again she asked me if i spoke spanish, still no.

we got our order: my bf got his burrito, i got 1 papusa. nothing to drink. as which point i repeated, i wanted 1 coke and 1 more papusa. she smiled and nodded. still, I got nothing. she stared at me from across the room and every time i looked up to see if she was going to bring me a coke, she looked down at the floor. no coke ever came and that 2nd papusa -- forget about it. 

we were one of 3 tables occupied... so it wasn't busy. it wasn't loud, it wasn't anything... there was no excuse for the horrible service.
