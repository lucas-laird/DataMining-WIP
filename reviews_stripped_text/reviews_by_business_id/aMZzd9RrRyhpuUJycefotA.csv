Visited 1/2/17 - visited with my parents (party of 3).  The restaurant was very busy - food took over 30 minutes to arrive, Spanish Omelet was not fully cooked (it used to be delicious) - waitress forgot items - and food came out in sections - not all together.

I wasn't overly impressed with the decor but for a diner I wasn't expecting a lot. I was impressed how quickly we got a table and how fast our drink order was taken and the drinks were on the table.

The server was to our table not long after and was quick to get our order.  There was a minor mix up with who got what omelet but it was an easy fix and we enjoyed our meal there. The food was pretty good diner food,nothing fancy but filled me up. 

What I found impressive was that Norm was there at the diner and he was friendly and made sure we enjoyed our meal. I would highly recommend this diner and plan to go back again.",V_cd8pu8dOYhml8PO7-TpQ,0,0,4,eMcIBBTKUb1B3dFcgo3Vbw

981477,2017-05-05,0,aMZzd9RrRyhpuUJycefotA,"So I happened upon this place as I was driving down Durango, and I thought, "" I want to find a new breakfast place"" and I looked over and saw Norm's Diner and looked it up right away.. I saw that they served breakfast and in  I went!  
I don't read reviews ahead of time because I like to form my own opinions and here's what I found. The place was small and quiet not very cozy feeling. I think the dark wood and the walls give it a bit of an enclosed feeling not open and airy. Perhaps they need some splashes of color to give it a more inviting feeling.  but decor aside..let's talk about food and service. 

I ordered the Greek omelette which was cooked perfectly! There was plenty of feta cheese but it was a little lacking in the spinach and tomato. The hash browns were cooked crispy and they were delicious. One of the most exciting things that will bring me back again was a real cappuccino! And it was only 3 75! 
The service was okay. The server was pleasant, however she never told me her name. And unfortunately it got a bit busy and she never did come to check and see if everything's okay. It wasn't a huge big deal as I was busy eating. But I am a server and I noticed those things. Overall I thought the food was pretty good and the cappuccino with a bonus and I will probably be back again",I0KgYFePUswP09_Auqhu9Q,0,0,3,oc2-xlIPr6oYGB6TlH6zPQ

1145712,2018-03-17,0,aMZzd9RrRyhpuUJycefotA,"So they had a sign outside touting the ""best eggs Benedict."" To which I thought ""challenge accepted."" Annnnnd...they were right! Obviously, food is subjective, but here is what I liked about it: The eggs had just the right firmness, usually places lean to the runny side. The sauce was both delicious, but not drowning the dish, and sogging up the toasted muffins. Which had that desired crunchiness. I like the textural transitions in such dishes just as much as everything else. Coffee was good, and bottomless, and the ambiance had that easy going diner vibe.

1207745,2017-06-04,0,aMZzd9RrRyhpuUJycefotA,"Small, friendly, comfortable place. The pasta sauce was really flavorful. The one negative thing I'd have to say about the meal I will try to spin into a positive. There is no way you are getting salmonella from undercooked chicken in this place. We had 2 chicken dishes, roast chicken and fajitas, and there was no chance the chicken was undercooked. They were cooked to match the dry, desert sand of Las Vegas. The fajita chicken looked as dry as it was. The roast chicken looked deceptively juicy. But it was not. They might want to invest in a meat thermometer so they know when to stop the cooking. If the roast chicken tasted as good as it looked, they'd have a winner for sure. Overall, the positive attitude of the staff makes me think if they get their chicken cooking under control, I'd be a fan and a return customer.",vCdknoWGHT3Fwc3NeGF1hA,1,0,3,BrTAQ5aTdqtzanyZ0jwibg

The staff immediately welcomes you and offers you table. Very friendly staff.  I decided on the Lumber Jack, two sausage patties with two eggs (any way you want it) with two biscuits on top smothered with country gravy.... which is homemade by the way! With a side of hash browns or country potatoes.. I settled for the hash browns. My husband had the super combo breakfast... a stack of pancakes (which were perfect, not too fluffy or too thin), eggs, sausage, bacon and ham. Obviously I had to eat off his plate too... it's just what I do, lol. I have to say the food was delicious. So if you're looking for good food, good service, then this is spot for you.

2332550,2017-06-26,1,aMZzd9RrRyhpuUJycefotA,"After killing an early AM training session had the urge for some recovery breakfast. I always wanted to try Norm's Diner even back when they use to be called Norm's Eggs Cafe. My roommate told me good things about the old place. I never been to the old place just the new one. If the new one is anything like the old one? The one thing that can say is the food pretty good! The inside has little bit of personality for such small restaurant. The special board is something that need check out when you walk in. It immediate off to the right. They have deli case display off to the right that at the time had the fruit plates in and some other things in it. I never went up checked it out. They do have counter area if the place is busy and single party just go right up sit down. 

It was my first time. I was reading yelp reviews and notice constant theme was the eggs benedicts. Plus when they say that they have the best eggs benedicts in Vegas. All righty then need to try that first on the menu. The waitress also mention that they are known for it and one of the dishes she would recommend. It was tough choice. You might think okay just the classic style. They have Spinach/Tomato, Smoked Salmon, Filet of Beef, Crab Cakes, and new one Shrimp and Avocado. Yay you could say they definitely know for it!!! The waitress recommended the Shrimp and Avocado. I went with the smoked salmon. Smoked salmon with poached egg and hollandaise. Yum. The thing with Eggs Benedict for me it ALL about the hollandaise. It the sauce that brings everything together. The hollandaise such easy sauce to mess up in lot of ways. At Norm's they do amazing job. It literally is one of the best Hollandaise sauces had period. The egg yolk not scrambling at all but perfect creamy, velvety, smooth, and has an nice depth of flavor. The smoked salmon was great could have whole plate just by itself, the spinach was cooked on point, and the english muffin was good. The poached egg was an nice soft poach with yolk porn soon make that first break. You put it all together really is one of the better eggs benedicts tasted in life!

The service was five stars. The wait staff is friendly, attentive, and just on it the whole time. 

If in the area and looking for small restaurant/diner for some breakfast/lunch. Norm's Diner is great spot. The Egg Benedicts would highly recommend but the menu has nice diversity outside of normal breakfast/lunch fair. They are also open for dinner now during the week.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,3,2,4,aT_JlrfEG5T5tbYd351xoA

When the waitress did come to the table she told us we would have to wait she had two tables before us. Yea the people that came after us. A different waitress brought us menus, for such a small place the menu had a good variety. She explained they are serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. My husband went to the restroom and that's when our waitress came back to take our order. Who does that you'd think she would have waited until he returned. Our order was finally taken I got a breakfast burrito which according to the menu consisted of eggs, beans and cheese mine had these ingredients plus ham. They should really keep to what's on the menu for various reasons. My husband got the meatloaf sandwich no complaints said it was very good. I really had high hopes for this place we like small quaint places (only 12 tables) that are not chain restaurants. Don't know if I will return.",Bg9EFRB9h1IOecnmX_wMoA,0,0,2,icK0wqadGXTpJR5SLqV4TQ

Not much has changed.  The service is as good as it used to be, the menu items haven't changed, and their prices still remain low.  I recently dined here for brunch and had their Super Breakfast Combo.  This dish included 3 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, slice of ham, a sausage patty, huge serving of hash browns, and a triple stack of their buttermilk pancakes.  The proteins in my meal were all delicious.  Their ham and sausage patty surprised me a lot.  I don't do pork, besides bacon, and found both these items very good. However, I didn't think much of the carbs that came with my meal.  I'm just not a fan of soggy hash browns and rubbery pancakes. At only $9.95, this entire dish is a steal of a price, even if I didn't eat the pancakes. I wasn't a huge fan of their original location and expected way too much from this location.

4260471,2017-07-24,1,aMZzd9RrRyhpuUJycefotA,"Since moving into the neighborhood a few months ago, I've been wanting to check out places near home, and this one was at the top of my list. (We're already Baby Stacks fans, btw.) I checked out the reviews here, read a local article recently, and I also see the $5.00 off coupon every week (*Tues through Sat) in the weekly paper as well. 

We came here for lunch last last weekend, it was packed (the customer base was families and couples). Seating at the bar (seven spots) and the rest inside is composed of tables and chairs, with one spot being a corner bench type (like a breakfast nook). There is seating outside but it's the middle of summer, so noone was dining al fresco. (Noticed a takeout order. By the time we left, there was only one party left here.) Sundays, closes at 3 pm.   

Menu offerings are breakfast (pancakes, omelets, egg benedicts, etc.- we saw them on the TV screen, they looked delicious, and our server said those egg benedicts are probably their best seller, I usually ask about that) lunch specials (loco-moco, beef stew, pot roast, meatloaf, chicken curry (indian), and dinner items. From what I was observing, it looked like everyone was ordering something different. Also offers cereal and fresh coconut (drinking).

Our server was really sweet, and totally understood that the curry dish wasn't the type of curry my hubby liked (we like thai curry), so she kept saying that she wouldn't be upset if he sent it back. Our son got a ham steak, my FIL got a burger, his wife had the pot roast, I had the loco-moco. So, my husband ended up with the loco-moco, too. Everything was delicious. Good portion size, too. Made from scratch. What's not to love? 

I'm so glad that we made it here, because this restaurant is in our area and we know it's yummy. Sometimes we like going to breakfast, but we usually go out for lunch, and it looks like this is a local favorite, too. Although, we go to some chain places, it's nice to know that we have small places like this to visit, as well. I'm sure that we'll be back.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,1,5,RObGkqfyJcgt3XdgrIywGw

5606445,2017-07-28,0,aMZzd9RrRyhpuUJycefotA,We found Norm's on yelp after walking out of the Dirty Fork.  Breakfast was delicious and the price point was great too. The service exceptional from the moment we entered. Definitely a new brunch location for us.  I had Eggs Benedict and my husband the lumberjack with extra gravy.,OSYHFDUnjbLqTCd7kw9RZA,0,0,5,5tPBGQNG21GzmVK6Pb4COw

The home fries are great too. The Canadian bacon is an excellent complement to the dish. Juevos Rancheros tasted phenomenal as well. Our daughter (very picky) approved of the pancakes. And for the cherry on top of an already 5 star breakfast, one free refill of thai iced tea!",RfKH2hVBSoaovmW9WwDn2Q,0,0,5,ZjBGrQNTX3ynHJkHLz9z8g

5993622,2018-06-09,0,aMZzd9RrRyhpuUJycefotA,"Food was great but service left something to be desired... I never got my order of Bloody Mary and it was still on my bill when I received it. There were 3 servers working. The male and the shorter female were super sweet. Unfortunately, our server Giovanna was the only one that seemed aloof... she never made eye contact with me. Only spoke to my husband which was weird and to top it all off she didn't bring my drink and still charged me... overall the food was delicious. I had the shrimp Benedict and it was surprisingly fresh. Each English muffin half was topped with 3 perfectly succulent jumbo shrimp, fresh avocado slices, and a masterfully poached creamy egg (SCRUMPTIOUS!) I will definitely return to try the various other menu items that sounded great...",SSeOfQ3gronJEozm-FTMLg,0,0,4,bp72-B8qnIa8G5q9OSOyIw
