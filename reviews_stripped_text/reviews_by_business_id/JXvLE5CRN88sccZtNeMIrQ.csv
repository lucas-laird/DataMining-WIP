It started with a lady working there that kept grunting and yelling about some drama that was going on in that location. When I say grunting, it was loud because I was in the drive thru and she was in the back somewhere and the lady helping me was more interested in her drama than helping me!

So I finally get my carne asada breakfast burrito and it was bland! It was so under seasoned that the water down red chili couldn't help it! Why because the chili was bland and had zero heat or flavor as well! 

So disappointing, that robertos is turning into a fast food chain! What they are today and what they were before are two polar opposite restaurants! You can tell that they have new leadership, just by looking at their cheesy marketing posters and flyers taped all over the place. Roberto's stop trying to be like the other fast food places because they suck and stay true to your brand and produce quality and not fast food!",hWY534z1dIo_67ogS0l5hQ,0,0,2,4_A4a954HlXuoB_CCLgVow

She said that she will put my name in the book for a free burrito and she asked when would I be coming in. I told her I will come call back on my 15 min break and come by and pick it up. I call back an hour and a half later, spoke to another lady who stated that the lady already left and my name is not in the book. She also stated nobody called the store an hour and a half. So now I'm being called a liar. I asked for a manager. she said its just her and the cook and I can talk to the cook if I want. hrmm really?

I recently came here while strapped for cash and being hungry after work.

I got the carne asada burrito for $6 and some change. It had guacamole and pico de gallo in it. As usual per this location, the meat  was seasoned well, and was still pretty tender. I guess I got lucky with a recently cooked batch of meat. The guacamole and pico tasted fresh and had good flavor to it as well. All three ingredients combined made for a good tasting and filling burrito.

Once again, I was given red and green sauce when I only ever ask for green. Whatever, not the end of the world. But pickled onions, carrots,  and jalapenos were put in my bag without having to ask, which was cool.

Plus you can roll up in your pajamas. 
 Food taste and quality is consistent with other Roberto's, to me this had more entertainment value than anything- rolling up to a suspect speaker to order, waiting in car and watching people stumble across adjacent empty dirt lot into the night like walking dead, some shady dealing going on in poorly lit lot behind- just adds to atmosphere.
