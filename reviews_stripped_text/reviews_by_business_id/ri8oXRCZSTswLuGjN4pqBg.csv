When you walk up to order there's about 6 or so covered warmers so your left wondering ""what's underneath"" , I initially ordered a 2 piece combo which came with 1 rib and a boneless skinless chicken breast which was 2 bucks extra? I went ahead and ordered a 3 piece combo which added 1 additional  rib, with all the combinations you get 2 sides ONLY, my sides were greens and believe it Or not 1 piece of Cornbread is considered a side, Every rib joint in this nation offers Cornbread on the house unless you order extra !! I enjoyed the food better when they were in the Parking lot near downtown. I felt the food was Overpriced for what I ordered, I usually never write reviews but I really hope this place gets Better!! By the way wtf is  Sweet Potato Mash?? Instead of traditional Yams?????? Below is what $14 gets you",ADzQa_CNTlUT44hCyiTScA,4,0,1,DgJaF7jvuc0RV09c_LaXzQ

No signs inside, typical printed menu with over half the items not available, and the items that were there didn't look as hoped. Still I got a hot link and chicken-i think? Greens, potato salad and green beans and had to stare down/ask the guy just for some sauce, when you're handing out meat on the dryer side I think you should slap it on there! Food, service and appeal of the place gets a 3. The sauce isn't bad and it's hard to mess up a hot link that's not made by you..... Chicken was overcooked, greens EXTREMELY SALTY while the string beans were FLAVORLESS! Maybe half the salt on the greens and the other half in green beans. And I should've known better than to get potato salad that is made with mayo and not miracle whip.....

I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty bland. The gal was chintzy with the sauce, but it still wasn't fabulous after adding more. 

Hubby got the ribs, they were dry and tough, and also needed more sauce.

Best thing we had were the greens, the macaroni salad and potato salad were both tasteless.

The brisket wasn't cut cross grain which made it tough and stringy. I realize meats are cut in the back to be served up front and cross cut brisket falls apart which would be a problem.

After you snap into it...this nice spicy flavor kicks in just right. The pulled pork is a must with every order, it had an amazing & incredible flavor. The BBQ sauce is right on point as well. The sides were magnificent too!!! I went with mac n cheese & greens. They DID NOT disappoint. Some BBQ spots sometimes feature a just ok mac n cheese, but the TIG mac n cheese is legit!! Certified & bonafide...legit. Same goes for the collard greens. The customer service was great and the staff was very friendly. Parking is good and the prices are excellent.

Okay the ordering is a little different, 1 meat is just that, and 2 meats are like 1 rib and 1 chicken (breast or boneless skinless thigh) and so forth. They are not pricey so if you want more meat just order it. The sides are on the large side, no skipping. On my 2 visits this is how I rate them what I have eaten so far:

Pork Ribs: smokey flavor, great sauce, over all excellent.
Boneless Skinless Chicken Thigh: same as ribs above, except I like skin
Mac & Cheese: OMG, so good, both times wished I ordered more of it
(I'm funny about people mac and cheese and potato salad, this is delicious).
Greens: The Bomb!
Sweet Potato Mash: Super bomb because I love sweets, it's sweet, not super sweet, just sweet!
Peach Cobbler: Super, duber bomb!! Don't leave without it, it seems pricey but it's not considering the large portion they give you.

I'm new to this area, tried 2 other larger bbq places, this one beats them both. I will be back soon!

The rib had a nice flavored rub, however, it was not tender and it had way too much fat. The bbq sauce wasn't too bad. As for the brisket, it lacked quality, flavor and tenderness. I took two bites and that was it. Adding the bbq sauce made no difference. The collard greens tasted on point like how southern collard greens should taste. The sweet potato mash was heavenly sweet and delicious.
My husband also ordered a two piece combo with pulled pork and brisket. He says the pulled pork was ok and the brisket was not tender and you shouldn't have to cut brisket with a knife. He says the mac and cheese was tasteless and the sweet potato mash was too sweet.
Overall, we came for the bbq and it fell short of our expectations. We paid over$30 for both combo adding additional $4 per combo for the brisket. The staff was great and we hope the best for TIG.",Cot0SoWph7dqaEA5VMe8hQ,0,0,2,5L1JTEi-ooN9DGa4gsgzkg

Someone else mentioned some items unavailable but it's called Till it's Gone for a reason. The most famous bbq places in the world serve till they run out for the day. So if you go late expect for them to be low or out of the best stuff! Definitely better than any bbq in the area.,S49fjZlHTqgXohmB6doGBQ,0,0,5,hBDCb64-Q-N52xx0lKPCXQ

I am definitely glad I did the food was fantastic I had the two meat special with two sides, the collard  greens  and the mac and cheese were good though I like mine a little more crispy on top.  The co-owner introduced himself and was very friendly Friday is fish fry Friday and though I didn't order fish he happily gave me a sample and a free beverage certainly a excellent way to get customers coming back especially when the food is very good as well. Going back next Friday for the fish it was exceptional.",hPqmjr3ZwrovjKg0yMNZ7Q,0,0,5,-jk946EAm2x1tfyZS90hHg
4682573,2018-04-28,0,ri8oXRCZSTswLuGjN4pqBg,"Well the mood was barbecue ribs.. Friday at 5ish. Arrive, was immediately told out of ribs out of catfish. I could see if we were here around 9ish, but this was still fairly early.  So at this point we figured we are here, let's try something else. Got the student wing meal ( 5 wings, fries ) then I ordered the 2 piece special. Chicken, brisket with a 4.00 upcharge ( while he was like its 4.00 additional is that ok ) I thought that was odd to inquire with me like that,  but I responded of course,  mac and cheese,  and potato salad. I don't drink sodas at all. They don't have bottle water options or anything other than HI-C fruit punch for ppl who don't drink soda. We sat waited for our food. Several ppl came in were told like us out of ribs and they turned around and walked out. I felt bad for the person who rang us up, as there were a few tables that needed to be cleaned even ours, and he had to come out and bus tables too. He was polite. The atmosphere was ok,  the location convenient, with ample parking. Also if you want to leave a tip, bring cash as their credit card reader doesn't have that option.",Mfmx6DSGOrJjr4jeWmqCuw,0,0,2,eH4YIgSg0VTWfTG5kxiHaA

5037588,2018-05-20,1,ri8oXRCZSTswLuGjN4pqBg,"This is a solid BBQ place.

My wife and I stopped here on the way home from work.  We were craving some good bbq outside of the chain joints and the overpriced casino places, and this was pretty much the perfect atmosphere.  It's got the small ""mom & pop"" feel inside, but newer.  The booths were new and pretty nice, but not built for a hefty guy like myself.  Still it was nice!

The food was pretty freakin' good.  We both had an order of the spare ribs, while I had some brisket and she had some pulled pork.  It was all good; the spare ribs needed no saucy bbq as the marinade and rub was awesome, her pulled pork was delicious too.  THe brisket was a little overcooked, but had all the right flavors.  The bbq had more of the vinegary style going, which I love.

For sides, we had mash sweet potatoes, potato salad, and corn bread muffins.  Both the potatoes were awesome; the mashed sweet potatoes tasted like they had some butter and brown sugar mixed in (but not over done) and the potato salad was perfect done with a little sweet relish running through it.

The only reason I didn't give it five is first, it was our first time dining there, and secondly, they were out of a lot of stuff, and we waited a long time for the muffins.  Again, they were awesome, but we weren't prepared for the wait, which was about 20 minutes AFTER the meal was served.

Definitely would try again though!",FQsbJx12jvFYxzKy6RdPSw,0,2,4,yvwsJ0q71UlHkAOVWyC9zQ

My wife went on about how good the wings were for a solid 10min. My rib had good flavor, as did the chicken thigh, and the thigh was cooked perfectly. The cobbler was quite good. The muffin was a sweet version but tasty. The baked beans had some burnt ends mixed in, a bonus, and were decidedly tangy.

Overall I found it to be good value (the portions are not bad at all, and the thigh was on the large size indeed) and I look forward to going back whenever I don't have my own smoker going.",nVlr8wPShCBOjOE9-SmUOQ,0,0,4,VIx2tRAqdjvqOz0F_PC6Xg

The BBQ sauce is really flavorful its tangy and smoky. Really good sauce. Service is also really nice very friendly and always smiling.
