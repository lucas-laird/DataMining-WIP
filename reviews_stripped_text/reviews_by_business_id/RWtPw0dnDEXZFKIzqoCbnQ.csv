We got the pizzas at exactly midnight and both were white with no browning.  What is up with the pizza places in Vegas.  Is it really that hard to get a browning on pizzas here?  Of course couldn't complain to the restaurant because they were closed.  Was a complete waste of $30.  Never ever again.,T3_Maz72KRLYWY9a1qWYQg,0,0,1,ry-6o9O1eEHydGi8Bhg2eQ

955081,2017-04-27,0,RWtPw0dnDEXZFKIzqoCbnQ,"Okay, it's finally time I review this establishment. I just can't remain quiet any longer. Here goes: Pizza Hut wins my vote hands down!!! I'm a regular with Pizza Hut, ordering from this location at least once a month. And let me just say that each time I've ordered, I've been relatively satisfied. There was a couple of occasions where my order wasn't correct, but what I respect about Pizza Hut is that if and when you bring the issue to their attention, they take care of the customer by either replacing the item(s) or offering a credit. In regards to the latter, I've read reviews of various locations of Pizza Hut where the patron is upset about an error that was made with their order and how they were not offered a refund. But, I'm actually okay with that, as, like I stated above, I frequent Pizza Hut often and know that I can always make use of the credit in the future. In terms of delivery, sometimes there is a long wait (especially during one of their promotions). But, more often than not, delivery reaches my house within the time frame I was quoted. And on that note, I should mention that my daughter ordered delivery from Pizza Hut two weeks ago. It was on a Saturday, so I'm guessing that's why they gave her a 1 hr delivery time. However, her pizza didn't arrive until well past that. BUT...guess what? The next day, my daughter received an email from a manager/owner offering her a free large pizza because of their error. Customer service at it's finest!!!

Today, and the reason why I decided to get my review in, the delivery, the food, the customer service (yes, even though I ordered delivery) were all exceptional. I was quoted delivery between 30-40 minutes, and the food did arrive on time. I ordered two of their large 2-topping pizzas (sausage/pepperoni and pepperoni/pineapple) for $7.99 each, however I requested stuffed crust for one of the pizzas and so that incurred an additional $2 charge. Also, 1 order of cheese stuffed garlic knots for $5.99, 1 order of Cajun fries for $2.50, 1 8-piece  boneless buffalo wings (Only 0.60 cents each on Wednesday's!!!) and lastly 1 8- piece order of the boneless wings in lemon pepper dry rub. 

Everything was perfect. Each item was hot, the presentation was amazing, and it all tasted really fresh. There wasn't a lack of toppings on the pizzas (plenty of sausage, pepperoni, etc) the boneless wings, though some were dipped in their medium heat buffalo sauce, were so crispy, very meaty, decently sized, and moist on the inside. These wings were even crispy long after we received the food!! The Cajun fries too- very flavorful, crispy, hot, and you get a good portion for the price. Then there's the cheese stuffed knots. Those are yummy. The tops are sprinkled with Italian/Parmesan seasoning and the middle, of course, stuffed with cheese. I do wish that they'd put more cheese in the knots, but still they're good and for sure they'll always be a part of my future orders. I must say, one of the things I love about Pizza Hut's food is that all their food tastes just as good as it did when it was delivered, if not better, the next day after reheating. I typically order a large  quantity of food, so there's always leftovers, and my family and I really enjoy these.

Overall, I am just a very satisfied customer, as I usually am with Pizza Hut. The delivery driver's are usually always pleasant, as was the young man that delivered my food today. I have no complaints. Also, I want to add that I placed my order online, and I wanted to make some changes, so I called in to the Desert Inn location to ask if I could do so over the phone. The guy I spoke with was very polite and didn't seem irritated or bothered that I was making a new request to my order. Appreciate this so much because you don't always get employees/managers that are so accommodating and willing to listen and help, without giving the customer a hard time.

Anyways, so yes, Pizza Hut (Desert Inn) is my go-to!!Please don't ever change.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,5,C22kxhY3ssW4ANNf_N8Gtw

It appears to be raw, the consistency of when you bake rolls and take them out of the oven early.  Very doughy and undercooked.  It was also very very greasy for a pepperoni pizza.  Never had a pepperoni pizza this greasy and we only order pepperoni pizza about once a week so what do we, the customer know?  The manager said we were wrong but he would credit our account.

I had to wait  They blamed it on the fact that five other people ordered stuffed crust at the same time I did. Then, when I got home, I realized they forgot the chicken. Worse yet, the pizza wasn't fully cooked and was floppy when I picked it up to eat. I wanted my money back and was happy to return the pizza. The manager said I didn't have to and that I would be reimbursed in about two weeks, which sucks. They apparently send it to you. The people there were very unprofessional. They people in the back cooking were cursing and it was easy to hear them in the front. When I called to ask for the manager, the stupid cashier, who was lazy and complained about being so tired to customers when I was there, screamed the manager's name in the phone. After several weeks, these people did not refund me for their raw pizza. The manager lied & took my info. for nothing.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,0,0,1,mb-hHJ42ghptFwDvXf05hw

The hour that it took to deliver I could've walked to the store and both the microwave pizzas that look like the pizza they delivered. This treat was more like a trick. I always order from this pizza Hut but it looks like I'll be more on team Domino....So after I decided to call and spoke with the manager Douglas. He was great to remake our pizza order and threw in a 2 liter. This was a good recovery from what could've been a horrible pizza experience.

I explained this to her and my last order magically appeared; I repeated the order and she repeated it back just to confirm it was correct. When I came in the order was still incorrect. 

I then explained to another manager, Dylan, that there has been an issue with every order I have had at this location. My first order was lost in delivery, last order came cold and incorrect on the night of the most major fight event in Las Vegas, and now this one.

And why did they need my number? To call and confirm my order. 

HERE'S A TIP, DIPSHIT: If the order is already paid for, and I placed it over the Internet, it's because I don't want to TALK to you slack-jawed Taco-Bell rejects. If I was looking forward to a phone conversation with a pizza place, I'd have called in my order. I would have gotten a GOOD pizza from a local place. I wanted to order over the Internet to AVOID talking to you.

First and last time I will ever go there. 

Went to pick up a pizza that I ordered online. I was a little early and while waiting I noticed a sign on the wall that said if I was not satisfied they would either 1) Make me a new pizza right away or 2) give me a credit right away or 3) refund my money from (owners name,which I don't remember) next to a picture of a smiling owner. 

Evidently, The owner has to be there, in the store to physically give you the money from his pocket.  Completely stupid experience followed. 

The pizza was brought out from the kitchen and it was wrong. I did not want to wait another 20 min so I said ""Just give me my money back and we'll call it a day"". The employee got the manager and I said the same thing and he said he could make me another pizza  or give me a credit for another time but he can't give me my money back. I pointed out the sign and reminded him that he was the manager. This went back and forth way too many times. Now I'm getting annoyed and I told him to phone the owner. He went to office and came back to inform me that he had phoned the district manager who would try to contact the owner and if they phoned back with approval, he could then give me my money. I told him to phone again and get this issue settled, to tell his boss that he has an angry customer that is insisting on his money. He made another phone call then returned with a vendor pay out slip for me to fill out with my name etc and then gave me my money. ridiculous.",uc5SI7_91nonDnujTB7tug,1,0,1,zSj3fxzN8p2jcQGpPALp4g
