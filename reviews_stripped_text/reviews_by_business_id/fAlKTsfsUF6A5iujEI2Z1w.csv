5772,2015-08-13,0,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"Had a dynamite meal at this great place. A couple of us had The M.O.A.B (Rightfully named, Mother of all burgers) The best of the big burgers I've had. I requested med. rare and it couldn't have been done better. The flavour of this burger with melted cheddar, fabulous, the onions mushrooms and bacon all still hot and freshly cooked and fresh toasted biscuit, top notch. The brightly flavoured accompanying  chipotle sauce is excellent as an intermittent addition of flavour. 

My wife asked if it would be possible to order Eggs Benedict which was not on the menu. The chef was happy to oblige and 4 beautifully prepared eggs Benny showed, she was in heaven. The ham and eggs along with the a terrific hollandaise sauce were excellent. The Exec. Chef  stopped by our table to see if everything was to our liking and was surprised to see the eggs Benny were almost gone but by the way my wife was raving about them we all had to try some.

Nice casual area w/ upbeat atmosphere on the main floor and a beautiful comfortable dining room on the 2nd floor. We ate at many places while in Vegas and this one is defiantly a place to go for great food.",vQ0fqKaoq9yU5N1jluwHjg,3,0,5,foOQHE9ySrppRGxf0EgOgg

One of them mentioned to the server that they had mislabeled something on their menu as vegetarian but it is not actually vegetarian.  He was very dismissive of her, and she asked to speak to the manager.  After the manager came over, he argued with her about the definition of vegetarian.  When another member of our group (male) suggested he might just want to thank her for her feedback and move on, he looked at him and said, ""It's okay. I'm married, too.""  Regrettably, we stayed to finish our meal, and our server began clearing our plates and drinks as people were still finishing.

I LOVE calamari. There is little that can be done to calamari that will make me not like it. However, for $15 we received the smallest order of calamari I've ever seen. Ever. And I've seen a LOT of calamari. We're talking roughly a dollar per tube here. And salty. So salty. Second- the service. I'll make it easy. There was none. I can't tell you who our server was, we met about 5 or 6 lovely employees during our dinner. But nobody ever asked how the food was, if we'd like anything else, and the kicker? It took us 30 minutes, that's right, 30, to receive our check after the plates had been cleared. Never again. The only redeeming factor at this place was who seemed to be a busser? He was very friendly and was the only one who seemed to be actually ""working"" so props to him.",V_CTZTVG1qYpGnnOUhf-Ug,0,0,1,5ADkSE_UG2lQvz7JRJT_6w

After ordering, our party sat for over an hour at our table with no food or status update, our server forgot our order and had to ask us again, after complaining and begging for bread they finally brought some. We were told the kitchen staff was fighting with each other and the server had no control over it. We finally had to walk out because we didn't believe they would ever be able to deliver our food. We had three young kids who were passing out at the table. 

The worst was that they just started to avoid eye contact, even hiding behind the bar because they knew things were so bad. On the way out the manager said sorry but nothing else for ruining our night. I couldn't believe that this place actually exists. 

Watch out if they take you the 2nd floor!  To be fair there people on the first floor that never got their food either.",Ejym3kaSUDoALmHIcOiUWQ,4,1,1,uWOsolr2f360UUH27fAHBA

Pros:  Quality ingredients, nice atmosphere
Cons:  Poor service, blah food, & WAY overpriced ($5 iced tea, $15 turkey sandwich w/fries)

The cons are because the server didn't checkup with us throughout our meal.  Consequently, I wasn't able to order an iced tea ($5) until I was nearly finished with my meal and didn't receive it until they were clearing my plates.  He failed to inform us of any specials.  We didn't see them until we were leaving.  Also, when the BF and I ordered sandwiches the server asked if we would like chips or fries.  We each responded fries. Guess what? That's a $2 upcharge for each meal.  That's not a problem to me IF I wanted fries, but I really wasn't in the mood and would have happily done without them.  Being a fellow server, I've seen the tricks for padding a bill.  Shame on you!  As far as the food (turkey sandwich & roasted veggie sandwich) went, it was good but nothing at all special.  We were hoping for some sort of unique sauce, bread, something, but nope.  I feel a more accurate rating would be 1 and a half stars....

I'm still willing to try the original Off the Strip location in Southern Highlands but I'd skip the LINQ location for anything other than a drink at the bar.",l1o0KsRr_uvuLgr1FKL7Eg,0,0,2,_YVvE4xO0KUw5tqzzxrXCQ

Only note - even though this is at The Linq, the restaurant was still too new to take your Total Rewards card to swipe. Our waiter said that that hadn't been set up yet.

We decided upon OTSB after realizing it would be a long wait at Brooklyn Bowl.  We were seated fairly quickly and the hostess was very pleasant and she was just about the only positive on this visit.
We then waited 20 minutes before anyone even GREETED us let alone took a drink order.  Two waitresses argued over whether or not they had our table and finally our drink and food orders were taken at the same time (since we had 20 minutes to review the menu).  
We then waited another 25 minutes before we even got our drink orders.  Meanwhile, I can see the Executive Chef and one of the managers talking non chalantely with no sense of urgency about anything.  
It was another 10 minutes to get our food.  We had a group of seven of us and they brought out two of the dishes.  It was another 10-15 before we got the remaining dishes.   
We spoke with the manager and made our complaints known and to his credit he apologized and comped some of our items.  But the damage had already been done and we were all completely dissatisfied.  
You would think that a restaurant would treat a larger group of patrons with more priority seeing as they can have possibly a larger purchasing outcome.  This was not the case.  It was disorganized and the timing for EVERYTHING suffered greatly.  It's unfortunate that experiences like this can mask other possibly great attributes to the restaurant.  It seemed like a cool place to grab a bite to eat and drink and to be honest, I don't even remember how the food was because of horrible lack of service. Notice I said ""lack of service"". I didn't want to take away from the server because she wasn't horrible.  She just wasn't there.   I can only attribute that to the management and their lack of ability to manage that situation more promptly.

968804,2016-03-01,2,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"My fiance and I wanted a late dinner and decided on Off the Strip. Seemed like a nice enough place, walking in from the casino we had to walk to the other side of the restaurant next to The Linq Promenade to be seated by a hostess, no big deal. It wasn't busy at all and we were seated right away, that was best part of this experience. 

After about 10 minutes a fast talking guy named John, who seemed way busier than he actually was especially for as empty as the restaurant was, finally took our drink order. When he came back with the drinks he took our meal order and that was the last we saw of him for the next 45 minutes to an hour. Well I take that back, we saw him taking care of 3 other parties that came in after us and got their meals before us even though they were bigger parties. Something must have clicked for ol John or maybe it was the ojo I was giving the other people who got their food before us but he finally came and asked us if we had gotten our food. 

Why no John, we haven't received our dinner. Is that not your job to check on our food or maybe sometime in the past hour to see if we needed more to drink, maybe an appetizer since we'd been waiting for our entrees for an hour? 

I told John that I wanted to cancel my order and I'll just pay for my beer so we can go somewhere else to eat. He said that our meal was at the window and he was going to get it if we didn't mind waiting. OK fine, if it's at the window get the damn food. 

Well John comes back with no food but an apology and says if we want to wait that the food would be comped but I would still have to pay for my beer. He says that the reason it took so long was that my fiance ordered the chicken and that it takes 20 minutes to cook, what about the last 40 minutes? 

The manager brings our food about 2 minutes later and says that the food is on the house and apologizes. John shows up about a minute later with the check for my beer and asks if I want a box to go and if I have a yelp (should it matter that I have yelp or not to get at least decent service?)....

Wow....this was our first trip to Vegas and my impression of Off the Strip and The Linq in general has been sub par.

So I checked Yelp (as I always do) for places still open with good reviews and Off the Strip ended up being our choice. I am so so so pleased we chose this place because it was amazing! NeeNee (not sure how she spells it) with her bright personality, quick wit, and attentive service was such a pleasure to have as a waitress. She is an asset to this establishment for sure! She checked in enough to make sure all our needs were met but not too much that we felt like she was hovering. She made small talk with us but her interest felt genuine and not at all forced. She was a sweetheart...pure and simple.

The food. There were so many things we wanted to order from their wide variety menu...it all sounded so good! We finally made our decisions and started with the Sweet Chili & Bacon Prawns. The prawns were bursting with flavor and the perfect start to our meal. Spicy and sweet, the shrimp were not over cooked by any means and the bacon was crispy but not crunchy. I only wish there were more of them per order...lol! 

My husband got the M.O.A.B. Burger and he said it was well balanced, well seasoned, and overall scrumptious! The waffle fries that came with it were easily the best waffle fries either one of us have ever had in our entire life. They were hot and crispy with just enough kick in the seasoning...mmmm so good. I had the 8 oz Filet with homemade Marsala sauce on the side with green beans and mashed potatoes. The steak I ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I didn't need the Marsala sauce as the steak was seasoned to perfection and absolutely divine all by itself. I did use the Marsala sauce on a few pieces though and it was delish with it too! The green beans were perfectly cooked...still had a good ""snap"" to them but not undercooked at all. The mashed potatoes were lumpy (in a good way!) with the yummy skins still in them. I actually poured some of the Marsala sauce into the potatoes as a kind of gravy and WOW! Instantly elevated those potatoes to rock star status! 

From beginning to end our experience at Off the Strip was wonderful and next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be returning and making sure NeeNee takes care of us! Kudos to the kitchen and staff!",F9kMw4GSuUJCFLdqRhlvcw,1,0,5,sKYpJ3soCjEQmgVDrAmKYA

I decided to come back so I made a reservation of 9 about a month in advance for a business dinner. It was very disappointing & embarrassing to get to the resteraunt with the rest of your party & the table you reserved isn't ready. The hostesses genuinely apologized & kindly told us we would get sat as soon as they could get us a table but that is still unexceptable for a party with a reservation. I asked to speak to the manager on duty which was Scott. He then Told us the same thing the hostess did. After about half an hour we get sat at high top tables (high tables with stools that have no back to them) apparently our table wasn't ready because the manager on duty Scott gave our table away to a walk-in. What's the point of making a reservation if your not going to hold the table for us? I even got a phone call the night before to reconfirm the reservation. I just don't understand! We also waited for our food for about 45 minutes. I once again asked to speak to the manager Scott which took him about another 45 to come ask me what's wrong. I felt like he was avoiding us because he felt bad for what he did so far. Besides all that the food was amazing once again, Scott comped us half priced drinks (which was the least he could do) our server Joey was great I know we gave him a lot of drama but we all knew it wasn't his fault that this happened.

Jeff C. & I ordered a Moscow Mule & mine w/ rum instead, which tasted like flavored water.

Came here during the last bit of happy hour to grab a quick bite to eat. Ate at the bar and my bartender, Heather, was fantastic. Super quick and helpful! 

- Ordered the MOAB (mother of all burgers) with well done fries: $19.00, 4/5
Burger was super juicy and flavorful - made with sirloin. It was topped with bacon, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese; ALL THE YAAASSS! Seriously all the toppings I love on my burgers. The bun was whatever, a little dry for me. Also I asked for a side of ranch and was charged $0.75. Say whaaa?! A little annoying but worth it. 

- had a ShutYour Piehole to drink: $7 - HH price; Canadian Whiskey & Pineapple juice. 
UM, YUM! I never would have thought to combine these two and boy am I glad I listened to Heather when I asked for her suggestion. So simple yet so delicious!! I don't drink much and I ordered two before HH wrapped up. Prob not the best idea because I ended up walking around a little tipsy by myself, hahah. But it's Vegas, so no biggie! ;P

No apology at all just that she didn't hear me, therefore she didn't know I wanted one... while I'm grateful that my friends food was taken care of, I'm appalled at the blatant lie the server told and the fact that the manager didn't even seem the slightest bit interested in addressing my concerns. I spent a good chunk of money in their establishment (would have spent more had the appetizer arrived) more than the rest of the orders at our table, and I feel like because I look young my concerns were not address as they should have been.

Walked right in and was seated after roaming around for a few minutes. The place was fairly busy and somewhat packed. A young lady seated up across from the kitchen area and close to the bathrooms which was nice. I was looking to get some breakfast food but was tempted to order lunch instead. After debating about what I wanted I finally made a decision and placed my order. 

While waiting there were two interesting events that happened. First, a loud crash of glass was heard breaking on the floor. That caught most of everyone's attention and their faces all turned towards the kitchen area. I on the other hand was not surprised because servers tend to have to carry a lot of plates and glasses to various tables at a single time. A couple of workers came over to investigate what had occurred and I think they got it straightened out, or so I thought. Roughly, 10 minutes later there was another loud CRASH! This time a young lady came over with a very frustrated look on her face towards the kitchen, she was MAADDDDDDDD! She didn't have to say anything but you could just tell that something was off! 

Back to the food, it was good. It took awhile for the food to come but good. I had a CARNIVORE SKILLET! I believe that was the name of the dish. 

The food was pleasing to me. It was not an extravagant meal but enough to quench my hunger. 

However, the bathroom lock was not secure at all! That could lead to bad things if it is not addressed.

It arrived in an odd pinkish green...not sure how to describe it and was unacceptable. Each drink we had seemed to be different with each order which was a little disappointing. 

Otherwise, here is the rest of my review.

Appropriate level of music and noise in this place. If you've been here, you know what I mean! Great sound system and just enough for ambiance. I was not sure if it was overflow from next door or their own but it was just right. Next door, the music is terribly loud and in your face like my fraternity days! So it was a nice contrast and mind blowing that these guys are neighbors with O'Sheas in your face fraternity house.

This place would have been a solid 3 star overall . . like your average run of the mill standard on the strip rip off Vegas joints but our waiter gave this place lots of character. We noticed that he felt out the guests and turned on the appropriate amount of professionalism or energetic Vegas vibe. He started with a professional greeting and service and when he noticed that we were actually here to party, he turned on the charm and made our night even that much better. He is very interactive with the clientele and brings this place up to another level of personalized service.
John Martinez was our waiter and he was informative, courteous, and attentive. If you wanted something, he would try his best to get it for you and ask. If they could do something more for you he would offer it. I swung by and found the place at 9pm and hung out for a while drinking and with a snack. Of course, we had to come back after midnight and asked to be in his section again to continue the great service with the after hours specials!

1656755,2016-11-06,0,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"Off The Strip is located inside the Linq hotel and casino.  It is open 23/7 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  My bf and I went there this morning for breakfast.  When we arrived, we were told by the hostess that it would be a 10-15 minute wait even though half of the restaurant was empty.  She took down our number in order to contact us when the table for two was ready.

We were waiting around outside in the Linq promenade when I noticed that the bar area of Off The Strip had a whole bunch of open seats.  My bf and I decided to go and sit at the bar to get drinks and food instead of waiting for a table.  

At the bar, a young girl with short blonde/grey hair, blue eyes, black winged eyeliner, and a backwards Pabst baseball cap came by and handed us menus.  She then wiped down the bar counter.  At first, I thought she was awesome, but boy was I wrong!  She then left and was nowhere to be found.  A random dark haired guy came by and was the one who took down our orders.  We ordered the RIP! Sandwich, the Carnivore Skillet, and a Bloody Mary.  10-15 minutes went by and the blonde girl came back and was making drinks for these two parties that had ordered drinks after us.  Umm...  okay?!?  During this time, we still had no waters or utensils at all.  After the other two parties received their drinks, we were waiting to see if maybe she would bring ours next, but it seemed as though she had completely forgotten us.  My bf patiently waited to see if she was going to be making his drink next.  Minutes go by and nope!  My bf kindly reminded her that he had ordered a Bloody Mary.  She had an attitude and was not friendly at all.  We didn't receive any apologies or anything.  Her response was a very annoyed, ""Yeah.""  I would write down her name in my review, but no one had a name tag.  Geez, I wonder why.  With the poor service we received, I think I would hide my name tag too.

When our food came out, I was surprised that the food was pretty good for a bar establishment.  I liked the RIP! Sandwich a lot more than the Carnivore Skillet, but both exceeded my expectations.  The portions were pretty big and filling too.  The RIP! Sandwich consisted of a fresh baguette filled with fried eggs, hickory bacon, smoked ham, smoked cheddar cheese, arugula, drizzled with a lemon thyme dressing all for $16.  The Carnivore Skillet consisted of scrambled eggs packed with red peppers, chicken sausage, smoked ham, hickory bacon, and cheddar cheese served on a skillet for $17.  On the side, you can choose between quinoa or waffle fries.  I chose the quinoa.

When we were done with our food, a gentleman came by and cleared our area.  The blonde girl was seen helping the parties to our left and our right, but did not make any eye contact or ask us how we were doing at all.  It was as though she was purposely ignoring us.  Both of the parties to our sides were done with their food after us, yet she rang them up and took their payments before us while our credit card was left on the bar counter waiting to be rang up.  After she was done ringing up the two parties, she still didn't ring us up.  Once again, no eye contact, nothing.  Once again, my bf was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe she didn't see the credit card lying on the counter for a while now?  Obviously we were done and were ready to go since our area had been cleared for a while now.  Honestly, I have no time for bullshit service so I told my bf to take his credit card back and I was going to pay in cash and leave no tip because she didn't deserve a tip.  However, my bf is way too nice.  We waited even longer just to wave her down to ring us up so we could leave.  Again with the horrible attitude, she was like, ""Yeah?!?""  She even gave a dirty look.  It was like we were bothering her just to pay for our food.  She quickly rang us up and handed my bf the receipt to sign without saying a word.  She didn't thank us for coming, didn't apologize for the ugly ass attitude and poor service.  Nada!  Then she stormed off.  Ooookay!!  I don't know what her problem was, but it is employees like that that are like cancer to businesses.  Someone needs to remind her that it is customers who provide her with a paycheck.  The nice dark haired gentleman who originally took our order was the one who came by and said thanks for coming.

The food was decent and the dark haired gentleman was nice so I'll give the place two stars, but other than that, I would not come back to this place because of the horrible service we received or more like lack of service.

Super convenient spot located in the strip so if you're exploring Vegas this would be a great brunch spot. They have inside and outside seating. I would recommend outside if it's not too hot so you can people watch. 

All the brunch plates we ordered were delicious. No complaints. Great portions and variety. And I'm not a drinker.. but I decided to try the Sangria and I loved it. I believe $30 but serves a lot and definitely worth it! If you don't finish it while eating you can ask for a plastic to go cup and take it with you! Super yummy and fresh tasting!

Bathrooms were nice and clean, always a plus!

Overall service was great, my moms eggs were a little over cooked and they took care of it right away without a problem and replaced them. 

We received a free beer thanks to the Yelp app by checking in!

We went here. The place was loud on a Sunday at noon - but only about 20% filled.  I had been craving a club sandwich - which they did have on the menu - but it wasn't really a club sandwich it was a turkey bacon provolone sandwich on ciabatta bread. I spit that with another gal who got the egg and bacon and ham sandwich on a baguette - which was better than mine. The highlight was some pretty decent waffle fries.

1839755,2017-10-05,1,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"It all started off incredible awkward, my husband and I were waiting to be seated and there was an African-American family of 3 ahead of us and the host sat us before them. I thought they were trying to accommodate a table for 3 and could seat my husband and I right away, but they just completely forgot about them which made it incredibly uncomfortable. The family was upset (rightfully so), I think the family walked out. By the way, we were sat at a 4-person table. 

Awkward moment #2 happened when we were asked to move to a different table after we already had drinks. The server took our order and that was the last time we saw him. We never got refills on our beverages, I ended up needing to ask another server for a refill after we were finished eating (I'm pregnant and water is a necessity!). We sat the entire rest of the meal and our server never showed up, we needed to ask another server for our bill. The restaurant wasn't even busy.

As for the food, the portions are way too large. (PSA to all Vegas Restaurants... STOP serving such large portions!!!) You end up wasting so much food in this city because you have no other way to reheat it later. We had the giant meatball with spaghetti and chicken parm - they tasted good. The chicken is no joke enough food for at least 2 people. We also ordered the grilled asparagus and there was nothing grilled about it, it was overcooked and overpriced ($11!). I would have just sent the asparagus back, but our server never stopped by to even ask how things were.

If you are a Total Rewards member and want to use Reward Credits here, it will cost you double. If you want to earn points, you need to go to the Total Rewards desk and give your receipt to them, despite this actually being attached to The Linq. This seems a bit ridiculous in my opinion.

We are regulars at The Linq and I will never come back here. Overpriced (our bill was over $80), TERRIBLE service and food was nothing to write home about.",Kel40KdJFqJ8vr5tA3P1QA,1,0,1,ZNeZNX-otn6RjusI91vTdw

Anyways the food was great. Our server was inattentive though and we had to keep flagging other servers down because our server was MIA. That's the reason for the -1 star. 

Moving on to the deliciousness. We ordered the rolled NY strip with asparagus ($15), classic burger ($15), 20oz rib eye ($42), and their house red wine (buy one get one free wine or beer when you check into Yelp). 

The NY strip with asparagus was very tender and the Marsala mushroom sauce it was smothered in complemented the steak well but was a bit salty. The waiter said this is one of their most popular appetizers. 

The classic burger was amazing! It was one of the best burgers I've had in my life honestly. I've never seen a patty that thick and juicy before. I'm not joking - see pics!

The rib eye was very tender and juicy when the server brought it out. But towards the end when the steak cooled down, it got really tough and dry. It was hard to eat the last 1/3 of the steak. So I have mixed feelings about the rib eye since the beginning of the meal was so good..

Our server had maybe 5 tables but they were all small and all he had to do was get drinks, make sure everything tasted fine and see if we needed anything. He had people to run his food so he wasn't running around with his head cut off trying to make everyone happy. Instead he reminded me of those people who can only manage one table at a time.

Holy moly!! The portions on the chicken parmigiana could easily feed 2 people. Two 7 inch patties with a side of spaghetti. The marinara sauce was really good. My hubby said his burger was delicious. He got the MOAB burger. He would eat it again. Only gave 3 stars because of the food.

 We sat staring at our half eaten food for another 5 to 10 min before he realized we were done and ready to go. After that moment, it seemed like he realized he kind of was neglecting us because he offered to get us more water, box up our food and see if there was anything else we needed.

FOOD
Unexceptional. The quality and style is what you'd find in any ole' brewery pub but the prices are of a mediocre fine dining restaurant and it just didn't work for me.
The calamari was perfectly cooked and breaded, I will say, but it was WAY oversalted. The steaks and ribs were over $40 each and I just couldn't imagine it meeting expectations at this place so I opted for the burger. I ordered it medium rare and it came well done. The waffle fries were delicious but again, WAY oversalted so that I couldn't eat more than a few. Totally unexceptional in every way.

DRINK
Decent beer selection. Overpriced by double what you'd normally pay but this is the Strip after all. You can find a single can or a pint for $8-$10. Wine by the glass was not overpriced, it is house wine that you'd find anywhere at about $8-$12 per glass. Cocktails also seemed to be average price but I didn't try them.

SERVICE
Our server was very nice... when you could find him! It seemed like all of the servers were totally hectic and overburdened the whole time, though they were very friendly when I made eye contact. It took over 1/2 hour to get a water refill. And someone at our table got a meal she didn't order at all. They did fix that situation by preparing what she'd actually ordered about 10 minutes later, but no clue where that initial order had come from. Seemed like servers were overburdened.

2300147,2017-10-11,4,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"Complete.  Frikin'.  Ripoff. 

Look,  I've been coming to Vegas for years and had family that lived here for years.  I get that things cost more, sometimes a lot more, down here on the strip.  That's just part of the deal, but this place blew my mind.  

So I show up and realize that the menu prices for the steaks have doubled from what their own website lists.  OK, fine.  So the $29, 16 oz. ribeye is now a $49, 20 oz. ribeye (seriously, I just double checked).  Not going for that as at that point, I could spend a tad more and go to a real-deal, well reviewed steak house.  There happen to be a few around here. I should have just walked away. 

You see, there is a lot of pretty reasonable stuff on the Linq Promenade that is pretty good.  Fair booze prices and food prices most everywhere on the Promenade compared to the area.  Why I didn't move on... 

So one star gone for not keeping your website updated... comes off a bit bait and switch.  So the only good choice I made was not going for the steak, because the $26 spaghetti and meatball plate was amazingly mediocre.  I can't hate - sit down restaurant on the strip, right?  Mediocrity for $25 abounds.  Still, I can only imagine the let down the steak would have been. 

But get this, fair Yelper.  They charged me $23 FOR A SINGLE OF FORTY CREEK!!!  Yeah, you read that right.  Twenty-three bucks for a single pour of a $19.99 Canadian whiskey.  

I asked what was up with that and got the, ""Well, it's the strip, bro,"" routine.  I pointed out that, for one, that's a four to seven dollar pour in downtown Austin, so the ""muh tourism"" angle doesn't fly.  Plus, Chayo next door is charging under $20 for Clase Azul Blanco and Fortaleza repo, so once again, that doesn't fly.  It's complete horse squeeze. I am still trying to forget his calling it a top shelf whiskey as well. 

No sir, that's straight up highways robbery is what it is. You can go literally ANYWHERE else on the strip that is anything more than a food stand and get food at least as good as this.  Hell, you can go most places on the Linq Promenade and have better for less, hot dog joint included.  And there is literally no where in western civilization that 40 Creek cost $23 dollar a glass.  Hell, it doesn't go for that in London or Sydney. 

I hope whoever sets those prices enjoys that pound of flesh.  You got me good tonight.  I've never in all my years of boozing around felt so completely jobbed as I did tonight, and I've bought beer at a Super Dome concert. 

Avoid.  You can do better.",wXxnzjvYdljkKtGzMhrJag,2,0,1,-NPKqx5wSDtJhaQmCBycqQ

The waitress contended that the offer was not for two bar drinks. I countered that she was right that the offer is for Buy 1, get 1 free! She said no that it was for me to buy a drink and for my guest to receive the free drink. WTF? I had to get a manager to explain it to me but at the end of his long winded presentation on what a BOGOF means in LV he just said that the other marg would be ""on the house."" 

Now I will admit the service was slow but not bad, and the food definitely made up for it. I ordered the bacon cheese burger and it was awesome! The party was thick and juicy with fresh condiments all in between what tasted like homemade buns. The fries were also good and plentiful. I think that no matter what hour of they one hits up this place, the food is sure to hit the spot. But please read the Yelp offer and confirm it with the wait staff so you know what you are getting into with a BOGO.",kIBYVjF-aNCnftELu7-fPw,0,0,3,QuUhdVrzJ8MWDbYgg73Hkw

This is a great place for a tasty meal along the Promenade at the Linq.

Happy hour deals can't be resisted! I got a juicy ribeye for $25. It came with mashed potatoes, green beans, and a few carrots. We also got $2 off several appetizers: fried calamari (I was sad there weren't any tentacles though) and kale salad - perhaps since we asked for dressing on the side, the greens were bare/raw which felt healthy albeit a bit more work to crunch, and there was a slight sparse sprinkling of dried cranberries, almond slivers, and hearts of palm.

The mac and cheese was lovely: served in a small stainless steel skillet, it stayed hot throughout our entire meal and never coagulated.

My friend's burger was huge (she only finished half) and tasty, and we all noshed on her perfectly done truffle fries.

For dessert, we got the cheesecake which was fluffy and not too sweet. The small drizzles of fruit puree were a nice touch, along with a few slices of strawberry.

Maybe because we were there for an early dinner, the place wasn't too busy and service was extremely attentive. I appreciated having a constantly full glass of water.  

Free wifi also available, but I wasn't able to get connected. For some odd reason, the restaurant wasn't listed when I tried to check-in on the Yelp app, but my friend was able to do it and benefited from their check-in offer of Buy 1 Beer to get a Free Beer.",WZu-3cs32sw_sKAkt1dy1Q,1,1,4,spmTaDsJlo63wqccv1_oBw

Tried the steak wrapped asparagus appetizer and this was seriously the tastiest steak dish I have ever had.  The steak was so tender and enjoyable.  I would have liked to order another serving of this!

We spotted the hostess at the other end of the restaurant and she shoo'd us away from that table and made us log in and wait five minutes before seating us to an obviously empty table.  Never a smile, never a welcoming gesture, and this is from your front of the house greeter.  Figured the food better make up for this character-less brunette hostess who really needs to polish up her people skills or find a job that doesn't include interaction with the public.  I've owned my business long enough to know the first face you see should be like family greeting you.  

Our server Pablo was really the face of the establishment, smiling, happy to see us, and accommodating in every way.  I'm sure he was over-worked because he was running around the entire half hour we were there and didn't get around to offering us refills on our drinks, but hey, I know it's tough carrying a load of tables at an eatery.  The ciabatta turkey club sandwich was good and the wife had a $19 burger which was big, but over-priced even for Vegas.

Thank you Marco for a great first experience at OTS. 
We dined at OTS after a 2 day convention while in Vegas, and were starving, but of course on a business budget. I found a few things on the menu, but the meatball sliders really stuck out to me. I'm a total baby when it comes to anything spicy, and always ask before I order to prevent having to send anything back.  Marco advised me (when no one else would have) that the sauce COULD be considered spicy, and insisted on bringing me a small sample. As someone who used to be in the restaurant industry, I would have done the exact same thing, and I really appreciated that. 
When I told him it was ""doable"" (and delicious!!!) he advised to order the sauce on the side, so I could control the bit of spice it had. We also ordered the upgraded truffle fries. 
The food arrived in a timely manner, just in time for drink refills, and everything was delicious. I mentioned that the truffle fries were really tasty, but very mild and he had the manager discount the extra charges (just added to his tip). Then the manager came over to apologize, and chit-chatted with us for a few minutes.
I already told my boyfriend next time we go in town for leisure, we'll be visiting OTS at The Linq Hotel.
Thanks again Marco for your great service. If you plan to visit, be sure to ask for him if you want A+ service:)",Rm82fHT1L6y1IRMO6ZGGAg,2,0,5,3WhUb7ZntleFXLUZ7_f6ag

My fiance gave Kieth, our server, his credit card and it came back closed to his card with a gratuity added.

First the dinner: we ordered caprese salad and the ribs appetizer. The Caprese consisted of melon-ball sized fresh mozzarella and halved tiny cherry tomatoes swimming in a delicious balsamic reduction. Not too oily, so the swimming part was OK. But size wise, should have been $9 vs. $12. The St. Louis ribs were an absolute stand out!Fall off the bone tender, and in a barbecue sauce that was sublime. Solid beer selection, and terrific service combined to make this a four star dinner. The only complaints were pricing about 50% too high, and I would've liked some more tomato in the salad. 

We came back for breakfast the next morning, and what a different experience. Coffee was bitter and cold and when I ordered a latte, the server came back to apologize for the fact that they were ""out of espresso."" The ""toast"" was two pieces of cold bread and only one piece had a hint of toasting on one side. And it was unbuttered, which is fine except I didn't ask for it that way and it was too cold to melt the butter at all. (I realize this is a very personal pet peeve, but I wish they had asked my preference) The meal was at best ""acceptable.""

The Atlantic salmon on quinoa was cooked to perfection and the plate presentation was beautiful. The potato chips are a must as an appetizer or an accompaniment to your meal. They are freshly cooked and deliciously seasoned.
The ambiance was nice and relaxing however the seating at the tables was less than desirable.  The chairs were very uncomfortable for anyone of an average build. 
I know what you are thinking, ""So if the food was amazing and the ambiance was nice, then why the 3 stars?""  Well the service was horrible. The waiter could not answer the simplest of questions, which is OK if it were his first day. The kicker was...the manager couldn't answer the simplest questions either. There were menu items that we tried to order and when we ordered them after waiting 15 minutes, we were told they were only offered for breakfast. When we clearly had a lunch/dinner menu. At first I thought it was just because our waiter was clueless, then we asked his manager who also had no clue.  It was a 1-2 punch of inferior service. 
When the bill came it was priced about average for a strip property, the only catch was the the same exact menu item was priced with 2 different prices. We decided not to ask the ""manager"" because as for all the other questions we asked it would have taken him 15 minutes to come back with the reply ""I am not sure"". 
So after writing all of this I am actually changing my star count from 3 to 2.

3167509,2015-03-11,5,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"For their second location, Off The Strip decided to open...on the strip. Located in/on The Linq Promenade, Off The Strip can be accessed either through the casino or from outside on the promenade walk. If you're looking to get seated for a meal, you'll probably want to make your way over to the entrance closer to the promenade side. The hostess table is setup there and it looks like they use the casino side as more of an exit. Inside the restaurant is much smaller than I expected, and it was really dark, but there seems to be enough seating throughout to accommodate steady traffic. 

We ended up coming here for my wife's birthday and having never been to their other location, I wasn't super familiar with what they offered, but I had them bookmarked for some time and have looked at the menu before. But when we arrived, we were given a menu completely different then what I'd seen online with the other side of it being the old menu that had been crossed out. For her birthday, she wanted a steak and there was none to be found. After asking our server, he said there were ""specials"" available not on the menu, 3 of which were steak dinners and the other a pork chop dinner. All the special menu items were priced at $39.99 and served with one side.

For an appetizer, we started off with some Marinated Olives and the Three Wise Hummus tray. There were 3 types of hummus alongside vegetables, feta cheese and pita bread. Out of the 3, I enjoyed the roasted garlic and kalamata olive hummus best. Both were smooth, creamy and added a different flavor to one of our favorite snacks. But the whole tray overall was pretty small and we had to ask for more pita, making the apps $15 price tag feel a bit heavy. The olives were priced much better at just $8, but about the only thing they seemed marinated in was vinegar and salt. After just a couple olives, I was eating them just to finish the bowl since no one else at the table liked them. 

My dinner choice was the Grilled Mahi Filet priced at $24. It was served over a bed of red quinoa, beans and drizzled with balsamic dressing. For the most part, the dish was okay up until I got about half way through the fish. I realized they hadn't fully deboned the fish after I got stabbed in the cheek. When I find things in my food, I usually stop eating it, but I realize with fish it can be easy to miss bones. But after picking through the other half I had, there were 6+ bones still in there. I can't say I've ever found bones in a mahi mahi at any other restaurant, but if you know the fish, they have big long bones. After finding that many, I was done and pretty surprised the kitchen could overlook something like that. 

The service we had was decent, mostly attentive, but we had to ask for refills and simple things a few different times. And when we informed them of the bones in the fish, no one bothered to even offer an apology.  

Luckily, the wife had much better luck with her steak and enjoyed her meal. But even with them being on the strip, I can't see the prices being worth it for the quality of food. Being that the other location has gotten such great reviews for quite a while, I might check that one out, but I'll be staying away from the Linq location.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,8,5,2,HtAroYIFudmz0SxooGUJ2g

Two! The waiter did not guide us on the menu at all. We were a group of 11. He should have told us the asparagus dish only had two pieces vHe could have increased his check size (and therefore his tip) had he guided a large group like ours to order enough apps for everyone. I had the Kale and Hearts of Palm salad which wasn't bad but the Kale pieces were so large you couldn't eat them properly and the hearts of palm were diced small which made them almost impossible to eat. I would have cut the Kale more but the Busser never replaced the dirty knife I asked him to replace. The rest of my group seemed to enjoy their food although there were a few small mistakes with how things were brought to the table vs how they were ordered. what really surprised/frustrated all of us as restaurant industry professionals in this town was how poor the service was tonight. The waiter walked away every time someone was in the middle of asking for something, we had to ask the bussers to clear our appetizer plates off the table because they started to bring all of our dinner items before anything was cleared. The Busser did not seem happy at this request at all. We had to ask for them to clear empty cocktail glasses and empty bottles of wine off the table. People didn't have enough napkins or forks/knives and the waiter wouldn't stand at the table long enough for us to ask for more than one item.

Unfortunately for us the first few spots we tried (Hash House A Go Go among them) were all packed with an excessive wait list. It was creeping toward noon, and our bellies were grumbling so when we saw that Off The Strip had brunch til noon, and no wait we went inside. 

We were seated right away, but after that everything went downhill. It took a good ten minutes for a member of the waitstaff to acknowledge our existence. Luckily by the time our server approached we were ready to order. I opted for the two eggs with chicken sausage, and an iced coffee. 

We all ordered iced coffees and when they arrived we were given a thimbleful of milk to split between the lot of them, and no sugar. Eyes rolled all around. Luckily, our food arrived not long after, and it was pretty good, although nothing I couldn't get at a diner, plus it wasn't much in the proportion department, and was overpriced (as are most things in this town). 

There's a reason this place didn't have a wait: the service was abysmal. And the food was mediocre in a town full of restaurants run by culinary pillars. This place was our last resort, and I recommend it be yours too.",NTmXTnbPOALAG0sSowMEBA,3,1,2,55IfY2AywDqjSFRPZ5-NaQ

I came along with two other people after they did some research and recommended this restaurant.  They had heard the burgers were very large (enough to share) and we looked on open Table and it said the burgers only cost $13 each, making it a great deal.

To begin, we got menus and the burgers cost $15. Different from the online menu, but still an okay deal if sharing among them so they got a burger.  It said it came with coleslaw and fries.  They ordered it medium rare.  I ordered a burger for myself with chips.  When the burgers came neither of us got coleslaw, though when we checked the menu again it clearly stated the coleslaw should have been included.  I asked about this and they took my entire plate away, burger, chips, and all, and came back with the meal again including a fourth of a cup of coleslaw.  Also, their burger was clearly rare, with the inside bright red and the juices seeping through and ruining the bun.  The burger tasted alright on my end and was in fact very large, but the ciabatta bun it was on was so flowery that I couldn't take a bite without my entire face turning white.  

We got through the meal and got the check, and it stated that the burger costs $16.  Not $13 like Open Table said, not $15 like the actual menu said, but $16.  We complained and the manager simply changed the price to the original $15.  He did not apologize or comp us, he just took off $1 to bring it back to the listed price.  He then came over after we asked for him and we explained the entire, awful dining experience.  He didn't apologize or comp us, he simply said they were updating their system and prices.  He offered us a beer on the house but  at that point we just wanted to get out of this place.

They got a one star because their burger was large and the craft beer selection was above average.  They do not know how to cook burgers, they lie about their prices (probably charging every single customer $1 more than listed), and they have awful customer service.  Do not come here!  Go to any one of the other 4 or 5 bars in the Linq area instead.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,1,1,DWzYYrxMB6CbDxrzeQaGxA

Love the up beat vibe and feel of this very casual spot at the Linq Promenade. The bar on the left side of the restaurant looked like they were pretty equipped to make anything your heart desires.  And the booth and table seatings were to the right. 

For a Saturday night , it didn't take long to be seated.   Perhaps we missed the dinner crowd since it was close to 11pm when we arrived.  Heyyyyy, Chel was on Vegas time aiight!

From the hostess to our waiter,   they were very welcoming  , prompt, and informative.

We all ordered our own 20 oz bone in ribeye with steamed seasoned green beans &carrots and garlic mashed potatoes paired with Joel Gott Cabernet.   Sauvignon (btw, when you buy a drink, the second one is free when you check-in on Yelp!)   Loved my medium well ribeye, soft and juicy and everything just complimented it well.  YuM! 

I would definitely return to eat here next time we are at the Linq.

We also ordered the Hummus platter which was also both tasty and plentiful.  Our experience was extra pleasant due to the personality of Jaban.  He was extremely helpful and efficient.

Lost a second star for having a nasty ladies restroom. No draught beer and just an okay selection of bottled beer. This was more like 3.5 stars but if your meal ends with a dirty restroom without toilet paper, then I don't round up. 

The good-ish:  There's no waiting, unless you count the apologetic hostess who was trying to take what seemed to be a complicated reservation over the phone. 

The good: The Ribeye was only $25 during the 2-5 PM and Midnight-3AM Happy Hours. They also offer a dollar off bottled beer and $2 off select appetizers. The Ribeye was very tasty and accompanied by smashed potatoes, green beans and two carrots for garnish. The steak was a little salty - which isn't usually an issue for me, but this was a tad too much. That said, it was perfectly cooked, tender and very filling.  My wife enjoyed the Garbage Salad which has pretty much the kitchen sink in it but manages to incorporate the shrimp, salami, capers, mushrooms, etc etc into a delicious salad that she'll get again. 

The music was pretty good and suitable to the atmosphere - which is dark and comfortable inside with the backside of bar and a few ""reserved"" tables facing the Promenade. The music was a lot like 'The Fray' channel on Spotify with a good mix of more current tunes thrown in like Adele, Gwen Stefani, The Chainsmokers, etc.

Not cheap eats, but LV prices are definitely higher than they used to be . . . ($47 total just for the Burger and a Salad)",FrjqtQxqOOQnIqp8jjDXcQ,0,0,4,JjVc8d6XVFi2cDgQvW5hpw

However if you're human and I would not recommend eating there unless germs and lies are what you like to eat. Staff delivered our food to wrong table where those people put their hands all over the food. I watched as they took the food back to kitchen where they added a few fries and rewrapped the wrap sandwich. When I called them out as I had walked to the window looking into kitchen and watched it they tried to lie to us. Eventually they agreed to make new food. However I watched what happened to old food and it went back to kitchen, sat a while and was sent to yet again another table. There were so many health code violations in our short visit I'm surprised no one has died from eating there.

You can walk in to restaurant from the promonade or linq casino. It's is on the loud side for a restaurant. But since the bar is within dinning  area it's inevitable. 
Here are descriptions of our dishes:
1.  beef stroganoff  was less than average. Way too salty and the beef was too fatty and hard. It tasted like an end part of old  prime rib left overs.
But the noodle was cooked perfect. 
2.  Spaghetti squash was the best I ever had. Cooked absolutely  perfect. 
3.  Spaghetti  MEAT BALL IS THE BEST in Vegas in my opinion.  SOOOO GOOD.
4.  Three wise hummus  was OK. Nothing original. I have seen it at other places. 
5.  Chicken parmesan  was very good.
Tender, tasty and big portion.  But the side angel  hair spaghetti  wasn't so good. 
6.  Ribeye steak was good. 
7.  Kale salad was cut too big. Little hard to put in your mouth. It could use little more seasoning. 
8.  Fried calamari was very good. One of the best I had.

Schön amerikanisch eingerichtet mit einer großen Bar im Eingang und einen Restaurant-Teil im hinteren Bereich.

Wir wollten eigentlich nur auf einen Drink nehmen, da wir sagen das ein Yelp Check-In Angebot gab, in dem es hiess, kauf ein Getränk und du bekommst das zweite Getränk kostenfrei dazu.

Da ich mir aber einen Cider bestellte, entschuldigte sich der Herr hinter der Bar, das er mir nur ein Bier als Freigetränk geben könne.
Ich sagte ihm, das es vollkommen ok wäre und ich es wüsste, das es ein Bier gibt.
Kurz darauf kam er und meinte, ich würde auch das Zusatzgetränk als Cider bekommen. Super Service.

Nun entschieden wir uns doch für einen kleinen Snack zum Mittag.
Ich wählte den Kale Salad. Grünkohl-Salat mit Artischocken und Cranberries.
Super lecker, knackig, geschmacklich nicht zu vergleichen mit normalem Salat und dabei noch sooooo gesund.

Hier hat Deutschland noch etwas aufzuholen, was den Kale betrifft.

Ingesamt war es ein schöner Mittag. Coole Location, sehr netter Service, Preis-Leistung stimmten ebenso und machten das Gesamterlebnis wirklich rund.

After such a good breakfast, I came back for dinner on 10/9/16. I ordered the MOAB Burger. After waiting for nearly 30 minutes for my burger, it was terrible. I ordered it medium and received a well done piece of unseasoned meat with canned mushrooms, waxy cheddar, and bacon on it (I ordered it with no onions). There was no sauce provided with the burger so I had to ask for some of their aioli. It did not help the dry bland burger. When I told the waiter that it was terrible he immediately got hateful and defensive claiming that I needed to communicate with him. I told him that I could only communicate with him if he is around. I had been waiting 15 minutes with an empty water glass and my arms crossed, napkin on my plate, for him to come around.

3822607,2015-10-03,0,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"Landed in Vegas on a Friday, and by the time dinner came around, my friends and I were starving. 
Being in town for a bachelor party, we had a large party of nine and no reservation. The hostess told us they could seat us if we didn't mind being split up. Since we were starving, and we were walk-ins, we didn't have a problem with this. 
Five of us were taken to a table towards the back that was still dirty, and the other four were sat in the front. They quickly cleared the table off and wiped it down and allowed us to sit. After about ten minutes, a waiter finally came by. Since we had plenty of time to look over the menu by then, we placed our drink orders at the same time as our food. After about five minutes, we were brought ice water in Stella glasses, because apparently they didn't have any clean water glasses. Everyone's drinks were brought shortly after that except mine. I figured this was probably because I ordered a Coke and everyone else ordered beers. 
My Coke was eventually brought at the same time our food was brought out, which ended up being a good 20-25 minutes after we ordered. I was annoyed by this, but the waiter ended up making up for it later. 
The food was actually very good; I ordered the MOAB burger medium rare. The burger is served with sautéed onions and mushrooms on it, cheese, but not much else. The bun is a ciabatta bun. It was very good, and the portions are huge. 
When our bill came, the waiter didn't charge me for my Coke, taking it upon himself to waive the charge without me even mentioning anything. That was nice. The ticket number on our bill was actually 777 too, so a joke was made to the waiter about a prize, and the manager came over and gave us all a free round of beers. 
I was disappointed at first with the really slow service, but this place made it right. I would definitely like to go back and try something else off the menu soon.",3r9TShxIxajLojvydaIhhg,0,1,4,UTKoGoo9P-drgcLhI4WN-w

Given its central location, it was surprisingly easy to snag a last-minute reservation for a large group on a Friday night. The food was decent, but I was more impressed with the service. 

My gripe was the small serving sizes and prices. I guess the calamari appetizer and truffle fries side were only meant to be shared between two people. While most reviewers have applauded the reasonable prices, I thought that applied only to the starters. The burger certainly did not warrant its $17 price tag (burger on French baguette and cheese - nothing special). I also couldn't imagine anyone ordering a $39 steak from here if you can get a better piece of meat at the multitude of steakhouses and buffets surrounding this location.

But, most importantly, our server was great with the splitting of the checks. All in all, I enjoyed the atmosphere and company. Awesome on the Strip experience at Off The Strip!",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,4,1,4,9_ZaRyymdGn2yj4DWeoH1A

I was happy to learn there was a new restaurant called Off The Strip and that it was reasonably priced for the strip, so we gave it a shot.

First plus, it's on Opentable, so I made a reservation on the walk over.  Unnecessary, but useful as Opentable gives points.  I bet you didn't know that, huh?  I also had a $20 Opentable dining certificate from said points that I needed to use, so this would be a cheap meal.

We were both in the mood for a burger, so we got the burger special and substituted the fries for a salad.  Our burgers arrived not too long after in interesting fashion. Instead of a bun it was more of a hamburger sandwich, but it was pretty good.  Tasty meat, and the toppings came on the side so you could customize it how you wanted. The salad really stood out to me as it was a really nicely made salad rather than just some lettuce and dressing.  Really impressive, and all for $12 each.

Joseph was our server, and he was really attentive and helpful.  The manager also stopped by to introduce himself and see if we needed anything.  Very, very good service combined with decent prices?  There's no way this can last, right?  I'll be working hard to remember this spot next time I'm on the strip and need a meal!",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,3,1,5,CVBfpJ3fhtsd430QUOMLSA

Service: 4/5  The young asian hostess greeted us with a smile and sat us down promptly.  We sat at the bar and had great service from Lea.  She was very friendly and gave us an awesome recommendation with the Rolled Asparagus.  She kept our drinks fresh and made sure our food came out timely.  

Food: 4/5  I had the Lamb Gyro Cheesesteak with the truffle fries.  Both were very big portions and were tasty.  Lots of cheese with the Gyro which I adored and appreciated.  The fiery BBFF took down the Lobster Ravioli.  She enjoyed it and I tried it.  Ravioli was on point as well as the sauce.  The MVP of the night is the rolled NY Strip w/ Asparagus!  Menu description: NY strip stuffed with provolone cheese, basil and sun dried tomatoes, with asparagus tips/spears and smothered in Marsala mushroom sauce.  This meat and cheese combo is the best duo put together since Daenerys Targaryen & Tyrion Lannister.  Fantastic, fantastic....

Value: 3/5 Typical casual restaurant pricing on the Strip.  The Lamb Gyro Cheeseteak was $17 and the MVP Rolled NY Strip with Asaparagus was $15.  The Lobster Ravioli was good, but not $27 good.  I think if you add the word lobster to an entree, you get to jack up the price $10. My Tito's and tonics were $10 a glass.

Ambiance: 4/5 Classy Bistro Vibe that is lively as it opens to the walkway of Linq promenade on one side with an entrance to the casino on the other side.  It will be noisy but not too loud as to interrupt your most interesting dinner conversation.  They use big plates which i always appreciate because I'm claustrophobic with my food and I'm a messy eater.

I had a great first visit and I'm looking forward to trying more things off their menu on my next visit.  The fact that it's open 24 hours is fantastic and just adds to it's appeal knowing that if I'm in the area, good food is always available.  One more time, if you like meat and cheese try the rolled NY strip.   This might be my new go-to pre-game spot when I'm on the strip.  Enjoy..",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,0,1,4,dn4MHiHjupDQnkDbkK-VDA

I ordered the short rib ravioli with mashed potatoes and my dinner date had the M.O.A.B burger.  I really enjoyed the ravioli and finished it quick since it was only  about 6 pieces of short rib filled dumplings.  Even though the plate didn't look filling, it was very filling.  Short ribs, ravioli, gravy and mashed potatoes are all hearty stick to your ribs kinda food so it definitely hit the spot.  Great combination of rich sauce with the tender ravioli and mashed potatoes.  The MOAB burger came with fries and a chipotle mayo sauce on the side.  This sauce was awesome!  Nice little kick to it and good on either the burger or to dip your fries in.  Wouldn't mind coming back next time I'm on the strip and craving for Italian type dishes.

Other reviews I read before I came here mentioned the service and believe them all. The greeting wasn't all the discussion I had from the bar, which isn't normal for me as I'm not seeing that at bars as much anymore, nor do I invite it. These guys really put forth the effort to make conversation.

I ordered the baked chicken wings (a few pics already so didn't add to the pile) they were amazing. 6 to an order for $9, they aren't spicy (recommend to the owner to make this an option) but they still taste great (I personally enjoy spicy food). I followed this up with a slice of cheesecake. Let me tell you as a cheesecake fanatic, this is good. 

Can't stress enough the service, everyone here makes a strong effort to engage in conversation with their customers. I see it with all the patrons currently sitting in the room. I had a nice discussion about my company and CES with Mario. Really nice and knew my company just by looking at my shirt. Not that I work for an obscure company, but he was or seemed genuinely interested in what I do.

So let's get down to it, why would I give 4 instead of 5 stars with all the nice things I have to say. Well one thing is I'm a stingy bastard when it comes to ratings, if everyone is 5 stars then everyone is the same again, so what's the point. The other is I do have a couple requests of the establishment to make it better for me. 1 the beer selection is lacking. I'm a dark beer drinker, they have one dark on the menu that's not my style, which is ok because if you don't drink beer or dark beer then who cares. The other goes back to the wings, taste great, but give me a spicy option or at least some hot sauce on the side.

Only dispointing thing about this place was our server....Our server came up to us and didn't greet us or give us his name. Just wanted to take order. He answered my questions about the menu, but was completely uninterested. Refilled beverages and food came out quickly, but never once asked if we enjoyed our meal. Also once we arrived and ordered our first drink I showed him the Yelp check in deal which is free cocktail with order of a cocktail. So I asked him is this mean one our drink is free since we both ordrered one? He then said No, buy one and then second one is free.  We finished eating and we are still waiting for him to ask us for the 2nd drink, he comes over with the check wow really? So where is our second drink? he said, oh I didn't realize you wanted you FREE cocktail. Really? Isn't that your job to ask how I am doing and If I need anything else?

4415581,2018-02-18,6,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"A family trip to Vegas.  Brother is wanting a steak but definitely not feeling like hitting one of the Steak Palaces on the strip...  more going for a casual, ""Outback"" feel without the chain restaurant name.  And that's what Off the Strip felt like.    It definitely fit the bill for a relatively low key steakhouse dinner - and even better it was right next door to our hotel so...  the choice was obvious.

We started with an appetizer of fried shrimp for the table ($15).  Not bad.  Nothing surprising.  A side of the Truffle Mac N Cheese ($12) was decent and rich tasting.  Great leftovers after a late night - so I recommend this to take back to the room!  My brother's 20-oz Ribeye ($42) was not a favorite.  He had ordered it medium (a mistake IMO but whatever...) and it definitely looked well done to me... not a hint of juice remaining.   The steak didn't seem to be of great quality either - though hard to tell when it was that overcooked.   

The best dish was an appetizer ordered as a main course - the Rolled NY Strip w/ Asparagus ($15).  This was a surprisingly generous portion of steak rolled with cheese, basil and sun-dried tomatoes, topped with a mushroom Marsala sauce.  This was plenty of food for an entree - a good light dinner.  

We ended with a piece of cheesecake...  utilitarian but not awful.  If you are the sort that wants to end dinner on a sweet note, this will do the job.  

Off the Strip's biggest selling point is location.  The food isn't bad if you're doing a casual family meal, but thinking of it as a good place to have a ""steakhouse"" dinner is the wrong way to go.  Sticking to the sides and apps is a much better plan.  The main event wasn't that impressive.",0x9xu_b0Ct_6hG6jaxpztw,15,10,3,Rpu4HyuQJyM8bHdBVKAORA

We stopped here because our large party could not wait 90 minutes for Hash House.  This was a mistake.  The restaurant was empty on a Sunday morning.  Despite the amount of open tables,
the front desk somehow thought it was wise to seat a group with several senior citizens on a high top with stools.

In order to correct their poor judgement, we asked for a different table and they pushed together a clean and a dirty table and tried to slap it together while we stood there waiting.  Cleaning tables after seating guests - at said tables - is really lame especially with an abundance of clean tables throughout the restaurant.

That notwithstanding, the food is mediocre.  In this day and age of competition, it is no wonder that the place was empty, again, on a prime breakfast/brunch day!

I ordered the seasonal melon and it was expensive for an old melon that was not sweet.  I also shared a sandwich with a friend and I can't remember what we ordered...that's how uneventful it was.  It doesn't help that the service is poor.  We had to hunt down our server which is, again, sad in an empty restaurant.

All of us were very pleased with our food. I ordered the M.O.A.B. Burgers and it was amazing!!!! So much awesome flavor in one burger.

I'm willing to pay a parking fee to see her but not multiple ones within a night. Luckily we scored some free parking. 

She decided to meet at Off the Strip at the Linq....still considered on the strip though. There was a couple of dishes I had my eye on so I got the Fried Shrimp appetizer ($15.00) and the Lobster Ravioli which I can't recall the price of that dish. The Fried shrimp was so good I wish I ordered 2 of them! I'm not sure of the tarter sauce was home made but I really enjoyed it. The Lobster Ravioli was good but I liked my shrimp better! I think I was turned off by the sauce on the Ravioli it reminded me of Butternut Squash which I'm not a huge fan of. 

We were nestled in a corner booth so we could still hear each other talk but since a sports game was on sometimes it would get a lot harder to hear when people cheered and stuff. I didn't mind it we just had my aunt with us who is in her late 70's so it may have been loud for her.

It's located at the Linq so it was just a 5-10 minute walk from Planet Hollywood.

Our server was Josh.  He made some great suggestions and was very friendly.  He suggested the NY strip wrapped asparagus to start and the Truffle Mac and Cheese as a side.  He also recommended the Pesto Salmon and Atlantic Salmon.  We went with his suggestions.  Oh and we started off with some great drinks.  I had the Moscow Mule that was perfectly made. 

The food came out promptly and Josh's recommendations were amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Mac and Cheese and Atlantic Salmon.  Everything tasted fresh and the flavors were amazing.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, I hate when salmon is overcooked, which unfortunately happens at a lot of restaurants. 

Definitely a great late night place to eat.  They also have 2 happy hours with $7 snacks/meals and great drink specials.  I'll definitely come back for the happy hour specials next time.

We were about to head out of town and stopped at this place for brunch. The food was literally AMAZING. We had the RIP breakfast sandwich, which was huge and delicious. The chicken and waffles- hands down the best chicken strips I have ever head. An avocado chicken sandwich with waffle fries- also huge and came with an amazing spicy dipping sauce that I literally wanted to put on everything. A classic breakfast with scrambled eggs, sourdough toast, waffle fries and chicken and apple sausage. I LOVE CHICKEN AND APPLE SAUSAGE. I make this all the time at home but have never seen it in a restaurant and I was literally so happy. I only eat turkey and chicken and am usually super limited at restaurants in the breakfast meat area. 

Wish we would've tried this place first and probably would've tried to eat all my meals here. 

But FYI, the services is super sloooooooow. Like literally the world's slowest. We drove so we weren't trying to get to the airport or anything and we sat on the patio so we were just enjoying the people watching, but if you're in a hurry or whatever I would maybe rethink it.",EghL7k2M75rRUTGmAddnVg,0,0,5,J2vxino5cw8zj_6eyYG5wA

Order the Lobster Ravioli.  Delicious sauce.  And filling for about $8.  The truffle fries are so good.  Fries are super crispy and not drenched in truffle oil.  The chicken fingers were good too.  I appreciate chicken fingers, as basic as they are, if it had more chicken than breading.  This had a thin layer of breading, which held everything together still.  The only downside were the ranch and honey mustard dressing it came with.  A bit weird and too salad-like.

Situated right between Linq and Flamingo, it is conveniently located by the strip, so you don't have to walk all the way inside the hotel. I had been here late night on a Friday. We ended up here only because this was one of the very few restaurants open at 2 am, and our first choice restaurant was too crowded.

Ambiance: This has a unique ambiance with an upscale vibe to it. It is decorated in modern furnishings with plenty of booths and tables. The lighting is on the darker side, setting up a great atmosphere. This was also reasonably crowded that late.

Service: One thing that bummed me out was the rudeness of the host. When we arrived there, less than half the restaurant was occupied, but he made us wait for 10 mins before giving us a table. And he took us to the farthest table near the entrance, instead of one on the main dining area, even though there were many empty spaces. I was very disappointed with that. Our server however, was very polite and helpful.

Food & Cost: The food is superb. We got a pasta and four different burgers. All were very good. Even the garlic bread was excellent. Pasta portion was a bit small. The costs however were a little on the expensive side, even for Vegas.

Pros: Good food, open 24 hours, not very crowded
Cons: Bad service, slightly expensive

Overall, this is a decent place with great ambiance. The service however, isn't as good, and the price is on the higher side, for which I deduct two stars.

We were famished and decided to try this place as it had high ratings.  Most of the food is expensive, but they do have a sandwich/burger/salad selection that does not break the bank.

The atmosphere is sophisticated and sleek with subdued lighting, leather backed chairs, and a warm wood palette.  The service was very slow, but the waiter was friendly and efficient and even stirred us away from the spaghetti squash.

We ordered the avocado grilled chicken sandwich (bunless), the protein burger, and the caprese salad.

The caprese salad was very good - the balsamic vinegar was thick and pungent, the cherry tomatoes sweet, the basil very fresh and packed with flavour, and the mozzarella, while not rivaling Tuscani's offerings, was delectable.

The chicken was really good.  Generous portion with a lot of guacamole.  I had a salad on the side, but could have had the truffle fries.

And finally, the burger.  Looked like about a third of a lbs of tasty meat with coleslaw.  It had such a great flavour!  Delicious!

A buddy and I had lunch/brunch at Off the Strip around 1 pm on a Saturday.  The restaurant was busy but service did not suffer.  We sat in the bar and had a great view of the Masters on the TV directly across from our table.

Our server arrived immediately and took drink orders.  Off the Strip has a decent beer list with some local stuff but it is not long.  The prices are commensurate with other Strip restaurants.  To eat, I went with the chicken avocado sandwich and added bacon.  On the side, waffle fries.

Our food arrived between 10-15 minutes after ordering.  It was clearly made fresh, the sandwich and fries were both hot.  The guac on the sandwich tasted like mashed up avocado.  That is not the worst thing in the world, avocado is good by itself, but if you are expecting a great guac this didn't deliver.  The chicken was seared properly but was not seasoned, or, if it was, I could not detect any.  The aioli on the side is good but not great.  Probably the best part of the sandwich was the bacon ($2 to add).  It was thick and just a bit crispy and very flavorful.  Hard to find a better way to spend $2 on the Strip than on this bacon.

The waffle fries were fairly standard, you have had them several times at other joints probably.  They basically taste like Arby's curly fries but in waffle fry form instead.  

I did not have any of the french toast but my buddy said it was fantastic.  So, entirely possible I would be giving a 4 or 5 star review had I gone with that.  I would eat here again but I would probably try something different.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,5,5,3,dSTD7tVtp0LcRrpQ_IbEUQ

Am letzten Abend gab es zum Abschluss einen Burger. Da dieser Laden im The LinQ (die neue, erst seit 2014 bestehende Straße, die zum High Roller führt), ist und wir ihn noch nicht getestet hatten, war ich etwas besorgt, dass der letzte Burger für die nächsten Monate eventuell enttäuschend sein könnte, aber die Sorge erwies sich als unbegründet. Mein M.O.A.B. Burger war exzellent: beef patty, mit Bacon (über Hickoryholz geräuchert), karamellisierte Zwiebeln, Pilze und dazu Käse. Fast noch besser war aber die Beilage: Trüffelpommes mit Parmesan und frischer Petersilie.

An die Vorspeise kann ich mich leider nicht mehr im Detail erinnern, aber ich weiß, dass wir uns drum gerpügelt haben, wer die letzte ""prawn"" haben durfte ;)

Thai Sweet Chili & Bacon Prawns ($12). OUTSTANDING! Prawns are HUGE, butterflied & filled w/ cream cheese, and wrapped with a crispy slice of bacon saturated in sweet chili. Order this, or you're missing out on the obvious WINNER here! And don't worry, it's not spicy in the slightest.

Rolled Angus NY Strip w/ Asparagus ($14): Provolone, Basil, Sun-Dried Tomato & Marsala Mushroom Sauce. Excellent, thin sliced TENDER beef, pairing so well with the sun dried tomato & mushroom. Recommended!

Smoked Salmon Carpaccio ($13): Truffle Vinaigrette & Capers. Thinly sliced fish with just a hint of truffle fragrance. Very enjoyable!

Steamed Green Lip Mussels ($13): White Wine Tomato Broth & Garlic Bread. Tender shellfish in a creamy tomato broth, a bit mild in flavor, asking for a hint of salt/cheese to set it off.

Truffle Parmesan Fries ($8). Good amount of truffle oil, but towards the bottom pile, became hidden behind a plethora of SALT & salty cheese. It's been a long time since I've considered a fry almost too salty lol.

Marinated Olives ($8). All pitted for easy consumption, the large green olives were delicate and flavorful...the smaller Kalamata olives with a considerable amount of vinegar.

Truffle Mac & Cheese ($8). Well cooked pasta, nice cheese ratio and sharing size, but without a hint of truffle oil.

Baked Chicken Wings ($9). Good flavor, but missing the nice crunchy consistency found in the preferred fried variety.

Lamb Gyro Cheesesteak ($11): Roast Peppers & Onions, Provolone & Peppadews. Bread cut too shallow, leaving a dense waste of carbs at bottom. The lamb was flavorful, but hidden between that same bread...I'd pass on this.

And for dessert:

Al's Cheesecake ($6). Very creamy cake, bubbly and light. It was enjoyable, but would fair well with a nice crust for consistency.

Double Chocolate Sundae ($6): Peanut Brittle, Hot Fudge, Cherry & Whipped Cream. Very CREAMY chocolate ice cream, as if it was not even frozen! The brittle baked thin, nutty...a very welcoming addition. Recommended!

To quench the thirst:

Chamomile Breeze ($10) & The Orchard ($10). The former delicate with a fair amount of citrus, the latter a bit sweet with cinnamon and apples, yet finishing with a nice bourbon undertone.

Overall, an excellent choice on the Linq boulevard, more enjoyable than my last few stops in the area.  Would be a great place to catch the game, grab some good food, or a pit stop before/after the Wheel.  

....Just make sure to ORDER THE SWEET CHILI PRAWNS!!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,17,15,4,XX1zmIkM-XylFxEY1133xA

5262653,2016-04-23,0,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"We had reservations at 8pm for 13 ladies on April 8th. When we arrived at 8pm, we had to wait about another 10 minutes for them to get our table ready. 

We were sat at a table right next to another large table of women, probably about 15 of them. And we shared one waiter. 1! One! Poor Mark. He actually didn't do a bad job at all. Even with his two large tables pretty much at the same stage in eating. They would order, then we would order. They would get their food, then we would get our food. He got all of my table's orders and had to come back to make sure he had everyone's order correct for some reason. Which was all right by me. Get it right the first time. It took a little bit for our food to come out. I know this because we were all starving. 

I ordered the short rib ravioli. It was good. On the salty side. Came with 6 big ravioli and a whole lot of mashed potatoes. I pretty much finished it all, so I can't complain. Everyone at the table seemed to like their dishes. 

Now comes the cluster***k. Paying time. He handed out everyone's bills correctly, but since there were so many of us, the first set of girls who got their bills were already handing him back cash and credit cards. So he was just grabbing them while handing out the last of the bills. He didn't keep it in any kind of order. And as he came back with the receipts for those girls, other girls handed him cash and credit cards. He got it all mixed up and charged some girls for other girl's bills. Someone who paid with a card got cash back. It was a little chaotic. Poor Mark. He was shaking and sweating from dealing with too many ladies at one time! Why did they give the man 2 big tables with little help from anyone?! All of our tabs were pretty much the same, give or take some. But we all saw how overwhelmed he was and didn't want to make too big of a deal, so no one said anything. Plus we needed to get our next destination.

5271721,2016-06-23,1,fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w,"My wife and I got a package ticket that included admission to Madame Tussauds, a ride on the High Roller, and a meal at Off the Strip at the LINQ.  We chose to have dinner.

The restaurant was easy to find, as it is located in an outdoor plaza called the LINQ Promenade.  The shops are mostly overpriced and cheesy boutiques, with some restaurants and bars sprinkled in.  Off the Strip at the LINQ is one of the larger store fronts.

We sat in the restaurant area, which contained both booths and table seating.  There is also a large bar that takes up about half the establishment, including a patio area facing the promenade.  The décor is sort of a modern rustic design.  The dining area is dark and woody, but not so much that it is overwhelming, and noise from the bar was distracting at times.

With the coupon we had, we were limited to specific appetizers, entrees and desserts.  These were clearly marked on the coupon.  However, we were able to upgrade for a charge that was fairly reasonable.

I ordered the chicken parmesan, and my wife had rigatoni.  Our salads (garden and Caesar) were fresh, our entrees well-presented and tasty, and the dessert good.  Our service was above average.

The turkey chili was slightly warm and my roasted chicken was perfectly cooked and tasty, yet small in size. The truffle fries were the best part of the menu.
