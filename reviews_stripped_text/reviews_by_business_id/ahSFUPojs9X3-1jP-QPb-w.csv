The food is absolutely fantastic. Taste and presentation are on point. 

The cocktail and wine selection are great. Order the cocktail sorbet, can't remember the name, but the presentation is wonderful. 

The atmosphere is eccentric. 

Service is ok. You always have that feeling that they are judging you for not spending more, even tho our bill was $600.....

I watched the waiter roll his eyes when he showed another server the bottle of wine we ordered--even tho we ordered two. 

Considering the crappy renovation of the SLS I can't imagine they get too many million dollar players to have this kind of attitude.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,3,0,3,aa4torUpV6Ag6Ry3Mwg_yA

The menu is setup up as serving tapas, so keep that in mind as you pick items off the menu.  Being setup as tapas, it can add up in a hurry, so this place can become quite pricey by wanting to try too many items. 

 For starters, we had the Reuben and the Simple Tomato Salad.  The Reuben was really small and you only had like 3 small bites to it, but it did taste great.  Don't just get that for a starter, because it makes horsderves look huge.   The tomato salad was very good.  It had at least 6 different types of tomatoes in a Balsamic vinegar glaze.  

Then we got the Classic Tartares as an appetizer.  This was actually made for you at your table.  I personally never had Tartares before, but I must admit it was worth trying.  

For dinner, we had the Chateaubriand, Tenderloin with Robuchon mashed potatoes that were truly buttery heaven.  I highly recommend both f these items for dinner.  If I could give this place 6 stars I would.  You must put this place on your bucket list while visiting Vegas. You will not be disappointed.

Having said that and sufficiently hurting my own arm patting myself on the back I'll get on with my review.

So wife and I have a romantic weekend planned and in our search for hotel and food we found the SLS and then found Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres. 

We sat at 10 pm. The last sitting. The restaurant was still packed. It had a slight pretentious smoky hunter appeal to it.

When you walk in the ovens and kitchen are all open and exposed. Fire was the first thing I saw and then the cooking meat smells wrapped around my head like a wicked banshee leading me to my table.

The ordering was a little different but our waiter was by far one of the most professional waiters I've ever met. Based on our tastes he guided us through the menus and everything we ate was PHENOMENAL!!!!.

This is the guy who brought tapas to the US (?) for I was expecting tapas-sized portions. No, this was enough food to feed Franco's army. And that's not a good thing.

Five of them were like Nazi planes bombing Guernica. I had great expectations of the tomato tartare but they remain as elusive as an anarcho-syndicalist dream under Fascist shelling. The brussel sprouts were even worse. Like, why am I alive and eating this garbage? I should be as dead as Garcia Lorca, rather than attempting to discover flavour amid the cloud of tedious tastelessness. But finally, some beef arrives. Veer towers of breadsticks wrapped in in high quality beef, with a cheese dipping sauce. Very good. Worth the long bus ride from South Strip. Jose's gin and tonic would have been worth the price at $8.00. Not alas, the actual price, being twice that.

First starting with the over priced over well done steak.
After spending way over $1600 dollars on steaks alone , not including the appetizers, libations etc  I would have expected a better tasting steak, No WOW factor at all might as well went to a below budget steakhouse This was certainly not how I wanted to spend my Las Vegas Celebration experience.. The appetizer s were also nothing to write home about. The Brussels sprouts were a let down, soggy with a weird acidic taste laced with grapes? The  Foie'Gras by way of  cotton candy was over before it started, lol.. No taste at all, more so a waste..

This was a Wednesday. By Saturday we both ended up in the hospital in Montreal where we live. Extreme food poisoning and colitis. We were so dehydrated. When I got better the following week I called the restaurant who said a manager would call me back. Never happened. I called back following week and they said manager had my name and would call and never did. I only wanted an apology and to warn them that this should not happen to other people sine two people landed in the hospital. My friends told me to call again but could not bother as they clearly did not want to call me or hear what happened. This is being written because my friends told me to download Yelp and at least warn other people about the horrible experience but more important how they would not even call two customers who ended up in the hospital.,0622O732N31m-RiP3Z-Obg,2,1,1,20oLzB9qpIJIb5Y2iWdfVA

The meat sharing idea is brilliant (got a couple of different steaks, chicken, etc.) to share. Presentation and quality outstanding. Throughout the night, never felt pressured. In fact, when we asked if we should order more entrees, the server advised that we had a great selection and that we would be fine. He was right.

Chicharrón, Giant Pork Skin - one of my favorites. Fried pork skin with heavy spices (pepper, salt, cumin) and a yogurt dip.

The Classic Beef Tartar - very tasty, another favorite. One of the best tartars I've had.

Robuchon Potatoes - very rich and extremely buttery. I enjoyed it but couldn't eat too much of it. Gave me instant food coma.

Oxtail Buns - fried oxtail bun with quail egg and caviar on top. It was recommended by the waiter. Very flavorful. 

Mushroom Side - small portobello mushrooms topped with olive oil, garlic and parsley. Simple but went well with our meal. 

Suckling Pig 1/8 - also came with a salad. I pre-ordered this. Normally they do not to 1/8 but they ran out of 1/4 that evening. Glad it was only 1/8 because there were only two of us and we ordered a lot of food. This dish is their signature dish but my least favorite. Overall, it was ok, it was tender but agree with the other yelpers that mentioned that the Chinese roasted pig is better.",HtKQbNok0ByaETG3Pg-yFA,2,1,5,NlVGhnP7XeuSJn8jIO0VBw

493688,2015-03-07,4,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We dined at Bazaar Meats last night for the first time and it will be the last.  Oversized menu's, horrible food and ok/borderline acceptable service.

None of the meat on the menu looked appetizing to us. Paying per pound at min. $50/lb and we were told that most steaks were 2-2.5lbs each.  The veal chop was the only thing we were considering ordering. We decided to start with a bunch of apps and then maybe order the veal chop after we tasted some of the menu. Glad we did!

We ordered chicken croquets, just ok.

Dozen oysters - We are oyster connoisseurs and will always order oysters if they are on a menu. These didn't taste fresh, very very briny and salty. The three sauces they served with it were horrible. We just ate them with fresh lemon juice b/c we were starving. In hindsight they should have been sent back. Thank god we did not get sick!

Beef Carpaccio - was served wrapped around a breadstick dripping in oil. Beef was very good actually and tender, but the presentation sucked and the waiter suggested we order this one over another, but failed to explain that it would not be on plate, rather wrapped for us on a breadstick.

Tuna sashimi - horrible presentation. Got 9 small pieces of sashimi for $48. Took one bite and sent it back. Very fishy.

Salmon tartar - Also sent back to the kitchen. Very very salty. Too many capers. couldn't eat more than 2 bites. they also sent these greasy ""chips"" with it. We couldn't even look at them.

At this point, we had sent back 2 items in a row (tuna and salmon tartar) and probably should have sent back everything to be honest.  

We told the waiter we were disappointed and got the check. He seemed embarrassed and just softly apologized. I think he was new to waitering. His service was just ok.

Would NOT go back. If you're a foodie like us, don't waste your time or money.",L097jSFz6Pvx_sL9gWOXwg,5,2,1,66dyKD0LknXM7MrzAhVj1w
507373,2015-02-08,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Service: We've been here twice now and service has been shotty both times. The first time was when the restaurant first opened so perhaps they just had some kinks to work out. We had made reservations and the place was pretty empty when we showed up (we're old and like to have dinner earlier). The hostess stuck us in a weird side table next to the back room. We asked the server to be moved to a different table as it sounded like there was a private event going on in the room since it was pretty noisy.  He did not seem pleased at all and it took a while to get moved (you know, the restaurant was soo busy and all..)  The new server was not as knowledgable about the menu as we would have liked. He had to get back to us about some questions. 

We went again recently and service doesn't seem to have improved much. Not only was the server not knowledgable like the first, the timing of our food was weird. Some things came out too quickly, and our main took way too long (so long, in fact, the server came and apologized twice). Let's get these people some more training, shall we??

Food: This place should be renamed to Bazaar Dessert instead. We had the $25 platter both times and every single piece was delicious. Can't rave enough about the desserts. We would come here just for that. 
The oysters are delicious (both times), just make sure to ask for no pepper on them, unless you like it like that. The lamb neck, mushroom, and cauliflower vegetable sides are amazing. 

Surprisingly, for a meat place, the red stuff isn't that great. The Kobe isn't anything special (the best we've had was at Providence in LA). We had the Mishima ribeye and one would think it would taste amazing. It is a $100+ piece of meat, after all.  Sadly, it lacked flavor. The cocktails and Iberco Jamon are nothing special, save your money and get them elsewhere. 

Overall, don't expect to be WOWed, and expect to spend more than what the stuff is actually worth. But do try the desserts, and it is still an interesting experience (menu/restaurant concept).",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,1,0,3,8-AMKjYymVtkF4ZReYW7Tw

My boyfriend and I had a bad day and we couldn't wait to just relax and enjoy each other and as we decided to give this venue a chance... let me tell you, the atmosphere alone was interesting; it's good different but inviting. You and can feel the Spanish influence in it! You will recognize the magnum wine on the side of your table and think, this is much needed. The moment we got greeted by our host to where we got seated, we both felt very welcome and comfortable. Our server, Miller was on point with informations and very efficient in his timing. Manager at the time, Pano greeted us a few times as well to make sure things were going fine and suggested a few starters for us that he loves.. well Pano, you're amazing and thank you for this experience we will definitely tell our family and friends about Bazaar Meat!! 
The staff are all smiles and you just can't help but to smile back for starters, we got the cotton candy foie gras and croquetas de jamon And It Is To Die For!!!! You have to order it when you get there! Promise? 
We got the ceviche as well and that is prepared on side table.. it's was very interesting to watch but the best part is eating it!!

This dinner was the on the top of our list and we highly suggest you come and try this place or you are missing out on something very special!!!  I've decided to come back here with family and friends in a few weeks for my birthday dinner and can't wait to show this venue off!!!

I started with the carpaccio, which was composed of seemingly impossible to achieve paper-thin slices of beef, sherry vinegar, croutons, and capers. The whole experience was awakening and lovely. I then had the skirt steak, which was accompanied by a rosemary-mustard sauce that sent shivers down my spine, it was so good. The potato straws was a perfect side dish.

531205,2014-12-26,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"If you want an eye-opening foodie experience in addition to a great meal, make sure Bazaar Meat is on your bucket list.  Even though our meal wasn't perfect, the stand-outs so outshined the not-great items that I still have to give Bazaar five stars.  First, a note about the service: unlike a previous review that mentioned an unevenly trained staff, we had well-informed staff across the board.  When a food runner came out with a dish and we had a question (which was almost every time), all the different food runners (think we had 4 over the course of the meal, hard to keep track) were able to answer every single question.  And our #1 server Joe was as competent and professional as you could ever hope for in a restaurant staffer.

We ordered a heckuva lot of food, so here it goes:
Cotton candy foie gras: super-cute idea, foie gras on a stick wrapped in cotton candy.  But it wasn't just a novelty, it was actually quite good. 5/5
Fried oxtail steamed bun:  absolutely delicious!  super-tasty, but also super-expensive.  The bun is $13 and surprisingly small. Taste: 5/5, Value: 2/5
Giant chicharron:  a huge piece of fried pork skin perfectly prepared - light and puffy yet not oily - but I wasn't crazy about the dipping sauce, some Greek yogurt thing. Chicharron itself: 5/5, dipping sauce: 2/5
Foieffle:  one of those super-innovative dishes that you admire for its creativity, but you can't really say you love. It's a Belgian-style waffle(tte) with honey & peanut butter, covered in a foie gras sauce.  Good, but more artsy than tasty.  3/5
Robuchon potatoes:  mashed potatoes with so much butter melted into them that you could almost sip them through a straw.  In order words, yes, it was almost other-wordly good.  5/5, but I'd give it six if the ratings went that high.
Grilled lobster:  the lobster was sweet and buttery, grilled to perfection.  Be advised, however, that there's not that much meat in what was supposed to be a 2-lb lobster.  Taste: 5/5, value: 2/5
Kobe beef:  fantastic, beautifully prepared, seasoned just right.  And at $100 for 4 ounces, it's probably the least expensive Kobe in Las Vegas.  Taste: 5/5, value: 4/5
Roasted leeks:  yuck, the worst item we ordered all night.  The vegetables are made in a coal oven called a josper.  No, not charcoal, but coal.  The leeks were just too smoky and weird-tasting.  I love leeks, but this gets 1/5.
Catalan spinach:  spinach cooked with pine nuts, apples, scallions, and raisins - 5/5.

Yeah, that's a boatload of food. But wait, there's more!!  I haven't even gotten to our multiple dessert courses!  You have two options for dessert:  pick & choose from a large assortment of small bites, or a normal-sized ice cream, or do both like we did!
Tocino:  a very heavy version of Spanish flan, delicious but a bit too heavy. 4/5
Chantilly and vanilla/raspberry cream puff:  we ordered just the vanilla/raspberry but they goofed & brought out the Chantilly also, so we got to try both.  Neither/nor is anything to get excited over. A very tepid 3/5
Chocolate salted peanut tart:  fantastic, a perfect blend of chocolate, caramel, peanuts, and salt. 4/5
Lemon meringue:  a creamy lemon filling, the best lemon tart I've ever had. But it's literally one bite for $5. Taste 5/5, value 2/5
Praline puff pastry:  very delicious, but a very small portion for $7.  Taste: 5/5, value 2/5.
Salted caramels:  if you like salted caramels, you'll love these. 4/5
Big dessert #1, the vanilla experience:  a 6-ounce serving of house-made vanilla ice cream, served with 3 snifters, 1 each of coffee beans, a vanilla bean, and aged rum.  You're supposed to savor the aroma of 1 of the snifters before and after eating the vanilla ice cream.  Not the transcendent experience that I think they're aiming for, but the rum was good sipping rum, and the vanilla ice cream was top-notch. 4/5
Big dessert #2, salted caramel ice cream:  this is a WOW, way better than the actual salted caramels.  Our server Joe said it was his favorite dessert as well, not just here at Bazaar, but ever, in his whole foodie life.  Yeah, it's that good.  5/5 doesn't do this dish justice.

And now for the moment of truth (cue Dragnet music) ... our tab (just food, because we only drank tap water), with tax and a 20% tip, came to $550 for 2 people *GULP*.  Bazaar is great, and I understand that a whole lot of work goes into the preparation of these itty bitty tapas dishes and desserts, but a word to the wise: you do have to keep an eye on how quickly all these small plates add up. Granted, we splurged because it was our Christmas dinner, but even if we had ordered less expensive items, a meal at Bazaar would still be a pretty penny.  That said, I'd gladly go back to Bazaar again and again.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,2,1,5,OeQisDAjA88bN0U5Lfz51Q

572184,2015-06-18,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I think the average of 4 stars is about right for Bazaar Meat. It was a tough call between that and 5 stars because the food was excellent.

I went with a friend and although we had a reservation, we still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table even though it didn't seem super busy. They have a neat display of the various cuts of meat just as you walk in. 

The meal was excellent, but the pacing of it was a little off. Our waiter explained they have several kitchens making the various items (Grill, Charcuterie, Veggies, etc) and to expect food to come out at different times. This would allow everyone at the table to share. He also said it would take about 50 minutes for our steak, and asked if we wanted any other starters beyond the Vittore 1950 Carpaccio (which was good, but next time I'll try the Beef & Parmesan Grissini he recommended). We passed, and waited patiently for the steak. I did order an LN2 cocktail, which was more like a boozy sorbet made with liquid nitrogen. It tasted great and helped pass the time as it was made table side. Beers started at $13, which is a lot even though they had some nice craft options.

Once our steak came (our waiter upsold us to a two lb Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus) , it took another 10 minutes for the Robuchon potatoes (buttery amazingness) to come out, and then it took another 10 minutes or so for the Catalan Spinach (sweet and delicious).  I wouldn't have minded if a bunch of appetizers had come out at different times, but we would've preferred to enjoy the steak and sides at the same time, especially with the 50 minute wait time.

The steak was very well seasoned, but I'm not sure it was worth the extra $20-30 from the other beef rib steak options. 

All in all, we had a great meal. 5* for the food, 4* for the price and pacing of the meal. I'd love to do one of the tasting menus some day.",eRMh9b8d0M7mX3htmTod8Q,1,0,4,RJ6KVDQ2yZ4uKu14jEbDzw

After some collective sticker shock, our table decided to get the $200 tasting menu. Other reviews have probably given you the entire list of what they ate. To be honest, there were so many courses, I lost track. Here are my highlights:

Caviar flight: Word of advice - go for the sturgeon-based caviar. You will not be disappointed.
Tartare: The tartare is prepared table side and served along with slider buns. Delicious.
Steak: We had the Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus rib eye. The perfectly carmelized steak was super good  (served sliced, and presented with the bone). The waiter told us we got 2 1/2 pounds of meat (for 4 of us); we were not wanting after this course.
Mashed potatoes: The description says ""butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes"". They weren't kidding. This was mashed potato goodness.
Dessert: We had a selection of tarts and what looked like petit fours. Excellent.

624469,2016-08-08,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"One star is too much for this place. I say zero stars!!

Let me begin by saying that I am an avid restaurant goer and have had my share of bad experiences. Read my other reviews. I have been disappointed in several occasions. However few are comparable to my visit to Bazaar.

Let me also say the meat in Bazaar Vegas is objectively good (although good can also be found in Outback Steakhouse for 5x less).

Having said this, my review can be broken down into several themes:
- Overpriced : everything here is 1.5x to 2x your traditional high end restaurant headline price. This approaches Michelin level prices while delivering miles below the Michelin experience. Any wine by the glass will start by setting you back almost twenty bucks (we are talking Spanish wine people, pre tax pre tip. The type you can buy bottles worth seven to eight bucks will be sold to you for at least 10x that price).
- Fake: I have seen some peoples review mentioning the cotton candy tapa (cotton candy wrapped micro bite of low quality sugar crusted foie) and the olives (olive infused spheres). These have been written by people who have never had foie or good olives clearly. There is nothing authentic about the poor foie, the sphere is démodé and you should get this as a free appetizer (of which there were none for the record), and I dare not mention the lack of authenticity that the tortilla, morcilla, or even the pre frozen croquetas exuded (the latter reminded me of the stuff you buy in big frozen bags back home in Spain).
- Tiny portions: The whole ""tapas"" thing is a scam. Portions are just tiny. The waiters will do their best to try to sell you a Spanish tapas experience and you will end up having to order 2x what you typically would or end up hungry. At some stage I just started ordering twice the original amount and still ended up hungry.
- Brash: waiters are running from one place to another with little regard for personal touch. At a restaurant like this, this would have been for me the obvious redeeming factor. Waitress was late, plates came with no logical order. Two of the orders were simply forgotten. Big fail.
- Oversized: this place is huge and empty. About two thirds of the tables are unused. Huge corridors and empty areas make you feel this place was built for scale, and not for the individualized experience. I realize this may sound trivial, but the picky eater with high standards who makes his way here will be shocked by the disproportionately large size of the place that conveys a Cheesecake Factory feel to set foot into an unfortunate series of disappointing events.

All in all I wish I had made a generous donation to a noble charity proposition, and will probably do, to clean my conscience off this terrible experience.

635956,2014-11-28,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Note to Bazaar patrons:  if you write a review while in Bazaar the manager will come over and try to passive- aggressively intimidate you at your own table.

I would Iike to point out to anyone on yelp that it's ok to not be into a dish and to yelp about it, even if everyone else seems to like it. This is what the Internet is all about. This was actually my second time to Bazaar and I'm still not into it. Am I a bad person for this? Perhaps. But am I entitled to my own opinion. Hell, yes I am!

My original review that upset the manager:

 ""Salty blahness. Although I'm not a huge fan of Spanish/Catalan food, this didn't particularly elevate it. In general, if you serve me foie gras on a stick, I'm gonna pissed. Your cotton candy silliness around a little tiny bit of foie gras is an insult to those tiny lives that died for delishiousness. 

Hype. Hype. Hype.

Drinks - creativity off the chart.  Sea mist foam on top of the margarita - amazing.  Dissolving cotton candy on the mojito - crazy.  The lemon cocktail that is more like a sorbet made with liquid nitrogen - outstanding.  Wine list offers wide selection (though not a large selection under $100/bottle).

Food - there is a lot of pomp and circumstance about the preparations but underneath the taste and cooking itself were excellent.  Get the tasting menu, but sub out to get the cotton candy covered foie gras if it is not included.  It's only a single bite but well worth it.  We got the chateaubriand which was tender, cooked perfectly and very flavorful but I suspect any of the meats would have been great.  As for sides, every one we had seemed better than the last but trust the Yelp reviewers and don't miss the mashed potatoes.  Easily the best I have ever had.

Service - overall very good.  We set the pace of the meal by asking waitress to let us linger through cocktails, and then she checked back with us on when we were ready to start appetizers and again before the main course was ordered.  The bus staff was on point clearing and refilling plates / water, but one time they removed cocktails that were not yet finished.  We told the waitress and we got another drink on the house.

745203,2016-09-27,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Been twice to this restaurant in a year.  First time, service and food was impeccable! Everything was on point.  I happened to come here to celebrate a belated 40th birthday that was long overdue. The postponement was almost ten months in the making but it was well worth it!  

Fast forward eight months to August 2016, I am hosting top VIP clients from TX. They have an astuteness for fine meats and other delectables. I took initiative in making a reservation here.  My second time around was slightly disappointing. The restaurant has different levels of tasting menus.  I recall selecting the best tasting menu during my birthday and was hoping to do so again my second time around. To my dismay the restaurant decided to streamline their tasting menus and retired the one I had. Nothing even came close to the one I had before. I had asked our waiter what happened to the tasting menu with the caviar service, etc....the waiter stated it was not too popular in the Las Vegas market and decided it was time to retire that service.  Good enough for me.  I ended up ordering the best tasting menu they had that evening.  I invited the sommelier to my table to recommend a good red and white wine for the pairings.  I have to say, the sommelier had no personality and never once asked us what we ordered. She figured by asking the waiter she was going to figure out the pairings.  What really offended me was that the sommelier did not ask me the price range I wanted to spend for the wines as they can creep up on you in the hundreds if not thousands per bottle at this joint.  I had to be very assertive to the sommelier and explained to her what I was looking for since she had no idea about prices.   After a few minutes with her and she couldn't tell me the 'price' which I found odd, I decided to go with my instinct and ordered a Lafite Rothschild, Schaefer, and other wines for the table. Oddly enough, every single one I ordered was sold out.  So I ended up going for her recommendations which I found to be extremely odd.  I wasn't impressed with her palette and selection, but I found it to be a talking point for my clients about it.  I can't recall the wine she ordered for us (wasn't memorable) but I do know that I paid $185 per bottle and we had six of them.

Alas, a great place to celebrate milestones and entertaining VIP clients. I don't think I would ever use the sommelier at this place again.  I have a better nose than the one that assisted us that evening.",idtNxedUGMarCN-PgSFU4g,1,1,4,BaeaRDDTRWgSPKpQSF0Rsg

If you've been to the Bazaar in LA, you might be thrown off a bit at first glance of the menu, but don't fret, it's still definitely all meant to be shared (or not if you come very hungry with a definite craving for a certain type of meat).

From colonial murals to crocodile heads with jewelry, the decor is pretty SLS with the exception of mouth savoring meats on display across the 5 separate kitchen across the floor.  What they produce is mouth watering success.

What we had:
Cotton candy foie gras, Asian tacos, suckling pig sandwiches, 2lbs of the Harris ranch and mini corn.

Everything was amazing and we're all dying to go back for the whole suckling pig with a larger group.

The cotton candy foie gras is a great combination and awesome starter.  Asian tacos is Europe meets Asia and equally great.  The suckling pig sandwich is one of the larger appetizers but wow!  So juicy!  The steak was perfect and we all loved the shaved salt, or whatever it was, seasoning encrusting a perfectly cooked slab of meat.  And if you love corn, you have to try the mini corn with mayo and popcorn powder.  Out of this world!

Bazaar meet doesn't stop there though.  The service is second to none, and our server, Tony, was spectacular and knocked the evening out of this park.  If you can sit in his section, you won't be disappointed.

The menu is a little overwhelming so we asked our waiter Nick to make recommendations, which we inturn followed.  The suckling pig was amazing and that is coming off an authentic south east Asian pig roast just 2 weeks ago.  We much prefer ribeye and tenderloin over a strip steak (personally feel it lacks the flavor and tenderness) but Nick encouraged us to try it.  It was very tender and had incredible flavor.  We followed other recommendations suchs as the cotton candy foie gras and that too was special.  My wife and I will return here before any other steak house (and many other resturants).

Went with a large party and were basically told we all HAD to order the same food and that you weren't allowed to just order whatever YOU wanted to eat individually. Everything was obnoxiously justified with painfully boring explanations about the chefs vision of a multi kitchen logistical nightmare.

Servers were pushy and snobby, food was absurdly salty and portions are stupidly small. Also what we had was not amazing innovative stuff, pretty normal stuff with a slight (mostly unimpressive twist). Perhaps croquetas and chicharrón are groundbreaking to some Vegas tourists?

It may help to say I have eaten at MANY a fantastic Michelin rated restaurant. In many countries. I am not giving a bad review because I do not ""get it"" or appreciate fine dining. I just had a lousy experience here.

Getting one of the tasting menus is a horrid idea as you will get one thimble sized portion of everything per person vs six little bs thimbles if you just ordered off the menu. 

The only redeeming factor was the fact that the meat from the $100 classic tasting menu was really good. 

Literally I'd say skip this place, but if you must, do NOT go with more than two people, do not go hungry, know that you will spend $100-$150 no matter what you do, and honestly just pick three things eat them and ignore the idiotic instructions on not ordering à la carte and not sharing.",2-8CDHrEidR1i6Ld8vSwPA,7,1,2,im6BUqUze-KLXqrSS-TW3g

I decided to make a call over and try to secure a reservation for 830 (a tough time to get really anywhere in Vegas on a convention week) unfortunately these guys were booked solid but had a 1000 available.  I took the 10pm slot hoping to squeeze in a little earlier after spending sometime at the restaurant bar.

I had never been over to the SLS hotel/casino before but really was surprised how much I liked the look and feel of the place.  SLS has a real ""LA"" style to it, also being a much smaller casino and catering to a younger crowd it didn't reek of cigarette smoke or bad perfume.  Bazaar is tucked into the rear of the SLS with a nice entrance and foyer at the front.  The restaurant looks great with unique steak and kitchen knives on display and real working butcher shop equipment.  The dry aging racks are on display with suckling pig and the beef I was about to consume.  

We let the hostesses know we were there a bit early and would be at the bar.  They were friendly and upfront with us that early seating wasn't guaranteed but they would try.  Drinks at the bar were priced well for fine dining and the service was prompt.  We had a Mezcal Negroni and an Old Fashioned; both were mixed well with crystal clear square cubes.  The Negroni in particular was excellent and a unique expierence with the selected liquors, a fresh look at the standard. 

We were lucky to be seated about an hour early of our reservation directly in front of one of the open air kitchens.  I don't write many reviews but really felt compelled to do so after the first rate service by our server Marc Lewandoski, this guy made the entire experience worthwhile.  His innate knowledge of the menu, pairings and source of the fare was truly astounding.  Marc takes his job seriously, and it shows.  

After a few minutes of discussion we chose a few starters: Pulpo (octopus), the Vittore Carpaccio, Geoduck (clam) and the Kushi Oysters.  Each was distinctive and worth the coin.  

The Pulpo:   Fresh and perfectly cooked, not rubbery or mushy.  The sauce was light and very flavorful but not overpowering.   Serving size was a small plate enough for two or three people.

The Vittore Carpaccio:  Served ice cold on a cold plate was sliced razor thin with hard cheese slivers, capers and light oil.  A real excellent dish for two, the meat melts in your mouth and the cheese is robust.  

The Geoduck:  Uniquely flavored and refreshing a good size for two people was served with an excellent sauce that was possibly cream based.  Good dish for someone who enjoys a seafood experience.

The Kushi Oysters:   Amazingly fresh for being in the middle of a desert wasteland that is Vegas.  The in-house vinaigrette and cocktail sauce was excellent.  These really were my favorite...you can't go wrong with fresh oysters. 

The main dish HAD to be the rib eye steak.  I discussed with Marc about my particular tastes in red meat and he made two recommendations the Mishima reserve and the Lindsay Ranch.  I really wanted a steak that required no seasoning and had a powerful flavor.  Marc pointed me towards the dry aged Lindsay cut and I decided to take the plunge.  Asking for a medium cooking was the right choice as well.  The rib eye arrived hot and perfect...red in the center with plenty of marbling present.  The portion would be good for two hungry Americans or three from anywhere else in the world.  Flavor was amazing; didn't need anything and stood alone as the best steak I have ever been served. 

After this truly serious gastronomic adventure Marc hooked us up with liquid nitrogen frozen cocktail that I really can't remember the name of.  It was sweet, potent and made right at our table, an excellent ending.

Unfortunately, we didn't leave any space for dessert...we were stuffed.  I really wanted to try something as it seemed the pastry chefs were working hard in the kitchen just a few feet away.

This meal wouldn't have been half as enjoyable without the direction of our amazing server Marc.  Hat Tip to you dude, best meal I have ever had.",N7IS6ZhhXG8Evh-oIp2ivw,0,3,5,cMFwb3Xw3ldClSswnT9dfA
981252,2014-12-18,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"This is a real oddball place with some very good elements, some very weird, and unevenly trained staff.

Let me start by saying the steak is exquisite, perfectly aged, among the best I've ever had.  It's a nice room.

With that in mind, they had to work really hard to earn anything less than a 4 or 5 star review from me.  But, unfortunately there were a slew of negatives, for instance:

1) They were out of 70% of the menu items I attempted to order (if not the dish itself, a key component of the dish.)  For instance, after looking at the menu online I was dying to try the morcilla with sea urchin.  Guess what?  No sea urchin.  No prawns either.  (I can actually understand that to some extent: if you want things to be super-fresh, and you're nowhere near the ocean, you may be out of seafood items from time-to-time, even quite frequently.)  Still, when I tried to order a side and was told ""that's out of season"" I wonder why it's even on the menu, unless for some twisted reason the chef wants his diners to experience disappointment.
2) While our waiter was extremely professional, helpful and competent, some of the runners were not adequately trained.  For instance, after the waiter had talked us into sampling the West Coast oysters, the runner showed up at our table and announced: ""Here are your East Coast oysters.""  When we said we thought we'd ordered West Coast oysters she said: ""No.  They're from the East Coast.  British Columbia.""  There were other, similar blunders.
3) Even though the place was half empty, and we had a reservation, we were made to wait.
4) All the mains are cooked very very slowly, for a very long time.  The result is excellent; not suggesting they change that, just that it creates a very odd atmosphere to be sitting for a very long time after your appetizers with nothing but empty clean plates in front of you, and you look around and everybody around you is sitting at tables with empty clean plates in front of them.  At least serve bread or something.

One other thing worth mentioning: this is not a good option for a solo business traveler.  Although it looks like from their online menu you can order steak by the pound, you really can't.  (Like you can't say ""I want a 1 lb. steak"" I don't think.)  They are bigger and meant to be shared.",F_N4NyoMJWzBYFspeYfH3A,2,1,3,dAjNvvARaPeys96Uhy7Xng
983121,2016-04-25,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"The boyfriend surprised me with this place on my Birthday. Because I didn't look at the menu in advance it was a bit overwhelming trying to decide what to get. Our waiter checked on us quite a few times before we were ready to order, then dropped us completely after a table of 8 business men came in. Our glasses were completely empty at one point. Really?

We ordered maybe 6 tapas along with the suckling pig to share. It started on a high note with the cotton candy which is cute and delicious. The olives were very good, both traditional and modern. However the rest are more than forgettable. It was hard to choose a protein with so many options on the menu. But I insisted on getting the sucking pig because hey, who can pass on the dish that is ""heart and soul"" of the restaurant. Big mistake. The first bite was decent. The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. But the skin turned chewy soon afterwards. At the end of it I felt like I was chewing leather. The pig was oily and heavily seasoned with nothing to balance it out. You can't really eat more than a few bites without feeling sick. The salad came with it had some sort of vinaigrette dressing that was clashing with the flavor of the pig. Let along how visually unappealing of the dish. The only reason I can think of why people love this would be they came with a group and had 2 bites. Those first 2 bites were good indeed.

We got a few things for desert and they are all pretty good and cute. But we're not here for that. Still though I'd give this place a solid 3 stars for its mediocre food if it wasn't for the waiter.

992626,2014-11-17,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We've learned from the fare at the Cosmopolitan that José Andrés can mix up some fine eats. At Bazaar Meat inside SLS, he shakes things up a bit, by breaking some rules and introducing diners to a new way of fine dining. I think he's offering a model that is pretty great. You can customize a meal here; more so, than I've seen elsewhere. Whether you're a party of thirty or a table for two they have you covered. For example, you can order a few tapas or a whole suckling pig. Even a vegetarian can have their needs met. 

I suppose with that wide appeal, you would want seating for many guests. Bazaar Meat does not miss that mark. The dining room is huge. It seemed to go on for days when we were seated in the back not far from the raw bar. There are private rooms, communal tables, just a big ole mishmash of options. The decor is pretty eclectic too. It definitely brings the bizarre to Bazaar Meat. Open kitchens, mismatched chairs, antler chandeliers, alligator heads, I could go on and on... 

You might run into some trouble snagging a reservation. I did. Open Table showed no availability. Upon calling, I was told they were fully committed. Odd for a Monday evening, only a major convention could fill the space. After checking with management the hostess said that she could squeeze us in. I was appreciative. It was a surprise to find a near empty cavernous space on arrival. Our two top was in the depths of the restaurant we only passed a few diners on the way. It was peculiar at first, but toward the end of our meal we weren't entirely alone. 

The menu is extensive. In fact, our two framed menus were larger than our table. We had to joust to share the space. The menu is broken into a few sections: starters, raw bar including carpaccios and tartare, then there are soups, sandwiches and cured meats, and fire pit selections are followed by other meats, vegetables and salads. It takes a short bit to decipher the best attack plan. We started with the signature Cotton Candy Foie Gras ($8) and Classic Tartare ($24), followed by the Suckling Pig Sandwich ($14) and entrée selections were Lamb Neck ($25) and Beef Cheeks ($36) with sides of Robuchon ($15) and Brussel Sprouts ($12). 

The husband has been on a Moscow Mule kick lately, he was disappointed that it was not part of the cocktail program. He was told, they did not have the proper glassware. I opted for the Salt Air Margarita. I prefer the foam to the salted rim, since I tend to have a real knack for getting salt in my eye. I enjoyed the cocktail. 

The Foie Gras Cotton Candy is a playful bite, at the center of the ribbons is a decadent torchon coated with amaranth. The Classic Tartare is the real star, I've heard it has tableside preparation, but ours did not. I've never had a better version. The sirloin is so velvety, almost buttery, what really sets it apart is the robust flavor from the Savora Mustard. The Parker Rolls are light and airy, and a nice accompaniment. The timing of the rest of meal was questionable. We had the Beef Cheeks first, they were tender, but overall fairly pedestrian. Next came the Suckling Pig Sandwich, and the Robuchon potatoes. These dishes are magic. José Andrés pays homage to the man with the most delicious potatoes in all the land, with butter, butter and more butter. The sandwich is really stellar. I cannot recall ever having a better panini; succulent pork, sweet caramelized onions, tangy mustard and crispy bread. Again, it's the mustard really makes it sing. This, coming from a girl who detests yellow mustard, let it be said, all mustard is not created equal. The braised Lamb Neck and Brussel Sprouts were the last to arrive. The lamb was the weakest link of the meal. It was heavily salted. Not nearly as tender or flavorful as I had hoped. I'll stick to shanks, racks and chops. The Brussel Sprouts were just petals, they were light and refreshing. It was like a breath of fresh air after all the rich courses. 

I've heard such high remarks given for service, our server was accommodating, but he was unpolished. He assumed we were dining for half price, while we'd love to, we weren't SLS employees. So, instantly, it left an impression we were overpaying for our meal. Then, he went on to explain how gamey and chewy the steaks can be. If it he had good intentions it certainly didn't entice us to try the steaks. Toward the end of our meal, we heard another server offer a nice welcome spiel to diners (that did qualify for 50%) that really showcased the restaurant's offerings. Despite a few flaws, overall, it was a pleasant experience... I'd return for the pork alone.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,1,4,2rg6mLAXFHg2z9h5tySUWA

We were all sadly disappointed! The pig was chewy and salty! It wasn't necessarily bad but not as good as I expected having tried many styles of pig meat. I think the typical Chinese roasted pig is tastier than what we got at Jose Andres. The skin of the pig should've been lightly crisp. Instead it was very chewy. We also ordered the white fish. Again disappointed. Absolutely no real flavor accept for salt and pepper. Needed more spices or herbs to make it special. The only dish we all enjoyed was the steak tartare. Served with delicate dinner rolls was very tasty. The rib eye was good but not worth $200 for 3lbs?? I don't mind paying $$$$ for exquisite food but I didn't taste it at Bazaar Meats. Besides the steak tartare, I wasn't very impressed by our meal. The service was wonderful, however. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and pleasant.

What we ordered:
 Giant chicharron- literally a giant square that they break apart table side. The Greek yogurt dipping sauce added a nice flavor. 
Reuben sandwich- the bread was air puffed with cheese inside. Amazing.  
Croquettes- filled with ham, cheese, and onion. It was alright, cheese had a strong acidic taste for me. 
Classic tartare-made table side, with just the right amount of heat. I ended up finishing the ample portion when my two table mates tapped out. 
Paella pasta with squid and pork- the pan had good crust so the vermicelli had a good crunch to it while the top was soft and flavorful. 
Double cut pork chop (1 1/4 lb) - the quince sauce had amazing caramelization, light pink throughout. 

Robuchon potatoes-tasted like I was eating a stick of butter dipped in mashed potatoes. Sinfully good. 

We didn't make it to the desert menu but they also had a wide variety of choices with multiple flavors of each choice such as cakes, tarts, cookies, cream puffs, candies, etc.

However, working down the street from the SLS in Los Angeles, I was familiar with the hotel and with Bazaar.  I made an appointment via OpenTable and originally planned on having about a dozen people.  Well, that number grew to 15, then 18 and then back to 16.  Everyone at Bazaar Meats was terrific, starting with Hayley and the manager who was there the evening of our meal.  They moved around tables, gave us a private area for our large party, and assigned a gentleman named Nick to be our server.  I am not sure what happened to some of the others who offered their reviews, but I have to strongly disagree.  We did agree to a set menu, but from a host's point of view, I thought it was a wise decision (and recommendation).  The restaurant was very, very busy and the food tended to come out slowly; yet the presentation and taste of all of the dishes were worth the wait.  I had some very, very high profile guests.  Everyone enjoyed the experience, the private area, the great service offered by the manager and Nick, the unusual but interesting presentation of food, and the great wine suggestions offered by Chloe, the sommelier.

Overpriced and terrible quality--low-grade dog food at best. I wasn't impressed with anything that we ordered. My wife said she felt ill after eating her meat--it was truly low quality. As for the service? It was TERRIBLE before Natalie saved us! We sat at our table for 40 minutes before being served! One of the busboys gave us attitude when we finally asked him to get our server. I wish I'd gotten his name. He was tall with dark hair, fairly well built, with a negative attitude that made me want to teach him a lesson (but he was twice my size and ten times less my intellect, so I refrained). The other servers and busboys could have cared less that we were sitting there unserved for nearly an hour. Natalie was the only good point--she truly tried to make the situation right.

Cotton Candy Foie Gras- yum!
Chicken Croquetas - delicious!
The green olives -I could have done without. They weren't bad, just not my thing.
The Classic Tartare- Amazing
Pork Skins- surprising good (I was skeptical)
The Potato Purée and the asparagus was also good, but the cauliflower was my favorite!

I had the cotton candy everyone raves about and it is good, but you really need 2 or 3, so be warned. 
I also had the bisson buffalo carpaccio which was truly amazing and a treat for the mouth. The six small strips in the serving were just not enough, but oh so good. 
I had to try the Reuben on air bread, and it did not disappoint, the meat and condiments were heavenly, and air bread means just the crust, which was delicious, the whole thing was only the size of your middle finger, and again, I could have had 3 or 4. 
I love pork rind, so decided to try what was described as a 'giant' one and came with yoghurt. It truly was giant and night and day from what you buy in the grocery store. This was just delicious, with just the right amount of spices sprinkled on the top. The yoghurt was good, but a little ordinary compared to everything else. I am already wanting to go back for more. 
I thought i was done, but I was spoiled with an off menu treat.

We started with a couple of pre-dinner cocktails.  Then we ordered a recommended bottle of red.  Don't recall exactly what it was, but there was a good selection of wines.  Obviously for a place specializing in red meat we went with something on the big and bold end of the spectrum.  

We then ordered a couple of apps.  We got the pork grinds and the cotton candy foie gras. Both were...unique to say the least.  I can't honestly say I would get them again, but nothing wrong with them.  Just a matter of personal taste.

For our main we split a steak and the buttery mashed potatoes.  The waiter made sure we were aware that the steak would not be like a normal American steak, and that it might seem tougher, but assured us it would be more flavorful.  He was right.  Only slightly less tender than a premium steak at a normal US style steak house, but definitely a more flavorful experience.  The potatoes were amazing.

Service throughout the meal was absolutely top notch.  They checked on us regularly, and made great recommendations.

The food, most of  which was excellent, was served tapas style. In order, our favorites were as follows:

Buttered potato puree (TONS of butter!)
Roasted padron peppers (charred and full of flavor)
Cotton candy foie gras (a specialty of the house)
Albondigas (can't go wrong with meatballs!)
Wagyu and kobe beef slices, cooked on a hot rock (one was way too fatty for me; guess my palate isn't that refined)
Ribeye steak (well seasoned, but undercooked)
Tomato bread (good, but nothing special)
Reuben airbread (interesting idea, but kind of a letdown)
Brussel sprouts ""petals"" (another interesting idea; ditto on the letdown)
Assorted desserts (creative plating, but too sweet for us)

Yes, you read that right. At a renowned steak house, our favorite two dishes were peppers (him) and mashed potatoes (me). The steak was good, of course, but we both ordered them medium rare, and mine was almost blue. Solved that problem by scarfing down the sides and taking the beef home to reheat later!

The wine pairings were a sparkling Cava, a delicious red (wish I had gotten the name), and a serviceable Port. Service was quick and efficient, and even though our waiter said there might be a wait on the main course because it's cooked to order, we were in and out in a reasonable amount of time.

If you can afford it, by all means try Bazaar Meat any time of the year. But if you're more budget-conscious (like me!), wait until next year's Restaurant Week to catch a bargain.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,9iamx2zLP0E2BCXFGRiyYA

They answered every question that we had about the menu and throughout our 10 course meal. Yes, it was pricey but worth every penny!!! Every dish that was brought out just kept getting better and better. Our most favorite dishes were the shrimp and crab cocktail, rib-eye cooked to perfection, mashed potato was to die for, oyster with a kick, and desert that topped it all off.  This is definitely going to be our new favorite restaurant!",2XybGXoZ8F8JfJfQXaDDuQ,0,0,5,Q6rV-cpRi6LBakUSH9727w
1282248,2014-10-06,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"This review was so hard to write because it is very difficult to put this type of dining perfection into words.  I will say that this restaurant has not only earned a 5 star review, but it has become the standard that I measure other possible 5 star restaurants against.  Yes. It was that good.  

First of all, this restaurant is stunningly beautiful. The place boasts four separate kitchens which take the ""Open Kitchen"" concept and put it on steroids.  The largest of the four kitchens, the meat kitchen, is in the center of the restaurant and offers 360 degree views of the meat being cooked.  The contraptions (seriously, I can't think of a better word to describe it) where the meats are being cooked are one of a kind and can be described as works of mechanical art.  The bar is beautiful and the hand crafted cocktails all look delicious.  I tried the cotton candy mojito (which is actually served up in a martini glass) and it was so good.  Perfect combination of sweet and tart! 

The food is second to none in this tapas/small plates style restaurant. I went with my husband and another couple. Here is what we ordered: 

Cotton Candy Foie Gras
Lucia Salad
Bison Buffalo Style Carpaccio
Beef & Parmesan Grissini Carpaccio
Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio
Salmon Tartar
Suckling Pig Sandwich
Harris Ranch Black Angus
Baby Carrots
Grilled Asparagus

The Lucia Salad are individual endive leaves filled with dressed parmesan and a small sliver of anchovy. This starter is super tasty and the anchovy is definitely the star here.  

The carpaccios were absolutely outstanding.  I even liked the Bison which I normally do not care for.  The combination of blue cheese and pickle flavor combined with the Bison is both unique and excellent. The Yellowfin Tuna was the best that I have ever had.  My favorite, the Beef & Parmesan Grissini, was beef wrapped around grissini and served with a parmesan dip. 

I don't eat pork or foie gras but everyone at our table who tried the Cotton Candy Foie Gras and the Suckling Pig Sandwich said that they were both delicious.  My girlfriend said the pig was delicious but a touch on the rich side. Instead of these, I ordered the Salmon Tartar and I loved it.  The combination of the salmon and creamy avocado in this dish is so good, I hated to share it.  
 
At this place you order your main dish first as the steaks can take up to an hour to prepare, as well as your sides.  Then you order several small plates to taste while you wait.  Our main dish was the Harris Ranch Black Angus Steak and the sides we chose were Baby Carrots and Grilled Asparagus.  Because of all of the small plates that we ordered, my party of four split one order of the Steak and one order of the sides.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and exceptionally well cooked.  I was pretty stuffed by the time it came to the table but make room for it I did :) 

I'll admit that I really don't remember much about the service. The food here just kind of overshadowed everything else about the place.  It must have been flawless as the food, and the drinks, seemed to be flowing. Speaking of the drinks, my husband really enjoyed the sommelier.  He said he was very knowledgeable and down to earth.  

Based on the reviews, I was expecting this place to be much pricier than it was.  The four of us ate for under $600 and that included a bottle of red. Definitely would not call it inexpensive, but I have happily paid more for a meal of this caliber. I would absolutely recommend this spot and I can not wait to go back!",jOX6aVwI9sA-sQFWBZSsFw,5,4,5,6Djk8n3v-tYgpz0K3euyYQ

I should preface this by saying we ate here on Thanksgiving, and we did the Thanksgiving prix fixe menu and ordered one small ""Vaca Vieja"" steak to try. I should also preface by saying we live in New York and MIGHT be a bit particular when it comes to fine dining and our steaks...
Anyway, with that out of the way.

We arrived for our 8pm reservation a few minutes early and were told to wait at the bar. There were three hostesses working at the stand which was weird because hostess #1 asked us our name and when we told her, hostess #3 answered us and told us to wait at the bar. Whatever. There was no indication at this point that they were running behind.
At about 8:25, a DIFFERENT hostess (hostess #2?) came up to us at the bar and said ""Did you have a reservation?"" Uh, yeah. 25 minutes ago. So then we finally got seated. No apologies for running late, no ""thanks for your patience,"" no comp for the drink we ordered while waiting, nothing. We already had a slightly bad taste in our mouth over this just because, if we're shelling out a bunch of money for a fine dining experience, we expect really great service and treatment. The hostesses definitely need better training at this particular restaurant.

Anyway, once we were finally sat, our waiter was quite pleasant and nice. As I mentioned, we went with the Thanksgiving prix fixe. We also went ahead and tried the Vaca Vieja ribeye steak (literal translation = old cow) since Jose Andres is said to be such a meat god. I have to say the Vaca Vieja was SUPER underwhelming. The cow is 8-10 years old and from my understanding gets old and fat in that time and develops a delicious beefy flavor. But the steak we got (although cooked to a perfect medium rare) was lean, tough, and underseasoned. I've eaten some amazingly delicious ribeyes in my life, and they tend to be fatty and delicious and crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth good on the inside. This just... wasn't. We actually ended up sending it back (which I swear we never do). Our waiter was extremely nice about it.
The Thanksgiving prix fixe was pretty damn good. Nothing stellar to report here, but it was definitely solid. 

The last point I want to make about this restaurant is the ambiance. It felt really cheap and corporate. The chairs at the bar that we waited in for 25 minutes must have been from IKEA as they were flimsy and wobbly. The dining table and chairs we sat at looked like they were secondhand. The decor in general felt like someone had said ""make it feel hip and modern, but don't spend too much money!"" I honestly think this is more of an SLS issue than a restaurant issue, because for example if you go to China Poblano (a cheaper Jose Andres restaurant in the Cosmo) it's amazingly well done inside and feels cool and authentic.

All in all, JUST okay. Not bad. Still have much respect for Chef Andres. I would not come back to Bazaar Meats, but definitely will be back to check  é (his other higher end restaurant) the next time I'm in Vegas which I have a feeling will be a much more fabulous experience.",b_4YDL8wV484fKBZdyaFUQ,1,0,3,Iih2t8IHLpLGbFoJUx8pYw

1322307,2014-11-11,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Hello. I'm a foie gras addict.

Bazaar Meat in Las Vegas is a definite dining experience. My friend and I ordered anything that involved foie gras off the menu and was not disappointed. 

Although the cotton candy and s'mores foie gras bought tears to my eyes, the foie gras soup warmed my heart and my soul that night. Honestly, I didn't think foie gras in soup form could be life changing but it was. I can be cliche and say it was a ""spiritual experience"" to drive the point home. Dramatic, no? I don't mess around when it comes to foie gras.

The meat, the pork, the chicken were all amazing as well.

Make sure to come here with people who appreciate good food because otherwise, its wasted on someone who thinks McNuggets is food of the gods.",zz-p13qe7pphd4JvYC3OTQ,0,0,5,0UgJBW6-GQWxlHkd5uOHww
1322672,2018-06-18,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"It's now been 2 days since our experience here. I have been putting off my review because I felt that if I started I wouldn't be able to stop. One could write a thesis on this place. The two most important points I can make are, 1: This was the best meal I have ever had in my life and it really wasn't close. 2: The service was impeccable. The Food: There was not one dish that was less than spectacular. We are from Seattle and are proud of our robust restaurant scene and we are fairly adventurous eaters. This was an experience that I believe will be the yard stick for future high end dining experiences. The tomato tartare was fresh and bright, a clever dish executed spot on. The Bison carpaccio was delicious and whimsical. The chefs selection of cured meats was unlike any charcuterie presentation I have had. The iberico ham was aged something like 36 months but had none of that ammonia funk associated with cured meats or strong cheese. It was like perfect meat candy. The other selections were amazing as well and ranged from smoky and spicy to sweet and fatty. The butter whipped potatoes where life changing (yes, potatoes and life changing.)....order them. The grilled octopus was a fun change of pace in between our ""turf-centric"" feast. It was crispy crunchy but amazingly tender and well balanced with a little acidic kick to brighten everything up. The cauliflower steak and grilled leaks were fun and delicious as well. Now, for the meats...we selected the Rosewood Angus/Wagyu Ribeye and the Wagyu skirt steak as well as a roasted chicken because one of us isn't big on red meat. The skirt steak was fabulous, the mustard sauce was so well balanced, it didn't overpower the beef as one might fear and the acidity of it played so well with the fat from the wagyu beef, so well executed. The star of the evening was the Ribeye and it delivered, it was about 2 inches thick with a perfect crust on the outside and an amazingly buttery center tender enough to cut with a fork. They put this awesome finishing salt on it with these large, flat flakes of sea salt that offered a little extra crunch from time to time. The best steaks I have ever had and I am one of those people that typically steers clear of steak houses because I tend to stick to the ""I can make a better steak at home"" philosophy.  The food... this place is good enough I'd hop on a plane to fly down for dinner and fly back after, its that good.
The Service: I can honestly say that I left in amazement at how well planned and executed the service was here. Our waiter was friendly and polite. Attentive but not pushy. The little things. When he noticed the first bowl of potatoes wasn't going to make it all the way around the table he brought another. He noticed this in a busy restaurant while serving several other tables. He brought it out and explained that he wanted us all to be able to try some, he didn't ask and i don't even know if we were charged for it, he just made it happen. That is attention to detail. The Bison carpaccio typically comes with five servings and our party was six, so he added one to the plate. The Sommelier was very nice as well. We are casual wine drinkers with an appreciation but not necessarily a deep knowledge of wines and he wasn't snooty or standoffish. He offered some information on the wine and we discussed the selection as it related to our tastes and that vintage vs others. Just really friendly and welcoming to someone that is a little intimidated by the wine selection process. I guess I can sum up the experience by saying that when the check was presented at the end of the meal, and it was not an inexpensive meal, the proclamation was ""Worth It!""",2UGUXE0VFb15pnJK5u8IHg,0,0,5,mtoGNqSkqndv7rbCvmR96g
1341206,2016-01-21,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Probably the best steak in my life. Not guaranteed in Vegas, where other values frequently trump the essence.

I was alone :-( and the maitre d offered a seat at the charcuterie bar as an option to a table for one. The bar is well laid out and I was gently embraced by the guys behind it in the experience and what they were doing. 

Smart, knowledgeable, and happy (not a sure thing in a top line restaurant!) they made the movie of my exposure a pleasure.

The service was fabulous, with a waiter who mixed solid founded professionalism with just enough personal reach to help me get to where I wanted to be.

The steak (after an amazing Spanish charcuterie appetizer - vegans need not apply but then you get that) comes from a farm in Texas - I got the sense they could name the animal - was presented carved off the bone. My rare it was, and gorgeous in the presentation, but more so in the mouth.

Absolutely perfect in every respect. A side of mushrooms (why spoil the red fest with green?) and glasses of wine recommended by my server complimented every bite.

Breathtakingly expensive as well... But it is not infrequent that one finds expensive in Vegas... It is thus kind of quality of experience and substance that is rare.

If you are an avid Jose Andres fan or Meat lover, this is your food heaven. 

You just know that dinner experience will be awesome when you are greeted by an enthusiastic server. 

Our awesome waiter, Chris kindly walked us  through the menu and we decided on the NYE prefix menu with A La cart. 

Bazaar has more or less traditional signature dish of jose with speciality on meat. 

Chef's selected cured meat was delicious but little too much for two people. ( Definitely suggested with group of 4+) 

I had to go for the cotton candy foie gras granted its banned in California for a good reason. I felt like a terrible human being trying it but decided not to think about it... #FOMO #YOLO.

The prefix meal was pretty incredible. I suggest the restaurant to reduce the serving portion and dropping the price a little to make it more available to wider audience. Vegas is really foodie heaven, especially to those who don't drink like myself.

We had the honor to try out their A8 Japanese Wagyu Kobe beef. It literally melts in your mouth and is worth every bite. 

There's less ridiculous props involved in this particular restaurant, but enough to make the experience triply bazaar and unique. It's worth deviating little further from the strip for the experience.",mcG523uA11CIk8OP4ieRGQ,2,1,5,WeMder7ss51r2h39gZga3Q

I liked the Beefsteak Tomatoes, they tasted like a burger with the iceberg lettuce. 

I was not a big fan of the Caesar, the anchovy was overpowering the entirety of the bite. 

But service is lacking. It was so slow. We had a reservation for 8PM, we got there 7.45PM and they were able to sit us around 8.15PM, without even an apology. 

I forgot the name of our server but you could see that she was really trying. It wasn't her fault. 

We got our first plate of food around 9.15PM, an hour after they were able to sit us. 

The food runners didn't even bother to put the food down properly on the table, and always seemed like they were in a rush with trying to explain what they just served.

It's big, its energetic, its exciting, whichever way you look you are amazed at what you see. From the showcase of the meats, to the open kitchen, to the decor right down to the execution of service. The whole place epitomizes talent. 
If you are familiar with chef Jose Andres, then you know he redefines food. He is all about that molecular gastronomy.  He literally breaks down food and reinvents it, with his own spin on it. Try the modern day olives...I'm not quite sure how to define the aftermath of eating one. Its a burst of olive amazingness that leaves you wondering, 'how the hell did he do that?!' 
The menu is nothing short of variety...so many options, all meant to be tasted and shared. I like the concept of small bites. You get to try numerous things rather than filling up on one specific dish. They hand selected specific farms for their meat selection, which to me, gives me a sense of comfort. How many other steakhouses let alone restaurants can give you a history on where the meat you are eating came from?! It gives you a sense of intellect that these guys know what they are doing. So if you do come across a dish you aren't so happy with, there's plenty more to compensate for your distaste. And even better is the management team is right there making sure you are being taken care of. 
I could go on and on...but give it a try for yourself. Again, its not just the food, its an experience.

He usually says ""tan and blue"" not black and blue. We ordered a steak and it was over cooked, but we were going to eat it. We didn't want to make a big deal and it was still a very good steak. Our server (Joe) was persistent, he saw that it wasn't what we asked for so he said ""Please, LET me get you another one."" So he brought out a new one and it was more cooked than the last one.

My friend had the Secreto Imberico (pork) which was out of this world, which them I got jealous and ordered the Waygu beef cheeks. Other reviews may say that it melted in your mouth, NO, THIS melted in your mouth. Unlike any beef I've ever had. They also have a dessert cart of many tiny bites, all beautiful, but we skipped it. No wine. Just the above, including tip, $165? All but the meats were small bites. 
  The place is stunning and it's a totally open kitchen. But you have to face it, otherwise you're looking at a wall. The staff was fantastic and very helpful. I'm thinking I will save up my calories and go back again at some point. I want to work my way through the menu.",HZYQoZfIvyuVjKUThw-o3g,0,0,5,XSy6pVRP7dX5DcqPwqnAww

Got two free dishes: old-fashioned/modern olives (bomb and I'm not an olive fan, 4/5) and the bagel lox cone (raw dill was too overpowering 2/5)

Here is what was paid for:

-beef & parmesan grissini carpaccio 4/5 interesting how it's presented
-classic beef tartare 5/5 my favorite of the night
-fois gras cotton candy 3/5 great concept
-suckling pig sandwich 5/5 tasty, great deal
-catalan spinach 4/5 pretty good
-delmonico potatoes 3/5 standard starch
-veal chop 5/5 excellent, so tender for being such a big cut

Definitely ate too much but I wouldn't know which dish I wouldn't order to try.


***2nd visit on 5/9/16***

Didn't want to repeat anything we got the last time. We didn't get any free appetizers this time. It was still a great meal with great service.

-caviar flight 5/5 just wow
-red oxtail steamed bun 4/5 more Asian flavor than expected
-bison buffalo style carpaccio 4/5 interesting complex flavor
-wagyu beef cheeks 5/5 my 2nd favorite of the night, tender asf
-braised lamb neck 4/5 great flavor, a bit salty
-robuchon potatoes 4/5 ... so rich, a lot of butter but tasty
-the vanilla experiment dessert 3/5... the vanilla sniffing was a letdown for the price.

Still in my top 3 for restaurants on the strip.",_7PfR6Tvh2xTbiVi1GELoQ,0,0,5,v6_sRKyqeGa_xjnqKNk3dA

Went with colleagues for dinner last week at Bazaar Meat and was thrilled with our booth directly in front of the open pit.  It was a cool, crackling ambiance through the evening.  We were then greeted by our server, Eric, and from the moment he arrived, he was the coolest, ever!  He was attentive and kind, personable, and called me beautiful all night....so that couldn't hurt.  It was authentic, and not in the least creepy in any way.

We began our meal with a few appetizers: Giant Chicharrón, Piquillo Peppers ""Julian de Tolosa"", and of course the Patatas Bravas! All items were delicious.  The presentation of each was modern and generous.  The Chicharrón were served with a yogurt sauce, but you have to ask for the hot sauce, made in house, that really sends these into the stratosphere.

While my companions were lured by the Wagyu steaks by the ounce, I went smaller with the Wagyu beef cheeks.  It was a sous vide pair, seared gently and served with mojo rojo and oranges.  I will say, it was good, but the bone in rib eye my friends ordered looked delicious.

Sides to die for were the Delmonicos and the Carrots.

Along the way, we were treated to a series of seemingly never-ending delights from the kitchen, on the house.  We had the most delicious carpaccio I have ever had, dish of the lightest, puffed croquettes with jamon and bechamel sauce and a few other things that swirled around the table in a delicious fog.

What a lovely evening we had.  Thanks so much for such a great memory!",laO_mhfqUQ9dFER3Q-5xcw,0,1,5,PtTh7_Pjf58-9QrYu9tjRQ

I got the croquetas de pollo, fresh oysters, the skirt steak, the mini sloppy Joe, the beef & parmesan grissini, and a glass of wine. 

The beef & parmesan was unbelievable! Order it. ORDER A LOT OF IT!!!

Almost everything was fantastic except for the steak (which I had been looking forward to most). In my opinion, it didn't have enough flavor and was a little too tough, even for a skirt. I ordered it medium, and it to me it was more on the rare side and may have lacked seasoning.

Above all, the ambiance, service, food, were all fantastic. I think I'll try a different cut on my next vist.

1505514,2017-07-24,3,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"This is the fourth location I try (Bazaar SOBE, Bazaar Mar, and SAAM at The Bazaar). I've yet to try a Jose Andres restaurant I haven't liked! 

Just like most of his other Bazaars, every decorative item mixes with the most unlikely textures and finishes to create a whimsical space. Located at the SLS, I arrived on time for a late Friday  10 pm dinner. It surprised me to find the crowd thinning out. What's going on, Vegas? Can't hang like Miamians? Our SOBE spot is full until the very last second. Odd. The vibe felt a lot more laid back too. Not a bad thing, just an observation. 

Although I'm familiar with the Bazaar format, the large and heavy menu still overwhelmed me. I will need many more visits to get through this one. 

WHAT I TRIED:

BAGELS & LOX CONE
FOIEFFLE
CROQUETAS DE JAMON
SKIRT STEAK/AMERICAN WAGYU
SECRETO IBERICO DE BELLOTA
BUTTERED POTATO PUREE
ASSORTED DESSERTS

HITS: The Foieffle with honey, peanut butter, and foie espuma. Oh lord! I will order that as often as I can and never tire of it. I can't stop thinking about the Buttered Potato Puree. As described on the menu, the puree is ""butter, butter, more butter, and some potatoes."" Perfect. 

BEST IN SHOW: Not surprisingly, the impressive Secreto steak always delivers. Order that anytime you see it on a Bazaar menu. Excellent taste and quality.

I've had the cone and croquetas before and I can't visit without them, so those were par for the course. 

MISS: Going in, I expected to be blown away by any meat ordered. The skirt steak was good, but nothing I can't get back at home (especially at any Argentinian restaurant). Perhaps we kept it too safe? Will hold on any further critique until I can return and order a whale of a cut. 

BIG MISS: No dessert cart for me. I know I dined late. By the time I was ready to order dessert, the cart had been emptied and rolled away. I missed it by maybe 10 minutes which leads me to think surely they could have held off closing it up until the last table ordered and experienced it? 1. I'm a huge dessert lover. I rather have dessert than an entree. 2. It's part of the magical Bazaar experience! Maybe even a little on the silly side, but I'm like a five year old when it comes to sweets. Instead, our waiter presented a simple tray with the dessert options. Ho-hum. Boring. Boo. BUT, all the ones I tried were at least truly spectacular. 

Service rocked. I loved our waiter. He made the night additionally fun with his insight and witty personality. 

Despite the over-the-top dining options in Las Vegas, I would go out of my way to return. Clearly, I'm a huge Jose-Andres fan. I must further explore that menu. Until next time...",-xr__Zqgwqhsfx0ThCn-ag,7,4,4,YTCpRXD1Ig2bmInJuHn_Og

The fatty parts melted in your mouth! Next was the suckling pig which is what were most looking forward to. Its expensive but totally worth it. I feel like I've never tasted pork until I tried that. It was PERFECTION. We also tried the mashed potatoes and grilled baby corn which was amazing but the suckling pig was the star of that meal. Also try the craft cocktails!

1541095,2015-01-07,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I was deciding between a 3 or a 4 but I've decided to give this place a 4. I think considering their quality of their meat products, I had to give it a 4. However, I would suggest you to only come in a party of 2-4 people or else you are just gonna be spending a lot and not getting full. 

The wagyu tartare was okay. It's probably the 2nd best I've had but still not comparable to the one I have at Craft Steak.
The butter over butter over butter potato puree: ohh goodness, heart attack. It was like a fluff of cloud that you can just sleep on. Might be the best and deadliest potato puree I've had. I would like that plate to leave it spotless.
Our waiter kept insisting we ordered the 1/4 pig and I think he might have overhyped it a bit too much. Yes, it was outstanding quality bc man they did cook it w/ perfection but it's like a roasted pig you would get at Asian restaurant where you paid 1/4 of the price. The skin was exactly like it but the meat were 8x better. I didn't know you can make a pork so juicy. However, I wouldn't recommend it. It was expensive and a lot of it were bones. 
The beef rib steak was literally top-notch quality. I had absolutely no problem eating the fat cause the meat was that great. Something you put in your mouth, and you didn't have to chew. They don't try to fancy you in anyway with their cooking method, they want you to taste their quality of the meat. 
Cauliflowers were also really good. Very meaty and the lemon went well w/ it.

As I said, I really recommend coming w/ a small party. I wasn't anywhere near full. Oh the thing that bugged me the most about this place was the wait for the pig and the steak. I think we waited an hour for it and that was the thing that bugged me about this place.

When you walk in you are greeted by counters of marbled meat and dead piglets hung by their feet.
I didn't expect anything less, I knew what I was getting myself into.

It was my husbands 31st birthday and we were here for the certified Japanese wagyu- grade A5

We frequent Japan just to go eat for a few weeks so when we heard we had a legit supplier in town I just knew I had to get my husband and my Japanese gma in here. 

THIS PLACE IS NOT CHEAP... but it is cheaper than flying to Japan.

Service is impeccable. Decor is odd, calming, amazing,and fun all at the same time.

Greeted by numerous staff members throughout the evening that seemed truly proud to be representing this chef.

We ordered all kind of stuff throughout the night but a few things did stand out:

The salmon appetizer, JUST ORDER IT. 
Salmon ""tartar"" which is actually just chunks of raw salmon and salmon roe atop avocado w/ furikake, served with nori chips. IT WAS SOOOOOOOO TASTY. My gma and I are fully prepared just to stop by for this and cocktail sometime in the future.

Uni w/ lemon foam was good if you like sea urchin, which I do. I enjoyed watching them prep it
*You can walk to different kitchen areas and watch the chefs and talk with them

Crab something or other salad- good, flavors that I wasn't very familiar with but throughly enjoyed the little kick

My grandmother and husband were raving about the Wagyu tenderloin
* I need to point out that THEY SERVED IT WITH A BONSAI TREE
I think that was pretty special... you don't even get that in Japan
But it was cooked table side just how they requested and my gma couldn't believe she can have this quality in Las Vegas. No more 12 hour flights for killer beef.

I ordered a 3 pound fish... it was good to ok... very fresh natural flavors which left me with a lot of fish and a lot of bland. I did get a few pieces of the skin and they were simply to die for but it left me wanting more. The amazing flavors that were seasoned on the skin, unfortunately did not permeate to the meat of the fish.

YOU MUST ORDER THE BUTTERY MASHED POTATOES.
butter, with butter, with more butter .... or something like that was the description.
THIS SIDE IS TO DIE FOR!!!!

We ordered some other things that weren't really worth mentioning.... but the salad dressing ( lemon flavored) def was worth a quick mention.

1612299,2014-12-16,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Our quickie at the SLS literally began with a reservation here -- we had not even checked into our room yet! We had tried The Bazaar in West Hollywood and loved it, so when hearing of this one opening up, it was added to our restaurant bucket list.

While briefly waiting at the bar for a seat, I ordered a cocktail that was as marvelous to watch being crafted as to taste: their Aladdin Manhattan ""Smoked"". It actually was mixed within a genie lamp, with a towel on top to keep in the smokiness, then ultimately poured into a glass with a large ball of ice. Mystical.

Onto the food! Once seated, we ordered up a storm. First was their Cotton Candied Fois Gras, actually spot on. I think the idea was to be deceptive, it tastes exactly like (and *IS*) Fois Gras, but may not look like it. Next were their Modern & Traditional Olives -- we'd had these in West Hollywood, too, but their so delicious. Any liquid emulsified version of a green olive that can burst in your mouth wins my vote.

Their Super-Giant Pork Skinned Chicharron was a fun project, to be hammered on the table! Probably was a bit much to eat, and we had more on the way, but absolutely crispy and flavorful.

My favorite item was their Bison Buffalo Style. When each of these thinly sliced portions was rolled up with various cheeses and servings atop it, definite bliss persisted! Might have been blue cheese, could have even used another one, but that it was used sparingly made it just right.

Two items, I thought were just okay. We had their Abalone with Ikura, which may have been tougher to chew than I would have preferred. Did like its mesh with vegetables. The other dish, their Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega (grilled octopus) was our second choice -- our first choice would have been the Morcilla with Uni (blood sausage with sea urchin), but it was no longer available that night. The octopus was okay texture-wise, but think they can improve upon paprika or cayenne sprinkles over potatoes. I do love octopus when it hits the right notes.

A bottle of Spanish Rosé of Pinot Noir accompanied most of the night, and we topped it with a dessert sampler. Very good start to a grand vaca! At least 4 stars.",RCKdmKDZRd-RovZVtNSCLA,0,0,4,iUaKiXTKG0dxAcQXXNff4g

The carpaccio on crostini was so good I thought about a retake instead of dessert. The chateaubriand is top notch and the Pernod sauce nicely accentuates it. The rubichon potatoes are to die for. The only mediocre dish was the Brussel sprout petals. While they were cooked and cooled perfectly, there were too many distractions. Suggestion for chef is to keep the lemon foam and only add black pepper. No need for apples apricots or grapes.

My family had never been to Vegas before this trip, and all I wanted to do was treat my family (and especially my father) to a meal they would never forget.  I researched about all the restaurants in Vegas for months before our trip.  Bazaar Meat was one of the few I finally narrowed down to.  What finally sold me was the fact that one of the managers, Chris Bugeya, and his guest relations team (Celina & Bree) patiently communicated back and forth with me via email.  They helped me create my own custom tasting menu for my family and accommodated a bunch of my ""special"" requests (e.g. making sure the customized menu wouldn't disclose prices, making sure my dad would receive a certificate for the kobe beef, etc.).

The night we went, I was met by Celina and she walked us to a ""private"" table which made our experience even better.  Chris was our server, and he was super attentive, friendly, and pleasant.  The food was spectacular.  The service was stellar.  I have nothing negative to say about this place.  Just know that you may be spending a good amount of money, but I am telling you that this experience was so worth it.  My family left the restaurant speechless, and my dad is never speechless.  Our experience as a family in Vegas for the first (and probably only time) will be a memory that will last more than a lifetime, and a large part of that would be due to this experience we had at Bazaar Meat.

I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to treat their loved ones to an experience they'll never forget.

I have visited twice when I was in LV on business and I've not yet been disappointed.  The meat is all very good, from the Spanish charcuterie to Rib Eye and the fabulous but oh so rich Kobe.  Expensive, but great.

The other dishes are more hits than misses, but a few things like the cold foie gras wrapped in cotton candy puzzled my palate and was less than stellar.  The vegetable dishes were all very good and the seafood raw bar is about the best I have ever experienced.

The sommalier is wonderful and really knows his food and wine pairings.  I ask the wait staff to allow the sommalier to make recommendations and custom wine flights based on what I have ordered and it's been perfect.

The negatives are relatively minor - the dessert menu is rather limited and there is too much reliance on chocolate, IMO.  The stone serving plates were beautiful, but some of them were chipped and cracked on my last visit.  As mentioned, the prices are a little on the high side but that's the new normal for high-end restaurants in LV.

Nice vibe to the place, strange, modern style, semi-loud and not so much intimate.

The beau and I have been dying to try it since hearing about their Vegas appearance!
Expectations were just a little TOO high after this first visit.

Overall, staff were friendly .. but the VERY, VERY casual attitude of our server was bit of a turn off. We are still at a high-end restaurant, I expected class and professionalism from everyone in the restaurant. 

Drinks we had :
- Truffles N Bees : I LOVE truffle anything! This was the perfect combination of citrus, honey, truffly, bubbly goodness!
- Magic Mojito : Magic, because the cotton candy dissolves when the drink is poured on top - other than that it's too sweet.
- Don't Be A Lemon : too lemony for me, but a pretty good palette cleanser.

Food we had :
- Cotton Candy Foie Gras : 98% cotton candy, 2% foie - playful but would like more of the foie
- THE Foieffle : air waffles, foie, peanut butter, honey - I really liked the texture but could use a little less peanut butter
- Croquetas de Pollo : REALLY GOOD, must try! Salty, cheesy, fried chickeny little bites!
- The Classic Tartare : presented and done table side, very entertaining. Beef, eggyolk, mustard comes with rolls ; would've preferred it on crispier bread for texture purposes.
- Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharrón : they don't kid around with ""super-giant"", definitely enough to share. Who woulda knew chicharron tasted SOO good with Greek yogurt!?
- Morcilla with Uni : Spanish blood sausage, fresh sea urchin (DID NOT WANT TO EAT, not my cup of tea)
-Wagyu Beef Cheeks : SUPER tender, SUPER juicy and tasty, melt in your mouth - MUST TRY!
- 8yr Old Holstein Bone-In Ribeye : DISAPPOINTED! I love my red meat and have had my share of different taste, quality and expectations from a good ribeye to a bad ribeye. Our steak was very bland, dry, very chewy .. Weird because it look medium rare but had the texture of well-done.
- Delmonico Potatoes : creamy but nothing special.
- Cauliflower Steak : loved the pine nuts and lemon with it but could've been executed better.

Desserts included Passion Fruit / Green Tea Cake & Salted Caramel Ice Cream, simple but rich in taste and texture, quality is there.

I really did enjoy the chicken croquettes, chicarron, and wagyu beef cheeks, wouldn't mind indulging in those again. But I can't get over the disappointment of the main dish, our steak. Our server's was pretty bitter when we had brought up our complaint, instead he brought us out a little bowl of salt, which did nothing to the steak.

The issue could've been handled better and we're not ones to ask for accommodations, but the bowl of salt might as well have been a slap in the face.

Suggestion, may be just sticking with the smaller plates instead of the not-so-big entree meats.",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,8,4,3,eCJ8USAgiDf184ibTU8t-Q

So bright and full of flavors definitely a new favorite. The table side presentation of the drinks and melt in your mouth A5 Kobe beef were such a treat. Desserts were sweet and just right.

  First the food.... what sets Bazaar apart from the others is not only how delicious the food is but how unique the dishes are. You eat things that you'd never think would work but they do! Foie gras s'mores or cotton candy foie, liquid olives etc...please look at the menu it's crazy. And presentation is whimsical and beautiful. 
  Secondly and just as impressive is the service. All the servers are awesome but for this review I'd like to take time to praise manager Pano. 
  Knowing it was our third trip here he went beyond our expectations to give us a marvelous experience.      First giving us a tour of the restaurant which included background on everything from the decor to Chef Andrés vision of Bazaar meat. We put ourselves in his capable(and knowledge) hands when it's came to ordering our food. He put together and perfect menu of cocktails and appetizers for us. He(and servers) explained not only the dish but a little story on it's origin(chicken croquets served in a tennis shoe for instance). 
   An absolute perfect experience... thank you Pano, Chef Andrés should be very proud of his exceptional and passionate employee(s)!",dvimMy_MNgBtAIKDP9TPaQ,5,4,5,pUBLTOS3UKCnein1sHgTEQ
1708188,2014-12-26,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"A confession: I planned a trip to Vegas just so I could try this restaurant. I mean, it wasn't too big of a stretch because I love Vegas, hadn't been yet in 2014, and it's not that long of a drive. However, my love of José Andrés goes that deep (I mean, as a chef. You know.) So, yeah, I might be a little biased, but this was nothing short of fantastic.

We made a reservation for 9pm on a Monday and when we got there had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated because they were running behind. No big deal: new restaurant, I'm in no hurry. My husband and I got a couple of drinks and took in the sights. Soon after, it was time to be seated.

Now, I love steak, but I didn't come here to eat a big slab of cow. I came here to get a lot of different flavors, so that's what we did. After having our server crack open a nice bottle of Verdejo, we started with the cotton candy foie gras. I'll admit it: I was a little skeptical. Sometimes people seem to like the sweet and savory mixture better than me. But I'd heard so many good things I had to try it, and when I popped it into my mouth it was pure amazingness. (That's what she said?) 

Next on the hit parade: a suckling pig sandwich. This was much larger than  expected. (That's what she said...again?) Well flavored pork, a bit of mustard, and some truly wonderful bread: I'd love to have this for lunch every day. The buffalo-style bison carpaccio quickly followed, which was a really nice experience. One of those dishes where you really get the flavors in sections when you take a bite: first some wonderfully fresh bison, followed by the wonderful bite of blue cheese, with some great celery flavor at the end. From the description I was expecting something a bit spicier, but this was very good nonetheless.

Given how much José talks about his love of vegetables, we had to get a few while we were here. The piquillo peppers ""confit"" came out first. This was a deceptively simple presentation that really brought out the wonderful taste of the peppers. The highlight of the vegetables, though, were the roasted leeks that came out next. Perfect flavor with a hint of chipotle in the sauce. I've had dreams about these in the time since our trip.

The overall highlight of the meal, though, came out next: the tortilla sacromonte. When I first started reading the description I was like, ""Omelet? Ehh..."" but then I saw kidneys, sweatbreads, and bone marrow and I was like, ""SOLD!"" And it did the opposite of disappoint. Such wonderful rich flavors brought together by the egg (and the raw one on top, even!) I could have gotten a whole other order and I'm not sure it would have been enough. 

And finally, our little dessert was the foie gras smores, because my husband is a bit of a smores fanatic. The fattyness of the foie gras, the delicious slightly melted marshmallow. It was (should I say it?) astonishing! A wonderful way to end the meal.

Was it expensive? Of course it was. Was it worth every penny? Absolutely. Do I want to go again right now? Definitely.",Wo_ASbM3pzJ4r1Qf6CcNOA,1,0,5,BJUV5VsfZ3RDvEhijU4j_w
1709188,2017-03-20,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We had dinner at Bazaar Meats last Thursday. My decision to go there was because, I read Yelp reviews and most of them seemed very favorable. I have not tried his place in LA or DC, so I was looking forward to this location in LV.  There were three of us, and one a European trained chef that worked in Asia and Hawaii. All of us, were not impressed with the food. 

We ordered Jose's Asian Tacos, nori with a slice of Iberico ham and a flying fish roe. This was very simple appetizer, one that did not give me any thrills. Next, we tried Bagel & Lox Cone this also was nothing special. I was still excited about the rest of dishes we ordered. There are four choices of potatoes under ""Potatoes"" category and there is another potato dish under ""Appetizers"". I ordered Papas Canarias, this was the worst potato dish, I have tried. These were, either, boiled, steamed or possibly baked white and purple baby potatoes that were served with two sauces: a red and a green one. I felt like I could be in a very rural area anywhere in the world, where people share what they have at home from the goodness of their heart, not a fancy restaurant. The asparagus was overdone. 
Next, we tried ""Beefsteak tomato"" tartare. I wanted to order a steak tartare but after the waiter recommended this meatless version, I thought why not. Once, again this dish did not tantalize my palate. 
The only place where I enjoyed an incredible tasting Maui grown tomato with a little dressing was Alan Wong's Amasia. I liked it so much, I ended up going two nights in a row few years back. 

Next, we tried Wagyu Beef Cheeks and this was very tasty. Lastly, our orders of A5 Kobe, A5 Wagyu, A5 Wagyu Tenderloin were delivered along with fresh wasabi. These meats proved to be delicious. However, if you have this kind of quality it would be hard not to enjoy the incredible taste. We did not like, however, Bone-in-strip loin grass fed angus, it was very chewy and few times, I had to spit the pieces that I could not consume. 
When, my friend asked about their desert menu, we were told that it was a cart that was in a different section of the restaurant at the moment. On the way out, we walked to have a quick look. It was nice and pleasing looking to the eye, but for someone who travelled the world and lived on three continents, it did not give the wow, I want it affect. 
In conclusion, I tried Bazaar Meats and satisfied my curiosity but will very unlikely rush to pay a second visit.",j3rnNLVIfKIJjMoAZO2Yuw,1,0,3,58GfWR5mOAQ9E4z51GzsVw

1714345,2015-06-04,3,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"What can I say except that Jose Andres is a genius. All of his restaurants offer a unique experience and by far has been one of the best dining experiences I have had. From the moment you walk in you are greeted with the aroma of the open fire grill where the meats are prepared. The decor is eclectic, whimsical but at the same time elegant.  Even the menu was beautiful made of black laquer decorated in a Baroque style. Just by the menu you knew you were in for a unique experience.  Most of the dishes are tapa style which are meant to be shared.  They also offer three different price fix menu started from $150pp to $250pp. Knowing that the dishes were on the small side we opted for the tasting menu. We really wanted to try his best dishes and knew this would be a good choice. We chose the second tier which was really way too much food, but we got to try a little of everything. The list is way to long and everything was exceptional so I will try and highlight our favorite dishes. Our first dish was the super giant pork skin chicharron. This is what I mean by unique. They place the chicharron on top of a piece of parchment paper and place it in the middle of the table and the waiter comes out with a mallet and starts breaking up the giant pork skin chicharron to pieces. Weird huh?  Don't be fooled this is no gimmick this is some serious tasting stuff. The next dish was the caviar flight. Each caviar and condiment was served in a beautiful glass sculpture which was stunning. Instead of serving alongside toast points it was served with puffed potato chips. The creme fraiche was served in a small tube representative of a painters tube. Very appropriate since the display was a work of art. These dishes were all very exciting, but the dish that took my breath away was the smoke and ice oysters and by this point I am suffering from sensory overload. I think there might have been smoke because of the ice used, but I can't recall. All I remember is an explosion of unusual yet delicious flavors, smokiness ,sweetness, and tart. The combination was phenomenal. The other dishes that are must haves are the croquetas which are served inside a paper cone and placed inside of a glass tennis shoe. This is a signature dish which he also serves at his other restaurant Jaleo. The next dish was the grilled Pulpo a la Gallega (Octopus) which was tender and grilled to perfection.  Now for the star of the show which is the steak. Amazing, but by this time we were stuffed. We were definitely way over our heads on this one. There were many more dishes and all were amazing. So a la carte or price fixed menu I don't think you could go wrong. 
The restaurant is amazing and a bit pricey, but well worth every penny. It is definitely the ultimate dining experience.",ut0_rAUnJYkrAKQKHxbH5w,4,3,5,grCClh-qzYKRhm4MREap8Q
1721281,2015-01-12,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Bazaar Meat hits all my reasons to try a restaurant...it offers foods preparation techniques and equipment I don't have, foods I haven't tried, and foods I can't find even in gourmet grocery stores. While I was amazed at the vast variety of meats, I was equally impressed by the variety of vegetables and how well they were prepared.  

My biggest criticisms: needing to close out the bar tab to start dinner in the dining area. The menu is obnoxious, not the dishes on the menu, but the menu itself. It is heavy and very, very unnecessarily oversized.  Putting two menus end to end on a table made for two, actually extended beyond the table. A little ridiculous and awkward to negotiate since it is a two-sided menu.  I was very careful flipping the menu over, ensuring I would not knock a glass or dish on the floor, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happens often. 

Foie gras cotton candy- whimsical fluffy presentation but in actuality a very small, but a very tasty bite.  Got to try it, but probably satisfy my foie gras craving with a different dish, but this popular item is checked off my bucket list.

Chicharron- Fantastic light crispy, not greasy...no gamey smell either.  The Za-atar  seasoning was nice, but maybe a touch more salt.  The yogurt sauce was delicious, creamy yet light and with a slight tang

Braised Beef Cheeks- by far my favorite dish of the evening.  Meat was tender, but the sauce raised the level of the dish. 

Suckling pig- just exactly the way I want.  Crispy skin and juicy, tender meat. Definitely a must try.  The inner most meat needed some sort of seasoning I know a sauce would be a distraction for this dish, but maybe providing a little dish of sea salt would be nice.  We asked for salt and it made a huge difference.

Leeks- I always loved leeks, and these leeks were so sweet and tender, and the charred edges were not bitter.  
 
Our waiter was very friendly, yet professional.  He had spot-on suggestions after getting a good feel for our tastes and preferences.

Our total was $800 for my family of 2 adults, 3 seniors, and 1 infant who ate his own baby food.  We didn't order any drinks and we are not big eaters.  We got the lobster, 6 oz Kobe beef, 1/4 pig, and a few sides/apps, and shared everything family style. 

The worst thing we got was the beef consommé which was inedible because it was extremely salty.  It was saltier than drinking full-sodium soy sauce.  We sent the dish back. Server said he will gave us a new one, but never did and still charged us for it.  I had to tell the server about the charge and he took it off. 

The best thing about here is the service.  They were nice about it that we had an infant with us.  Several staff even came to say hi to my infant son. Some steakhouse in Vegas won't take our reservation because we had an infant.  I also appreciate that they didn't pressure us to get drinks or gave us attitude about it. 

Lobster, Kobe steak, and Roast Pig were all delicious but not mind-blowing.  I remember Kobe beef in Kyoto was more fatty/melt in your mouth than at this restaurant.

The food is just okay. I like the suckling pig, but I wouldn't recommend it for parties of two. Even the small quarter portion was too much for us. It is just too oily and fatty to eat so much of it.  The other dishes were alright, but nothing special.

I had the summer tasting menu at $65. It's a bargain coming from one of the most celebrated chefs of Spain; a poor man's intro option to E by Jose Andres. The show starts with crispy chicharron pork skin placed in butcher paper, then cracked table side with a meat mallet and served with a yogurt dip.

Everything was excellent and  many of the cuts of meat you can order in whatever portion size/weight you want and are priced per ounce. Great specialty drinks and an amazing wine list. It may be considered pricey by some but the quality of the the food and level of service warrants the price tag in my opinion. The only drawback to this place is that it is inside the SLS which is decent but over hyped and WAAAYYYY on the far north end of the strip. I think in the long run the location will hurt this place.

Every single person on this perfectly put together and in sink team, each equally important in their role. Everyone was so  knowledgeable and offered exquisite service.  With that said !! I ordered the classic tasting menu. And every single dish on there was so flavorful and perfectly paired to make your mouth water!!! I can't say enough good things about this Restaurant.   I think the classic tartare was the best beef tartare I have ever had! So tasty. Then such a small yet still as important tapas, the olive and wrapped bagel lox, was so amazing. Even then endives Cesar salad was so flavorful, leaving you wanting more. Seriously everything I tasted there was amazing the chef even made me their Tomato steak-tartare and that was so fresh, juicy and flavorful. I don't think there is any wrong choices here. Right down to the amazing and creative desert and we can't forget the drinks. I had their smoked old fashion. I can with out a doubt say that is the best smoked old fashion I have tasted! 

Thank you so much to the manager Pano and Elias the meat captain who helped me with my choices and gave me the more then first class service.

The menu is meant for sharing, so that's exactly what we did. Went with the wife, so just the two of us, almost did the tasting menu but decided against it. Although it had a huge variety and there were two options, they were $200 or $250 per person depending on the one you got, and we would've ended up with some items we weren't interested in trying (asparagus) and would've had smaller portions of the meat. So we opted instead to go a la carte, and got two foie gras lollipops (get these, don't be thrown off by the cotton candy it works like a glaze), an order of beef carpaccio (pure umami meaty goodness), an order of the iberico ham (it was like the best prosciutto infused with walnuts), the ossetra/malossol/salmon caviar sampler (nice quality, but be careful with the condiments, I'd rec just using a bit of the creme fraiche, skip the onions) and finally the 16oz chateaubriand (literally so tender you could cut it with your fork). Had one side of potatoes (the cheese baked ones, can't remember the name) which were good but not mind blowing like the meat. If you are in a group with more varied tastes I would rec the tasting menu as it will hit the highlights and have something for everyone. If it's just a couple, consider doing what we did, it was about $175 per person (not including drinks of course) and we got exactly what we wanted and were super full. I haven't even gotten to the drinks, they were very creative, the cocktails are unique and varied. The best part was when they brought a wine bucket to keep my bomber of farmhouse beer from Deschutes cool during dinner. Wait staff deserve a shout out, they were super helpful, their timing was impeccable, each dish came one at a time which let you enjoy it at the right temp, and we were never rushed, never had to ask for anything, they were always there.

My only complaint and not worth dinging them a star is their wine menu.  It was nice, but was over the top, over priced.  I have many of the bottles they offered in my cellar and I know I what they cost. Double or sometime Triple on high-end mark up is common, but I say 5x prices on some bottles.

Service is stellar.  We felt listened to and taken care of.  Got relocated to the seating we wanted and didn't get a sour face when we didn't dig the champagne.  

Bathrooms are WAY in the back, but HOORAY for bathrooms IN the establishment. Some patrons were walking out to the casino to the loo, don't make that mistake.

The GREATS:
*Lucia's Caesar, such a whimsical spin on an old classic, flavor, texture, all there
*caviar, loved the presentation, creme fraiche from a tube of toothpaste, trout roe and osetra, need the traditional blinis, the fried pillowy puffs were overpowering
*Bluefin tuna sashimi, generous offering, just melted, don't dip in sauce, plenty of flavor
*Uni on blood sausage, SO good.  Every restaurant should serve this.  Surf and turf.
*Bison carpaccio, celery packed a whallop
*Desserts are small and not overly sweet, do the strawberry bacon and the cassis and rose meringue

OKAY:
*salmon tartare, WAY too much and avocado layer was overkill on the fat/cream, however the nori dusted shrimp chips that accompanied, were gobbled up
*Asian tacos, it was salt on salt on salt.  Nori does not go with jamon iberico

MINUS 1* for the terrible Kobe, $30/oz for 4oz cannot be ANY less than spectacular.  It tasted like how raw ground beef smells.  CHEAP ground beef.  Smearing wasabi saved it.  

It was nice we were surprised with an interlude: an adult sorbet, tableside.

Lots of choices on the menu, not a noodle, rice or doughy item on the menu.  If you want something starchy, potatoes people.  

I was squealing most of the meal.  In delight.  So much better than the original in the 90048.  Perfectly executed, conceptual food, but still TASTES good.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,6,4,4,ylDjn7zewZF0OzemI82mSw

1952370,2016-08-22,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Short version... I would never go back. There are way too many great restaurants in Vegas to go to this one. Don't waste your $$ here. 

I have been to many Steakhouses from California to New York. I've been to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Mario Batali's Carnevino, SW Steakhouse, Chops, Flemings, Chart House, Ruth Chris, Morton's, McCormick and Schmick's and many more... my point is... never in my life did I order a steak thinking I was getting 16 oz but it wasn't until when my bill came that I learn my steak was actually 2.25 lbs. We asked the waiter about it, and he was like, ""oh yah, we gave you the smallest cut we had and it was 2.25 lb. I thought I had mentioned it."" Um no... We wouldn't have ordered it if we had known. Had we known, we would have reduced the number of appetizers we ordered because we were so full, we didn't even touch much of the steak; the $168 piece of meat. (and you can judge for yourself from the picture... lots of fat!)

I know there are a lot of people like us whom are not rich but when in Vegas or on vacation, will splurge one time on a good meal. Every trip I take, I leave room in my budget to splurge on one good restaurant and I have always left feeling, hmmm, I'm glad I tried that. This place left a bad taste in my mouth.

I ordered based on reviews on Yelp, which has never disappointed but this time, I'm really disappointed. Maybe I went with too high of an expectation or maybe if I had order other things, I would have enjoyed it more. I will never know because I will never go back.

If you do go, don't waste your money on these:

Bagels & Lox ($6/bite size): it was no different than going to a sushi restaurant and ordering a flying fish roe. 

Cotton candy foie ($8/bite size): it looks pretty but what a waste of a piece of foie gras

Chicharron ($12 huge portion): crispy pork skin... that's all it was. (One of my favorite restaurants in Sacramento is The Kitchen, they make every daily food item taste amazing. One time they served kettle corn popcorn and it was the most amazing kettle corn I've ever tasted. I thought it would be the same with the chicharron but it wasn't. It tasted like the street one I ordered in Mexico for $1).

Smoke and Ice Fresh Oysters ($24 6 pieces): I can go to my local farmers market and buy some oysters for $0.40/piece, shuck it, eat it and it would have tasted the same.

The classic beef tartar ($32 good portion): it was just a ... tartar. People on Yelp said it was the best tartar that they have tasted... I've had much better! 

Morcilla Uni ($25 5 pieces): I love uni, but uni with blood sausage, this was disgusting; I couldn't even finish it. The uni didn't look fresh. 

Robuchon (butter potatoes) ($19): they weren't kidding about their description: butter, butter, butter, and some potatoes... this was disgusting... if you like eating butter... then you will love this dish. 

What was good:
Beef Cheeks ($38): super tender and flavorable
Boar sausage ($23): it was good  

I guess I'm just used to going to these restaurants and eating something that I would want to go back for; something that sets them aside from other restaurants.  Everything I ate was not bad but I feel like I could have gotten the same thing somewhere else and for cheaper.",-X5nuDjTcfWeUoR1vfWA1Q,6,0,2,hCJtbTIFWkhIcVqj675piw

Most steakhouses have a ribeye and a strip and so on, here they have a selection of ribeyes, no not just bone in or not but different breeds, different farmers, different aging techniques.  They have a 2 side by side grillworks inferno Argentinian style wood fires grills. Then in front of the grills is a display case showing their featured meats that have just incredible marbling, range of color depth depending on how long they aged and the breed.  They even have meat that comes from older animals for those interested.  Being a real meat enthusiast, I prefer to pick the exact steaks I wanted for our group and they happily accommodate.  So they get the meat going asap because they are thick and take a while to cook.  Being a real pro, I pre ordered a quarter suckling pig Which is the best I've ever had 2 times now. Suckling pig is one of my favorite things, so it's a good compliment.  Perfect crispy skin with zero chew and moist juicy meat. I got a bunch of the appetizers, they were all great, Reuben air bread, cheese in the middle is amazing.  Beef around a bread stick was great.  Tomato tar tar which was nice and the lightest thing eaten by us. Sloppy joes were good, but not worth the room it takes up in your stomach because your about to have the best meat you have ever had.

The menu is varied, from unique appetizers, to fresh oysters and, of course, wonderful steak selections.  We did the 7 course menu, with added beef cheeks, which was a great way to experience touches of the entire menu.  We started with the olives, traditional and pureed, which was a nice light start to the night.  The pureed olives was unique but not as good is the traditional pepper stuffed olives. Next, was the cotton candy with foie gras which was an amazing bite - sweet and salty with a punch of umami. Following that were the Apple wood smoked, fresh oysters.  Great oysters, and the light smoke added a unique flavor.  Next was one of our favorite dishes - beef steak tomato lettuce wraps.  I would eat these daily!  Our next two courses came out at once - charcuterie plate and steak tartare with Parker House rolls.  On the charcuterie plate we had the best chorizo we ever tasted.  The tartare was an experience - it tasted like sloppy joes and was such an outstanding dish that is immediately went in our mental queue of top dishes.  Next, was out dry aged steak and braised beef cheeks.  My wife loved the beef cheeks, which had a wonderful flavor but more of a tight sausage texture.  The dry aged ribeye was the second best steak I have ever had - flavorful, tender, perfectly cooked with a wonderful (again with that word!) beefiness.  The cook made the steak as you could taste the grill flavor which makes a huge difference over a pan fried, more broiled, steak. The desert course was pretty standard as it didn't stand out but was good, and light, way to end the meal.

I initially was going to take a star off for the wine list, as that was the only thing that we thought was blatantly disconcerting about our experience.  The wine list was lazy, as they had nothing but what we consider, expensive and pretentious wines.  It's easy to put together an amazing looking wine list when, almost,  every bottle is well over $100 and most really well above that point.  A good sommelier better be able to put the work in and add some great wines in the $50-$100 bottle range - if they can not then find a better sommelier.  

Overall, the experiences and food was outstanding, and minus the wine list, Bazaar is a place we would not hesitate to come back to.",oViqEqzfvZgvNZqNrvSK-g,0,0,5,WfRYhuCmoW2cWBgOWYHpHA

Bazaar Meats emphasizes their massive cuts of meat and 3 pound ribeyes, but Jaleo does many of the same or similar sides and apps better. I'd go back to Jaleo for better versions of everything except the meat dishes. Come hungry and leave the vegetarians at home.

DRINKS
Jose's G&T is always a good start, but the LN2 (more like an alcoholic sorbet than a drink) comes with fun tableside presentation. Did not care for Jose's Vespa or the Hemmingway.

STARTERS & SIDES
Ferran Adria Olives, Modern & Traditional: Got these again after loving the concept at Jaleo, but they were not as appreciated by our dining companions
*The Classic Tartare: easily one of the best dishes we had, one I would come back for. Made tableside and seasoned to your preference, the beef sirloin comes from retired dairy cows and is supremely flavorful. 
Vittore 1950 Carpaccio: accidentally received this after ordering the bison buffalo version, but kept it. A well-done classic with parmesan, croutons, capers, and sherry. I would still like to try the buffalo version eventually.
The Lhardy's Madrid Beef (soup): served in a tiny teacup, the consommé, quail egg, sherry, and caviar were underwhelming. Wouldn't get this again, it doesn't really work, and I don't understand why it's on the menu.
A simple tomato salad: There is such a thing as being too simple. Three or four cubes of various sweeter tomatoes, plus a light dressing and red onion. I liked the unusual selection of tomatoes but this dish seemed to be missing something. 
*S'mores: Homemade graham crackers and marshmallows plus chocolate and foie gras? This was a surprise hit with our more conservative dining partners! Should have asked for this at the end of the meal as it was better than the desserts we had and less fittingly placed as a starter course.

MEATS
Merino Lamb Rack, New Zealand: The version at Jaleo is better. This was unevenly seasoned, rendering some of the chops almost bland. The chimmichurri sauce Jaleo's version is plated with would have elevated this dish.
*Wagyu Beef Cheeks: Tender and flavorful meat was complemented by the citrus and slightly-spicy mojo rojo, which I wish there was more of (as others have said). Good choice.
*Braised Lamb Neck: Perfectly medium-rare lamb, juicy and well seasoned, plus fried oysters and fried potatoes. The oyster catsup was unnecessary because all of the other components were so well done. Recommend!

DESSERT
Everything is itty-bitty bite-sized, making our usual habit of sharing dessert difficult. The tiramisu crème puff disappointed the person who chose it, while the raspberry yuzu tart was interesting and fun. By far the favorite was the sea salt caramel crisp. 

Service was friendly and informative, if a touch too casual. The tableside presentation was fun, and the guy who worked with us was personable. Note that there are three (great-sounding) tiered tasting menus, from $150/pp to $275, this information is not present on the website.

Part of having the best experience here is going with the right group of people, and unfortunately the couple we dined with didn't seem to enjoy many of the items. My rating is rounded up to 4 stars from what is more accurately 3.5, as that is partially my fault. Less than half of our dishes (admittedly mostly classic options) were wonderful, while the other half was disappointing. I'll come back to split a steak with my guy (and try the cotton candy foie!), but I'm not in a rush to do so.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,10,4,QaeLo8BM3qIaXV9UV0LmVA

For the astronomical price we paid to dine here, the featured suckling pig was very mediocre.  In addition the ribeye steak was flavorful but lacked tenderness.

The appetizers and side dishes were very well crafted. The drinks were also excellent and hats off to the pastry chef for creating some very delicious desserts.


If we were to return, we would avoid paying $300 for a piece of pork and a ribeye steak to be shared and instead just stick with appetizers drinks and dessert.",DdQoHPbOjD61lC21m0mubw,0,0,3,8HoZYxfnV4nGOJqNS2oGJA

Like the name implies, this is a meat-centric establishment.The very first display is a Japanese Wagyu Beef certification statement that explains the grade of Wagyu used and it's authentication at Bazaar meat. As soon as you start walking towards your table, you will see the magic happening. It's like a live show of meats being cooked constantly in front of you and the various cuts before cooking. Although this place serves more than just steaks, you should really try a cut of something if this is your first time here. 
I do recommend trying any one of their salads. The presentation and arrangement of these salads are very unique and of course, very tasty. Additionally with your steak (of which I assume you're having), try the Robuchon potatoes. I'm gonna use the word 'dangerous' when describing this stuff. Also, 'incredible'. The desserts here are the only items that didn't really amaze me but they were still good. The outstanding wine selection will round out your evening. 
This place isn't cheap. If you get a full course dinner, you can run your bill up around $200 per person. To help you out, The SLS and this restaurant have a relationship with BMW of Las Vegas, and you can get a $100 coupon at this restaurant from the dealership when you purchase a new BMW.

2033874,2018-01-12,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"One of the top 25 steakhouse in the US, or so they say printed on the outside wall advertisement. As of this writing, Bazaar is also ranked #5 on Eater38 Las Vegas. We made a reservation for seven but it wasn't too crowded on a Sat night. Located inside the off strip SLS Las Vegas Hotel, you see the wood-fired oven as you walk through the restaurant. 

The setting was dark and classy and our server was courteous and sincere. She recommended the tasting menu which starts at $125, $185, $270 per person and the rule was that everyone must order at the same price level. We decided to order al la cart and our final tab came out just under $1000 just to give you idea on the price. 

Now if I was footing the bill, I probably give it 4 stars due to the fact the portion size is not too generous. If your hungry I recommend going to a $60 Caesars buffet instead. With price aside, the food quality is definitely there and is everything I expected coming from a $$$$ meat house. 

Popular item Chicken Fritters came out in a glassware shoe which was cool but I thought the taste was just ok. The items that stood out to my palate was the Buttered Potato Puree, best potato I've EVER intaked on earth. The signature dish was Suckling Pig was $160/quarter was just enough for seven people to share and make sure you get a crispy piece. 

This is the valley of steaks if your into that kind of thing. The variety of cuts can range anywhere from $40 American Wagyu to $400 Japanese Kobe Eye served on a hot stone. Try not to binge drink prior to this so you can actually taste the food. Also I recommend spending your money here early before donating it to casinos.

We ordered a dried-aged, bone-in ribeye cut from a 7-year-old animal: the flavor was sublime; not something you would ever experience from a younger cattle. A hundred buck steak that was completely worth it. 

The appetizers are creatively designed and skillfully prepared. Cotton candy went perfectly with the tiny piece of foie gras. The consommé is seriously the best I ever have anywhere bar none. Won't recommend the foie-waffle, though. 

The truly pleasant surprise was the dessert. We ordered the great-value, random Chef Selection and were blessed with ten pieces of expertly executed French desserts including innovative bonbons and cakes each with its own unique character and surprises. Didn't expect to find one of best chocolate bonbons I ever have in a ""meat bazaar"".

This place is phenomenal.  As you are walked to your seat, meat is being grilled in an open kitchen right off the lobby. GIANT cuts of meat. Like the one on the side of the Flintstone's car. JK

2100854,2016-05-24,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I usually don't give five star reviews for restaurants that I have only been once.   A dinner might seem better than it really is or, more likely, a restaurant may not be able to consistently produce great food.  

I think Bazaar Meat is a clear exception for a couple of reasons.  First, the ingredients and preparation were so amazing, that it seems impossible that the quality could suffer by repeat visits.  Second, the price and location are so restrictive, that I probably won't be going back any time soon. 

The experience then:  The restaurant is grand.  It sits at the back of the SLS hotel in Las Vegas and seems to cover half the building.  There are apparently five different ""markets"" or stations that prepare each different type of food.  The central ""market"" is the meat section and has awesome wood fired grills that, it's safe to say, would be the envy of any grillmaster anywhere.  The dining room is long and sparely filled with tables, where you feel that you are in an exclusive setting, even when the restaurant is full.  Service was also incredible, with our waiter enthusiastically describing each of our dishes, maintaining that thin line between being a professional and being wonderfully friendly.

The food... oh the Food!!!:  We ordered Jose's Way, a seven course tasting menu with all the best known plates.  

First course:   foie gras cotton candy.  The only plate I'd had before, at the Bazaar in Los Angeles.  I think the sweetness of the sugar and the richness of the foie gras goes very well.  But it is hard to take the large portion as ""one bite"" as you are encouraged to do and doing so really pushes the sugar of the cotton candy, overpowering the foie gras.

Second course: Olives classic and modern.  The olives have a wonderful taste and the two competing styles are definitely an interesting change in textures.  Really nice small bite.

Third course:  Caviar taster with creme fraiche in a small wafer cone.  I am not sure of the type of caviar, but this was absolutely amazing.  As I told the wife when she was hesitant to try it, there was no brininess or ""fishy"" taste to the caviar and the richness of the craime freche balanced the saltiness perfectly.  What a bite!

Fourth Course:  Smoked raw oysters.  The presentation is incredible, with a glass bowl covering the oyster plates holding the wood smoke inside.  The smoke comes out and smells wonderful.  The oysters are sweet and smoky.  I don't think I've ever had a better oyster.  

Fifth Course: Tartares.  We were given both the classic taratare in a parker roll and the beefsteak tartare.  Both were amazingly tender and fresh.  The freshness of the beef... it felt like eating a bit of blue fin tuna, with the same color.  Loved both.

Sixth Course:  Charcuterie.  Certainly, all the dried meats were good, although I would say that the only standout was the blood sausage.  Everything else I could say, I've had before. 

Seventh Course:  Ribeye, grilled baby corn and Robuchon's mashed potatoes.  The grilled baby corn was really spectacular, a little crispy, saltiness, a little bit of richness from the sprinkled mayonaise.  The ribeye is perfectly cooked, perfectly aged, wonderfully tender and smoky.  The absolute star of the show, however, was the mashed potatoes.  With a description of ""butter, butter, more butter... and some potatoes"", they are definitely not the most heart healthy selection.  Nor, of course, is this the most sophisticated of plates... it is quite literally a ton of butter and some smashed potatoes to hold them together.  Except you can't stop eating them.

There were some additional little bites for dessert, but by that point, of course one is completely stuffed.  

It was a wonderful, memorable dinner.  The price, of course, means that you have to remember it, because you can't possibly afford to do this very often.  For special occassions, this meal is definitely worth the price.",Xq6W2KM27mEBFJ7pgpFMmA,3,3,5,AduVaMVllw7aBVsPancQJA

We ordered a tasting menu, so we got to try quite a few of Jose's best items.

My favorite items of the night were:

Wagyu carpaccio wrapped parmesan stick, with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm usually not a carpaccio fan, but this was fantastic.  

Chateaubriand was served table side, medium rare.  It had an amazing light crust, just as it should.

When the mashed potatoes were delivered to the table, he announced to us that they were two parts butter and one part starch.  He described them as decadent.  He was right.  I'm a German from South Dakota, which pretty much makes me an expert on mashed potatoes; these are the best that I have ever had.

Items that I did not care for were:

The salmon roe and a cold tomato bisque.

I will give you that it's the first week of operation but come on, you don't bring the entree literally 20 minutes before the sides and you don't replace some of the party's silverware and plate ware and not the other halfs.

I will go again in a few months to see if things have improved but until then it's honestly 2 stars compared to it's competition. 

My bonafides: I've also eaten at most of the major steak places in Vegas as well as across the country. I've also eaten at Robuchon with Robuchon cooking for our table, Guy Savoy, Latalaier, Alex, Le Cirque, E', etc etc etc.

UPDATE: I took Yassine, the GM, up on his offer for another meal for my friend's deployment going away party. The service was very good which is what you would expect if the GM is arranging your res and he kindly comped some of the meal. The chef sent out some apps: cotton candy, croquettes, chicharron, and we ordered the tartare. Shared the strip steak and pork loin for entrees with a variety of sides. Food again was hit or miss with the pork loin, for example, being very dry and while everyone was very nice, still had some service mishaps with the sides coming out well after the entrees, for example. I gave them another star (understanding that the GM personally invited us back) but they still have a ways to go to compete with others at their price point along the strip.

I've been to Bazaar in LA, Jaleo, and É, so I think the element of surprise has subsided for me. I think Bazaar Meat is a great restaurant for special occasions and puts on a great show for first timers.  They make some drinks tableside, including one with liquid nitrogen (more like a lemon sorbet) and one with cotton candy. But tricks aside, the food is still spot on. 

Our waiter described the menu in detail to our table of 9, and suggested pretty much doing 2 of everything. Most dishes are designed to feed groups of 3-5, and it's hard to share 1/2 a bite each. 

We started off with the cotton candy foie gras, Jose's Asian taco, Reuben, croquetas de jamon, giant chicharron, patatas bravas, chefs selection of cured meats and the toasted pan de cristal with fresh tomato. I'd say that my lesser favorites were the ""taco"" and the patata bravas, but each dish is only a bite per person anyway so it's worth the try. 

We ordered 2 of the Rosewood Texas Wagyu Beef Rib Steaks, and I think it was overhyped for me. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, but I expected a lot more flavor from a ribeye.  I think that it's good if you're craving steak, but it's not the best ribeye I've had. Keep in mind that you are charged for the steak per pound with the bone in, so it does come out to be pretty expensive. 

We also ordered the Butifarra spiral, which is pork sausage served with tomato toast. The aioli was a really delicious pairing with the sausage, and this dish definitely made sure we were full at the end. We also had the potato purée which was loaded with butter and very tasty. The cauliflower side was pretty good, but the Brussels sprouts petals were just Ok. 

Lastly, dessert. There's a dessert cart that they wheel to your table that makes you wanna try everything. And we really did try at least 10 different desserts and all were delicious. It just depends what you're craving: chocolate, caramel, fruit tarts, smores, etc. 

I want to thank our server and the restaurant manager, Pano, for making our dining experience amazing despite the restaurant being very busy that night. We will be back again, especially to try their happy hour!",dY6GK465j-kLlrXalgdsNA,2,0,5,16vEWtMqJdpZdBzOvqWBGw

- Service was slow/inattentive - we had to ask for water (tap) several times, plus our wine didn't get served on time for our entrees
- Pacing of the dishes was off - we had several dishes arriving at once, so it was hard to enjoy everything while it was still hot. This was after we asked about pacing when we ordered.
- Terrible wagyu dish - out server said that they braise it for something like 20 hrs. It tasted like overcooked liver. We sent it back. 
- Vegetable dishes were under-seasoned and not cooked evenly
- The dining room was super hot - we understand that it's an open fire cooking place, but other places like Metropole in Cincinnati do this without make the entire place into an inferno
- Our check ended up having the wine from the table next to us on it - it was corrected, but without much apology or concern given that it was a $150 bottle

That said, there were a few great dishes - classic tartare, giant chicharone, and the foie gras cotton candy.

Everything I've eaten here has been so good. They have some items that are best suited for adventurous eaters, but also a lot of mainstream items. My go to's for the sides are the Brussels Sprout salad and mashed potatoes (I'm not exaggerating when I say they're the best I've ever had). 

They have a great cocktail list and are always ready to offer suggestions. My boyfriend likes the smoked drinks. Cool presentation. 

Save room for at least a bite of dessert. A cute dessert cart comes by with a lot if different options.

The restaurant's ambiance is beautiful and unique, with crazy sculptures and busts of various animals as well as a chic vibe. I had a drink at the bar (I cannot remember the name, but it had the word ""bubbles"" in it). Regardless, it smells like truffles and has a truffle aftertaste, but was overall different and tasty. The bartender also came up with a unique cocktail concoction for my friends, made with Mezical and jalepeno.

So of course, you should know first off that this is not going to be a budget friendly meal. The portions are small (tapas style), unless you get one of the big meats, which are extremely expensive. Regardless, we still had a very pleasant meal for 5 without breaking the bank ($280 + tip). I would probably eat a little something first, though.

The standout for me was the lamb, served with fried oysters and potatoes. The lamb was rich and extremely tender, the oysters were buttery, delicious, and fried perfectly, without too much breading. While the portion wasn't huge, it was actually big enough to stand as an entree on its own. We also tried two of the potato dishes, and the Delmonico was indeed the winner- cheesy potatoes win every time!

Even the chicken croquets were yummy, served in a whimsical ""shoe"", they had lots of flavor, and again were not over breaded or fried.

Our server started off as ""typical fine dining server"", but by the end, we transformed him into hilarious hipster server with a bit of a potty mouth- we loved it!

I was a little disappointed that we mentioned that it was my birthday, wondering if they could do anything for it. They brought a rich dark chocolate mousse dish with a gold flake, birthday candle, etc... and it was on the bill! Uh... yeah, might want to give a heads up on that one- if that was going to be the case, I would have chosen my own birthday dessert!

All in all, it was a good experience, and I would like to get the suckling pig next time- on someone else's dime!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,1,2,4,B13NtrgkJtl7iATbHM05Kg

The service is really great however I hate to say it, the meat was my least favorite part. We tried this place for restaurant week and the restaurant was packed, but I feel that it shouldn't compromise the meal. The food was taking an extra long time and so we had a glass of wine on the house but we ran into a group of friends that were comped the same thing so it was probably a rough night. Our steak ended up on the cold side and really chewy. But on to my favorites, the cotton candy foie gras was such a unique taste I loved it. The buttered potato purée was my very favorite but be warned it's extremely rich and creamy so a little goes a long way. Our table really loved the button mushrooms too. The dessert has little bites of chocolate so it was difficult to share but there was lots of variety.

He's patient, knows food, knows the 3-8 menus you'll look at while you're there (crazy number of menus!!!), and he'll ensure you have the perfect experience. 

Start with the gin & tonic. I'm not even a gin & tonic gal and it's one of my favorite drinks of all time, but only from Bazaar Meats. Start there and then find the right wine pairings for your meal. There is a page of wine by the glass to choose from, not a ton, but if you're the only one wanting wine all you need is a glass or two. Let's be real - you'll need red wine to go with your meats. 

Automatically order the cotton candy foie gras when you order your drinks. It's like a bite of sweet whimsical butter. Your tastebuds will be inspired. Then you've got time to be walked through the menu with your senses engaged. 

Don't even peruse the menu(s) until your waiter walks you through them. It's overwhelming. If you're a first timer - start with a tasting menu. They normally have 3 tasting menus at $150, $200, or $275. The $200 is my go-to, main difference between that one and the $275 is the sucking pig. 

I forget what it's called but there is a table side sorbet you should get as a palette cleanser. It has booze in it, if I'm remembering correctly. Either way - this is more of a bonus than a must have. 

These are my favorite items I've had: the croquettes de pollo, the carpaccio with Parmesan, the caviar flight, the cold smoked oysters, Chateaubriand, sucking pig, grilled pulpo (octopus), classic tartare, geoduck. 

I won't go through all the veggies, but they're all good. You must order their mashed potatoes, as in must. Did I mention must. Go ahead and get 2 orders if you've got more than 3 hungry people. 

Desserts - yes please. Just get whatever you're feeling and you'll be happy. 

My least favorite orders are few, but they weren't worth the ordering in my experience. The chicharron was a giant mess of fried pig skin. It gets everywhere and is forgettable. The other disappointment was the Lindsay Ranch. It's pricey and the flavor was mild. For $95/lb there are better items on the menu. 

I feel like I always end describing the decor. It's the fat kid in me. I love the feel and appeal of Bazaar Meats. It's a mix between somehow glitzy random as hell and a hunting expedition. You'll see.",IeWFnxmk344iIbl5-M5RPw,3,1,5,ZBzHoi_7ygyq8ihmF1Q_Mw

The octopus was so tender, and we also ordered several vegetable sides as well. The Robuchon potatoes were fantastic, I have never had mashed potatoes so creamy in my entire life. The brussel sprouts were actually my favorite of the night, usually I'm accustomed to roasted/charred brussel sprouts but this preparation was so light and refreshing.

Had been to the Bar Centro before and had the amazing Foieffle, Cotton Candy Foie, Sloppy Joe, Uni and a few delectable drinks...debated if going to the actual restaurant would be worth it since it seems not so much molecular gastronomy happens.  Just more of a 'carnivore's paradise.'  And oh, is it ever...with just enough finesse to be typical José genius.    

Already having researched the extensive menu, my boyfriend and I decided what we wanted before we sat down.  However, we were offered 3 tasting menus...went with the ""mid"" range priced one because it had everything we'd wanted to try and more for what seemed to be a bargain (including the insane $70 jamón ibérico that we would NOT have ordered a la carte)!  If you're not familiar with the restaurant concept, look at the menu beforehand.  I may have missed some courses, but what I remember:

Ferran Adriá Olives-JUST like in that Bourdain episode...*eyes roll to the back of your head*
Crispy Chicarron- fun to break at the table, tasty w/ the yogurt, but other than the presentation  nothing special
Caviar Flight- beautiful, balanced/delicate, great selection, fun to assemble in the pomme soufflés
Caviar Cones- delicious
Smoked Oysters - so flavorful
Vittore 1950 Carpaccio- WOW..textures, balance of flavors, melt-in-your-mouth 
Jamón Ibérico- OMFG...can every animal be free-range, acorn fed?  Savored this as long as possible...every bite I had a moment of silence with eyes closed as the nutty,caramel, meaty flavors melted on my tongue. Sounds dramatic.  But the flavor is dramatic. 
Classic Tartare- Surprisingly so enjoyable, very vibrant flavors, amazing presentation. Hands down the BEST beef tartare we'd ever had.
Gazpacho- good, nothing special
Croquetas de Pollo- good, nothing special, just like at Jaleo
Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega (Octopus)- So well balanced in flavors.  I normally don't like octopus, but this is prepared so perfectly, not rubbery/chewy at all.  
Butifarra Pork Sausage-- SO good...with the pan de cristal, this ALONE could be an enjoyable meal
****Now...at this point in the meal, we were SO stuffed.  Amazingly full, to the point where these last several dishes were just unnecessary. They just weren't even enjoyable.  HOWEVER, we agreed pretty easily, that if we had ordered these without having eaten anything before...we would've been pretty disappointed.  
-------
Rib Eye-- really dry, super tough yet chewy, severely lacked in flavor.  Not sure WHICH cut we had...but wow, I'm sad to say it may have been the worst steaks I've had in a restaurant.  
Bouchon Potatoes- creamy and buttery as reviewed by so many
Asparagus- well cooked, but nothing outstanding about the flavors
Carrots- same as the asparagus 
BOX of dessert (11, ELEVEN!!, different treats)-- should've just taken it home, but wouldn't have kept well since we weren't going home until the next day :)  The bon-bons and tarts were delicious...everything else was okay.  

Despite being disappointed by a few courses towards the end, there were enough stand-outs to rate this as an amazing dining experience.  Our drinks (When Doves Cry [the signature], Gin and Tonic, Manhattans) were great. Ambience and service were great.",bFzfIButYeb46C8g_hcn0Q,1,1,4,KpjRI3scy7DR09cWuLATMQ

We ordered two meats - rib eye and the suckling pig. Both were served on tall platters. It made it a little awkward not being able to see the person across the table. We kept ducking and giraffe necking to have conversations lol. 

Anyways, for appetizers, we got the dozen oysters, charcuterie plate with bread, and sea urchin. The sea urchin is a must! I've never had sea urchin that good!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it again.

Our main course included the Rib steak (washugyu/angus). We ordered 2lbs, which included the bone, so as you can imagine... there wasn't very much meat. It came out pre-sliced but it was a little cold. Not very much flavor but still good. We also ordered the 1/4 suckling pig. It was amazing! Super crispy but fatty on the inside. I couldn't eat more than one piece though. 

For sides, I can't remember exactly what they were but there was an apple/salad plate, potato dish, and a brussels sprout dish. They were all pretty tasty and helped balance out all the meat.

For dessert, we got an assortment of truffles, candy, creme puffs. Refer to the picture, can't remember what each of them were. I was a big fan of the hazelnut one. Tasted like a Ferrero Rocher creme puff!

Oh and can't forget the cocktails! First one I had was the cotton candy mojito! It was good but a little too sweet for me. The second was a hit! New York Sour! Get it!!!",3r9BVzKJ7jA4SCDgjhBzZQ,3,2,3,BZsWpYKyeE8zluRveMtNuw

We decided to try out the SLS hotel's Steakhouse since it was conveniently located at the hotel we were staying at. The waiter was selling us on the $170/person tasting menu where everyone at the table had to agree on ordering, however, not all 10 of us were up for it. So we decided to order several dishes to take a bite out of. His tone of voice changed when we declined the tasting menu, but overall, I was very satisfied with the presentation and taste of all the dishes we ordered: 

MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE DISH was the Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharrón with Greek yogurt and za'atar spices. The slight saltiness of the Chicharrón accompanied by the sweetness and spices of the Greek yogurt definitely left my taste buds dancing with joy. 

The Salmon roe (a tartar dish) with capers, yuzu, soy sauce, avocado, wasabi and seaweed crackers was also a delicious starter!

For the entreé, we shared the following:
- Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus
- Merino Lamb Rack, New Zealand: Oak-wood fired
- Grilled Baby Corn with Mayonnaise, chile piquin, popcorn powder
- Brussels Sprouts Petals with Apricots, grapes, lemon air (foam) and lemon purée
- Setas al Ajillo which are Button mushrooms, garlic, nasturtium
- Lucía's Salad which is an Endive Caesar salad, Parmesan, anchovy, air croutons

Drinks I recommend: 
- Jose's Gin Tonic: Hendrick's gin served with Fever-Tree tonic, kaffir lime leaf, lemon peel, lime wheel and juniper berries
- Magic Mojito: Bacardi Superior rum, mint, lime juice, strained over cotton candy 

If we weren't going to a pool party the next day, we would have for sure tried the suckling pig. Everything from the drinks, appetizers, entreés and desserts were absolutely divine!

2341063,2015-01-26,4,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I read an article from Food Republic published October 22, 2014 called ""The Vegas Beef Battle"", which said that the Wagyushu beef rib steak served at Bazaar Meat from a ranch in Lindsay, Oregon was some sort of unique hybrid super steak that combined the marbling of Japanese beef with flavor of Midwestern corn-fed beef. That sounds impressive, but don't believe the hype.

First off, credit where credit is due - this is an impressive space. The interior of Bazaar Meat is certainly a sight to behold, with the glass cases housing delectable looking cuts of meat. 

And I had no problem with the appetizers. I ordered the morcilla and uni. The morcilla was softer than expected. Like really soft. The uni was good, but it was pretty much like regular uni except with a miso glaze. This dish also had slight sprinkling of miniature salt crystals inside.

But as for the main event, well, this left a lot to be desired. First off, it took quite a while for the steak to be brought out, perhaps 45 min plus. I was seated shortly after 10pm but I didn't receive my entree until 11pm. The temperature was lower than I was expecting, and there was no sizzle. The waiter Eric explained that's how they do it - they let it rest for a bit in order to keep juices in. I have never heard of this practice before, but whatever. The flavor was good, but overall it wasn't as good as the Japanese Wagyu I had at Cut in the Venetian. I found that this beef was not really that much different than a good ribeye in NYC. It was maybe a little bit softer, but the marbling was not nearly as extensive as I expected and the steak didn't softly acquiesce and melt in my mouth like true 100% Japanese-imported Wagyu does. If this was the best steak in the house, consider me unimpressed. Go to Cut or SW instead.

The nail in the coffin was that the steak was much more expensive than I thought. The menu said $95 per lb., so I thought I was getting a 16 oz cut. But when the check came it said 2.25 lbs., which was not made clear to me at the outset. I find this very deceptive. Then the waiter mispronounced my name at the end. I can't see myself coming back here - at least not on my dime - because the value just isn't there.",kJnbLIPdJ6QOu_USBdfuZA,4,1,2,wVh13xrUBL9B7hxciQbGKg

We did a mix of 3 starters, 2 meats and a side and were stuffed. Had to skip dessert. Absolutely loved the jamon croquetas - have not had anything better since leaving Spain!
The Ferran Adria olives (copy of the El Bulli/Tickets one) were a disappointment if you've had the real thing. Would not order them again - not bad, just not that spectacular.
The sloppy joes were tasty with the crispy topping - different twist on a casual dish. Would skip this next time.

Loved our meats! The choices are somewhat overwhelming! The sausage with the pain con tomate is classic Spain. Loved this. The rib eye was more American but well flavoured and it's nice to sample a variety of meat here. The garlic mushrooms were a perfect side.

I'll cut to the chase: stick w/the appetizers and forego entrees. Of what we got (in order of preference):

- Chicken coquette (out of a plastic shoe), grassini (beef carpaccio w/onion seasoning wrapped around a bread sticked w/parmesan dip) and chefs choice charcuterie were rather yummy and enjoyable. 
- Beef cheeks was nice and tender but nothing to write home about.
- Foieffle was ok. Peanut butter was a bit overpowering.
- The giant chicharron felt a bit gimmicky and a bit much for the two of us after a few days of nonstop gorging in Vegas.
- The $100-Wagyu rib eye was utter disappointment. It's supposed to be the tastiest cut but we found it bland and had to ask for salt to make it bearable. We didn't finish this dish.

2371743,2017-05-12,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"To be honest the only reason we are giving this review the 2 stars was because our server was so great and understating. My GF and I are extremely well traveled and hail from NYC and Boston so we are no strangers to fine dining....I'll start by saying that we thought we where walking into a steakhouse but what you are really getting into is a tapas restaurant that serves steak. This place is also expensive even for a Vegas restaurant but hey it's vacation and the reviews where so good we decided what the heck. 
Again if you are looking for a traditional steak, something from the likes of Burns, CUT, Flemmings, Smith and Wolensky, etc than this is NOT the place for you. If you are in the mood to sample a menu of mostly unusual cuts of meat that are sold by the ounce/lb then come here and go crazy. I'm by no means a foodie, just a guy looking for a great steak cooked the way I want, what I got was a very tough rib cut that was more sinew then anything. Our other steak was an extremely rare chateaubriand which was ordered medium by the servers recommendation as she stated all the steaks here are served on the rare side .... rare was an understatement as we couldn't even cut the meat (which could just be bad knives but who knows)
The apps where good not OMG as where the drinks. 
The saving grace of the night was our server who graciously took one of the apps and steak off the bill when she realized neither of us touched either one. 
Again I can't beat this up enough ....big shame on me here :
Should have set my expectations differently by realizing this wasn't a traditional steakhouse in fact it doesn't even come up when you search for steakhouses in LV. 

Bottom line is after a meal like this I would tell anyone who asked to avoid this place but again, based on my comments above and kudos to our server, I will simply give honest feedback when people ask for recommendations.",mhfQgCPo8-xk5Ds6Gv_tcw,0,0,2,m04UhYK_vrnqC3CdGSwKmw

2388641,2015-10-30,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Bazaar Meat is a fantastic metaphor for Las Vegas: a beautiful excess of treasures from around the world, jammed into an absurdly hip place complete with absurdly expensive drinks. While the prices might seem excessive, 7 of us ate until we were nearly sick, each had a cocktail, split a bottle of wine, and the bill split 6 ways was around $180 each after tax and auto gratuity. For the sheer quantity of food it would have been an amazing deal, but it was the quality that made this seem like a bargain.

The restaurant is in essence 5 kitchens all serving 1 space so the menu spans from a raw bar, to molecular gastronomy, all the way to meats over a fire pit. Everything, with the exception of the little starters, is designed to be shared. I'd suggest ordering 1 meat, 1 side, the Robuchon Potatoes, and 2-3 starters per 2-3 people. We obliterated that and our stomach paid the price.

Do not miss: Cotton Candy Foie: Such an interesting delicious bite and a great way to start the meal.
Beef and Parmesan Grissini: Tender savory beef draped over breadsticks and served with the most amazing parmesan dipping sauce.
S'mores: S'mores stuffed with Foie Gras. It's is as delicious as you think it is weird, which should be a lot.
Robuchon Potatoes: Fabulous butter sauce with a drizzle of potato. We had 2 orders for 7 guys.
Lamb Neck: What a steal, tender and packed with earth flavor and it comes with fried oysters!

Totally Worth It: Quarter Suckling Pig: If you dine on swine it might not get better than this. I prefer the skin on Chinese roast pork, but the flavor of the pork is unbeatable.
Rosewood Ribeye: It's a giant Ribeye... Enough said.
Both Croquetas: Perfectly fried potato treats, but I'd go with the Jamon if you have to pick.
Classic Tartre: Another great value here, the portion is MASSIVE. Creamy and eggy served with warm fresh rolls.
Roasted Leeks: A nice break from meat and the bite helps clear the palate.

Missable: Foieffle: How to ruin Foie Gras, cover it with peanut butter. All you can taste is the peanut butter!
Giant Chicharron: Its fun to smash and the dipping sauce was great. But there isn't anything special about it.

Well I hope that helps anyone who was trying to decide what to order. There is so much to try here that I might just have to come back!",Bp6kCG0W9BV2oa2XhumKkA,4,1,5,0m2JL34h1Jg8URWFRwULPg

We enjoyed snacks and drinks during happy hour in the bar and continued eating all the way until dessert.  The aged tomahawk ribeye was delicious as was the suckling pig.  The downside is that it is quite expensive and difficult to realize what the cost will be because the meats are priced by the pound.  With the compulsory 20% tip for 6+ people, it was $150 each.  The only negative is that my hair stunk from all of the meat smoke - not sexy.  The primary cause was that a table nearby ordered some meat that was grilled tableside and there probably was not any ventilation above their table.  Our waiter Chris was excellent, although I did have to push back quite a bit on the portions he recommended.

2408817,2014-11-04,35,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Located inside the newly erected SLS Hotel in Vegas, José did not hold back with construction on this massive restaurant.  Once you pass the grand entrance, drama abounds as you're invited into a dimly lit space that's very much like the Bazaar in Los Angeles with interesting chachkes baubles and distinctive chandeliers of various shapes and sizes.   

While our table was being prepared, we opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few fascinating cocktails crafted by the bartender. 

Moments later, we were escorted to our table where our server Nick introduced himself. 
Nick was warm friendly and offered some thoughtful suggestions from the menu. On that note, I'd have to say my experience was elevated to VIP status because he was quite the accomplished server. He was very attentive and made every effort to check with us throughout the evening and ensured our experience was nothing less than top notch. 

Foie Gras Cotton Candy - A classic at The Bazaar that is not to be missed, especially since it's been banned practically everywhere else!

Bagel & Lox
Plump salmon roe served with soft cream cheese in a light and crispy cone. Briny yet smooth and creamy with a crunchy finish, phenomenal!

Grissini Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - 
Fragrant onion infused breadsticks wrapped with thinly sliced wagyu beef that's so insanely soft & tender, it will virtually melt in your mouth.  Served with a decadently rich and flavorful Parmesan espuma dip, your mouth will be savoring the rich permeating flavors long after you've devoured every morsel of this fantastic dish.

King Crab & Shrimp Cocktail - 
Served chilled on a bed of ice, I quickly noticed generous portions of chunk king crab & plump shrimp bathing in a bright red cocktail sauce. My mouth quickly started to water and once I took a bite, my eyes lit up. Bright acidity from the sauce coupled with the fresh juicy and plump king crab meat & shrimp made for a light and refreshing cocktail that was refreshingly substantial down to the very last bite.

Oysters 
Kushi, Shiboku, Blue Point - 
Fresh, briny, perfectly sized with a plump and juicy mouthfeel and went down the hatch beautifully.

Foie Gras floating island - 
Served in a small tea cup, this flavorful dish was far from dainty. It was actually quite rich and velvety smooth with a spectacular nutty finish. Foie gras lovers will revel in this richly satisfying dish.

Robuchon Potatoes - 
With the signature Robuchon name stamped on these potatoes, I was confident I was in for a treat but words simply can not describe the out of body experience that you'll have when you try these amazing mashed potatoes. Buttery smooth and decadently rich. Simply divine. 

Roasted Corn - 
Don't let the diminutive size fool you, these snappy little guys don't only pack an irresistible crunch but a surprisingly spicy kick, as well! 

Skirt Steak - 
A beautifully cooked steak with a perfectly pink tender and juicy flesh.

Kobe - 
Easily the best cut of steak ive ever had. Buttery, juicy, fatty, tender and infinitely satisfying. You'll literally shed a tear of joy when you enjoy this outstanding cut of premium beef. And trust, this beef is legit! They even prove it with an actual certificate of authenticity that's handed to you at the end of your meal! Now that's rich ;)

We ended our meal with a selection of the restaurant's fine desserts presented in a beautiful red pastry box. 

I'd have to say this was one of my better dining experiences in Vegas and much of it came from the wonderful service and of course, inspiring cuisine!

Each and every dish was wonderful. It amazes me how a chef can take ingredients and create something that compliments each other. Perfect example is the grilled octopus. To me, by itself, it was on the bland side. But, pair it with one of the slices of potato it was served with and it's magic. I think to use the term 'pricey' is subjective.

The menus though had to make me laugh.  They attached a two pieces of paper to this large plastic board.  I mean it was huge!  It was around 5 pounds, quite ridiculous.

Anyway we ordered a bunch of food.  I really liked Jose's Asian Taco.  It had Jamon Iberico, Nori, and Tobiko.  It worked really nice together.  The nori mellowed out the tobiko and meat.  I would definitely order it again.

Next we got the Foie Gras Cotton Candy.  This was one of the best things I ate on our trip.  A piece of Foie Gras was hidden inside the cotton candy.  You had to eat this in one bite.  As the cotton candy melted, you eventually got one large bite of the liver.  It was amazing!

We then got the opportunity to eat the Jamón Ibérico de Bellota (Fermín, Salamanca, Spain) - Hand-cut from the famous black-footed Spanish pig, acorn-fed, free-range.  This is supposed to be one of the best meats in the world.  And I have to say it is.  The meat melted in our mouths.  IT had so many layers of flavor.  I could taste the salt, the earthy-ness, the acorns, that they feed it.  It was magnificent.  Just a quick warning, it is pricey and you don't get a lot of meat.  So we ordered around 3 orders.

The Roast Suckling Pig was amazing.  The skin cracked in our mouths.  The pig was moist, tender, and full of great flavor.  

We also ordered the Beef Rib Steak from Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus.  The steak was tender and had really good flavor, but it was severely under-seasoned.  I prefer the 6 month Prime Riserva Steak from Carenevino.

We also had the Brussel Sprouts and Robuchon Potatoes with White Alba Truffles.  The Sprouts was nothing spectacular.  But the potatoes, drenched in butter and truffles were amazing.

2534787,2017-12-24,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"One word... WOW.  And I was beginning to wonder if people didn't know how to cook meat well and simply, letting it shine.  Came here for a later dinner date (~8pm) on a Saturday night since I'm a fan of Jose Andres.

Venue: slightly on the dark side, that we had to bring out our iPhones and use their flashlight.  We were lucky to be put in their more private dining room, which is a lot quieter than the main dining room (and that was pretty loud) but you don't get to see the impressive cuts of meat or the grill (you only see the seafood display).  Decor is ""interesting"" with their taxidermied heads with bling hanging off of them; almost a mix of modern and Wild West style.  

Service: ranks on the higher end in terms of quality.  Frequently came by to fill waters and let us know how long to expect food to come out, but not intrusive either.  

-- Cotton Candy Foie Gras (Crispy amaranth)($8 each) - one of the more interesting dishes I've ever had period.  Sweet cotton candy contrasting with the super rich, savory foie gras flavor.  Not sure I would order this every single time I visit, but it definitely is one of those dishes you ought to try at least once.

-- Croquetas de Jamón (creamy bechamel filling with jamón de bellota)($14) - one of the best croquettes I've ever had!  Nice crispiness on the outside without being too thick, cheesy enough on the inside without being too overpowering, and enough jamon that you can taste it in the filling (though not quite sure why it has to be served in a shoe-shaped container... kinda weird...)  

-- Gazpacho Shots (tomato, cucumber, green bell peppers)($3 each) - if you have slightly heavy, rich appetizers, this is a great palette cleanser to refresh your mouth for your entrees.  Bell peppers added a nice touch to the typical tomato / cucumber gazpacho taste.

-- Catalan Spinach (apple, pine nuts, shallots, raisins)($15) - interesting to pair the spinach with the shallots and raisins since they added a much needed sweetness to the otherwise somewhat bitter spinach.  Kinda wish there were more pine nuts and raisins so you make sure you get one in every bite.

-- 1.5lb Bone-In Magnuson Ribeye ($65/lb) - simple, pure, and just letting the meat shine!  This was on their special menu and is seasoned with just plain salt and pepper.  This is as good as my mom's steak (which is a massive compliment); the meat was cooked really well and we like how we could taste the meat (vs. tasting butter or other sauces / spices thrown on top of meat at other places).  This dish may seem simple / boring, but I would recommend this simple preparation if you really just wanna enjoy meat.

-- Merino Lamb Rack (New Zealand)(oak-wood fired)($60/16 oz.) - wow; again simply prepared, but one of the best rack of lambs we've had in a while (and my date LOVES lamb).  Again, just grilled with salt and pepper, but the lamb flavor shines through.  Definitely to be shared with other people (they give you a full pound of it), but worth trying if you aren't feeling like having cow.

$250 for two people, which isn't the worst damage to our wallets I've ever seen / was totally worth it just for our meats.  We probably went a bit overboard with our meats (bone-in ribeye and lamb) and our veggie choice was on the weaker side, but we left super happy and satisfied (albeit super stuffed and needing to hit the gym).

Good selections of wines but it comes with a high price tags too.  My biggest disappointment was that 90% of dishes we ordered were over salt.

The ambiance is pretty unique, with the strange crocodile heads hanging over most of the tables.  My wife and I ordered a few drinks, then got the Jose's Way tasting menu ($185/person.)  Very pricey, but we've loved the other two restaurants, and we were paying with casino money this trip, so why not? :-)

The food was very similar to Bazaar in Beverly Hills.  Favorites were the Cotton Candy Foie Gras, Croquetas de Pollo (served in a shoe), Smoke and Ice Oysters (the smoke smells SO good), Beefsteak Tomato, Bison Buffalo Style and the cheese-filled air bread (I can't remember the name of this one, but when you bite into it and your hand is covered by delicious, boiling cheese, you'll know you found it.)  Honestly, everything we had was really good.

So why not 5 stars?  Well, the price really turned us off.  Yeah, I know we got a steak, and it was really good, and we had 12 courses and a few drinks, but $500 for 2 of us?  A very similar spread minus the steak ran around $250-300 at Bazaar, and we can EASILY stuff ourselves for under $200 at Cleo.  So was the steak really worth $200?  I can't say it was.  What I CAN say, though, is It was definitely an experience, and we're both glad we tried it.  I just can't see spending that much of my own money when we had a similar experience at a sister restaurant.  I'll just have to be glad the craps tables afforded us a fun evening...",2GUjO7NU88cPXpoffYCU8w,3,1,4,uK2DruDx95_5rCmp6LgDSA

Smoke and ice oysters: they were different, and excellent. Great presentation with the wood smoke and sea foam.

Classic tartare: a large portion with plenty of flavor and great texture. Wagyu rib eye cut is amazing. A little on the salty side though.

Wagyu beef cheeks: probably the best and most tender meat I've ever had. Literally melts in your mouth. Soue vide made.

Rosewood rib eye: for a steakhouse, I expected this to be outstanding. But instead, it was underwhelming. While cooked properly to med rare, it was chewy, tough and a bit dry. The 2lb minimum order steak cost $150.",YnENq9UIk3T9lFjjRsavyQ,3,0,3,hex3SIv_PwzP5CKl4uiW5g

I keep hoping they're going to live up to the hype and they never do. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is that for once, the server didn't act like we were privileged to be dining there like they do all ALL the SBE restaurants in LA. She was actually friendly and nice, not snooty.

First, I called for a reservation 10 days in advance after seeing nothing available on the day we wanted (Friday 9/5) on Open Table. The girl on the phone said nothing was available until Tuesday 9/9. A few days later, I looked on Open Table and 8pm on Friday was available so I booked it.

We get there on time and the place is 70% empty. I wonder if they just keep spaces open for walk-ins, yet they don't tell you that on the phone when you try to make a reservation. The place stayed empty until about 10pm when we left.

We ordered the foie gras cotton candy, chicken croquettes, beef Carpaccio with parmesan, peanut fed serrano ham, flat iron steak with blue cheese, baby corn,  and Anna potatoes.

The foie gras, croquettes, carpaccio, and ham were good, not amazing. The flat iron steak was bland, the anna potatoes were so saltly, they were inedible. I sent them back and they still came back covered in salt. They forgot the baby corn and the steak took so long, they sent out a free gazpacho, but that wasn't good either. I didn't realize that they forgot the baby corn until hours later, but at least they didn't charge us for it.

Bottom line, go to Animal or Bestia in LA. You'll save a hundred dollars and have much better, creative dishes.",yNiCei5QzogiC5edd9UP5A,5,2,2,FpL4Js_MkboJV5czCZWw3w

I do think it would be better for a large group that could get there large cuts and cut them to fit the size they feel will work. The only other issue is there not very good at cooking the meat they even said they really only do rare and med rare .

1) One of our friend ordered soup which came in a small drinking glass. She asked for a spoon and the waiter answered in a condescending tone as if he couldn't believe anyone would ask such question, ""you don't need a spoon, you drink it"" and walked away.

2) The Kobe Beef Airbread was filled with a lot of cream cheese, which coated the taste of Kobe beef. All we could taste was bread and cheese, especially when the Kobe beef was very thinly sliced.

3) The Wagyu Beef Cheek was just meh. It was chewy and tasted bland. Comparable to an overcooked roasted beef. I was looking forward to this dish but it was a total disappointment.

4) our main steak plate was bland. The meat is dry and way too chewy (I like chewy meat), the only good part is the medium rare partially cooked in the very middle, which was tender and melting in your mouth.

5) All of the sauces that came with the dishes we ordered were completely off. It's like you put avocado into a pickled jar.

I'm a steak lover and generally not very picky with my steak, but for such rating and prices, this is the most disappointing steak place I've ever tried.

They added a couple new items on the menu and we ordered waaaay more than our stomaches could hold. Started off with the half dozen Smoked and Ice Fresh Oysters. The extra touch of mini diced apples was interesting but didn't care too much for it. From there we moved into our second dish, The Classic Tartar. This is definitely a must have here! There was only two of us so after chowing down half of the dish we had to stop ourselves from eating to leave room for the main entrees. We opted in for the Grilled Maine Lobster, this is a new dish on the menu since my last visit so we had to give it a try! Lobster was outstandingly delicious! They served it whole in shell but made it easy to eat as well. Followed by the New Zealand Lamb Rack. I could not forget how amazing this dish was from my last visit and had been raving about for quite some time. Turned out to be just as amazing as I had remember it to be! YUMM! Since we didn't get the signature steak last time, we had to try it out this time! Opted in for the Rosewood, TX Wagyu/Black Angus. Turned out to be a whomping 2.5lb of yummy yummy goodness. The beef literally melts in your mouth! MUST HAVE! We obviously ended up with a ton of leftovers as our eyes were way hungrier than our stomaches!

Forgetting about the food (for a sec), the atmosphere is certainly unique: custom knives in a display case, dry aged meat locker, giant wood-burning fire filling the room with all types of sounds and smells.  Walking further into the restaurant reveals a charcuterie counter, dessert carts, a raw bar, various wine displays, and a host of unique tables and chandeliers.  I say this because there are many places to get good food, but this is a unique experience that really makes the night feel like an event.  

When something as simple as a gin & tonic is prepared with several different fresh ingredients at your table, you know you're in a for a treat.  Fun fact: we ordered many cocktails, yet each had its own distinct shape of ice.  In the grand scheme of things, does this really matter?  Not at all, but that's exactly why it does.  The details.

What madman decides to put foie gras and cotton candy together?  So tasty I almost ordered a 2nd round as dessert.  From dry aged Wagyu to our veal chop with the delicious Mojo verde, everything delivered.

The icing on the cake is the staff.  Our server was attentive and made good suggestions to complement our dishes.  We arrived early for our reservation and the manager came up to us a few times to let us know our table status.  We were thanked for our repeat business with a few items to try, but it did not feel rehearsed - there was true sincerity in their words and it was felt.

Although pricey the ingredients were very good quality and prepared perfectly. I had to give this experience 3 stars because the ambience and dining experience wasn't there for the price tag. Our table in particular was in a very awkward spot and small for 5 people at a family style restaurant. Our waitress seemed very flustered and we felt forgotten about. The menu was a little confusing. It's tapas but she had us order everything at once and then the timing on how our items came out was off. The sommelier never visited our table and our waitress barely checked in on us. Also I expect a restaurant of this caliber to do something a little extra when you make a reservation and say it's for a celebration, most fine dining I've eaten at always does this and our waitress never even mentioned or asked anything.

We chose to order several appetizers versus a full meal since we were at our he bar. We started with the olives (which I had at a DC location), they did not disappoint; the traditional olives paired with the molecular gastronomy version was a fun palate trip. It was the hubbies first time and he was over the moon about them. We also ordered the smoked oysters on a half shell. They came on a bed of ice with a nice foam, capped in a glass dome filled with luxurious smoke. Once opened the smoke permeated every sense and every square inch of the bar. At least 3 other people orders it based on the smell alone. The oysters had the taste of a beach side fire roasting with the tenderness and brineyness of a perfect raw oyster. In other words, heaven under a smoked glass. That was followed by the beef carpaccio lovingly wrapped around a crispy fennel bread stick accompanied by a Parmesan garlic aioli? Not quite sure if the dip as several drinks are in play by now. Whatever the dip was is was creamy, delicious and worthy of using your fresh get spatula to collect ever smear. The beef was perfectly done, tender and slightly smoky in flavor. We were happy to revisit the carpaccio in our final app which was the meat charcuterie board. We enjoyed a variety of meat, most notable (other than the carpaccio), an Iberico jamon and a sausage that tasted like Christmas. By now we were fullish sonthe hubby shared our meat board with the couple next to us, they also gave it a resounding thumbs up (may not be a 100% reliable opinion since they scored some tasters for free).

Get your appetites ready to be seduced by José Andrés's creative menu and somewhat primitive du jour dining experience. The temperature of the restaurant's dining room was engulfed by a sweltering heat that emanates from the open concept kitchen that lines the perimeter of the dining floor. Massive broilers, sparkling coals and rows of professional ovens surrounds the dining room and views of the fierce open flames in the background was a dramatic touch. Every seating arrangement had a prime view of the kitchen, where all of the action happened.

We came already well versed on the menu, but we definitely had some questions to ask our server as well. He was very knowledgeable and gave us great feedback on menu selections.

Cotton Candy Foie Gras - crispy amaranth $8/per: Jeez. It was so incredibly tasty! At first, it seems like it is just simple ol' cotton candy, but the foie gras is hidden inside and just wait until you get that perfect bite, nothing else matters. You will want to get angry with how good it is. We were seriously considering ordering a second, maybe fourth round. Flavor rating: 5/5

Croquetas de Pollo - Chicken-bechamel fritters $12: the creamiest, most luscious chicken bechamel croquetas served in a glass sneaker designed by Salma Hayek's brother (!!) truly a cool presentation. The breading on the croquetas were so perfect and encased inside was just the most decadent bechamel and succulent chicken. The seasoning just takes it to an addictive level. Hey, if the glass sneaker fits! Flavor rating: 5/5

The Classic Tartare - Beef sirloin, savory mustard, egg yolk, HP Sauce, anchovy, Parker House rolls $24: dramatic table-side presentation with helpful commentary on every ingredient that is being mixed in. I adored the festive Valentine's heart-shaped plating on a cold, over-sized marbled serving dish sprinkled with edible flowers; so gorgeous! The tartare is exquisite, the sirloin is the highest of quality, the sauce is slightly tangy and left us with very moist bites. It is served alongside warm Parker house rolls which are baked in meat fat (!!!!) Meat fat! It's a genius way to utilize flavor and oh boy! You can really taste the richness in flavor from the meat! I die. Flavor rating: 5/5

Sucking Pig Sandwich: served with horseradish aioli and caramelized onions (secret menu). The presentation offered 4 small and handy sandwiches. The bread was super thin and extra crispy, which added the perfect texture with every bite. However, as delicious as it sounded, we were a little unimpressed with the suckling pig; it was leaning towards dry and flavorless. The horseradish aioli, although tasty, was super pungent and overpowered the flavor of the entire sandwich. My favorite part of the sandwich was certainly the expertly grilled onions which brought so much character and caramelized sweetness. Flavor rating: 3/5

Wagyu Beef Cheeks Mojo rojo, oranges $36: 4 pieces of Wagyu beef broiled and succulent to the extreme. The orange wedges added a splash of brightness to the meat, however, the sauce was not as complex or even interesting as I would have wanted it to be. The sauce could have been left off of the dish and we would have still been fine with the excellent quality and preparation of the beef cheeks. Flavor rating: 3/5

Robuchon Potatoes $15: Can they even call these potatoes? Here is the exact description on the menu: Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes  - ""The most fattening potatoes I will ever ingest"", said our server as he smirked and placed the dish on our table. They weren't wrong about that. It is 99% butter, no joke. Insanely creamy, very silky, super naughty. It is as simple as you want to make of it though; just cream and butter whipped up until its airy. But I have no regrets (until the next day) Flavor rating: 4/5

Setas al Ajillo - Button mushrooms, garlic, lemon, arbol chile $12: Served comfortably on a thin layer of garlic and lemon puree which was divine and cooked with extreme purpose. The mushrooms were broiled with just the right tenderness. However, my hugest complaint was the arbol chile was nonexistent, maybe removed off the menu that evening unbeknownst to us. The mushrooms are cooked well, but note that it's still an extremely simple side; imagine 7 grilled buttery, garlicky mushrooms. Unless you are mushroom fans like us, you might not be missing it if you don't order it. Flavor rating: 4/5

The final note on the desert tray is also an artistic and modern display of their playful culinary style. Lots of jeweled tones, rich dark chocolates and fresh creams detected. We opted for the fresh vanilla bean cream, fresh strawberry & bacon on a thin cracker and we also selected one geometric shaped dark chocolate coffee truffle. The petite thin cracker with cream, strawberry and bacon was my favorite! Flavor rating: 4/5",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,8,7,4,d3W7fRVyIo78AJ_layfUmQ

Going through each section of the menu, the waiter was more like a guide than a waiter. The service was spectacular. During our meal, a friend was commenting on how we all didn't receive knives for a particular round of tapas, well, the waiter must have overheard, because just like that, the waiter snuck a knife next to his napkin without my friend even noticing. It was almost as if the knife magically appeared.

Oysters were not fresh as i spat the first one out and sent the whole thing back. During the whole process we told her quite a few times how hungry we are. After about 45 minutes of drinks and ousters, we get to the part of ordering meat. She at that point decided to tell us that the ribeye that she sold me about  from the beginning would take 50 minutes to cook.

2764127,2015-09-03,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I really enjoy most SBE restaurants.
I heart heart all José Andrés restaurants, heart it so much that I take most of my friends visiting to Bazaar @ SLS or suggest for them to go to one of his many restaurants around the world.  I'm such a fan that my fiancé actually proposed to me at a José Andrés restaurant, the wonderful é by José Andrés!

Ok, now that I've prefaced how much I enjoy José Andrés restaurants, I need to say how royally disappointing my experience at Bazaar Meats was this past weekend.  My friends and I were in Vegas to celebrate my fiancé's birthday and naturally, the consensus was to go to Bazaar meats for its great group dining experience, the fun decor, the delicious cocktails, and the usual of what we know José Andrés for. 

Upon checking in, we were seated at a table that was not for the right number of guests that we had. I had requested a booth but it was not noted.  I let it slide because it was getting late and we were hungry. After being seated, our waitress greeted us, handed us a lot of menus and shortly left and never returned...for a while - a long enough while for my fiancé to be able to go wait in a long line for his '$30 dollar birthday credit' at the other end of the casino and come back and we're still waiting.  Naturally, a different server came and apologized for the wait and explained the menus to us while 'we wait for our waitress to return'.  

My fiancé and I are huge winos.  For a meat restaurant, the list of by the glass cabernets is very limited, if I remember correctly, there was 1 amidst a huge wine booklet.  He finally had to opt for the one cabernet offered at $30 a glass.

The food - such a let down for what we were expecting.  Although the night started with gazpacho shots which were delicious, all the dishes that followed came out cold and/or overly salty. One of the first dishes we had was the Salmon Tartar.  Our first bites into it was met with silence - not the oh-that-was-so-good-I'm-speechless silence, more the is-it-just-our-own-particular-taste-buds-feeling-saltiness or I-don't-see-why-this-dish-is-so-great-even-though-my-friend-adamantly-recommended-it. We mentioned to our waitress the issue we had and she told us that maybe it was the nori crackers that came with the dish.  We were fine with the nori crackers' saltiness as those are chips and expected to be on the saltier side.  She let us know that nothing could be done with our tartar dish so the only thing she could do is offer us some bread in hopes that it would dilute the saltiness - ok thank you for that, moving on.  All dishes that followed were just as overly salty and the cocktails were not helping.  One of our main dishes was the Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus Rib eye.  For the price we paid at $95/lb, it was underwhelming - it came out like it had been sitting on some other table for a while and the taste was quite bland.  At this point, we did not bother to mention to our waitress any of our concerns about the dishes anymore.  We just wanted to get our desserts, sing happy birthday and call it a night.   Dessert came with a candle that kept blowing out before it reached the table so it was a bit of an awkward scene for my fiancé. We ate it and asked for the bill.   The bill came and we noticed the bread was charged.  We all raised our eyebrows and decided not to make a scene.  If anything, we enjoyed the bread the most out of that evening! In our attempt to leave as soon as possible, we forgot to use the $30 credit.  We mentioned it to our waitress who then did not know how to reprocess everything, so we just waited again.  Our waitress ended up not coming back with the bill but a different gentleman did.  He seemed to know what he was doing more and offered us something to drink while we waited for the bill to be processed but we just wanted to leave so we said no thank you.
 
I don't think my palette was off that night because the friends we went with had been to Bazaar Meats before and had ordered some of the same items we ordered because it was so good the last time they went.  They noticed the significant difference in taste and service and were apologetic in recommending this place for the weekend.   I also don't know if it was an off night for Bazaar Meats though or a 'waiter in training' night but it was a very disappointing experience and it's sad to say that at this moment, I would not recommend this place to anyone wanting some meats in Las Vegas.",JTd9d-NKJ3CfaL62Qwhhag,2,0,2,hVfyVKEetjwhjJ9ZXZvbSA

The tartare on the other hand was huge in portion and really good! 

They also were not careful with my dairy allergy. They served plenty of things with dairy without warning and it was a little strange for an upscale restaurant. If you have allergies, please be careful.

They never brought our soup.  We got our $$$pig 20 minutes after they showed it to us (I would prefer to get all our meet simultaneously otherwise one person gets stuck waiting... then we had to ask for our vegetables AGAIN!!!
 
The main thing is that we spent $1000+ for five people and NOTHING we had was event remotely remarkable.

Food:
Cotton candy fois gras, interesting, but $8 each, no.
Abalone- pretty good
Shrimp and crab cocktail - Ridiculous! It was so small!
Soup- never got it
Wagyushi (sp?) beef- eat at Ruth Chris- so much better and you don't have to cut it yourself
Wagyu beef on rocks- they cooked it for us, but it was cold by the time we got to 2nd piece
Pig- chewy and with boney pieces inside.
Cauliflower- yeah. It was cauliflower 
Brussel sprouts- much better anywhere else

At the end they felt bad (maybe?) that they forgot everything so they brought us a ""Don't be a Lemon"" frozen cocktail made with liquid nitrogen- it BURNED the crap out of our mouths- BURNED!  Was it the liquid nitrogen? Wtf?

2831609,2018-06-17,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"My family and I visited a restaurant called Bazaar Meat by Chef Jose Andres of Spain. The restaurant is considered one of the best dining experiences here in Las Vegas. They are located at the SLS Hotel, right off the Strip, so we were excited to check it out.
I am primarily vegetarian so I thought this would be a great place to experience, because a family member works there and told me that I would love the food, even if I don't eat meat.
The restaurants open kitchen has several huge Josper ovens with open-style fire pits in the middle of the room. They offer very exclusive steaks (and seafood) from the best sustainable sources from all around the world.
We were greeted immediately by the hostess, and seated near the ovens, so we could watch the entire process of the kitchen. We were told the special of the day and offered a sample of the evening's wine spotlight.
The table was set properly and everything (and everyone) was dressed perfectly. Our Waiter, Chris Rosen, introduced himself and offered a special drink to my 10-year old Granddaughter, and she loved it!
Everyone was so proper and friendly and accommodating. I was shown all the vegetable-based dishes and they offered to make a special entrée of all the roasted house vegetables with the famous Chef Robuchon Mashed Potatoes.
The interior of the restaurant is eclectic and very unique. Stuffed alligators and Matador-esque themed decor, including the infamous bullhead on the wall, with tapestries of a kind of Spanish-feel vintage theme. The place is huge and laid out in several areas for VIP's in the back, as well as a bar-lounge in the front for impromptu drinks or small diners.
The entry is open to the glass coolers holding all the suckling pig, whole fish and enormous amounts of priceless Kobe beef from Spain and Japan. Some pieces of meat were hundreds of dollars and were made fresh to order per your specifications.
The other diners were all dressed nicely and everyone seemed like they were enjoying themselves. Lots of noise and conversations filled the massive room. The whole place smelled of a fire-pit, the atmosphere with low lighting and amazing animals decorating the entire place. Chandeliers adorned overhead and unusual lighting fixtures were everywhere.
Our food was amazing to say the least, and my plate of fire-roasted vegetables with a white yogurt sauce was just perfect. They brought us out several other options of beefsteak tomato tartare, roasted asparagus-cauliflower and then this amazing cactus tartare. This actually turned out to be one of my total favorites! and of course, pan de cristal (spanish bread) for everyone.
I would highly recommend Bazaar Meats for the total Spanish-Bazaar immersion both for the experience and the incredible quality of the food. The staff was immensely professional and the evening was so fun.

I understand it must be difficult to figure out how to climatize a huge room with the kitchen in the middle, but it was seriously cold away from the kitchen.
Unfortunately, the pompous waiter thought serving people (that have never been to an over-priced tapas restaurant) was below him.  He was disgusted that we didn't understand how the 5 of us (practically strangers - business associates) were supposed to pass around a bone with meat on it to share.  
Regardless of my opinion of sharing meat on a bone around the table, the service was horrible.
The waiter (that was appalled at our indecisive ordering) forgot ALL the vegetables and potatoes we ordered!

2848686,2015-03-18,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Came here for my birthday this year and was excited to try Spanish-culinary king Jose Andres' creations.  We came on a Friday night, but must've gotten there early, since the place only started to fill up as we were finishing up with the meal.

The dining room is definitely hunting lodge meets gourmet restaurant. There's no pretentiousness at Bazaar, and even though you're getting the 5-star treatment, the waitstaff isn't at all stuffy. They have just the right amount of attentiveness, complete thorough knowledge and understanding of the menu, and even a touch of humor. 

I was sure to study the menu in-depth after making the reservation, but our waiter was trained well and was sure to explain how it works anyway. Other than the main meat dishes, every dish is tapas-style, featuring perfect-sized tasting portions so you get to try a selection of what Bazaar offers, without being too overwhelmed. 

We ordered the: gazpacho shots, which reminded me of a slightly too salty liquid salad (a good thing, minus the salty part); croquetas de pollo, which were 'sold' to us as fried balls of chicken pot pie. Sadly, they were seriously lacking in seasoning and my fellow diner found chicken cartilage in hers ... needless to say, that ruined the experience. The waiter did take it and show it to the chef, but she did nothing about it on our end and we did still pay for it on the final bill; that was a bit disappointing.  My dining companion was excited to try the sloppy joe mini sandwich, but it was really nothing special and the ratio of meat to bread was way off (too much of the latter). 

The thing I was really excited about was the wagyu beef cheeks ... and then I was disappointed by it in the end. I was expecting a melt-in-your-mouth experience, but found that not to be the case. It required a knife to cut through, but while the meat itself was less-than-stellar, the accompanying mojo rojo sauce and mandarin slices were divine and helped bump it up a bit.

My fellow diner ordered the veal chop, which was cooked well. The mojo verde sauce was pretty much a chimichurri, but very doable. 

One thing we made sure to get was the Joel Robuchon potatoes - er, butter with potatoes. Those were very creamy and made to perfection, although - and apologies to Chef Robuchon on this - I don't think it needs so much butter. 

The brussels sprout petals were lovely. The addition of lemon air to the vegetable really sexified it up, I just wish the whole thing was served a bit warmer. 

Certainly the star of the dinner was - perhaps  oddly enough - the baby carrots. They're heirloom/colored carrots served whole with a side of greek yogurt, and I can undoubtedly say they were extremely scrumptious. So, of all the things one can get at Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres, yes, the carrots provide a good enough reason to possibly return. And the waitstaff. But that may be just about it.",CbLusGsbKTaiJrKygkRAtg,1,1,3,bbu8RaUB_aaCftMwTx0V2Q

It made me giddy seeing different cuts of meat cooking in the large open kitchen on the way to our table. It's massive and the decor is very eclectic with gator head statues and large murals. I was hoping for a more casual atmosphere to get my carnivore on. It was a bit loud because of some boisterous parties which I thought offsets the high-end dining vibe of the place, making it seem more casual and relaxed.

I enjoyed the Truffle and Bees cocktail but the Penicillin cocktail that my husband ordered had an odd medicinal scent which I didn't care for. It did take a while before a server got to us after we were seated. But when he did, the service was warm and everything was on point. 

They were out of the suckling pig that evening but we didn't mind since we've had whole lechon twice in December. For the main course, we decided on the beef rib steak which is priced by the pound. Our server found us a lovely 2.5 lb. cut of Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus. And no, he didn't ask us how we wanted it cooked. They make the steak the way it's supposed to be cooked. Just leave your steak preferences at home and let the pros do their job. 

For starters we tried The Foiffle, a small light waffle with foie foam, peanut butter and honey. Sweet and dessert-like. Great way to start a meal. I couldn't pass up two items I've never tried before, Iberico ham and geoduck. My husband said that the geoduck was all mine, since he doesn't like the clam texture. The geoduck came thinly sliced with yuzu and ginger. It was delicious and even my husband ""loved"" it. The Iberico ham, proclaimed as the best ham in the world, had dark red meat with a sweet and almost nutty flavor. We also ordered some pan de cristal with tomatoes to nibble with the ham. Not sure if I would pay so much for ham again but for a first-time experience, it was almost worth it.

When our steak finally came, it was huge and perfectly seasoned. We had it with the brussel sprout petals. Finally, we decided to box up some leftover steak to make room for the 10-piece chef's choice dessert. And boy, those leftovers made for an awesome steak and egg breakfast the next day. We went huge that night and our server delightfully shook our hands as we left. What an epic meal to start the year off right.",HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw,3,2,5,_FzbID9tcvDJj31JniC1WA

We started with the Cotton Candy Foie Gras which was an absolute dream. Next, we had the Vittore 1950 Carpaccio - which was honestly one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. Our third dish was the Classic Beef Tartare which came with these amazing home baked rolls - really delicious. To end the main part of the meal we had the skirt steak with rosemary mustard. 

My husband loves vanilla ice cream, so we ordered the Vanilla Ice Cream Experience - which was truly amazing. I won't ruin the surprise by describing what it was, but definitely worth it. We then had the Bacon Strawberry Cream pastry and the Salted Caramel Candies.

The greens salad was way better than we had expected and so we ordered an additional one.

2953211,2017-02-05,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"On a recent visit to Las Vegas--solo, mind you--I found myself with the option to try any restaurant my heart desires, but something was tugging me back to Bazaar Meat.  You see, a year or so ago, my wife and I spent weeks deciding on which place to dine for the celebratory meal for our marriage, and after highly scrutinizing the lists, we settled on Bazaar Meat.  We arrived full of excitement and anticipation for what we'd expected to be one of the finer dining experiences of our lives... what we had was a 3-hour experience where our server treated us like royalty, but our food was incredibly underwhelming and bland.  At close to $400, we expected more.

So fast forward to my free night after a successful work day, and I found myself on the phone, asking about stopping in.  I'd just walked the length of the strip and back and settled into a spot at the bar, where the full menu awaits.  As the server approached, I explained why I was back--a chance for redemption.  She asked me to hold my thought, and stepped away for a few minutes before returning.

To put it lightly, the red carpet was rolled out for me.  No, my meal wasn't free, but many courses were provided and I couldn't draw a comparison between the two visits.  This time, the steak was cooked to perfection, which was an ideal entree after the smoked oysters and several other bites beforehand.  The sprouts were heavenly, and the potatoes (which I said I wouldn't want) were a very welcome freebie, as they were hands down the best I've had outside of Peru.  

The best compliment I can pay in addition to the appreciation and pleasure received on this visit, is that I will indeed make it a point to return with my wife so she can experience what we both missed out on a year ago.

I'm from Texas.  You'd be hard pressed to find a ribeye of similar size that was Prime and dry aged for a month that breaks $125.  

I went with a big group.  We ordered oysters, steak, carpaccio trays, carrots, potatoes, and a couple of drinks.

The food is good.  My favorite was the ribeye and outclassed everything else except maybe the charred carrots which I thought were delicious.

I've had better roasted pigs and thought the skin was almost inedible.  It was fairly oily and boney, but that's usually expected. The service was decent: a little slow to get drinks out.

2980039,2015-12-12,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"This review will cover the experience of my first visit but the food of both of my visits. 

I have been to the Bazaar in LA multiple times, so when I finally had a chance to go try Bazaar Meat in Las Vegas, I couldn't pass it up. It's located in the newly re-designed SLS hotel in the corner of the hotel. Right outside of the restaurant there is a gigantic lit up ""LIFE"" for all those basic instagram'ers out there. 

I got in at 5:30pm, right when they opened so they told me to hang out at the bar. I ordered the Passion Up cocktail (which I couldn't find the second time). This drink is truly unique, that passion fruit foam is amazing, and the drink itself was a perfect combination of sweet, tarty and strong too. Too bad I had a busted lip at the time so it burned every time I had a sip, but it was worth it.

Before I got to finish the drink, they told me that my table for 1 was ready. Just a heads up, if you order from the bar, you have to close the tab at the bar, so might be easier just to wait to get the drink at the table next time. 

Once I was seated, I was overwhelmed by this gigantic menu and additional tasting menus, which made the decision to pick what I wanted to eat even more difficult. Given that I was eating alone, I had to pick the best of the best. (I only realized there was a back side to the gigantic menu on my second visit, wow...)

(Food is a combination of my two visits, no I did not eat all this alone)

Sea Urchin: A super light starter, really fresh uni and you can really taste the ginger. I'm starting to like uni more and more so I definitely enjoyed this dish.

Croquetas de Pollo: I only got this for the shoe, have tried this at the LA location but it was really creamy, had the perfect crunch to it and a really nice contrasting texture. Another really good starter to share.

Beef & Parmesan Grissini: Got this both visits, comes with 5 sticks so perfect for sharing and that cheese sauce is sooooo good and cheesy. At first, I was pretty stingy about using the sauce, but I had to add more and more once I realized how good it was. The washugyu beef has a really good texture to it and flavor, definitely one of my favorites.

Classic Tartare: Got this both visits as well, they show you the dish at first and then someone mixes everything for you and puts it on a marble plate, served with 6 dinner rolls which are perfect to eat with the tartare. The flavor was amazing, with all the sauces, one of my favorite dishes as well. 

Rosewood, Wagyu/Black Angus Steak: Minimum order was 3lbs so we shared it among 5 people and wow, this was pretty good steak. Not sure if it was worth the price point, but I can definitely appreciate a good piece of meat. They serve it to you two different ways so you can try each of the flavors. 

Robuchon: They aren't kidding when they said butter, butter and more butter with some potatoes. This is probably the creamiest, most delicious mashed potatoes I've ever had. One of my friends even got a dish with regular mash potatoes and her didn't stand a chance. Definitely need to share as it is very filling, perfect to go along with any of the other steaks. 

Morcilla with Uni: Probably the most plain dish of the night, thought I would try something else with uni, but the blood sausage overpowered the dish with it's flavor and texture. 

Now to the last two and my two MUST GETS (if you like foie gras): 

The Foieffle: Air waffle, foie espuma, peanut butter and honey, how can you go wrong with this?? When you cut up the waffle in half, the ooze from the peanut butter and honey comes out so be careful! This combination is an orgasm in your mouth. I could have eaten 2-3 easily. 

S'mores: A play off the classic S'mores from those good ol' bonfire nights. Foie Gras, Chocolate, Marshmallow, Graham Crackers. You get 4 per dish and I would make sure you cherish each one. After I finished the first two, I could help but wanting to save the last two. And when you finish the last one, you just want another order. It's a never ending cycle so make sure you're ready to stop all the urges.

Service was amazing both trips, super professional and respectful staff. They made both experiences amazing for me and I will definitely be back. One of the waiters, John, talked about a tasting menu for $150 with a minimum group of 4 people that I have to get. Until next time!",r5GARC8nZaJQYzsmx9MVEA,2,0,5,RsC1yMpiDrrr3Iug_AGydQ
2983581,2016-05-22,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Really 3.5 stars... not quite a Fan but better than 'ok'.

We did the 11-course tasting menu for $200 pp back in April. (I think they change it up every so often.)

While it was fun and eclectic, I wasn't bowled over by the dishes.  Nothing left me wanting more ...nor did I want to lick the plate on any of them. Maybe I went in with expectations that were just too high.  Maybe the tasting menu didn't give us a taste of what makes this a WOW kind of place. (That and the $600 bill - food, drinks, tax and tip - left me wanting more in terms of flavors and experience. Note, I don't mind expensive meals if the food and experience warrant it.)  

Disclaimer: I'm super picky, and have had the luxury of eating at some really nice places that range from hole-in-wall to well-known establishments.

Food 3-stars
11-course menu - I'm not going to detail each course as that would take too long and be ridiculous.
The oysters had too much smoke.  The cotton candy foie gras was fun with a sweet/savory type deal but I was comparing the foie gras to what I had in Paris a few months ago and I didn't think it was as good.  (They make the cotton candy fresh and it just melts in your mouth, not grainy or overly sweet, so that was pretty fantastic.) The Classic Tartare was lovely, but I would have preferred to just have that without the bun.  I feel like the bread deterred from the tartare.  The Beefsteak Tomato was surprisingly good. The octopus was prepared nicely but not memorable. The steak was prepared to the temperature we wanted but I was expecting it to be more tender.  The mashed potatoes were mostly butter... and while I LOVE BUTTER... this was over the top on the butter.  I think it was really Butter with a hint of potatoes.

Service 4-stars
Fantastic!  The host was lovely and greeted us immediately as we walked up.  The bartender was quick with our drinks and made them with a fun flourish. 
Our server was friendly and explained the menus to us, how they work and then gave us a bit of time to think before we placed our order. She checked on us throughout the meal at exactly the right times.
Once we ordered, they brought the dishes as they were prepared... there wasn't a specific order that they came in with the exception of the steak and sides coming towards the end and the dessert being last.  They didn't seem to be timed ... in that .... at one time we had 3 different courses on the table.  I almost felt rushed even though I know we weren't since our meal was 2.5 hours.  That's definitely not rushing us. 

Ambiance 4-stars
Dark with alcoves for larger parties to have like a private-ish area.  The different animals on the wall were fun and definitely gave you a sense that this is a Meat place.  Note, not all the animals on the walls are represented on the menu.  

I'm hoping they run a summer special menu like they've done in the past so that I can give this place another whirl.  I really really want to love it, but I just can't right at this moment.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,0,3,Rv2QbbAaK74fi7wm1TH_ag

When we asked for something more in the center of the Dining Room we were told we would need to ""wait til a table was available"".....as we pointed out several tables she then did seat us in one that was empty.  We then watched as 3-4 other parties refused that same lonely table in the back!  HINT:  Might want to rethink the feeling of that part of your establishment!

Turns out, they dehydrated the tomatoes to attain that beefy texture. The bison carpaccio was exceptional. We ordered the tasting menu and we're very satisfied. The rib eye was dry aged and so flavorful. I can't believe how sinfully delicious the mashed potatoes were. Everything was just so elevated and unlike anything you're ever tasted.

5 Stars for Everyone in the Back of House being so polite and letting me taste a few things.  Sit at the bar if you are by yourself or just with a friend... for sure!   

Get everything with Foie Gras in it!  I did that and every item was delicious.  My camera died and I couldn't take a picture of the Foiewaffle but IT WAS AMAZING and so was the cotton candy.

We arrived around 5pm on a Friday because I wanted to try their happy hour prior to our dinner reservation. I recommend this approach if you can because you can try some of the cocktails and appetizers for half the price. We got oysters, chicharron (YUM), this parmesan foam cream puff thing, and 4 drinks for $70 which I feel like is a pretty good deal consider its Vega$. 

Once we sat for dinner we were greeted by our server Elias. Elias was great in his recommendations and was thorough in describing all of our options. There are so many amazing choices on the menu -- obviously you can't go wrong with the Wagyu (this is one of 9 restaurants in the U.S. with Japanese Wagyu). We loved the classic steak tartare, and the ribeye tasting as well. The butter potatoes are incredible, but heavy on the butter -- this should be no surprise since the menu literally says ""butter"" three times in the item description.

The standout of the night for me was when we received Jose's Asian Tacos. I had never tried Jamon Iberico but knew it was the ham equivalent of Wagyu. I asked Elias a few questions about it, and he suggested I speak to their in house jamon expert, Freddy. Elias walked us over to the kitchen where there were tons of hams on display ready for slicing. Freddy (jamon expert) explained to us all the nuances of each type of ham, how it was aged, what the pigs ate, qualifications to be jamon iberca, etc. Freddy cut us samples of everything as he was describing it so we had a miniature jamon tasting! 

I loved that the kitchen staff were willing to spend time with customers like this, Freddy was in no rush and was happy to just chat about his craft. I thought this was excellent customer service and really was the cherry on top of an already excellent dining experience.",0FDxFFTJ6K-j1slywkNPeA,2,2,5,J_4ALT9X99ntA4vSrPpk6A

I can now say that Bazaar meat is a perfect addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene and I give it two thumbs up.  Although the SLS is a bit down the strip, make the trip to eat here.  Again with Jose Andres the cuisine is spanish tapas with molecular gastronomy however this is a meat themed restaurant.  Many high end meets that include kobe beef at 40 dollars an ounce with a minimum of 6 ounces can pack a punch in your wallet but the meat quality is A+.  I opted for a tasting menu course which there are 4 of and the amount of food for the price was impeccable.  We added the classic beef tartare which was prepared at table side and it was one of the best tartars I've ever had.  The chateaubriand was cooked to perfection and we were all stuffed.  The waitstaff and service were perfect not too overbearing, but my water glass was never empty.  I plan on coming here many times in the future.  Awesome addition!

EXCEPT for the big meat dishes, which really required 4 people to eat if you also want to try the smaller plates, which are EXCELLENT. Some favorite small dishes include the epic foie gras cotton candy, and the foiefelle. The Waygu on a bread stick with espuma was also amazing, and the chicken croquettes are always tasty, but you can also get them at Jaleo. It's really missing the Philly Cheesesteak from the Beverly Hills locations to really make it the epic Bazaar location.
The large meats are really big, like 2.5 to 3 lbs each. They have a roasted pig and 3 types of beef as the main large portions of meat options, including two Waygu options from the US. The large meats take 40-50 minutes to prepare, so you eat the tapas while you wait.

Yummy but did take an hour to arrive (he did mention to us that it would). The PULPO was my favorite (grilled octopus) just the way I remembered when in Barcelona. The side dishes sucked!!

I didn't end up taking a second bite of any of the desserts. They weren't bad but nothing pleased my palette. 

The cream puffs were dry and cream filling uninteresting. I don't remember the truffles other than the earl grey which was the best out of the 3. None of the tarts worked for me. I liked the passion fruit tart until I got to the banana strawberry tasting yogurt at the bottom. If it was filled with just passion fruit I would have liked it. Chocolate raspberry tart needed less raspberry and more chocolate. The dessert sampler is a good idea because of the variety it offers but each individual dessert is not good on it's own.

Of al the restaurants I have dined in this past week, this was best experience I've had where everything was perfect. I will definitely return before the end of trip, and when I return to Vegas I will make sure to visit with the family so that they may enjoy this wonderful place.

I had the Wagyu Hanger Steak which was cooked to the perfect temperature I requested. It was tender and delicious. I also had the buttered potatoes which were amazing, creamy texture and delicious buttery flavor. I had the opportunity to try the Tartar which I had not had before and was also delicious, the bellota ham with its melt in your mouth favor.

It's always interesting how European chefs interpret the Thanksgiving turkey dinner. The chef made sure that the turkey white meat was accompanied by crispy skin, dark meat, and enough of the protein so that there were some leftovers that you can take home. The restaurant made sure to add a little tapas flair by mixing in some turkey croquettes (tasty but a bit salty) and their usual Ferran Adrià olives (ok). The turkey accompaniment of green beans (good, it even had fried shallots in it instead of onions), cornbread stuffing (this was a miss), Delmonico potatoes (a very good starch), endive salad, cranberry sauce (very good), and crab/shrimp cocktail. The desserts were an autumn themed panna cotta, pumpkin tart, pecan ""cookie"", and a hazelnut bonbon - all just bite size but very delicious.

As other diners have pointed out, the staff is very attentive, but it seemed that the kitchen struggles to provide dishes in a timely and orderly manner. Since this prix fixe is not their standard item, there seemed to be mistiming on when a dish was ready. The croquettes came out immediately. Then an awkward pause until the olives and the crab/shrimp cocktail came. The busboy took away our starter dishes. Again a long awkward pause. Then hot dinner plates were brought out. I assumed that the main course was going to be brought out imminently. Nope. The dinner plates cooled down to lukewarm, and the wait staff brought over the sides of green beans, salad, and cranberry sauce. Another pause, and finally the turkey, potatoes, and the stuffing made an appearance.

Lastly, this is Vegas. Diners and tourists are all there to have fun. The manager came out to ask how the dining experience was. He was making small talk, but then he made a faux pas of asking a tableful of women if there were 3 generations at the table. Um, no. Maybe if there was better lighting you wouldn't have insinuated that some of the women looked older than their age. Even if the woman looked like a grandma, I highly recommend not addressing any woman's age ever in the future!

So when my friend told me about his newest restaurant, Bazaar Meat, at the SLS hotel...I had to say OH MEAT! Since Bazaar Meat is located at the newly built SLS hotel...it is kind of ""far"". No offense, but it was kind of dead in the hotel and the restaurant when my friends and I were there on a Friday night. Despite that, the food was still delicious! The girls and I each ordered their gin & tonic, which was Spanish style with big chunk of ice and some floral décor. They used Fever Tree tonic, which I love love love! However, they did not mention what kind of gin they used...hmmm. 

The chef started us with a complimentary endive salad. The salad was covered with shredded cheese, so it was quite delicious...reminded me of a Caesar Salad but all in an endive. I had the Beef & Parmesan Grissini, which was sliced Washugyu beef carpaccio wrapped in pretzel sticks with an onion dipping sauce--this was so, so good! The place is known for the suckling pigs, which I recommend. If you were to order a whole one, call ahead of time! Otherwise, you can get them in quarters. Jose Andres' suckling pig was different from the Chinese one. The skin of this one is thinner and not as dry. The exterior was crispy and juicy, and the interior was crispy and juicy as well. It was served with a side of salad. We also tried the octopus. That was quite disappointing because it was dry, chewy and overly charred. To end the night, the serve made at our table an alcoholic grapefruit sorbet with liquid nitrogen. That thing was strong! All in all, the way they serve food here is pretty tapas-style with great presentations. The brussel sprout side was just okay. It was nothing like I expected--it's like boiled leaves. 

Don't forget to save room for their dessert. It's like a small bites with big flavors--I recommend the hazelnut one! Overall, it was a great dining place.",2Yg3D3xUNNzmn-SicXZOnA,0,0,4,m-KJD8NVPBWcWEZ6Ab7tLA

The restaurant itself has a nice vibe to it and most of the staff were friendly on my visit. 

The bar has a cool dripping blood sculpture as a chandelier. We had a glass of sake(good), truffles n bees(unique), don't be a lemon(refreshing), and the infamous magic mojito(don't get it). Mojito puts on a good show but falls short on taste. It's just waaay too sweet. It's like sucking on a sugar coated lemon lol. They tried to fix it by adding soda and putting it on the rocks but with no prevail, still yuck. 

Eric was our server tonight and his choice of words to me were loose? Lol. As if we were homeboys..I guess. Anyway, just because I have nikes on doesn't mean I don't like the well spoken service. It's alright tho we played along. 

1=never again
2=just ok
4=Delicious

We ordered:
Cotton candy foie-1
Foiefle-2
Chicken croquets-4
Classic tartare-2
Chicharon w Greek yogurt-2
blood sausage and uni-2
---------
Wagyu beef cheeks-4
8 yr old Holstein bone in ribeye-1
Delmonico potatoes-1
Cauliflower steak-1
---------
Passion fruit / green tea cake-2
Salted caramel ice cream-4

Honestly, the best bite of the night was the croquets. I would definitely order those again. I love foie gras so I had to order some foie inspired tapas but neither the foiefle or cotton candy foie impress me. Foiefle was over powered with peanut butter and the cotton candy was eeeh. Wagyu beef cheeks were oh so tender and delicious. 
Finally, our ""Mindful meat. CA. 7-8 yr old Holstein cow"" ribeye arrives. Looks can be deceiving and no matter how much you hype it up. It all comes down to taste and that's where it missed. The steak was tasteless, bland, and non impressive whatsoever. Our side dishes came after we were half way done with our steak. I brought my concerns to Eric's attention but did nothing to suffice the problem but a cup of salt. Submissive laughs shared between my date and I, so we said ""f*** it"". finished up and left. Eric was wonderful nonetheless but he could've handled my complaint better.

3265977,2015-05-08,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"My husband has a thing for eating at a Jose Andres restaurant whenever we go to Las Vegas. We don't do shows and I don't gamble that much. However I will gladly blow my work bonus on a good meal. 

The main courses are family sized portions, or at least enough for 3 people. The appetizers and desserts are individual portions. I would still share the spoon or something. It is worth it. 

I love the space of this place. A play on traditional and modern decor. The mismatched chairs sometimes have animals wearing sunglasses or hats. There is plenty of seating for large parties. I would recommend getting a reservation, even if it's for two.

If you're overwhelmed by the selection, here's what blew my mind:
Foie Gras cotton candy - with foie gras in the middle. Sweet and savory and amazing. This was the amuse bouche. Damn it. I would gladly pay for a proper carnival sized portion of this.
Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharrón - Title is completely accurate. A gigantic slab of fresh chicharron is served at your table, then smashed to bits by the server. Never had chicharron with so much good texture and good salty flavor going on. So much for eating the regular bagged stuff for the rest of the year.
Foie Gras s'mores - Never look at s'mores the same way ever again. I thought the foie gras would be overwhelming. No. It somehow made the chocolate taste better and counter the almost too sweet marshmallow. Again would pay for another plate, for myself.
Gazpacho shots - I would recommend getting this before the main course. It made a tasty palette cleanser.
Robuchon - here's the menu description: ""Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes."" Yes it tasted like really good butter that's barely held together with finely mashed potatoes. When it got cold towards the bottom of the bowl, the whole thing solidified like butter. It could also show what this entire meal was doing to my arteries.

Yes fine but WHAT MEAT DO I CHOOSE?
We ordered aged beef (Mindful Meats, CA, 8-10 yr. old Holstein). The cooks actually know what medium rare looks/feels/tastes like. Our server was right in that it was so beef flavored it was almost game-y tasting. Not a bad thing. To be honest every meat option looked and smelled amazing whenever someone else's order passed by.

Finally, save room for dessert! The portions aren't big so you can literally pick a little bit of everything to go with your coffee, tea, or dessert wine.

3281388,2018-04-16,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"A few friends and I decided we'd treat ourselves to one fancy dinner over the course of our three-day Vegas trip. One of the party member's best friend raves about this restaurant as her favorite in Vegas, and a friend of mine loves Jose Andres restaurants in the D.C. food scene. But we were really underwhelmed and disappointed here and unfortunately, this meal became a running joke of the trip...hah.

We were on a budget and it's tapas style, so we split 4 different items and a couple of them got two glasses of really delicious Spanish wine. We ordered skirt steak, classic tartare, croquette, and cotton candy foie gras.

We were most excited for the cotton candy foie gras and that turned out to be the biggest disappointment. Even disregarding the price point ($8 for a single, tiny wisp of candy), the execution was disappointing -- there wasn't that care or creativity you'd expect from someone like Jose Andres. Rather than incorporate the foie gras into the floss, a smidge of it is placed on the tip of the stick. So you don't get to the good stuff until you reach the center. It's quite literally less than a tea spoon of foie gras smeared at the center of average cotton candy. Not really as appealing or fun as it could be!

The skirt steak was amazing and really tender and marinated perfectly. But lots of places have good steak, so this to me was not mind blowing or really worth noting in comparison to all the other just as great options out there. 

We also really enjoyed the meaty croquette, although super small portions. As in, you can prop one on the tip of your pinky. Perfectly fried though and rich, creamy center was very complimentary. 

As for the tartare, they mix it table-side and ask one of the party members to taste test it for seasoning. At least two of us thought it ended up being too salty, a bit overwhelming in flavor. I think I would have preferred the staff to just present it as they'd like, so there would be more quality control. I think it's hard to gauge what ""more seasoning"" can mean for different people -- what that amounts to. 

The service was good though, no complaints there. There was a huge, baller table next to us who were having a feast, but the four of us were still pleasantly attended to throughout the meal.

There was a huge gap between one dish to the next and I think this is due to everything being in different kitchens so it seems like they don't talk to each other. It took about an hour to get our steaks and by that time we were starving.  The waiter seemed like he was standing around a lot. Actually a lot of them seemed to be standing around the center table for a while and no one picked up our plates for about 30 minutes even though most of us had finished and was just sitting there.

First off the ambiance is warm and inviting.. as someone else mentioned think hunting lodge meets fine dining establishment and the service was great as expected.  Our server was helpful and explained everything nicely, answered any questions, and explained that everything is served family style.  

We played it pretty safe, chicken croquette and the giant chicharron for starters.  Croquettes were tasty, the chicharron I thought was a bit bland and could have used a touch more salt directly or in the yogurt dip.

For the mains we ordered a roughly 3lb cut of the Rosewood Angus/wagyu and a quarter suckling pig.  For sides we ordered the Robuchon potatoes, piquillo peppers, and grilled asparagus.  The sides were good, simply prepared and complimented the meats well.  

I personally had the strawberry/cream/bacon dessert which I thought was very good.

The meats however is where I'm torn.  I'm asian.. I've consumed quite a bit of roast pork during my time and honestly the suckling pig did not impress.  Also, while the steak was prepared well (simply seasoned and finished with kobe beef fat) easily 40% of the weight was the giant t-rex size rib bone.   Ok not t-rex but it was big, and it didn't dawn on me till later that night that we just paid what.. $70 for essentially nothing.  I mean that's a 16oz dry aged tbone at any other steakhouse.

We had a party of six and only waited for a short time. We had one of their unique cocktails while we waited. I should have took pictures, but I was too busy enjoying all of the smells, tastes and taking in the decor. Ummm alligator heads on the walls. Yassss! 

Once seated we reviewed the menu. It was a tad confusing for some of our party, but basically it's family style. It's meant to be shared. What we had:
*Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharrón:Greek yogurt, za'atar spices, I found this a little bland. I would say take a pass. 
*Croquetas de Jamón: Creamy bechamel filling with jamón de bellota, now these were delicious! Absolutely melted in our mouth, like an explosion of goodness. 
*Gazpacho Shots: Tomato, cucumber, green bell peppers, I would rate these just ok. I would pass on these next time. My hubby liked it a lot though. 
*Vittore 1950*: Tenderloin of beef, black pepper, Parmesan cheese, capers, croutons, Sherry dressing, ok this was brave for me (it's raw), but I liked it. Would do it again. 
*Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus, scrumptious!!!!! I don't know what else to say, melted in your mouth. 
*Grilled Asparagus, it was asparagus. 
*Robuchon potatoes:Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes, the most creamy, guilty, rich, beautiful mashed potatoes I have ever put in my mouth. Dreamy lol. 

Ok the take away. I would eat here again. I enjoyed it immensely. However. It is expensive. So if you are going as a group make sure everyone understands that. Also, the meat is priced PER POUND. So the ribeye isn't 75, it's 75 PER POUND with most rib eyes averaging 2 lbs. We didn't notice that and ordered two for our group. My hubby and I still thought for the diversity of the menu, taste and enjoyment of the food, as well as the wonderful service, it made it well worth the price.

Location 
This is housed in the SLS hotel. Traditionally the SLS is a modern ultra sexy brand with sexy people staying in the hotel and partying in the hotel.  I excepted it to be like the Cosmo hotel in Vegas, it's more like the stratosphere.

The restaurant itself is sexy, large open kitchen and cool meat lockers displaying the aged meats

Service 
Was on point. Everyone was attentive and gave great recommendation on the menu

Food

We ordered an aged rib eye that ran $95 per pound. We had 6 adults and ordered 2 of them at a total of 5 pounds. Yes, that was $500 worth of steaks. It was the best steak I have every had.  It was about 2 inches thick, the slow cook it over the smoke for about 39 mins, before the sear it off close to the coal.

Amazing flavor, smoke and tenderness!

The rest of the dishes had Jose flair, creativity and flavor.  I am not sure if I thought the rest of the meal was amazing... But very creative. Jose has many items with a Spanish flair and flavor. 

Even though they are executed perfectly! I don't think the flavor profile hit my palate perfectly.

Overall an excellent experience, I think I would order a simpler menu next time and soak in the amazing beef!

Let's start with the service. We arrived a little early so the hostess sat us at the bar for cocktails. Our bartender was nice, but what was most impressive is that he had a good knowledge of the items on the food menu so we were able to get a head start on all the awesome details surrounding the food and its sources. Once we were seated, our server, Natalie, introduced herself and was most gracious, and throughout our meal, everyone from the staff who came by our table was also very gracious and polite. 

We had been looking forward to trying the suckling pig so when Natalie told us that they had run out, I was a little dismayed. They, however, made it up to us by giving us a complimentary serving of a range of things from their menu. We started off with the Brussels Sprouts Petals salad, which is one of the best salads I've ever had - the petals weren't bitter as they can be sometimes and the rest of the components had the right amount of moisture so the salad wasn't soggy. We chased the salad with their raw oysters with were, again, some of the best I've ever had. They were so fresh and the salt water from which they were taken seasoned them perfectly. Following the oysters we were served complimentary Pommes Paillasson and the Straws - perfectly done. Our meat dish was the Braised Lamb Neck, which the bartender warned us would be rich. And it was! It's served in the size and shape of a 4Oz steak and looks fairly harmless, but is very rich with great flavor. I'd recommend sharing the lamb neck plate because it can be a little too rich for one person. All in all, the food was delicious and well-presented. 

The decor was great too. The walk through the SLS was a little weird and the place was empty, but once we were in the restaurant, I enjoyed the setting and walking past the grill and meat case on our way to our table - great mix of form and function for a steakhouse.",flmlEBnGieBbD0i1pSlqrA,0,0,5,K9nq0AlBpePd1IH_MvdSZg

With a modern twist to the ingredients and a true flair and artistry of the chef's presentations, in not sure there's a better place in Las Vegas to recommend for a meal. 

Bazaar Meat is located in SLS so maybe that's why it doesn't get as much credit as it should. Still it's a Jose Andres restaurant so you know it will be good. The venue is humongous and could easily host a convention.  Took about 3 minutes just to walk to our table.  The waitress came out right away, gave us a handful of menus, explained the cocktails and course options, and we were off. 

We began with a few choice cocktails from the menu. These were exceptional and each had its own uniqueness, whether it be salt air on the margarita or a smokey flavor on the Manhattan. We also tried the liquid nitrogen lemon drink, a super strong and tasty old fashioned, and a literally smoking mojito. 

We went with the $100 tasting menu and swapped out the olives for the foie grad cotton candy at no extra charge. Each meal came out with an explanation on how to properly eat/experience each dish. Most came with a signature dipping sauce as well. We were able to pace ourselves with the delivery of the food so we were definitely not rushed.  Our two and a half hour meal was full of 8 dishes with our added few side dishes. Each was delectable, with the standouts being the foie gras cotton candy, bread stick beef carpaccio, brussel sprouts, and a light meat dish with a signature truffle sauce. We ended with a platter of about 8 desserts. Each had a unique element like the food, including edible packaging for a candy as the top. Main meal was the better than desserts in my opinion, though that's not knocking the dessert. 

Bazaar Meat is my number one recommendation in Las Vegas as of this date. For a memorable meal from start to finish, come here and experience not just eat the food",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,5,a7mgpOwy-I4k6ddaVZLbZA
3335288,2015-04-26,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Jose Andre is my favorite chef. I have been to several of his restaurants. So needless to say, I was VERY excited to go to Bazaar Meat.

Bazaar Meat is Chef Andres' take on a steakhouse. The menu is partly filled with his unique version of tapas. Then also filled with steak, steak and more steak. Everything is designed to be sharable. And it is all delicious.

We started off with one of the finest charcuteries ive ever seen. One mouth watering taste of meat after another. Of course topped off with some mind blowing Jamón ibérico.

As featured in the LA Bazaar, I had to have the foie gras cotton candy. It's seriously the best thing ever. So good, I ordered one for desert as well.

Also tried the Jose's take on a ruben sandwich. And it was magic in my mouth. Soooo good.

Now on to the main event. If you are into high quality steak, they really feature the best of the best. True Japanese Waygu, 5 star American ribeye's, etc. Plus everything else you can ever want. I was there with 2 others. So we got the chateaubriand, the pork loin, and the lamb rack. The chateaubriand was excellent. Pork was served with apples and was over the top delicious. But then came the lamb...

The lamb, which was ordered medium rare, came out nearly raw. Honestly, I was shocked, especially considering the 5 star meals I have gotten from ever Jose Andres venture. But the staff handled it top notch. Every manager came out and apologized. They brought it back cooked properly. Bought us desert and gave us some asparagus on the house. So despite this rather shocking turn of events, it ended up ok.

Also shared a couple sides. The red peppers were some of the best ive ever had. They also featured something called Robuchon potatoes. Ok, please bare with me for a second while I go on  a slight completely spoiled foodie rants. So before ordering Robuchon potatoes, I called them out on this. I even told the waiter ""you guys must have a serious set of balls to call your mashed potatoes Robuchon potatoes."" I say this because I have had the actual Robuchon potatoes and they are simply the most amazing potatoes I have ever had. So good that I refuse to believe anyone else can do them properly. The waiter said that the actual Joel Robuchon even gave his thumbs up after trying them.  Jose Andres' ""Robuchon"" potatoes arrived. They were really good. I am sorry to say, these were not as good as the real deal ""Robuchon"" potatoes. Don't get me wrong, these were also mind blowing. But they were not as good as the original. I suppose its like me saying I prefer my Lamborghini over my Ferrari. Someone should smack me around for complaining about this. Although I feel if you are going to use the term ""Robuchon"" you should be held that. 

Lastly, the desert plate of a selection of various tarts and treats were al excellent.

One more thing to mention. The service was top notch as expected. Although I do feel that our waiter disappeared at times. When we wanted to complain about the lamb, it took us several minutes to track him down. I had to flag down a busboy from another table to get someone to help.

So there you go. Jose Andres took me on another culinary adventure I will never forget. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the lamb mess up and slightly lacking service made me knock off a star. There is no doubt I will go there again and give them another shot. I will probably need to mortgage my house to afford it, but I hope next time they can give me the 5 star experience that I expect.",OazFg6xrm03jqMbc1ofH9Q,2,1,4,ZrTiOdi1UTzaTILFJqKN0A

+Food.  Yes they specialize in meat.  If you come here, please make sure you order their meat items!
+Fresh West Coast Oysters: These were so good.  You get a choice of east coast or west coast oysters.  I always do west coast because they're smaller and sweeter.  To each their own on this.  You can't go wrong with fresh oysters!
-Cotton Candy Foie Gras: Looks really cool, make sure to order one per person.  Foie that is encased in cotton candy.  The sweet cotton candy is in stark contrast to the salty foie, not something we'd order again.  
-Croquetas de Pollo: This was okay, basically tasted like a fried chicken pot pie.
-Sloppy Joe: I thought this was just okay.  My friend who loves hamburgers liked this but really, I think for such a nice and fancy place, you could order something better.
+Flat Iron: Very flavorful and tender.  It was our favorite cut of meat from the three we ordered.  
+Skirt Steak: Also good and tender but flat iron was better (our whole table of 8 agreed)
+Wagyu Beef Cheeks: Very unctuous and delicious.  There was no gameness and possibly the most tender beef cheeks I've ever had.

+Service: Excellent service.  The waitress kept checking on us.

-Pricey: Or course it is!

-Cocktails: this was just OK.  We tried one with passionfruit and another one that has mescal, both were unimpressive.

Tips:
1.  Make a reservation if possible
2.  Order the meat as soon as you sit down, it takes time. I want to try the suckling pig next time and it takes a full hour to cook
3.  Come hungry!  We were so bummed we couldn't eat more and try more.
4.  Don't come with cheapskates
5.  Dress up",slrH6zwPlP8GHbm4lbGLkw,5,3,4,ahvbuC2FEt2XYXz7SzgKUw
3385411,2016-11-17,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We made reservations for dinner around 7pm for 2 people (my husband and I). The place was busy but not full. At first glance we were loving the open kitchen and different stations set ups. That was until they took us to the very back station, the only one that is closed off, and sat us at a big table for just the two of us. We were the only ones in the room, at a big table in the middle of the room, we just felt awkward. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly but she seemed to have been busy outside of the seafood room that we were located in. We sat for a long time with nothing on our table and the flow of food was off and weird. We were told that the food would come out as it was ready and then the cold Brussels were one of the last things that we were served. Even the table next to us ( that got sat after us) complained about not receiving any of their dishes. 

We ordered 8 ""shared"" items. Some items were only a bite, some were to ""share"" and then the steaks were huge. This concept was weird for us. The 8 items we ordered plus two dessert ""bites"" and a coffee our bill was $170! If we would've ordered a steak 20oz plus would've been over $120. We completely understand sharing and the idea of that is great but maybe this restaurant isn't for 2 people but maybe geared for larger parties. 

We started with the cotton candy foie gras, that was fun and unique. The Ruben was probably our favorite thing, full of flavor and different. We did have to order two of rubens just so we could both try it. The sloppy joes were anything to brag about. The Asian tacos aren't worth your time, the iberico was improperly sliced and was placed on top of just a slice of nori. The blood sausage with uni was under seasoned, this dish you were given 5 bites. As I mentioned before the placement of the dishes were strange, out last two courses were the corn and Brussels we ordered. The Brussels were cold and didn't have enough acid in them. $15 for a bowl of cold Brussels, no thanks. The last dish we received was the corn, a take on Mexican corn. The flavor was there but I could've used a lime or some salt to add to it. 

Dessert was brought out on a serving platter and you got to pick what you wanted which was different and fun. We were celebrating my husbands birthday so our server brought out an extra dessert for him Which was very thoughtful. 

Overall we were disappointed, maybe we should've gotten the suckling pig because that is their featured item. We like to go out to eat and order a lot of things to share and try new things. Not a spot for that without spending a lot. 

If we were to come back it would be to get the ""Vaca vieja"" with the hopes that we could sit in the actual dining room and enjoy that ambiance.",SUX0qrFtr4_LND46buR8rQ,3,1,1,RgyTpXoCwAU6lZGtxP_gWQ

I was slightly disappointed that this wasn't the same Bazaar concept as the one in Beverly Hills, CA. BUT Jose Andres can do no wrong in my eyes. The bar is absolutely beautiful very tall ceilings and huge! this bar could probably sit up to 50 people I'd say. Nicole was our bartender and boy was she a character. Very funny and sweet. I started out with a Pisco Sour (my favorite cocktail) and it was pretty damn good. Its so hard to find a bartender that can make a great Pisco Sour. Andy had a scotch drink but i cannot remember what it was called.

We had a dozen oysters to start, wow they were amazing. we loved how small they were. It seems the smaller the oyster the more fresh they taste. Then we moved on to the Sloppy Joe sandwich. This was truly tasty, beef bolognese, fried straw potatoes, on a steamed bun. Cant go wrong with that! 
We finished our little snack with a few Tahitian Vanilla cream puffs. I will seriously come back for those. Amazing.

The tartare, the pig and Jose's Taco are some of the things that stick out in my mind, but there wasn't a bite of anything that I didn't enjoy. My problem was that my group felt rushed throughout the meal. There wasn't a break in between courses and most of the time the next course was presented before we were even finished with what came before. When the Kobe beef came out (the part I was mostly looking forward to) they started delivering all the other food and it took away from the presentation and time to enjoy that delicacy. I would expect a restaurant of this caliber to have timing figured out to give the guests time to enjoy each course and socialize a little instead of trying to get everything out so they could get us out the door.  I read that they give out certificates when you get the Kobe beef but either they don't do that anymore or in their haste they forgot to give it to us.",Hmg7VfCu9P-GFbZm-G3a1A,0,0,3,KfvQSqigGfPksv9pRxLZQw

The food although a bit expensive was amazing! Each dish was a unique combination of flavors that cause you to close your eyes and savor the flavor. The presentation of each dish and restaurant ambiance is picture worthy. 

At one point I had to ask for a drink twice because the server forgot- however she was sincerely apologetic and offered a free dessert to make up for the faux pas. In addition to the complimentary dessert, the manager Pano, also came by to apologize and offer an additional discount. He also sent my husband a personal email welcoming us back!

Pano and the rest of the team at Bazaar Meat need to be recognized for serving my wife and I the best meal we've had in Vegas... ever.

You must consider (1) price, (2) service, (3) ambience and most importantly (4) the FOOD. But even food is difficult to judge. Did they just make the best steak you've ever had? Or did they make a meal so revolutionary that you not only loved it, but will never forget it?  That is BM.

The suckling pig was excellent, steak was okay (I've had better at Morton's, Delmonico's, Prime, - you get the picture). However, some of the appetizers (especially seafood) were outstanding - for instance the sea urchin (uni) was incredibly fresh, Desserts were nice but again not spectacular - there was a bit of a gimmick with sniffing vanilla bean, coffee bean and rum with a serving of vanilla ice cream that I wasn't overly impressed with.

Two of us spent about two and a half hours eating which seemed perfect.

The real standout was our server and the staff supporting him. There wasn't a dish that was brought to the table where he wasn't immediately present explaining ingredients and why the dish was special. It added to the enjoyment of the meal tremendously. He also told us about the restaurant and went into detail about food and kitchen with pride. Empty plates were cleared quickly and settings were reset regularly.

So Andres' ""tricks"" have gotten a tad old.  The fois gras cotton candy and salt air margarita are fun to try for the first time, but then the thrill factor fades fast. 

The concept here is modern steakhouse - all dark woods and bullheads in masks.  I love all of the open kitchens, but with Bazaar Meat, it feels as if Andres just kinda phoned it in.  On one side of the over-sized menu that feels like it weights a ton is the fun molecular gastronomy little bites and on the other, the meat and potatoes.  

From the molecular side we tried:

fois gras cotton candy 

super-sized pork skin Chicharrón with greek yogurt - They're not kidding when they say it's ""super-sized.""  It's huge, and the fun part was when the server brought out a silver mallet to break it into pieces.  

Bagels and lox cone - a classic

 ""Foieffle"" - a new item I haven't seen before, which was a little bite-sized waffle filled with liver pate, peanut butter and honey.  It was a little gooey and messy to eat.  

Sloppy Joe - was just ok, just like the name says - a mini little sloppy joe

For entree, we split the Wagyu Beef Cheeks entree with Robuchon potatoes and brussels sprouts petals. The potatoes were so buttery and the Brussels sprouts had a nice citrus-y vinaigrette that counterbalanced all of the richness of the potatoes.  I enjoyed the beef cheeks, but it was a little too weird for the beau.  I should have forewarned him by saying this was what headcheese is made from.

Overall, a great Vegas dining experience where style trumps substance.",qEglvl7uKyS1aRn-vX4MkA,2,1,3,KA4WZPNbvDvdqY04a7kXGA
3477806,2015-08-17,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I was so excited about trying Bazaar Meat as I have been to the Bazaar location in LA several times & loved it. Let's just say this isn't the Bazaar in Beverly Hills. Upon arrival the atmosphere is fun, crocodiles on the ceiling, fun mismatched chairs, & an upscale hunting lodge type ambiance. The mismatched lamps so close together makes one feel as though they are in a lamps plus though. The place doesn't know what it is. We were told that it was similar to the Bazaar in LA in that it had tapas, but the tapas were more centered around meats. We asked about every dish we ordered & were told all of them were tapas size but this is not the case. There are a few tapas at the top of the menu but the rest are full size meat & veggie dishes. The menu is confusing. The servers try to explain things but there is to much to cover. If it wants to be a steak house be a steak house, if it wants to be a tapas place specializing in meat then it should be that but trying to be both isn't working.  The prices are astronomical for the quality. Especially since Cleo is next-door & has the best Mediterranean tapas I have ever had at reasonable prices with a casual unpretentious attitude. Bazaar Meat is trying not to be pretentious but it still is a bit & if you don't order the expensive meat dishes you can see the disappointment from your server. Timing was off as well. I know tapas come at all different times but some things came right away & at the same time while other things came almost too late. Our server was extremely professional & seemed to really enjoy his job. He had great knowledge of the menu. Here is what we ordered:
Air bread Kobe sandwich- this item was not on the menu but they were making it special & it was delicious. The best thing I had all night. If you are familiar with the Bazaar in LA, they have an air bread Philly cheese steak & this is similar. I have no idea how they get the bread to be so light & airy & when you bite into it the cheese just melts out. Top it off with fig jam & the Kobe beef & you have yourself a delectable treat. Its $12 for one small sandwich but it is worth every penny.  
Air bread Ruben- Same air bread with the melted cheese concept but I preferred the Kobe beef to the Reuben & didn't care for the thousand island or sauerkraut. 
Brussel sprouts with fruit & lemon air- this dish sounded interesting but proved  inedible. It had a horrible smell & the lemon air was weird. The taste was atrocious & the fruit did not go at all. I took one bite & was done with that. It was  a large portion & not a tapas size.
Cauliflower- 2 servers told us how amazing it was, one told us it tasted like candy. The cauliflower was half black & had a strong burned Smokey flavor that overpowered all the other flavors. There were slivers of lemon on top which made it taste a little better but I don't recommend this dish.
Sloppy Joes- comes with 2 sandwiches that are way bigger than the air bread ones. They are a fun blast back to childhood but that is exactly what it is. They tasted like what you would have gotten in your school lunch & not the gourmet version I was hoping for.
Classic Beef Tartar- This one is neat because it's made at your table.  I am not a big fan of raw meat dishes but in any case it did not taste good at all. The parker rolls it came with were great though and you can make little sliders with it. 
Chicken croquets- this one is fun as it's served in a plastic converse sneaker. My husband didn't like these, he thought they tasted like fair food but I really liked them. They are supposed to taste like fried chicken potpie, which they do & I think they taste great. It would be great if there were little pieces of carrots and peas like a real potpie, but they do taste great.
Don't be a lemon nitrogen drink- this is amazing. If you have had the one in LA its similar to that. It has rum & lemon flavors with edible flowers. The consistency of the nitrogen is like nothing you have ever tasted before. It's a feast for your senses. Truly phenomenal.
Vanilla bean ice cream experience- this is another feast for your senses. You get 3  scoops of Madagascar vanilla bean ice cream with crushed pieces of an ice cream cone recipe from 1920. You get 3 sifters, one with coffee beans, Madagascar vanilla bean, & aged rum. You smell the sifter & then eat the ice cream & drink the rum. The rum is excellent & the whole experience is really fun & decadent.
10 piece dessert sampler- some of these were good but I was not blown away with much. The cream puffs I highly recommend, this one came with hazelnut cream. Mango cake not great. Fruit tarts were good but really tart. Pomegranate tart not great. Salted caramel & coffee chocolate were good. You can get it in a to go box so I had it for breakfast.
Jasmine green tea- excellent. Best green tea I have ever had, coffee is amazing as well.
I would come back here for the air bread, nitrogen cocktail, tea & dessert. If you want an excellent tapas meal go to Cleo.",lzb7u07tDvDS2fz5dJjxPw,1,0,2,jmxvUmVRyCj5gs-hfIliLw

It requires a bit of effort to get to, being in the newly-opened SLS on the north side of the Vegas Strip, but it's well worth every bit.  What you lose in time getting there is repaid tenfold with the experience that you gain.  The restaurant is open and spacious to showcase the expansive kitchen and the expanding stomachs that fill the seats.  The bar, which is separated from the restaurant, is a perfect place to sit and enjoy some well-crafted cocktails while one is waiting in anticipation of the pending feast.  

The cocktails are a solid A- at Bazaar Meat.  I started off with a mezcal old fashion (a drink that has perhaps replaced the classic old fashion temporarily), and it was spot on.  

Then the meal. 

We had an adventurous group and adventure, we did.  We started off with the foie gras cotton candy; a skewered block of foie gras that is wrapped in cotton candy, creating a perfect balance of sweet and salty.  It seemed rude not to get the chef's selection of cured meats, given the setting, so we took that on.  The choice was a great one, especially considering José was able to secure the elusive Jamon Iberico.  Then there was the Sloppy Joe made with beef bolognese - get it.  We decided that the Suckling Pig was a must and it definitely turned out to be.  Don't ask questions and just order it.  We decided we should also be a little healthy, so we ordered the chicken; it comes with heavily-buttered mash potatoes to make it even more amazing.  Needless to say, everyone left full and happy.

3517703,2014-08-28,10,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"While other restaurants market themselves as being different, Bazaar Meat delivers the goods. With a massive menu -- physically heavier than most and with more variety of items than other steakhouses -- this place really is unique. As soon as I learned their opening date I snagged reservations for our party of four. I'm typically weary of new restaurants, but as a fan of Jose Andres I had to give it a shot.

From beginning to end our meal was outstanding. To start, a dozen oysters ($34) -- six medium sized, briny and meaty Paradise oysters and six small, more mild Kusshi oysters. There are four types of tartares on the menu. The classic ($24) is prepared tableside and served with parker house rolls. Don't be afraid to make yourself a steak tartare slider, I did and it was fantastic.

The list of starters is where Andres' influence is most evident with items like cotton candy foie gras, tacos, chicharron, and croquetas. The dish that jumped out at me, though, was the s'mores ($30). Four to an order. Each with wafer thin graham crackers sandwiching slivers of chocolate, velvety smooth and rich foie, and torched and blistered hunks of marshmallow. Try to stay composed after eating one. It's impossible. They're so good you'll be banging the table or letting some expletives fly out of shear amazement. They are sweet, so next time I might consider getting them as a dessert.

Side dishes are delicious as well. Andres takes a playful jab at Joel Robuchon's pomme puree with his own rendition of mashed potatoes ($15) with a menu description that reads, ""butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes."" On the lighter side are the Brussels sprouts petals ($12), served with grapes, apricots, lemon air, and lemon puree. My favorite side was the baby corn ($13). Grilled and topped with mayo, chile piquin, and popcorn powder it's the perfect combo of heat and sweetness.

Our group shared the Spanish-style bone-in rib eye ($80/lb) from Washugyu Ranch, Oregon. It's cooked on their Josper grill (part oven, part grill. Google it. I had to and it looks cool.) using charcoal and grape leaves, giving it plenty of smokiness. It isn't cheap at $80 a pound. Our steak came in at 3.13 pounds, which equals an empty wallet at the end of the night. But, it's one of the best I've had in town. 

Desserts are on the small side. They're about the size of single serving buffet desserts.  We ordered ten ($25) consisting of five different types served in a cute bakery-style box. The order: dark chocolate and olive oil cream puff; dark chocolate and aged rum cake; caramelized puff pastry with bacon, strawberries and cream; milk chocolate peanut, and caramel tart; and caramelized puff pastry with chocolate, caramel and sea salt. All were great, particularly the dark chocolate cake and the bacon and strawberry puff pastry.

Service was exceptional all night. Our server (formerly of L'Atelier) and busser offered great recommendations and checked in frequently to make sure all of our needs were met. The only negative is that their dessert menu didn't list all ingredients for the dishes. My friend, who has a nut allergy, reacted to hazelnuts in the dark chocolate and aged rum cake forcing her to rush home after dinner for allergy medicine. Luckily, she was fine and we had a fantastic meal. Bazaar Meat might be the new kid on the block, but in my book they're already one of the top three steak houses in Vegas.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,21,20,5,GdtOmJ6S6bDjW149PmGs1A

Super unique experience. I compared the feeling I felt, walking in to the first time I walked into a multi-course preset meal. I have been telling my friends that I was brought, back to the first time I dined at the French Laundry, or Masa, and Nobu. 

I tingled.

The food was excellent, and, was very unique. Steakhouse + Tapas = Bazaar Meat. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Even though it's labelled as such, it didn't quite make sense until our meal started unfolding in front of us, like a really good book.

I fell in love with everything that was set in front of us. Highlights include the Cold Smoked Oysters, Liquid Olives (thinking about these 2, makes me come, a little), the matured meat (totally different flavor profile) and the play on a black forest dessert. We probably sampled a dozen+ items, all of which were great, at worst.

Unfortunately, I didn't feel like a cocktail when we sat, or with apps like I tend to do, so I feel like I missed out on a little of what my normal dining experience would be. (Well, maybe that's fortunate. It gives me more reason to return.)

As a twenty-something just starting out in life, some of the prices were a bit out of our range, but we managed to find a few items that were under $45.  The best part is, is that even though the food is expensive, everything is shareable.  Our party consisted of three young women- we ordered two meat dishes (can't remember the names but one was $45 and the other was $38), asparagus (delicious!), the mashed potatoes (yum!), sloppy joe's (so good!), we each had a cotton candy fois gras ( a must try, if not just for the experience), and our own desserts to finish off the meal. 

The best part was the cocktails.  All of them are probably delicious based on the three we did try - the Punk Lemonade (16 bucks... same price as a *disgusting* vodka cran at Drais nightclub!), the margarita, and a cotton candy cocktail.

Nick was our server and he was very patient and helpful in picking out items, but more importantly didn't make us feel stupid for being poor and ordering the cheapest things we could find.

Price - Not worth the amount of food. Not even close. The amount of wagyu that came out could have fit in my hand. The jamón was sliced unbelievably thin and amounted to about 4 ounces. The total for everything was over $500.

3724684,2016-12-06,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"TL;DR: Mixed emotions. Food at times stellar, at times ordinary.  Set menu service too rushed. Wine list exorbitant. 

The full skinny:

We were very excited to try a Jose Andres restaurant for the first time, and Bazaar Meat seemed right up our alley. We showed up on time for our reservation and were immediately shown to our table by a stunning and friendly hostess from Hawaii. Loved the uniforms! Walking through the restaurant is an experience in and of itself, with the open kitchen steaming away and the cool lighting and decor in the dining room. 

We were seated and after consideration decided to have the ""Jose's Way"" tasting menu at $185 per person. Surprisingly there was no available wine pairing, so we were forced to make a selection from a list that can only be described as obscenely expensive. The promised assistance of a sommelier never happened, so we settled on one of the most ""modestly priced"" wines on the list, a Spanish red, and our choice was actually complimented by the person who came to open and pour. The wine turned out to be very nice and a great accompaniment to our meal, if overpriced. 

Shortly thereafter, the courses started to arrive, and arrive they did, with a quickness! At one point we had three courses sitting on the table waiting for us before we even had a chance to try the first. It detracted from the experience because we felt very rushed. This actually happened twice during the meal. A food runner would drop off a plate, rush through a description, and leave. When spending $300 per person (with wine) for a meal, one would hope for the pacing of the courses to be more spread out. It was so bad that at one point we even asked our server to make sure the kitchen didn't fire our steak too soon for us to enjoy it while hot. She accommodated this request but the experience still felt overly rushed, especially at this price point. 

The food itself ranged from the ordinary (the ""smoked"" oyster was overwhelmed by the foam that came on top; the steak tartare, which I was really anticipating, was over-sauced to the point that the meat could not really be tasted, but the Parker House rolls accompanying were fantastic; the cauliflower ""steak"" that accompanied the meat was dry and plain;) to the sublime (the beefsteak tomato ""tartare"" was a revelation and our entree rib steak was among the best I have ever tasted, and of course the foie gras with cotton candy was stunning.) 

Service was efficient if not overly accommodating. We asked our server where they were sourcing such excellent tomatoes in December. She returned a bit later and said ""well the chef is really busy right now but he told me 'California.'"" Not exactly the answer I was looking for or expected from an organization known for attention to every detail in their dishes.

The bottom line is that while I did have very high expectations and many of them were met, I could not escape feeling that I was dining in a ""celebrity chef"" restaurant on an assembly line. If I do go back, and I will not rule that out, I would definitely tell the server to make sure the courses don't come from the kitchen too quickly and will also investigate their corkage policies so that we don't feel like we are being fleeced on the wine selections. I enjoyed the overall experience (aside from feeling rushed) but can't escape the nagging feeling that we paid too much.",JCGmowWM3OvrnJrYx4dglw,1,1,4,IH2xGPi1aZcyHHvzfJGQrQ

The crispy pork chicharron was absolutely a fun and delicious experience. The Greek yogurt that they serve with it balanced nicely. The table side smashing into pieces was fun. 

You have to get the iberico ham. It's $70 but it is worth every single penny. I'm talking melt in your mouth buttery deliciousness. Our server recommended the pan de cristal to go with it and it is the best advice I have ever taken. It is topped with delicious smashed tomatoes. The crust was perfectly toasted and the inside bread was deliciously moist with the tomatoes on top. 

The braised beef cheeks were the star of this show. The most tender meat I have ever had. No knife necessary. The oranges put me off at first but brought a welcomed sweetness that balances perfectly with the sauce. 

Save room for dessert there was an awesome chef selection box featuring a variety of small items, but we were just too full to partake and chose to have two of the selections that were a perfect way to end our meal. 

We were so completely over the top impressed with every aspect of our experience. The staff is welcoming and friendly, not uppety like some fine dining service.

The ""traditional"" carpaccio is as good as there is. The chef's selection of charcuterie is worth trying, a remarkable variety. The steaks, especially the ribeyes, are terrific. However, keep in mind that everything is served tapas or family style...including the steaks. It is not a traditional steakhouse. You do not need to order a steak for each person. If you do, they come out separately. I'd recommend having fun with the smaller plates and then getting a steak to share. 
The wine list, especially the Spanish and French selections, is impressive but pricey.

We also added the foie gras cotton candy to our order. If there is a weak spot in the tasting menu, it is the crisp potato pillows. I believe they would be better with some sort of filling, or omitted in favor of something more interesting. The lox and cream cheese cones are out of this world. One tiny piece of perfection. The desserts included in the tasting menu were a touch lackluster- I don't negate stars for this because I came for the meat. The other items in the tasting menu were stellar. Be aware a party of two must order the same tasting menu. I suppose this means we must go back to try the other two menus. ;) The service was incredibly attentive. I recommend the nitro lemon drink in the featured cocktail list. It's a fun tableside presentation. The quantity is not huge but the nitro lemon concoction is fabulous. With tip,

It's pricy, so be prepared. And the amount of food you get for the price is small. But... Here, I'm also paying for the experience.  The food is inventive and fun to eat.  All of my fellow diners really enjoyed!

I was with a party if 9 and we ate tapas style, so here are my thoughts on each.

 Amazing:
- corned beef sandwich (fun!)
- made at table beef tartare (fun!)
- bison buffalo tacos (fun!)
- by the pound ribeye (very flavorful!)
- lamb (very flavorful)
- chicken croquets 
- yellowfin sushi
- mushroom side (flavored like escargot usually is - garlic!)
- signature cotton candy drink

Okay, would eat again:
- Brussels 
- grilled cauliflower 
- desert (we got $50 sampler - it was just okay - a lot of $2 chocolates on it which makes the price really not worth it)
- smoked oysters (I'm not a fan of oysters but my fellow diners liked)
- liquid nitrogen table side drink (strong, but fun to watch them make)

Not a fan:
- suckling pig (this is their signature dish and I don't get it- fatty on the inside and super crunchy on the outside. Not tasty and a weird mix of textures for me. Most of my fellow diners agree.)
- fish entree (this is entire fish option. I should have remembered rule of thumb - don't order fish in a meat restaurant. Not fresh!!! No one at my table of 9 liked)",bvuxor346zDAen3poNl9qA,3,1,5,oq6KhZemechhzDl0cbENiw

3778987,2015-05-01,18,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Latest visit was absolutely AMAZING! No surprise here with the genius chef, and the admiration of my life Jose Andres. 

Came here to celebrate dude's bday. After a long day of partying and baking in the sun, we were famished. The hostess was very sweet and seated us right away. Our server John was super nice, very authentic and most importantly extremely knowledgeable about food, ingredients, where they came from, origins. Now, I'm not a foodie, I am a food lover and a food nerd. I love to hear about how the dishes are made, where the ingredients came from, and all the nerdy facts. Throughout the meal, John explained everything to us, and patiently answered all my nerdy questions. 

We started off with the signature cotton candy foie gras, i've had a million times and love it every single time. Next up was the Super Giant Pork Skin Chicheroins, with a special greek yogurt dip mixed with extra virgin olive oil. I confess, I've traveled the world and ate lots of olives but Spanish olives and olive oil still holds a special place in my heart, and that small dash was just the right amount to activate the tastebuds. Next was the Smoke and Ice Fresh Oysters, Jose is a skilled magician with molecular gastronomy, and the oysters was topped with a foam full of flavors and ingredients. The Gazpacho was a simple, popular dish, but as always there's a twist, the soup still retained the old familiar taste but with an extra little something that makes you wonder what was THAT?  

Now onto the raw meat stuff for this little cani-hoard, yours truly. The Classic Tartare was made with top quality cut, mixed in a bowl right in front of you with a raw egg and very few simple but top quality seasoning, garnished with eatable pretty flowers. The carpaccio was beautifully presented topped with capers and aged cheese. Of course, a perfect Spanish meal is not complete without the world famous Jamón Ibérico, flown in from Spain. For those of us that are lucky enough to taste it in our lives, it's truly better than crack! This stuff is hard to get in the US, and I was very happy I got to have it here. Mix that with the Lucía's Salad 2 beautifully perfect pieces of Endive leaves with cheese and garnish, and I can tell my mom I ate some veggies. lol. 

This place isn't called Bazaar meat for nothing, we got the ribeye with a side of mushrooms. The ribeye was truly a very quality cut and the meat was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. The mushrooms were no ordinary mushrooms either, definitely some magic mushrooms. To truly comprehend Jose's molecular gastronomy skills, we ordered one of the frozen cocktails, where a bowl containing several liquid mixture is stirred while liquid nitrogen is poured it making a very tasty but potent concoction that will truly ""knock your senses out"". Enjoy this while eating the variety of freshly made dessert bites in house, and I thought I had died and went to heaven: foodie heaven. 

Dude and I absolutely loved our meal, everything was wonderful and I highly recommend one of the chef's selection coursed menus!",8ZryN_S-n48g6rsa3W3QtQ,21,23,5,0k9ka5gsLjKXCLKGp8P4Tw

- Suckling Pig (4.5 stars): This is what they are known for, and it is a completely unique dish; unlike any pork I've ever had.  The outer skin is crisp and caramelized, and underneath this thin veneer is a layer of fatty, tender, flavorful meat.  Two of our group loved it, one thought it was a bit too fatty.

- Carpaccio on a stick - (5+ stars): The highlight of the evening for two of our party and loved by all of us.  Absolutely amazing warm dipping foam sauce.  Please order this.  We were all fighting over the last one.

- Classic Beef Tartare: (5+ stars): the favorite dish of one of our party, it is outstanding.  Diced cubes of beef tartare, egg yolk, spice, mustard.  Amazing!

- Cotton Candy Foie Gras (4 stars): Loved by two of our group, one thought it was okay.  Sweet Foie gras surrounded by cotton candy.

- Chicken Croquettes (4.5 stars): Delicious, warm, great for sharing, enjoyed by all

- Pillin Peppers (4 stars): flavorful and spicy, served flat in marinade, enjoyed by all, one said just good not great

- Cauliflower (4 stars): Delicious, aromatic, roasted cauliflower in a pine nut reduction.  Awesome

- Roubuchon Potatoes (4.5 stars): one of our party said they were the best he's ever had.  Everyone enjoyed, one commented that there wasn't much flavor, just perfectly executed potatoes.

service was good, and attentive. 

steaks were huge but maybe I expected it to taste a certain way.

after paying $150 for a 3 week ""dry aged"" steak I can honestly say I can cook my own bone in rib-eye that'll taste better than what I had at Bazaar no aging just letting it sit and come down to room temperature before cooking. Even tho it was still good, it was a little under seasoned for my taste, I couldn't help but to ask if they had any steak sauce. They did, but I didn't care for the steak sauce either. 

Probably wouldn't come back by choice simply because the taste was not a wow factor according to the price. To me at least.

But if you're charging premium prices, then everything should taste great. That or perhaps the waitress could have suggested some other food items...? 

Tableside Cocktail (don't have the exact description but it had lemon and grapefruit flavors)
--- It was cool to see this made, but the cocktail was very small (even though she made a huge batch of extras, but didn't serve it) and it was very bitter from the grapefruit. 

Lucía's Salad: Endive Caesar salad, Parmesan, anchovy, air croutons ($15)
--- I can't believe this item is on the menu. This was their take on a ""Caesar salad"", but seriously... don't charge $15 for 6 little nothings! See photo!

Vittore 1950: Tenderloin of beef, black pepper, Parmesan cheese, capers, croutons, Sherry dressing ($24)
--- This was fantastic, would highly recommend it. One of the best carpaccio I've ever had.

Cotton Candy Foie Gras: Crispy amaranth ($8 each)
--- Really enjoyed this. You have to put the whole thing in your mouth at once... the fois gras piece just melts in your mouth. 

Cauliflower Steak: Pine nuts, preserved lemon ($15)
--- I love cauliflower, but this was probably the worst I've had other than eating it raw... Just tasted burnt... didn't taste the pine nuts or much of the lemon.

Brussels Sprouts Petals: Apricots, grapes, lemon air, lemon purée ($15)
--- Tasted okay... wasn't particularly impressed and wasn't all that flavourful. Doesn't help that the portion size is small.

Washugyu/Angus (Lindsay Ranch, OR) ($98/lb)
--- Ours was around 2.5 lbs? But when it came out there wasn't as much meat... probably mostly bone. The steak was a letdown... Considering it cost us over $200, this should have tasted like butter and super flavorful. It was tender, but lacked flavor overall. None of us were fighting to have the last few pieces, and we were left hungry... 
Just to compare, we had a 24oz rib-eye steak at Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill @ The Venetian and THAT steak was A-MAZING, had more meat despite being less lbs and was also cheaper ($95 total with toppings and a side). So I'm not trying to be a steak snob by shooting this one down.

Dessert Cart (don't have prices)
--- This looked beautiful when they brought it over. Had a praline pastry inspired by Pierre Hermé, chocolate eclair, tart, tiramisu cream puffs (no photo). Overall they were good.

Overall Service = okay. Didn't provide much recommendations other than explaining how to order the steaks... which in the end wasn't great.

Overall Ambience = It's okay. I love looking at the steak counter, but didn't help the steak wasn't great.

I hate this keyboard and I feel like I won't review as well because of it. I am sacrificing these reasons because I did not want to deny anyone who is in Vegas looking for a steak house to miss out on Bazaar Meats. The thought of my not writing a review becoming the cause for someone to eat at a mediocre restaurant did not sit well with me.

As I lay here on this semi comfortable couch staring at my view of Las Vegas being embraced by the desert I cannot help but remember every bite of last night's meal. Simply put I had the best steak of my life and if that wasn't enough (and it easily could have been) the robouchon mashed potatoes were even better. So good that my disappointment in the spinach dish we got has been erased from my memory till that sentence. Sure the service was great and the cocktails were on point but that's what expect out of Vegas. The food up until last night has always just been ok till now. 

2.25 pound rib eye for two was more than enough for the three of us eating. The mashed potatoes was clearly not enough. Not because the portion was tiny but we just wanted more. I personally have never potatoes this smooth or creamy in my life. The butter on it complimented it perfectly. Oh yeah and the streak was ridiculously great. Cooked to perfection with the perfect crust. We were warned that it was a 50 minute wait on the rib eyes but it was obviously well worth it. 

Though it's not on the heart of the strip the travel to it is worth it if that's the debate you're having. I know that next time I come to Vegas every effort will be made to dine here again or at the least get a soda cup of the mashed potatoes to slurp on like a milkshake as I walk down Las Vegas boulevard dreaming of what Vegas has in store for me next.",2t_dWhdm_ZDiseqtfv-p0w,1,0,5,fuh38dJEKVXudoxO-GbHWg

The Mr and I were looking for an intimate, upscale, romantic, long more-than-a-bottle experience and we narrowed the choices down by way of cuisine and again, no shortage of Steakhouse's either. After skimming through reviews and stars to assist us in finding that new culinary adventure ... Bazaar Meat was our target. 
We arrived about 20 minutes early as we generally start off with a drink and relax at the bar until our table is ready. We were happily greeted by the hostess and shown to the bar instantly upon arrival. 
The bartender was a younger guy, friendly and helpful,  he crafted our cocktails in front of us and waited for us to taste them to ensure we were pleased. We chatted a bit with him and we scoped out the restaurant and all its gorgeousness. 
Mr W and I LOVE to cook so when we spotted the wood burning grills across the bar we had to walk over and admire/stare/swoon/adore the equipment, technique and woods that are used to prepare the meats. 
Oh the meats! Beautiful marbled cuts, hanging suckling pigs, legs and sausages all encased and on display. Simply glorious. A true Bazaar that you just want to walk through and admire. Everything is open which is also eye catching and inviting to your dining experience here. 
We did a tasting menu and as stated in most of the reviews the foie gras wrapped in cotton candy is a delectable experience. Creamy with a crunch from the amaranth ( a Mexican cuisine staple used in candies as well ) and the cotton candy delicately melts around the foie gras as you bite. Mmmm! Perfect with the light bodied Pinot noir we selected. 
The giant chicharron was airy and crisp with a light smokey seasoning and a yogurt dipping sauce. 
We each had the tomato gazpacho ... Hmmm, tangy, spicy, no bell pepper, no it's lemon ... Pretty much we didn't know if we liked it or not. Not good with the Pinot (FYI) but not a bad dish either. 
The pork sausage was dense, firm and full of flavor. Loved it! The skirt steak was cut thick and cooked at a perfect medium rare. Very tender and delicious. 
By this time our Brunello was well decanted and we moved on to the wagyu beef cheeks. Holy Mary! So tender, so perfectly done we dubbed them the favorite dish of the night. 
As you can tell, this experience lasted a few hours just as we had hoped and everything was more than memorable including the mini desserts.

The preparation and presentation is pretty bazaar as in its restaurant name. This place is also known for their tapas, but Believe Me, they are Really small plates at a hefty price.  So if you're not impressed by the presentation, by the small portion size, and by the price you'll be disappointed because the food is pretty standard.

As for myself I've given this place a couple tries. The first time around we tried a little bit of everything based on the server's recommendation. We had the endive salad, king crab & shrimp cocktail, vittore carpaccio, live scallops, gazpacho shots (compliments of the chef), jamon croquettes, the magic mojito (gimmicky melt the cotton candy type of drink), and a couple of desserts. I didn't understand what the high ratings were about?! After all, I did come here based on the yelp reviews and I was a bit disappointed with my experience. Every dish was mediocre, but eventually decided to give it another try....

Second time around I figured maybe we should try the steak since we didn't try it the first time. So we went with the Rosewood, TX wagyu (over 2lbs, bone is included in the weight, $75/lb), button mushrooms, scallops, delmonico potatoes, a couple wines, chicken croquettes, & don't be lemon drink which was served table side with dry ice.

I was really hoping to enjoy this time around given that we were trying out different dishes, but my experience was still the same as the first. One thing I truly enjoyed were the button mushrooms. Super juicy & rich in flavor! As for the steak it was over seasoned making it way too salty, but it was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a nice char on the outside. 

Each time, we've spent $300+ and have walked out with our tummies feeling unsatisfied. 

Besides the food I do commend the fabulous service they have here.",tp77HGAm4JVX3BL50v7Ajg,6,2,3,ZcVenfXtOXOhiRXeCXBv3w

They offer various types of tapas with a very confusing menu.  By confusing I mean just way too much information like you're reading a book!  Please condense it!  Lots of meat choices and if you're willing to splurge you can even order yourself a full blown pig.

We ordered a taste flight menu for $65 which lets you sample various items and includes a dessert at the end.  All of the items were good and impressive presentation.  However for the prices I felt the portions were extremely small.  Ambience is very over the top, the liquid nitrogen infused lemon drink was really good, but it didn't give me the ""wow"" factor.  It's one of those places you saw, you conquered and then left.  I really didn't understand how a party of eight isn't allowed to order whatever they choose?!

The steak itself was inedible. A bone ribeye (my go to) was $75 a pound and minimum size steak of 2lbs - I figured I had to try it. The beef was so tough the steak knife couldn't cut it.

The menu is exactly what my wife and I like.  Every item we ordered was a taste experience.  Its always great when you can tell how much though went in to bringing the flavors together in a dish.  From the live scallops, to the foie gras cotton candy, to the steak tartare the flavors were wonderful.  Then came the steak... which quickly shot up my list of favorite steaks.  The slow cook created a wonderful char yet the steak itself melted in our mouths.  A truly wonderful experience.  

But, what makes a great dinner experience complete is great service.  Nick Weaver was excellent.  He took time to explain the menu and help us create our memorable dinner experience.  Nick was attentive and even more, we left that night feelling like we had a new friend.  Thank you Nick for everything.  We can't wait to come back.

The rest of the Bazaar Meat team was great as well.  Christopher Bugeya  (Assistant GM) was just as attentive as Nick.  And everyone else who came by the table to help made us feel really special.

This guy is the king of ""molecular gastronomy"" - which we have had the pleasure of trying at both The Bazaar in Beverly Hills and 'e (that's right, just e') the private dining experience at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. Both 5 star experiences also. There is a price that comes with this - but you will likely not have a more memorable gastronomical experience than at a Jose' Andres establishment, this I can say with great enthusiasm! 

I am truly a more visual and tactile individual and my words could never provide any justice to my actual experience! We have enjoyed all Jose Andres restaurants and tasting menus for different reasons. This location has amazing decor, cures it's own ""meat"" as in the name! Has a pseudo hunting decor in the middle of the Vegas strip (makes sense...meat again)!  

When we arrived, we were offered a seat in the private dining room which is known as the Silver Room (it has been passed on that this was an original control room for the roller coaster that was part of the former Sahara) - it is a stunning room and we are sure we would have been treated in grand style...however, we chose to eat at the counter, where we could watch the chef's in action. We also knew Jose Andres was in town during this period to work set up solar cooking at a music and culinary festival. We had no such luck of seeing him on this evening! 

Since Jose Andres is known for working with liquid nitrogen...we wanted to start the evening off right, with a cocktail called the, LN2 Don't Be a Lemon. It is made table side of liquid nitrogen. Then our evening got off as a tasting menu of various meats and I will let my photos do the talking...

3948068,2015-01-01,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"First, let me be clear that our night did NOT go perfectly. However, the management did a very very good job of recovering and the food was good enough to smooth things over. Mistakes happen and I think restaurants deserve credit for handling mistakes well. I can't give them a 5 but I will give them a 4 and will return in the future with high expectations. I would like to mention our waiter, Oscar, did good work. 

On to the food, it you know Jose Andres, you know that not everything is going to be straight-forward. To me, this is a big plus, to the group from Russia next to us at the bar, this might not have been, since they started flicking all the foam off their drinks. 
I have been to Mini-Bar, e, and Jaleo so I knew what to expect. 

Cocktails: We had the ""Penecillin"" a whiskey based drink misted with a extremely with a extremely smokey/peaty laphroaig scotch. Excellent, but it took 15 minutes to get it. 
We also had the Honey-Truffle drink (Bees and Honey? or something) which I didn't love by my wife liked so much she ordered them all night. At the very least it was an interesting combination of sweet and savory. 

Foie and Cotton candy bite; These are goofy, fun and really tasty. Worth getting. 

Spherized olives with whole olives: Always fun, but EXTREMELY potent. If you don't love olives and anchovies you wont love these. They totally blew out my taste buds, but I enjoyed them. 

Gazpacho Shots: Very tasty, and a great palate cleanser. Not totally necessary though. 

Smoked Oysters: My wife is a big oyster fan, but I can take or leave them. These, however, were really great. The smoke presentation is both a novelty and a compliment to flavored foam. I wished they would have loosened them as I had to dig around in the foam to get them to separate.

Salmon Tartar: Ya, so this is totally excellent. The Salmon roe, however, isn't necessary and throws off the balance of the the dish. Just eat it separately as we did. The crispy seaweed crackers are great but so delicate. Need to be twice as thick. 

Steak Tartar ""The classic"": These guys KNOW tartar, wonderful I could just eat that all night. Its not classic though, its much better. 

Steak Carpacio Grissini: Served on a bread stick, it is pretty fun, but lets not kid ourselves, this dish is ALL about that parmigiana espuma. Dear god, I could just eat that with a spoon. Did I double and triple dip? Yes. Yes I did. Now, is it worth $26? Eh, probably not, you are paying for the wagyu which really isn't the star of the show. 

Giant Chicharron : Its  giant and delicious. It won't blow your mind, but it makes a great thing to nibble on between courses. 

Robuchon potatoes: Do you want to die young? And happy? Get these. 

Wagyu Beef Cheeks with Mojo rojo: Holy Crap, why is this stuck down in ""other meats"" ?  This should be front and center. I can get great steaks at a dozen other place in the city, but this dish is a standout and unique.  


All-in-all I give this place a strong thumbs up. It is not as daring as E or as polished Rubechon but it is fun and tasty and we will be back soon. 

Notes for the restaurant: 
1) Hand the women the menu first
2) I would appreciate some assistance with sizing. The foie is a single bite, the olives are ten bites. How am I to know what a ""small bites"" means. 
3) Your bar staff needs more staff. 
4) It would be good if you could help smaller groups order the right amount of food. When two people are about to order too much, you should let us know.
5) Your by-the-glass selections are kinda weak.",Uwu6MCuv_YIxHL0kDxEVxg,3,0,4,BX2feYy_4dHXdqr4VRMfww
3961275,2017-09-18,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"If the term didn't already have a sordid history from Early Internet, I would say that this was the best meat party I have ever been to.

I recently went to Bazaar Meat while in town for a bachelor party and enjoyed it as much past José Andrés experiences. Plenty of people have written up the menu, but particular items of note were:

- All of the cocktails were top notch in taste and presentation, but particularly recommend the Aladdin Manhattan
- The first caviar flight was delicious, and comes out on a custom-designed glass cascade that was pretty incredible.
- Get the classic beef tartare - it's prepared table-side. Goes well with the Iberico Jamon, which I think comes from unicorn meat.
- The A5 Wagyu Ribeye almost caused me to weep with joy
- The suckling pig was a really cool experience and we all loved it, but I personally liked the steak even better
- The butter mashed potatoes are even better than advertised. The asparagus was perfectly cooked but not special, and the cauliflower steak was fairly bland.

Our waiter handled our group wonderfully and really added to the experience. The only blip in the service was our entrees. We got the suckling pig first and then no sides or steak for 10 minutes, and when we asked the waiter and expo, they both said it was about to be brought out, but wasn't. We later learned that this is by design to enjoy things in the order that the chef wants. I am game for that sort of thing, but in this case one member of our party didn't eat pork and so he had nothing to eat for ten minutes. Had the staff explained this to us, we could have cleared it up but it came across like the food was just poorly plated.

After dinner, the GM, Pano Argyriades, gave us a great tour of the whole restaurant and we got to learn a lot about how they run the restaurant. 

I highly recommend Bazaar Meat to anyone in town!",n2bUMPbNNUxz0N2WkyiMjg,3,3,5,he4UIKmTSO2Y0DVheHG-_Q
3973016,2015-07-31,13,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Bazaar Meat by José Andrés has a summer tasting menu with fewer items than their three normal tasting menus.  This was my chance to give Bazaar a try.

I was seated at a long bar that has two sushi style refrigerated cabinets and I was able to watch two of the chefs cut very thin slices from the Iberico ham and make steak tartare.  I was soon brought the iced tea I ordered and it was refilled several times during my time there.  

I was given the three tasting menus and the huge regular menu.  I already knew I wanted the summer tasting menu and I asked my server, Edward, about it.  He was going to retrieve one for me but I knew that was what I wanted so he merely took my order afgter asking how I wanted my chateaubriand cooked and if I had any food allergies.

The first thing brought to me was the giant pork skin chicharrón in some white butcher paper.  After seeing the huge piece of chicharrón, the person took a mallet and whacked the pork skin so it was broken into more manageable pieces to eat.  It was served with Greek yogurt that was almost foamy and both the pork rind and the yogurt were dusted with za'atar spices.  It was very good.

Next up was a trip of small bites--a bagel and lox cone, a liquid green olive, and an olive stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy.  The cone was made was made from bagel dough and was filled with cream cheese and topped with salmon row.  The olives were both good but the stuffed one was the best.

Next up were 6 croquetas de jamón, small fried balls stuffed with béchamel with Iberico ham.  These were excellent.  There was a lot of béchamel flavoring but the ham flavor was not quite there.

The next item was an Italian grissini--a long breadstick--that was wrapped with very thinly sliced beef and served with a caramelized onion purée.  Really good.

Then the chateaubriand was brought.  The hot plate was put on a raised wooden platform and the server put two of the slices on my plate and spooned perigord sauce over the pieces.  There was also a folded napkin filled with pomme soufflé.  These were puffed potatoes like 4D potato chips.  The steak was seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of salt and pepper. Along with all of this was a serving of Robuchon potatoes which the menu describes as ""butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes.  It was creamy and delightful!!  Still one more accompaniment to the main course was some grilled asparagus on Romesco sauce.

After this, I was brought three small desserts--a lemon meringue tart, a chocolate cream puff, and a chocolate bon bon.  

Almost everything was very good but I'd subtract some for the deserts.  There's nothing creative there.  These type of small tarts and cream puffs are what you'd find on a higher end buffet line and was so out of character with the rest of the meal.

Service was excellent.  Edward refilled my iced tea often and was always around for anything I might need.

One thing of note, as I was watching the one cook making steak tartare, he would put a small tasting fork into the mixture and check the flavor and then tossed the fork.  I told him if he wanted a third party, neutral taster, I'd volunteer.  Just after my dessert was brought, he handed over the counter a steak tartar slider with a raw quail egg.  A really nice gesture and a perfect ending to a fun and flavorful meal.

This gave me a chance to try some of Bazaar's food in smaller portions.  I recommend trying the summer tasting menu.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,27,20,4,M5hm1Q6vj9yha9HnU9drLQ

Everything we had was delicious and had a fun presentation. The service is slow and relaxed pace if you are getting many small dishes so leave plenty of time for dinner.

As far as the food goes, the Secreto Iberico de Bellota was phenomenal. A very tender, flavorful cut of pork from Spain. The A5 Kobe was solid, but pricey. Cooked table side on a stone is a nice touch. Lastly, the Wagyu/Black Angus Ribeye was good, but I would order multiple smaller, cheaper cuts if I were to return. It just didn't carry it's weight.

To me the mark of a good restaurant is how they treat a single diner. Even when I am in a group I tend to look around and see how the place prioritized a solo patron: do they automatically point the person to the bar to seat, or do they ask? Does the restaurant make sure the single patron is not forgotten -- drinks filled, dishes cleared quickly? If sat at a table, is the person tucked into a corner? Does the wait staff modify the presentation of the specials, since solo diners are not as into the ""meal as show"" idea?

Well, on these points my experience fell flat. I was first offered a seat at a the kitchen bar (not the drink bar) and when I asked for a instead, was placed almost in the last table in the back of this huge restaurant. I was sat at a table with room for four, but was walked by a dozen other open 4-tops in a much luckier area of the restaurant. 


I hope you like reading, since I was handed five different menus. Three explaining the fixed price multi-course options, the standard menu, and the huge wine list. The waiter's explanation was it made the menu easier. But with five menus in front of me, I felt like I was studying at a college library. 

I ordered the $125 multi course option, so there's lots of small plates with a bite or two coming out. Dirty plates stayed on the table for a long time. Drink glass (no alcohol) stayed empty for really long times (a good 5-7 minutes). Since I was way in the back I was near a back kitchen entrance, probably where the dish and prep areas are, so wait members frequently went by my table without grabbing something dirty off the table.

I'd say the single diner experience here is less than desirable, to be nice.

However, the food is very good. Endive Caesar salad was tasty. The crunchy pork skin, a super light pork-find style poof, is tasty. Tartare slider was quite good too. 

The buttered potatoes are decadent and should probably come with a side of Lipitor. Seriously, a scoop on your plate looks like a slab of butter. But they are delicious and have a fantastic rice/potato mill consistency. Chateuabriand was tender but came to me chilly -- another common solo diner challenge as food often sits. 

The $120 per person fixed price menu is plenty of food for one person, without a doubt.

Overall the food was well above average. If you're in Vegas with a group, you'd probably like it here. But on a simple business dinner, even with a group? Maybe not so much.",2dhcUIFlwFTCy27zE-K_9Q,2,0,3,5dmnDm33H07npwujrPLWeA

Below are a few reasons why this place is not a 5 in my opinion. 
- We asked for straws and they were handed to me with the busser's barehand.  Yuck!!! I know this is done behind the scene, but I really don't need to see it. 
- Table top was so thin that it kept moving
- When I am paying $185 per person I expect not to have spots on my utensils. I would like clean and polished silverwares 
- Toilet paper was rough
- Drink was empty for about 30 minutes and was never removed nor offered another drinks. 
-Food was really salty except for the steak, the steak could have used a little more seasoning. 

What we like:
-Crossed eye Mary was super delicious- perfect, none of the ingredients was overpowering 
-Bagels & Lox Cone had the best salmon roe I ever had
-Beefsteak tomato- was so innovative and delicious 
-The boys enjoyed the Robuchon Potatoes the most- unfortunately the Rib Eye should had been the highlight of our meal.

We ordered the bread with tomato spread, Kobe beef, a total of 4 lbs of ribeye (the server told us we HAVE TO ORDER A MINIMUM OF 2 POUNDS for EACH ribeye) for the 4 of us, mashed potatoes and baby corn with cheese.   
  Check out the photo of the steak, does that look like it's 2 pounds?????  And we got 2 of those to make 4 pounds). Everything was just ok, the rib eye steaks were under seasoned and not that tender, the Kobe beef, what??????

Seats were very cozy, like we were eating in someone's lounge. Service was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive and welcoming. The restaurant is a bit off strip but it was a cheap Lyft there and back. Took about 15 minutes. 

We really struggled with how to order as two couples with very different tastes and priorities but our server helped us sort it out. I'm glad we had a little extra time to get some of the fun showy / tableside cocktails. A MUST. I also adored the cherry martini which was more of a personal show . Our server also did a little something special for our Anniversary which was really sweet and meant a lot to us. 

This is true tapas with 4 kitchens each specializing in something different. The meat selection is unparalleled but they also have fantastic ""meats from the sea"". I also adored the Brussels sprout petals with lemon foam. 

This is very much a dining experience so come with an open mind (and an open wallet). Try some of the molecular gastronomy cocktails and don't leave without having at least one foie gras cotton candy appetizers.",1LFSJHvSErX-wjJ6Vtl9AQ,0,0,5,5s1VdqDqLW0h5C7pN_clyw

4074563,2015-10-06,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I finally got around to checking out Bazaar Meat after meaning to go here for over a year, and I'm so glad I did! The first thing that drew me in was the overall atmosphere of the place. It's dark with really bizarre decor and a huge fire pit right in the middle of the dining room. I really love the multiple kitchen concept here and as a true foodie, it was super entertaining to watch the chefs busy at work preparing my meal. 

The best tip I can give you is that if you come here, BRING MONEY. I mean serious amounts of it. This is NOT a bargain restaurant but I thought the high price tag was worth it. This was not just a meal, it was a very memorable experience. 

The service was leisurely paced with just the right amount of friendliness. We decided to go all out with this meal so we ordered multiple courses and brought our own wine ($35 corkage fee). I took a pic of the wine menu since it was surprisingly heavy on big California reds. Worth noting since it's a faux pas to bring a bottle of wine that's already on the menu! The menu is heavy on Spanish influenced cuisine, with a focus on cured meats and giant steaks. This is not the place for picky eaters either, I'd classify most of the menu items as not only adventurous, but downright strange. Get out of your comfort zone and try some of the more wacky menu listings! 

The serving styles are pretty inventive too -- the chicken croquetas are served in a fake glass Converse shoe! My favorite menu item of the evening were the cauliflower steak (roasted cauliflower in a very tasty romesco sauce). Yep, delicious! The asparagus were a huge let down and our plate was comprised of mostly the hard, woody stems. Yuck. Nobody likes that part and most of what we were served should've been thrown out. I was also not a fan of the crab and shrimp cocktail and would not order that again. The Chateaubriand was absolutely perfect. It took a while to cook but we were having a blast relaxing in the intimate atmosphere of the place. Since Bazaar Meat specializes in steaks, it goes without saying that the kitchen knows how to cook meat perfectly. We had both medium and medium-rare meat and both were absolutely perfect. 

I loved the dessert menu concept (go for the ""Chef's Sampler"" box of mini desserts). They were almost too pretty to eat and tasted great. My favorite thing? The mini cookies, yum! My $6.00 espresso was more than acceptable and was a great way to round out our dinner.

While I'd love to be able to make dining here a habit, the prices will make it only reserved for special occasions. Ask to see the daily tasting menu options too, but be warned: the prices are EVEN HIGHER THAN THE FRENCH LAUNDRY! Yikes!

If you only order one thing here, make it the Robuchon potatoes. They were like eating mashed potato butter icing! Smooth texture and tons of creamy butter-ness!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,8,6,4,o7sfskrs9_LZtSWUyM1zeA

What we liked most about this Las Vegas version is the style in which meat and steak is prepared and served.  We love small plates, sharing, and steak, so a tapas restaurant that serves large slabs of steak (2.5+lbs) for the table to share is perfect.  Instead of 4 people hovering over their own 16 oz steak, we can get 2 large steaks, cooked to perfection and carved for the table to share, along with 6 variations of potatoes (we loved the crispy straw potatoes), mexican mini corns, brussel sprout leaf, smoked raw oysters, delectable mini samdwiches, and so much more.

I had just returned from Spain on vacation and enjoyed paella, tapas and iberico pork and was looking forward to dining here.  I stayed here at the SLS so it couldn't have been more convenient to dine here. The restaurant is swanky and perfect for a buisness meeting or date out. Once checking in, I was seated immediately at the meat bar - which is equivalent to a sushi bar but had views of hanging iberico pork legs and other cured meats.

To get in the mood, I ordered a glass of red wine from Spain and selected the Lardys Madrid soup that contained a quail egg- soup was yummy. For my main entrée, I selected the the lamb neck served with fried oysters and potatoes. I ordered sides of Catalan spinach and Delmonico potatoes.  Everything was delish except there was so much food I have no room for dessert! My waiter was spot on with service and very polished.

4154559,2015-06-21,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"So I came to this restaurant with high expectations because of chef Jose Andres reputation. The first time I came here the restaurant was just a month old and among the three of us we ordered quite a bit of food to try:

From a selection of appetizers including carpaccio to tartare, cured meats and more plus the entrees of suckling pig, ribeyes and blue fin tuna steaks, califlower steak and more veggies. I think the restaurant is still working out kinks with consistency. For instance in my first visit the classic tartare was good, but on my return visit there was way too much mustard which overpowered the entire dish. 

All of these were underwhelming with the exception of the suckling pig. The steaks were just okay and I would in fact visit many other steakhouses here in Vegas before choosing bazaar for a steak, even if the prices were comparable but bazaar is pretty pricey.

The bluefin tuna steak was a disaster. Quite expensive and literally we spat it out and returned it, it was so bad because it was extremely fishy, and they didn't bother trimming the fat appropriately. It literally ruined our meal because you couldn't get the taste of what seemed to be a rotten, decomposing piece of tuna out of your mouth. I've had lots of great blue fin tuna at many other restaurants , cooked and raw but I would never again order it here.

So after that fiasco I had resigned never to return, but a friend told me that it was worth giving another shot for the pig, thus...

So to the main event: the suckling pig, which is over 100 for just a quarter portion which I think feeds two people, or 500+ for the whole suckling pig. Expensive if you consider Asian roast pig prices.... But.... It was delicious. Deliciously thin and crispy skin with an extremely moist meat. dripping with juices it was the best roasted pork I've ever had. Unfortunately on my recent visits they were simply out. For an item that the menu claims to be the quintessential ""heart and soul"" of bazaar meat, you think they would be adequately prepared at 8pm on a Saturday night.

Come here for the pig and nothing else... If they have it... and you're willing to drop a good chunk of change on said pig.",t8d6cQ2VR7192Iuu6JAw0A,3,0,2,hlRHly83CLmWEuhBBEmmvA

I loved every second and every bite of my experience at Bazaar Meat. We did the tasting menu, which was a complete misnomer. Yes, it's very expensive, but you get SOOO much food. EIGHTEEN courses. Yep, you read that right. And while some of them are small, just two or three bites worth of food per person, there are other courses that are gigantic. The ribeye course for two people? It's an entire 16 oz. ribeye steak! Oh, and that 18 courses doesn't include dessert. When it comes time for that, you are so full, and they anticipate this, that they bring you a to-go box full of pastries, cakes, and candies. Seriously, SO. MUCH. FOOD.

The really great thing about the tasting menu, though, is that you're not limited to what's on the menu. You can substitute anything from the main menu onto the tasting menu, and no, this isn't limited to substituting one vegetable for another. If you want, you can substitute a course of beef cheek for the brussels sprouts. They will do whatever you want, and at the price you're paying, I'm quite glad that they do. Our waiter was quite eager to customize the menu to our tastes, and he happily offered suggestions on what he thought should be eliminated and what should be substituted.

Ok, but now on to the specifics. This may sound weird for a place that has ""meat"" in its name, but the gazpacho is incredible. Perhaps it's just a refreshing break from all of the meat courses, but it was really, really good. All of the tartares and carpaccios are delicious as well. And I loved the cotton candy mojito. They pour the alcohol table side over the cotton candy to dissolve it into the drink. It's cool to watch, and it's one of the best-tasting mojitos I've ever had too.

This place isn't easy on the wallet, at least not for most of us. But it was an incredible dining experience, and if you can afford it (or if you win big at the casino), definitely stop in. It will be well worth it.",FqP8OzovhA_GeMBBfL1Ksw,4,2,5,Pt2eshnKu4SaLYmpcRFdMg

The slices of various meat combination plate for about $70 was totally not worth it. There was only one meat that was good, the rest tasted like dry salami or sausage.

(Timing-wise, on a Wednesday night, it wasn't busy at all. Not sure if how busy it is during the weekends so do make a RSVP ahead of time.)
(Note 2: This is in the SLS Hotel as a heads-up near the back on the left-hand side.)

+The food itself is a bit all over the place so will be listing some things here and there. Note that the presentation here (like other Bazaars) can be a bit love-it-or-hate-it for some so make sure to be aware to be somewhat open-minded! Some of the best things here include Bazaar staples that you'll find at other restaurants like the croquetas (still good; still weird coming in the shoe), the rib eye (super delicious/well-cooked; comes by the pound), the lamb rack (also delicious; not super gamey), and the Don't Be A Lemon frozen cocktail drink (they make it for you table-side; super funky and need to drink it slow because of the liquid nitrogen but personally, thought it was delicious). 

(By the way, some things require ordering way in advance like the suckling pig which people always seem to recommend.) 
+Service was terrific from all sides. Lots of attention pouring water, great explanations about the food, and a sommelier are all on hand. 
+Love the look of the place. Different kitchens to view all types of meat/cooking going on. You get to view most of the meat you're going to eat and the giant furnace they cook it on. 

+/- I get that it's part of the 'show' but the menus...personally not a big fan of the gigantic slabs. But I digress. 
+/- Also part of the experience is the wait time. The meat takes a while to cook so they recommend you go backwards from choosing the 'meat' you want to order to the smaller dishes. Just a heads-up. 
+/- Food that was a bit in the middle for me included the brussel sprouts (had a unique addition of 'lemon air' that didn't jive completely on my end)

This wasn't dinner; it was an experience and it ranked in the top 5 meals I've ever enjoyed, right along side the José Andrés spot in Atlantic City. Both visits to these iconic high-quality establishments have taken places during bachelor parties (first my Best Man's and most recently - mine) and we couldn't have asked for better service, more options, or different company to share with us.

We started with cocktails and some appetizers; the Smoked Aladdin Manhattan (consisting of buffalo trace bourbon, sweet vermouth, lemon aromatic, orange bitters) was perfectly mixed and then followed by a caviar flight, tomato bread, steak tar tare (mixed right in front of us), and Iberico Jamon (for those unitiatiated this is ham from pigs who were locked in a cave with only acorns to eat for three years - not sure why it tastes so good but it's otherworldy).

After we worked our way through the appetizers it was on to the main courses - a suckling pig and then the waygu steak and sides. The pig came out first, followed by the steak and sides about 10 minutes later which originally frustrated us until we learned it was done that way so the table is able to enjoy the selections in an order the chef decides. Similar to the rest of the review (and to avoid being overly repetitive) the entrees and sides were world-class and incredibly delicious - the perfect amount not to feel stuffed but plenty for the entire table to share.

We closed the evening with some tiny reduction-made desert treats from all over the world, followed by an amazing tour of the entire restaurant by the General Manager Mr. Pano Argyriades.

There was some fabulous steak tartare, too!  We ordered a bottle of Faustino red wine to have with the rest of our meal and it was very good.  

The iberico jamon gets a paragraph of its own... no words can describe how good this was.  I died and went to heaven, plain and simple.  

The tomato tartare was wonderful - came with lettuce leaves for wrapping and it was a nice counterpoint to the meats.  The main meal included a lovely roasted cauliflower, asparagus with a piquant tomato sauce, those buttery potatoes and a Rosewood TX rib-eye steak.  The steak had a lovely salt crust, smokey flavor and was cooked to  perfection.  

The dessert selection that came at the very end was just right after such a large and wonderful meal.  I would do this again in a heartbeat!  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!  Thank you Jose Andreas!",AxHZcc1D3HGbrI7DgyRPuQ,0,0,5,1LeAWsTaxCPLfUNBcl_eeg
4329962,2015-09-14,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"The SLS is way far down the strip, and it was surprisingly quiet in here on a Saturday night during a fight weekend.  When you walk in, you see lots of large cuts of meat, open kitchens, and their open grill.  

We were seated in the back in a larger booth, and large tables are necessary for all the dishes you get since most things are meant to be done family style.  Our server was Chris, who our friends had recommended from a great experience the week prior. He was energetic and knew the menu well and was able to guide us through ordering.

There are 5 different kitchens, so depending on what you're eating, different things come out at different times, but they paced and coursed our things out pretty well. 

Drinks:
1. Cotton candy mojito: we had seen a commercial in the cab about a free cocktail for mentioning the commercial. The promotion had ended last month, but they were nice enough to bring each person a cocktail. I was skeptical since I don't love the cotton candy flavor (like with ice creams), but they poured the mojito over a bit of spun sugar so that it wilted down, and the drink was very well balanced and not overly sweet at all. I actually liked this a lot
2. Compadre: I love rye, apple, and lemon, so this was perfect
3. LN2 cocktail: this cocktail is made tableside and is pretty cool because the LN2 turns it into a lemon based sorbet with a shot of rum in it. It's a nice palate cleanser and is also a good way to start the meal 

Food: 
1. Cotton candy foie gras: a small cube of foie gras on a stick with cotton candy spun around it - not exactly what I  expected, but if you don't eat everything in one bite, then it's basically just cotton candy and a cube of foie
2. Chicharron: this is an impressive presentation with a huge stretched out piece, and it comes with a zataar spiced yogurt dipping sauce. It doesn't actually just melt in your mouth and has a good texture. The best part is breaking it apart with the mallet they bring you 
3. Simple tomato salad: refreshing, light 
4. Sloppy joe: on a brioche bun like the kind for a lobster roll. It was topped with fried shoestring potatoes, and the sloppy joe (beef bolognese) actually had really good flavor
5. Air bread: instead of the reuben, they were able to do the wagyu one with parmesan cream for us. I loved the philly cheese steak one in LA, and I don't love thousand island, so I liked this one a lot. The parmesan cream was a bit overwhelming, though
6. Beef consomme: disappointing. The presentation was nice with a quail egg and caviar at the bottom of a tea cup, then the consomme poured on top, but the consomme itself was not hot and was under salted
7. Tortilla sacromonte: barely cooked egg (wonderful texture) and offal; I'm not a huge fan of kidney, but the sweetbreads and crispy bone marrow were ok in small amounts
8. Classic tartare: sirloin, savora mustard, egg yolk, anchovy, and parker house rolls. I thought the two tartares were some of the best things we had. The flavor was wonderful, and it was a pretty big portion 
9. Salmon tartare: salmon, ikura, yuzu, soy sauce, avocado, wasabi, and seaweed crackers. This wasn't too Asian in flavor, and it was a great combination of textures (with the roe) and flavors. 
10. Setas: whole mushroom caps with good garlic flavor, but lots of oil
11. Robuchon potatoes: buttery, silky, smooth - pretty on point 
12. Leeks: not too oily, good flavor with the balsamic reduction
13. Wagyu beef cheeks: tender, but not amazing in flavor
14. Suckling pig: we did a quarter ($140). It was actually really fatty, so the mixed salad to go with it was nice.  The flavor was good, but this was too heavy for me
15. Rosewood ribeye: they recommended a little under 3 lbs for 6 of us, and it was cooked well.  It was good in flavor but really rich, so I could only eat so much.

I actually thought the tartares were the highlights. We were way stuffed at the end, and though the dessert options looked appealing, only a few people got some small bites. 

Overall, I would say it was one of the better Vegas food experiences, but don't come here if you're a vegetarian.

Our friends were also obsessed with the Jose Andres potato chips, abc the manager was nice enough to bring some by on the house for us to take back to them!",gfyW0vuJls8ARoHmogfcmw,5,4,4,IXiLIZeUbWGNmb6mGcXFNA

Unfortunately our main course was a disappointment.

We ordered a 2.5 lb ribeye and it literally had no taste. When you spend ~$50/lb for your steak, you have to expect exceptional taste, so needless to say we were disappointed.

It's not a fine peace of beef. We each paid $275 for the pre-set menu. Service was poorly timed ,waiters friendly but lacking training.

I'm a Vegas local and finally tried Bazaar Meat last week. First the good:

- The ambiance and multiple open kitchens is great.
- Our waiter was out of this world. 
- The sommelier and wine choices were fantastic.
- The food for the most part was over the top good. Notably:
- Cotton candy foie gras - One of the most creative things I've had in a long time. Keep in mind these are one per order.
- Kobe beef sandwiches - too hard to describe as a sandwich these are single bites of heaven. Again, one per order
- Sushi - Amazing presentation and just plain good
- Chef's selection of cured meats - FAB
- Suckling pig - sticker shock starts here, but this is the only restaurant in the U.S. that can serve this and it is WELL worth it. A little surprise is that it is served with a very good salad.
- Robuchon whipped potatoes - would you like some potatoes with your butter? Just indulge. Worth it!
- Dessert - I won't steal the surprise, but its delightful.

Now to the not so impressive:

- The menus are just too over-the-top. Huge plastic monstrosities that are difficult to hold and just plain awkward. They were obviously trying to make a statement with these, but they are a huge fail.

- The menu is convoluted and confusing. Study before you go or choose one of the pre fixe menu offerings.

- We spent a lot of money on the Mindful Meats beef rib steak and it was NOT cooked. I actually like rare steak but we ordered it medium to please everyone at the table. It came out BLUE. If you don't know what I mean by blue meat, look it up. When we brought it to the waiter's attention, he agreed, but did nothing. This was the biggest fail of the evening.

Overall a great experience, but they've got to get the details down.",Kpgc6qNkjpEfgQ9-zYWQsg,1,0,4,C99vEkvZW0gvFg3GFLijog
4361053,2018-06-25,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We had dinner here for the first time yesterday.   We are local but had friends in visiting and we were all excited to try this restaurant based on the great reviews.   
I will say my first impression walking into the restaurant was a good one. The decor is very interesting and inviting.  The hostess was very pleasant.  We arrived a bit early so we were directed to the bar to wait for our table.   The cocktail menu was very unique and my choice was  the Smokey Manhattan that was delicious.  
Shortly after arriving we were seated.  From that point on I was very disappointed.   The menu is so limiting.  All the steak sizes are huge and there are really no other choices. We all wanted steak however we didn't all want the same cut or to have it prepared the same way.  This was not a option.  The way they do it is large and medium rare we were told by the waitress.   My friend likes her steak well done and the only way they would accommodate her was for us to order a large steak, have them serve it to the table.  All of us were then suppose to take what we wanted and then they returned her portion to the kitchen to be cooked for a additional time.   Her part came back 15 minutes later.  Not a great way to enjoy dinner with friends.   Although the steak did have a good flavor it was tough and not a great piece of meat.  Especially not for the price!   
For me I would have  to say it was the worst dining experience I have every had.  I guess maybe if you have a large group, all of you want the same meat, cooked the same way it would be a passable steak house but there are certainly many better options.",njwCZv1agCyzckIbKlqVfw,0,0,1,UJzCwJbhf8b-3q5UrxAotw

4371258,2017-03-17,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"This is one of the foodie's destinations in Vegas. I went with a very high expectations and came out surprised and delighted. Jose Andres has done a very good in blending fine Spanish cooking into the American steakhouse. 

My two friends and I ordered a lot more food than we should but were able to finish everything because it's delicious. We tried the Vaca Vieja rib-eye tasting, a small 6oz portion from a rather aged dairy cow, which rather firm but very flavorful. The texture allowed the taste to be savored for a longer time. Chateaubriand Tenderloin is also very nice and suits my companion's preference. 

The highlight of the night was the Secreto iberico de Bellota, which is a fine pork from Spain. It's unusual to have ordered pork at a steakhouse but this little piggy has definitely stolen the shoe. With a wonderful balance of texture and taste, every bite is pure joy. There is a certain degree of fat in the chop. The lard sparks inside my mouth, leaving only taste, flavor, but not grease. Given this delightful surprise, I had an extra order of the cured meat version of the same pork - the Jamon Iberico de Bellota. It's very rich in flavor, extremely tasty, and pairs very well with a Sparkling Rose that Joseph recommended, . The ham tasted the same as the same kind that I had tried earlier while traveling in Europe. Though it's not a surprise anymore, it doesn't disappoint.

My server of the night was Joseph M (Joe), who is kind, friendly, and has excellent knowledge on the food and wine. He has taken every possible step to ensure a great dinner for me, and his attentive service has definitely elevated my experience. 

This is a one of a kind dining experience, especially for foodies. With this, I will not fancy any other place in Vegas.",OZ9dQnmzwxQsucfP_PKjuA,1,0,5,lzF1kTIXwZoO9l6neVTfUg

4382817,2016-08-22,18,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"One of the best date nights my husband and I have had in a long time. Everything about our experience at Bazaar Meat was perfection. No question it was a five star experience.

We made reservations for 7:00 on a Friday night and that seemed to be on the early side for the rest of the diners. The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived, but became more lively as we enjoyed our meal.

The timing and the show of all of the courses was what made this such a spectacular date night spot. Most of the tables had booths so couples could sit together for a cozy meal. My husband and I don't normally sit on the same side, but literally every table was doing it so he caved. Every item brought to us was a show, from the drinks to the appetizers to the meats. The staff did a great job of making the arrival of each dish and drink interesting. 

Both of our drinks were spot on. It was one of those times where the cost of the drink was justified in the taste. I had a smoky Bourbon drink that was amazing. It was heavy on the smoky flavor and was strong enough to satisfy my Bourbon craving. The aroma was amazing too. My husband had a Mojito that was also delicious and prepared in a fun way table side. 

The food! Wow! Everything was amazing with fun presentations to match.
Cotton Candy Foie Gras- it's meant to be enjoyed as one bite, loved the texture of the foie gras and the sweetness of the cotton candy
Pork Skin Chicharron- huge portion that is hammered into smaller pieces table side, deliciously salty
Gazpacho Shots- loved the spicy flavor and all of the flavors in general
Croquetas de Pollo- yummy, but not the best item on the menu
Butifarra Spiral Sausage- my husband and I both thought this was one of, if not the best sausages we'd ever had. The bread and honey aioli served with this were tasty. Loved that they sliced this at the table.
Skirt Steak- yum! Tender, well seasoned, and loved the mustard served on the plate
Robuchon Potatoes- this packed all the butter that the menu promised, so deliciously rich
Setas al Ajillo- even a mushroom hater would love these, loved the crust and the flavor
Desserts- six different desserts that were all delicious and amounted to a very generous portion. The jelly with the edible wrapper was tasty and unique. My favorite items were the raspberry tart and cream puff.

The service was attentive, but not obtrusive. Our waiter and his assistant checked in constantly and efficiently cleared away finished plates. They really added to the experience in the way they presented all of the dishes. The menu is extensive and our waiter was well versed in every detail. He spent a nice amount of time explaining everything to us, but not in a pushy manner. 

I left stunned that this restaurant isn't talked about more. I've been missing out and will definitely be back again. The dishes are so unique that I could see returning and having a fresh experience each time.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,38,33,5,tIpj2kbuiKsmskr3roovaQ
4387197,2017-10-07,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Had a great experience here last night celebrating my cousin's bachelorette. Wanted to say kudos to the folks working here for being incredibly customer service oriented and genuinely nice. 

Often times when you step into an expensive restaurant you feel uncomfortable because the people working there are professional but not warm. Sometimes they even make you feel bad if you don't seem like a high roller or are not a culinary connoisseur.

This was the total opposite. Bazaar Meat combines eclectic class, delicious food, and top notch customer service. Everyone we spoke to was beyond nice and approachable. Our waiter spontaneously volunteered to give us a mini tour and explanation of meats at the counter. He was totally cool with us not doing the prefix and was genuinely helpful in helping us choose the right portions/orders for our table. The chef sent us a complimentary and super delicious tartar when we were waiting for our meat and super hungry. When an incident occurred where a server accidentally spilled some meat sauce on my cousin's dress the entire staff immediately stepped up to the plate. Everyone apologized profusely and the manager came over and gave my cousin his personal card/number and said he would take care of dry cleaning for her and do the pickup door to door. After a really satisfying and filling meal (glad we trusted our waiter on the portions), they brought around a complimentary desserts cart and told us to get whatever we wanted. I thought I misheard at first. It was like being a kid at a candy shop. Our desserts server was incredibly patient when we were overwhelmed by the options and she was happy to reexplain what they were and added even more desserts than we asked for (I think she sensed we were being conservative out of politeness). When we left to go and had our remaining desserts boxed - it came back with even more! When the check came they removed the 25% service fee because of the incident. 

I can't say enough good things about the team working there. The food was really good and probably what most people write about but I think it's the entire experience that makes the meal especially when it is a special occasion. Thanks again Bazaar Meat for making this a wonderful experience. 

If you are in Vegas, it's totally worth a trip past the hustle and bustle to the end of the strip!",nX3Wd8NkUDoEMCpxfO54rg,1,0,5,uSLyO9P79WCtMLU9IZt5Ow

The service was outstanding. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy. I think you could walk in easily on a Friday night, but it's better to play it safe with a reservation.

Items I can do without next time:
The Bagels & Lox Cone doesn't do anything for me. I've never been a fan of salmon roe.
The Chicharrón was pretty interesting and a nice way to munch on something while waiting for your food. 

On the cusp:
The Rib Eye and Tenderloin were fantastic. Probably the best renditions I've ever had, although I'm not much of a steak guy. All my friends were gushing over them. It's the kind of meat that makes everyone at the table go silent on first bite.

I must have again:
Croquetas de pollo - it's basically the best croquette you'd ever have in your many lifetimes. 
Beef & Parmesan Grissini - Meat on a cracker stick! Yes! I'd 10 of these in one sitting and be quite happy.

In the end, I ate too much food and suffered massive food coma. So this is not a place you want to go to right before hitting a club or bar for some drinks if you eat like I do.

4402138,2017-05-09,6,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Bazaar Meat is not a conventional steakhouse by whatever standards one would hold a steakhouse to in our culture. Bazaar Meat combines an irreverent menu built on self-referentiality with reactionary notions like massive slabs of beef and pork, family-style shared entrées, and old-school wood-fire meat roasts. Yet it has an ego large enough to unapologetically sell prix fixe tasting menus and $350 caviar flights. It also has a bit of an identity problem, which I'll address later.

Whatever it is, Bazaar Meat is now one of my favorite steak houses in North America, and can be mentioned in the same breath as my previous top 5: Moishes in Montréal, Cut in L.A., Bern's in Tampa, Luger's in NY, and La Boca in New Orleans. It may take another visit or two, but Bazaar Meat could very well end up at the top of my list.

On my maiden visit, I did the ""Jose's Way"" Tasting ($185), which consisted of:

- Cotton Candy Foie Gras: Crispy amaranth
- Ferran Adrià Olives, Modern & Traditional: Liquid green olive, gordal olive stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy
- Bagel & Lox Cone: With dill cream cheese, salmon roe
- Smoke & Ice Fresh Oyster: Applewood-smoked oyster, apple mignonette
- The Classic Tartare: Beef sirloin, savora mustard, egg yolk, HP sauce, anchovy on a Parker House roll
- Chef's Selection of Cured Meats: Ajo Verde Sausage, Wild Boar Sausage, Mole Oaxaca, Jamón ibérico
- ""Beefsteak"" Tomato: Tomato confit, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, cucumber, black olive, romaine leaves
- Rosewood Texas Rib Eye Wagyu/Black Angus: Spanish-style bone-in rib eye, oak-wood fired
- Cauliflower Steak: Pine nuts, preserved lemon
- Robuchon Potatoes: Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes
- Grilled Asparagus: Romesco sauce
- Dessert Cart: Cream puffs, assorted tarts (e.g. Raspberry Yuzu Tart, Pecan Pie Puff, Coconut Cookie Similar to a Girl Scout Samoa, etc.)

I enjoyed all of it, and especially loved the cured meats, which consisted of some of the best charcuterie you'll eat, the rich and cocoa-tinged Mole Oaxaca being my favorite. The foie gras covered in cotton candy was surprising, but interesting in the best of ways. The tartare was fantastic, and probably sweeter than you will expect it to be.

The highlight, of course, was the 10 ounce Rib Eye, which did not disappoint. The meat comes from Rosewood Ranches, an upper-echelon provider of responsibly-raised American Wagyu that delivers great marbling at a fraction of the cost of Japanese Wagyu. Hitting the tongue, the steak tastes as fragrantly oak-grilled as the fantastic aroma emanating from it, and then releases copious amounts of big, juicy beef flavor upon being chewed.

I was pleased with Bazaar Meat's tributes to other chefs: the quivering liquid olive a la Adrià was interesting and well-executed by his understudy. I had Pommes Robuchon two nights earlier at Joël Robuchon in the MGM, and can confirm that Bazaar Meat's version is identical. The ""Beefsteak"" Tomato is virtually the same as Thomas Keller's tomato tartare, which I've had several times before, though buried under frisée.

My only regret was not adding some Kobe Ribeye ($50/ounce) to my meal, as Bazaar Meat is one of only 9 restaurants in the U.S. that are authorized to prepare it. Next time, next time.

There are way too many negative Yelp reviews for this place, mostly from geniuses who booked a reservation at a steak house only to order chicken and then complain about the lack of flavor. To Yelp readers: Ignore reviews from anyone who orders chicken as a general rule. To restaurant management: Why even have chicken on your menu? Seriously, you're never going to please those people anyway at your price point.

I think therein lies the biggest challenge for this restaurant: does Bazaar Meat want to be a steakhouse, accessible to diners of all types? Or does it aspire to be something more evolutionary, funky, and forward-thinking? Currently, it is a little of everything -- a steakhouse, a high-end charcuterie room, a tapas bar, an avant-garde ""greatest hits"" menu of sides and appetizers made famous by other chefs (Adrià, Robuchon, Keller, etc.), and a suckling pig roast luau.

I love Bazaar Meat for what it is currently, but for this restaurant to thrive long-term at the northern end of the Las Vegas strip, it will need to narrow its focus and cater to a more specific dining audience.

4424866,2015-04-22,8,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I confess I do not normally eat rare meat and my steak is usually well-done, but I am newly transformed after my visit to Bazaar Meat. I once scoffed at raw beef, but the preparation of the raw beef menu items here have me up late drafting this review and salivating as I think of the wonderful tartare and carpaccio at BM. But oh the COTTON CANDY FOIE GRAS is to die for!

The dining area is an upscale feel and if you're a little chilly, take a walk over to the blazing hot open coal fire grill in the middle of the room that miraculously doesn't invade the area with smoke or that commoner BBQ smell. This is a special place where aged meats are majestically displayed and the culinary vision of Josè Andrès comes to life and appreciated. I must give special recognition to the fine dining staff for their attentive service and especially our server, Elias.

I pray that the struggling SLS will somehow find success and keep restaurants like Bazaar Meat around for a long time.

Classic Tartare - Prepared table side and served in a large marble bowl. This was a great way to begin our meat journey. Delicate minced beef bursting with flavor and served with warm, slightly sweet Parker rolls.

Croquetas de Pollo - Strangely served inside a plastic sneaker. Chicken Bechamel fritters were outstanding. The creamy burst with a crispy coating is something not to miss.

Oysters - Fresh, meaty and served with 3 different toppings. My favorite was the passion fruit something. Taste of the sea in an elegant dining booth.

Beef & Parmesan Grissini - I wish I had about a dozen of these to eat right now. The thinly sliced perfect washugyu beef wrapped around a seasoned breadstick and served with a Parmesan foam. Just get these!

Cotton Candy Foie Gras - What!? Truly an orgasm in your mouth. Just pop the whole thing in your mouth and close your eyes for the most luxurious experience. As the cotton candy melts and reveals the previous center of buttery foie gras that is also flecked with crunchy sweet bits, your mouth has only seconds to savor this fleeting delight. I would like another dozen of these.

Giant Pork Skin Chicharron - It starts with the largest piece of Chicharron that gets broken up at the table. Not as flavorful as the rest of the items, but nice for show.

Holstein Ribeye - Enough for 4 to share and takes about an hour to cook, which let us enjoy the little bites along the way. This meat was good and cooked medium rare. I like a little more flavor in my steaks but perhaps most carnivores prefer the bare taste of real grass fed meat.

Robuchon Potatoes - A must!! I like a little potato whipped into my rich and decadent butter and cream...at least that's what it tasted like. So airy and light, you won't feel your cholesterol levels hitting the ceiling.

Piquillo Peppers confit - A wonderful accompaniment to the meat.

Grilled Asparagus in Romesco sauce - Lightly grilled asparagus on top of the nut and red pepper sauce. Another nice accompaniment.

Dessert - a box of assorted chocolates and treats to enjoy and later take home.

A primal yet sophisticated journey into the world of meats that satiates both your visual and gastric faculties.
Thank you Josè Andrès.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,15,16,5,oBZkeuRXy_k3pqe6JXUwhQ

4433814,2015-11-13,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"A five-star review for a five-star restaurant. I came expecting innovative cuisine and we found a clever mixture of invention and classics.

We started with the cotton candy foie gras, a lollypop-sized delight on a stick that we were instructed to eat in one bite. It was a surprising interplay of textures and temperatures, the warmth of the dissolving sugar against the creamy coolness of the foie gras. It set the expectation levels high for the meal.

Next up was the chicharron, delivered in a huge piece, dusted with za'atar, and broken up into smaller chunks. It was so fresh that it continued to snap, crackle and pop throughout the rest of the dinner. Delicious.

We had to get the olives ala Ferran Adria, beautifully executed and exciting. And this was something I appreciated: Andres borrowed techniques from other chefs...and then gave them credit for coming up with the dish. It's something I don't remember seeing in the past and it was a respectful move.

We also enjoyed the ""traditional"" steak tartare -- not crafted at the table but presented in a bowl alongside a tray of mini brioche buns topped with sea salt. My sweetie, who is not a fan of tartare, pronounced it was the ""best he's ever had.""

We chose the beef rib-eye from Mindful Meats in California, primarily because we've driven by the farm several times and wanted to try aged meat from a ""local"" ranch. I like my beef rare and was able to find many quite rare pieces in our ""medium rare"" grilled steak, carved and presented alongside the bone. We asked for salt and the coarse flakes were an excellent addition.

The price for the meats is by the ounce, so in addition to choosing your protein and its source, you also need to have an idea of how many ounces you'd like for your steak...and your waitress/waiter will need to check and see if a steak that size is available.

We also chose the mashed potatoes (ala Joel Rubuchon) that were just loaded with delicious butter and the roasted carrots served on a bed of yogurt sauce.

The wine list is interesting and (very!) expensive -- some of the wines were priced at 10 times more than what they are priced at retail. That said, we had a lovely bottle of pinot noir for under $100, one of the few available at that price point. But then, if you're spending all that money on the food, I guess they figure a few more dollars won't hurt. 

The room fits the modern and sleek atmosphere of the SLS and the staff was attentive and professional. And be sure to go up and check out the delicious cuts of beef, dry aging in a case by the kitchen. Now that's a decoration I can get behind!",YqrWnGNOK6X0o5VsTh_nbQ,3,1,5,jETDePuaVK_ja8bgAm2cBw
4437410,2014-08-27,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"First, let me be clear.  We did not officially eat at the restaurant.  Instead we sat at the bar and ordered the various appetizers.   Some were amazing, others I could have done without.   So here is a break down.   The cotton candy foie gras was strange.  The idea was better than the execution.   However, it was a unique taste.   The sloppy Joe was also a bit of a miss.   It is basically meat on an open toasted bread.   It was just okay.   Not great, you can skip it.  A MUST SKIP is the shoe fries. Salty, salty, salty, salty.   We sent them back and they did a new order which were equally as salty, salty, salty.  AVOID the shoe fries unless you like salt.  Now, moving to the MUST TRY.  The baby corn was amazing.  Small baby corn each covered in mayo and chilly.  I thought it could use more spice, but it was great.   The ensalada Lucia is also a must try.   Little bite size Caesar salads.   Each bite is delicious.  Another must try is the suckling pig sandwich (open food, not on the bar menu: but ask for it).   The roast pig is perfect on the bread with a dash of mint.   It is an amazing sandwich and ten times better than the sloppy Joe.  Ask for the pig, not the slop.  Now, if you want to try something different.   It is sweet, salty, and buttery all at the same time its the foiffle waffle.   It is an expensive little desert-like dish.   The mix of salt and sugar is interesting.   It is an acquired taste and thus would leave it as a must try for those who like to experiment different flavors all at once.   Over all, I would have given them 5 stars, but the sloppy Joe and the shoe string fries lowers the rating to a 4.   Great atmosphere and will go back and try the restaurant in the near future.",dXIO-WFQJ8pwQ5M2STewZA,3,2,4,3MGcIl85E1sZzlt1kqwW-Q

had to get seats at table in bar area

decided against my better judgement to give the cotton candy foie gras and foieffle a second try....should have stuck with my gut feeling, they weren't any better this time around....I do appreciate sweet and savory, but think foie needs to be seared to truly bring out the best in it. Same with the foieffle, a bit on the salty side, may be better made with unsalted peanut butter?

We had the ribeye again, and were not disappointed, they do know how to prepare a great steak, I have to give them that!
of course we had to order the Robuchon potatoes, can't pass up the butter!
tried the brussell sprouts, which were good, but lemon foam a bit strong

would suggest ordering dessert al la carte, as we picked the 10 piece? selection, which they put together for us
again, steak is their forte, so the sweets seemed to be an afterthought

all in all, this is not a bad place, probably needs a bit more time to refine the menu
if you live in vegas, would probably say their are a number of better choices for a steakhouse off strip. this one is worth a try though.....",XnI-AHs6Sf323o913vXObg,1,0,3,2ESLksFXROIZNbkgoMAq3A

Please be warned that you need an extremely long time blocked out to eat here if you plan on eating a steak.  We were here for dinner for over three hours!  It wasn't the fact that meal took so long but there was an extremely long lull in between some of our small plates and the larger entrees.  So long that it felt awkward!

The food overall was good but not great and I recommend eating at one of the many delicious establishments in Las Vegas.  

However, one redeeming quality of Bazaar Meat was the service.  Our service was amazing and charismatic.  He deserves every dollar of that $300+ tip that he received.

The steaks were good but not great (the entire table agreed that Del Frisco was better for steaks).  However, someone at our table did get the rack of lamb and it was probably one of the best rack of lambs that I""ve ever tasted.

4530014,2015-11-14,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Experience:  A friend told me about a summer tasting menu they were offering for only $65, and I knew this was my chance to not only taste many things on the menu, but actually afford it. We made a reservation for a Thursday night at 7pm.

Facility:  Located inside SLS, it was very beautiful with an upscale feel, but in typical Vegas style, you see people show up in jeans and super casual clothes. I guess they just don't want to turn away tourists. LOL! 

Service:  the service was good, but not the best I ever had. This was a 10 course meal that there were periods of lull with no food, then only 1-2 minutes between courses, almost serving them on top of each other. The waiters were nice enough, but I had to flag down for refills on water and drinks. 

Food:  This tasting menu was a lot of fun. It started out with pork skins that were delicious.  They were fairly light and thin for pork skins. Seems they were seasoned with just the right amount of salt and pepper. These were a big hit with the whole table.  
Next we had a two way olive entree...one way stuffed with anchovies and served in a ""anchovy"" tin....and the other was a faux olive that was on a spoon. It held the shape of an olive, but once you bit into it, it was almost liquified and had the essence of olive. Bazaar, but unique. LOL! Anyway, neither of these were my fav, but still neat to try. 
They served a row and caviar cone next. It was pretty good. The cone was crisp and filled with a cream cheese type filling which was perfect to balance the salty sea flavor of the fish. 
The croquettes were round and crispy outside with a creamy mixture inside. They were decent. We had a young girl with our group who really liked these, as they were pretty ""normal"" for her palate. 
The beef carpaccio on a breadstick was my favorite. The beef was delicious and tender and melted in my mouth. Meat is something they definitely do well here. 
The asparagus, potatoes and main meat course we're all good. The mashed potatoes were made with half potato and half butter...who wouldn't love that!  The meat was so good, but of course by this time I'm getting pretty full. LOL! 
They served these strange potatoes that looked like zepplolis...a rectangle shape, but the strange part is they were fried crisp and completely hollow in the middle. So it was almost like a potato chip

Oh my...won't be finishing the details on the food. Waited too long to finish, and now I forgot some of it. LOL!

Overall:  I'm so glad they had this tasting menu special. It makes the menu on a very expensive place more affordable to the broke folks. It was very tasty too!!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,1,1,4,qKfKyNSR-vSL2k9zA_5Zug

4535398,2015-07-05,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"In Vegas for a long weekend to relax/enjoy with the wifey.  I'm always a little tardy with my reviews if I write at all, but thought lets get this one published soon given the culinary adventure we just experienced.

Decided to visit Vegas mainly for two reasons, continue our track of best hotels in the world (Mandarin Oriental) and two, try some of the best chef's in the world restaurants.

I actually had not heard about this place until recently and almost didn't book since my wife is not a red meat eater.  I'm so glad I did.  The restaurant is in the remodeled Sahara which is the old part of the strip.  The restaurant is on the first floor in the back and is large and decorated in an expensive lodge motif, earthy and woody.  The kitchen is long and open and you can see, smell and fell the heat of the spit pits and grills.

We arrived early for our 7:30 pm reservation and were seated promptly.  Good table, not great as it appeared they filed the restaurant from front to back - I guess to give the look it was full.  When we left at 9:30 pm the dining room was maybe a little more than half full.

Now for the food.  The tasting menus are for 2 or more and have mostly beef so I couldn't try since my wife doesn't eat red meat.  Bitter green salad with a lemon vinegar dressing was outstanding, the grilled oysters were fresh but lacked any real grilled flavor so this was the only shortfall of the meal.  Their spin on Caesar Salad was ridiculously good.  My wife is a very picky eater and cooks crazy food at home so when she says this was the best salmon or fish dish ever it means something.  Salmon cooked in parchment with olives, raisins, onions and sage was sublime.  My meat was the veal chop and it was outstanding too. The cauliflower steak was the best I've had and this is one of my favorite veggies so we have often.  The last side were mashed potatoes, yes I said mashed potatoes.  This ain't you mama's recipe.  Silky, smooth and you can taste the potato with butter butter butter, crazy good.

Let's summarize, location not the best but great restaurant ambience, service was excellent and what you expect anytime you drop more than $100 per person, ultra expensive but go the tasting menu route if possible, good wine list but always hard for me to give kudos on wine because markup is so high, top notch food and in our top 10 all-time. Only 4 stars as the tasty menus should have at least a fish or chicken option and none of the food comes out together.  While this is explained, I still like a traditional dining experience.",_2d0MXa2qntBOn7Rb6i5fA,0,0,4,gjJ3aV2FgfNn4oJBryFa0Q
4538471,2015-07-24,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I have wanted to dine at Bazaar Meat since before SLS opened! Well, Hubby and I were celebrating our 8 year anniversary and I decided it was time to take the plunge. We easily valeted at SLS and made our way to the players club to redeem a $30 dining credit for my birthday. 

We were a tad late for our reservation, but I had called to confirm we were still coming. After being greeted by the hostess and who I presume was a manager we waited a few moments then we're told to follow the hostess. Right before walking off the gentleman, who I think was a manager, whispered something to the hostess about our table facing something. We were led through the dining room and past all the kitchens. Our table was a half booth/half table facing the closed, empty side of the dining room, to be fair had we chose to sit in the chairs instead of the comfy booths we would have faced the action. 

Our server greeted us soon after sitting down, he went over the menu with us and let us know what the specials were. It took my husband and I a little while to figure out our plan of attack. We decided to pick a few starters-
Passion Up cocktail
LN2 Don't Be A Lemon!
Cotton Candy Foie Gras
Rueben
THE Foieffle

We wanted to try multiple things vs. ordering one large Ribeye so we decided on-
Merino Rack Of Lamb
Chauteaubriand 
Street Corn
Delmonico Potatoes
Setas al Aljillo

 I ordered the Passion Up and it was AMAZING, I could have taken a bath in that passion fruit foam! The drink itself was a great balance of tart, sweet, and strong. The LN2 is meant as a palate cleanser, it's prepared table side using lots of liquid nitrogen. I loved the texture of it, ""the best sorbet I've ever tasted"" were the words I said. I used it as a pallette cleanser through the whole meal. 

Onto food! I wish I had an endless supply of all 3 starters we chose. They were that phenomenal!!! The Cotton Candy was a great balance of salty/savory. We tried the Rueben next, the salty swiss was a perfect balance for the sauerkraut. Finally THE Foieffle. This crispy Belgian style waffle was full of this peanut butter foie mixture that I could have eatin forever. 

Our lamb arrived first, prepared perfectly medium as asked, followed by the potatoes. Perfect pace to take pictures. As I started serving the lamb the rest of our order followed. Perfect timing. Every morsel I put in my mouth was amazing. I highly recommend just ordering exactly what we ordered. Maybe throw in the Iberico Ham, it's the only item I regret not ordering. After we finished my husband asked me my favorite, the lamb stoke the show for me. And THE Foieffle. But really I would order every single item over again. 

Now to service. Somewhere between bite checking and when we fished eating, our server disappeared. I had bottled sparkling water but my husband had iced water. We sat finished for a little bit before an assistant offered to clear plates, we asked him for water. We sat a little while longer before I noticed a different server peek around to our out of the way booth. He brought over dessert menus. Then a dessert platter of an array of petite fours. We decided on the 10 piece chef selection of desserts. When our box arrived it was beautiful, but only contained 9 pieces. We stopped a waitress (not ours) to ask about it. She took care of it right away and we were given a chocolate as our 10th piece. Our new server then brought an 11th piece, a creme puff, for our anniversary. My husband's water sat empty through the entirety of dessert.

After such a tasty and down right joyous meal I feel like the ball had been dropped. We were given up by a server who never cared to stop and say bye. We were shoved off on to a server who never cared to introduce his self. From years in the industry it felt like we were being judged as a ""who cares"" table, maybe because we're young, or maybe we weren't dressed to the 9's. But from the manager sticking us in that awful table in the beginning to not one, but 2 servers, ignoring us I needed to take that 5th star away. When you're spending $300 (before tip) on a meal that tasted OUT OF THIS WORLD, service should make that meal BETTER. Not leave a sour taste in my mouth.

Ambience is nice, dark,& loud. Reservations was on time. We sat at the bar and I enjoyed a nice legit old fashion. We were called to be seated in a nice booth.
Our server was cool, quick, & informative. I'll shall edit and add his name later on.

I liked how honest our server was to help us choose the $175 per person tastings verses the $275 menu. That way we can learn and have an idea what the restaurant is all about. He also threw in 2 complimentary tastings!

We started out with the lox and bagel which is one of my favorite tastings along with the olives & purée olives,Foe Grais with cotton candy, the chichiron with a fluffy dip was tasty, charcuterie board, grass fed Wagyu beef cheeks, mash potatoes au gratin,applewood oysters, roasted cauliflower with cauliflower purée, meat tartare sliders, croquetas de pollo, asparagus over romesco sauce, followed by desserts (chocolates). Sounds like a lot but remember these are small tastings and was good for 2 people.

Everything tasted so delicious. I had a second drink in between ( Aladdin Smoked) to sip on and it was pretty good. The reason for dropping 2 stars was 1) next day I got really bad food poisoning. My husband asked for medium rare for the wagyu. It came out pretty rare but I ate it anyways thinking that's how it's suppose to be prepared. I also think maybe the tartare didn't help and it's possible my stomach cannot handle it. My husband was fine. Was bummed I nearly vomit all day during our last day in vegas. 2) I was hoping more of a explanation of what we were eating, maybe some education on how it's made or with what. Restaurant seemed so busy and loud, we couldn't hear anything. 

Overall, as first timers, it was cool. It was a neat experience and if we come back, we would prob skip the tastings, order a meal, and make sure our meat is cooked more. It's too bad we spent about $500 and I ended up getting sick. I am glad my husband enjoyed his bday dinner!",OOWeFfXKvEMJFeqjUHBp-w,0,0,3,CAJjX2TJ-C0VuIk4MwzdaQ
4554044,2017-03-27,3,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I've dined at 'fine dining' establishments before. I've been whisked away on culinary adventures in Chicago, Anchorage, Seattle, and Honolulu. I know that, sometimes, spending $200 on a meal means I'm going to be given an experience worth having. Bazaar Meats is widely advertised throughout Vegas- with signs along the Boulevard every few blocks. Even our cab driver recommended it as a place to go. What isn't openly disclosed is the price, the ambiance, or the odd table service. 'Bazaar Meats' should actually be called 'Bizarre Meats', because that's the experience I had here.

My parents and fiancé visited this place with high hopes. A nice dinner- hopefully with some very good steak choices. Disclaimer here; this place is classy. It's upscale, but there is no dress code. So you have the Midwest couple to the left in a t-shirt and jeans, and the older East Coast couple to the right in almost formal attire. There's business, business casual, cocktail-wearing bachelorettes, and formal here. There's also a few random casual people who somehow found their way in. The low lighting, formal-sporting waiters, and request for reservations at the front indicate this place wants its customers to dress nice. They don't enforce that rule, though, which really makes this place seem a lot less 'fancy' than they're trying to be. As a disclaimer, we didn't know how to dress- and my parents were the Midwest couple in casual attire. I'm not judging people who go here in casual wear- I'm saying this place doesn't adequately advertise itself for the ambiance it seems to want to create.

We were promptly served water and our waiter handed us four GINORMOUS menus. We were each handed a glass framed menu measuring approximately 16 inches in length. This thing was obnoxiously large, heavy, and hard to read. The lighting here is low (which creates a very romantic atmosphere), but the frame on the menu reflects the lighting, making it hard to read. The writing is also very small- so be ready to squint. This wouldn't be an issue if the glass cover wasn't reflecting the light as well. 

The waiter then began to describe the dining process. They do 'shared plates' here- which, again, is something they don't ever advertise- so you're just kind of thrown into this weird culinary experience upon walking in. You order a series of meat dishes to share with everyone at the table. One person does not receive their own steak. You order a selection of 2 to 4 steaks and everyone at the table gets a small bite. Steaks are priced by the ounce, and each 'serving of steak' costs between $30 and $140. There are also a few token seafood and poultry dishes. Want a salad? That's an additional $17. I've had upscale. I know the flavors. This salad was disgusting. A few random 'gourmet' leaves with lemon squeezed on top. No seriously, that's the salad. Avoid it. 

We ordered a steak (which, to be honest, I don't remember which one- it was around $80) and the chicken. This is what the waiter suggested. Between four people we got to share one steak and four pieces of chicken. The chicken was bland- barely seasoned. Supposedly it was some prestigious chicken from Europe- but a little bit of garlic, or parsley, or sage would have went a long way on those drumsticks. We ordered the steak medium rare and it came rare. With that being said we all liked rare, and agreed that it was a very well cooked steak. Barely seasoned with blackened edges and a soft warm interior. Again- it didn't come the way we ordered it, but it tasted great. The mustard sauce it was paired with was less than thriller. 

As a side we ordered mashed potatoes. It should have been called 'overly buttered potatoes', because according to my taste buds, butter was the only thing it was paired with. I would have been happier with truffles or onion or something- but no, this 'gourmet' restaurant decided that butter was the ideal ingredient to mix in, and left it at that. 

Our total with the tip was around $240. None of us left feeling satisfied- and it wasn't because we didn't get enough to eat. It's because the food wasn't rich or even remotely worth the price. The only thing that made this place unique was the way the food was served. I could have gotten a better seasoned chicken at Olive Garden. And our waiter? He could have cared less when we expressed dissatisfaction with the food- exclaiming that it was 'healthy' and pointing out all of the extravagant foreign farms the meats had come from. 

I don't know- maybe some people enjoy spending hundreds of dollars on ""bizarre"" meats. Personally, I'm not one of those people, and the rest of my visits to Vegas will not include this establishment on my schedule.",K4p0zpBKqPI7xBf6_RamYQ,2,0,2,xUVdyZqY_ulasofcFF08GQ

Great ambiance. We got to sit in front of the open grill area and meat counter. Awesome display of meat. 

Cocktails were tasty. Food was really good but I've had slightly better meat elsewhere. 

Steak tartare was on point but a little weird serving it with buttered soft rolls. The butter overpowered it and tartare was better by itself. Prefer when servers with a plain thin cracker vehicle. Cool that it was served tableside. 

Can't come to Bazaar and not get the fois gras cotton candy pops. Yummy 

Got the Charcuterie chefs platter and it was slightly disappointing. The Iberico ham was amazing and I always love Spanish Chorizo. 5 other meats of which 1-2 we didn't love. They had mortadella which was cut about an inch thick and wasn't too good. I love mortadella but it's always sliced paper thin not sure why they went that route on preparation. 

So many options for steak. We went with the Rosewood Ribeye and split it for two. More than enough meat for both of us. At $75/lb it cost a little over two hundred bucks. It was good but I've had big tomahawk or porterhouse for two type steak that tasted just as good elsewhere for $100 less. It also needed more salt. 

Service was great and at the end of the day you done for the experience and the meat so I'm not too disappointed with the slightly high prices.",zWHizurHN3kAF4qgJlbt2g,0,0,4,HWs4mqm5Gu6Fj56LBgGa5g

I feel like we tried 100 things but only a few of them stood out. 

- Croquetas de Pollo- I liked these, on the verge of being too salty which turned out to be the theme of the evening. Bechamel sauce made this a very rich bite. 
- Air bread steak thing - Not bad
- Beef with Oysters - Liekd this tartare. Heavy on the hoisin. Also probably the largest plate we had that wasn't steak. 
- Foieffle - I was into this. A bit sweet, and very heavy on the foie. Liked the combo. 
- Pig Ear app - this was a special that evening. Pig ears were treated like oysters and had some type of gelatin all around them. Wasn't a favorite. 
- Grilled Pulpo with Potatoes - Incredibly salty. Inedible. Had to send back. Server said the potatoes were cooked in salt and acted like it was normal for this dish. I asked him to try it. There was no way. Kind of a bummer he defended it the way that he did. 
- Robuchon potatoes - unreal how much butter goes into these. They were great. 
- Grilled Baby Corn - ok I guess. Not into the mayo. 
- Tomato Salad - Good. 
- Mushrooms - Big mushrooms that came face up with what seemed like chimichurri inside each one. Very meaty. 
- Rosewood Texas Wagyu/Black Angus - $145 for a pretty hefty portion. Steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender and fatty. A good rec by the server. 

All of the above plus a $72 bottle of wine, and two cocktails came to $270 per couple. Pretty expensive especially given that this doesn't include the one dish that we had to send back. I left full but not completely stuffed. There wasn't any one dish that sticks out or that I'm craving.

We had a show to catch immediately following and asked our server regarding our time constraints and he assured us it would arrive with enough time for us to savor and enjoy rather than scarf it down. 

this pig though... it was absolutely delicious and worth the wait. it just melts in your mouth... then *crunch* goes the skin. now... here's the filipino side of me speaking... but it would have been great to pair my lechon with a bowl of steamed white rice. word!

Along with the Roubuchon potatoes and two appetizers (cotton candy foie gras and one of the carpaccios), this was the perfect amount of food. The steak is better than other high end steakhouse steaks because it has a *slight* dry aged flavor that is almost an aftertaste, followed by the fatty juicy meat flavor. I find most dry aged steaks too dry and gamey- this was the perfect flavor. The fat content, unlike most ribeyes, was also just right. You didn't struggle to cut through any gristle, and 100 percent of the meat was edible and delicious, not too fatty. The steak is also presliced, which is great. It's a level of meat where you stop talking and savor the flavor, focusing on the taste. Almost melt in your mouth, but not in a Kobe beef way- just authentic prime ribeye that's at the very top level. Significantly better  even than the Capital Grille in Chicago, and that's a tough standard. The Roubuchon potatoes were astounding. Best I've ever had and a perfect compliment to the steak, they are a must. The carpaccio was just average, and the cotton candy foie gras was interesting but tiny.

A grilling station for meats.  A station for cured meats.  A fresh seafood station and a regular kitchen.

Service was very attentive and helpful, highlighting the restaurant favorites.  Every dish is well flavored and masterfully complimenting each other.  

Cotton candy foie gras- unbelievable!  Sweetness of the light puffed sugar, mildly cuts into the deep rich flavor of the foie gras, making this so wonderful.

Kushi Oysters - fresh briny flavor, accompanied with a classic cocktail, a vinegar based and finally Jose's special sauce (SOOOO GOOD)

King crab/shimp cocktail- its topped with a salsa like sauce that is really good.  NIce big morsels of king crab meat and shrimp.

Uni w/ginger - fresh rich creamy 

Flat Iron Washugyu from Oregon - good but compared to the Japanese kobe .....not even close.

4oz kobe rib eye. - I love how it is cut into a long 2in cube.  This way all four sides gets well seasoned.  Its literally like biting into a cut of tofu with this unreal beef flavor.  One of the bests Ive ever tasted.

Bazaar Meat isn't cheap, that's for certain, and the dining experience does take a while, but nearly everything I tried here was excellent!  I truly don't recall a low point of this meal, from the service to the quality of the food to the décor. Even the displays of raw meat and vintage slicers and food prep equipment at the center of this restaurant where some of the cooking and food prep. is done were a really cool touch to the look of the place!

When we were given menus, I was a bit confused at first, as some of their meats were listed as 2.5 pounds.  One of the steaks listed in the ""not so big"" section of the menu was 22 oz!  What??  Then along came our server to explain that the concept here is to order a few dishes that are large enough to be shared.  He also explained that some of their cuts of meat are made to be cooked, smoked or go through other types of preparation that takes several hours.  Here they basically do the hours of work ahead of time so that most of their meats simply need to go through the last 40 or so minutes of cooking and preparation once you order them.  This made one of the guys at our table a bit nervous as we were seated at 7 and he needed to depart for the airport no later than 8:30 to catch a red eye.  Our server promised this wouldn't be a problem, and certainly enough, he was right.

For starters we had the croquetas de jamon and gazpacho shots. For the main courses, we had the pork loin with roasted apples, the lamb and the tenderloin steak. We also ordered the asparagus and spinach with apple, pine nuts, shallots and raisins.

As mentioned, I can't remember a downside to the meal, everything was excellent and all the meat dishes were cooked perfectly. I also liked that a side was included and served with nearly every one of the meat dishes which complimented it perfectly...The pork came with roasted apples, the steak came with a sauce and the lamb also was delivered with a condiment to compliment the flavor of the meat.

We left here full but not stuffed which was great, and to boot, they got the one member of our party out the door in time to catch his flight, just as the server promised!",-VOylYXNq7sG6As966yTxA,4,6,4,yJTcNScNiqWYmu1P9aLgfg

Bazaar does an elegant spin on disheveled and it works. The chairs don't match, the tables are all different in one area to the next, the chandeliers aren't the same. But that's the fun of dining here. We had a double birthday for 7 people were seated at the ""game of thrones"" table. Medieval iron chandelier, colossal chairs and mounted game heads on the walls. Upon arrival, take note to visit the 4 open kitchens! The meat cabinet is the most interesting. The seafood kitchen is in the back room. 

To suit the theme we ordered the quarter roast suckling pig (you can get a whole suckling pig too) which you can see hung in the glass display out front. This item is a must have since it made our steak take a back seat. There isn't anywhere that can do pig this tender and juicy. Mash potatoes were excellent to pair, which heirloom tomato salad which were very fresh. The one bite cotton candy foie gras is an experience on it's own. Creamy foie gras which the smooth texture blended is wrapped with a sweet grainy cotton candy. Just genius. Chicken croquettes were sent to the table compliments of the house which were a nice crispy kick to the meal as well. Would order on our own the next time. To complete, there was plentiful dessert (I had the chocolate matcha tea which was excellent) and smiles all around.

We tried a variety of dishes, and our waiter was so kind in sending some samples from the kitchen: the cotton candy foie gras (same as what Bazzar in LA had before banning foie gras), the bagel and lox cone (not worth the $, save it for the main course!), the smoked and ice oysters (an unique take worth trying), and the Foieffle (A MUST).

For the main course we had the Mishima Reserve (their steaks go by weight, I think ours was around 2 lbs. with plenty to take home), the mushrooms (an unique take different from your average roasted), and the Delmonico (very Joel Robuchon like). It was fantastic, and overall up there with my personal favorite, Craftsteak. I really do recommend coming with a large party so you can try lots of different things.

We made reservations for 5:30pm (time they open) for 12 people. We were seated right away at a long table. Since everything is served tapas style, we split the group in half to make sharing easier.

Pitcher of Sangria to share - Refreshing and light. The 6 of us each got about 2 full glasses. I wish I was able to try one of their more innovative cocktails, but I shall save that for next time.

Starters:
Reuben - This is very similar to the Philly Cheese Steak in LA. Each order comes with one ""air bread"" filled with cheese and meat on top. Unfortunately, I liked the Philly Cheese Steak more. The swiss cheese in the Reuben was a bit overpowering.

Beef & Parmesan Grissini - 5 long breadsticks with beef carpaccio wrapped around. Served with a delicious parmesan sauce. This cheese wasn't too overpowering. It complemented the bread and meat very well.

Classic Tartare - Served tableside, which was awesome. I was drooling while they were making it. Very well seasoned and quite acidic, maybe from the mustard or sauce? We made tiny sandwiches with the cute parker rolls and it was perfect. 

Entree: 
Blood Sausage with Uni - Only dish I didn't really like since I'm not a fan of blood sausage. So although this is the best blood sausage I've had, that's really not saying much. I ate the uni separately since its delicate taste gets totally lost if you eat it together.

Wagyu / Angus Rib Steak - HUGE portion. And so it should be as this was pretty pricey. They price by ounce but a lot of the weight comes from the inedible bone. There are two different cuts, and I wasn't sure which was which. One was cooked medium rare and was very juicy and flavorful. The other was cooked more well done and was a bit tough to cut through.

Sides:
Robuchon Potatoes - Soooo heavenly. Their description is literally ""butter, butter, some potatoes, and more butter."" Can't go wrong with that! The texture was silky smooth too. I slathered the potatoes like sauce all over the steak and it made it that much better.

""Dessert"":
Foieffle - Comes with 2. A puffy waffle that when cut into, melted goodness of foie oozes out. It's a mix of sweet and savory. The peanut butter and honey gives it a sticky texture, but its sweetness balances out the fattiness of the foie. The waffle itself is light and crispy.   

Foie Gras S'mores - My favorite dish saved for last! Also a play on sweet and savory which I'm realizing is probably the best way to enjoy foie. Comes with 4. The foie, chocolate, and marshmallow are sandwiched in between thin, crisp graham crackers. Yum!

Service was good, as expected from a high-end restaurant. Our waiter was a little snooty but he was very attentive and tried to suggest items based on our likes and dislikes. Our bill came out to around $120 per person, inclusive of tax and service, which I thought was very reasonable. Will definitely be back, not only to try new items, but to also order the same ones again!",9IX2jJzDNvODLA9EzSKV5A,1,0,5,86SpsP5Z8g0QIrlj9XbJxg

4678114,2016-07-12,3,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"LOVE this place.  $$$$ BUT WORTH IT!  Best meal/FEAST of my life! 

SOME LITTLE STARTERS:
Cotton Candy Foie Gras ($8 each): perfect little shot of foie gras. the tint of sweetness is perfect
Ferran Adria Olives, Modern & traditional ($16): Very interesting.  So much flavor in your traditional olive and the Ligquid green olive is (literally) bursting with the same flavor
Bagels & Lox Cone: ($6) Two-bite cone.  Perfect portions and strong (in a good way) flavors to capture that traditional lox & bagel taste with the cream cheese and salmon roe.
Reuben ($14): I know this is silly but I like to think of them as bougie adult lunchables hehe Air bread filled with a cheese (white sauce - tasted to me like creamy ass cheese. glorious) with thin slices of yummy beef on top 

FROM THE RAW BAR:
Geoduck ($26): I have NEVER had this in my life.  and I liked it!  I'm not too sure about the TASTE itself but i loved the texture (which isn't what i say often lol)  Perfect with some soy cause
King Crab & Shrimp Cocktail ($32): Uhh... Can't go wrong. amaze-balls.  Nice, big chunks of crab and big shrimp. More please! 
Smoke & Ice Fresh Oysters ($24): You can smell the apple wood-smoke when you go to slurp down the oysters 

FROM THE MEAT BAR: 
The Classic ($24): Beef sirloin tartar with mustard, egg yolk, hp sauce and some hot sauce!  They make it AT your table.  Nice little show for you to see it all come together.  Serve with some cute ass bread rolls.  They make it pretty well but they will ask someone at the table to taste it and to add either oil, hp sauce, or hot sauce to their liking.  I had them add just a tad more hp sauce.  Perfect hot sauce kick.  
Beef & Parmesan Brissini ($26): Washugyu beef wrapped around a breadstick.  The onion puree-- dank. 

SOME LITTLE SANDWHICHES: 
THE Foieffle ($12) Air waffles with a peanutbutter taste and honey drizzled.  Yum.  SWEET

FROM THE FIRE PIT
Suckling Pig ($160 quarter/$540 whole): MUST PRE-ORDER. AND IT'S WORTH IT TO PREORDER!!  I've never had such a TENDER pig before.  Yummy, yummy skin. 
Steak: ugh. Can't go wrong.  Nice thick ass pieces and done perfectly. They are pretty on point with making it the way you want it too.  Nicely cut and ready to share. 
Fresh Sea Urchin($26): Uni flatbread. amazing. just... order it. 

VEGETABLES & SALADS: 
Grilled BAby Corn ($16) Baby corn done like elotes.  Good but I was aiite at this point 
Piquillo Peppers ($13) perfectly grilled.  I love how it was charred 
Setas al Ajillo ($15): MUSHROOMS with liquid gooodnessss 
A SIMPLE TOMATO SALAD: ($15) My friend said that they put the tomatoes in boiling water for a bit to break down the skin of the tomato but it's not messy.  It's perfectly soft.  This was SO refreshing and definitely nice to have between the different plates we ordered.  

POTATOES: 
I wanna say i got the Robuchon ($19)  LOTS of butter and creammyyyyy!  Good filler. But at this point, I was already at stomach capacity! haha 


DRINKS: 
I forgot what we had ordered but their bar makes great drinks.  We also had a liquid nitrogen cocktail (?) a barcardi infused sherbet-like cocktail  -- My friend ordered so I can't recall.  But ask your server! 

SERVICE: 
Super friendly. Fast.  Great recommendations.  Ask for OPLE'S recommendations.  You won't be disappointed :)  GUARENTEED! 

AMBIENCE: 
Classy.  Upscale.  Quiet.  Intimate.  We had 6 people and sat in a round table.  Loved how it was easier for us to converse.

I'll start with the decor... and this applies to the SLS as a whole in addition to Bazaar.  It's just OK.  I can't say that it is by any means opulent or spectacular for the money.  There are these really weird and cheap looking clear plastic stags that where hung on the walls above the bar.  I remember seeing the wires and plugs for these weird lights and thought it looked cheap.  We were trying to put a finger on it and came up with this... It appears when they were renovating the old Sahara, they didn't have the budget to spend on a really professional decorator/designer, so they spruced up something worn and outdated half assed.  If you go to the Cosmopolitan, you will see the difference.  Thing is, the SLS is practically the same price and not half as nice.  I wasn't ""grossed out"" or anything, it's just not worth the money, restaurant included.   Service at the bar was not great but whatever, it's not like we were in a hurry.  Food... pretty good.  Not sure if the menu is the same or limited because it is the bar, but tasty none the less.  Really expensive drinks so be prepared.

4693802,2015-11-15,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Let me start off by prefacing with the fact that I went to Bazaar Meat on a Saturday night with two other Asian girls and an Asian guy. Now I mention this because I definitely think the host staff was slightly partial to the fact that we were young and Asian. I'm from New York and a frequent visitor to LA and Vegas so I know that the ""scene"" is totally a thing. This restaurant definitely seated guests accordingly in the dining room based on physical appearance and assumed wealth/social status. We had a reservation and arrived early, but ended up waiting almost 30 min past our reservation to be seated.

That being said...

The restaurant is beautiful! The entrance is open and the bar is directly behind the host stand. Right when you walk in, you see the open kitchen and large slabs of meat that are on display. There is modern taxidermy on display, beautiful whimsical wallpaper. The restaurant is very ornate, dark and sultry.

We were seated towards the back of the restaurant near a large semi-private dining room. The menu is a little overwhelming as it comes out on one sheet on a large double sided ""board"" so to say. It took us a while to go through it and actually decide what we wanted to order.

The chicken croquettes were brought out to our table on the house for the reservation mishap. They came out in a frosted glass sneaker and to my surprise were absolutely delicious! So creamy and savory - I would order them again. We also got the bagel and lox cones and the classic beef tartare. The bagel and lox cones were nothing special, but the beef tartare was to die for. So melt in your mouth flavorful. I also remember getting some crunchy bread sticks with prosciutto and this cheesy dip, which I no longer see on the menu, but that cheesy dip was awesome.

For the main course, we got a large ~32oz cut of the most expensive bone in ribeye to share, with mushrooms and Brussels sprouts as sides. Maybe I wasn't very hungry, but I thought the steak was nothing special. Still good though. The mushrooms were good, but didn't blow me away. However, the Brussels sprouts were so delicious! It was a beautiful dish. They came with ""lemon air"" - basically what it sounds like it was frothy lemon infused air bubbles (like bath suds but obviously edible) that sat on top of the dish of Brussels sprouts. It was fun and whimsical!

Overall:

Food 4/5
Service 4/5
Decor 5/5

4704318,2015-06-27,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We did not have a great experience at Bazaar Meat, and there are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas for me to give this place a positive recommendation.

First, this is not your traditional steakhouse and is instead a hybrid of a tapas bar and a steakhouse.  The tapas aspect is actually what attracted us to the restaurant.  However, you should be aware that many of the steak options can only be shared between multiple people and they can't do cuts for a single person.  This was disappointing as my wife and I have different preferences in our steak cuts.  I'm not counting this against the restaurant in my star rating, but it would have been good to know going in.

Our negative experience comes partly from the service.  The service started out very good, but our server disappeared about half-way through the meal.  It took over 20 minutes to get drinks we ordered, my wife's steak was overcooked but nobody came by to check on how our entrees came out, we weren't shown a desert tray, and it took forever to get the check.

The second aspect of the negative experience I alluded to above: My wife's steak was badly overcooked.  That is really not acceptable at a high-end steak house.  Furthermore, the steak was sliced before they put it on the plate so they had to be aware that it was badly overcooked.  How many things have to break down for something like that to get delivered to the table?

The third aspect of the negative experience was that nothing was all that phenomenal.  When you are paying the prices they ask at a restaurant like Bazaar Meat, I expect to taste some memorable dishes.  Even among the dishes that were prepared properly nothing we had was particularly memorable.

Later in our visit we inadvertently ate at another Jose Andres restaurant, Jaleo.  We would not have eaten there based on our experience at Bazaar Meat had we realized they were owned by the same person.  I'm glad we didn't make the connection beforehand, because our experience at Jaleo was much better.",IcI8W2yQjUgH__squR6mLw,0,0,2,mwdx1lF3Ym-R-sFBOOdR4Q

We had a perfect Chateaubriand but the highlights of the night were the small plates: a recommended thin-sliced jerky was soft and packed with flavor, Jamon Iberico de Ballota served w/ thin bread and roasted tomatoes and garlic was possibly the tastiest dish I've ever had, bison buffalo style carpaccio was perfect, and their small round roasted potatoes w/ a dipping sauce were also a unique treat.

4744429,2015-03-05,12,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Bazaar Meat is one of those restaurants that had me do a double take after a much improved second visit.  My first dinner here was a large group dinner where we split a pig, steak, and many sides between 9 people.  I felt that the pig and steaks were expensive and did not offer a significant value at the price point; it was a three star experience for me.  I hesitated to return, but I'm glad I did.  For my second visit here a friend and I opted to only order small dishes and appetizers; I highly suggest going this route.  The dishes are perfect for two to three people to share, and you get to experience the creativity in the rest of the menu.

Repeats Eats:
Cotton Candy Foie Gras - A small, one bite treat.  As the cotton candy and sugar dissolve, it slowly exposes the savory foie inside.
The Classic Tartare - Delicious.  The best tartare I've had.
The Foieffle - Super rich.  It's good, but even with splitting it in half, I'd be okay with an even smaller portion.  I can't imagine eating this by myself.
Fried Oxtail Steamed Bun - Very decadent, and very juicy.  I'd eat a whole one by myself.  Small but worth the price.
Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega - Very tender pieces of octopus served with potatoes.  
Fresh Sea Urchin - Uni, iberico lardo, served on toasted bread.  Great for sharing.
Wagyu Beef Cheeks - Incredibly tender, bold flavors, made me not want to share

Eh:
Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron - It's neat because it's big.  It's a stronger flavored chicharron.
Suckling Pig - Dry and lacking in flavor.  Portions were tender, but tended to be the exception.
Beef Rib Steak - I think we had the Michima Reserve? Good, but expensive, steak.  I didn't feel like the value was there.
Braised Lamb Neck - Not bad, but forgettable.
Tortilla Sacromonte - An omelet with all sorts of animal parts.  I liked the idea, but the execution was just okay for me.
Robuchon Potatoes - It's like eating a bowl of butter.  That can be a good or a bad things, depending on the person eating said bowl of butter.

Overall there are some definite hits in the small dishes portions of the menu, and I really look forward to returning for them.  However, if you're looking to come here for the pig or the steak, I'd recommend supplementing your meal with lots of small dishes instead of only ordering the meats.

Final note: You should probably rethink your menu design if it weighs more than a pound, is larger than a Pizza Hut Bigfoot pizza, and requires a screwdriver and an Allen key to assemble.  Seriously, the poor hosts should get a commission every time they have to seat a table of three or more, because those menus present a potential workers comp claim.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,15,16,4,mCJnRtbMhNb0BDp5UlRV1A

4775116,2015-05-29,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Another Josè Andrès restaurant to add to my food journal. 

When this restaurant first opened I was not impressed with what was suggested to me. I was definitely reluctant to go again however a friend of mine said I should give it one more try. Glad I did because this time it was on point.

First off if you are an animal lover/activist or even Vegetarian go far far away from this place because it is not a pretty picture with all the meats everywhere. 

There are different cook stations to view and different kinds of booths and tables. Also one big communal table if you are okay with sharing. 

The two things I would come back in a heartbeat are the classic steak tartare and the Robuchon potatoes. OMG talk about decadence. So bad but oh so good for you. The tartare is mixed for you and served with bread in a wonderful presentation. It was explained that it is best eaten like a slider but honestly I ate it just like Cookie Monster would eat his cookie. The potatoes were whipped to perfection. You think oh it's just mash potatoes but this is mash potatoes from the clouds. 

I have also tried the tenderloin which was cooked very nicely and a LOT of meat and we needed veggies so we had the carrots. I am still a eh person when it comes to foie gras so the Cotton candy foie gras was oooook. The croquetas were fine but ok which is weird cause I usually love croquetas. Oh and I forgot to mention my drink, I got a passion fruit cocktail and it was nice and sweet tart if you like that taste. 

I have a massive sweet tooth so I love when I still have a little room for dessert. And I mean little cause their selections are bite sized. Perfect way to end your night. I enjoyed my cream puff cause I wanted something classic but my guests enjoyed the chocolate rum cake. If I didn't feel so full I would have had at least 5 cause the size is just so petite. 

What I would say about this restaurant is that you should go if you are indefinitely a meat lover. Also make reservations since it is their busiest restaurant in SLS and just share and enjoy. Depends on my mood if I want to do tapas but now I know what my go to dishes are should I be in the area again.",QPbXBYWCSmw6-NhVWteaWA,0,0,4,AiZbhac4hQCFxtQ_cF9tLA

The wines were solid if a little lackluster and the server didn't tell us about the menu we had to ask. He also showed us the other tasting menus that had ""value"" for 150$ and 200$ a person. His definition of ""value"" goes in his pocket with a tip. Ha!

Anyways there was plenty of great grub centered around an entree of roasted filet, robuchon potatoes,and grilled asparagus with romesco sauce. 

Probably the most fun thing to east was the giant chicharon and yogurt mousse with sumac. We got to break it to bits with a mallet!

We saw the menu beforehand and already knew what to expect in regards to price. We knew what we wanted but didn't expect the preparation of our steak to take 50 minutes. We would've known if we read these reviews first.

Our order consisted of:
Bagel and lox - okay (2 bites)
Reuben - okay (2-3 bites)
Sloppy Joe - I actually really enjoyed it (came with 2 servings)
Bison carppacio - okay (5 slices)
Chateaubriand steak, 1lb, med-rare - excellent
Cauliflower steak - excellent

The dinner came with air bread, which is pretty much air puffed potato chips. If your diet or religious beliefs prevent you from eating pork, you may want the waiter/waitress to find out if they rub any pork fat juice on the steak. My husband noticed our steak had a little bit of a bacon flavor.

I have this idea of what a perfect steak should taste like, but it always seems to elude me, aside from very few steakhouses I've visited.  This was one of them.  We started with the gazpacho shot and foie gras cotton candy.  (I came back the next evening for a cocktail and another cotton candy, it was so good.)  For dinner, I ordered the 8-oz dry-aged flatiron, which was one of the specials that day, and we also tried the 2-lb bone-in wagyu ribeye.  Both were ordered medium rare.  The flatiron was very concentrated in that perfectly dry-aged funky way, and served with a rich, creamy sauce.  The ribeye was also delicious, but a very different experience.  The marbling made it really well balanced, though more subtle in flavor than the flatiron.  Both steaks were seasoned perfectly, with flaked sea salt, which added texture.  We had the confit piquillo peppers and delmonico potatoes on the side.  I loved the sides, especially the peppers, but next time around I would order lighter sides since the meat is already so flavorful and rich.  The restaurant had also sent over a complimentary appetizer of croquettes and chicharrones, both really fun in presentation and flavors.  Our server was also very patient with all our questions, and checked on us frequently.  All the staff was well trained and hospitable, which I appreciated.  I haven't had too much desire to go back to some of the other steakhouses I've been to, not because they weren't great, but because there are so many other places to try; however, I would likely go back to Bazaar Meat.",pXzn-YXxzp2_urtJXD_iLQ,0,0,5,uoksKvNTXr3V81ClF3t5jg

Jose Andres is such a great chef, that everything was great. Our only problem was that they kept trying to oversell us and cooked our steak wrong, never told us, but instead, just kept us waiting. and waiting and waiting. And Chateuabriand doesn't' take over an hour. 

If you've never been to a Jose Andres restaurant, you'll love the Bazaar Meat. the quality is superb and actually the meats are excellently prepared as they cuts are so great. Just give them time to work out the opening kinks and the waiters enough time to understand the menu and the diners.

4865855,2018-01-21,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"WOW, this was definitely a meal worth documenting in the books. My family and I came one night for dinner, and the experience, food, and service were absolutely amazing. 

The restaurant is literally like an upscale butcher shop and kitchen, where there's a meat counter and grill in the center of the restaurant. The meat counter is where you see all the types of meats displayed, and choose the type and weight of steak wanted. The restaurant emphasizes family style dining, and uses very whimsical approaches to food. 

We started the meal with some appetizers:
1. Foi gras with cotton candy- an interesting concept, but I wasn't too much a fan. The Foi gras was super small, and it tasted like a piece of salt with cotton candy. 
2. Chicken Croquettes (that come in a shoe!)-this was delicious! Cheesy, crunchy, and filled with a rich chicken flavor. 
3. The air bread- the best appetizer of the bunch! It literally tasted like a savory, cream puff filled with cheese. 

My family decided on a 3lb Wagyu/ Angus cut and the Turbo fish as our meats, and both came out to be amazing. Expect the cook time to be around 40 minutes, but the meats are well worth the wait. The steak came sliced and cooked perfectly to medium rare, and the flavor was amazing. They use a very simple seasoning, which really allows the favor of the meat to shine through. The turbo was also very good, and I was surprised by how delicious the grilled fish came out to be; it was tender, and the charred fish skin was delicious. 

We also got an assortment of pastries and cakes for dessert, and they were all small sized which was nice. All of their pastries aren't too sweet, and there's a great variety to choose from the small cart that they roll to each table. 

I would highly recommend the experience here! The ambiance and service are remarkable, and it really became a highlight of my trip to Vegas.",wDGhHOvTTSoui8H0R5K80A,4,3,5,wBUNQ1JZoIBwzKr4jLcpUw

In a fake and pretentious city that wows you with smoke and mirrors, this massive and utterly eclectic undertaking is truly an experience in fine dining - yet approachable and above all FANTASTIC SERVICE!  Oscar made our evening light and delicious!  Abel, his busboy side kick, was just as knowledgeable and didn't miss a beat.  Each dish that hit the table was served by an enthusiastic server - a preamble for a delicious surprise. And as much as we wanted steak or the suckling pig, we opted to go ""tapas"" because we just couldn't pick!!!  And the vegetables are as good as the proteins!  And beautiful to boot!  Beautiful food.  Served with enthusiasm and utmost professionalism.  AWESOME!

Great Spanish wine list, fine crafted drinks, Bazaar offers value - the croquettas de pollo were so crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside, you just have to wonder how they can pull this off without the messy sticky fingers in croquettas making process - they come to you whimsically presented in a glass sneaker!  They are perfectly shaped, crisp and not greasy, light and flavorful.  You have to try the cotton candy foie gras!  ITS CRAZY!  One bite that hits all your senses.  And even though your brain tells you ""this doesn't make sense"", your mouth just says WOW!

Loved the presentation for the caviar flight!  These came accompanied by puffy french fries.  Fun to eat, you get to play with your food - the colors, the textures and the flavors!  The ""traditional tartare"" is so cool!  Ever had tableside guac?  Well they make you tableside tartare!  Premium meat that is both super tender, melt-in-your-mouth, but the make it to your liking while you watch!  They serve it with these dainty little buns that are made with beef rendering... BEST SLOPPY JOE EVER!  Another one of those fun dishes that is robust yet delicate, and so ""calm the carnivore"" oriented!  We also shared the gorgeous, delicately charred and flavorful cauliflower and leeks.  The last star before we called it quits was the melt-in-your-mouth sous vide beef cheeks in a sublime pepper sauce.  FABULOUS!!! 5 kitchens, all running at once, working hard to make you happy and crave their food!  Thank the cooks when you go by, for a job well done, and a meal so well enjoyed!

For years, I have been raving about this place.  I first dined here a couple years ago and the food and service was fantastic.  So extraordinary that I would find myself regaling those gracious enough to listen with stories of how delicious the food was, and how incredible the service had been.  Filled with high expectations, four of us dined there in December to accomplish a bucket-list type of food experience.  The service is still fantastic and the staff caters to your wants and needs without being obsequious or intrusive.  The foie gras cotton candy was interesting and delicious and something I would highly recommend.  The rib eye, on the other hand, was nothing special and lacked the savory, caramelized deliciousness of a properly seared steak.  The lamb was good but nothing to write sonnets about and the big disappointment was the Robuchon potatoes which was heavily salted, enough so to be a distraction to the rest of the meal.
My dinner companions thought the experience was great, and perhaps I had too high expectations and fell victim to my over romanticized memory.  My harsh critique on the decline in food quality was somewhat vindicated when at another bucket-list restaurant, our waiter informed us that a large segment of the staff left Bazaar a few months earlier.
Make no mistake, this is still a fine establishment, but for $600 I was expecting a bit more, a bit more like I remembered.",OnY9GDrl2q1DX1LQf7ZWYw,0,0,3,Ve9z2CeOjgjuVAObByTNcw
4895914,2015-08-14,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"This place was awesome. It can be pricy so be sure to bring your appetite and credit card.

We decided to take a part of the Summer Tasting Special 2015. For $65 you received a series of different menu items. We felt that this was a great deal and the cheapest deal we would find here so we decided to check it out.

If you wanted more tastings or some of their higher quality meats you can get different priced tasting menus including $150, $200 and $250. This was out of our price range and we stuck with the Summer Special. 

On this menu you were able to get a variety of things including olives, cream cheese and lox, fried pig skin with greek yogurt, beef tenderloin, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and raw beef swirled on a garlic stick. The mashed potatoes were awesome because they were swirled in butter and the asparagus was really good as well. I can't pick a favorite because everything was so good in its own respect. 

In addition to the Summer Special menu items we added on the lamb and the fried oysters. I'm so glad we added on the oysters. They were awesome and cooked with butter. In my opinion anything soaked in butter is awesome in my book. The lamb was good but when served with the tenderloin it quickly made me very full.

The service here was good. At one point while setting out the steak silverware they accidentally dropped the knife on my friends water glass and it shattered. They apologized and quickly cleaned it up. I was kind of surprised for being so high end that they didn't comp something on our meal or do something to show they were sorry. Maybe if we were an older crowd they might have. I would have least thought our waiter to come and check on us after this happened and he didn't.

Food: 4.3 Stars
Service: 4 Stars 

I have been to Bazaar Meat in Vegas for a few times and this place is definitely my preferred one out of the four José Andres restaurants in town including é by José Andrés. I recommend to come here as a group since most of the items are designed for sharing. 

The environment is nice and quiet. It is tucked in the corner in the SLS closer to the BLVD entrance. 

The services I've received were decent but not memorable. 

Some of the things that I've tried:

1. Cotton candy foie gras (4/5): a must order here. It is delicious with sweetness of cotton candy reducing the gamey flavor of the foie gras. 

2. The classic tartare (4/5): a tartare that is mixed with caper, mustard and egg yolk that is made by your table. 

3. Beef Parmesan grissini (5/5): this is one of my personal favorite here. The carpaccio is so tasty with the breadstick. 

4. ""Beefsteak"" tomato (5/5): don't get confused with the name. There's no meat in this tomato tartare. The flavor of balsamic, cucumber, black olive came together so nicely and refreshing. 

5. Wagyu beef cheek (3/5): maybe it was a off day for this dish. I didn't enjoy my meat at all and it certainly did not taste wagyu. 

6. Catalan spinach (4/5): it was delicious with apple, pine nuts, shallots and raisins. 

7. Brussels sprouts (3/5): it was a meh for me. Not seasoned enough. 

8. Robuchon potato (4/5): the famous 50/50. It looks like butter and taste like butter. It's very rich so couple spoons was already too much for me. It seems like they changed the name to buttered potato, so they don't have to pay for the name maybe?! Lol. 

9. Wagyu/ black angus (5/5): the steak is pricey at $75 per pound. Each steak is about 3 pounds. I think this is good for 4-5 people. We made the mistakes getting two pieces and end up having too much steak left.

The drinks that I have tried here such as Cabernet and Syrah were quite good. The magic mojito is very yummy and pretty. Overall, its a place I would come back. A steak house with many other creative and delicious dishes other than just steaks. A must try!",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,6,3,4,8o3jBtuHrtK6dPNMrjTEHg

I make it a point to have drinks at Barmini once a month, and enjoy Paella Sundays at Jaleo frequently, as well as had dinner at all of his D.C. restaurants (I've also watched every single episode of Made in Spain!). So it was a natural decision to try a few of his restaurants in Las Vegas. Overall, very very good. 

We had a 9:30 pm reservation, so the restaurant was a little bit emptier that I wouldve expected. Decor is very Jose Andres, fun, whimsical but manages to feel upscale. They have their wood burning grills in the middle of the restaurant so it's pretty neat! We started off with the beef carpaccio with the parmesan foam (which was AMAZING), the chicken croquettes, and the Fried Oxtail steamed buns, which were out of this world. 
We decided to split the Chateaubriand and ordered some sides.... OMG; best meat ever. It really delivered. Wine was great and the service as well. 

Why only 4 stars, I would love to see NEW things at his restaurants. Some things I've seen over and over. However, it is definitely worth a trip and your money to eat here!",qXL4yM86eyBG23ACqhE3Gw,2,0,4,aTMVQQIG9tUKj6ExJWxj6w

As much as I LOVE food I sadly am typically about QUANITY over QUALITY because I am CHEAP! I would NEVER and I mean NEVER in my life select and pick a restaurant like this on my own but I came to SLS for a YELP event and heard about this place and REALLY REALLY was dying to try it so my boyfriend SURPRISED me with reservations for my Birthday dinner... I barely could allow myself to look at the prices so I guess it was a good thing the menu was super Heavy! that is the one thing I honestly would say could use a change. The menu is on this huge heavy board that yes looks beautiful but it makes it hard to hold and frankly I probably would of ordered more items had it of been easier to handle but it was best I not look  because its so expensive  for someone like myself who is not usually a fan of spending more than 50 dollars on a entrée/plate but I will say its worth EVERY penny...   I noticed some reviews had issues with servers so let me just say hands down our server rocked. Elias was his name and if you get a chance ASK for him because  not only was he REALLY REALLY friendly but he was not pushy at ALL. Plus he was attentive and paid attention to what was going on and kept us updated on the status of our food.He made sure we were aware of all the items and showed us the various tasting menus some of which looked really great to me but my boyfriend is the pickiest eater on earth so that was not a option for the evening but if I went again I would definitely try one of those out because it makes sense for the most bang for your buck.  Its a tapas style restaurant that seems best shared with numerous people if you want to try lots of stuff. Since I am mortified at the idea of anyone spending money on me I truly didn't order as much as I probably could have but we did have a amazing meal. I started off with a Cotton Candy Mojito that was delicious and definitely tons of fun to look at. For our starter we went with the - Chicken Croquettes which were really really delicious but also came out in a fun little converse style mold that is apparently Jose's favorite shoe and I love all that CHEESY stuff so it was definitely a winner. For our main course we went with the Suckling PIG which is so freaking AMAZING. It was the whole reason I wanted to try this place and it didn't disappoint me at all. I felt the balance and flavor was to DIE for and even if there was some fat that my boyfriend refused to partake in I seriously LOVED it. They serve the pig with a salad and it was super fresh and the tomato's were so great! I wish I would of known how much I would of loved the salad because I would of ordered more lucky for me the picky person I was with doesn't touch them so I had it all to myself but it really helps to add to the flavor of the pig. The QUALITY is so worth the $ and the wait so if you are looking for a speedy meal I would not waste your time trying this place because they warn you about the cooking times. Our potato side Pommes Paillasson made its way to our table before our pig did and it took ALOT of will power for us to hold off from eating them. I guess they make sure to bring the items out as they are finished but I usually HATE when stuff comes out separate but Elias made sure to let us know that it would be right out.  A fun part of the evening was getting to sit around and watch what other tables were ordering and all the fancy fun drinks and events that they were able to enjoy! I was peeking around the corner watching someone make a Awesome drink/Sorbet that has a lemon in that name  with Nitrous Oxide and our server must of noticed because a few minutes later he sent someone over to make me one as a Birthday gift! it was so fun to watch and really tasted amazing . I was so impressed with our server especially since we weren't the traditional diners ordering tons of items. Once the suckling pig arrived we dug into the Pommes Paillasson and frankly its like a hashbrown with some bacon and I was not a huge fan. It was pretty DRY and I didn't want to waste space in my stomach when the pig was there to be devoured. You do get a large portion of potatoes and it was nicely seasoned. Overall even if we didn't order a huge variety of items we left FAT and HAPPY and I had a amazing birthday dinner. If I make my way back to this restaurant I will be trying the Tar Tar and some of the veggies because I heard people o0o0o and ahhhh over them but once again being in love with a picky eater I didn't try any of it. This place also has Tons and tons of wine options and really cool people to help you with that but I am a beer and hot wings type of girl so I don't have the class or the taste buds to really go for any of that stuff but I did dress up and look the part to be at this restaurant and was treated AMAZING on my special day! so if you have a love for meat, the time and the $ give this place a shot and if you get the chance ask for Elias",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,0,1,5,kYb0pvn3PvU1kNKkFnBTPg

Jose Andres' reputation is already established. He doesn't *need* this place to make it. You can go to his restaurant in Beverly Hills or... come have a much better time in Vegas at Bazaar. The experience we had was excellent!

You can choose to go ala carte, order the tasting menu, or go boldly and order as you please. No matter what path you choose, the staff will not let you go wrong. Just remember; you are paying for service, so listen to their sage advice. From the kitchen, to the restaurant floor, these professionals will help make your experience exceptional.

But, to say I was underwhelmed with Bazaar Meat is an understatement.  When we walked in, I was blown away.  It's a dark and very chic looking place.  There is a small casino to your left as you walk in.  I can't believe other restaurants haven't thought of this, it's such a fantastic idea.  I've seen them in clubs, but not restaurants.  Waiting for your table, how about dropping a hundred at roulette?  

The hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.  We had drink orders taken very quickly.  So far, so good.  This place is really an assault on the senses.  There are smells from the grilling, the music is loud, there are alligator heads on the wall, and employees everywhere.  The kitchen is very busy, and you can see most of it from the seating area.  Our server started off friendly, and stayed friendly, but he also stayed away from our table.  This is one of the reasons I am giving 2 stars.  As the meal wore on, he was nowhere to be seen.  It took nearly a half hour to get our check.  Also, a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.  I know you are crowded, it's a new hot restaurant on the Strip, but these are issues that shouldn't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.  Most telling, two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.  The glasses remained on the table after they were completed, empty, for the entire 2.5 hour meal.  This would have been an easy fix, yet there they remained.  It became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.  Spoiler alert:  they were on the table when we left.  For all I know, they still are.

As other yelpers note, the menu is not your typical steakhouse.  It was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.  I would agree, this is a spot on description.  We started with the Iberico ham, the best ham in the world.  For $70 you don't even get 2 ounces (see my picture), but it's the best HAM IN THE WORLD.  I never regret buying this stuff, and it was no different at Bazaar Meat.  It is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them, sort of a Spanish bruschetta.  The whole thing is fantastic, highly recommended, but it ain't cheap folks.  We next went with the chicken croquettes.  You get 5-6 per order for $12, and they were fantastic.  Fried perfectly and lots of béchamel flavor.  Loved these things, I could have easily eaten another order.  

A couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.  I didn't try it, they ate it so quickly.  I regretted getting one, but we had other things on our mind....

Like the steaks.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Lindsay Ranch ribeye, which of course I'd had my eye on since making the reservation.  As a result, we went with the Mishiwa Reserve, which is $65 a pound.  Supposedly, our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.  Now, I don't carry a scale with me to dinner, but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.  But, we were hungry, and we ate it rather than complaining.  We did point it out to our server, but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.  He's absolutely right, but we still weren't happy with the size of this steak.  I don't know, maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.  Also, this is the worst dry aged steak I've eaten.  It didn't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.  Additionally, it wasn't adequately seasoned.  This was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.  We ate the steak because we were hungry (and paid an arm and a leg for it), but we weren't happy.

We also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.  Now we're talking!  This thing was as advertised: juicy, flavorful, with that great crispy skin.  We got as much meat off of the thing as we could, but all of us could have used more.  

For sides, we went with the Delmonico potatoes, asparagus, and carrots.  All were good, the potatoes were almost too decadent (if such a state exists).  The asparagus is small, but it was cooked well.  I could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.  The carrots with pepper and Greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.  I'd absolutely get this dish again.

We were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.  They, like the rest of the meal, were hit and miss.

Overall, I'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in Las Vegas.  I don't know if we went on a bad night (as noted above, I've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did, November 15, 2014, that complained about the service).  I also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.  But, for what we paid, a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.  I'd return, but not for a long time, and I will definitely bring a scale....",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,5,3,2,tK_hlz7LrG_mzeBaUuF_4A

Everything that we had was amazing. Got sent some complimentary Cotton Candy w/ Foie Gras and that was the kick to a wonderful start. Then we went with the mini Foie Gras soup, tacos (Iberico Ham with smelt egg wrapped in seaweed), Bison Carpaccio (so tender topped with celery and blue cheese) and the Live Uni (probably the freshest I've tasted here in Vegas) for appetizers. All so amazing.

The Uni was so good that we had to try the Live Uni (again) on top of Blood Sausage and THAT was divine. For entrees we decided to split the steak that was half wagyu and half angus (honestly forgot what it's called but it was too interesting to pass up) and the Suckling Pig Sandwich that was bursting with fatty flavor in each and every bite. I seriously have dreams about it. For sides we had the Baby Corn that was topped with popcorn dust. That didn't disappoint as well.

Felt a bit more adventurous and ordered the Beer Tartare that was done table side and was very fresh and flavorful to the palate to balance out the fattyness from the previous sandwich. Seriously. I hope everyone orders this.

On top of that, both my cocktails were done table side. The Cotton Candy Mojito consisted of an actual cotton candy fluff sitting on top of a martini glass then later diffused into liquid while pouring the liquor onto it. The Don't Be A Lemon was done with liquid nitrogen causing smokey sensations for necks to be turned throughout the restaurant. What an experience. 

And since it was my birthday, they were generous enough to send a birthday box full of different desserts in them- all were so good and nothing short of ordinary. 

Overall my experience is worthy of telling anyone to try to book a reservation at Bazaar for whatever reason. Don't pass this place up. It'll be sure to deliver towards your expectations 100%.",P49ulSRSHLNnIP-efK-qhw,2,2,5,JYStu_i5_AkLfIPFoyjwDQ
4986653,2014-12-10,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"My boyfriend and I had made reservations to Bazaar Meat for our anniversary - but you definitely don't have to wait for a special occasion to enjoy this restaurant. I had wanted to try it since we are both fans of Jose Andres' other restaurants in town and did not think we could be disappointed by this one. Plus we hadn't checked out SLS since it had opened.

Our reservation was for a Sunday night at 9pm. Before leaving, I had read other Yelp reviews to get an idea of what the must-try items were and what others had for suggestions, so I pretty much knew what I was going to get before we got there.

We arrived to SLS about 45mins early to walk around the place and explore. The hotel was smaller than we had imagined (and pretty dead inside) so we had a ton of time to kill. We figured we'd try to check in early in hopes of getting sat a little before 9, but to our luck, they were pretty full and the hostess suggested we wait at the bar with a couple of cocktails, so we did. I ordered the New York Sour and my bf got the Salt-air Margarita. Both were good. We've had the Salt-Air margaritas before at China Poblano at the Cosmo, there was nothing spectacular about this one, but it was tasty.

9pm came around and I was watching the hostess, hoping that our table would be next. She sat 2 other parties, that seemed to have arrived after us, before finally coming to get us around 9:15. I was a little peeved since we showed up early and the parties she sat before us showed up after. But who knows, maybe they were late for their 8:45 reservations. So whatev.

We started with the Cotton Candy Froie Gras ($8) which is a MUST-TRY. Heck order 2... or 3 each, but save room for other stuff too. It was spectacular in my mouth. We also order the Bison Carpaccio ($26) which may have been the most memorable and unique *flavor-wise* dish that we had all night. I felt like the pickled celery, blue cheese and buffalo wing sauce went nicely with the bison meat. Not your average buffalo wing. I had to try the Jamon Iberico ham as well, but it didn't come cheap at a whopping $70 for a platter of about 10-12 pieces of ham. However, it may have been the most delicious cured meat ham I have ever had. And since it was a special night, we said 'what the heck?!' and went for it. 

For our main course, we decided to just get the Washugyu Ranch (OR) Flat Iron steak. My boyfriend chose that one because it had blue cheese on it, which was unfortunate considering it was possibly the WORST steak I've ever had in my life! I'm not sure if it was the cut of meat, or how it was prepared, but it was incredibly tough and chewy. I was even having very hard time cutting the steak with a knife. I would not recommend that anyone ever order the Flat Iron steak from here, unless you are wanting to eat beef jerky for dinner.

Due to the season, the veggies were limited and the one I had originally planned on getting (the Grilled Baby Corn) was not in season, so the waitress had recommended the Roasted Cauliflower ($12) and we also order the Delmonico Potatoes ($15) and the Robuchon Butter ($15) mashed potatoes (I'd read amazing reviews on it) Both were delicious. My only criticism would be that perhaps the Robuchon potatoes were a little too rich for my taste, but it did say it was basically ALL butter. haha.

After that, I was so full, that I couldn't even think of dessert, so I just ordered a coffee and watched my bf enjoy a Tiramisu cream puff and a bacon and strawberry thing.

This restaurants only flaw was that awful flat iron, but I've heard the other steaks are killer, so we may have just ordered the wrong piece of meat. Next time, we'll know better.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,2,1,4,7iOTCpWuvA9E9dvCyzDbbA

They immediately recommended I try the cotton candy mojito which was delicious. After that I had their Salt Air Mojito, which was topped with a salty foam. Since most of the menu is tapas style I was able to try a few things without over-stuffing myself. The bartender, this turkish guy, was super friendly and made eating solo a bit more memorable.

4995822,2016-01-10,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"This was my first time at a Jose Andres restaurant and it definitely left a good first impression.  Our server was Nick and he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.  We sat at the meat bar (like a sushi bar) and there was a really loud group right next to us.  I think the chefs felt bad and offered us a complimentary sample of the Asian Taco, chorizo and another meat (not sure exactly what it was, but it was similar to prosciutto) All 3 were delicious and greatly appreciated.  

We wanted to try to tasting menu, but I don't think I would have been able to eat all of it, so we opted to start with the Classic Tartare.  OMG, we are still talking about it.  It was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  It was a very generous portion and I wish I had about 10 more of them.  They mix it all table side and all of the flavors compliment each other so well.The rolls that came with it were a perfect accompaniment.  The only thing that I am sad about is that I don't know the next time I'd be able to make it to Vegas to have it again.  

For our entrees we had the rack of lamb and wagyu skirt steak.  Both were cooked to perfection.  The lamb was seasoned perfectly and had such great flavor.  The steak was served over a rosemary mustard sauce that was delicious.  We also got the cauliflower steak, it was good, but not great.  I wish we would have gotten the Robuchon potatoes, they sound amazing.  

All in all, I am so glad we decided to try this place.  There are so many places to choose from in Vegas it can become overwhelming to decide when you're only there for a few days.

5022477,2017-08-21,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"before i take this place to the gallows, i must give a shout-out to our waiter abu, who was the only one of the few thing going for this aptly named restaurant.

during the course of our vacation, we went to a number of steakhouses i.e., maestros, delmonico's, tender and on the more reasonable side of the price ledger, ellis island. the one common thread these steakhouses have that bazaar doesn't, is they grill their steaks over high temperature. meanwhile, bazaar, goes through a multiple layer 4 or 5 zone cooking process that takes at least fifty (yes 50) minutes to cook your meat (bazaar)! the end result is a steak that  looks like a like a slug and has a texture of meat that was either boiled or cooked in the micro wave! 

i had the 22oz strip steak, which was dry and tasteless, while my wife had the skirt steak, which after a few bites, she had to return.
in this regard, the waiter , was very accommodating and offered to replace or take her meal off the menu and she choose the latter.

on the brighter side, the restaurant is beautifully appointed and the cuts of meats displayed add to the overall ambiance.  the desert was spot on, the bottle o of wine was properly selected by our sommelier,  who like our waiter , was on top of her game.

at the end of the day this eatery was not up to the mark and the prices foot to one of the most expensive steakhouses on or around the strip!  

i guess my wife and i are just not a fan of the cooking process and as a result, will not be returning anytime soon.

5022995,2018-02-26,3,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Bazaar Meats by José Andrés had long been on the wife's and my list of places to eat in Las Vegas.  However, we figured that we better go now given the SLS' constant state of flux and the seeming imminent closure of all of its restaurants with the recent ownership change.  We had early reservations (5:45PM) on Thursday.  Unfortunately, we got stuck in traffic around the Sands Convention Center coming from our hotel perhaps that made what we thought was going to be a short trip into an almost 45-minute slog.  I called the restaurant to let them know we were caught in traffic and would be late arriving.  They understood and graciously informed us that our table would be waiting.  Upon arriving, we were immediately led through the restaurant's sprawling dining room back to a more intimate space shared by the fresh seafood raw bar/prep area.  Our affable lead server, informed us that it was one of five separate kitchens in the restaurant, which we found interesting.

We knew before going in from its website that Bazaar Meat offered a couple of tasting menus; however, there was a third tasting menu that we weren't aware of that offered certified A-5 Satsuma Wagyu grilled tableside over a hot stone and Jamon Iberico de Bellota.  It was way over the top, but hey, we're in Vegas, so we audibled to it.  I ordered a Smoked Aladdin Manhattan ($18) a bourbon Manhattan made with Buffalo Trace but smoked with wood chips (cherry?) and poured out of the smoking bottle to enjoy while we waited for the parade of food to arrive.  It was a nice presentation easily matched by the satisfaction I received from the balanced, boozy, and smoky...but not overpowered by it...drink.  Our food began arriving at our table.  We received 12 courses with three sides and desserts.  Rather than giving a course-by-course description, I'll let my pictures do the talking.

It was adventurous, extravagant, a treat for all of the senses to include hearing the beautiful sizzle of A-5 wagyu on a hot rock.  However, as good as it was, it wasn't a flawless dining experience.  While the Morcilla with Uni was made with ingredients I love and was (still) delicious, it was also the lone conceptual miss as the blood sausage overpowered the delicate, subtle flavors of the exceedingly fresh uni.  Service was also a bit chaotic.  Despite our server's best efforts to choreograph our service experience, on more than one occasion food runners delivered food coming from one of the restaurant's five separate kitchens/prep areas out of the expected sequence, which resulted in confusion for us and our server.  In fact, we didn't get one of the courses on the menu.  However, to our server's credit, we got a generous portion of Jamon Iberico de Bellota to replace the missed item.  Finally, the wife and I each ordered a glass of red wine to accompany our wagyu beef.  The wife received hers, but it took the sommelier a noticeable amount of time to make it over to pour my glass.  While I appreciated the sommelier coming over to describe the wine she was pouring, it may have made sense to have more people trained/knowledgeable on the wines available by the glass and able to pour it using a Coravin especially given the sheer size of the restaurant, which was quite busy with several very large parties seated around the dining room.  These critiques, especially given the prices that we paid for the food and drink, were what kept me from being able to call Bazaar Meat a 5-star experience.  Still, these comparatively small faults were far outweighed by the strong positives like the amazing array of food and drink that we received.

Without a doubt, Bazaar Meat is a destination dining spot.  I'd definitely dine here again.  It will be a shame if the city loses this one-of-a-kind restaurant as a part of the SLS ownership change.  If you have the dime, Bazaar Meat is definitely worthy of your time if you're looking for the over-the-top, only in Vegas kind of meal.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,6,3,4,eE9MwX-H9f5PRDhSoixStA

5051420,2016-06-20,3,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I picked this place for my birthday dinner and overall it was a solid pick. 

We were given a standard menu, a beverage menu to peruse. There are tasting menus so ask for them as we werent presented with them at first. We remember there was a summer menu and we asked about it, and then they produced this menu for $85 ($65 promo price is no longer). This made me a little apprehensive about picking this place as I don't like when it feels like they are almost hiding options because they want you only to do the spendy menus only. It was described as very small 2 bite, but now that I see some friends reviews, I should have gone with a tasting but I was afraid of the whole having a cheap second dinner because it wasn't substantial. 

The hubby and I over ordered a la carte. 

I got a cocktail that was really well made. Forgot the menu name, but it had meszcal in it and some nice herbaceous companions which was perfect together. 

We started with the foie gras cotton candy. Fun food, but not something I feel is a must like others. I prefer the foie in a different manner, but glad I tried it as it does oddly pair well together. It's just the cold little cube of foie was not doing anything, it was just there.

Then the  classic beef tartare. It's not normally a dish we order, but heard great things. The portion was made tableside so you can get it seasoned just to your liking. I like that it came with warm rolls and there was way more tartare than you can fit into them so it's very generously portioned. Very good tartare, probably one of the better ones I've had. 

Grilled  pulpo (octopus) had a bit of a aggressive seasoning to it (in salt and seasonings), but has a nice char and still pretty good.

Butifara Sausage is made in house. It was solid as far as sausages go, but I feel that this could have been skipped for something a bit more ""special"", if you will. Huge portion, so get maybe only if you have a large dining party. 

Waygu beef cheeks was buttery delightful. It's very rich in flavor as theres nice fatty bits woven in there and the red sauce with it was sop up with some bread good. 

We got the Robuchon potatoes and it was indeed butter on butter. It was heavy, really too heavy as a main side as I wanted just 3 bites as the meat selections were already rich. 

Brussel sprouts roasted with a lemon dressing sounded like something that will lighten up the meal, but it was seriously a WTF dish. Soft veggies, sitting in a bowl with lemon water on the bottom, grapes and apricots that felt like a fruit salad spilled in it from another dish. 

Dessert we picked a few mini bites, a little tart, a few cream puffs. Nothing as bad, but nothing stood out as more than okay either. 

Service was friendly enough, but fine dining professional and unobtrusive. The pace of the kitchen was steady to where we were getting food in a good succession aside from the sides coming dead last after eating a lot of mains without anything. 

I feel like partially that we order differently we might've had a better time with the meal, but another part of me thinks perhaps the style of how food is seasoned is not particularly in my wheelhouse either. Glad I tried it, but not rushing to be back. If I do, I would scale down a lot and cautiously choose mains and sides while I scarf down more of that tartare.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,6,3,-KLcQ2VG-Q5QopcPqxPE2Q
5052995,2015-04-01,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Easily one of the best meals we've had. I noted my husband's shellfish allergy in our reservation,  and they had a shellfish-free menu waiting upon check-in. Our server was fantastic and made sure we ordered enough food without going overboard--especially since my husband would not be sharing any of my seafood and most food is meant to be shared.

I started with the Liquid Nitrogen cocktail,  Don't be a Lemon. It was prepared tableside and was a great way to set the mood--elegant, but fun. My yellow fin carpaccio arrived next, with chopsticks. Light and melt-in-your-mouth, with just enough acid to balance. 

My husband's classic beef tartare, sans anchovies, was the next to arrive. Great chat with the prep-guy about the values of tartare and the sourcing of the sirloin (California collective, retired dairy cows--this felt like Portlandia for a minute). My husband loved this dish. I'm honestly a bit afraid I'll discover he's sneaking off just to get this.

For entrees, we got the New Zealand rack of lamb and the grilled pulpo, with the roasted leeks as a side and the Aladdin Manhattan to drink, which was lovely and smoky. The fresh mint on the lamb was brilliant. The leeks were excellent. The grilled octopus was the only even mildly disappointing dish and that was only because Old School Pizzeria makes equally good octopus, not because Bazaar Meats was in any way bad. Gio just makes exceptional octopus. The price points were also similar, so this really isn't a complaint. 

My husband ate all of his tartare and 60% of the lamb, so he had no room for dessert. I got the the Tahitian vanilla and raspberry cream puff, the cassis meringue, and the strawberries, cream and bacon tart (which I split with him). I love that the desserts were small enough to experiment with. All of them were good, the cassis especially so. I would order a box of those.

5059269,2014-10-06,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Hands down the best meal I have ever had.  The steak tartare is a must-try, hand-mixed to your discerning taste at your table.  The can't-miss item is also likely the most bizarre one, Tortilla Sacromonte.  It's a sweetbreads, kidney, and bone marrow omelette, and the synergistic symphony of so many unique flavors and textures will make you wonder why all food can't be so exciting.  On the drink side, try the lemon shot (I forget what it's called).  The bartender comes out with a cart and synthesizes it there for you.  I say synthesize because, with the liquid nitrogen and its semi-frozen finale, it's really more of a chemistry experiment than a simple mixing of a drink.  On top of that, it's delicious.

As for the main course, if you haven't already taken your fill with the first side of the menu, you'll have a hard time finding anything you've found at any other restaurant.

5077222,2015-02-17,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Beautiful restaurant and fun concept.  I'm a huge fan of José Andrés' creative dishes, but some of my selections of the night just either didn't impress, or were poorly prepared for the price you are paying.

Here is a breakdown of what we ordered:

* The Lhardy's Madrid Beef Consommé (Sherry wine, quail egg, caviar): While the soup was good, I was not blown away.  Generally, when a dish is this small, it packs a world of flavor in those few mouthfuls.  I appreciated the raw quail egg, which gave the consommé a creamier consistency, but I felt as though the caviar was a waste as it didn't really add anything to the soup -- not taste nor texture.  Both of the brininess and texture that you enjoy in caviar got lost, being that the broth was already seasoned enough.  Probably not a recommendation.

* Cotton Candy Foie Gras (crispy amaranth): This was, without a doubt, my favorite dish of the night.  THIS was a dish in which creativity and flavor both succeeded.  I am not a big fan of sweets, so I was hesitant to order a dish with cotton candy, however, my love for foie gras dominates all.  The foie, covered with just the right amount of crispy amaranth for texture, was the perfect salty contrast to break the sweetness of the cotton candy.  You'll have to make your way through a bit of cotton candy to reach the foie at the center, but once you're there, you'll find that cool, creamy delight of livery goodness.

* Abalone (Dashi gelée, lemon, soy, salmon roe): I love abalone.  Don't expect to get a huge portion size for the price -- this dish really just celebrates the simplicity of this rare treat in tiny portions.  The soft, briny salmon roe was just the right pairing to contrast the chewy sweetness of the abalone.

* Beef Tartare with Oysters (fried egg, oyster sauce, pan de cristal): This dish truly was a let down.  It's probably the worst tartare I can remember tasting.  The only upside to this dish was the portion size.  It definitely got me full, but it was so salty that it was almost inedible.  I regret not sending it back, but our server was so nice that I think I just felt bad.  I'm not sure if I was a fan of the three oysters mushed into the tartare, either.

* Grilled Maine Lobster (Beurre Monté): While the flavors were on point, I'm not sure if it was worth it.  There wasn't much meat!  It says two pounds, but it was mainly all shell.  I was practically sucking on the shell because the charred flavoring was so delicious, but also because I was hoping that meat would magically appear.

* Grilled Asparagus (Romesco sauce): Another over-seasoned dish.  Great charred flavor on the asparagus (these were much smaller than I'm used to), but I couldn't get past the fact that my tongue felt shriveled up after every few bite.

As touched upon, I really liked our server.  While she made minor mistakes, which wasn't entirely her fault as it could have been some simple miscommunication on my end, her attention to detail and attentiveness was great.  Random note: my boyfriend and I did wait almost a half hour past our reservation time to be seated.  We were told that the tables for the 9:30pm reservations were not ready, though we saw quite a few open spots.  Could have been understaffed, but who knows.

Overall, a mediocre meal.  I regret not ordering many of the other dishes that I had my eye on, such as the Sea Urchin with Ibérico lardo, or the many recommendations I now had a chance to read on Yelp.

5094983,2016-03-19,13,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"A carnivores paradise.  Huge slabs of well aged beef cooked over wood burning grills sit alongside the likes of suckling pig, cured hams and the bounty of the sea.  The playful musings of José Andres clear in the molecular gastronomy of many starters.

To begin, do not pass on the giant chicharon.  18""x24"", crisp and lighter than air with the perfect porky flavor.  Lightly dusted with the spicy chili powder and served with a zesty Greek yogurt. Broken with a hammer tableside this is simply good eats. Other Great starters include the Andres classic cotton candy foie and liquid olives.  Modernist cuisine at its best.

Raw bar selections are outstanding. The live scallops with green peppercorns finally diced onions tomato and spicy togarashi makes the sweetness explode.  The abalone with dashi gelee, soy, lemon, and salmon roe vibrant with great complexity.  The geoduck, like candy from the sea when paired with its yuzu, lemon, finger, soy sauce.  Toothsome and oh so good.

Next up, a fantastic carpaccio. Classically prepared with the light sherry vinegar dressing, shaved Parmesan, and fried capers. Nice texture and good umame.  Tartars, equally good and classic in their preparation. Finally a great selection of cured meats including the Jamon Iberico de Bellota (acorn fed, free ranged, black footed pig). Opt for the chef selection ($60) to try them all.

To the steaks. Do it right and order a rib steak. Understand portions are huge with the typical cut at 2 pounds. Price varies based on the producer ($65 - $98/lb)  All steaks are very well trimmed, properly seared, and cook to temp over a wood burning fire.  The Lindsay Ranch Washugyu is decadently rich and tender with great beef flavor.  Try it along side a true Kobe A5 ribeye.

The A5 Kobe ribeye is a do it yourself, have it your way ordeal. Raw slices are self cooked on an 800° stone and finished with aged soy.  2oz minimum at $45/oz and worth every penny.  Sublime.

Finally the suckling pig. Golden brown and crispy skin on the outside tender and juicy porky goodness on the inside. $160 per quarter that can be easily shared among four as a starter.  Devine.

Great cocktails including Andres' signature gin tonic.  Very well chosen List of wines by the glass and bottle focusing on very high end Spanish producers. There are few bottles below $150, with the average bottle price $450.

Service is very friendly and efficient considering the number of large parties on a typical evening.

Note: don't let its location within the SLS fool you, this is a great restaurant with prices to match.  Expect to spend $300pp with modest alcohol selections.

This restaurant is more of a rustic/Americana hipster kind of place- super fun but not the upscale vibe that I love about the Bazaar.

Highlights:

Pork skin with dipping sauce, grilled baby corn, skirt steak, carpaccio, creamy mashed potatoes.

Service was polished and consistent from everyone on staff, and we never had an empty water glass or empty plate at the table.  Our server was professional and friendly, and helped me navigate the wine menu.  He suggested the perfect glass of luscious Mencia red when I told him what I preferred.

We started out with the Vitorre 1950 Carpaccio (Tenderloin of beef, black pepper, Parmesan cheese, capers, croutons, Sherry dressing), which was amazing. It was the perfect temperature and wonderfully seasoned.  I exclaimed that I could've eaten three more plates! 

Our main course consisted of the Chateaubriand Tenderloin with Perigord sauce and pomme soufflé. and the Delmonico potatoes with cream and cheddar cheese.  We were a little underwhelmed with the size of the steak (it said 20 oz on the menu, but looked much smaller than that), but the flavor was out of this world.  The potatoes were just as amazing.

Dessert consisted of small bites from a whimsical dessert cart.  We chose the chocolate tart and the eclair, both of which were ultra rich and, while they initially looked really small, were perfect in both size and flavor.  Any larger and they would've been a little too rich to finish.

- Foie Gras Cotton Candy; I always get it in LA and I wasn't about to drop my good habits. Can't believe I'm about to say it, but hell. Teeny tiny cube of foie gras for $8? Worth it!!
- Robuchon Potatoes; Dear God, it was like whipped butter. Whipped. Wharm. Bhutter. I was stuffed after downing a huge chunk of Wagyu and I would've still been down to shovel more of this dish down my throat. 
- Flat Iron Steak; What! How did this $50 steak end up being the stand out when we ordered like $200 worth of ribeye Wagyu?! It was so juicy and the bleu cheese kicked it up a hell of a notch.
- Octopus; So tentacled. So tender.

Forgettables:

- Fresh Raw Uni; I've been spoiled by LA uni. The saddest five tiny slivers of sea urchin gonads came out, for $26! Sure, they threw in some lemon foam, but still not worth it. Although to their credit, it did make one gal who hated hated hated uni exclaim after trying it, ""Wow. That wasn't as horrible as I expected!""
- Skirt Steak; meh. Save your money for the better cuts.

Ordered a ton more food but those were the plates worth a mention. Also worth mentioning was our rockstar server Chris, aka Leo. Bore a striking resemblance to the actor (minus the scruff and dad bod) and graciously handled us calling him Leo all night. He expertly orchestrated our dinner so that we were stuffed and nothing was left on the table after.

Can't say anything about the drinks since I don't partake, but considering we racked up over $400 on just cocktails, I'd say they're pretty tasty.

I came here initially for a friends birthday. Just a heads up no basic group of friends can come here for a birthday dinner because let's just say not everyone has a thick enough pocket. As a first timer here it was only right to order one of the beef rib steaks. I'll post a picture of the one I got. Pricing was done by the pound so don't let the 60, 70, 95 etc fool you. The server stated on average these steaks are 2.5lbs. However, have no fear if you don't have the appetite or someone to share it with like me they do have ""no so big guys"" section. If you do go with the steak got be ready to wait for it to be prepared to perfection. Perfection takes time but when your with the right people the time will pass quickly. We tried various appetizer on the menu as a group as well. I can't comment on them because I don't eat pork and they all contained bits and pieces of it. The ones I did try were delicious though. We also order a side of Mac & Cheese as a side and it was the perfect 5 Yelp stars of a serving. As our dinner came to an end the server handed us a red box filled with delicious pastries to go! 

If you like meat and you know what a good steak is this is has to be on your list. If you're into outback and generic ""steakhouses"" then take a damn seat elsewhere. This is for people that know what's up. Okay that was kinda stuck up but the truth hurts here & there.",vNGs6_DP7ZbtPwX7finVIQ,1,0,5,HDxUTev_1vtTF_UaruZHsg

5181480,2017-07-03,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Hello and welcome to Bazaar Meat. stop two on our restaurant week tour of Vegas. #helpoutdineout. We were meeting friends for this one on a Monday night so was hoping for a quiet meal. Place was very busy with several multi party tables. We met our friends who arrived first and were brought to the table and drink orders taken Immediately. I ordered a beer that I do not see often on menus, Weihenstephaner. Basically a Hefenweizzen. 
I need to start over a bit, this is our first time here so let me begin with the entry to this fine place. Bazaar is located in the rear of the casino and as you enter you are greeted by this incredible smokey smell of the charcoal wood being burned, On my left was a meat counter with active hot open grills being used to sear and cook various cuts of gorgeous meat, some up to 4 inches thick. after that was a Charcuterie area and in the middle to our right a wine/beverage station. As we approach our table to the left is a seafood habitat I will call it. A separate dining area where on display are various fish and seafood selections. 
As we are here for a special menu that is affordable and helps local charity, we peruse that menu and are given by the waiter, a description of the various choices. As it so happens they are out of the skirt steak so a bone in rib-eye is substituted. Not the 4 inch tomahawk. (damn). 
This is a tasting menu so it is not a choice of, it is brought out in courses for all to enjoy. Starters, Cotton Candy Foie Gras. Josie did not eat these so I had 2. gastronomy stuff is not impressive to me so this was not a big wow factor for me. Basically cotton candy on a stick with a very small bite of Foie Gras. Not a big fan and hard to describe. It was just okay to me. next was Croquettas De Pollo, Chicken Fritters. These were nice fritters with some chicken and Bechamel sauce. A mother sauce used in a different way. Served in a clear plastic tennis sneaker. next was a tomato Gezpacho. The rest of the table was enjoying this but the tomato cucumber coldness on my palet didn't sit quite right. Clams leche le tigre. I am a fan has a foam on top and a slight spicy bite. I was able to have two since Josie was not partaking in this delicacy. Finally a Spanish Pork sausage with honey alioli. Nice crisp skinned pork sausage, no particular deep flavor. Somewhat bland for my taste. 
Next course was the steak course and since the skirt steak was not an option two bone in rib-eye steaks cooked mid rare (rare actually) were brought out. Serbed with buttered, buttered, buttered creamy potatoes. These taters had just the right saltiness as well as buttered flavor. Also served with button mushrooms that had a smokey taste to them. An excellent accompaniment to the steak. 
So, this is where I may be prosecuted a bit. As well as they present everything and the cooking process on display in the front of the restaurant, I was not impressed with the steak. I know they are heralded for their incredible meat, but this cut and flavor was not impressive. Maybe I have become accustomed to a more seasoned steak. While I did enjoy the tenderness of the steak and the sweet smokey flavor from the hardwood grill, I was hoping maybe for a more seasoned steak. With all the wow factor things going on in here and the different flavor profiles of each dish, I was thinking there would be a special zest or spice beyond the smokiness of the char grill. I suppose the hype not worth the reveal. 
Desert round was assorted small cakes, tarts and cream puffs. 
Thank you for dining at Bazaar Meat. I may go back here again, but truthfully not within my everyday budget. I guess for me the experience wasn't worth my everyday man budget. It was nice to have a meal with good friends and support a local charity. If you like a good steak and seafood and have a budget for a more pricey meal then check this out.

I highly recommend the tasting menu for newcomers.  Each course exceeds, surprises, and delights. Bizarre Meat can be whimsical while  still honoring each item.

You will be taken on a ride from a sublime slice of Iberico Jambon to the molecular gastronomy of a deconstructed olive suspended in liquid sphere form.

Going so far as to source the Bread for their Pa Amb Tomaquet straight from Spain for the sake of authenticity, the rest of the Breads and Pastries made on-site, those looking for another tasty raw bite should consider the Hot Sauce glazed Bison Carpaccio that pairs brilliantly with Chef's Paprika dusted Potato-sticks, these two snacks offered as a conclusion to a bakers-dozen 'appetizers' before two more Cocktails were presented, the Pepino Sonado smooth and refreshing with a great mouthfeel while the sweet and juicy Sangria Roja expectedly paired well with the grilled Meats to come.

Not expecting whole-plates, the point being to see as much variety as possible from a menu that is broad but at the same time focused, it was nonetheless that several large cuts were presented in a grand display of entrees and sides, the Turbot and Octopus straight from Spanish waters to the Josper Grill both impeccably charred and tender with the Fish still out-ranking any other in Sin City and a close rival to the famous version of Elkano while the Pulpo was a classic preparation served atop boiled Potatoes dusted with Paprika. 

Deferring temperature to the kitchen, both the New Zealand Lamb Rack and Texas-based hybrid Cattle cooked Rare at low temperatures on the top rack of the grill, those who enjoy actually tasting the Animal as opposed to a bunch of Salt and seasoning will be duly impressed by the quality of either cut, Chef Pitts housemade Catalan Sausage also a remarkable dish that is currently available in a much smaller portion size than prior thanks to the Summer tasting menu.

Never one to refuse Joel Robuchon's classic 50/50 Butter and Potato Puree, Andrés again paying homage to a contemporary by name on his menu, additional sides included roasted Mushroom Caps filled with Garlic, Butter and bitter Nasturtium as well as spicy little ears of Corn with 'powdered' Popcorn, the Foie Gras 'S'mores' an excellent way to bridge savory to sweet, as was the first of two double Espressos on Ice and a stiff and smoky Cocktail constructed tableside entitled ""Blurred Borders.""

Previously underwhelmed by Bazaar's Pastry department, the idea of a bunch of petit fours sold sight-unseen at $2-8 seeming a bit disingenuous and unimaginative, recent times have seen the Restaurant usher in an immense Dessert Cart laden with over two-dozen choices, a 'one of each, please' strategy seeing two slates laid out with several clever creations, the Caramelized Pastry crediting Pierre Herme as well as the ones with Brandied Cherries or Bacon and Strawberries all quite memorable as were the Pecan Pie Cookie, Dark Chocolate Almond Éclair, White Chocolate Raspberry Chambord Cake and Tarts of Pineapple and Jasmine as well as Dulcey Pecan and Key Lime.

*****Although José Andrés seems to make the news more often these days as an outspoken advocate for political causes than he does as a Chef, 2017 finds Bazaar Meat amongst not only the upper echelon of Las Vegas Steakhouses but Restaurants in general, Chef Pitts and GM Argyriades running a tight ship even as the rest of the SLS stands in limbo with the sort of ingredients, cooking and diversity that sees one already planning a return visit mere moments after they've left.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,4,5,jFmcW2sGcGnwg8JkAbBuiw

Originally 2 stars, but I changed to 4.

José, you messed up on this one. I've dined at Jaleo, my brother and I have dined at MiniBar in DC, and my brother studied under José in college. With expectations high, especially for my parent's 30th anniversary, we thought we made a safe bet. Unfortunately, we were mistaken. I also want to say we came really hungry on a Saturday night.

Food
======
The food was okay. The steak was good, but for similar priced amazing steak, I recommend CraftSteak in MGM - it is awesome. The portions are small, like tapas, so order a few items. The lox bagel roll was really salty.

Decor
======
The decor was trying a bit too hard. With all types of knickknacks, especially the cumbersome paper menus in heavy, rigid acrylic, ordering and navigating the menu was annoying.

Service
======
This was the worst part. I'm not sure if good waiters don't want to work on that side of the strip, but the guy we got was pretty bad. He loved to talk, and before he asked us about our food allergies or dietary restrictions, he went on a 3 minute tangent about the iberican hams. We don't eat pork. This guy also asked questions like ""should I take your water?"" after my mother's drink came, and had the nerve to try to upsell us some desserts in a box to go since he sensed our impatience after 2 hours on Saturday night. Eventually, my brother told the waiter not to ask any more questions and just leave us alone. Also, he mentioned the steaks take 45-55 minutes to prepare, so we wanted him to fire our order to the kitchen ASAP. Pacing wise, our 6-7 appetizers came out within 10 minutes and we were done in 30 minutes. The next 45 minutes we waited for the meats and sides we ordered with appetizers. My dad ended up getting pretty upset and left after waiting 1.5 hours past our seating time (before the steak came our) and ended up finishing dinner at the food court in our hotel. We got the rest of the food to go since our hunger subsided by then, and I ate cold (but still tasty) steak in my hotel room.


Update:
=====
As you may see, Pano (the GM of Bazaar Meats) asked me to reach out. I did, and he followed up twice over the course of a week to get me on the phone. He was very apologetic and we spoke for 15 minutes about the experience and how he felt it was unacceptable that we received our entree 1.5 hours after our reservation time. He was very authentic and made sure it came across this was a very off night. He made it right to a point that I would go again and give it another chance. I can't hold a restaurant to the sins of one server, as the food was good.",MvIpsuxxJ302p_sDJFckYw,2,2,4,IilDb4hDoS59i0eICjOK5A

First, the decor and environment are very enjoyable. Very interesting decorations, good music (not too loud), and comfortable seats. 

Second, the food was fantastic. We had: Chicken Croquettes, Fois Gras Cotton Candy, Tuna Tartar, Jose's Tacos, Oysters, Brussel sprouts, Veal Chop, Skirt Steak, Delmonico potatoes, and Robuchon potatoes. If it sounds like a lot of food, thats because it was. But everything was amazing. I left the restaurant full and happy. The skirt steak was the most tender steak I have ever eaten.

Third (and probably most important); the service. The service was incredible. Our server Tony has a passion for what he does, and it shows. I have been to great restaurants that I hated because the service was terrible or the server was grumpy. In a nice restaurant, service can make or break the experience, and in this case, the service definitely MADE the experience. The manager Hien was fantastic. He repeatedly checked on us to make sure everything was to our liking. You can see the employees here pay attention to the details, which makes this place well worth every penny spent. 

I highly recommend!",Cm5cgV7lB7C17SwwPifGKQ,0,0,5,KSgU5Vd5hEeqwBt1ZMb43g

Location: inside the casino of SLS hotel (final stop on the monorail), easy to find.

Ambience: clean, new, comfortable, classy environment.  Nice dining room and very elegant bar areas with adequate number of smaller tables and booths and lounge chairs about.

Food: 2 of us ordered the cheapest $125 tasting menu and it was fantastic.
Giant pork-skin Chicharron: the best I ever had, it came out freshly prepared and you can still hear the pork skin crackling in the serving container!  Flavor was just right and not overly salty.  I especially love the light and fluffy Greek yogurt that came with it for dipping.
Bagels & lox cone: very artistic and yummy, I love anything that's lox, salmon roe and cream cheese.  When they combined all 3 together the flavor was just intense, culinary orgasm perhaps:)
Olives: there were 2 types: the traditional Gordal olives stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy was good, but the liquid green olive was interesting in a good way.  The texture was almost like a mini egg yolk, was that the inside of an olive? 
Beef Tenderloin: even though it's not the best cut of meat, it was the best beef tenderloin I ever had!  Perfectly sliced into 5 portions, the outside was slightly charred and medium salty, inside was medium rare, juicy and I could taste the flavor of good aged beef.  This tells me the chef and the staff went to great length to prepare, cook and served the meat properly.  Kudos!!  
Croquetas de pollo: it was good, piping hot, tasty and creamy inside, served in a sneaker-like container
The classic tartare: after all the pleasant surprises that came before it, it was a let down, nothing special, served in cold house rolls
Lucia's salad: Caesar salad served on a big lettuce leaf, it was ok
Grilled asparagus: it was ok
Robuchon potatoes: it was wonderful, lots of butter so beware
Desserts: wonderful

Service: it was a Friday night, there were no tables available so we set at one of the smaller tables near the bar area.  The servers were pleasant and attentive to our needs.

Price: we did not order any drinks, so it was $135.31 each including tax (for the $125 tasting menu), excluding tips. 

Conclusion: Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres at SLS lived up to its billing.  Would definitely return, perhaps will try the $185 or even the $275 menu next time.",CMOZ8rx9ZUOt2L5sv5cGlg,0,0,4,FNmX--EoOLuc5H-s9xoYuQ

Had both a ribeye and skirt steak here, and they were perfectly cooked.  Although it took over an hour for the ribeye.  The outside was nicely charred without being burnt, and the inside was a perfect medium rare.

The best appetizer and side here for me is hands down the fresh tomato and bread.  

The worst side you can order here is the ""cauliflower steak.""  It tastes nothing like steak at all, but mushy cauliflower.

The wine list is also pretty good here, about 2x-2.5x retail prices.  Do the Spanish wines, as you are in a Spanish inspired restaurant, and they have some terrific bottles.",_UMTGara5YnzRIey3Mva0Q,0,1,5,pgOykOk-8s_Vo-oL8u_LTQ

Freshly cooked pork skin...so hot and fresh you can still here the fat sizzle.  Served with a yogurt dipping sauce on parchment paper and they break up the big chicharron into shareable pieces using a mallet. 5/5

Jamon Croquetas:
Hot breded and fried balls of savory jamon. 4/5

Croquetas de Pollo:
Served in a glass tennis shoe with a shoelace on even. Hot breaded and fried potatoes with chicken inside. 4/5

Caipiranha:
They bring a cart and you watch as liquid nitrogen quickly turns caipiranha into a slushy treat. 4.5/5

Seta Al Ajillo:
A nice side of mushrooms with garlic. I love garlic. 4/5

Robuchon:
Super buttery mashed potatoes similar to Joel Robuchon's, hence, the name. 5/5

Beef Rib Steak:
2lbs of steak that's tender, flavorful and juicy. They already slice it up into strips for you. 4.5/5

We tried a few desserts: Chocolate Dome, Passion Fruit, Mango and Banana Tart, and Cream Puffs (in dark chocolate and olive oil, and chocolate and hazelnut).  It's hard for me to get excited over cream puffs but these were very good.

5320640,2017-06-26,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"I went here hoping to get the Bazaar Meat experience, knowing full well the expensive menu that this place has. Personally, the cost wasn't an issue. I expected nothing less from a Jose Andres establishment. However, what I didn't expect was to have the serving staff completely forget to bring out a main course that was part of my prix fixe menu. This was not just for me, but for everyone in our party of 3. We didn't realize this until after we drove home, but by then it was already too late. This is a top-notch, world-renown restaurant with $$$$ price tags. The fact that this happened makes me feel disappointed by the negligence that came from the staff, and also upset that I was shorted out of my meal. 

There's a saying in the hospitality industry that I always honor: Service everyone like they are worth a million bucks, because you never know if that person walking around in ripped jeans, or sweat pants might be the very person that's signing your paycheck. While I'm most definitely not that person, but I still consider myself a potential loyal customer, and a customer that's willing to spend money on something I love to do, which is fine dine. I mean, I get it. I work in the industry too and understand how restaurants operate on the Strip. When it comes to service, certain groups of people will get more attention than others. I'm referring to the VIPS, or big spenders. This is completely fine since it's all part of the ways of this industry, however, that doesn't mean the staff should forget about their regular diners. I bring this point up because throughout the night our server was obviously more focused on the other parties than us. You can tell that these tables were spending big money because the managers would occasionally check up on them, start small talk and refill their wine glasses. We weren't surprised, or were we expecting the managers to come to our table. However, what we didn't expect was the server to come around only a few times throughout the night and whenever he did, he only did so to ask us if we wanted to order more food. Perhaps it's because our tab wasn't as big as he'd hope? We each got the $85 restaurant week menu, some drinks, appetizers and extra entrees. The bill was $145 per person before tip. While I know this is on the low end for Bazaar Meat standards, but it was our first time dining here and we didn't come hungry. We were expecting to just sample the tasting menu to see what options we had for the future. Regardless of the amount, we were still paying customers. The least the server could do was pay attention to our dishes to make sure that we received them all. After all, isn't that the key part of being a server, let alone a fine dining one? Honestly, I don't think I""ll be coming back to Bazaar Meat because the whole experience was a let down. 

Food Review
Some dishes were a hit. Some were a miss, but one thing's for sure, Bazaar's meat quality exceeds its reputation:
 
Cotton Candy Foie Gras: 1 bite-size piece of cotton candy displayed on a stick. Very unique. It's sweet then savory from the foie gras in the center. Definitely recommend. 

Pork Skin Chicharron: Crispy pork skin dipped with Greek yogurt. Comes out in a gigantic piece that the runner breaks in front of you w/ a mallet. Very interesting concept but lacking in flavor. All you could taste was Greek yogurt w/ a dash of cinnamon/cumin flavor.

Gazpacho Shots: Thick and creamy. Tasted exactly like Thousand Island. Our least favorite. 

Butifarra Spiral Sausage: Missing course

Skirt Steak, Rosewood Wagyu, TX: For skirt steak, it was very tender and had good temp. The rosemary mustard sauce was subtle and provided a good kick to the steak, and it wasn't overwhelming at all. I'd give it a 4/5 stars.

Buttered Potato Puree: Potatoes with massive amounts of butter. It melts in your mouth. Definitely worth ordering but it should be shared b/c it's extremely rich. 

Setas al Ajillo: Button mushrooms grilled with garlic and some type of sauce. This was our favorite course. Extremely fragrant, slightly sweet and savory. Definitely recommend. 

Croquetas de Jamon: Cured ham balls, crispy on the outside with creamy bechamel fillings. Came out inside of a plastic shoe. The smokey flavor of the ham was delicious, but it's also very salty. 

Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega Octopus: Delicious chunks of fresh octopus in a tart tomato sauce. Best parts are the baby potatoes. They were slightly sweet and added a good balance to the dish.

Veal Chop: The veal was beyond tender and fragrant. Perfectly seasoned. However, I didn't like the sauce that it accompanied. It had a gamey taste (goat cheese, maybe?) and that overpowered the taste of the meat. 

Don't be a Lemon Cocktail: Super cool presentation cocktail. The staff mixed it in front of you using liquid nitrogen. It came in a tiny mason type jar, and ""eaten"" like a tart slush. It was very good and extremely alcoholic. Definitely worth the price.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,3,1,2,hYLFZU7fIgd3iYXkuRfvjA
5328599,2016-06-12,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Myself and three others went to Bazaar Meat on Friday, June 10th, 2016.  We had a reservation.  

THIS WAS THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE

I will simply list out the facts.

We arrived on time for the reservation, they said they could not seat us yet.  They had us go to the bar and have some drinks while we wait.  The bar was sticky, tacky, and disgusting.  The bartenders were disorganized, rude, and gave us a general sense that our being there was a burden to them.  I ordered a single shot of Blanton's Bourbon, I did not receive 2oz, yet was charged $28 (!!!!) for the weak, half finger pour of too warm liquor in the wrong type of glass (which stuck to the disgusting bar).  My colleague ordered a mixed drink that cost about $30... it took them about ten minutes to make what we agreed tasted like a free margarita you would receive at a slot machine from a cocktail waitress.

Then, the hostess came buy and told us our table was ready.  She asked us to close out our bar tab and come meet her.  This is bush league.  It's lazy, and a ploy to maximize cash for the bar instead of transferring the bar tab to the table tab to make it convenient for the customer.  So, I had to close my bar tab... which took about ten minutes due to the lazy and inattentive bar staff.

By the time we sat at our table, we were 20 minutes past my reservation time.  There was no reason for this, as the restaurant was clearly not very crowded.  

When walking us to the table, I got bumped in to and told to move by several members of the waitstaff.  The waitress proceeded to take us to the very back of the restaurant, and shove us in a small back room, in the very back corner at a table with no table cloth.  This table was disgusting.  Denny's level disgusting.  It was sticky, wobbly and shoved back against the exit to the kitchen.  Waitstaff were constantly bumping in to the back of my chair as thy exited the kitchen.  Also, there was some sort of raw bar there... it smelled like rancid fish.  Absolutely gross.

The waitress brought us our menus.  These ridiculous menus are giant pieces of plexiglass with a paper menu inside them.  When I say giant, I mean you couldn't fit them on the table.  Also, they were GROSS.  Covered in fingerprints, just as sticky as the table... disgusting.  I felt I needed to wash my hands after using them, except the bathroom was about 2000 feet away through the gauntlet of rude waitstaff, out the front door, through some empty private gaming room that smelled like someone just took bong rips in it... and it was just as disgusting as the rest of the experience.  

The menu here is ridiculous and complicated and the staff is not able to communicate it.  You order your steaks first, everything is family style, and when my father placed an order for $600 worth of A5 Kobe beef, they didn't even explain to him that it apparently comes out raw and needs to be cooked on hot rocks they bring you.  Which is a fun and neat thing, but the waitstaff should be forthcoming with that information.  The waitress took one order for our first steak, then interrupted us while we were trying to order more stuff, and promptly disappeared for about ten minutes.  At this point we had been in the establishment for about 35 minutes.  All we had was some water... room temp water at that.

When the waitress finally came back, we proceeded to order at least $1600 worth of food and a $400 bottle of wine.  We were starting to think this was a mistake.  The waitress left, and NOTHING for 15 more minutes.  Time in restaurant thus far, at least 50 minutes.  No food, no drinks, just room temp water and a sticky, wobbly table.

Finally, we decided we were going to ask any staff member that would acknowledge us for another table.  Our table was too gross, and the smell from the raw bar in the room was awful.  Finally, the sommelier showed up with our wine bottle.  I stopped him from opening it and asked him (very politely I might add) to see if it was possible to seat us elsewhere.  He rolled his eyes at us, and pointed to another gross table right next to us and said, ""we can maybe put you there...""  Then he just walked away.

Then, we waited for ten more minutes.  The waitress came by, and asked how we were doing.  We were simply sitting there with some water.  We have been in the restaurant for an hour.  We told her we needed to switch tables or we were leaving (again, as politely as possible).  She said she would see what she could do and she left. 

Ten more minutes went by.

Finally, we gave up.  We stood up and started walking out.  Someone who appeared to be a restaurant manager intercepted us and told us another table was being prepared.  I told him that it was too late.  We were in there for over an hour and had nothing but a ruined night.

They also cancelled my reservation on OpenTable to prevent me from reviewing them there.  That is borderline fraud.  Worst restaurant experience of my life.",dA9PjNjOife1fc326TvnZw,2,0,1,Q0mXAAm-roma4z2keRcrng
5332233,2017-06-05,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Worst. Steak. Ever. 

Wow. I love steak. I knew the price tag would be very high but I counted on it being worth it. It was not. I ordered the best ribeye on the menu. They are tiered by size & I suppose quality, according to the server.  
She warned me that it takes 45 minutes to cook. What?! A steak?! Whatever. Okay I still want it. 

Due to the long wait, we ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell. They too were supposed to be the best they offered, kusshis. I usually really like kusshis but these were terrible. They tasted muddy & fishy. I also expected to be served a decent cocktail sauce or mignonette with them, but no. Tasted like it was straight out of a jar and left a bad after taste. The other accompaniment tasted like straight vinegar. I did not complain or say anything. I was just eager for the steak. 

An hour later, the steak arrived along with the sides we ordered, buttery whipped potatoes and brussel sprouts. 

The steak was ordered medium rare and came out looking like a large piece of leather. It was dry, tough and overcooked. 
I did complain at this point. The manger came over and tried to explain the cooking method for the steak. It didn't matter how it was cooked (long, slow smoke) it was terrible. It was hard and dry on the outside and hard rubber inside. I could not even cut it much less chew it! Due to cooking style they could not fix it. 

The potatoes were okay but the brussel sprouts were not. They were undercooked and had a raw taste and crunch. I did not mention this to the manager because I didn't want to complain about everything. 

He did apologize and comp the $65 steak. Have to give him credit for that. 

It was still a very expensive meal for bad oysters, bad brussel sprouts, decent potatoes and wine. Also be aware that the wine list is very expensive, mostly way over $100++ a bottle

The floor itself is fascinating, with multiple open kitchens including a wood grill that filled the room with the pleasant aroma of grill smoke. There's a butcher case with available meats on display, including the certification for their Kobe beef. It's a unique ambiance that sets the stage for the food itself. 

We ordered a mix of dishes, including the charred octopus, rack of lamb, and salmon tartare, and they didn't disappoint. The tartare, served with nori crackers, was rich and flavorful. The octopus was the highlight of the meal, wonderfully tender with a perfect char and served with a crazy aoli that tied the dish together. The lamb was tender, juicy, and rare, with just a hint of mint. 

I have to mention the sides too, which were exquisite. The robuchon potatoes were absolutely decadent, with an unbelievably creamy texture and enough butter to make Paula Dean weep. The asparagus and romesco was flavorful and grilled to perfection, and the button mushrooms were dripping with garlic and lemon. 

Our server Eric was on point all night, checking up on us frequently and willing to take time to explain the menu and run through every dessert (including an amazing casis marshmalllw).

The restaurant is beautiful, so many different things to look at, watching the food being prepared, of course people watching. For the most part the staff was friendly and accommodating, maybe a bit too stuffy for such a fun restaurant.
We both had a bourbon we had never tried while we perused the menu and made our choices. 
We're both huge steak fans and the scent of charred steak permeated the air, so we agreed to share a Rib eye from Rosewood Texas, recommended by our server.  We shared the Classic Tartare to start, it was good but I've had better and I think I prefer it with toast as opposed to the soft rolls they served it with, it's that texture thing that would've helped. We eventually got our steak, oh baby! Again it was good, but I've had better, actually at a few places, if you have meat in your name, you better serve the best meat I've ever had! 
We shared some sides of Catalan Spinach which I loved...the flavor combos were perfect! Then we couldn't pass up the Robuchon potatoes that are described as butter, butter, more butter and some potatoes. So smooth and creamy, the first few bites are extraordinary you don't want to stop eating them but then you feel that your mouth is just coated in butter and no matter what you eat, it can not be cleansed. Ick! I craved something like lemon sorbet but alas nothing even close to it on the menu, so we got Ten Little Pieces Dessert to share and take some home for later. They were tasty morsels, just nothing to rave about.

we had the lindsay ranch ribeye, the kobe steak, the peanut fed ham, the classic tartar, patatas bravas and the mushrooms! 

soo.. lets break down what we ate...

lindsay ranch ribeye: we thought hey! in vegas right? lets get the best one! the flavor of the beef was good but the chew... my jaw still hurts form the constant chewing that went down...

kobe: do i need to say anything... delish! soft and melts in your mouth! then on top of that we got a certificate with a nose print of the black kobe cow... poor cow! but still yummy in my tummy!

peanut fed ham: you could taste the peanut... we really wanted the bellota but we took the cheap route but it was a good substitute!!

the classic tartar:  yummmmm!! that tartar was goood! table side presentation! big portion! 

patatas bravas: crispy but soft on the inside! 6 pieces of potato... 

mushrooms: were roasted with olive oil, garlic and parsley.... they  worked well with the rich beef taste!!",MVRaXPXr92vF_EJbdxeZLA,2,1,3,IPjTCedvOlpvcrlCGHy4TA

We had quite a memorable experience enjoying some of the world's great delicacies at Bazaar Meats. There's just too much to recognize to be concise with this review, but if you are only reading the first paragraph of reviews, love meat, and on the fence about coming here, then I'll list three items that might draw you in: Kobe beef, Jamón Ibérico de Bellota, and suckling pig.

These were three meats that were the highlights of the $275 tasting menu. Not saying the other 12 plates were chopped liver, these three were on another level. They're served they way I like because they don't need sauces and they don't need extravagant presentations. The flavors are unique, rich, and decadent and are to be savored in the the least complicated form.

Your carnivorous experience starts even before you enter the restaurant as you take in the aroma of smoke and cooking meat when you approach the entrance. Visually, if you are not in the mood, the decor in this sleek dining area will get you there in the first few steps upon entering. From the blood drop lighting in the bar, the displays of hanging pork, to a large reptilian type head with razor sharp teeth, whatever meat eating primal instincts you have will be brought to the forefront.

After a Jameson neat to warm up the engine, our group of four was sat at the end of one of the long communal tables directly in front of the open kitchens. Chris warmly greeted us with smiles to begin our journey. We could not have been more pleased with Chris as he was our tour guide directing us each step of the way, explaining the small plate/sharing concept with food coming from six different open kitchens (fire pit, hot plates, meat bar, seafood, salads, and dessert) which he forewarned us that this can present difficulty in the timing of delivery. Chris also did an excellent job at finding us two bottles of Spanish wine to pair with our food which helped put the meal over the top.

As for the meats: 

A5 KOBE TENDERLOIN, HYOGO PREFECTURE, JAPAN: The word Kobe gets thrown around way too much when describing Japanese wagyu. If someone tells you that they are serving you Kobe in Vegas and you are not at Bazaar, Prime, or SW, then look up your butt, because someone blew some smoke up it. Kobe has the strictest standards of quality and marbling. The Tajima cows (which are a strain of the Japanese Black Wagyu) must be born and raised in the Hyogo Prefecture and must adhere to a weight standard before slaughtered. A restaurant (as of our visit, only three in Vegas) must be certified to buy and sell the beef by displaying a bronze statuette. The tenderloin we sampled was the fattiest piece of tenderloin I've had. Don't attempt to order this beef more than medium rare as the fat has a low melting point and higher temperatures will just render the tasty fat out. As for the flavor, juicy and rich, with the fat melting in your mouth as you eat it. The texture is very soft as you won't have to bite through tough musculature because these cows have been fattened through traditional feeding techniques since birth.

JAMÓN IBÉRICO DE BELLOTA: This is the upper echelon of Iberian ham and of cured meat period. This meat comes from the black footed pig that is free ranging in Spain and only fed acorns. The meat is cured for two years before it reaches the restaurant. Sliced paper thin, the salted meat has a sweetness with a nutty, earthy flavor that the acorns impart. The flavor of the ham is savory on its own with no accoutrements needed.

SUCKLING PIG: The 'heart and soul' of Bazaar Meat. The pig is cooked in the wood burning grill. Being Filipino, I'm very famaliar with lechon. This lechon is on another level with the contrast of super crispy skin and rich, tender pork. This meat is so rich, that mixta salad is the perfect accompaniment to cut through this richness. We had majority agreement that this was the most flavorful meat of the night.

Take a look at the photo of the menu and of the other photos if you want to see the other great plates we sampled. The bison carpaccio and the beef tartare deserve honorable mention of the rest of the menu. Also worth mentioning is that if the dessert factor is high when you assess a meal, then you might be disappointed. All desserts were minute samples and difficult to share among four people leaving you with pretty much a tip of the spoon portion. The desserts had no effect on my rating and I would have been just as happy and satisfied without them. I'll take a snifter Remy Martin VSOP for my finale.

To call Bazaar Meats a steakhouse is not accurate, Chef Andrés would prefer it be a called a meathouse. I would come here with an open mind to try some of the different meats that are all served in uncomplicated presentations. There's also no doubt that you should expect to pay top dollar for your experience, but worth every cent in my book.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,5,4,5,N9aYQpud4ujhnKmsnPCqLQ

5458420,2018-06-19,1,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Just thought I would go ahead and warn people before restaurant week, since I went here for the first time during restaurant week last year and it left such a such a bad taste in my mouth. A year later and I'm still pretty triggered. 

Yes the food is great, it better be for the price, but if you are coming during restaurant week be prepared for terrible service. (As far as I know, everyone I know who comes here outside of restaurant week has never had any issues with their service. Unfortunately my experience was totally different.)

Dropped by with two girlfriends who wanted to try it for restaurant week. As soon as my friends and I arrived and said we were here for the restaurant week menu, you could practically see the distaste all over our servers face. I'm guessing he doesn't make as much in tips during these events because it was practically written all over his face. 

Talk about being treated like peasants.

- First off, we did not get all the items that were part of the course. We thought the course was a bit sparse and had to add al la carte items to fill up. Only to find out later (when we double checked the menu) that we did not get all our items. To this day, I am still not sure if this was due to complete neglect on the server's part or a ploy to get us to add al la carte items to bump up the bill. Neither is a good look. 

- Spotting the server was like trying to spot a white rhino in the wild. We were obviously not worth his time. 

- The wait times between courses was ridiculous (5-10 minutes between the time we finished a course till the next course came. Keep in mind the courses are tiny and its a 10+ course meal) Then towards the end, he must of decided he was tired of playing his own game, because he just dropped everything off at once and fled the scene. 

- The server initially spent plenty if time trying to convince us to order one of their regular courses, not the restaurant week/charity course. Which I found hilarious, because it was at this point we should have known everything was about to go downhill. 

All in all, this place might be worth coming to on a normal day, but is only worth it if you don't care much for your dignity during restaurant week. 

I cannot express how distasteful it is to do this during a charity event. It practically screams that the charity doesn't matter and that this is only done for the PR. Here's and idea. If your going to do a charity event to save face/look good and your servers are going to act like pretentious c*nts, make it a higher end charity event. Or better yet, make it a takeout food event. That way us plebeians can have the luxury of trying your food and you don't have to be soiled by our presence.

Luckily one of the girlfriends I was with has a boyfriend who is a manager at one of the Japanese restaurants on the strip. He was able to talk to someone from Bazaar and we were offered a redo. However, at that point the other girlfriend and I were so irritated, neither of us cared to go back. (That's right, even at the prospect at free food from a high end restaurant we could not be tempted to go back. That bad.) Had another close friend offer to take me back since he regularly comes for the suckling pig (and can't rave enough about it.) Nope. Nope nope nope.

So good luck trying this place out this week. May the odds be ever in you favor. 

And to Bazaar, I hope you get your servers to hide their complete distain for this charity event a bit better this year.",b4t9cwSUG4FRamK4G8FTSg,2,0,2,7HbU-lSDq245TTyJZ1GkSw
5461270,2018-03-05,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"Several reasons factor into this rating:
Sat at the bar and the service was very good. Water glass never got more than half empty, but the bartenders were not pushy which is a big no no for me. This place is VERY EXPENSIVE, but I had a rough week and decided to treat myself. Started out with the Tartare Classic. Not sure of the cut of beef but it was incredibly tender with a nice balance of onion, capers & egg yolk. I then had the bone in veal chop, medium rare and button mushrooms with garlic, parley & butter. The veal chop came out nicely presented. The bone was cut off and sat atop the cut veal. My primary complaint was that it came out rare. It also seemed to be a very fatty piece of meat which veal seldom is. The parts I ate were flavored nicely but there was a lot not touched. To Pay $42 for about 10-12 ounces of meat and to not have it cooked to perfection is a bit of a crime. This place has a great reputation and any restaurant will have a dish or tow come out not perfect, but I doubt I will return.",f1qAXAhAzLxlPfRD6kMx7Q,0,0,3,ecR9Y69ax3B1C7kiQKF5Eg

There were six of us at dinner and we ordered a variety of different items to taste (tapas style) then we each ordered an entree.  There are four or five different kitchens in the restaurant each with its own purpose (ie - one only cooks meat, etc).  We started with several orders of Croquestas de Pollo (I have to warn you these are addicting), Gazpacho Shots, and Grilled Asparagus.  This was followed by a Brussel Sprout salad, Beef and Parmesan Grissini, and the Harris Ranch Angus.  Everything was absolutely amazing, there was not one item I didn't love.  My only warning to someone that is going there for the first time is to make sure you are aware the big cuts of steak are priced per pound, not per plate.  If you look at the meat case before you order you will get a sense of how big the pieces of meat are.  They are absolutely huge.  My steak was big enough to feed three hungry adults, so my girlfriend and I shared it and left with about half of it still intact.  I don't go to Vegas often as I used to, but I will be back here next time I am there for sure.  The food is just incredible.",qvJWDOm76NRhqSvAtkCLZw,0,0,5,74wqNhDkME7P7_4lTzllXA

5529690,2018-04-16,65,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"With Bazaar Meat's future in doubt following Alex Meruelo's recent purchase of SLS, a proper meal there was an absolute must for me.  Saturated fat and cholesterol be damned, it was time to feast hard, which meant starting with meat, followed by more meat and then ending with meat. 

Vegetarians should stop reading.  This got ugly quick.

The ""Classic"" steak tartare startartared the evening right with beef sirloin, Savora mustard, egg yolk, HP Sauce, and anchovy mixed tableside.  Perfectly chunky with a medium spicy kick, this went smashingly with the buttery, pillow-like Parker House rolls as kind of like sliders for high rollers.  

We then went straight into the ""Chef's Selection of Cured Meats"" headlined by the fantastic ""Jamón Ibérico de Bellota"" hand-cut from the famous black-footed acorn-fed, free-range, Spanish pig I've enjoyed a time or 12 at Jaleo at Cosmopolitan.  Other standouts were the mortadella, the interestingly textured, nutty wild boar sausage and the minimal chew required, melt in my freakin mouth Curemaster's Reserve Mangalitsa Ham.  We ordered additional bread to go with it and the ""Pà Amb Tomàquet"", Catalan-style toasted pan de cristal with fresh tomato rounded things out well. 

Things escalated with ""Vaca Vieja"", a 6 oz ribeye originating from hand-selected eight-year-old working cows from Petaluma, CA (Mindful Meats).  The menu described the flavor as mature with a more pronounced flavor.  It was amusingly beefier and tenderly leaner than a standard ribeye.  

That was a great prelude to the muthafuckin A5 Kobe ""Eye of the Rib"" from Hyogo Prefecture.  With only a handful of restaurants in LV certified to serve Kobe beef from actual Kobe, Japan unlike 99% of the pretenders out there, they take it pretty damn seriously with the official certificates and plaques proudly displayed at the entrance detailing process and care of the cow and how it's from the original strand of Kobe cow.  

3 slices weighing in at 2 oz for $100?  Out.Fucking.Standing.  Having enjoyed Kagoshima A5 twice this year, what sets Kobe apart is the tenderness and better fat distribution.  The staff took it even further while cooking the beef tableside by bringing a bonsai tree to the table (are we supposed to imagine being in Japan?) and giving us fancy wooden chopsticks, which we stole.
   
Dinner could have ended for some people, but not when the beastly 2 lb ""Beef Rib Steak"" (Wagyu/Black Angus from Rollingwood, TX) arrived.  This medium-rare Spanish style bone-in ribeye was oak-wood fired for an unbelievable crust.  I love huge, thick steaks because each area is like a totally different story.  From the juicy, bloody center slices to the burnt, fatty edges with the short rib-esque medium-well pieces to the goddamn bone itself, which was fucking gold; this was gorgeous beef!  I rate it as one of the very best I've had in Las Vegas.     

We knew not to pass on dessert due to Chef Jose Andres' Willy Wonka-ness and the staff was kind enough to bring out several remarkable treats on the house with the standout being the ""Carmelized Puff Pastry"" with bacon, strawberries and cream.   

""THE Vanilla Ice Cream Experience"", featuring an exceptionally velvety in-house made vanilla ice cream with 3 glasses (aged rum, coffee beans and aged vanilla bean) was so cool though!  The instructions were to sniff/breathe in one of the scents while the ice cream was still in your mouth.  Doing this completely changed the taste in a major way and maybe it was all the gin and tonics I had thrown down or the massive beef high I was on, but this was a highly entertaining way to end an incredible meal.

[Space | Looks] - The restaurant is inside the SLS and towards the back-end of the building and you'll notice cause it get's exponentially darker as you go deeper in. The interior is classy and trendy, super roomy and again, dark.  

[Service] - Great service. Couldn't have asked for anything different. 

[Food | Drinks] - JOSE ANDRES, you've done it again. This is about the 4th or 5th Jose Andres restaurant I've dined with and honestly, I plan to just walk in with full confidence and order with my eyes closed in the next restaurant of his I experience. 

FOOD  // 
[+] Appetizer: Foie Gras Cotton Candy. It's a one-biter and within the ball of sugar yarn, you get a taste of foie gras and the two flavors together are the perfect balance of airy sweetness and rich buttery-ness from the goose liver. 
[+] Appetizer: Ginger Uni with Lemon Soy Air. SO FRESH and just overall so good. And yes, initial thought is ""i'm eating air"", but just think of soy foam with heavy citrus flavor. Somehow that pairs so well with the saltiness of the uni and ginger bits. 
[+] Grilled Lobster with Melted Butter: HANDS DOWN, best lobster I've ever eaten. Nothing more to say than if you love your lobster, this is what you should get. 
[+] 12 ounce Spanish Dry-Aged Steak: Boyfriend loved it and said it was the best steak he's ever tried, so clearly we're very over-impressed here, lol. 

[Recommendations] - Lobster, I saiiid.

We decided on a large ribeye steak to share along with the usuals, oysters , salad, bread and a cured meat selection. We made if a point of letting our server know that our meat couldn't have any red in the center, pink was ok but no red.

All seemed ok until the salad arrived, romaine leafs on ice with ranch dressing. You know when lettuce is old and the ""rust"" arrives. Well 90% of the lettuce had this discoloration on the ends. I pointed this out to our sever who brought over a manager. I simply asked, who ever prepared this, ask them if they'd serve this to their family.  Yes apologies etc ensued and they said they'd remove from the bill.

Waiting for the main coarse the meat...

After a long wait, the meat arrived "" MEDIUM RARE"" yep really red in the center and VERY small, definitely not enough for four adults. Of course, apologies and we'll cook it right this time. Waiting...

Delmonico potatoes arrive, waiter said everything was large and family style. The potatoes were delicious but looked like the cane from an easy bake oven, very small and not enough for one let alone family style.

Meat comes back, cooked a lot better but the wait and disappointment had already taken over. 

The bill arrives and yes the salad was taken off but no other considerations. For a $500 + dinner they should have taken care of us a little better.

5612307,2017-01-09,0,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We chose this restaurant as it is one of only 10 restaurants in the United States that are authorized to sell authentic Kobe beef. Many restaurants may claim to sell Kobe beef, but unless they're one of the 10 listed on the Kobe Beef Association website, it's not actually Kobe! There are extremely high standards that must be met for meat to be sold with the Kobe label - the strictest of all beef in Japan - and only around 5,000 head of Tajima-gyu cattle each year are able to meet these stringent requirements.

Fortunately for us, every aspect of our dining experience at Bazaar Meat was just as fantastic and high quality as the Kobe beef they sell!

The appetizers are tapas-style and served in smaller portions, so we were able to enjoy a range of flavors without worrying about ordering too large of a quantity of any single dish. 

We started our meal with one piece each of the foie gras, wrapped in a fluffy white cloud of cotton candy, served ice cold. While very good, there's a momentary shock as the cotton candy begins to melt and your brain tries to reconcile the flavor of the ice cold block of foie gras inside! If you enjoy foie gras it's not to be passed up, and the $8 price seems reasonable for such a unique taste.

Next, we shared the beef and parmesan grissini, which had a generous portion of thinly sliced Washugyu carpaccio wrapped around grissini (a type of Italian bread stick) and served with a bowl of espuma and caramelized onion purée to dip in. The Washugyu carpaccio was very tender and buttery, and practically melted in my mouth. The flavors of the beef worked very well with the espuma and purée, and while $26 for this appetizer might seem a bit high, you get five bread sticks with a very generous portion of the Washugyu beef. I thought this was well worth the price, and highly recommend it if you have even the slightest interest in carpaccio (or, especially, if you've never tried it) - you won't regret it.

Though I don't enjoy caviar, my husband does, so he ordered the flight of rainbow trout, salmon, and flying fish roe. For $45, you get a 2 ounce portion of caviar served on a glass waterfall that includes all the trimmings: egg whites, egg yolks, shallots, chives, capers, and a tube of crème fraîche. He said the caviar was quite good - much better quality roe than you might be used to if you're familiar with it from sushi. It came with a pomme soufflé that was very buttery and crispy, almost like a very puffy potato chip, and we had to get another basket of them because I kept eating his!

For our last appetizer, we got the reuben, served on air bread. Neither of us had ever tasted air bread before, and it really does live up to the name, as it's so light as to be almost ethereal. While the flavor was excellent, we probably wouldn't order it again as the portion size you get for $12 is little more than two rather small bites, and $8 would seem a more appropriate price. It's a minor quibble at best, and I don't regret trying it if only for the unique air bread it was served on.

I ordered the Romaine on ice salad, that featured whole leaves of Romaine lettuce standing upright in a large bucket of ice, served with miniature radishes and a side of ranch dressing. When it came to the table we both stared at it for a minute or two in confusion as there was no plate or knife to cut the lettuce with - until we realized that you're supposed to eat it as a  finger food and dip it into the ranch dressing! The ranch was quite good, not your standard mass-produced dressing, and the portion size was just right for $15.

I initially chose the Wagyu/Black Angus beef rib steak, but the staff were very on point when they suggested that it would be much too large of a steak for me, as you don't order a specific weight of meat and the steak averages about two pounds. They instead recommended the grass-fed Angus bone-in strip loin from Strauss Farm, cooked medium rare. I was quite happy with their choice, as it was VERY tender, expertly seasoned, and cooked perfectly medium rare.

The star of the dinner, and the reason we came, was my husband's six ounce A5 Kobe Beef Eye of the Rib steak. Words are simply inadequate to describe how good this steak is, and it more than lived up to its reputation as the best beef in the world. The steak is cooked tabledside (by a specially trained chef) on a Ishiyaki grilling stone, who explained that he would cook it in two portions so it didn't get cold. The stone is greased with a cube of fat rendered from the same cow as the steak and brushed with a fresh wasabi and soy glaze. We tried it rare for the first portion, and medium rare for the second. The beef was so tender and well marbled that it melts in your mouth, and the taste and texture were phenomenal in every way. For $50 an ounce, it was worth every penny, and came with a certificate verifying its authenticity.

Including wine and tip, we paid $900 for our meal and enjoyed every part of our experience!",EI9KXua8lVbiHvCE32qzEQ,4,0,5,aHMbqE6C0ySr3GqhSrOm9g

      What not to love about Award-winning chef José Andrés combines traditional Spanish flavors with cutting edge culinary techniques in Bazaar Meat at the SLS hotel recently opens on AUG 28, 2014 in Las Vegas. 

       It's inside the SLS hotel, so a bit of 10 minutes cab drive off the strip. It's worth the drive! I guarantee it!

       Dinners include everything about meats and a whole lot more from Mediterranean mussels to sea urchin, seared quail, farm chicken and oxtail. For dessert, enjoy delights like dark chocolate lollipops, bonbons, ice creams and sorbets.

      Bazzar Meat by José Andrés also features a creative cocktail selection with the well-known Bar Manager Hien Truong (former opening Hakkasan Las Vegas, Rose. Rabbit. Lie), with drinks like the Smoke on the Water, made with blackberries, atomized scotch, islay mist and flame and many cocktails are served table-side to show you a spectacular show of craftsmanship, only for those who truly appreciate it. 

      Bazaar Meat is designed by the famous architecture/designer Philippe Starck (Mondrian, Paramount, Hudson hotels in NYC, LA, Chicago, and Delano Miami South Beach) and features two private dining rooms. The restaurant is spacious, probably 1 of the bigger restaurant that I've seen in Las Vegas, beautifully designed, warm, inviting, and quite intimate with the open kitchen, open flame grill when you first walk it. 

      I also love the communal table can hold up to 30 people, I got to sit there ;-) This can hold up your BDAY or a bachelorette party! Great idea for group dinner at the upcoming CES 2015.

      While chef José Andrés bears the name, Chef De Cuisine David Thomas is the man in charge the kitchen and GM Yassine Lyoubi offers an impeccable service from the moment we arrived till we left. 

The food:

- José's Asian Taco - Jamón ibérico de bellota, toasted nori, flying fish roe - who would have thought, they go so well together?

- Cotton Candy Foie Gras Crispy amaranth - a MUST TRY

- Sea Urchin - Soy, wasabi, pickled ginger, lemon

- Bagels & Lox Cone - Dill cream cheese, salmon roe

- Jamón Ibérico de Bellota* (Fermín, Salamanca, Spain) Hand-cut from the famous black-footed Spanish pig, acorn-fed, free-range

- Wagyu Beef Cheeks Mojo rojo, oranges

- Grilled Baby Corn Mayonnaise, chile piquin, popcorn powder

- Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega Galician style octopus, potato, pimentón

- Wagyu steak by 3 OZ minium order, prepared to perfection 

- The sausage for days.... 

    Everything was delicious, out of this world with an impressive creation of many dishes that I've never seen before. So if you come here, please leave your 'narrow-minded' and 'traditional steakhouse mind' at home. It's Vegas, so go wild baby! You are surely in for a real treat! 

    I can't wait to bring my parents back here soon! This is probably 1 of the most exciting restaurants recently opening in Las Vegas in 2014.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,11,8,5,ed6GTBbbhWYHpY7Ekywi8w

I don't eat pork, but I will take their word that this was the best pork they ever had. I'm sure glad they liked it because it was $160 for a 1/4 suckling pig from Spain. We also tried the wagyu rib of eye ($160) and the wagyu from Rosewood, TX ($206). Both were good, but not amazing. The highlight of the evening had to be the mashed potatoes - wow can you say butter? Yum! Surprisingly, the sloppy joe was the best sloppy joe I've ever had! The meat was tasty and the bread was perfectly crispy and buttery. My friends fell in love with the cotton candy foie gras and ordered a 2nd round. I wasn't a fan of the cotton candy but the foie gras itself was a bite of buttery perfection. We also had the geoduck, the king crab cocktail, brussels sprouts and asparagus. Nothing really stood out.

First off, the decor is really cool. It's not really matching, but there are similar elements that carry on throughout. The kitchen is open so you can see not only the cuts of meat you're getting, but you can also watch them prepare and cook it. It's really neat!

We had cocktails to start, then split a bottle of wine between the 4 of us (based off our server's recommendations once we picked the entree). Our meal was intense. So, they recommended ordering our main course first as it takes 45-60 minutes to cook the meat. We did that, then we started with cotton candy foie gras and this weird olive dish. Not going to lie, the cotton candy foie gras was my least favorite part of the meal. The olive dish was pretty cool. It came with a tin of olives, stuffed with something amazing, and these weird bubbles of olive juice. The olives were so good! And the little bubbles of juice kind of burst in your mouth. Don't order this if you're not into olives, cause it's very olive-y. So then we got one of the beef carpaccio's (the one that comes with parmesan) and the classic beef tartare. I could have skipped the tartare, but I could honestly go back just for the carpaccio. It was so freaking good. For the main course, we got the Lindsey Ranch beef rib steak, cooked to chef's preference. We got grilled baby corn, cauliflower steak, and the super butter, butter, butter potatoes. Everything was to share, so we got to try it all. All of it was amazing. For dessert, they brought out this little platter of deliciousness. 

This was easily one of the best meal experiences I've had since moving to Vegas. The service was great, the food was great, the decor is neat... It was just really fun! Not cheap though.",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,2,1,5,1IIlRC5-esAiUtTg0kiuMw

Also had the king crab & shrimp cocktail and A5 Kobe, which you have to try as rare as possible to enjoy the flavor.

We ordered the server's recommended cut of steak as a main course, which is cooked over the spitfire. For me, even as medium rare, it was a little dried but I guess that's a preference. I would not order the steak again and would stick to the other dishes. Only thing we ordered that we didn't care for at all was the Brussels sprouts served with a lemon foam. Yuck!

I preordered the quarter Suckling pig ($140)  which was about 1.5 lb cooked in Spanish style and roasted in the charcoal/brick oven. Usually, it would take about an 1hour for the dish to be prepared. The waiter presented the quarter portion uncut for presentation, then it was brought to the back to be cut in smaller pieces. Part of the pig was quite fatty, but there were leaner parts which was sooo tender. The smoky flavor and the tenderness of the meat was awesome! Forget the kalua pig, this is wayyy better. Depending which part you consume, some parts of the skin was very crispy and otherwise was bit soft. 

The Spanish style ribeye was worth it. We ordered the Mishima black wagyu which was $65/lb. Generally the minimum weigh of most steak is about 2lb and you can actually pick your own cut by the butcher's table.  It was done medium rare with a smoky and toasty flavor. It was one of the better steaks. By the way, the spanish style rib eye would take about 1 hour to prepare. 

We ordered the usual: classic beef tartare and cotton candy foie gras. 

Dessert was quite interesting. We ordered the homemade ice cream ($16) which was vanilla. It was presented with 3 wine glass (each had vanilla bean, brandy, and coffee bean). EVery time you take a bite of the ice cream, then you sniff the wine glass with goodies. Eventually every time you take a bite of the ice cream, the taste of ice cream will change.

The decor is a bit odd, an odd melange of hunting lodge, mardi gras, and up scale steakhouse - but whatever, that's not what you are there for and most importantly the seating is super comfortable and spaced out so you are not on top of other people.

Couple Mezcal negronis to start ($16 a piece) were excellent - simple drink but for some reason quality can vary.  As for food, got a dozen oysters which were great but for $48 not sure the value is so great.  For the main event, got the 'rosewood' which was a 2 lb wagyu rib-eye from Texas and my god is was incredible (I drooled on keyboard typing this....) - for a high end steak of this quality, $200 is totally reasonable.  For the side, got roasted leeks and they really squeezed out all the flavor and texture for what I can consider and otherwise bland vegetable.  All of this goodness was pared with the 2004 Tondonia, recommended by the verbose, yet friendly sommelier.

Since the food here is tapas style, I ordered a number of dishes including oysters, gazpacho shot, croquetas de jamon, cotton candy foie gras, ""beefsteak"" tomato, and the suckling pig sandwich pair with their house sauvignon blanc wine. 

The oysters were from British Columbia. They were really tiny, but were really good. The gazpacho shot (composed of green peppers, tomato, and green pepper) was refreshing to the palette. The croquetas de jamon were served in a plastic molded shoe. It was actually a really nice presentation, although I'd never eat from a real shoe. 

I am an avid fan of foie gras. When the cotton candy foie gras was brought to my table, I basically ate the exterior of the cotton candy until I reached the center of the cotton candy which housed the tiny piece of foie gras. At first, I thought it was an odd combination to have cotton candy, but it works as a food pairing that complement each other in the sweetest way.

Towards the end of my meal, I ate their ""beefsteak"" tomato which is ironically a vegetable tartare. After taking a bite out of the beefsteak tomato, I realized that I should have chosen a dish that was more substantial in protein like real steak.

That is why, when I came to Vegas recently and started hearing good things about Bazzar meat, I didn't have the highest hopes.

I was staying at the SLS though, so figured I might as well give it a shot.

The first dish came, the foiette. It was okay. 

Then the grilled octopus, which was delicious. One look at our dish and our neighbors proceeded to add it to their order too.

Next the Bison Buffalo Style, which was a lot of fun to DIY and innovatively tasty.

Then came the Waygu skirt steak. I was expecting a tiny piece of meat, but it was actually reasonably sized. The meat just melts in your mouth yet doesn't feel super fatty. One of the best steaks I've ever had, and without breaking the wallet!

Oh yes and the white truffle honey drink is really good! Sweet and truffly and bubbly, but not syrupy or artificial tasting.

And the dessert tarts are all delicious too. 

And the decor there is really cool, hanging whole pigs included.

I'm getting hungry writing this. Moral of the story, come to Bazaar Meat! It IS still fancy and artsy fartsy like its Los Angeles counterpart, but has way more substance when it comes to the food.",W6iqpnFvnKUtQGY4kfHOaw,1,1,5,QdfW1IsRB6BpwjLVwnh-wA

The hostess was very nice and said that if we wanted to have a drink at the bar, she would try to sneak us into a table.  I was eating with my coworker, Mr. Riches.  Luckily, because itwas just two of us, she was able to get us a seat after about 20 minutes.

We ordered a handful of items between the two of us.  Mr. Riches and myself started with the foie gras wrapped in cotton candy.  It was outrageously amazing.  Other highlights included the rib eye, the tartar, and the braised lamb neck.  We originally did order the suckling pig, but after about an hour, our waiter told us that they were out of it.  At first we were quite upset, but they did make up for it by bringing some croquettes, and cauliflower steak for free.  In addition, in the middle of the course, the waiter made some rum sorbet with liquid nitrogen that was just outrageous.  I don't think that this is normally free, but it was just a great surprise.

In the middle of dinner, I also looked behind me, and saw that Mr. Jose Andres was sitting there himself eating.  I looked at what he was having, and it was suckling Pig!!!  I joked that Jose took the last of the suckling pig.  The waiter assured me that he didn't, but I still bet he did :-).  Regardless, I felt as though the restaurant made up for it, and it will be a reason to return.  I do wish that Jose made his round around the tables so I could have gotten a picture.  Instead, he just quietly sneaked in and sneaked out.

The bar bill was likely right about $200............with that, i would assume that a NICE dinner for 5 (higher end) would run about $70-$80 per head (after all, how much can you eat)............wrong.
My bill was $998.  We did not eat the finest meat, we had the mid range meat.  We did not order a whole pig, we ordered 1/4 pig and we did not order lobster for everyone.  We shared three vege side dishes and 2 potato side dishes........

the food was excellent, the ambiance was inviting, service was ""ok""........but the pricing at the end of the day is more than i can stand to pay.  you will see if you look at my profile that i eat at some decent, pricey places and don't mind paying for such.........but at some point I have to ask about value for the dollar. 

If you want a show and price is no object, you will enjoy JOse.

We took the semi-private room in the back which was great for us to converse without loud back noise. We started with the cotton candy foie gras which seems odd but had a great taste and was a nice way to start this four hour dinner.  Table side wagyu tartare, Carpaccio and the Charcuterie platter.   The tartare was served with little dinner rolls in a cast iron tray and this was one of my favorite flavors of the night.  We sampled four steaks, the pork chop, and few orders of lamb chops.  Sadly not one had a memorable taste nor impressed me.  Side we had asparagus, spinach, brussels, their version of the ""best whipped potato"".  Worst whipped potato I've ever had.  I'm a full blown fat kid, I love butter and fatty flavors, this was like eating a stick of extra salty butter.  Not one of us enjoyed this and honestly maybe we picked the wrong sides to accompany our main course.  NOW let's move on to the dessert and the wine!

I'm serious.  I have been blessed to dine at all the best restaurants in the city--Le Cirque, Le Monde de Joël Robuchon, Picasso, Twist, Guy Savoy to name but a few.  And while they have all been 5 star experiences... and some have even brought tears to my eyes...
none come come close to my time at Bazaar Meat.  

Disclaimer: I am a vegetarian.  My dining companion was not.  
Now, secretly, I love to go to steak house becaue they tend to have the best vegetabes.... but I always feel badly because I know that I will not be spending like the steak eaters.  The staff were not only accommodating, but almost excited to show me how well they could do for me.

Firstly, the hostess was lovely.
We started at the bar.  The bartenders were kind, not over bearing, super polite to allow me time to decide from their cocktail selection and even asked my friend if he would like to wait for me (he did, and he was happy that he was asked), and made an exquisite NY Sour.
Then we made it to our table.  Essentially, we gave the manager and servers our dietary preferences and trusted them to make our night.  OMG DO THIS.

We selected the Silver Oak Cabernet, and the sommelier was prompt and... well.... just seemed to have a wonderful soul.  Not pretentious.  Just happiness exuding.  

The gazpacho shots were perfection. The best gazpacho I may have ever had.
The amuse bouche was gorgeous, artful, and wonderfully kind to have one for my vegetarian self as well.  
I had the tomato tar tar, which was just gorgeous.  My friend had a beef tar  tar which was prepared table side and really made the moment feel special. 
The tomato salad was perfect in its simplicity.
And then all the vegetables!  Oh my word.  The roasted cauliflower.  YES! The potato puree.  YES! grilled baby corn?  YES.  ASPARAGUS.  THE BEST I HAVE HAD EVER.  Roasted Carrots over a yogurt sauce.  The night's star for me.  And the roasted peppers in a cast iron dish.  So sweet.  so perfect..  YES YES YES .  my meat-loving friend who rarely recognizes that vegetable exist said that the peppers even beat his steak.  AND HE LOVED THE STEAK.

AND THEN THERE WAS THE DESSERT CART. HOLY COW.  The man who rolled this wonder towards us asked what we would like, but it was just too overwhelming to choose so we asked him to choose for us.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.
I do not remember the exact names of the bite sized moments of wonder, but some standouts were a dark chocolate ganache covered mousse half-sphere with actual gold flecks atop and a little pink cake with perfect layers of fruit and vanilla cake--which sounds dull but was anything but.

I was so full, I forgot to ask for port.

To the servers, to the bussing staff, to the managers, to the hostess and bartenders, to the runner who explained everything perfectly, 
Thank you.  I have not been able to stop talking about this experience.  I will be back many times over.  It wasn't just delicious; it was down right fun.",96kgjM4wWePuZkVcgOhVhQ,5,3,5,1QZ5nmr3zVT1IxCeBZrU4Q

I am a huge fan of Jose Andres and was so looking forward to eating here. It really pains me to only leave 3 stars but that is how we felt about the food, just ok. 

First off, I wish this restaurant was at a different hotel. The SLS is so run down and was practically empty when we came in on a Sunday evening. Bazaar meat is located in the back of the casino and the reception desk is oddly very far back from the entrance. 

We were the first ones to arrive so had our choice of seats in the bar area. I liked the white decor and the blood dripping down from the bar ceiling, very unique. Our server came right over and was very attentive. She explained all the dishes on the bar menu and we had a glass of the house red ($8) which was described as a ""Pinot"". It was awful. The rest of the wines are extremely high priced here, even for a strip restaurant. 

Here is what we ordered: 
Pork skin Chicharron w/ greek yogurt  (2/5)
Kobe beef air bread w/ onion jam and parmesan creme (3/5)
sloppy joe w/ fried potatoes and steamed bun  (2/5)
Grilled pulpo. Galician style octopus (3/5)
Suckling pig sandwich. Crispy skin, carmelized onions, honey mustard (2/5) 
Dark chocolate almond eclair (4/5)

The chicharron was disappointing. Almost completely flavorless without the dipping sauce. I wanted it a little thicker instead of being like air. The kobe beef airbread was good. A super thin slice of meat over the onion jam (which I wish was stronger), filled with a  parmesan creme. The sloppy joe was okay, but nothing great. The octopus was good flavor wise, but cooked completely uneven, Im pretty sure it was just warmed up as some of the pieces were not even warm. I was really underwhelmed with the suckling pig sandwich. The bread was great but the meat lacked any flavor and I had a couple big chunks of fat. Finally, the eclair was a good ending. 

I was hoping to return for dinner in the restaurant but I honestly don't think I will. I had high expectations but the food was just disappointing. I also have no desire to return to SLS. Sorry Jose :(",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,6,3,3,MDh2W4EC6HqKPOlwvNQNNA

1.  cotton candy foie gras (not substantial, but gives you the adventurous flavor you wanted from a Jose Andres spot)
2. croquettes de jamon
3. skirt steak to share
4. vegetable side for the skirt steak, like the mashed potatoes

Should total to about $110 with one drink per person.

Best dishes of the night (in order): 
1/4 Suckling Pig - tender with extra crispy skin. **
Reuben w/ air bread - tastiest appetizer of the night, similar to the philly cheese @ SLS Beverly Hills
Roasted Cauliflower Steak - super delicious, good flavor.
Jamón Ibérico de Bellota - high quality cuts, has a subtle nutty flavor. 
The Classic Beef Sirloin Tartare - made fresh at the table, solid. *
Robouchon Mashed Potatoes - just tastes like butter. *
Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Beef Rib Steak ** - well cooked medium rare. (read details below)

Disappointing:
Cotton Candy Foie Gras - like a lollipop, worth a try if you're a foie lover. 
Smoke and Ice Fresh (raw) Oysters* - tastes exactly like how it sounds. 
Wagyu Beef Cheeks - too gamey and fatty.
Piquillo Peppers - too saucey.
Brussels Sprouts w/ lemon air - just OK.

*The server recommended that we needed two of the mashed potatoes and tartare - total upsell and we had leftovers of both.
**The server told us our meal was ""light"" and that we absolutely 2 quarter lb. suckling pigs and also a steak (that needed to be ordered at the beginning of the meal because it takes 50 minutes to prepare). We reluctantly ordered the steak in addition to our quarter lb. suckling pig... and it was TOO MUCH FOOD. We knew the steak price per lb and were led to believe that 1 order would be a little over a pound. Instead, we got a 3 lb steak when we were already full. Must've been because of the built in 18% service charge/gratuity...

we started out with a few starters - cotton candy foie gras was good but not sure if it lives up to the hype that i've heard about this dish. croquetas de pollo was a fave, good fried crisp and warm inside haha. beef carpaccio on a stick was good and quite light and refreshing actually. my fave starter we ordered was the chicharron. its a pretty large portion and they smash it up for you right on the table. it was light, crisp and really good flavor. for our main entree, we had to try the suckling pig ($140 for a quarter) and it was really good! the crunch on the skin was amazing! the pork was really tender and it was way more than enough food for the 2 of us. we also ordered a potato pancake side dish that was just whatever and probably not needed haha. by the end of the meal we were left really satisfied and full.

service was fairly good for the most part too. i felt like our server was really knowledgeable about the menu and he gave us some great recommendations, but toward the end of the meal, service stalled a bit. we had to wait quite a bit for our main entree and couldnt seem to find anyone to get us our bill for a while. other than that glitch, this was a really nice special occasion dinner.",HO35wso-psqx0GF--QSwGA,2,2,4,Kptdvqs3auaTqNJ-ol-KpQ
5961899,2016-12-27,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"We had a late reservation at Bazaar Meat for my birthday dinner. I love Bazaar in LA and I was very excited to try out another Jose Andres restaurant. I don't think the concept works as well in a steakhouse format, especially if you're hungry since the meats take up to an hour to cook their way. Also, the huge heavy menu was intimidating to navigate. After finding out the wait time for steak, I hurried to choose one. Since I wasn't paying, I chose the least expensive beef rib steak and the server came to explain that she recommended an ""upgrade"" that was the same price but slightly different. Honestly, I'm not sure what the difference was supposed to be but I went along with what she said. All I know is that both versions are from an older holstein.

With that out of the way, we started with the Foieffle, a soft airy waffle oozing with foie gras mousse. It was tasty and very messy to eat.

We had wanted to try the suckling pig but it's a pre-order only item. The server explained that there is a sandwich version of it available for us to try for $14. It was very good and I'm glad we only had a few pieces of the trimmings in the sandwich because the richness of suckling pig would've been too much for us if we had more.

At this point, the rib eye was brought out on a platter. It was beautiful. I took my photos and eagerly bit into it. It was so disappointing. I had underestimated how tough an older holstein would be. There were parts with sinew that I couldn't cut or chew and had to spit out. There was also a different flavor to it. It's my fault for not asking more questions up front or for trying to save my friend a few bucks but I really did not enjoy this steak at all.

It's a good thing the baby corn side that we ordered to accompany the steak was great.

When we finished the steak, it was really late and I didn't want to order dessert. It was really sweet of the server to bring out a mini white-chocolate raspberry cake with a single candle for my birthday. The experience was fun - don't order the tough meat though.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,3,2,3,vg-5QUKAimJ37bxfny8NGQ
5964386,2018-03-19,2,ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,"My dinner experience at Bazaar Meat is officially the second best meal I've ever had in Las Vegas. 

I had a feeling I was going to go for the tasting menu, and after being handed a very large menu and glancing at the  first section I didn't feel the need to hold up the heavy menu any longer to look further. There was no way I was going to be able to make any sort of decision with so many options that sounded outstanding.

The first course already had me changing my mind about ever trying foie gras. All it took for me to sellout was some cotton candy! Apparently, I'll eat anything if you put some cotton candy around it, but it wasn't the cotton candy that impressed me, that foie gras was delicious! I was ready to go stand in the corner of shame after that foie gras experience, but before I could get up the croquettes and olive course arrived and I was super curious about the ""liquid olive"" which was quite fascinating. I wanted to touch it and poke it, but I behaved myself. The croquette was one of my favorite items of the night!

The next tapa that joined us was a basket of chicharones with a side of yogurt and zaatar. I grew up eating lebneh and zaatar sandwiches so I wished they had been a bit more generous with the zaatar, but I know it's a strong flavor for most.  The next guest that showed up to our dinner party was a butcher block of Jamon. Thing went a bit south here when a male employee in a suit approached our table to check on us and then proceeded to MANSPLAIN to our table what Jamon is. I guess he assumed there was no way our table of 4 women in our 30's had been to Spain or eaten Jamon before (eyeroll).

The flavor packed air bread pastrami sandwich which I loved & the tableside prepared beef tartar with mini slider buns arrived next. The main course was a perfect dry aged rib eye accompanied by the best potato flavored whipped potato pure I've had in my life and a citrusy Brussel sprout salad. The meal concluded with a dessert sampler platter. I kind of wished we would have gotten the experience of the dessert cart visiting us to make our own choices, but then again, we wouldn't have picked such a diverse array of items and that was the whole point of  the tasting menu so in the end it all worked out. 

Overall this place was great. I loved the look and feel of the dinning room and the service we received from everyone, minus the condescending man in the suit, was professional and awesome.",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,1,4,tzDnslOEetkMpXxy7yKdVQ

Came here for Christmas Eve dinner with my family and was definitely not disappointed. We had to push our original 7:00 reservation to 8:00 and then to 9:00 due to traffic coming from LA, which they were completely accommodating of. When we arrived, they were running about half an hour behind (they seemed understaffed), so we started our apps and drinks at a 4-top table at the bar, which was fine.

--Foie gras cotton candy - my brother's favorite / must-have item, which they used to have at Bazaar in LA, prior to the California foie gras ban. I love foie gras, and I love cotton candy, but this item was just too strange for me. It wasn't bad, I just couldn't really wrap my head around what it was or what it was supposed to be.

--Classic tartare - really great herby flavor and high quality meat. Huge portion size for an appetizer. Comes served on a giant heavy marble tiered plate - the waitstaff must have very strong forearms!

--Can't remember what it was called, some kind of octopus - perfectly cooked and not chewy, with a delicious sensation of char that lingers 

--Brussels sprouts - I remember these being good, but don't really remember the details of what it tasted like

--Smoke & ice fresh oysters - SO smoky, strange, and addictively delicious. Kind of confusing - the menu states that it's a ""half dozen..kushi"" oysters. We asked to confirm, and the waiter said they were actually kumamoto oysters that evening, which was fine with us. When the order arrived, there were 5 orders, and we asked ""wasn't it supposed to be a half dozen?"" and he said that's how they come. .. what?

--Braised lamb neck - so tender, so flavorful, so rich, and not at all gamey. You don't even need a knife. 

Our server, Sunday (sp?), was really friendly and helpful. 

This is a really great restaurant and I will definitely be coming back for special occasions and date nights in the future. 

The only few things that will probably prevent me from giving this 5 stars in the future..
1. half a dozen means 6, not 5, so it's really disappointing when something comes out with fewer items than you were expecting. I would probably still pay the same amount for 5 oysters, but if you say half a dozen, serve half a dozen. 
2. a lot of the menu items are borrowed from Jose Andres' other restaurants (and I don't just mean the Bazaar in LA). For example, the croquetas de pollo are also served at Jaleo at the Cosmo. The Pà Amb Tomàquet at Bazaar meat is exactly the same as the Pan de Cristal con Tomate at Jaleo as well. I'm sure if I look more carefully I will find more overlap. The salt air margarita is also found at China Poblano. Though these two particular dishes are, admittedly, two of my go-tos at Jaleo, I think this is just plain lazy!",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,1,2,4,YX_gSqYINeyywZllxhNgHw

The Beef Carpaccio, Cotten Candy Foie Gras and I can't remember what it was called but the succulent pig sandwich was amazing.

The most delicious thing I've probably ever had was the Jose Asian Tacos, served straight from god's serving tray. I was told why the meat was the best there is but I forgot. They're tiny but worth the splurge.

This place is seriously over priced, but goddamn it, the steak I had here will be one I remember every time I have steak in the future, so it probably is worth the price. Go with a group so you can split the entrees and sample more things. The chefs here really know what they're doing. Service was great. I'd say skip the deserts though. They were a miss to me. There are a lot of over-hyped restaurants in Vegas, but Bazaar Meat more than lives up to the hype.",k3fBjEZYCugFaKTHQ4VnSA,0,0,5,eMVUYKu67n9NuylIsR0Caw

I feel in love with the Grissom wagyu beef carpaccio aka beef on a stick lol. It LITERALLY melts like butter in your mouth. The foie gras wrapped w/ cotton candy is perfect you get sweet & a finishing salty taste that goes well together. 
Kobe steak was Delicious, cauliflower steak & Brussel sprouts are you kidding me made just right! Rosemary chicken & buttered potato purée. Please don't forget to try the sulking pig, it's been a wk & I'm still thinking about that dish. Basically if your in Vegas & want a GREAT steak house that is swanky, this is the place.",AJoQELPkyX4S5Esvu3jomg,0,0,5,gDfRibT7pw7kEw7UnWj0OA

I've worked in Food and Beverage for a decade, and admittedly I am with a Jose Andres company at the moment, but I can not recommend this restaurant enough.

The food is spectacularly prepared, appropriately portioned and you can tell the finest attention was paid to every detail, from ingredient sourcing to plating. 

But enough about the food - let's get to the staff.

I have NEVER, I repeat NEVER felt more welcome or at home than I did this evening. Each member of the Bazaar Meat team was hospitable, welcoming, knowledgeable, warm, and just plain welcoming. 

I WILL be back, and I can not stress enough how much you need to get to this restaurant. 11/10, 110/100. Hands down. THANK YOU BM TEAM!",lRuPpKqD8QVuZuUyVK-G6Q,0,0,5,ECxWWMoEkgf5ujWOvcJKlg
