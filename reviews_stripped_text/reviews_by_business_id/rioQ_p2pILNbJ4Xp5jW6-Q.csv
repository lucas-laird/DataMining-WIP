But in the summer, it's hot as balls, so we didnt even want to go there until the sun went down. That leave little to no time until 9! Also, it's smaller than I thought.

My friend suggested this place during a recent trip to Las Vegas and I'm so glad that we checked it out.  There's an eclectic mix of things, ranging from boutique clothes stores to small art galleries.  Apparently, the vendors were selected to participate (i.e., businesses couldn't just sign on), which I think is a smart way to ensure a good ratio of stuff to see and do.

Here's the thing, it is a great concept but I don't understand why it is so popular or such a big deal.  A few small bars, a few small shops and in Vegas everything is living large so no clue why this is so cool.  Maybe just because it's an escape from the ordinary?

Being from Vancouver, BC, one of the things I hate about Vegas (and the USA in general) is the blatant lack of recycling. Container Park is built around the premise of reuse and recycle and had the ONLY recycling/compost stands I saw in 8 days of being in Vegas. The shops are nothing to write home about but we did enjoy some drinks from Oak & Ivy and some BBQ from Big Ern's BBQ. Those stops were highlights and it was really nice to get out of the Vegas bustle and be somewhere relatively quiet and enjoy the sunshine. At sundown there's a ceremony to wake up the Preying Mantis out front, complete with flame throwers. You should read the plaque at the Mantis on the how and why it was built (It's still a functioning vehicle!) because it's pretty awesome.

The Trailer Park is an interesting idea but there are some fundamental problems. The stores with their tinted windows and small doors, are not inviting to come in. It was not a very ""invite to shop"" environment. I have big concerns on whether many shops will make it. I don't have any idea how much rent is but the small square footage of the stores will certainly mean that they won't be able to make enough to stay afloat.

From a social ""place to hang out, t Trailer Park is going to be a smash hit. Bars will do great when it warms back up.  It will be a wonderful place for Downtowners to hang out and just ,,, yknow,,, hang out and have conversations about how cool downtown is.

Came here on a Friday night in the summer.

It's very neat to see what the designers were capable of doing with just your average shipping container. Each of the stores, restaurants, and bars had great facades that did not make them look as though it was a container, until you stepped inside. However, even than they were all so well put together you forgot you were even in a shipping container!

We watched three bands play live on the stage.  The music was good, it had us entertained throughout each of the performances (roughly 30 min each).  The grass area right in front was perfect because you got the draft from the fans/misters in each of the four corners of the lawn.  Grab some legos and those blue cushions and build yourself a chair/couch and enjoy the music!

The vibe was very laid back.  There were no kids when we went, all adults.  Everyone was just there to relax and enjoy the music and scenery. They have plenty of chairs, couches, tables etc. for decent sized groups.

I highly recommend the treehouse (yes even if you're an adult) because you can never be too old to go down an awesome slide! Lots of fun!

First thing I noticed on my visit was the giant mantis outside that was breathing fire!! Pretty impressive! Also as it was close to Halloween they had the place decked out with pumpkins, scarecrows and cute photo-op areas.

I felt safe walking into the area as they had security that welcomed me. I was there on a midweek evening; it wasn't busy but there were still people about. 

There are lots of cute little food places, stores and a play park in the middle for kids.  If your visiting the Freemont Street experience its just a short walk from the end of that.

But, honestly, I question the longevity of some of these stores.  There were a ridiculous amount of fashion jewelry stores in the park.  And, many of them were of the quality of a subpar Etsy store.  Sorry, not sorry.

In any case, the praying mantis is outside the Container Park, so there isn't really any need to go inside in my opinion unless you were already planning on going to one of the bars/restaurants.

I did not think that a glass of wine served at Boozer bar (I think it was called) was worth the $12 when the restaurant at the edge of the container park before you walk out was serving the same glass of wine for $5 so I took away a star for that. It was just highway robbery for that cheap wine and if it is sold for $5 at a different restaurant in container park then it should be sold for the same price there as well. It wasn't a fancy bottle for a plastic cup worth $12. 

Anyways, the park itself was amazing! Play ground for kids, people laughing and loving their time. Food everywhere, coffee, ice cream. Perfect spot for a family. I will go to this place over and over again. My second day was in the daylight and I thought it was amazing. Especially after my initial impression from the outside.

Pretty much everything was broken.  Every single slide was closed.  It was a bummer to make a trip to come to this place and have your kids ready to leave after 5 minutes.  Kids were pretty rowdy there so I am sure this is difficult to maintain.  Good concept though.

They do have security there but it seemed like their primary concern was making sure that parents weren't just leaving their kids there.  With all of the casinos steps away some people probably do try to use this place as free babysitting.",2FFdNlmmpnmc03eRHDk5Dg,0,0,2,cg0P56kcWeamzAeZQrXe2Q

Container Park is filled with boutique shops including art, jewelry, gifts, unique clothing, food, fun, and drinks.  The area is relatively small and compact, making it easy to visit every shop in one day if you like and it is built for all ages to enjoy.
A playground fills the center of this roughly-oval shaped space, where greeters even let us big kids go down the 4-story spiraling  slide.   Speaking of greeters, DTP has employed a multitude of people focused on ensuring that you are enjoying Container Park.  
While sipping on a brew at Bin 702 (local Joseph James Brewery's 'Red Fox'), Eric cruised by for a happiness check.  These greeters are such a fantastic idea!  Not only do they add a sense of security, but their genuine nature and enthusiasm about downtown just make ya smile.
I have visited Container Park twice and look forward to making myself a regular there.
Pros: (so far) -Pinche Tacos---so authentic and vegetarian options for me!
                        -The Boozery       it's simple, they serve booze.  I likey.
                        -Bin 702  --exceptional beer list and great wines too.  
                                            I will be back to try the cheese plate
                        -The main stage which provides constant entertainment.
Cons:   The barstools at the Boozery are metal, the doors are open, and it is cold outside!  my cold bum cut my visit to this spot short.
              I know it might sound crazy to omnivores, but I would love to see some veggie options at the BBQ joint.  Get creative!

They might not have actually been that fast. 

There was also a game where you have to run around and touch lights when they light up and try to beat your friends scores. That was even funnier after a couple more drinks. 

Grown up building blocks and gigantic Legos, lounges to chill, and lots of shopping and dining pleased us. Be aware that you cannot bring outside drinks in, so try to finish what your beverages on Fremont before you head that way.

It is absolutely what one can do now a days with a freaking storage container.  I had marveled at the miscellaneous websites I have visited looking at cabin designs using with prefab material.  DCP is no exception. I likened it to a circular, multi-layered fort in the middle of downtown Vegas.  The centerpiece of DCP is a play land for kids that made me want to be eight again.  If it would not have been creepy or I would have ran the risk of getting stuck in some contraption, I would have bounced all over this steel, kiddy wonderland.

There was lot's to do and see.  We saw everything from hotdogs, booze, chocolate, glass, booze, booze, jerky, and an art gallery.  I hope to write reviews on many of shops we stopped in and spent money.

What makes this novel location a four star instead of a five is the tight quarters and a closed rest room.  Depending on where and when you visit, the potential for someone to touch you and breath on you is great.  For the most part everyone was cool, but you do have your selfish idiots out there.

As for the rest room, I stood outside one for almost 10 minutes.  I did not know the layout inside and assumed it could have been meant for a single individual.  Two employees would eventually exit and tell me the restroom was closed.  I told them it would have been helpful if there was a sign.  One of them told the other there should have have been a sign outside.  Whatever.

Seems like there is not to much to do but go down slides. There is a level where you have to be taller than 4'7"". A guy was manning the entrance to that slide. There are no swings or anything else but big building blocks that were taken by little toddlers. Not too many places to sit. 

Surrounding the playground were little shops and food eateries. We saw a bbq place, Mexican food shop, candy shop, etc. My daughter got to make her own paper lantern with the help of her dad and a girl who was guiding the kids to make it. 

After that, we saw a lion dance/dragon performance. Good for all ages. There were stands giving free stuff such as bags, cell phone chargers, ear buds, etc. Very cool.

The group I was there with was sitting in the grass area near the back edge by the walkway about center stage.  Due to discomfort I get in my knees from sitting on the ground I opted to stand behind them at the edge of the curb.  I watched the entire Charlie Worsham performance in this position. 

During the intermission between Charlie Worsham and Sheryl Crow I was approached by someone that works there and was told that I would have to sit in the grass or move.  I explained to him about my situation and why I'm unable to sit on the ground for very long periods.  He told me that the grass area is considered general seating and therefore you must sit when in that area.  I didn't buy his reason and he said he would go get security.  

A short time later he returns with their security personnel and they said the same thing that I must sit if I'm going to be in the grass area.  Then they further stated that I could not stand in the walkway between the grass area and the bleachers behind.  They said that the walkway must remain clear at all times and no standing in it is allowed.  At that point I was told by security that I must leave because I didn't comply with their request to sit on the ground.

I left and was headed for the exit and waited a few minutes before walking out of the park.  By this time Sheryl Crow was coming out on stage and as soon as she did everyone in the grass area was standing up on their feet to watch her performance.  Also the walkway that they told me that has to remain clear and no standing allowed in it was filled with dozens more people standing in it.  I returned to the spot I had been standing at previously and watched the concert with hundreds of other people standing in the grass.  

I looked around for the employee and security guards that confronted me earlier and they were no where to be found.  Interesting how they come along and make up their own rules to harass someone while there was no performance going on at the time but once the main act started I didn't see them making everyone else sit and clearing the walkway.",8BkiNHrPjoT4Mlkp4WAiGA,2,1,1,-WNQKUImjyEvWdHAkZrDtQ
1572978,2014-07-30,0,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"This place is good stuff. The wife and I personally enjoy so many aspects of the Container Park. We recently purchased downtown after some in depth research and investigations. We've been hanging out downtown since I moved here in 09 and have loved it since the first night I stepped food into the Griffin to grab a drink. Container Park is a huge step in the right direction and we love what they are trying to do w/ it. Seeing things like this and Inspire go up gives us a feeling of  happiness to see that we get to be a part of the development of the East Fremont District and watching it grow and evolve is awesome.

Beware of the waking of the mantis lol. This is another really cool thing that they do here. All the kids gather around in the entrance next to the mantis and they do a drum circle to wake it. They keep banging on their drums until the mantis wakes and spits fire out if its tentacles. It's warm and definitely will make you jump if you don't expect it. Definitely good for laughs to watch the random people get startled.

The Thursday Movie Nights were the best thing since sliced bread! They provided blankets, pillows, floaties to lounge on and other various forms of seating. They played some classics like Indiana Jones, Weekend at Bernies, Goonies and Stand By Me. You were able to grab food from one of the eateries and bring it out to watch the movie and chow down. They even had a pop-up bar right in the grassy area.

They put on small concerts there also. We've heard some great live music while there on numerous occasions. 

The food options are plenty. My wife and my favorite choice is Big Earn's. They are super affordable and really good. Don't forget the free refills there on non-alcoholic beverages to add the ""cherry on top"".

I did hear about the 2nd and more so the 3rd levels of shops having problems drawing customers. I could see how that could happen especially since a large portion of the people I see there are families w/ kids. They probably don't want to deal w/ the hassle of dragging the kids up there to see what there is.

No kids after 9pm makes it somewhere that both families and adults can frequent. You can even play the cool light game and go down the awesome slides after 9p.",3ZCS3niZj8GjbZY6Dx7uqw,1,1,4,iT7Qmr5wOLyQ8vK18m-Trw

I do think there is equal entertainment for kids during the day than there is for adults at night. I went at night time and when I arrived I did see kids in the playground in the middle of the ""park"" which is a very impressive play area with big slides that go way high up. Pretty cool I would imagine for kiddos. At 9 p.m. they made an announcement that the park was now 21 and up. I have to say, I like this. I find it odd that people walk around Fremont Street with babies and little kids with drunk people and all kind of crazies all over. I like that they check ID before entering and there are security guards at the entrance and standing all over the park actually. I'm not sure why there is so much security, but hey I felt safe in this sketchy area. Now walk outside and that's a different story!

The park has a really cool stage with bands playing live music. Behind the stage is a barber shop in a train. Such a cool concept! There is also an area in front of the stage with large foam lego pieces and long sticks and a bouncy ball laying around that random people would play with, take funny pics, and go on their way. It was kind of random how this large space was taken up by a few random things thrown on the ground, literally. I think these items should be placed in the playground area. Maybe more seating so people can sit and relax while the bands play?

I can only assume the type of music changes since someone said they play reggae music too. This bad was pretty emo and low key, very enjoyable for a date night. Unlike Fremont street that plays music which encourages lots of screaming, dancing around, and it's just a different scene. At the park, I saw many couples and people on dates. There was one group of people getting drunk and rowdy, and they looked kind of out of place. It's a great place to people watch and with that being said, there are tables surrounding the play area in the middle. You can't sit at the tables with heaters unless you eat at the tables. You can't just sit there with alcohol you get from a bar or restaurant. I saw a security guard go up to a group and tell them to move because they were drinking and sitting. Apparently it's ok if they moved to a bench about 3 feet away, you just can't sit at the tables and drink. But I guess you can sit and not drink since that's what we did at first and we were not bothered. I am not sure if the guard was picking on these people or what the deal was, but they ended up buying popcorn just to be able to sit there. 

My hubby went to get a beer and the guard didn't bother us for sitting with alcohol. There is a sign though that says if you sit there, you need to eat. I later saw it after we had been sitting there for a while. I did not go inside the restaurants, but I can assume by the size of each restaurant/store that there is no dine in seating in the majority of the restaurants. Also, it appeared that everyone was sitting outdoors and eating at the Pork and Beans restaurant. I am all for outdoor eating, but I kind of expect that with less expensive food, or casual cafes, but I don't believe these restaurants were that cheap. I could be wrong, as I said I did not go inside them, I just glanced over them as I walked by. 

I also liked how the music played throughout the park on the speakers, so even if you did not sit near the stage, you could enjoy the music. I love the lights at the park, the store designs in containers, and 5 stars to the fire breathing praying mantis! Every time he shot out fire, people screamed and jumped. It was quite a scene to watch. This place has so much potential and is very trendy. I do have to say that the stores are tiny, only a few people can fit in them at a time, and I don't believe they appeal to most people. I did not see anyone inside the stores and I actually thought they were closed! Surprisingly they were open but they looked dark from the outside. 

I hope that they open up some more stores that appeal to more people and hope they expand since there is not much here. I walked by every store in 15 min and was done. I even went inside almost all of them. It has so much potential and I love the idea, so I just hope there is more to it as time goes on.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,4,0,4,adX743V6wt2D0Q3Ocy6voA

The Praying Mantis at the opening is as cool as it gets however.

First of all ,parking is ridiculous, be prepared to make a few rounds. And if you are there during ""business"" hours, be prepared to pay.

I came here with my brother, my mom and my daughter today. My brother is on crutches, and is well over 6feet tall. My daughter is one, so I had the stroller with me. 

These containers are way too small to be stores. Sure, they're ""boutiques"" but the small space is not cool. We all could only go into one store, the red stitch that was a ""double"" container. Super close quarters.

I find this place to be overpriced. There really isn't anything unique for sale, like I was expecting..... You could go to town square and probably pay less.


If you are claustrophobic, this is not the place for you. It was hard enough to maneuver with the stroller, I could only imagine how my brother felt.

There aren't many food places here. To be completely honest, the food court at the galleria looks more promising.

The praying mantis greets you at the entrance and it went off twice while we were there, shooting flames from its antennae. It's was pretty freaking awesome even though I originally thought they were gunshots and that I had been brought here to die. It was also surprisingly cozy at the chilly night. 

The park itself is made up of those shipping/freight containers (not containers from the Container Store as I had previously imagined). The containers now house very cute shops that sell cupcakes, trinkets, clothes, beef jerky, etc. There are also a lot of very interesting and enticing looking restaurants and food options and, like so many other places in Vegas, you can just wander about with alcohol. 

The BEST part of the park, however, is the tree house and play area in the middle, which is not just for kids (things that are not allowed include pets, drinks and food; there are security people there and they're serious about this). The tree house is fun to climb on even for grown ups and has lots of fun slides, including a two-story slide that's pretty intense. The security guide who stands there to ensure that only one person goes on the slide at a time suggesting I pick my feet up so I did. I suspect he was trying to kill me because I ended up doing a complete 180 degree spin on the slide and came out upside down. 

There is also a light game where you can compete by hitting the lights. Which was surprisingly fun even for someone who usually tries to avoid movement and I highly encourage anyone to give it a shot even if you see other people playing it and looking crazy. Also, blocks for building forts :)",XfHOhgHWjLwh80qvA94Dsg,2,1,5,JSWwEvmwZyNwJxDjBAsHMA

This is a review for the Downtown Container Park after 9pm.  This is when it becomes an adults-only area.  We were looking for a place to hang out and enjoy some drinks and chitchat that was away from the madness of Fremont Street.  The Container Park was clean, well-lit, patrolled by security, and an easy walk from east Fremont.  The lack of under 21s was refreshing.  So what was the problem?  The live entertainment.  I appreciate live entertainment but when you're in a small area and just want to drink a beer and talk with your friends, it's hard when you have to scream.  (Nothing against the band - it was just the venue that was a problem).  If I want my eardrums to bleed, I'll go back to Fremont Street.

We wound up just strolling through quickly and playing on the awesome playground ""for kids of all ages"" before leaving.  It was too loud to eat or drink in comfort, plus most of the eating is outdoor.  I'm glad the stores were closed.  From a quick glance, it looked like a bunch of mixed media crafts made by local, well-meaning self-professed ""artists"" who would usually make their living on Etsy.  I would have felt bad about not buying anything.

I will probably go back during the day and give it another try.  Fingers crossed that there isn't live (un)entertainment.

I realize the Container Park was a bit controversial because it's part of the urban gentrification, residents need a grocery store not a nut tray made of an old wine bottle, blah blah blah.  Well, tough.  That fire hazard/vagrants' lot was abandoned for a very long time before it was finally bulldozed and turned into the Container Park.  The gradual clean-up of downtown now finally extends past East Fremont.  A year ago, I would not have felt safe walking past the Ruby Slipper neon sign.  Thanks to the Container Park, I'm now more comfortable heading out further.  To be fair, it's not so much a service as it is a destination.  It requires a bit of effort to get there.  I have no idea who would deliberately seek out the merchandise sold there except out of kindhearted patronization.  Regardless, I hope it stays.",8SN6B3cUKkonmN2WEabjyA,2,0,3,mZ_yvymuj1UvSTXIgSRIqQ

The park's center play area is monitored at each gate so that children can run freely in a contained environment (no container pun intended) without hesitation. 

Kids that love to run and climb will adore the central play area. Younger kids have the ability to build Legos on the Astroturf nearby the climbing area, yet the turf area is not enclosed for free run of its participants.

All of the businesses surrounding the play area are independent retailers rather than chains.  They offer a variety of shopping and food options.

Our visit occurred on Easter in March so the park was not too hot and rather nicely shaded. I would definitely advise taking caution on hotter days during summer months, but to say so seems incredibly obvious since the park is made of mostly metal containers.

There is adequate, if not ample, street parking around Container Park and rates are $1/hour (maximum 2 hours).  I believe parking is free after 6pm -- anyone know for sure?  

We went in the afternoon during a weekday and found the place very quiet (not a surprise).  Cool things: praying mantis sculpture at entrance, treehouse and slide in the center of the park, super yummy smells emanating from the various restaurants.  Not so cool: how excited will people be to visit Container Park in the summer during the day?  This park is obviously meant to be enjoyed whilst wandering around outside.  Will there be misters come summer to rehydrate the bodies of the dehydrated visitors staggering around for relief from the desert sun?  

I would have liked more variety in the existing shops.  They range from recycled jewellery/housewares, ""artsy"" women's apparel, goodies (frozen desserts, cupcakes), and art galleries.

Whenever I'm in Vegas, I find myself doing things that aren't typically ""Vegas-y"". This place falls right into that category. Family friendly all the way to 9pm, this place boasts many neat features. 

1. A neat touch-sensor game that can be played solo or with multiple people. It's free! :)
2. A ""lawn"" for concerts that have comfortable patio furniture, blankets, and large lego-like bricks for kids.
3. The best tree house! Why? Because adults can slide down the slides too! These aren't the slides at your local park. Use caution if you get motion sick easily or if you're drunk. Also, take off your shoes for less friction and more speed.
4. A fire-breathing metal mantis.
5. Really neat layout made from reclaimed containers.

This is a great place to go to for a date. They have a few neat places to eat and drink as well as shop. Looks like they have free concerts fairly often and some paid ones. I also noticed that they have a ""Doggie Date Night"" where you can bring your pooch into the park.

Is the Container Park mediocre? Not necessarily in theory. In theory this place is amazing. In design it's pretty damn sweet. However, in execution it seems a bit lackluster. 

On paper this is a shopping area with small scale, local artsy stores and boutiques. In reality, the food choices outweigh the shops by far. In a parralel reality, the shops themselves feel a little random.

Unfortunately, a candy store, flip flop store, several jewelry places, toys store and a sock store do not get me too excited.. they give off a bazaar feel rather than a local arts feel. To boot, many places were closed for whatever reason - not closed for good, they were just not open.

The food choices here are pretty diverse. Actually, if the Container Park was purposed to be an alternative style 'food court' it would hit it right out of the park.  Between the 'elevated' hotdog place, Mexican restaurant, coffee bar, pizza joint, vegan place, juice bar, bbq spot and several bars this seems to be a happening little spot.

I am all about the shipping containers and the repurposing/upcycling of materials, I can appreciate the random (but sweet) Burning Man artifact and I can even deal with the hipsteresque vibes going around here.

The shipping containers which house the shops and restaurants surround the large outdoor quad area, and there's a substantial kids play area in the center of it all.

Whoever thought up and designed this place deserves a lot of credit.  And this place does not feel like Las Vegas at all (which, I suppose, defeats the purpose of going to Las Vegas, but I digress).  

First, it feels very safe.  There are security guards at each of the entrances and they let you know they are there.  And security is a very good thing in this neck of the woods.

It also does not feel like you are walking in and amongst a bunch of shipping containers.  It feels like a clean, safe, secluded, open-air little mini-mall with a bunch of interesting restaurants and shops and a really great play area (with a huge treehouse) in the middle.  So, the big kids can enjoy their grub and tequila and whiskey and wine and craft beer on the little outdoor patios while the kiddos go wild in the interior play area as you watch them.  It is a win-win for all.  Grown ups can have their fun (and booze) and bring their kids, too.  Plus, there is live music at night.

The front entrance, as you can see by the photos, is very cool.  Again, great design, great effort, great job.

Added bonus:  You are only a few blocks away from Atomic Liquors in one direction and a few blocks away from Fremont Street in the other direction.

Wait ... hipsters in Downtown Las Vegas? Yes. If you haven't been to Downtown Vegas in a while, there is a slow but steady transformation and revitalization of the areas surrounding the Fremont St. Experience. And perhaps the most grand of these efforts is the Downtown Container Park, a slice of hipster paradise amidst one of the oldest parts of Las Vegas. 

DTCP is a pretty neat place. The concept is that they have taken old cargo containers used for rail transportation and turned them into a hipster strip mall. There's also different pieces of art made out of junk to fit the theme, and at the center a massive playground where the hipsters can dump their kids while they get a glass of wine or microbrew. 

And of course the shops themselves are uber-hipster as well. There's several art galleries (including one that is focused on Disney Fine Art, so hipster cute!), specialty food shops (cupcakes, jerky, kettle corn, oh my!) and apparel shops. There's a nice selection of restaurants and bars here as well, including some great BBQ, a Kerry Simon backed venture that specializes in pork and beans, a vegan/raw food eatery, a wine bar, and a specialty cocktails/craft beer bar. 

DTCP does look a little bit out of place in the midst of the old ""low roller"" casinos in this part of Vegas. If anything, it looks like a destination pulled right out of a Portlandia sketch. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Variety is good, and the locals I spoke with seemed to like it as a spot that was different - something that you wouldn't normally find in Vegas.

From the ""outside"" I didn't really know what this Container Park was going to be like. We went for the first time last night, and it was a very nice surprise.

Once ""inside"", I realized all that they had been planning in this little area of DTLV. There are shops (clothing, art, candy and popcorn yay), restaurants and bars. I wish I had a little store here! There's 3 levels to the place and a large play area for kids. Big kids too, b/c I took a ride down the slides. So fun! There was also a stage with a small seating/standing area and a live band playing. 

It's such a cool little place to hang out with friends/family, maybe grab a bite to eat/drink, and be entertained by performers, and well, people. I'm so excited about bringing my California friends here the next time they're in town. They're always so surprised to see the other side of Vegas, since like most people, their knowledge is limited to the strip.

The Container Park is definitely worth checking out. I'm totally excited about it. I think it adds to what I'm hoping will be DTLV's beautiful awakening!",xPqMjZrlX8BKRAyREd5WuA,4,3,4,iZIJ4OzVz1bm14OBIRr9lA

This place is amazing.  My group of friends went to Fremont to do the whole downtown experience away from the strip on a Saturday night.  We typically leave 1 night per trip to come to Fremont for the completely different experience you get there as opposed to the Las Vegas Strip.

We were actually trying to find the new SlotZilla Zipline (that was unfortunately still under construction) when we wandered south a bit from the Fremont Street experience.  Boy I am glad we decided to do that because we found this little treasure.  Keep in mind it was about midnight when we wandered across this place so I am sure it is a difference experience during the day.  When we got there, it was not very busy and they carded us at the gate.  I guess it becomes 21+ only after 9pm which is awesome.

The middle area was a playground type of thing which I'm sure kids use during the day, and then drunk adults use at night.  The stand out in this area was a light up game that made you push lights as they come on while your opponent tried to do the same.  This led to hysterical fun (especially after drinking a few) and burned quite a few calories in the process.

There were also restaurants and stores around on multiple levels but the majority were closed.  It was Midnight after all so I cant fault them.  The Jerky place in there was amazing....I ended up buying like 10 bags because it was so good.  I would like to come earlier to see more of the stores and places.

Did I mention that the whole place was made out of shipping containers by the way?

We parked in the metered area, and I remember thinking ""2 hours max - damn.""  Going in, I assumed we'd have to leave and park somewhere else after our time expired.  We were out of there in about 90 minutes, and that includes waiting forever to get some grub.

The entire footprint is small.  And cramped.  The design is nice, but I don't feel like logistics were considered very well.  The bathrooms are a joke - super tiny and hard to find.  Lines for the various eateries were extended out in the path of travel.  The play area in the center is nice, but already filthy and not well maintained in general.

There are several decent places to eat.  There is also live music which was nice.  Definitely a ""cool"" concept that works well in theory, but, as executed, I just don't think it will work out.

I remember sitting at a pop up dinner in Tony Hsieh's apartment about 2 years ago. The guys across from me talking about their current project and how they are tearing down a old motel and building apartments and retail centers out of containers. They said, ""you must think we're crazy right?' My boyfriend and I both responded with ""NO WAY, WE THINK YOU ARE SMART, AND LONG OVERDUE!""
Finally, I can bring my child downtown without being scared she will be offered drugs!! And I am serious. Also, I can leave her at home after hours, come here, and still enjoy myself. 
At this point Container Park does close, but not til late on the weekends. I was there at around 6pm on a Sunday night and the number of children equaled adults which is cool. There should be the option for adult and kid entertainment. 
Live reggae music played in the background. It was not to loud yet you could hear it throughout the park. There is a little something for everyone. From cupcakes, to jerky, to art, a barber shop, and of course BBQ and TACOS!! (Which I will be trying on my next trip because pork and beans DID NOT make the cut!)
In the middle there are 2 separate play areas, one more appropriate for younger kids and then of course the 50 foot tree house slide that is good from youth on up til you can't make it up those stairs.

WHAT: I am so excited for Downtown Las Vegas! There are great things happening, which include THE CONTAINER PARK! I just loved the idea of how this park/shopping/eatery area has been set up!

Before you enter, you are amazed by the fire breathing grasshopper at the entrance (KID FRIENDLY). When you actually enter the park, the shops are contained in metal containers- so clever! When you look straight ahead (the middle of the park), there is a Super cool playground!! There was also a tree house made of balloons you can take pictures of and or with! As you walk towards the back end of the park, there is a stage where live bands play! Behind the live band, there happens to be a barber shop. COOL! FREE, LIVE MUSIC WHILE YOU GET A HAIRCUT!

I also love how this park gives our locals a chance to express themselves and let you taste, see, and try what they have worked so hard for! There are many boutiques that are locally owned as well as the eateries! I did get to try Jojo's Jerky, which is a locally made beef jerky store. They do not tax because they make the jerky themselves. My friend and I clearly supported, we ended up buying 3 flavors, saving us the rest of the day! =D

I am going back soon to try some of their food spots! I suggest you all to bring the family and just HAVE A GOOD TIME! :)

2538206,2014-06-10,2,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"I absolutely love that Downtown Las Vegas is getting a facelift. Awesome dog parks, lofts, hipster type bars, poetry nights, food selections galore, mixed with old neon nostalgia and newer modern fixtures. Add every type of walks of life, some art and a little culture, and you get a pretty awesome area to hang out at.

 One of the best additions to the Downtown area is the Container Park. 

There are two different experiences: before 9pm when all ages are welcomed, and after 9pm when it becomes an adult only wonderland. 

Before 9pm:

 I've taken my 3 kids (ages 14, 11 and 7) on numerous occasions, and they've all enjoyed the place. We've given our business to as many store fronts as we can, as we'd like to see this place stay open, be successful, and possibly expand somehow. We walk around and get treats from the popcorn and cupcake stores, I indulge in a Thai Iced Coffee, we've eaten at the BBQ and taco restaurants on more than one occasion. We browse the art galleries and have of course, sat in the grassy area to listen to live music, and for the kids to play on the playground. We always make it a point to go near sunset, as we love to be part of the drum circle at the front entrance.

 We once went with 15 or so people, and even on a busy Sunday, found an open table and enough chairs to where we could all eat at the same time, right next to the playground tree house so where we could supervise the kiddos. 

 Tip: When you first arrive, ask what time the first drum circle begins. Go back to the front entrance 10-15 minutes beforehand, to guarantee a seat and a drum, so as to be in the drum circle to wake up the big Mantis out front. The drum circle lasts 15-25 minutes, you're following a khaki-clad Downtown Ranger, following the ranger in a series of drum beats and patterns. The Mantis then wakes up, blowing out fire. It's quite impressive. 

 
 After 9pm:

 A few friends of ours got together at Container Park to join their 'movies in the park' series that they had in May and part of June. They show old movie classes on a big projector screen over the stage at the grassy area. We brought our own blankets, but the park provided beach blankets, floaty blow up inner tubes (PERFECT to use as pillows) and beach balls. The two times we've gone, they showed the original Jaws and Weekend at Bernie's. They have a mini bar set up on the grassy area, but some of the restaurants are still open. The vibe is chill and it's quite a different experience, sharing the tree house slides with only other adults, instead of having to wait your turn amongst a million 5 year olds. 

  Hoping that they bring back the 'movies in the park' series soon! Definitely going to make this a regular place to visit.",jWNooyYAuHWUpxnZGTRpeA,4,3,5,O3yoCZpgz7kWmmQZCDFHYA

Sure glad that we did, it was all lit up for the holidays and bustling with families, couples, singles et al. REALLY want to ride the giant slide next visit. The Las Vegas Youth Orchestra serenaded from the festive bandstand as children young and old availed themselves of the play area immediately facing them. 

Know Kerry Simon has a spot here, there's a vegan joint and the makes me giggle taco pinches, places to eat, drink, people watch, listen to and view art in the making...the only thing that concerns me is a previous review mentioning the restrooms being inside of these ""containers"" as well; this screams Porta Pottie and is HIGH on my list of phobias. Since I did not seek out the facilities during my visit, I will reserve judgement there. 

For now, I'm thrilled this unique destination is available and can imagine wiling away the hours or Trikking the nearby streets. I dig it, I reallllly do :-)

My recommendation for the Adult Beverage places is to come during ""happy hour"" to get the most buzz for your buck.  After you have had a few climb to the top of the ""TreeHouse"" for a little drunken slide'in.  Ahh... to be a kid again would be a blast.  We never had places this cool to play growing up. 

Container Park is a good time day or night.  With or without kids a good time can be had by all just sit back relax and enjoy.

- Parking would probably be a pain if it was a busy weekend.  Be prepared with quarters and comfy shoes.

- The team behind the design and construction of this place is genius.  The transformation of container vans into a sleek but whimsical, fun but functional space that people can enjoy for FREE is an admirable feat.  

- The main playground/treehouse is quite a narrow space, I would definitely not attempt to go here if the place was packed.  But on a slow weekday, they still had lots of security guys roaming and constantly looking after kids and parents.  Great job guys.  I'm also not sure that the treehouse and slides are something that I would keep bringing my son back to play with.  Once or a few times would suffice.

- There's a grass field fronting a small concert space with good sound quality so you might want to check out their monthly event lineups here - http://downtowncontainerpark.com/events/.

- I wish the awesome mantis at the entrance was part of the space inside where people can enjoy it more.

- I was only able to try 1 restaurant, the Mexican one and wasn't very impressed.  The only other spot that interested me sold charcuterie and wine but they opened late for lunch.  You could see that the people hanging out at Container park were there primarily for the space and not the food.  I wish they'd have some really sick/awesome food joints to keep people coming back for more.

I'm glad I went on a lazy slow day before it became too hot.  It was quite enjoyable walking around to Jazz music wafting in the air, flowers on the sidewalks and children running here and there.  Will I go back?  Only for great food and music.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,5,4,4,cHDSHSJ2yOo02G8w_1acRA

Just a few blocks from the Deuce bus stop, this collection of shops and restaurants might be built from shipping containers, but it feels like a true city-center oasis in an otherwise low-density, endlessly sprawling city. 

There's a large artificial lawn with a stage that plays host to concerts, movies, games, and other events. Leading away from the lawn is an easily navigable loop around the premises that takes you past many quirky boutiques and inexpensive restaurants. There's also art throughout the venue, including a gigantic preying mantis sculpture. 

It all feels like the food truck parks and beer gardens that we have in the Bay Area.

Even though, Vegas has a bunch of fun places kids; finding cool activities for a toddler is a bit trickier, but I figured this would be fun for him because he can run around and play. They have a large area where children can have a blast, even by the stage- it's still a kid-friendly spot.

Speaking of a stage- yes they have concerts here! I am sure there is a list on their website of who performs at the concert series. Also, there are boutiques and restaurants, so if you have the urge to shop, or grab a bite to eat it is only a few steps away.

That was my first question when my friend asked me if I wanted to go check out the Container Park while having dinner at Pizza Rock. So off we went along with my wifey and kids.

Wow. This place was a whole park made out of ACTUAL containers. I mean, who does that? Anyways, before we even stepped foot in it, you see a giant preying mantis out front with flames shooting out of its antennae. Again, I ask. Who does that? I gotta say, just that alone is a pretty good first impression. The other thing I liked was that you have a couple of security guys watching over the entrance, which is the only way in, and the only way out.

As you come in, you will see various stores/restaurants from a beef jerky place, to a barbeque place. There is even a decent sized stage towards the end of the park. What I think the main attraction of this place is the big treehouse that is smack dab in the middle of the whole place which features a 33 foot tall slide.

Bottom line is that my kids loved hanging out here and this place is a refreshing sight to see compared to all the casinos going up all over the place and the Fremont Street Experience is no different.

Some random info: There is free wifi and the bandwidth is very good I might add. 21 and over only after 9 pm.

Overpriced boutiques. I'm all for supporting local businesses, but the prices were outrageous. Food stands were ok, but nothing spectacular, and for the price, you can do a lot better.

I was in town for my dad's 60th. Half my family was tired from Vegas shennaningans, the other half gamblers. I fit into neither category so around 11Am on a beautiful, sunny Monday I bought a yard-tall frozen margarita and walked up and down Fremont St. by myself. I decided to venture past the more touristy area and wound up in downtown Las Vegas. Unfortunately Container Park didn't allow outside food and drink so I had to down my alcoholic beverage. And at $13 a pop, I sipped down every last margarita-filled drop.

(Only) slightly intoxicated, I walked into the park. It had a badass play area for kids and an outdoor stage for concerts and movie nights. The park itself is made of about 3 levels of shops and restaurants, ranging from toy shops to street art shops. (I wish I'd purchased some art but was worried about carrying on the plane.) Almost everyone could find something in there. The restaurants smelled delicious.

It's a great area to pass the time and just wander around, get some vitamin D while you're at it. If gambling's not your thing and you get tired of the drunk scene, walk on down to Container Park.",1x-oDcqyRtUCLVKHnP1phg,1,1,4,CeAeonDpIhHj-bTjj9H3rw

And my little review won't impact its overall excellent rating, which it deserves. But the fact is, I don't know that Downtown Container Park is all that engaging for those of us who live and work in the area. I am not aware of discounts or other promotions that appeal to Nevadans or Clark County denizens. It's hip, but not worth the downtown trip, and parking nightmare for the average resident.  But that doesn't mean that it is not a fun place, and a cheery atmosphere. It is super fun to lounge around this little oasis of shipping containers full of interesting tchotchkes, pubby food, and cute little outdoor park.  

To appeal to us locals, I would recommend some events, such as Shakespeare in the Park performances, or an occasional farmer's market, or outdoor movie, or some such thing (similar to what Tivoli does, which is a much more appealing locals spot), as well as some promotions or discounts!

I noticed a heart shape sculpture with a lot of padlocks. I believe it was the Lock of Hearts for Downtown Las Vegas.

I continued on towards the entrance where the security was standing. 
""May I help you?"" Asked the security. 
""Is it alright if I walked around?"" I asked.
""Go right ahead. It is a shopping center,"" was his response.

I passed the entrance and noticed a play area for children as well as kids at heart. There was a Mexican eatery, a store where you can purchase hot chocolate,  few other restaurants, a toy store, plus a big open area with a couple lounge couches for movie nights. 

I had asked a different security guard about the open area and he mentions that in the summer they would have at least two bands perform on stage daily. At 9pm it would be adults only because of all the alcohol being served.

The Container Park was such an awesome place to visit and quite honestly, one the highlights of my trip to Las Vegas. 

The area was still relatively new and we found it really quiet on an early Thursday afternoon. So we took advantage of the ample lawn space and practiced our handstands and cartwheels, hung off the ladders of the caboose, visited the barber, ate some jerky, lazed on the swinging bench, and watched some kids tag the brick wall with some chalk. All while the sun loomed high with nary a cloud in the sky.

The centerpiece was a tempting treehouse that was off limits because the scorching heat had turned it into a huge vertical frying pan. We entertained ourselves with the NEOS play system where we tuckered ourselves out with light-tagging challenges that sent us in cardio circles. Running under unrelenting heat rays sent us panting to the shade where we constructed a giant-sized Jenga set with the foam blocks. A nearby curious child joined our game and with his father's help, he managed a few key plays.   Another friend fashioned herself a couch complete with a drink kozzie and sat back chanting, ""Jenga...Jenga...Jenga...""  What goes up must come down and down the tower tumbled at eight levels high, raining cushy blue rectangles to a chorus of mirth and merriment.

This place is unique and cool, but here are the problems- the tiny shops limit every store's footprint so they can't display/sell much product, hence they have to charge more. The restaurants have to have limited offerings (storage and prep space) and count on patrons eating outside in the heat. Most of the tiny shops don't have employee bathrooms but since the shops can't support multiple employees they have to close the door and run down the hall. The land acquisition and build out costs were surely high, so rents probably reflect that. There is no dedicated parking. I can't believe the locals would become repeat customers, so they have to rely on the tourists bubbling up Fremont Street. From a business perspective the place is most similar to airport kiosks- counting on throwing out a net and catching 10 out of 1,000 people passing by.

Most wouldn't be bothered by that, but when you're with a group of adults it's annoying to have people break off to smoke and come back. But maybe it would be worth it if the shops had interesting things? Not really. If you live in a city of any size, there's nothing you can buy at DCP that you couldn't find in your hometown. Or order off Etsy. Prices were outrageous, shop staff were unfriendly (most didn't even say hello when you walked in). What's more, not only were most stores NOT air conditioned, most didn't even have fans or anything else to abate the oppressive Vegas heat (remember, these are steel shipping containers!). So one had almost NO incentive to stay and browse. 

Before my visit I checked out many of the vendor's websites and found one that claimed to offer ""fresh limeaid"" (complete with a photo of a condensation-covered glass pitcher full of lime slices). I went to the shop and was told they didn't have anything like that, and never had. To his credit, the helpful employee offered to make a ""limeaid"" out of sno-cone syrup, but that's not the same thing at all. I eventually found a drink, but was puzzled as to which of the 8 trash\recycling receptacles I was supposed to put the now-empty cup in (and I wan't the only one). Since my hands were sticky (every surface at DCP seemed sticky, for some reason), I had to use the horrific restrooms to wash my hands. 

The bottom line is this: your home city has a ""funky"" neighborhood, right? Like Plaza Midwood here in Charlotte, or Little Five Points in Atlanta? Take half those shops, fill them with a quarter of the merchandise, jack up the prices by 75% and put the whole thing in uncomfortable steel boxes in a bad part of town and you have the DCP. This place is living proof that you can't ""make"" cool or interesting... it just has to happen. DCP is kind of a cheesy, hipster Epicenter (Charlotte) or Underground Atlanta, and it's not even a good one at that. There was nothing there to hold the attention of four college-educated adults, which is why we planned to stay at DCP for 2 hours, but only ended up spending 30 minutes there.",Kn_02c9-Jkpm3nakKk9mbg,2,1,1,IK6pp5GHks1aPzqHHyewHA

Everyone knows it's HOT in Vegas right? Shipping containers are made of metal. So, it feels extra hot in this park. But, I think because it looks so run down, compared to the glitz on the Strip that everyone imagines when they think of Vegas, there is a cool hipster vibe to this place.

In this little complex - there are restaurants (many that are on Eater's recommend list), little shops, a fake grass area where you can play with a life sized connect four, jenga, or just run around, and also a kids playing area.

There are misting stations all around - absolutely necessary as it is so HOT in here, but all in all really fun to check out and walk around.

It's kind a of a gem compared to the surrounding Fremont St area, walking thru the gate you can immediately tell the clientele difference. The fire breathing pray mantis is beyond cool (pretty much a burning man mutant vehicle) and free to watch the show, well worth stopping by.  The kids tree house is fabulous with technology and tons of stuff to keep kids occupied for hours.

Unfortunately all of that is wasted on this containers park security and management .We arrived at the park at 8:30pm Friday May 25th,2018 with our two young boys who darted right to the tree house and started to have a good time. At 9pm the musician/dj/whatever gave a half ass announcement over the PA system that the place was closed to anyone under 21 years old and anyone under 21 to please make you way out. Sure no problem we understand, it would have been nice to have some warning but we understand these things and packed up the kids and headed out. On our way out we stopped by waffelato to grab some icecream for the adults and kids. This is where container park goes to 100% pure trash and should be ashamed of themselves. In the middle of getting our ice cream and very rude security guard busted in and told us our kids weren't allowed in the store and we had to leave now. Not get complete your transaction and be on your way, nope get the hell out of the store right now and let someone else finish your transaction. Not only was this extremely rude and embarrassing it made my kids break down and cry. Even the remaining customers in waffelato commented on how rude and awful it was for security to force paying customers our of the store. 

So a big FU to container park, the security staff, the management staff and I hope Tony Hsieh reads about this as his money is being pissed away by management who shouldn't be managing a trashcan let alone a trendy complex.  Don't believe me? pull the video camera recording from the evening from Waffelato.

To the business manager Kristine R who will read and try and flag this. Don't bother replying to this with some half assed policy reply, you guys messed up.

3188227,2014-03-24,1,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"Good use of freight containers; quite creative, I must say. But is it too creative at the retailers' expense or possibly their demise?

If a shop is making a killing, imagine the sales per square feet (as long as the rent isn't too bad)! That is great! But the shops confined in those containers, although not all, are perhaps at risk of not ""making it."" The shops selling food and drinks may do well enough, but the boutique shops I'm afraid are so empty of buying customers. The Disney art shop has some nice art to sell but I just see a lot of shoppers, like me, who were just there to look. 

It's a nice concept. As a consumer, it's a good place to burn an hour or two. But it's not a destination park/shopping center. I can see myself going there to get a drink or grab something light to eat, although I can probably get the same things elsewhere, but definitely not to shop. 

The place is kid-friendly with a nice tree house and play place in the center, but no kids are allowed after 9:00 PM. Oh, the irony. So why have such a good portion of the real estate for the kids when they only have a limited time. Perhaps it is for the best and safety of the children; this is downtown after all. 

The performance area is nice. There's even a barbershop behind it. Why it's back there? I do not know, but nice use of old boxcars. And of course, one cannot miss the fire-breathing preying mantis at the park entrance.

It's industrial art in an urban setting with its retailers hoping to generate enough sales to stay in business in years to come. I like the art part but the one thing it may have trouble with is staying relevant in this town, never mind making enough money. Even Mayor Oscar Goodman tried so very hard to make Las Vegas a city of art but it just isn't. People don't come to Vegas for art. There's not enough locals to fully support the art aspect alone. Art has struggled in this town.

It would be nice to one day have a true art museum in town with different art installations and exhibits on display -- and I am not just talking about art galleries inside the mega hotels. But I realize once again that this is Las Vegas.",UqQg89q9VzER0pmTyzDcSA,2,0,3,aVvZy_R56CSkArHuFK3frQ

""Ew, they don't recycle as much as the rest of the world!""   
""Ew, it's too touristy.""  
""Ew, there is no culture there!""
""Ew, there is no sense of community!""

Well, hang on to your scarves and beanies (that you're wearing in 90 degree weather) because Downtown Container Park is the contradiction to all of the above statements.  Most of the business that reside there are local -  contradicting the complaint about capitalism.  Dudes.  The whole park is a grand display of recycling and reusing.  Um, I guess it is somewhat touristy - but what cool thing isn't???  Fact - not all touristy things are cool, but most cool things are touristy.  Maybe.  I dunno. 

There are art displays, local musicians playing, a nightly drum-circle for peace, so there's your culture.

We walked down to the Fremont street experience and decided to have dinner there in the park. We walked back and ordered our meal (at about $20 a plate for tacos and beer!!!!) around 8:48 and my daughter asked if she could go out and see the mantis on fire... I told her yes! Then my husband went to get her and they told her she couldn't come back in!!!!!  She walked back in anyway. At 9:00 they announced that if you are under 21 the park is closing.  Mind you we were still waiting of our meal! This was Saturday night. So we then felt like we had to rush through our  meal we had JUST purchased in order to leave with the under age one. Not so great. If they are marketing this for families, then it needs to be that- 9pm is not that late for families on a weekend.

The outdoor park is incredible for  my younger (8 and 5 y/o) children to play. There's always other kids and they'll play for hours especially on the unique electronic giant thing. Sometimes there's live music which is always nice. If their Dads with us I'll wander to my friend Jessica Galindos cool shop, the galleries and to get a sample of jerky from Jojos. I've gone to this mall since the soft opening so unfortunately several places I really liked are already out (some back to only their original downtown locations at least) due to the short term nature of leases. There's some new ones but I haven't bought anything really special that's still available except leggings from Crazy Legs and random gifts from art box. I've also given up on any food options outside of snacks from the vegan place or the candy or cupcake shops for the kids. The meal places all were either too pricey for the food (big erns, pinches tacos) or wildly inconsistent good/bad food (bin 702) pork n beans was undercooked beans and they're closed now. Sweet Spot was always great but packed every time now which is the biggest drawback of the place. Tourist central!!! 90% of the friends on the playground are from out of town any time we've gone. And it's a mall plain and simple.  Ive never been for the night life time when shops are closed so no comment to that.

The container recycling concept is really catching on. I've seen containers used to build seaside condos, but this is the first time I've seen them used in this little outdoor mall/entertainment center format. The centerpiece here (and this will surprise some of you downtown Vegas purists) is actually a playground right smack in the middle, where dozens of screaming kids run wild.

3542853,2014-11-10,9,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"Thought I'd add my 2 cents. 

The container park is a fun outing if you're in the area, but as of now I wouldn't make a special trip there. 

The concept is cool but I really think they need more space. Walking around the entire area, including all three floors, MIGHT take 15 minutes. Which doesn't really encourage people to stay and browse. 

I spoke to one shop owner who said she wont be renewing her lease. She's just not making enough to cover rent. And with the minuscule sizes of the ""shops"" (think boarding house room), I can see why. 

Perhaps if they had some festivals here where the shop owners could put their merchandise out on tables it would help them a bit.  But with how crowded the shops feel, if you are claustrophobic (or salesperson-ophobic), you don't really want to go into the shops. I think they're so small and the salespeople are so desperate that you feel like you'll be assaulted by them the moment you step in the door. So what happens? You don't (or at least I don't) go in. 

The playground is pretty cool. Theres a Huge treehouse and foam building blocks the kids enjoyed playing with. 
The praying mantis is interesting (though the sudden bursts of flame from its antennae terrified my four year old),  but thats not enough to get me to come all the way downtown from hendertucky. The playground is also pretty spread out and if you have more than one child its a nightmare to keep track of them all. The bandstand is a nice idea but the bands can be LOUD and theres really not enough seating to encourage people to stay and listen. 

The only food i tried was the ice cream shop. That was quite frankly a nightmare. They fresh made ice cream for my son - sounds great right? Yeah, except it literally took them twenty minutes to make it! My other kids were done by the time he got his, and i was late getting back to the parking meter and got a parking ticket! That alone was enough to make me not ever want ice cream from there again. Get with it people. This is VEGAS. It is HOT. I do not want to wait twenty minutes for ice cream even if its hand made by Willy Wonka himself and given to me on a jewel encrusted platter made for Elvis by Tony Hsieh. Pre-make your handmade ice cream  for Pete's sake!

Yeah. 

Otherwise its an interesting little jaunt that could kill an hour or two.

Love the cool vibe and the atmosphere here at DCP. I especially love when people walk right past the Giant Praying Mantis and get the CRAP scared out of them!  LOL!!! 

Cool concept and great way to help local businesses get their start, but like other reviews state, the prices here are cray-cray especially when you know there's other spots to grab a bite that are close to DCP,  and doesn't rip you off *cough* The Goodwich, Tacos El Buen Pastor, Rollin' Smoke BBQ,  Art of Flavors *cough, cough*

AHEM!!! *clears throat* Anyway, it's a good place to hang out after dinner(and after 9pm for adults only) The live music stage is cool, and so is the huge slide! Haven't checked out any of the little boutiques yet, but maybe we'll do so on our next visit. ALOHA!!!

JoJo's Jerky

Yes, my vegetarian wife was curious enough to seek out JoJo's. We tried some of their sauces and spiced nuts and wound up buying some cactus jerky, which has a texture like fruit leather. We also bought their Caribbean jerk marinade. This place is not just for carnivores.
Thanks, Hans, for the free water!

Simply Pure

Perhaps as penance, we split a sampler plate at Simply Pure. Would you believe that the zucchini pasta, nachos, and ""chicken salad"" filled us up? [OK, I may have smuggled in a couple of beers!] If you've never tried raw food, you'll be surprised at how hearty some of it is. I'm sure this will make the short list for our return visit. Refer to Sandya N.'s review for more details. Apparently, head chef Stacey Dougan used to work at the Wynn. For fun, ask what Steve likes!

The Black Cup

Iced coffee hit the spot on this 100 degree day.

Art Box

We didn't buy anything here, but we enjoyed browsing. Of note were the pendants made from poker chips and others made from Scrabble tiles.

Next time, we'll have to try

Cheffini's

It's a bit obnoxious that the vegan hot dogs cost a dollar more, but they do look good.

Oak & Ivy

Can't resist a well-crafted cocktail!

The Perch

Correct me if I'm wrong, but Happy Hour seems to be M-F, 3-6. They do brunch on the weekends including build-it-yourself bloodies!

We were here on a Sunday afternoon and paid for parking at a metered space. Other reviewers mentioned free parking available in the area on Sunday, but we couldn't find any. Refer to Erin B.'s review that mentions a couple of places (hopefully nearby) where you can park for free.

But, what is a ""container park"", anyway? You'll just have to visit and see for yourself. Don't forget to check their calendar of events before you go.",rvkVh-FNvg2fYSgHjG4mkQ,7,6,4,LocSSmjOd1PiSKIoa-h3Gw

I love that the stores are local business owners, especially the food! I enjoy supporting local businesses & helping them get started!

Once I saw (on Instagram, of course) that the Container Park was open, the BF and I decided to have Sunday Funday/night there. 

We came around 9pm and were greeted with the fire breathing grasshopper fronting the Container Park's entrance. 

I was immediately drawn to the lights on the trees that add to the Christmas vibe...tis the season, afterall.

Then love the look of the stores and restaurants in the containers. Container Park, itself, seems to be only a fourth filled with businesses. 

In the middle, you see a park similar to Town Square's park BUT...and it's a Big BUT, there's a fairly gigantic tree house in the middle with slides on them. Slides so big that it kinda hurt my boyfriend on the slide that makes a U-turn. ***I just wonder if security is really watching the kids and controlling who goes down and when***
In fact, the tree house was so tall that I was scared to go up more stairs because it's, like, three stories tall.

Along with the park, there's a stage next to it. Perfect for outdoor concerts! Can't wait to see how the Container Park will participate in next year's Life is Beautiful Festival.

The mix of art galleries, restaurants, bars, even hair salon adds to the eclectic mix that is the Container Park! And that was just from what was open while I was there.

- Recycled shipping containers made into a classy outdoor shopping center and play ground. What's not to love about recycling? 
- The playground had water-misters to keep you cooled down. Both myself and my toddler loved the misting! 
- The playground is very secure- both with security guards and it is fenced in. This is a wonderful feature for the safety of my little ones who love to run off. The added security of the nice guard was also nice for a downtown park, and she made sure that my toddler didn't escape out the gate when he tried to, while my pregnant self was running after him. 
- Lots of creative play, not just structures- legos, foam blocks, chalk board, etc
- This may sound silly, but I loved that there are compost bins built into the trash/recycling bins. And they tell you what goes into what if you don't already know. 

I would love to check out the adults-only events after 9pm when the park is 21+. But that will have to wait until baby-in-the-belly arrives and I can have a night out with the hubby.

They have fun face painters and the coolest balloon animal guy I've ever seen! He made motorcycle balloons, octopus backpacks, crowns, bows and arrows, unicorns you could ride, and cute flowers. I confess, I sat there for two hours watching him make cool balloon stuff, and even almost stood at the long line just to get one. 

They had fun gigantic Styrofoam legos to make cool forts and houses with (every kid's dream!), really high swirly slides for any kid to go bonkers with, and this really fun interactive light up game. This game you can play multiple games of your choosing from their selection in which you press the buttons as they light. 

For the ""BIGGER KIDS"" there's fun shops with artwork, furniture stores, clothing and accessory stores to browse. Wanting to get a little tipsy? Fear not, they've got bars where you can grab a beer or two, or maybe sip a little wine. Kids getting hungry? Fear not! They have awesome bbq joints and sandwich shops. Wanting something sweat? FEAR NOT! They have a candy shop, cupcake shop, ice cream shop...Need a hair cut? FEAR NOT! There's a barber shop! Wanting entertainment? NO WORRIES! They have live bands perform from time to time. The design is beautiful and fun both you and the kids would love...

Downside, the shops do get pretty pricey in things, as well as the places to eat so if you're looking to spend on a budget, food and drinks would probably be your first choice, and then if you find something you REALLY REALLY want you might walk out with something cool and handcrafted.

Well, ok - that center play area has a big treehouse, so I officially rejected any kid age parameters (there are none here btw) & climbed on up myself.  There are mutiple tube slides that you can slide down, and the highest one even has a red light/green light system so that you know you're not going to brain anyone if you go next.  Fun!  

There's a stage where they have live music or movies showing, & a grassy area around it with lawn furniture.

The shops have local artists' stuff, plus food, cupcakes, jerky, clothing & accessories, and toys.  My fave shop was called Blue Marble - they upcycle discarded bottles of alcohol from the Strip into the COOLEST things.  We also got a yummy soft red velvet sammich cookie, with cream cheese icing in between, & half dipped in white chocolate at the little cupcake shop on the first floor.  

After 9pm, kids are not allowed in the area, so it turns into an adult playground.  There are a few bars in the park, & people were walking around with wine.  There's seating on all the outside patios.

Oh!  And there's a huge metal sculpture of a praying mantis at the entrance.  A guy mans it & shoots fireballs out of the antennae when it gets dark.  You'll hear it, & if you stand close, you'll feel the heat.

Also at the entrance is a big metal heart sculpture where people have padlocked messages on metal tags.  Sweet : ).

Just across the street (towards the spectacle that is Fremont Street) is a great little Whole Foods-y market that has baked goods, produce, a hot food area, etc.  A couple blocks past is Fremont Street.

Whether you're a big kid or a little kid, or a mixed group, this is a definite must visit when you're in Vegas!",SIZOfo7jTjCXnL8ZtpM2aw,1,1,5,w-sRb7mSfOIWep-dEleeSA

I read some of the comments about it being small, and yes, most of the stores and restaurants are small, but I feel that if it were any bigger it would lose the appeal of it being a Container park.  We went on a Saturday morning so parking was free.  If you go on a Friday night, you'll have to pay for parking.  We went to Freemont the night before and paid $5 at the El Cortez parking structure so still not too bad since there is so much to do in that area anyway.  

This place is great for kids.  They have jumbo sized legos, and some other foam toys they can use in a large play area.  They also have a large slide like the ones you'd find at the water parks.  Looks like it's a pretty popular since there was a long line of kids.  I even wanted to try it :)

There are indeed containers; but, it is certainly not a park.

Downtown Container Park is as much as a ""Park"" as Downtown Summerlin is ""Downtown[;]"" as much as Phineas Taylor Barnum actually believed that his Cardiff Giant was an actual petrified man; or, as much as Tony ""Montgomery Burns"" Hsieh actually cares about anything besides dolla dolla bills yaaaa'll. 

This cesspool is more akin to an unnecessary ""Mardi Gras of consumerism"" than any park. In the old days, malls had the cojones to call themselves malls; and, at least, they respected the community enough to keep the cultish nonsense down to a bare minimum. 

One must at least respect that at the time Boulevard, Meadow, and Fashion Show malls went up, developers were not so Orwellian to bastardise the naming of malls by leaving the term mall out of their titles.

This place is rather on downslope of the mediocre side, and naming it a ""Park"" won't change it. So, cease the backpatting party, put the llama on a cross gold pendant down, and get real. Downtown Container Mall barely avoids the one-star.

We got around to taking a drive here to the current talk of the town, Downtown Container Park.  I do like the concept - what to do with old barge shipping crates?  I know, deck them out, put em together like a building, and charge a markup on services for unsuspecting tourists!  Brilliant.  Tony Hseih and company have got it down to a 'T'.

As an idea, the park is awesome.  I do like the rugged architecture, turning large containers into habitable shops and restaurants with a central park environment that can be used for playing, gatherings, concerts, lounging...what have you.  But the execution...whew...hit and miss.

Lots of things about Downtown Container Park drive me NUTS.  Let me count the ways:

1) PARKING - Damn.  If you don't like parking on the curb pointing to the middle of the street, you're screwed.  Don't take your expensive Lambo or vintage Camaro here unless you can park right next to the park.  I have no issues with the 'ghetto' part of town but beware.  Park your ride too far from the park and in the middle of near-darkness, you could be asking for a break-in.  Please don't leave valuables that are too tempting on your seat.  This is just par for the course and in no way do I endorse we get rid of all unsavory neighborhoods.  Respect people, always.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

2) CROWDS - Holy $hi+...wouldn't you know, Downtown Container Park is busy!  Friggin' busy!  Most of the daytime there is just WAY too much noise going on, people yapping, kids screaming, parents screaming, speakers blaring, singers singing, yada yada yada.  It's just too much!  Can this park be any more cramped?  I guess this is very par for the course as well since it is relatively brand new.  It's just cray-cray-crazy.  

3) SHOPS - Like hardly any.  There's not much to do in Downtown Container Park as of yet unless you love free random concerts (see #2 above).  Not too much in terms of retail or anything else for that matter.  Froo-froo shopping I don't do.  There are quite a bit of empty shop spaces.  Hello, arcade anyone?  A comic book store maybe?  Hell, I would settle for an Apple store at this point just so I could play with some gadgets, and I don't even have an iPhone (I show the Androids much love).

4) RESTAURANTS - It's probably just me just being impatient, but can we please have more eating choices?  What is this, only things Zappos employees eat?  A BBQ place, a semi-BBQ place, a jerky place, and a taco place.  Some candy and treats too.  But not even a pizza place within the park!  Or a hot dog!  I know it's no mall but a streamlined food court in the works eventually would be nice.

5) PRICES - Crapola, did the recession hit everyone except rich folk (actually, I think it did)?  Expensive!  Everything!  Food!  Drink!  Even a damn popsicle bar runs $6!  $3 for a bottle of water!  WTH?  This 'gourmet' trend can kiss my @$$, I swear!  Robbery I tell you!  But again, I am biased because:
      a.  I am poor
      b.  I am cheap
      c.  I am poor & cheap

But at least the park looks nice.  I like the playground area for kids (surrounded by Zappos security) where only animal allowed are llamas, grass is always nice, and I enjoy the hipster, eco-friendly vibe the place gives off.  I mean, the food trays used are mostly recyclable.  It is family friendly and very green.  But outside the walls, boy, you better be ready for reality to set in.  Downtown Las Vegas at night is no joke and is NOT for children.  That's probably why the park closes at 9 PM for anyone under 21.  Take heed!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,16,7,3,EnAEHF-llgq9oqEvmveqkg

Awesome waste of my time and gas and way to disappoint the kids.  Oh yeah, and we got to pay for parking.  No mention on the website, or social media about closing.

Fast forward a couple weeks and we decide to try one more time.  Meet friends, bring kids, etc, only to find out about height restrictions for half of the stuff.  My 6 year old girl is in tears because she can't go play with all the other kids.

Moral of the story: If you're going to arbitrarily close, post it somewhere so I don't waste my time to be turned away once we're there.  Also, if you have restrictions on your stuff, please post that as well so we know ahead of time.",Q48Own0lgS5QvpSUB_i-Jg,0,0,2,NOPuVC3nvdmcjyyKEUK_Eg

First, you have to park on the street meter. It was only $1 for every hour. I spent $2 for 2 hours. That's reasonable.

At the entrance, I was expecting to pay an admission fee which was none. That's a plus. As I entered, there's a huge playground in the middle with the tree house. My 12 year old loved the tree house. Aside from the playground, they had many different types of specialty stores from toys, socks, beef jerkey, candy shop, jewelry etc. They have 3 levels of different stores. I went into a lemonade store and got an instant fresh lemonade. It was made as I was waiting using some fancy machine. That's was the freshest lemonade I've tasted ever. The candy store there sells candies from the past. That was the coolest thing.

This place is very green. They have 3 different bins for recycling. They have clean bathrooms near the entrance. They have warm air in there so you don't freeze your butt during cold winter.

If you have children like me and you're in Las Vegas, it's worth visiting Downtown Container Park away from smoky and busy casinos. It's fun to just browse these specialty stores that are unique.",rYGi5DJ_54qeoWkkqB21jA,9,4,5,bP02s4Yy9L7cEyMGk6vqQw

Perhaps the website should be updated so that people aren't disappointed when they come looking for a certain store.

They are known to be an earth friendly park. They have a lot of art shops, sweet stores, and some other knick knack shops. I would say 85% of the shops are art stuff. Not a lot of shops I would go to. I do like the clubhouse right in the middle for the kids. This clubhouse can get so packed that there's a line to get in. When going upstairs, the stairs are super steep, so be careful. Another thing I liked, is that there's a stage in the back for a live band to play on, in front is grass that has big Legos and foam stuff for kids to play with and build stuff. There's some lounge chairs, well, to lounge on while you hang with your little ones and enjoy the sounds from the live band. I say, it's a pretty chill spot to hang out with both kids and adults. There are some bars where you can pick up some liquor while your lounging. 
There are 3 things that my husband and I were discussing about what would make this place unpopular. 
#1 - Today, the weather was nice at 72 degrees. In Nevada, it's perfect when you're in shaded area and extremely hot under the sun. I noticed, there wasn't a lot of shaded areas. They'll need to somehow put a cooling system in there. 
#2 - the grass area, where the kids play, I noticed a lot of the dirt and dead grass were flying everywhere. Not a good place to eat my halo halo at. And those who have allergies.... And in Vegas too... Not good for those with allergies. My daughter was complaining about that the whole time. 
#3 - well, it's in downtown. Not the safest place to take your kids and especially when it starts to get dark.

What a perfect idea. This is exactly what Downtown Las Vegas needed honestly. Downtown was lacking for a bit there and becoming sadly outdated but with this place opening and a couple other key places popping up after Downtown is totally the new Strip.

I much prefer Downtown to the Strip anyways, but places like Container Park make it 10x better.

If you come at night you can see the Praying Mantis that guards the entry spit fire in sync with songs and if you go inside climb to the top level of the containers and see it from a birds eye view!

Packed with cute local restaurants and shops filled with fun goodies. Complete with a playground for children (and adults) of all ages and its very own wedding chapel! We were lucky enough to catch a happy couple in the middle of their vows and it was perfect!

It's not laid out well.  There's an elevator on one side, but there's no bridge to connect the upstairs on both sides so you'd need to go downstairs to go to the other side.

Literally, this place is constructed and architect with container trailers. Within the park it consists of shops, restaurants, a toy store, a planetarium, and even a wedding chapel. When I read its family friendly I was looking forward in visiting here, since there aren't many places for kids in Sin City. 

There's a grass area there in front of the stage where live music is performed where kids can play. My son was building a fort with other kids using foamed Legos. While us parents are looking on, relaxing on love sofas. There's even a playground right down the middle of the courtyard and I believe there's a playhouse with slides attached to it that towers that spot, which looks fun, but a little overwhelming for smaller kids. 

In addition, Container Park is trendy, its comparable to what I'm starting to see here in Southern Cali of outdoor hangouts. This place has restaurants and they serve some alcohol, so it's not entirely kiddy. I went into Pinches Tacos here for a frozen margarita, but their credit/debit machine was down. I settled for an Angry Orchard at Big Ern's BBQ to chill outside with live music playing, so it was a relaxing experience. 

The Praying Mantis at the entrance way catches everyone's attention and it gets pretty intense when it periodically shoots out flames from its antennas.

We parked along the street, and paid the meter which was for all of the spaces on that side of the street. It accepted my credit card, and we parked for $2/hour. 

The praying mantis with fire coming from the antennae greeted us at the entrance...which is at the north end of the park. Okay, that was rather interesting, and I had to take a picture...along with everyone else who saw it. We scoped out the taco place first, which was just inside of the entrance and to the left. Meanwhile, I heard this really loud sound, and found out that it was  flames errupting out of the same antennae that we had just seen on the praying mantis. Now that was a conversation piece.

After eating, we walked around the area. It was a quick walk. Things here are rather expensive, so we just decided to window shop. The area was much smaller than we had anticipated, but it all looked pretty cool. Kids were having a lot of fun inside of the play area where there were bridges and slides among other things.

I checked out some if the stores and everything looks awesome. I had been eagerly anticipating Jessica Galindo's shop and was happy to find a leather business card holder. Score!

I heard about this place but I had to go check it out myself. It is a short 2 block walk from the Fremont Street experience.  My only advice is to keep your eyes open in the back of your head. It is a short but seedy walk. 

Once you arrive you are greeted by a giant metal bug at the entrance. It is made of recycled stuff. The whole mall is made of those metal shipping containers you see on boats, trains & trucks. I thought that was an incredible way to recycle and go green. It also reminded me of my days of being a child when I stacked blocks. I can not confirm this but the architect might be 5 years old. 

I was really happy to see this place get packed at lunch time which means the tourists are coming down here. There are plenty of outdoor tables and many people were eating at the various restaurants located here. There is a great outdoor stage which has various musical acts. I would check the website for up coming bands. 

There is an old caboose which has been turned into a barber shop. Bring the kids because I am sure they have never seen one of these in real life. So it's like visiting a museum while shopping and eating. 

I highly recommend getting out of the casino area and walking here. You will enjoy relaxing in the sun without the pressures of Vegas beating down on you. Trust me when I say, you will be happy you did.",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,19,11,5,T9rt9MZeAP9jzXnf2JKnsg

The Good: Most of the park is a playground for kids. It was the best playground I've seen at any Vegas park with several unique elements. I would have begged to come here all the time as a kid. The BBQ restaurant is decent and the Mexican place looked like a place worth trying on a future visit. Chillspot had yummy frozen treats and Jinju chocolates was a solid dessert choice as well. There is a good variety of shops for such a tiny plaza.

The Meh: The overall area isn't that big. This is about a 30 minute drive for me and I can't see regularly driving ""that far"" for what is offered. For Las Vegas the parking is too difficult. In full disclaimer I know that I'm spoiled here and compared to other city parking situations this is a breeze.

The bbq place smelled amazing, my friend got a ""hotlink"" and said it wasn't even spicy and the sweet tea wasn't even sweet whatsoever.

The giant praying mantis was super neat but I felt like my face was melting trying to watch it.

It's on Fremont and 7th can't miss it. The nicest people working here, it's SAFE, FUN, and there's something for everyone! Art, Shops, Restaurants, Bars, a Playground, Movie Nights, Concerts you name it it's here! Tons to see and do at the Container Park. It's clean, safe, fun, so creative and original! This is a kid friendly park, if you see any trouble get a security guard.

If you're down at the Container Park you should also check out Writers Block on 10th and Fremont for neat reads and cool chatchkis. Also there's a podcast called Downtown Podcast which is really fun too.

The energy and love at the Downtown Container Park makes me want to move Las Vegas. I love the up and coming vibe. Really fun and inspiring. You won't be able to miss it because of the giant praying mantis in the front. I love the playground, sounds weird, but it's adult size! The giant slide was closed when we went, but it's huge. I'll have to come back and get a better look at the shops and restaurants. Worth a visit, I hope you find yourself at the Container Park. 

Tips: It's safe as in they have security guards checking drinks and making people drink it or trash it before entering. It becomes 21 and up after 9pm. The security guards are locals who love their city, they are sincere good citizens who are really nice and just want to maintain a cool laid-back environment. Due to the fact that they are close to the wilder side of Fremont they have security on premises at all times to make sure no rowdy people come in.",0-9YVzOkL51P7rtlaLBp9g,5,2,5,23nMuDmdOswTxnDMDD1uGQ

I have to admit it's a LOT smaller than I had imagined but on the bright side, very creative and very cute. 

The main attraction the Saturday we showed up was the kid's treehouse (not only for kids :) ) the kids - including my 1 year old - loved it. I couldn't believe how well they designed it, it reminded me of Tarzan's treehouse - minus all of the Disney themed add ons if you've ever been to Disneyland. Super cute. 

We did pop in to a few shops but not many since the kids were not having walking around since you can see the playground from every angle. Walked over to the grassy area to play with the over sized blocks and they loved that as well.

Overall, I would bring the kids back, if we were in the area...but not make a drive across town for it.

Our daytime visit was good. We grabbed a couple Sasapops popsicles from their cart and rocked lazily on the wooden bench swing near the stage. In a city full of unique experiences, Container Park is perhaps the least like the rest of the adult entertainment in town. 

Most of the businesses were pricey, though, with only outdoor seating in absurdly hot weather. Since the high pricing seemed fairly universal, this may well have been small businesses compensating for their rent. 

At night, they light the praying mantis out front, and it becomes something out of Burning Man as the antennae burst aflame, ignited propane shooting into the dark sky. I happened to be there when a fire truck was sitting at the red light there. It honked each time the mantis blasted more propane. They played ""Shave and a Haircut"" back and forth. It was freakin' cool. 

The mantis lends its own thing to the bright, vintage lights of East Fremont. At the very least I'd say you should see the Container Park for it, with the Catalyst Dome changing colors behind it, at night.",-0IiMAZI2SsQ7VmyzJjokQ,15,12,3,vCUBVUdSr3HRNc2c02yloQ

Vegas is the worst possible place to raise a toddler but I try to make due. When the container park opened I was excited to see it. I was excited about the different shops and restuarants and couldn't wait to walk down and experience it. Especially since it's about a 10 min walk from where I live. The day after Christmas I decided to walk down and check it out with my son. When we got there we noticed 2 guys standing out front of the entrance kinda like dorky bouncers. I didn't know why they were just standing there but they said hello and we walked by into the park. I was in awe. It's so clean, chic, but yet it has this artistic feel without being too annoyingly hipsterish. The entire park is made out of recycled shipping containers and the best part is that they actually had an amazing playground right smack in the middle of it. Wasting no time my son promptly undid himself from his stroller and took off running for the play area. The slide is pretty epic. The slide is freaking 4 stories high. I kid you not. There's all these foam shapes and hula hoops for the kids to play with and it's cleaner than Disneyland. After an hour or so of playing we'd worked up an appetite so we headed over to one of the restaurants. There was a long line but the food was definately worth the wait. Bravo Zappos.

We arrived around 4pm and my husband wasn't too thrilled about being downtown.  There is still a lot of uncertainty when you are there and we have yet to be downtown without an incident from a drunk or otherwise intoxicated stranger.  But he agreed to go.

They have valet but since there was parking on the street, we parked in a metered parking spot and were quickly entering the Container Park.

What did we love:  Well, we loved the security - gates and visual security guards.  We loved the design - artistically pleasing to the eye.  We loved the playground and building area - encouraging creativity in our kids and we loved the hang out atmosphere that we so miss from living in the city.

With outdoor seating, lots of restaurants and bars and a stage - this park was alive.  People were socializing and generally having a great time.

We didn't spend a lot of time in the stores, but they all looked eclectic and interesting.  We did participate in a drum circle on our way out of the park, which was a first for all of us.

Why only 4 stars?  And, really this isn't any fault of the park.  But, it is still downtown and of course we were forced to strategically navigate ourselves to our vehicle because of  very drunk and disorderly men on the 1/2 block walk from the park to our car.

Container Park as definitely earned it's name because the stores are literally freight containers stacked up in an artsy kind of way. There is a large playground for kids in the middle and three stories of boutique stores. There are a handful of restaurants and drink places as well. Simply for the innovation, this is a cool sight to see! The staff that work here are also very friendly! The A/C in these stores are also very nice as the weather in Vegas can get kind of hot. 

Cons: Most of the containers (particularly stores) are really REALLY small so the selection is very minimal. The stores are definitely specialty stores so there are many stores that probably do not apply to your interest (though there is probably one that does). The parking can be a pain as the lot across charges a lot but the street parking is reasonable. 

Overall: This is a fun and innovative place to walk around and check out local stores and artists! Highly recommended as a source of entertainment outside of the Las Vegas strip!",shux03KqDQumOn_lzTwHeQ,1,0,4,320P--c0Qkv99Sx9QwxndA

Yesterday, I finally got to taste the magic. Just like Disneyland, once you step inside, you are propelled into a completely different world - one that faces inward, shut away from the sketchy looking surroundings. Don't think Town Square. Don't start comparing. Just immerse yourself in what this place has to offer. It is what it is, a park, and people are expected to enjoy this place for its laid-back atmosphere, not exactly shop - although that is an option too!

The first thing you'll notice are the stacked shipping containers shelled with glass, revealing an artsy cluster of cafes, boutiques and galleries. Small local businesses line the first, second and third floors connected by stairs and continuous blocks of containers that would eventually lead you to a nice comfy sofa or table to sit on. Overlooking the balconies is the cute tree house which I was so tempted to go on and try the slides but I was too stoked with the galleries to even go for it. 

As you approach the back of the park, you will see a luscious green playground for kids to enjoy. With all the security they had there, I may trust the place enough to leave kids there (one day) while I go sit in one of the sofas by the cafe patio, overlooking them of course! Maybe. Still, I could not fully judge until I get to play in the playground myself! That's on my next to-do when I visit again soon. 

There's the industrial vibe it gives, urban mixed in with a Europhean flair of sophistication and great attention to detail.  That mantis up front immediately caught my eye because of its appearance at First Friday the two times I went. There's music as you walk and when the sun goes down, strings of lights leave a dreamy glow to the park. 

The Downtown project is reforming Vegas into a family-friendly cultural city, showing off its capacity to be more than a gambling hall. Win-win? I think so. Now we have our little piece of San Francisco. Environmentally friendly (separate waste disposals for different products), classy with emphasis on creating a vibe through art and music, hip people, unique concept.

The prices were a little high in some retail shops but the jewelry store was reasonably priced and they had cute and original items.Tip: not many choices of eateries, at least family friendly inviting, we ate before we came. 
 I love that Vegas (Zappos) has moved into the 21st century of family entertainment and social gathering. I've lived here for 18 years And places like these are much needed in this town. Yes it's Small but that's what makes it nice, especially when you're trying to keep an eye on your kids. It's not too overwhelming. This is not like the Grove in LA or Townsquare this is something different and unique. 
I like the whole ""green"" thing they have going on with the  containers and recycling bins all around the park. While sitting at a table watching the kids  one of the parents decided to ""light up"" and security told her that there was no smoking allowed. This made me happy. Yes you're outside but no smoking is allowed where the kids are playing. :) 
As we were ready to leave, around dusk, we were exiting & the employees of the park brought out drums and musical instruments (placed in a circle around the emcee) for all to participate in their musical serenade to the praying mantis, fire came out of its antennas.

That being said I have 2 minor complaints about Container Park. 
1: Parking...sucks. Yes they offer valet parking but if you like to park your own car wear comfortable shoes as you're going to be walking quite a bit to get to it. 
2: It's not big enough! Container Park needs to be 2x the size. 

While Container Park has had some of the original businesses move out, once the management team gets the right mix of shops and galleries in place it's going to be a big draw for Downtown Las Vegas for many years to come. But I was pleased with the shops that are there now. Pricing can be considered a little high but you don't come out of the stores, restaurants, or bars and leave feeling like your wallet got burned.

Container Park is one of a kind, it's a really sweet place to check out during the day AND night. Bring kids during the day to play in the extensive playground they have in the center of the park. There is a good amount of small shops to pop into and browse, everything from glassware to jewelry to swimwear, etc. And if you find stair access to the second level, you can actually walk in the Container Park sign! Looks really cool at night too. Lighting is great and everything looks very modern. It's quite clean and there's usually security lounging around too. There's a giant metal mantis by the entrance to greet you. By nightfall, it is illuminated by changing colored lights and looks even more majestic. I hear it spews fire every now and then but I have yet to see it! 

If you're in town, definitely make a stop here. Careful with parking in the lots though, they're on top of what goes on with parking and all.. Make sure you pay for parking at the kiosk of the parking lot. And keep track of when you need to return. 

Love Container Park and the area it is in! It is away from the super crazy crowds and busy-ness of the Strip but you still get the excellent Vegas experience.",EfnzVzqWJUVEv8ft3fW2sQ,1,2,5,VNmqqWTMjLSE18N5Ov2PYA

A fantastic idea to repurpose large containers and transform them into a park for all to enjoy.

In the center of the park is a giant tree house playground and other activities for children.

In the back of the park is a barber shop train with a performing stage and large play area for children with several seating options for parents.

We didn't eat or shop, so not much to say except that they're all very small. Seems to be an issue when the park is really crowded like it was on this Saturday afternoon.

It wasn't too busy when we went, but I'm sure it'll pick up as more people make it the new hipster-dive spot and the live music is enjoyable to a refreshing beer/ warm cup of hot chocolate (whatever soothes your mood).

4744287,2014-01-28,5,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"As of now I'm not sold on the Container Park.  My biggest problem is that it feels too enclosed and private.  It wants to make Downtown Las Vegas seem cool and cultured; but only if you're inside the Container Park!  Only one entrance & exit?  I get carded to walk into here?  No outside food or drink?  Kids are allowed, but have to leave by 9:00pm?  It's great that they've tried to create a family friendly environment, but once you leave you're quickly reminded that you're still on the corner of Fremont and 7th.

My favorite aspect of the Container Park is that it focuses on showcasing local businesses.  There seems to be a decent mix of retail, food, and drink spots, along with spaces reserved for art galleries.  Be sure to stop by JoJo's Jerky.  Later at night a curfew goes into effect, which allows adults to have fun on the playground.  Neat, but not really something I feel needs a repeat visit.  First time visitors, though, be sure to check out the ninja game and three story slide!

It's a neat concept to be able to walk into a conex and be greeted by sales staff and retail goods instead of construction materials and boxes, but I can't say that the Container Park is a must-see.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,8,5,3,0Sw7vNgBON7C23fiYUe07A

I don't see the value in paying to park and hang out here. Yes, people may come here for a drink or two but who wants to go somewhere to relax with a park of screaming kids?

4934374,2014-02-17,0,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"I absolutely love the total concept and vision of the Container Park. It is totally cool, chic, and a magnet for the hip crowd that is becoming the cliche place to be that is the Zappo's environment of Downtown.

Here are my thoughts:

a.  Concept - 5 stars - The idea to stack ocean containers and retrofit them to an urban shopping and dining experience is freaking awesome!  What a way to go and to create something special and unique.

b.  Restaurants - 3 stars - Plenty of bars and restaurants, however, on a busy day like today, they are both crowded and difficult to navigate. We were hungry and spying several places and finally said, the wait was not worth it, nor the difficult navigation.  So we opted to walk around a bit and then leave. The  issue here is that a Subway shop has more space to stay and order than the restaurants here.  The great thing is the variety, the style, the ambiance, the certain je ne sais quoi that makes the place so cool to be at. 

c.  Size - 3 star - For an urban environment and high density living style that downtown is attempting to be, my question is, why so small? the magnitude of the place is such a small scale. This will be great for nights when you have it crammed with the night life scene, but during the day, it should have plenty more space and places for people to hang.

d.  ShopChoice  3 star -- I thought that the choices here for shops were a bit odd. All cool boutiques, but where is the demand?  No one was carrying bags.  No one was buying stuff in the store. Every store I went into, it was a bunch of workers and sales staff. Hardly any buyers, but some lookers.

Summer - I wonder if they will have some kind of foliage or sun shades during the summer. This place is 100% designed to be an outdoor place and on this day when it was 80 degrees, it was not exciting to be out in the sun with no where to sit or relax.

This place would be so awesome if they turned it into an eating mecca and put tables and chairs everywhere and had a focused vision.  For now, it all looks awesome, but just seems a bit ""off"".

check the place out and enjoy it.  Be careful if you bring your kids.  By 9:00 pm, only 21 and over.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,0,3,piTYOnv3b-McEe_SbwuhxQ

What a refreshing establishment to add to downtown Vegas.  It reminds me of the cute outdoor malls in Southern California (think The Camp for example).  But with a twist since it's made out of containers, and this park has things to playyyyy with!

Legos, slides, foam blocks, Neos, fire-spitting mantis?!  The kid in me just wet my adult pants.

That mega slide is best done at night.  It'll take you on whips and turns and leave you with a whiplash you'd never expect.  Legos and foam blocks?  Stack them up.. then plow thru them with your fierce moves, since we all know you're the next MMA fighter.  Just make sure the kids don't cry or you'll be dealing with their parents.

Not to mention the array of food and booze!!  All these bars available one after another.. We had some local taps and the lobster grilled cheese at bin 702 and let's just say.. all I heard was ~ahhh~  voices of angels singing.

In front is a heart structure full of locks, which kinda is a rip off of Paris's Locks of Love Bridge, but ehh.. what else in Vegas isn't a rip off of some iconic spot huh?

DT Container Park is great for modern-day kid (ie.  grown-up kid).  Games, food, booze.  But putting all these bars in such close proximity to a playground?  Now that's the most dangerous game of them all..",HDm5BIdudbpRmAiOU0jOSQ,9,9,5,j3fWM9grvmYyWnyDc5KFTA

The current mutation that DTLV has been overtaking, specially with the addition of the new Container Park has definitely rekindled my flame for this debaucherous whore-town :)

Container Park is like the mini version of Town Square.  Reminiscent of Lego blocks stacked on top of each other are the shipping containers which house boutique stores, restaurants and bars.  Each unit is about 200+ sq ft, so you can imagine how orgasmic one can get if 5 other individuals were to join you one container.  Nonetheless, the shipyard of containers expresses its own sense of individuality, offers quality in their product, creates an urban atmosphere  and makes DTLV all the more approachable.  My favorite part about Container Park?  Unfortunately it's not the giant flaming lazer-eyed metal mantis.. It's the kick-a$$ lounge areas on the 2nd floor overlooking the entire park.  The place is thankfully family-friendly equipped with a center playground and a three story tree house for the kiddos and it's also adult-friendly with its convenient wine bar and beer station so we all have the opportunity of becoming white-girl wasted.

The architecture of this place is the most unique aspect of it. The brightly-colored shipping containers serve with style and function and allow small businesses and pop-up shops to have their own distinct space. The variety of little boutique shops was plentiful and when you need a break, there are a good amount of food, drink, and dessert options. Plus, there are a good amount of beautiful metal sculptures that greet you as you walk in the park. 

The park itself has a huge and impressive kids playground in the middle. I was really tempted to hit up some of those intense slides, but I likely would have been kicked out. It's a child's dream! 

When you get to the front, there was a string quartet jamming to some current popular songs that was projected through speakers throughout the park. Keeps the whole place alive!

We went on a unusually very cool and overcast day in August.  So everything was comfortable as we sat and enjoyed our shaved ices.  The little play area seemed pretty cool with some game that everyone was trying, even the adults.  Speaking of adults, kids aren't allowed in the play area unless they have an adult with them.  Strange...usually it's adults not allowed in play areas unless they have a kid.  Oh well whatever.

They do have some mister/fan combos that probably really help during those super hot days.  You know, the ones that we missed while in Vegas?  Yeah those.

Honestly I probably wouldn't go back unless I had a particular business I wanted to go to.  This is one of those...you've been once, you don't need to go again.  But you do at least have to go once.  It's pretty neat.",LkXNQQaIc5yrKu9Ap87RrA,2,1,3,kYg5r4D5FuvmzmGrNiwLxQ

The Container Park, located downtown, is a family friendly place that attracts locals andtourists alike. The stores there are more like boutiques. No chain stores owned by a mega corporation here, just independently owned small businesses. 

At the entrance is a giant metal preying mantis. At night it takes on a new life by lighting up and shoots flames out of its antennas. This is something I'd expect to see at the Burning Man. Through the entrance, you'll see a collective of small shops in what lookslike repurposed shipping containers. In the center ofit all is a decent sized play area for kids. The top of a climb & slide structure is about 3 stories tall, but that top level may be subject to closure at times. Towards the back of the park is a stage where bands play. 

The Dome near the entrance is like a small planetarium, where the entire round dome acts as a movie screen. There are shows for kids as well as adults. Showtimes and lineups are on their website. Currently, Groupon has a deal so take a look if you like saving deniro. 

Shops here vary from hot dogs to truffles, a tatoo parlor, clothing boutiques, kettle popcorn and many more. This is a great place for out-of-towners to visit, and locals to bring the family. 

Worth checking out! I plan to go back on my next trip. 

Notes: 
* Paid parking along the streets surrounding the park. Mind your time or get a ticket, like the car parked next to me.
* Security guards are walking arond, especially the play area.
* Currently, Groupon has a deal for tickets to The Dome, so take a look if you like saving deniro.

Let me start off with the parking. In a word, confusing. There is limited parking and be prepared to pay a few dollars. Not the end of the world, but just a heads up. It's nice that they have meters that you can pay with your debit card. No more rummaging through your purse or cup holder for quarters. 

Container park is actually made out of shipping containers. It is three stories tall in some places and surrounds a 50 foot tall ""treehouse"" that has several slides. The Park is definitely a family friendly place. It was funny because I kinda felt like I was missing a kid. lol (cause I don't have any) The whole courtyard area in between the shops is made just for youngins. They also have an amazing stage with a grass lawn in front of it. They had a live band playing which was awesome. Because they have speakers throughout the park, you can hear it all over. I could have sat there all day and just listened. 

There are a number of shops already established even though it hasn't been open very long. Lots of really interesting restaurants too! It was hard to choose which place to eat, but we all agreed on Big Ern's BBQ. Very delicious! Upstairs, I found the Lil Art Bodega to be the coolest place! I loved the art in there. If I could afford it, I totally would buy their Hello Kitty piece. I settled for a cool James Dean sticker instead. We also checked out the Vapor Loft. They were really nice guys and very knowledgeable. 

There are several other shops I didn't get the chance to go inside, but I noticed they had a Barber shop behind the stage which looked to be made out of an old train caboose. They also have a taco shop and even a Vegan cafe. Also, if you're in the mood for sweets, they have a cupcake shop and a ice cream shop.

I cannot wait to go back to Container Park!! They have something for everyone there. It is a great spot Downtown to take your kids or just yourself for a nice relaxing day of music, food and shopping.

On it's site, they look for ""businesses that will provide the kinds of services that Downtown residents need to create a live, work, play environment in our neighborhood. We prefer owner-operated businesses that reflect the unique personality of the emerging Downtown rather than chains or franchises.""  I really like that preface.  

When you arrive, you'll notice a very aesthetically pleasing sign that says Container Park.  To the left of the sign is a huge metal sculpture of a pray mantis that shoots fire from it's antennas.  What a focal point!  When you enter the center, you'll notice the middle of the courtyard is a playground for kids, slides, building blocks and more.  This park includes locally owned business like boutiques, galleries, fashion stores, bars, restaurants and more! In the back of the park, there's a stage for local artists to perform and allows a very entertaining area for the various customers.  At all times of the day!

There weren't really as many options as I was expecting - the whole place was smaller than I had imagined based on the descriptions my friends gave on the car ride to downtown, but I'm still really glad we went.

A couple friends got hot dogs and one other and myself went to Big Ern's BBQ (which I'll review separately). Luckily, it was around 10:30pm and we were able to get in just before the restaurants closed at 11.

I'd like to come back sometime earlier in the evening, since a lot of things were closed (like the candy store, that bummed me out a lot!).

A great spot in Downtown Las Vegas to bring the little kids and big kids (adults)! It's a one stop eat with a variety of foodie spots, boutiques & shops to choose from. 

We always hit up Pinches Tacos, Chillspot by SasaSweets - for the shave ice and pops, & the Kettlecorn shop for that fresh made lemonade. There are a lot of tables and chairs to eat & lounge outside. 

There's a playground with a bad ass slide and a fake grass play area for kids with a stage for live music, a few couches, benches and blocks for the kids to build their own creations. 

When you're inside the shops (some are very tiny -- fits 5 customers at most) you can't tell that it's built from shipping containers. Very creative and innovative. 

There's still a lot of restaurants here we have yet to try and look forward to enjoying. 

** Note: I hope they add a misting system throughout the park for the hot summer months. There's a few near the stage, but nothing around the tables outside of restaurants.

So for the kids... they have this awesome 3 story treehouse with lots of little nooks and crannies that are going all over.

Container Park has become the focus for so many 5k fun runs held downtown and is doing much to become a focal point for the community as well. Small beer fests, live music events, movie nights, and holiday celebrations are regularly held at Container Park. 

I fell head over heels with Downtown Container Park the moment I laid eyes on it. A fire-breathing praying mantis greets visitors at the entrance. 'Downtown Rangers' stand at the ready to make sure the riff raff is kept out. Container Park is literally built out of colorful shipping containers. Trees line the park and cute stringed lights are strung about. A decent sized playground is in the center of the park. There's plenty of seating available near restaurants and around the playground. 

What I love about Container Park is that it features 100% local businesses. Each business is unique. Mention worthy restaurants include vegan eatery Simply Pure, Cheffini's for fancy hotdogs, JinJu Chocolates, and Oak & Ivy for crafty cocktails. 

Container Park is best enjoyed at a leisurely pace. Try to go at a time that coincides with an event. Grab a bite to eat, find a place to sit, and just relax and people watch!

There is one main entrance area and there is a turnstile exit that is broken (boo..., we had to walk back to to the main entrance for not knowing) There is a public restroom by the left side of the entrance. Think of outdoor gas station bathroom but a LOT cleaner. 

The focal point here is the treehouse. It's great for kids to climb and discover the insides of this fake treehouse. On the far end there's a great lawn area and oversized legos. 

As for the shops, you can tell this place was made for the kids when you see Ice cream, candy, popcorn type shops all huddled together side by side. We got to try ChillspotLV and it did not disappoint. (Will be on a separate review) II also love how they have separate garbage containers. One for recycles, one for regular, it's funny they have a compartment for ""weird stuff""

What I didn't really love is that you have to pay for parking here. I mean really? Isn't there enough free parking around this area? I guess I can relate people would just park here overnight making it miserable for tourists like us to find parking.

Due to time constraints I was limited on how long I could stay and didn't get to check out every shop, but what I saw was enough to know that Container Park is step in the right direction of trying to reclaim and rebrand a ""blighted"" area or better yet, be an oasis in a desert.

This spot has the coolest tree house/playground area EVER.  The treehouse is about 4 stories and has 3 slides.... and on it I rediscovered the joy of slides!  The playground is good for kids of all ages and very safe.  Security guards are sweet but watchful and they make sure all people follow the rules and don't abuse the space. When we went during the day there was even a base player. 

The container park is a great place for kids during the day but turned into an adult hipster hang out at night. The christmas lights that are strung around the area give a great ambiance to the area. The area is basically a great place to explore.  We went into a couple of great local boutiques and looked around.  There were some places to eat also as well as dessert shops.  

When we came back to the container park at night, we checked out Bin 702.  The cheese plate was amazing and so was the glass of Malbec I enjoyed while walked around the park. Yes, it is a little pricey but there was wonderful service and the place was awesome.

The area is trying to be a zero-waste facility- an amazing goal for a city that didn't seem to be too eco-friendly.  There are stations that tell you how to recycle and divide your trash.

The art there is diverse.... ranging from murals to a beautiful heart sculpture and a gigantic, kind of scary praying mantis that randomly sprays fire.  Super awesome!  I think the containers are also works of art: the windows, vibrant colors, the way they are stacked, etc.  

It is definitely worth checking this place out to get a break from the strip and get your does of art and culture.  Perfects for bringing the kids during the day also!",dPLaY-t4BF7KZI9SXABg5A,4,5,5,PrF9qU_l8AxvKR1D7_JPbQ

No ""go ahead and sit outside and we'll be right there"".  Nothing.  We went outside and sat at a table for about 5-10 minutes watching the waitress serve some other groups while she completely ignored us.  And yes - she did see us.  And no - it was literally the two of us and two, maybe three, other small groups.  We wondered if we were going n the wrong place?  If so, say something!!  So, we tried at Oak and Ivy next.  Same thing.  Dude behind the bar was COUNTING money, looked at us then went back to counting.  Again, no hello or anything.  I started to wonder if you needed a code word or something to get served in these places.  Our last stop was Pinches Tacos.  Ignored again.  And let me clarify - NONE of these places were busy.  So, out we went to one of the fifty bars along Fremont where yes - we got served.  Yay!!  Unless you know the secret to service at this place, don't expect any.

It's a playground for adults! The first game is similar to kung fu panda game where you hit all the circles that light up. Then you walk a few more steps and there are tons of building blocks. A few more steps and you are walking up stairs to slide down tall slides! It was dark when we came so I was a tad nervous about sliding. These slides are legit though - you might be afraid from the speed. 

Besides the playground, they also have a bench swing, a grassy area, comfy seats, bathrooms downstairs and upstairs, tiny shops throughout and amazing paintings located upstairs with a view of the entire park.",UKU5x7fgNWzzdpCh3PqS0A,1,1,5,QfUuE6gJxuCsz_-nkmmahw

My review is more for the kid friendliness of it. It is extremely kid friendly. It has this great tree house playground for the kiddos to climb and play and run and play and climb and...okay, you get it. Parents, just know you MUST accompany your child. The attendants will not let you just let your child run in then for you to walk off. Strollers aren't allowed in the actual playground so designate your significant other to be on stroller watch, or just park it on the side as you enter the playground. 

Aside from the playground, there is a turfed area where kids can run around. They have these oversized foamed building blocks for kids to build on this turf area. There is also a wall you can write or draw on with the chalk provided...or what's left of this chalk. Also, there's a small store that sells toys and other novelty items. This store is certainly not stroller friendly in my opinion. 

All-in-all, it's incredible amongst the downtown life to the whiskey lounges in the vicinity and restaurants...they remembered that there are adults with children and children need entertainment too. What's even better is it is completely kid friendly and FREE! In the summer...It does *suck* to be out there so it's not somewhere I'd prefer or think of bringing my kids to. However, people on vacay, surely it'd be an awesome find. Note, they do have mists to cool down. 

There's so much more I could brush on, but I felt the need to type more.of the kid part of it. Just know, though it is kid friendly...I don't think the restaurants are as kid friendly because these are containers and there might be food that just won't peek your kids interest.

5574060,2014-05-17,0,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"This place is like an adults playground. I absolutely adore it and wish I could go more often. I live in Henderson, so it's kind of a treck up to the Freemont street area, but every once and awhile I just NEED to go there. So what exactly is the Container Park besides for sheer brilliance and awesome? I'm glad you asked. It's about a block south of Freemont Street, pas the Griffin, Insert Coins, and those other places that I never really pay attention to. On the right side of the street, you are greeted by a GIANT FIRE BREATHING PREYING MANTIS. No, really, you are. After the sun goes down, at least. Reasons why this place is awesome reason 1. That mantis is so cool. It's controlled by a person that presses the flame thrower button on it at various points in time. You can cheer them on for extra fire! Yay! Fire!

During the day, it's a good place for families to bring their kids too, since they have a free playground area complete with blocks, interactive stuff, and a giant slide in the middle. Great fun for the whole family, really. There are also a variety of small shops made out of, well, containers. If you feel like having a cold one on a hot day, which happens in Vegas, there are a few bars scattered around to quench your thirst as well. The area isn't exactly BIG per say, but the Container Park manages to pack a punch in the area it was given. They also have a stage with live music from time to time. Oh, and by the stage, there are couches that you can sit on, as well as balls you can kick around. Awesome, right? Yeah, awesome. 

So the fun part of the review. After dark, it becomes an adult only area. That's right kids, no entry after a certain time period. You have to be 21 or older to enter the container park after 9 p.m.? (I think it's something like that) and that's when the fun happens. Sure, some of the shops are closed, but the bars and places to eat are still available. Don't worry, the playground is also still open! You know you want to have a few beers and go down the 3 container story high slide. You know you do. I did and it was amazing. Hanging out with a bunch of adults that like to have fun and play with blocks, balls, and slide down slides is probably the best thing ever. Add some alcohol to the mix and it just becomes the best experience in the world. 

If you have children, I recommend coming here during the day and let them ride on the slide, or heck join them! If you are an adult, I recommend coming here at night and riding on the slide! I may like the slide, a little. Maybe. Either way, the mantis, the atmosphere, and the slide are just 3 of the many awesome reasons you should come and visit the container park. Oh and live bands. I mentioned that too, right? 

Now I want to go there again.",1hJVutieYDBwGx8INWv3IA,3,4,5,v-KKY2niRBUOOA5mfnkX5g

It wasn't too busy that first time, as it was a December Friday morning before the holidays.  The second visit was today, January 2nd, 3:00pm, accompanied by my two little cousins, 4 and 6-year-old brothers, and my 17-year-old son.  Today the park was a beehive of activity with winter break still happening.  There were kids running helter skelter all over the tree house and adjacent playground; the little cousins were in heaven.  They immediately ran away from me once we entered the playground/tree house area, which is nicely guarded by a security person at the gate.  This way, kids cannot escape the area without someone watching, resulting in the worst thing ever, a lost child.  Most parents/guardians were either in the playground or right outside of it, keeping keen eyes on all the activity, which was plenty.  The teen spent the time exploring the shops of the park and making fun of the hipsters.  He tried to teach me how to detect said hipsters and I think it has to do with clothes and visible tattoos, but I'm still not sure.  For a breather, the boys and I went to ChillSpot by Sasapops, which is conveniently located right next to the playground.  Smoothies for the boys and halo-halo for me, then it was back to more running, jumping, and playing.  The grand finale was a group of drummers outside the entrance of the park.  They provided bongos, tambourines, cowbells, and other percussion instruments for kids to play in a circle, led by one energetic drummer in the middle.  The giant metal grasshopper sculpture out front spewed fire from its antennae and that added to the show.

What is Container Park? A nice looking place for food trucks to have a ""brick and mortar"" (or shipping container) location and a bunch of irrelevant, overpriced boutiques that nobody is buying anything from.

I would be absolutely shocked if this place was actually turning profits in the next few years, if it will still be open. Apart from the eating establishments, the stores are not geared toward local people who hang out Downtown or tourists that stay on Fremont. 

I'm not sure what anyone was thinking putting in so many random boutiques - places that have two of the same item, say 2 trendy skirts by an unknown label in two different sizes for $260 a piece. These aren't Fremont Street prices. If you want to charge that, go to Crystals. That's too pricy for even Fashion Show. The stores that aren't selling clothes for whatever reason thought it would be a good idea to try to sell their Etsy-kitsch crafts here and pay rent to do so. 


Walking past every store, you see the same thing - an empty store with a cashier looking down into their lap while on their phone. I can tell these places are making soooo much money to put back into the downtown economy. PSH. I feel like I'm the only person who can see how gimmicky this Downtown Project is.

So... while I guffaw at this nonsense, everyone else can keep on talking about how great it is.

Parking. No. Nope. No. It's metered street parking. Get out of here. So ridiculous.

I've seen grown men with handlebar mustaches sitting by themselves on the fake lawn playing with legos. There's stuff for kids to do, but after 9, it's just a bunch of hipsters being hipsters. Ugh.

Before 9, you can't kick your way through the strollers and babies running through the legs of adults carrying beers. It's weird. Why are you taking your kids to basically an adult hangout space?

These drunk adults tend to be the ones going up and down the tube slides, even before it's 21+, so keep an eye out on your kids so they don't get squashed on the toys by some chick in thick black glasses with a chest piece tattoo of cats while she wears a rockabilly sundress.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,15,12,2,HlMy9aOkNqJiXDb-fTtlyw

     There are three levels of stores of assorted items, trinkets and foods.  They all seem to be constructed from old shipping containers. There is also a way cool playground in the middle, and one of the stores is in an old train at the far end of the park. Which is also cool. As I wandered around the stores however, I discovered that I didn't really need anything from any of them.  They were all kinda earthy crunchy hippy things. If I hadn't just eaten my fill of donuts, I might have tried some of the restaurants in here.   
     There was a meat and hot sauce store. That one was interesting and the most likely one I would buy from.  But the giant bug, the way cool playground and old train. Super cool. I'd be back to see the mantis spew fire into the sky.

The playground in the middle is really cool and using train cars in the back is an awesome idea. The grass; however, looks really fake and feels really cheap. Why even do this? This is Las Vegas. It's in the desert. Go with that... Use that as your theme.

It's located in downtown so you know this place has a lot of culture. Outside is the fire preying mantis which has been seen multiple times at First Friday. There's only one entrance so you can't really miss it. They don't allow outside drinks from what I heard.

There's a big Tarzan-esque playground in the middle with ""imaginative playground"" materials scattered across the play area in front.

Everything is overpriced. I went into every shop, every food place, every boutique, and just couldn't justify it. I bought a pair of the cheapest, most decent-looking pair of earrings I could find - at Forever21, they'd cost $5 - FOR $15 - but *only* because one of mine fell out and I needed to put something in there.

I ate at some sandwich place and paid $8 for a grilled cheese. Hello, I just moved from NEW YORK CITY, and if I were to get a sandwich for $8, I CAN ASSURE YOU, it would be more than just two pieces of bread and some cheese. They would at least put a tomato on it, or some lettuce, or some SPICES??? Or SOMETHING to give it some flavor. Carmelized onions? Hell, I'd even take some raw red onions. Or chopped up raw garlic. Just do something to pizzazz it for THAT price. I still am in disbelief I paid for this, if you couldn't tell, and this happened two days ago.

(For reference - this is what I can expect for **$7** - IN MANHATTAN, in the LOWER EAST SIDE, one of NYC's most expensive neighborhoods, at a grilled cheese-specific restaurant called, ""Little Muenster.""

THE WORLD'S BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICH
Crispy Pork Belly/Soft Omelette/Gruyere/Gouda/Kewpie/Amy's Roll. 

AND BREAD FROM AMY'S. I rest my case.)

I am hopefully for the pork n' beans place and the taco place, which I have yet to try. The BBQ was fucking awful; I have no idea how that place is even in business or why they'd want them to be a part of this new-and-upcoming attraction.

The slides were cool, mostly because they were free. And the grassy patch area where bands can play - also free. But I'm scared to see how much it's going to cost to go to the *cool, hip* barbershop that's about to open. Yeesh.

All in all, it's a cool spot for people to walk around in, look at stuff, and take their kids. It *is* a glorified outdoor mall, after all.

HOWEVER, that being said, this is NOT a place meant to cater to the LOCAL Las Vegas downtown-er. As far as I know, from living here for as long as I have, most people here work in service, or work for a start-up... which means they make not enough money to spend $20 on a lame-ass sandwich and a beer, plus tax and tip. People don't go to Commonwealth for a reason - why would I want to pay $10 for a BEER... OFF THE STRIP? What? I thought I left the meatpacking district 3,000 miles behind me?

I'll probably come to sit and read a book (assuming that I don't constantly run into all of the 50 people I know in this city because, well, where else is there to go?) but probably won't buy anything else any time soon. MAYBE a taco, cuz a girl's gotta eat.

Just be true to who you are, Vegas, and stop trying to be other places. It's making me very, very depressed.

*****EDIT*****

Must apologize to shop owners for saying their items are overpriced. Should be obvious that it is NOT their fault, but WHOEVER decided to make the rent at the container park $9/sq ft!

My wife has been trying to talk me into selling our house and moving into a shipping container. Crazy right! I thought so myself. She has shown me videos of shipping containers that had been turned into homes, really nice ones too. I was still not buying it (literally)

After visiting Container Park, I'm considering it now. Why? Because I'm so impressed with how they transformed shipping containers into amazing shops, restaurants and a playground with a huge treehouse in the center of this park. Wow. 

The Treehouse is made from shipping containers (and recycled material) as well. What an awesome treehouse. My son went up and down it for almost 2 hours. It's super creative and goes up 3 or 4 floors. They had a slide on the top floor. A kid's dream treehouse for sure. 

The playground had some big foam pieces of varying shapes and size that the kids can use to build bridges, house or a pretend spaceship that my son built. 

The playground also had an electronic touch game. Eight post with two lights each (top and bottom). The lights would flash either red or green and you're suppose to touch it as it randomly flashes either color. You get points for touching the lights and it kept score. Great for game for the kids to play individually or as a team. 

The best part of the playground was security. It is fenced in with only one way in or out and it was monitored by a staff member of the park. A+ in my book. 

Shops and restaurants flank the playground/ treehouse. Three levels on each side with an eclectic variety. BBQ joint, hot dog stand, tacos, clothing stores, unique toy store, even an art gallery and a lot more. Grownups won't get bored here either. 

Entrance: if you see a giant praying mantis, you found the park. Lol. 

Parking was easy. They have a lot across the street. It's a pay to park place. Very reasonably priced. 

The park itself is free. No entrance fee, another A+ in my book. 

It was cold in late December and the heaters they had all over the park helped.

They have so many cute little shops and eateries. 
It's conveniently located to Fremont and in the middle of the newly renovated downtown. A hipster vibe that I couldn't love more. The play place is fun for kids of all ages. They even do Family movie nights! I'm so glad I gave this place another shot. We'll be going at least once a month..... Just because.",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,1,0,5,GcCr796l_1Mgeh1YZXgH9w

We went later one night so the shops were closed and only a few people left hanging out. Although from what I have heard, these boutique shops are way out of the norm selling silly items at ridiculous high prices. Um, no thanks!

I have to agree that there are some really cool and fun photo ops to be had here. It is pretty much just a very small outdoor shopping venue and some places to eat. The star of the show is the Tree house with slides for the kids to enjoy during the day and adults after hours.

In my opinion Container Park has a huge identity crisis. Is not really a place to bring kids, I mean other than the Tree house and slides, what else is there to do with the kids? They should have just promoted it as an adults hang out spot. Anyhow CP you just don't impress me enough to come back and pay for street parking. I don't see this really getting any better. They have already had issues with some of the stores closing due to no business. This place could be Awesome if they just changed it up and got some better merchants. 

There is not a whole lot to do here at night, maybe if we came in the day time it would be a different and more exciting place to hang out?

After all of the hoopla, I have to say I am disappointed. I must have missed a lot by not visiting in the day time with all of these 4 star Yelp reviews, something is going on. lol

What the hell, at least I checked it out and know what it is now. I can honestly say that I will survive in my crazy world without another visit here.

Surrounding parking is pay by the hour, unless you're lucky enough to grab something a few blocks down. 

Check the events calendar because there are a ton of events hosted here throughout the year. 

My only complaint is that I still haven't had the energy to go exploring some of the higher level boutiques, which means other folks might not be either. Laziness. It's an epidemic.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,30,35,4,t0rdSSbvTIFoI-7pkVv7Cg

The Container Park is just as named- several shipping containers, stacked 3 floors on top of each other, have been repurposed into shops and restaurants, with a large, clean play space and nicely landscaped open seating area in the middle of the venue. The containers are large enough for people to walk in, and with large windows and open garage-door style bay doors, they feel open and inviting.

It seems to have morphed into a giant playground with shops/restaurants/etc. as a secondary attraction!
I'm sure it's done heaps to improve Downtown's image (?) and offer alternatives to nearby residents, but I've been here 4 times and still feel lukewarm about it. I've not imbibed at one of the many establishments serving adult bevvies but have heard good things about most of them!

5922185,2014-07-07,3,rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q,"Not sure why it's taken me so long to review container park, but better late than never. 
First off, when I first heard of container park I was intrigued, and once it opened it's definately become a staple of downtown and a place that I end up taking a lot if my out of town friends. 
The first thing you'll notice about container park is the giant praying mantis art car on the outside. If you've been to burning man or are familiar with the art there you'll notice and love it. For all my other friends it's always such a giant shock when the flames burst from it. 
The concept of container park is an entire shopping center made from shipping container, it's a novel concept and it works better with some stores more than others. There's several restaurants, a few bars and clothing and art boutiques. It's a perfect encapsulation of the new downtown Vegas. 
One factor that really bumps it up for me is it's dual use. During the daytime it's a great family friendly park where kids can play on the slides and grass, but after 9 it's 21 and over and the only place I know where drunk adults can have a playground to themselves. 
There's also the staging area where they have concerts or a live band playing a lot and during the summer they're goin to be doing movies. 
The only real downsides in my opinion is that the parking is horrible, but that's atypical of downtown and that when it first opened, some of the businesses weren't really made to run out of such limited retail space, but it's definately improved and I love coming here",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,6,7,4,HiYpbxkUvWza8JjO2FDNxQ

I had no idea what to expect going in, and afterwards I found myself enchanted with this place and wanting to ask all my friends why they haven't been here yet.

But after 9pm, they kick all the little kids out and the big little kids get to play with all their stuff!  The treehouse side (as epic as it is) looks super unstable and like a lawsuit is waiting to happen, but it was really fun to ride.

I love the open concept of the whole place. Live music is awesome. You can order a drink from here and drink it over there. You can order food from there and eat it over here. No problem. I really liked it.
