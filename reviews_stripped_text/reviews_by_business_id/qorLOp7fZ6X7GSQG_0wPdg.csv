The first time that we went, we ordered two regular ice coffees, and the lady gave us two regular hot coffees, so we went up to let them know that they got our order wrong and that we wanted it with ice, and she thought that we didn't want the coffee and just plain ice. She eventually gave us what we wanted. Then, the second time that we went, we ordered 3 hashbrowns, but they charged us for two and gave us two hashbrowns. This is a very frustrating Mcdonalds and I will never go there again!",GzTj4vCC70Qqs3J_7P0u0w,0,0,2,3LHba19SpSbKDj8wZRIZ8A

This McDonald's has 'em in different flavors! I've driven across country trying a cone at most McDonald's, and the Stratosphere is the only place I've seen serving other flavors besides vanilla.",KvMxlDK3H70bPAAvU84mWA,0,0,5,gtzyS7u0ByJyLULk8IchLA

I tried to order a clearly advertised shamrock shake and was told rudely that not only could i not a shamrock shake because those were not served anymore, but that i could not get any shakes because the machine was broken. So I ordered two cherry pies instead, much to my surprise i only got one cherry and apple, when i expressed my disapointment to the manager he pretty much told me to get lost. so on my way out after putting up with a week of this shit at this crap fucking hotel, i told all the people within earshot how shitty the stratosphere is. Also the place is supposed to opened at 6 am it didnt open until around 6:20 and we still couldnt use our debit cards.",0ZCk5H-2qS2yfOw36CKB0A,0,0,1,kK4XhmSgfl2M8RhT6vdxQg

To top it off I asked for ketchup packets for my large meal and was given two. The staff had a fearful new vibe and keep messing my order up. I tried to talk to a manager but she was extra rude. :( Hope they fix it the many issues. The location is convenient.,z7QqaZ06ZWJrA7VdNws5TQ,0,0,1,VAelsT91KY2NsE8JURlcdg

She was very rude and arrogant. The lobby of her store was trashed. Obviously hard to get good help in the Stratosphere McDonalds.  Funny thing is it's 5:30 pm right before the dinner rush. Avoid this place. Better places to eat in the hotel.,Yvh3kVii3ItwR2mKvsXyBA,0,0,1,hV7n3EDLjLEKngOkNRDuoQ
2782356,2018-01-04,0,qorLOp7fZ6X7GSQG_0wPdg,This McDonald's Works its employees to death. It is located inside the stratosphere on the upper level. They are very busy after midnight and they only had two employees for the entire store. The one at the counter which was running around like with his head cut off because he had to remake tea and make lattes and everything else that goes along with running the front of the house. There was a line out the back of the door and wrapped around. We literally waited 55 minutes to place our order. You may ask why wait that long well it was one of only two things that was open and the other was a sit-down restaurant. This McDonald's needs to respect its employees and add at least one more person.,DB5uuOamJ5N2RZ5ylqOFQw,1,0,1,qmHpy37rV8caSohRT3wwBg

They had 5 tables in the ""dining area"" and they were taken. There was another room with tables and chairs but that was blocked off and you couldn't enter that area. I wanted a McFlurry and was told they didn't have any ice cream (NO SHAKES or CONES either). People were having to eat outside the restaurant on benches (no table). Why???? Because you're too lazy and didn't want to open the other room because you didn't want to have to clean it? The lady taking our order was not friendly and had a hickey on her neck (pretty classy!).

Indeed I dip both into that succulent barbecue sauce, one of my favorites since I was a kid.  
Nope, never cared for the McRib.  
Don't know it, google please;)
Now, the Happy Meal.  Yes, enjoyed them or actually the toys probably more so and I still collect those Happy Meal toys. I admit it.  Now, you can have apple slices in lieu of fries.  Hell, I order both.  
There, that's it the whole truth.  
They have chicken tenders now, yes I know I can hear the comments regarding the McNuggets. I don't have them on a regular or daily basis, but I still enjoy them:)
I never stray and have a Big Max or anything, Happy Meal with a four piece McNugget and I make sure I collect that toy;)",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,0,0,4,v04q89mCJqajSx_Hisu1Kw

I only eat McDonald's when I'm in Vegas and at this very particular one. Not because its over the top, sound the gong good. Not by a long shot. I go here because it's quite accessible when we're checked in at Stratosphere.

Back in the day before the stories of the pink sludge, I could down a 20 piece McNugget meal without breaking a sweat. Nowadays, I only like the sausage, egg, and cheese McGriddles. Syrup already in the pancakes that serve as the buns, juicy sausage patty, fluffy eggs, and melted American cheese. Want to boost the flavor some more? Try strawberry jam or hot sauce or both if you're weird like me. 

Customer service was always fast and efficient. Last time they gave us bacon, egg and cheese McGriddle though for one of our orders. No biggie it was still good. Can't say the same about the person in front of me for the visit on Sunday. He was pissed because the lid on his breakfast tray wasn't closed right that the Canadian bacon decided to jump ship and landed in the plastic bag with all the utensils and napkins. Whoops! The employee calmly replaced his meal but the damage was done. The customer was inconsolable and wasn't too shy to let them know his displeasure. There was a line of customers forming too. My order was finally announced and I couldn't wait to get outta there. This time our order was perfect.",ctWAuzS04Xu0lke2Rop4lQ,27,27,3,DnsQvj_BMvk46cPB5v9_Cg

I've stayed at the Stratosphere many times and have found this to be a handy and convenient place to get a meal without having to leave the hotel. The dining area of the restaurant is generally clean and service is fast. Their machines keep breaking down in an orderly fashion so sometimes they won't be able to give you any iced coffee at other times it's a problem with the soft serve machine so no ice-cream or shakes or they can't serve you any hot coffee as that machine is down. If you can deal with the minor irritant of not being able to get what you want, you should be just fine, as the food is standard McDonald's quality.",HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA,5,4,4,YcsUaQuTuMSBx6kXgs706w
