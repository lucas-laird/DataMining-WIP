I went with the flat iron steak and the Total Domination IPA on tap.  Nice flavor on the steak!  And the service was great!",xNMTBISjkLaSnhaayWXoYQ,2,0,4,K-iT-v9yj6CuxfP0F7FEAQ

I ordered the $10.99 Caesar Salad and the $31.99 10 oz Ribeye with mash potatoes and vegetables. Ribeye is thinner than most ribeyes, but tasted great.  

The $13.99 Mango Mojito was excellent! Friendly staff. Food takes a little bit to arrive at the table, but not a big deal with great female company like I had! 

4+ stars as long as you don't care about the bill! Remember, it's Vegas! Gotta live a little!",LUL2M-R107_ovqrLqg7d6w,2,2,4,53_b9Xc8zDb2S7BxvofY3A

Since the entrees weren't available until dinner time, we shared a Caesar Salad, BBQ Chicken Flatbread, And All Day Omelet. 

The Caesar Salad consisted of chopped romaine, parmesan, and croutons tossed in a creamy Caesar dressing. I liked how the romaine lettuce was fresh.

The BBQ Chicken Flatbread consisted diced chicken, mozzarella cheese, bell pepper, red onion, and cilantro drizzled with bbq sauce. I liked how the bbq sauce was tangy.

The All Day Omelet consisted of white eggs, spinach, bell peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes. It was served with a green salad and fries. I liked how it was light in flavors.",EiT_pSuIb08oRn4CfwfMJg,1,1,4,zqQfk9IsgBQI7ukZz7ID5w

But we are in the vacation Marriott after all, and the great service and good bar food accompanied by a reasonable drink offering and prices suffice to assuage the nerves and blend in with the surroundings. It's the height of the tourist season so the lobby is filled with families variously clad in bathing suits or wrap arounds to black short dresses with all ages in between but overall the environment is good enough both for vacationers and those of us on business.",fL005WNiykEgIxq37BHHkA,0,0,4,xFMVykLSsMoFVxibrAFrQA

The drink choices are endless and the staff pleasant. The chips are fresh and tasty!,h2wFHjq4vZf9Luioy_RU3A,0,0,4,ZfWXJpoAq9HDa-JT-zdaGA

Our waiter, who's name I did not get, was very friendly & attentive with a wonderful sense of humor.  We ordered a few small plates; I ordered the buffelo shrimp flat bread with suculent shrimp, vegetables, & spicy buffelo sauce on thin slightly crispy flat bread.  I tried some of my mother's sweet potato putine with crispy sweet potatos, tender smoked postrami, cheese, & a rich gravy.  Round it off with A Cona Brewing Coconut Stout & you will not be disappointed.  For those of you wanting larger fare, they have hamburgers & sandwiches & other main items.  So, for wonderful food with friendly service in a casual upbeat atmosphere, Lobby Bar cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.",8qRUM-dShbtwHfjAJdpPRg,1,0,5,axLoddAUbg64SZlE0eksyA
