He told me he was busy counting money.he couldnt do everything. That when my jackass button kicked in i told him isnt the customer right no matter what. He started acting like a duche. It was not busy told him if i was his boss i would fire his ass on the spot. If the health department seen that he would be fired on the spot. Poor management for sure.

1264270,2014-04-26,0,IXH_aorv1x88UfRZrYDz4g,"Why am I writing a review of a fast food restaurant? One simple reason: I have been to this particular restaurant countless times over the last 15 years, and they have gotten my order wrong only once. ONCE! In 15 years! And every time I go there, the employees are quick, friendly, and on the ball.

Yes, I know, Del Taco is not the greatest food in the world. But you can't go wrong for the price, and they actually have a pretty broad menu. (French fries and burgers at a Mexican restaurant? Who knew?)

Tonight I had chili cheese fries. Why? I don't know. I usually get tacos and bean burritos. (And I will say I was not a big fan of tonight's order.) But, as I said, it doesn't matter what I order; it's almost always delivered quickly and correctly, and the employees are always friendly and attentive.

I'm not sure who to thank--if it's the franchise owner for this location, or if the employees at this place just take pride in their work--but I must say that I've never seen one particular fast food restaurant have such a long run of great service.

If you want cheap eats and great service, take the Jones exit off 95 and give Del Taco a chance. My advice: Stick with the Mexican food; go to Wienerschnitzel if you want chili cheese fries.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,2,4,b6JII0nKuUt8sfJ2r9xjzg

1634347,2015-03-07,6,IXH_aorv1x88UfRZrYDz4g,The best DT location in town! Old school locals know what this building used to be and we welcomed DT when it took over and decided to make its presence known (incorporating menu items from the previous business) in Vegas years ago. Yes the location is smaller but the building is older. They have never messed up my order here and it's always hot and delicious. The manager has been there a long time and gets to know her regular customers. She welcomes you like family no matter if you come inside or use the drive thru. It's crazy that a fast food place can do that but that's what I've experienced for many years at this location. On taco nights the drive thru can get backed up but it goes by quick so don't hesitate to stop if it looks long.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,11,10,5,VWIJzGZjTC1L62DO564kaA

As the years went on and the budget became a bit broader, I would pass this DT many, many, many times but would never stop.

While out and about recently, I though I would stop and check it out.  I can't eat as much as I could in my 20's, so I ordered two simple items.  A bean burrito with extra cheese and a chicken soft taco.  This service was quick and friendly enough.  Of the two items, the burrito did not have extra cheese, and the chicken soft taco was limp.  By limp, I mean a DT chicken soft taco that was marginal at best.  Not enough to hate....but enough to leave one wanting.

Thanks for still being here.  Thanks for taking me back to a familiar place as I devoured my chow on a near-by side street.  But as for the DT is as DT does...My meal could have used a little more love in it's preparation.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,4,7,2,ZOljajgcyZfi0pHEB3NXdg

But the other night, I had zero interest in cooking and a killer fish taco craving. So I picked one up, added on a veggie burrito, and they gave me an extra bacon quesadilla that was a duplicate from a previous order. I wouldn't order that, even if it's priced at 50 cents- it's literally a tortilla folded over some bacon bits with some cheese. No thanks.

Beer battered fish taco is exactly what I like, wouldn't order the veggie burrito again though- cheap though it was. They seem to have recently added a cali asada burrito that I may need to try in the near future- somehow I doubt it'll measure up to the cali burritos I got in the bay area, though.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,2,YV2gtMmNbIg_2AByOgmdxg

The drive thru for this location gets busy late night because it is one of the only easy access restaurants when coming home from a night of drinking in the downtown or strip areas, and need to make it safely back home to Summerlin, Westside or Centennial Hills.  

The line moved pretty decent even though they were busy and the most important thing is that they got our order 100% correct.  I am normally a Taco Bell or Jack in the Box  fan for late night munchies, but the great thing about Del Taco is that you can have the best of both world's of FF mex or burgers and fries.  What a great concept.  

I think it will be difficult to convert me to a full fledged fan of Del Taco, but the food quality seems to be decent, hot and fresh compared to others late night staples.  Now if they had some chicken wings this place would be 10 Stars!!!",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,1,2,3,oNN3en4KyvTOJR5TBmkKWQ

5466093,2012-01-25,3,IXH_aorv1x88UfRZrYDz4g,"For years, I have fallen victim to Del Taco and its remarkably delicious soft chicken tacos.  From my time in California, to my move to Vegas years ago, my joy was no greater than discovering that my favorite junk food would carry over with me to this new state.

Over a decade later, I still retain a soft spot for the soft chicken taco, and this Del Taco is not a disappointment in this regard.

Regarding this location, the service is polite, the lines are fast, and to date, I've never had an issue with my order.  It's located in a shopping center next to a bar, and outside of the many 'Bertos taco variants, this is the other preferred meal of choice after ingesting a few liquid libations, or late night ""I have to eat something"" snack.  This location has gotten me through a few rough nights of working late.

That said, it's not the building, location, prices, or service that I take issue with.  It's the drive through customer.  I was reminded of this just today as the woman ahead of me screamed a string of profanities at the hapless girl inside the window as she sped away.  For you see, this isn't the first time I've witnessed something like this at this location.

Maybe they're drunk from the local bar.  Maybe it's just something about the neighborhood.  Maybe these people are just stupid.  Or just mental.  Who can say, really?  All I know is I feel for the customer service, because as mentioned before, the people working here really are nice.  The only fast food place I can think of that actually initiates a brief ""How are you"" conversation, and sounds like they actually mean it.

Regardless, this is a decent location that actually makes use of a paraphrased (and edited) line from ""Clerks"": This place would be great if it wasn't for the fudging customers.
