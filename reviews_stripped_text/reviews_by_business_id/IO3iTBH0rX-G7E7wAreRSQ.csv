92285,2016-03-03,0,IO3iTBH0rX-G7E7wAreRSQ,OrderOrder 1Half Rack Ribs taste like ribs were boiled and bbq sauce just pour over them. Ribs taste bland needed some type of seasoning   Potatoe Salad and bake beans taste like items you get from Walmart could have put in salt and pepper to spice up taste. The only thing in this order that taste good was the small cut of corn-bread.  If you want to get some Ribs make sure it's not here.  I decided to order Ribs because my last two Food ORDERS were delicious but not this ORDER NOT this RIB ORDER.  I hated when 3/4 of my food end up in the trash and this Rib ORDER WAS TRASHED.l,hiX5HcUasCQhyaWm76X-aw,0,0,2,kNtgfH0UTF2nmXI9A2JYqg

Now and then I do stop in for pizza, wings, or a hot sub sandwiches. Quality food for a quality price. I always check my order before I leave. Never a problem an no complaints. Today I'm having the hot Tuna Melt w/ Fries and 20oz Dr Pepper for $6.99 plus tax. Its one of their menu lunch specials. It was made the way I wanted it and it was good. That's today's review. I've never ordered for delivery service and I wouldn't being that I live so close since 1988. I don't think its a good idea to order delivery when your over 10 miles out. Some how food suffers from delivery where ever you buy from. Delivery service for hot food sometimes fails when your over 8 miles aways. The kitchen is connected to the Putters Bars & Grills. All the Putters always have good food at good prices. Putters would never put up with bad food service. Its going to be good or its out. Angelina's Pizzeria and Italian kitchens has been connected there for over 5 years maybe more. It looks like Angelina's is remodeling and opening the space next door to them. This will allow accommodation for an all age customers eating in. I hope the new space could turn out to be a good plan with extended service like a deli or cafe w/ coffee shop feel to it. I miss the Jitters coffee shop and Senna deli that I visited and have since closed/moved out of the area.",B0zdBoK4mQu2Yj7-8IpW1w,1,0,3,11WzvtnnDaC5duV1sHzAIg
256627,2017-04-24,0,IO3iTBH0rX-G7E7wAreRSQ,I usually order from Angelinas on Charleston but this one was closer. Now to start I had ordered at 9:46 And my food got here at 11:37.  Almost 2 hours later I got my food!! Then my pizza was barely warm while my wings were cold as hell. And the suckish part was that I paid 1.75 for every topping and there was very little toppings on my pizza. So you guys should just step up your game. Your guys food& service is usually great .

Review posted Fri, Apr 01, 2016.
Incomplete order, missing an order, my pasta had gotten cold cause im on the phone inquiring about my missing order, there's no cheese on my nacho supreme. It took me 5 minutes to get of hold to someone at the restaurant, it took 10 minutes (more or less) to resolve the problem and constantly being on hold because the lady that answer the phone doesn't how to handle the situation and ended up talking to somebody else. Called Grubhub customer service and complain about it and ask for a refund for the price of the missing order plus tax ($4.32) plus the tip of $7.06 (15%) and this took another 10 minutes more or less. Then the guy from Grubhub just want me to settle for $10 refund and was gonna tell him that if he won't give a refund that i'll dispute the whole bill to my bank, but he put me on hold (i was very frustrated about this time), but i just said NO and told him a full refund for the missing item plus the tip. So good job another customer satisfied.

SUGGESTION: Hire a better staff on this location. Obviously not checking the quality of food and what food needs to sent out for delivery specially if the delivery driver is not from their company. And hire someone who knows how to apologize.",gq_394NI-qlFXXeBUoJAoQ,0,0,1,HypAf-aqzbdDvId2el3lIg

832294,2016-06-29,1,IO3iTBH0rX-G7E7wAreRSQ,"Let me start by saying that Eat24 has a lot to do with this. YELP (Partner of Eat24) has made it impossible for me to review this delivery service. They deserve about 70% of this. I fully expect that YELP will erase this review. As Eat24 is a business partner. 

Since my legs went real bad on me we don't go out to dinner much anymore. It is too hard to navigate in a wheelchair. So, I have been using Food Delivery Services a lot. We have learned who is good and who is not so good. It is not my way to discuss bad performance and a miserable attitude. Yet here I am.

At 6:02 PM PDT I placed an order through Eat24 here in Las Vegas. They had been satisfactory in the past. Our order was from the menu on Eat24 for Angelina's Pizzeria, Village East Plaza #9, 5025 S Eastern Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89119
(702) 597-9056. Although we a near this place we had never ordered from them in the past.

Our order totaled to over $125.00. It arrived from Eat24 in a reasonable amount of time. My Wife checked everything in our order for accuracy and found the order complete. In my order was a Chicken Parmigianino Hot Sub for Gracie. As I cut the very cool (Not Hot) sandwich for her I realized that the chicken was not cooked. In some places it was no different than what you would take out of a store bought uncooked pack of chicken. The coating was a light brown. The inside was cool to the touch. I gave Gracie part of my meal and rewrapped the chicken sandwich. I was sure that everyone involved would act immediately to get me another sandwich and fix whatever process allowed this to happen.

I have contacted Eat24 twice via their own web contact page. I have never heard from them. I sent a photo a photo and told them I had the chicken sandwich in my refrigerator so they could pick it up and actually see my problem with this raw chicken. No phone call, no e-mail, no anything as a response.

I would expect that Eat24 contacted Angelina's Pizzeria so, I blame both of them for not writing me about my legitimate complaint off and refusing to deal with me over their mistake.

I cannot and will not recommend either Eat24 Food Delivery Service or Angelina's Pizzeria; this is a shame that their hidden agenda has now lost them any business from us. None of this was necessary if they had just talked with me.

There you have it, My Zero ""O"" rating for two food industry businesses here in Las Vegas. I am sorry I have to do this to any business trying to survive and prosper.  WFH.",3WHmc6WQ_jk_fIp-dJDKyA,4,2,1,gy0U_H4xx7XSOHN0esuPsA

Rude, dismissive and verging on nasty because I had the nerve to try to hold them to a bare standard of customer service. After that failed, I took my complaint to the management during the day. She was apologetic and appalled, offering me a bigger refund than I asked for, (I only wanted the crappy, cold, uneatable food refunded). I didn't take it, but I did appreciate her caring. Patty, the manager saved me from totally slamming this place in the worst way. She couldn't convince me to order there again after the damage the night staff had done, but I won't bash the entire experience.

With all the damn flyers that kept being put on our door you would think that they were something special. YEAH RIGHT!  First of all the food was delivered 30 minutes later than they said. Then they fucked up on our order. Sausage and mushroom and tomatoes... They just put sausage. When I called to complain... The lady said oh sorry lemme talk to the cook... the she said I can send you another pizza but that will take another 45 minutes... or I can give you a credit. I opted for the credit and she gave me a credit of 5.00! the entire meal was 35.00 and the credit was for the fact that they forgot the other 2 toppings.  So it was like their fuck up was somehow my fault! I DON'T THINK SO!! The food was cold and greasy and didn't taste good either.  Let me say again!

****TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, TERRIBLE FOOD****

Tonight was the third time I've ordered from this place. The first time was fine. The second time was a disaster. It took them 1 hour 15 minutes to deliver food. When they did it was so cold I threw it all away. The nachos with steak were made with a cheese that I can only relate to the kind they use on movie theater nachos. SO GROSS. The 'steak' on top was tiny slivers of something, but it wasn't steak. My dogs wouldn't even eat it. I had ordered onion rings, cold. I also got the buffalo chicken wrap, cold. It was also sitting IN the buffalo sauce. Threw away. The last of my order was zeppolis. They were so hard and had so much powered sugar on them that they too had to go. I literally got nothing from there.

 I waited and decided to try a third time as the first time was okay, so maybe the second was just a fluke. Uh, NO. They had said their delivery times were between 45-60 minutes. At 1 hour 15 minutes I called. He wouldn't be here for another 15 minutes. SO, I waited 1.5 hours for FROZEN FOOD. The girl on the phone (absolutely so unprofessional) told me that they had SEVEN other deliveries. How in the WORLD do you deliver hot food when you deliver to SEVEN other places before me?? 

So, OF COURSE, when they arrived, FINALLY, the food was cold. The hamburger was cold AND not made to my specifications (because they apparently have below average reading comprehension skills there as well as time management issues), the onion rings were cold (there is nothing you can do for cold onion rings except throw them away - more money wasted). Oh, forgot that the fries with the hamburger that was made incorrectly? COLD. I also got potato skins that were cold, but at least you can heat those up. 

When I called to tell them that they gave me nothing near the hamburger I ordered the rude girl told me that I would need to have her driver (the one that took 1.5 hours to get my food with 7 other deliveries) come back and get my burger then bring it back to her to check it out then put it at the back of the line to get a new one. So I suppose I'd have to wait another 1.5 hours for my hamburger? No, I think not. I asked for a refund and was told 'oh, sorry, we don't give refunds.' Huh?? You keep my money and give me crappy food? No, sorry. 

Please avoid this hole. It really does give the great pizza places here a bad name (try Metro Pizza - Angelina's WISHES they could be half as good - PLEASE).",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,7,0,1,V5BPvI_QYc2rgNmfYB9aRA

Ordered through Eat24 and was estimated at 45-60 minutes.  At 60 minutes we messaged Eat24 who called the restaurant and was told that there was some type of mix up which location the order was made to, they apologized and it would be arriving in about 15 minutes.  After another 15 minutes we again messaged Eat24 who contacted Angelina's and informed that that if the driver had not yet left to please just cancel the order; we were told that it should be arriving within 5 minutes.  Over 15 minutes later there was FINALLY a knock at the door...which means, since I work near the restaurant and know exactly how long it takes to get to my apartment, the driver had NOT left when we made the first call I can only assume lied to avoid cancelling the order.  SO, not only did we have to wait an hour and 45 minutes for the food to arrive, when it did it was ALL cold and soggy.  Spoke to Eat24 about the issue and they called the manager.  We were told that they would give a $10 credit (for a $40 bill) for another purchase - HA, well, that's just unacceptable as I will NEVER eat there again!  We were then told the only way I'd receive a refund would be to return the food myself to the restaurant.  Again, UNACCEPTABLE!  Why should I have to drive out of my way to return something that could have been cancelled had I not been deceived in the first place!  Not to mention that since they took so long to arrive the first time, I was now running late to a previous engagement; if they'd like the food returned, it would be waiting for them by the front door.  I do (and have) worked in customer service for over 15 years and know exactly how disputes should be handled and what customer service should look like; had I been offered at least a partial refund initially (along with an apology by the delivery driver who obviously was in no hurry to get it to the door) this review would have been much different...although, even under optimal circumstances, the food would not be considered spectacular by any means.

On a positive side, Eat24 is a great service who was able to advocate on our behalf so I will highly recommend their service.  But, regarding Angelina's I would highly recommend you STAY AWAY.",b_4G_x-XmlzZlhTL0QpE-w,0,0,1,PjISPKC107vamanMrmKhSw

French fries! They know how to make PROPER french fries!!! The only thing was that their dollar fries have like 10-12 sticks which is pretty laughable. So order the large portion because its really good. 

Their wings are jumbo but the buffalo sauce flavor is very faint so its just okay. It is a good value because they serve bigger wings than most places.

Burgers are big and really juicy but quite expensive.

Garlic balls are really good (mini parmesan garlic bread balls) and it comes with 30 pcs. 

Roomy says their Broccoli cheddar soup is very tasty.

The only thing I didn't enjoy at all was the chicken parmigiana. They used cheap dry noodles (as expected) so it was not worth $13. The quality of the white meat chicken was really good but the super super super salty breading ruined it.Their marinara sauce is great as a side dipping sauce but the flavor disappeared in this dish. I think if they left the chicken breading unseasoned and added a lot more sauce then it would be so much better.",7lXJ1xfcuVNk-i1B48oGvA,0,0,4,WBAe59S5hH8uFPZ1XOgk9Q

3608172,2017-01-11,0,IO3iTBH0rX-G7E7wAreRSQ,"Update:
The second order was also incorrect. They forgot to send cake with my order.  The employee recommended that I not order through Grub Hub.   However, neither issue was Grub Hub's;  they don't cook or pack up the order. 

 When I called and explained that the cake was for my birthday, I didn't even get an apology.   I won't use them again....they can keep my $4; hopefully it will bring the appropriate karma to their lives.


This  was my first experience with this restaurant.   I ordered through Grub Hub on a week night (around 6pm).  My order was promptly delivered; they beat the expected time.  The food was good, but there was an error in the order.  The grilled cheese with ham arrived with no ham and the bread was incredibly dry.  However, it was still adequate...just not what was ordered, and not that good.  The criss cut fries were good: a bit of seasoning, but nothing overwhelming.  The pizza was really good: I understand why they were best of vegas.  We also had a piece of chocolate layer cake.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but the cake was moist and the intended eater loved it.

Summary: 
Order may not be close, but not entirely correct.
Pizza, cris cut fries, and chocolate layer cake are worth a try
Service was quick
Napkins, ketchup, and a fork were provided without a special request

Final word:  I'll give them another chance without a second thought.",P4FVZHeocn3rXdZ3yYoUng,0,0,2,VO3AydOBhg-Ut_I9nu879g

First, I called and asked if they had a small or personal pizza. Lady said yes. It's $6.99 
Didn't tell me the size or anything but I thought ok it should be a normal sized pizza for one... I get there and it's tiny. But that's not what got me... what got me is that I get there, and there a 14"" that costs the EXACT same as my tiny 8"" and she couldn't even tell me !!!! 
And another lady just said ""sorry, I would have told you"" like are you kidding me ? I didn't want to be THAT person, but part of me wanted to cancel the tiny pizza and order the bigger one.. but I didnt... then she had the audacity to tell me to give them a like on yelp (hahahahahaha) so here I am. 

So I get home... and I had also ordered mozzarella sticks. Lol they were hollow !!!! Nothing inside !!!! There was some cheese don't get me wrong... the cheese was all over the foam plate (lol) but NOTHING inside the actual stick! 

On top of that, I ordered 2 orders of wings with fries. They already come with a side of ranch. And I ordered 2 EXTRA side of ranch. Before I leave, I ask the lady. So there's 4 ranch in there correct? And she assured me that there was... get home... nope only 2! So I paid $3 for nothing lol!!! Paid $8 or whatever for ""mozzarella sticks"" for nothing. And paid $8 for a ""personal"" pepperoni pizza ! This was the most ridiculous thing that's happened to me while ordering food. Then she says I should have checked the menu... well hello!!! I did! Maybe she should have updated her menu online or told me over the damn phone what I was getting into! Lol 
Well as you can see, I'm clearly upset. Paid $50 for my whole order... only to be left unsatisfactory",vvwYQ0jxNrP7gy0nK00ZsA,1,0,1,Q3kt1Ia2PuZ9N6OHrizuMQ

The food got here on time, and thats where the experience started to go down hill for me...

My Chicken Caeser Wrap was hot...? I don't know who in the world though hot lettuce and caeser dressing would be a good idea but they were terribly terribly wrong. I can feel my gag reflex creeping up on me just reliving the experience on here.

The burger was decent, and so was the Calzone. The only bad thing about the Calzone is it came out to $20.00!! That Calzone better have been made out of Truffle Oil and Gold!

The Garlic KNots were definitely the best thing we ordered but looking at all the grease/oil/butter? At the bottom of the container they came in instantly made me sick to my stomach. I felt my face trying to break out mid bite and I had to put the Garlic Knot down!

I have been looking for a god pizza delivery joint on the northeast end of Henderson since I moved here a couple of years ago, and after trying Angelina's, I'm still looking.

I will say this for them: though it did take another hour to get the correct pizza delivered, it was decent-tasting when it arrived, and despite the fact that the staff at Eat24Hours had stated that I would need to give the incorrect pizza back, the delivery driver, who was polite and apologetic about the error, said he was not taking the pizza back only to have it thrown away.

First off!!!! Customer service here sucks, the people are always rude and don't care about you weather you call or go in. I'm big on customer service so if it's not up to par then I won't go back and believe me when I tell you this place doesn't care about you at all. 

Second... the pizza prices are way too expensive for what you are getting. My partner and I always get two individuals pizzas but because there ""specials"" there like 20 buck plus a pop just for two pizza. So yes it is ridiculous but don't let me stop you.... try it out but I'm telling you the people there suck and really need to work on there customer service really needs work. 

When you finish to pay (if your picking up) they eyeball you looking at if your going to tip them or not and if you ever feel generous ever...then they act nice...

If they improved there customer service and not being rude as hell on the phone, I think they might be better, just saying

And just one last thing....
I called one time to just get one pizza but split it because they are SO EXPENSIVE and this lady who has a Brooklyn accent pick up the phone and automatically say""no"" in a fricken rude ass way and was like ""the sauces touch so we can't do that, we can't mix the sauces"" now she said it was a company thing but to be honest I think she just didn't want to do it because even when I picked up the pizza she was like "" yeah, sorry the sauces would collide and make the pizza taste bad so I didn't do it"" she pissed me off so much....

Like I said good pizza but hell man this place is shitty",unar0UMm9S3VOIFhubZusA,3,0,2,39fuE2erRNxxZFOPDQrvVQ

I ordered this in hopes that it'd satisfy my craving for something that reminds me of home. I don't know if it was the crust that turned me off or the tangy cheese. But the flavors and texture of the slice was something I had to ""tread through."" The sauce was a good sauce.",gkG_80oBZmOH2Pus6x16pw,1,0,2,jZvdc9f8Wwvbbhce-igZoQ

We gave them a call to let them know they messed up our order, they told us we had to go pick up and we had to return the pizza. For one we waited a whole hour for our food which arrived cold and burnt. Then we still have to take back the messed up order.

5938094,2017-07-06,0,IO3iTBH0rX-G7E7wAreRSQ,This is being generous. I used to love this place but today was ridiculous. I got 3 out of four sodas I ordered. When I brought it up to the driver that I was missing a drink he told me no!!!! I'm sorry excuse me I had to point it out on the receipt and then he went to a convenient store and brought me a one liter bottle! Not what I ordered!! Also the bacon on my crispy chicken club was raw! I would order from this place all the time but I'm second guessing how much they care about their  customers,0SR-Kb3Gbc03uDkzRapkIw,0,0,3,yCPFhlLKhyeVApfewnRACQ

I have had their chicken fingers which are nice and meaty breast meat w/fries really good and crispy, Wings are also meaty I'm VERY picky about wings.
Their smallest burger is HUGE and tasty and I've had a Club sandwich also very big with lots of turkey and BACON YUM. 
If other delivery services give you a problem try Ubereats they are fast and efficient and as of this date FREE (Nov 1, 2016).
I haven't given a fifth star because I haven't tried their pizza yet.",jEyb7v42sgIZZhwxnynFfg,1,1,4,vhDMAChdB-pd1RjuyfWzyQ
