Okay so I didn't just come here for the soda. I had a Groupon for Elevation Burger and had to spend $20. I ordered the elevation burger with cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce and mayo. I was sad that they didn't have mushrooms. I also ordered the fries and a chocolate malt shake. The burger was delicious, you can totally tell that is was a 100% organic beef. The fries reminds me of the fries from In N Out, so nothing special there. As for the shake, it was pretty good; you can't go wrong with chocolate malt shake.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,0,3,UOM90rXRLmRLE0dYr9GOog

I had the vertigo burger which consisted 3 patties and a thick slice of aged cheddar.  The little woman had an elevation burger with 2 patties and a slice of cheddar. We also had their fresh cut fries and they were hot and delicious.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.

124271,2012-03-26,0,_7kVnn5_19ckuFPS9PCrpQ,"I'm not sure how the owners would feel, but if you're looking for a healthier, 100% organic version of In-N-Out I think I have found it at a new place in town called Elevation Burger. One of my readers tipped me off to this place a few months ago before it opened, and I've been very intrigued since reading about their organic ingredients and healthy approach combined with their use of environmentally sustainable architecture they strive for at each location. So does this all add up to a good burger? Yes it does.

Carrying the organic theme in their interior, the restaurant is sparsely decorated with bamboo-topped tables and chairs, bamboo floors, and most likely a company-wide color scheme of two tone set of blue tiles. The space has a good feel to it; as I said it almost seemed like there were too few seats but once I did a quick count and saw several more people come in during my visit it seemed just right. Also in keeping with the simplicity aspect they have one of those new fancy coke machines that makes like 200 different combinations without having a whole line of fountains.

The menu has everything from single- and double-patty options, to veggie burgers, grilled cheese, a large variety of sides, some great shakes and even mandarin oranges. And what's even more helpful for those that care is the calorie count for each item is prominently displayed. But the star of the show is all in the ingredients; the burger for example is made from 100% USDA-certified organic, grass-fed, free-range beef, and you can taste the difference. Even the fries are made with olive oil, and the cookies are made with organic eggs and butter.

I of course had to go with their Elevation Burger which has double meat, double cheese (real cheddar) and the ""original"" toppings: Elevation sauce, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. Double meat and cheese sounds a bit similar to another certain place, huh? The look of the burger and fries when they arrive at your table are even a bit familiar, but the similarities stop upon first bite. You instantly taste a unique beef flavor that stands out from many other fast food-type places. The patties are thin, but juicy and hold a very prominent flavor throughout the meal. The bun is great; very sweet and soft, reminiscent of a Hawaiian roll. The lettuce, tomato and pickles are all fresh and good, with the lettuce being used sparingly and just right. The cheese was melted thoroughly, had good flavor but I found myself longing for a little more sharpness to it. I hate to keep going back to it, but by the end of this burger I really felt like I had finished a not-too-greasy burger with great, fresh ingredients similar to when I finish an In-N-Out burger, and I don't think that's a bad thing by any means.

The fries are also really fresh and great; one serving is more than enough for two people. The fries on my first visit may have been a bit hard and overcooked, but on my second visit less than a week later the fries were soft and just right. I also had an Oreo shake on my second visit and it was great. A very intriguing offering on their menu and something I will most likely have on my next visit is the option for them to scoop some ice cream onto the root beer they sell by the bottle.

The overall price of this meal is a bit more than the place I keep comparing it to, but I think you're paying for the ingredients as well as a slightly better, less hectic atmosphere. The double burger I had starts at $5.29, with another $2.69 for a double helping of fries. $4.19 for a shake might be a tad high, but it is really tasty if you feel like splurging once in a while.  I will also add that Sean the GM of this location is really nice. I have a habit of leaving a business card behind at most places I review, Sean got in touch with me within an hour of my visit to see what I thought, so I made a point to ask for him on my return trip. All of the employees are very friendly, the food is great and it's a really nice atmosphere. So if you're in the south west part of town and are craving for something a bit better than fast food, definitely try an Elevation Burger.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,5,54O2_i5faNtndieRv9O6yQ

340267,2012-05-15,0,_7kVnn5_19ckuFPS9PCrpQ,"The burgers here we're decent but lacked flavor. The chocolate milk shake was rich with a bold chocolate flavor but almost no malt. Honestly the thing that ruined this place for me was the sour faced bitch behind the counter... I think her name was Kelsey (that is what it said on the receipt) the girl who delivered the food was nice and bubbly so I hope I haven't gotten anyone confused. When we walked in there were people dining but the place was pin drop quiet... When we walked up to the register the girl who I mentioned earlier gave little to no greeting and couldn't have been less interested in our questions. As if us walking up to the counter was such an inconvenience for her she could bare to stand there another second longer. If I did chose to come here again I would walk right back out if I saw her and return on her day off. She is doing this company a dis-service and if I gave service even half as bad as her at my own service industry job I would have been fired a long time ago. 

The burgers and presentation looked similar to in-n-out but the fries were fried in olive oil so they had an un-satisfying savory flavor and were very greasy. The ingredients were clearly fresh and like I said if it wasn't for the counter girl's sour faced attitude this place wouldn't be bad at all.

2 stars for her ability to scowl and press a button at the same time.",yAPgJWysjkStwZgjcvg-FQ,0,0,2,vlrOB_3aKW_4e6CI3xpSyw

The next time...I didn't think I'd come back.  I am thinking of giving them one more try today which is why I found myself here.

The Good:  The organic grass fed beef!  The flavor of the burger is really good.  The fries are better than In-n-Out but you really have to eat them quickly or they get very mushy.  Not so good when you take them to go and eat them 5 minutes later.  The shakes are great!  The new style soda machine is a nice touch with all the flavors.

The Bad:  The bottom bun gets mushy from all the juices and the buns tend to be greasy.  Sometimes the burger is poorly put together so that it looks sloppy and is harder to eat (lack of training probably).  When I have gotten the food to go, by the time I get home (I live 3 blocks away) the bag has become greasy and gets on my car seat.  They really need to fix this - wrap the fries or?? The iced tea in my opinion is just gross.  It is so far out there with the cinnamon that they really should have another choice that is more plain for those of us who aren't into cinnamon flavored iced tea.  Iced tea is all that I drink when I'm out and I can't get a drink when I'm there :(

There is no music in the place - something would be better than the silence I've encountered in there.  Customer service - I'm okay with it, nothing special.  I agree with some of the other posts - they seem a bit forced and uncomfortable.  I'm not sure why - maybe lack of training and experience.  Maybe they will get better at it.

I'm not sure that they are better than Smash burger or In-N-Out.  We'll try them one more time...",GEzdyAxbJqR0_rQEKzwUvw,1,1,3,Ni0X20ksKBuW0jtwm7uOpw

I ordered the elevation burger with cheddar and fries which were cooked in olive oil. The burger was pretty simple two patties, lettuce, elevation sauce, and cheddar cheese. The burger was somewhat juicy but lacked a lot of flavor. But if anything is considered healthy its going to lack a little flavor as compared to the good fatty stuff. The fries were OK also nothing special. 

I guess the burger lived up to the organic healthier side which lacked a lot of flavor. So burgers were as expected. When it comes to burgers the more unhealthy it is the better.",2wyP8DL1isAG-6ApKbvDSw,3,0,3,6xT6Qjyk7C7K7LpqkpF_rA

Service:
Outstanding! 3 people (the check register girl and two cooks) said hi. The employees were very helpful with navigating through the menu. The food came out fast and correct, even with all the specifications I put on my burger. The girl who brought out our food was cheery, as was the girl who took my tray after was as well. Everyone was helpful and had a great attitude.

Location:
Very cute restaurant. Nice atmosphere, clean, and right off the 215 in Summerlin South, Wal-Mart shopping center. The menu is great! Calories listed, lots of options, great ingredients.

Food:
The Fries
Delicious, real potato fries. Comparable to In-n-Out.
The Shake
Very nice and creamy. They didn't spare the Oreos and used good ice cream. 
The Root Beer Float
Very good. Good Root Beer and Good Ice Cream
The Burger
Not so good, and the reason why the review is just 3 stars. The burger was a little too greasy. The bun had a marshmallow consistency. They put waay too much lettuce on the burger. The meat was pretty bland. I don't think it had too do with the 'organic', I think it may not be salty enough, but it was definitely greasy.

616246,2012-12-11,0,_7kVnn5_19ckuFPS9PCrpQ,"I was hesitant to go here because someone at work tried it and said the burgers were greasy, fries were green, shakes were bad. However, I looked at reviews from other places around the country (none for Las Vegas at the time) and most people had good things to say. I figured it's a burger, how bad could it be. So I tried it.

First, let me say, that one of the reviews said that the flavor is different and it is, a very good different. I can't stand most burgers from either fast-food or sit-down restaurants because they just never season the meat. Give me a little salt or something people!

Anyway, this burger has major flavor, but it's not like a flavor from any other burger. So some people may not like it. I don't know why it tastes so different...I read that it was grass-fed beef, maybe that's it. I don't know.

To those that said it was dry, must have gone on a bad day. I have eaten here several times and the first time there was juice running down my hand, yet somehow the bun wasn't soggy. I have had a dry burger here one time, but every other time...it was great.

The fries really do nothing for me. They are ok, but nothing special. I would give it 5 stars if the fries were better. I haven't had a shake, so can't comment.

This is absolutely the best burger I have had out in a LONG TIME and is now my go-to burger place. I would recommend anyone to try this at least once. As I said, the flavor is different so you may not like it, but you may also LOVE IT.",6oTBCDPulXFC-zi96CqC4Q,0,0,4,G1VRXjKMRIY08cb6DtqrCw

Yes,  I eat healthy to the point that it would drive most people insane. My wife brought home a menu that she received at work. Grassfed and organic sprinkled all over the menu I said why not try it. 

Now, I have been here at least four times. I always get 2 beef patties with one slice of cheese and one Veggie #1 pattie wrapped in lettuce. The first time we went and the staff was going out of there way to recommend things to try. Every single one of the staff members had something to offer about what I should try. There were at least 8 people working. My wife and I odered our food and took it home to eat. I told my wife at that time that they were like car sales men only for hambugrers. 

The second time was where I finally wanted to scream at the staff, manager and everything else breathing in site. Upon arriving my wife and I were the only ones in there. The cashier said hello and asked if we had been there before. I replied yes and she left us alone. Then a 15-19 year old male comes over to me and said ""Everything is better with cheese on it"". I was like WTF is this kid for real? I get that they are excited about the new store. I get they make money on the .60 cent per slice of cheese. I get that most of these kids working here are young and working their first job. But, I don't need to be told WTF is better with cheese on it. I replied ""Yeah we got it"" and he tried to say something else. I stared at him and he went away. 

After that trip I told my wife I cannot go back there and deal with these people. So, we didn't go in for a few weeks. Then once again we decided to return. This time there were less than 8 people working there, thank god because they are always over staffed. The service was what is should be. Not pushy, nice and respectful.

I have to say, this was one of the better ""quick"" burgers I've had in a very long time.  It seems the styling of food preparation closely mimics that of a certain California based, West Coast burger icon (of which I'm not particularly a fan of), but the grass-fed, freshly ground, organic beef patties at Elevation are truly delicious!  Not greasy, crumble apart nicely, no gristle or chewy surprises.  Just yummy lean meat.  One of the group opted to order the veggie patty, and as much as I prefer carnivorous options, I actually plan to try that next.  It looked fantastic, and the reviews equaled those of the meat eaters.

Fries cooked in olive oil are just better than those cooked in vegetable oil.  I typically don't spend much time reviewing fries, as they're just a salty filler in my opinion, but these were pretty good.

I would have awarded the 5th star except the restaurant, though very nice and clean, was a brisk 60 degrees at best.  The AC was turned up so high, the vents 16 feet above us were blowing the napkins off the table.  We know it's the desert, but it's not in the 100's just yet.  Thermostats can still be set to 70.

This will definitely be a spot to visit once a month or more.

Four solid stars (I reserve five for Bradley Ogden).  Fresh, organic ingredients make all the difference and they spell it out right on the menu.  I'm a big foodie, but try to watch what I eat, and feel better knowing that my ground beef is grass fed, organic.   I usually order the Elevation Burger with lettuce , tomato, pickles, grilled onions, and elevation sauce.  They have never disappointed me!

I would compare this burger to an In N Out quality, but different taste.  That's a good thing as In N Out rates very high on my list of fast food burgers (the best actually...along with this place).  You can taste the organic difference though...Juicy, filling burger, that is quick and satisfying.

Not a big fry guy (unless it's the pommes frites at Disneyland), but very comparable to In N Out fries.  The organic cookies are to die for too...I prefer the mini's!

I took a bite of my boyfriend's awesome elevation burger first. That did it for me. I usually don't regret what I order, but I did. The beef patty was that good...

My son ate his burger and couldn't devour the fries fast enough (cooked in olive oil). We enjoyed the cool soda fountain, where you can mix your favorite Coca-Cola soda with various syrups. My boyfriend enjoyed his Cherry Vanilla Coke Zero.

I wish Elevation Burger was a more convenient location for me. I like restaurant burgers, I enjoy In-n-Out, and I'll give credit to this place for being unique, offering health-conscious menu choices. 

I did enjoy my experience here, especially since we got to utilize a groupon. As much as I enjoyed the taste of that beef patty, I would return if I'm in the area. Not enough to make a special trip...",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,4,1,3,4em52SIlvJN03xFLJH0QDA

I won't get it again because beef is to good. The menu is simple just burgers and fries and shakes, I would compare it to In N Out as far as size of burger but I think it's better tasting because of the quality ingredients and the fact that each burger is made for you and not assembly lined ...also the have that new mix your own coke machine....

We went with a groupon. 
We came at an off hour, so the place was pretty empty. 
Everything was extremely clean and they were more than well staffed, seeing as how the employees outnumbered the customers by about 3 to 1. Staff was pleasant, but not pushy.
The burgers and fries were truly amazing! 
Basically, it's like In-n-Out (which I love!), but WAAAAAAY better.
I love that they have grass fed beef, and that they cook their fries (with peels still on!) in extra virgin olive oil, although I'd be EXTRA happy if they'd do it in beef tallow, instead. But I guess you can't have everything. I've heard reviewers complain that the fries were salty, but I'm a bit of a salt-fan, so for me they were perfect. 
Burgers were extremely flavorful, and buns held up without getting soggy.
The only thing that gave me pause was when we ordered a milk-shake it came in a cup that was only 2/3 full. After awhile I noticed that there was writing on the cup explaining that it was actually supposed to be served ""glass half-full"" style, and giving some sort of explanation as to why, but I still thought that it was kind of skimpy for a shake that costs almost 5 bucks.
That being said, I still think that the rest of the food was DEFINITELY outstanding enough to warrant 5 stars.
I only wish that they had more than one of them in Vegas. (although maybe it's better for this fat girl if they don't!!)

One thing you're going to notice is that they're kind of small for the price but still an OK size and you paying for organic. Another is even though their brochures says that their Elevation Burgers comes with ""Double Meat, Double Cheese (Real Cheddar)"" cheese is extra even the plain cheddar cheese, at least that's what I was told so my burgers came with NO cheese.

When I was there there was a large group meeting, a loud bunch, the cashier said someone was attempting a 10 patties Vertigo Burger which seemed cool at the time, she was excited and wanted to watch. But after seeing how small the patties were I probably could've done that with ease, if it wasn't for their steep price. Let's do the math if my one elevation burger with 2 patties cost $5.29 then a 10 patties burger is probably around $25, guesstimating. I don't know about that one.

The Elevation Burger I had had lettuce, tomatoes, caramelized onions, elevation sauce (everyone version of big mac/thousand island sauce), balsamic mustard, and jalapenos.  Almost all of their topping that didn't cost extra. I really liked the combination everything rocked except the patties, tasted like it need more seasoning.  The other burger combinations were similar just changing a few ingredients and topppings, which I liked.

They have punch cards for every patty you order once you get 14 I think you get a Elevation Burger free.  

It's located by a Panera Bread and a Panda Express and the parking lot was very busy during lunch.

The Elevation Burger burger (double meat & real cheddar cheese) was hearty and very yummy. The beef patties are about a half-inch thick, very juicy, and thankfully not doused in salt. They are actually slightly under-seasoned, but since most of the competing alternatives are usually pink-slimed salt bombs, I'm happy to season it to my taste.

It's a messy burger and every bite was delicious. I only had the burger but the fries looked really good. I went there one other time and ordered the Elevation Burger protein-style (lettuce-wrapped instead of a bun) -- I would *not* recommend doing that (it's a hot, wet, juicy, greasy mess) unless you're using a knife and fork.

The staff members are extremely enthusiastic but it's understandable. Unfortunately, as someone else noted, the practice of yelling out customers' names as their orders come up is somewhat awkward and unnerving, and should be discontinued, please. 

I try to eat burgers only very occasionally so I don't blimp out, but if I'm going to have a fast-food burger I'll definitely be having it at Elevation.",QYZG3PbsdSwAXqhrzwZ5JQ,0,0,5,v4Je1ieEpOsXh3mBz6Hp6w
2798932,2012-05-29,2,_7kVnn5_19ckuFPS9PCrpQ,"On my first visit I thought the burgers were under seasoned. The second visit confirmed it.

A standard Elevation burger is two patties, two slices of cheese. They also have single patty burgers and cheeseburgers available, along with two types of veggie burgers.

Their main selling point that differentiates them from the competition is their 100% USDA-certified organic, grass-fed, free-range. I like the beefiness and juiciness of the patties, but they have a distinct taste that's unlike your typical fast food/fast casual burger. If they just seasoned them more they would be so much better. The buns are soft and chewy, the fries are good, and the toppings are diverse -- including their tangy Elevation sauce, a balsamic mustard, and 6-month aged cheddar cheese.

Their large cookie isn't so large. It's a chocolate chip oatmeal pecan cookie that's shaped like a small hockey puck. It does, however, pack a tasty punch.

If you're lactose intolerant I wouldn't recommend their chocolate shake. It's pretty much melted ice cream that's incredibly rich and creamy.

My kid wasn't a fan of their grilled cheese. They take their hamburger buns, turn them upside down and place cheese in between them. Not traditional by any means, and not a hit with my four year old.

Their staff has been friendly and informative on my visits -- always willing to answer any questions -- and the interior is reminiscent of Chipotle, but lighter.

As expected, it's pricier because of all the organic, sustainable ingredients. All that stuff makes for a good sales pitch, but in the end it comes down to taste and that's where they fall short. I still prefer In-N-Out or even Smashburger if I'm going to get fast food.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,9,5,3,fomznQ0Qk37I3sfaADThpA
2812391,2012-06-07,0,_7kVnn5_19ckuFPS9PCrpQ,"The menu is very similar to the franchises of Smash Burger and Five Guys.

The size of the burger and fries seem to portray similarity to the In-N-Out burger. The difference of the fries is that they are a bit more ""soggy."" The taste was just mediocre in comparison to other burger joints.

The fountain drink dispenser is AMAZING here though. They have the new Coca-Cola produced machine with 100(s) of flavors!

I shan't be doing that in the near future, but I figured since I was in Vegas and had a lot of free time, I should knock out the burgers on my bookmark list.  I thought the odds were against this place because it was only 3.5 stars on Yelp and it was the 3rd burger in 3 days.

My cousin and I stopped here for a late lunch before the drive back to the O.C.  I ordered the Elevation burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and elevation sauce (their thousand spread).  The burger came out pretty quick and you could taste the difference in the patty comparing it with larger fast food chain quality burger patties.  The cheddar cheese was excellent and sharp.  The burger was juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  The fries are nothing special and also on the pricey side.  Their iced tea has a hint of sweetness.  Usually, I get my iced tea unsweetened and I hate the sweet kind, but this subtle sweetness was pretty dang good.

I think Elevation has a good business model and the prices are a bit higher due to the grass fed beef they use in their burgers, but I think the price point is still a tad too high for what it is.  But nonetheless, the burger is solid if you want to try it.

First off, they promote green life (grass fed beef, recycling, turning fryer oil into bio fuel, etc.), which is nice, and they have a beautiful joint.  Their customer service is pretty good, but needs more fine tuning, which will more than likely occur in the next few months as they settle in.  Their food, however, is what Yelpers want to hear about, so let's have at it.

Their patties are juicy, well seasoned and tender.  I love the fact that their burgers take maybe 2 minutes to cook fresh with all the trimmings, and that they let you try any toppings you want to add on.  Their buns are nice and aren't too sweet, which is always good.  Overall, the burger itself is yummy.

They have shakes and you can't go wrong with a nice, thick shake.  I had to use a spoon with mine, but that's the fun in it.  They are yummy, huge, and satisfying.

The fries left me wanting.  They're okay, but they aren't the best in the world.  I believe that they can do better, and hope that they do.  Oh, and it doesn't hurt to salt them just a tad.  Everyone likes seasoned fries.

Overall, great fun, good food, and I'd go back some day.  I think I'll give them six months till the next visit to see how much they improve, but it is worth a curious stop in for those who like the hot new businesses on the block.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,1,3,v0ilgnuEWeb0ogOb8fvdiA

It was the burger that would revolutionize the fast food industry geared towards adults with a more sophisticated palette.  You probably recall the countless commercials on your tube.   Yah.......that was the Arch Deluxe - the burger that ultimately flops more than Derek Fisher.................but at least Fisher has 5 NBA rings.  

Elevation Burger is what the Arch Deluxe aspired to be --  a simple, tasty, yet sophisticated burger that is elevated by its commitment to core, fresh ingredients.  

Elevation Burger is like taking In and Out, a 5 star fast food burger joint, and taking it to the next level.....minus the 15 car wait!  

Every burger should be accompanied with caramelized onions and either the Elevation Sauce or Balsamic Mustard.  Also sprinkle on a little salt which will take your burger to the next level.   The meat is insanely delicious.  I recommend just pulling a piece off by itself to taste the meat.  You'll immediately see the difference.

The fries are cooked in EVOO and you can wash it down with any soda mixing of your choice from their rock star soda machine.  If you don' t know what I""m talking about, go see for yourself.   

So is it healthy?  I won't spout off statistics or numbers but I measure the guilt by what I call the Pass Out Factor.   When I eat at 5 Guys Burgers, I pass out.

Normally, the flavor lies in the fat and grease but somehow these burgers managed to be greasy and flavorless.  This was really kind of disappointing because healthy food can taste good.

Luckily for us both, it turned out to be an awesome decision. For those of you who think the burger is bland, I ask, how much crap are you putting on your burgers? I am very simple in topping choices, cheese (which is extra, granted) and a little ketchup. But that means the burger has to be good, because that's what I'm tasting. And it was delicious! The bun gave it just a touch of sweetness on the back end, and it was everything I could have wanted. The fries were excellent too.

After shopping at Buffalo Exchange, everyone was hungry. However, my soon-to-be daughter-in-law was craving Panda Express. It must have been the heat because I wanted to laugh and tease her that we can get Panda Express any time in Hawaii! But, she's a sweetheart and I had to look up the nearest Panda Express.

During this time, my husband who was driving the other vehicle shared he wanted Jamba Juice (grrrr...like I know where everything is in Vegas, right?)

Since we were on the opposite side of town from our vacation rental, I figured it would be feasible to drive closer to our vacation rental and find a Panda Express and Jamba Juice considering our first event for the family reunion was that night.

We didn't end up at Jamba Juice. However, I was happy to see that the Panda Express was located in the same area as the Super Walmart that we shopped at the night before!

In my mind, I kept saying ""I don't want Panda Express. I'm not feeling oriental. I'm not feeling beef broccoli! Wait...there is no In and Out but what is Elevation Burger?!""

I zoomed in on that sign and shared with my husband to sit in the car with our grandson who was fast asleep with the AC running. 

I walked in and thank the heavens...NO LINE

I looked at the menu and the sides were ala carte to the burger. The prices looked pretty decent for a burger with me not registering (again) that the fries were around the same price as the burgers (I noticed in a recent review they've brought down the price of the fries).

I ordered two cheeseburgers (you have your choice of cheese and condiments added).

They didn't have the bottled water drink that was on the menu but the cheap Nestlee bottled water that was the same whopping price of the other brand bottle water. 

The soda machine was the prettiest and coolest thing ever for this island girl because I thought it was a water machine. Nope. It is a soda machine that I though only served Fanta Orange soda with the other cola flavors. I was wrong! As I pressed the fanta button..ASSORTED flavors under FANTA popped up. If I could play around with that machine, I would have done that but that alone would have gotten me kicked out. 

The place is pretty roomy, airy, and clean.

Customer service is friendly and easy-going. 

The total price is not friendly at all but with organic beef when is it cheap, right? 

For two burgers, drinks and fries...we paid a whopping $23 (Whopping must be my word of the day).

However, when we bit into the burgers...I didn't mind the price at all. It was juicy, big, messy but so worth the calories consumed (I entitled myself to indulge on the vacation...not much, though).

The burger itself is tasty - I liked the meat.  I especially appreciate that you order it just how you'd like it - no mystery toppings - you get what you ask for.  

I had a kid burger, which is code for one burger patty.  The standard elevation burger is a double.  There is a list of about 20 topping to choose from but some key choices are missing.  Um, hello??? Where's the BACON??? No avocado or mushrooms either??? These are some big players - and they aren't even on the team!

The fries were tasty but need to be consumed immediately on the premise - they would not travel well.  An order of fries is good to share.  

I had a vanilla shake with fresh mangoes.  I couldn't taste the mango at all, which was strange because they were very obviously blended in there!  My mom was thrilled with her 1/2 coffee 1/2 chocolate malt.  

All in all - A -OK burger place that makes it fresh to order how you want it.  I'll go again.  

The downside is the calories are displayed next to everything.  It really hurts your feeling when you have to see that the cheeseburger, fries and shake you are about to consume are a whopping 1500 kals.  Boo!

They do have the fancy digital soda machine like 5 guys that allows you to choose from hundreds of sodas like peach sprite zero, and vanilla mr. pibb.

Their ingredients are fresh, no worries there. But there is so much excess juice/oil in their burger it drips and falls apart on you while you eat it. Their fries are not memorable, nothing special about them.
I was excited about their elevation cookie, but upon eating it, it failed as well. Tasted like dough, uncooked cookie. Looks like they sliced a chunk off the roll of dough and bagged it up for customers.
Once again, I had high hopes but at $18.55 for two elevation burgers, fries, one drink and a cookie, we will probably not be returning. I spend less than that in buying organic beef from Costco and making my own burgers.",ApcjKI4cfYsGOlY0lN4vLQ,1,0,2,jNVUe_RS-1VoV1wQEaH5Vw

The burger was ok.  It wasn't bad, but I would rather have and in & out burger.  Plus, I felt like it was cooked like a fast food burger.

If you thought Vegas had enough burger chains, you thought wrong! Here's another hipster alternative! Cows are meant to eat grass. Organic is better. Everyone should recycle. And a burger that's good for you is good for them too.

Elevation is the future of fast food. Not necessarily based on the technology they're using, but by appealing to our humanity. Every foodie can appreciate proper business practices. Its one thing to run a business; its another to do everything possible to make money but do it with your dignity and integrity intact. 

BURGER: A burger with 2 patties is the norm. You have 3 options: beef, veggie w/ mozz, or vegan. A single patty is a ""kids burger.""  Because eating a single patty is only enough to feed a child...  After selecting your patty-options, you move on to building your own masterpiece by selecting as many of the toppings as your heart desires. A slice of fancy, aged cheddar cheese will cost you some extra cents though. The beef is a little softer, definitely leaner than most places, but it has a  refreshingly clean taste. I can tell the cow or cows it came from were happy, free-range, and grass-fed. You can taste the different.

FRIES: Never have I ever had fries deep-fried in olive oil. Essentially, olive oil is far healthier than the usual vegetable or canola. But the smoke point is significantly lower so it yields a soggier fry. Mine were a little limp and a little heavy on the salt. 

SHAKE: If my friend didn't have an appreciation for ice cream. It never would've occurred to me to order a milkshake. I don't eat ice cream anymore--I spent a lot of time working for Coldstone as a kid (you do the math). The $4 shake starts with a  vanilla, chocolate, or coffee base with 2 toppings. This milkshake tickled my sweet tooth and touched my soul. After my first taste, ""his"" milkshake was reclaimed as ""my"" milkshake.

ECO-FRIENDLY: My house is quite strict on the recycling rule. Elevation is the same! They'll clear the table for you as they want separate every piece of trash and dispose of it accordingly.

1) atmosphere - clean, open, variety of seating (counter, tables larges and small)
2) service - everyone was friendly and seemed interested in providing a good experience
3) shakes - one vanilla, one chocolate - both really good

The not so good:
1) beef patties - were thin and seemed a bit overdone in some places, resulting in the meat being not tender and dry. We ordered two burgers with two patties with regular toppings and added sautéed onions on both, and one with jalapeños. The toppings were skimpy and although came with house sauce, the beef was so dry and bland, both had to be drenched with ketchup while eating to provide some additional moisture and flavor.
2) veggie pattie #2 - was ok. Asked for sauteed onions and lettuce -toppings a bit skimpy with a limp piece of lettuce and a few onions.
3) fries - were a bit too oily. They are thinly sliced (like In and Out) and seemed to soak up the olive oil too much.

The hours on Yelp said that Elevation Burger opens at 10am, but they have changed and open at 11am now. We got there around 10:50 and I walked into the glass door. Walking away, we went to Pier 1 to kill some time and came back to a friendly apology. Between the two of us, we wanted to try as much as humanly possible without dying. 

Our order consisted of one Half the Guilt burger with one beef patty and one vegan patty, one vegan burger, one order of their french fries, one vanilla milkshake with key lime flavoring and mangoes, one fountain drink, and two bags of their mini cookies. All of this food for $20. Yes, they are more expensive than certain chains, but they also provide a different service. My sister and I was impressed with the veggie patty. You could see all of the individual ingredients and it was crisp on the outside. The fries are a little soggy, but tasted delicious. I got a drink so that I could play around with the Coke machine. I am not a pop drinker, so I ended up dumping it and went for the Cinnamon Orange Ice Tea instead. It was lightly sweetened and was so refreshing. I could have emptied the container if we were there any longer.

 The burger meat itself doesn't have much taste, so I don't think they season their meat, but they have a lot of free toppings to help it out. We tried the Elevation burger...I'm guessing it was from the cheese but it was very greasy. Surprised since this is supposed to be a healthier burger. Even with the Balsamic Mustard and Carmalized Onions, it still didn't have much flavor. 
 You can tell the fries are fresh, they were on the crisp side too. Pretty good, I've never had fries cooked in olive oil, I'm a fan! They didn't even need the Elevation dipping sauce they offer you.
The women's bathroom surprised me in that they had no toilet seat cover dispenser in the stall. If it was an old restaurant I would understand. But they do provide a step stool for the kiddies to wash their hands at the sink. The prices are decent. Be sure to get your card punched for a free burger after 6 patties purchased.

5549900,2012-04-24,3,_7kVnn5_19ckuFPS9PCrpQ,"I'm a fan of the concept of this restaurant in general, but when I came here I thought that the burgers would be just like eating at Super Duper in San Francisco, which is one of my favorite burgers on earth.  They both have that same organic/healthy thing going on.  

However, the flavor is much different than other burgers, and it may not be a good thing depending on your taste buds.  My husband, for example, is not a huge fan of the flavor.  But then you examine the calorie count, fat, etc, and you see that elevation burger is much leaner than your average burger, which accounts for the different taste.  

Super Duper - 670 calories, 41g fat
Elevation Burger - 510 calories, 26g fat

And since people in Vegas mostly haven't heard of Super Duper, here's In and Out, which is the same it seems as Super Duper:

In and Out - 670 calories, 41g fat

So basically, Elevation Burger is trying to give you that amazing experience of having a really great cheeseburger that is actually made of beef and not some crappy veggieburger, but with almost 50% less fat and less calories, which is pretty damn cool.  You can even trim the calorie count further by lettuce wrapping it, and it's still good.

The fries are wonderful, but I always love frying in olive oil.  I prefer it to all other oils.

My only real complaint is that they don't have a drive through like In and Out, which is the only thing stopping me from eating here more often.  I really hope they open more of these around town.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,9,6,4,NnPuRujOrnZiwSNKiPh37g

Stop the bus, Gus!  What is this Elevation Burger joint parked right next store?  This is usually where they seasonally sell really bad Halloween costumes.

Turns out this new kid on the block is about organic, grain-fed, range free beef.  Ok, I am a branding guy and the logo, color scheme and graphics are nice but their brochure is a little too over the top.  They talk about how much they care for their cows - guess what, I am eating that cow right now!  I speak with endearment about my late grandmother but I don't want to see her ground up in a cheeseburger.

Ok, down to business.  Pretty similar format to the 5-Guys place.  You have your base burger and then you can pick and choose.  I like this type of format.  Even though I am an In-and-Out fan and just settle for their secret sauce, sometimes I just want mayo, mustard, tomato and lettuce.  Done deal here.

By the time we left, I was reasonably sure that I would return.  For, the experience was definitely positive.

Although this business, like other burger emporiums, will only make well done burgers, our Cheeseburgers happily were juicy rather than dry.  I liked the 
Elevation Sauce on both the burger and fries.  It was similar to a light whipped Thousand Island Dressing.  I also liked that the sliced pickles in a burger resembled the inside of a fried pickle.  And, the skin-on fries were flexible and excellent in taste.  Made in EVOO, besides sporting half the calories of ordinary oils, orders of fries were real big.  A single order could amply suit most couples. 

But I was less thrilled with the smallish Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which was composed of two hamburger buns facing back to back with melted Cheddar Cheese thrust in between.  The whole concoction seemed to be hastily slapped together and a cheap excuse to avoid providing real sandwich bread.

Available drinks were quite fun and entertaining.  Root Beer Floats are constructed to order.  I chose a bottle of Wild Bill's Root Beer made with cane sugar to serve as the foundation for my float, and was not disappointed.

But I also enjoyed playing with the magic Coca-Cola Flavor Machine that the restaurant manager said was directly hooked to the Coca-Cola Company, so the soft drink company knows how many beverages have  been sold in a given day.  Of the many diverse flavors the machine was able to spit out on demand,  I liked both the Barq's Vanilla Coke and the Barq's Diet Vanilla Coke, which I cheerfully added to my Root Beer Float.  Scoops of Blue Bunny Chocolate, Vanilla, and Coffee Ice Cream were the available choices for shakes, malts, and floats.  Diane also added and enjoyed Oreo Cookies and Chocolate Syrup to enhance her Chocolate Shake.  

The staff was very friendly and almost overeager to please.  While we were eating, three different restaurant employees came up separately to inquire if we were enjoying everything.  Food orders arrived on metal trays with elevated sides, that I thought looked rather cool.  It was just another special touch emblematic of the whole dining experience.

Besides the wholesome beef burger they also have vegetarian and vegan options that are all made to order, that pretty much sum up the draw of this relatively new burger establishment in the SW part of Las Vegas.  

The restaurant was packed on my first visit, and the line was about 15 deep.  And I was looking to see if they have a petting zoo section hidden nearby, where you can hand feed fresh cut grass to some happy cows, considering the large contingent of toddlers and babies in strollers that were at Elevation Burger during that visit.  The middle of the restaurant was literally packed with knee-high kids giggling, running around and some falling down.  It definitely added to the energy of the place.

The menu overall is fairly straight forward.  What kind of patties (options are beef, vegetarian or vegan) do you want, and how many, with or without their aged cheddar cheese ($0.50 extra per burger) and do you want it with or san the buns, plus their plethora of toppings.

They have real ice cream shakes or malt, plus the super duper soda machine that dispenses mind boggling varieties of carbonated and non-carbonated fountain drinks.  If that is not to your liking, they also have bottled drinks in the cooler on your way to the friendly cashier/order taker.  In fact everyone there makes it a priority to be friendly to their customers, which I always appreciate.

As far as the food, my burgers were served hot with fresh cold lettuce, tomato and pickles. The Elevation Burger (2x beef patties) with the cheese upgrade was a solid burger.  The Half The Guilt Burger with the Vegan patty was good and exceeded my expectation (the vegan patty was nicely seasoned and packed with flavors).  It is better than most fast food burgers, but they are still not as good as In-N-Out or The Longhorn (my current favorite burger at LBS).

The chocolate Malt I ordered was creamy and thick. You have the option to add toppings from their menu as well.

I would go back if I am shopping nearby, plus to support a business that is eco-friendly. But I don't think I would be going about my day doing whatever I happened to be doing and get a craving for one of the Elevation Burgers like I would for a Double Double Animal Style.

But if you are counting calories or solidly in the organic food movement, than Elevation Burger is definitely for you.

Service:  4/5  Friendly, but somewhat slow. Then again it was packed when I went.

Price:  3/5  Premium pricing for the healthier for you and the planet organic and sustainable beef patties burger.

Food:  3.5/5  Solid, healthy, lower calories burgers, but maybe some of the potential flavor is reduced as well.

Parking:  3/5  In a busy strip mall, but there are also a lot of parking spaces.

Solid healthy burger joint deserving of a solid A-OK recognition.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,12,5,3,WDKidRu8aefn6YbMaysdfw

The menu is pretty simple. I like the concept of green food, but I wasn't entirely impressed with any of the flavors. The meat was definitely tasty and fresh, you can tell. Although I wasn't in the mood for a burger so ended up ordering a grilled cheese with jalapenos. That was probably a mistake on my part. They have vegetarian and vegan patty options as well, which I'm intrigued by. 

The fries were fresh, but I wasn't a fan of the flavor. I'm not typically a big fan of fries and these just weren't cutting it for me. Maybe I'm just too used to processed food, hopefully that's not the case. They have a great concept and maybe just need to work through the kinks. The service was definitely fantastic. We always had someone asking if we needed anything and asking if we were enjoying our meal. 

I don't know how motivated I am to go out of my way to return, but it's a good option if you're in the area.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,6,3,sMR9n6DGWhcV6_Q1Vle1ww
