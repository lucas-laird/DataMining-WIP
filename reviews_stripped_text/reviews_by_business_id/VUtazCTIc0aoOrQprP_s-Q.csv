The staff was very friendly and food came quick, although it wasn't really full when we went. Found a new favorite drink, it's a specialty drink called ""Whiskey Girl"", which came in a mason jar. I'm a fan of Jack so I had to try it. If anyone remembers what is in this drink feel free to let me know. Got to have more of this drink!",XQANf3d1VlImr_qNlkuC-g,0,2,5,qV8Xql6rwYq2ubEPLX10xQ

80894,2016-06-03,0,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"Updated review.  This place keeps going downhill.  We come here normally 3 times a year and we finally decided not to return.  The food and service continues to fall well below what you would expect from this place. 

We went over the past few years from big fans to stay away.  This most recent visit, we came in for lunch and got Nachos & the Cowboy Reuben. The nachos were just ok.  The Cowboy Reuben corned beef brisket was dry and the bread just overpowered the sandwich.  Too much bread.  

We have tried many things on the menu in the past from burgers, quesadillas, and chicken sandwiches, wings, pulled pork, soups and wraps.  Everything is just blah.  Not worth the money and the service is hard to come by.  We are really disappointed in this place and will go elsewhere in the future.  It is truly a shame that this place just keeps going downhill.  Toby, do something about it!  You lost a big fan.",Hc0v8M1RP6sUuFQ2_zLP6Q,5,0,1,AQerVrZjpReFQ6YQKI2yDw

The environment was awesome: country music playing with the wild bartenders doing tricks nonstop. Service was good, the waitress was pretty quick and knowledgable with the menu..she made a couple recommendations that turned out to be awesome. The food was top notch!! All 9 of us agreed that the fries were the best we had ever had. I got an old western burger that is up there as one of the top 10 hamburgers I have ever had. Everyone else had great things to say about the food. As for the prices, it's Vegas, of course they are going to be high. This was one of the cheaper dinners we had though, my burger and fries were only $15..I paid 20+ for muuuuch worse throughout the weekend. Looks like it would be a fun place to visit at night with the floor for line dancing and very entertaining bar tenders.

I expected more from a big name like Toby Keith and for a restaurant on the las vegas strip.
The service was terrible.  The lady who took my order didn't bring it or didn't check to see how the meal was also getting my beverage took way longer then it should. I ordered the rib plate and never got any extra bbq sauce the entire meal. Also I was supposed to receive rolls w mini cornbread and butter which I did not get! When my waitress finally came back to give my check I told her I never received my rolls and she asked me if I still wanted it?

Likeable staff, the usual loud sports stuff, but still places not quite full volume if you look around. Food is unfortunate as you expect in Las Vegas. Indifferent prep and presentation.  Buying less expensive entree would probably be a better call to reduce the ripped off sensation that really adds to the insult.  Beware of being offered a ""double"" when ordering drinks. Not only is the price double, but they then add another ""double fee"" on top of that. The drink costs more than a rib eye dinner!  Pretty clever.

346095,2012-04-18,7,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"I hate this bar and grill.  Seriously.

We had some friends in town that had enjoyed Toby Keith's a few years ago and wanted to go back.  So we made the stop at Harrah's on a late Sunday afternoon.  On the way to the casino, I called ahead to make reservations.  You can't.  So I asked how busy they were, expecting the girl on the other end of the phone to tell me there would be a wait.  Instead, I was told ""We are the opposite of busy.""  Things weren't looking good already.

We were immediately seated and I enjoyed the feel of the place.  I'm not into country music but I don't mind it playing in the background.  It's pretty much an Applebee's or TGI Fridays feel, except with a country theme.  But you can only enjoy the scenery for so long....

We waited, and waited, and waited.  It took at least 15 minutes before our server even came over to greet us and get our drink orders.  Someone in my group wanted one of the specialty mixed drinks that are listed on the back of the menu (the ones that come in mason jars - 19 flipping dollars).  When my friend asked how much a 16-ounce version of the drink would be, she was told it was $12 but it would only come with a half a shot in it.  What??  I'm going to just say that we misheard or she misspoke, because that can't be right at all.  And the bad signs kept on coming....

I would say a good half hour went by before we got our meals.  I ordered the quesadillas with veggies and they were awful.  DRIPPING in grease- I had to blot them with napkins just so I didn't get grease on my clothes.  It was served with some sad shredded iceberg, mushy chopped tomatoes, and a super boring poblano salsa.  I managed to eat half and then called it a day.  $13, but worth $0.

My husband ordered the Ranch House Salad.  It claims to come with iceberg AND romaine, but there was only iceberg in that bowl.  Unless you're talking about a wedge salad, iceberg lettuce just screams cheap ingredients and that little thought went into making the salad.  He also got a couple of slices of tomato, a little bit of cheese and croutons, and about a tablespoon of corn.  On the side were two enormous containers of ranch dressing- you know, in case you want to eat 1200 calories in salad dressing during your meal.   $12, but worth about $6.

We also got a side of fries for $5.  They were actually really good (especially with all the leftover ranch from my husband's salad) and the portion was pretty generous.

My friends ordered the She's a Hottie Wrap and the Steak Sandwich.  I didn't hear anything good or bad about their food or the mason jar drink.

We then proceeded to wait again for the check and for it to be brought back to sign once we paid.  Our drinks were refilled once the entire time we were there.

When it was all said and done, my friend said that a few years ago it was a fun place to be.  Now there's just terrible service despite the fact that the place had zero customers.  There are typical overpriced menu items like you'll find all over the Strip and ridiculous price differences for Harrah's players card members vs. non-card customers.  

Do yourself a favor and go next door to the Venetian and eat at Grand Luxe- similar food and price but better quality and service with a larger menu.  Toby Keith's will do if you are starving and have a broken leg and you can't hop any farther before you pass out from hunger.

Oh, and there's a $6 charge if you want to split a meal with someone.  There should be crimes against stupid pricing like this.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,12,2,1,Z5yaySXciLSmNXWjHxyrzA

438122,2012-09-25,0,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"Three years ago when I started visiting Vegas on vacations I loved going to Toby Keith Bar because it had a great country feeling with a fun staff. The last two times I have come however it has been the complete opposite. The only reason it was so horrible the last two times was because of the bartenders. The first time I went we had a guy bartender who was giving attitude to every guy around us for no reason and only paid attention to hot girls who flirted with him. I would sit there forever waiting for a drink and when he finally got to me he got my order wrong and when I told him he told me I didn't tell him that drink and he made a big seen throwing my drink in the trash and giving me a dirty look. Later on in the night I saw him be rude to many polite customers and even kiss a few female customers which disgusted me since he had a wedding ring on. 

We came back the next time we were in Vegas hoping he wouldn't be there which he wasn't, thank God! Yet we ended up with the same problem. The bar was practically empty yet me and my husband waited fifteen minutes for a drink because the bartender was to busy flirting with two girls sitting at the bar. Every time this one girl took a sip of her drink he would pour a little more wine in. Then when he finally got to us all I asked for was a malibu and coke and he somehow screwed it up and I couldn't get his attention again to tell him so I had to go to another section of the bar to tell another bartender.

Sorry I know I am rambling on but I have been to a lot of bars in my life and have never been so angry by the service of a bartender. I use to love this place but I highly doubt I will ever go back because the bartenders care more about getting girls than keeping customers happy.",tBTO4XCsAPFJXa-gvq2p6g,0,0,1,0PrjoL5dUF12ADRBlGOHLw

We were there this weekend and got free concert tickets and all access wrist bands for TOBY!!!! It was amazing!

On to the positive because I really hate having to write anything negative unless I think it will really help someone else.

I guess it's a guilty pleasure, 15 bucks for a bologna sandwich is kinda steep though don't ya think?  I mean Bologna is the cheapest lunchmeat you can buy at the deli counter isn't it?!?

I just like the taste of it dammit, I'm sure as hell not dieting!

DRAFT of course, I can drink it out of the bottle at home!   SOOOOO anyway out comes a HUGE mason jar filled with hoppy goodness and it was literally a quart!  So the mrs and I have a conversation about what a good deal that is at a strip-staruant!

I'm not the type to throw a fit, so after paying $44 all weekend, I paid the $50 and still tipped him pretty good.

676650,2011-04-02,1,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"I am reviewing this place after eating there only one time...but I must say, I am IN LOVE WITH TOBY KEITH'S!

First, the food:

Amazing. That is how I would describe it. I got the Baby Back Ribs and had the biggest grin on my bbq-covered face as I savored each bite. Never have I eaten something more delicious. I understand how there are plenty of other places YOU might have been that contradict that, and I just may eat at crappy restaurants, but I am serious when I say it was the best Ribs I have ever eaten. I sampled some food from everyone in my party, and everything was absolutely incredible.

Next: the drinks:

I'll keep this short because I only had one drink (and some of others), but their drinks tasted really good. I only ordered at the table and not the bar, but what I had was delicious and I approve.

The atmosphere:

From what I saw, there was the eating area, a bar, a dance floor, and a stage with live music. The place was very loud, and country music was blaring, but it was entertaining. I have no interest in country music whatsoever but I still enjoyed the music and had a great time. There were dancers on some of the tables that were absolutely gorgeous. I was temped to just be a creeper at the bar because of how beautiful the girls were, but then again, that would be creepy :P

Finally, the staff:

I had no issues at all with the staff. We had not made a reservation so we had to wait maybe 30 minutes (but again, there were dancers, so I didn't mind standing around). When the time to be seated finally came, we were placed right near the stage. It was loud so we requested a different table. They quickly accommodated us and moved us closer to the entrance. The waitress then came by and took our orders, and was on point to bring our appetizers/drink refills whenever needed. Our food was prepared very quickly and everyone's order was perfect.

Final verdict?

Like I said before, I have only eaten here once. The one time I was there I had an awesome time. I loved the food, the atmosphere, and everything about the place. I told a friend eating with me that I will come back every time I am in vegas, and that I must bring my family there. The food was top notch and the service was great.

Location:
The Bar and Grill is located in the dark depths of Harrahs. For Vegas, this is an indicator for a bottom tier restaurant. The patrons attracted to this locale are often those that are above mid 40s, Harrahs itself is like a retirement community so it comes off as no surprise. 

Menu:
The food menu consists of anything but save a few healthy options, salads are the only choice. Other than the salads, you can tell in the quality and portions of food why obesity runs rampant in America. The food is everything that can almost be thought of when you think of a southern dive bar. 

Beverages:
The choices of beverage is limited in beer, but the cocktails make up what is lacking in the frothy pours. Cocktails are a little new concoction and a little twisted oldies.

We looked at menu items such as ""Star Spangled Salad"" and ""Knock Yourself Out"" Nachos before settling on the equally healthy fried Mac and Cheese.

The first night we went in around 1-2 am and there was a live band playing. The service at the bar was very good and fast - but a 16oz beer is $13.50 which is pretty expensive even for Vegas. The rest of the night was fun, my girlfriend and I danced to the band and had a good time. 

Now the next day was a different experience. We came to get some lunch around 1pm and we were seated quickly and our waitress was friendly and the service was fast. BUT, I ordered the steak sandwich medium-rare and it came out bleeding red. I ate a few bites of the sandwich but that was it - way too bloody to eat any more. The sandwich came with fries but I was so turned off by the sandwich that I barely ate any of those. When the waitress asked how everything was I told her about how the sandwich was way too bloody and she told her manager about it. The manager came over and said ""I heard your steak sandwich was too bloody, is there anything I can do?"" I told her that I hadn't paid my bill yet and so she told me she could discount it. Before she left I asked her if she saw the sandwich and she said no, but ""I talked to the chef and he said that it was way too bloody."" 

So the chef sent out a sandwich that he knew wasn't cooked correctly, and then the manager only took $3 off of the sandwich/fries meal that was almost $20 and I had only eaten a few bites - after she admitted they messed up the order.  You would assume they would take the item off of the bill, but no. 

To top it all off, I asked for an extra pickle spear because that was the only thing that I actually ate that came with my meal and got charged for it.

A friend of mine from NYC (whose father is an executive with Caesars Entertainment, the parent company of Harrah's) decided to use family connections for his birthday dinner...and we all got an invitation that the dinner was to be held at Toby Keith's. Wait, what? I was confused to say the least and had to call other people who I knew were also invited before we figured out what and where Toby Keith's was.

This place reminds of my college days at the University of Arizona in Tucson: cowboy hats, country music and lots of Jack Daniels bottles used as decoration. There was live music and the main singer looked like a skinnier Toby Keith. The restaurant was loud and our waitresses handled our large (and mostly obnoxious, though in good fun) party very well.

As for the food, I ordered the ""hottie wrap"" which is a sun dried tomato tortilla filled with strips of fried chicken (I know, not part of my usual diet but with all the Jack Daniels decorations around I felt fried anything was appropriate somehow) and lots of veggies. My guilty conscience made me ask for fat free ranch instead of bleu cheese. The wrap tasted fresh and everyone enjoyed their food. Orders ranged from burgers, to wings, to mac & cheese.

I'm not going to lie, our party of 20 people had an awesome time. Everything was on the house so needless to say the drinks were flowing. I didn't partake in any of the speciality cocktails because they all come in giant mason jars. I wanted something a little daintier. Oh, and to make things interesting some man (in hindsight I pray it was the bartender) came around with a bottle and gave everyone in our party (guys and girls) shots. The atmosphere was very fun and it was a great birthday dinner setting for a loud group.",haSh72Q0MsQZUpWPeVgp0Q,4,4,4,CA-jD7rEHzBus7qvZIyAng

Since some of our experience was great and some not so much, I have decided on 3-1/2 stars.  The visit didn't start off so well.  We were told that we would have about a 10 minute wait.  No big deal at all, we just went next door to the gift shop. We were literally there for 5-6 minutes and made the 5 second trek back to the restaurant.  The  hostess informed us that she had called our name and had to give our table away and that we would have to go back on the ""list"".  Again, no problem, since it was later in the evening and it didn't seem busy in the slightest.  

At this point I would like to insert my opinion on the Hostess.  I truly believe that this person had something against smiling.  You would think that the business owner would want the first person that customers would come in to contact with would be a friendly, helpful person who appears to enjoy what they do.  To represent the brand in a positive way.  I expected a lot better, Toby!  

When we were led to our table, it was a little surprising that the place was less than half full.  As I mentioned, it was later in the evening but the Hostess made it seem as though it was packed!  Anyway, the food was a highlight, and since this is a restaurant, I guess that is what was most important!  We had the Brisket Nachos.  They were amazing!  My boys both had Bronco Burgers and they were HUGE!  They both loved them.  I had the Texas Cheesesteak.  It was good but not great in my opinion.  It was pretty soggy, but tasted pretty good.

Bobby had seats for us already so there was no wait time. Our server was friendly and took great care of us. They have TVs all over playing music videos and while most of it was obviously country music, they did play some Metallica and Pearl Jam LOL. Our table was lost in awesome conversation until we noticed my wife stuck on one of the TVs. They played 3 Luke Bryan videos back to back so we lost her for a bit. They have a bar you can sit at if you don't want to sit at a table or booth.

I had a Fried Mac and Cheese ball that was average. I was craving a burger so I looked over the menu to see what sounded good. I went with the Hottie Burger. The burger came with a hot link on it as well fried onions, lettuce, tomato and pepper jack cheese. The burger was cooked to my liking and tasted really good. The only complaint is that it was spicy at all. Not even a hint of heat. For a burger with a name ""Hottie"" in it you'd expect it to have a kick. While the burger was very good.... I would suggest they add some fried jalapenos in place of the fried onions. My wife had the Hottie Wrap and felt the same way. She said it tasted great and the amount of guacamole and other stuff inside her wrap was great but the chicken had no heat at all. The Fried Bologna sandwich yelper Anna got was effing interesting. I left stuffed. That's all.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,7,7,4,-RJxh7I2q3VGLkr1xX04fQ
1640444,2014-03-11,0,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"This is a bit off the beaten path. You have to make your way through Harrah's all the way to the back, up the escalator and then there it is.

So for some reason I have been here a few times, and each time I really thought the food was less than desirable. This time was a little different. 

The food is quite pricey for what it is. Yeah, you get a dollar off if you use your Total Rewards card, but really - it's still kind of expensive for just ok food. I got the chicken wrap last time and it was utterly inedible. I definitely won't get that ever again. Lots of wrap, not a lot of chicken.

This time, we ordered the fried macaroni and cheese and the brisket nachos. Let me say, I was pleasantly surprised. The mac and cheese balls were lightly battered and fried just crispy enough. The nachos - were heaping and the brisket was very good. good choices this time.

Next - the beer - so there isn't a great selection of draft beer - but the bonus is how large a draft beer is. I believe they are 22oz for $10. Which isn't bad. And of course you can take it to go in a plastic cup. (But don't try and bring your outside drink into TK's)

If you're with a lot of friends, a beer tower is definitely the way to go... 

Minuses - the whole bar area didn't have a server. So all the tables in the bar area hadn't been bussed and it was a total mess. It's not really a problem to order the food through the bar,  but just means getting up and down if you need other things. The bartender was friendly and helpful, but then you wonder what you're tipping for when you are getting up and down... but oh well.",7Df2b1aAe2JSts_46HubsA,0,0,3,yhS5-ZcltZCEN8NxZSdbAQ

The food smelled really good and my stomach was ready ;) We were seated near the bar area and once in a while during dinner you'd hear whistles going off and a showdown going on at the bar...a lively place for sure. Country music filled the place and TV monitors showed the latest music videos on CMT. The second thing i noticed about this place was some of the male waiters were hot. :P A big plus for me.

I started off with a drink, and I was surprised that my drink was going to cost $15!!!!! I understood when i received my Toad sucker Pond in a huge MASON JAR! These people take their booze very seriously...it was great! When my Burger and onion rings came out to the table i was amazed to find the onion rings stacked ON TOP of my burger rather than the traditional on-the side placing.

I think a lot of others thought the same thing and as a result there was one bartender running around trying to service the whole place. The service took longer than average and I had to ask where my appetizer was since it had taken so long.

Now I'm going to rate this place strictly as a bar, not as a grill, as I did not have any of the food. I came here on a Thursday night, and got in at about 10:30. No ID check, No cover charge, just walk on in and head up to the bar. Very cool.
There was a live band playing, but they were very, very good. Played mostly country, but threw in some old classics to get people on the dance floor. It's a very modern country type atmosphere, and a LOT of fun. Noticed the bras hanging all around the bar, always kind of funny to notice the different sizes and styles. 
All the drinks are served up in mason jars, pretty cool. Lots of beers on tap, although I decided with a Long Island Ice Tea. Very strong, and very good. Since it was my birthday, the bartender hooked me up with a free shot. Not quite sure what it is, but free booze is free booze. After about 30 minutes, the band decided to take a break, and a live DJ started up playing country hits, announcing FREE SHOTS at the bar. And boy, they weren't kidding. EVERYBODY made their way over to the bar, and the bartenders hooked everyone up with a free shot. Of course, the beautiful ladies had it poured into their mouth from the large dispenser, as it should be.
The bartenders were very cool, made some very cool drinks, and were very interactive with all the people hanging at the bar. The band was pretty damn good, and had a LOT of people on the dance floor. One young lady, TRASHED beyond belief, had everyone's attention, especially after throwing her panties to the drummer. A lot of folks boot scootin' and doing the electric slide. 
Good music, good times, and not a bad price. Definitely recommend this place as a chill alternative to the night clubs that dominate the Vegas scene. Stop in, relax, enjoy some good country, and drink your face off.",UY3x_8KhKlrqVSDE0QKV8A,0,0,4,nWN4oeqxoYUGqNttRnMb0g

My expectations for Harrah's wasn't high at all, and it met those expectations.

""I Love This Bar"" was basically the Hard Rock Cafe for Country meets Coyote Ugly. The place was loaded with Toby's records and hats and shirts he wore at certain events. The staff was sexy delicious. The outfits were as follows: cowboy hat, little black shirt that reads ""HOTTIE"", black booty panties, and black assless leather chaps. Possibly the greatest work uniform of all time? I think so.

The food was just ok. I got a western burger and it was gigantic. The fries were ""crusty"" and meh. Toby's ""I Love This Bar"" song and video came on and they announced free shots - so I ran over to the bar where the bartenders dump it straight from bottle inti to your mouth. Not a spritz either, like fill your mouth from throat to lips. Savage style. I kinda like it. Just because Mom had to try it - we got the Deep Fried Twinkie for dessert. When in Rome...

It didn't open until 11 which was a bit annoying, considering how hungry I was at 10 am, but eventually it did. Like many chains, there is a feeling of ""same old same old"" the moment you walk in, just like any Jimmy Buffet Margaritavilles or a Applebees. 

There was lot of country music and videos on the TV, mostly Toby Keith, and there are bra's hanging around the bar. A country western bar for sure! There is a stage for live music. The cool thing to do is order your beer in a giant mason jar (just Coors for the mason jar only). I hate Coors but I figured when in Rome....

The next day we popped by once again so she could get some souvenirs from the gift shop and pose with the cut-out photo of Toby.

i want to give more stars cuz i had a great time, but there were still some issues with this place. 

so, we get here at midnite or so on a weeknite. we're waiting in the crazy ass line just to get seated. there were 2 hostesses and they were complete crap. not nice, not friendly, fat women. ugh! not even a smile!!! anyways, we finally get seated. our waiter appeared to be only 1 of 3 waiters in the whole place. our waiter was really nice (a hispanic guy), but it looked like he was serving 10-15 tables (same as the other waiters). totally overworked. those hostesses? just walking around and harrassing our waiter to hurry up. i also work at a business that helps people out. i don't care what your freaking actual job description is. if i was that hostess, i would have helped bus the tables. not stand around gaining more pounds.

anyways, we told our waiter that we wanted the steak and eggs special. we were starving. the food came out so FAST. the steak, of course, was too dry and tough to eat. but, my eggs were made TO PERFECTION (exactly the way i love my eggs!) . the potato hash was awesome and the bread was good. after eating all of that, my stomach was super happy. i didn't eat most of the steak, but i'm ok with that. so freaking cheap.

and the country music?! well, they actually mixed up the country music with some main stream music (Lady Gaga, etc) so it wasn't too bad. even the country music wasn't that bad! shocker! i dunno, but somehow their country music was OK! and i hate country music! lol! 

the steak and eggs special was great, but don't expect high quality for so cheap. 

i might even come here again. even bigger shocker! lol",TdOoNMumDGROn_WInq1qgg,0,1,4,qw_6_wDSMDZLirdd5tGp6g

We went there tonight with a very large group of people, families, but the kids were aged between 14 and 20. We dropped down a combined $800 to $1000 on food and drinks. The food was just ok, I ordered the pulled pork which tasted ok but was a bit soggy. We were got there at about 9 pm and ate and then were just hanging out listening to the music and dancing. All of a sudden we are informed but a security gard that the dance floor is part of the bar, even though it is in the restaurant, and that our teenage girls had to get off the dance floor. Keep in mind they are all real dancers and not drunks staggering around with a beer in their hand and it is hard for them to hear music and not be compelled to do what they do best. 

Anyway in the end after complaining that we did not think a restaurant that allowed families should have this sort of policy banning their customers from dancing, we were basically escorted out of the restaurant by the security as the manager didn't want to deal with our argument.

That's disappointing because I like Toby Keith. But I can unequivocally say, I hate this bar. 
We had been out all day sightseeing and we needed a decent supper before bed. Harrah's has a bar that is themed after a Toby Keith song. I love this bar. So it looked kind of slow but there were folks eating at several tables. We have eaten at several of the restaurants  in the casino and they've been good. We got seated as we walked up and the waiter came and took our order. Hot wings for her and Fish and chips for me. When they brought her wings they left off the ranch. My order was complete but not completely fried. The breading on the cod fish was not crisp. It was soggy and a little runny on the inside. I took a bite and it was super hot temp wise. But the whole thing fell apart like it had been dunked in water. All of the fish were like this. The fries and slaw were good. As far as the wings went. They were still partly frozen. I grabbed the tip of the wing on one and it was literally cold to the touch. After spending the day in death valley, I'm very aware what hot vs. cold is. This was poor execution of what should be a simple fried order. 
One more thing. The sweet tea was way too sweet. Don't get me wrong,  I love sweet tea. I'm a southern guy and I've had sweet tea since I was 3 probably. I like it sweet. But not this sweet. Maybe you shouldn't even try to be southern, Vegas.",qHJnyJFBv9Ql1BxQMpd3iQ,1,2,1,4uDYfPWMG3QtoC4UlZHYKA

The Cajun Shrimp appetizer was decent -- a large portion, served hot, with a tasty dipping sauce. I believe the menu description is inaccurate in that the shrimp itself is not spiced at all. Not to say it's bad, just not what I was expecting.

The veggie wrap -- admittedly, not what most patrons are going to order in the land of excess that is Las Vegas -- was awful. The filling was about 95% shredded lettuce, with a few other bits of stuff thrown in for color, and a dressing that was not so much bland as just yucky. I considered sending it back, but it was nearly the only thing on the menu that didn't used to have hooves. By which I mean, I didn't have a lot of vegetarian-ish choices.

The service was slow throughout the meal, and the waitress had a habit of timing her drive-bys when I had a mouthful of food and couldn't say anything. As fast as she was moving, you'd think she'd make it back around more frequently, but no. Don't let your drink glasses get empty, as you'll be sitting there thirsty for a while.

All that said, the setting is lively, especially later at night when there's a band on stage. I'm not a fan of country or western, but I'd watch just about any good band live.

It was mostly all iceberg lettuce, there was hardly any chicken, no cucumbers or onions and barely any corn & onions and to boot it was $14.99.

I felt it was a rip off, the worst salad I have had for a long time.

My husband ordered the All American Burger, which came on a big bun, but the meat didn't even touch the edges of the bun, he said it was not very tasty, and it cost $13.99.

2719766,2017-01-08,12,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"Honestly, I did not know who Toby Keith until I actually looked him up on the Internet while we were dining.

When we are in Las Vegas, I often pick the place to eat when I am with my family.

However, this time around, since we were Casino hopping via the Monorail; I capitulated to the group's choice.

We normally eat at the other establishments and we don't go to Bar & Grills. But since everyone was famished, and they wanted to eat NOW, they chose the closest restaurant to our stop.

We were greeted by the hostess as we walked through the entrance. She was very pleasant and nice. This seemingly impromptu choice by my family seemed like it would turn out to be a good choice. The place was brightly lit, clean, spacious, and there were not that many patrons so we had plenty of great seats to choose from.

The hostess grabbed the menus, exited from the booth that she was situated in, and led us to our table. Now, the punch line here is that as we followed her; none of us could help but notice the fact that she was wearing chaps and nothing was covering her rear except for very small (and nearly non-existent) panties.

Well, this was a great choice - Family!? I had this perplexed look on my face, as I stared onto my wife's and daughter's grinning faces!

Derrière's aside, and there was plenty of it, the food and the service were actually not bad. Our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our needs.

I had the All American Burger, that this monstrosity of a sandwich could've fed all of us. It seemed as if the quoted weight of this burger was post cooking, because It definitely was too big to hold with one hand - let alone put any part of it in my mouth.

My wife had the Ribeye, and she indicated that it was well seasoned, and properly prepared.

The rest had various sandwiches, BBQ Beans, and Mac & Cheese. Everything tasted good.

This seemingly humorous departure from our normal dining venues proved both fun, relaxing and surprisingly satisfying. And by the time we were ready to leave, the lights were dimmed and the crowds started to roll in. Apparently, after a certain time, there is a band that plays on the stage, and country dancing ensues.

We didn't stick around for that, but we left satisfied!",a85qPvr6L63PF0v9Zs8ZAg,18,18,4,HkceAXaKVs2B8Pr094Lraw

At the 90 minute mark we were finally seated.

We got our drinks pretty quick then it took another 15 minutes for our server (Lisa) to take our order.

In all we had two cheese burgers, one chili burger, two waters, one iced tea and a lemon drop martini. The bill came to $60.00. My chili burger had zero flavor. Which begs to ask ""how do you screw up a chili burger""? Well this place knows how.

Come here pretty much every time I visit Vegas and stay at Harrah's cause I like the proximity and the atmosphere. Best thing about this bar is the menu: Southern Food.

The menu is varied but I get the same thing almost everytime, a fried bologna sandwich, or as I like to call it: Welfare steak. a big ole slice of bologna with fried onions and cheese on toasted bread. Comes with either fries or tater salad. Where I come from, we put mustard in the tater salad but Tobey don't so I'm not crazy about it. It's ok, just not great.

The wife likes to order side dishes like fried okra, pickles, mac n cheese balls, and meatloaf. This time, along with a couple of sides, she ordered the Chicken n Dumplings soup. First time she ordered this and wasn't crazy about it. She said it didn't have enough dumplings in it.

I have no idea why she ordered this. She makes the best chicken n dumplings I ever tasted which is why I never order any anywhere.

Ok, usual complaint but not really complaining. The price is a little high but remember, this is Vegas 2016. You're not paying $3.99 for prime rib like back in the Rat Pack days. Any other city I would never pay $13 bucks for a bologna sandwich but you're here so don't complain and enjoy.

(Come to think about it, where else you going to get a fried bologna sandwich other than Dollywood?)

We purchased cocktails and within 10 minutes they turned off the music and turned the lights on to begin closing. 
We asked if they were closing early, explained we thought they were staying open until 2a, and the bartender stated, and I quote ""That's what you get for looking at the website! Ya, we're closing. Business is slow so we're done."" 
All of this was communicated in the most condescending voice/communication that we did not expect from this establishment.
We mentioned our frustration with their communication - none of this aggression and condescending tones were necessary. 
This was followed up with a bartender/bar back yelling across the bar 'If you have a problem with me, get back here and take it up with me'. 
The aggression and complete lack of customer service was over the top and completely unnecessary. 
We would have happily come back the next night, this being our first visit, until your staff aggressively taunted our party and rudely pushed all of their customers out of the door.

She stated they are cooked in butter and garlic - so I was in. When the dinner arrived my steak was cooked as ordered but had no taste to it. I don't think they seasoned it at all.

On the minus side, the food is for suckers. It's overpriced, although a Total Rewards card knocks off a dollar or two, and it's not that good.

 I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. 

It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.

We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.

Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.

The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.

Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.

Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, ""Happy Birthday"". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.

If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here.",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,25,7,1,sQILaK3aB3YXC_a5343T8A

Our waitress Michelle was stunning. My family is ridiculous, so we had a discussion on whether or not her tits were real. I watch a ton of porn and my mother has fake boobs... we both voted real. My dad didn't care, he just wanted to stare at them.

However, I was super dissapointed when I came to Vegas 2 weeks ago--7/27/13. I didn't want to make a review without speaking to the manager on duty about the situation (hoping something would be done about it. It wasn't.)

My party of 3 came here on Saturday night around 10 o'clock to eat. We were promptly told our wait was going to be around 10-15 minutes. Around the 20 minutes wait mark we noticed some tables available yet we weren't seated. I went up to the hostess and she said that they were waiting for tables to be bussed and clean. I dont get it. I could see in plain view 2 tables available. an extra 5 minutes passed and we were finally seated. At this point I was just glad to be at a table and I quickly got over the prior hiccup. My cousin and I decided to order our drinks and food as soon as our waitress came by (2 waters and a lemonade. Nothing difficult. Plus 2 bbq salads. No brainer.) My other cousin had run to the bathroom and we told her she could put in the orders in right way. No need to wait.

Kelly, greeted us and took our order. 20 minutes passed and we didn't even get our drinks. This particular night at TK's was steady NOT busy. Not a moment after she took our order my other cousin reappeared and we told him our situation. He was quite surprised that we hadn't received our drinks yet (he works at a resturant and informed us that there shouldn't be any reason why it should take that long. 7 minutes at the very least to get our drinks and a total of 20 minutes to get our meals.) We finally got our order after 15 minutes. So, we waited 35 minutes total for 2 salads. :-/

At this point I was quite upset at the service that was given to us. I managed to track down one of the girls (our waitress was MIA) and asked her to send the manager to our table. The manager emerged from a back room which I could only assume was a banquent/party room. I told him our situation and he seemed to understand me or, so I thought. He told us he was going to get our waitress and NEVER came to our table to check up on us. Wow, the longer we stayed the more I hated being there. We didn't feel like we were taken care of at all. 

Kelly managed to shortly appear after we talked to the manager and told us that she had a mix up with a drink order with a larger party. It isn't difficult to take a drink order. You go around the table from person to person. She didn't apologize for the wait. Maybe because she assumed the problem wasn't her fault???!?! Nevertheless, we asked for our check so we wouldn't have to wait for it later. We honestly couldnt wait to get out of there to at which we decided to give our business to Gilley's at Treasure Island. 

SIDENOTE: We weren't expecting TK's to comp a meal if the manager and or Kelly took better care of us. We would have been fine paying for what we ordered. However, I won't be dining here next time I'm in town. 

-----

I do however give credit where credit is due and we were at TK's the night before this night and we had a good time, AT THE BAR. The boys were great and we got our drinks in a timely manner. It may not have been as steady as Saturday but even with the visits we had here prior I have always had a good time at the BAR. So, do yourselves a favor if you dine here. Sit at the bar and order from the bartenders! They seem like they know what they're doing!",h2djDoeg6M4sVQmaq7IGxw,4,1,2,nAaHI8bSma4j-i1Vnrn_Vw

We had the sampler platter and meatloaf. My friend that got the meatloaf didn't like it (said it was dry and cold) but the sampler platters were great. Ribs, pulled pork sliders, wings, and sausage. A meatatarian (patent pending) dream, the American way. 

Midway through out meal a band came on stage ND started playing covers of hit country songs. To my surprise they were quite good! They even did a cool blend (I'm a real DJ so I don't call things ""mashups"" like pop society, and am kind of mad at Glee for starting the wrong use of this term) of margaritaville to sweet child of mine back to margaritaville again that actually worked well. 

We actually stayed about an hour longer than we planned because the music was good. 

The decor is outstanding. The entry doors are garage doors completely with garage door openers. Giant guitars overhead. America everywhere you look. The menu has lots of country references too. For instance the burgers come with a side order and one of the options is ""freedom fries"". Haha. 'Murica!

Not loud but not quiet at all.  Seats are widely spaced apart so your not sharing food with your neighbor.  

Started with the fried mac and cheese balls.  $10 for 4 balls.  They were lightly beer battered and not too greasy.  Came quickly in about 7 minutes after ordering the app and our dinner. Absolutely delicious.  I almost wanted to cancel the dinner and order some more. Recommended. 

Next came dinner.  I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries. Good but not over the top.  I was in the mood for good so it worked for me. The waitress asked me if I was ok with the coleslaw.  I was , but glad she asked.   The coleslaw added a crisp bite to the chunky pork lathered in the slightly tangy sauce.  It was a nice medley to compliment the soft chewy bun. 

My girlfriend got the old West cheeseburger and she says 10/10.   The bun was buttery and soft and the party cooked to perfection. (Well done).  Not my choice of doneness but whatever works is what works.   We finished everything so that must mean we liked it.

We were staying in Treasure Island so it was basically across and up the street for a 10 minute walk to Harrah's (somewhere upstairs).  It was a Tuesday night and we had about a 15-20 minute wait to get seated so we hung out at the bar.

The service was also pretty good though the dinner entrees took a while to get served.  The appetizers were decent enough - wings, nachos (w/grilled chicken, guacomole, sour cream, tomatoes, etc.) and shrimp hush puppies.  The disappointments were the dinner entrees.  Not one of the five of us were thrilled with the dinner entrees.  The flat iron steak was sort of tough and not very tasty, the rotisserie chicken was dry, the grilled ny steak was sort of bland, the meatloaf was also somewhat cold and bland and the beer battered shrimp was more batter than shrimp.

You're going to have to be a fan of country music to enjoy yourself here. A large screen playing music videos and some smaller ones all around with both tunes and NASCAR, will be the background noise to your dining experieince.  Loves it!  I first saw one of these places while driving through Nashville and have been wanting to eat here ever since!

The girls working are in chaps and the eye candy was excellent! Our server was Rhonda and she did a fantastic job. Totally on top of it and delivered great service through the whole meal. I ordered a house salad ($11.99) and when it arrived I could tell it would feed me another meal or two, so I asked for a to-go container before dressing it. She brought me one (which I filled with salad) and even brought me a lid for the extra dressing. They must get this a lot! The two cups of dressing were huge!

My husband had some sort of big club sandwich that he enjoyed ($15.99). We both had a drink and enjoyed the large mason jars - you don't have to check on a table as often because it takes longer to empty a drink (not sure why some places use such small glasses). With our check, Rhonda brought to-go cups as well and made sure our glasses were full.  When you're paying $3.50 for each glass this makes you feel a little better about it.  That's expensive beveraging!! Service was superior to most places of similar value. And it wasn't just her, we saw lots of hard-working employees and bussers. Everyone doing their job well and providing a pleasant dining atmosphere. 

Sign up for a player's card! Your Total Rewards card from Flamingo works in the Harrah's Hotel where this Grill is.

I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews. This place is a dump.  

To begin with, I tried to call the restaurant several times during the week after noon and no one answered.  Finally, they answered.  I just wanted to see if there were any happy hour specials. Geez...

I met up with some girls to start up the evening for a bachelorette party on a Saturday evening.  Not everyone showed up at the same time, so the hostess would not seat us until the entire party was there. (We had 10 girls in our party.)  They also have a sign that says that there is a 90 minute maximum at your table.  Oh yea....they don't take reservations either.  Not to mention 2 of the hostesses were rude and I had to pull answers out of them.  Already not having a great experience, because there is NO level of customer service in this place.  

The drinks are expensive....$7 for a corona light.  Yes, it's the strip but at Harrah's that seems a bit crazy.  Maybe I should have splurged for the $22 mason jar, but I was the DD and didn't want to get crazy.  Every so often, they blow a whistle or something and someone jumps on the bar to pour some shots into your mouth.  

Once we sat down, I asked the server if my sister and I could split our bill out.  She made sure to tell us they only split checks a max of 3 ways.  OK what is with this place...can't I catch a break?!  All in all...she ended up splitting the check 4 ways....funny how that worked out.  

The service was OK and the food was not so great.  Typical strip food....over priced and under delivered.  We only had bar type food...nacho plates, club sandwich and I shared an app platter. The best thing was the fried mac n cheese balls. Not super great but good.

Later that evening about 3 hours after I ate....I had food poisening. Yes, like Linda Blaire!  I am sure it was the chicken wings.  I will be contacting Harrah's and the health department.  I didn't drink so it wasn't that.

Table service is a pain point for this place. Every time I've visited, it seems they were shorthand on wait staff. Be prepared to wait if you go there and want table service. I now go to the bar when I visit. The service I've received from the Bartenders is excellent, be it for food or drinks.

The Atmosphere.
Good layout, lots of TVs and seating. Audio on sporting events is muted in favor of country music. This was kinda annoying, being it was hockey and basketball playoff season. I then came to grips, realizing this place has Toby's name on the door and country music is king here.

I'll go back if I stay at Harrahs, as its really convenient and you can usually grab a seat at the bar.",lp93LENF9bGgdK-RoogYIQ,3,0,3,vPDIysuxuK_iz1Q1pzt4fA

So if you've followed me here on Yelp, you will have noticed that I have been to Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo and Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. Today, January 20, 2017 I let my wife decide when we went for lunch. It was time our little lunch adventures had [A Woman's Touch].She decided we should go to this one place inside Harrah's casino. Now, we don't exactly live in the [Trailerhood] but we traveled from Northwest Las Vegas, down to the Strip and finally placed a check mark here. When we got to Harrah's it felt like we have to walk [Upstairs Downtown] and all around the casino, but we made it. When we got there, I thought to myself, ""That's  The Next Thing On [My List].

So when we walked in, I didn't see a  [Humingbird] I didn't even hear a staff member say [Who's That Man?] Guess I am not that famous yet. But I did notice the female staff wearing chaps and bikini-like shorts. No, I didn't say [Who's You Daddy?] but I did wonder if this place would be appropriate for children.

We were seated immediately. We looked around talking about the décor and all the television screens, my wife never had a chance to say [I Wanna Talk About Me.] Instead our waitress came by asking us what we would like to drink. My wife is not a [Whisky Girl] instead she ordered an iced tea. I ordered a soda. Our drinks were not served in a [Red Solo Cup] but instead they were served in large mason jars, which I liked.

When reading the menu, it's pretty basic. You won't need a degree from [Honkytonk U] to understand it. It's basically barbecue, hamburgers and that sort of thing.  My wife ordered what was called [American Soldier] Burger
100% all-beef grilled burger topped with your choice of cheddar, swiss, american or pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. The wife chose American cheese. 

I did not order [Beer For My Horses] and I had no need to [Get Drunk And Be Somebody.] What I did order was ""Old West"" Burger
100% all-beef grilled burger topped with cheddar cheese and crisp bacon then smothered in Toby's barbecue sauce topped with beer-battered onion rings.  This is my kind of hamburger, it almost had me [Dream Walkin'] After eating this hamburger I wanted to say [I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying.] But instead I told my wife I liked my hamburger, I asked how she liked her's and she said, [Me Too].

The French fries we were served were my favorite part. When you go here, make sure you [Getcha Some].  Maybe I [Should've Been A Cowboy] but alas I am a father with two daughters, and I think my daughters would like this place for lunch. But, [It's A Little Too Late], due to the outfits worn, and the restaurant not having a kid's menu, that fifth star, well... [He Ain't Worth Missing.]

As I finish this review, the food here is better than the previously mentioned places. The price, is good for tourists. But I must ask one question...

The food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren't bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't catch the price.

The waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little ""sloppy"".  I hate saying that, but if you're going to put your staff in sexy outfits, I'd make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.

Overall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very 'touristy'.  I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances.

Now let me say this;  We went there two times during our most recent trip to Vegas, and both times we ran into problems with the staff.  The first trip we were a party of four.  There were several empty tables but we were told it was a 20 minute wait.  I said ""really?  But there are many empty tables"": to which the hostess replied quite nastily: ""that's right"" and then walked away without taking our name for the list.  As we were ready to walk out she came back, took our names and 15 minutes later we were seated.  We waited 10 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 for her to take our dinner order.  The food was ok, not great not bad.  Now, three days later I went down to get a bowl a soup because I was not feeling well.  I was seated right away, but again waited 10 minutes for a waitress; let me say there were only two other people in the restaurant.

Toby's is located on the second floor the Harrah's hotel.  Next door to the restaurant is the Toby Keith's gift shop.

It has a great cowboy/country decor, and the staff are all very friendly.  The waitress all wear very skimpy attire.

The menu selection is large, with a good variety of food.

I ordered the Fajitas.  I thought the portion size was small based on the cost.  The chicken did taste very good.  The rice and beans came in a little plastic cup and the portion was extremely small.  The drinks come in mason jars and cost around $20 each (no you don't get to keep the glass).  a little pricey.

It's a loud environment, and gets very loud when the band starts playing.  There is a dance floor and a lot of people were up dancing.

This is a great restaurant to drink and listen to great music, but I think the food takes a back seat to the live entertainment and bar.

the reason for the 3 stars was the lack of vegan options.

me a ""to go"" fee that is half the cost of the food item I ordered. Hmm. Just doesn't make sense.

+ Band on stage
+ Dim tasteful bar feel with some lighting (just incase beer goggle's not enough *nudge nudge*)

Chicks in chaps && boy shorts? Don't worry boys, you won't be needing beer goggles in that department ;]

Jessica's the BEST. My entire table pretty much all ordered the free meal deal and 2 appetizers.

On a recent visit to Las Vegas, my wife and I visited Toby Keith's Restaurant, and again it was very good. The drinks and variety of beers is very good. Every time we go to the restaurant we try something new, like the delicious chicken spicy wings, or the Fried Bologna sandwich, or the Fried Twinkies for dessert.. This visit we tried the Meat Loaf with Gravy, Baked Beans and a Baked Potato with Bacon. It was Awesome, it made me feel like I was back home ! My wife had the Country Fried Chicken Steak with Gravy, with saluted vegetables and mashed potatoes, which she said was also very yummy ! They always have great music playing in the restaurant and have live entertainment at times. They also have a wide variety of Toby Kieth memorabilia to see and enjoy also. Give it try on your next visit to Las Vegas, and bring your ""Red Solo Cup"".

I don't know how great it is for a bar, we usually just go for lunch and the place never seems too busy.  I like that it's just off the parking garage so we don't have to push and shove our way through a crowded smoky casino to get there.  

The first time we went I ordered a steak, but what they don't tell you on the menu is that it comes smothered in mushrooms.  I'm deathly allergic and had to send it back to have it re-done.  It would have been nice to know ahead of time.  However, the waitress let me keep my sides so at least I got to eat some of my meal with my party.  

My favorite thing on the menu is the mac and cheese, and my husband has a sweet tooth for the deep fried twinkies.  I've ordered something different every time I've gone and other than the death steak it has all been really good.  When they have been busy, we have even recieved a free appetizer.

I've read some people bitching that they got a plastic cup instead of the advertised mason jar.  Big deal, the place sells the mason jars and they do get busy.  God forbid they sell drinks faster than the dishwasher can do dishes.  Over all this is a fun place to eat that has good food and fair service, but I would not recomend it if you hate country music.",cBSYFg0yZ7ua5Fl_xcsfNQ,0,0,4,DVU8CIEd13wzxxIxpjSxnQ

Hey, maybe I'm just not the crowd this place is looking for. I thought I would be, because I'm a HUGE country music fan, and even admit to a grudging appreciation of/liking for Toby Keith's music. Which is good, because you can't look around the bar without seeing a zillion pictures of the guy. So if you disagree with his right-wing views and occasionally racist song lyrics, this probably isn't the place for you.

HOWEVER, if you like paying $8 for an aluminum bottle of Bud Light, this is definitely the place for you. I'd question your intelligence, because cheaper (or free) beer is readily available in Las Vegas, but hey. If you like artery-hardening fried food that claims to be ""Southern"" by virtue of its being fried, this is definitely the place for you.** And most importantly, if you like your meal to be interrupted at random intervals by ear-piercing whistles, music volume suddenly cranked to 11, and sadly unattractive (and fully clothed, but maybe that's a relief) male bartenders dancing and cavorting on the bar, well then, this is DEFINITELY the place for you. Have at it.

I had the bbq chicken sandwich & still to this morning I am still trying to figure out where my bbq sauce was on this chicken.  Chicken was very fatty & the fries sucked.  I do have to say the very large mason jars filled with tea was the only best thing about my experience.

Huge mason jars of water or soda, I saw a table nearby with nachos. I had asked the waiter if it was a half or full order, and he said half. It was HUGE! And it was only $8! I was set on that, and a friend also ordered their fried mac and cheese balls. Was excited to try it!

The fried mac and cheese ball was dissapointing. Flavorless, even with their spicy ranch sauce.

When our entrees came out, they were HUGE! No one could finish their food! My nachos were really good, was quite surprised, and we could barely put a dent in it. Their french fries, although could be cooked a little longer, were really tasty as well.

We went there because my husband's best friend had Navy friends in town.  They said they liked the food...didn't see what they had.  
Service is okay...They were busy and don't have very many people working at the bar.  You're going to have to wait to get a drink if it's at all busy in there.  Drink prices are pretty typical for a Strip eatery/bar.

Ordered the chicken tenders and fried mac and cheese and they were both decent, but I had ordered the mac and cheese last year at the pool and thought it was supposed to come with a cheese sauce, and it didn't, it came with a ranch sauce instead, no biggie. 

Got a house whiskey and club soda, which was like $11.25 (ridiculous) and a Blue Moon for like $8.

After checking in that evening we put our bags away and headed down to the bar to get a late dinner. We were very excited to be in Vegas and were looking forward to our week stay there. That evening my husband and i split a meal. We were not very hungry and wanted to call it a early night since we had worked that day.
The next morning my husband had diarrhea and was not feeling well. We decided to go down to the pool anyways and see if he would feel better. When I got into the pool my stomach started cramping. We decided to go back up to the room since my husband started to get sick and we were not even drinking at all. For 16 hours straight, I had diarrhea and was throwing up at the same time. We both were sick and had to share the bathroom. Plus there was no fan.This was the worst I have ever felt. I could keep nothing down and had constant diarrhea. My husband did start feeling better after a few days but I was sick the entire time. At that point we knew we had food poisoning. We split a burger and both ended up sick the first night there, that kind of speaks for itself. 
We did do a incident report and let the hotel and business know. The manager told me I had probably been out in the sun and was not used to the heat. Funny how we didn't even get to really see the sun since we got sick the next day. I just think they could have done something to make it right. I am writing this review so others who are thinking about eating there don't make the same mistake we did. I would not want someone else to spend all that money on flights, time off and the room and have their stay ruined by getting food poisoning. They would do nothing to accommodate us.

3 bartenders working and I still stood and waited 12 minutes to order a drink. $10.50 for a house bloody mary?! It was served in a very small plastic cup (not even a red Solo cup!) and the mix came from the gun!

As I waited, I watched the bartenders screw up two orders (gave group A's food to group B and vice versa)... and then proceed to swap everything out after about 2 minutes! Unsanitary! And NO APOLOGY!

The 3 bartenders, all male, had ZERO personalities and attentiveness. One was just a downright asshole...to me, to my friends, to patrons at the bar.

I'm in love with this place. This was my 1st time and I can not wait to come back and try the steak entree. 

I ordered the meatloaf and was more than over joyed with the abundance of flavor and how tender and fresh the entire meal was! It came with your choice of one side, fresh vegies, corn bread, and rolls :) 
They offerer a lighter side menu, which includes a turkey burger that looked to die for,  and came with the most amazing french fries!!! 

The service was the sad part of this experience, the waiter was neglecting our table to say the least. He had a few larger parties he was dealing with at the same time and focused on them a lot. I will not knock a star down because of this one waiter in there restaurant because the rest of the waiters looked on point and were nothing but friendly. 
There is a large bar area, and some room for dancing, large screen tvs for country music videos and plenty of pictures of Toby Keith :) There is also a gift shop located right next door that has a bunch of cleaver take home gifts and reasonable prices.

You only need two or three to get a solid buzz going on. And let me give you a fair warning for you timid types. If it's someones birthday they will be in for a surprise if they don't know what to expect. First a bar tender will stand up and blow a whistle violently then present a drink with whip cream in the shape of a penis or a vagina for the appropriate sex. They will then hold it down by their groin while you chug the whole thing. I have seen multiple people get scared and embarrassed but hey guess what? it's VEGAS! So chug away! the bartenders are the showman type throwing bottles behind their backs and making a hell of a show out of your order.

Oddly, the water is served in Mason jars. Since that's retro chic I was surprised, as there's nothing chic about this place. Some burgers come stabbed with a steak knife to hold them together.  

Another surprise was the hostess lady - she walks around in cowboy chaps which isn't that big a deal, but she only wore a pair of modest black knickers underneath, like a bikini bottom. You can't help but stare! This was probably the oddest addition to this potentially wholesome restaurant - a cheeky bit of Vegas twist I guess. Another bit of the entertainment is the music videos playing on the screens. All country music and probably lots of Toby Keith stuff.

My turkey burger with advocado was ok. It bet it would've tasted better with the fries. I got the potato salad which did seem homemade and not from a plastic box, but who knows what's real in Vegas! :) My waitress said the burger came with fruit, but I didn't see any in my basket. I paid around $15 for the pleasure of this ok/average burger.",WaqPitgrhpepyvFo2jcUBQ,0,0,3,bfBV97qHuI41i78ByrDS4A

4395739,2013-02-05,0,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"Okay first off this review is only for the Superbowl party,  not the normal operations of this bar.  I go to Las Vegas at least twice year, and I go to Toby Keith's every time we are down in Vegas and we never had a bad time there.  Always has good live music playing during the night, even got to see Toby Keith sing one time.

This was the third time we have gone to Toby Keith's for their Superbowl party.  Got in line to get time at around 10am like last year.  Doors opened at noon.  First noticed that they didnt arrange the tables into long rows like they did in the past, but whatever a lot of places leave their restaurant area tables alone during special events.  We took a table in the of the restaurant area because there were five of us in the group.  The screen that we had seemed smaller that what was there last year but that could have been just due to how much further away to it we were.  The buffet was the same as years past, decent nothing to write home about.
Now the reason I am writing this review.  The service was ... hmm, I cannot come up with the best word to describe how bad it was.  As part of the package you get 4 bottles of either Coors Light or Miller Light.   I would have drank way more than that in the coarse of the 6 and half hours we were there.   Between the time we sat down to half-time (about 4 hours) I had 4 beers.  I ordered a beer every time our waitress came by.   Yes I am saying in 4 hours we got checked on 4 times.  This whole time I am watching the tables around us get checked on by their waitresses multiple times and even asked a few to help us for absent waitress.   
A little way into the third quarter our waitress returns to us to tell us that she needs to close out as its the end of her shift.  Okay fine.  Lets hope the next one will check on us more.... not really sure there was ever was anyone else assigned to our table because it wasn't till the fourth quarter I finally complained to a ""manager"" about the lack of service.  He said he would take care of this.  Sweet, a new waitress showed up took our next round.... And we didnt see her again.

4451917,2014-07-27,3,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"What is there to love about Toby Keith's Bar & Grill? Not a whole lot.

My family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's who 1. Doesn't take reservations and 2. Wanted us to wait 2 hours to eat. Ha ha! No thanks Guy. And BTW - no reservations? Come on.

First TK's has a fun atmosphere, but looks like a normal 'ol bar and grill. The walls are decorated with Toby Keith... things, and all the girls wear panties and chaps. Ass in your face every time your server leaves your table. Speaking of service, it could be improved. After we were seated we waited a good 10 minutes to put our order in, luckily, since we all had sufficient time we all knew what we wanted to eat and drink.

Onward to the food - steak fajitas, which came out sizzling and made me excited. But when were placed in front of me were a let down. The beef was haphazardly cut and chunky, not strips. Plus the meat was not seasoned in anyway and it looked just WRONG to me. Fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I picked corn - half of them were not steamed enough and had hard edges. They brought them out in a tortilla holder with NO LID. What the heck? No wonder it did not steam all the way. Dear manager of TK's: put lids on your tortilla holders and customers will get tortillas that are soft! My fajitas also came with: rice (OK), refried beans (OK), salsa (not spicy at all), guac (OK), and sour scream (OK). Overall what could be a great dish, only mediocre.

Next - ""I Love This Bar"" BBQ Sandwich - my mother requested no sides for her sandwich, but they brought her fries anyway. She said the BBQ sandwhich could use more BBQ sauce. 

Chicken Fried Steak - My brother had this and said it was so-so, not a REAL chicken fried steak in my family's opinion because it didn't appear to be pan-fried, which is the honest way to make a chicken fried steak - not deep frying it with a lot of breading. Speaking of breading...

My husband's fish and chips were mostly breading which he peeled off so he could actually eat the fish.

Lastly, the shrimp appetizer which my father ordered for his meal came with a HUGE amount of deep fried little shrimp. There had to have been 20 and it came with a tasty, creamy cajun-flavored dipping sauce. I really liked the shrimp.

Overall - I feel as though there could be a lot of improvement. I like Toby Keith. I like the idea of the restaurant - I really like all the country music they were playing, but the food was a huge downer.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,2,NLhz-NHocWjWj8LDChxRDA

Their drinks though are pretty good.  32oz jars for $18 bucks a pop isn't a bad deal considering you're getting two drinks in one.  After one Whiskey Girl, the wife was trying to be first line when they offered free shots at the bar.

The cover band was actually pretty good on a Saturday night, the only negative was once we started enjoying ourselves after dinner listening to the band next to the dance floor we were told we had to give up our table.

We tried the Fried Pickles (too much batter, the pickle itself was pretty good though), Biscuits and Gravy with Chicken and the Bronco Burger.

The wife said the biscuits and gravy was pretty good, but the oil that the chicken was fried in made it taste just like the pickles which didn't leave a good after taste.

Bronco burger is like a kitchen sink of burgers. Pulled pork, Bacon, Onion Ring + the normal fixings of a burger. It was good, nothing super special but it was a solid burger. The meat itself was very well done which was a bummer, but I ain't gonna complain about that. I must say that they need to change the oil or something because my fries tasted just like my wifes chicken and the fried pickles.

4501517,2013-03-30,1,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"My 2 favorite things about this place are the Buffalo Cheese sticks, and the mason jar alcoholic drinks. The cheese sticks are made with jack and bleu cheese, and I believe when they are breaded, they are dipped in buffalo sauce. They come with either ranch or bleu cheese dressing, and they are a great twist to the traditional mozzarella sticks. 
The mason jars are on the expensive side, avg. $19, but they are big and last a while. They have good burgers, and yummy crispy steak fries, and almost every meal is a little over-sized.  
My biggest gripe is the service, all of the hostess' and waitress' are women, and many of them are snotty. First off, they are walking around with chaps and their asses hanging out, that might be one of the reasons for their uptight attitude, and they can be very rude. The most recent time my husband and I came here with my in-laws, our waitress was horrible. She never cracked a smile, rammed into my purse almost knocking it down (it was hanging on my chair and she didn't apologize or even look back), and she forgot my mother-in-law's drink because, ""oh, uh, someone just handed me back there check and I haven't had a chance to pick up your drink from the bar."" Have someone else run it for you half wit! She's lucky my father-in-law paid, because I would not have left her sour-puss face 1 red cent. Don't like your job? Your ass is cold? Find another one, don't take it out on the customers tipping you=common sense.
If I didn't like those cheese sticks so much, I'd probably never come back. I'll most likely sit at the bar from now on, because the bartender's are usually a little nicer then the last 2 waitress we've had the displeasure of having.",2C35gD-_d4qgN2EkBo7e0w,1,0,2,SYDiavdcYfCyCrQhedGQ9Q
4511674,2015-11-24,7,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"A group of friends and I decided to visit Toby Keith's I Love This bar & Grill for dinner.  We got in without reservations with only a minimal wait at 6:00 on a weeknight in July.  It was a little tricky to find as it was upstairs and around a corner inside of a casino (Harrah's Las Vegas), but after wandering around for a while we finally figured it out.  

The decor is very cutesy country, fitting since the bar's namesake, Toby Keith, is a famous country singer.  The atmosphere alone is worth part of the cost of the meal.  We pushed together a couple of tables and ordered a few drinks.  Now, I should probably warn you, as I WISH someone had warned me, that their drinks are HUGE and come in large mason jars.  Even the adult beverages come in these same jars, and they don't make them weak an watered down, either.  You'll be feeling your liquor by the end of your first one, and I had more than one.  I was drinking one of their signature cocktails called The Patriot. The Patriot consists of Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon, Southern Comfort, dry vermouth, and sour mix with just a splash of sierra mist on top.   Let me tell you, they go down smooth.  I had a sip of my friend's Georgia Peach (vodka, peach schnapps, and sierra mist, and it wasn't too shabby either.

When it came time to order the entree I decided to go with the BBQ'D rotisserie chicken as it looked like one of the healthiest items on the menu.  For about $18 I got a half chicken slow cooked on a rotisserie to a tender and moist perfection and brushed with a generous helping of barbecue sauce.  It came with a choice of two sides; I chose mixed vegetables and a baked potato.  I asked them to put just cheese and bacon on the potato and put the butter and sour cream on the side. Everything was tasty and while I felt stuffed by the end of the meal, at least I didn't feel like I'd clogged my arteries with grease.  One of my friends even mentioned how tasty my plate looked.

Came here for a quick bite to eat before shopping and its in the same hotel we were at (Harrahs). If you have a total rewards card, there are special prices for each menu item and I believe it takes $1 off each item which is great. We just wanted something quick so we ordered the bbq wings and fried pickles. The bbq wings were delicious, they were big wings and smothered in bbq with some extra on the bottom. For $12 though, it was pricey for 8 wings but hey, when in Vegas! The fried pickles were decent but nothing too special. The other items on the menu didn't look too bad but definitely overpriced for most items like ribs and fries even with a discount. 

The customer service was good but she was a bit slow. We waited at the table for 5-7 minutes just to be acknowledged by someone and get some water that tasted like tiolet. Then we had to wave her down to get napkins and later on for the check since she never came to our table. It was not very pleasing to the eye when the girls are a little bit bigger and they are wearing booty shorts that show half their butts. Just saying. Besides that, the food was decent. I'm not a country music fan, but I knew and heard of Toby Keith before. It was funny seeing him everywhere with pictures of himself posing on the walls and basically a shrine to myself throughout the place. Theres also a gift shop next door, probably overpriced also but I didn't get a chance to go in.

Sat at the bar, took 25 minutes before anyone offered us a menu- even though they were all looking at us but kept horsing around & talking with other patrons who were obviously dressed to get a free drink. Once we got a menu (with not being asked what we would like to drink- hello? we are sitting at a BAR..) the bartender came back 15 minutes later to wash a glass and I had to let him know we were ready to order. He asked ""what do you want?"". It then took 20 minutes to get one order of appetizer chicken strips. The man who brought it out to us was very nice and polite and was the one to finally ask if we wanted something to drink. It of course took another 20 minutes after being done eating to get the idiot bartenders attention to ask for our bill. Needless to say- we did not tip.

Other than the creepiness....This  sports bar type place was a welcome surprise.

It DOES get VERY crowded on Thurs-Fri and Sat nights so be warned...But for the most part it is a country themed casual eatery with an upbeat vibe.
The service both at the tables and at the bar was good, even when busy. The waiters are pretty good ad describing some of the more ""eclectic"" items on the menu such as the fired bologna sandwich or the fried macaroni balls. The food was, I would say, a slight improvement on a Chili's or TGI Fridays type Americana type offering. Several fried southern surprises, as mentioned above...But I had both some appetizers, a salad and a burger, and all came as I ordered and were tasty and a good value. A great combination. HOWEVER, they do offer the ""100oz Challenge"" which, as I had heard was a giant burger, fried and beer..All totaling a combined 100 ounces. This is one of those John Canyd type challenges where you get a ""hootn and a hollerin"" reception when you ordered it, and a TShirt and Polaroid if you finish it...And a double bypass in a year or two.

That said - my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our dinner here, and I think it was probably the best meal we had on our recent trip to Vegas, which is sort of sad.    

We went for the fun atmosphere (there is Toby memorabilia everywhere and they play country music videos non-stop, which are about 2/3rds Toby Keith ones), but we were surprised that we actually really enjoyed the food!  We split the chicken fried steak ($16) and had more than enough for 2.  We were planning to order a dessert as well, but ended up being too full.  The steak itself was very tasty, and was served with gravy and excellent mashed potatoes.  The mac and cheese we chose as our side was more mediocre, but it also came with some cornbread, and some bread with sweet honey butter, which was really delicious.  

Service was friendly, if a little confusing (she failed to bring us the cornbread at first, and when we asked for it, she said they didnt have any and that was why it hadn't come out, but then she brought some immediately).  

Definitely one of the better options on the strip for moderately priced, tasty food, and I highly recommend, especially if you're a country fan.",Wxd-EKF2Z4RHZUmwQ6Eeew,1,1,4,vQVlMgUEJHg6QO5KkHKXOw

I am not the biggest Toby Keith fan, but here it wasn't too big of a deal. Sure the walls are lined with images and items from his career, enough that part of our conversation was ""If Toby Keith were to actually come here, would he be super embarrassed by how much this place is a shrine to him or would he own it and purposefully wear an outfit from one of the photos and get the table underneath said photo?""
In all seriousness, the decor was a little overdone. Unlike, say, Margaritaville, which I would say is ""Parrothead- and Jimmy-Buffet's-MUSIC-themed,"" I Love This Bar is simply ""Toby Keith-themed,"" which is a bit off-putting. It's like the cafeteria of the Toby Keith Museum.
The food and service were definitely good. My burger was well-cooked and tasty, and the service was fine. It was a little strange that they took and then tried to sell us a souvenir photo of us at our table.

We stayed at The Cosmopolitan and we walked late the first night so it wasn't terribly hot all the way to Harrah's stopping to watch the cool sidewalk shows and random attractions of people.Then we walked the second  time in the early evening when it was about 107 out all the way to Harrah's again! Ridiculous walk! But worth it. Plus right outside of Harrah's there is a outside bar/club Carnaval I think it was called and they have a booth that makes enormous drinks for about 40$ and we got one of those to keep us company. ;)

Good food, excellent service, great fun atmosphere. At first I was hesitant to go to a country based bar since that's never really been my cup of tea, but to my surprise, I had a great time! On Saturday night there was a live band singing cover songs, they did an excellent job! The woman could really sing! There were people swing dancing and line dancing all over. It was a good time. Our waitress was the little blonde woman, she had so much energy and was the sweetest cutest waitress ever. She rocked the heck out of her butt-less chap outfit with the rhinestone booty shorts! My husband and I ordered a hamburger and a quesadilla and split the two. Food was good. We also got the mason jar of the Georgia Peach. It was good, but a little bit too sweet for me. 

The second night (Sunday night) there was no live band, must be a Saturday only thing. We ordered Toby's Big Daddy Platter. It was delicious. I have never had deep fried macaroni and cheese balls, not sure if I would ever particularly order it but I loved it from there! I got a Ranch House salad (which was huge for the price). Don't remember exactly what my husband ordered but he loved it. We also got the boot souvenir drink cup this time filled with The Patriot I believe. We asked for the least sweet tasting one on the menu and it was delicious. Got to take the boot home back to California.

The food was TERRIBLE. My friend got chicken strips that weren't even cookied and I got this buffalo chicken wrap that was not even edible. Which coming from me NEVER happens especially when I am paying $14 for the item but it literally tasted like Vinegar wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla. The hotsauce and the Guacamole and chicken was just non existent in the flavoring and I literally had to dip the darn thing in Queso just to be able to eat half of it . Which I only did because ...You guessed it.. the thing cost $14. We had initially been downtown and decided to check this place out because they had a veterans day special for a free burger which my boyfriend took advantage of and for being a free burger he was able to eat it but the fact of the matter is. Even Checkers does it better!  I really enjoy Toby Keith's music and I like the atmosphere with the pretty ladies in their backless chaps but we didn't even end up with a hot waitress and the music was so loud that was playing I couldn't even complain to our waitress if I wanted to but I just couldn't even stomach the energy after how bad everything was. I will hopefully be uploading some photos to cement the fact you shouldn't bother with this place but it's me and I am not always that good at attention to detail. This would have to be one of the first places I have not been able to finish my food though. I am the queen of eating pretty much anything but this place failed hardcore.

There were 50 of us and understandably trying to get us all together was hard, they set up 2 long tables side by side for us. Our menu was already picked out for us. We received an appetizer plate with chicken wings, onion rings and jalapeño poppers. I only tried the onion rings which were so good I think they might have been beer battered but not 100% sure. I also tried the chicken wings and when they say chicken wings they mean chicken wings, they are not the little wings you would expect when ordering chicken wings they are the real deal and the buffalo sauce was on the side. Everyone loved the jalapeño poppers that's why I didn't get any. Their sweet tea was a little to sweet for me, I had to order a regular. For my main course I had the chicken salad, my plate was huge full of lettuce cucumbers, carrots, celery and maybe 3-4 small chicken strips on top. Don't get me wrong I thought it was good I just wish there was more chicken. My husband had ribs and my daughter had a steak and their portion was no where near mine. The moment I was waiting for the fried Twinkie! I have been wanting to try one of these for a while now, and I thought it was yummy. The service was great, especially for us being such a big party. One of my brothers food didn't come out with the rest of our and the server went back to fix the problem the manager came over and was talking to my brother and comped a free beer for the wait. I definitely want to go back when I can look at the menu and try whatever I want because the sample I had was great.

5065869,2015-04-19,0,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"The food is awesome.  The service is lacking.  Let me explain.
When your waitress takes your order, and you order appetizers, there is a good chance your main course will arrive with, or even before, your appetizer.  It's not the fault of the waitress, she always asks if we wanted the appetizer first, then the main course.  The problem is the process in which your food is delivered to your table.  Your waitress doesn't deliver, your food is delivered by other staff.  I'm quite sure the waitress and the cooks are on the same page, but the food delivery people don't seem to be in on the communication chain.  
All that said, just order appetizers first, and order your main dish AFTER you receive your appetizer or when you're ready.  
Great tip: Wednesday is .25 cent wing night, and Thursday is $6 steak night.  Great value!",0Qp91Kf6WW_a8krHXVbRGA,0,1,4,9W8T9zoknO0gZv2pLEFshg

The Fried Bologna Sandwich was pretty much the same as the Ruben. All butter soaked Texas Toast and a slab of fried bologna with no flavor. We did not send this back, but only half was eaten.

My best friend and I went on the 4th of July in order to partake in some flag-waving boot-scootin' good times. Instead, we got:

-a 45 minute wait for a table
-a Mom's Apple Cobbler in a plastic cup because the bartender left ice in the martini glass too long and it cracked. Mom's Apple Cobbler, incidentally, is white, creamy, and looks like a bodily fluid manufactured by the half of the population of which I am not a member. Thus, having it be served in a plastic cup made it look like I'd robbed a bank, and not the kind with money
-water in plastic cups, NOT MASON JARS as advertised
-a 30+ minute wait for food after ordering
-soggy fish and chips with no chips
-absent service
-a clientele that summed up my impression of Las Vegas vacationers over the 4th of July: fat, white, and lethargic.

The food is good but nothing special either; but no one should go to sports bars or dance clubs for their food only, so why should TKB be rated just based on their food experience.
Overall it's a very cool kickback place, in particular at the night time when the live music is going. We never have experienced any kind of drama and always end up meeting some very cool people there. I minus a star for their pricy food and the fact that not all bands are always that good.

The food arrived, and my girlfriend and I sat there munching stoically without comment for a few minutes. We were both hungry, and even though I had several comments, I kept them to myself for that initial interval. Finally, she broke down and said ""Any good?""

I replied: ""Well, it tastes like the boot, right after Toby Keith pulled it out of Al Qaeda's ass!"" - and then I illustrated my point by taking a sharp bite with my canines and holding it down for ten seconds, and showing her that I hadn't made a dent in the meat!

Toby, a couple of suggestions for you:
1. Leave the jingoistic songs to someone who does *not* own a restaurant, and concentrate on upgrading your food from ""horrible"" to ""barely passable"" - this will be a huge step forward.
2. If you must involve yourself with patriotic activities, please wrap care packages of your food and drop it off between the Afghan/Pakistan border. After two days, I'm positive they'll surrender. Your menu selections will do more damage than the MOAB.

They do take plastic and the monorail will drop you off pretty close, but I'd recommend going elsewhere, even if you're on your last vestige of strength and absolutely must eat.

5806985,2007-06-23,1,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"What can I say?  I had to check out this place, and try a fried bologna sandwich.  The restaurant's walls are covered with photos and Toby Keith memorabilia.  There are a number of televisions, showing either sports or Toby Keith in concert.  Waitresses are uniformly thin, wear tight leather mini-skirts and short white tops, call everyone ""hon"" and are terminally cheerful.

The food is OK.  The fried bologna sandwich consists of a thick slab of pretty good bologna, lightly fried, with caramelized onions, American cheese, lettuce, and tomato, on Texas garlic bread.  If you like greasy food (like me), it's not bad; if you have a low grease tolerance, stay away!  For dessert, the sweet potato pecan pie with bourbon ice cream was a disappointment.  The combination of the two kinds of pie sounds like a good idea, but neither of the fillings was especially good.  On the other hand, the ice cream was very rich, a big plus.  Cola was served in a large mason jar.  I'm glad I went once, but don't plan to return.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,1,2,U-nZqK8D9pszaD_lq6hYtA

Super overpriced like everything else on the menu, I paid like 14 bucks with tip for a take out order that I wanted to eat in my room because this place is LOUD as shit and definitely for a party crowd. 

Thats all well and good and this place looks awesome as a bar to go check out if you love country music. 

However, its tough to mess up wings and you had better make sure you don't when you charge me $12 for an order. 

Sorry Toby, I know you're not as good as you once were. But I sure hope the rest of your food is better then the wings.",ifaiZxMhmWGy80zs8ohDYg,1,1,2,AL4J_y1HPcug2D_qorNbHQ

5833364,2009-07-11,0,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"Our first night in Vegas we got in late and really had no idea where to eat.  Starving as we walked the strip we found our way into Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill.  The name of this place not withstanding, it didn't seem too bad atmosphere wise.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, and my group of friends all seemed to dig the faux country atmosphere despite being from New Jersey and having no connection to the country at all.   

But yeah, the food, what this review is all about.  Suffice to say I was not impressed.  Looking at the menu I had a slight heart attack.  All the options seemed to be highly unhealthy and likely to send you into a food coma after eating them.  Ok, I understand that this isn't Trader Joe's and can deal with that if the food is good.  I decided to pick what I figured to be the healthiest thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar wrap.  The rest of my group got Fried Bologna sandwiches and one pasta with Alfredo sauce.  

My Chicken Caesar wrap for lack of a better word, sucked.  The wrap had very little chicken, and was mostly packed with lettuce (no tomato or onions).  This may have been somewhat tolerable if the chicken and lettuce weren't drenched in a watery slop they call Caesar dressing.  When I eat a wrap, I don't want it to leak.  I was really disappointed and so disgusted by the dressing I barely ate it (and I'm not a remotely picky eater).  Everyone else liked their dishes ok, but nobody polished off their plate or was really impressed.  

If you come to this place skip the food- go to Capriotti's earlier in the day and buy a sub to save for dinner.  You'll save time, money, and yourself from a subpar meal.",ojNleteE0BAkI2szo9RoIA,0,0,2,CRkCdg0tfDS8x-cinwDF2A
5833894,2013-01-11,5,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"I hate this Bar.

Cold food right out of the frozen box, then thawed. Gawd awful. 2 (supposed to be fried and hot but served cold) sandwiches, 2 well drinks; $60. Crap quality.

We counted 7 customers total in the place, all sitting near each other, 2 bartenders, full staff on the floor, zero service,, no excuse.

Couldn't get a cocktail re-fill, damn near couldn't get a cocktail to begin with.
Staff never checked how the food was,, couldn't get their attention. Took a long time to get served after we finally got up and walked around and flagged an employee.
Place was empty mind ya,, horrible attitude.

One bartender hacking, wheezing, sniffing, sneezing and blowing his nose with his fingers, then washing the snot off in the glass wash basin,, handling most everyone's else's food and drinks. No employee gave a damn what they were doing. Inhuman.

Filthy bar and dining room. Garbage everywhere.
No comp drinks for video poker. Poker machine quit working and when we finally got an employees attention it was ""Ahhhhh I dunno what to do"",, and we got no help at all.

Expensive and tourist shitty.
Toby Keiths is as bad as it gets in 'Vegas.

4 & 5 star reviews are no doubt from employees, vendors, investors, band members and management.",BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q,6,1,1,_esCylpTbo2RP1OqY8EhEg
5838036,2015-07-15,4,VUtazCTIc0aoOrQprP_s-Q,"Well, it was Restaurant Week again, and I finally experienced Toby Keith's vaunted World Famous Fried Bologna Sandwich, with a really thick slab of fried bologna joined with American Cheese and Miracle Whip on grilled Texas Toast.  It was so slippery that the slice of bologna inside one sandwich half slid right out when I tried to raise it to my lips, flew in the air, and skidded to a stop on the floor at my feet.  My waitress graciously got the chef to provide a quick replacement half at no additional charge, along with another long pickle spear.

Speaking of pickles, greasy and juicy battered Fried Pickles were a great appetizer dipped in refreshing pink Ranch Dressing.  Red, white and blue tortilla chips with a tasty mild salsa were good but cold.  Regardless of color, the chips tasted the same.  Visible egg and crunchy celery enhanced a side of potato salad which had a pleasurable tang.  

A half-pound ""American Soldier"" Burger with Cheddar Cheese with Freedom Fries was made perfectly medium rare as ordered.  And a warm Southern Fried Twinkie, accompanied by whole strawberry pieces and sweet whipped cream, was a toothsome treat--much better than an unfried Twinkie.  Service by our scantily clad cowgirl was excellent, and all beverages were served in unconventional mason jar-like containers.

Immediately was served a pour of a fruity mixed drink by one of the bartenders roaming around the top of the bar. 

Then my friends proceeded to get me drunk by ordering a shot of vodka, which was HALF of one of those plastic cups. Literally, was enough for me.

It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day.

From the succulent rib/ wing combo to the sweet peach cocktail, I had a wonderful dinner experience here with a group of 12. Our server was unbelievably friendly, and was patient as we took time to altogether decide what we wanted. Drinks and food came out promptly, and everything just amazed me.

My rib/ wing combo consisted of two flavors of each meat, and both meats were just beautifully tender and flavorful. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. The mashed potato side was also wonderful, and the fries put me over the moon. 
Meanwhile, mixed drinks came in 32-oz. mason jars. My Georgia peach one was great--not too sweet, not too strong, a perfect mix that lasted each of us a long while.

We go to this bar, and it was a bit early (barwise) I guess (10:45?  11?) and it was just crowded enough.  There was some line-dancing, some country songs, some non-country songs, a live cover band which had a BEAUTIFUL lead singer... and then a Toby Keith impersonator and a Willie Nelson impersonator.  Though we may have been unsober enough to be rather certain for some period of time that they were REALLY Toby Keith and Willie Nelson.  

So I definitely had a pretty fantastic time.  There were a few moments with sketchy men, which might be one reason I'm not throwing 5 stars out.  They also don't have a bathroom in the restaurant, so you have to go back into Harrah's, and they wouldn't stamp my hand when I left to go (we got there before the hand stamping started) so it was possible if it got crowded I couldn't get back in (luckily I did, but the uncertainty didn't make me happy).  Also, 6 dollars for a Bud Light makes me a sad panda, even though I know it's Vegas.  I don't even know why I ordered a Bud Light- I don't even LIKE Bud Light.  

However, the drinks were totally served in mason jars when I was there, and a bartender poured shots down people's throats for free at some point.  That was pretty fun.  The crowd was also REALLY into the music, which added a lot.  However, there could have been more single cowboys (for my friend, of course...).",4w5Yh-CbJrUQi6-zrUFxEg,2,1,4,r7dPEnoM3iVvao6XqN0gEg

I added extra BBQ and it worked. The coleslaw and potato salad were just ok; the kind you'd get locally at the deli. 

The waitresses either wore tight cutoffs or chaps with no pants. They had one underwear/bathing suit material on the bottoms, and obvious people tend to like that. Overall not a bad place but sort of loud as they played Keith's music the entire time.
