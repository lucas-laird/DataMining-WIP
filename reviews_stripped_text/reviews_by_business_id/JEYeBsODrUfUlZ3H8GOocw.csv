She ordered the steak and I ordered the mixed plate(steak and chicken). All I got though was the chicken though. And this chicken had to have been thawed then frozen again to be put on a skillet from that frozen state. It's only was I could explain the dry rubberness of the chicken. Also, the cheese cake I was served was completely frozen. 

I used to love this place. It was like a hidden gem. But I don't know if I'll be going back.",sZhTucu80bZ3mAdNfD6kDg,0,0,2,4Er_OCOXI8WXkejzLC49ew

We ordered the Oysters prepared with shrimp ceviche,  The shrimp cocktail, and the Shrimp empanadas. Everything tasted great. The drinks looked cute and the plating looked up to date. With all the food and 2 drinks we paid $44.",yVUVIA1Zd9DN40CnorwxOA,0,0,4,UDVfhLuAGmI31_VEaLKfgw

This place has been about 5 different mexican restaurants of the 7 years we have lived in this area and not have lasted more than 1 year so we are hopping this one will be a success and stay around for a while.
When you walk in nothing has really changed from the previous attempts of a mexican restaurant.  Decor is old and stale and it just has no feel of a Mexican or seafood restaurant.
When we arrived they were moving all the tables and booths around in preparation for a large birthday party later that night.  We were quickly brought some great chips and salsa. The chips were light and crisp and the salsa was great!  A good start.  The menu has items from all of Latin America and grouped by country.  They have a ton of pics on there Facebook page of all the foods.  Ignacio, loving papusas ordered 2 chicharron and I ordred the costa azul which is bacon wrapped shrimp.  The papusas came out with the fixins of slaw and sauce.  While decent he said they were not as good as what he normally gets at true salvadorian restaurant.  My plate of bacon wrapped shrimp looked great but the rice was very bland and the beans had no flavor.  The shrimps was served over fries and the fries had soaked up the grease from the shrimp making them very soggy. My first bite into the shrimp yielded raw uncooked bacon leading me to believe that while looking cooked on the outside the bacon was raw inside.  The waitress apologized and quickly took the plate to the back.
She brought back the plate which the shrimp cooked longer but still a second bite and raw bacon.  I took of the bacon and it was a whole slice of bacon, no wonder it never cooked on the inside.  I am sorry but I do not like raw bacon.  Nearly every mexican restaurant in town serves this dish and I have never had this problem.  The owner / manager can to the table and said sorry and took the item off the bill.  Also if they are going to appeal to the american crowd they need some english speaking servers. They do serve beer here and we did not know that until a customer asked for one.  They would do well to offer a happy hour daily. I see they offer a BOGO 50% on Thursdays.
We are going to give them the benefit of the doubt and try Las Brisas again as they have some good looking food pics on Facebook.  Lets hope the second time around wins us over as for this place to survive it is all about the FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,3,AaQxyL1dxRrbha2YVrSGsw
