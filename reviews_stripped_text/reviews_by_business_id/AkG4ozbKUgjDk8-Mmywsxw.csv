My Hawaiian sliders were well done and very tasty (but waited a long time as waitress told me my mini sliders took longer to cook than my friends' tacos and chicken fried steak).

However, I have to say the food is getting downright sloppy. You have a slim chance of getting them to make anything a certain way.

be cleared, but its to be expected when its busy.  We have been sitting in Erin's section recently and she is on point.  She is sweet, personable and always willing to do whatever she can to make the experience great.  I can't believe the crap that people write on here just to complain when they don't take the whole situation into consideration.  If a table is leaving as you are walking in, the table will NOT be cleared yet.  If there is even the slightest problem with your food, they WILL correct the situation.  IF you have these issues and they aren't dealt with in a timely manner, you obviously haven't sat in Erin's or Cyndi's section.

First breakfast. The hash browns were just weird and didn't taste anything like normal hash browns, but the rest of the breakfast items were very good (including the egg dishes and french toast) and came in large portions. Unfortunately, if you want to change out fries for the hash browns there is an additional charge.

Lunch and Dinner. The burgers and sandwiches are excellent, as are the wings and side salads. Stay away from the chili, as that is really bad.

The food is a bit pricey, but we will continue to go there but only for the burgers, sandwiches, and wings, since we need a good place for those on this side of town.",jXGO-W5XY_lFj0qH_JhyRQ,0,0,3,_oCyeKIsAXUR9VDrPBKawA

Well got their oh! no sitting at bar unless you are playing the slots card over the machines, not a good thing to have,.   I could just imagine what would happen if I sat at the bar.  Second I sat at a big table only me and waited 20 mint. to get a waitress to come over her excuse I didn't see you well when you're a waitress   stay off your cell phones and look around,   their should be no cells phone when at work unless you are on a break their is plenty to do, second I informed her I was really up set and she needed to tell the manager , he never came over to talk to me.   I have been a waitress for many years and I could have run circles around them.  I will try  to go again and I will set at the bar and we will see what happens.  First and far most  you do not know me I could be from the head office, you do not know how much money I have and you do not know how much I will tip you.    Get it together on the cold slaw it is terrible use different bun to big for the burger and use different grease in your fryers it is terrible.  Cutting cost can in some ways but it is bad for business. From what I can see your night manager is only think about the food cost, if you get it together  you food cost will go down.  Change the salsa, it has to go  I wouldn't feed it to any of my friends,  
Bring back good salsa, bring back good food and you will see the difference Chicken fried steak is not chicken I know every one knows what it is but change it to country steak for get your steaks they are terrible. Put cheese Girts on the menu When that order goes in make sure it comes out fast, I know you have a great cook on the late shift, so the day and evening shift, need to get it together.
Away say hello to who even comes in the door and let them know you will be right with them,   never walk by a table  when someone is sitting their always  ask them if they are ready to order.  Night girls and Night Manager need to get it together.  I am hoping that this letter will improve you're you rest.",bNiPgxR9QkzVBOEnNgKIXQ,0,0,3,Gb2nb4GyaW5sFN8Ozg6jVg

I will make sure my friends do not return as there was the smell of prejudice radiating from behind the bar..
Our waitress was sweet attentive and efficient and knowledable and very very very apologetic for her managers shortcomings and understood the reason why two of us did not even place an order for food or drink.

As always you can expect a shout out Welcome from behind the bar when you walk in and
a thanks for coming when you leave and the staff is always great and friendly although I do think they have a high turnover on the waitress side. So, This review and the rating is solely based on 1 of the 3 food items we had and I really think Timers needs to fix this issue.
We ordered 2 - 15 piece wings and onion rings - the wings were decent size however the onion rings were way over cooked and on the super crispy side. I ordered based on the description on the menu the crispy chicken sandwich which was described as a JUMBO fried chicken breast.  When you see the word jumbo you would think the breast would at least have been as big as the bun if really not bigger than the bun.  This chicken breast was a true disappointment.
It filled maybe have the bun and I have had bigger pieces of chicken on a slider that what was on this bun.  I did complain to the waitress that I was very upset and did not get much of a response except I'm sorry.  You can see by the picture I took what this so called jumbo chicken looked like.
