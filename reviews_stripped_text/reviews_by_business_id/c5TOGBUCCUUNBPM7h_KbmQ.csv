First of, I was ready to place my order but the she-man cashier was busy chatting with a friend. I waited patiently but after 10 minutes I asked if I could order she looked irritated that i interrupted their conversation. When I ordered the carne asada burrito she told me if I was sure because it'll take 10-15 minutes to make. I told her yes and she gave me this irritated look. So I was waiting for my food which took forever the to go bag had blood stains on it. I notified her and she said oh no that's just a red marker. A red marker? Are you kidding me? So I asked her if I could get a different bag again she gave me this angry look. The food was horrible. The meat was cold and hard. The rice was dry and the beans were very watery.

The cashier who was the manager also repeated our order back to us. We quickly noticed we didn't get a Nevada burrito and calmly told the manager that and asked for the right one. The manager quickly got angry saying that we order a carne asada burrito. We told him we did not and the manager called us insane and crazy. He was putting up a big fight with us. Arguing that we order a carne asada burrito. At the end of the conversation he called us ""shitty"" customers. We were so disgusted by this man we wanted our money back immediately. The manager REFUSED to give back our money. I  noticed a video camera on top of the cashier and asked him if his video recording had audio so we can prove to him that what we asked if was we ordered for. He said yes, but only the owner has access to it. I quickly called the other locations to talk to the owner and I told him the whole story. The owner told us if we can put the manager on the phone, but he refused to talk to us. So the owner called the store and talked to the manager. I hope this manager gets fired honestly. You do not call your customers shitty and crazy. After his phone call with the owner he quickly made the right burrito we order, even though I asked for my money. They're service was so disgusting it made their food disgusting also. We decided to leave after receiving the burrito because we were tired of all this bull sh*t.

And was I surprised how good the food was,

It's hard finding a real Mexican authentic food place in Vegas however this place does not disappoint

The prices may be a little more expensive then other places however your still getting your money's worth,

We had a breakfast burrito came with eggs and potatoes, it was really good,

We had the carne asada fries, the fries were a tad undercooked not much to complain about due to the taste of the meat and toppings guacamole and sour cream with cheese was amazing on the fries

The carne asada burrito was also very good the meat was fresh and tasted great

I probably used to be one of their most regular customers for a while. I was going there sometimes multiple times per week, and would always get the steak breakfast burrito. It was delicious.
I was always polite when I went there, but for whatever reason, the transgender person who sometimes worked the register seemed to not like me. The last time I went there, he and the rest of the staff were laughing when he handed me my burrito to go. I knew something was up. When I got home, I opened the burrito to check it out, and found several long hairs that were obviously intentionally placed inside the burrito. My first thought was that they were pubic hairs, but they might have been hairs from his head, I'm not sure. I was so disgusted I really couldn't even think about it at the time. I immediately threw it in the trash. They're lucky I didn't call a lawyer, because I definitely could have sued them for this. If I can let others know about it, that's enough for me.
Like I said, I should have written about this when it happened, but better late than never I guess, and I felt the need to get it off of my chest. It was probably the most disgusted I've ever been in my entire life. Obviously I haven't been back since. It made me wonder if they had done anything to my food in the past before that. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Side note: The guy who worked the register when the transgender person wasn't there was always really cool and friendly, and I'm sure would have never done anything like this.

I've been coming to Fausto's for a over a year now and they come though without fail when it comes to my late night cravings. The menu offers a wide variety of delicious authentic Mexican food. The portions come out pretty big and extremely inexpensive--always a plus!

I usually come for their Nevada burrito or the carne asada fries. Usually, I would call the place for a pick-up order and have them get started on it. They are super fast and will have it ready for you in 10-15 minutes. Super fast!

The only reason why I gave them 3 stars is because I'm big on customer service. Their staff seem to be in a rush at times and not as personable--especially when I'm ordering on the phone, but that's just me.

1341340,2018-04-14,0,c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ,Stunned this place has 4 stars. Seems my last review was racially insensitive so Yelp headquarters reached out to me and explained how they had to remove it. So here it is again a more refined version. The kid behind the register charged me twice for the same order. I called to explain but due to the language barrier that stems from are more darker pigmented neighbors to the south it was difficult to communicate. This prompted me to drive over and show them on my banking App that I was charged $12.85 twice in the same min. Maybe our neighbors to the south are not familiar with banking or something??? When I had proof in my hand they argued with me said I was wrong and offered me nothing. The darker skinned femle even dug through the trash can looking for a receipt from the night before why? No idea!  Wtf is that going to do? So I left frustrated. When I returned home I had a text message saying they were in the wrong to come back they would refund my cash. They must of got my number off the caller ID . The way I see it they can keep the whole 12.85 well worth it to be able to keep putting reviews up about this place. Avoid this place at all times.

even when my parents came into town, they were hungry after the Neon Museum and out of allllllll the fresh yummies I had at my house...no one wanted to cook :)

I always order a vegetarian burrito no cheese no sour cream and my mom went with me to order. She asked to have whole beans and not refried (why did not think of this?!?!?) so whole pintos we got :) 

The veggie has rice, beans, guac, fresh yummy pico, lettuce and is always their HUGE size. It also has sour cream and cheese, but I leave those off.

I can not get enough of their spicy carrots and radish. That pickled yummy madness I could just take the whole container secretly out the door with me.

Hubby tried my veggie burrito once and said is was better than his chicken lol, so now I order him a veggie with just a little chicken :)

not to mention how yummy their green and red sauce is...you can dip out for yourself

I would love to try other things.....like the rolled tacos with guac on top.....or the carne estada.....

1412188,2013-08-25,2,c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ,"One thing that disappoints me about Las Vegas, is the lack of REALLY GOOD hole in the wall Mexican places.  It seems that all of the mexican that comes up on my yelp search is always robertos, don tortacos or taco bell.  Really disappointing.  I've also been to the Bonito Michoacan and I'm not super impressed.  I used to live in California, so I just miss those really good, line-out-the-door mexican spots where there's a huge language barrier but the most amazing food ever! 

I have been wanting to try Fausto's for quite some time.  I keep watching the yelp reviews because everyone seems to be a fan, but I wasn't convinced that this place that resembles a robertos could be that great.  I think it's the way the menu looks or something, but it was a difficult one for me to actually give a shot.  

I got a supreme chicken burrito.  It was awesome.  The only thing I didn't like about it, was how it was served for dine in.  I prefer to cut open my burritos and eat them with a fork and knife but the little dish they gave me to eat off of was too small for the burrito and it would have been half sitting on the table.  LOL.  

Their salsa bar is very similar to that of Robertos.  It was comforting that while I was there a ton of mexican families came through and ordered + seemed to be regulars of the place.

So when he arrived in town and wanted to grab some grub off the strip, I thought this particular FMG would do.  Having dined at every FSG in Hendo, and having given 4 & 5 stars at everyone of them, I thought again...the particular FSG would do.

After picking up my buddy at Aria it was a quick trip down 7800 block of Rainbow.  Frindly service.  Dos carne asada burritos ordered with everything on them and dos quesadillas...dos drinks.  The service was friendly enough.

MY buddy went to the head and I stood by to pick up the order which came out in quick order.  This was great given...we were the only ones in the place.

I rolled to our table and grabbed my meal and set up my buddies.  Little did I know I was playing carne asada roulette.  I have never..in any other location had a piece of grizzle in ANY of my burritos until this particular evening.  I am happy I stepped on the piece of fat land mine instead of my buddy looking for a quality burrito.  The burrito gods were in his favor.  It could have been an embarrassing experience for me given just how much I was talking up the joint.

Having spit out the nastiness in my napkin, I looked up to see a huge smile on my buddies face.  He was satisfied and the rest of the meal helped bridge the gap of time.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,8,4,3,dQuG4LC2Je0DKFbwlF9dhg

Got the Vegas Burrito- which is what other spots call a California Burrito, with protein, guac, sour cream, cheese, and French fries. Confusingly, they also have a CA burrito listed, but it's with rice instead of fries, which sounds like a standard burrito to me.

This location is nearby which is convenient. It's a quaint little joint much like the other Mexican grills and eateries around town. The service is quick and friendly and the food is always good. Their portions are SOMETIMES inconsistent but that's never stopped me from returning. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, Fausto's never disappoints. 

If you're not too sure of what to get, my top choices consist of the following:

Carnitas Plate

California Burrito (Stuffed Fries) - The main reason I'm reviewing this place. Carne Asada burrito packed with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and French fries. Simple but easily the best. 

Breakfast Burritos - Solid choice any time of the day. Bacon, Ham, Chorizo, and Steak options. 

Fish Tacos - Not the best, but they'll do! A cut of fried fish with the usual toppings. 

And of course, the Carne Asada Fries!

Also, be sure to take full advantage of their salsa bar! Limes, pickled jalapeños/carrots, and 3 types of sauces to perfectly pair with your meal. Happy Eats!",EW5Og_701TjmUAe696EJMQ,1,0,4,__hetkd8dC2uqhkdx2makw

The grilled asada tastes really fresh & there are no beans in this particular burrito which is A-OK with me.  I don't mind the beans, but faustos does an excellent job puttin the right amount  of ingredients to compliment and not overwhelm the burrito.  

I've also had the carne asada fries which is plenty for maybe 2-3 ppl. 

I had takeout-  so I didn't actually eat here, but when I went to pick up my food it was still fresh and warm.  It's a small place that has about maybe 6-8 booths good for 4 ppl.

I thought the rice and beans would win me over but it did not, again nothing texturally and flavorly special about it.

My baseline for a good Mexican restaurant is STILL Moreno's from Chandler, Arizona. They don't have a lot on their menu but the ones they have are authentically good.

 I went with the rolled chicken taquitos special that comes with beans/rice and a drink. My husband went with the chicken chimichanga, he wanted shredded beef but we were informed that they pre-make their beef with onions in it, so ordering without the onions was not possible, oh wells, the majority of Mexican establishments do that so we were not surprised. We ended up paying around $14 for both our meals so it's pretty cheap to eat here, they do charge $0.35 if you want to use a debit card, so if you're cheap and want to save a few cents, bring cash. 

Everything was great, beans are rice were surprisingly good! My chicken taquitos were a bit on the soggy side, but that's because we drove back home to eat, they were topped with guacamole and shredded cheese.

This place is okay. It is probably very much on par with Don Tortaco, but a little pricier for some reason. 

We each ordered our favorites. 

- breakfast burrito, just cheese, potatoes, and eggs

- carne asada nachos

The portion sizes were healthy, as expected. However, the scrambled eggs in the breakfast burrito were a bit runny. It was also pretty greasy. I know this may sound like a rediculous complaint given the nature of what I'm talking about, but CVE manages to do it without all the grease. This definitely took away from the overall taste, in my opinion.

The carne asada nachos was also pretty freakin' massive! The meat was cooked well and tasty. 

All that said, it still wasn't as good as Chili Verde, which is now the measuring stick for these type of places, as far as I'm concerned.

It wasn't bad. It was okay. But at the prices they charge, I can grab Don Tortaco for about the same quality and less money. If I had my choice though, I would just stick with Chili Verde Express as the best of the bunch!

Fausto's is similar to Roberto's or Don Tortaco, just so you know what to expect. I was craving carne asada friend, but for some reason want them in a burrito. Coincidentally, Fausto's has the Nevada Burrito which is EXACTLY THAT! Carne asada, french fries, cheese, and sour cream all wrapped in a tortilla. 

The Nevada Burrito is good, although I think a couple modifications would make it great. Next time I go, I'll ask them to go easy on the sour cream, for extra cheese, and for the french fries to be extra crispy; I feel that the texture of hot, crispy French fries would elevate this burrito to a new level.

Overall, Fausto's is a great place to satisfy your midnight munchies. I'd rate the food at about 3.5 stars, but I'm giving an additional half-star for the staff being so fun and upbeat! Give it a try for yourself!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,0,4,lv8PBsP1xYGKp2vggaCFdQ

After ordering my CARNE asada fries I went to the back to get my drink and I heard the cook yell out my order. So I went to the front grabbed my order and went home. I had to run a couple of errands (sadly) right after ordering my food so I wasn't able to eat it until an hour and a half after, and to my surprise they charged me $9.50 for just FRIES! I was extremely upset, so I decided to call their store and ask them why they didn't make me CARNE asada fries.

-Grilled Chicken Burrito:  Pretty good size, but lacked some taste.  The burrito was way too neat.  When you have a carne asada or chicken burrito, you expect a messy situation.  This also means that you are killing it like a mad man.  If it isn't all over the place, it doesn't belong to your face.  Scary when chicken doesn't taste like chicken. 

-Taquitos (Rolled Tacos):  I was disappointed.  Taste like cardboard and believe me, I've eaten cardboard before.  Dry as heck.  

The layout of this restaurant is a bit odd.  Small counter and located towards the front.  If you sit near the back, you may not even know your food is ready.  Ours sat there for awhile until another customer brought it to our attention.  

I'm still searching for a good FF Mexican Restaurant in Vegas and I'm not talking El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell.  For now, Roberto's by my house will just have to do.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,3,1,2,0CdXpYh2smUokKm5QJXj1g

This location has only a picture menu with no prices (except the breakfast options). A lot of their items are drenched in (not-so-melted) shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or guacamole, so you've been warned. I simply order my meal without one or all of these toppings and I'm satisfied.

I've only been here a handful of times, but the experience has been consistent. I normally order Carne Asada Fries or Nachos and/or Carne Asada Tacos. I don't normally deviate from these items, but I have had the Breakfast Burrito and Tamales. Everything has been tasty.

Ruben ordered the Chicken Quesadilla Combination Plate ($6.35) that was packed with three very large slices of quesadilla, refried beans, and Mexican rice.

5016500,2016-01-29,1,c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ,"So this morning, I was craving a breakfast burrito. Not the kind that you get for 99 cents in a drive through. A real man's breakfast burrito packed with enough meat and potatoes and eggs to help me survive for three days without eating anything else. Fausto's is one of the best breakfast burritos in town. 

For some reason, Roberto's has never made a breakfast burrito worth my time. Their potatoes and onions are consistently undercooked. Sometimes, the cheese might be melted. But Faustos knows how to cook up a decent burrito every time. 

So... You know that moment when you walk in the door ready for the glory of your favorite plate on the menu. You have butterflies of excitement and you can almost taste the marriage of bacon and potatoes and cheese and salsa verde dripping from an enormous tortilla shell. And then..... Everything is derailed by a hunch to get something new. In this case... Chilaquiles. 

I had a chilaquiles in San Francisco at the farmers market at Embarcadeiro that was insanely delicious. Crispy and fresh Tortilla chips, spicy green chili salsa, and a liberal toss of Cotija. Fausto's delivered a soggy wreck of limp chips smothered with a run of the mill green sauce. Doused with sour cream. I'm a little tired of Mexican restaurants obliging the American pallet with sour cream. It's alright but with a heavy hand, it can ruin a dish. This chilaquiles was not very good.

So as I sit here lamenting my choice, I am hearing the sounds of intelligent people roll in and order breakfast burros one after another. And their Friday is going to be great. So far, my day feels pretty ordinary. But next time I will use my brain and get what I came here for and leave a happy happy man. 

Since this place is seeming a one trick pony to me, I'm rating Fausto's 3 stars. With Los Tacos, Taco y Taco and Tacos el Gordo, I don't need to worry about finding a good lunch spot for Mexican. But I'll keep Fausto's in the Rolodex for the occasional breakfast burrito. But chilaquiles... Never more.",pgDM0E9HCId1X_i3jwUylw,0,0,3,8OG1EwLcg8Rq4usnVWLPFg

I ordered the chicken burrito complete meal which includes beans and rice.  It was ok but the biggest minus is that they didn't flavor the chicken meat which is unbelievable!  No wonder they need the sauce bar to give some flavor.",tw1YfWwGJffPlUNTl_w1fw,3,3,3,qqgxOshvwlAHZ79GEi6N9g

5156019,2017-05-02,0,c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ,Came here because chile verde had a ridiculous wait. I had carne asada fries which was super bland. The carrots and even the salsa had no flavor! Everything is pre-made and they just heat it up. My fries were ready literally a minute after I ordered. My friend had tacos and the tortillas were cold and stale. Totally did not satisfy our Mexican craving. Do yourself a favor and just go to don tortaco or robertos....even better go to chile verde! The cucumbers were good! The staff was very nice also!,6yD8DrSkVCI-u8u5MzLCgA,0,0,2,vZBqog2fa5CEZvPPvCZMvw

They have better refried beans than the other two and they offer a little more on the menu. Now i don't recommend breakfast burritos here which are one of my faves but I do recommend the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, carne asada nachos",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,1,1,4,p2J70_pKKv0k020-B6MMcw

The cashier was friendly and gave me a few suggestions on some of their popular items since I can be indecisive. I ended up ordering the Carne Asada enchilada with rice and beans and OMG..the meat was made in the best way I've ever had it.

After perusing Yelp photos I settle on the Chicken Chimichanga and we were gonna share a Carne Asada Nacho. Doug just got a Carne Asada burrito.
Holy hell the nacho size was enormous, we hardly put a dent in them, but they were good. The star was the Chicken Chimi, so good! Believe the reviews. The chicken was moist, kind of wet with a tomatoey juice, with lots of cheese, peppers, tomatoes and onions inside of a perfectly fried tortilla that was not greasy. I will totally get it again and urged my husband to as well.
The food is super cheap for the amount you get. Service is fast and friendly.

I ordered the Tuesday special Chicken burrito, and my gf had the Nevada burrito
they both taste great, I think we both love the Nevada burrito more, steak and fries in a burrito, what a great combo!
My chicken burrito was great for it was only $3
I love how they have daily specials for weekdays, it's just awesome when you are trying to save some bucks and still get the great taste and portion

the only downside why I didn't give it a 5-star is due to the kitchen size, the food may take awhile when it gets busy. And I noticed that's why many people call ahead to place the order before they go pick it up

this place is definitely going to be our favorite taco/burrito joint now",8xZLVGMzgIgAMIQeJZNuog,0,0,4,_9g9TW4hOcEkiGBn6ZjTtQ
5738825,2017-12-16,0,c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ,"Unfortunately, I have to post an updated review for this Fausto's. The original was five stars, but this location has gone downhill the past year or so. 

The first thing is that they used to have three delicious salsas that I used for every meal. They were great. However, those are no more. 

Now there are only two salsas that are both pretty bad. Tonight they were so runny I couldn't even get any to stay on my chips. Sad!

To make this issue more pressing, the entrees seem to have lost all flavor and I have no delectable salsa to mask that fact. I had enchiladas and a taco and both were incredibly bland. 

This used to be a place I'd bring friends from out of town to try and now I think I may have just made my last visit. 

I just hope management reads this and fixes things because I saw other reviewers stating the same thing.",c-2ycXb0gddd-d6UGGxgNQ,0,0,2,N9DdY0jzsxbSeXT2Dl-3pw

They arrived barely Luke warm.  The cheese enchiladas were pretty cheese less, very little filling.  We didn't care for the refried beans on the tostada or the combo plate.  We found them to be very ""lardy"" tasting.  Nothing special about the chili relleno, either.  I doubt if we will be back anytime soon.

First things first, as compared to other taco shops (robertos, amigos), this place is CLEAN. It's well maintained, and bright on the inside, so it gives your digestive system some peace of mind. 

Prices are a tad bit cheaper than that of other taco shops, so I went a little crazy and ordered an excessive quantity of food. I had the lengua, carne asada, and fish tacos, along with a sausage breakfast burrito. The standout quality within these were the quality of ingredients, fresh veggies and good, high grade quality lean meat. I especially liked the fish taco as it came served with tartar sauce and a tangy pico de gallo salsa. Breakfast burrito was above average. 

Overall, faustos will be my taco fixation for the moment, it's a small place located in a strip mall with highly rated yelp restarunts such as Oyshi sushi but don't be afraid to check this place out.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,6,2,4,qvkxuOcYTTInS8dOAd6uYA
