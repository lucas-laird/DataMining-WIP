1020922,2010-12-20,0,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"Dragon House used to be called Zen Gourmet.  Dragon House still serves chinese food, but the best part about this place is the Seafood Hot Pot buffet.  Seafood Hot Pot is $18.99, but since this place is having its grand opening, they have a special price of $15.00 for seafood hot pot. This place has fresh Dungeness crab, clams, mussels, beef, chicken, coagulated blood pudding, and excellent vegetables ready for you to cook.  There is also a wide variety of sauces for dipping your food into.  

Inside is not the best looking, as it still looks a little old with the orange paint inside.  I took away a star because service was a little slow. There was only one waitress serving the entire restaurant with tea, water, clearing plates, etc.  

Overall, I will be back as their dungeness crab for hot pot is the best deal.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,4,1,4,YS5kmn8tVHyP9cSrIFvKdA

2068041,2011-11-14,0,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"I've only been here twice for the all you can eat seafood hot pot buffet last year and both times I loved it. It's great on a cold windy night when you're craving something hot and soupy. The variety is great. Lots of seafood and meats to choose from, plenty of veggies, and a whole lotta dipping sauces to choose from. What made this place even better was the price for the buffet. It's too bad they got rid of it I wish they would bring it back.",QKHm5bsOcd8Dl7f_8vOzug,0,0,4,i-cJS9A0sOm9Td8900bexA
2488306,2011-12-05,0,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"I had hoped to find some good chinese food at a good price and did my yelp research.

We needed to stay off of the strip as it was closed down for a marathon last sunday night.  Reviews led me to Dragon House.  We meet two people there and it was disconcerting that at 4-5:30pm we were the only customers the whole time.  But that did make the service good and the food hot.

The egg rolls as an appetizer and the hot sour soup were both quite tasty.  I had read of the pork chop with salt and pepper and we ordered that along with Szechuan shrimp and a whole duck.  Some very simple brown rice came with it.

I can't say that the duck or pork chop was anything to remember or reorder.  Two people at our table were put off by the serving of the duck head on the plate.

So overall, the place was clean, the service attentive and the food served hot.  I doubt I will want to go back and will instead try other places in search of good Chinese food in Las Vegas.  Suggestions accepted.",Du9u6dXgWYubbnZuor1KqQ,0,0,3,QEl0477M22nYspTBZ3qh4w
2798936,2011-11-06,1,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"This place gets good reviews, but based on my one experience getting take-out I doubt I'd come back. We opted for two classic American-Chinese dishes -- mongolian beef and cashew chicken. Each dish was a ridiculously large serving, probably enough for two or three people. Too bad the quality wasn't on par with the quantity. The mongolian beef was mushy and chewy. The cashew chicken way too bland.

I'm sure the food would be better if you eat IN the restaurant, but the next time I need an American-Chinese fix I'll be heading elsewhere.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2,1,2,reK5uexf-wZr7-dbbjwyzw

3483222,2011-11-23,1,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"Had a wonderful dinner tonight at Dragon House.  We ordered their AYCE fondue (hot pot) and it was delicious.  Now, you have to order the items that you want to eat/cook and they bring out the plates for you to cook yourself.  They use to have everything out for you to pick yourself, but I found that when they bring out the items from the kitchen to the table, the ingredients are much more fresher.  The sliced beef, lamb and oysters are to die for.  Wow, it was so fresh and the oysters were huge.  We ordered a wide selection of items including shrimp, scallops, and wonton.  Everything was excellent. The service was very attentive.  What more can I say, 5 stars all the way this time.  The orange colour wall paper doesn't bother me anymore.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,1,1,5,3QgqEJuIPBl57D-DpO7T6g
3641652,2011-04-07,0,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,They got rid of the all you can eat seafood hot pot buffet!  We were looking forward to eating the hot pot and walked away so disappointed.  I guess they were losing money on it but they should have increased the price a little.  Some hot pot restaurants have the ingredients in individual plates that are displayed in a refrigerator where you can just grab what you want and you get charged by the color of the plate.  Now the restaurant has a list that you can check off what you want but it's difficult if you don't know the exact name of the vegetable you want.  I hope they go back to the AYCE seafood hot pot buffet . . . please!,jvVsbyQG7vHm_Vxx4CuBGw,0,0,3,2urw3Z-1H1mT0LD0CL-pAQ

5199015,2011-07-15,4,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"Flavorful, generous and affordable equals a place worth a repeat visit in my Chinese book! I hadn't visited previously because I thought it was a hot pot place, and I am not a fan of hot pot. However, the menu is large, and while everyone was taking advantage of incredibly affordable crab and lobster in saucy goodness, I went with my standard greens and tofu, green beans to be exact served in an XO Sauce. 

And, yes, I know this is traditionally made with pork, but I tried to communicate that I didn't want any meat, and the waitress replied, ""Only seafood,"" to which I said, ""No, please."" Alas, when the dish arrived, there were teeny shrimp and meat bits, so communication is a minor issue. However, I didn't mind because the service was nice. Plus, it had a delicious flavor. Next time, I will probably try a black bean sauce or just ask for a spicy garlic sauce.

The area feels eerily abandoned. However, the bright coat of orange paint inside makes you feel a bit more upbeat about the situation. I actually liked the kitschy vibe quite a bit.

While I didn't try it, I can definitely say that my companions seemed very happy with their lobsters and crabs in ginger-scallion and other terrific sauces. Definitely a place worth adding to your ""need-to-try"" Chinese.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,11,7,4,1IwTrtGZ_dyQkaUcjwjZWA
5361272,2011-06-23,2,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"**Summary**
       - Value - The price is on par with other Chinese restaurants, but the portion size is larger. They also don't try to fill the entree's with filler and jip you out of the good stuff. They also offered me a $5 coupon of a $20 meal when i came in.
       - Decor - The place doesn't look the greatest. The outside looks a little shady. The inside feels like you're actually in China (That's not a good thing). I only stayed because I was already there, but I'm definitely coming back because of the surprisingly good food.
       - AYCE Hot Pot - They ceased the buffet for the summer and might bring it back in the fall. The hot pot (Cook your own food in boiling water. Like shabu-shabu or fondue) can be ordered a-la-carte and shouldn't be confused with what they call hot pot on the main menu, which is actually clay pot (Entree served inside a clay pot).
**Ordered**
       - $10.95 House Special Hot Pot - The portion size is definitely a leg up on other Chinese restaurants. The flavor was great and they didn't try to fill the pot with mushrooms and Chinese cabbage like other places. Nope, it's all seafood. The tofu was also fried which is a lot more tasty compared to not fried. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w?select=pjiw6Weqh5RdXS_m20xR6g)
       - $7.95 Singapore Style Vermicelli - So so, and pretty spicy.
       - $3.95 Won Ton Noodle in Soup - 5-6 won tons, noodles, and kai-lan (Chinese broccoli) in soup. Each won ton had a pretty big size shrimp in the middle. Definitely worth the price.
       - $16.95 Small Lobster with Yee Mein (Flag Egg Noodles) - You have a variety of sauces to cook it with. We went with the traditional ginger and green onion sauce. The flavor of the lobster covers the noodles and makes the noodles that much more delicious. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w?select=5tpwBlyAuZoi40lk7c3I4g)
       - $8.95 Diced Beef with Black Pepper Sauce - One of my favorite Cantonese dishes. The beef was tender and the portion was generous.
       - $9.95 Half Roast Duck - Duck was a little dry. I didn't see hanging ducks anywhere so I think they might buy their duck elsewhere and serve it.
       - $9.95 Squid with Salt and Pepper - The oil they used to fry this seems a bit old, but the flavor and seasoning was very yummy. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w?select=XM_NmCcL6I-V2vg4_3YVZg).
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap quality Chinese restaurant and don't mind the surroundings.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,6,1,4,TcRdZvUrU7l25fjw5D2ipg
5529215,2012-01-07,3,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"New management has come in and the menu choices have been cutdown a lot.  No more crab or lobster offered but they'll do it if you ask.  They say it's the same chef as before but I have my doubts after getting chicken fried rice where the chicken appeared almost deep fried and breaded.  That would be awesome Chinese fried rice for a redneck in the middle of the deep south!!  Not sure what liquid the lo mein was drowning in either but it wasn't what I wanted at all.    

In a nutshell, this place has gone all Red Shrimp Company to cater to the Chimerican palate except Red Shrimp does it better.  I can't say I'll be back.  So disappointing!!!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,5,2,2,US1Bmt87jcejpvKkBQ2z4Q
5837407,2011-10-08,1,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"After my very first UYE held here months ago, I said I would return, and I finally did. This time there were a few lows as well as highs, but the food was spot on five-star quality most of the meal--or feast--again. 

I knew that my party of four would be ordering lots, and when we entered the restaurant with its nicely redecorated walls, only one couple was there, so I asked for a lazy Susan table. I'm sure the likely proprietor who graciously assented to this request did not regret letting us occupy a table for 8, because by the end of our repast smokin' dishes were being added next to dinner plates because the lazy Susan was already full of entrees. 

We all shared Fried Dumplings with Potsticker Sauce, Hoisin Sauce, and Chili Oil; an order of Egg Rolls with Sweet & Sour Sauce and Hot Mustard that was not very spicy; House Special Wonton Soup; Shrimp with Walnut & Mayonnaise Sauce; Orange Peel Chicken; Sweet & Sour Shrimp; Stir Fried Vegetables; Mongolian Beef; Steamed White Rice; and specially requested Shrimp with Ham Fried Rice. Whew!! I washed the food down with a good and hot Chinese tea and a Sprite. At first I was a little disappointed that the Sprite came in a can, but when I found out it only cost $1, it was all fine. Plus, a glass of ice and a straw were automatically served with soft drinks. 

We ordered so much food that I had to chase down our server to add my entree orders of Mongolian Beef and Shrimp with Ham Fried Rice. My wife thought she was convinced that we already had enough food coming--and we probably did. But I like variety, and wanted to make the best of this dinner outing. There was also a language barrier problem to a degree. Initially I had said that I would wait after all others in my group and fill in dishes around what they had ordered. But this may have been taken to mean that I was just deferring to the others' choices. When I asked the young man who brought the appetizers to our table for Hoisin Sauce, he could not understand me, and brought out our server, who seemed like she owned the place, and understood and promptly fulfilled my request. 

But the lady tried to do too much herself. Eventually three Shabu-Shabu pots on portable burners were boiling, with cooking patrons demanding ever more ingredients; tables of diners had grown to five parties, plus a steady stream of take-out orders; and the poor woman was becoming frazzled as we were seemingly forgotten and unattended for a time, with empty soup bowls and plates piling up on our table. And, initially, air conditioning currents raging on a rainy day were wreaking havoc with the temperature of food on our plates until the pulsing ventilation nearby was turned off at our request. 

Once again, a big hit for me was the House Special Wonton Soup, which was more like Wor Wonton Soup, as chock-full as it was with meats, vegetables, and lovely wontons floating in the tasty chicken broth that were each filled with a whole large shrimp AND ball of pork. The Orange Peel Chicken and Sweet & Sour Shrimp were both sweet and slightly spicy; the Shrimp with Walnut & Mayonnaise Sauce sweet and very tasty; Mongolian Beef quite lean and made with both white and green onions; and the Stir Fried Vegetables contained a nice mix of Napa Cabbage, broccoli crowns and stems; bean sprouts, and carrots. The fried rice was enjoyable, with big shrimps, moist rice, and the added flavor of ham; the chunks of ham appeared to be brown in color rather than red, which was a bit of a surprise to me. Soy sauce was on our table but I never saw a need to use it even once! The only minor disappointments for me were a too thin Potsticker Sauce and a weak Sweet & Sour Sauce. I liked the crunchy all-vegetable Egg Rolls, and the Potstickers were basically okay. 

What was a real shock though was a foul-tasting fortune cookie at meal's end. It was not stale but had a really vile taste to it that lingered in the mouth to the degree that immediately after our departure, one of our party bought welcome mints for all of us at the market next door. What really counted the most though was the food, and Dragon House's chef knows his craft, for it was by and large excellent and delicious. But the service we experienced was just too discombobulated to earn anything higher than a 4-star rating on this particular dining expedition.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,1,3,4,xbcWHuaOKBqJb0OjJlcSXQ
5918536,2012-01-19,0,nbTwuhnXEyQRzPIAfGNS8w,"Been putting off updating this review since my last visit in mid December 2011, when I learned that the old Dragon House is no more.  Sure the name is still the same, but operating under a different management, with a more concise/abridged menu options and possibly the chef is new too.

Anyway, I was in the area after watching one of the NFL games, and decided to drop in for dinner.  The place still looks the same, but the staff are all different and the menu I was given was different too.  I asked and the young lady/cashier confirmed that the restaurant has recently changed owners.

The new menu now is pretty much a cookie cutter generic American Chinese restaurant menu, at least for now.  I hope.  Gone are the crab, lobster, calamari, and fish that were on the old menu, which was one of the main reasons for dropping in for a seafood feast at the Dragon House.  What you get now are your typical chicken, beef, pork Chinese take-out menu, with the only seafood option being shrimp and 1 fish (probably frozen cod or tilapia) entree.

The food I ordered and ate was prepared quickly and properly, nothing really wrong with it, except it just lacked that certain pizazz I have come to appreciate in the former Dragon House.  I will still come back and give it another try if I happen to be in the area, but in its present generic Chinese take-out incarnation, there is really no point in driving out of the way for its offering.

Decor: 3/5 It is still a hole in the wall, with little or no new facelift since the new management change.

Service: 3/5 The lady that was the cashier spoke perfect English and was proficient in her job, but the new waiter still seems a little lost.

Food:  2/5  It is still made by a Chinese chef, but the menu took out that extra BAM! when it got zapped with a de-evolution ray.

Price/Value: 3/5  Generic pricing for generic American Chinese take-out food.  No longer the great value it used to be.

Location: 2/5  Not in the best part of town, and definitely not in the best lot in that part of town.  Without the yummy Chinese food at a terrific price, I am not sure if it is worth it to venture out of your way here.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,0,2,aS6LV21EeMKW3Kvwf3H-YQ
