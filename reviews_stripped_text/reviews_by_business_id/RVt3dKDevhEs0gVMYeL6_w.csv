The food here is genuine and terrific.  The broth for the gumbo is so delicious and the flavors of the seafood and chicken really come through.  Everyone loves the bread pudding, but also give the pound cake a try.  They give you nice large helpings of everything, and I think I have tried all the items from the menu at this point.

Every time I am in the area I will stop by for some takeout, and I know when I get home I will enjoy all of it and know it will be just as tasty as the last time I had it.  I am a chef and consistency is very important.

Come by and try out this place...you won't be disappointed.",pJqFXVzxfkLAG4G5P74Nyg,3,1,4,0zaAj1S9l_yd4J5MzSvdCQ

I was in the vicinity yesterday so stopped by for lunch.  From what i can tell, they ust opened for the day ( 11:00 am ) - one guy working there and i saw about 5 order tickets he was working on so i was a little worried about how long the order would take.  I went with the seafood gumbo ( large - $7.95) and a shrimp po boy ( either $7 or $8)

It did take a while to get my food but not a big deal - it gave me a chance to look at the other food places in the court ( my first visit ) 

The gumbo was great !  Nice roux base.  I like that the onions and peppers were diced in small pieces.  Really liked that the bones and shells were in the soup - working class gumbo !!  I'm kicking myself for not getting a chunk of cornbread - it would have been the perfect lunch.  

The po' boy was decent.  The shrimp might have been slightly undercooked but i liked the coating and a it was good sized for the price.

So today i just wasnt feeling Wing King or Kaba and Jefe's was closing. So...why not try some Gumbo? This experience really does remind me of the first time i had uni and the first time i had GOOD uni. So here's the story of my experience with Uni. First of all it's sea urchin. Whole sea urchin looks totally alien if you're not used to it. The soft flesh inside looks like what comes out of said alien's ass. 

Now lets turn toward gumbo. First time i had gumbo was i think on the south side messing facility of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni. I've never had gumbo before and it looked interesting with the crab legs and seafood and sausages. yeah...tasted like something that came outta an alien's ass. So every time gumbo was served i would get a small bowl and give it a shot just to be disappointed and it just settled: Gumbo = Crap. 

Back to Uni, recently we found a sushi spot that offered fresh FRESH uni and holy that looks like an alien's ass batman the stuff was absolutely amazing. 

Back to Gumbo, Went on a limb and ordered a seafood in a small size and a bread pudding on the side. first bite...absolutely friggin amazing it's like opening your eyes from being blind for your entire natural life until that one day. I havent had enough gumbo to full explain what i was tasting and how everything was balanced together. This meal totally made my day. 

Bread pudding was quite amazing as well. Not overly sweet as i was expecting but balanced. The pineapple and coconut give a lot of flavor without adding to richness. 

I came hungry and curious and I left one happy smiling ass motherfucker. What more could you ask for?

I usually don't use profanity, but this gumbo? Polite words don't cover how amazing it is.

I took my BF on a foodie roadtrip to Louisiana last summer- the food is amazing, seafood and gumbo and boudin and crawfish, oh my! It's all phenomenal. But when we moved so far away, I gave up hope of having cajun food that good any time soon- but this place came up with a near-perfect score on the Yelp app, and I came within a week of moving to Vegas. From the outside, it's unimpressive and a bit odd- but don't let that stop you. You're here for FOOD, not ambiance.

All I can say is, this gumbo is damn amazing. I ordered a large seafood gumbo to go, got home, and have barely made a dent in the order and am blown away. The portion is huge, and it's chock full of okra, sausage, shrimp, crawfish, and crab- I'm pretty sure there's an ENTIRE crab in my container. I've counted two legs so far, and I'm only halfway through the entire order... Which probably isn't meant for one person, but they'll have to fight me for more than just a taste of this stuff!

On top of the amazing food is amazing service- I believe I was helped by the owner herself, who made a minor mistake running my card manually, and then went above and beyond to fix the issue. Totally unnecessary, but thoroughly appreciated!

Stellar food, spectacular service. Gonna be coming here pretty regularly- gonna have to grab some sweet potato pie next time! Maybe I'll make Sundays my unofficial Louisiana appreciation days- they're open noon to 4PM!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,5,nogGeZnLhAx0Mw72fW6W0g

Two things that really stood out for me and wanting too come back for more. Some reason maybe cause I order the chicken gumbo rather then the seafood gumbo. It feel short of my last experience. I thought it was bit on the salty side. I should have order regular size instead of large. Not that you can never get enough of A good thing in life. I felt with the large between the gumbo and the rice plus everything is so condense or packed in. No way you can enjoy best of both worlds. Or just could have been bitter that should have ordered seafood gumbo. 

Still its good gumbo especially the seafood and even though not fan of the chicken nothing skimpy comes too the andouille sausage, chicken, and get your money worth of gumbo. Not just gumbo everything on the menu is nice size portion!! I also ordered the pound cake since there famous slap yo mama bread pudding was sold out. I was surprise not just fact that nice full piece not thin slice piece. It so moist and delicious!! All the desserts here are made fresh daily just like the rest of the menu.

OMG, I haven't tasted such delicious meaty gumbo for quite some time.  The flavor was bold, there were shrimps, crab meat, crawfish meat, drumstick, sausages...um um um...definitely took me back to Louisiana.

Their gumbo has a rich flavor with just enough of a spice to give it some good taste.  I don't use hot sauce with their gumbo because I want to taste the great gumbo flavor.  The seafood gumbo had a fair amount of seafood and it was a great meal that I brought home.

I've never been to a place that was out of so many things that seem to be a staple to their business/menu -- we're talking out of cornbread, hushpuppies and fries!!  No fries with my po'boy??  Seriously.

The fried okra we had in place of hush puppies was ok - it was a little bland and tasted fried with batter, but needed some ooomph!   My mind (and my belly) were excited about the ice cream and caramel pecans for dessert . . . . but as luck would have it . . . ""we're out of ice cream"".  Really??

The atmosphere lacks, so I thought the food would make up for it.  It's in a food court type setting with 4 or 5 other food eateries and tables in the center for all.  It's just not worth the time.  The owner is pleasant and very friendly - she came by to see if we were ""ok"" a few times.  I guess that's why I gave it 2 stars - I like customer service.

I visited this establishment while in the area for business.  I looked up some reviews and decided to give it a try.

I ordered catfish and red beans w rice.  The fish looked great but was very tough and chewy.   Had a good taste but weird texture.
I did not care for the red beans as they were watery and had little spice.

4484348,2013-03-27,1,RVt3dKDevhEs0gVMYeL6_w,"Whoa mama! I haven't yelped in awhile because frankly nothing has excited me much, until tonight.

I had high expectations after reading other reviews, but those were far exceeded upon first bite. Everything is made from scratch from family recipes, and this is a family that must eat VERY well. I literally got back from N'awlins on Saturday, where I had gumbo at the prestigious Commander's Palace. Weeziana's gumbo smoked their's out of the swamp water. 

I give five stars, however, because everything else was just as good as the gumbo, and the owner/chef couldn't have been more hospitable and lovely. She had cornbread fresh out of the oven that she brought to the table, and it was the best I'd ever had. We also ordered the cornmeal coated corn on the cob, and she comped us some of her delicately fried fish served with a fantastic spicy aioli and Crystal hot sauce. This lady can fry to perfection!

I wanted the bread pudding, but I guess even after 6 weeks the dessert is becoming so popular that she was sold out. I 'settled' for the pound cake. Another item that fit in the category of 'best ever.' 

Don't expect much in terms of the atmosphere, but expect tons in terms of everything else. The food, service, and value make this a MUST in my book. I'm grateful it's only ten minutes from home, but even if it weren't I'd drive distances to go here. 

Despite the filling meal costing less than $20 for two people, I would give Weeziana's five stars even if it cost twice as much (maybe even three times). 

Oh, and her son is super cute, too. He's sweet and happy with just the right amount of shy. He's lucky to have a mama that can cook like she does!",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,8,5,5,wVj5aR1qZVFh-vQQXGop5w

In addition to the gumbo I also had deep fried corn on the cob.. what??? haha yes what a unique spin on a classic favorite! The deep fried catfish with Weeziana sauce was also delicious and had that same sweet breading as the the corn on the cob. For dessert we had their famous ""Slap Yo Mama"" bread pudding.

Needless to say, it was a flavor-party in a Styrofoam cup.  They were not stingy with the meat at all.  The soup was not too watery but not too thick either.  I loved every spoonful.  What was missing though was some okra.  I think it would've made the dish even more complete.  I don't know if it usually comes with it, though.  Maybe they were out?  

I really wanted to try out the Slap Yo' Mama Bread Pudding, but they had sold out : (.  Apparently, Circus Circus bought the whole batch earlier in the day, which is good for business I guess.  I'm still a little bitter about that - well, not really.   When I went, around 2pm, the fryer wasn't up and running yet, so I couldn't try out anything deep fried.  However, besides the lack of choices available that time, my experience here was pretty great.  The owner also stopped by to converse with us as well, so I found that as a nice gesture.

They are still in soft opening mode, trying to gauge the market and streamline their business processes.  She is fixin to do an official grand opening in a couple months.
