Ordered myself - two Breakfast Burrito's & two soda's.............aaaah, breakfast of Champions!!!! All of this for just under $20 bucks. Not bad to airport food........as you know, the prices will be a little higher at the airport due to the convenience factor, and probably the vendor's high rent, & taxes.

If they had cooked the bacon to a crisp, then loaded it in the burrito, I'm sure it would have tasted a little better......but what do you expect for airport food???? 
It's all about convenience folks!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,3,2,3,ztwn-IIJeY5O7oXL6TrLxA

There were five people behind the counter preparing subway style. Ordering was confusing to the guy taking orders, the next guy was in training or just didn't know english at all, cause the next guy was trying to run the whole operation and also explain in spanish instructions for everything. So there was some fumbling and confusion. There was a presumable manager just standing behind them, never said a word and didn't lift a finger. Workers were obviously stressed and people in line were frustrated. Food was mediocre, but still seemed like the best option considering the alternatives.",sbinjPPaOBEUXsmeU8momQ,0,0,1,lfJjRin3CpZ0VqhonLmGSA

We were told that it would take 10 minutes to cook eggs for breakfast burritos, seriously?? Good thing there are so many other choices to eat.",6UAMmtOI_dMgVAoJh29S6w,0,0,1,uwSh15hvztFX_-_xNVKsEA
