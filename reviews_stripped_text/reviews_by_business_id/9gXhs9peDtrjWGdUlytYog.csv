We ordered twelve sliders and three orders of fries, and we received that order after TWENTY minutes. We drove home (a three minute drive) and we opened our bags. Eight of our sliders came neatly packaged in styrofoam boxes, and our three fries underneath. At first we thought they got our order wrong, but we found the last four sliders UNDERNEATH the fries. As a result, the four burgers on the bottom were flat as pancakes and damp with grease because they were not put in a box. Our burgers were room temperature and our fries were slightly warm. I'm assuming that our burgers were made first and were sitting around until the fries were cooked. The burgers were good, very similar to White Castle and the fries were nice. The wait and the temperature were dissapointing however.",0AviTKkNqRy0tiwzd8kZew,0,0,3,MDNYVKFonUrv53MZdrNW4Q

The burgers weren't that great tasting and despite just coming off a grill it was sort of cold (I ate one as soon as I got in the car) I was also expecting it to be in its own building with a drive thru but that wasn't a huge deal. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to make another trip if the food was good. The girl that took our order was really nice though.

We all ordered  the brown bag special -4 burgers, fries and a coke-we added cheese . Everyone enjoyed them. They are white castle style burgers. better than some of the other fastfood burgers in this town. They were cooked fresh, had onion  and pickle, perfect for what they are. The shop is located  in a gas station, but so what, they have their own little area. A single burger is .69 with cheese .89.  Worth a try for a quick burger meal.

The location could be a lot better but the burger and fries more than make up for it! The fries taste great, They are light and crispy with a good salt ratio. The burgers are very simple (patty, grilled onions, cheese, and a pickle) Although very simple they are great! They have a white castle vibe and when they are hot they are down right addicting! I see these guys coming up in the future, They could add some different cheese options (pepperjack, swiss, maybe?) Just to set themselves apart from white castle. That is going to be a big thing as I really do think they have a white castle thing going on at least with their burgers for that matter (not a bad thing) Either way I have to say that I will be back and will enjoy these quicker burgers as they are fun to eat and where else can you get a piece of birthday cake with your burger?",i7K3PDFJzXJSebzCj8UYJw,4,2,4,Xg6ZCbGFUJNdjFQraE18pA

Location leaves a lot to be desired- yes, it's in a gas station convenience store. But it's also kind of a seedy intersection and a run-down plaza, with a vaguely dirty store. The Quickee area also is oddly blocked off with dine-in counters but no stools?

Not sure if I was shorted the drink with my #2 combo or if it somehow doesn't come with one, but adding cheese is essential to maintaining the WC taste. $6 for the four-piece meal is not a bad lunch.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,6,3,JmSYUnSD5GSRf6ajj4MjkQ

This place has been open for a few months now and after seeing it on Groupon, I decided to give it a try. When I looked up the location, I realized it was located inside the Arco gas station on Craig and Rancho...that should have been the first red flag right there. When I presented my Groupon, I was told that it couldn't be accepted because their Groupon system was down. Ok....but I have the paper print out right here...But still the cashier refused. After some convincing, along with a few choice words he accepted my Groupon and I placed my order.

About 5-10 min later, I received my order which was pretty reasonable given that the cashier appeared to be the only one working at this joint. It's pretty much a hole in the wall at the back of the gas station convenience store and isn't a pretty place at all. The only good thing is that their prices are dirt cheap, however, the food is garbage and basically inedible. Expect to get your order to go because there is only enough counter space/stools for maybe 4 people.

I'm not sure how anybody can mess up a burger/slider but they managed to. Their sliders are so bland and the meat is so low quality I lost my appetite. Their fries would be decent if they weren't over-salted but they put so much salt on them that it was basically a salt lick. The shakes are terrible too...they basically tasted like a concoction of ice and milky water - bleh! I barely ate any of my food before I stopped and trashed it all. It's absolute crap and disgusting. If there were an award for Worst of Las Vegas, this would be my #1 pick.

Their sliders are supposed to be like White Castle.. Very similar look, they come with onions and pickles. You have a choice of cheese or no cheese. 

I so wanted to love these burgers. I can't say that I did. The patties tasted plain, cheap, and frozen.  I had to add mustard and ketchup to disguise the taste of the patties a little. The vanilla milk shake reminded me of a frosty vanilla pudding. Nothing amazing. 

This place has potential and a great idea. Maybe some tweaks in the food will bring them to the next level. The service was fast and friendly.

2944964,2014-10-23,7,9gXhs9peDtrjWGdUlytYog,"Okay yes. I am spoiled by White Castle cause I'm originally from Chicago. I did however, keep an open mind when visiting this place and I drove all the way from Henderson for the experience.

No matter how I tried, I could'nt come up with a reason to come back to this establishment.

The location is dismal ( in a really dirty gas station ) , no parking, nor drive thru and no indoor seating.

Upon arriving I placed my order and was not given drink cups, and had to get directions on how to get a drink cup from another customer.  Food comes in nondescript white and brown paper bags. No logo or anything to indicated where this food is from on any packaging. This should'nt matter though if it is good.

It was mildly remeniscient of sliders from White Castle but we had one customer in front of us and two behind and still had to wait ten minutes for our food.  This made me think that at least it would be fresh. NOPE!  Stone cold and dry!

Anyway, so come to find out that there was a man standing about four feet from me the whole time.  I thought he was either a loiterer or just an obnoxious patron dressed like a street person.  Come to find out he is the owner and he made it his focus to offend all seven people in the place before they left.  WOW!

If you want to be disrespected and sold low standard food go there. Otherwise, wait for the real deal in the future when White Castle opens on the strip.

4014594,2014-12-02,3,9gXhs9peDtrjWGdUlytYog,"Really not too much of a great comparison to White Castle (even the frozen ones).  I give it 2 1/2 stars, although I went opening week so maybe quality assurance is better now.

Was excited to hear we had some White Castle 'competition' coming to town with Quickee Burgers.  As a note, there is no actual Quickee Burgers restaurant - to find it you will have to jaunt into the AM/PM on the corner of Craig and Rancho (home of the same strip mall where you can get great Thai food (albeit in a bar)).  Quickee Burgers is located inside in a small area.  Really only takeout, no real seating anywhere unless they add a few stools eventually.  So order, take home, or eat standing up.

Found the Groupon that would feed two folks for $10, but we managed to stretch it for four.  Comes with 10 Quickee Burgers with cheese, 2 orders of fries, and 2 milkshakes (we opted for Black & White - combo of vanilla and chocolate).  We also picked up a free slice of Red Velvet birthday cake when checking in with Yelp (not sure if that's still available).  Order was in quick, but prep was really slow.  Granted it was grand opening and folks were still trying to learn how to communicate with each other.  After a 15 minute wait, our order was ready to go.

Honestly really disappointed with the quality of Quickee Burgers burgers.  They are a tad larger than the ones from White Castle, but damn were they pretty flavorless.  Buns were good but on the cold side, would have helped with a warming on the grill.  Burgers?  Dry as a bone, and lacked so much flavor.  Would have been a benefit if they cooked it like White Castle does, poke holes in the burgers so the steam from the grilled onions below moisten and flavor the patty.  Easily, our patties were all overcooked and lifeless.  I'm really not sure if they even used salt & pepper on them!  Condiments were the norm - cheese was some sort of cheddar (although it was bordering on Kraft singles), some onion bits, pickle, mustard & ketchup.  But still overall the burger was dry.  I ended up adding some mayo to mine to get them back up to par.

Fries were OK though.  Thin, salty, but not quite cooked enough.  All got limp before we got home.  Maybe a bit more time in the oil would have made them much better.  But the taste was good.  Shakes were pretty mediocre.  Shakes were too light from having too much air in the mixing machine.  Not close to a thick shake at all, but like cheap soft serve.  Plus it was cloyingly sweet!  Really had an artificial taste to them, probably from their shake mix.  Wasn't my favorite.  Although it looked super cheesy, the Red Velvet birthday cake was actually pretty good.  It's just a plain sheet cake covered in birthday frosting, but the cake itself was moist.  

Was a good effort Quickee Burgers.  But I think I will stick to waiting until White Castle actually comes to Las Vegas (soon baby, soon).  Or I will just opt to buying the frozen ones from my local warehouse store and reheat them in a pan.  Unless the quality of your burger improves by a few bounds, I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon.  Taste, I need taste!

I came here pretty much an hour after they opened.  I had a groupon to order 24 burgers, 4 orders of fries, and something like 4 cakes.

I was told right off the bat that they didn't have any fries. I asked if a fries to burger ratio could be worked out. 

I had the notion of getting the burgers made fresh with no pickles, but that also wasn't in the cards today. I was told between a recently made big order, and not getting their supply shipment yet, I wouldn't be able to get any freshly made burgers without pickles. 

Fortunately, the cashier and I was able to work out a decent fries to burger ratio, and she threw in a couple of extra burgers and cakes.

The burgers tasted like frozen then microwaved White Castle. The red velvet cakes tasted like they were grocery store sheet cakes. I honestly think they were since they had happy birthday type decorative frosting on it.

I went in not expecting much from the food, it all tasted like I expected it to. Frozen patty burgers in a gas station. There were some unforeseeable snags but good customer service made up for it.

Quickee is located inside the ARCO gas station on the corner of Rancho and Craig.  Believe me....this is a prime location for some people watching...if you know what I mean!

The menu is limited to cheeseburgers, fries, can soda and a ""black and white"", which is their version of a shake.  The cheeseburgers are small, like White Castle.  They have onions, pickles, cheese and mustard on them. 

For fast food, I guess they were ok.  They don't hold a ""fry"" to In&Out burgers for sure.  The bread got too soggy and the patty was pretty flavorless. The fries came out lukewarm and weren't anything above average in taste.

The service was great though and we were in and out within 10 minutes.   The best thing was the shake.  I would go back for one of them, if I got the hankering for a shake again.  I wouldn't return to this location after dark, however.  :/",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,7,3,2,ZUlSKaDcRAZIBdfmsbJU1g
