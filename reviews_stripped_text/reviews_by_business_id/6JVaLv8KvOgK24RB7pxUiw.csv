The staff is always extremely friendly and helpful, and the food is always made to order fresh, is consistent, and is made in a very timely fashion for those in a hurry... Not to mention the restaurant is always clean. The roast beef panini and the fish 'n chips are two of my favorites... and the prices are reasonable, between $7 and $15 for an excellent meal. Definitely check this place out... the chef is so great that he will whip up special orders, even if they aren't on the menu! THAT'S customer service at its finest.",uli1OLLm6brLI6QtWm80iA,2,3,5,UnpmXJmSHLwyWv4x98sOjA

Still a great meal and the prices are good.  I wouldn't recommend the salads, but the sandwiches are great!

971172,2010-11-24,0,6JVaLv8KvOgK24RB7pxUiw,"Sunset Grill is conveniently located in my office building complex. I only knew it existed because I drop the rent check next door at the property management office. My husband had dropped me off at work because my car was in the shop AND I had inconveniently forgotten my lunch at home so I was stranded and hungry. I decided to give Sunset Grill a try and it turned out to be a good decision. The menu is pretty extensive for the size of the place. I called in my order and left right away to walk over. My food was ready when I got there. The staff was friendly and there were several people dining at tables (even at 1:30 pm). 

I ordered the Southwest Ciabatta Sandwich with fries. The fries were kind of cold, but still had good flavor. I'm not a huge fan of ""breaded"" fries so maybe next time I'll try a different side. The sandwich was warm, flavorful and the perfect size. 

I didn't give it more stars because the tomatoes were pretty yellow (aka not ripe) and while I will come back if I need a close, decent place, it was just kind of average.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,1,2,3,Kvecq8CLHFG84_YlCWVidg

1156360,2011-06-17,0,6JVaLv8KvOgK24RB7pxUiw,Sunset Grill is located in the office complex that I work in so our group orders once every week or so.  The fare is simple but the food is always great.  You cannot imagine how FAST they get food to you.  I am writting this review to let you know that I stumbled onto the Southwest Chicken Cibiatta sandwich today.  Holly crap was it amazing!  Fantastic flavors.  Definitely my new lunch of choice there.,9kMi8dCXhj0i08a41DSVqw,1,0,5,T0Tyk_fsOx0_Syl3nAFXTA
1766415,2014-06-25,0,6JVaLv8KvOgK24RB7pxUiw,"Cute little place around the corner from skinny fats which has become way too overcrowded to make it a viable work week lunch spot (thanks tourists). The workers here were super friendly and the menu is straightforward and budget friendly. The BLT with garlic aioli and a side of fruit was the perfect amount of food. My only disappointment was breakfast isn't served all day, but I'll definitely be back to try it!",_Bt3LewB0c1smELLqrE1KQ,3,1,4,GXkW8Q_QB71RYTtlkVba8w

I'll be back to try more food! P. D. The Malibu Chicken Sandwich not worth it, just a bun with a chicken inside.",Bz34VTqLznzgyHJjUB43wQ,1,0,4,kc_-BWn6aooZsIPNBi8x-g
1837688,2015-12-09,0,6JVaLv8KvOgK24RB7pxUiw,"Blackened chipotle chicken wrap was pretty bland: chunk chicken (no trace of blackened) with a shit ton of shredded iceberg lettuce and some underripe tomatoes on a plain, cold tortilla wrap, with some not at all flavorful mayo sauce. I could have opened a can of chicken  and it would have as much flavor. Fries are decent. 8.50 for wrap and side. 50 cents extra to use a credit card. A couple of outdoor tables. Cheesy 8x10 Xerox pictures of someone's family in Hawaii on the tables, with the fake orchids. Friendly staff. And no evil styrofoam.

update 12/8/15: ordered delivery of a Malibu Chicken sandwich. Somehow got a plain ole' squished, cold and greasy, barely any cheese having grilled cheese sandwich, but was still charged the full price. $10 for a terrible grilled cheese and bag of nasty ass Lay's potato chips, no thanks. I won't be making this mistake again.",750rhwO7D_Cul7_GtO9Jsg,1,0,1,LFz--V8lFhQL8SvdeSEvMQ

The food has been very good and the portion size on the omlette is huge. The owner is very nice, nice atmosphere. 

Only slight negative was on my omlette it took a little longer than what it should have. Other people got their food before i recieved mine.....

Still highly recommend this place.....",0-NEnD1WLmSUBezIKWY3_A,1,1,4,aY2J_gQOFmEkyNs2K9IS9w

The food is great - exactly what you hope for at lunchtime. We had a Sunset Philly and Tuna Salad Sandwich - both very good.  We liked the side-options.

2348822,2014-07-05,0,6JVaLv8KvOgK24RB7pxUiw,"We went to Sunset Grill for lunch at a last minute second decision. Service is walk up counter service and they bring the food to you. Service was quick and friendly. The BF got a club sandwich, basic with the usual and he said it was good. I got the Blackened Chicken Chipotle Wrap, it was good. Basic, blackened chicken, lettuce, tomato and chipotle mayo. BF got potato salad which to me tasted like it had some jalapeno in it? It was good though. The portions are a good size. It was nice to visit a different local lunch joint but I don't think we'll be back unless we are in the area. They seemed to get alot of business from the shops and other business in that area, so it's good to know they will stay busy.",EPa3uxyyGfRMpPX47lKwvQ,0,0,3,iw2Q1Sm_5J6KhhtKp7HTOw

There's nothing AMAZING about it, food wise, but everyone is always SUPER friendly and nice. The food is your basic deli type of items, none of it is horrible at all. It's all good. However, just normal, basic sandwiches, burgers and stuff. 
Again, it's all about the service here. GREAT people. GREAT smiles. It's always a pleasure coming here.",sfQXLZGk6beiSuNZYb8iSQ,2,2,4,IFiexd-otBlL0okn1caqVg

Got the blackened chipotle wrap, previous review was spot on, too much dressing and lettuce and no trace of blackening mostly just seasoning. Also side pasta salad was very unsatisfying how ever the menu is extensive enough I m sure I will find something I will like  and other's plates looked promising.",9zIkJDlYgJ_bYOpun8jMFw,1,0,3,PQoRLpW03JYFMLZYyjpe9Q

Jr club sandwich, Cesar salad and this last time the blackened chicken. With the blackened chicken all I could taste was cumin and tomato ( the menu doesn't even say it comes with a tomato and I didn't ask for any) and the prices are pretty high for what the food is.

4808696,2015-09-11,1,6JVaLv8KvOgK24RB7pxUiw,"The time before last that we ordered delivery from here, it took them more than an hour to get here. When the delivery girl arrived we asked if the food had been sitting in the car that long (it was a 110 degree day), she said she did do some other deliveries but the food should be fine. We took her word for it but shouldn't have. I ordered egg salad and it was really warm and my french fries were cold and soggy. Took one bite to realize before I threw it all away. 

We decided to give them another try today. They got here in a timely manner, probably about 30 minutes. I opened my container. Being the picky eater I am, I started to take off the lettuce and tomato before taking a bite, good thing because if not I probably wouldn't have noticed the hair in my egg salad until it was in my mouth!

5611866,2013-12-27,0,6JVaLv8KvOgK24RB7pxUiw,I ordered the Malibu chicken sandwich with fries. Not quite what I was expecting. The sandwich is frozen style chicken fingers with ham on a sourdough bun. The chicken was not good. My wife ordered the blt and she did not care for it either. Thin bacon and the tomatoes looked like any other fast food restaurant.

You may want to call in your orders early because they are typically busy during lunch hours. The dining area is rather small, so taking your food to go shouldn't be out of question.

Nice, local diner. I like it",XXqspxyaoS9b5SZ1se5TDg,0,0,4,wBd1ZB5xlui6rhiy7e0BYw
