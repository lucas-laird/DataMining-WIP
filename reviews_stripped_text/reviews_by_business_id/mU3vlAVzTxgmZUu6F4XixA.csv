20575,2017-06-01,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Simply put: We were very disappointed ! 
We ordered:
1. Pork Bun - the taste was good, but it was so fatty. 
2. Bo Ssam - we ordered the smaller portion as we did order a lot of food. This was good, tasty, but it was just OK! This was just a bbq pork presented with korean side dishes (kim chi, etc).Price was $100 ++ for half serving. 
3. Branzino fish - this was our favorite ! Fish was completely deboned and tasty. 
4. Pork Ramen - This was the worst !!! My local ramen store in San Francisco tastes much much better than David Chang's ! Broth was kinda bitter; it's hard to explain - but simply put, it was really bad.
We also had 5 glasses of Gin & Tonic. Total bill $400. 
Before we went there, we had a very high expectation given David Chang's extensive profile on TV. WRONG!!! It reminded me of PF Chang, not bad but nothing to write home about. 

Conclusion: Too much hype ! Not worth it. Way too expensive for what it is. Now, I won't even consider checking out their store in NYC.",14UI0gfALI6fcGOhYVP5KA,3,0,2,ZozvUuQwpIzL5_r0JurJdw

Got a few tasty treats from the kitchen along what was ordered. They have some really great options to choose from and the menu would probably satisfy most palettes. Lot of bold and bright flavors , and also a lot of rich dishes. 

Some of our items included :

Beets with citrus supremes ; simple but great flavors 

Confit potatos ; no need to say more 

Spicy Noodle dish with candied cashews. Great heat and nice balance from the cashews 

Pork belly buns : who needs an explanation , it's Pork belly.

Baked oysters with kim chee and some really flavorful bread crumbs. Not an oyster guy but great flavors and texture.

We sat at the kitchen bar and got to talk to the kitchen staff, and watched how stuff was cooked. Shout out to the chefs who were very attentive, noticing that we started on our ramen and buns first, and asked if we'd like them to keep our short ribs warm for us, and then getting us more gravy (and heating up our meat too!) when we ran a little low on it in the ribs. 

We had planned on getting dessert from the milk bar after dinner, but the portions were so generous that we were fully stuffed and couldn't manage any more food at all even though i was dying to try the cereal milk soft serve.

First off, customer service was top notch. Our waiter was constantly checking on us and our water kept on getting refilled without us asking. 

Second, the food was spectacular! We started with the boiled eggs topped with smoke trout eggs and crispy rice; tasty but little overpriced. We had the oysters with melon ice that wasn't needed since oysters were fresh and sweet. The cold spicy noodles were flavorful. The Pork Buns though were amazing!

Only thing edible was the pork belly bun. Everything is pretty expensive and totally not worth it. For the total cost of the meal I couldve gotten a nice piece of steak! Here is what I ordered:

Momofuku oysters: 6 oysters covered in buttered bread crumbs. Had absolutely no flavor, not even salt. $21 or $23 (forgot the actual price)

pork belly bao: $7 each, pork was tender, too much hoi sin sauce.

rotisserie chicken and bones: bones were super dry and no flavor, chicken was dry and only had scallions under the skin. Again, only flavor was the scallions. terrible version of the chinese steamed chicken with scallions and ginger. the kimchi is really just cabbage in gochujang sauce. $33

pork ramen: very small bowl, too salty!!! the infamous boiled egg you find in ramen was a badlt poached egg, not worth $18!!

yellowtail: not fresh, smelled fishy which means the fish is not fresh. And again, the sauce was so light it tasted like nothing. needs salt or ponzu or lemon...anything! $18

I've heard a lot of great things about it so my boyfriend planned a surprised dinner here when we were in Vegas. Note that they are fairly new here in the food scene but they have many locations and their NY one is very well known. 

The service was lacking a bit during our visit. Our server seemed like he was no where to be seen most of the time. We also over heard the next table waiting on their check and how the server has been taking a long time. Maybe because it was Valentine's Day and they did not put enough people on. Our server was very friendly though and did try to check up on us when he had the chance.

For the food I thought it was delicious. Some wowed us more then other dishes but overall I would say it was not bad. My favorite dish was definitely the pork belly buns. I've had a lot of pork belly before but these were on a different level. I also loveeee their cereal milk ice cream. Omgosh that was to die for and I'm still mind blown by how they got that flavor. Their cucumber salad was very refreshing and delicious. We also tried the kimchi baked oysters which I thought was good but was missing something. The ramen wasn't our favorite, I've definitely had better ramen before. The rice cake was good and flavorful but we could have gone without it.

Neighbors who liked sharing some food with us. The Pork Shoulder was good, the Pork Belly Buns were even great (serious, these were awesome), but the Chilled Sichuan Sausage Ramen was not the best.

The awesome 
Chicken buns were god damn amazing.  It was like a Big Mac elevated to heaven where everything works perfectly together 

The shrimp bun was also a wow but the shrimp party was way to big for the bun. It was tasty as hell but odd to eat since the shrimp size. 

The pork bun was pretty good. Maybe a bit heavy on the hoisin sauce 

The ssam sauce was a little tangy and didn't help the buns.  It was good but no need for the buns 

Ok now for the just ok
The ginger scallion noodles were quite a bit oily and aldente as hell.  We were kinda disappointed about these noodles 
The seaweed to me did nothing for the dish. The pickles added a nice crunch but what saved the dish was the mushrooms.  They had a bit of acid that made the dish nice and fresh 

I was hoping to pork ramen was going my to blow my mind. It fell short and was really just one note. It had a very porky broth and the park belly was god damn perfect while the shoulder was good. I think the egg beautifully cooked just added to the heaviness of the dish. The bean sprouts didn't impress and just got lost in the dish. Maybe they if they weren't cooked as much it would have added some much needed texture. 
I was just hoping for something a little brighter or maybe a bit of acid. Just a couple pieces of kimchi or even a wedge of lime would have put this into the awesome class. 

My wife loved the desert but it was really sweet for me.

Pork Ramen: Again, nothing special. Flavor was good but, not worthy of the pricetag (~$20). C'mon folks, it's ramen.

Rice Cakes: Don't get me started!! Lukewarm, doughy and soggy. 

The waitress forgot my husband's drink from the get go. Our water bottle sat empty for half our meal while the couple next to us had 2!!!

Needless to say, we felt a bit out of place when sitting in a space full of graphic art (by David Choe) and the young staff that weren't either workers at the bouncy house or au pairs.  Nevertheless, this installment from the K-bro David Chang was pretty nice.

To start off, the service (they get 5 stars without question) was awesome and to much of our enjoyment Sarah was pleasant and very helpful.  The water service was crazy awesome, like as in, I felt as though I didn't deserve any of it (but I desperately needed, as indicated below) I think that's the old timer in me talking.  

Unfortunately though, the vaunted ramen from Momofuku was a salty mess.  I know, David Chang's  original vision about his restaurants was to make food that he (and his buddies) would like, and they don't give a crap if others don't...but I guess there was enough of a following of this NaCl laden palate busting concentrate of high quality ingredients that has led him to multiple restaurants and $$$$$.  More power to him and his empire.  

I wish I can say it was deep and balanced in flavor and reminded my time in Osaka and Tokyo, but it didn't.  It felt like someone made a huge mistake (which I am hoping) by adding too much of the sodium associated ingredients or forgoting to add the appropriate amount of H2O to make the soup more palatable.  I usually enjoy finishing off the broth of ramen, however, I didn't even finish the noodles.

We also ordered the buns, which were pretty good.  The mushrooms and the pork belly were delicious.  

Listen, I get it.  It doesn't matter what I say.  I'm just saying that this is not a place I'd eat ramen.  And if I were ever to seek out ramen again, I will not think of Momofuku...unless they made a huge mistake.",FvU5Di_Jwl7ilUsdbgRRKg,1,0,2,7CnAv78Oh1rvy4D_zzQPqw

Unfortunately, this is a story of disappointment. 

While the decor is amazing and the staff courteous, there is much to be desired here. Upon entering the establishment, the service is great with attentive staff and ample seating. This was lunch time on a weekday and there wasn't much traffic, with nearly 70% of the location being empty. Securing our orders was quick and easy, but this is where the quality of the experience drops. 

The Chinese buns ordered took quite a bit of time to arrive, but even worse yet was the ramen. I'm not sure what their process is, but it wasn't busy and they had plenty of staff available in their open kitchen, yet it took nearly 20 minutes for the ramen to make its way to the table. What was sad is that it tasted terrible. The broth was bland and the noodles were soggy. 

Although I wish I could say that the Chickpea ramen that was ordered was a fluke, the bland and soggy trend continued to its pork broth offering as well. Sadly, I hope that this is an off encounter, but when you're spending quite a bit on a meal and its poor, you just don't really feel the need to ever return. 

In hindsight, if the moment could have been re-lived, I'd probably order buns for takeout (if that is an option). They are excellent. But, I don't think I'll ever take a chance on this location again.",SMLLmPawDY0fZoGwAWidGw,0,0,2,SNjFynwf8ljEMnJgtD6veQ

Service was amazing from hosts to servers. Easy to spot on second floor across from Marquee. Was a breeze making and modifying reservations on open table. Milk Bar is less than 2 steps away - word on the street is you can order dessert straight to your table, drastically expediting the rate of compost cookie to mouth.

The could be better: Perhaps it was the time of day (Saturday 2:30pm) or the fact that David Chang's newest outpost is only a little more than a month old and miles away from momofuku central (NYC), both my dad and I found our ramens, pork ($18) and chickpea ($18) respectively, too salty. I could taste the potential, and it was definitely there, but the saltiness was too overpowering.

Having lived down the street from Nishi in NY and loving it, I really wanted to love this meal, and I probably will if I return in the future, but this time it was just alright.

Excited to try the baos and crack pie soft serve in ze foreseeable future. Skipped both this time because summer's a-coming and my body's already composed of 8% cereal milk soft serve from living in the city.",oAC1h6gNwkiBmCYYplYxZw,0,1,3,EbluH8ukcuhUx8MvewFgUQ

The only problem is that the prices are astronomical for the type of food, and the relative value is a tough sell.  It's basically that for every thing in the strip.  So I'm rating the place as such.  In other words, it's the strip so it's going to be expensive.

I had the pork ramen.  It was very good, rich broth and the right amount of other stuff - not too much, and not skimpy.  The broth wax very rich and flavorful.

The beer selection is well thought out and really good, so I had two craft IPAs. 

The service is very good, but you get the feeling that at any moment there's going to be a crash between the wait staff due to the pace that they're moving.  The uniforms they wear, and the professionalism is very good, but they need to smile more.  At the end of the day, the staff is very good.

This place is an example of hiring good hostesses.  Very professional, not untrained eighteen year olds.  They were well mannered, professional, and seemed to get the whole customer service thing too.  They need to smile more though.  But again, very good hostesses to kick off the customer experience.

It was good, but paying 3X for what I pay for excellent ramen back home makes me take pause.  Of course, the vibe is cooler, and that does matter.  If you're on the strip give it a shot.  Everything is expensive on the strip, but quite frankly as far as the strip restaurants go, this might be one of the better values.",jDxifg3K9uzzXW4hFK3XQA,0,0,4,6IgskeTqNcE48lDbyD0snQ

I started with the spicy cucumbers (togarashi, toasted almond, scallion). Until today, I did not know it was possible to be ""wowed"" by the humble cucumber.  With each bite, I kept thinking - this cucumber is amazing!  

Next I tried the shiitake bun (hoisin, scallion, cucumber). One of the servers brought over ssam sauce and recommended trying it with the bun. Thanks for the tip!  I enjoyed the ssam sauce so much I had to purchase a bottle to take home. 

The star of my lunch, however, was the pork ramen (pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg). So good!  I lingered over this bowl of yum for quite some time. I did not want the meal to end. But I was stuffed so had to say goodbye. (Next time I want to try the dessert!)

Being the forgetful person that I am, I left my ssam sauce in the restaurant.  Someone from the restaurant ran down the escalator to catch me. My hero!

I was sitting at the noodle bar since it was just myself and the chef brought out complementary fingerling potatoes that were delicious as well. Ramen was great, mind blowing? Probably not, but a respectable ramen for sure. Broth had a rich flavor. Wasn't too overly salt and noodles were cooked perfectly in my opinion. I've seen others comment on the saltiness and noodles being over cooked.

We appreciate chefs pushing boundaries with new bold flavors and eclectic takes on what are considered traditional dishes. Whilst David has tried to expand the flavors with black truffle, foie grass and Sichuan peppers that tingle your taste buds, the food leaves you feeling gimmicked, especially at that price. 

The foie gras shaving on the tuna barely adds the fattiness or the gaminess of foie gras. This dish would have tasted better with the tuna served on a slice of foie gras. 

The crispy rice cakes with Sichuan peppers could have used less salt. 

The saving grace on the $50 truffle ramen was the broth and black truffle. The noodles were too chewy similar to udon and not alkaline enough for ramen.

She sat our large party down in the private dining room with a nice table set up overlooking the strip. It was definitely beautiful and amazing to see the Vegas lights while eating dinner.

I must say we were highly disappointed. The menu highlighted large format dinners that would probably be good value but not easy to decide upon with a group.

We each decided to order a bun to start.
Both the pork shrimp was tasty and good sized portions. The rest of the menu seemed odd to me. The lesser priced items from the noodles and then a big jump to their higher priced selection. To me, it didn't seem they had much of a selection in the mid range of $30-$40.

I enjoy great food and don't mind paying top dollar but the menu honestly didn't excite me enough. We decided on their noodle dishes. It was bland, with very little flavor. Wish they added some type of protein in top of the dish to make it feel complete.

Service was very slow and very inattentive. Dishes were dropped off to us and our server never really came back to check on us. Our plates sat in front of us when we were done for 20 minutes or so before we had to flag someone down to ask for the dessert menu. It even prompted me to ask ""Where IS our server?"" as the gal who took our order was never to be found afterwards. Seemed like the switched servers on us, quite confusing and a bit irritating.

Momofuku - ""lucky peach""

The staff was very friendly, helpful and prompt.  We sat at the bar/ prep area so we can see some of the kitchen and prep work.  They do have booths that look out into the strip that would be appealing during dinner.  

The Shishito Peppers - smoked salt, lime  $9 were great and the wife and I plowed through them.  Worth the purchase. 

The Oysters on a Half Shell - melon ice, lime, black pepper  $24  |  half dozen were not my wife's fav. She said they were very salty and watery and maybe just an off day for them.  

The Pork Belly - hoisin, scallion, cucumber  $7 was tender and savory and enjoyed.  Also another must. 

The Sichuan Lamb Ribs - smashed cucumber, chili yogurt  $32 tasted really good but were way to greasy for my liking and maybe an issue with the meat and not the preparation. Full disclosure: the restaurant took this off our check because we barely touched them. Again, tasty just too greasy for my liking.  Also serious kudos to the wait staff... they were very accommodating and offered us items off menu and on the dinner menu during lunch.  This was an item I really wanted to try and the staff made it happen for me even though it's on the dinner menu. 

The Birthday Cake - confetti cake from ""Milk"" (next door but served in restaurant)was super super super dry.  One of the driest cakes I have ever eaten, period.  It was also still cold from the freezer/frig? Disappointing 

We don't see the Michelin stars in our visit and giving this location an average 3 stars. I personal feel this is like Gordon Ramsay's burger restaurants vs his Steak House.

1192022,2018-03-29,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"My boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas as a small trip for our second-year anniversary, and this was definitely on our list of places to try. 
We were seated very quickly (tip: make a reservation if you want to get right in when you arrive) and were extremely pleased with the polite and helpful server. 
We received a complimentary glass of pink champagne because it was our anniversary, and then we ordered cocktails. 
The drinks were small, especially for the price, but I will admit that they were especially tasty. Super delicious.
We knew we wanted to try the pork buns and some ramen, so we picked the more expensive dishes from the ramen selection, which were the Black Truffle Ramen and the Toasted Noodles.
First off, the pork buns are SO soft and practically melt in your mouth. At $7 each, they're definitely worth the price.
The black Truffle ramen was extremely tasty. I'll be dreaming about that ramen for years to come. It's more expensive at $48 compared to the normal ramen priced at $16, but worth it if you're coming here for a special occasion.
The toasted noodles were excellent, but not what my boyfriend was expecting. I think he wanted a more traditional ramen bowl, but the toasted noodles are actually a dish served on a huge plate filled with clams, shrimp, oregano and chili's. He said it was good, but he would rather get the $16 plate of noodles if he came back.
We also had a side of crispy potatoes made with truffle creme, and OH MY GOD. Seriously one of the best parts of the meal. I wanted to snatch-up the bowl and keep it to myself. 
Our bill ended-up being $200, but then again, we did order the most expensive noodle dishes, cocktails, sides and appetizers. This is definitely doable if you're on a fancy date for a special occasion, otherwise you should still come and try their pork buns and potatoes.

-- Fried chicken with caviar for $380.  Fried chicken was salty.  While the dish is unique and maybe worth a try once, I would never recommend this to anyone.  
-- Shishito peppers.  Can't go wrong with this.
-- Pork belly.  This was a hit and everyone enjoyed it and ordered more.  
-- Lobster and shrimp with garlic and pepper.  Good but definitely not a unique dish.  Have had better in authentic asian restaurants
-- Scallops.  You will go hungry if you order this as your only entree.  It came out with 2 scallops only with greens.  Definitely not worth the price.
-- Waghu beef:  Order 2 oz and cost $70.  This was the most shocking item on their menu by far and I think anyone is crazy to order this.  They came out with a cart with a salt block, torch and a very very tiny piece of beef.  They cut it into 4 pieces - imagine spam slices.  They put these thin slices on the salt block and torched it.  What do you get??? Very very expensive spam pieces for over $10 a slice.

3/5 Food
4/5 Ambiance- If you get the back area, you get the view of the LV Strip, which is pretty nice. It feels a bit more private in the back, but it may be reserved for large groups. (Our party was about 15)

Pre-Fix Price Paragraph: Okay, I want to start off stating I find it weird that EVERYONE pays a ""prefix"" menu, but not everyone get the same amount of food. For example, we would get 12 scallops for 15 guests...HMM...seems a bit unjust to me. However, there was still plenty of food to go around. For me, if I am paying a pre-fix price, I expect everyone to get the same amount, and not have to share...

I might have to say, besides the Pork Bell Bao, Lobster dish, and dessert, everything was just Meh.

Ordered: We practically almost sampled the entire menu!
1) Spicy Cucumbers - togarashi, toasted almond  - 3/5 good, but pretty simple
2) Crab Deviled Eggs - smoked trout roe, crispy bonito - 2/5 eh, wasn't my favorite dish. 
3) Pork Belly - hoisin, scallion, cucumber  - 5/5 $7 for one bun, outrageous! Anyhow, this was my favorite dish of the night. The pork belly was SOO FATTY and well seasoned!
4) Beets - citrus, rye XO sauce  4/5 probably my favorite beet dish ever
Market Greens - tomato, gooseberry, ricotta 3/5 good, but probably wouldn't order outside of prefix
5) Hokkaido Scallops - carrot, Anson Mills grains, tasso ham, tomato - 4/5 good, but would've been nice if we had our own scallop for the prefix menu.
Steamed Whole Branzino - charred lemon,  brown butter dashi, herbs 3.5/5 good, but nothing special 
6) Korean Braised Short Rib - root vegetables, chilies, sesame 2.5/5 way too salty...
7) Salt & Pepper Lobster- lobster and gulf shrimp battered and fried then heavily seasoned with fried garlic, scallions, and chilies 4/5 another delicious and well prepared plate. 
8) Korean Braised Short Ribs- Boneless beef short ribs slow cooked with daikon, lotus root, potatoes, and rice cakes.  Topped with chilies, scallions, sesame and presented family style in a donabe with rice. 1/5 inedible ...way way way way too salty.... very sad I barely touched my bowl.

We went a bit crazy on the dessert:
1) Crack pie: 3/5 
2) Birthday Cake: 4/5 I typically don't like birthday cake, but this was well made--not TOO sweet
3) Cereal Milk Soft Serve: 3.5/5 good if you're looking for something simple
4) Cinnaswirl soft serve: 3/5 Tasted like a churro--a bit too sweet for me

Milkbars Birthday Cake has been my all time favorite cake for YEARS so it was really time for me to get my Ramen on. I always feel that restaurants that open in Vegas never taste the same or as good as their originals in other cities but since I've never had Momofuku I felt I couldn't be too disappointed since I have nothing to compare this location to.

Service was great! My mojito slushee was rum yummy! I enjoyed my pork belly bun, shishito peppers and ramen. All very tasty! Tried a bite of the meatballs my boyfriend ordered and these were good too. I ordered everything from the menu that our server had NOT recommenced which can be scary at times but I did it with zero apprehension and was satisfied with all of it. 

I ordered a slice of Birthday Cake from Milkbar to go, and this was definitely a bit different. I ate it for brekke the next morning but it was dry and just totally different. I was disappointed with it and would say skip unless you've confirmed you aren't getting a dry weird slice.

I'd surely return to Momofuku again and now I'm even more excited to try them in NY.

We shared the chicken karaage and pork belly sliders. The chicken slider needed something more acidic to accompany it. It was just okay. The pork belly slider was much better, but there was too much hoisin sauce and it overpowered the entire thing.

Afterwards, we went to Milk Bar. I tried the crack pie, the compost cookie, and the cereal ice cream. The ice cream was not to my liking. I threw it in the trash. That was my fault, because I should have tasted it first. However, I love ice cream - like I should marry it, love it - so there was no reason for me to believe I would toss it all in the garbage. But that's what I did - totally gross.  The cookie was interesting, because it had all kinds of textures and flavors. And the crack pie, while delicious, made me feel like I was killing myself with sugared butter. It's definitely something to share.",lufa4bHQd3XLYQE1zXis0g,6,4,3,S1RQpvWHZiIbw2YwwiJuFQ

Made reservations ahead of time for a party of 4 and got the Fried Chicken & Caviar, the menu says serves up to 4-6 people but I can imagine it serving even 8. If you do decide to try this make sure you call ahead of time and let them know so they can prepare the order in advance. 

The Fried Chicken & Caviar included two chickens that are fried whole, carved, then paired with a choice of Momofuku Reserve caviar, we chose the 8oz Smoked Trout Roe ($328) ... They provide you crepes that you use as a tortilla and truffle creme fraiche to top off. This dish was very intriguing but after some thought I don't feel like it was too amazing.. chicken was cooked well and was moist, and the Truffel creme fraiche was the savior... Put that on top of anything you eat and you got yourself a winner. 

We also got some small dishes to balance with the meat: 
Bigeye Tuna - shaved foie gras, stone fruit; I would say pass on this, it sounds good but it wasn't to my liking. 
Spicy Cucumbers - togarashi, toasted almond; very tasty and full of flavor, it was light and refreshing.
Chinese Broccoli - black garlic, ginger; cooked well and tasted good but it's like anything you would typically get at a Chinese restaurant. 

I also got a cocktail for myself called Toki Thyme, I really liked the drink! It was well mixed and refreshing to drink throughout dinner. 

Final thoughts: Service was okay, our waitress forgot about us a few times. The atmosphere of the venue and view of the Las Vegas strip was cool and chill, especially accompanying hip hop music playing in the background. 
The presentation and deliverance of the dishes were great but the food itself was just okay. I feel everything may have been too hyped up and it just fell a bit short for me. Good experience but I wouldn't come back again.",V91qgxW_rKRPmcww6xoUTw,0,0,4,nQ1lM3qp5dw7bvWFMkJZ5Q

While service was attentive and informed, the food was..... meh....

We were aiming to eat light and so our dinner included the following:
- shishito peppers: had a light brown powder dusted on it, and yet it completely lacked flavor. 
- spicy cucumber: this was a miss. It was covered with a light green wasabi sauce. Again, no flavor, just a green sauce... where is the salt, where is the garlic, where is the flavor?
- crudite plate: this was an unexpected surprise. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of paying for crudite but this came with two great sauces, a lovely take on hummus and another on bacon ranch sauce). Both the sauces were delicious and the par-blanched vegetables were a great vehicle for eating the sauce. There was also some pickled cauliflower. The only thing is that cucumbers were kinda overly cold and spongy.
- fried brussel sprouts - over fried and then sauced with a sweet/sour glaze.  I've had better, my dining companion thought it was delicious. So I'll let you decide.
- asparagus with bone marrow - fancy sounding, bland tasting. 
- ginger/sesame cold noodles. A fellow diner recommended it to us, and so, sure, I'll take a stab.  NOT.WORTH.IT  skip. Again the cucumbers were disappointing (can we please partially peel the skins?).

Appetizers:
1) Chicken Karaage - I had some pretty bomb Chicken Karraage before and Momofuku does not make my top 25 list of best Chicken Karrage.  The chicken was over seasoned, and very salty, the only saving grace was the dipping sauce that accompanied the Chicken.  I would rate this a 1 out of 5 stars.

2) Spicy Cucumbers - this was the best appetizer, the cucumber was nice and cool on such a hot summer day.  The peanuts and the seasoning was amazing.  5 out of t stars.

Buns:
1) Pork Belly Buns - Amazing 5 out of 5, I could eat 20 of these by myself.

Salads:
1) Beat Salad - Amazing 4.5 out of 5 stars.  The fresh blackberries were a great touch on this salad.

Noodles
1) Ginger Scallion Noodles - nothing special here, and not worth the price tag.  3.5 of out 5 stars.

Sides:
1) Chinese Broccoli - this was okay, this was cooked in too much lemon, all I could taste was the lemon flavor and not the Chinese Broccoli.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

Being a big ramen connoisseur, that was what I wanted from here. It was a good thing that I had read previous reviews of this place or else I wouldn't have know to ask. Basically, ramen is not on the menu, you have to ask for it. So I ordered a tonkatsu ramen and a couple of buns shrimp and pork belly ones. These were all fantastic and if I had to die, then I'd be a satisfied person. So what you get here is not only quality food but you get a great atmosphere with great ambiance. The service was excellent and if you want first class place this is it. The price is what you would expect when a place is located in a big time hotel in Las Vegas so it wasn't shocking.

David Chang's vision for a restaurant experience is embodied from the moment you walk into the elegant, modern dining room and from every interaction with the amazingly attentive servers. Our water glasses were never left unfilled for more than a couple minutes at a time, and our servers were all so friendly and helpful with recommendations as well. Of course, the food did not disappoint!

We started our dinner with the shrimp buns, which consisted of a chunky, hot shrimp patty along with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, and iceberg lettuce on a soft white bao--what a flavor combination! Our server even brought over a tiny squeeze bottle of ssam sauce for the shrimp buns, and the sauce added the perfect touch of sweet and spicy flavor!

Even though the ramens technically aren't on the dinner menu, our server allowed us to order it anyway; the shoyu pork ramen, which came with a rather light broth, pork belly, pork shoulder, and a poached egg was executed perfectly, though I didn't find it all that memorable. But by far my favorite dish was the mind-blowingly delicious chilled spicy noodles. These green noodles were flavored with a thai basil pesto dressing, along with pickled jalapenos, lean Sichuan sausage, and candied cashews. Oh my goodness.. I savored every last bite and drop of sauce of this dish that combined spicy, salty, acidic, meaty, umami, and herbal flavors, along with an awesome crunchiness and nutiness that were simply unparalleled!

Rotisserie chicken - the waiter made it sound better than it was but it was still a solid dish.  We asked for more kim chi but they only give it if you buy more. 
Meatballs with beans - the bacon is very prominent.  This is a hardy dish, no wonder it cost $18.

Usually, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where food poisoning originated from, but in this case, my friend and I both got food poisoning and this was where we ate together. 

I ordered the pork belly bun and their pork belly ramen. The pork belly bun was pretty flavorful, the pork belly was extremely fatty but super tender. I wish there was a little bit more pickled veggies to cut the fattiness of the pork, but all in all, the pork belly bun was really enjoyable. Pretty small for the price point, since they only give you one bun. I wouldn't exactly say it's worth the price, but it's definitely worth it to try once. 

The pork belly ramen, on the other hand, was very flavorful and beautifully presented. It had bamboo shoots, seaweed, pork belly, a soft poached egg, and more. The noodles were cooked on the softer side, but still with the right amount of firmness. The broth was super salty, but paired well with the noodles. The pork belly I got in my bowl was basically a slab of fat. It was really good! But still, I can't fathom the thought of just eating a steak of fat. 

Service was good. There was no wait. The restaurant is located inside the Cosmopolitan. We were charged $1 per person for water, and we were given no warning which water would cost what. The restroom is nice, but there's only one per gender so the wait can get long for the women's restroom. Prices are standard for what you can expect in vegas, but considerably expensive anywhere else.

Overall, left feeling like I had a decent meal that didn't live up to the hype and prices with ok service in a decent environment.

Food: Pork ramen was fine. They use pork shoulder and the texture just isnt as good as the firmer and chewier pork slices ramen typically comes with- this innovation, while tender, simply made the mouth-feel of the pork more soft and mushy. The egg was great as would be expected. The ramen wasn't bad and was fairly springy and chewy. Broth was well developed although a little salty. Chicken karage buns were tasty- I enjoyed these.

Service: friendly, not amazing but not bad.Somewhat awkward sitting at the ramen bar looking straight into the kitchen (which is cool) but with chefs/cooks looking at you but not really interacting either-just made it kinda weird. 

Value: Sorry, but it is just too expensive for what you get. I think I paid like 18 and 11 for the ramen and buns, respectively? Yes it is Momofuku and yes, it is Vegas, so fine, maybe like 14 and 9 would be reasonable?

coast again, I jumped at the opportunity to be able to try David Chang's food in Vegas.

The food here is on the expensive side for what you're getting. $34 for chicken katsu is OBSCENE. I've literally never heard of any restaurant charging that much for panko breaded fried chicken. So I have to subtract 1 star purely for that. 

My husband and I ordered the Pork ramen (pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg) and the Chilled Spicy Noodles (Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashew). 
The ramen arrived first and it tasted great!! It doesn't really taste like any ramen I've eaten in Japan or at any ramen joint in LA, but the noodles were awesome as was the broth and the pork belly had super crispy fatty skin that melted in my mouth (does that even make any sense?!). The difference between this broth and other ramens I've eaten is that this one had a very ""American"" taste to it. I'm not sure how else to describe it!

The star of the meal was the Chilled Spicy Noodles. Holy shnikeys, this was SO FREAKING GOOD!! I love bold flavors that punch you in the mouth and this perfect bowl of noodles fit the bill. Spicy, slightly sweet from the candied cashews, umami rich, and a hit of tanginess from the pickled jalapeños. Oh man, I was so tempted to order a bowl of this to-go. This was my husband's order and I had food envy throughout our entire meal as I had chosen the pork ramen. Once I took a bite of the chilled noodles I didn't want my pork ramen anymore, that's how good it was. The sauce that coated the noodles was like a Thai basil pesto. Aaaaah I want more!! I only wish I had gotten a photo of it before digging in but it was one of those #uglydelicious bowls so I was like nahhh. But now I regret not having a proper photo of one of the best cold noodles I've had in recent years. I do, however, have a photo of a half eaten bowl so please enjoy. 

If you're staying in or anywhere near the Cosmopolitan DEFINITELY try the Chilled Spicy Noodles at Momofuku. I promise it'll give you a full blown foodgasm.",X7ZMoUGbKAChYB6jVT0JTg,1,0,4,EdTKwcPTEqJQwyryOiuWdA

The cocktails and sake were definitely on the pricier side $15-$25, but came in amazingly small portions. The chicken Katsu with shiitake gravy alone was $32.. And when we received it, it was just a normal Katsu portion (maybe seven pieces after cutting) covered in sauce. The $32 did not even include rice. Each bowl was an additional $4. Sure, it tasted good but the value just was not there. Especially since Vegas has so many other great Japanese restaurants to offer that are so well priced. Trust me, I don't mind splurging on a meal, but I definitely want to walk away thinking ""Wow, that meal was worth it.""

momofuku las vegas has a little bit of everything on the menu.  the starters, the seafood, the noodles, the buns and the meat.  we ordered a pork belly bun, pork belly ramen and the ginger scallion noodles.  all 3 were really just mediocre at best.

the bun was bland.  lots of sauce was inside and we were given their other red sauce (which by the way is pretty good), but overall i can get a way better bun in wesminster lol.

the pork belly ramen was salty has hell.  as if the chef making the broth was going through some emotions and literally was sobbing into the broth.  THAT salty.

the ginger scallion noodles tasted healthy.  i was in no mood for meat, and ordered it because i was told it was super refreshing.  honestly, i think if the noodles were completely cold it would have made it much better.  the cold refreshing taste of the seaweed, cucumbers and mushrooms was quickly cancelled out by the warm noodles which totally put me off.

the food was definitely whatevs, but the service was GREAT.  located at the cosmo.  make reservations!

I drank sake, but my friend ordered the Jade Dragon (pisco, jalapeño, and melon) which I loved and kept stealing. Just know it's caliente...and I'm not referring to the temperature of the drink.

Shishito Peppers
Spicy Cucumbers
Pork Belly Bun
Shiitake Buns
Chicken Karaage

1506024,2018-05-29,1,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Fun fact: David Chang is one of my chef crushes. He's always smiling or laughing on camera, he absolutely loves what he does, and he's not pretentious about it. 

I first heard about Momofuku on No Reservations (Anthony Bordain is another chef crush), and I made a mental note to visit one of the locations some day. My first opportunity to do this was last summer during my Vegas trip.

First and foremost, you know something will be spectacular if it's housed in the Cosmopolitan. Momofuku's location makes it a hot spot for atypical visitors, so when you're not looking at the gorgeous view of the strip (pictured), you can sneak some peaks of the quirky people around you. Don't like those loud cowboys lookin' for a big juicy burger and letting everyone around them know? You probably won't find any of those here.

We had a reservation, so I'm not sure what the typical wait time is. The restaurant was packed, though. 

After being seated, my eyes shot to the drink menu. Almost immediately they land on the spiced slush drink. When in Vegas, gotta try something different! It tasted like a spicy frozen margarita, for those who like those.

We started off with the crab stuffed deviled eggs, because why the heck wouldn't I try David Chang's seafood deviled eggs? Those are three of my favorite things! They were definitely the strangest deviled eggs I've ever had, and also pretty darn tasty. 

We also ordered the ahi tuna with tomatoes and cheese, because this was a night of fusion food! I'm also always craving poke, so it was bound to be ordered. I'm not sure if it was actually listed as a fusion poke, but pretending that it was, this was also the strangest form of the dish I've ever had. I would have never thought to pair raw fish with tomatoes and cheese, but it was oddly delicious. Sometimes I wonder if David Chang thinks of dishes while he's really high...maybe that's what most chefs do though?

We ended with the smoked pork chops. Though well cooked and seasoned, this item was easily forgettable, compared to the other items we ordered. I'd say order it only if you want something safe.

The menu is rather limited, and the only entree that appealed to us was the pork ramen. Everything else was either really expensive, or appetizer sized. So, we got three pork ramens with three pork belly buns. 

Sounded like a good idea at the time, but it ended up being too much pork belly - I didn't think such a thing was possible! The pork belly bun was definitely the highlight - a generous slab of pork belly sandwiched between a Chinese bao, along with some picked cucumbers and some kind of sauce. Unfortunately, we were so full from the ramen that we ended up having to take the buns to go, and it made the perfect midnight snack!

The ramen, meanwhile, was pretty standard. Fatty slices of pork belly in a soy sauce broth with thin noodles and your standard ramen toppings (seaweed, bamboo, etc.). Good, not overly salty, but definitely didn't wow me either. Our server was a perky blond woman and very attentive.

I ordered it on their recommendation but the broth was a bit too salty for me.
The heart of palm and avocado dish was disappointing with very thin slices of each with ""mayonnaise"" in the middle of the dish. Now, two days later writing this review, I don't remember what my other two entrees were.

The ramen was perfectly al dente and alkaline. Broth was piping hot as it should be. Truffle ramen, chick pea miso ramen, and the classic pork belly tori paitan style ramen- all perfect and so unique in their own ways.

There are also very good appetizers like the spicy cucumber and baos. I highly recommend the cucumbers. There's an excellent balance of acidity, sweet fresh cucumber, roasted almond, and a little bit of heat. The baos are just always awesome, too. 

The prices here are a bit steep for what you think you're ordering,  but that's just Vegas+David Chang. Outs width it to splurge now and then!

I swear that Momofuku is supposed to be known for their ramen but it was SUPER disappointing. I thought the broth was SUPER salty and the worst part about it is that it was luke warm. How can you have ramen that is luke warm... I'll say the pork belly was actually not bad. Could be a bit more tender but i thought it was actually okay. Also, it's the most expensive ramen i've had too.. I know we're at vegas and all but $18 for it is just EXTREME. I would even have to consider paying $18 at ramen dojo(not that it is $18 but if it was) but for momofoku...damn that was damn expensive AND I wasn't full at all. Also, had a few bites of the kimchee pork bowl. Another dish you can probably skip out on. I thought it was a little better than my ramen honestly but the rice was mushy. I could probably use more kimchee too. It's more like a bad take on a bimbambap.

There are some things that they did do well though. The crispy potatoes were pretty good even at $12. It was HOT(like I would want my ramen to be HOT) and I like all the cheese and the crispness to it. What I thought was really wonderful was their dry roasted mussels. That was definitely on point delicious. A good amount of garlic, onions, and even bacon bits. It all went very well with the mussels and they give a generous amount. I thought it be pretty delicious to have that mussels with a bowl of rice and you mixed on those ingredients from the mussels with the rice and it be sooo good.

Our server, Anna, was lovely - just the right amount of attentive without hovering and was really helpful. 

First, the cocktails are SO FUN! I ordered the Heart of Te Fiti (mezcal, chartreuse, citrus, almond, cardamom). For mezcal lovers, this is for you! And, I love how inspired (Moana) the cocktail was. This needs to be at Disney - stat! My boyfriend ordered the Draft Negroni (gin, campari, sweet vermouth, orange oil). I loved the orange on the nose as you drank this cocktail. Both cocktails were stiff. 

As for the good stuff, we had the: 
*Bigeye Tuna (shaved foie gras, strawberry): The strawberry was just BEAUTIFUL on this. The touch of sweetness was perfect with the oily tuna, rich foie gras. This is not a combination I've had anywhere else. 

*Pear & Burrata (hazelnut, young lettuce, black truffle) - I can never resist burrata, so I had to try this. While not listed, the main flavor of this is the pesto. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the combination. BUT this isn't a must try like the other dishes. 

*Pork Belly + Shrimp Buns - When you're at Momofuku, you have to get the buns right? The Pork Belly is fine. It's good but so many places have pork buns like these that I think it's become a commodity. However, the shrimp bun was spectacular. It reminded me of a spicy honey walnut shrimp...but in bun form of course. Damn I could have had just the shrimp buns for dinner & have been satisfied. 

*Steamed Whole Branzino (charred lemon, brown butter dashi, herbs) - This was a beautiful fish. I'm used to fish being served head to tail like this, but Anna kindly offered to remove it for us. Some reviews said that this was too acidic, but I thought it was perfect with the savoriness of the butter + dashi. I could DRINK the seasoning on this & the branzino was the perfect vehicle. This was a lot of food & I felt like it was worth the $68. 

For dessert, we had the crack pie a la mode. It's exactly what it sounds like ...crack pie with cereal milk soft serve. In full transparency, I don't like either of these separately but they're a match made in heaven together. The savoriness of the cereal milk soft serve balances out the sweet butter filling of the crack pie. Yum.

Also, you have to stop by the loo for a serious Japanese toilet!

soft boiled eggs ($15) with smoked salmon roe and crispy rice. um, we had 4 halved eggs that were gone in less than a minute. it was okay considering it was a little too salty for my liking but the portions were not worth the price.

smoked pork chop ($36) with watercress. it was waaaayyyy too salty for our liking but we felt like it was too late to send it back since we ate about half of it since we were still starving.

pork ramen ($18) with pork belly + shoulder and a poached egg. it was good... but i swear, it tasted like a gourmet/elevated version of top ramen :(

their saving grace was their desserts, obviously. crack pie and cereal milk soft serve!!!

we also bought 3 cookies to take back to the hotel for munchies but they were so hard, crumbly, and chewy in a bad way.",2wDiT4U4fEVnzoG5hsuefQ,0,0,3,juUkUv4S9s9Hyr8YkE_-7g

Atmosphere was great, and our waiter was great but the food fell short for me. I was hoping to get blown away however, it was just an, ""eh"" for me. 

What we ordered:
1) pork buns - obviously very good. Good size portion for $7 each.

2) Dry aged ribeye- ehh. For $98 dollars for a 10 ounce I was hoping to be amazing and it just wasn't that memorable. The meat was extremely chewy, sooo chewy that my bf at one point had to spit it out. Fries were extremely salty, which didn't pair very well with the dry rub. The sauce that came with it, did absolutely nothing.

3) Fried Lobster & Tempura- (half portion at$136)
I was the most excited for this, but was super disappointed. The lobster and shrimp were over battered, and way to salty. Along with being overly fried, they add a bunch of sauce that makes the tempura soggy. The flavors were all there, after one of each, my palette just didn't care for it. 

All in all, I would recommend trying it however, I think there are better places to eat on the strip. We spent $300+ for a mediocre dinner. Sad day",YObdcsdelommElzGsrezUg,0,0,3,-sVUdqSLRSroT235RRZ6Qw

It's pretty hard to find a ramen place that's vegetarian friendly since the broth is usually made with pork, but Momofuku has an option for those of us who don't eat pork! 

The chickpea ramen was delicious. It comes with scallions, chickpea miso, bok choy, and crispy chickpeas on top. The different textures worked well together and the broth was so incredibly flavorful. A very satisfying bowl of ramen and the price was decent for Vegas- $16 plus tax. 

Service was fairly quick and the food came out in a timely manner. Although this may be the case at many restaurants, outside alcoholic beverages aren't allowed so don't bring a 100 oz Fat Tuesday and expect them to let you in with it.

I've heard rave reviews about David Chang's infamous pork ramen, but it was a toasty day in Vegas and the last thing I wanted was a boiling bowl of noodle soup. I had a pork belly bun to start. $7 might seem like a lot for a palm-sized bun, but you're definitely getting what you're paying for. The steamed bun was light and fluffy, and the thick slab of pork belly was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. My server recommended the chilled spicy noodles - fresh chilled ramen tossed in a pesto sauce (weird, but it works!) and topped with Sichuan sausage, candied cashews, and SPICY peppers. I'm glad this dish was served chilled, because the spice level built up quickly, though it was so good I couldn't stop eating. The service was amazing; I probably gulped down five glasses of water while eating my noodles, and my water glass never got below half-full.

1595865,2018-01-29,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Man, I really wanted to love this place. I read the reviews because my family had a craving for some good ramen, and I chose this place to go for some late-night dining based of this reviews. 

We ordered four ramens, three of the regular pork belly ramens and a chickpea ramen (I believe these are the names). We also ordered a Korean rice cake small plate and a shrimp bun as appetizers. 

We'll start with the Korean rice cake small plate. Now, my family and I are Korean, and we love us some tteokbokki (what it's called in Korean). From what we tasted, none of us thought the owner was Korean. The rice cakes were about half an inch in size and soggy, there were only about like five pieces in the entire plate of messy goodness, and the flavor just sucked. There was supposed to be some type of squid in it, but everything was just a gelatinous mess. 

The shrimp bun was the best part of the dinner, and only one of us ordered it. It was seasoned well, and was a very good size for the price. 

Now the ramen. Oh no, the ramen! I've had Japanese ramen at over fifteen locations, if not more, including in Japan. The broth is supposed to be rich from hours of boiling pork bones. The broth for our pork belly ramen honestly tasted like they just heated up water and added a pinch of salt. It was so weak that I thought I was just consuming a watered down cup of noodles. Speaking of the noodles, the noodles in our ramen varied from completely raw to undercooked. The only good thing about the ramen was the pork belly, which is the only part that was cooked correctly and seasoned perfectly. The chickpea ramen my dad had was super salty. I guess all the flavoring went into that one, which I highly doubt because the chickpea ramen is vegan. 

For the money they charge, I honestly expected at least mediocre, but I didn't even get that. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because of the pork belly and the shrimp bun, but the main parts of the meal were seriously lacking. Maybe we just went on a really, really bad cook day, because there are so many good reviews that I don't understand. If you guys want good ramen, there are definitely other places you can go that are off strip in Vegas, or it's even worth making the drive to San Diego for truly authentic, good Japanese ramen.",EEIDOiC4H0armK3JXrHDhw,0,1,2,Tffn38AgZ72QMXw-fa5O9w

Expensive but it tastes good. The ramen is definitely delicious and for the premium price that it is, it should be! I would say it's average delicious but I can still name a few places off the top of my head with even better ramen (and for cheaper). The bowl is enough to fill me up though, I couldn't really finish it after drinking a Fat Tuesday prior to coming the last I went. I do wish they had different meat options as not everyone is into the fatty meat that the pork belly has.

Service is nice and attentive and the restaurant is decorated really fancy. It's a great place to treat yourself because if you're in Vegas you're probably celebrating anyways. I definitely enjoyed eating here both times I've been. Save this place for special occasions or when you're just feeling baller rich and wanna reflect that with the dining choice just to feel baller.

We tried the spicy cucumbers which came with almonds, spice, and scallions and was pretty refreshing. The dish was not wet considering cucumbers expel a lot of water. We also ordered two of the chicken karaage buns which came with spicy mayo and pickled red onion. We thought this was especially good.

The waiter recommended a few items that were popular for our main dish. We went with the pork ramen and the chilled spicy noodles. Both of these were ok, nothing exceptional. I was disappointed in the quality of the meat that came with my ramen. It was basically a clump of pork that wasn't fully shredded and all stuck together with lots of pockets of fat. I actually put most of aside and ate the meat that was actually shredded. Like other reviews, I agree about the smoky taste. It was interesting for a one time try and I probably wouldn't get it again. I tried the chilled spicy noodles and thought they were just ok.

1639748,2017-07-23,1,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Ohh Momofuku!  I am a creature of habit and ended up coming here three times in about a week while in Vegas!! I am also a sucker for GREAT service and good food.  I fell in love with David Chang watching him on Netflix like many people I'm sure did.  His restaurants in NYC are bookmarked in my Yelp as well.  Afraid it would be jam packed, I tried to go at not peak hours to ensure a seat at the bar.  Unfortunately, for what I perceive to be such a great restaurant, the bar was pretty empty with a few chairs for me to choose from on every occasion I went. 

First things first, get the pork bun.  The hype is real people! And well deserved. The bun is perfectly fluffy and the bun to meat ratio is on point.  You are not ripping any bun off.  There is no dry bun sticking to the top of your mouth.  It is delicious and amazing, and I ordered two the first time I went. 

Next, I ordered the momofuku oysters, which were good but I'm not sure I would order again, as they weren't cheap for six oysters, and while yummy, not what I expected.  Somewhat reminiscent of an oysters Rockefeller but done with kimchi, I thought it would be spicier for some reason?? No spice, but a nice breadcrumb crunch.  Great texture, pairs well with a beer, rather salty.  But in a good way. As long as you're into that. 

On my next trip I ordered the pork bun again, the soft boiled egg appetizer and the pork ramen.  The soft boiled eggs I had to get after some serious envy from looking at my neighbor eat it the first time. It's two eggs, halved, soft boiled, with some caviar/roe sprinkled on top, as well as some other deliciousness.  You gotta like eggs to order this. (Duh).  I really enjoyed it, but you gotta love the briny pop of fish eggs as well as have an affinity for regular egg yolks.  After the appetizers I felt somewhat gluttonous, but knew what I came for, so out came the ramen.  Definitely their staple dish, it hit the spot for me.  We have no ramen in Miami (where I live) so this was as good as it gets for me.  Pork belly and shredded pork, noodles with a nice bite, salty but not too salty broth.  It's not a thick, tonkatsu broth, so don't order it if that's what you're going for.  Again, I am no ramen connoisseur so it was yummy to me.  Needless to say I was rolled out of there. 

Finally, my last trip I ordered the spicy cucumbers and the chicken karaage appetizer.  The cucumbers were great and a nice respite from my typically fried and carb heavy choices.  And then back to my typically fried choices with the chicken, although it seemed very light.  Best thing about the chicken karaage (which is basically chicken fingers) is definitely the aerated hollandaise sauce.  I wanted to ask for more but refrained. 

If you made it to this point in my review, I commend you, and will try to wrap up.  The customer service here was amazing!!! Dan the bartender, took care of me two of the three times I went to Momofuku and he was awesome.  On my second visit he introduced me to his colleague Justin who took care of me as well and remembered me when I came in the third time.  He subsequently introduced me to his colleague (Danny I believe) who also gave excellent service and chatted with me most of the time while also working a full service bar and helping other guests at the bar.  He was even able to order me the cereal milk ice cream from Milk Bar next door--which yes, does taste exactly like cereal milk, with I'm assuming homemade corn flake garnish, because it had an extra element of sweet/saltiness normal corn flakes don't have that was oh so yummy and contrasting. 

As good as the food was, the service is why I had to write this review. Great pork buns and great service!!!",ohxtm77aSt-sB6EZSLq_Xw,0,1,5,90Iou6_RiifjWTfbGMHdkw

I ordered the the pork belly buns, cold spicy noodles, and the fried Brussels sprouts. The pork belly buns were tender and delicious but it was different from NYC. It was lightly fried on the sides to make it crispy whereas in New York, it was sliced and served super delicate and fatty. Even though they were different, I enjoyed both preparations.

I thought the fried brussels sprouts were good but it was drenched in sauce. After eating half, the rest were soggy and swimming in Asian flavored sauce. I will ask for the sauce on the side next time. The spicy noodles had great flavor from the pork sausage but it was way too spicy for me.

They only really had 2 types of ramen, the pork one and the chicken one. We got the pork one just so we can compare to all the other pork ramen we've had at countless other restaurants.

Food & Taste: 1/5 - DON'T come here if you're looking for good ramen, or even decent ramen. My rating is solely on my experience with the ramen so it's possible that their other food was good. But the ramen was $18, probably over 2x what I would expect to pay for even GOOD ramen. The presentation was okay, but the flavor was awful. The broth tasted nothing like ramen broth, it was more like one part water, one part soy sauce, and about a cup of salt. Extremely salty! I couldn't enjoy the ramen at all. The pork cuts were good, but the salty and flavorless broth ruined it.

Service & Experience: 3/5 - They had decent service, our waiters were constantly refilling our waters before we finished which was good. Nothing special though, our waiters weren't too friendly or welcoming.

The ambience was nice, very cosmopolitan-y. But felt weird using wooden chopsticks at a nice restaurant where there were white, cloth napkins to use.

Value: 1/5 - Again, I paid $18 for a bowl of ramen that was worse than a $1 instant ramen I could have made at home. Even if we paid $8-10 for ramen, which is regular restaurant price for good ramen, this was barely worth the price paid. Very low value.

I feel deceived. And for that I gave it 3 stars.",FNL3VCpTXzOksAyValm0HQ,0,0,3,K8_xBXEX3cqG_7BVP64-pw

I thought the food was decently good but overpriced. It wasn't bad food but nothing to write home about. The hot tea is $25. Yes, $25 for a cup of green tea! That's insane. It doesn't even come with refils.

We ordered:
Soft boiled Eggs with salmon roe- I didn't like these just because it tastes really fishy to me. No one at the table really liked these.

Pork belly bun-these were really good. The best buns out of the 3 we ordered

Chicken karaage bun-this was decent. Didn't have a lot of flavor but how can you not like a piece of fried chicken on a soft bun?

Shrimp bun-this was the least favorite bun. It didn't have much texture or flavor.

Pork belly ramen-this was good but again, nothing special. I've had much better ramen at other places. 

Momofuku oysters- these were good. They had a nice smokey flavor and I really liked the crunchy topping

Chicken katsu with gravy-this was my favorite. I can't describe the flavor but it was really good 

Spicy rice cakes- this was so spicy I could only have a few bites. No one at the table liked this but I liked it. I would have ate more but I couldn't handle the heat

Brussel sprouts- these are just too deep fried. They were so black and tasted burnt

You can stop by the milk bar and just do take out dessert which was great. I bought a cornflake chocolate chip cookie for $3, and it was fantastic. They have shakes, other cookies, and other types of desserts as well, I believe they have alcoholic milkshakes too. The counter girl was helpful in helping me determine what kind of cookie to buy, also. She said that they opened around the beginning of 2017 too so they've only been open about three months.

Ordered the Bucatini and was met by a surprising dish. The black noodles caught me off guard, I may have just missed that on the menu but once you get past the color it is a great dish. The shellfish in this dish are cooked just right and the noodles were delicious. Big serving size for ramen so good luck trying to finish the whole dish. This was a great all around dish! As far as drinks go, I played it kind of boring and ordered their lime Vodka and Soda. Executed perfectly but then again they're hard to mess up, probably not worth mentioning on their drink menu.

The service was exceptional. Very friendly staff that made sure to answer any questions I may have had on the menu. I was sat at the bar in-front of the kitchen and it made for a great experience. I was there by myself so having these guys to watch provided great entertainment. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Most items on the menu are fairly priced, however, some other dishes on the menu definitely stuck out being over the $100 mark.

Pros:
- Good and friendly service but you expect that in Europe like this in Vegas.

- The chicken bun was awesome. The fried chicken was so soft, moist, and flavorful. Perfect.

Cons:
- The pork ramen was way too heavy. The whole thing tasted like pork grease. The noodles by themselves were excellent, tho. Cooked perfectly and great texture and chewiness.
- The pork buns had too much of whatever sauce and was really sweet. I suppose many Americans would like it.
- They gave us separate checks for our party of 10 and it was a disaster. They basically randomly combined ordered into random checks and we couldnt figure it out. For example, I got a ramen and a bun. My buddy to my right got ramen, bun, and a beer. One of the checks was two ramens and a bun. Then his beer got on someone else's check.

We came here for lunch and frankly, the results were mixed.  My wife's pork ramen was incredibly oily and the pork belly had gobs of fat.  The noodles were chewy, and they did use a slow-poached egg, just like in the Momofuku book.  The oiliness was a major turnoff (2 stars).

The dishes I ordered were much better:

Cucumber Salad - I loved how each cucumber chunk had a thin layer of avocado, and was topped with nuts for crunch and seasoned with spicy pepper. (4 stars)

Pork Belly Bao with home-made Ssam sauce was excellent, and was decent sized. Pork belly here looked better than in my wife's ramen (4 stars)

Fried Chicken - This was half a chicken with four pieces.  Very good seasoning on the crispy skin, and most of the chicken meat was juicy.  It reminds me a bit of
that golden crispy chicken that's popular in Chinese banquets, only the Momofuku version had a slight spicy kick which I liked. (4 stars)

The cocktails are overpriced even by Vegas standards. They're a couple dollars more than what the nicest Manhattan lounges charge. My drink cost the same as my entree. There were three of us ended up trying each other's drinks on accident because they were all served to the wrong people. Good thing we're not germaphobes!

The other thing that bothered me was the ""hidden"" ramen. When I asked the served about vegetarian items, she pointed out what I could eat on the menu. Right as we were about to order, my friend asked what was being served at the table next to us. The server said it was pork ramen that's not on the menu, and then she mentioned there was also a vegetarian chickpea ramen. Why not tell me that in the first place when I was asking about vegetarian options? I'm surprised we didn't need a secret password! 

We adjusted our orders a bit since my friend and I got the two ramens. I'm glad I took the server's suggestion of adding shiitakes. The ramen was good, but it definitely needed the meatiness and umami from the mushrooms. My friends loved their pork ramen, chicken katsu and pork buns.

pork buns- I prefer the pork belly in the ramen, but these were pretty good as well.

spicy chilled noodles- this was my favorite dish of the meal, actually.  It just really hit the spot with the right amount of spice and nuttiness with the basil flavor.  Would order this again for sure.

The lamb claimed to be Sichuan flavor but missing the key flavor of numbness. Might as well renamed as spicy lamb. Also some lamb pieces were too spicy and some were not spicy at all. It could meant that they did not spread the sauce evenly. 

But the one star is for the services. I finished two delicious buns and hands were greasy. I realized we didn't have the napkins. I asked the waitress for napkins. The waitress came back and told us they are out of napkins. I spent $100 in a restaurant in a five star hotel and you told me you are out of napkins. Are you f**king kidding me??? I said, I don't have anything to clean my hands! She didn't say a word then she left. Then she went to grab me the paper napkins. At that time I can only sit there helplessly with my greasy hands and staring my next dish because I wanted to take a picture b4 eating and I couldn't! . And I saw other guests came in after me are happily using napkins. It made me angrier. Later I asked my waiter. It turned out they do have napkins. They said it's a miscommunication. I am not sure if it's a staff training problem, waitress problem, communication problem or whatever problem. It's not MY problem!

The ramen includes pork belly and pork shoulder and a nice slow poached egg. The ramen is garnished with scallions, nori, cooked soybeans, and narutomaki. The ramen broth was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious. You get a lot of pork meat which was nice since the ramen is $17 a bowl. I noticed they also have chick pea ramen if you're a vegetarian. While sitting at the bar we were able to see them make ssam with rotisserie chicken and the 5 spice rotisserie duck. Both looked so delicious! The ssam meals are served with bibb lettuce and rice for wrapping and are easily shareable. The duck looked simply heavenly.

The lunch menu becomes buns and ramen only after 2:30pm, so plan accordingly. Also, the menu changes, so the pics you see on yelp may not be available to order. Overall, I would give this place 3.5*, service was great but the food is not worth the price you pay.

SOFTSHELL CRAB BUN 4* $24- This was a special the day we went. It was $24 for 2 buns which I thought was bit steep (what'd I expect really though) but it was really tasty! There was a whole softshell crab in each bun, batter was fluffy but crispy. The star of the bun was the avocado sauce and pickled peppers. The combo of the creamy avo with the freshly pickled peppers was perfect!

CHICKEN KATSU 3* $34- They recently did a ""revamp"" of this dish and it's no longer the shiitake mushroom gravy. Instead, the chicken katsu comes with a side of pickled shiitake mushrooms and a mediocre sauce with Japanese mayo. This is more of a ""traditional"" Japanese preparation of the chicken katsu. The chicken itself was prepared to perfection, meat was super juicy, outside was very flaky and crispy, but I wasn't impressed by the dish overall. I would have preferred the old katsu because it was more unique and had their own ""take"" on a katsu. For $34, I wouldn't order this again.

PORK RAMEN 3.5* $18- Solid bowl of ramen. Broth was flavorful but not creamy or oily which was nice. There's 2 types of pork - pulled shoulder and belly. Both were good, but of course that belly was bomb. That egg though ;)",6foXESDaUTxXLmp0V1T-JQ,3,1,3,wcpkXMFRoIMkpky67B-CwQ
1827294,2017-01-12,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"As a resident in LV, I was super stoked to try the long awaited Momofuku for dinner. David Chang is known for his umami style of cooking, really toning into the harmonious aspects of food/ dish design. Went in with very high expectations & food-wise they were met!

Menu is large, nicely broken into small plates & larger main entrees w/ a la carte side options. There was a salad section (looked underwhelming), a bun section, a raw bar section, small bites section, noodle/ramen section & a main entree section w/ additional side section.

Made a res. for 2 aware of what kinks/shortfalls might occur due to it being opening night. Got seated right away after being 5 mins late, & brought a bottle of our own wine from our collection ($50 corkage per btl, 2 btl max). Cool strip view, & funky interior. Our waitress was so friendly!

The waitress explained that on the noodles/ramen section the Noodles were served room-temperature & drier while the Ramen options was served very hot & in broth.

Decided not to order any salads/small bites, instead focusing on the buns, raw bar, ramen, main entrees & side dishes. Order two pork belly buns, a white fish sashimi (forget name) in a citrus vinaigrette w/ plum, the black truffle ramen, dry aged prime rib, a whole branzino, & the pommes puree.

Pork belly (fatty) buns came out right away & were taco style (I prefer when the buns are shaped as a ball that is filled versus a taco shell that is stuffed). The actual bun was amazing; great texture & flavor. The pork belly came in 3 pieces of pork (vs. shredded) was seared to perfection. My boyfriend had 3 pieces of pork belly that looked well seared & delicious (he finished it), but my bun had 2 pieces of pork that were way overly fatty & under-cooked. I had one delicious piece (truly enough for me) & dish was okay overall.

From the raw bar the sashimi came out. The fish tasted extremely fresh & the flavors from the plums & citrus really highlighted the sashimi. Wanted more plum.

Soon after a food runner came by to present the black truffle Ramen. Food runner presented the ramen & informed us it was the pork belly ramen... We informed the food runner this was not our dish... He proceeded to count out the table numbers out loud, & ask us if we were sure this was not our dish... We informed him we were sure, & that we had ordered the black truffle ramen. He whisked it back into the kitchen, while our waitress came by to present the ramen utensils/bowls. She looked puzzled why the Ramen had not been presented to the table. We informed her of the mix-up & she asked us if we wanted the original dish? (I thought this was a strange question but my boyfriend said she was just being polite due to time delay), which we confirmed we definitely did still want the truffle dish. She said she would rush the ticket & apologized again for the mix-up.

This is when the service started to hit some shortfalls. *I attribute this solely to the fact it was opening night & I truly believe that a kitchen/restaurant deserves a solid month after opening before you can meticulously judge/grade service.* 

On both sides of us the couples were either presented with incorrect items, or they were waiting exceptionally long to receive the next course. Guests seemed really on edge, both sides of the close quartering tables were chattering about how terrible the service was. The FOH floor/staff looked calm & so did the BOH open kitchen, but the Managers scurried around tending to guest complaints of time delays & incorrect/missing items. 

Whole branzino came out next. Beautiful presentation & was left for us to pick/debone ourselves. No small bones like expected, making it very easy and enjoyable to eat. Fresh fish & citrus notes made for a great dish.

 Rib-eye with marrow butter came out & was absolutely phenomenal. Cooked perfectly & not overly fatty the rib-eye was seasoned with onions/mushrooms & blew away the fish (so strange for me to say). 

Pommes puree (mashed potatoes) was literally Joel-Robuchon-status good & made me want to lick the bowl clean & ask for another portion(s). This accompanied the rib-eye & truly made me forget we were still waiting for the black truffle ramen dish.

Waitress came back out to apologize once again for wait on black truffle ramen. We asked to see the wine list & were surprised by pricing (not huge mark-up) & a good base selection. (XL wine-cellar promises future advancements to this).

Got a btl of old world Chard ( really great somm.) & the black ramen truffle finally arrived! It was worth the wait!! Truly delicious & interesting (spanish black truffles). Exactly the taste of umami to me. Great ending to meal!

Overall the service was major short-fall due to long wait time, but the food was killer, & staffing was polite, friendly & knowledgeable.. really what more could you ask for on opening night?!

Sadly did not see famous fried chix. on menu.  Large format menu looks like fun place for a group!!

David Chang aka Korean guy -  goes to Japan (read up on Japan-korea relations) to study Ramen then goes back to the states and charge the Ramen almost twice the cost. It's almost like a caucasian guy going to Africa to study the cuisine, then returns to the States doing the same thing what David Chang did. Another insult to the people of Japan, the Ramen wasn't all that. I've had better. Now I can say, I dined at Momofuku and the Ramen was terribly s**tty.

It started off kind of scary - I had made a reservation for 1 pm on Open Table.  And at 10 am I missed a call from a 212 area code.  When I listened to the message I was shocked to hear that they were calling from Momofuku asking if I was still coming for my 1 pm seating - What?  It turns out that I made the reservation for a location in New York?  The guy on the phone said that I was not the only person from Canada that had that happen to them on Open Table and was really understanding.

So then I frantically called the CORRECT location and begged them for a table for 6 at 1 pm.  Everyone was so excited to go, I couldn't bare to tell them that I messed up the reservation.  Luckily, they had had a cancellation and there was room.  WOOHOO!

The appetizers were great.  We had the cauliflower & Brussel Sprouts, a few buns, and lamb ribs to start.  The cauliflower was amazing and I could have ordered that for my meal.  I tried the Shitaki buns which were also really good.  The lamb ribs were tasty, but not my favourite thing.

Like I said... it turns out that I'm not a fan of Ramen.  Although I tried a bite of the ginger scallion noodles and that really blew me away.  I should have ordered that!

The food was delicious.  I went with a group of 4 people and we all shared.

My favorites:

The Pork Buns!  Oh good lawd, the pork buns!  They were the best.  I could have eaten 90 of em.  At the end of the meal, I wanted to order one more before we left, but I was stuffed.  I think the thing that I noticed the most was how the unique flavors and textures of everything that made up the pork bun stood out.  And they all came together perfectly to make up a little piece of gastronomical heaven.

The Katsu Chicken - I don't like mushrooms usually, but as I get older I find myself not minding them so much.  And I sometimes find myself loving a dish that is loaded with mushrooms.  This Katsu Chicken is near the top of that list.  It was the last thing that we ate and despite me being as full as I could be, I easily and happily stuffed the rest of this dish down my gullet.  I'm tellin ya, it's SOOOO GOOD.  This creamy mushroom gravy sauce poured over a fried chicken cutlet (I guess it was kind of a cutlet).  The sauce reminded me of what you would get on chicken marsala.  It was off the chain good.

Pork Ramen - The pork ramen was super delicious and super rich.  I would actually say that it holds its own with the top ramen places in vegas and it could be argued that it's even better.  I was hugely impressed.  I'm having a little trouble thinking of all the good things about it, but please don't let that lead you to believe that it's not way up there with the other aforementioned items because it is.

The other items that we ordered were the New York Strip and a side of the Pomme Puree (I think that's what it was called).  They were both delicious, 5/5 for sure, but they aren't standing out in my memory as much as the others, so take that how you will.

And then they wheeled out the star of the show: the 5 Spice RotisserieDuck. They wheel it out on a cart because the chef combines all the 5 spices into the dish right at your table.

We came to this place because we heard they have really good ramen, so we had to come give it a try. They only have the pork ramen ($17) and vegetarian ramen that is not on the menu.

The pork broth was light in flavor, not too heavy. The pork was so juicy and tender that it almost melts in your mouth! It also comes with an egg, bean sprouts, green onions and dried seaweed. If you want to add spicy, they charge $1 for a small thing of chili oil, which isn't worth it in my opinion. Most places give it for free and the chili oil wasn't even spicy!

OH and we also tried their pork buns, also delicious! It comes with their homemade ssam sauce, which is almost a twist between Korean red pepper paste and hoisin sauce, kind of tangy, sweet, and spicy (spicier than the chili oil for sure).

We were able to watch the chefs doing their magic in the kitchen-they kept it fun and casual, but at the same time, extremely efficient and productive. That is always a good indication of a great restaurant!

The food definitely lived up to the hype. The ingredients were simple, but the layers of flavors were massive. 

My boyfriend's favorite was the shiitake bun-just enough firmness of the shiitake grilled to perfection that captured its flavor and juiciness. Mine is the Mussels and the chickpea ramen. The mussels were served with smoked Bacon bits and I would never thought of smokiness and mussels would go so well together!

I've always wanted to try Momofuku and finally had a chance when my husband and I threw our joint-bachelor/bachelorette party out in Vegas.  For our ""fancy"" meal, we picked Momofuku  because they were awesome to let us reserve our large party via OpenTable without having to put down our credit card number (I don't know what that annoys me...).

Anyway, since we had a party of 18, the server was really awesome in recommending an on-the-fly prefix menu for our table.  Supposedly, we got the best of Momofuku for $70/person.  

I'll just go ahead and tell you my favorite: crispy chicken with caviar.  That chicken was crispy on the outside and salted just right.  The meat itself was tender and juicy.  The only complaint I had was that this dish came out towards the end when I was stuffed with all the other dishes that came before it.  The caviar definitely gave it a nice touch.

The pork belly bun was good, but not worth the price point of $7 per bun. I understand that Momofuku is inside The Cosmo and on the Strip of Vegas, but this the type of place I'll visit once and remove from my bookmarks. 
The pork belly ramen broth was missing something. I've had my fair share of ramen from restaurants throughout NorCal and SoCal, but didn't find anything special about Momofuku's. We ordered an extra egg, which came on the side - but we did not receive an egg in the actual bowl the ramen came in. I had to flag down our waiter to ask for the egg. After splitting the ramen into two bowls, we had a little bit leftover in the original bowl. A different waiter asked if we were finished and if he could take it, but didn't ask to take the empty plates from the buns we finished. We thought this was odd.  
I was so excited to try Momofuku, especially after watching all the Ugly Delicious episodes. 3 stars for the service, ambiance, and decent food.",zOjU9hOKRKch73q22tDDhA,0,0,3,N9_r6vMsKEzBR3VhQ_k4Bw

Waited ages for one of Chang's places to show up on the west coast and finally! We were seated right away at the bar both times (best place to sit). Boyfriend had beet salad and vegetarian ramen - both were tasty, and the crispy chickpeas in the ramen were fun! I had the pork ramen of course, and it was so good I almost cried. Literally had to stop and cover my face for a moment. Noodles were chewy, broth was rich, egg coated everything, lovely.

The line cooks kept passing us extra bits of things they were working on, all of them delicious - especially the braised pork omfg.

Came back two nights later to try the same ramen and make sure I hadn't just been overwhelmed with delight at finally getting to see Momofuku; it was just as good the second time. Yes, salty. It's supposed to be. I drank everything in the bowl.

Price aside, I ordered the chicken katsu.  It was ok, but I definitely struggled to see why it cost 34 dollars.  It didn't even include rice, which was an extra four dollars for a bowl.  The portion size was fairly large though.  

I also ordered the pork bun, which was also ok, but not amazing.  The pork was tender, but a little dry.  The chilli sauce they give you to go with your buns was pretty interesting though.  It almost tasted similar to those mexican chili candies you used to get in grade school.  

I then ordered two bowls of ramen, which was worth coming for.  I had the pork ramen and the chickpea ramen.  The pork ramen was great, but I was surprised at how much I liked the chickpea ramen.

On a recent trip to Sin City, I had the opportunity to dine at MLV for lunch.  This was one meal I was looking forward to after hearing about this eatery on social media, as well as from various friends and my brother.  I also have to be honest to say we chose lunch over dinner since it was more affordable.

NOTE:
I made a reservation via OpenTable for 1130am, but we soon discovered that was unnecessary as the restaurant (which opened at 11am) wasn't overly crowded.

LOCATION / SETTING:
2nd level of the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas.  Follow the signage.  Seating areas include a lounge area, the bar, and the main restaurant floor.  The smiling hostess sat us at a table which had a view of the bustling kitchen area.

FOOD:
After perusing the menu, we decided on starters of the oysters and orders of the pork and shrimp buns.  My brother and I each had an order of the pork ramen, while my mom continued her seafood regimen and chose the salmon sandwich.  

The oysters were ok.  We ordered a half dozen to share.  I was expecting them to be larger, but well that's alright.  The pork and shrimp buns were generous portions, but pricing was a wee bit much IMHO at $7/each.  Our unanimous favorite was the shrimp bun.  

Before the main courses were served, one of the staff came by with smaller bowls so we could all share the ramen.  My brother and I gave each other quizzical looks, and polite declined the offer, much to the surprise of the server.  As it turns out, we should have listened to him.  The ramen bowls look a bit deceiving since one could not imagine that it holds such a large quantity of food.  The ramen portion is extremely generous as it contains not only vegetables and a poached egg, but also pork belly AND shoulder.  Needless to say, my brother and I could not fathom finishing such a filling portion and were defeated in the end by our respective ramen bowls.  My mom, on the other hand, enjoyed her salmon sandwich immensely and finished it entirely.

SERVICE:
Extremely efficient.  Our server was a very friendly and knowledgeable young lady.  With this being our first visit to MLV, she made some recommendations and patiently answered our menu questions.  She and other staff periodically checked on us throughout the meal, and we appreciated her efficiency and reliability.

BOTTOM LINE:
A very filling meal at MLV.  Decent food portions, though the pricing for individual buns is questionable.  Thanks to the servers for providing exceptional customer service.  Lastly, if the staff recommend sharing a dish, please do take their advice!",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,17,17,4,U98Qib0yB4G0ELPpSklMmg

2025442,2017-04-27,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I've gone to my fair share of Momofuku restaurants and I think there is a wrong way and a right way to approach this place.  If you view the restaurant as simply an ""asian restaurant"" - I think that's the wrong way.  Momofuku is famous, I think, because it masters cultural complexity when it comes to food and then each restaurant bears the signature of the head chef and thematic context of the restaurant. Momofuku Nishi and Momofuku Ko are more like cousins then they are brothers, related but different in kind and style. Momofuku Las Vegas takes some of all the different family members and brings them together to Las Vegas. As a result, patrons that come to Las Vegas have the chance to partially experience the variances, spanning from Sydney, Australia to Toronto, Canada to it's birthplace of New York City. To understand that - is the first step in appreciating what this Momofuku has to offer. The second best thing about Momofuku Las Vegas is that it is the only place in Las Vegas (that I know of) that offers natural wine.  If you aren't familiar with natural wine, ask the sommelier and they'll likely give you a crash course on this distinct and amazing shift in the wine industry and has been spreading globally.  Before I knew what natural wine was, I tasted it and realized,  ""Yup. That's it. Not going back.""  

Third - come in a group and eat family style. 

The ideal experience for me at Momofuku Las Vegas is in a large group. I'd call in advance and get the tables overlooking the view of the strip. The restaurant has this 1920's Hong Kong vibe, so I enjoy dressing up and funky.  The large group enables you to eat the food family style, which will maximize your opportunity to taste the spectrum that the menu offers.  That being said, they offer quicker cheaper dishes if you come in alone. If you come in a group and don't do it family style - you're an idiot.  Also, take a moment and taste the cocktails offered or ask the somm about their wines and choose a good bottle. If you come in and order a vodka soda, you're an idiot. Lastly, if you can afford it - get the caviar. 

I love this place - from the music to the quality of staff to the amazing artwork by David Choe to the heated toilets and bedet. 

In sum,  if you're not an amateur when u come in, it's definitely the best place on the strip.",e6NkOycHNBQTw0Oukj-10A,0,3,5,uWVQcolVySVzthKI11zZLw

Fast forward a little over a month: I CAME BACK. 

Boom. That, my friends, is really all you need to know. I came back for more. I came back after having tried everything on my ""must order"" list. Why does this matter? It matters because I very rarely make a return visit to ""big name"" venues. There are too many other places to experience to make return visits to places where I've seen, tried, and tasted. 

So, why did I come back?

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

FOOD. 

I'll be honest. I came in wanting, deep down inside, to walk out hating the food. I wanted my experience to be a living testament to the idea that overrated food is running rampant and that no one's stomach would ever be satisfied by chasing menu items as seen on the gram. That said, even on day two, I had no complaints. The food was all prepared well; good temperature, deep flavors, and balanced textures. The pork ramen, while not the best ramen I've ever had (hey, I have my biases), was still worthy of the notoriety. The broth was clean, clear, and very tasty and the egg was made for yolk porn. On the second visit, I switched up and ordered the chicken noodle soup because it had me at chicken schmaltz. When I was a kid, my family used to drive to Torrance, to a small strip mall to have chicken mami soup (shout out to my fellow pinoys). The Momofuku soup stirred up memories of that soup. Clear, richly chicken-y broth paired with the perfect choice noodle topped with moist chunks of chicken. 

Baos are all great. And I typically hate baos. I grew up eating Filipino siopao and was often guilty of digging the filling out of the overly dense bread. The baos are all beautifully steamed and pillowy. All 4 options offer a perfect mix of all flavors and textures in each bite. The pork belly left nothing to be desired, but the shrimp was a surprise treat. I suggest these as top two choices, followed by the karaage and the mushroom. 

However, the standout dish, by far, is the chicken katsu. I know the pie at the neighboring Milk Bar bears crack in its name, but the crack is clearly actually in the katsu gravy. On the first visit, we ordered the entree and split it amongst a party of 4. One the second visit, the katsu was also offered in a bowl presentation on a bed of rice with bok choy and thinly sliced pickled cucumber. I was assured that the gravy remained the same. Personally, I preferred the bowl option because adding a bowl of rice for $4 to the entree crosses some moral lines for me (and tempts me to bring a bag of rice in my purse). 

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

SERVICE

The service was spotty on the first visit, but this was to be expected. I am happy to report that none of the hiccups experienced a month ago were even remotely existent this week. In fact, I was continually ""freaked out"" by how on top of things the staff were. There was one point where I took the last bite of a bao, turned to the right to say something to my husband, looked up and went, ""where'd the steamer basket go?!"". My water glass was never empty but I never really remember seeing anyone come to fill it. Unspoken service is very apparent here as I don't recall ever having to ask for anything other than for the server to take my credit card while our friends were in the restroom so we could cover the tab. 

~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

ATMOSPHERE

Restaurant has a great view, great light (ahem - very instaworthy), and great location. 

Oh, be sure to use the restroom. Be sure everyone in your party uses the restroom.

Pricewise - not Chinatown. I have a tendency to under value Asian food because of the ""Chinatown pricing"" argument but, given the service, atmosphere, and well executed plates, I've been forced to reconsider my usual cheap tendencies regarding this type of food. 

What's more: I'll probably be back. That's right, for a third time. 





Last bits that I forgot to mention:

- cereal milk ice cream with chocolate chips; you're welcome

- if you order the branzino and the katsu, taste the branzino first (it's delicious but, since it's light, you won't like it after taking a bite of the crack-infused katsu gravy) 

- enjoyed the cocktail with calamansi juice (tasted fresh and not bottled) 

- you can order most of the milk bar items for dessert served to your table (except cakes and shakes and other things)

- thumbs all the way up for reservations on opentable 

- private dining room looks awesome 

- large format dinner options are available and tempting  

- lunch through 2:30pm (no raw items at lunch)

- limited offering 2:30pm - 5:00pm 

- full service dinner at 5:00pm",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,5,2,5,otr7GogaAuqkoJ4e4tJuZA

Had lunch here on a tuesday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all. Service was very attentive. The lovely waitress even allowed some samples of sake since I am a total noob.

I found them to be not spicy, but my husband claims one of them was actually spicy and caused him to tear up (he might be on the low end of spice tolerability scale though...). 

I would say the vegetarian options are very yummy. I actually enjoyed the shiitake bun more than the pork bun. We shared the chickpea ramen with poached egg-- very flavorful! I was not a fan of the crunchy chickpeas but only because it slowed me down in slurping everything else. As a meat-eater, I was surprised at how delicious this ramen was.

Pork Ramen - pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg- the ramen was average at best. The broth lacked depth in flavor and the noodles were also just meh. I expected more from the ramen just because I know Momofuku has a ramen/noodle restaurant in New York. 

Hamachi sashimi- The Hamachi tasted fresh and combined with the sauce it was a pretty good dish. 

Pork belly bun- comes with hoisin, scallion, cucumber. The pork belly was tender and had good flavor to it. 1 order only comes with 1. 

Shrimp bun- comes with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, iceberg. I actually liked this one more than the pork belly. The shrimp was fried perfectly.",7xgCxQ0tBhVpKLWSXZ_tzQ,2,1,3,6uZN0uhZrjMAwgRITn9cHQ
2046716,2018-03-29,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"A few things to note before reading this review:
1) I hardly ever leave restaurants reviews because I typically don't care enough to spend the time or energy
2) I am obsessed with food
3) I am extremely picky and have numerous food allergies/restrictions (mostly raw vegan, gluten free, severe lactose intolerance)

Momofoku's food and dining experience is 112% the best I've had in the last year. As a huge fan of David Chang and his food philosophy, I had high expectations--Momofoku exceeded them. 

As I mentioned above, I'm vegan with many food allergies. Although the menu isn't necessarily known for being gluten free or vegan, the kitchen was extremely accommodating and even created 2 specialty dishes, one of which is without a shadow of a doubt the best thing I've eaten in a VERY long time. 

As someone who's worked as a server, I rarely approach a dining experience with a critical eye when it comes to service, but Momofoku's hospitality is impossible NOT to mention. From the hostess stand to the multiple servers who took care of us throughout the night, I truly felt right at home--a difficult feat in a place as over-the-top and trashy as Vegas.

One server in particular, Mags, was incredible. As I mentioned, I try not to be too critical when I eat out (because I know from experience how challenging it is to be a waiter,) but I also know amazing service when I see it. Mags is definitely top 5 waiters I've ever had the pleasure of dining with. 

Thank you all for an incredible experience. You truly made our trip very special and one we'll never forget!",Fd_nEAJb1XacEZZrrkgYZg,2,2,5,Cgaa5nq7lKRbzMNh080X9g

The hostess was super nice about it and offered us seating us in the bar area. The waitress was super informative about the menu, knowing all the ingredients which was much appreciated by diners in our group with food allergies. I ordered the scallion ginger noodles ($17) which the server informed me was vegan. Really yummy! For a vegetarian dish (I'm not vegetarian) the noodles were surprisingly very flavorful  I would definitely order again. One of my companions got the cold chili noodles which I took a bite of--also very tasty but my preference was the ginger noodles I had ordered for myself.

Negatives-- sadly, are many. Pork belly bun wasn't bad, but that's about 5 levels removed from how good the original can get in New York. Thai cold noodle was heavy, would've been much better if it was lighter, and the tonkotsu ramen was way too salty.

Portions are very decent, great for sharing so you can taste more items!
The big eye tuna with shaved foie gras was amazing. This is one of their signature dishes. Buns were very tasteful. The cucumber and almonds salad was one of my favorite picks.
Then the amazing roasted chicken, along with... fried bones (yes, fried bones, I mean it!). At first I thought it was a joke, but it really comes with a side of fried bones, that you can actually eat, and even if I was pretty skeptical, well I had to admit this was pretty good.

If you have a craving for ramen and you do not find them on the dinner or late night menu... no worries, just ask the server for their ramen menu and they'll be more than happy to prepare some for you and your friends/guests.

Pork Ramen with pork belly and shoulder, slow poached egg, scallions and seaweed was surprisingly good and satisfying. I like it when chefs are generous with a thick slice of pork belly and other goodies. The desserts, however, were sub-par. Both birthday cake and pumpkin cake were too sweet and lack flavors.

I tried the pork belly bun and the chicken karaage bun, both were quite tasty, but if I were to pick one to try again, I would go with the pork belly.  Pork is melt in your mouth tender and the pickled cucumbers accompanies it perfectly.

The pork ramen was the highlight of the meal.  A tasty and not too heavy broth, toothsome noodles and delicious toppings, everything one can ask of a bowl of ramen.   I also tried the chilled spicy noodles, which was also really good.  A good balance of generously sauced cold noodles under a bed of  warm crispy sichuan sausage and herbaceous fresh basil. 

Finished the meal with the signature ""Crack Pie"" and it was really good! Dense and moist and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  The great thing about everything on the dessert menu was that it was the same price inside the restaurant as the Milk Bar dessert stand right next door! No up charge for the table service! So try the cereal milk soft serve and crack pie desserts and feel at ease knowing you are paying the same price as everyone outside at the much more casual Milk Bar.

This egg, chilled creamy yolk topped with smoked salmon roe and crispy rice - a delectable multi-textured couple of bites.  Stop, do not pass go, without inhaling some of these.

1. Pork ramen: the noodles are what make this dish, they are aldente/chewy and have a light flavor.  For ramen lovers! It also comes with bean sprouts and pork as part of the toppings.  A lot of times they offer a sweet and spicy momofuku ramen sauce, add for extra zing
2. Chicken karaage and pork steamed buns: for someone who doesn't love steamed buns sandwiches I did enjoy these.  I removed the red onions.  I love the crunch and flavor of the karaage!  
3. Cocktails: johnnys margarita is tasty and the seven spice sour with shichimi is worth trying for something different 
4. Ginger scallion noodles: you gotta love the taste of pickled mushrooms, onions, and wakame seaweed.  Again the ramen noodles make the dish!  Note this is a brothless ""ramen"" dish

Service
1. Water or bottled, they keep it coming 
2. Wait time is long and you usually end up sitting at the bar.
3. Can take a while for food

Ambiance 
1. Inside Cosmopolitan Vegas: very upscale like a New York ramen house.
2. Try to sit where there is a window so you can take in the scenery and the strip
3. Fairly pricey for ramen, but worth trying once since there is only this one and the NY location
4. Credit cards accepted 
5. Associated with milkbar by Christina Tosi

MoJo
1. It's an experience.  I'd say a combination of trying a concept from NY is what puts it on the map
2. Ramen is what they are known for but they have some high priced items like wagyu beef",TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg,1,0,4,SWlVg5XWAj8FSJdMndqopw

Even though they're $7 each, it is so worth it to have one...or two. The pork ramen was delicious as well. The broth had this great smoky flavor to it that I really enjoyed.

The only thing I would have liked was for the broth to be a bit more temperature hot. I added on some bok choy that might have brought the temperature down a bit, but the soup starting out a bit hotter would make it all that much more tasty in my opinion.

Especially when you can find inexpensive, delicious Asian food just down the street on Spring Mtn (Las Vegas' Chinatown). I must say though, I'm a fan of David Chang's new spot on The Strip.

If you love subtle, inquisitive flavors, this place is for you. Exemplary of this are the Beets and the Ginger Scallion Noodles. As you eat the beets, there's this hint of spiciness from the XO sauce opposite the citrus mandarins. The ginger scallion noodles were surprisingly refreshing and a great compliment to the other dishes with richer flavors. The food is delicious, but find it hard to justify an $18 bowl of ramen; however, it is flavorful & has a lighter broth than traditional tonkotsu ramen, w/ subtle tastes of kahlua pork.

MUST ORDER: CRACK PIE - trust me on this. It's not expensive and it's grub.

The majority of the 4 stars is attributed to their service staff - they make you feel at home and at ease while giving you that impeccable service.

Tips:
* Expect to spend a lot. Yes, their prices seem reasonable but they're small portions. And we're on The Strip at Cosmo.

* Make sure to order dessert - CRACK PIE.

* If you can afford it w/ your group, order the Spicy Cod & Chili Donabae. It's $248, but it's huge and delicious if you like spicy food. Lots and lots of cod too.

* Sometimes Chef David Chang is in the restaurant. We were lucky he was in when we went. Don't be shy to ask your server for a selfie w/ David Chang.

* If you want a sweet snack and don't want to eat at the restaurant, check out Momofuku Milk Bar next door. You can order their crack pie and their various soft serves which are delicious.",RDtoAKtFjv632JvVtguMZw,1,0,4,vjRsmbEt3g6gTkr9FMGoGA

2249431,2018-05-11,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Ok, here's a useful tip right out the gate for what is likely to be a rambling, gushing review.  

Except for the small plates and buns, everything else here is huge, so plan your dining experience strategically!  I personally would recommend the Bo Ssam.  This is a wedding cake sized hunk of slow-cooked barbecue, a pork shoulder that is barely retaining its corporeal form when it makes its way onto the table.  This arrives with a whole stable of accompaniments, add a side of white steamed rice and you're cooking with gas!  You take the pork shoulder apart, mixing it in the drippings, wrap in lettuce, add Ssam sauce, kimchi, and wait for your eyes to roll back into your head.  They're not kidding about the party that this serves, so don't make any additional allowances for how much you can eat. You can always order more if it turns out that you do have the gastric fundus of a bull elephant.

The menu here is full of the playful, thoughtful food epiphanies that Chef Chang has had and expounded on over the years. It seems to me that the menu is crafted to play on flavor and the food memories associated with those flavors.  Take for example one of my favorite menu items, the cucumber salad.  This is chunks of kyuri tossed in a dressing that usually accompanies sea cucumber or jellyfish on a traditional Chinese restaurant ""cold plate"".  Usually the opening salvo in a traditional celebratory Chinese restaurant dinner like at a wedding or anniversary. So for me, this was both a little upsetting but also euphoria-inducing when my conscious brain finally wrested control from my reptilian mid-brain and I realized that this was cucumber and not sea cucumber.   An apparently simple dish that hid a wealth of thinking about food, an encyclopedic flavor vocabulary, and mad culinary skills.  I particularly appreciated the restraint in preparing a simple ingredient without going overboard to dress it up.

That same principle of just highlighting what nature has already made very good to eat and perfectly enjoyable permeates the entire menu.  I continue to be in awe of that kind of discipline, thoughtfulness, and love.  I absolutely loved it here and I hope you give Momofuku Las Vegas the time and attention that it deserves to truly understand and appreciate every nuance and suggestion, of which there is an abundance.",2arW6KJ-BAoAfNrYC7zaPA,3,2,5,UAyLcI5qSiIOvk4INnQMzw

- chicken karaage Bao:  nice breading, but not as memorable as the pork belly 4/5
- pork ramen:  good thing we read the Yelp reviews to expect a lighter broth than what we prefer for ramen.  The egg helped give some richness to the broth and set off the strong shio flavor.  There's nothing wrong with this ramen but I wouldn't order it again 3.5/5

Service was professional, and we would be open to visiting again for dinner.  I've been to three of the NY Momofuku restaurants and hope they add more to the lunch options here.",gipgMGX89Jp0jLqJ-y4rhg,2,1,4,6YeKNLEV2trNj0R1BCT1Fw

Next we got their pork buns ($14 ) perfect small bite but did not have much inside aside from the pork slice. Another pricey bite at $7 a bun. We got their oysters ($26) which was fresh but nothing out of this world. Their prime New York steak ($62) was really good. They had a light and flavorful sauce over their perfectly cooked steak. Had a good amount of steak on the plate so money well spent. The last dish that came was the pork ramen($18) I would not order this again. It was very bland and barely any pork.

Loved the pork belly buns even though they were a bit steep for $7 each. The pork was thick and juicy and was accompanied by a delightful sauce.

The ramen wasn't bad but I've definitely had better at a more reasonable price. They used the same pork belly and had no extras that ramen lovers are typically used to.

We wanted to try something different, so we had the fried chicken and caviar. The combination was delishhhh! The slice up the chicken and build the first taco/wrap for you. It came with sauce, a little bit of sliced cabbage, and crispy skin!

Last but not least, crack pie really is crack pie. Buttery and sweet... and pairs perfectly with their milk ice cream.

- shishito peppers: can't go wrong with these
- crab deviled eggs: have a strong smokey flavor

Buns

Chilled spicy noodles: spicy so careful. Filled with flavor and surprisingly very good.

Pork Ramen - Don't let them fool you, as they don't put it on the dinner menu, but you can order it any time. This was an incredible ramen, and likely the best I've ever had. My only pet peeve is that they don't put it on the menu because they try to push people to the higher priced dishes.

She claims that the sauce indeed has vinegar and it's supposed to taste this way. So I can  accept this even though I'm more convinced that it accidentally has vinegar or was spoiled. 

I would have been satisfied with this however it feels like a slap in the face that she hopes we come back and she will assist me in making a reservation. -_- we know what this means.... She's asking me to come back, waste my money on an overpriced dinner, know that it's my table and tell her staff to treat me a little better so I can fix my review. 

I may give this another chance in a very distant future but I'm more hopeful to have a better dining experience when I try monofuku NYC.

Luckily for me, they opened a location in Las Vegas and my friend made us reservations this past weekend. 

Momofuku is located on the 2nd floor of the East Tower at the Cosmopolitan (around the corner from Marquee and Egg Slut). Got there at 5:30 and it was a little unorganized. There were groups of people scattered infront of the host table and I wasn't sure if there was an actual line. I was able to get to the front after asking several people if they were waiting to check in. From there it was smooth sailing.

We got seated right away and the staff was really friendly. My friend who made reservations put down it was for a birthday and the staff greeted me happy birthday (it really was my birthday weekend). They were really nice. 

Unfortunately for me and a couple of my friends we ate only a couple of hours before coming here so we were still stuffed. We ended up sharing a couple of of the baos (chicken karaage and pork). Both were really good, I actually liked the chicken more though. I ended up ordering the pork ramen. That was really good, and despite being full, I forced myself to finish it because I knew I'd regret it. I did regret not trying the smothered chicken katsu. Per my friend ""it's really good."" Luckily for us we were also able to try the chive pancake, and that was delish. It's really basic but it was really good. 

For dessert, we all ordered a soft serve (all come from Milk Bar next door). I ordered a cereal milk and crack pie swirl with crunch. That was really delicious. It was not overly sweet or anything and the serving was perfect. It was so cute!! I tried my friend's fruity pebble soft serve, and I'm not even a huge fruity pebble fan but that was amazing. I would definitely order that next time! And surprisingly, they brought out a few birthday cake truffles with a candle on it for my birthday. It was really unexpected and sweet of them. I know they probably do it for everyone on their birthday but I thought it was really nice. The birthday truffles were heaven and even better when you mix it with your soft serve. 

Depending what you order this place can be pricey but you're in Vegas! Splurge a little and definitely try out Momofuku. If not, at least hit up Milk Bar next door!",tlWur9j2k5gpmuY91D5t6Q,4,2,4,ngmKn0uYme7OOdQ13rGCsg

The service was great, the restaurant is larger than what you can see up front,  the chicken karaange bun was SO good (5/5). Reminiscent of a delicious and well-balanced chicken sandwich. I wasn't to hungry so I ordered the ""wedgeless wedge salad"". It consisted of romaine lettuce, thinly sliced radishes & apple, bacon ranch dressing, and 3 shrimp that were sliced in half.

For the price I expected more (especially more than a few cold shrimp sliced in half. Bleh. I couldn't even eat them).

It comes at no surprise as this is acclaimed chef David Chang's first west coast implant of his popular Momofuku restaurants located in NYC, DC, Toronto and Sydney.
When we arrived early for our reservations, they gave us no fuss. We were seated moments later and our server Omar was friendly and knowledgeable in regards to the menu. He also assisted us with drink orders promptly.  The manager even stopped by to say hello, which was a nice touch. 
We were presented with some smoked salt & lime shishito peppers and the citrus cured fluke crudo with pickled plum and nori, which were both amazing. 
The crudo really shined with bright acidity from the lime and it exhibited a soft, supple mouthfeel. A pleasant start to our culinary adventure ahead.
Next up were the highly anticipated noodle dishes, which included the house favorite, pork ramen and chilled spicy noodles with pork.
Omg, the noodles for both dishes were cooked perfectly with an irresistibly chewy mouthfeel and had the ""eyes rolling behind my head"" sort of feeling.  Btw, that's a good thing, a really good thing! 
Coupled with an irresistibly flavorful broth and beautifully fatty pork belly, the ramen dish was a winner in every sense of the word and is deserving of its current fame. The chilled noodles with Sichuan sausage, Thai basil and candied cashews were no also ran imo. All the components worked wonderfully in this dish. From the crunchy textures of the cashews to the deep permeating flavors coursing through each and every strand of bright emerald green noodle, it had me pining for seconds. Be warned, however it is indeed spicy, but nothing you can't handle, right? ;)
For dessert we enjoyed the famous crack pie with some cake truffles on the side. Both desserts were sheer bliss but undoubtedly cranked my blood glucose levels way up! 
That being said, we high tailed it over to neighboring Milk Bar for even more sweets. Hey, I'm in Vegas, this city is the definition of decadence, right? So when in Rome...but that's another review altogether. 
Overall, i had a fantastic dining experience here and If our lunch experience was any indication of the restaurant's entire menu, I have no doubt in my mind I will return soon. From quick and friendly service to clever twists on Asian style comfort classics, this is a stop you don't want to miss when strolling through sin city.

I literally tried a third of the menu, and it was all STUPID good. Started off with a juicy jem of a cocktail featuring whiskey, pineapple juice, and a black cherry. Forgot the name but would totally reorder! 

Worth the splurge:
BIGEYE TUNA - summery poke for the gods. On first bite, decadent creamy flakes of foie gras melt on the tongue, into crisp refreshing watermelon cubes and taste the delicate tender tuna. 

BENTON's Country HAM. Hubs is a bit of a jamon snob after Barcelona but he approved of these savory rich slices. Red eye mayo is a dead ringer for Haagen Dazs coffee ice cream. Slap em both on soft sourdough and we have a winner.

KARAAGE BUN. David Chang fries chicken reeeeeally well among other things. The pork belly and shiitake buns lean sweet. This and the shrimp bun are savory. This will be my default bun from now on cause I lurve salty vs. sweet.

MARKET GREENS. Order this to appease one's conscience and to feel healthy. Perfectly balanced complexity of flavors with some crunchy rice sprinkled on top. What's not to love?

Pass: 
Rotisserie chicken & fried bones. Sweet chilli glaze and coconut slaw did not do much for me. This same flavor profile can be found at a local Thai resto for much less.

Previous review:
A delicious taste of NYC in LV! I was lucky to nab last min res Fri 7:30pm for 10ppl. The space has a casual/urban feel due to a giant mural by graffiti artist, David Choe. 

LARGE FORMAT BOSSAM- tender, juicy, fall-off-the-bone. Bossam is Korean pork dish traditionally wrapped w lettuce and topped w raw oyster, pickled kimchi, and salted shrimp. David Chang's rendition kicks it up a notch, slow roasting pork shoulder for 5hrs and changing the sauces to pickled garlic, hoisin, and hot sauce (mild by Korean standards)! The raw oysters were fresh, creamy and a hearty medium size. We asked for extra bibb lettuce, kimchi, and sauces. The presentation could improve by splitting into 2-3 settings for us since we were seated at a long rectangular table, not a lazy susan circle. It's tough passing around a heavy giant bowl of pork from one end to the other while stuffing one's face!

Not memorable but still devoured without a bite left:
Smoked pork chop
Asparagus
Chicken katsu looks basic now NO mushroom gravy :*( 

Unexpected: 
Chickpea ramen is creamy
Pork ramen broth is clear. enjoyed both but price is steep for ramen. enough to share
Creamy chilled spicy noodles were yummier than the ginger scallion noodles. 

Notes to self for future visits: 
Wear buffet pants/muumuu.
A half order of large format entrees suffices if ordering additional menu items.
Skip the eggplant and oysters momofuku. Toppings mask the oyster flavor I personally enjoy, and also were missing kimchi, spinach, or bacon notes.",UwmtWzBdbi4AAJiuBrXrQA,3,2,5,D-kJQe03BtTsdzcpAGeDyQ

The food was delicious.  The ramen had a soft poached egg which was different.  I preferred the regular soft boiled egg because once it popped, it just made the broth too eggy.  But the broth tasted smoky and good without the egg.  The pork belly was thick and tasty.  The lamb ribs went well with the perfect amount of yogurt sauce and the cilantro.  The flavors were balanced and it wasn't too spicy.  The ribs were a bit fatty but which made them moist.  I would order them again.

After trying out Momofuku CCDC in DC just last month, I checked out Momofuku Vegas and equally had an excellent time. This was not surprising since I loved CCDC so much.

Right from the moment, I stepped in service was phenomenal. I have to give props to General Manager Ryan and his crew for the excellent service. Our server Gregory gave a good description of the different plates of the menu and made recommendations based off his favorites. 

Our meal started here with sudden small plates. We tried the shishito peppers, spicy cucumbers and crudite plate. If you like spicy, the spicy cucumbers is good for you. The shishito peppers aren't all spicy but there maybe one or two in there that will shock your tastebuds ;). Lastly, the crudite plate is good for sharing.

Another plate that was good for sharing was their katsu chicken. It's a good crispy chicken plate and the bulldog sauce accompanying it is excellent.  

My other favorite shared plate was their Spring Vegetable Rice Cakes! I've always been a fan of rice cakes and they make an excellent rice cakes dish here! 

We also split their chickpea ramen and their pork ramen. The pork ramen was my preference though I did think the chickpea one was something interesting and unique.

My absolute favorite however at Momofuku are their buns. We tried one of each of the buns they offered; their pork belly, shrimp, shiitake and chicken karaage. Each was delicious but the chicken karaage was my favorite! The karaage is so crispy and tender.

I absolutely loved my visit to Momofuku Vegas. Every thing was excellent from the service to the food!",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,11,10,5,qaPR5UXRNWjNe-gZbcAg4w

Now that I have tried it, I felt more like..""ok...been there, done that""...and not like...""yea! I gotta go there again."" The experience felt definitely under my expectations..especially when looking at it from the food vs price perspective.

I felt pretty much almost every dish was overpriced. I definitely regretted ordering the soft boiled eggs with salmon roes ($9)...which essentially were literally 2 eggs with salmon roes and light sprinkle of rice crispy and a leaf or two of sprouts on it. Taste wise..not wasn't anything memorable. The buns (chicken karaage and pork belly) that we tried though were quite good..they were really small though...and while I get that the pork belly buns were one of the highlights...charging $6-$7 each is a little ridiculous...I guess it's a result of being in Las Vegas and a signature dish a brand name chef. We also tried the pork belly ramen..and while I get that it's David Chang's interpretation of ramen (made with mushroom based broth?) which differed from traditional ramen, the taste was ok..just wasn't anything memorable...esp given a just ok portion and a price point of $18.

Overall, I think I'm glad I tried it...but I will probably not go there again next time unless someone else in my group wanted to try it. Given the high price point and just ok..not so much memorable taste..and the fact that Las Vegas offers so many great dining options...I would probably choose to go elsewhere next time instead.",6yw_4m8IBhdPeAvQNbFMDw,5,1,3,eJc0qdDBJynOQqlLcoAjwg

If you don't know who David Chang is by now and need to research him, you probably won't appreciate the food at Momofuku as much as you should. He's not an infallible chef by any means, but he definitely is past the point of needing to be researched and reviewed.

I came in about an hour before kitchen closed on a Saturday night to order some buns to go. Erick the Bartender took care of me. Super cordial and talked story with me to keep me company while I waited for my food to come out. We had a hiccup with my order somehow and they said we needed to re-do it? no idea what happened, but i had plenty of time to spare so i said bring it out whenever. the very kind Erick the Bartender felt bad and ordered a comped cucumber salad, even though i said it was completely unnecessary. when the food was finally brought out by a Mustached Gentleman, I found out they tried to make it up to me and essentially doubled my order, along with a comped side. all good food aside, this Momofuku location sure knows how to treat their customers. i assured them it was an unnecessary gesture, but they wanted to make their small wrong right. very sweet.

We decided to finally try the famous David Chang's Momofuku. The ambience was very hipster and modern, as you would expect. We were seated immediately without a reservation. 

We ordered:
CHILLED SPICY NOODLES (4.5/5): This was a very well done dish! The sauce was reminiscent of pesto, but not quite that. The sausages were hot, but the noodles themselves were cold. The candied cashews added a sweet kick to each bite. Definitely a great way to start off your meal.

HOZON RICE CAKES (5/5): This was absolutely stellar. It was basically fried Korean deokkboki in a mushroomy sauce. The rice cakes had a crispy outer layer and a chewy inner layer - absolutely divine. The sauce was so fragrant. It reminded me of carbonara and mushroom sauce combined, but did not taste heavy or creamy. This dish was a perfect blend of Korean and Italian flavors. An absolute must order.

WILD ALASKAN KING SALMON (4/5): This whopping dish was $50!! Definitely not worth the price, but the taste and preparation was phenomenal. The dish it really quite simple - it is just a filet of salmon smoked on cedarwood with no garnishes. The filet flaked beautifully and had a delicious smokey taste. 

WAGYU TRI-TIP (4/5): This dish was very simple. It was just the steak + some sunchoke on the side. The sunchoke was somehow ridiculously delicious, considering its just...sunchoke. In fact, I may have loved it more than the steak itself. Not that the tri-tip was anything short of delicious. It was so so soft - almost a prime rib or filet mignon quality. Delicious.

BUCATINI (5/5): This was an absolute gorgeous blend of Asian and Italian flavors. The bucatini noodles were cooked al dente, so it had a great chew to it. But what wowed me most was the sauce. The sauce was not heavy - it tasted like a blend of cacio de pepe/salted egg yolk. Nothing like I've ever tasted before.

I think someone was watching us as we were eating. The moment we finished one dish, another was brought to our table. Great, attentive service, and awesome atmosphere. 

Ok note though: they charged us $1 each for our water, which confused me. But I guess it's Vegas. 

Anyways, I'm so glad I was able to finally dine at one of David Chang's establishments. This restaurant serves absolutely artful dishes, and the price tag shows.",6ORr2W7IOEVZuO3jqX5O0w,2,1,4,ZToRV1r30_CKMN_9PN09LA

Uni hashbrown - Smooth and crispy mesh of savoury goodness. Small dish for $42, but the amount of flavour in this dish forces you to forgive that.

A5 Wagyu potatoes - This dish was bigger and heartier. I loved the double fried potatoes mixed with the crispy garlic and grainy mustard. The Wagyu beef was not quite what I expected. They were thinly shaved pieces of Wagyu beef sprinkled over the potatoes.

Pork belly - I could eat a few of these in one sitting if I let myself. Everything from the thick juicy slice of pork belly to the pillowy soft bun was perfect.

Chilled spicy noodles - The cool temperature of the noodles combined with the heat of the peppers makes for a party in your mouth. It's a combo of distinct flavours and textures - sichuan sausage, Thai basil, and candied cashews - that magically work together.

Shoyu pork ramen (available in the afternoon) - This is a winning bowl of ramen. I respect ramen that has a good proportion of meat, greens, and noodles. Not only is there a thick slab of their infamous pork belly, they give you shredded pork shoulder, as well. The noodles are perfectly chewy, and soak up the tasty broth as it should.

The restaurant may look small when you first walk past the podium, but located in the back is a large space with plenty of booths and wooden tables. The glass windows all around make for a great view and the kitchen is exposed to the dining room so you can see all the chefs at work. For our appetizers, my family chose the hamachi sashimi and salted cucumbers while for entrees we shared the scallion noodles, chilled Thai-spice noodles, and the pork ramen. 

The hamachi sashimi plate is a small portion, but the flavors are huge. Each slice of hamachi melted on your tongue and the dressing was unbelievably refreshing. I even liked the thin slices of orchids on top. As for the cucumbers, it was amazing how something so simple, could taste so addictive. I especially enjoyed eating the cucumber with the peanuts, creating a nice contrast in textures. 

When all the noodle dishes arrived, it was hard to pick a place to start. The chilled noodle dish was definitely the most colorful with the green, Thai-spice paste. It clung to every noodle strand, every peanut, and every piece of crispy, pork sausage. But don't let the cool green color full you. THIS IS ONE SPICY DISH! 

The scallion noodles were warmer and topped with seaweed, shitake mushrooms, and scallions. The sauce was light, but still packed a strong umami flavor. The noodles tasted hand made, having that perfect ""al-dente"" bite. The ramen bowl smelled the best of all three and I was practically drooling when I saw that poached egg. Spearing it with the chopstick, I watched with mesmerized eyes as a golden ooze melted into the broth. The pork belly is also sinfully fatty and tender while the broth is light. 

We had so many styles of noodles, but each dish was vastly different from the last. The variety in flavors and the execution of each entree was wonderful. Portions are a bit on the small side and prices are definitely on the high side, but what else is new when you come to a restaurant in Vegas?

WAU. Boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with a night at the Cosmo and dinner at Momofuku and it was quite a delicious surprise.

To start off we ordered some drinks - I got the Come Chai With Me (vodka, fig, blood orange, chai) which was pretty good. Had a smoky after taste. My boyfriend got the Toki Thyme. WOW. Now one of my all thyme (ha) favorite cocktails I've ordered. Later on, our waiter surprised us with a drink recommendation - the Penicillin (scotch, lemon, honey, ginger) which was so refreshing.

For food we shared:
1) HAMACHI (5/5)
Ugh, this was so good. Hamachi with a ponzu sauce, blood orange and uni. I don't really like uni, but it really rounded out the citrusy/sweet flavor of the dish.

2) PORK BELLY BUNS (5/5) and UNAGI BUNS (3/5)
I didn't expect the pork belly to be so THICK which was a pleasant surprise. It was crispy on the outside but still that juicy tenderness. Add the ""ssam sauce"" for a little kick. The unagi buns were unfortunately less tasty and under seasoned. It was pretty bland to me.

3) CHILLED SPICY NOODLES (5/5)
Easily one of my favorite dishes of the night. It's basically chilled ramen noodles topped by a spicy sauce (chili oil I think?), peppers, and ground pork. The whole dish was just packed with flavor.

4) STEAMED WHITE BRANZINO (4/5)
Our waiter recommended this to us and he made it sound so delicious. It was pretty good and I liked that it was deboned. The fish itself was very flavorful and I really liked all the sauce and herbs. But the more I ate it the more it tasted like I was eating mozzarella and pesto and less like fish. It was a taste that I got tired of with each bite so I had a hard time eating a lot of this. The waiter said it would be good for two people but my boyfriend and I struggled to finish this (also probably because we enjoyed the previous dishes and drinks a bit much).

Overall, a solid dining experience - 4.5 stars. I was impressed but wasn't really wow-d and don't feel particularly compelled to come back. But the service and drinks were great I definitely would like to try Momofuku in New York or any other of David Chang's restaurants for that matter just for the experience.",QFiRMxKrZEt8puAv4vzPoQ,2,1,4,Pbut0J401omOY0cHyyHYBA

We ordered several of the buns which were good but not that best we've had. If the pork ramen was a little less salty, I think it would've made a delicious dish. 

The most annoying part of our visit was the service. Everybody in our party ordered at the same time and we all got our food at the same time, except the chicken katsu which my boyfriend and I ordered in the very beginning. We waited another 5-10 minutes AFTER everybody else was done eating, and our katsu still didn't come. The entire table was getting frustrated because we had other plans. My friend decided she wanted another bun so she ordered another and it still came before our katsu! 5 minutes later, we decided to flag down our waitress (who barely came over) and told her we wanted to cancel the katsu. She told us that they were already cooking it and that she would check on it. Next thing you know, she's walking over with our dish and she just hovers it over us as if she wanted US to move the dishes on the table. I'm all for helping but she had a free hand and didn't even think to move the plates until I started doing it for her. We all felt that the katsu would have been better with a little less gravy so that the breading on the chicken wouldn't have been so soggy. It was also $34 which I think is ridiculous for chicken katsu.

The group decided to eat here because the wait time at the Wicked Spoon was too long (cry cry) and everyone was too starving to wait. Ended up being a pretty good alternative, considering we had dinner reservations not too long afterwards. Here's the food summary:

- Bigeye Tuna: the shaved foie gras gave this dish a buttery smooth texture. Tuna was fresh and the flavor was good. Just not $38 good. 

- Pork Belly Buns: yesssss that fatty meat was delicious, not overly cooked like some places can do with pork belly. Add some of their house sauce to it and this will definitely hold you over for a while. Order a few. 

- Shrimp Buns: I'm told this was good. Didn't try it myself 

- Crispy Potatoes: this was fantastic. The potatoes were amazing with the truffle and Parmesan. Only thing is that this is definitely a shareable side dish, but every person at the table ordered their own. No complaints tho, this made for great hangover food the next morning. 

Random note: I've always told myself that Japanese restaurants should embrace the culture completely and have a proper Japanese toilet in their bathrooms. Although Momofuku isn't a traditional Japanese restaurant really, they have become the first restaurant outside of Japan where I've seen the full blown fancy toilet, complete with the seat warmer and remote control to adjust the bidet.

Tare is a almost like a sauce like base for soup which is predominantly made up of soy sauce. You can then proceed to add a secondary flavor profile which may have been sardines or some sort of fish in this case, because for me the broth opened with a very noticeable soy sauce taste that had a dashi end note. Absolutely hated that taste. When it comes to ramen I mainly enjoy heavier broths such has tonkotsu, miso or shio. I actually hate shoyu as a broth, so this never was going to be something I would like I suppose. Other off putting things were the arugula and the super over easy egg. I definitely prefer spinach, bamboo and a hard boiled egg. I also disliked the shredded pork shoulder, but I think it's because it reminded me of pulled pork in ramen and I felt it was out of place.

What I did enjoy was the pork belly in this ramen, which tells me I might enjoy an order of ssam instead. It was very well flavored, texture was melt in your mouth and it brought a sense of glee to an otherwise disappointing meal. The pork bun, although pricey was also delicious.

We learned this incarnation combines the menus from their other locations into one restaurant, if anything because they have the space to-- it's huge!

We mentioned we were in a bit of a time crunch to make an evening show and our waitress made sure our food came out as soon as it was ready-- in some cases the mains made it out before the appetizers. 

We had pork ramen, kimchi stew, the ham small plate, shishito peppers and a slice of crack pie to share (which, even though it looked small for the 5 of us, was plenty).

We left full and in about an hour, which left us plenty of time for the rest of our evening. By the time we left the rest of the restaurant was starting to fill up.

The chilled spicy noodles were spicy, but not to the point that you couldn't taste the other flavors. It had sausage, and cashews in it. The sauce was like a pesto, but basil flavored. 

My hubby loved the branzino. He usually doesn't like whole fish, but I think that was his favorite. It came with a grilled lemon and brown butter dashi. The dashi was so unctuous and really made the fish delicious.

2695517,2017-12-04,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"TLDR: Doesn't live up to the hype. 
Try it if you've never been to Momofuku restaurant. Temper your expectations, $14 for 4oz pour of sake. 

With David Chang being a household name amongst foodies the hype around Momofuku may just be too much for the restaurant to uphold. 

I was extremely hyped to try Momofuku in Vegas and this was my first experience at a David Chang restaurant. 

We had a late lunch at 2:30pm and ordered the pork buns and the pork ramen. Figured these are what they are known for so decided to go with the known good items. 

I was prepared to be blown away or at the very least get an understanding of the hype of Momofuku. 

The pork buns were close. Not mind blowing but very very good. I expected the pork to be steamed like a bossam since I've seen pics of it but it wasn't. I suppose that's only available in some of his other restaurants. 

The ramen while good didn't blow me away either nor sadly did it live up to the hype. The texture of the noodle were great but the broth didn't quite do it for me. 

I was really excited and hoping to love Momofuku and embrace the hype but sadly, no. 

If you're a Momofuku fan and never tried it, it's worth a try. Just remember to temper your expectations. 

Oh and I'd avoid ordering sake. Not sure what I was thinking but I ordered sake and it was $14 for a 4oz pour.  Cheaper options available but keep that in mind when ordering sake.",qqYDkUgw4MbEQ_xwmqO9FA,0,0,3,aDoBUol9nWe4o7v6c2GCkA

Before you walk in, you can see the attached milk bar - yummy desserts! From the outside seating section, it looks very typical and casual. However, the sections inside transport you to a fine, modern, Asian-inspired dining setting. Leather seats, contemporary lighting fixtures, awesome art on the wall!

Our party of 5 started off with 3 starters - the spicy cucumbers, crispy potatoes and market greens. The cucumbers were divine and super fresh, they reminded me of classic Korean bam han with a fusion twist. The potatoes were crunchy and the truffle topping was decadent. Market greens - not that memorable except for the use of interesting vegetables.

We then had the infamous pork buns, accompanied by the ssam sauce. The meat was so tender and juicy and the bread was perfect. Amazinggg.

The ginger scallion noodles were lightly seasoned and the accompanying vegetables were very complementary to the overall taste. The rigatoni was more adventurous in its taste but my mom loved it, fresh seafood balanced with hand rolled pasta and an acidic tasting sauce.

The rotisserie jidori chicken reminded me of Korean tong ddak or whole fried chicken. Squeezes of lime made the various spices rubbed onto the chicken skin pop. Meat was tender and not too dry not too juicy.

I usually detest lamb because of the smell but this dish - sichuan lamb ribs - was cooked well to get rid of that smell. There was some heat but well balanced with the yogurt sauce.

Lastly, the porterhouse prime rib. Cooked to medium rare perfection - meat was juicy and not annoying to chew on. The side fries were a little salty but the brussel sprouts were yummy - sauce reminded me of yuzu.


DESSERT from the famous milk bar. The crack pie a la mode was to die for. The soft serve it comes with is called cereal because the concoction rests with cereal to give it that particular sweetness. Pie is literally crack.

Birthday cake - soft and not too sweet. There were small bits of cake dough? dispersed to liven up the texture. The sprinkles are really cute to look at.

I'd come back but would order less // order my favorites like the pork bun, cucumbers and chicken, scallion noodles and prime rib.

          - Chilled Spicy Noodles
          - Lamb Ribs
          - I think I'm missing something else...

Definitely get the buns and try out some of it before you use their ssam sauce! The flavor is amazing and I don't know if it's the price or the actual flavor, but it tastes more expensive and tasty (very springy bun and tender meat(pork)) Be sure to use their ssam sauce as it adds a whole other side!

The chilled spicy noodles was all right, but growing up in a taiwanese household, I've had better.

Lamb ribs just fall off the bone and are incredibly delicious, especially as someone who has lamb pretty often it was a treat (:

The shrimp bun is ok not really special. 
The pork belly bun taste delicious. Chicken and pork belly ramens are great!!! My kids love it.

The salt and pepper shrimp too salty. It's come with 4 pieces of lobster tails and 1 lbs of fried shrimps. I suggest to eat with white rice to balance the flavors.

The pork bun was tasty and much better than chairman Bao in SF but that doesn't say much since the bar there is not high.

Momofuku is a great restaurant tucked in the corner of the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. I had high expectations of this place, and for me, it did not disappoint... Now did it live up to my unreasonably high expectations? Probably not, but Momofuku is a restaurant I would eat at again, and again, and again, especially if I'm dealing with a throbbing hangover in Vegas.

Let's start with the buns.  I'm usually a pork bun type of guy, and while the bun was great, the star of the show for me was the Chicken Karage Bun. I'll chalk it up to one of those weekends where having something fried feels better than something braised. The bun's hits you from different angles, but its really the red sauce that completes the dish.  Make sure you add it and don't be shy. 5/5

Moving onto the Ramen, which was a nice gourmet take on your traditional ramen. The roasted pork gave a smoky taste, while the pork belly provided a more sweet and savory taste. It was very complex, yet, the broth didn't blow me away. That was, until I popped the yolk and let it mix with all the flavors in the bowl.  My world changed and this ramen went from 'yeah it's pretty good' to 'damn, I should have did this earlier'.  I have a few ramen joints I like better in LA, but this is a solid choice. I would definitely consider coming here after a night (or day) of partying. 4/5

Service was awesome, and the ambience is a near match for the Cosmo's styling.

The breakdown:

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambience: 5/5

Dessert at Milk is amazing as well. I'll save that review for another time though, but if you had to get a few things here, make sure it is one of the buns and the dessert from milk.",6r8P0hmlQ3xcCmZaK1YB1g,2,2,4,LdILQo-MgplIu89DhhjKUg

Located in the modern Cosmopolitan hotel, the restaurant is classy, spacious, and trendy.  The four of us went for the 5 spice rotisserie duck meal, one of the large format dining options.  I was surprised we didn't have to pre-order the duck since Momofuku Ssam bar in NY requires it.  

The waiter brought out the whole rotisserie duck on a wood serving table and carved the different pieces in front of us. First, the breast, then the leg confit, then placed them over a bed of ginger scallion sauce rice.  They took the rest of the duck to the kitchen to deep fry it for us!  There were accompanying sauces and wraps brought out for the duck.  The chinese style accompaniments included chive pancakes, hoisin, ginger scallion sauce.  The korean style accompaniments included kimchi, bibb lettuce, and ssam sauce.  The meal is a fun experience, but the standouts were the leg confit over rice, the chinese style accompaniments, and the deep fried duck pieces.  I'm not a fan of duck breast, but the leg confit over rice was heavenly. Though I'm a Korean who loves kimchi and ssam sauce, I really think the Chinese way of hoisin + duck cannot be beat!!  

We also ordered pork belly buns and spicy cucumbers to start.  The duck meal is for 2-3, but it was beyond filling for the 4 of us.  The large format meals are pricey, but it was a good one-time adventure for us!",mHoxDictMZa4cGZmXKbkYw,5,3,4,e2naDDYB3iJ5UHC7_EwIyQ

Pork Ramen 4 out of 5 stars - comes w shredded pork shoulder, poached egg, slice of pork belly, vegetables, noodle and some tasty broth. Added shitake which I would strongly recommend. Shoulder was a tad dry and I think broth is what makes or breaks ramen. This one was good but I've had better. Also couldn't not adjust spice level - they only offer one level. 

Da Belly Bun 2 out of 5 stars - the bun was warm and fluffy. That is where the fun stops :(

2891349,2017-11-12,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Huge WOW. I've been to a couple of Momofuku's in NYC - Saam Bar, Nishi, and Milk Bar, all wonderful experiences. I was super excited to try the one that opened in Las Vegas! Finally something on the west coast!

This restaurant is quite different from the other ones in NYC. It seems like each restaurant in NYC focuses on a different theme - ramen, fine dining, different meats, etc. This Momofuku in Las Vegas though, seems to be a mix of all of the themes together. In general, it was a big mix of Asian fusion. See dishes below. 

Food: 
-Shishito Peppers - smoked salt, lime. Damn. This was a fantastic appetizer to share. I knew ahead of time that 1 in 8 peppers is spicy - but we learned from the manager that night that if they're in season, the spiciness is intensified. So they were in season, and we were howling like a MOFO. The peppers were fantastic though. I loved the lime powder they sprinkled on - so tasty. Read my service note below for what happened to calm our spicy mouths. They gave us a lot of peppers, totally worth the $9. 
-Pork Belly Bun with  hoisin, scallion, cucumber - This is a must order. It's their famous bun! So delicious. The pork belly was great. They also bring out their special ""ssam sauce,"" which just ties together all the ingredients. The bun is pretty big, so feel free to share this one if you just want a taste. 
-Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp - fried chilies & garlic. WHOA. This was a knockout dish. The lobster and shrimp were deep fried - just like a Chinese dish. However, it was the addition of the lobster that was just so amazing. This part was the fusion part. They gave us a lot of lobster, and the lobster was SO PERFECTLY COOKED. Soft, chewy at all. Just perfect. Omg. We've never had a dish like that before! This was a huge dish, for 2 people to share.
-Ginger Scallion Noodles - pickled shiitake, cucumber, wakame. We just had to order noodles at some time during our meal! These were excellent. At first I thought I was ordering ramen, but they arrived at our table, there was no soup lol. Just noodles on bottom, covered with the wakame seaweed, mushrooms, and cucumber. The noodles were soaked in this olive oil that was prepared for hours, our waiter told us. OMG. The flavors were just so incredible! It tasted like there was a secret ingredient in there, like butter or something with meat, but NO - JUST OLIVE OIL. I couldn't believe it - vegetarian dish that tasted so rich! This dish could make anyone go vegetarian. Noodles cooked to perfection too - not overdone, but nice and soft. 
-Birthday Cake - I think they feature this cake from next door's Momofuku Milk Bar. It was so fun to try this cake - it's so pretty, and just reminds you of your childhood. The cake was tasty, but frosting a little sweet. I was glad I tried it though - every table was getting it that night, it seemed. 

Overall, food was fantastic. One bummer is that they change their menu very frequently - so what you see on Yelp in pictures is not always something you can order that night when you're dining. I mean, this is a good and bad thing. I really loved all the dishes we did order, though! Another bummer is that there's a whole separate ""group menu"" on the back, which has larger entrees for groups of 4-6 people. We wanted to order from here too, but knew it'd just be too much food. This is a great place to go with your friends though. 

Service:
SO outstanding here. I really felt taken care of. When we had the shishito peppers, and unfortunately had the spicy ones, the manager of the restaurant came to our rescue and offered us some soft serve from the Momofuku Milk Bar next door to help us calm our taste palates! WOW. Everyone was so friendly here too - I felt like our waiter Erik and the whole team were a bunch of our friends. Kinda weird I say that - but that's the vibe they give off. Amazing experience.

Ambiance:
Modern, cool, vibe. It honestly felt like a restaurant in LA to me (not a bad thing!). They had lazy susan's for the larger group tables. Japanese toilet in the restroom. Played Snoop Dogg and old Kanye West for the tunes. Just our idea of perfect!

I actually enjoyed this restaurant slightly more than the ones I had in NYC. I really liked the fusion aspect of being able to try all of David Chang's specialties in one restaurant.

Thank you Vegas for bringing so many big names from all over the country to one conveniently sinful location. It's nice to be able to knockout several foodie temptations in one weekend. 

We made our way to Momofuku after a day pool party. We didn't have much of a wait to get seated. I ordered the Chicken Karaage steamed bun and the seven spice slushie. Hubby ordered the chicken sandwich and our friend ordered the chicken and pork belly buns. 

The chicken bao was perfect. The serving size is just right in the sense it satisfies you and leaves you wanting a little more. The bun is light but sturdy enough to hold its fillings. The meat is crispy on the outside but oh so juicy within. The ssam sauce brought a nice spicy kick to the entire bao. Hubby enjoyed his chicken sandwich, but funny enough wishes he would've gotten the bao instead (especially once we walked next door to Milk bar). 

The seven spice slushie was refreshing and had a good heat to it. I wished it came it yard size instead of a small glass.

I think the emperor has no clothes... The menu is weirdly skewed to larger dishes for 4 or more people, so if it's just the two of you, your choices are severely limited.  We've been here three times now, twice as a couple and once with a large group.  The large group experience was great because we could enjoy a few of the large plates, but as a just a couple we had too few choices.  To walk through some of the items we enjoyed, A5 Hokkaido Wagyu Potatoes were good but a really heavy, rich choice as a small plate.  Seemingly counter to the Asian feel of the rest of the menu and if that's Wagyu beef, shaving it and obliterating it like that is a waste of great meat.  Pork Belly Buns were good, but didn't stand out.  Shrimp Buns are quite good, don't miss them.  Same with Chilled Spicy Noodles, really good! Several of the large plates are great, even remarkable, but all serve a minimum of 3 people and most serve 4 or more.  So without a large party, you lose. Our large party enjoyed Salt and Pepper Lobster and Shrimp, and also 5 Spice Rotisserie Duck and the Bo Saam slow roasted pork.  So bring 8 of your closest friends and enjoy the pricy large plates.

The experience this time was great for my wife! We didn't get the Brussel sprouts and we tried the Shrimp Bao this time and my wife found a new fav. We had the chicken Katsu with Shitake gravy, that was beyond incredible! That gravy can go with anything! 

My son and I had the pork Ramen, that was very delicious! Our guests had the ChickPea Ramen which was incredibly flavorful. 

For desert, I had the crack pie, which is signature and always delicious, IMO.

Wife had the cornflake marshmallow cookie. Her favorite.

My son had a cereal milk with chocolate chips and hot fudge. He killed it. I managed to sneak a taste and it was very good. Its as people have said...you know the milk left over from the cereal you just ate...? Well they made it into an ice cream flavor... So good..!

I like this place a lot and do look forward to returning with guests that come into town.  I'm glad that my  wife had a better culinary experience so that means she too will return.

* Korean braised short ribs ($188 for 3-4 people) - the meat came right off the bone and must have been slow-cooked with a lot of love...I may or may not have been eating the leftovers after the meal.

2942730,2018-03-11,2,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Momofuku was established by celebrity Chef David Chang. This restaurant serves food that is Globally Inspired, American, Korean and Japanese. Highlights on the menu are Steamed Buns, Noodles, Meat and Raw Seafood. Plates are meant for sharing. The location of this Momofuku is in the Cosmopolitan Casino Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. At this time (March 2018) this is the only Momofuku on the west coast.

For our first plate we shared the Pear and Burrata. Other ingredients were Hazelnuts, Butter Lettuce and Black Truffles. It was a joy to eat....Very Delicious!

For our main course we shared the Rotisserie Chicken Ssams. It was a good sized half chicken that was marinated and covered with delicious spices. I don't know what they all were but I could pick out star anise. The chicken was moist and had a crisp delicious skin. You eat it like an Asian Style Fajita. You take a piece of lettuce, add chicken, hoisin, and kimchi It's really awesome super delicious!!!!! The plate also contains ginger rice.

The food was FIVE stars to me....everything was so delicious.... I might have picked what they do best.

Our server was good. The place has a nice atmosphere and they play classic rock.

The one thing that was awful was the food runner. After we finished our first course we had an empty used plate on the table. The food runner comes out with our main course plate and instead of removing the used plate he makes a big deal and SLAMS the plate on top of the used plate. It was really LOUD too!  I know why he is a food runner. Can you imagine what kind of waiter he'd be? I'm still thinking about what an awful food runner he was.....

2947441,2018-03-29,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Momofuku Las Vegas is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel, one of many restaurants inside this beautifully thought out hotel. This was our first stop in Las Vegas, after waiting a few years to visit this amazing city! 

My significant other and I came to this restaurant after being recommended to us by our guest service agent. She told us that we'd enjoy it very much, especially since it our first time in Las Vegas. The service given to us was fine. We were approached by our server who seated us immediately. We asked her for popular dishes on the menu. From those recommendations, we decided to order the pork belly and shrimp baos, spicy cucumbers, crispy potatoes, and for our main dish the 5 spice rotisserie duck (which was supposed to be the highlighted dish on the menu). While my significant other has never eaten duck, she decided to be particularly courageous this time, since we're in Las Vegas! I was happy because I love duck. 

When we got our food, everything turned out to be pretty tasty, except the duck. One bite of the duck meat and all you can taste is a distinct saltiness. One bite of the rice (which came with the duck) was all salt as well. I could understand if the duck was a bit on the salty side, accompanied by rice that is not, so that way it helps balance the other, but clearly this wasn't the case. 

So we spoke to our waiter and she took the duck back. She told us that she would come back and ask us if we'd like another duck dish prepared. Instead, she came back to our table to let us know they've already put one on the fire and that it's being made immediately. At this point, we felt like we had no choice but to keep the duck even though my significant other and I both decided that we no longer wanted it. It was upsetting that we were not asked if we wanted another dish prepared before our server let the chef know to fire up another one. By the time we had the chance to tell our server, it was already too late and she came back with another duck in her hand. 

So here is another attempt at the duck... this one was still salty but not as salty as the first. Rice is still pretty salty as well. We each had one bite and decided we're just going to bring it ""to-go,"" even though we knew we couldn't eat it because it's salty, and secondly, there was no microwave in the hotel to heat it up again. We paid for the bill and left a 20% tip despite us not being happy with our first meal of the day, even though we were starving!!

I get to our room and opened up the duck to take a look at it inside. We found a surprise waiting for us -  a fruit fly on the lettuce, packed to-go. We may not have left the restaurant starving, but we were not satisfied. I don't think we'll be coming back to this restaurant the next time we find ourselves in Vegas. For the experience to begin so well in the beginning and then shot all the way down was saddening. I really wanted a pleasant experience",7UxF8BO23yy5yin2GUBe5w,0,0,1,j2wH1Skt_aPLpNQzPmospg

I also recommend the ground shrimp bao, it has great flavor. The spicy cucumber starter is lovely, not too large, and the kimchi tastes great. My favorite noodle is the spicy noodles - the pork sausage was very flavorful, the spinach pesto tasted great, and the spice level is perfect! I know in the past people have complained about the dish being too spicy, so Momofuku lowered the heat a few notches to cater to more guests pallets. If you have the time, I recommend popping out and ordering from Milk as well.

I came in with high expectations and was really disappointed.  Pricing, while in line for a strip restaurant, is too high.  We started at the bar, which was wet and dirty, with a bar staff that scowls at you.  This team feels like angry hipster bartenders straight out of central casting.  The cocktails were not well executed and quite frankly they were overly sweet.  Table service is jumbled and weird, putting a smooth dining experience out of reach.  Not a single manager could be seen on the floor.  If they had been there, they would have had a chance to check on the bathrooms which were filthy.  Water and paper was everywhere.  Maybe the person before me decided to use the bidet feature on the Japanese toilet to do their own version of the Bellagio fountain show - who knows.  

Food was not up to par, and certainly not at the level delivered in NY.  Soft Boiled Eggs lacked any seasoning - it was just plain missed.  Pork Belly Buns lacked pork.  Kimchi Stew was good, but it was so spicy that I had to keep going back to the buns to cool off.  Ginger Scallion Noodles featured the mushiest noodles you've ever tried.  The only dish worth trying again was the Citrus Cured Fluke which was outstanding.

It was Monday night and the place empty, yet we were rushed through our meal.  The only saving grace of the meal was selections from Milk Bar next door.

For my main course I ordered the pork ramen which was tasty. I was especially fond of the coddled egg in the ramen, since usually ramen comes with an egg that's fully cooked through. 

My only complaint was the amount of sodium in the dish which was overwhelming.

I added the pork belly, and it was very tender. I could eat the entire bin of pork belly from momofuku with some lettuce wraps and ssam jang. 

The brussel sprouts were very flavorful too! the flavor that I kept feeling was ""wow this is refreshing"". For example, if you drank sprite before (in your life) you understand that it gives your mouth a refreshing flavor. If you add some lemon or lime into your sprite, that refreshing quality enhances! momofuku is that enhancement to my taste buds! 

Skip the shitty buffets that overcharges in every way they can for their mediocrity, and head on over to momofuku to get a glimpse of flavor. Hell, go gamble first, and if you lose money, at least youll feel like a winner after eating at momofuku.

*~Our Order on 1/22/2017~*
Pork Belly Bun: ($14) hoisin, scallion, cucumber
Chicken Karaage Bun: ($14) spicy mayo, pickled red onion, iceberg
Shiitake Bun: ($12) hoisin, scallion, cucumber
Pommes Puree: ($8)
Kimchi Stew: ($24) pork shoulder, rice cakes, roasted onion
Ginger Scallion: ($17) pickled shiitake, cucumber, wakame
Pork Ramen: ($18) pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg
Black Winter Truffle Ramen: ($58) périgord truffles, egg yolk

The pork belly in the bun is fairly thick and not too crispy (which I like but one person in our prefers it to be crispy). Some people in the group actually preferred the Chicken Karaage bun over the Pork Belly. Wouldn't order the Shiitake Bun again (even though I love mushrooms). Same goes for the Truffle Ramen. Even though it was very fragrant, the broth completely overpowered and you could barely taste the truffles. The mashed potatoes were very light & airy, and actually pretty good. BF regretted ordering the Ginger Scallion ramen. Everyone else said their dishes were ""ok"" but wouldn't go out of their way to eat again. We did like the QQ (or ""bite"") of the noodles tho. If we HAD to come back we would only order the buns, but for about $7/bun, we didn't feel it was worth it.

Getting seated was an absolute nightmare (and why the 1 star)! I came at 5:15PM since they open the doors at 5:30PM and saw that no one was in line yet. I had a flight to catch and wanted to see if our group of 9 would be able to get seated earlier than our 6PM reservation time (only 30min earlier).  I was told no as they were ""setting up the table."" I was debating if we should just sit at the bar for walk-ins (they didn't have any tables for larger than a group of 4 in the front end) but as I told the hostess of the time restraint, I thought we would get seated in time. We even gave the hostess all of our orders so that the food would be ready by the time we would get seated. 

BIG MISTAKE. We should've just sat at the bar. Only after many inquires about when we were going to be seated, we got seated 25min AFTER our reservation time. Our table was in the very back of the restaurant and we saw that ALL the tables were already setup and not even 1/4 of the restaurant was full. Our entire group was baffled as to why we couldn't be seated earlier. THEN, when the waitress asked for our order and we informed her that we already submitted it with the hostess, our waitress found out it was never entered. By now, everyone was starving and fed up with the experience and was on the verge of leaving. Our waitress said that luckily the items we would like to order would not take long so we were convinced to stay. One of our friends (who used to be a manager of a high-end hotel) insisted on speaking to a manager tho and the only response we got from the manager was, ""I'm sorry but I don't know what to tell you."" Service right there folks! The chef did send out a pickle plate as an ""apology"" but after a taste, no one really cared for any of the pickled items (even my BF who LOVES pickles!).

NO ONE in our group said they would return. Not sure how service can be so poor when one of their restaurants was able to get two Michelin stars. Shame since we're in Vegas many times in a year.",xoNpQ_DnzNuTbkFPPO0Lgw,8,2,1,BVVTxXezml0uAqRHgVhK7g

Knowing we had a trip to Vegas planned, I was super excited to see that Momofuku had opened in Cosmopolitan. I've eaten at a variety of Momofuku's in NYC and had good experiences and delicious food there, so I was expecting the same here.

The restaurant is located next to Milk Bar and definitely more blingy compared to it's NYC counterparts. Boyfriend and I sat at the bar with a full view of the kitchen, and we watched them crank out dish after dish. We had the pork ramen, pork buns, and spicy rice cakes (with pork). Are you sensing a porky theme here?!

I know it's Vegas, and it's expected you pay a premium for everything here, but the price point even exceeded NYC, which seemed crazy to us. The ramen was just ok and the broth didn't have the richness we were expecting. For some reason, it didn't taste the same as the Noodle Bar version, and the portion size seemed smaller. 

The other issue I had was with the pork buns. Please see photos for a side-by-side comparison of NYC Momofuku buns vs. the ones at this location. The pork buns here were incredibly piddly and the amount of pork belly was literally half of what it should be. Definitely not a consistent experience.",-D4T2oVxSjvVN9_owkEmyw,16,1,3,yyaIP_t_xYbCiC9eKz7z6Q

The white Cosmo slushie sounded cute and yummy so we ordered that and it was half off. It was so refreshing and delicious. For food, we ordered the shishito peppers, the pork ramen, and the ginger scallion noodles, and the pork belly bun. All the food was tasty. The pork belly bun came out first and it was gooooood. It always is though. The server brought the essential ssam sauce for us to eat it with. The shishito peppers were good too but I think it would've been even better without the powder sprinkled on top of it. Sometimes simple is more. Just a little olive oil and salt! Watch out for those random spicy ones. The ramen was good (but I've had better ramen elsewhere - it's not the best). The ginger scallion noodles were really tasty - it comes with shiitake mushrooms, cucumber and wakame and it's a cold noodle dish. It was simple flavoring but refreshing. I would totally get this again. I also added ssam sauce to it! 

We ordered two more rounds of the slushie. Our last one was right at closing time, so our amazing server brought it to us on a to go cup so we didn't have to down it. So thoughtful!

The pork ramen was certainly disappointing. The alkaline noodles were a touch soft, and the broth lacked depth of flavor. Only the pulled pork shoulder and pork belly imparted a modicum of flavor into this dish.

The soft-boiled eggs were even more disappointing. They came lukewarm, and the ikura roe completely overpowered the dish with its saltiness. 

The shrimp cocktail was uneventful, with 6 tiger prawns and a fusion-inspired cocktail sauce that was sweet rather than spicy.

The pork belly bun was the only item I enjoyed eating. The bun was fluffly and the pork belly had a melt-in-your-mouth texture and was not overly seasoned.

Such mediocre dishes tarnish David Chang's name and bring into question his ability to expand the Momofuku chain while preserving his culinary vision. If this establishment is a portent of further efforts, he should re-evaluate his plans.",dnNXirfyr8xcUS6E56oRIg,3,0,1,BMzG6hGAXQ8uYNCjqVuzfw

3096061,2018-04-25,2,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"A very trendy spot inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. This location is easily three times the size of any of the NYC Momo restaurants, and the food is intended for big groups.

I remember 4 distinct parts to the menu - appetizers, small plates, plates for 2 - 3, and plates for 4 - 6. Everything is priced at the group rate. Also, note that in Las Vegas, 2 dollar signs is actually 3 dollar signs. 

For a group of 6, we were recommended to order at least one main ( 4- 6) and a couple small plates (2-3). It is really difficult if you haven't been here before to know if that is truly enough food. We ended up ordering 4 items - the burrata and pear salad, the ginger and scallion noodles, salt and pepper lobster and shrimp, and the 5 spice duck. It was more than enough food. We probably could have cut out the burrata or the noodles ( not because they didn't taste delicious) but because by the time the duck came, we were all pretty full.

It's not just the fact that the plates are shareable, it is also that each dish is a flavor bomb and it is better to err on the side of ordering conservatively so that you can truly enjoy each dish.

I highly recommend ordering all of the 4 dishes stated above. The 5 spice duck is an experience - and it is done in two parts, no duck is wasted or left behind. It also comes with lettuce, ginger flavored wraps, a couple dipping sauces and is served on a bed of ginger scallion rice. I know they told me all this before I ordered, but they were not exaggerating, it is a lot of food.",hcZqq-a16ZTjaM2p2MljTg,5,4,5,17uQwA580ZYp9azA436ZzQ

Wanted to see if the experience can be replicated in Vegas... :)

We made reservations for Monday for lunch at 1230 pm, but honestly - no reservations were needed. Plenty of seating inside the restaurant, which is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We ordered:

1) Pork belly ramen - pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg; my husband ordered this and thought it was pretty good but he's had better ramen at Tsujita in Los Angeles. 
2) Pork buns x2 - hoisin, scallion, cucumber; this was as good as I remember it, although the pork belly was pretty fat. We each had one! It's pricey at $7 each though.
3) Chilled spicy noodle - Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashew; I've never tried this before but decided to get it because I wanted to experience something new. They use some type of green spicy pesto sauce to toss the cold noodles, it was quite spicy and the sausage they gave me was very generous.

We saw that there was an open reservation on OpenTable right before the show so it was perfect timing. We were seated promptly after checking in with the host. We told our servers that we were in a rush so she assured that we would make our show on time. 

We ordered the bucatini, chilled spicy noodles, and 2 pork belly buns. The pork belly buns were literal perfection. The pork belly is seasoned extremely well. The ssam sauce was a great addition, and it was not that spicy. It was tangier than I thought it would be. The bucatini was really decadent. The hozon taste is prevalent the moment you put it in your mouth. I feel like you really have to be in the mood for the bucatini. The chilled spicy noodles were unexpected. The combination of the sichuan sausage and cashews were a superb pair. They were really only spicy if you eat the cut chilis. 

When we were done with the show, we realized that we could not get our mind off the pork belly buns. So, we went back to Momofuku and were seated at the bar. It was really awesome to see the chefs at work. It was a cool experience! We decided to get two more pork belly buns and each ordered shoyu pork ramen. I usually do not like soy sauce broths for my ramen, but it was well done. The pork shoulder and belly is an excellent spotlight for this ramen dish.

There's not a lot of bargains to be found on the strip, and even fewer in the Cosmo where this restaurant is located, but you can get a great meal at a reasonable price for Vegas.  It's Ramen, so it shouldn't be outrageous.  The shishito peppers are absolutely the best I've ever had, and I order them basically any time there on a menu in front of me.  This menu doesn't mention their secret ingredient, only saying ""smoke salt and lime.""  Chang's are tossed with nutritional yeast and while I could never picture how that would work with the pepper flavor, it's a stroke of genius.  Having been here before, I had to go twice in the 5 nights I was here recently, dragging as many coworkers with me as I could round up.  None of them was let down by any part of their meal.  

The Pork Ramen does not appear on the dinner menu, only on the lunch and late night menus.  They dress it up with black truffle on the dinner menu and sling it for $50 or so.  No thanks.  I'm sure it's lovely, but for $50 I'm not eating ramen.  If you ask for the Pork ramen they'll still serve it at dinner time, and it's just outstanding.  I'm not sure how they get the egg to that consistency, it must be magic.  When you slice into it with your chopstick it's like an egg-asm in your bowl. The Dashi is every bit as good as you'd expect if you know who David Chang is.  The buns are great too, and if you have a few friends ready to share the menu offers family style meals like Bo Saam , an incredible roast pork dish for about $140, or fried chicken with caviar that you can spend $1500 on if you're a high roller or too drunk to read the prices.  This extravagance is offset by the Miller High Life that was the beer special a few months back.  Overall I love the vibe here, the food is outstanding, and it's a beacon of comfort food in a hot shot hotel that was a welcome surprise for me.

Starters, we had their Momofuky Oysters. I did not have any as I am not a fan of oysters but by the way they killed those oysters my best bet was that they were delicious. 
Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly. Crunchy on the outside and nice and soft in the inside. 
Then we had the Pork ramen which I loved. The piece of pork that came with it literally melted as you took a bite. It was my favorite thing in the ramen, I just wished there was more. Good flavor overall and the noodles were cooked perfectly. 

For the main entree we had the Bo Ssam. Slow-roasted cooked pork shoulder. Yeezus was this freaking amazing. The pork was beyond tender. The meat would fall apart as you would dig your utensils in it. Very rich in flavor and color. It was served with white rice, kimchee, lettuce and sauces. Best thing we had that night... (mouth waters). 

Dessert time, or as I call it my favorite part. We had the Chocolate chocolate cookie and the Blueberry + cream. Both were very good just wished they had more of a chew to them. And of course we had to try the self serve milk cereal. It was served in a mug topped with cereal and a little bit of chocolate drizzle. This dessert was really weird to me as it actually tasted like the left over milk from your cereal bowl. Definitely a must try as it was unique and delicious at the same time.

Their buns are good, especially the pork belly + chicken karaage ones. However, their 'signature pork ramen' was really bad. We ordered 4 bowls of this ramen and every single one of the bowls had clumpy noodles. I ate one bite that had at least 10 strands of noodles stuck together in one massive doughy clump. That's honestly unacceptable for a $20 bowl of ramen. We told the server nicely so that the chefs could watch out for this in the future but she seemed pretty unapologetic. 

As for the milk bar desserts, the cereal milk soft serve that everyone raves about was just okay. Personally, I'm not a fan of salty flavours in my desserts (e.g. salted caramel, maple bacon etc) so I didn't love the saltiness that came through from the cereal.

pork ramen was nothing special except cha shiu was replaced by pork belly, broth is rather boring

spicy noodle was like a ramen noodle in pesto sauce with thai style condiments, not bad, better than the ramen I would say

the lamb ribs were seasoned very well

Good news is that I never have to wonder again. I'm not going to say this place was bad, it was just OK. And for that price, OK is just not really good enough to return.
We tried the Hamachi to start and that was a serious disappointment. It was super expensive and we figured, ""for that much money, must be good"". WRONG.. it was really strange tasting, and not in a good way. Not a lot of flavor.
Now the buns were a different story. I wish we had just ordered buns and nothing else. They were tasty, all of them. Pork belly was the best, but I liked them all.
We also got the bucatini and the Sichuan lamb ribs. The bucatini was mediocre, and the lamb ribs were overly chewy. Pretty hard to eat.
On the fence about the drinks. We tried both of the slushy drinks. The seven spice one had a real kick and the mojito was super strong, good for some, maybe not for others.

The Five-spice Duck... was amazing! Presentation, flavor... it had it all. The sliced breast over confit sprinkled rice was unctuous and rich, with a great balance of sweet and savory.

It's located at the beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel on the 2nd floor next to Holsteins. I'd recommend reservations to prevent any waiting. There is casual bar seating and also a nice dining area. The view is pretty nice on the strip at night so great for a date. All the dishes you order are sharing dishes so you'll probably need about 3-5 dishes to fill up two adults eating there. Their service is top notch since their staff constantly comes to check on your table, make sure your water is refilled and cleans up after every dish finished. 

Note that you can order the ramen if you're sitting at the dining table area and not the bar - we didn't know but apparently you could order it off menu.

We ordered the following:

Rotisserie Jidori Chicken - very crispy and juicy but a little on the saltier side for us...needed to drink about 2-3 glasses of water to wash down all the salt (or maybe I was dehydrated due to how dry the weather is in Las Vegas....or maybe both)

Ginger scallion noodles - just like what the description says

Pork belly bun - really flavorful and fall apart pork belly...only comes with one order of the bun

Shitake bun - decent...only comes with one order of the bun

Chinese broccoli - really good flavors and the sauce was on point with the dish

Korean rice cake - a little disappointed in the spiciness level...we wanted it to be spicier but our waitress told us that too many patrons were saying they couldn't handle the spiciness (I'm thinking those patrons are weak sauce)

Damage to the bill...wasn't by far anything I had imagined...I think it was about $100 and change which is really reasonable for dining in Las Vegas.

Came for lunch so can't say about dinner but:

1. Buns - not bad but nothing exceptional. Most were over sauced or salted, the shiitake was recommended but the added flavor really overpowered the mushrooms (nice texture though).  Fish cake one I would actually recommend.  EXPENSIVE considering I can swing by and have chairman bao in the bay

2. Ramen - mediocre.

3. Szechuan noodles - inedible. I love Sichuan food and this was not sichuan in any way!  The green sauce was WAY too spicy and had none of the peppercorn mala flavor signature of Sichuan food.  The sausage was ok but lacked any complex flavor just salty

4. Brussel sprouts - not bad but the ones at rose. rabbit. lie were better.

Food: Pork belly in the pork belly ramen came apart like butter in my mouth (good sign). Ramen and soup was flavored on point, although I think if you held a gun to my head and made me pick the best noodles, I would still pick Tsujita.

3254959,2017-09-15,2,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I really wanted to like this placed, but both my friends and I are all quite disappointed. At first we all thought it was a Japanese fusion, new American cuisine, but it turns out to be more of a mixed Asian cuisines, like half Korean, half Chinese? 

We have a party of 6 with 4 grown up men and 2 girls. We ordered 3 main course- the steamed brazino fish, rotisserie chicken and fried bone, and the braised Korean short ribs, a few buns, some 1/2 shell oysters and some chinese broccli as our green. The server suggested us to at least order 4, it is definitely an over kill. The portion was listed to serve 2, but each entree definitely can serve 4 . That are huge!! 

1/2 shell oysters with melon ice - taste 5 stars, price and value 3 stars. Over all 4 stars. They are very fresh, and love the touch of the melon ice with citrus taste. It brings out the sweetness in the oyster but not over powering. I do enjoy it very much, except they are very small. For a price of $26 , which breaks down to $4.5 a pieces, it's very pricey. 

The pork bun- it's okay 3 stars. 
If I compare it to the Taiwanese style pork buns, the momofuku buns are not as juicey and lack of garnishing. If I compare to the vietnames/ Chinese style pork buns from bao hoag, they are lack of the crispness of the pork belly and flavors too. It is not bad, but nothing special about them.

The main dishes:
My favourite is the Korean braised short ribs. It's so tender and loaded with flavors. I didn't think it was spicy from a glance, but they do put in the chilli pepper in, which live out to a Korean dish without all being red. Loved that they lined the claypot with rice cake and lotus root and potatoes. They soaked up all the flavors from the meat and the claypot kept it warm the whole time before we can finished the pot. Honestly, we could have just ordered this dish, have our greens and that would be plenty enough for us. The meat cubes / short ribs are huge . But it was braised all through out soft and moist. Love it. ( 5 stars) 

The whole steam branzino fish- it was pretty good. But it seems like I was the only one enjoys it. We have half a fish not finished at the end of the meal. Although it says steamed, it's really not very steamed. It's more on the drier side and seems more baked. Which i dont mind. I like the lemon taste on it, because I am afraid of the fishy ocean taste. It's actually fairly well down considering cooking such a big fish to not let the meat went soggy, and maintain the fish taste with good dressing. Except it is not quite steamed, which my friend wished it was. Overall 4 stars.

The rotisserie chicken- I think it was an epic fail. The big pieces are very very dried. The fried bones are super salty. Nothing of us can eat a full piece to ourselves. We ended up sending it back to the kitchen. We have the whole chicken almost untouched. 
In exchange we asked to try their ginger scallion noodle. It was a cold noodle with shiitake mushroom. It was another average dish, the flavors are good, but it was a bit on the oily side. Each of us could only do a small bite without feeling greasy. 

Last but not least, their Chinese broccoli is very good. A typical Chinese style fried broccoli, not overcook, crunchy, and not over salty either. 

Overall, I feel like people who gave good reviews are there for lunch instead of dinner. The Ambience is very nice, but the portions are very large and expensive. I much rather it be a smaller portion and shaved off the price a bit instead. They have lazy Susan on most table and intended it to be a family style sharing plates. I'd like to sample more dishes than to be over power by the portions they give.and I actually wanted more new American food then it being mostly Asian style allover then place.",hQ87ZnXIhsF_B3ygXdQslw,5,5,3,TeyKnPd7UDFmb3SjmjSWbg

This is a Japanese restaurant located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. As we walked towards the restaurant, we noticed there was a line outside. I breathed a sigh of relief as we walked in straight to the hostess stand to claim our reservation spot. From the outside, there wasn't much place to wait, aside from standing near a bordering wall since to the left of the restaurant opening is Milk. 

Interior = 5/5
Upon entering the restaurant, we passed through individuals munching away in the bar before entering the actual restaurant space. I liked the lighting in the restaurant which (I felt) was attributed to the large panel windows, which we were lucky enough to be seated by. I think this would be so relaxing on a rainy day (we just had cloudy, but I was okay with that).

Service = 5/5
Our server was bubbly, and she recommended some options that were not on the menu that we decided to order. She also would check on us a bunch of times. 

Order = 4/5
Yuzu lemonade: 5/5
We are biased because we like anything yuzu and citrus-y. Boyfriend liked it because it wasn't too sweet or tart, or watered down. It was a nice balance to the alcoholic drink we got.

Dancing Daisy: 4/5
I was a little nervous when I read it had artichoke and chocolate - I was like whoa there. The server described it as an earthy tasting drink, and a popular one at that. When it came, I stared at the drink as it was topped with pepper. I was also trying to see if I could see the artichoke (don't know why). The drink smelled refreshing, and when you drank it there was a subtle aftertaste of chocolate.

Big Eye Tuna: 5/5
First time we had foie gras! We liked this appetizer and wished they gave more, but I can see how the foie gras can be too rich in higher amounts. The foie gras would literally melt as we are eating it, so I would use tuna to scoop it up. The asian pears brought a crunch to the plate, since everything else was soft. 

Wagyu bao: 3/5
It was good, meat was soft. The flavors were nice. It only came with one bao - which for the price I was hoping for two. Overall it was okay.

Black Truffle Ramen: 3/5
The size was a nice if for one person. We shared but it worked out because we got other items. It was good, but I felt it was over hyped. You can taste the truffle. I liked the broth because it was light but I feel like the meat could be softer and more quantity. 

Overall = 4/5
It was a nice atmosphere and place to eat. We enjoyed the appetizers a little more than the ramen we had, but that may just mean we have to come back and try another!

Hint = make reservations ahead of time to avoid the line! Also if the truffle ramen is available, the server said it is very limited in availability through the year (the last time it was offered was January 2017).",EokuKeU16okP6LJnOo4AjQ,1,1,4,Vjcmrjusj9BvQaAREI_W8g

Bo Ssam - it's a slow braised pork. Half order serves about 4-6 people. It comes with rice, kimchi,  6 half shell oysters, lettuce, and special house sauce.

But it was totally worth trying the pork belly and shrimp buns.  The pork belly bun is a must try.  It's unbelievably tendered and flavorful.  I would totally come back again to order just the pork belly buns.   The shrimp is a must try too.   It was fresh and flavorful with a good size shrimp.   The shishito peppers was nicely season with a side of spicy sauce.  The spicy kick was nice and different from other shishito peppers I have had.   

Overall it was a great experience.  I would come back here again to try more dishes.",fDSFrpf8949UJVNbG3rGgQ,2,2,4,dhgNozsFrsS8e5OxcNOiFg

3322547,2017-11-22,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Momofuku is definitely an Asian restaurant, I'm not sure why Yelp categorizes it as American...? Most of the food here was great and flavorful, but the prices are too steep for what you get. I guess everything in Vegas is just super inflated....

We ordered a pork bun for each person at our table and it wasn't worth the $7 price that we paid. It was good but underwhelming for what you get. I've had better Pork Belly baos. 

We also ordered 2 Pork Ramens for the table to share. It came covered in green onions and mixed greens which was overwhelming for me. The Pork Ramen here was just a very interesting combination of flavors for me and the broth was too salty for my taste. Overall, very confusing bowl of ramen in terms of ingredients included.

For the fancier folk. the Truffle Ramen is available and it's worth a try, but paying $50 for a bowl of ramen is VERY steep and I doubt I would order it again. So for all you truffle lovers, this one is definitely for you.  

If you're dining with a larger party, I recommend getting their Bossam, which is Braised Pork Belly served with butter lettuce, oysters, kimchi, ginger green onion sauce, hoisin and their house sauce. The way they prepare their pork is different than other Korean restaurants because it's not boiled down then sliced. It arrives at your table in all of it's 2 pound glory, smothered in sauce and served with tongs for shredding. Yes it's 2 lbs so it's more than enough food for 5-6 people, even 8 people if you're ordering other items on the menu. I do recommend getting it for larger parties because it racks up to be about $130+ for one order. This was probably the best thing I ate that day and I would come back just to eat this with my group, but probably nothing else.",BBv8OzOwgIMOpnVoFN6u3w,2,0,4,smduYLeMimvOulIkhbYv_g

3332834,2017-10-24,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Momofuku definitely seems Vegas-sized as compared to a typical David Chang Momofuku. Prices are 15-20% higher than they should be.  However, the restaurant itself really has the flair of a Cosmo locale and the inside area with noodle bar and restaurant are really exquisite.  Momofuku Vegas offers opportunity for tapas-style experience, like I had, or a family meal.  The menu has multiple buns, some ramen (though off-menu during dinner, can still be ordered), noodles, and large plates.  The bun exterior is fantastic, chewy goodness, while the shrimp and chicken innards underwhelmed as compared to the perfectly cooked and large pork belly bun.  Couple in some ssam sauce, which has a nice kick but won't burn your mouth, and you got a winner.  The ramen noodles were perhaps the bestin town.  The broth was less flavorful or spicy than I was hopingbut still very good.  As far as the soup accompaniments, the meat was the best in town, as it should be at $18 a bowl.  It included some ground pork and pork belly.  But the veggies were just average in the soup.  The shishito peppers were a niceappetizer as well.  Drinks weer fine and Asian-infused, but nothing spectacular, especially at about $17 each.  Overall it's a very good meal but I was not blown away.  You can get out of there at a very affordable or a very expensive meal depending on your feeling, which is nice in Vegas, as your pocket can stay intact even with good food.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,__bOiWN2ZghDTpxszkoerg

3356453,2017-02-20,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"We were a bit disappointed by the majority of the dishes here, with most of the dishes being relatively bland and uninteresting. Of the dishes we tried, we liked the smothered katsu chicken the most, however you've had better katsu chicken (panko crusted fried chicken) elsewhere. The thing that made this dish interesting was the shiitake mushroom gravy, making it almost like a chicken fried steak. The gravy tasted like there might have been a bit of Japanese worchestershire sauce in it, which added an interesting tartness to the dish that was appreciated. I'm a sucker for gravy and for chicken fried steak, so I was happy with this dish.

Unfortunately, everything else was wholly underwhelming and monotonic. The shrimp buns were essentially shrimp cakes stuffed inside of a Chinese bun (the type served with Pekin duck). The shrimp cake was fine. It tasted like shrimp and that was essentially it. The description noted that there was a spicy mayo and pickled red onions. While these sounded like a great addition, the mayo was essentially like plain mayo and the pickled red onions were missing in flavor. The dish could have benefited from the tartness and sweetness of pickled red onions but alas these flavors were missing. The Chinese bun was also a bit lack luster. There was none of the sweetness and fluffiness that is normally in these buns.

We also tried the pork ramen which again was disappointing. Being from the Los Angeles area, we are spoiled by a plethora of great ramen, with great ramen being a perfect pairing of noodle, broth and ingredients. If you are expecting a tonkatsu based broth with flavor built from hours of simmering pork bones, you will be sorely disappointed. Here, the broth is completely lackluster, tending toward a weak soy sauce and bonito flake-based broth. It is too monotonic in flavor without added complexity, tending too much toward the use of bonito flakes making the broth fishier than it needs to be. The noodles were the standard Japanese noodles. The pork shoulder also had an odd bonito flake flavor to it and was too dry. The pork belly was fine but definitely not the best you've had.

Our waiter really sold the spicy cucumber calling it the ""best pickle you'll ever had"". So obviously with this much of a sell, the result was going to be disappointment. If you think of this dish as a cucumber with a sprinkling of some chile flakes, then you will be less disappointed. If you were expecting a tasty Japanese tsunomono pickle with an enticing combination of sweet and tart, then you will be disappointed. We were disappointed, as we wanted more complexity in flavor.

For dessert, we tried several items that were essentially from the Momofuku Milkbar next door to the restaurant. The cereal milk soft serve was a bit disappointing as we've had the cereal milk shake at McConnell's Ice Cream. There, the cereal milk shake reminded you of the real reason why you ate Tony's Frosted Flakes as a kid, for the cereal milk residue after the frosted flakes had given of themselves completely for the greater good, before wilting into soft flabby corn flakes. Here, the cereal milk soft serve tasted more like they used regular old generic ""great value"" corn flakes without any of the frosted glory that accompanies premium Tony's Frosted Flakes. The results were, alas, disappointing. We also tried the crack pie which was made with butter and brown sugar. It was overly sweet and tough to eat more than a couple of bites, until my wife came up with the genius idea of combining the underwhelming cereal milk soft serve with the cavity inducing crack pie. The sweetness helped the lackluster cereal milk soft serve and the soft serve tempered the overly sweet pie. Finally, we tried the corn flake and marshmallow cookie. It is hard to describe this, but it was not pleasant. We usually finish everything but this was not edible, so we ended up not even finishing a third of this cookie.

I think if you are okay with subtle monotonic flavors, then you will find this place reasonable. For us, it was underwhelming with the exception of the smothered katsu chicken, but again you'd had better katsu chicken elsewhere.",izLeU7SgRLNA0QLiBEYbYA,1,0,3,ftvyvdC0rmyJrI8UfD99ug
3363765,2018-05-06,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"We have been here twice now- once around when they first opened and just recently. Overall, the food is good and high quality but I think it's more hype than it's worth. Slightly different? Yeah, but this is not some sort of earth shattering experience. There's a lot better places in Vegas for way less money. 

We had a hankering for some ramen and decided to stop in here for a late night dinner. Apparently they don't have ramen on the menu for dinner anymore but they will normally accommodate if you request it (apparently) so we had the pork ramen. It was very good but not anything special enough to write home about. Granted, I have some high standards when it comes to ramen. This was in the top but not THE top, I'll put it that way (the top spot is reserved for Magokoro in Albuquerque).

We also had their oysters and split a pork bun to see how they measured up to others we've had. Everything was great but generally overpriced for what you get. A dozen oysters was $46. There wasn't anything special about them and the sauce/vinegar? (whatever you call it) was just ok. The service was fantastic though. Apparently they also charge you for plain water which is annoying. It was only $2 but to be nickle and dimed at a place this expensive is just plain bad form in my opinion.

What's the point of asking if we're celebrating a special occasion when you're just going to forget about it and not do anything?  I will say their pork in general was really juicy but the slow service and lack of attention ruined our experience.  

Our baos and appetizers came out fairly quickly and we ended up waiting half an hour for our ramen and ssam to come out.  They did give us some extra appetizers, but after thirty minutes of waiting, I wasn't really hungry anymore.  

Pork bao was juicy and fatty, but for $7 I expected a bigger bun.  

Brussel Sprouts & Cauliflower was bitter AF and burnt.  The worst thing we ordered.  

The pork ramen was not worth the wait and most of us didn't finish it.  If you've ever had ramen in Japan, just don't bother coming here.  You'll be unimpressed.

The Pork Ssam was recommended by our server.  The pork was tender but the thing came with literally three lettuce wraps.  Someone needs to tell their chef to check the pork to lettuce ratio.

Then she ran to some where to do her cleaning and totally ignored us, she seems a bit to hyper to wait for getting off from work. Some of the servers came in and asked her what's her plan for tonight. They just like chatting a lot during work and  obviously, more servers around than customers. The male bar tender was cleaning, and serve us with a black face all the time. Maybe he didn't have a good day. When we asked to taste the reisling which was from Austria and the other was Germany.

3383780,2018-01-04,1,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"So was in vegas to search for lady luck at the gambling games before reigning in the new year. Unfortunately I was not as lucky as I had hoped but fortunately I had the opportunity to go on a ""cheat week"" for my diet and ended up eating at a bunch of spots which brings us to momofuku located in the cosmo. I had been hankering lately for momofuku in NYC so this seemed like a good spot to make the first dinner night while in Sin City. I made a reservation and got seated right on time. The server was extremely friendly and took the time to explain the full menu and provided her own favorites with detail which certainly helped. The joint itself is a classy affair with nice tables and nice décor adorning the walls on the second floor of the cosmo. 

The menu consists of a raw bar, small plates, buns, country ham, noodles, sides, meat & seafood, and the large format dining things. My party was not large enough to order the large format dining items but the table next to us had enough people for the fried chicken  and caviar and our mouths were watering the entire time we saw them eating. Make sure to order these in advance and call the restaurant as it is not prepared on the fly and takes some advance notice it seems. It seems like 3 - 4 dishes is probably good for two people depending on what you order of course but my table went with the Big eye tuna with foie shavings, black truffle ramen, the Sichuan lamb ribs, and a side order of Brussel sprouts which ended up being more than enough for two. They also have a solid Japanese whiskey menu so of course I went with my whiskey ways and ordered a few of these bad boys. The big eye tuna was first and it was delicious. The tuna was quite fresh and oh man.. those foie shavings were on point. It took me a lot of restraint to not lick the foie right off the plate. The truffle ramen (priced at $50) was really solid. It is not your standard ramen to expect from a place like ippudo but a true fusion blend. The truffle was faint but it was well balanced into the ramen itself. It was definitely a unique experience and definitely worth a try at least once if you are searching for a fusion ramen. The noodles were slightly overcooked vs what I normally like but still solid. The Brussel sprouts were good but it was a bit too salty after a few bites.  The Uni sauce on top made it tasty for the first few bites but the salt started overpowering half way through the side dish making it hard to eat in large helpings. The star and surprise of the night was certainly the Sichuan lamb ribs. I was hopeful for this dish but did not know what to expect. The ribs came out with great presentation adorned with jalapenos. The meat was cooked perfectly and absolutely tender and the chili yogurt was the perfect complement to the heat that was brought by the spices. The cucumbers on the bottom also provided a nice texture balance to the overall tenderness of the meat. It really was delicious and is perfect for those searching for some heat.

All in all, a solid experience at momofuku. It is not truly Asian but offers that nice Asian fusion blend that I am sure people could be searching for especially after all those  buffets and heavy American food options around.

The interior is nice and modern and they have a well stock bar with lots of Japanese whiskey. We ordered the following: 

- Spicy cucumbers - very refreshing,  the togarashi over the nuts gave it a different taste
- shishito peppers - did not have the grilled marks,  but was served with smoked salt - tasted pretty good
- 5 spice rotessiere duck - a definite stand out and super flavorful (also was the longest dish we had to wait for) 
- slow roasted pork shoulder - the meat literally falls apart when you use your utensil to grab it; goes well with the kimchi and lettuce
- shoyu pork ramen - it came out kind of lukewarm and seemed to have a lot of things in it. I was not too impressed with it.

Our server and other people serving in the dining area were all friendly and pleasant. Water glasses are always filled, your napkin is folded when you leave the table, they ask if you have questions. The place does get loud but the décor is beautiful. I love the view of the strip from our table. They have a seating area that you climb some steps to get too and there is a sliding sort of wooden window that they can close for privacy if you have a private party or open for just casual dining.

We ordered (1) chicken karaage buns - the burst of flavors in this bun is wonderful. The bun itself is soft and sweet which contrast perfectly against the crispiness and 
savory flavor of the chicken. This is a must!
(2) Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes - pork sausage, broccoli, crispy onions. We had no idea what to expect with this dish and it surprised us in a great way. The mix of textures and flavors are amazing. A winner.
(3) Pork Ramen - pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg. This is not the ramen I am accustomed to. It is not as fatty and flavorful as the tonkotsu ramen that I prefer but it was also good. I love how al dente the noodle is.

Everything else was beyond disappointing  Of the three ramen we tried, the pork ramen was the best. Keep in mind, that's relative to our other dishes. We also tried the $58 bowl of black winter truffle. I liked how the truffle added a different layer of flavor to the broth, but the noodle used really ruined the bowl for me. The noodle is not the traditional, curly ramen noodle. Instead, it was bit thicker and the texture was hard, which made it almost resistant to the broth it swam in. The chicken shiitake ramen was the worst of the three ramen. I can't even describe the mushroom sauce that devoured the chicken katsu patty. Why?!? The pork belly buns were very tasty and the only thing that left me wanting more. We ordered a side of the pork belly since the buns were so delicious. We wanted to enjoy it with our ramen bowls. The dish came out at the end of our meal when we were done with our noodles. The food service was very disappointing. The restaurant was more than half empty. The table next to us arrived after but finished their meal before our noodles even arrived. The kitchen seemed disorganized. Our noodles came out at different times. I'm so disappointed.

There were seven of us at Momofuku, visiting Vegas celebrating our nephew's 21st birthday. We made it point to have lunch at Momofuku located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  We ordered, then the food arrived for all except me. I mentioned it to the waiter who said it would be coming.  Time passed and everyone was nearly done eating.  The waiter came by again, offered me another beer (at an extra charge) and said my food was coming. I waited longer and no food.  Next time the waiter came by I told him I was going to McDonalds and I left.  My wife said a manager came by after I left and asked how our lunch was.  My wife complained about my food never arriving.  The manager only said ""sorry, the kitchen is very backed up "".  No offer of a discount or a free drink, nothing.

The service was great when we needed water or extras but our server did initially take awhile to come around to get our orders. 

Other than that, the food was good but didn't really blow my mind. The pork ramen ... was pork ramen. The pork belly was good and fatty (a bit too fatty) and the broth was flavorful, but the noodles were meh and overall this dish fell flat. The chicken karaage bun, however, was delicious! The dropped off a Korean chili sauce that I slathered all over the chicken and it was really good; perfectly fried and juicy.

The music was crazy loud, so much so our server could barely hear us and we weren't able to talk much with each other but the food made up for that 100%.  Maybe my husband and I just aren't cool enough for such a hip scene.  We'd rather talk and enjoy some quiet than hear subwoofers.

However the food was everything we hoped it would be and more!  We started with a steamed pork belly bun.  It was sweet and salty pillowed between the softest bun and tender pork.  The shishito peppers were also fantastic, though they needed some salt which was nowhere to be found.  The curried jerk chicken was out of this world.  Oh my goodness I will dream about it.  The accompanying fresh herbs were so delicious mixed with it.  This was so divine we set our tableware aside and dug in with our fingers.  It was so satisfying.  The chilled noodles were out of this world.  I was concerned about the sausage (not always a big fan) and in the end it was one of my favorite elements.  My only complaint was we needed more noodles!  We could have each eaten our own bowl.  It was so fantastic.  This meal was incredible and on my list of top favorite meals I've had.

+ Friendly waiters 

- the spicy cold noodles that I had were flavorful ( lots of basil) but the sechuan sausage was simply too salty ( I could not make our the sechuan flavor at all). The noodles were clumped up and the creaminess of the sauce became too heavy, even with the jalapenos.

3445405,2017-04-16,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"If I had to only say one word about this place to entice your stomach to go on a culinary adventure that will blow your tastebuds away... KATSU!!!!!!! This doesn't describe this place as a whole in one word but it really tells the story of why I will always return to this place. The one reason, the one taste, the one and only thing on my mind when someone says katsu. I've never tasted such a universal staple dish of cuisine such as katsu that tasted nothing like its original form (or at least what I think katsu should taste like). 

As I took my first bite of crispy chicken smothered with the rich creamy mushroom filled sauce I thought someone had given me a Japanese flared version of jaeger schnitzel. This was such an unexpected flavor but I love German food so much and Japanese curry changed my life. Someone perfectly molded these two flavors together and added their own personality as well. You must taste for yourself!!! Go right now!!! Don't wait for the world to end and for you to have missed an epic one of a kind dish. Restaurants in my eyes have those one or two dishes that make me go back. I've told you about one of these so far; now it's on to the next dish that blew my mind. 

Brussels... Brussel sprouts to me are a lot like cauliflower; they take any flavor you throw on them. If correctly executed they can explode like an atom bomb of layered flavors. The flavors had more layers then a f$&@ing foot tall lasagna. This was a chefs special I'm not even sure if this was on the menu but they set it down and I couldn't get enough. They didn't even look like Brussels to be honest. This could've been how they cooked them or the seasonings, perhaps a bit of both. Bottom line this is the second dish that will keep me coming back for more you must have these!!! 

On to the rest of what we had, I've already told you what you have to eat here but I'll touch base on the other dishes as well. 

Pork belly buns best I've ever had. I'm gonna go ahead and list off the other places I've had pork belly buns at on a regular basis

-district one
-bachi burger
-about seven other places but were not good enough for me to write on this list

Ya um the even tenderness of the slice of pork on these buns this is why it's better and on another level then the places listed above; this makes you able to only take one bite without having the whole rest of the pork slide out of the bun. The flavor was so epic totally what a pork bun should have.

They also had a special fried softshell crab bun. Softshell crab is something people underuse in restaurants today. It's just as tasty as fried chicken but without the hassle of picking the meat off a bone. Thumbs up to momofuku for putting the softshell on the menu and in a bun it deserves.

So I'm not going to touch base on the other items we had here mainly because the pictures will speak for themselves and I've told you what you have to order already. In case you forgot KATSU & BRUSSELS...

Nuff said OH I forgot to mention the ramen silly me.

Honorable mention

-pork ramen was very on point super clean execution on the flavor of the broth, texture of the noodles and the two kinds of pork (pork belly pulled pork wtf? I know delicious idea). No ramen is complete without a perfectly cooked egg. In this case a slow poached egg that you pierce with your chop sticks and swirl around the richness of that yolk to enhance that already spectacular whirlwind of flavors. Mmm...

If you have read this far seriously let me finish by saying don't wait okay. Just do your stomach a flavor!!!",KxIIh-zfn3_Sr8b199Zn5Q,0,0,5,l4fBw3E0b9Bn9QtAfvtEZg

3445651,2017-03-27,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Located inside The Cosmopolitan, which for the time being still offers free parking.

I came with a co-resident to celebrate the end of our month of night float together. We made a reservation for two for Wednesday at 6:30PM about a week before dining. The restaurant is actually fairly spacious inside (though it doesn't look so from the entrance), but given the popularity, I would probably recommend making a reservation or else be prepared for a long wait. The interior is gorgeous and very sleek/modern. This restaurant is still only a few months old, after all.

Our server checked on us regularly and explained a lot to us. He was friendly but then we overheard him make an almost identical spiel to a neighboring table, so it felt somewhat scripted. 

The menu is not too large, and there are some very tasty looking ""large format"" meals on the backside good for larger groups. Things can get very pricey, but there are also more moderately priced and filling dishes such as ramen.

My co-resident and I decided to splurge and share a bunch of dishes, including three desserts. We ended up spending about $90 each, though you definitely easily could have spent both more or less, depending on what you ordered.

My yuzu lemonade was sweet and fragrant, but definitely not sour enough for me for a lemonade, and it was not a very big glass for $8 (plus had a good amount of ice).

The ""bao"" were tasty, though to be honest, I picture a closed circular bun when I hear the word ""bao,"" not the open faced kind that these are. Sure, the buns as served here are a type of bao, but I would not default to this type with the word bao alone (but I'm biased by Chinese usage).

The steamed whole branzino was the winner of the night, with extremely tender meat. Although it was described as steamed, it was probably steamed to cook but then pan-seared to finish. 

Overall, the food is tasty, but I would describe it as Asian-inspired more than Asian fusion, as the dishes still felt primarily western.

The desserts were tasty too and from Milk Bar next door, though many items were a bit sweet for my tastes.  

Overall, I can see what all the hubbub is all about, and I would definitely recommend trying Momofuku out; now you don't have to travel to the East Coast to do so!",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,4,0,4,lB__HgBDK5v_OxSMZXYAYA

The lamb ribs had a white sauce that was delicious and perfect. The Brussels sprouts and broccoli had a mildly spicy fish sauce seasoning that I really enjoyed as well. The pork belly in the pork bun was very tender and you can dip it in their house sauce. I wouldn't recommend the pork ramen because it tastes very ordinary and you can get it elsewhere for much cheaper than $17. The crack pie is also a must try if you have room for dessert.

3524616,2017-01-29,5,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"As of this review I've been here twice! The first time was with my friends for a birthday celebration and the second time with my family.

First experience:
We made a reservation since we couldn't get a seat the first time! Luckily it wasn't crowded this time since it was on a weekday. We ordered a bunch of stuff including the pork belly and chicken kaarage buns, chicken noodle soup, pork ramen, spicy tofu squares, pork chops, and 2 cookies (corn and compost). I really liked the chicken noodle soup since the broth had a good amount of flavor and didn't taste salty. I got a good amount of noodles and chicken which got me full! The pork belly ramen broth was smokey and a little too salty for my taste. The buns are a must try if you ever go here! I normally don't like eating pork belly since it is fatty, but it was really good here. I'd stay away from the corn cookie. We ordered it since it seemed unique and interesting but it literally tasted like butter (I wonder how much butter is in one cookie haha). The other cookie was okay but definitely not worth the $3. We got some milkshakes from Milk bar next door so if you want a dessert after your meal just go there! I really liked our waitress since she was so nice and had a lot of recommendations. She didn't pressure us to order anything although we did get a bunch of stuff since we were in a celebratory mood haha.

Second experience:
I made a reservation for my family and I at 8:30 p.m. and we weren't seated until 8:45 p.m. which wasn't too bad except for the fact that the front desk people were letting the other 8:30 parties ahead of me despite me checking in before they did. So when I asked how much longer it was going to take until we could go in, they proceeded to let me in. They either forgot about me or they just seat people who keep asking them when their table is ready. I ordered the ginger scallion noodle dish which was pretty good! It's a brothless vegetarian friendly dish with a bunch of flavor. The only sucky part is how oily it is towards the end since the oil sinks to the bottom of the bowl. The last few bites of the dish might not be worth eating unless you like your veggies saturated with the oil. The waiter was pretty friendly but I didn't like how he kept trying to make me order cocktails or wine when I just wanted water. One of my pet peeves is when the wait staff tries to get you to order more things when you clearly are not interested lol.

Overall I'd recommend checking this super popular place if you are in the area. If you are planning to visit during the weekend (including Friday) be sure to get a reservation. My first experience was really awesome and it made me want to come back and show my family how great this place is, but unfortunately my second experience was a bit underwhelming. 

P.S. Now you have to order buns in pairs! You can't get them individually anymore which kinda sucks lol. Also, they have some of the dessert items from the Milk bar next door but they don't have the milkshakes. They do have cookies and the soft serve though!",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,5,4,3,9EUMt8WjGXh2p8X7iUnDtQ

I've tried his restaurant in New York City before an I thought it was descent, so when I found out that he had a restaurant in Las Vegas I had to try it too. My bf ordered the pork ramen, and I got the spicy noodles. Neither of the dishes were good. I've had better instant ramen than what we got here. My spicy noodles was worse, the noodles were flavorless. It actually tastes like they just boiled the noodles, topped it with red chili peppers, very peppery meat, some chopped Thai basil, and roasted cashews. Worse noodles I've ever eaten. I would never come back again. Very sad with the food we got I couldn't even finish the noodles. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",Pr6ptRseGaVuhzaT9nYrvw,0,0,1,oHpaXi3B4S0L5pI-VDr0_w

I can honestly say there improving with the food but as for the service SERIOUSLY SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET IT MORE ORGANIZED!!! or you can just hire a new manager that can train there employees to provide better service. I say your really killing the stars. Ill get to that later but lets start off with the food. 

----The FAMOUS buns:
I tried the pork belly bun. my first time it was bad it was greasy I couldn't really taste anything besides the oil so bad it felt like I should of took my napkin and dabbed it off lol.. but as for the second time I visited it was PERFECT pork cooked real good and the toppings was just enough on the bun.

Chicken Karage first time there was so much spicy mayo I had to take a spoon took some off and it was good. But second time no complaints bun was on point. And love the pickled red onion blended very well with it.

I guess you can say and tell that the cooks who did it some seems like they do a sloppy job just for the money but others that does it so perfectly because they love doing what they do as a chef. And I heard they use to do one bun for $7 but now 2 buns for $7. I got charged wrong I'm guessing the FOH needs to be updated on whats going on.

---- Oysters on the 1/2 shell (bonji mignonette) 
love love love everything lol
along with the yellowtail Sashimi (yuzu ponzu, basil, ginger) Cant go wrong with that.

---- Noodles:
Ginger Scallion Noodles && Pork Ramen
There both okay I mean you really cant go wrong with ramen I just assume itd be different somehow someway but ramen is ramen.

---- Smothered Katsu Chicken (Shitake gravy, black pepper)
Yummy Yummy Yummy. the price for it sheesh no comment lol bit up there but its okay.

I'm assuming everytime you go and eat here the way the food tastes and is presented all depends on whos cooking it. overall the stars jus goes up and down for me.",c6Jlu_pwsqQH1BJuK0ub_w,1,1,4,0wvex0v43CkTP12DJMWXWg

Ordered the pork ramen and the pork gua bao. Hands down one of the saltiest ramen bowls I have ever had. The pork belly slice was a bit undercooked for my taste. If I am gonna eat that much fat, I want it to at least have some good flavor. 

The gua bao was average. Seemed like the kitchen was trying to recreate a recipe and halfassed it. They put this sour/spicy vinegar based ssam bar bbq sauce on the table for your bun almost to try and mask the fact that the pork bun was mass created and attention to detail or unique flavors lost in the sea of people they have to serve in this giant restaurant.

All in all it all seemed, as David Chang loves to say ""tremendous."" Tremendously underwhelming, and if we are talking about the ramen tremendously salty. 

This Vegas chain screams tourist money grab. Honestly my personal opinion is that momofuku shouldn't be serving ramen or gua bao because I would hate for someone who has never had either to come eat this and think that this is what it is supposed to taste like.",5wQRxVk6PuOaoiXJbhPq1Q,0,0,2,rJ-xXOkjo2CyiWGzUAWreQ

Japanese fusion, and that would normally make me not want to go. That fact that it is inside the Cosmopolitan is probably the best reason I went. What is the nicest thing I can say about the Cosmopolitan? ---- The fact that they have never told me or any guest I have ever recommended visit there ""No"". They bend over backwards to please.

Advanced reservations are required. Unless, like all of Las Vegas, you have friends in Low, High, and in between places. Friday and Saturday nights the place is always fully booked. 

The wife and I grabbed two seats at the bar while waiting for a group of friends to meander to the Cosmo-Aria connection. The bartender took excellent car of us and a quick snack rapidly turned into a full meal.  We chose a Daiginjo Dake that was awesome and was recommended by the bartender. Momofuku oysters as appetizer, pork ramen, dry roasted mussels and summer truffle ramen as main course.

 Did chef David Chang kick off the ramen boom in Las Vegas? Don't know because I brought my craving for it with me from long, long ago. Momofuku is made of glass, wood, steel and concrete, grabbing a corner of Cosmo's second floor. The deserts come from the Milk Bar next door. Didn't try one, but they looked spectacular. 

Momofuku's vast range makes it special in Las Vegas. The Strip might have everything you can think of now, but it doesn't have many restaurants where you can find a perfect $20 bowl of noodles for lunch and come back at night to share edgy large-format presentations like the vaunted fried chicken and caviar. I had the same reaction you are having now when I first heard about Fried Chicken and Waffles in Hollywood California. Why not Fried Chicken and Caviar?

Read somewhere that Chang was excited to play in Las Vegas. Hopefully he's enjoying himself so far. We sure did, and first chance we get we will go back and try the Fried Chicken and Caviar.",ThgkcL2WD-V2VFPiYhK4fQ,1,1,4,6U8YcmD3tQupfcR4ji5Anw

We also ordered the spicy cucumbers which came with roasted nuts and this green purée. It was really good and refreshing. I like ordering cucumber appetizers at restaurants because of the clean crisp taste and it isn't heavy so it never ruins the main course. 

We also order the pork belly bao, which personally was whatever. I was expecting a thicker cut of pork belly but instead it was two thinly sliced pieces of meat. It was a little disappointing.

It was quite likely the best crafted cocktail I had that visit to Vegas (Thanks Levi - she was our bartender/waitress).

To note - if you don't have reservations - getting seated may be grim.  We showed up 30 minutes before they opened to secure a spot at the limited full menu noodle bar seating (which also gives you a good view of the kitchen).  Bar seating is available too with a more limited menu.

We arrived during Social Hour at 5:10pm and opted to be seated immediately on the bar facing the kitchen.  I wondered allowed (in total dismay) at where the mussels were on the menu, and someone in the kitchen shared that they are of course served at dinner (starting at 5:30pm) and not during Social Hour.  

We were in a time crunch (and not because we were trying to keep within the complimentary parking that ends after 1 hour -after that, up to 4 hours is $7 at the Cosmopolitan- so stay, enjoy your meal of course, but if you have somewhere else to be as we did, save that $7 for an extra bun!)  as we had somewhere else to be, so I was concerned we might end up mussel-less which is pretty ""weak"" sounding... ;-)

Alas, the same gentleman in the kitchen replied when I asked if we could be any chance order them early, ""well, sure.  Tell them I said its ok.""  WHEW!  Thanks dude!

The mussels were amazing....

REPEAT: ORDER THE MUSSELS.  STAT.

**Dry Roasted Mussels - benton's bacon, momofuku furikake

This is just genius.  BACON + MUSSELS (or MUSSELS + BACON - whatever) it's just a pairing that should have preceded PB&J and Bacon+Eggs.  (Or Bacon + anything.  It should have been Mussels first).

Smoky.  Amazing.

We also had the spicy chilled noodles- GET THESE TOO!  We'd like them a bit spicier next time, but that's a small quibble for the genius of sichuan sausage with cashew and jalapenos + thai basil. (PS- it says ""candied"" but ours didn't seem candied and we prefer it un-candied, so it was amazing the way it was.

**Chilled Spicy Noodles - sichuan sausage, thai basil, candied cashew

And of course we had a pork belly bun.  Could have had 10.  2 nice little slices of pork belly in a little bun with hoisin sauce.  A little cucumber and scallion completing the taste perfectly.  Executed with such ease.  I really could have eaten about 3 of these and called it a day (except there are too many cool things on the menu)

**Pork Belly bun- hoisin, scallion, cucumber

Well done, David Chang, and gang.  

Shaun King, I'd like to shake your hand (except your hands have better things to do).

Really a great looking space inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. Has a nice view of the strip, especially from the Private/large group dining area.

A lot of the previous reviews mentioned problems with service. If my experience was any indication, it looks like those have been addressed. We had very solid service all the way from the Hostess to the wait staff and bartender. Service was friendly, fast and courteous.

On the menu for us this evening

Pork Belly Bun, and Chicken Karaage Bun - Both of these are exactly as amazing as you think they are. If I ate nothing else here, these would do.

Beet Salad with Citrus, rye XO sauce - This has the potential to be very very good. Tonight it was just alright. Desperately needed some nice large flake salt.

Ginger Scallion Noodles with pickled shiitake, cucumber, and wakame - This is a really simple and really good dish. I am not sure anything that would make anyone lose their mind but there is nothing you will ever say bad about it either! Satisfying is a great word!

Rotisserie Chicken & Fried Bones - The chicken was quite delicious! They use Jidori which is my absolute favorite. Super flavorful! The bones were a bit of a miss for me, just didn't work as well as I had hoped.

Back to staff, special kudos to the bartender. He stopped by to grab a couple of our plates and noticed my drink was low. Asked if I needed another and suggested an off menu option he had been playing with. It was great and well appreciated.

Couple of minor misses - plates could have been refreshed better between courses and there was a miss with getting utensils back to us at one point.

The pork belly ramen was good; the pork belly itself incredibly tender, the additional components I'd requested were fresh, and the poached egg proved itself a nice twist to the typical boiled egg. I did wish the broth was a bit more delectable as it didn't give me the deep flavor I was looking for in the dish. 

My only other complaint was the iced tea--watery. Tasted like a 'quick brew' had been done, the ice cubes watering down what flavor may have been there after the brew. I requested to exchange for a ginger ale instead--safe bet.

The excellent: 
* The buns were awesome. Like best part of the meal awesome. We had the pork belly, and the mushroom buns.

The good
* The Smoked egg and salmon egg appetizer (I forget the name). It was reallly good, but kind of mushy. Needed a little more texture to it. You have to like smokey things - My GF didn't like it
* The Kimchi chicken, and fried bones - The Kimchi was bomb, really good. The friend bones were delicious - super salty and crispy. The Dark meat chicken was good, but the breast meat was really dry, which kept this from being under the ""excellent"" category. 

The not so great:
* The Ramen! The pork belly ramen was pretty bland, and unexciting. I was going to order the one with truffles, and such, but I'm glad I didn't because I would have been extra disappointed I think. I've had much better ramen, pretty much everywhere honestly. It wasn't ""bad"", but for the price, and expectations, it really didn't hit the mark.

The lunch menu seems limited, mostly the options rest with the small plates and appetizers. We ordered the pork bun, mushroom bun, pork ramen and ginger noodles. The buns were springy and mouth watering, the noodles were cooked to perfection and not clumpy. I found the food to be very delicious and flavorful, the taste was rich without being cloying or overpowering.

I was impressed with the superb service. I saw other yelpers didn't get the same quality service which makes me sad, because everyone we witnessed at lunch today was on point. Chris and Jueen were our servers (they changed shifts in the middle of our meal) and they took great care of us. They did try to upsell cocktail drinks, but were discreet and never pushy which I appreciate. The bussers and food runners were attentive and gracious, our water glasses were never empty. What I like the best: everyone was keeping busy, staying attentive or being more engaging with the guests, even though the place wasn't busy. Nothing worse than seeing staff being lazy or ignoring people when business is slow. Thank you to everyone for the outstanding service!

Would I go out of my way to visit Momofuku? Probably not, but it is a nice option if you're already at the Cosmopolitan or want to experience a more upscale noodle experience for lunch.",W6eCwJposL5fN6DK_RewUw,0,0,4,mVx9jgjJiVQZdJdmc5o95g

My bf and I came for lunch, surprisingly it was a bit empty on a Sunday around noon. Love the decor and the space itself. I like the whole open kitchen concept as well. We started off with the pork belly bao and those were pretty good! I love the soft bao and the incredibly savory and soft pork belly. It literally melted in my mouth, the sauce they bring to the table, wasn't spicy and didn't do much for the bao. I would skip putting that on the bao. We got the spicy noodles with sausage, it was spicy but for some odd reason there were way too many cashews. Mixed together it somewhat reminds me of tantan mien due to the spice level, and I loved that! Only drawback was the overwhelming amount of cashews. The highlight of the meal was definitely the pork ramen! The broth was porky and flavorful, the pulled pork and egg were amazing and the noodles were good. Now this isn't Japan good, but it's good enough to satisfy a ramen craving. 


Everything is a bit on the pricy side, but it is vegas! I would definitely come back here to try dinner and get the wagyu steak!

My girlfriend and I are vegan, and I was worried that there wouldn't be enough plant-based options on the menu to offer a filling, satisfying meal. After reading some reviews where people mentioned that there are a few plant-based options on the menu, and the kitchen can make modifications to accommodate vegan diners, I decided to make Momofuku our dinner choice.

Been a fan of David Chang for a while and have always heard good things about his restaurants, so I was really excited to finally have an opportunity to dine at Momofuku.

I made the reservation through OpenTable and specified that we were looking for an all vegan meal. The hostess acknowledged our request at check-in, and our server was very knowledgeable breaking down our available options, and telling us what items could be modified to fit our dietary needs.

We came in at 930pm on a Thursday, and even with the reservation there was a short wait, but it wasn't a big deal. Just gave us an opportunity to grab some drinks at the bar. The bartender was great. Gave us menus and water the minute we sat down. Very attentive. 

The hostess sat us in a corner both along the Strip. We had windows that wrapped around that gave us a great view of the Strip with the ""Eiffel Tower"" in the background. Had a view of the entire restaurant from that perspective as well.

Food was great. One of the best meals we've ever had. I think as the menu changes daily, I don't think I'll go into detail, but nothing we ordered disappointed.

3687339,2018-02-01,1,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I went twice to this restaurant now.  And I can honestly say, the service and treatment I received between the 2 days was like night and day.  But let me start from the beginning.  The 1st time I visited this restaurant was on a Sunday night.  There was a steady crowd there, but the restaurant wasn't full.  

AMBIANCE:  Clean and trendy.  A little noisy since we were seated at the bar seats by the cooking area.  

SERVICE 1ST VISIT:  We were greeted by the hostess and seated by the cooks station.  We made contact with our waitress 3 times the whole time we were there: 1) to take our orders 2) when we were done with our meals, she came by to ask us if we wanted dessert 3) to deliver our bill.  Surprisingly the night wasn't completely horrible because we were seated in front of a very nice chef named Bob.  Bob was kind enough to have someone get us utensils when we asked him for some.  Bob took away our dishes when he noticed we were done.  At our request, Bob had someone bring us a dessert menu when our waitress failed to return with one.  He also engaged us with some small talk,  which made the visit more personable.  There was also another person that came by to fill our drinks.  So where was our waitress the whole time we were there?  I'd like to say she was busy with another customer, but I saw her hanging out by the cash register with other servers.  I'd give you her name, but she never told us her name to begin with.  Out of courtesy, we still tipped our waitress, but we left an even bigger tip for Bob who saved the day.

SERVICE 2ND VISIT:  We couldn't have asked for better customer service.  Every worker we encountered introduced themselves to us as they attended to our needs.  We had utensils without having to ask for them.  Our drinks were filled as needed.  And the staff came by more than once during our meal to make sure all our needs were attended to.  A couple staff members also engaged us in light conversation as we asked them questions.  Service was prompt, polite, attentive, and with a smile.

FOOD:  I have nothing negative to say about the quality and presentation and flavor of the food from both visits.  I don't get impressed very often when it comes to food, but Momofuku has made me a believer! They were absolutely delicious dishes! And just as creative and beautiful as they were mouth watering.  Please feel free to review all the photos I have included with this review to appreciate the craftsmanship of each dish.  Hats off to all the chefs!  

At the 1st visit, I ordered the Sichuan Lamb Ribs with smashed cucumber and chili yogurt.  I also ordered the Hamachi with bacon ponzu, fresno chilies, and sorrel.  My sister ordered the Chickpea Ramen with scallion, chickpea miso, and bok choy.  We shared a slice crack pie, which is a new found favorite for me.  

At the 2nd visit, we had the Honeycrisp Apple Salad with kimchi, maple labne, and without the bacon; the Shiitake bun with hoisin, scallion, and cucumber; Snapper with fennel, citrus, and Castelvetrano olives; Brussels Sprouts & Cauliflower with fish sauce vinaigrette, and chilies; Crispy Potatoes with truffle, garlic, crème fraiche; Smoked Shishito Peppers with salt and lime; Dry Aged Ribeye cooked medium rare with sesame and glazed root vegetables.  My sister had Roasted Black Cod with piquillo pepper, cabbage, and leek.  And of course, we had the crack pie again. 

OUR FAVORITE DISHES: The Hamachi with bacon ponzu, fresno chilies, and sorrel; Chickpea Ramen with scallion, chickpea miso, and bok choy; Shiitake bun with hoisin, scallion, and cucumber; Smoked Shishito Peppers with salt and lime; Roasted Black Cod with piquillo pepper, cabbage, and leek; and the crack pie.

If the service was severely lacking from our waitress the 1st time, why would we even bother to come back a second time?  We felt the management at the restaurant should know where improvements could be made with their customer service.  They in turn asked us to return to give them another try.  The manager we contacted stated what we experienced in our 1st visit was not the typical reflection of their services and would love to be given the opportunity to make it right.  And I am so glad we did.

CONCLUSION:  If I were to rate only my 1st visit, I'd give them 2 stars for the severe lack of customer service.  If i were to rate only my 2nd visit, I would have given them 5 stars.  With my overall experience, I rated them 4 stars.  1 star off because of the lack of customer service from the 1st visit.  Would I come here again?  YES.  Impeccable service during the 2nd visit and always phenomenal food.  Thank you Bob the chef and all the staff that made our visit to your restaurant memorable and delicious!",kYKL1VvoI8bHjuOyq2_yUg,1,1,4,65-cJrENqzf9G4-AFiHsMA

I liked how the bartender told us how to eat the egg (poke it a little and let the yolk run into the soup & noodles). Great idea!!! I'd definitely come back!

Anyway, my visit in April was terrible.  I sat at the bar that went right along the kitchen.  The service was subpar that visit.  I was also recommended a rice dish that I didn't particularly enjoy.  I don't remember what kind of chicken on a bed of rice type of dish it was, but the rice to chicken ratio just wasn't to my liking.  Overall, I felt like I was ignored and nobody really came and checked on me.  I clearly remembered these two hot girls sitting perpendicularly adjacent to me (I was at the end of the bar) at the bar and obviously they got tons of attention from the wait staff but who can blame them.  I had ordered an iced tea and I might have had one refill the entire night and that was after I had to call somebody over.

I heard too many good reviews that I had to try this place again.  Yet again, I sat at the bar again because I was by myself.  I ordered the pork belly bun and it was still amazing.  This time, I ordered the pork ramen which was off the menu.  The menu only had 2 cold noodle dishes listed but luckily my waitress said that the ramen did exist and the girl that sat next to me also had ordered it.
The components in the ramen were awesome, there was shredded pork, some veggies, a couple of soft boiled/poached eggs, and a wonderfully cooked piece of pork belly.  The pork belly had great texture to it.  The broth was amazing, the ramen were cooked to perfection.  I demolished that bowl of noodles like nobody's business.
This time around, the wait staff was much more attentive.  I got my water refilled a bunch of times, my waitress came and checked in on me.  It was also fun talking to the chefs and asking what they were making and cooking back there.  

I'm glad I gave Momofuku another chance.  I was bitter and angry at what happened at my first visit, but they made up for it this visit.",HmrLyqR8skk7ReB2vwJ4HQ,2,0,4,982qdbgAbeZ8_9WbtToRZA

Highlights were:

1. Wagyua Tri-Tip: perfectly cooked and seasoned. No complaints here, though I didn't eat it as a wrap! 
2. Chilled spicy noodles: perfect blend of flavors and just enough of a kick to make you go back for more. We demolished this plate.
3. Cauliflower and Brussel Sprout: a great side dish, full of flavor. A little salty when eating towards the bottom bc of the sauce.
4. Pork belly bun: just a good piece of pork belly and the bun is soft and delicious. Definitely recommend.

Lowlights:
1. The duck: i was most excited for this dish. I have duck pretty much anywhere that offers it. The duck itself was tougher than usual (even considering duck is usually tough) and the skin wasn't nearly as crispy as I'd like. The portion was ok, but for nearly $50 it was not worth the cost. We left about half on the plate because it left a bad taste in our mouths. They do put shredded duck on the same dish so that was Ok, but obviously not what you're paying a premium for. 

Honestly the overall experience was pretty good, and I'd recommend the restaurant generally, just wasn't too pleased with the duck which I was most excited about.

Also, expect to be at the restaurant for about two hours if you order the chicken and caviar. So worth it!
The service was exceptionally great this time. We had more then one server recommend how to eat the chicken and caviar, which was super helpful because we did not know where to start. I also brought my toddler son this time and the staff was so nice to us and made sure I had plenty to keep him entertained.

The food, in general, was fair, not amazing. We had dinner at Hakkasan last night and the food and service was outstanding! Momofuku's food and service does not even compare. Hakkasan is on a whole other level!

Back to Momofuku.....Our waiter was doing his best even though he had 3 large tables to cover and was bussing the tables himself.  Our waiter had a great attitude and did an amazing job given the staffing situation.  They have to figure out how to better staff their lunch staffing so that there is no lag in the service.

Nevertheless, we had a nice time celebrating with our family. However, on our way out, we simply asked the 3 hostess in the front to take a quick family picture in the front of the restaurant and all 3 gave us attitude. One reluctantly said she would but proceeded to tell us how busy they were at 2:30pm in the afternoon (after the lunch rush). There was no one standing in front of the restaurant waiting to be seated! There was no smile, just attitude.  This is what we will remember about our mom's birthday lunch where we just dropped over $500!

I came on a Friday night for an early dinner as a walk-in.  Luckily they had me seated at the kitchen counter so I had a good up-close look at the chefs in action.

Crudite Plate -- http://bit.ly/2vLhOo2
I ordered the Crudite Plate for my appetizer simply because after two full days in Vegas, I needed to get more vegetables in my system.  This was definitely a plate you want to share because it had a good amount of raw veggies, more than I anticipated.  And the two sauces that came with the veggies added a lot of flavor.

Shrimp Bun -- http://bit.ly/2vL3bkB
I liked the shrimp bun!  It was a good sized bun actually with a big crispy fried shrimp cake inside.  This was probably my favorite dish of the night and I wish I had ordered more than one.

Chicken Katsu -- http://bit.ly/2vLrjn2
The biggest disappointment for me was the chicken katsu.  This was partially my fault for ordering it without reading its description on the menu assuming it was something different.  I thought it was going to be smothered in gravy and mushrooms as I've seen in some earlier yelp pictures, but it didn't occur to me that they changed the recipe for the season which was more like a traditional chicken katsu entree that you can get an any standard Japanese restaurant.  I tried a little bit of it and it was okay, but because I was expecting something different, it killed my appetite for it.  Thankfully, they took back the katsu and let me order something else.

King Crab Cold Ramen -- http://bit.ly/2vKU2Zy
I decided to try the king crab cold ramen since I heard it was good from other reviews.  Plus, I'm a fan of cold ramen as well.  Well, it thought it was okay.  It had a decent amount of crab and the broth was tasty.  The only thing that bothered me about it was the $58 price tag for it which I'm not sure it was worth that much.  More like $30, but not $58.

I think for me, I probably would've enjoyed Momofuku more if I had just stuck with the street food options such as their buns and ramen.  The Shrimp Bun was really good and the other Bun options looked good as well.  I'm willing to go back and try them again though because it's very likely the menu will be changed again, and hopefully they'll bring back that Chicken Katsu with the mushrooms and gravy.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,25,20,3,6vOCzHUkEgRF1BK4j-P1vA

Our first waitress sat us down and was pretty nice. She told us what was good on the menu so we pretty much ordered what she recommended. 

It took awhile to get our food at least for half of the party. For some reason my family's order was taking a very long time. Maybe 20 mins after our other half of the party got their food. I kept asking the other waitress that came by every now and then when our food was going to arrive. I must've asked several times but was given a very rude ""it's almost here"" response. 

I kept waiting and my kids were very hungry and couldn't wait any more so I had to go ask for a manager after my attempts at getting my food was met with indifference. 

The manager came out and I talked to her explaining that we waited a long ass time for our food (over 40mins) and the restaurant wasn't that busy. 

The manager did not know how to handle the situation and was not apologetic at all. 

Our initial waitress came out and was the only one who was apologetic and tried to fix the problem and not the manager. She is the only professional person there who tried to make the dining experience pleasant. 

The food finally came out but to be honest it's really hard to enjoy it when you are pretty pissed. It could've been prepared by freakin David Chang himself but it wouldn't have placated me and my guests. 

My recommendation. The food is great but definitely don't bring kids here and don't expect it to be a great dining experience.

I'm usually partial to creamy tonkotsu-esque ramen but the darker, clear broth ramen they serve at Momofuku was incredibly flavorful! Noodles are thin but very chewy.

It's located in the Cosmopolitan. I did a reservation at 1:00 PM and we had no issues getting seated on time. All the workers here are very friendly. Our server was very attentive and great. 

Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 pork ramens ($17 each), 2 pork buns ($7 each), a wagyu ssam ($32), a chicken ssam ($29), and a cucumber salad ($9). A lot of food, but we wanted to try as much as we could since we're not in Vegas very often. The cucumber salad was really delicious. It was light with a bit of a citrus flavor and almonds in top. The pork ramen was really good too. The pork and broth both had a nice light, smokey flavor. The pork was well cooked and melted in your mouth. This goes the same with the pork belly buns. You can see that the pork belly was well marbled between the fat and meat so everything melted in your mouth. The wagyu ssam was good, but I advise you to cut it into 2-3 pieces when wrapping it in the butter lettuce and rice. It was hard to bite a piece of the meat when I wrapped it, kind of my fault for that haha. Chicken ssam was okay. It was cooked well, not too dry, but the seasoning was too salty for me.

Overall, food was good. I recommend the cucumber salad and pork ramen. If I were to ever eat here again, I would get those 2 items. Also, they charge you $1 per person for ""crysalli"" water. We were not aware that they charge $1 for water until we got the bill. But, we still had a good experience here.",0Mlo-jMvaQJnVgM2LXq7tg,0,0,4,79kbw0eEZ_cIPv8C7yOljQ

Oh, absolutely get the ""flask"" it's like 4 drinks in one and you get to keep the flask - aromatic, well-balanced, a very nice drink. Had to deduct a star after trying our two neighboring tables' food. The branzino was past it's ""best by"" date and a little fishy, its sauce wasn't as balanced as the flavors on our table. The pesto with the sausage noodles wasn't an expected combination, but it was fine. The flank steak, I couldn't even finish the small bite shared with me it was so tough and flavorless. No joy in that dish. Salt+pepper seafood was salty as expected. I saw a table send back the shishito peppers for being far too salty, but I didn't try them. I could visually see the salt-dusting on top was excessive. If I hadn't tried the other tables' food, this would be a 5-star food+experience review. I was surprised to find disappointment in the other dishes, since what we ordered was so delightful.

We have a Momofuku in DC closer to home, but this one was the only one that really caught our eye and made us want to go in. Besides, it's in Vegas. Splurge a little. We went on an off time because we just checked in and we were hungry.

The place is well kept and stylish. The servers were all cheerful and helpful. We had no clue what to get, but in the end, we were able to get the dishes we were looking for. We ordered the pork ramen with their gochujang sauce and some chili oil. I ordered the salmon sandwich.

The salmon sandwich was pretty good. It would benefit with more flavor in the sauce as the salmon flavor overpowered the whole dish. Besides that, the ramen tasted fresh and there were no complaints on that end. Thus, it may be the dish that I ordered, but it was still a well cooked piece of salmon. 

We did had the cucumber as starters and it reminded us of the Din Tai Fung cucumber appetizer in Taiwan... Just with pistachios or peanuts. It was a memorable dish in Taiwan so when we tasted this version, we instantly thought about the one in Taiwan. 

The decor was awesome with a high ceiling. The view over the strip was beautiful. Don't think they needed lights as the light from the windows was enough. Kind of wished we came here for dinner to see how the lighting affected the ambiance. When we peered in at night, it looked cool. 

For the price point and the service we received, I would say it doesn't get any better than this. We definitely spend more than what we spent here in Vegas and came out less satisfied. Thus, this place deserves 5 stars in my book.",xBLNxu1PQWCggsPpxMkhwA,0,0,5,JE4gZuoI8EOenrECkpW37Q

Yes yes, we all know it just opened and there are always kinks and training that need to be worked out but SHAME ON DAVID CHANG for NOT being at the restaurant opening week and working the f*cking line and making sure everything is perfect. 

Starting with the horrible hostesses that are more interested in chatting with each other than helping patiently waiting clients in line to the head chef walking around the restaurant chitchatting away, it was really a horrible experience. 

I work in the industry and have been to every DC restaurant from NYC to friggin Australia and this was by far the lamest and worst of his restaurant. 

There were 3 hostesses on duty and clearly they were hired for the length of their skirts vs making clients feel welcome and comfortable during the time of waiting for tables to clear. The worst part was that we waited over 30 minutes and there were a multitude of tables open in the restaurant. 

The ineptness and lack of communication between the wait staff and kitchen was so embarrassing and such a train wreck that you could clearly see the breakdown. There were so many hapless employees just standing around doing nothing while every single table in my vicinity had NO food on their tables. 

The ""managers"" and underlings were so basic in their attempts to appease customers that you would think this was an opening of a local deli down the street from your house.  All they did was make lame ass excuses for the delays instead of being honest and telling people that there were problems. You know what helps when those situation arise!?! You comp our drinks and food...you apologize and grovel at the customers. You don't lie and say the same damn thing over and over again. 

The head chef (bearded and tattooed...and so affected) was barely in the kitchen. All the chefs I know are sweating balls during service. This guy was so casual and just chilling by the bathrooms and walking around like he didn't have anything to do.  If there is a breakdown of food and/or service, it starts with the head chef. They control the tempo and put the damn beat to the music. Without that, you have already failed. 

Okay...for the food. Clearly they are catering to the customers that haven't been to another DC restaurant. It's not the best of the best by any means, but it's the stuff that they can do with their eyes closed.  

Buns were good as expected. Ramen was whatever and broth was lacking density and porky saltiness. The clams lisboa and Bo Ssam were great. Pickle dish was good but any K-town place as better banchan. The spicy noodles and cold sesame noodles were stoner dormitory dishes that didn't add much.  The duck and Bo Ssam are not difficult dishes but take a lot of time and care. In NY, you have to order way in advance to get. They said the same thing for LV, but no one is ordering bc we ordered extra and they already had them in the kitchen. Btw...they made a point to tell us how long the cooking time was, but it's already a cooked dish and all the sides are prepped. We asking knowing this, why did it take 2+ hours to get to a damn table. What a joke!

Again with the service...not sure if they just expect every person to walk into the Las Vegas restaurant as hapless and ignorant, but the usual question for any multi chain restaurant is asking if you have dined with us before. It sets the pace, makes everyone feel special and also let's the server aware that yes, in fact you are familiar with the food and vibe.  That didn't happen..what happened is that everyone employee made you feel like you won a lottery ticket to gain entry and they were smug as sh*t about it. 

The ONLY and most important thing in today's restaurant world are repeat customers. That's the only thing that will sustain the business. Yes, Las Vegas is 99% tourist and one off customers but word will get out that the service and food are mediocre. 

It's 2017 and dozens of restaurants close down every day in every city. Don't ever get comfortable and let down the customers that are loyal, have gone to sister restaurants and intended to come back. David Chang seems not to care about that anymore and seems to have gone to the dark side of being a sell out and just another chef that just makes appearances on Top Chef.  

This isn't a fancy restaurant. It's not meant to be a 3 hour service with 45 min waits between courses. They won't make any money if they don't turn tables and they won't have repeat customers if everyone gets scared to come in because they don't have enough time to eat.  

I love the food but the service was so horribly disturbing that I wish I could give it ZERO stars. 

Still blows my mind that he wasn't there overseeing everything and how bad the service was...Breaks my foodie heart.",UjFMeqhGaY-lCevVKux2KQ,18,3,1,nz58EOmHz4eJIe8sFXjeLA

Well my overplanning screwed me over because we arrived one day earlier than our actual reservation ! Thankfully, the staff at the hostess stand were very sweet and able to get us in that evening. I would still recommend making a reservation as this is one of the hot dining spots at the Cosmopolitan. Just verify date and time before you arrive. ;)

On to the food--- the menu is simple . I browsed and read reviews in advance so I would have an idea of what to expect. Our server suggested the V&S cocktail which was a mix of vodka, soda , and lemon verbena. It was a bit too tart and bitter for my taste . And $15 ! But to be expected.  We ordered a few appetizers to start-- the spicy cucumber was crunchy , spicy and nutty . I ordered the Shitake Bun (one bun per order) and it was substantial and flavorful. My husband had the Chicken Karaage one which was actually recommended by our server and he seemed to enjoy!


For our entrees, I had the Chickpea Ramen which I was so excited to try! It was nice to have a vegetarian option where they thought of everything including the broth. Most places don't go to that length. The chickpeas were crispy with a nice bite to them and there were ample pieces of bok Choy (my favorite!!!)  . The dish was so delicious and filling. My husband ordered the Smoked Pork Chops. Thankfully he enjoyed (it's a steep $36). They presented it sliced on a plate so all you have to do is eat! Lol. 

They offer dessert from Milk Bar next door but we decided to walk over instead.   

Overall, great dining experience. The restaurant is hip with a cool mural on the wall as a backdrop. Music is a tad louder than I would like (yes I sound like that person) . Especially when the server has to yell across the music lol.

One of his favorite things but sadly we live in AZ so it's not common. I got the Chilled Spicy Noodles. After I ordered it I was second guessing myself. Not something I would usually get but OMG it was amazing. Almost like a Thai basil pesto on the noodles and it was spicy but not overly.

Our waiter was very hospitable and attentive. She answered all the questions I had regarding their menu and with that being said I ordered the pork bao buns and ramen! 

Being an upscale restaurant you already expect to pay a high price for food. When it comes to a higher quality dinner I expect the flavors in the dish to have some kind of twist or are amped up in some way. The pork bao buns definitely met expectations. Pork was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing with the spicy/tangy sauce they served with it. Although I wish the orders came with two instead of one. Unfortunately the ramen did not meet expectations. I was disappointed because for the price and for momofuku being known for their Noodle Bar in NY, the dish was pretty average tasting. The pork in it was good but too much for the soup, especially since the broth tasted pork based too. I could get better ramen in many of the local ramen places here in Las Vegas. 

Overall I gave this restaurant 3 stars for good service and good bao. Their menu doesn't seem to be cohesive as an asian fusion food specialty restaurant.

And it ends there...
Everything else was unforgettable: soft boiled eggs, pork buns, yellowtail sashimi, big eye tuna with frozen shaved foie gras, and the chickpea ramen. 

I guess I just expected more from this Chef. The main things I liked weren't even made by David Chang such as their soft and chewy buns (from a distributor) and the purée pomme is Joël Robuchon's. 

Majority of my stars go to the server/wait staff. They were on top of refilling our water even when we were done eating. And our server was knowledgeable on how each dish was prepared (as they should be).

Oh and I can't forget about the ambiance! It's beautiful inside with plenty of seating. Their interior designer did a wonderful job. You even get a view of the strip. But with a beautiful place and lack luster food it's totally not worth it imo. I rather sit in a hole in the wall place and be served amazing food.",tp77HGAm4JVX3BL50v7Ajg,8,4,3,WjXUIvyic1AIxZWq8QDQHg

Oysters: fresh and delicious
Tuna with shaved foie gras: refreshingly light dish
Kimchi hanger steak: kimchi was fresh and tasty. My wife really liked it. Steak was prepared right and served on top of rice. It wasn't just plain rice. I liked the flavor hidden in the rice biting into it. 
Our first encounter was near midnight when we just arrived to Las Vegas. That might explain why everything was so salty. Next time i would talk to my server immediately.

I tried the shiitake buns which were very yummy; the sauce gave it a slight kick and contrasted the hoisin sauce, in a good way! I ordered the ginger scallion noodles and while I'm not a huge fan of ginger, the ginger flavor isn't too strong. Flavor overall was mild, tasted very light and clean. Personally felt like the toppings were a bit much in terms of ratio to the noodles.

3923408,2017-08-06,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"This was a tough review for me. I've enjoyed David Chang's NYC restaurants, and while I'm certainly not a fan of everything he does (I've always found his ramen subpar, for example), part of me feels like we should feel lucky to have a branch in Vegas since at least we'll have access to some of his quality dishes. At the same time, there are a lot of negatives about the Momofuku here.

First off, they only offer a super-limited menu at lunch. The Momofuku in Vegas is already just a mish-mash of his NYC restaurants so already missing a lot of things, and the lunch menu just pares it down too much. I get that due to volume there are just going to be some dishes that aren't feasible (like the large formats), but even many smaller seafood dishes (scallops, salmon) aren't available at lunch, and those are some of my favorites.

At least the bao (go for the pork and shrimp - not a fan of the mushroom) and the foie gras bigeye tuna dish (must-order, even for $38) are available at lunch, but I just feel like if you're going to be open for lunch you should go all the way.

As I mentioned before, I've never been a fan of Momofuku ramen - it's certainly never been among NYC's best and even in Vegas there are off-Strip places that, even if they're different in style, are just simply better than what Momofuku offers. If you really want to do ramen here, I'd suggest the ""hozon"" chickpea vegetarian ramen just to have something different. I have only had it at the NYC Noodle Bar and not here in Vegas, but it was by far the best ramen I've tried from Momofuku.

Service has not been good on my visits, either. I've had servers that were just plain disinterested, and even when the servers were friendly enough, they just didn't seem to pay much attention. They really need to be more polished here, especially for the price they're asking for the food.

Ultimately, if you've never been to Momofuku and really want to try, this place is OK - but I'd avoid lunch. And if you're going to be in NYC anytime soon (or possibly DC), I think it's better off visiting his locations there.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,1,0,3,fBJ-gNP0m6lLwYNZRmSucA

The crispy potatoes were the best potatoes I've had. The best. That's a bold declaration so you'd do well to order it too. The potatoes were all small in size meaning it's easier to cook them all to the same creamy consistency of excellently and uniformly cooked potatoes. Fried to perfection. Each potato pop into your mouth is an unfolding of the prized sixth flavor - umami. Yaasss!

Check in was... formal. Waiter Kawika was dope. Thanks for bringing aloha to this place!

Also ordered the pork belly ramen and miso chick pea ramen. I preferred the pork belly broth better. The miso broth was too sweet. 
My husband had the ginger scallion ramen. This is a cold ramen mixed with seaweed and grated ginger and scallions. It was surprisingly refreshing. We were shocked since we expected a broth.  

I can't believe it but we also ordered kimchee for $9  I could have bought a jar for that price. When I asked if it was spicy like Korean kimchee our waitress said no since due to health code regulations they could not ferment kimchee. Well.... it is exactly like Korean kimchee. The one we ate was not fermented but tasted fresh. Still it hit the spot with the ramen.

Now it begs the question, if a chef/restaurant prides itself soo much on pairing, ingredients, and pushing the boundry, then why the f can't they do a simple bowl of ramen comfort food correctly?

Tried some other dishes. Same kinda pretentious low quality food that I can whip up myself from simple asian markets.

We went here for lunch the day we were flying out. I am currently at the moment sharing my abdominal cavity with a little human being, so my stomach is not at it's full capacity. If I could I would've tried many more things!

Of course, I got the pork ramen, the broth is on the sweeter side, which isn't ideal for me, but all the other components were delicious. My husband ordered the cold noodles and it looked really good. If I could have handled spicy I would've tasted it.

We asked the waitress for her recommendations because we were debating between some of the baos. We went for the cod bao first, but honestly, it's a glorified fillet o fish. Not saying it was horrible, but it wasn't anything special (hence the -.5) The pork belly bao though...I mean can there be a bad pork belly bao?? It was so good. I wish we got two of those instead.

I've been here in Vegas a few times and though the first time was spectacular each time after I've left disappointed. The menu has been completely changed, missing things, or restricting certain items to certain times. It's incredibly frustrating for the prices. There's very little consistency. Even the items that are on the menu every time I've tried- they have changed dramatically. For example the ahi tuna with shaved foie gras. The first time I tried it right around opening we were treated to amazing big sashimi slices of ahi and THICK shaved pieces of foie gras completely covering the plate. The last time I tried it, the ahi was in tiny cubes a la poke mixed with tomatoes and peppers and the foie gras was grated and only served on a quarter of the plate. Still good but not nearly as decadent and the same price. No consistency.
The chicken buns have gone missing on the menu even though they still have fried chicken and all the components to make them. But they apparently make a chicken sand which that they'll only sell at 11pm and after?
The winter truffle ramen has gone missing (though I suspect it's a seasonal specialty and I hope that is the case and it returns)
The chicken noodle ramen is gone as well. 
Ramen (this chefs signature in NYC and the reason people go) now is off the menu and is only available at the bar, late night or by request at dinner which I find incredibly odd- if you serve it, and have no problem serving it why not put it on the menu and instead of making it seem like a nuisance if it's ordered or like you're hiding it from diners.
 But other items such as the branzino, pork burns etc. Have never left the menu and are consistently the same. 

The lack of consistency is frustrating, the change of items and ingredients as well. Especially since there are few substitutions for what they take away (I.e no more chicken noodle ramen so no meat based options for ramen other than pork.)

I love momofuku, and would gladly wait in line In NYC, I keep going in Vegas hoping to be as impressed as I was when it first opened- but it just keeps frustrating me and disappointing me. As a local I'm not the general out of town customer who comes once and doesn't know better- but I am a customer who would come consistently and become a 'regular' if I knew what I was getting. It's hard to make fans if you keep offering inconsistency.
I always know what I'm getting at MILK or Momofuku in NYC. they don't change ingredients of meals that I've ordered before or take away simple classics.

Pork Ramen - get if you love the taste of pork with a smokey tasting broth which could be due to the addition of pulled pork. 

Spicy Sichuan Rice - it says it comes with pork sausage and broccoli with onions but you won't find sausage that looks like whole sausage. The sausage is cut in small pieces which for me gets drowned with the vision of onions. Broccoli also seems non existent as you don't see whole broccoli or even florets of it.

Before we get to that, let's cover the basics. The vibe is super trendy, with the bar right in front playing hip-hop tunes; an open kitchen with counter seating; and a dining area with dark leather, light woods, and modern murals. The service was good on both visits, but a little uneven; at times it was impeccable, but other times it ranged from overly enthusiastic to missing in action. 
The plates at Momofuku are as much art as they are food. Every dish that we've eaten has been beautifully presented. They are just as delicious as they are pretty. The heirloom tomato salad and the spicy cucumbers were both standout first dishes; the tomatoes were bright with citrus notes and the cucumbers were crispy and fresh with the perfect amount of heat. I wasn't crazy about the dry roasted mussels. They were tasty, but dry. I really wished that there had been some sort of sauce or, at a minimum, a drizzle of butter. The chilled spicy noodles were definitely spicy, but not chilled; more like room temperature. They had a bright basil flavor with a nice kick of heat when I got a slice of pepper or a nice bit of sweetness when I got a candied cashew. The Sichuan sausage served over the top of them was good, but slightly undercooked for my taste and not broken down small enough; trying to break up Italian-meatball sized chunks of sausage with my chopsticks was irritating. Now, about the ramen; the pork belly ramen is a fantastic dish that you will NOT be disappointed with. The pork belly and shredded pork shoulder combined with the poached egg are wonderfully rich and just make for a luscious bowl of noodles. But if you want the best bowl of ramen that you'll ever have, order the chickpea ramen. This dish is incredible; the interplay of textures will delight your palate and the depth of flavor will make you wonder what sort of sorcery they are practicing in the kitchen to elevate such a simple dish to this level. It is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same about the world famous Crack Pie from Milk Bar. We ordered it with cereal milk ice cream and we were sorely disappointed with everything about it from the texture (dense) to the taste (bland).",Be3feRupSjyWkig3ife-Tg,0,0,4,ydrR2xQ7cgydD7gNwPeuPA
4036094,2018-03-10,2,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I was pretty excited when my group wanted to taste this place.

I ordered the Pork Belly. The best decision I made while here. It comes out before main dishes. The pork belly has amazing flavor!! I wanted to order more, but it can get pricey since 1 Pork Belly is $7!!!! $7 for only 1!!! It should better be worth my money....and it totally is. The mouth watering pork belly, that just melts in your mouth, and the cucumber makes life have purpose! haha. Ok, I'm exaggerating, but that cucumber, I don't know if it was marinated, it really lightened the fat in the pork belly. 

TBH, I would just come here ONLY for the Pork Belly. 

Of course you have to try the Pork Noodle that everyone raves about. When I did, I was disappointed. This dish doesn't compare to the Pork Belly Bun. The flavor wasn't spectacular that I would have hoped it would be. Everyone rated it really well, but to me it was just another ramen you can get anywhere. There's nothing special for a $17 ramen noodle. Even the soup and noodle isn't as good as going to authentic Japanese ramen places.

I've tried other dishes like Chilled Spicy Noodles. This one was a miss for me. I personally do not like the numbing chili sauce that they put in the dish. It does numb your mouth. Some people can handle and like it, I certainly don't.

Service is excellent!

I personally had the pork ramen. Soft boiled egg was a little to soft for my taste but still good. Heavy but helped settle the alcohol.

First, the ambiance. Very cool vibe with excellent staff, music, and decor. I love that there are three parts of the restaurant for a variety of diners. When I called to make reservations, I was sad to hear that they didn't have anything until later, but that was in their dining room. They also have seating at the bar and the front floor. We were casual, so we got a table at the front floor. The music has an edgy urban feel with a mix of some 90s hip hop greats, trip hop, and alternative. The decor is just right. Modern and alluring. Not too much. 

Our server Carlos was delightful. He was friendly, fun, and funny. We had someone with us who was a bit wasted and picky, and rather than judge and be offended, he was very accommodating, interactive and welcoming to our meeting our needs. He definitely added to our great experience. You can tell that all the staff really do enjoy their job and the product/experience they are selling. 

My friend and I split our buns. 
- I first tried the pork belly bun. My mouth is watering thinking of this thing. I saw David Chang assemble this lovely dish on The Mind of a Chef, but nothing prepares you for the flavors. Simply delicious with pork belly that is falling apart in a savory and sweet sauce. There were picked cucumbers and another green of some sort. Divine. I then tried the chicken karaage bun. Mmm! Also delicious, but without any additional greens. It has a creamy sauce. 
- For my entree, I got the pork ramen. Perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. Seasoned to perfection. Again, mouth watering just typing this up.

We ordered the duck (smaller portion), pork shout ramen, and two pork buns.

The pork buns were deliciously fatty and rich. Personally, it's worth one but I don't think I could handle another.

The shoyu ramen had a similar pork belly as the pork bun as well as shredded meat (i think pork as well). The soft boiled egg was beautiful and large in the ramen. I really enjoyed the broth as it wasn't too oily and the right amount of flavor for me and the noodles had a good amount of bite to it.

When the duck came it looked beautiful. The amount of meat in each piece was pretty sizable. However, because of the thickness some pieces were a little more rare and led to being too chewy. The skin of the duck was also not crispy. I believe this dish is supposed to be eaten in a lettuce or pancake wrap, but personally the flavors get lost while doing so. I rather eat each component by itself or pair it with the rice it comes with.

Don't expect Momofuku Ko or even Momofuku Noodle Bar from New York, but hey, you don't have to go all the way to the East Coast for this so why not.  I thought the broth wasn't as flavorful and the options seemed much narrower for the buns (I remember the brisket bun was amazing in NY).

The ramen was tasty and the noodles were perfect.  Pork bun was on point, as expected but I didn't remember it being $7 for ONE pork bun before.

We decided to grab a quick bite before going ice skating. We ended up ordering one of each of their steamed buns, crispy potatoes, pork ramen, and crispy rice cakes. All of our dishes were extremely delicious!

The buns themselves deserve 5 stars. The we're steamed to perfection. The four flavors of buns were: shrimp, unagi, shiitake, and pork belly. And the server gave us a little spicy sauce thing on the side which made an already delicious bun even more tasty! My boyfriends favorite the shrimp because it was perfectly crispy and very flavorful and it was quite filling in size. I fell in love with the unagi. It had a perfect balance of salt and flavor and crisp. Just amazing. But don't let that stop you from ordering the other two because they were all very very good and hard to choose what I liked best. 

Then the ramen came out. The shredded pork and the pork belly were amazing! If only all ramen places had pork like theirs.. haha. The noodles were cooked al dente, which is surprising because usually they get soggy. And the broth was light and seasoned :)

The crispy potatoes and crispy rice cakes came out shortly after and while we wanted to indulge in more greatness, we were unfortunately too full from everything else. But the little bites we were able to squeeze in were amazing! The crispy potatoes flavors crept in slowly but it all went together very well. And the rice cake dish had so much zest! It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy, which was a huge plus, and each little rice cake was crispy and chewy and just lovely.

Oh! I forgot! We also ordered their sparkling sake, and it really blew our minds. I always order the cheap hot or cold sake from usual Asian places, but this one didn't taste like sake at all. It has truly sparked my interest in sake.

The chef that was serving us made a comment something along the lines of -""one of you didn't make the best choice"" .. referring to fact that I ordered a simple chick pea ramen dish ($18) due to not feeling so great - and my friend ordered the king crab noodles ($48).  It was off putting, to say the least.

Though it wasn't as off putting as hearing every conversation that the staff was having while we were trying to have our own conversation. The front of the house staff, including what appeared to be management - seemed to be going out of their way to speak loudly and over our own dining experience.

The restaurant is in the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the 2nd floor behind the huge Chandelier. 

The space is huge with great views looking out at the Paris Hotel along the strip. 

Our server, Dale, was super fun, attentive and full of positive energy. She told us about the tuna poke special that's mixed with concentrated pluots and shaved freezed foie gras. Umm, hook line and sinker!  I didn't even ask how much it was going to bleed me. 
$38 FYI. I took the hit for you so you don't have to awkwardly decline upon knowing the price when there. 
It was worth it to me. The shaved freezed foie gras was creamy, slightly salty and rich at the same time and the pluots added the subtle sweetness to the well marinated tuna. 
We also got the pork ramen $18, oysters on a half shell ($26), pork belly buns and the shrimp bun($7 & $8 each, respectively). 
Although the ramen wasn't on the dinner menu, Dale was sweet to ask the kitchen to whip it up. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by it. 
The oysters came with melon and lime shaved ice chips on top that had a vodka? tinge to it that IMO was completely unnecessary. It overpowered the delicious sweet oysters underneath. 

The pork belly buns, which I saved for last, made my tummy and mouth happy.  Don't bother getting the shrimp bun, pork belly all the way. 
Finally, I had to try the famous Milk birthday cake ($14/generous slice). Umm, maybe I was expecting too much, but it just tasted like any cake I could've baked at home. It was a little dry without much surprise or decadence like their crack pie or compost cookie.

I have visited this Las Vegas location twice now and had the pork buns both times. the first time the pork belly melted in my mouth and was soft and tender, reminding me of my experience in NYC. The second time here, the pork was not as tender but still good and great flavor. The server recommended the Chicken bun saying it was their top seller, so I tried one of those too. I feel the chicken had a bit too much batter but a good Asian flavor ( I think it had a hint of ginger in there). Overall.... Pork Bun Over Chicken and everything else

The pork belly ramen was amazing, and I also had a shrimp bun. The shrimp bun essentially was like a shrimp patty inside a ""soft taco-shell"" like bun with a sauce and lettuce. Both were tasty and I only wish I had time to order more from their menu.

With that said, sometimes I find that the more beautiful the restaurant (excluding fine dining), the less tasty the food. This is no exception.

The pork ramen was by no means bad, but it was not wheorth the hefty price tag. The noodles were decent, the broth wasn't very flavorful and the egg was mediocre. The best part of this dish was the pork itself which was tender and delicious. That was what saved the dish.

Once we arrived, we were lead to a private room for our party. It was a beautiful room which made our dinner here an excellent dining experience. The staff were also friendly and displayed great customer service. They explained to us the menu options and how they can even create a menu for us at whatever price point we pick. We decided to order individually, but that's a nice option that I wouldn't mind trying next time!

Food that I got include:

Pork Belly Bun (hoisin, scallion, cucumber) - This was an excellent appetizer before my meal. It was delicious and each bite had me wanting more! If you're deciding between this or the shrimp bun, pick the pork belly bun.

Shrimp Bun (spicy mayo, pickled red onion, iceberg) - I had to get another bun after tasting how delicious the pork belly bun was, so I decided to give this a try as well. It was also good, but the pork belly bun is definitely the better of the two.

Chilled Spicy Noodles (sichuan sausage, candied cashew, thai basil) - Noodles with sausage and nuts. The spice level isn't too high, very bearable for people who can't handle that much spicy. Overall, the noodles were great!

Overall, my experience at Momofuku was great. I especially liked the noodles here, they were perfect quality and had plenty of flavors. The staff mentioned that the menu changes routinely, so be open-minded with the menu when coming here. However, the staff were also understanding and after speaking with the chef, we were able to order some items not on the menu, such as the pork ramen.

While the food was A-OK, it wasn't mind-blowing - and with those menu prices, there were expectations for wow factors on the items.
We had a very large party of 19 and we reserved a long table that was able to seat all of us comfortably in their super comfy seats.  The interior of Momofuku was quite large with clean/simple decor.  Service was good and food came out fairly quickly considering our group size.  Only thing I would recommend to fix is for the waiters to announce to the guests that the default water given to them is some ""filtered"" tap water that's supposed to cleanse the pallet better (or some mumbo jumbo); there is an automatically charge of $1/guest on it.  Regular tap is free, and what we assumed we would be getting, but nope.  Not a big price at all but not a fan of surprise charges (even though it was in fine print on the menu; didn't see).

The food - I ordered the Pork Shoyu Ramen, the Ginger Scallion Noods, the Shiitake Bun, and the Pork Belly Bun.  The Pork Belly in the ramen and bun were pretty good, and the egg in the ramen was cooked well...but aside from that, the ramen tasted quite regular and the broth wasn't super flavorful.  The Ginger Scallion Noods were pretty good, with all the ingredients mixed nicely.  The ramen and buns were a bit pricier than I thought it was worth.  Ginger beer was also $6!

The table also ordered some shared dishes like the Five-Spice Duck and the Pork Shoulder.  I didn't try it, but they said that while the duck was good, it wasn't anything better than Sam Woo, but at a super premium cost.  The Pork Shoulder was good - they said it would feed 3-4 people...nope - it feeds much, much more.  I'd guess 6+, esp if you're ordering other stuff.  Additionally, since we were there for some birthdays, they did offer some tasty cake balls and a birthday candle for them, so that was a nice gesture.

I do love watching the shows on David Chang's restaurants, but this one was just okay for us.  I would recommend you give it a try as they do have some unique items you won't really find across the Vegas strip.

As 8 giggly girls came here for the bachlorette party dinner, we opted for both of the noodles on the menu, oysters, some raw fish crudo, the lobster and shrimp dish, and rice cakes.  Every dish was delicious, and a bit ugly (lol)!  The lobster and shrimp dish especially, all piled up without much garnish or plating, topped with a brownish sauce.  But the texture and taste are exceptional!  Whatever the batter they use to fry up that seafood is just perfect.  Their noodles were also amazing, which is not surprising given that's how Momofuku started their fame.  The ramen is perfectly al dente, and the flavors are just right.  The ginger scallion one tasted like a dry version of soupy ramen, and the chilled spicy one was like a good looking hapa love child of an Italian and Thai couple.

Also worth mentioning: They serve some of the best cocktails I've ever had!

I ate my oysters mostly separate after the first one.

Of course we had to try a ton of other things, so the other items I had a sample of that I also very much enjoyed were:
1) the steamed pork bun
2) some crudo dish (I think they are always changing the type of fish b/c i went back to look at the menu it seemed different than what I had)

2) It took about 10 min, no joke, to get waters and ice teas. We also thought we'd make it easy and have 1 person order for the table...that still seemed to be too overwhelming for our server. I work in the industry too, and I know it can get pretty hectic, but communication is key.

3) Had to ask for a refill on ice tea 3 times before we actually got it.

4) One of the bussers reset our table with plates, a butter knife, and chopsticks after ordering ice cream and cake truffles for dessert....but WHY?? 

5) Had to ask for the check twice.

Well, Momofuku is not strictly a Japanese restaurant, it draws from Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean (& other) cuisines. Also, initially, I didn't know what kind of restaurant It was because the decor is neutral & modern, with lots of wood & metal, not ""Asian"". Our food was very good, though generally pretty spicy. I had the Chilled Spicy Noodles - Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashews, jalapenos & red cayenne peppers on top of a pesto pasta - highly recommended by another Yelper, and it was terrific! 

The dish didn't taste chilled ... more warm/room temperature, and that was fine. Even though I removed all the peppers, the dish was delicious and hella spicy, though not excessively or painfully so. Very delicious, though be forewarned, when they say ""Spicy"" they ain't kiddin' ! ;)

I'd read that the Confetti Cake was good, so I ordered it, realized my sister's birthday was the next day, asked our server Chris was if he'd put a candle in the cake, and he brought it out along with candle, dessert plates & forks! We were all happy with Chris' attentiveness & efficiency!

Pork bun - Great! Pork belly was very tender and the sauce in the bun - I think it's hoisin was a nice addition to the overall taste of bun

Soft boiled eggs - I'm not a huge fan of eggs but the taste of the salmon roe plus the crunchy pieces were interesting

Brussel sprouts - deep fried. I've never had them this way. Really enjoyed this side dish. Very crispy but also a little oily but very good

waygu filet mignon - tender delicious, best dish of the night 

Spicy chilled noodles - I think they need to manage expectations on this dish. The noodles were extremely spicy - like I couldn't tolerate more than 2 bites and had to send it back. I'm used to spice and couldn't handle this dish. The pork patties laying on top make it hard to serve, I didn't understand if I didn't mix the dish properly so got hit all the spice.

Dessert- cereal milk soft serve is a must try. Get it with sprinkles and crumbles.

Service - Amazing! Our waiter Carlos was engaging and fun. 

Wish they had the larger format items for smaller parties :( we were only 2 people so couldn't justify spending $218 on a main dish alone. Kinda wish they had a set menu where you paid 130 to 150 for a couple of courses, I probably would have done that instead of ordering a la carte.

We dined here on a Saturday evening.  We didn't have any reservation that day and luckily after 10-15min of wait time, we were seated at the bar / open kitchen dining area.  

LOCATION - located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the 2nd floor, next to Milk Bar.

Lunch:        11:00am - 2:30pm
Afternoon    2:30pm - 5:00pm
Dinner:         5:00pm - 11:00pm 
Late Night   11:00pm -2:00am


SERVICE - Our server that night was a guy/ bartender guy (forgot his name, Caucasian/semi Hispanic lookin with stylish hair cut).  
---Not sure if he was too busy making drinks and forgot about the ""customers"" in front of him, but he didn't seem to care much about us throughout the whole dining experience.  
--- He got our orders out and basically just left us there doing our own thing.  
---He didn't even check up on how was our food or if we had wanted any desserts? 
----It's not like we had sat 5-10 feet away from him then I can assume that he must be super busy, but we were right in front of him eye to eye.   


ENTREES AND FEEDBACKS: 

**SPICY CUCUMBERS** $7 -chunky cucumber, togarashi (Japanese chili powder), toasted almonds, scallions.  There was this green sauce, but wasn't sure what it was.  This dish was ok; at some point some of the cucumber had a hint of bitterness in them which I assumed it was from the cucumber skin.  

**PORK BELLY BUN** $7 (1 Order) - 1 thick pork belly, hoisin sauce, scallions, and sliced cucumbers.    I would recommend you try this dish.  The thick pork belly was very tender; eat this with their ""Ssam"" sauce (similar to Korean gochujang- that red chili paste you see in a lot of Korean dishes.)  

**CHICKEN KARAAGE** $7 (1 order) - spicy mayo sauce, pickled red onions, shredded iceberg lettuce.  When I hear ""Chicken Karaage,"" I picture this as a crunchy fried chicken.  However, our chicken didn't come out crispy or crunchy but more of a soggy seared chicken on a bun.  

**PORK RAMEN** $18 - Yes, ramen can cost this much people, which is a bit pricy to my opinion.  This ramen included: 1 thick pork belly piece, shredded pork belly shoulder, 1 poached egg, seaweed, fish cake sliced, bean sprouts, and green onions.   
- The ramen was ok, but it was so SALTY.   Everything else in the ramen was good if only the chefs cut down on the salt here.
-  OR at least please have a taste test of the broth before serving it out to your customers.  


OVERALL - I think Momofuku was alright.  Would I come back?  Maybe, I would come back for the pork belly bun only, but not much of the other dishes.   It was nice to sit at the open kitchen where you get to have a full view of all dishes being made in front of you, but then again the great service wasn't quite there.

Having been to New York Momofuku and Milk Bar we already had a plan on mind: buns, ramen, spicy noodles, wagyu.  Tiffani completely changed our approach to dinner: spicy cucumber, pork meatballs, beef tartar, chicken Karaage, salt & pepper lobster.  They just ran out of the seabass that we really wanted and we decided to save her favorite chicken Katsu for next time when we were tasting less.  That sounds basic, right?  You know it's serious when someone from Hawaii recommends the Katsu.  You can tell that the people that work there love the food.

The first 3 stars are for the food and environment, our whole night was made by the very enthusiastic and fellow food-lover, Tiffani.

I always had refills and the food came out really fast. Last but not least, I couldn't pass up the birthday cake. Amazing. Just get it. It's big enough for 2 people so don't let the $14 scare you. It's massive. I cannot wait to come back here.",gwL3oKAMbFMgOL8omAzcjw,0,0,5,cQADMWaxuEjxlcv-img22A

to justify $7 for 1 bun. Instead we started with the shishito peppers which were great and the portion was generous. I got the pork ramen and added shiitake mushrooms and chili oil. Definitely get the chili oil! It adds a nice kick. My boyfriend got the rice bowl which was like a Japanese version of bibimbap. Both were really good!

I came to Momofuku because I craved ramen. But after seeing their pork belly bao sandwich on the menu , I had to order both the ramen and the pork belly sandwich. Wow.

Ramen is as good as other ramen I've had (there's one ramen shop in my hometown that does it extremely well, and I go there on a regular basis.

The table was still very spacious, and there was enough space for all of our dishes with drinks. The customer service we had here from our waiter was amazing. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and inviting. I'd come back to Momofuku just for him. We ordered the chicken karaage buns, pork belly buns, pork ramen, and chilled spicy noodles. The buns were both great. The pork belly bun had a generous slab of pork belly and the flavor was overall fantastic. Well for $7 a bun (it's $14 for 2 pork belly buns), it better be a decently sized amount of pork. The chicken karaage was also fantastic. The chicken was very crispy and juicy while the iceberg was refreshing and crisp. It was overall, a solid choice. I wasn't disappointed in both of these buns, but I was a little sad to let go of my $7 per bun.

The chilled spicy noodles were a massive letdown. On paper, it sounds great. Spicy chilled noddles with Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, and candied cashews overall sounds like a pretty solid choice. In reality, I found myself picking out only the candied cashews and Sishuan sausage. The noodles were pretty spicy to a point that it was like they went for spice and not really flavor. I'm not down for something that just burns but doesn't have any redeeming flavor. I mean, I'm not one to waste food so I ate the noodles and took most of it home. 

The ramen was pretty good, and the broth wasn't too salty or bland. It's a nice bowl of ramen but nothing amazing or novel. 

I wonder if maybe I just didn't know what to order here. I mean, it wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't anything that really stuck out to me except for the buns. I feel like I really wanted to like this place and I had high expectations from Momofuku since I enjoyed other things from David Chang. Even so, I was slightly letdown.

And to be perfectly honest, I did not have too high expectations considering is 1. a well-known chain from New York City (NEW YORK CITY! ), and 2. right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip (and in the Cosmopolitan nonetheless). 

But Momofuku did prove me wrong.  We went on a Saturday for lunch and while the menu was limited, we tried enough to have our bellies satisfied.  Keeping it simple:

Pros:
- gorgeous, spacious ambience;
- they accommodated our party of 8 right away with no wait time;
- the baos - I've had my share of baos and the pork belly bao was simple and good
- CHICK PEA RAMEN -- finally, something different from the regular ramen!  And we're not just talking regular boiled chick peas, but crispy (likely flash-fried) chickpeas. What a delicious and original surprise, and the broth and noodles were delicious. I can still taste it now.
- Dessert - I had already planned to go to Milk Ice Cream Bar next door and since it's from the same owner, we were able to have our ice cream in the restaurant, which was perfect! I had the crack ice cream and while it was delicious, it could have used a little crispiness to go with the soft serve.

Cons:
- none that I can think of...$18 for a bowl of Ramen seems a bit steep but let's remember that you are in Las Vegas
- wish that some of the dinner menu were offered during the daytime

4369091,2018-05-24,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"So I was mentally prepared to love Momofuku - I have read cookbook which is as much a history of the development of the concept and have never been able to get into their NYC restaurant - so happy to see they opened in Vegas and more than excited to finally try it out and it was very good but there were some service flaws that affected the whole meal.  This was a business dinner and you should know the place if loud - music cranked up so everyone talks louder and you can't really hear the person across the table - we were at a round table and the conversation could only be with the two parties to either side - I know it is Vegas - just understand that is the gig.  Arrive on time and our table wasn't ready - not a big deal the whole party wasn't there but it took close to a half hour for the table and once it was ready the hostess said clear the bar tab and come find her - not sure that's the way it should work - happy to clear the tab but how about you take the rest of the group to the table.  The bar has a fairly limited beer menu - not shocking but a large selection of specialty drinks - more on that later.  As far as the venue goes - Momofuku is a beautiful restaurant, touch dark but urban/modern decor great graffiti-ish wall mural - made us feel a little under dressed. Well after 9:00 when we sat for our 8:30 reservation and then we had to wait a bit - five minutes or so for our waitress to show - it seems we also had someone helping with drinks but he came and discussed gin - got one drink - failed to get another and we never saw him again.  Our main waitress was nice and knowledge about the menu and was helpful with recommendations - in fact we basically went with what she suggested.  So have gone half a page and not mention food - so lets start for real - Momofuku is meant to be family style dining with a large lazy susan in the middle of the table to rotate selections around the group - cool.  Started with the Spicy Cucumbers and Shishito Peppers - both were good but would lean to the cucumber, large hunks vs slices lightly dusted in togarashi and (olive?) oil with almonds it was light but quite good.  The peppers were fine with a bit of a smokey taste but nothing you haven't had before.  So our waitress said go with the duck and we did - it says serves 3-4 - we have five and it was plenty but we did get a couple smaller entrees as well.  What was not explained is exactly how to consume the Rotisserie Duck - turns out you use the lettuce wraps and chive pancakes with toppings/sauce - understand that that is seems obvious now but never having ordered it everyone was a bit confused - bottom line is the Duck is amazing - brought to the table and carved into perfect 1/4"" inch slices then laid out over a huge bowl of sticky rice - the skin seared to crispiness and the duck meat so juicy you didn't really need and of the accompanied sauces - I would be hard pressed to not order it again.  Bonus went the duck was gone I used the ssäm sauce and ginger scallion sauce over the rice.  Other highlights were the Grilled Lamb Ribs - just a touch of yogurt sauce was all the needed - they let the lamb be the star of the show - this one said it feeds two but we all had a rib and were happy.  Also tried the Chilled Spicy Noodles with sichuan sausage, thai basil and candied cashew - another must order - the mostly green dish had a subtle heat but was mostly refreshing - great paring with the heavier duck and lamb.  One quick note again on the service side - I ordered their specialty Old Fashion when the food was ordered - didn't receive it until we were well into the main course - worse it was fantastic - more of a Manhattan with rich bourbon and only the tiniest hint of sweetness and I would have had two if I had started earlier.  Two sides for the table were the Brussels Sprouts & Cauliflower - crisp and delicious and Asparagus - which were just okay, maybe the only thing we had that I wouldn't order again.  Could leave without trying something from Milk Bar and again listened to our waitress and got the Crack Pie with Cereal Milk Ice Cream - the pie is so dense it is a thick caramel delight and pares with not as sweet as you expect ice cream - shared among five it was a great finish to the meal.  Summary - food was outstanding and assuming some service glitches get resolved it will be up on the top end of the Vegas restaurant scene.",m5fXkHqZDF5Jh0Cpn8F2Sg,0,0,4,Qbq_435cCasbhRggEw4IFg

Coming in at 12:30pm on a Thursday there was no wait at all and we were promptly seated.

Tried the truffle ramen (don't think this is on the menu anymore) last summer and thought it was good but not something I would come back for. Then in winter I tried the scallion noodles as well as the shishito peppers. I loved the shishito peppers but the scallion noodles weren't really for me (though my boyfriend enjoyed these). But this time around, everything we ordered was absolutely amazing - I'm actually craving all of it as I write this! 

Chilled Spicy Noodles (w/ added poached egg): Wow oh wow is this delicious! So nice and refreshing with a very bright and fragrant flavor. The light saltiness of the sausage paired really well with the sweetness from the sauce. On top of that, the noodles were perfectly cooked & had a great chew. Would like to mention that I didn't find this spicy at all so don't be deterred by the name of you can't handle spice. Now onto the famed poach egg, I kind of regret ordering one - I'd rather have ordered 10. The yolk is AMAZING! Teetering on the edge of cooked and runny it was so thick and delicious, I just wanted a whole bowl of eggs... With that said, it worked really well mixed in with the noodles! 

Shishito Peppers: We couldn't help but order this again. Simple but so addicting! 

Pork Belly Bun: A great appetizer (or meal if you order 2-3 a person depending on how big your appetite is). The pork belly is so nice and succulent and tastes great with the hoisin and scallion. I also really enjoyed the pickled cucumber! 

Crispy Potatoes: We ordered this side thinking that we wouldn't be full off the above three (we were wrong and left with a lot of leftovers) & because we thought these might be similar to the raves about butterball potatoes at Majordomo in LA. I honestly have no idea if this side is remotely similar but who cares because this might be my favorite dish. The potatoes are perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside with this amazing honey mustard sauce. I don't really remember what else was in it, all I know is that this is so packed with flavor and so delicious!! 

As for the space, it's inside Cosmo, is relatively large, and offers a great view of the strip because of its large windows. 

Service was friendly and attentive as expected. Great explanations were given of each dish as it was delivered to the table. Waters were refilled for us even though they do leave the bottle at the table for you. We didn't have to wait long for the check. Everything just flowed right! 

For pricing, I honestly thought it was really worth it for what we ordered. The portions were all quite large aside from the bun and the flavors were exemplary. We left with leftovers and all of this only costed us $60 after tax and tip which is honestly really good in Vegas for a meal of such good quality.

4389257,2017-01-28,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Simply WOW! I've always wanted to go to Momofuku in New York and was excited to be able to check the restaurant out on a recent business trip to Las Vegas.

I was lucky to score a bar seat in front of the kitchen as it afforded me the opportunity to chat with the chefs and get their recommendations on dishes. I also benefited by sitting next to a guy who was happy to trade bites of each other's dishes so that I could taste more things.

I was tempted to order the Pork Ramen, but was worried it would be too filling. Apparently each of the Momofuku restaurants has several dishes created specifically for that particular restaurant, and there are classic dishes, such as the Ramen, available at all locations.

I ended up ordering, or tasting the following dishes:

Spicy cucumbers with togarashi, toasted almonds and scallions. The cucumbers were served in large chunks and came with a light, spicy sauce. 

Shrimp bun. You can't go to Momofuku and have at least one bun. I'm not a big meat eater, but was willing to try the Pork belly bun. The chef recommended the shrimp and shiitake buns, and so I ordered the Shrimp bun and was blown away by it. The shrimp was crispy, spicy, perfectly cooked and piping hot. I loved it! I'll try the Shiitake bun the next time.

Romaine salad with parmesan, walnut and tamarind. What a salad!! It sounds so simple and basic, but it wasn't. It probably is the best romaine salad I've had anywhere. The dressing, favors and consistency were unlike any Romaine salad I've ever had before. I loved it.

Smothered Katsu chicken with shiitake gravy and black pepper. This dish was incredible. The chicken was hot, crunchy and bursting with flavor. So good!

Salt & Pepper lobster with shrimp, jalapeño and fried garlic. Another incredible dish. It's not cheap, but definitely worth it.

Lastly, I tried the Korean braised short ribs. This dish is large and designed to serve 2-8 people. The piece of beef was HUGE, but cooked to perfection with incredible flavor. The meat is slow cooked over night and was unbelievably tender.

A shout out to the chefs for their great recommendations and conversation during dinner. One was a talented, bright, personable guy from San Jose (sorry, I am bad with names), and the other a young woman from the Pacific Northwest. Both were incredible skilled, dedicated and passionate about their profession.

I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas so that I can return to Momofuku and try more dishes. I would highly recommend eating at this restaurant.",2A-Aagasek_HICoMPN3HSg,3,0,5,Nsq9ERoKVwI971Vh5SY-4w

4402133,2017-05-11,8,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Momofuku operates next to sister restaurant Milk Bar in the Cosmopolitan, and across from Eggslut, completing a triangle of restaurants where you can get ""edgy"" urban fare in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. Yep, I can only slightly mask my contempt for the on-going hipsterfication of food. As talented as David Chang is, I hold him accountable as one of the primary architects of this more casual post-gourmet trend in high-end dining that I disdain.

Nonetheless, I do usually enjoy my trips to the man's restaurants despite their annoyingly pared-down chic aesthetic, hip hop soundtracks, and PoMo art installations, and I've been looking forward to visiting his Vegas outpost since it opened. Casual high-end dining only works if the food is incredible. If you're not the very best at the type of food you prepare in your city, yet you are going to charge me high-end fine dining prices, I better see Schweitzer white table cloths. Fortunately, this has never been a concern of mine with the Momofuku group of restaurants, even if they're making everyone else lazy.

Interestingly, the diner next to me at the chef's bar asked his waiter what Momofuku was all about and was told, ""Japanese street food."" As someone who has spent a good amount of time in Japan, I shuddered at that response. Culturally, I'm not sure ""street food"" works conceptually for the Japanese, who have historically valued ritual and formality during dining. Also, let's be clear: no one is ever going to mistake Tokyo for Tijuana. No, I'd say Momofuku is an izakaya experience if we're going to call it Japanese, or a Korean/Japanese/American fusion restaurant if we're not. I know fusion is a dirty word in culinary circles due to the failures of all of the Nobu knock-offs over the past few decades, but let's stop using the term ""street food"" to describe our yankophillic interpretations of low-brow food from other cultures. It's not only confusing, but it comes across as try-hard and even a tad racist.

The food at Momofuku Las Vegas was predictably great.

I started with the Spicy Cucumbers ($7), essentially a bowl of cucumber chunks dusted with togarashi (Japanese chili pepper powder), crushed toasted almond, and scallions. If you're expecting pickles, this is not that -- it really is just cucumbers. This is a simple starter dish that effectively delivers the restaurant's point of view: a) we're going to screw with your expectations, b) yet deliver something real good, and c) you're going to pay good $$$ for it.

For my entrée, I ordered the Pork Ramen ($18). This was not the first time I've had Momofuku's famous pork broth, which is built on powdered mushrooms, chicken bones, kombu, rendered bacon fat, and a tare infused with bacon ends. Similar to what I've had at other locations, the broth here is darker, sweeter, and thinner than the tonkotsu broths that are currently favored in west coast ramen-yas. What really sets apart Momofuku's pork ramen, however, is the pork itself. The browning reaction on the pork stands up to the broth, and is probably the most important aspect of making this dish delicious. Supporting the belly by adding more substance to the bowl, the pork shoulder is prepared in a manner more similar to crispy carnitas than the dull, plain-o slices of ""chashu"" pork that end up in bowls of ramen elsewhere. The sous-vide'd soft-boiled egg can be stirred into the broth to add more substance, or just eaten straight away -- either way, it is a great addition to the bowl.

As good as the food was, I felt the service could have been better. My waiter did not seem too interested in talking about various menu options, and I felt I got very terse answers to my questions. Not like the place was at capacity either. When I pay $7 for raw cucumbers, I want to feel valued. I didn't feel enough love on this particular visit. Still, the positives outweighed the negatives and even with my inherent bias against what David Chang is doing to dining, I still can't stop going to his restaurants.

-pork ramen
-chicken noodle soup

The best thing was the fried Brussels sprouts. Pork belly Bun was coo, but it didn't even compare to Chairman Bao truck in SF.

I felt like the taste of the food was just normal but they make the ambiance ""feel fancy"", but the price of the food didn't match with the quality and taste of the food. We had the $250 five spice duck (out the door was $300 for just one duck). Probably wouldn't be ordering that again as there's wayyyy much better tasting ducks elsewhere for $30-40. I think the cutting of the duck in front of the guests to put into the clay pot took way too long. By the time they finished cutting it and serve it, the rice and duck was cold already and made the rice too oily and it was cold (not pleasant tasting at all). They also charge $1 per person for regular tap water, which is ridiculous as water should be a basic human need and should not be charged. We realized afterwards that they charged $1 for both tab water and sparkling water. Charging for sparkling water makes sense but not for tab water (I'm actually a bit angry regarding that fact).  The waiters did not inform us prior either.  Usually at some high end restaurants there would be even complimentary starters or desserts, but not only did they not provide that and they charged for water. The only good thing is they had a nice setting and good service. The duck that we got was not so good, especially for how much it cost for one item and didn't taste anything special. Just a bit disappointing.

However, everyone in our party had one thing in mind: their fabled pork ramen. It did not disappoint. The noodles are thin, soft, and not over cooked, not really the star of the show. The broth is full of flavor but not fatty (this might disappoint tonkotsu ramen fans though). I could have done without the pulled pork but the chunk of solid pork was tender and juicy--just ultimate perfection. Interestingly, instead of an ajitsuke tamago style egg that's hard boiled with a jelly yolk, they went for a poached egg. A little sloppy when you eat but still yummy. Serving sizes are plenty.

This fancy Asian-fusion restaurant seems to be ""known"" for their ramen, but I would have to disagree and say that the real fortunes come in their main entrees which looked pretty damn good.

Given that it's a higher-end restaurant, a reservation on a busy Saturday evening is absolutely necessary. Our party of nine was able to get our own long table with a great view of the Strip. At night, it lights up the area where you don't need to have lights on inside the restaurant to give you a great dining atmosphere.

Our waiter was quick to serve us still or sparkling water- whatever your choice! We kicked things off with their oysters ($12 for half a dozen), which were a tasty treat. The freshness quality was certainly up there.

Being on a bit of a budget crunch, I ended up choosing their Chilled Spicy Noodles with Sichuan sausage ($14). At first glance, the portions seemed fairly small. However, once you mixed everything together, it became a spicy, delectable medley of flavors. Absolutely loved all the ingredients and kick the noodles had. No broth needed.

While my noodles were good, my friends meals didn't seem to live up to the hype. The Ginger Scallion Noodles were way too salty, which prompted them to comp the two bowls our table ordered. My other friend ordered a chicken dish that was fairly dry. So good and bad, there seemed to be some inconsistency in the kitchen offerings from that evening. Hopefully they can fix that for future customers.

Momofuku is definitely worth a try if you're feeling classy Asian. Give it a whirl before you head out to your late night adventures.",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,2,3,3,TGDa7K66JWZSEnZXRtLVpg

They offer selections such as chickpea ramen, truffle ramen, even cold noodles! I went for the pork ramen which comes with a poached egg, a slice of pork belly, scallions and sprouts. For $18 is a bit steep, but I have to admit the quality of the ramen was pretty darn good. The broth was to die for, especially after a night of drinking and going out. I was also happy to find that the broth wasn't the typical creamy pork broth I'm used to in SF, but a clear broth which made it all enjoyable. The ingredients were fresh and noodles were perfect texture and taste! Service was super fast and they were able to expedite my experience because I was in a bit of a time crunch.

The place is handsome, glitzy and very Asian in that there are lots of Asians around, eating, serving, bartending, cooking.  The bar has a very casual vibe and the drinks have Asian touches.  Nice.  The kitchen is open and in view from the bar and restaurant area.

The menu is expansive.  There are are small plates, medium plates, and monster plates made for sharing.  Our group was large enough to try a number of plates of all sizes.   We asked for recommendations from our server and added a few things of our own.  It all added up to waaay too much food!  And because the large format items come at the end, we were faced with a huge amount of additional food when we were already full!  I think our server should have been more cautionary with us in our ordering because at the end it was not very enjoyable.

Shrimp buns: Fried shrimp cake on steamed buns with Asian accoutrements.  Tasty but the steamed buns were not the softest.

Ginger scallion noodles: This is a David Chang staple and I have to admit it was disappointing.  The noodles were soft and the the ginger scallion sauce was lost in an overdose of the sweet pickled shiitakes.

Shisito peppers: Can't go wrong with these and they were appropriately delicious.

Rotisserie chicken and fried bones: This is a roast chicken with crispy skin, served with chicken parts that are fried until crispy.  Dry and dry.  Not good.

Bo Ssam: Another of chef's famous dishes, it's a large format, whole or 1/2 pork shoulder, braised and roasted until fork tender, and served with raw oysters, sauces, and lettuce leaves for wrapping.  We ordered the 1/2 shoulder and it was still an intimidating amount of food.  Delicious!

5 spice roasted duck:  This AWESOME version of roast duck is also served as a large format, and can easily feed 8+ people.  The legs and thighs are removed and the bone-in breast is spit roasted until the skin is golden brown and beautifully crispy.  Meanwhile a confit is made from the legs and thighs which is then shredded and brought to the table and served over a large serving bowl of rice.  The whole roasted duck breast is then brought to the table, taken off the bone and carved table side; the perfectly cooked breast slices are then placed atop the confit/rice.  Wow, so delicious!  Oh, and then the duck carcass is taken back to the kitchen, chopped up and fried until crisp, and then brought back out to the table for some additional snacking.   Soooo good.

Like a lot of Las Vegas outposts, Momofuku does not meet the hype however if you come for the duck you will not be disappointed!",jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ,0,0,3,F2B8Z4l8Q766kZH76la60w
4457824,2017-04-19,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Overpriced, unbalanced flavors, and awkward experience is the best way I can describe Momofuku. 

First of all, this place is waaay overpriced for the food that it offers. I ordered one shrimp bun (bao) and the price for one is $7. I didn't think it was anything special really. It tasted good, but then I realized I can get a whole tray of bao for $7 somewhere else... Now for two soft boiled eggs, we were charged $15. TWO EGGS cut in half to make four pieces. We also ordered the kimchi stew for $24. If my mom found out I paid $24 for kimchi stew, she probably would have killed me and told me to eat it at her home. I'm not sure what makes the stew so expensive because the only ingredients in it were kimchi, radish, pork, and one measly rice cake.

I wouldn't be complaining about the price if the food was delicious, but unfortunately it was very lackluster, unbalanced, and strange. The shrimp bun was probably one of the better things we ordered that night, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The soft boiled eggs were very dense and heavy. The flavors on it were not balanced at all. The kimchi stew tasted as if they had to add MSG to make it taste better. There was literally one rice cake in my dish with some small portions of pork in it. Didn't taste authentic at all. Lastly, the chilled spicy noodles were probably the strangest dish we had. It was very basil-y and had this strange spiciness to it (it is very spicy by the way, and I love spicy foods). I feel like they added the extra heat to cover up for the lack of flavor. 

Now my experience at Momofuku was very strange to me. I understand that it's Asian fusion, but it was not done very well. It always boggles my mind to see people try to make upscale Asian food because honestly, Asian (especially Korean) food is not generally high end. Korean food was created to be very strategic - to preserve and be able to survive long winters. Korean food is a mixture of a lot of scraps put together because for a long time the country was poor. Unless it was food served in the royal courts, Korean food is not necessarily fancy. Because I know this information, it was an awkward experience for me to eat at Momofuku, especially knowing that David Chang, who is the creator of the restaurant, is Korean. The food was not presented in an extraordinary way nor did the flavors blow me away. It was almost like I was ordering street food for the price of a nicer restaurant. 

Overall, I probably will not come here again. It was a waste of money and the service was just average (the server forgot our drink order). Nothing at this restaurant made me want to come back again.",9FT7TtB8S4u1PwjkZmizkw,4,0,2,FMGLakhpey9HaPBtopmINg

Didn't get the shoYu pork ramen bc I typically prefer tonkotsu broth. I did get to sample the shoYu broth and it was bombbb. Super duper good just not my broth. Flavorful. I felt like they added something to the broth where it wasn't just shoyu which made me feel like it stands out a bit more than your typical shoyu ramen. Maybe it was umami....""shrugs""

Pork belly bun was cooked perfectly. The fat melts in your mouth. It was a nice thick cut and the ratio of bun to meat was just right. Sometimes I feel that there's not enough meat and momofuku did it just right.

I also had their Kalbi beef dish which was also very good. I expected the beef dish to be overpowered by sauces but this dish, you can actually taste the meat. Cooked medium rare, not too chewy. It came with a side of what tasted like pickled mushrooms. I do have to say that I felt that this dish was particularly overpriced for how much you get. You don't get very much for $48. Overall, good dish.

Note to patrons who want to also get dessert here. You can order from the milk bar menu at momofuku, which is nice and convenient.

Simply put, the food is good and you pay a premium for some of it, like the pork buns. Others, like the ramen, you pay a reasonable price. The food is delicious, tasty, but I can't say it's wildly unique. To be fair, I chose pretty standard items.

Pros:
-That Yelp cache of being at Momofuku
-Nice staff, attentive
-Food is good
-You're not overpaying for everything

Cons:
-Overpay for the buns

Ambience, service, the feel you'd expect from a restaurant at Momofuku's level of fame is all as expected. So I won't dive into that. My food guide is short and sweet, since I was a table of one. Before you go on, basically I'd say Momofuku is good food, nice Asian flavors but will probably shine best if you choose more outlandish creations.

Food Reps
Shrimp Bun - $7
This is where I think you're over paying. One single, albeit tasty bun for $7 is quite a premium. The shrimp patty is delicious, with some iceberg lettuce and a delicate bun. I wouldn't get it again because it tasted as good as other Asian shrimp-centric meals you could have elsewhere.  

Pork Belly Shoyu Ramen - $17
Now this is steep for a ramen entree in ways, but I've been to quality OC ramen shops that run near this price when you include all the damn add-ons. So $17 was reasonable enough for me.

4505904,2017-10-25,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Overly hyped, overpriced and underwhelming. There's better food around the corner. I went to the Saam bar in NYC a couple months back which was a far better experience than my experience here in Vegas.

1. Vibe
Similar feel to its sister stores in NYC, lots of bamboo accents and hipster Japanese decor. I came here for lunch and it was pretty busy. 

2. Service
I was a bit disappointed with the service I received here. I was seated at the bar right away and given water but then my server/bartender disappeared for 15 minutes so I couldn't place my order. Upon placing my order, I asked for more water and was ignored again. Food didn't come out for another 15 minutes, at this point I was pretty annoyed but was killing time so I decided to stay. When the food came out, I asked for my check and ended up getting that right away...

3. Presentation
Food was presented okay, I felt like everything was just tossed together on a plate since they were pretty easy. Half a point for this.

4. Taste
We got the pork belly buns, ramen, and chilled spicy noodle bowl. The pork belly buns were pretty tasty-pork was moist, succulent, and I loved how the pickled cucumbers balanced the saltiness of the hoisin sauce. I wasn't a big fan of the ramen, as the broth was really salty, I had to dilute it with some water. I had to get another slice of that pork belly to put into the ramen broth though! SO GOOD! The chilled spicy noodle bowl was a cross between a noodle salad with basil pesto dressing, surprisingly good, and light which was perfect since I didn't want anything heavy.

5. Value
For what it is Momofuku is overhyped and overpriced for what we received. $7/pork bun, $17 spicy chilled noodle bowl, and $18 for pork ramen is a bit steep. This is a place you'd visit once just to see what it's like but it's not a place you'd come to every time you're in town.",RiFFWJzlX43xodv3ldul9w,2,1,3,8pAJk6-67wR4tOfBVThPQw

We initially had three different reservations but somehow, we got lucky and they were able to put one extra table with the larger one so we could all be seated together.  Score!  

Food itself was disappointing as I had wanted to eat here (or the one in NYC) for a long time. 
Ramen at $17 or $18 for a small bowl was definitely not worth it - Daikokuya and Santouka still remain my two favorites.  We also ordered the Korean Short Ribs, which cost like $250!!  It was crazy expensive.  The meat was super tender but we each got like one or half a piece.  Crazy.  It's supposed to feed 6-8 but it is still way too expensive - again, getting this in Ktown is easier on the wallet and tastes better.  Lobster was okay - nothing special.  I did like the pork buns, which you order by the piece, and not sure it was worth $7 each.  Someone ordered some kind of noodle dish, which we barely touched.  It ended up being $110 pp, which was way too much for food that none of thought was great.  Overall food/price would be two stars but I gave them another star for the service.  Also, their cocktail menu is pretty limited - I didn't see anything I liked so I just asked the bar to make me something, which turned out fine.

It was our very first day in Vegas, our first meal in Vegas, and our FIRST TIME in Vegas. (no pressure) We were staying at the Cosmopolitan and side note the hotel was amazing. Definitely coming back for the hotel. We got at the restaurant mid afternoon. There was no line and they were not busy. I would say this is best time to come in.

Our server was knowledgeable of the menu. We told her it was our first time in the restaurant and asked for recommendations. I wanted ramen so bad but they only have two options for hot ramen. I saw the duck entree but didn't think twice because I don't eat duck. When the server gave us a gist of the menu, one that she recommended was the duck. So here I go again with, ""When in Vegas"" I tried something new, for the very first time. We ordered two appetizers to share, chilled brussel sprouts and crack potatoes. The brussels were good palate cleanser. They were light and didn't have an overwhelming flavor. The crack potatoes were addicting. They were crack alright. We also ordered the their famous bun, both pork and shrimp. They were delicious but for the portion I thought it was pricy. My girlfriend was excited because she can't eat duck around me because I don't eat it. 

Now with all the build up, we were excited for the duck. Everything so far has been tasty. Until the duck came. I took the first bite and all I could taste was salt. In my head I thought ""this is how it's supposed to taste."" So I got a little bit of the rice underneath to eat it with. To my horror the rice was salty too. Everything was so so salty. Working in hospitality in the F&B I try not to send food back. But this dish was so overwhelmingly salty I had to. We flagged our server down and told her that the dish was salty. She apologized and told us she will let the chef know. She also told us that she was either going to make a new one or have us order something else on the menu. 

We waited patiently. 

She came back and told us the Chef was informed and is already making a new one. (What happened to us ordering something else instead? Do we not get that option anymore?) I said thank you and the server walked away. My girlfriend and I had a little discussion and concluded that we no longer want to eat anymore because 1.We didn't have a choice whether we still want the duck and 2. we lost our appetite. We called our server and asked whether it was too late. She said she rang it in as soon as she returned the duck. She said she will go back and check. She came back to our table with the duck plate in hand. We stared at the dish and my girlfriend and I just looked at each other. 

By this point we just wanted to leave. We didn't touch the plate. The server came back and asked what was wrong with it. We said we weren't hungry anymore and if would could just have it boxed. We paid and still left twenty percent tip. We're not mean people, we just didn't enjoy the experience at all particularly our first meal in Vegas.",DTyjEnt1pC7gIVi5Md6wRQ,0,0,3,ApR7fpn5mKQ0MdZwP3eWBA

4523302,2017-05-08,7,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Momofuku.

Just the name itself is cute and makes you want to go out of your way to Cosmo. For the style of food, I think it's appropriately located in such a chic hotel. 

I heard great things about Momofuku in New York and I was super excited they opened one here. After a night of heavy partying (c'mon it's Vegas), carbs sounded like a good idea. 

If you know me, I'm like addicted to ramen. In fact, I even have a dedicated Yelp list for ramen. 

I came with a group of 3 for lunch and it wasn't too packed. Their menu is simple but has enough range for your every craving. 

Appetizer: Shishito Peppers, Sweet & Sour Snap Peas and Smoked Pork Belly

Main dish: Chickpea Ramen

The appetizers were a great start to the meal and it was worth its value. That pork belly though, was filled with delicious fat that basically gave your mouth a foodgasm. Just think of Shokugeki for you foodie lovers :)

The chickpea ramen also did not disappoint. Although service took a little long for it to come out, the pacing was good because we took our time with the appetizers and drinks. 

The chickepea combination was different and I'm not sure I would want it again the next time. I wasn't expecting the chickpeas to be fried so that was a surprise. I think it was the smart way, too, to give more texture to the bowl. This ramen did not have a lot of toppings as I usually like. The bok choy was tasty and I wanted more of that. No egg, which I was slightly disappointed. However, despite all unexpected surprises, the noodles were AMAZING. It was the kind of width, length, and texture that I look and love. The broth was also amazing. It was not fatty or oily but still carried a lot of richness that you couldn't know by looking at it. The ramen was lovely and rejuvenated my day. 

But the best part? As Milk Bar is next door, you can order their desserts here, too!!!!

I think they secretly want us to sit til dawn or something. 

Our waiter was FANTASTIC and the overall experience was nothing but great. Yummy food paired with good company and service deserves 5 stars.",pb-Fw9SjbDULRRO9LOP8gg,6,8,5,XjDpdMquHpmwNxVOFCsI6Q

If you haven't tried their pork belly bao and like pork belly, it is worth a try. It is a pretty big bao but is a bit expensive at $7. The pork belly is a thick long slab of tender fatty meat, and the combination with hoisin sauce is really delicious.

Their pork belly ramen ($18) is only available with shoyu broth, which is okay but didn't stand out (I was disappointed that tonkatsu broth was not available). They do include a very soft boiled egg which is nice.

Overall the food was pretty good (probably the best pork belly I've had in ramen), but not good enough to justify the price.",ZPN98PI53a9P7ZWM8V0qnw,1,1,3,KK4D5ECGv2c0Up4WUwZ48A

Anyways, I hoped with a net worth of 50 million, he would be making money off of delicious food and not crappy food...well I guessed right. 

Bookmarked it on Yelp and strolled into the Cosmopolitan this afternoon. I walked up quickly to the hostess' booth like the proud half asian that I am so excited for what was about to enter my mouth that I had the biggest sh** eating grin on. The hostesses greeted me with a less than eager response. Breathe lorynne, I said...you're just too hyped up for everyone right now. The hostess seated us immediately next to another couple. Mind you the restaurant was not busy and no one else was seated right on top of each other. I asked for a table two away from the nearest occupied table and we sat down. Our waitress came over and ran us through everything. I joked with my boyfriend about how she sensed I was Yelp Elite because her spiel was on point...very informative and very genuine. 

We ended up ordering a shrimp bun, pork bun, pork ramen and the chilled spicy noodles.  I'm not even sure how they made the shrimp but it was so rich and the texture was not cakey; just chunks of shrimp with a flavor punch of awesome. (You will see the picture, it's so hard to explain.) My pork ramen hit the spot. The broth was jammed with pork flavor; it wasn't a clear cheap broth lol. My egg on top was poached so when I poked it, it ran all over my noodles and basically gave me a foodgasm. The pork itself that was both in the bin and ramen was tender and fatty...just what every girl dreams of at night. 

We finish our food and a group of four sits next to us. They have our same waitress and I hear the same exact speech about the restaurant word for word. I no longer felt special and our waitress no longer felt personal. Fast forward, we grab the check and it's $54. My boyfriend puts $60 cash in, hands her the check and says thank you. Then after she walks away he pulls out $6 more dollars and says, ""I can just leave this on the table, right?"" I laugh because she probably thinks she is only getting $6 tip instead of the $12 tip that is actually over 20%. We start walking out towards the door and our waitress is talking about how little of tip we left her to the bartender who was grabbing her change. I told her that the rest was on the table and she giggles and says ""oh thank you so much"". Not very smart of her to talk like that right in the pathway to the exit. 

To the chef today, your food was perfect. David Chang, I see why your restaurants and you in general are so successful. But between the bitter hostesses and our waitress making such a silly error like talking bad about customers when they are right in the vicinity, it was a semi-rough visit.",xTd8Kwu6X7WVYKGlsA4h4Q,2,3,3,rMsIhXc-ELmvkmm16yOepg

The ambience is also pretty cool. From the high top we were sitting at if you look towards the back of the restaurant you could see the windows with all the light up signs outside and it really looked like a scene out of blade runner or something. I dunno I got a kick out of that.

I can't go 5 stars because of the price and the drink I had was meh. Had an old fashioned but the bourbon used or something was not that good. At $16 I expected better bourbon. 2 ramen bowls, 1 bun and 4 drinks was over $100.

Pork belly bun was so great! Soft, doughy bread, fatty pork belly in the middle. 

Ramen made the whole meal complete. It wasn't the best ramen I've had, but it was comforting and delicious. Adding spice to it definitely helped win over my taste buds. 

Everything was enjoyed with their Momofuku sake. Didn't know a bottle of sake was going to cost $88 (so probably wouldn't order that again) but it was a nice, light fruit sake and was enjoyed then and saved for more consumption later.

I approached the hostesses and asked what kind of food it was and they responded with ""do you want to see the menu"" which, I definitely did, but would have been delighted if they gave me a few words on their style of dining. They sat me immediately at the bar, and the bartender was super engaging. He asked me what kind of food I was interested in getting and I said vegetarian. He provided me with options, and was very detailed in his descriptions. I had a mushroom bun, a bizarre but tasty spicy almond cucumber appetizer (that he suggested) and the chick pea ramen. All of which were wonderful. The bartender accidentally gave me a bun instead of the cucumber appetizer but was very quick to correct his mistake. Apologized, and comped it.

4593214,2017-04-03,7,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I joined a friend for an early dinner at Momofuku at the Cosmo.  I'd been curious about Momofuku restaurants for ages, but I never had the opportunity to swing by one of the NYC outposts.  The new Strip location is convenient, and spacious too.

Momofuku knocks it out of the park in terms of atmosphere.  The front bar area is casual and lively, while the dining room in the back is more upscale, with an eye-popping panoramic view of the Strip.  (Seriously, request a window seat when making your reservation.)

After being seated, our server came by to take our orders.  We skipped the booze this time around, instead choosing to indulge in an array of different buns -- pork belly, shrimp, and chicken karaage.  The karaage was easily my favorite, with a nice crisp and tender center.  The shrimp was tasty too, but a little on the briny side.  While my guest loved the pork belly, I found it too fatty and gristly.  (I think we just had very different expectations.)

Where Momofuku knocks it out of the park is the ramen.  I had the chickpea ramen with scallions, chickpea miso, and bokchoy.  I absolutely loved the rich, miso-infused broth, and the doneness of the bokchoy.  The superstars of the dish were the crispy chickpeas sprinkled generously on top, which are addictive in both texture and flavor.

Service is friendly and efficient; the prices are hilariously out-of-control.  I get that the Cosmo is a high-rent space, but the prices are literally twice what they should be.  

Minor gripes aside, I'm 99% sure I'll be back to Momofuku -- if for no other reason than that chickpea ramen.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,10,10,4,UqnqzaRPFoAtOWOtOhVgIg

The service was really quick. We walked right in and received a table. We informed our server we were there just before a concert. He took our order quickly and the food seemed to arrive immediately. We were very appreciate of his quick response and delivery. 
We loved the quick walk from the T-Mobile Arena. On a concert or game night this spot is a short walk from the bustling Arena-area. Those dining spots were telling us 60-90 minute waits. We were able to make it down to the restaurant, eat and walk back in just over one hour.

The interior is gorgeous and the views are even better! From the outside, it looks like a small restaurant. Once you walk inside, a huge dining space opens up and you get a beautiful view of the strip.

Our group decided to order some apps, dishes and split a bo ssäm. Sadly, my pork bunz were poorly put together and the meat didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth tenderness like how I remembered in NYC. Also, not cool that our server never brought out ssäm sauce for us.

Our bo ssäm order consisted of a slow-roasted pork shoulder accompanied with oysters, rice, bibb lettuce, kimchi and sauces. It's basically ribs and rice wrapped in lettuce. It was a lot of pork for four people, so I'd suggest splitting it with a bigger group, unless you plan on ordering bo ssäm only.

Shrimp bun- it's a bao bun with shrimp cake with spicy mayo. It was decent. But for $8 a piece it wasn't amazing for the price.

Ssam sauce- they say it's their hot sauce, but it really isn't hot sauce. Its basically korean gochujang (red pepper paste). Usually used in things like bibimbap. 

Chilled spicy noodles- this is what I had ordered. It was chilled noodles with crumbled sichuan sausages, crushed cashew nuts and basil and peppers. The noodles was mixed in some sort of green sauce (maybe a basil type sauce?) I dont know, but it was rather bland. Combine all the ingredients of the sausage and peppers in a bite and then you have some flavor. The sausages in the dish was a bit salty for me. I added the ssam sauce to my noodles to give it more flavor 

Rotisserie chicken- So a friend ordered this dish..close to the bone the chicken was under cooked and a bit raw.

David Chang's new outpost in the Cosmopolitan brings several of his NYC menus together under one roof and does not disappoint.  This laid-back approach to high-fashion cuisine is about as good as it gets for the already crowded ""Asian fusion"" segment.  Set in a gorgeous new space with floor-to-ceiling windows in the main dining room, you'll want to start your meal off with something from the bar.  Innovative cocktails are pricey but boozy and flavourful, and there's an extensive wine and sake menu to choose from should you prefer to steer clear of the hard stuff.  If nothing strikes your fancy, ask Josh to dream something up - you won't be disappointed.  Menu standouts include the flavour packed fried softshell crab bun starter, the spicy rice cakes, mussels, and the whole seabass if you're into large format and dining with a group.  The aforementioned mussels dish really highlights the inventiveness of the menu - a dry roasted preparation with Benton's Bacon. My only lament is that the chilled spicy noodle has been tamed to an almost unrecognisable ""mild"" compared to Noodle Bar's original.

The ramen was about $18 and the buns were $7 each and they're a decent sized portion.

As for main courses, my two favorites were the spicy Sichuan rice cakes and steamed mussels.  

Usually not a big fan of Korean rice cakes but they pan fried the rice cakes, so it's crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Super spicy if you are a mild type of person. 

Steamed mussels were great! Not over-cooked and all the mussels had just opened up. Flavor of the sauce was great too!! 

The fried brussel sprouts were slightly disappointing because it wasn't crispy like EMC's fried brussel sprouts. A little bit too sweet for the sauce as well and not crispy enough. 

The smothered chicken katsu was really yum but because it was a cream dish, it was a little bit too heavy for me.

4924678,2017-03-19,5,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"We were lucky to come across this new restaurant that just opened a month ago on our trip to Vegas this past February. Both the bf and his sister are fans of David Chang and to our surprise, we were actually able to see him that night while dining there. Apparently there was a Yelp Elite Event that I had NO IDEA about or else I would have signed up!! Seeing David Chang totally made their night, even if was just for a second before the servers closed up the blinds and obstructed their view haha. 
 
We had made reservations for dinner, without knowing that their hours were updated to include lunch as well. Too bad...Momofuku had some pretty interesting stuff on the lunch menu, but we were impressed by dinner nonetheless. Their menu is updated DAILY - which is crazy to me. We ordered a variety of things and decided to do family style and share so we could try out a little of everything.   

PORK BELLY BUNS (2 per order) $14 - hoisin, scallion, cucumber. These were kind of pricey at $7 each for a tiny bun, but we wanted to get them cause of the popularity. I've had better buns and they were nothing special. It was alright for an appetizer. If I were to return - would definitely pass on it. 

MOMOFUKU OYSTERS $28 - broiled with kimchi, spinach, bacon. MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT. 10 total oysters and I probably ate more than half myself. They were SOOOO good. Just the right amount of spicy and crunchy from the kimchi and bacon. I secretly wanted to have the whole plate of oysters to myself. Add in a bowl of rice to make a complete meal and I would have been in heaven.  

SPICY SICHUAN RICE CAKES $21 - pork sausage, broccoli, crispy onions. At first, I was really excited to try them because I usually like spicy food. However... took one bite and my mouth/tongue felt like it was on fire and burning. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to fully enjoy the rice cakes, but my other 2 tablemates loved this dish very much. Glad that they were able to handle the spicyness and finish the plate themselves! This was my least favorite...due to my weak taste buds and/or the strong Sichuan sauce.

SWEET & SOUR LONG BEANS $8. Just like the name itself, this dish was super simple but to our surprise, it was delicious. We needed some type of veggie dish with our dinner to make it seem like it we were eating somewhat healthy lol. The long beans did not taste at all that bad like green vegetables usually do. In fact, whatever sweet & sour sauce they coated the beans in had such great flavor that it made me forget I was even eating beans. SECOND FAVORITE of the night. 

STEAMED RICE $4. I'm Chinese and we need rice with every meal daily, so you know I had to order a bowl. 

CRACK PIE $6.50 - oat crust with a gooey butter filling. We were planning to go to Milk Bar afterwards, but decided to just get dessert at Momofuku. Everyone raved about the crack pie, so obviously we had to get it. It's a small slice that's packed with ooey, gooey goodness. I loved the toasted crust and the filling inside was amazing.   

Knowing that it's Vegas, you're kind of expected to pay a premium for everything. Momofuku had some hit and misses with the food for me... but overall, I did enjoy everything. I also liked the service and ambiance of the restaurant. Side note, I went into the women's restrooms and they have heated toilets!! It amazed me so much that I spent some time in there trying it out lol... anyway I did have a wonderful time with good company and now I can say that I was able to dine at a David Chang restaurant.",29XxHvrJAyvuRaPXu_h-QA,12,13,4,JM5fy4XBuYMg-Ef_Uam0iw

My three girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and spent a whopping 5+ hours here sitting, eating, drinking, and talking.  I think that's kinda what David Chang would want his guests to experience.  

We ordered a variety of buns - vegetarians, there's a shitake mushroom bun that's not on the menu, but our server mentioned that they could make it for me and I HIGHLY recommend - the peach burrata salad, noodles, rice cakes, the brussel sprouts & cauliflower and the shishito peppers, and lamb.  Everything was impeccable.  My favorites were the shitake mushroom bun, garlic and onion noodles, and the shishito peppers.  For dessert, we had the funfetti birthday cake and that my friends was the cherry on top of the perfect dinner.  Once our waiter noticed that we had befriended a nearby bachelor party, he also brought us over some chocolate truffles to go with our wine which was so kind of him.  

The four of us had an unforgettable experience here, and even though three glasses of wine were broken and spilled in the process, the staff was so friendly and let us have so much fun well after we were done dining.  

100% coming here the next time I'm in Vegas!!!",3hse6Ud4QZaEITqe6NsAFw,0,0,5,G3VDP2milhFjwKpCsyVtLQ
4929114,2018-01-28,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Momofuku is located on the second floor of The Cosmopolitan Hotel on The Strip. I made an 8:30 pm reservation for dinner on a Saturday. Our table was ready by 8:35 pm. I was very impressed with the venue. The restaurant was much bigger than I expected and I was seated in a quieter back room with a beautiful view of the 'Eiffel Tower' and Paris Tower. I found the service to be excellent. There was a server specifically assigned to remove dishes and fill water glasses. I don't think I ever had a water glass that was less than half full. The only issue was when bringing out our main dishes a server accidentally placed them on a neighboring table. Realizing the mistake he immediately took the dishes back to the kitchen and put in a rushed reorder. So it took a little longer than average to get the food. However, the servers explained and genuinely apologized for their mistake. They also comped us their crispy potatoes and market greens small plates without us having to ask!! Overall, environment was excellent, service was outstanding, and food was great. Five stars earned without contest. 

Food Reviews: 
Small plates:

'Market Greens': this item was complimentary due to the situation described above. It included cauliflower and Brussels sprouts roasted in an Asian-inspired marinade, topped with apples. It was great for being a plate of vegetables, but it didn't stand apart as unique. I wouldn't order this myself. 

'Crispy Potatoes': this item was also complimentary. It included 'bite-sized' potatoes, ham, and seasoning, topped upon delivery by server with a unique Momofuku cheese sauce. This dish was heavy, but extremely good. If you're super hungry, I'd recommend getting this appetizer. I would order this small plate again. 

'Sichuan Lamb Ribs': this was actually my first time eating both Ribs and Lamb so I don't have much to compare this dish to. But the ribs were melt in your mouth quality and very well marinated. Excellent dish, but very fatty. This is also a very filling plate. I personally wouldn't describe it as a small plate. Would be filling as an entree. 

'Black Truffle Ramen': I ordered this dish first and foremost to try truffles. Again, it was my first time eating truffles so I don't have much to compare to. But this dish was excellent. The Ramen broth heavily over-shined the noodles. Truffles and egg yolk gave the ramen a powerful and satisfying flavor. If you like truffles, you'll like this dish. 

'Crispy Unagi': I saved this for last as it was actually my favorite dish. The Momofuku 'buns' lived up to their hype. They taste like bread, but have a marshmallow-like consistency. Also, the bacon mayo was awesome. My only regret here was that I didn't order a second bun. They are pretty small. 

If I ever return to Momofuku, I would order a bit different. I ate a lot of heavy foods which made me uncomfortably full. I would most likely order more of their vegetable starters opposed to meat-based and then order two buns and split a Ramen.",zGgGcUeUapVoL1UX4Ny1-g,0,0,5,GSRIoenDaN1qDJk7e_PWPw

The bun is similar to what you get at a Peking duck restaurant: white bun, cucumber, sauce plus the meat, basically not streamed but sandwiched together. Afterwards I ordered a pork ramen, it tasted good, the broth was rich but not salty (a lot of ramen places I've tried have broth too salty for my taste).

Friends and I were interested in this restaurant because it was ramen in Las Vegas strip and from watching ""Mind of a Chef"" show.  After making the reservation, there was still a short wait for our table of 10.
After getting seats, our waiter was awesome and got us water orders in but then things went from great to not so good.  We hung out, chatted, chilled and our orders of pork belly bun came 20 minutes later.  It was tasty and really simple. The pork fatty was a big portion of the slice so if you are afraid of eating fat, don't get it.  After finishing that, we continue to wait.  Another 25 minutes passed, one ramen came.  The friend that got the ramen started eating and everyone was still waiting.  Then another ramen came 5 minutes later, another ramen came. 2 minutes after, most of our ramen came except for one of my friend's.  The last bowl of ramen came after we asked the waiter to check up on it. 
It was poorly timed as the first person got the ramen finished his in 10 minutes and the last person was still waiting.
Food: the bun was great and when I got my Pork Ramen, it turns out to be the same pork piece in the bun is the same in my ramen.  The taste was a interesting and not your typical ramen flavor.  Some people may like it, but it wasn't my liking.
Service other than waiting for our food was attentive. He constantly came by and refilled our water, touched up the table.

The Mister and I stopped for a late lunch - he was starving and I wanted something light. Momofuku handled both well! The space is spare and modern - expect a fun menu of fusion delights made for sharing. 

I opted for spicy cucumbers ($9) which were fresh, light and wonderfully spicy. This would be an amazing start to dinner or a tasty choice for veggie lovers. The Mister opted for a pork bun ($7) which was good but kind of a rip for the price. His shoyu ramen ($17) was really good though - full of nice al dente noodles, a smoky broth and topped with a perfectly poached egg. 

If you still have room, they'll charge you $14 for a piece of cake. Vegas, baby.

Con's: N/A

I happened to be in town when they opened and was able to get a reservation on the second night. Never really travelling to the east coast, I was so happy to see Momofuku treading west. We decided to try as much as we could considering they just opened and we won't be back for some time. There was an issue where only one of our buns came out instead of two, but I'm not the type of person to go crazy. Things happen, if I see them trying to fix it, I'm good. Not a fan of long reviews, but just breaking down my thoughts:

Soft Boiled Eggs: Highly recommend - really savory, soft, and the crispy rice cake topped on it adds a nice crunchy texture. When you get that roe with your bite, that smokiness comes out, its good.

Pork Belly bun - Highly recommend - The pork was so savory, rich, and fatty. When you take a bite, it just melts. A bit messy, but you know the slogan.. if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face.

Chicken Karaage bun - When you bite down, you get that crunch from the crispiness. The flavor is good, but the whole bun thing didn't work for me. I would much prefer to eat the karaage by itself.

Oysters Momofuku - All of the flavors combined really reminded me of uni udon. It has a creamy texture with some crunch, it flows together nicely. A little bit on the salty side, but not a bad dish. Note, it feels like a hot dish - so don't expect that half shell drizzling lemon stuff.

Black Winter Truffle Ramen - Noodles cooked well, rich thick broth, good flavor. Aside from the truffle itself, it felt a little plain. Maybe I've gotten used to eating ramen with a bunch of stuff in it, but the overall flavor is good.

Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes - Highly recommend - There aren't many places that make rice cake crispy, and I was not disappointed. That spice is packed, not too salty, flavor is on point. Bite size pieces make it easy to just plop into your mouth. I wanted to eat more, but this was the last dish out.. so I probably would've exploded.

Overall: Would come back again to try other things on the menu. Portion sizes are good so you don't feel like you're over eating unless you ordered a lot like we did. Food comes out pretty quickly and the service is attentive. Also, you're not really breaking the wallet coming here, which is always a plus.",UYHw5rIQpfz2cv1e2DKp1Q,0,0,4,ePSkhwDrWCDSI9AsNDc_MA

When we asked about it they explained the cucumbers were soaked in salt and sugar overnight to extract moisture from the vegetable. It was absolutely fabulous. The rest of the meal was also very good. We had a couple of fish entrées which were very tasty, then finished with the lobster tails and duck. The duck presentation was very fun. It included carving of the duck breast at the table and a foie gras spread across rice topped with the slices of duck breast. Very tender and tasteful.

4970165,2017-09-15,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Dinner was good. 

It's pretty much family style. They have the large style dining menu that is essentially just a really expensive large entree to share. The large entrees start at $188 per plate. The smallest serving 2-4 people, up to 4-8 person dishes. The most expensive being $1499, fish with caviar, if I remember correctly.  

We opted to do 2 ""smaller"" entrees, to give ourselves more variety. Each of the two were meant to serve 2 people. With 4 adults and 3 kids with us, this seemed the better route. 

We got the Salt n Pepper Lobster and Shrimp, which tasted like your typical Salt n Pepper Crab, just with Lobster and Shrimp. A peel and eat dish.  Not a big Lobster fan, but this lobster was sweet and moist. The Shrimp also very tasty. A little kick on the outside but not too much that the kids couldn't have a bite of the inside. Served on a bed of fried jalepenos and hot peppers. $99. Definitely fed 4 adults, we were getting full toward the end. 

The Salmon Steak was our second dish, $50. Salmon was pan seared, a little rare on the inside. A really big slice. Pretty good, nothing to write home about. The kids loved it though. 

The Pork Belly buns - delicious! So fatty and tasty, melt in your mouth goodness. $7 each. Should have gotten more of these.

Plain pork ramen for the kids. Regular ramen was going to be spicy. This was literally just pork broth and ramen. $15. ($2 less than Regular). If I'm going to pay $15 for my ramen, it's going to have pork belly, soft boiled melty egg, 36 hour stewed broth... This? For the kids? I should have known better. 

Service was great. Forgot his name, but he liked us, we liked him. I tipped well, since he doesn't set the prices.

We were full. Almost couldn't finish. We forced ourselves to though, given the price. 

All is said and done, $250. 

Good experience. A little overpriced for what is was, but then again, it is Vegas. Nice ambiance. The bathrooms have bidets and the toilets are blue.",AkOzwpi2397h58rr1FjNfQ,0,1,4,BXWCwdM22n8w5R1WeEIixQ

We came in for dinner, but we were seated in the front/bar area which was away from the main dining rooms. According to my boyfriend, the décor was more upscale and it had some awesome window views. 

Dinner menu options are more of family style. I can't comment on the portions or taste, but the prices were pretty crazy. I think an entrée order of short ribs was priced at over $100, which was way out of our budget. We like David Chang for his experience with noodles, especially ramen. So we both ordered Pork Ramen. 

The ramen was good... for a soup. The broth doesn't really hit home as ""ramen"" in my opinion. The noodles were cooked well. There was shredded pork, charred pork belly (this was the best part of the entire meal), and a poached egg rather than soft boiled egg. The portion was a bit small, but noodles are always filling. All this for $18, but I personally felt like it was a $12-14 bowl of soup. I guess you're paying for the décor/environment as well as your food. But being that we weren't seated in the nicer area it made it pointless to have to shell out $18 for a bowl of soup. 

Service was whatever. For an upscale restaurant, I find it tacky when servers constantly try to upsell their customers. Every time our server came to check on us, he opened conversation with: ""Ok are we ready for a round of shots?"" to refill waters: ""So how about those tequila shots?!"" I only wish I had the woman-balls to tell him to chill with his try-hard pants.

The shrimp bao was okay. It comes out in patty form, but has a good chunkiness to it so you know it's really shrimp. Unfortunately, it was a bit under flavored. The ramen was also good, but not what I was hoping for. I love a great, creamy, pork tonkatsu. However, the type of soup they use here is not creamy, just broth.

We didn't have reservations; however, they weren't necessary since we arrived at the restaurant before 6PM and the dining room and even the bar was largely empty that early in the evening's service.   As a result, we were seated immediately.

I started off with a cocktail, the Toki Thyme ($16) made with Suntory Toki Japanese whiskey, apricot, pink peppercorn, and garnished with a dehydrated orange wheel and thyme.  It was an aesthetically appealing, tasty, well-made drink.  For our food, the wife and I shared orders of the Shishito Peppers ($9), an Unagi (freshwater eel) Bun ($9), and a Shiitake Bun ($7).  All of our selections were delicious.  To my recollection, the shishito peppers were better this trip than they were on my previous visit to Las Vegas and Momofuki last March.  For my main, I had a bowl of the Truffle Ramen ($50).  Was it pricey and over-the-top?  Hell yeah!  However, it was a good-sized bowl of ramen and it was a serious umami-fest with a generous amount of grated black truffle.

All in all, while it may be on the pricey end of the spectrum for what you get, Momofuku delivered a solid all-around dining experience especially given its Strip location.

Kind of disheveled, potentially high and lover of salty food. LOVE IT. 

So you would not believe my surprise when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas when I heard there was a Momofuku and Milk Bar... I practically hightailed it there the second I could. 

We kept it simple and ordered the Scallion Ginger Noodles, the Benton Ham Mussels and the Pork Belly and Chicken Karaage bun. 

In most to least liked: Bun(s), Mussels, and the Ginger Scallion Noodles. And here is why: 

The buns were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. They serve it with the ssam sauce, the pork belly was cooked to perfection. Low and slow and then lightly crisped, served with some hoisin and cucumbers it's perfection in a bun. The chicken one was equally delicious and if I had to write about it, it would go like this- ""Get the chicken Karaage you (insert expletive)!"" 

The Mussels are dry roasted meaning they are put on a hot griddle and cooked like that until they open. Then they are tossed with benton ham bits that seems to have been reduced with onions. It's equally salty, sweet and fully of flavor. I just wished they served it with some buns or bread so you could soak up the liquid at the bottom, but that's only a small slight. 

Then the Ginger / Scallion noodles.... this I was the most disappointed in. I would have asked for salt from the staff, but my mother taught me never to say anything if I only had bad things to say. The flavor was ultra subtle and lacked some depth aside from the ginger/scallion oil tossed with the noodles. The shitake's and cucumbers that accompanied the dish were good, but didn't add much in my opinion. 

Overall- I would come back. I liked the food I ordered and would come back to try the other things on the menu. Specifically the $60 bowl of truffle ramen.... the only reason I didn't order it was I didn't want to seem boujee in front of the person I was with...you know who you are. 

Anyways, for sure check this place out if you have a chance, it's worth a stop anytime.",UJu9I_pKdrjHmiwR164K-w,0,1,5,uTGdIyKhWOY96Z0QmW_Ovw
5045227,2018-02-06,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"A BIG FAT YES. 

Dinner was so good it got our homebody friend who rarely leaves his home state talking about making a group trip to NYC. Legit, this food blew his damn mind and gave him courage and a taste for adventure.

Momofuku done right will give you something you don't usually get from most other restaurants: a spiritually-authentic Asian dining experience. It's elevated pan-Asian cuisine that feels like it was made for a huge celebration with family.  

You can taste the love chef David Chang has for his mom's cooking, for big dinners with extended families and the family friends you'd call Auntie and Uncle, and for Asian food. These are flavors you only get if you go local and you happen upon someone who learned how to pickle from grandma or a street vendor who came up with a sauce so crackalicious there's a line to his cart before he opens. This is the real deal, folks. I'm Chinese-American - the 'Fuke is the only restaurant I've ever wanted to take my parents to bc it's that freaking good. This place takes me back to my mom's kitchen, night markets, and grandma's table. If you are Asian or love Asian food, you owe it to yourself eat here. 

To maximize your 'Fuke experience, go all-in on family dining. Grab a few good friends and make a reservation. Get a round of cocktails to open the stomach, as we say in Chinese. Order off the large format menu, which features main dishes with accompaniments, add a few buns (pork belly is a must), and any other items that strike your fancy. 

Hot Tip: aim for a variety of textures and flavors. This is the key to crafting a solid experience at any Asian restaurant.

These dishes are meant for sharing so you and your mates can collectively roll your eyes back in your head as the expletives tumble forth rapturously: ""holy f***, this sh** is so f******* good, mother of god,"" etc. 

At least, that's what our group sounded like. Here's what the four of us ordered: 

1.) Sichuan Lamb Ribs - Yo, this lamb fell right off the bone and just melted in the mouth. No exaggeration. Get it.

2.) Spicy Rice Cakes - Rice cakes are crackalicious already but these had a crispy outside from being pan fried - so good my bf scraped the rest of the sausage at the bottom of the bowl onto his plate bc he couldn't bear to waste it.

3.) Pork Belly Bun - It's fatty, caramelized, and generous, exactly how pork belly should be. The steamed bun has a silky, luxurious texture. Best bun I've ever had - so good I wish my bun-making grandma was still around so I could treat her.

4.) Bo Ssam, half order - this is a large-format order: a big cut of pork shoulder marinated and slow-cooked to the point where it falls apart at the slightest touch. Accompaniments include bibb lettuce, rice, kimchi, raw oysters, hoisin, ssam sauce, and ginger scallion oil. You take your lettuce and fill it with whatever you like (and there are tons of flavor and texture permutations!) and eat it. 

Dude, this bo ssam. THIS BO SSAM. The meat was so good it got two of us re-thinking our laziness in the kitchen bc we knew we needed to learn to slow-cook pork shoulder like this. That's right, it made me want to put more effort into cooking. What sorcery is this!? The kimchi was fermented but still tasted super fresh and clean. My dudes, even the rice was perfectly cooked. It stuck together but stayed fluffy. Our server tipped us off to stuffing the fillings into some steamed buns and brought out four for us. DO IT. Hell, order two plates of steamed buns. You will die and go to foodie heaven, which totally exists.

It's a great deal. We stuffed ourselves silly and still rolled out w a bag of leftovers. 

If you are dining with two, get a few plates to share and again, aim for a variety of flavors and textures (your server can help you with this). 

If you're solo or there late at night, pony up to the noodle bar for ramen and buns. It's cozy and warm and no one will bother you if you just want to look down and shovel noodles into your drunk face - exactly how late-night noodles should be. 

The staff is the coolest, friendliest bunch you'll meet on the Strip. They welcome you like family. Each time I've come here, I've had great convos with my servers, bartenders, and cooks. They give fantastic recommendations bc they like good food, too. 

We stop in every time we're in Vegas. This food can inspire you to eat more meaningfully, connect more deeply, live more fully. I've seen it happen.",-EuXDbUI5Xkmq2tTf5SIIA,0,0,5,IjSHlsmteDGRPZeaBqh4uw

The bar has a really cool decor and laid back vibe and good tunes playing. I believe Eric B.& Rakim was on the box as we were seated so, oh yeah, it's time for drinks. I had an IPA. The wife ordered a bourbon cocktail which she wasn't really feeling so she asked for the Mojito Slushie instead. Our server, Caesar was happy to oblige. He gladly whisked it away and apologized. (not his fault) within minutes, bartender Josh showed up with the Mojito Slushie (delicious). and a complimentary order of the Spicy cucumber with toasted almond appetizer, which I assume was to make up for my wife's drink. This was totally unnecessary but so appreciated. We couldn't get enough of these cucumbers. Seriously, I could've just had a giant bowl of these, a spoon, another beer and I'd have been set!

The pork belly bun was one of my favorites. that pork was really tasty, seasoned great and just fatty enough. The bun was very fresh made and very soft. It was great.
The pork ramen was also delicious. I understand it's hit and miss for alot of poeple here and I'm no ramen expert by any means but I found it to be very good, perhaps a tad on the salty side but the slow poached egg added a fantastic richness to the salt of the pork and the delicious broth. My wife ordered the chilled spicy noodles which were also killer. They were almost like a tasty cold noodle salad with just the right amount of spicy bite, so good.

We also had to try the Crack Pie a la mode for dessert  but we weren't really feelin it. This Crack pie just wasn't our thing. 

I thought the portions were just right. Again, our server's name was Caesar and he was on point. He never left us hanging and we felt well taken care of. Props to bartender Josh on those Mojito Slushies and his great service as well. Also we had an issue with a receipt after we left, (totally my fault) so i had to return the following day to talk to Richard, the manager on duty. 
(I believe that was his name, accent, glasses?)  He was extremely helpful in resolving my issue, which i felt bad about because he had to search through receipts from the day prior which I'm sure ate up a bit of his valuable time. He was extremely professional in assisting me and quickly took care of the problem and seemed happy to help us. The entire staff here really tacked on the 5th star for us. 

We had a great overall experience at Momofuku. We loved the food. The staff and service were top notch all the way around. We'll be back next time to try dinner.",6ML9UqOdWeezy_O1PJngtg,1,1,5,HjVpcxtOZ9LyFgRYGEvPwg

This is bold, bad a$$ food that will leave you stinking of garlic and reeking of kim chi, an uname finish swirling up your nasal cavity and F'n wiith your brain.  

Flavors are extremely bold with Korean influences unrestrained. 

The Momofuku oysters, think Rockefellers with kimchi, spinach and bacon, impressive.  The sour, fermented notes of the kimchi boost the briny flavor of the oysters.  A dusting of breadcrumbs adds great texture.  The spice, purifies the sweetness.  The bigeye tuna dressed with bonji (similar to miso but made of fermented grains), and covered in shavings of freeze dried foie.  The result, beautiful. Earthy, mineraly, in all the right ways, that pleasantly boosts the ""fishy"" flavor of the tuna.

Tip:  for parties of three or more, skip to the ""Large Format Dining"", solid items served family style.

The Bo Ssam, outstanding.  Dry rubbed pork, roasted for hours before being topped by a raw sugar caramel glaze.  Fall apart tender.  Grab a leaf of lettuce, pull off some pork, add rice, kim chee, a dollop of the spicy ssam sauce and toss on a raw, juicy, kushi oyster, the harmony of flavors is impressive.  Sweet, sour, spicy, porky with the perfect umami finish.

The five spice rotisserie duck is equally impressive.  The carcass, legs and thighs removed, is dry rubbed with Chinese five spice powder.  The flavors, epically the star anise permeate the breast to the bone. The finished duck is sliced and served on a bed of crisp rice mixed with shredded, confit legs and thigh meat.  Residual duck fat flavors the rice while the extremely aromatic breast scent the air.  Some ssam sauce and OMG!  

It's not to say everything is perfect.  The pork ramen, isn't that special.  The noodles are more Chinese than Japanese, lacking high gluten and flavor only achieved by using multiple kinds of flour.  The broth is frankly, boring.  Also the pork belly bao is passé.  Done by so many.  It lacks the wow factor to justify the $7 price per.

Good selection of craft cocktails, decent selection of Asian beverages, beer, and wine.  High Vegas resort markup.

We came here a few weeks ago with my husbands client. We wanted Ramen. And we didn't know that they only serve it for lunch. 
When we saw the dinner menu, we were like, ""what the fuck?""
For dinner, it's family style and expensive as shit. 

I've been to so many places on the strip that are from $10 a person to $200 a person. For 3 of us, we spent rougly $360, with tip. Do I think it was worth that price? No. How much was it worth? About $120...ish. 

The food was good, but nothing spectacular. And honestly? This is your average joint on the strip. ""We're new and innovative!"" No, you're not. Cool decor doesn't make you good. But because you're on the strip, you can get away with this absurd prices. Was the quality good? Yes. But again, I wasn't insanely impressed with anything other than their selection of Japenese Whisky and their buns, hun.

The dishes we all shared (With my 1-5 star ratings):

Crab Deviled eggs ***
Pork Belly ****
Korean Braised Short Rib***
Crispy Potatoes ** - way too thick of cream that you may gag on.
Chicken Karaage ** It's fried chicken. Can't do much more with it. 
Pork Belly Bun ***** - best/cheapest thing there. 

Oh, and the service was not good. The lady that filled our water 15 times, was nice and great. But we had to flag our waiter each time we needed anything. 

Will I go back? For ramen, yes. Am I opposed to spending decent money on great food? No. But there are a pretty heafty handful of places on the strip that really deserve that status and price, in my opinion. And this place falls short for me.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,31,14,2,MeD-B6G6UXBOdy21960QBg

This is what we ordered:
Bigeye Tuna
Sichuan Lamb Ribs
Ginger Scallion Noodles
4 ounces of A5 Hokkaido Wagyu
Spring Fling cocktail
Bonji Old Fashioned
Peruvian Sour Cocktail
Yuzu Lemonade 

Our favorites were the Wagyu, Lamb ribs, Tuna, and the yuzu lemonade. We really wanted the Black Truffle Ramen but it wasn't on the menu when we went. The cocktails were pretty good however the yuzu lemonade outshined them. It was a flavor of citrus that was familiar but completely new at the same time. I loved the shaved fois gras and strawberry with the tuna. It was sweet and complex. Best way to start the meal. The lamb was exceptionally tender and flavorful. The wagyu was cooked in front of us and served with raw egg yolk, bonji, and fermented yuzu. It was delicious. The only thing that wasn't much to rave about was the Ginger Scallion Noodles and I think the pacing of how they served us was to blame. The food was not staggered to allow us to finish our food before the next plate came out. This was especially frustrating when our expensive Wagyu came out and we had just been served the lamb and noodle dish moments before. Since the wagyu was so pricey and they put on a show for us, we were forced to ignore the other food on the table as it was getting cold. The lamb was still to die for but the noodles stiffened into a block and became difficult to mix with the toppings. Judging based on the noodles being cold they weren't very flavorful. Everything sort of blended together and the only flavor or texture came from the ginger and mushroom. Even though the noodles weren't great, we had a great meal and will be visiting other David Chang restaurants in the future.",e8bSD80xsJq5acnnctsz7A,0,0,5,TL3bLJm53ZPt_dOfsVioyg

Ordered:
A. ginger scallion noodles - quite good, a little oily but overall tasty
B. pork ramen - I do think the ramen is nothing out of the ordinary, but in my opinion, it seems people judge it more harshly based on the price, which isn't exactly fair because you're on the strip in Vegas..what are you expecting to spend at an established restaurant? It tastes fine and better than other reviews indicate
C. shrimp bun - most unique item we tried - had two of them and enjoyed this the most :)
D. pork belly bun - same pork used in the ramen, also good but not as unique

Momofuku is a casual sit down restaurant with a cool vibe.  We walked in on a weekday evening to the music bumpin' and were seated right away.  The dinner menu is geared towards family-style dining, so you can share dishes and the food comes out of the kitchen as it's ready instead of all at once.  

I knew I wanted to try their famous Pork Ramen ($17) and Pork Bun ($7).  The pork bun came out first and was tasty.  The bun was soft and light, and the pork belly had a nice crispy char.  The only thing I didn't like was that the pork was very fatty.  The ramen is not on the dinner menu, but they will serve it.  It was slightly disappointing from the get-go because it didn't come out piping hot.  The broth was savory and flavorful, but salty.  Not the best ramen ever, but it was a filling bowl with pork belly, shredded pork, a fish cake, a perfectly poached egg and veggies.      

To balance out all the pork, we also shared the Steamed Whole Branzino ($68).  This fish dish had interesting flavors of lemon, herbs and brown butter dashi.  The brown butter gave it a richness, but the lemon and pickled veggies took over the dish.  If you like tangy, citrus dishes, this might be for you.

They serve desserts from their sister bakery next door, Milk Bar.  Since it was my birthday, I was treated to birthday cake truffles.  This was a really sweet gesture, figuratively and literally.

Overall the food was pretty good, but in my mind I expected more from a James Beard award winning chef.",c_HRWeQtTIyT1ICK09C6FQ,4,3,3,iHUP20KOke8YCeo0lM-RzQ

I came here with 10 people. Two people in our group ate their own meals and the rest of us ate everything family style.

For those of who ate family style we ordered the following:

Starters:
Pork belly buns
Shrimp buns
Shishito Peppers
Horizon Rice Cakes

Mains:
Rack of Beef Short Rib
5 Spice Rotisserie Duck 

Everything was amazing! I preferred the shrimp buns over the pork belly buns so if you limit yourself to one - I'd recommend the shrimp. Don't be intimidated by the shishito peppers - only 1 in 20 is spicy. We ate the whole bowl and none of ours were spicy! Very delicious, especially if you did then in the hot sauce they bring out (the hot sauce isn't that hot).  The Rice Cakes were simply amazing - I'd compare these to gnocchi, sooo good! I love that they were crispy. 

The beef short rib and 5 spice duck were phenomenal. The presentation is really impressive too. The waitstaff bring the whole duck out, cut it in front of you, and then deep fry the bones and bring those back to the table! Please do yourself a favor and get them both! 

As a bonus - stop next door to Milk Bar and pick yourself up a piece of crack pie! Amazing.

I've been a fan of David Chang foreverrrr (he is listed as my ""current crush"" on Yelp, lol) never got to visit any of his restaurants before this one so I was stoked. Tried to make reservations, but there weren't any available so we tried our luck at a walk-in around 8pm on Saturday 2/18 and we were seated almost immediately. 

Lucky us, we sat right there at the ramen bar where we could watch the chefs! My god, you should have seen my face light up that's exactly where I wanted to sit. 

FOOOOOOD: 

Spicy cucumbers - yummmmm, mixed together with macadamia nuts and avocado these spicy cucumbers were really good. even my avocado hating guy liked these. 

Pickled vegetables - we barely made a dent in this. liked the kimchi a lot, radish didn't seem very pickle-y, melon was my least favorite. should have ordered more cucumbers. 

Pork belly buns - typical bao, nothing too special about these. they had a bit too much hoisin and the pork was not crispy like I wanted it to be, had a fatty texture. could have used more cucumbers in here too. 

Pork chop small plate - given to us by the chef handling meat. omg, amazing. tender to the point it just melted in your mouth. we seriously wanted to drink the sauce it was served in but kept it classy. 

Bo Ssam - we were going to order this as both of our entrees with their large scale dining menu, but glad we didn't as I believe this as a whole meal would be too rich for me. Very flavorful and sweet with a bit a spice and falling apart. glad we got to try it, but not my favorite thing I had. 

Black winter truffle ramen - My goodness I didn't think I could have a truffle overload, but this nearly did it. I felt I smelled of truffle for the rest of the night lol, but no complaints at all I loved my bowl of creamy ramen. Noodle were the exact texture I look for, they had a nice chewy bite that made me want to keep eating even though I was super full. 

***** STEAMED WHOLE BRANZINO - best piece of fish I have ever had. tied for best dish I had in Vegas and I do not like cooked fish. the brown butter dashi sauce that came along with the beautiful branzino was amazing. another sauce we wanted to lick from the plate. we were most impressed with this dish, I was so glad the bf ordered it.

Our server was adorable. Bubbly and attentive.

It's not busy at Momofuku's Peach Bar, so I self-marinated with a Uze tap lemonade. Considered the stuffed buns, but kept true to my intent to enjoy ramen.

Pork Ramen consisted of a seared pork belly & shoulder, add bok choy ($7), seaweed, looked like arugula, bean sprouts, and slow poached egg.

It was served super fast and was a not piping hot, but hot enough. The pork belly is about the size of a deck of cards and was delish. A sliver dollar sized piece of the poor shoulder lurked underneath. The noodles were decent as was the broth.

5253611,2017-01-24,7,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Let me preface this with; I am a David Chang, Momofuku, Mind of a Chef, Lucky Peach, Ssam Sauce fan girl since 09. 

Had I ever dined at a David Chang restaurant? No. 
Had I made a recipe from his book? Nope, too lazy. 
Had I followed his work and those closest to him through the years like he knew the location of the fountain of umami? Yes, absolutely. 

Yes I'm a fan, however, I was so enamored with stuffing my face that it didn't matter what restaurant group I was supporting. It was about the food. 

Party of 9, late seating, Saturday night. We ordered from every section on the menu including the large format dining. No one cares how many points I rate anything so I'll just throw some highlights around...

Shishito Peppers - pretty standard, still delicious. 
Spicy Cucumbers - not obscenely spicy, try them.
Soft Boiled Eggs - there was a slight miscommunication with our waiter that left us with five orders of these (4per order) I enjoyed trying them but it was like the Easter bunny was hopping around dropping eggs all over the table. 
Pork meatballs - well balanced, super savory, great black eyed peas. 

Romaine Salad - half of us were only given a spoon and chopsticks. Do NOT attempt to eat a romaine leaf with a spoon and chopsticks, you will look ridiculous. 
Beet Salad - hell yes. Citrus and beets all day. All. Day. 

Pork Belly Bun - exactly what I wanted them to be. Beautifully constructed and then devoured in moments. 
Shrimp Bun - crispy little shrimp patty, spicy mayo, pickled red onion and boom..  iceberg? Works for me. 
Shiitake bun - super thin shiitakes that were crispier than I anticipated with the fluffy bun and scallion. Loved. 
Chicken Karaage Bun - the iceberg is back. And I'm still okay with it. Nothing wrong with the chicken bun but the shrimp gets the rose. 

Oysters Momofuku - incredibly tender oysters with that slight hit of kimchi, all for it. 
Citrus cured fluke - citrus + fluke.. you can't mess that up. 

Black Winter Truffle Ramen - my only complaint is that I would rather eat this on a couch. Or a bean bag. Just Me, myself and my truffle ramen. 

Smothered Katsu Chicken - This is THE dish I needed to order and wow. It was perfect. Like why don't we eat smothered Katsu chicken for thanksgiving instead of turkey? Throw some Hawaiian rolls my way and ask me what I'm thankful for this year. 

Fried Chicken and Smoked Trout Roe - biggest let down of the night. I'm assuming the chicken was brined, in which case it was heavily brined. Edible but man, after a couple of bites it was election year salty. We never received the chive pancakes or the truffle creme fraiche so it was mostly pushed to the sidelines in favor of the other large format selections. 

Bo Ssam - Bo. Ssam. Put it on a tshirt, I will buy it. Meat, rice, sauce, kimchi. I forgot about the oysters, they were too far away and when there is a pork shoulder within tongs reach, you ignore your surroundings. I tried the wrap in Bibb lettuce and eat method but one head of Bibb lettuce doesn't go too far for a large group. It doesn't matter either way. Eat the pork, love the pork, #BoSsam. 

Best for last.. the Korean Braised Shortribs - Obviously at this point I'm full. I wasn't even going to eat a short rib but a sweet waitress served it to me and I couldn't refuse; Bless her.
Any description I may attempt to muster up does not do this dish justice. Go with friends, try this and if you don't enjoy it, re-evaluate your life. 

YUZU LEMONADE. Spend 8 dollars. Spend it. Savor it. Trust. 

Milk bar - Blueberry & Corn Cookies, Chocolate Malt Truffles. Will definitely pass on those next time and go straight for the classic cereal milk soft serve. Simple, not too sweet, excellent. 

Clearly I visited for the food but I have to mention the service and atmosphere. The dining room is beautiful and next time I hope our party is small enough to sit at the bar and watch the chefs at work. For being open such a short amount of time I thought the timing and execution of everything was wonderful. The foh staff were great, very friendly and attentive. There were a couple of hiccups throughout the night but one of the managers, Rica was quick to assist and keep us all happy. 
There are a handful of items that I missed this round, but trust me when I say that I will be back. (Looking at you Duck)

Momofuku, welcome to Vegas. We need more restaurants like you. David Chang, you sir are great.",4J_obQgsOILOoTiZwdHHQA,10,4,5,enqKQlP9p_s5fxZNf0mgcA
5261899,2017-05-29,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"Pros: ambiance, vibe, passable food.

I had the chance to try momofuku in Las Vegas after hearing a lot rumblings about it from the east coast. I only had two dishes: the karaage bun and pork ramen. My review will be based on these two dishes.

The karaage bun was pretty good! Juicy, crispy and flavorful. Nothing spectacularly outstanding, but it definitely does hold its own.

The pork ramen on the other hand was disappointingly not that good. I am well versed in ramen (tried some of the best joints in Japan and in the US) and I must say although the pork ramen at momofuku is unique, I thought there were a multitude of things that would have an expert ramen chef crying. 

The pork ramen is very smokey. This can be a plus for many people but for me I felt it overpowered the dish. The other aspect that I felt was lacking was in the noodles. In Japan, how the noodle is cooked is a big deal in how it pairs with the soup base. In this particular case, the noodle was over boiled-- thus causing a little too much chewiness. Also in terms of how it blended with the smokey soup, you would think the noodle and soup were on a bad date and didn't exactly click. 

What I didn't really care for was the poached egg. It could be somewhat of a personal taste, but the consistency of the egg made the ramen hard to eat once the egg broke apart. 

The ramen wasn't necessarily bad as it is something that I thought was unique and creative but in terms of its ranking and place in the ramen world, I would say it didn't have enough of a pull to draw me back to the restaurant again in the future.",DWp4tTLVfm08DP_FOURNYw,0,0,3,o08KdvZHsIBw7fgR3e20JQ

The menu was quite different than NYC, service was great in the beginning and then our server disappeared for 30 minutes. At least the food was very delicious, we tried quite a few items with the shrimp bun being the least favorite and everything else was excellent. The dessert was from next door which I guess the only dessert they have was the crack pie which we tried in NYC and found it not very good. Strange they would serve something not very popular in NYC to the Vegas location.

Anyway next time we come I hope to have 4 people in our party so we can try the large specialty items which they have a full page of items.

Passing other patrons in crowded seating areas, we were seated in the only window seating with a clear view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower!  Manny the waiter was patient with us and had many recommendations.  Since we had experienced Majordomo down in LA and I watched all eight episodes of Ugly Delicious, I felt competent enough to understand what we might like, and try.  I thought we might try the pork ssam sauce entree, but was persuaded to try the beef ribs, which I was conflicted over, as I could have it in Los Angeles, but I caved in and wanted the evening to be memorable, as we were with my daughter's Fiance, and celebrating her birthday.  Something not offered  was the Korean Elote, with the fusion of Mexican corn tastes, with Korean style heat and vegetables which made for a lovely taste all the way down.   When dining at a David Chang restaurant, always try the fish, which is cooked perfectly and tasty, with hints of spice you just can't place, but delicious with fish.  At this particular location, it was the whole Branzino with a grilled lemon in the head and de-boned.  A very delicious dish.  The overall evening was perfect, with a 9:00 reservation and seated almost immediately.

To be specific, the level of saltiness in each bowl was different. Mine wasn't the saltiest but my mom's bowl was so bad, she had already asked for four cups of water. Not to mention, we also asked for lemon wedges and room temp water to help lighten the soup... that didn't work either. Very disappointing meal because it was recommended by so many of my friends.

Top-notch! the server was friendly and gladly went over the menu for us with all the recommendations and most popular dishes. He also stopped by a couple of times to ask if we needed anything else. Thank you for that! They're so on top of it, it's like they knew I would be dehydrated from the night before and refilled my water over 6 times that meal.

- Pork Belly Bun $7 -- steamed bun filled with a thick and tender piece of pork belly on top of a thin layer of cucumbers with hoisin sauce. YUM! If you are to pick one thing on the menu, I would definitely start with one of their buns.
- Shoyu Pork Ramen $17 -- ramen with pork belly, pork shoulder, and a poached egg. It's good, but I'm honestly not as impressed as I should be. I wished they would make the Japanese marinated soft boiled egg instead. 
- Brussels Sprouts & Cauliflower $10 -- veggies cooked in fish sauce vinaigrette and chilles. I really enjoyed this dish, but be warned that fish sauce makes it saltier than you would expect!
- Crispy Sole Katsu $29 -- I think I ordered too much food at this point.. anyways in case you did not catch it from the name of the dish, it's fish katsu not pork! I really liked the batter on the outside of their sole katsu. It's not extra oily like KFC, but rather light LIKE tempura... but not tempura.

We ordered the pork belly buns and oysters Momofuku to share, and I also got the pork ramen.

Pork belly buns: This is arguably the best thing on the menu. I inhaled these buns... buttery melt in your mouth pork belly, along with sliced cucumber and hoison sauce in a soft warm bun. This is the only reason why I would return to Momofuku. 

Oysters Momofuku: Grilled oysters with kimchi, spinach, and bacon on top. Meh. I'd pass on this next time.

Pork ramen: The broth was pretty lackluster. It wasn't robust and definitely my least favorite thing that night. It was a mediocore bowl of ramen with bean sprouts, slices of fish cake, poached egg, slab of pork belly and some shredded pork. Wouldn't order this again. 

I think Momofuku's biggest appeal is the great location. They're in the trendy Cosmo and next to the Milk Bar. Would I eat here again? Probably not considering the plethora of awesome dining establishments in Vegas.",Dc6-FwGgbo7Y6IAaZbd_Yg,2,0,3,yKi_7oLnOpkpD-DNOnU9eA

My sister picked Momofuku for us to have dinner at when we were in Vegas a couple of weeks ago. I tend to get bossy or Alpha when it comes to picking a restaurant to try LOL Yelp Elite Problems ha ha. I have no idea why but my sister wanted to eat here, my first reaction was, ""y tho?"" lol it has under 1000 reviews. From all the restaurants in Vegas. Anywho, she said she wanted to try it because of the Milk Bar next door and something about it being popular in New York?. 


We came here on a Wednesday night and it was actually packed. The place definitely reminds me of a New York Japanese restaurant! The hostess said that the wait would be about 45 minutes. Luckily we found two seats at the bar which was ""first come, first served"". 

I love me some pork belly buns so I got two of them and my sister ordered the shiitake and shrimp buns along with a beer. Everything we had was good. It's not bad priced at all, considering it's inside a nice hotel in LV. The bao buns are about $7 each, anywhere else you go it's probably going to cost $4-5ish. The bartender was really nice. Especially for a Las Vegas bartender. He didn't rush us to eat or get out even though there was a lot of people waiting to sit down.

5378099,2018-02-17,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I was so stoked when I heard David Chang opened up a Momofuku in Las Vegas; no more flying out to New York. My family and I came here for lunch on a Saturday and I'd thought the wait time would be over an hour but it was less than 30 minutes but if we wanted to sit in the dining area, the wait would've been 2.5 hours for the next available table. 

The lunch menu was simple and didn't have too much clutter like most restaurants. We ordered the Brussels sprouts and pear & burrata salad to start. I enjoyed the taste of the grilled Brussel sprouts with its tangy sauce accompanied with cilantro. Flavor wise I'd give it a 8/10, since it wasn't anything too spectacular but I liked how it wasn't too salty for my taste. The pear and burrata salad was something I would've skipped. I didn't enjoy it at all but my family had an okay feeling towards it. 

Next up, we ordered their buns (pork belly, shrimp and cod). Pork belly was probably the better tasting one in my opinion, probably because of the fat but who cares. It was a big slab of pork belly and the fish and shrimp was kinda small compared to it. We also ordered a Spicy Noodle with their Sichuan sausage, cashew and basil. The taste was interesting to say the least but t had great flavor and taste. 


Lastly, 3 of us ordered the pork belly ramen and that was phenomenal. It's been years since I had it in New York and my god was it worth the wait. The broth was rich in flavor, not too salty and full of MSG. The soft boiled egg was heaven and I broke it right away to mix with the broth. I do have to say that the ramen is not what you'd expect from a Japanese ramen shop from say Little Tokyo in LA or Sawtelle since it's a different style of cooking but still worth trying nonetheless. If you're ever in Vegaz, definitely give this place a try if the wait isn't too long and head next door to Milk Bar for their cookies and their Crack Pie.",AnQ7qCdqFFxJJ7L3DBn25w,0,0,4,hszA5cQoF-ldbqtP53NxPg

Wanted to try their fried chicken & caviar but it was going to take 45min, not an ideal wait time if you're hungry, so we opted for oysters & mussels as the appetizers and the whole steamed branzino, with asparagus and crunchy potatoes as sides.

Oysters were superb, fresh! However, the sauce they gave with the oysters seemed too salty & almost unnecessary, so we asked for tobasco and you know that did the job! 
Mussels were amazing, my new fave! Never had mussels prepared with dry garlic, paprika, peppery seasonings but it was delicious! 
The whole steamed branzino was cooked to perfection! The meat melted in my mouth but the flavor of the fish was just alright. Seemed to be drowned in some sort of a butter, vinaigrette sauce & pesto stuffed in the middle of the fish. Interesting preparation, but I wish it had more of an asian kick to it. 
As far as the sides go it was a little more on the saltier side.

In the nature of this wildly unpredictable city, our dinner experience was much more of an adventure than we'd ever expected - on account of both the delicious food and fantastic service!
If you get the opportunity to sit at the chef's counter, I'd highly recommend it. We were lucky enough to have Josh as our bartender/server and you really cannot go wrong handing him the reins. From the drink offerings to food recommendations, everything was completely on point. 

The Food:
Hamachi v. Bigeye Tuna - The bigeye tuna was my favorite dish from the first Momofuku visit. Shaved foie gras?? Ugh, my heart. Well this time around, Josh also recommended the hamachi appetizer. We were feeling particularly indecisive so we decided to get both to compare. Admittedly, the hamachi was amazing and the two dishes were unique in their own right. No regrets from getting both.

Heirloom Tomatoes - A really fresh in-between dish as we waited for our main. I might not get it again, but it was fun to try such a different twist to some of the ingredients I grew up with.

A5 Hokkaido Wagyu - THIS. First, I need to clarify that this isn't the normal tableside wagyu dish we originally saw on the menu. We were making bets (in Vegas, surprise) on what the MP for the wagyu was and Josh mentioned to us that there was a wagyu special that had been on the menu a couple of days ago. Luckily they gave us the option to order it and we figured this could be worth the splurge. And it really was! The wagyu was prepared with uni shoyu - a melt-in-your-mouth amazing, perfect medium rare. Still dreaming about it months later.

We were able to try a couple of desserts from MilkBar, which is connected to the restaurant. Josh brought us several cookies to try and we shared the soft serve with rainbow sprinkles. It was a simple and sweet end to a fantastic dinner experience.

On our first visit, we ordered shrimp buns (so delicious!), pork belly ramen (richer than I'm used to but still good), shishito peppers (I didn't have any), and Crack Pie and Cereal Milk soft serve.

Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich - There's a debate that this is the best chicken sandwich in the U.S.....it was most def good but I would put it in the Top 25 dead or alive category

Pork Ramen - $17 for a fuckin bowl of ramen is absurd but this is lowkey worth it cause you get a fat slab of pork belly and carnitas...broth is rich and everything tastes so good...top 3 ramen in Las Vegas but that price hurts....

Chilled Spicy Noodles - It's restaurants like these that allow me to try dishes I typically wouldn't try because of high quality ingredients. This was served at room temperature with the Sichuan sausage of course served warm. The pesto and basil mellowed out the slight heat coming from all the ingredients and the cashews added texture and balanced out the flavor...def a dish I would order again.

The cocktails - my suggestion is to stop playing penny slots awaiting your free drink on the casino floor, and spend the $16 for the cocktails! They were delicious! When I don't know the ingredients on the menu, sometimes I think that means it must be exotic and delicious. But in this case, they were so different and tasty! We got a spiced apple milk punch 

The food: the pork belly bun was probably top 2 I've ever had. Okay make that the best I've ever had! Not only was the pork belly melt in your mouth, but the bun tasted so incredibly authentic and freshly made. The toasted noodles were also a slam dunk - slightly spicy, the sauce tasted simple but done right, and with the tiger prawns and clams it hit all the notes I was expecting. The oysters were delicious, fresh, and accompanied by a mignonette that I had no complaints on any of the food!

4 stars was for the lack of knowledge from the service side. Given this was our first time, and that the menu was created by the infamous David Chang, I wanted to know exactly what I'm eating as the price tag was a hefty one! Questions like ""are your noodles made in house, are the portion sizes that different, what's the reason for your noodle dishes variation of $15-$48"" seemed pretty simple to me but the response was that they didn't know.

Compared to other ramen places, Momofuku has a more classy atmosphere that illustrates an upscale mood. This classy environment also results in a pricier menu compared to your typical ramen place. 

For my meal, I tried the pork belly bun, pork ramen, and bday truffles from Milk Bar. The pork belly bun's bun was quite soft and their pork belly and toppings were very flavorful. The pork ramen consists of a shoyu broth, which I typical don't get at ramen places, but I definitely think that the broth, noodles, and toppings were on point!

5470370,2017-09-18,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,Very excited to get pork ramen here with my wife but was so disappointed. Not anything like the Momofuku in New York AT ALL. It was the worst ramen we've had and we eat ramen weekly in LA. The broth was like $6 Pho broth and left a horrible taste in our mouths. Both our stomachs hurt and we didn't eat more than four bites before we had to stop and leave. 2 drinks and 2 ramen in the trash cost us $78. Should have spent it gambling again. Won't be coming back and if you eat there stay away from the ramen.,xQ6meuhtTiNVCurX-UVMNQ,0,0,1,aUar6zGWyZ07xbb6w0Qstg

Pork belly is amazing and good amount of noodles. Wait can be a little long so sit at the bar if you don't wanna wait for a table!,3n7D0QUa9exnjKW8nSDzYA,0,0,4,FINncQvdesPYoky_vVYmdA
5485061,2017-09-06,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I really wanted to love Momofuku. I support David Chang and I love his innovation around food, I love that David Choe's artwork is up on the wall.   But, at the end of the day, the food needs to stand on its own.  And, I felt like it didn't deliver on the hype.  It was decent food, with great ambience and okay service. 

I've been to the location in NYC specifically for the ramen, felt it wasn't great, but wanted to try this location in hopes of experiencing the deliciousness that everyone raves about.  I ordered the pork belly ramen, the pork bao, and the pork chop with the truffle potatoes (pigs taste so good, amirite??).

Service, although incredibly friendly, was very slow.  It took about 40 minutes for the main entrees.  Water was filled regularly and appetizers did come out fairly quickly.

Lemme start with the pork bao, which was perfection.  Five stars.  Pork belly was tender and fatty, the sauce was just sweet enough, and the bun was soft, and all ingredients married well. It was a standard pork bao, but many don't do this classic well.  Momofuku nailed it.

They use the same pork belly in the ramen, which again was delicious.  There was a soft boiled egg as well, which was perfectly cooked.  But, ramen comes down to the broth and noodles for me and it basically tasted like instant ramen packet broth.  The noodles were standard, cooked al dente and pleasantly chewy.  Nothing to write home about.  It's like someone had just poured in some soy sauce in boilig water and said, Voila!  Pour and serve!  I wanted to be blown away and it was meh.

The pork chop was served with a side of peaches.  The peaches were the highlight. Nice and sweet, tender but not mushy. The pork was tender, but super fatty.  The side of truffle potatoes were basically tater tots with specialty cheese on top.  That cheese was bomb, paired with the crunch of the potato - it had great texture.  And, honestly who doesn't like tater tots?

Sichuan lamb ribs: These were excellent and probably one of the best values on the menu.  If you're a lamb lover, this and part of a side would probably make for a full meal.

Salt and pepper lobster and shrimp for two: Also good and also not a bad value, it's not cheap but you get a pretty fair amount of shrimp and lobster.  The lobster was in particular perfectly cooked, tender and juicy.  I'd say in most cases this plus a side plus an app would be enough food for 3 people.

Toasted noodles: Good but not amazing.  You do get a fair amount of large tasty shrimp.  May be a little on the spicy side for some people.

Asparagus: Great, and the egg was perfectly poached and delicious.  This is not an egg they got off the shelf at the grocery store.  The miso butter is quite strong but if you don't like it you can probably avoid it.

5500358,2017-04-20,0,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,"I have never been to the original NY location, or any other location for that matter. This was my first time trying the food David Chang always posts about on Facebook. My friend and I came here between lunch and dinner hours. They close the main restaurant during this time, but the bar is still open, and they still offer a limited menu. Lucky for us, the limited menu had everything we wanted to try anyways.

We ordered the pork belly buns, pork belly ramen, and the szechuan rice cakes. I'll go from least favorite to favorite.

The szechuan rice cakes were good, don't get me wrong, but it's just a dish I'd be ok with skipping over next time. The rice cakes are CRISPY, which makes me happy. The topping is spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. The distribution of the topping was kind of poorly done-- the Chinese sausage ended up on the bottom, so we couldn't get a lot of it til the very end, and I think the dish could have benefited from a more even distribution of the salty sausage.

Then it is the pork belly ramen. David Chang loves ramen, and loved talking about ramen in Mind of a Chef. So maybe my expectations were extremely high. Here's the plot twist: the pork belly ramen is not a tonkotsu ramen. The broth on the ramen is a lot thinner and lighter, and the flavors are a lot more shoyu and bonito based. There's a lot of subtleness going on here. It is not the fatty super pork-y broth you'd expect from its name. However, it is still really good! The pork belly itself is so tender and flavorful, and the pork shoulder they put in the ramen is crazy good. The shoulder is so tender it kind of just shreds and falls apart.

Lastly, the pork belly buns. I saw there were a variety of buns, but this was the one I had to try. I loved it. The pork belly was smoky and so freaking tender. The hoisin based sauce gave it the umami flavor. And yes, I used the ssam sauce, and loved every bite.

We also tried the yuzu lemonade. It is quite pricey for what it is, but it was delicious, so you should go ahead and try it if you're splurging anyways.

I guess the biggest downside is the fact that it's pricey. Moreso than I expected. But the food is good, and I think I'd come back just to get those buns!",qJgae_Bqpwx1qm8-bXA_cA,1,0,4,_UfTqL7naEbPh6DamkGm4w

They don't have ramen on the menu for dinner but it's on the ""secret menu"". Basically yes you can still order it. They had pork and chickpea ramen. The pork ramen was awesome and I heard the chickpea ramen tasted pretty good too.  The ramen noodles aren't the thin type which I prefer the thicker ones.  Broth wasn't too salty or heavy and it's definitely more of an artisan ramen vs. your package ramen. Overall great tastes, just expensive pricing.",nuEtJcnjhS1LLzinPch8xw,1,0,4,PYCUPdcEhJPq4IxU3hSAwg

It's all about the ""Large Format Dining"" on the flip side of the menu.  Forget about date night, this place is meant to be enjoyed by groups looking to chow dooooown.  By leaving the budget, calorie count, and general fucks at the door is when David Chang's establishment really shines.

I haven't been the ssam since my first taste of their ""Bo Ssam"".   From the salty, fatty top to the juicy center to the delicious saucy bottom that I like to call ""pig candy"", this slow roasted pork shoulder has it all going on!  If someone really wanted to pinch pennies, the small version at $138 comes with all the fixings including rice, oysters on the half shell (which I still don't really get how this works with everything else), kimchi and various sauces all thrown into bibb lettuce for some ugly delicious tacos that would easily feed 4 people.

The ""Rottiserie Duck"" is another Momofuckin amazing option as the bird is carved tableside and then piled on top of rice so all that wonderful juice/grease/fat/heaven seeps into it for amazing flavor.  They also deep fry the bones for a nice little snack on the side, but I find they're a little too heavy handed with the salt, so ask for it on the side or to go lighter on the sodium blast.  

Imagine fish and chips taken up a stratosphere with the ""Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp "".  This beast of a bowl arrives with 6 whole lobster tails and 16 gulf shrimp tempura battered, then fried, tossed with fried garlic, cabbage and chilies.  The tails were super juicy and so good that I even tried to eat the shell with a less than satisfactory result. 

And then I can finish the meal off with my favorite overpriced cake? Hell yesssss!  Christina Tosi's Milk Bar ""Birthday Cake"" at $14 a slice or $60 for the whole cake, truly ends everything on a high note.  I would seriously eat here once a week if I could.

Apparently they change their menus quite often, I saw a few things I wanted via Yelp photos (i.e. certain meat dishes, their soft boiled eggs dish, etc) but I was told again and again that they swapped that item out for something else.

I got their Spot Prawns (4 pcs) layered on top of a cube of Anson Mills panisse (chickpea fritters), delicately showered with furikake and uni shoyu ($32.00). The flavor was delicious though, I loved the slight crunch of the furikake with the savory dab of uni shoyu on the plate. I just wasn't a huge fan of the raw prawns' texture, it was soft and very slimy. Although eating with the panisse made it tolerable and I really enjoyed the soft and fluffiness of it (almost similar to potato's texture).

Boyfriend ordered the Chilled Spicy Noodles that had Sichuan sausage, Thai basil and candied cashew ($17.00) that I found really tasty when I was picking at his dish. He also really liked the dish because it was very similar to Vietnamese flavors and reminded him of comfort food at home.

After Momofuku's delayed opening during our last visit, we finally came back again once they're open. At first we were disappointed that we waited 45 mins for a table near the back/strip view and ending up getting a kitchen counter seat, but that turned out to be our favorite part. No wait for a bar seat at 6:45 pm on a Saturday. 

I love noodles, so we ordered drinks and the Chilled Spicy Noodles and Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes. We didn't order too much to save room for Milk Bar dessert next door. 

Both dishes are quite spicy and cannot be adjusted. My spice handling level is mediocre, and I was able to enjoy both without breathing fire. The Chilled Spicy noodles are cooked al dente, and have a spicy Thai basil type of pesto coating. The little sausages were my favorite part. The Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes were not as spicy, but still had a kick. The rice cakes are pan fried, which added a little crunch. 

The kitchen counter view was exciting, and I loved seeing the chefs plating the dishes. It gave me ideas of what to order next time (the Steamed Whole Branzino looked amazing! Getting it next time!) One of their chefs graciously gave us a sample of lamb with tzatziki. Thank you!

I'm a fan of David Chang's brain (his recent Netflix series really reeled me in). So why does this place keep underwhelming me?

I've been twice in about a year. My dining companions and I have tried an assortment of noodle dishes, buns, veggies and cocktails. I have to say the cocktails have been consistently pretty good (and Vesper is really my high bar for Vegas so I think that's saying a lot) but the dishes always taste like they were executed clumsily. It's like ""I can see how this Brussels sprouts dish would be spectacular if it were cooked by someone else. This spicy noodle dish almost tastes like it was meant to taste. This ramen broth would be good if it we're handled by someone with more experience.""

The concept, intent and structure are all there but almost consistently (based on my experience) dishes keep narrowly missing the mark. A few days ago I thought maybe my taste buds were just off. Took a trip next door to China Poblano (which has also suffered from uneven execution from time to time) and they absolutely knocked it out of the park. 

I'll probably keep trying once in a while on future visits hoping things get better (I know it's possible) but I'm not recommending this to friends at the moment.",JQ6Q6E6jPzfeu6XjAKHO_A,0,0,3,5FP94_fQMc_bvFL08iD6-Q

Day 1 of Vegas conference got off to a great start. Momofuku is classy with an urban edge and the food reflects that theme. 

Recommendations:

Pork Belly Buns $7 - 5 stars and absolutely delicious. The real difference maker here is the steamed bun. It's thin, light and tasty but strong enough to hold the goods. The pork belly was extremely tender and flavored perfectly. Another big treat was the pickled cucumber which gave it a crunchy texture that you don't normally get with this kind of bunwich.

Yellowtail $21 - fresh fish and the ponzu sauce was excellent! Some of the more subtle, pickled veggies were a nice touch. 

Chicken Karage Bun $7 - crispy chicken karage on the same delicious bun. I really liked this but go with the pork belly if you can only pick one.

Pork Ramen $18 - the noodle consistency is great and the flavor of the Tonkatsu broth is very good. 

Oysters Momofuku $28 - these oysters are grilled and have a real smoky flavor. The final touch of chopped bacon leaves a nice aftertaste (if you're a bacon fan). I prefer fresh oysters so this was good but not great.

The Momofuku (lit. lucky peach) Restaurant Group is an umbrella of restaurants founded by chef-owner David Chang. Fed up with working in fine dining, he wanted to serve his take on casual Asian cuisine to the masses. His four most successful concepts include his take on ramen (Noodle Bar), ssäm (Ssäm Bar), fried chicken sandwiches (Fuku) and desserts (Milk Bar, headed by former employee Christina Tosi and now its own business). While most of his restaurants are in the East Coast with a majority of them in NYC, this was his first Momofuku to be situated in the West Coast. 

CONCEPT: Unlike the specialized concepts in the East Coast this particular Momofuku doesn't have one central theme. The dinner service is arguably the most generic out of the entire Momofuku lineup with focus on family-style group dining. The Vegas decadence ever present in Strip restaurants is in the form of using high-quality meats and using caviar for their fried chicken and caviar service. To partake in signature Momofuku signature concepts one must go during lunch or late nite at Peach Bar (begins 11pm). Both have a few ramen flavors during that time, with the famous ssäm wraps only available during lunch.

VENUE: Located in the 2nd level of Boulevard Tower, you are first led to believe that the restaurant space consists of exactly what you see at the entrance. Turns out that this is all a facade - the space closest to the entrance is merely Peach Bar. The main dining room is at least twice as big as Peach Bar and is more akin to a more formal dining experience. Murals are painted by David Choe and feature his and Chang's dogs.

SERVICE: Good service overall.

We wanted to focus on the signature dishes so initially I was torn on the ssäm and ramen. With accolades on Momofuku's ramen the family ended up getting bowls of their shoyu pork ramen (pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg, $17). I added shiitake mushrooms for additional $2. It's a beautiful bowl at presentation especially with the poached egg at the center and the pork on the sides of the bowl but the ramen was a bit underwhelming, especially for $17. My siblings made a note that the broth was shoyu (soy sauce) while the best broth for ramen was tonkotsu, which has quite a bit more umami packed into the broth. This is when I realized that a *good* ramen bowl stems from the sum of its ingredients. A bowl may have good meat, al-dente noodles, fresh veggies and/or an umami-filled broth but if one of the components is subpar or underdeveloped (in this case bland broth), the ramen just falls apart. I'm willing to pay $17 for ramen but at that price the bowl must stand out, and for the bowl to stand out every component of that bowl must be top-notch.

The $7 buns are excellent in their execution. My sister and brother tried all 3 and thought all were delicious. I got to share half a pork bun with my mom. Best pork bun I had due to a very good slice of pork belly. 

I'm not going to give up on this restaurant because of my subpar ramen experience. I would definitely love to try their ssäms, especially their signature bo ssäm. As for the ramen, I might not order the same ramen from this visit but I'm open to trying a bowl with a more umami-rich broth. As for the rest of my family they'll just settle on the desserts made by adjacent Milk Bar as they seem to like its creations better.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,11,8,3,bCeHsrWOEAM60hNjbVbDkQ

Noodles: Chilled Spicy Noodles - Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashew (LOVED!!!!! My boyfriend and I like to share main courses, and both agreed that this was our favorite.)

Not mind blowing and not worth the hype.
I came in for Tuesday lunch and there was about 2 other tables in there since we came around opening time.
I ordered a yuzu lemonade, pork bao and the pork ramen.


My yuzu lemonade came and the waiter took off before I can ask for a straw.
It was IMPOSSIBLE to wave down a single staff when there was many of them and 3 tables.
My cup of lemonade had white rings all over the top like it wasn't washed or dried properly. DISGUSTING -1 star.
I tried making eye contact with the staff and gave up.
I ended having to WALK to the front where the servers were standing just to get a new cup.
No one said sorry or anything. WHATEVER. 

Pork Baos:
I've read some reviews on how people said it was ""tender"" but why on earth was mine so chewy and hard to eat? I had to put it down and wrapped it home for my dog to eat because it was sooooo CHEWY. I really wanted to like it. :(


Pork Ramen:
GOOD. For that price tag I expected a little more.

Everyone was genuinely kind and attentive. Throughout our dinner, they constantly refilled our water with either flat or sparkling water.

Menu change daily and open from 5:30pm-10:00pm

1) Pork ramen ($18) - The ramen was chewy, slightly firm, in a light flavorful broth. Good size to share among 2 people. You can request for Japanese chili powder if you like it spicy.

2) Pork belly buns 2pcs ($16) - Must have/try with their house 'ssam sauce'. It gives you the even balance of savory, sweet, spicy with crisp

3) Complimentary dishes from the chef -- Blueeye Tuna covered with shaved foie gras. 
This was the highlight of our dinner. The cure fish just melts in your mouth and compliments well the creamy foie gras.

4) Complimentary dishes from the chef -- Fried Chicken and Caviar. 
Also another highlight and must try. With every bite of the fried CRISPY chicken, it just kept me igoing for more. Perfectly pairs with the fluffy truffle cream and caviar. 

5) 5 spice rotisserie duck ($198) - just on point and it was how I imagine it would be. The flavors just evenly distributed into every single piece of the duck. It is served with confit legs over rice in a clay pot. To eat, you wrap the duck with bibb lettuce, kimchi, and 1 of 3 sauces (hoisin sauce, house 'ssam' sauce, and...) This is worth the try!

So, you've got to be a fan of David Chang and appreciate his take on the dishes. (Not to mention the quality of their products and the executions)
My verdict after the visit, I will be making that reservation at Major Domo very soon (been trying since they opened up in Chinatown, L.A). Who are we kidding? We go to Momofuku because we all are Chef Chang's groupies!!!
The food - uniquely Chef Chang creations. The familiar dishes done with chef Chang's vision.
Those baos were soft and fluffy. The proteins were cooked perfectly. I loved how the shrimp patty still had the plump texture of shrimp & not dry at all. The pork chashu was perfect - soft but still has the meaty bite. Baos were perfect two bite app to start with.
Now to the ramen, granted my all time favorite ramen is half the cost of Momofuku's, I enjoyed the soup and the fixins until the last drop.  Honestly, the shoyu based noodle soup did not blow my mind but you can taste the quality. Make sure to taste the soup as it is, grab the nori and slurp down the al dente noodles, swish around get some of the shredded pork with bean sprouts get the taste of the topping, then break the poached egg and mix it with everything. The runny eggs gave the soup richness and balanced the soy broth out.
The most interesting dish I've had there was the spicy cucumber appetizer and the cold spicy noodles. I mean it was little bit weird when I first bit into it. Pickled cucumber with toasted marcona almonds, sprinkled with togarashi. A simple dish that resembled the Japanese kyuri tsukemono, Chinese version of cold cucumber salad, & Korean oyi sobagi. Definitely something I never had.
Spicy cold noodle was great!! The sweet Thai basil pesto cold noodles with cashews & spicy peppers. The perfect blend of sweet & spicy - the cashew nuts were the sweet, nutty crunchy factor & the basil pesto was so refreshing and tasty!! The pork patty definitely belongs with the noodles and I enjoyed everything together.
Jidori chicken rubbed with curry tasted moist and flavorful. Kimchi on the plate, however wasn't so tasty.
Service was as expected, courteous & friendly. We showed up fashionably early (30 min before) but they accommodated us to be seated earlier.

Pork belly bao for $7 are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for and that was pretty tasty. If you're not super hungry - I'd recommend saving your appetite for the fantastic ramen. The pork ramen (let's be honest, this is really what I came to eat) was $17. You can add some more goodies for differing amounts of money. I'm not really sure why the bok choy was more than the shitake, but perhaps a sourcing issue in the desert?

I came back for the ramen and it was unquestionably THE best ramen I've ever had, and if you pay attention to my reviews, I've had quite a lot. But to be fair, it was THE most expensive ramen I've ever had!

Black Winter Truffle Ramen ($58) - Without the truffle, it's a simple Ramen with an egg yolk and green onions.  But the black truffle, at almost $1200 per pound of this stuff, is the star of the dish obviously.  When your bowl arrives, so does a server to cut fresh shavings to your taste. Of course for me, pile it on!

It was delicious, it was fun, but to be honest, I probably won't have it again. The most expensive ramen may be the best ramen, but in general these noodle bowls are all great - I hope to come back again to have those others.  Maybe David can even add Tsukemen, which I know he studied in Japan - I'd love to try that!",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,5,4,5,L2E1vvHemIDACIUonNKF4w

Went because we happened to be at the hotel and were gonna go to the buffet there (wicked spoon--took a look at food before paying and decided against it. Similiar items to Wynn buffet but didnt look as good).  So we changed plans and went here instead.

If youre looking for something more interesting rather than copious and wanna get away from the excess of LV, this place is perfect. Its good, its inventive, its sane and its refreshingly thoughtful in its decor (minimal compared to the rest of vegas).

I'm sad I don't have photographic evidence of the meal since my phone died the day after getting home from Vegas, but know that those photos were worthy of being printed and compiled into a coffee table book, and that's not because of the photographer! 

Started out with spicy cucumbers...very refreshing and crisp, with just the right amount of kick to them. The Bigeye Tuna with shaved foie gras on top (heaven!) and stone fruit was heaven. The tuna was already perfect, but then adding that soft, melt-in-your-mouth foie gras shavings was magical. The Dry Roasted Mussels was a surprise hit (as none of us are particular shell fish fans)...umm...no mussel meat was left in that dish...and we soaked up the juices of that bowl with whatever we could that was lying around. Everyone should add bacon and furikake to their mussels! The Ginger Scallion Noodles were no match for us ladies...they were gone before you could say Momofuckyeah. We could have gone for three more of those.  

But, the star was The Branzino...this fish was so meaty, but each section was delicate and flaky with the brown butter dashi flavor shining through in each bite...I would swim with that fish...and then subsequently bite its head off.

Dessert (crack pie) and drinks were on point, also, and again, service was flawless.

I've been to Majordomo twice and once I took off my rose-colored glasses the second time, I was severely disappointed by the experience. But I wouldn't be doing my due diligence if I didn't try his other restaurant.

To put it short, the food in general was extremely over-salted and relied so heavily on fish sauce. I don't believe the cooks know how to use fish sauce properly as some of the food was practically inedible. The service wasn't great either, and it was similar to what we had experienced at Majordomo...waiters were waiting around by the bar/kitchen and it took forever to get any service (The manager was nice however...something needs to be done with some of the servers. They were basically getting free money by doing nothing). The restaurant wasn't even busy. We even got charged $1 / person for tap water...which is something I've never encountered...even in peak drought periods in Los Angeles. All in all, more ugly than delicious.

+ BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND CAULIFOWER - This was one of those dishes that was poorly done...primarily cause the cook did not know how to use fish sauce properly. After each bite, I had to drink water to wash it down. We had to send this one back.

+ KALBI WAGYU TRI-TIP - The meat was tough and the dish wasn't particularly amazing

+ GRILLED ASPARAGUS - The best dish of the night. Primarily since i've never had asparagus as juicy as this.

+ PORK BELLY BUNS - To their credit, the pork belly was cooked well..melted in your mouth. Other than that...pretty unspectacular for that $7 price tag. I'd recommend finding a place in San Gabriel Valley for a lot cheaper.

+ CHILLED SPICY NOODLES - Good texture on the noodles and good level of flavor.

The pork bun is every bit as good as promised. The bun is warmed, soft, fluffy and not overwhelming in texture or flavor. The PORK BELLY melts in your freaking mouth. It's perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and just perfect in every way. I wasn't crazy about the sauce it came with. They give you a little bottle in case you want extra. It's kind of like hoisin sauce, but a little thinner and a little sweeter, but in my opinion, you definitely don't need extra. This was SO GOOD.

As for the ramen, it was definitely to 10 ramens I've ever had. The broth was rich and delicious, they give you tons of noodles, and it comes with TWO types of pork. One is a slice of the aforementioned perfection that is the pork belly. They also serve shredded pork shoulder. Honestly, it was a little rich for me, but so good. The bowl isn't that big, so you wouldn't think it was going to be so filling, but I honestly wanted to roll back to my hotel after this bowl of ramen.

My husband got extra mushrooms in his ramen and those were a tasty addition. You can add extra egg or other little things to your ramen, but just get the basics. 

Weirdly enough, I think my favorite part about this place was the cider I got, which is from England. It cut the richness of the food just enough, cut the saltiness with the sweetness, and it came with a chilled glass.

Shishito peppers - Very good. Not too spicy. The ones on the bottom of the bowl had a lot more lime flavor
Pork belly buns - I judge pork belly buns by the amount of fat on them. These were great! Nice and fatty. If you don't like fatty foods then definitely avoid these. 
Slow roasted pork shoulder ssäms - We were warned that the pork shoulder tends to be very ""saucy"" and is more sweet than savory. So we asked for it to be less saucy and it came out great. Their kimchi is great as well. Not too strong. Normally with lettuce wraps, you have to limit your meat per wrap, but at Momofuku, you have to overstuff your lettuce with meat!
Pork ramen - It came with two types of pork. One that's more of a chasu and one that's more like the shoulder in the ssäms. The slow poached egg was amazing especially if you are an egg lover!

Next, we tried the grilled asparagus with miso butter and lemon. It was really good!

Finally, our main course which was the Jidori Chicken. It serves two people because it was a whole chicken.

The pickled radish was refreshing, the spicy bean sprouts were good, the peaches...no comment, the kimchi was so weak. The pork belly bun was good (ordered two). The pork ramen was good; however, the broth was very near the border of saltiness. The half chicken was ok. In Atlanta...heirloom BBQ has amazing fried chicken and pickled veggies. The salad which came with the chicken was heavily dressed in salty ranch dressing. The Chinese broccoli was way too salty; we really could not eat it.

Good were the spicy sichuan rice cakes, and crispy potatoes.  Ok for me was the Almond Hozon Eggplant.  It doesn't get 5 stars because as good as it was, the price value ratio was still a little off for me.

I first heard of Momofuku because of their ramen, so I find it strange to see that they've recently removed all the ramen options from the menu.  They still make it if you ask for it, but I guess they are trying to push the price point of dining up?

Sad to say, I was disappointed by the taste and price. We ordered one Pork Bao Bun ($7) and two Pork Ramens ($18 each). Overall, the presentation was well-done. The Pork Bao Bun was delicious (only reason why I gave this place a 3-star, not 2). The bun was soft and warm. The oyster sauce and the gochujang sauce made it savory and sweet. The pork was soft and had a charred, smoky taste to it. However, the ramen was definitely not worth it. Personally, I prefer a thick tonkatsu soup when it comes to ramen. The Momofuku soup was too light and did not have a lot of depth/flavor. The soup was sweet, not savory. I wish there was a little kick/spice to it. I think that would've made it better but didn't want to pay extra $1 for chili oil. It was also weird that they put shredded chicken in the soup. I felt like it didn't really go well with the ramen and the pork. However, the portion was pretty big even though it was pricy. 

We were looking for a good hangover soup, but this place wasn't the right choice for us.  For the same price or with a little more, I feel like you can get something way better. I personally would opt out for a brunch buffet next time.",ZsQtyP_yiwifAsC0iT-_DQ,3,2,3,B_XuDubcUHiE_Oi7uZwy2A

Hamachi
Shishito Peppers
Ham tasting (OMG!) 
Grits
Asparagus (I know, right?  it was the best asparagus I've ever eaten.)
Potatoes (there were 4 sides, we ordered them all, they were all exceptional)

Other things to mention:

The whole Branzino - delicate and beautifully prepared (and they left the head off at our request, thanks!) 
Jidori chicken (nothing exciting, it's chicken .. put the Jidori in front of it, it's still chicken.  Order something else.)
Dry Aged Ribeye - this sucker was $85.00 it came sliced for easy sharing, and let me tell you, I couldn't have eaten more than a couple of slices.  It was DIVINE, but so so rich. 

I'd go back, and I've recommended this place to so many people already (so don't screw up!) 

On the ""could use improvement side"" - Beer selection was weak
and they really don't serve dessert, they send you ""Milk"" which is fine.  They could have gotten us dessert from there.  We ended up not doing dessert at all, so lost opportunity.

It was also my birthday, so I wanted fine dining on this particular day. Who wouldn't, right?

By the way, if you are a kitchen freak as I am, GET A KITCHEN VIEW. If you're just a tourist, get a strip view.

As soon as we sat down, I was in awe of all the action I was witnessing. It was so beautiful to watch everyone working together in sync! Everyone in there was hustling their butts off. And it was really cool to watch as we waited for our food. 

Anyway, about the food !!!

I was with my husband this night. We ordered 3 things. 
Unfortunately, there weren't much Vegetarian or Vegan options. So our waiter helped with some suggestions and even offered something that was off menu...

1. The Chickpea Ramen w/ Bok Choy & Fermented Shiitake Mushrooms (off menu.) I give this one a 2/5. The chickpeas were on the dry side. I wanted to love this, but overall it tasted bland and seemed to lack some flavor and spice. 

2. Shishito Peppers. I give these guys a 5/5! They were cooked or fried perfectly! The seasonings were on point and it was just irresistible!

3. Roasted Potatoes. 4/5. They were great! The potatoes were cooked well but the toppings on top were a bit overpowering and seemed to ""hide"" the main ingredient, the potato. If I plated this myself, I'd have put the cream as a base, then potatoes, then Parmesan (imo.)

First, this location is a fusion of all other Momofuku restaurants... They have a little bit of ramen, some noodles, entrees, and even deserts. Instead of one linear focus, the menu here is quite large with a ton of variety!

My wife and I both ordered the pork ramen. 18 dollars and an additional 1 dollar for a small side of chili paste. That price is insane! It was the most expensive bowl of ramen I have ever enjoyed.

Price aside, the ramen was authentic with a very nice broth base and good quality pork.

The question I left with was this... Was the ramen 19 dollars good? Certainly not.

This is not a sushi/sashimi place. And I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who likes to stick to safe choices- burgers, sandwiches, sushi etc.  I heard it was mainly known for its ramen, however they did not have the pork belly ramen on the dinner menu so we were all confused. But when we asked they said they do offer the pork belly ramen...So..a little confused as to why a popular dish wasn't on the menu? And they didn't have alot of choices of ramen either. Most of us ordered the pork belly ramen and ordered lots of appetizers:

-Pork belly ramen: The broth was a little salty, the pork belly was very soft and easy to chew. The noodles were okay, there was nothing ""wow"" about it. The buns tasted bland.
-Pork belly buns- Again the pork belly was tender and good, but eating it with the bun was just a fail. The pork belly was too big to eat with the bun, it would've been easier if the meat was cut in smaller pieces maybe?
- Shrimp buns: Shrimp buns were a little easier to eat but again it kept falling out as we tried taking a bite. The shrimp was good though with a nice sweet sauce.
-Spicy rice cakes: The rice cakes are actually fried and diced into squares. It doesn't taste like korean spicy rice cakes but it a sweet slight soy sauce type of flavor that was pretty good.
-Hamachi: THIS was probably my favorite small plate. It was soft and the cucumbers really complimented the fresh taste. I wish they gave abigger serving of the hamachi. It's $24 for a tiny plate!
-Shishito Peppers: When I got a waft of the peppers it gave off that feeling where you can feel the spiciness with your eyes. But when I took a bite, I didn't taste anything! It felt like I was eating steamed peppers, and I couldn't taste the lime or saltiness. My boss disagreed, but must be just my tastebudz.
-Crispy Potatoes: My second favorite item on the menu. So good. These were basically roasted potatoes but grated cheese and green onions. Nicely seasoned and crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. I wished I was eating this with breakfast, not ramen...

There's a couple more plates we ordered but I didn't try them.

Overrall the food was interesting. My gripe about this place is that the food is unique but these small plates would be great compliments to other foods that they don't offer or are too expensive. The crispy potatoes would be great with the rotisserie prime rib, if only that wasn't $72...

Service was prompt and efficient. The waiter was attentive and came around to always refill our waters which I really appreciated. Most convenient part was the lazy susan. However the prices here are just mad. $14 for a small pickle plate? Nah. Will I come back here? Probably not, but I'm glad I tried it.",fRzmU2Z9hoxBcRk3vCIKNg,1,1,3,6tsXctLqyxOMPhcwod3S9g

I have been to many restaurants in Las Vegas for brunch and dinner on and off the strip and was really excited to try this place out. Unfortunately the only thing on the menu I thought was good was the ""boa"", otherwise everything else was just ""ok"". If they plan on competing with all the other restaurants on the strip they have to improve your menu options and your portions.

She reluctantly took our picture without a smile and proceeded to still look irritated even after we asked to speak to the manager. Most places we have had brunch or dinner (Andiron, Hakkasan, Honey Salt, Stacked, Fix, Herringbone, Seersucker, Palm, Wolfgang puck, craftsteak, Yellowtail, Milos, Kumi, and Jaleo and more) always go out of their way to make your experience a good one.

+BRUSSEL SPROUTS & CAULIFLOWER: Comes with uni aioli and pomegranate seeds. They're a great contrast to how savory the brussel sprouts and cauliflower is. Great side item!
-PORK RAMEN: To be fair, they do say that it's more of an American-style ramen. The broth wasn't creamy or that flavorful. However, there is a lot of meat in it, with the combination of pork belly and shoulder. The belly wasn't as soft as I normally like. Overall, this was just okay.
-CHINESE BROCCOLI: This was alright, nothing too special and kind of basic. The portion of this is also really small, but understandable since it's listed as a side item. 

It is to note that we came for dinner, and the ramen was not on the menu. However, it is on the lunch menu and you can ask them for the ramen options. You can still order it for dinner which is nice. They also have specials, which some of our group enjoyed. The waitress was curious on our input since she said they're considering it for the menu.

The service here is amazing, all due to our wonderful waitress. She was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. She was also quite honest with the menu, saying that the group meal option could feed more people than it listed. Furthermore, it was our friend's birthday so she got us a birthday cookie with a candle and ice cream (apparently, they just give you a cookie). She also suggested we take a picture on the balcony of the restaurant if no one was there. People ended up getting seated there so we opted for a group picture, which she grabbed a taller waiter to get all of us in it.

The menu was a bit on the pricey end (there was caviar that was over $1k oh my) so I went with the shoyu ramen, the pork belly bao and the potatoes which I shared with someone. 

Ramen: 3.5/5 I am personally a miso ramen person myself and so I wish I had just ordered the vegetarian miso ramen and added the pork belly and egg add ons. Otherwise, the contents of the ramen itself were pretty good with the classic soft boiled egg, naruto, seaweed etc. 

Pork belly bao: 5/5 I LOVED this bao. I've ordered a lot of these before but this was perfect. Though it was a bit small, they nailed it perfectly. The pork belly was super crispy on the skin part but once you bit into it, it melted in the mouth like butter. Easily the best thing I ordered of the 3. 

Potatoes: 4/5  It was a good dish to share with a friend. Realized we loaded up on a lot of carbs with my noodles and the bao lol. But they were pretty much loaded fingerling potatoes with some sauce you could dip it in! 

I also tried some of my friend's slow roasted pork shoulder ssam (which is like doing a lettuce wrap with rice, kimchi and the meat together) and boi was it humongous. Yummy but started to get dense and she took it home for leftovers :)",fVl0VjX_o2HLFHs5Y42smg,0,0,4,RZDPvoD93ZjvMGNZGcl7kg

Overall, I'd say I had a good meal. As someone who spends a lot of time in Asia, many of the flavors were familiar to me. The fusion of American and Asian was fun on the whole. If you've never been, never plan on going or rarely go to Asia then this place is a treat. 

The bao (ordered the pork and the shrimp) were good. The pork bao is a classic dish, but is amped up with smoky pork and richer sauces. The shrimp bao is a really good fusion of Chinese and Thai as the shrimp in the middle is very similar to a Thai shrimp cake while the wrap is still large. 

The lamb ribs were a surprise - sweet, salty, spicy, tangy Korean style ribs paired with yogurt and dill from the Mediterranean. I never expected that these would go so well. 

The spicy cold noodles we had were like a cold pesto with meatballs. It's discombobulating in its flavor combinations but if you like cold noodles this should be fun for you. The pesto is made with Thai basil so that in itself will be a nice surprise. 

We kept this meal simple as we planned to head to Milkbar for dessert. 

If I had any one of those dishes alone (except the bao), I would say that the it would be overwhelmingly eat dishes with so many complicated flavors. However, if you are a group of 2 (or better yet, 4 or more) order to share. You will enjoy your meal much more that way.",60OhUP904CWpFUOWKdI1gg,1,0,4,UEN8F8RoeQbYNgjkU22vNg

From the moment we checked in to the end of our meal the service was exceptional. It's hard to find great service at restaurants so I am so happy that we actually were able to get this kind of service. 

The place is a good size with art decor on the wall. We sat near a window which gave us a nice view of the planet Hollywood. When we were sat we were greeted right away and our our server was nice enough to give us his opinion on our many questions. 

We went with his suggestion of the half portion of the Bo Ssam since it was on the large portion side of the menu. We also got oysters, dry roasted mussels, a spicy cucumber appetizer, pork belly buns, unagi buns, truffle potatoes, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower, and pork ramen(which isn't on the dinner menu but we asked for it). Everything was really great and I love how our plates and utensils were changed with pretty much every dish we ate. 

I highly recommend the pork belly buns! Also, we were celebrating our friends birthday so our server brought out a crack pie dessert for him, which was so good ! 

Overall, I would come here again to try other things on their menu. Their service is great and their food that I tried was really great!",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,1,5,ff1ss35zXmJsRnkQs5ZoWg
