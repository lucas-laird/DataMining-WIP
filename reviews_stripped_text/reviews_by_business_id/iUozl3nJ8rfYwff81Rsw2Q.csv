My favorite thing to order is the falafel and also the beef shwarma. Each costs around $10. Great value and the food tastes pretty good.

The service is quick and friendly. Nice place to eat downtown if you're in the area and craving some good quality Mediterranean food!",vhbyfj_g_YTjZGZh7tt5GA,0,0,5,RvcfPJOLy3tpfnTxEJeCog

If that sentence fits you as well, I suggest trying Sultan's Grill. This small downtown eatery is hidden away in an unassuming space shared with Danna's Caribbean Grill (another choice find!). But despite the lack of ambiance, the prices are reasonable; the portions are plentiful; and the food is pretty amazing.
 
I had a Greek salad with gyro meat, which was one of their $8.99 lunch specials (served with pita bread and a drink). This was much more than a traditional Greek salad, with additional toppings of beets, chickpeas, and the aforementioned meat. I had never added meat to a Greek salad before, but now that I've discovered what I was missing, I don't think I'll ever go back. And this was some of the best gyro meat I have ever had--tender and spicy--so I'm sure the gyros themselves are fantastic, too.
 
Happily, I have just found another of downtown Las Vegas' hidden gems. If you're in the middle of town and want a taste of Greece or the Middle East, trek on over to Sultan's Grill!.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,2,4,rTx_xUS5YpfAOTXAP6cNTw

1802318,2017-08-11,0,iUozl3nJ8rfYwff81Rsw2Q,"Meh. Ordered the peasant salad.   It was a Friday and I think they had too many garbanzo beans versus cucumber beets, etc.    I think they are closed on the weekends and might have been running out of the better ingredients.   Not impressed.    

I have had the Greek salad which is much better than the peasant salad.   I don't think I will be back.",Rdric7cZ3E_OnLTYd45yTA,1,0,2,xSyCQKvSi0YBDPY-KOMBvg
1949237,2016-07-29,0,iUozl3nJ8rfYwff81Rsw2Q,"Service is excellent. I was grumpy and quiet but was happily served anyway.

I ordered a falafel wrap. The falafel was cold and crushed apart for some reason. I should have asked more questions before ordering. The pita is chewy and bland. They include pickled beets which I was unaware of but were good. I would order them on the side, however. They include hummus in their falafel wrap for some reason. Taziki or tahini or something would make more sense.

There is no counter menu to order from.",CmyaRnyTvPAw6mguXUWh-Q,2,0,2,j0dHU_C9WLqasOmFLQ_w9Q

I called at 12 on a Monday and was put on hold for 10 minutes before the call disconnected. When I tried calling back the number wasn't working anymore, WEIRD. After trying the number 10 times, I figured they were busy for lunch, finally got an answer and put my order in. They quoted me 40 minutes for delivery which was fine because we have lunch at 1. I got a call 10 minutes after I placed my order saying it was ready. I appreciated the fast delivery but I think the food was rushed and it was not good at all. The red hummus was so watery, it was like soup. The meat in the gyro was dry and the chicken shawarma was extremely dry as well. The only thing that was tasty was the shrimp skewers. I understand it was lunch time but I would have been fine waiting 40 minutes and maybe have the food taste better than a quick 10 minute delivery.",NIHRj2Xs1V6KTY5qu3x0fA,1,0,1,lI_pFq_lMbUBYMj1kVEiug

I have been ordering from Sultan's Grill for around six months now and they have been consistently delicious, fast delivery, friendly and accurate! They have great hummus, solid middle eastern offerings and I find their combo platters to be an excellent deal for a quick lunch! I almost never review places, but they seemed really deserving of a positive rating! I just hope they stay consistent.

They greeted me and gave me a really welcomed feeling. They were genuinely interested in my needs and interested in how they could help. They offered me some extra sauce for the beef shawarma including extra spicy sauce for the rest of my friends to try. The sauces including the food itself was phenomenal. However the pita was a little dry and hard but everything else trumps that. Customer service is extremely important to me, because I wouldn't wanna eat at a place that doesn't care for their customers. I highly recommended this place to come eat. The price is fair for it being downtown. Just do it. Come here and eat y'all are welcome as I was welcomed to eat.",wqiDQaHqDPSNmQ0cAriCqw,0,0,5,g6a6z2mWpib8pfTjG6Fotw

Their beef shawarma plate with choice of rice or fries is $9.99 and comes with a drink, refillable if you are eating in.  I tend to order that or the salad version.  It can get a little busy if you go at the height of lunch time and I have found that calling ahead can be hit or miss.  They do a punch card but that is only applicable to wraps.  The food is good and the serving size is more than fair for the price, and it's always nice to have another downtown option that is fairly healthy.",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,4,2,4,f3Ge7oazC1oCb7FfLhL3Bw

This place gets really crowded at lunch time but I have to say being here on this day, even with a lunch crowd, the line sometimes being almost out the door, everyone behind the counter had great attitudes, they were able to work hard and find time to be friendly.  

Its amazing the quality of service here that everyone seemed very calm and worked through each order even though the line never seemed to end.  You can tell they really enjoy their job and they take a LOT of pride in the products they put out.

I met my daughter for lunch, the had a chicken lemon soup which was extremely tasty and left me wanting more when I was done.

I also had a Gyro which was really good.  They have an amazing menu with a great selection and even though this is my first review, I have been here a few times and really like not only the food here but the friendliness of the staff.  They are glad to see you and they put that love into the food the deliver.

If you are in the area, this is a place you have to try...ITS A MUST...

I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be back...I find it pretty easy to get to, there is a parking garage with valet parking right next to the place.  It is downtown so you know parking is limited and you most likely have to pay to park being the area but don't let that deter you, this place is worth coming to.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,6,5,5,Ivst8xr5uY6SUJrFwvBRIg

Hummus tasted liked chickpeas and tahini. That's it. It's like they forgot to put in the cumin, lemon and salt. Couldn't take more than 2 bites. It was disgusting. Ordered a peasant salad with gyro meat. First, they put the entire salad in a small 5 x 5 container, didn't add the dressing nor was it in my bag. That would be tolerable if it wasn't for the OLD, dried up gyro meat they added in top. It was all the ends that had been sitting there all day. Couldn't eat it. 

Basically don't waste your time or money here",p3Crqi3ul71Fkeytn547wA,1,0,1,nALPbs3fMKbWlCDZ9JopUw
