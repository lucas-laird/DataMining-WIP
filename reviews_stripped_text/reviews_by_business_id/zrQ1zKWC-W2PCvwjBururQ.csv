What I like most about this location is that you can get your Dole Whip infused with liquor! Dole Whip + Liquor? Yes, please! My drink was so delicious...I'll be a regular at this location for sure! I was served by the owner himself (who is a really nice guy, by the way) and he told me all about their expansion plans for this location. They will soon have all kinds of different flavors of daiquiris in addition to their amazing Dole Whip. Their prices are great too! They are located in the International Eatery. You can order inside, or better yet, just walk right up to the window on Fremont...so convenient! If you don't want to brave the crowds to get there, try parking in the lot on Carson and LV Blvd...when you come out on Fremont, you're right there! I know where I'll be all summer ;-)",hGN8YmWcVJmLu_xGu_3w9A,0,0,5,oDaN7S96XrCQXxgC6ig33w

We had been hearing about this Dole Pinneapple Whip stuff for years...and last night on a lark we finally decided to give it a try. Since this was the closest place,  we headed downtown.  Cue the Opera singer from Scrubs: Mistaaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkeeee! :)

I'm not going to even get into the crazy,  shoulder checking,  puke on my shoe kind of whirlwind it was to get to them...of course that is a given on the Fremont Street Experience. You just have to laugh it off. We couldn't stop laughing all night actually.  

We finally made it to them and waited at the outside window,  which was fully open and had a menu, a cash register, and a tip jar with tips in it. Pretty safe to assume they take orders there,  right?  Two guys kept blowing past us, as we tried to get their attention. Finally after waiting a good 5-7 mins for someone to at least make eye contact a guy said ""you have to go inside,  we don't do orders here. "" 

Ok...everything here suggests you do...but whatever, I'm on a mission for the fabled Dole Whip...another set of double doors won't stop me.  We go inside and find a fairly long line...which wouldn't be an issue if they had some sort of organization or divider.  As it was the line was probably 20 people deep and blocking the main entrance...so when we were lucky enough to get pretty close we were blocking the doors and continually stepped on and shoved aside by drunkards, jerks, and drunk jerks. 

Man. This is going to taste even better because we worked sooo hard to get here! The journey! Tis almost at its end! That ain't no regular cracker, thats a Ritz!!!

There are two ladies working the counter taking orders right before us.  Once we get to the counter after about 15 mins,  they completely shut down.  Like, don't make eye contact or take our order,  or motion in any way that they are ready for us or not yet ready for us.They just start chatting to each other. At this point we are literally right in front of them. Meanwhile there are tons of people behind us,  so we are starting to get uncomfortable.  After a minute or two I asked if they were ready for us,  no answer. Had to ask twice more before they even acknowledged that we were a foot in front of them and the answer was a very rude ""We are waiting for tortillas, so YOU are going to have to wait. "" They didn't wait for an answer,  just turned and went back to talking to each other. Then we piped up and said we didn't want tacos, we just wanted two cups of pinneapple whip. They then told us they weren't serving it. I replied that they had three signs saying that they did,  and that the machine was directly in front of us.  Then we got another very rude ""Well, we aren't  serving it TONIGHT.  Thats it. NEXT."" I asked them what times they do have it and they said they only ever serve it before 5pm. Wow, at least they are answering,  while looking past me motioning for the next person in line. 

So, ya, it was inconvenient to make the trek down there for no reason ..but what are you going to do.  It happens. Maybe they were out of mix? Maybe their machine was down?  It totally happens and is understandable... I worked in food service for a long time. I highly doubt that they, as a matter of policy, stop serving at 5pm when they are open for many more hours.  But I don't know what the issue was. ..I'll never know due to their terrible customer service. There is absolutely no excuse for their rude, nasty, dismissive attitudes and behavior.  Period. 

Awful experience.",tK3NRpwMB87McFG5ioQRyg,3,0,1,7ZMirHr5RhrgIckn41ruUw
5428293,2015-06-16,0,zrQ1zKWC-W2PCvwjBururQ,"Ever since returning from Disneyland, I had been on the hunt for some authentic Dolewhip to satisfy my sweet tooth. I saw a couple of friends talking about this place on Facebook, and was intrigued to try it.

I decided to try the Downtown location, since I happened to be closest to it at the time. I parked at Neonopolis, since I had been told it was located right next to Slotzilla.

At that point, though, I had no idea where to go. There was no sign, no directions, or anything. It was not until I saw a small sign on the ""International Eatery"" that I realized where it was. The building itself is not called Pineapple Park, but rather is limited to a small window where you stand and order. 

Other than the actual confusion of finding the place, the Dolewhip was very good and satisfied my craving. It was $6 for the cheapest option, but if I remember correctly that's how much Disneyland charged anyway. It was a good treat for a hot day, and I look forward to returning  - since I actually know where it is now.",yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,2,0,4,Cvxck475EgCzTgt6TITNqg
5506295,2015-06-24,1,zrQ1zKWC-W2PCvwjBururQ,THEY DON'T SERVE DOLE WHIP! I brought out of town friends here one evening- they wouldn't serve Dole Whip. Came back the next day- still no Dole Whip. Don't say you serve Dole Whip if you don't actually serve it!!!,1Qo3Pw-XRPaaNfpGPmmORA,1,0,1,XhJ-kH6xLcrmxV1jNQ-NNA
