1814200,2017-08-19,0,2PS9kBbuJcmBhcNp-D62uA,This is hands down one of my favorite Hawaiian BBQ places in Vegas. Thank you always Mom for wonderful food and a wonderful atmosphere! The food is always amazing we ordered the small number 36 and the kalbi is true authentic flavor! The side order of kimchi is definitely worth and macaroni salad is a wonderful side to the meats. The shrimp crunch roll is one of my favorites on the menu and it even comes with the plate! Small is a good size for one and it will fill you up. The sauce that comes with the salad appetizer is one of the best salad dressings I've ever had. They need to let me in on their secret. Mom gave us a sample of this poke spicy tuna with seaweed salad and crunchy topping and it's so much better than most poke places I've had.

They offer a variety of bento boxes and combo plates that are perfect for someone like me, who likes to try a little bit of this and that throughout their meal. They also have a small sushi menu and some salads, perfect for grubbing after the gym.

The chicken katsu and kalbi plates are a hit with both me and my guy- portions are generous, and I like subbing their mac salad for the rice since it's not as creamy as other spots and has a nice peppery flavor to it. The bento boxes are my favorite to grab and go, making a small feast for only about $10. 

Service is polite and food comes out fast.

The macaroni salad was a bit different than what I'm used to, but it was just as good. TBH I wanted to try the chicken Katsu and hoped they had a kalbi/katsu combo but they didn't have that option on the menu. However I read a few reviews saying the katsu wasn't too great so I guess it was meant to be. 

My boyfriend ordered the beef and gyoza bowl and holy cow was it huge. He usually doesn't eat much, but he finished the whole dang bowl! I guess it was that delicious.

Lol I didn't actually try their teriyaki but instead opted for the California roll because it was 4.50! how awesome is that? where else can you get a roll for 4.50 besides your local, very questionable, grocery store sushi section neighbored right next to frozen cauliflower florets and smart water? Which is why this place automatically gets 4/5 stars lol 

The reason they didn't get 5/5 is because I'm having trouble figuring out this restaurant's identity with its outer worldly alien space font, pictures of wine and grapes as decor, and the random jap chae they have on the menu lol. (Still down to try it.)

The interior is not big and is simple, but I feel like many people probably order takeout. The menu offers quite a few offerings, and the combos are nice if you want to try multiple things. They offer a large size which I opted for, but unless you are really hungry, the standard size is likely generous enough (I was unable to finish the large, and I can eat a lot of food).

The prices are reasonable, the food is good, and it's better than more popular places like L&L! I always get either the salmon bento or the tempura udon. The salmon bento comes with a generous portion of salmon, a california roll, shrimp + vegetable tempura, rice and salad. I love that the california roll tastes really fresh and the tempura sauce is flavorful and not too watered down. Also, I find that this is one of the few places in Vegas that make really good, flavorful udon. 

The reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is for their spotty service. I always ask to replace the salad with extra rice and to remove the cucumber from the cali roll because I'm allergic. About half the times they forget, so now I have to make sure to repeat myself multiple times and ask again when I pick up the food lol.  Also, one time I ordered the salmon bento over the phone and was told it would be ready in 10 min. When I got there 15 min later, the guy at the front said he accidentally gave away my order to another person, so I had to wait another ten minutes. On the plus side, he offered me a free drink and a ""members VIP discount"" card that's good for 10% off every time I go.

The inside of the restaurant is pretty plain and simple and I can understand how this place can get a little too busy at peak times as seating extends around the counter but is a little limited.
As far as food goes, this might not be an issue for most but PLEASE BE AWARE, the gyoza does not mention what, if any, meat is inside on any of the 3 gyoza dishes on the menu so I went to order the beef gyoza rice bowl and it wasn't until I double checked that the server told me it was chicken & veg - I don't eat chicken so I was lucky not to order something I couldn't eat as this info wasn't offered or clear.
I asked if I could sub the gyoza for a different appetiser but was refused. No customisation allowed and these cannot be made to order.
As a result, we went for the beef rice bowl, the kalbi/chicken special dish and some spam musubis. The portion sizes were good and the food itself was delicious!! The sauces and dressings are so tasty and the meat given is so good, generous and not full of fat. All the flavours were prominent and not hidden by grease or cooking oils too.

I was honestly impressed at how good this food was. I was craving kalbi and mac salad and had to try this place when I saw it on bitesquad. I was thinking, ""is it too good to be true?"" - like, where are you gonna find a kalbi & katsu rice place for $9?! With legit portions and extremely fresh. There's even a mix plate of like 3 or 4 proteins and sides for like $7.95! Ridiculously amazing! 

We also tried fried gyoza which were like any other gyoza, a crunchy shrimp tempura roll (also very good), and when asking for mac salad on the side for some orders - THEY HOOKED IT UP. Spam musubi rice to spam ratio was legit - not a ton of rice but just enough. 

Not a single person in my order for 8 complained. Every single person loved it. 

It's been about a week and I'm still not over it. Such a good meal, unbelievable pricing, and definitely plan to physically go in and check it out but if I'm this happy with the delivery quality - I know I will still love it when it's even fresher and in front of me. 

Highly recommend this place if you're ballin on a budget or if you're craving some Korean or Hawaiian food but are sick of L&L and too far away from Island Flavor or Aloha Kitchen.",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,3,1,5,qVbiboNUs3FNBJVaRB_cNA

Since switching to the vegetarian diet, I still enjoy the salad and the egg rolls from here. The salad dressing is so yummy!

I ended up ordering a chicken/steak combo (I think?), spam masubi, and udon with Cali roll and shrimp tempura. He said it would be about 10 minutes and it was ready right on time for pick up. The same guy who took my order rang my order out and was once again super nice and courteous. Only minor thing was he accidentally handed me the wrong check, but apologized when I pointed it out and was professional about his mistake. Before paying, I asked how much sodas were and he said $1, but that I could have one for their grand opening for free! Free soda? Hell yea! I noticed that they had Hawaiian sodas, too, so I asked how much those were and I don't remember what he said for the pricing, but he offered to give me one of those instead of regular soda for free! I asked him which one was most popular and he said that the pineapple/orange one was, but I'm not a huge fan of orange so he mentioned guava was the next most popular. I said yes to guava and told him about how there's another brand of those Hawaiian sodas and I always hear about how the lilikoi is the best and he offered to give me one of those as well to try! Overall, super duper service from a genuinely nice employee and the food was fresh, yummy, and beautifully packaged with utensils and napkins!

Seriously. Mom's Teriyaki is the BEST. 

After searching Yelp for a good noodle/bento/sushi-type place, we saw some good reviews, trekked over, and have been HOOKED ever since.

The food is delicious. In the several times we have gone, we have tried noodle dishes, rice dishes, sushi, salads, etc. Each has been fantastic. When you look at their menu and smell the food cooking, you will want to order a bunch of stuff, there's no way your tummy will hold it all. The portions are big!

A nice plus is the fruit juices they sell have no HFCS. They also sell regular soda (Coke products) so you're set if that's your thing.

If you're on a tight budget, try to make it here on Saturdays. They have great specials from 10 until 3 *and* they throw in your choice of extra freebies (some free cans of soda, pot stickers, and other choices) if your order is over $20. 

This place is super clean. If you've read our other reviews, you know that's crucial for us for a dining establishment and we have been described as picky. 

In addition to being clean and well ventilated, the dining area has very tasteful and pretty decor. 

The same employee has helped us each time we have been here and she has been really cool and welcoming. 

The parking at Mom's Teriyaki is good because it shares a large lot with other businesses.

Sooo, typing this review made us crave Mom's Teriyaki AGAIN. It's been an entire week since we've been and will be on our way back as soon as I close the laptop.
