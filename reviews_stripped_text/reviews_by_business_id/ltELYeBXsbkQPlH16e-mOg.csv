However, the last couple times I've been there, the food has not been decent at all. My husband got a carne asada burrito and pulled out a chunk of fat probably one inch by one inch by one inch. No exaggeration, there was zero meat on this chunk. Sick. After that, we decided to give Roberto/Maria one more try since we had had so many good times in the past. Once again, the meat was gristly and neither of us finished our meals. Instead, I'll be going across the street to 100% Natural for my takeout Mexican food from now on. It's a little more expensive, but at least I can actually eat it!",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,0,2,-MA0kvtZOma54CGgjnTONg

I ordered a california burrito and a cheese quesadilla.

Burrito was fine, but was missing guacamole.  I'm not sure if they forgot to put it in, but carne asada without guacamole is just plain wrong.

Quesadilla was okay.  I would have preferred for it be more buttery and for the tortilla to be more flakey though.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,1,1,3,sep_D0geshCyynPI6whxKw
