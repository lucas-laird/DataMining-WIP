65624,2014-06-07,0,fvDF6pqWKRaQIZPNYaX2TA,No way the food is worth the price. Ordered a bacon burger did not get the bacon. They took it back and the cook was noticeably upset then waited to finish cooking other meals before he started cooking the bacon. By the time I got the burger back it was so soggy that I had to eat it with a knife and fork. By the time I got half way through I realized that it had sat so long that the paper in the basket was mixing with it. All the appatizers were noticeably frozen as in it tasted like I just microwaved them myself. The waitress was great and I was not expecting much from a burger/bar joint but I will never go back.,r79QdFrVcIwO4mxNNCjfEg,2,0,2,BmhQ5A4ZXm8xcPXkLKcCAA
478539,2014-05-01,1,fvDF6pqWKRaQIZPNYaX2TA,"Newly opened restaurant, same as the Great Links on West Craig that's been around awhile.  This new Great Links is next to Nellis AFB, in the same location that was a Blueberry Hill for years and then a short-lived Korean BBQ.  The Great Links over on Craig serves great food and is well run--cannot say the same here.  Average food at best. Extremely slow service (still waiting for a burger and fries after 30 minutes).  I came in three weeks ago right after they opened--second time is today and it has not improved; don't expect they will stay open long without improvements in all areas.",DteNUcepn7y2i14fgO-raw,2,0,2,sYUYqwhXOOg3juSk794-JA

Tomatoes that smell of urine and have white mold on them.  Very disgusting restraunt, I do not forsee this place staying in buisness very long just like the last three food places that tried to establish here.",vf882mVxC5EyEoxYpnbRrQ,0,0,1,NLWJMmYeJZ9_Ap3KKSY-lg

Never had anything bad, free kids meal on the weekends with a paid adult, and the owners are extremely nice. Can't say anything bad about this place! If you're looking for a good place to eat that won't break the bank, this is the go to place.",l12Gygyqyc0jlwIuP3tPJg,1,0,5,kO3i4S1hMDT7p2yKr7FdgA

Best Philly cheese steak I've had forever. Gotta go here and give it a try. Family favorite and Sunday kids eat free. 
Hey if you like old bikes come meet the owner he does too. See you there",-p1LNSmiwPD2jw5Lf34uGw,1,0,5,FqMTJpowU3IEr-OfzA80eA

We almost didnt go in because we thought they only served hot dogs. But they are so much more than that! There was 4 of us and we went in all 3 days we were in town. So I got to sample quite a bit of their food. And I cant complain about any of it. Their burgers have won burger wars. And they have like 5 diferent styles of fries for all u picky fry eaters ;).And dont even get me started on the service. :)  everyone there was great. Quick and definately friendly. Prices are NOT bad at all! If your iffy about going to try this place, just do it!! Its worth it!! Definately bummed I cant eat it again until I make my way back to vegas.",nsboNjq6x3TLszjE5v6FGA,1,0,5,Gag3pno27-LclGNjRTKnew
