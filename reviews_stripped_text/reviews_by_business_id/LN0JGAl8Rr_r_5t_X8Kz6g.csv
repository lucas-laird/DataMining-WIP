We were staying at the Stratosphere and where too lazy to go out to eat at some other location. So we agreed to check out the Italian restaurant inside the hotel. The place was cute, lots of people in there so we figured that it had to be good. The service was good and I water was really nice. I asked him what he recommended and he suggested the Mediterranean Linguine and since I love seafood I went with it. We were a party of four so we also ordered an appetizer of stuffed mushroom and garlic cheese bread. The appetizer came and the mushroom was alright. Nothing out of this world, it was all covered in a tick layer of cheese, so of course it was going to taste good. That was about the only thing that tasted good in our entire meal. The garlic bread was terrible. It was literally old bread with melted cheese and no garlic flavor. My pasta was discusting! All the seafood was chewy and over cooked. So I tried to eat just the pasta alone and it tasted horrible too! Everyone in my party ordered something different and no one finished their meals. The two gusys ordered steak and I guess it was ok (they both said that the one at the buffet was better) but their sides of potatoes and pasta tasted horrible. The other girl that was with us ordered veal parmesane and she barely touched it.
Then we got the $120 dollar tab , with gratuity included I have to add. And it was painfly to pay. EVERYTHING TASTED TERRIBLE! First time this happens to me anythwhere. Anyway, never EVER coming back",dHAMkrLTVBoQcWJFCFrTHA,2,1,1,05JwPanJvmshaOGtDsgTTg

We received excellent, friendly service both nights. I also appreciated that there are many healthier options on the menu, which is a pleasant change from the usual Las Vegas buffet. I LOVED the pasta primavera and highly recommend it if you are a vegetarian or just looking for a fresh and light-tasting meal.",hIsf1pPijSvcgZhywoVsdw,1,0,4,lkcqCvnPMfuZEAUHZV3FUw

Well there were good things and bad things as there are in all new restaurant experiences but I have to say there was more good than bad.
Loved:
Ambaince
Lighting
Music
Mozzarella fritte 
Rib eye 
Ravioli
Chicken marsala

No love:
Waiters didn't really pay attention to us, I believe he thought we weren't going to tip properly but being partnered with a former Waiter we always tip 18-20%. He didnt bring us any bread and everytime we tried to ask about it because we saw it at other tables he simply ignored us. We actually got brought back the same shrimp that we sent back. Which takes me to the other thing I didn't love, the shrimp was overcooked and hard, so much so, I had to send it back for a redo.

Although there was good and bad, we really liked it here and will definitely return. Hopefully the Waiter will have more respect for us next time because regardless of the fact that I didn't like the service, we still tipped appropriately.",IKlr9Iur_sKI3zZccdgEQA,2,1,4,qLQVp2JnHyHVvP2_H-TtQA
289799,2015-06-01,0,LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g,"Wow!
Saw this place yesterday, but already had dinner plans. I saw they had Eggplant Parmesan on the menu, so I made plans for dinner the following night.
Service is fantastic. One seats you, another brings water, another brings bread. Let's start with the bread - your normal sourdough loaf BUT THE BUTTER - 2 little scoops sitting in olive oil and Italian spices. Dang that's good! I usually don't eat the bread (""why risk the carbs?"" - Get Smart) but I ate ALL THE BREAD.
Now onto the Shrimp Scampi Venezia. So good. I ordered more bread to soak up the garlic white wine sauce.
Eggplant Parmesan. I started with the sauce - always start with just the sauce. More on the salty side rather than the sweet side. Not overly salty, just pointing out the difference. Personally, I prefer Prego brand over Ragu brand (sweet vs salty). The eggplant is thiiiick - the way it should be. I want to know I'm eating a vegetable, not a deep fried vegetable skin. This is spot on. Comes with side of pasta or potato.
I will be back. Very enjoyable experience.",2H9K0-BSOLbKfkcB4YW6-A,2,0,5,f_62eDVeYgUpnU1t61G1ZA

My bf left me at the table while he went to an atm & later found out he had already been charged!!! All that embarrassment for nothing?!

435269,2012-10-30,0,LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g,"Went here while on a vacation in an attempt to try a mid-range Strip restaurant. Being located actually in the Stratosphere Casino, we figured it would be a tourist trap place, on par with casual places you would find at Macaroni Grill or Carrabba's, and we were right 
Admittedly, the service was great. I rate service, and my tip percentage, based on how well the waiter can keep my water glass full (I down glasses like I just spent 2 months in the desert), and I never once found mine empty. Unfortunately, this is where the greatness ended. The food was moderately priced (on par or only slightly more than you would find in an average sit-down place), but was only moderately flavored. Besides the side Caesar salad I had, everything we ordered was bland and deemed unfinishable about halfway through. Any sense of atmosphere or intimacy was ruined by the somewhat tacky paintings/furnishings and loud, stereotypical Las Vegas strip patrons.
Overall, not the worst place to find an alternative to Olive Garden if you are staying on the Strip. But if you are wanting to taste some authentic Italian fare, you are better off doing as the locals and finding something far away from the Strip.",HG_kmKUsNFhqvhnxAwidKA,0,0,3,vKyMm5AoZEFW6aTxRSFgeg

As if this weren't enough, the also charge a price per meal as if this were some sort of amazing authentic cuisine, rather than box pasta in a small lake of butter. The deserts were passable, but nothing to write home about.

As for the service, my partner and I were relatively impressed until we got our bill. When ordering our pasta, the waiter asked if we would like soup or salad. I responded, ""Oh, I didn't realize that was included. What are the salad options."" The waiter responded Caesar or garden greens and we went from there. The bill arrives after desert and it turns out we have been charged $17.00 for two salads. When I spoke to the waiter about this he told me that all of the menu items are a la carte. When I responded that he had failed to mention this when I had indicated it was my understanding the salads were included as a side with the pasta, he insisted this was my error and did nothing to rectify the situation. 

Overall we had a mediocre dining experience coupled with absolutely unforgivable customer service. We will never be eating at Fellini's again, and recommending that our friends and family avoid this place when visiting Las Vegas.",EwVfis5NltzYOxqOfOmq9Q,2,0,1,Esuf9hlvl5Fpjj78EXMalQ

This was our second trip to Fellini's in the last two months.  Our first experience was excellent.  From the food, to the manager, to the wait staff, we had zero complaints.
Well, we were anxious to give it a second go, and were definitely not disappointed.  Although we did miss chatting with Joe and Mark about great Brassy R&B groups, our waiter Velon was classy and professional, and once again, our food was traditional Mediterranean flare, prepared with a true homemade feel. 
Our meal started with freshly baked bread and butter which is smothered in seasoned dipping oil and vinegar.  These dipping oils are wickedly addicting, and if you are not careful, you can easily not leave room for your entree.
We enjoyed the Mozzarella Caprese salad which was a generous portion of fresh mozzarella, and tomatoes,slices garnished with basil, onions, olives and oil & vinegar.  Our next course was an exquisite shrimp Cesar Salad.  Again a generous portion of salad garnished with several grilled shrimp (not just two, but maybe six), and a delicious, fresh dressing.  One of the better Cesar dressings we've enjoyed (my wife is Italian so we have had our share of Cesar Dressings).
Our entree was the most originally prepared Filet Mignon marinated in Cabernet 
Sauvignon and topped with a Portobello and Roasted Red Peppers.   This is possibly the best piece of Red Meat I have ever had!  I also have to confess I ordered this last time I was here, and it was every bit as delicious and decadent this time as last!  I'm not sure how they do it, but the Streak is so well seasoned and infused with the Cabernet, as well as being so tender it literally melts in your mouth.  Once again, I must say that the portioned are very good size, and you definitely do not go away hungry.  The entree's also come with the pasta of the day, which is also quite yummy.  Their chef is a true pro with a great red sauce.
We finished the evening off with a light but luscious lemon cake drizzled with powdered sugar and chocolate.

We were seated as soon as we arrived. We came on a Tuesday night so I'm sure that's why they weren't that busy. We were taken to a cute room with a mural on the wall so it looked as if we were sitting in a courtyard looking out onto canal. The lights were very dim but every table had a candle so it was good enough to where I could read the menu without any issues. 

We started off with garlic cheese bread which was DELICIOUS. They gave us 8 slices which was more than enough. The bread was very soft and the flavor was just great especially to dip in the sauce of our entrees. 

I ordered the chicken Alfredo which is what I always get at Italian restaurants. It was supposed to come with bow tie pasta but I asked for fettuccine instead and they gladly accommodated me. In my opinion , this is the best chicken Alfredo I've had up to date. My mom ordered the spaghetti carbonara and I had to taste a little because it looked so good & it was also delicious! I haven't tried to many carbonaras but this was the best I've had. 

The waiter checked back frequently and was very nice & the prices of our entrees were the same as if we went to Olive Garden but they tasted a million times better.

We also ordered a 3 tiered wedding cake that was to feed 50 guests. It was beautifully decorated, super delicious and was large enough to feed at least 70 people.

The service was great - attentive, professional, and just charming. My water was never half full, and the complimentary bread was awesome. 

I ordered the eggplant parmesan, and my boyfriend got the Mediterranean seafood linguine. 

The portions are really huge, which some people like, but I'd choose quality over quantity any day. His dish was full of seafood and linguine, but the seafood was not well-cooked (some was good but other pieces were rubbery) and the flavor of the sauce was really bland. 

My eggplant parmesan had a good flavor, but it was a tad oily and the side really wasn't well-planned. Every entree includes a side of either pasta or potatoes. Potatoes as a side didn't fit the eggplant parmesan, so I chose the pasta. I assumed, since Fellini's is an Italian restaurant, that the pasta would be good, but I swear the pasta I make at home is better. They served the spiral pasta with the most bland marinara sauce, no cheese or anything. It was something out of a cafeteria. The eggplant tasted really great; it was breaded and cooked well, so it melted in my mouth, but the sauce was the same average marinara sauce. Of course, like most chain Italian places, they put an overwhelming amount of cheese over everything. 

Overall, I would not go back.",wSufVW03qQTQr1kSZ5pdFA,0,0,2,FWDTBwUZvkGb41kf6vRRMQ

The only reason this place got 3 stars from me is because my family like their dishes which lead me to believe i must have chosen the wrong dish. I had chicken Alfredo which is a very safe dish and alot of places make very good alfredo...boy was i wrong. The blacken chicken just tasted like charcol and the Parmesan sauce tasted like creamy nothing. I had to pile on a mountain of Parmesan cheese on top to get a small amount of flavor. Especially for the price I was not please.

1427467,2015-02-03,0,LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g,"Me and two friends went there last night. One of my friends had been there before. I went with his suggestion and got the Fettucine Capriciana. It was a fettucini with a lot of small shrimp (the tail shells already off), mushrooms, vodka, a creamy tomato sauce. Sooooooo good! It was $17.95.
My friend that had been there before also recommended the Chicken Alfredo. So my other buddy got that. It was a very good alfredo sauce (yes, I tried it!) and the best part was that unlike most alfredo sauces, it didn't get thick and clumpy as it cooled. It stayed very well. It was not priced bad at $16.95.
Now the not so good - My friend that had been there several times and loves the food.... He wanted to try something new. He got the Cappalini with shrimp and rapini (broccoli rab). Don't get this. He said it was bland, and had no extra sauce. Granted the menu says that it is made with olive oil. But it was not juicy. Had a very dry look. I tried it and I could not taste the garlic even. If that was first time for all three of us and we all had that, we would never come back. That must be their one bad meal. Just say no to it! Oh! and it is $19.95! So the cheaper the better at this place.

A couple quick tips:
Oh and get the cheesy bread! it is about $6.95 but VERY worth it!
Don't get a soup or salad to start your meal. It costs extra and it is not necessary. I'm 6'1 220 and I was full after eating some of the cheesy bread and the meal. 
I saw a guy get a pizza. It looked delicious! I didn't go over and try it, but it looked great.

There are no windows in the place, it is in the corner behind the poker room but nicely decorated. The male server was nothing special. Not bad, not good. The Spaghetti Bolognese is priced only at I think $16. Spaghetti and meatballs I think $14. Lasagna sounds good there and it was in the mid teens I believe.
I will definitely be back. Most likely getting the same Fettucine Capriciana again. It is great!",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,0,0,4,LCPUxfzRoZXoKsba48sNdQ

I was running an event to take them out to dinner and then to see the MJ Live performance afterwards (date night for our service members).

I should have let them know that we had a show to catch at 7pm and it was crucial that we have enough time for food, which is my fault for not saying anything - HOWEVER, when I finally did ask about the food and let them know the time situation at 6:30 they were extremely quick to accommodate and they did it with a smile!  The servers were quick, polite, and helpful.

Because I rushed my group, it was like having chow and they didn't have time for dessert.  Joe (nicest guy) was kind enough to have all the desserts boxed up, allowed me to leave them at the restaurant, and took my bag that had materials in it for our veterans and stored it in the wine area.  The staff really went above and beyond!

I come to Vegas once  month to do events for our veterans and I have worked with a lot of venues in this area.  The service is all over the place and on a wide range from ""I'll do the bare minimum so don't ask for much to impressive"" and I have to say this particular venue was the latter.  

I didn't have dinner until much, much later because I was tending to my group most of the time, but it was boxed up for me and I'll say the chicken marsala was good!

My boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30pm and were immediately seated in a beautiful room with a high painted ceiling of clouds and a wall that had a beautiful painting of something straight out of Venice! This place had a romantic vibe with dim lighting and plenty of tables for groups of two and more. After being seated, the water guy immediately filled our cups. After deciding on our orders we were given a basket of bread with a delicious butter and seasoned olive oil spread. Our first basket of bread tasted stale but the next basket was SO warm, fluffy, and tasty. 
Check groupon for deals! We had a groupon for two entrees and two soups or salads. They want you to reserve a table ahead of time, which you can do online or via phone. When you do, make sure to say that you have a groupon with the reservation.
Entrees came with either house potatoes or pasta of the day.
I had the Garden Salad with honey mustard dressing and the North Atlantic Salmon seasoned with a blend of spices, grilled then topped with a lemon caper cream sauce. I had their house potatoes with my order.
My boyfriend had the shrimp caesar salad with caesar dressing and the Osso Buco Milanese, a veal shank braised in a sauce of vegetables and tomatoes, served with risotto Milanese.
Ohmygoodness the food was SO good, I can't even begin to describe it. I don't know what they put in that honey mustard dressing, but it's the best I've had so far! I never had lemon caper cream sauce before and I found it absolutely delicious paired with my salmon. I am a big salmon lover, but 3/4 of the way through I got kinda sick of it....or maybe I was already halfway full from the bread and salad loll. The potatoes were super tasty as well! I think the waiter said it was cooked with wine! Even though I felt so stuffed and bloated, I couldn't help but steal some of my boyfriend's veal, which was the BOMB. At his first bite, he closed his eyes and made noises that showed just how good it was! The meat was so tender and just fell off the bone. They gave him a cutest little fork to eat out of the bone marrow.The taste and texture of the meat was reminded me of Chinese braised beef!  The risotto was kinda weird for me because it looked like really dry mac n' cheese but tasted okay. His dish was HUGE. He was only able to finish a little more than half of the plate. We ended up packing up our food and giving it to a homeless lady since we couldn't keep it in the hotel. 

This place is quite expensive but very worth every dollar; and our groupon definitely helped. I would recommend this place if anyone is in the area! Only negative thing I can say is that it's unfortunate the Stratosphere is all of the way at the other end of the main festivities of the strip so it took us an hour to walk from Caesar's Palace to here.

Also, they didn't bother to brown the top under the broiler- it really had the feel of something that came out of the freezer.

2222990,2012-01-27,1,LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g,"Fellini's could be as good as a 4-star, depending upon your expectations and circumstances.

Atmosphere for dinner was dark and intimate while also casual, which was nice. Things were quiet at this far end of the casino, past the 50s diner and box office, and the restaurant was no exception.

The garlic cheese bread, to me, looked and tasted like those free bread sticks you get with certain brands of frozen pizza. I'm not saying it was bad, just kind of ordinary comfort food with a ""I could have made this at home, and made it better, if I weren't so lazy to be buying frozen pizza tonight."" (Except we weren't buying frozen pizza, so...)

Diners who arrived after us were all reassured that their complimentary bread baskets were ""on the way."" Us? We didn't get one. Maybe because we ordered the garlic cheese bread? Still, it would've been good to have had a variety of bread, especially if the basket contains flatbreads, which I love. We didn't say anything because at that point we'd already moved on to the main course, but just know that apparently you're supposed to get a bread basket.

I had the raspberry salad and was charmed for a few bites, just because I don't usually have raspberries in salads, but soon I was disappointed in the one-note flavor of greens drenched in sweet raspberry dressing with a few raspberries about. This dish could use another element - maybe a nut or a bit of cheese.

Mike enjoyed his steak, and I have to admire any place that can cook something well-done without making it into a slab of dry cardboard.

I ordered the angel hair with garlic and olive oil. It was good, but the noodles swimming in a lake of sauce that was so deep they should've been equipped with water wings. Said lake was also so hot that I was on my third bite as my husband finished his steak. 

That was okay - I decided it would be easier to eat the leftovers at home when it was cooler and I could drain the noodles a bit. It's not the most pleasurable dining experience when flecks of hot oil keep flying around and scalding your skin or staining your shirt. But the flavor was nice, I'll give it that. (But when Mike took the to-go box to the car, he did note that bottom of the box was so searing hot that he couldn't touch it for long.)

I'd sum Fellini's up as 4-star selection at 3-star taste (for me) with some minor sub-3 aspects but 4/5-star service.

Their servers are fast and friendly, and the bread with olive oil/vinegar/ butter is also good taste. The price is fair ( I feel like a little too cheap when comparing to the quantity and quality).

The fried Calamari is so fresh and with a large portion ( all of their dishes are really large in quantity). The Linguine Mediterranean pasta has so many seafoods that you cannot even see the pasta itself, but it's not greasy at all!!! We are surprised that it's only $24.95. 

We have another pasta with shrimp, mushroom, and fettuccine ( can't remember the name of the dish). It is also a good combination with lots of shrimps.

I feel a little pity for the restaurant cause they would have more reviews if their location is closer to the strips and would have more customers for sure.

They gave us a private room for our party of 19 and despite being a party of 19, allowed us to order off the menu instead of doing a set menu. They said they would not have been able to accommodate if there was a second wedding party that night so we lucked out.

Like every restaurant, not every dish is a winner but there wasn't anything that stood out as bad and most people enjoyed their food.

Service was fantastic. Our waiter took care of our every need and made sure everyone was having a good time. We were made to feel welcome and appreciated.

The kitchen staff are also to be commended as the food managed to pretty much come out all at the same time. That's excellent kitchen management.

The waiters know the menu in every detail and they also know the details that aren't on the menu; the bussers are in and out before you even realize something needs doing; and the restaurant manager has his eagle-eye everywhere like the conductor of a great symphony, making certain that the diner never sees under the hood and just hears the purr of the engine. The portions are ample and done however you ask for them to be done.

even though the loud wallpaper didn't reenact italy for me,, the food and service compensated for..

2817340,2013-02-25,3,LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g,"Judging from the other reviews here, I must have come on an off-day. My wife and I picked this place because of the high reviews for an Italian restaurant in that part of town, and we went in with high expectations. 

The first disconcerting thing is that the perspective on the frescoes on the wall is just subtly off enough to give you vertigo the moment you walk into the dining area. Starting off the meal with a faint sense of ill-ease doesn't help the experience. They have beautiful white cloth tablecloths on the table - they cover that with a big sheet of paper, which totally detracts from the ambiance. 

Then came our waiter. I don't know if he had left his girlfriend in the walk-in freezer mid-stroke and was anxious to get back to her, but he was about halfway through our drink order before he was already running away. I almost had to shout across the dining area to get him to hear that both of us wanted a drink, and not just my wife. He disappeared for a long time, and resurfaced after I'd decided, forgotten, and re-decided what I wanted to eat.  We put in our order, he disappeared. He returned a reasonable amount of time later with our carpaccio.

The carpaccio was, quite simply, delicious. However, at any of the other highly-priced Italian restaurants in this city, for the same price, we'd get about double. I expected better; at this point, I was already regretting not going to Scarpetta or The Grotto. Once we finished that, they brought out the bread. Normally, in other restaurants, that comes before the appetizer, but, hey, however they want to do it. 

I ordered the Tortellini Abbruzzese. It had a nice flavor, but could have benefited from using prosciutto instead of sausage. A stylistic choice of the chef with which I don't agree, I'm sure, but it would have made it more enjoyable to me. That said, I still enjoyed it. 

My wife, however, ordered the Linguine Mediterranean. The seafood in it was probably fresh three days prior to us ordering it; by the time it arrived at our table, however, it had a distinctly Billingsgate odor and taste. It was not pleasant. At $22 for a pasta dish, I expect fresh seafood in it. Fortunately, when we got home and gave the three-fourths of it that we had left over to the dogs, they were ok with it. And, of course, my wife won't be happy until I point out that, unlike other quality Italian restaurants, they gave us that nasty Kraft Parmesan-substitute cheese, instead of some fresh-grated Romano or something else of note. Again, the disconnect between what they pretend to be and how they execute is staggering. It's like they're trying to be Olive Garden at Batali prices. It doesn't make sense. 

Finally, the waiter, whose conspicuous absence the whole evening was keenly felt, came back and tried to get all chummy with us to order desert. If he'd interacted with us in any way, I'd not have felt my skin crawl during the interaction; however, since he had reacted to us as if we had leprosy from the moment we sat, it came across as smarmy and car-salesman-y.  

I hated every second I was in the place, and cannot understand the glowing reviews this place gets. Since I can't imagine that all of the other reviewers are idiots, it really MUST have been just an off night last night. Too bad it was SO far off that they will never get a chance to prove that to me. I wouldn't even accept a free meal from them. 

If you are looking for a good night out of high-quality Italian food, hit up the places where Scott Conant and Mario Batali have restaurants. If you want a smaller name, hit the Grotto at Golden Nugget. If you want cheap and edible, go to Olive Garden or Strings. If you want to drop a ton of cash on stuff that my kids could knock together in our kitchen, go to Fellini's.",Io5GxWjhtxqiWnoA-6Fh-w,4,1,1,b2CqqdpdcJMWSxWEnffLxg

Memorable it was, in the worst way possible!  We arrived about ten minutes before our reservation.  After a few minutes standing and waiting to be acknowledged,  a man walked up and I told him we had reservations for our anniversary.  As I was speaking to him, a party of 6 walked up behind us. He immediately ignored us and took the other party to a table. They heard me mention our anniversary and they all wished us a happy anniversary.  The waiter never returned.
Five more minutes pass and a writer approached and I told him we had reservations.  He simply led us to a table without a word.
A waiter appeared about 3 minutes after we were seated. No how are you? Or, are you celebrating anything? 
Five minutes more pass and we are brought water, no bread. We order and received our food more than half an hour after we ordered.
The restaurant was not busy, but everyone around us seemed to receive quick service.
The food: my wife said her food was OK. I had shrimp Alfredo with six small shrimp grilled and tougher than shoe leather.
The waiter returned and asked if we would like dessert. We declined, had our food boxed up, and another waiter comes over and asks if we were certain we didn't want dessert.
At that point, I wanted to scream. My wife said just let's go.

Having used a voucher once before on another Italian restaurant in Vegas(Capos) and being quite disappointed, I was a little bit anxious about this one.  However, I needn't be.  We were staying at the Cosmopolitan so we took a taxi down to the Stratosphere...it was worth the trip.  
Cute restaurant with various different Italian scenes painted on the walls.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.   
Our voucher was for two salads/soups...two entrees...and one dessert.  
I had been wanting just some good ol' spaghetti and meatballs...and that is what I got.  It was very good.  I'm not sure that i could say the BEST I have ever had...but it was pretty darn good.  The boyfriend had a rib eye and was quite impressed!  The only bad thing was that the portions were large....and by the time we had eaten our salads...one garden salad..one Caesar..and the yummy bread...we didn't have much room left!  Fortunately...our hotel room had a microwave...so we brought home leftovers which the boyfriend had for breakfast the next morning!

We were spending one night at Stratosphere, and needed dinner before heading up to sleep before waking up at five am for our flight.  Ugh.  So, this was kind of our goodbye.  We were sat directly by the host stand, so which was at the end of a row of tables made to look like patio dining, except that the whole restaurant is inside.  This happens a lot in Vegas, so I was kind of used to it at this point, but it feels half weird, and half like you really are dining afuera.

Anyway, so we didn't get the whole picture for ambiance, since we technically never saw the inside, but the waiters really did seem Italian, which was kind of a neat touch, and the food was delicious.  We both had fabulous pasta, which was pretty authentically Italian but also had those American fixings we like so much (basically, cheese, and bring it.)

We take advantage of, Travelzoo, Groupon, LivingSocial and the local papers for good deals. We tried Fellini's because I read all the reviews and thought, ok it's a strip restaurant and it's got good reviews. Now the deal was $59.00 for dinner for two, this included a soup or salad, a main entree up to $34.95 and a shared desert. Not a bad deal. It also offered a 25% discount if you chose to add an appetizer. Now the restaurant recommends reservations so I made one. There was really no need as the place was empty when we got the at 6:00 pm on a Friday night on the strip. We though that a little unusual but some people like to eat later. We were greeted by our waiter who introduced himself and asked for our drink order. He was friendly well informed about the menu and made some great suggestions for wines, appetizer, and entree's. we took advantage of the discount and ordered the bruschetta, it took 30 minutes to get to the table. 30 minutes for toasted bread with some chopped tomatoes REALLY ! it was tasty but nothing to write home about. We ordered the Caesar Salad it was really good but a bit over dressed. I ordered the linguine and white clam sauce. It was over loaded with onions which I don't care for in this dish. Overall the rest of it was bland, bland, bland. My husband ordered the spaghetti carbonara. Now this dish is supposed to be in an egg sauce with either pancetta or bacon and parmigiana cheese. It came in an Alfredo sauce. We didn't finish our dinners box them up and took them home to our dogs. We chose the cannoli's for desert. I don't know what was wrong but it had a soapy or perfume after taste. My husband didn't taste it so maybe it was just me. To be fair the shells were crispy and you could tell the cream was freshly made, just what you want in a good cannoli. So that's it. The waiter was GREAT, the kitchen was slow with the appetizers but got better with the rest of the meal. The food was just ok nothing to rave about. At $59.00 for the dinner another $45.00 for the drinks, appetizer and an automatic 18% gratuity added. Which by the way is one of the reasons I think the restaurant isn't as good as it could be. I think everyone I did see had a coupon. The staff know there getting there 18% either way. We eat out often and the real test of a good restaurant is consistently putting out good food. The key word is consistent. So fo a $100.00 meal that was pretty poor we won't be going back. Sorry, we were hopeful that we found a new favorite but not today. I'll take Nora's restaurant on Flamingo any day of the week and twice on Sunday. The best Italian food in town !",xBOeEv1S16Ldtgj-EmFwtQ,0,0,2,CR2T3PKJ8C1H_Wz0TGw-hw

My dining partner had linguine carbonara, which was delicious. The garlic bread was oh so yummy! We also had the Fellini salad, which was sooo good. Fresh raspberries and a great vinaigrette. Get the dressing on the side if you are into light dressing as I am. The salad was big enough to split and they split it for you if you ask which was nice.

Pros that can apply to everyone who's not going here for a wedding:

1. Flexibility: The manager was very reasonable about different food options, offered not to charge for the under-10s who didn't want to eat fancy food, different bar/drink packages for the guest, and accommodating the Elvis we had come and perform during dinner. It's nice to talk to a normal person who isn't in the rule-stickler, customer-service-automaton mode.

2. The waitstaff was FANTASTIC!  I don't say this that easily, but our main host came in and introduced himself to the whole party before giving us a run-down of the evening (he didn't know we were there as a wedding party until we told him later in the night), made jokes and great conversation, and kept all the food and drinks flowing all night. It turns out he speaks 6 languages (impressive much), and was just a very enjoyable, easy-going guy.

3. The Stratosphere might not look like the fanciest joint, but this place is nice inside and the food was exceptional while still being affordable. We had uh-may-zing proscuitto appetizers, delicious salads, yada yada yada..... and even though it's on the casino floor, it's tucked inside it's own little quiet world, with cozy lights and comfy rooms :)

4341444,2009-06-25,11,LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g,"Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.
If you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . 

His movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. 

He is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.

This Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. 

The Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.

Service was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. 

Inside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,11,16,3,8yfMXzWxJwaNEAml20khBA

I had the chicken paisano, and it was absolutely delicious--a meal much more delicious than the $15 it cost. My date had filet mignon, which he said was probably the best steak he'd had all year. We also ordered garlic bread, which was soaked in butter and then smothered in cheese, but somehow still managed to be delicious...still, I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're trying to be health-conscious.

Cons- MISCOMMUNICATION! I called and spoke with Mimi and Joe about 7 times before our dinner. At no point in time were these items listed below were communicated to me. 

1. Kids menu-We discussed that kids were able to order pizza instead of the pre fixed menu. Upon arrival Mimi informed me that that only applies to children under 7 years of age. Nobody wants to argue on their wedding day but this was not acceptable due to the fact I spoke with her around 6 times and I was NEVER told this. She eventually agreed to this because I threatened to take my party to another restaurant. 

2. Adult pre fixed menu- The steak! We were not told that the steak cannot be cooked different ways. (ex. well done, medium rare, etc.) Some of my guest wanted the steak cooked differently and unfortunately that was not possible.  

3. Time limit- At no point and I MEAN AT NO POINT were there ever a conversation regarding a time limit! We were rushed at the end of our dinner to leave because all of a sudden there is a time limit. 

4. Cake- The cake was beautiful and delicious but I know for sure my party did not eat it all. The remainder of the cake was not  even offered to us. 

5. Bill- I work in accounting so I had the bill already calculated. When the bill came it was $500.00 over! Most of my guest had already left so I could not count how many people were there and what was ordered so we had to pay it but I sure we were overcharged. 

Pro- The food was good and filling. That's the only reason why there are 2 stars!

My advice- Communicate with Joe. He has an e-mail so everything can be in writing instead of arguing about what was said over the phone. Mimi is the event coordinator but does not have an e-mail which I don't like. Our argument over the kids menu was a he said she said because it was over the phone and not in writing. This restaurant has a lot of potential. They could really have more business if communicated with their guest properly.

Go all the way down, pass the poker room and you'll find it tucked away on the left. Also, TravelZoo coupon online, deal ends 9/30/2014.

So I may be slightly biased because we bought the travel zoo coupon and everybody knows that a good deal always seems to make food taste better. Well at least in my family haha Despite the voucher's fine print that limits one coupon per table, the restaurant was more than happy to let us use 2 coupons for our party of four. For $49 you get a soup/salad (specialty salads too, like shrimp caesar, caprese, etc.), an entree up to $32.95 in value (which is basically everything but 2 dishes on the menu), and a dessert to share (any of the desserts on the list.) They automatically added the gratuity which is a percentage of the actual bill price but it still is a pretty sweet deal. First they bring out fresh bread and butter that is sitting on a bed of minced roasted garlic with olive oil. Really yummy. We also ordered some chardonnay- a liter was only $20 so each of use had about 2 glasses which I thought was a good deal.  

I ordered the mozzarella caprese (large slices of fresh cheese!), my aunt's chicken caesar was pretty big, and two other had the tomato salad. For our entrees, my dad's linguine with clams was overflowing with shellfish, I had the gnocchi with filet mignon, my step moms lamb shanks comes with about 5 shanks, and my aunt's rib eye was huge. We all were pleasantly surprised. Lastly, we picked the tiramisu and godiva chocolate mousse cake. Yum and yum.

Service was a little slow at first but once we told them we had a show to catch shortly after dinner, they were much more attentive and told the chef so that we could get out of there on time. Overall I think we still saved quite a bit of money, so if you're unsure at least check it out with the coupon to see if ya dig it as much as we did.",uaBQ9Tvfe4vNj09ao5VHiw,9,3,4,1EdEytyvhtOa3ONmdcPT1w

We had studied the menu while we waited to be seated, so we knew exactly what we were ordering, had the menus closed and on the table side.  The waiter comes by, asks for our drink orders.  He leaves, a busboy drops off our drinks, then we see the waiter taking other people's orders that had been seated after us.

Alright so the waiter finally makes his way to us and asks if we'd like bread, my husband immediately says YES because we had just gotten into Vegas and were starving.  I told him we were ready to order (but wasn't it obvious?).  After the waiter left I questioned myself, was this bread complimentary just-bring-it-out-so-we-can-eat-it bread, or bread that requires some type of baking in which case there's no point in ordering bread since it wouldn't be any faster than our appetizers.  The bread came out with our salads.  It was disgusting, stale, thin focaccia bread smothered in melted mozzarella and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese that tasted just like the green bottle Kraft that only entered my house once when the in-laws filled my kitchen with less than standard food.

Started off with the caprese salad and a chicken caesar.  Both were very good, the clear highlights of our meals.  Next my husband had the sirloin and I had the veal chops.  Sirloin was bad.  My veal chops tasted incredibly plain.  My chops were plated alongside a cup of steak sauce.  If I'm paying $32 for one veal chop I'd expect a better presentation.  I also had a size of pasta.  Packaged dry farfalle noodles and canned marinara sauce.  I had one bite.  Next we took the waiter's recommendation and ordered the Snickers cake.  This was good but tasted packaged, clearly not made in house.

5128647,2014-03-31,2,LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g,"First of all-- I had the best Italian food and dining experience of my life here while I was in LV. I used a TravelZoo coupon to try this place out, and now I know to come over here for dinner as much as I can. Another reason to go over to Vegas. My mom and I took a cab here since it was pretty far from where we were staying, and it was the best decision ever. EVER.

Service: The waiter we had was a very kind and friendly gentleman. We tipped very generously-- it was completely justified.

Appetizers:

Bread: Came with butter in olive oil flavored with lemon and some other herbs. The bread was crunchy on the outside, soft and warm in the inside. Good bread is always a good sign in a restaurant, and they did this well.

Mozzarella caprese: BIG SOFT slices of mozzarella that melt in your mouth. with slices of tomato and big leaves of basil. To the other person complaining about the basil not having flavor... Girl. Please. It's basil. It's supposed to be fragrant and balance out the rest of the dish, including the sharp flavor of the balsamic vinegar and olives. The heck were you expecting? The salad alone made me full, but I kept trucking through. It was fresh and clean-tasting.

Minestrone soup: OH my gosh. I had lowered expectations about this item because I never had good minestrone before (only the kind they serve in college dorms... eugh). This was unreal in the world of soups. It was a clear broth with some pasta and soft vegetables-- seemingly simple, but AMAZINGLY flavorful! It was piping hot and just tasty. Yes, m'am. It was a big ol' bowl, too.

Entrees:

Swordfish steak: I chose this dish because I had an unfortunate experience with a steak meal at Mon Ami Gabi the previous night, and I needed a change. The fish was thick and lean and filling, and it went well with the garlic-tomato sauce and house potatoes and veggies. The potatoes were actually flavorful and not like, well, potatoes! I was very impressed, and the meal was not so overwhelming and heavy which is what I needed that night.

Shrimp alfredo: BIG serving of pasta in a rich cream sauce and several pieces of seasoned shrimp. It was pretty good! I'm just not a fan of alfredo pasta, but my mom didn't complain. They have an extensive list of pasta dishes that I want to try next time.

Dessert:

Tiramisu: The waiter came out with a big, attractive tray of different kinds of cake and sweets (red velvet, snickers cake, cheesecake, chocolate cake, cannolis, creme brulee, parfait, etc.) but we went with the tiramisu. I was skeptical because I haven't had good tiramisu so I always assumed I didn't like it, but I let my mom choose.

It. Was. Amazing.

The tiramisu grabbed me by my collar and tossed me into the fourth dimension.

It guided me through the genesis and the End.

I believe the waiter said the tiramisu was imported from Italy-- he must have meant heaven. Or another universe. Because no way could that have been from this plane of existence.

The square piece of tiramisu, dusted with powder sugar, was the silkiest, softest, most heavenly and angelic dessert experience I ever had. I think I heard harp and strings music flow through when I cut a piece of the tiramisu with a fork. Whatever. Laugh at me if you want. I don't care because it was THAT amazing. You will never have the tiramisu I had unless you come over to this place, or go to the bakery somewhere in Italy this restaurant supposedly got it from.

We had the dessert with a cup of delicious coffee, which I felt was brewed with tender love and care. The quality shone through the entire meal. Yes, m'am. Yes.

Again, I was staying and shopping around at the end of the Strip during my time in Vegas but the trip to Fellini's was well worth it. Please go here, no matter where you are staying. At least once, if not eleven times. Big portions, big flavor, great atmosphere and service.",Z280VWXP4EsFtxoKosemRA,2,1,5,VHs4VZGQ_PTo5nSn-CmSDg

They give you so much good food and you want to eat it all. No one at the table had complaints about the flavors they were experiencing. As someone who loves Italian food I know this wasn't a fake attempt at being an Italian restaurant as they truly are one. I enjoyed my chicken Masala. As it was juicy and cooked to perfection.

I met with a customer at the Stratosphere, thus decided to dine there. I confess I was a bit worried about food quality, since the Stratosphere is not in the ""fancy"" part of the Strip, where you find places with the signatures of the likes of Wolfgang Puk, Grimaldi's, Maggiano's, etc. (although all of these restaurants charge a lot for so-so authentic Italian food, it always felt like a tourist ripoff, and I have been trying to avoid any place that has some celebrity name attached to it).

I glanced at Fellini's menu at the entrance, and liked the selection, thus I decided to give it a shot. I was welcomed by a very friendly staff, and got seated immediately (although I did not like my table, it was not in the main dining area but it was a small table placed against the wall, and they had better empty tables... why put me in arguably the worst table in the restaurant?).

One ritual that I do at Italian restaurants is to order their inexpensive house wine, because if it is good it will show the attention and respect the restaurant has for it's customers (it is easy to order a good Cabernet for $100, but it requires knowledge from a sommelier to find a great Merlot for $10) . Thus I chose the half-liter house Merlot, and lo and behold, it was good. Kudos to the staff!

To start they brought complimentary warm Italian bread, and a dish with olive oil and vinegar, this is a very good (and traditional) combination to start sipping my Merlot.

As a main dish I ordered the Mediterranean Seafood pasta... and it was excellent. Fairly large dish with tons of scallops, shrimps, mussels, calamaris in a light red sauce. I was impressed (I just wish it had a bit more pasta, because it was AL-dente and perfect). (see picture)

To finish this memorable evening i ordered the cannoli dessert. It was ok, didn't feel fresh, I had better, but maybe it was just me. Try the Tiramisu instead.

So here you have it: excellent Italian food, much better than 90% of the celebrity Italian restaurants of fancy strip hotels, and less expensive too (and service was A+, alas good service is lacking at most fancy places in Vegas, waiters are too conceited!...).

I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the bad table and the so-so cannoli, but the past was a solid 5 star.

If you are craving for Mediterranean Italian food head to Fellini's, you will be pleased.

I was VERY disappointed and will not be going back.",shYedm_C7uR35T8-Z9fvag,0,0,2,VOHFdwyoFjFYJJczHt5x4A

We each had a salad, and the house dressing was tasty, but it was a bit of a heavy pour, so it slightly overpowered the salad.",3Cv8sgj-R4s1T07SXVUTkg,2,1,5,WZSJeZ68JNTCCWtRr1IYpg

First I'll start with some numbers:

Overall Experience: 1/10
Ambience: 8/10
Service: 1/10
Food: 6/10

We had a large party and seating was fast but after that, there wasn't much of anything. 

We ordered our drinks and it took 15 minutes just to get them out despite the face that there were some servers just hanging out outside the kitchen (in front of where we were seated)

Once drinks were out the severs were not attentive at all. I had to wait to grab the servers attention after 20 minutes just to get water. Once orders were taken it took 45 minutes to get food out. 

The reason I'm giving it a 1 star isn't just the fact that the food was cold and it took a really long time, but when food was being served, a server spilled my drink on the table and just put my plate over the spill. All he had to say was ""oops"" and then he walked away. I had to use my own napkin to absorb the water and had to wait 5 minutes for the next available server just to get clean silverware. The previous server didn't even bother refilling my drink until I asked him if I could please get more.",PYNyhkmsuMoEoOs91pYuBA,2,0,1,u8HGa6KDBgZfQeYhqUkiLA

The setting was very nice and the staff was great considering it was nearing closing time. I ordered the Veal Parmigiana, which was awesome. And the prices were very reasonable for Vegas.

""Our"" waiter was still working there, he still remembered our drink choices and when it came time to order, he simply asked ""the usual"", well it had been over a year since we had eaten there, but sure why not.

So to start, a simple Caesars salad was standard fair, no major surprises there.
I had the chicken Paisano, still as good as ever, instead of the house potatoes I get it with the risotto, just a personal preference, but it is good.

The wife had the carbonara, this is the stand out dish, many places will not make it in the traditional way, Fellini's does and it shows.

We had a Groupon and a friend had recommended them. When you go to a restaurant in a hotel on the strip in Las Vegas on Saturday night and there are maybe 20 people in a room that holds maybe 10 times that many, BEWARE! They definitely should NOT be a part of Groupon. First of all the absolute worst pasta fazioli that I have ever tried to eat! I so remember Minnie's at the Baron CafÃ©! Salad NOT chilled! Now comes he exciting part. Not everything on the menu is included in their Groupon so you have to ask about every item, What a hassle! I had veal parm and it was way below par! Ended a terrible mean with crÃ¨me boulet that the custard was gritty and lumpy and decaf coffee that was made days before! Finally I received a check that included a $21.00 gratuity!

Unfortunately the location and lack of nightlife has caused us to look towards other options when visiting vegas; about once every two months. However, we have enjoyed Fellini's so much from when we were staying at the hotel, we still come here for an italian dining experience. I especially enjoy getting it to go and eating it in the room but if you're not staying upstairs it may get cold. My advice: there's way too much food per entree to eat in one sitting anyway. Share it with the person you're with or make sure your hotel room has a fridge and something to warm it up with. Last time we came, our suite had a fridge and I brought a mini-toaster to warm up the leftovers from wherever we ate. It was definitely a great idea at 2 in the morning after partying. Fellini's leftovers were definitely the best. I had the filet mignon with gnochi and she had the jumbo shrimp pasta.

A couple of small dining rooms with townscape murals painted on walls provide the feel of a small family-run trattoria that one might find off a side street in Roma, and servers are friendly and approachable.

As for the food, my party of four began with good complimentary rustic bread with butter served on top of vinegar and oil.  A bowl of scratch-made Minestrone Soup and Caesar Salad were both very good.  Veal Marsala consisted of lean scallops of veal adorned by Marsala Sauce that was neither sweet nor bitter.  Tortellini Alfredo with Sausage was excellent, but the Marinara Sauce was weak in texture and taste.
