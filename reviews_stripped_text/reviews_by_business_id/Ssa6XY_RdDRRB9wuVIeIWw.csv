1050,2011-01-27,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Hedary's is legit Lebanese food.  Really yummy mango juice (more like a nectar and not overly sweet).  Solid hummus, good tabouli and Greek salads, and an incredible lentil soup.  Falafel are flavorful and not overly fried, although the sandwich was a bit on the dry side (needed more veggies/sauce to balance out the grittiness of the falafel balls).  Pita bread alone is worth the visit here- sweet, puffy, and served hot out of the oven.  I definitely want to come back for their lunch specials, and to try the shrimp scampi (ordered by the table next to us- smelled and looked amazing!).  Hummus, pita & that lentil soup are better here than anywhere else in the valley.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,4,UsS8p8xwZcMfcL8ba2hT1g

74294,2010-10-07,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Hedary's is where I learned to love food again. After being a model for years I was use to saying no to food or just taking a nibble or two. The first time I went to Hedary's it was the beautiful aroma that got me. I ordered the Greek salad, (safe I know). My friend ordered Lebni & Hummus with this delicious bread I watched as he took a few bites. It seemed so tempting to try it just a little bite so I could understand what the yummy sounds were all about that were coming from my friend.
OMG - it was amazing!
For a year straight I would persuaded my friend on Fridays or Saturdays to take me there. I wanted to try every thing on the menu. I even tried to find out where I could buy this kind of food at the store. Unable to find the exact same taste I began to learn how to cook some of the dishes they make. Some I could do but most I was not able to reproduce. Its always nice to have some one cook so you can sit and enjoy the social time.
I know that there were times they were closed and though I was disappointed it proved to me that this was authentic food that the owner who built this restaurant was still the cook. It's like the days when I was young and would come home and my mom would be sick and dad would say ""Mom is sick so Dad has to fix dinner. What would you like?""
I would feel disappointed and we would have cereal for dinner but my dinner prayer would be, ""Please God make mom better tomorrow so the house smells like dinner and I don't have to have cereal again.""
When I go to Hedary's today. I will call and that is why I have them in my speed dial. In this world of instant gratification it's kind of nice to be surprised good things are always worth waiting for.",9A0mOlDEt4ObyHpi1RVVeg,1,1,5,pTyU67RpF-HlkTID3VOMJw

157262,2009-12-25,1,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Using Yelp! for the first time, I opened up a Talk requesting suggestions for a good Lebanese - Falafel/Shawarma - restaurant. Out of 3 suggested, we opted to go for the Off-Strip (practically at the edge of town just off Sahara Avenue) since a suggestion was Yelp!ed while at the restaurant.

Hedary's is located in a strip-mall just off the main road. As we parked, we were a bit apprehensive on the quality, since it was pretty much way out of main town area and it's location.

Pleasantly surprised as we walked in. Typically 'bistro' sort of environment. Cosy, warm, intimate, not imposing nor overwhelming.

We, unfortunately, got the table immediately to the right of the door. In direct impact of the cold air each time the door was opened. (This is the reason of 4 stars instead of 5 - Owner needs to do something about the cold draught of air)

Amongst use we ordered:
Filafil (Falafel ) Sandwich - wrapped in Pitta/Lebanese Bread
Filafil (Falafel) Plate - assemble your own 'sandwich' - comes with appetizer - we ordered Baba Ghanoush.
Lamb Shawarma.

The Pitta or Lebanese Bread was just wonderful. That and and a table portion appetizer of Hummus or Baba Ghanoush can make a nice light lunch!

The Shawarma was great. 'Juicy' was the adjective being bandied about.

We followed that with a single portion of Baklava. Wonderful. The only other time I have had Baklava this good was back in UK - in a Turkish Restaurant. Warm, crunchy, sweet - perhaps a tad extra rose flavor, but not something I can complain about.

All in all a wonderful experience and definitely a place to visit again before we leave Vegas and one that can be recommended in a snap.

Only realized after the meal, while complimenting the waitress and the owner that Hedary's has received 'Best of Vegas' for 2 years. Not surprised at all.

I had the Frarej - the half baked chicken with potatoes, tomatoes, with a yummy coating of garlic, lemon and olive oil.  It was quite juicy and tender and I loved the flavor.  My boyfriend had the Gyro sandwich, he said it looked better than it tasted, he wasn't as impressed with it.

Our server was very pleasant and would check with us every once in a while.

Tired of the buffets and the Strip, I googled Best Lebanese Restaurant, and fellow Yelpers led me to Hedary's, several miles down Sahara Ave. from the Strip.  

Our waiter was Mike, who was really neat to talk to. He is a Michael Shannon lookalike and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We decided on a Schawarma sandwich with hummus/pita and their special half-chicken, Frarej.  The menu says this is their most popular item, but we didn't even see this notation. It just sounded good. And it was GREAT. The lemon-garlic sauce with potatoes and tomatoes was to die for. I was frantically trying to get all of it with my fork, as the pita was gone and I wanted the flavor to go on and on. One of the best dishes I've ever had anywhere, anytime. I tried to re-create it last night at home, and alas, it tasted nothing like theirs. We will return to Hedary's every time we are ever in Las Vegas.

We try hummus all over the world, and finally found hummus that compares to the very best. It was excellent - garlicky and pungent. Excellent flavor!  Oh - and the pita is freshly baked and comes puffed up, like three little balloons. 

For dessert we had to try the Shabiet. It is similar to Greek Galaktoboureko - layers of filo and custard. This one is topped with crushed pistachios. It was fantastic - not too sweet, and delicious.

Thanks, Mike, for the great conversation and the reclpe for the Frarej. You are a delight, and one of the many reasons we will return whenever we are in LV.",HiyKQQLn3qZWn-aMq7WdPQ,1,0,5,QW63lkvhTQ3FCG_6xjzTxg

402005,2015-07-18,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"I was on a weekend visit to Las Vegas and usually every time I visit Las Vegas I love going out to different restaurants. There is a middle eastern restaurant that I visit always but it was closed during the weekend I was there. So I thought I try this place. I was there on a Friday night. The place atmosphere is pretty decent. I was real hungry so I ordered a Hummus plate as an appetizer and a Kafta plate for my main meal. The hummus plate came with 3 freshly baked pita bread. The bread was excellent. It really came straight from the oven. The hummus was about $8 bucks. And it had a generous portion I would say. But I would expected it to taste a lot better. To me it seemed like it was a hummus straight from a ready to eat can, and they just added some olive oil and pickles to it. So it wasn't that tasteful to me and I have had Hummus for many years. The main dish, Kafta, was about $18 bucks. It seemed to be on the pricy side but like I said I was visiting and I was very hungry. It was three skewers of Kafta on a bed of rice and I ordered a side of tahini sauce. Again it was a lot of food but you are basically paying for it. The Kafta's came straight from the grill with the metal skewer in them. That was the first weird thing to me. It was super hot. I mistakenly burned my finger trying to take the metal skewer out. I didn't understand their logic on leaving the metal skewer in. It should have been removed once the meat is cooked and taken off the grill. The Kafta seemed a bit too dry and again lacks the flavor. It could be perfect if they just mixed it the right way and didn't have it on the grill for too long. The rice was ok. So bottom line is, the restaurant it self if pretty decent environment and the service was pretty good. But they should cut down the prices. And they should higher a new chef.",y5UAcIrQxm62Qn7KkdbNuQ,0,0,3,Irs-W9IOSyJOBc7PRrRdqw

504592,2011-12-29,1,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"I feel like a broken record with the 5 star reviews, but I guess I only feel moved to rate when I love a place.  I ate lunch here yesterday, and I believe that hands down, this is the best Mediterranean food I have ever had.  We ordered the humus for an appetizer, and it was quite good, although if you aren't into garlic, be warned it is heavy on the garlic.  One of my colleagues got the baba ganoosh as his side, and he shared with us.  I liked it more than the hummus, and I liked the radish and pickles served with both the humus and the baba ganoosh, nice touch and tasty.  The pita was totally awesome, fresh, hot, and puffed with air.  It was fun to deflate, tear, and eat with the dips.  Yummy.

I got the lentil soup as my side dish, and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Again, it tasted fresh and was nicely seasoned.  Nice portion, neither so little that you felt you needed more, nor so big it made you too full for your meal.

By this point, I was pleased with my meal, and the service BTW was great, very friendly and helpful without hovering.  But, when the main course came things really started to shine.  I got the kafta, and it was absolutely flawless.  Perfectly spiced, moist and flavorful.  It was two kebabs on a bed of rice pilaf which itself was also perhaps the best I have ever had - buttery yet light, and complimented the beef, onions, and tomato nicely.  I ate the meat with rice and either tomato or onion in each bite, and really enjoyed the chopped purple onion with the meat and rice a lot.  I cleaned my plate, and was satisfied but not stuffed.

Since I had a little room left, we ordered baklava for the three of us, and it was terrific.  Usually, I have been disappointed with baklava, finding it dry or over sweet.  This was flaky and moist with the nuts finely chopped, and just enough honey.  I loved it!

This place is small and homey, with nice background music and friendly service.  It is far from home, but I will be back as soon as I can.  Yum!",Ny_56tGIL1Yo83eS4_1lxg,1,1,5,hDLlvxHOgCjwvOXK5qDsXw

My husband, a friend, and I went to Hedary's. My husband had been taken there by this friend of ours before, and he raved about the food. 
We were all excited to go have a good meal together. The place has some good reviews, and I like middle eastern food from time to time, and have had a great deal of it over the years living in New York City. 

We got there, ordered a good mix of dishes and I asked for a Turkish Coffee, one of my favorites.
We were enjoying the meal, and the coffee came served in one of those Turkish coffee things. I was drinking my coffee, and I saw a coffee bean floating around in it, I thought nothing of it and grabbed a spoon to pluck it out. It was not a coffee bean. It was a roach. Cooked in with the coffee! EWWWWWW!
I showed it to my husband and our friend, who was a regular there, and they were both mortified. We asked waitress to come over and I said quietly ""excuse me, but I think we have a problem here"" she glanced at the roach on my spoon and said ""oh sorry, we can get you another coffee on the house if you like"". Another Coffee on the house? If I like? Are you kidding me? I would expect them to apologize profusely, have the manager come over and offer a comped meal. Nope. Nothing.  As though it happens all the time.
As I sat in shock and disbelief, and watched my friends eat their food, with extra care and attention, I looked over at the wall, and what did I see but more bugs dead on the wall!. I just wanted to run outta there.
Its sad because this place is supposed to have great food, but if the staff acts like this thing happens all the time, and is all casual about something like this, who knows???!!!


The messed up thing is we told our friend the exterminator that he should give this place a call to give them a good spraying, and Hedary's turned him down! Like they didn't have a problem.

1361009,2011-05-12,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"This place is proof that some of the best food in Vegas is off the strip.

I came here with 3 of my friends on a Saturday night at around 21:00 and the place was almost empty.  I was a little surprised but it worked out for us as we were hoping for a quiet dinner.  

We started with feta cheese with olives and the falafil appetizer.  The 1st was really good.  Good quality feta cheese and good quality olives.  A solid 4.  I think I could have just eaten the cheese and olives with the bread they bring.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the pita bread.  It comes out pipping hot like it was just baked-which it might have been.  Some of the better pita bread I've ever had.  Never had it this hot before.  Was absolutely a perfect compliment to the cheese.  The falafil was a little disappointing.  I felt the falafils were too dense.  I love falafils but feel a successful falafil is light with a lot of taste.  A 2 that I wouldn't order and am glad I didn't get the plate.

Our three entrees were the Greek salad, the chicken kabob, the stuffed grape leaves and the tilapia.  The salad wasn't bad-pretty typical scoring a 3.  The tilapia was cooked perfectly but could have used more seasoning though with enough lemon squeezed on top came out pretty well, a 3.5.  The chicken kabob was excellent.  I think the best dish we ordered, a solid 4.  And my dish was the grape leaves which I adore.  They came with a lot of meat inside.  I wasn't expecting so much meat (ground beef I'm sure) and in fact this is was the most meat I've ever had served in my grape leaves.  They weren't bad but I think the vegetarian version of this dish would have tasted better.  A 3.5.  

And I got the tamarind drink which was great.  Ordered a 2nd one.  The whole tab was about $120.  So I'll lean on the 4 star as the food was good enough that made me want to go back and try other things and foods.",np_PA4ejejVhk4klYvnMDA,0,0,4,Wk5Pmn55UM68EIGLOiEIcA

We grazed for nearly 4 hours!! Michael our waiter was so attentive and passionate about our food going into great detail about each dish. The house  Red Sangria ( they also have white) was excellent. We started with 'Fatosh' a mediterranian type salad . Adding to the table was an excellant dip baba ganoosh with this crazy tasty pita bread that looked like it had been put on steroids. Frarej ..oh yes!! This was an Amazing roasted chicken . I mean over the top. Yum.. the shish kebab combo a skewer of satisfaction.  Yep had that as well! It was shrimp & lamb (not both on the same skewer)
Served on a bed of seasoned rice similar to a pilaf. Again it was excellent.  HALF TIME . Great chance to take an eating break and we moved towards the liqueors. Michael introduced us to a Lebanese grape liqueor that is slow fermented through a 5 step process and a hint of aniseed is added. Somewhat similar to sweet ouzo . I liked that alot, probably to much :) Arak fakar. Ask for that for sure!  Honestly. I don't eat or drink this much but with the world cup soccer match so exciting and the chef was from Costa Rica how on earth could we leave when the match went into extra time. Better try the Lebanese coffee.. Really powerful but subtle.
The soccer match was now going to a penalty kick shoot off. Perfect time for desert!  We tried two of them ( just in case) we started with shabiet, a light cream custard baked in a filo pastry and paieed it with the white sangria Wasn't a huge fan of the shabiet,however our contingency plan worked well as the baklava. Layers of filo pastry pistachio nuts and a sweet butter. Oh yes!. I couldn't resist another coffee . The check. All this for hours and hours of an amazing afternoon just $100.00.
Again in the Lebanese tradition the hospitality was so welcoming.  
We will return!

Server came to the table immediately to  take drink orders and returned several times to see if we wanted to order food. We were catching up with friends so we took our time ordering.

The apps came out in a couple of different waves for family style sharing. All was very good except for the weird pickled eggplant. Nothing on the menu indicated that it would be pickled.

After the apps were delivered we no one came back to the table. We finally flagged a waitress to order a bit more food. That was a big mistake. After taking the dinner order she didn't return to our table! We tried flagging her down, waving, lifting our empty water glasses. All ignored. 

After 45 minutes I finally went after her. Stopped her in the middle of the room demanding to know why we had been ignored for so long. She said that she had to help out in the kitchen. She seemed surprised that we were complaining and acted as if her explanation should say it all.

After waiting for close to an hour the entrees came out. Chicken (their speciality) was overcooked and dry. I didn't taste the other.

Opted to combine the best aspects of the Shwarma and Roasted Chicken sandwiches on the menu by getting a chicken shwarma with garlic sauce. Side defaults to potatoes, subbed the tabouli (which was an unreasonable charge). Total came to $17- not thrilled about that.

Sandwich was just okay. Pita was tasty enough, but the meat wasn't particularly flavorful- the seasoning mix was lacking, garlic sauce was bland, I was underwhelmed. The tabouli side is a standard cup for $3.25- same portion is a dollar less to sub during lunch, for no apparent reason, and the dish itself is fragrant but again- BLAND.

Service was polite but slow. Interior is nicely decorated and they appear to have hookah available for the patio seating. Location somewhat difficult to see from the street as it is behind another building.

1939591,2013-05-09,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Went for an event (Stephanie S's birthday! yay!). This place is so tucked away in an obscure plaza that if you're going west on Sahara you're damn sure to miss the place  and have to make a u-turn.

Outdoor dining is a possibility which should be nice as the summer days approach and slowly starts to get nice in the evenings to be dining outside. Interior is decently decorated. I didn't get a chance to look around that much or even take a look at any of the other seating arrangements available.

Labni
 - Who would have thought a big bowl of yogurt with slices of cucumbers around the side, a pool of olive oil with i think dried mint leaves would make such a great appetizer especially paired with the puffed up ""flat"" bread. Got me thinking that if we as a culture scrapped the whole bread and butter deal at nice dine in restaurants and replaced it with flat bread and yogurt for dipping we'd go a long way in improving overall health. Cutting the butter and breads to replace them with less filling flat breads and much healthier for you yogurt over butter.

Halloum Cheese
- Dude! it's a block of cheese that's been fried on the outside...wait wait lets make it even better, Cheese? check! Fried? Check...now what? LETS SET IT ON FIRE!!! you read that right and due to Hedary's limited beer and wine menu, no i have not been drinking. The cheese is served to you while it's friggin on fire!

Okay enough with the fire i guess everyone wants to know how it tastes. Straight to the table and the flames die down the cheese is absolutely amazing. Definitely grab some bread, hack off a hunk of cooling cheese and one of the grilled mint leaves and you'll have one of the most amazing melds of flavors you wouldnt believe would go together. Toward the end the cheese tends to harden up but not to the point where it hurts to chew but still tastes damn good.

Roast Leg of Lamb
- To be honest the lamb shank didnt meet my expectations at all. For some reason i keep expecting lamb to tastes like...well...lamb. That gamey taste that people tend to hate i love because it's different and in lamb, at least to me, that's that makes it lamb. Now the shank was roasted to perfection as advertised. No trouble at all getting chunks of meet to fall right off the bone. What i got was a pretty small shank, at least in my opinion it was. The sauce that went was more on the sweet side then i would have liked. Everything else was pretty good. I just gotta stop ordering Lamb shanks thinking they're going to taste like lamb chops. 

Kibbi
- Okay i THINK this is the dish. Wasnt mine but i was offered some and i should have got this instead of the lamb shank. Not sure if the person who ordered it requested that they sub the ground beef for lamb meat but it was lamb meat and it was damn good. cant describe the seasonings but oh my god there was flavor in every single bite. 

Overall the prices of the entrees and even some of the appetizers will definitely have me thinking twice about eating here. Everything is a bit on the pricey side but it is worth the money if you know what to order. 

On the flip side, some of the sandwiches and wraps are so huge that it's totally justifiable for the price. If/when i do come back it'll most likely be for lunch or for a giant wrap. I can totally see myself here after work one of these days looking completely tired and miserable while nursing a shawarma with a side of fries just like The Avengers did.

I searched for the few remaining high ranked restaurants ('Off the strip') that I haven't yet visited and this place showed up as one of them.. Pretty solid at 49 reviews for Vegas and 4 1/2 stars..

Their *50th review*

Compliementary bread basket: came with a Pair of Warm Oven Fresh Pita looking breads. Oh so good! 

(Labeled) ""*Most Popular*"" - Frarej (Lebanese baked chicken): ""Half of a chicken baked with potatoes & ripe tomatoes, basted until golden with olive oil, garlic & lemon juice"". If you like garlic and you like lemon then you may find a match made in Heaven's or Hedary's kitchen! Chicken had a nice golden brown skin and meat was juicy and bone lickin' good!! Potatoes and Tomatoes supported the chicken Very Well and the sauce (be careful, sauce came Piping Hot like XXX degrees!) underneath the pan/plate was ready to be licked clean! Super Super Tasty Dish!!! Its like that Neighborhood Grocery - Rotisserie Chicken But with a Crispier skin, Infused with Garlic and Lemon Juice.. 

The Atmosphere was a bit cozy and a little dark (opening their shutter blinds a little more may help). Service was lacking a bit, I think my server was too busy playing ""words with friends"" on her phone to even bother checking on me.. I got here around 3:40pm and found that if I came by 3:00pm (11-3pm lunch time menu and prices) I would of paid around $13.00 plus a choice of hummus or soup or.. Instead, I ended up paying around $18.00 for the same exact size plate they serve at lunch and without any hummus or soup or.. Big Difference.. Not their fault, Just a Tip for those that don't know. And I think $18.00 was expensive for this chicken dish alone.. However, It was an Easy 5 Star dish for taste! In Conclusion, come here for lunch if possible and hopefully your server is a little more attentive..",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,2,1,4,KzQ3i-7lpXYD9vKyeO-NnQ

They had sold it to a very nice American lady. Service was great the new owner is very nice but the food is lacking EXTREMELY! The chicken shawarma tasted like chicken fajitas. The garlic sauce was soooo bland and the owner said she added potatoes to it to make it consistent. Growing up in Michigan where the majority of population are Iraqis and marrying a middle eastern man I know how to make a lot of dishes and know what their food is suppose to taste like.

It is tucked away in a tiny strip mall, but true gems are worth the ""hunt"" for and this was one of those elements.

Staff wise they are superb and overly inviting (they gave off that family vibe and appeal which made the lunch session that much more enjoyable). Our waitress literally was on her 1st day, but with service like she gave she made a customer out of me. If I could've caught her name I'd gladly give her some recognition, but overall everyone who helped us during the meal was just amazing!

Food wise I had the roasted chicken sandwich which came highly recommended. The chicken was so moist and seasoned to perfection (it had a hint of pepper, but not much else). The garlic sauce it was drizzled in was just so creamy yet sent my taste buds into overdrive. I even had to do a side note for the pita bread as it was not too heavy and really soft each bite (no soggy after tones either). That was by far the best of the best I've had anywhere.

Takeout last night had several negative points:
My Hedary's salad was packaged in the same bag as my husband's combo meat dinner, so when it got home it was warm and limp. How hard is it to package the cold items in a separate plastic bag?

That salad (that I've had many times eating at the restaurant) is usually amazing. Tons of fresh tomatoes and cucumbers and feta. My salad last night was a styrofoam box full of lettuce with barely a topping in sight. The tiniest sprinkle of feta. Not worth the price and if I wanted a box of lettuce, I could have bought it at the grocery store. 

My husband enjoyed his meat platter and the rice was delicious as usual. The hummus was outstanding. The pitas were cold and stale but I wouldn't expect them to be as fresh as they are in the restaurant for a takeout order anyway. 

Long story short, Hedary's needs to step up their takeout game. I've had plenty of takeout meals from other great restaurants that were just as good at home as they are in the restaurant.",5owNSGo6RELDdzBTxCFaxQ,1,0,3,eQFRMAZlcAYINucNGYRNQg

Number 2, the baked chicken dish (Frarej).  It's a dinner plate item, and it is great.  It's a juicy chicken crispy on the outside.  Even the vegetables around it were good.  Apparently its their popular dish.

My group met there on Wednesday night, March 13, 2013 and because we were seated at a long table (and there were 10 of us) they THOUGHT they could prepare a single check.

Our group leader had to inform them, in no uncertain terms, that ""We either get separate checks, or all of us leave for someplace else, right now!""

We got our separate checks.

The food is absolutely TERRIFIC and I'd definitely eat there again, but NOT with any group.

Try the Ground Sirloin Shish Kabob (""KAFTA"") and the Lentil Soup.  It's truly delicious.

With that in mind, I was thinking this was going to be better than Paymons (my favorite to date) and I'd have a new spot for my hummus and pita. I so wanted to give 4 stars, but it really is eh, I've had better. Paymons TOTALLY blows this place away!

For starters, when you walk in it's kinda cheesy. Lame tableclothes that remind me of the days when you'd go on a picnic with your family. Those plastic ones with horrible patterns. The decor was nothing inspiring of the Mediterranean. 

The food was Ok. I've definitely had much much better. It was also pricey. A cucumber and tomato salad was $9.95! The hellum cheese was good, but again pricey, $11.95. Paymon's flaming cheese is outstanding. I mean, it is mouthwateringly good. The lebni here was OK, I did like the cucumbers included with it, and it was $8.95. The portions were OK, but still the prices were way high.

The service was S L O W. We ordered our food and it took at least a half hour for the cheese to come out. The salad and lebni followed shortly after that but man, it took A WHILE!
They were not generous with the pitas. They should be flowing, especially when you've ordered the cheese and lebni. I dont like having to ask for that, it should be coming out often.

My friend ordered the lamb shank was wasn't impressed. He didn't care for the seasoning on it, and another friend ordered a different lamb dish and they both enjoyed that.  

We were a large group,15+, but we were the only ones in the restaurant, and they knew we were coming since we had reservations. 

Had this been my first foray into Mediterranean, I wouldn't eat the food again. Also, maybe it's because I think Paymon's is so good that this place fell short in my opinion.

I go for the kibbi, because practically no one in town makes it, and nobody makes it like this. Kibbi is a shell of bulghur, lamb and spices encasing a filling of meat, onion, pine nuts and spices. It's a labor-intensive dish (I know...I've tried) and this is made with love. Served on a bed of fragrant pilaf and a yogurt dipping sauce, I'm in lamb-y, happy kibbi heaven every time I have it.

Finish with the rice pudding. Seriously. It's wondrous.

3617031,2017-12-06,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Let me start by saying that the food is AMAZING. My Star and review is for the insanely long wait in a near empty restaurant and the misleading Free Appetizer promotion. 

We were there for 1 hour and 40 minutes. We spent a total of (maybe) 20 minutes eating our food and 1h 20min waiting as the astonishingly slow cooks prepared a plate of hummus, a salad and two dishes consisting of rice and veggies. I just couldn't believe the wait. Everyone there was suffering, waiting. One table of six, were sporadically served with their orders. One here, two there... I mean.. doesn't the kitchen staff realize how friggin ride it is to serve food to one person and make their 5 friends wait 20 more minutes for their food? It was kind of ridiculous. 

By the time we got our entrees, we were just at a loss for appetite and pretty tired from just sitting there, waiting. 
I asked for the bill and shower the server their Yelp promo coupon for 1 Free hummus, and he said: ""oh.. yeah... sorry, no. That's for the small serving. You had the big serving."" HM. That's weird. Because the coupon specifically states a Free Hummus for the table with a purchase of one lunch or dinner entree. And, the restaurant doesn't offer a Small hummus. Seeing how we had Two, I'd said we qualify. But, it was pointless to argue a point with a server who is not informed about promos at his place of work, in front of several people who are staring at us, waiting! It was so annoying. In fact, being a person from F&B myself, I would have honored it, or at the very least, would have READ the promo myself before shutting a customer down.  It's not Mike's (the server) first time messing something up. Whenever we ordered to go, he messed up our order to the point it would make me want to scream. Ridiculous. 

Food was delicious. 

Unfortunately, the excruciating wait time and the ending with the promo earned him a no tip.

4571175,2014-01-12,1,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Bookmarked for many years, I finally enjoyed a meal at Hedary's thanks to my friend Steven S.'s suggestion to dine here before we went to Container Park.  He and Nicole B. will be married in a few months.  None of us had eaten here and the whole menu sounded good.  We started with hummus not sure what else we would get, and the hot pita was amazing with it.  These combo platters stood out so as a table of 4 we all agreed to share 2 of them, and Nicole B. also ordered the cheese fyatir bread with mushrooms and za'atar, similar to a pizza.

I was drawn to the mezze, a chef's choice sampler of 12 appetizers and salads.  Ours came with...
1) hummus (so we got doubles!)
2) baba ganoush
3) feta cheese and olives with slices of tomato and cucumber
4) Stuffed grape leaves
5) Labni Matoom (yogurt-cheese with mint)
6) falafel
7) loubleh - green beans with tomato, onion, garlic
8) majadra: lentils
9) Greek salad
10) fattoush
11) tabbouleh
12) khyar bil-laban: cucumbers in yogurt mint sauce

Eric R. was drawn to the meat combo (our server's favorite dish) which consisted of rice, tomatoes, and...
1) beef shish kabob
2) kafta: ground sirloin with onion, parsley, spices
3) Mqaniq - pork sausage (only Eric R. ate this)
4) sujuk - beef and jalapeno sausage
5) kibbi - ground sirloin with bulgur stuffed with onions and pine nuts

This was a huge amount of food, plenty to share - maybe could have been enough for 6?!  The stand outs for me in the mezze were the Bulgarian feta chunks (yum), the labni matoom, and the tabbouleh.  From the meat combo, I only tried the sujuk and the kibbi because the guys at the table were carnivorous and had the plate in front of them, but I loved both the sujuk and the kibbi!

What I like about the menu is that if you want a salad, you can pick any salad and add protein to it (lamb, beef, gyro, chicken, salmon, or shrimp).  Eric R. is interested in coming back for the meat-filled dolmas but I make them at home so he is already well fed by me!  I want to come back for lunch because lunch specials include a smaller portion of an entree but come with a choice to fattoush, tabbouli, hummus, baba ganoush or soup on the side.  Service was great and the chef even came out to chat with us after the meal to see what we thought.  He told us all of the sausages are made in house.

Side note: the women's bathroom is really interesting.  There is a mutant mirror and purse hook in there!

I would go back, and when I do, I will devise a way to get both sujuk and kibbi on my plate!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,10,5,4,5f5cg4FzfQVEaiQWz-0aew

4947985,2018-05-17,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Friends wanted to do Mediterranean and try a different place from Hummus Factory. 

Their Yelp! Check In promotion is a free Hummus appetizer with a purchase of an entree. Even without the Yelp! offer I would still order this. Every restaurant's always have different ways of seasoning hummus and for this location, I can appreciate the very garlicky notes in the hummus. Theirs is also a very smooth consistency and not overpowering on the tahini sauce.

Their baba ghanoush on the other hand is okay. I appreciate the differences in consistency, but it was too similar to their hummus. 

What goes better with hummus and haha ghanoush? Fresh out of the oven pita bread! In my haste at downing 3 baskets between friends, I forgot to ask if their pita bread is made in house because it was so fluffy,  compared to the very dense and thick like store bought pita.

For an appetizer, my friend ordered lentil soup. Soup was very strong on lentil flavor, with garlic and onions not over powering the dish, but the downside was the soup was pureed smooth like the hummus. Great soup, just needed a garnish just to offset the lack of texture.

One friend ordered the Lebanese sandwich. When you think Mediterranean, you would think fresh, healthy. This one was a miss. The sirloin didn't have too much flavor and had to ask the server for tahini sauce. Also, you would not think Mediterranean food you would find your entree swimming in oil... But it was. The pita bread to meat ratio was off, with there being more bread than filling. For the price offered, I get it, but at least trim the bread to provide the perception to customers that they are not being ripped. 

My other friend ordered the Meat Plate which was a combination of 1 Skewer (ordered  medium rare), 1 Mqaniq (Lebanese pork sausage), 1 Kibbi (ground sirloin meatball stuffed with onions and pine nuts), 1 Kafta (ground sirloin witj spices) and and 1 Sujuk (spicy ground beef). Skewer was seasoned great, but temperature was medium. Myaniq and Kibbi was underwhelmingly seasoned and borderline dry. Sujuk had great spice and seasoning. The rice was phenomenal: fluffy and not mushy, nice lemon after taste on the seasoning.

I ordered for myself the lamb chops and I ordered rare. Aside from the temperature arriving medium, the flavors were great. The sauteed vegetables were swimming in oil. Well, not literally, but the cook was very liberal, I should say. 

To finish off our experience, we ordered their baklava and shabiet. I'm a sucker for baklava and I hate to say it, I was not a fan of their take on this classic staple. The size was impressive but it ends there. The filo pastry sheets didn't seem to be that fully baked so the flakey and crusty characteristic you would expect from it was amiss. Instead, it was very hard to cut and the honey/rose water syrup/crumbled pistachios was not that enjoyable. 

The shabiet on the other hand offered a savory sweet finish to our meal which was delightfully unexpected. The milk custard had the consistency of a thick cut of a mozzarella loaf that was about over half and inch thick that was warmed so it kept it's square shape but yielding when cut with the the side tine of the fork. The honey and pistachios provided the sweetness. Sadly the filo dough wasn't crispy as it should be, but the combination of the nuts and the remaining crunchiness of the dough provided the nice counterpoint of texture.

Next time, definitely need to order the pistachio ice cream.

Overall, the experience was mediocre. Server was great especially when I messed up and didn't read the lamb chops came with French fries and changed out my order to their rice. Just the liberal use of oil, underseasoned entrees, and the not so crunchy filo dough made me rate it 3/5. But the hummus, service, lamb chops, and the fresh pita is enough for me to return for future visits.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,0,0,3,QGsS0ButgwkUcH-q35McuA

5049749,2011-10-31,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"The BF and I haven't been back and the last time the food was fresh, great flavors- just stellar food. 

I looked online and saw they have falafel on the menu so off we went to get a sandwich. It was decent. Good crunchy outside and soft inside of the felafel, the veggies were fresh on it (tomato, bellpepper, lettuce, pickle) and the sauce was decent. It was a fresh taste, but it needed some oomph from some hot sauce. Good but not the best felafel in town. Their sandwiches come with fries and it was okay. I would think a mediterranean place would do them more with seasoning and a yogurt dip, but I ended up with ketchup.  

We shared a baklava and for $4.50 it was a decent size square. It came oddly with slices of apples, but that did kinda work with the syrup. Their baklava is more fragrant with rose water than most which I like but the phyllo wasn't crunchy as it was undercooked. 

Service here isn't the most personable. Yes my water was refilled, but there is another dining room and you can clearly see staff sitting there eating, watching TV, etc. When we needed something we have to wait until the waitress decides to come to the room. 

The price on their site and their actual menu has changed from $9.50 to $11.50. As much as it is good and fresh, their hike in dinner prices, specially for a sandwich is pretty high. That wasn't $11.50 worth of sandwich. My favorite felafel in town is $6.  

It is good, but I think maybe for lunch (they do that until 3pm). It seems that a majority of the rave reviews are the lunch crowd. Good food, but not value or service during dinner.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,1,3,Gj6fT_pT8NpmQNEujsVDHA

5199235,2011-01-05,10,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Few things in the world make me as happy as a good falafel and a bowl of delicious lentil soup. Beans are brilliant, and when cooked up in either one of these concoctions, they are close to infallible. At Hedary's, they do these beans beautifully. 

I have dined at Hedary's on numerous occasions. However, recently I had avoided Hedary's. Finally, I decided I had to go back as the lentil soup was calling me. Resistance was futile. We returned for lunch, and I am slapping myself for all of the bowls of lentil soup I have been missing. 

The lunch specials are a great value, highly recommended for all of you lunch break peeps. I ordered the falafel plate, which comes with about 6 big falafels, a cucumber salad with mint yogurt dressing, hummus, pita and a bowl of soup or salad for $7.95. In case you were wondering, I get the lentil soup, which is a yellow lentil, blended lightly like a dal and spiced perfectly with heavy pepper. They serve it piping hot, and if I could fill a bathtub with it, I would. The big, puffy pita are also fresh and delicious.

As for the falafel, they have fava beans, which some may not like, but I think they are delicious, and they have the best consistency of any falafel I have had Vegas. The kind of pop open when you slice them with the edge of your fork, which to me is the sign of a winner! They are not salty or overly fried. This may be my overall favorite falafel currently, but you have to be able to appreciate the fava flavor. 

My hub went with the Cornish hen lunch special, and you get the whole hen! Impressive. The roasted carrots that are served with the hen would make a bunny a sad addict, i.e. these things are tasty!

The service can be a little abrupt, but the hot, nomalicious eats that I consistently receive more than make up for that. Hey, they could throw falafel balls at me, and as long as they were tasty and landed in my mouth, I would be back for more. (I would just ask for a free bowl of lentil soup to make up for the poor service.)",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,18,12,5,nI6bJEHG-0r6GFs4V8dRww

5295237,2008-08-26,7,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Some friends were in town and they wanted to try a new restaurant. We stumbled upon this place and noticed it was voted ""Best of Las Vegas"" in 2004 and 2007. How can you go wrong with that? We walk in and promptly get seated. I dont recall anything out of the ordinary in regards to the Middle Eastern ambience. On to the menu... We give it a look over and before we can even order, they give us some complimentary Ftayir, which is Lebanese bread. It was warm and tasty.

Our party ordered the following:

Most Popular Dish - Frarej - Half of a chicken baked with potatoes and ripe tomatoes, baked together so that the juices and flavors from the chicken and vegetables permeate each other, basted until golden with olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice.

Shawarma Plate - Beef grilled with tomatoes and seasoned onions, and served with Lebanese tarator sauce and a generous bowl of Lebanese rice.

Shish Kabob Combo - Lamb, Shrimp, Beef Kabob, tender and succulent cubed and charbroiled with fresh seasonal vegetables laid on a bed of Lebanese rice topped with seasoned onions.

The best out of the three was definitely the Beef Shawarma Plate. The chicken seemed a little dry and the shish kabob combo was good... but not excellent.

I'll answer my two favorite food questions, which I always ask:

Would you order that dish again? Yes. Shawarma. Excellent.
Would you eat here again? Maybe/Yes. It's not on my top 20 places to eat when were throwing restaurant names around, but if someone else wanted to eat here, I would probably go with them.

They give you a basket of hot pita bread perfect for hummus or labni...or for scooping up any saucy dishes.  I always leave feeling satisfied and something to take home.

Last night, a few Yelpers and I were here for Stephanie S's birthday.  I shared a Meat Combination (beef kabob, kafta, mqaniq, sujuk and kibbi) with rice and grilled tomatoes.  My favorites were the beef kabob (tender and well-seasoned), and kibbi (flavorful cracked wheat and ground sirloin).  We also had some of Vanessa N's labni matoom (yogurt with mint, garlic and olive oil) which was good.  


They only have 3 types of dessert: ice cream, baklava and shabiet.  Since we can get baklava and ice cream at most places, we got a shabiet (filo pastry with honey, milk custard and pistachios) for dessert and they gave us an extra one.  It's  a light creamy and flaky dessert.  I enjoyed it...always have.

Ultimately, that just meant that we had the two servers all to ourselves. Due to that, my water glass was never empty and the endless baskets of bread kept coming. The tables were also well manicured. I am anal when it comes to clearing away dirty dishes and removing scraps from the table. The girls did a great job with keeping us spotless.

The food comes in ridiculous portions. I noticed the prices were steeper than at other Mediterranean places. After ordering, I could see why. These portions are nuts. The $33 mezzo sampler can easily feed four people. In fact, it did. If I had came with just one other person, we would not have been able to dent it. All of their dips use a generous amount of garlic. I had fire breathe by the end of the meal. I was impressed. Definitely not a date type of place. I had sneaked a few bites from everyone else and the food is solid. I would not order the lentil soup again though.

So the place was empty which always scares me, but maybe that was a good thing because we had a large party that they had to deal with. For how dead the place was, service was spotty. Had to keep asking for more pita bread (which was warm and tasty). Our food came out really slow and staggered, a couple who had left and came back later somehow got their food before myself and another friend. I ordered the Chicken Shwarma sandwich (12$) and he got the Lamb Shwarma platter I think. Well, when we were wondering if they forgot about us, we could hear who we assume is the chef yelling about Shwarma...uh oh! Not too much longer and we finally got our food. My sandwich was huge with a giant side of fries. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was, it was so big I was able to share it with my husband who showed up late. Another friend ordered Lebni which I had never had before, if I was ever to go for Mediterranean again I would order this to share, or just to snack on with drinks.

I really love this place.   My normal order is the Falafel plate lunch special, in which you get 6 lovely balls of fluffy goodness (insert embarrassed smiley here) amongst other things.   The amount of food you get with this and their other lunch specials is insane.   Falafel, some cucumber salad that I always give away because I hate cucumbers, a container of delicious hummus, three pieces (I've had this vary from 2-3) of fantastic pita bread, and your choice of soup or salad in which I ALWAYS get the Lentil soup.   I totally dig that lentil soup even though I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that at 32 years of age I don't really know what lentils are still.   I would advise you to start with the pita bread and dip it into the lentil soup and take a bite.  Then take the same pita, cut up a piece of falafel and put it inside along with some hummus.  Take another bite.   I suppose you could eat this meal in a variety of ways but I cant guarantee the same 5 star experience I have each time.

I've also had the Tilapia special several times, and it's equally as good.  With that one you still get your choice of soup or salad (GET THE SOUP), and then you get a big container chock full of baked potatoes, veggies, and a nice piece of tilapia baked to perfection.   

Service is always great, but that could be helped by the fact that they know me by now when they answer the phone and they have realized that I'm an amazing person.   For the amount of food you get the price is right.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,1,5,_VXUyNRW8GBfhhNCO2ug4w

Which leads to my only criticism. 

I love garlic. I love it more than the average person, it seems. I wanted the baba ganoush because I knew it would be garlicky.  But the afternoon we were there the garlic was soooo strong my tongue was tingling and my mouth hurt!  The salad actually verged on being inedible. I took it home to see if i could dilute it with additional lettuce, but by then the garlic had mellowed a bit so it didn't hurt. Wow.

For starters, their pita bread is to die for. Easily the best I have ever had, by far. It's served hot and puffed up and it just absolutely incredible. You will definitely be ordering an additional basket of it.

The night we were there they had an appetizer special of Lebanese Halloume Cheese. OMG it was amazing!! It comes to the table flaming and the plate presentation is fantastic. After blowing out the flame I tasted the most incredible cheese dish I have ever had. 

I also had the Lebanese sausage that was recommended by other yelpers and it was great. Very spicy but flavorfully spicy, not just hot for hot's sake.

The hummus was great as was everything else. I will say I've had better gyro before but that doesn't mean the gyro at Hedary's wasn't good, just not the best. Skip the gyro and get everything else.

The reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service just flat out sucked. We went with a couple of friends who said the service always sucks.

It just made me feel like I was at one of my friend's Greek uncles house.  It was great, a little pricey for lunch, but I will definitely go back again.  I should've broke my plate after the meal.

We were not disappointed. We eat Lebanese in many cities in the US and Canada. This was amongst the best. Very flavorful. We had the mezzanine platter. That was well worth the price. Tabbouleh is some of the best I have ever had.",Idbf9dy8WJtd0bryfCyCYQ,0,0,5,oEXxISEdgHEK2S9X1HzP8Q

The main entrees were not very good either.  I liked a spinach salad but that was about it.  I won't come back and I don't recommend it.,pDjtWz1xH_Vi48l88o86VA,0,0,2,SDeb0ybb9mp8YnsO8ZlD_A

I'll be honest I don't eat Mediterranean food often but I know good fresh food when I taste it. So when I see fresh steaming pita bread being served I started salivating and the humus was excellent. With the shish kabob the beef was tender and the veggies perfectly done. The chicken with the Frarej was tender, juicy and full of flavor, I must say if you don't care for lemon skip this dish but I loved it. I've officially put Mediterranean food as a viable option when considering dinning out and Hedary's is the reason why.",m-I2uTU5Y1sQIaZ5l8yytQ,0,0,5,wEYfBqDzLP9ZYO90FTV1uQ
5802197,2014-07-29,0,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"I stopped by after getting a massage next door and wanted a snack so I just got the babaganoush. It was good and came out as a decent sized portion and the bread is freshly baked. The place seems legit so I was hoping for the more traditional version of babaganoush I got to know after spending some time in the Middle East where it's a lot chunkier and isn't pureed to look just like hummus - sadly I didn't find it here.

They do have a Lebanese coffee which is a must try. It's very similar to a Turkish coffee...the water and grounds are boiled together in a traditional pot then it's served just like that with a little cup. The key is not to slurp down the last bit or you'll get a mouthful of sludge.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,2,0,4,g5AdGKCGLXgMu43noiHdrQ
5809608,2011-12-20,2,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"It has taken me a long time to write this review.  This was one of my first favorite restaurant in Las Vegas when we were thinking of moving here a couple of years ago.  I had been and tried everything and loved it. 
Then my wife,  our friend that introduced it to us, and I went together.  The food was great,  we're trying everything.  My wife ordered a Turkish Coffee,  she was drinking it and enjoying it.  All of sudden she got very quiet.  I asked her what was wrong.  She pointed to her coffee cup.  I looked into it,  and thought I saw a coffee bean.  I said so.  She told me to look again,  which I did.  There was a cockroach cooked in the coffee. My wife was nauseated. We called over the waitress, showed it to her, and here is the part that earned the one star, she did not even really react! She just said she will take the price of the coffee off the bill! And then we started really looking around and saw two more dead cockroaches.
I am not saying she should have brought the owner out, told the chef, had him prostrate himself begging his forgiveness or anything. I am not saying she should have offered the entire meal comped. 
I am saying she should have reacted a little, look at least surprised!
This was and is the greatest dining disappointment I have had in Las Vegas yet. I still look for the perfect Middle Eastern restaurant here and have found a few good ones.",5fefSJ8gFQd_nANLezdfpw,8,1,1,cs8iFI-KpznxL5mq0nQBIw

But my dining companions always seem to enjoy whatever they order from the menu as well. It is a bit chilly in there sometimes, but well worth going to. Since things are made on the spot it can take a bit of time to get your order....but it is worth every bite!",5mkRo6VhwdYQ0X2qbBFE_Q,0,0,4,ghyjbSHMgOi7tQeR-058VA

This restaurant is just like Khoury's down in the SW part of town (same owner, I believe, and almost identical menus). Khoury's makes their bread better, but no complaints about Hedary's. Every dish I've ever ordered at Hedary's has been good. I've never ordered anything I didn't like, whether one of their sandwiches or entrees.",jk969jHhllucGa6w8Unr9w,1,1,4,TfXlDYWYcLpAbPEpIFd7Kw

We had the Sujuk Meatballs, Hedary's Trio (Tabouli, Hummus & Baba Ganoush) and the meat Grape Leaves. Let me just say, all I kept saying...mmm, mmm, mmm. I couldn't stop eating. The dishes are just bursting with flavors, and so delicious. What I love most, I don't feel guilty eating here. It's healthy and flavorful. 
Also, Joey our waiter was very attentive, provided great customer service. Always pleasant and professional with a smile of his face. Very down to earth. I highly recommend Hedary's Restaurant for a Mediterranean Cuisine.",U5_ejijOPRhWTAHOFS7zBw,1,0,5,00ZnMHxbyFKVjltxIrXU5g

It's located off SAHARA Ave. in a shopping complex facing Rainbow.  The inside decor fits the food and sets the dining experience.  

We were immediately helped to a table.  The service was very attentive and helpful.  The waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and made several recommendations to our table.  We ordered several appetizers to try.  The portions are grand and definitely large enough to share.  The hummus sampler was divine and the pita bread was warm and delicious.  The salad was fresh, flavorful with just enough light dressing.  The lentil soup had a kick to it...it wasn't my fav BUT I'm not much of a lentil consumer!  The kabobs were perfect...I didn't try the lamb however.  

Overall, I would highly recommend this locally owned and operated restaurant.  Great menu selection, good prices and overall rememberable dining experience.",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,4,2,5,aqMri01Se5_y3Eox5DlInA

5919174,2012-12-04,4,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Third time is the charm.  A little reputation for not necessarily being open during their posted hours forcing me to take my $ elsewhere.  This time, on a return visit to Vegas, I finally caught them open!

A cute and intimate 2-rooms of dining, little white lights, and traditional music in the background.  The service is lovely, friendly, and inviting. The menu had about 8 things I wanted to try, but I opted for the beef shawarma ($16.50).

Oddly, only 6 diners on a Friday night at 830pm; a positive, very quick service.  The shawarma smelled amazing, with onions, chunks of tomatoes, and spices (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw?select=_WLTQ-uw4f2gamZg-ClDEA#b4Za0Nt0-AFGipOpR_W8vQ).  It wasn't what I was used to, as the meat was diced (not shaved), and while tasty, the flavor was mostly onion, and I prefer the dominant spice as garlic. It also was served with a small rice pilaf, but no other sides (salad, nor tahini, nor garlic sauce, nor hummus, etc).  So I can't say it was a winner.

As an appetizer, I did have an order of hummus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw?select=_WLTQ-uw4f2gamZg-ClDEA#tXwkmvXgKInfbNj7wyx5GQ) -- fresh, good, a lot of tahini, and the pita was served toasty and puffy...excellent (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw?select=_WLTQ-uw4f2gamZg-ClDEA#_WLTQ-uw4f2gamZg-ClDEA).  The lentil soup is supposed to be amazing here, but they were serving a lamb soup instead -- so I passed.

So, while it wasn't the best Mediterranean food of all time, I'd like to try a few more items.  Overall, it was a worthy experience, and therefore, another trip or two is in my future.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,9,10,4,6q--WGa70OcICGIxSFkFIw
5930124,2012-01-08,2,Ssa6XY_RdDRRB9wuVIeIWw,"Came here for lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by the large portions and delicious food on their lunch specials. To start, the fatoosh salad with cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, red onions and lettuce and the hummus. The salad tasted very fresh (we were seated right next to a display case of fresh veggies) and the hummus was pretty awesome with their pillowy puffed mounds of fresh pita bread. So good! Plus the portions were definitely much bigger than I expected; I started feeling pretty full after the apps.

For my entree, I ordered the frarej (I think that's what it's called) which was a roasted half chicken on top of tomatoes, potatoes, squash and mushroom ($13). The half chicken was huge! Also really tasty, tender and juicy with slightly crispy skin. I wish I could make chicken like that! The bf ordered the lamb kabobs which came with rice pilaf and some veggies ($14). Everything was delicious and definitely worth the price, especially since the portions could make two meals for me :)",Zt9Z6g55BJ_Z0pAUQgAMeg,4,4,5,G3GDfJaICDhFZh9jTlJMew

The service is somewhat abrupt, but they get the job done and are always generous with the refills of drinks and pita bread. The servings are plentiful and delicious. I have pretty much had everything on the menu and I like it all. Some of the my favorites are the lamb schwarma sandwich, game hen, frarej (baked chicken in lemon & garlic juice) and the loubieh to start your meal off right. I also really enjoy their salads. They have lots of fresh ingredients the dressings are divine. If you get any of the sandwiches I recommend the fries. They have a great flavor and just the right crispy to soft ratio. If you're a fry lover like I am, you'll understand the importance of this.

This place is fantastic. I'll be back soon (as always).",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,5,dl5ga7c5YtHsy1W_LK3l6A
