I ordered the Fatoosh salad with chicken and an order of Sultan's bread. Before my order came up, someone's Greek salad was up and I nearly changed my order because the Greek salad looked that good! 

The Fatoosh salad was good: romaine lettuce with tangy/sumac dressing and the crispy pita chips were sizable and still crispy despite the dressing. The chicken was tender and quite flavorful. Perfect lunch portion! The bread was eh. 

Will definitely be back (for the Greek salad next time) and would highly recommend this place!",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,2,0,3,0F2h9HJUSB8bTeRIXGc8AA
1238385,2015-06-24,0,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,Good food and great prices. Had a gyro and a Greek salad. The staff was friendly and greeted you when you walked in the door. I will be going back.,45eiU5txR6UxmjX8yldlrA,0,0,5,QcMd13HIVkNa1bazbE0fdA
1329746,2016-06-29,1,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,"We ordered our food and was given a number. The counter person passing out the orders called every number except ours. We watch him bring a bag up that he tied, and then untied because he could not find the number. He still did not find our number and retied the bag. We watch him set the bag aside and continue to call other numbers after ours. We go ask him where is our number. He asks us what we ordered and when we tell him, he tells us ""oh here it is"". My french fries were burnt and now cold from sitting so long because he could not find our number. The Curry chicken and rice looked disgusting and very dry. Not enough cuury sauce.Do not waste your time eating here, unless your like cold dry food.",jAmjEhz_DINx8M3LlTjTjw,0,0,1,BmXA7VA6UHEk6E_gUHebDQ
1503561,2015-04-14,4,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,"Mediocre, as far as Mediterranean in Vegas goes. BF picked up takeout here after a trip to the courthouse across the street. The gyro salad is fresh, but doesn't have much meat on it and the dressing is odd. The chicken shwarma plate was disappointing: dry meat, tzatziki is plain sour cream, pita is hard and clearly store-bought. The rice was nicely seasoned, though. Not at all worth a second visit.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,4,2,GpvsiAfFgQJbAQE6ty7uQQ
1724187,2015-02-17,1,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,"The 1 star is because they are across from the courthouse.  The food is awful, the chicken gyro was dry and they put an odd pickled beet and cabbage mixture on the gyro...why?  The taziki (sp?) sauce was straight sour cream with scarce brown representations of cucumber...it had no real flavor.  Overall, VERY disappointing.  I should have had pizza right next door!",_BRYBQqeVodHfdwhYtUqpA,0,0,1,TqeNAacVDekpvVyWKOYnLg
3573339,2014-08-19,0,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,I really love this place! I get the beef Shawarma sandwich and get their homemade hot sauce to put on it. The hot sauce is so good and not spicy so I highly recommend it with any dish. The food is amazing here and they are really friendly. It gets pretty busy during lunch since the courthouse and everything else is right across the street.,J1fvapGoL1Stnw-L9OFgQw,1,0,5,qZUdOUs6UWTsQCF2AO6OTw
4477879,2016-05-08,0,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,This is a good little place for lunch. The menu is pretty comprehensive and the prices are fair. They do a good job of giving you lots of variety in a single dish. They have daily specials which can sometimes be a good deal. The meat is pretty tasty and the prices are fair. The staff is nice and they are pretty fast even when they have a crowd. I go here pretty regularly.,02liOYDrd2G8b93uHMckpQ,0,0,4,6tYBQxhHFWIiQfsa3CEKug
4540130,2014-09-27,0,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,"This is my first visit to Sultans Grill and it was amazing.  Steve the owner is a really nice guy who runs an amazing business.  I ordered the chicken strips, something my daughter and I really wanted and let me tell you; first off they are made fresh to order and when they came to the table i was shocked.

This was a real chicken (not processed, not bought from a supply place, but a real chicken breaded and sliced into strips and cooked to perfection.  I have never had chicken strips prepared from scratch in any place.

So how were they, AMAZING....this place is located in a small indoor food court across from the court house and if you ever get the chance to head down to Lewis and 2nd street, you need to visit this place.

They have an great looking menu and from people who have been here many times, this is one of the last places you would expect to find food of this caliber, but I am here to tell you what, this is the first place I will go when I am looking for a good meal during the week.

Most people will say downtown???  It takes nothing to get downtown and this place is worth the trip.  I will be back often as the menu has a great selection of items I am wanting to try.  I added a picture of the chicken and fries so you can see the amazing chicken strips.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,1,0,5,evGilxcDNv9wlvY0ul_m8A
4656027,2016-02-22,0,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,This place is so delicious. They are spot on with the way they cook their food. The chef and the staff are friendly. This is by the far the best Mediterranean Food I have tasted. Thank you to the cops who told us about this place. YUMMY,oqUQKnh3EwKBrlw8PF0b1Q,0,0,5,w-7qe0yBZwgViyGiv-VUEw
4659394,2015-04-28,0,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,"The beef shawarma was decent, but unremarkable. The gyro wasn't good and the tzatziki was bland and thick.The fries were reasonable, but that's not much of a feat.

I really dig the baba ganoush though. Chunky mild eggplant, well seasoned. Was worth the 2nd trip to have again, even if nothing else was. Would have been 2 stars otherwise.",YG-Vg20GYIA6dHRg5SRJZg,0,0,3,w5B765GbmxpkTtY7EyEv6g
5949842,2015-11-25,0,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,"This is not fine dining - it is a walk up counter to order a quick lunch when you are downtown by the RJC courthouse - so I am giving it 4 stars in that context. However I prefer it to most other quick food downtown, and eat here ever other week. I recommend the Spinach Pie when it is the special, otherwise the Gyro, shwarma or Greek Salad. Lunch specials are often $8-9 including a drink, great prices for downtown.",w-5aIgCj3bgx73kHVtr0_w,0,0,4,eeM8Xv32hwRvQ-mzq75Eew
5959336,2015-07-07,6,PelnfQ7PxGeW2J43OwnQ_w,"Another disappointing food court find. I didn't have high expectations but I didn't feel like walking too far in the heat, I settled on Sultan's Grill. 

I ordered the gyro wrap combo with rice and that also comes with a drink. It was an enormous portion and I was full after only half of my wrap. The rice was sad and overcooked, the gyro was ok but overloaded with raw white onions and tomatoes. The meat was more cubed than sliced and didn't have any char on the sides. What they called tzatziki sauce was essentially overly chilled sour cream.

The service was standard. They do get really busy at lunch time and just before my turn to order the cashier took two phone orders while I waited. Luckily the cook came up to take my order so they could get it fired up while I waited to order at the cashier, which I appreciated. 

Overall, it's there and it's edible. That's really all I can say.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,7,2,PhHBWr0WW-ltNQ34AvB7pw
