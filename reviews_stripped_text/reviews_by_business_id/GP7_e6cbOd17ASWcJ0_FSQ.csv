That staff was 10/10. I highly recommend this new karaoke joint.",wy22Tr9RuDQbC7gB2ZHVjA,0,0,5,0L3mOUGGWrUMSs9jnGpApA

This place also has a good selection of food with both karaoke classics you see throughout the vegas valley such as pizza and wings, but also some amazing Korean dishes such as jokbal! Everything we tried was delicious and had great flavor. 

Highly recommend coming to this place for your next karaoke night out.

P.S. happy hour is from 4PM-8PM with rooms being only $15/hr! Right now there's also a grand opening special of buy 2 soju/beer, get 1 free. Definitely a great deal.",ip_HaeAYAfVyWTdez2AQYg,0,0,5,DnpnIqYc3XmLbhXgUbExXw

Also you can try amazing Korean food which was yummy taste. The host Anne was so nice. There are many sitting area outside the each music room to take a rest. Spacious parking lot provides convenient access in comparison to busy Spring Mountain facilities. It is located in convention center, clean and safe. 
Highly recommend to all of you !!",IiwOipL5k2hnlEO6kb4v-Q,0,0,5,Fg_C_TbIE2XCmDeW7QCFdQ
