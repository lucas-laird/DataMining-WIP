11437,2011-03-22,0,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"So, maybe I had some fault in entering into this food expedition but I still have to say something.

My first mistake. I was drawn in by the pretty blue lights on the outside like a moth to a flame. The food has to be good, right?

Second mistake. I pull in to the parking lot with some hesitation and my sister says ""should we look at the reviews?""  NAH! Let's just look at the menu.

Third mistake, we look at the menu with some confusion but already felt pot-committed so we sit down.

The restaurant is best described as having an identity crisis, in decor and in food. The food ranges from Russian to Soul Food to Italian??? The decor is best described as early 90s with some fancy chandeliers and a child's play room????

The sides available with the BBQ dishes make sense for your run of the mill ribs, bbq chicken, brisket, etc., but not so much for the more russian-influenced side of the board. Some sides were whited-out, so they obviously changed the menu but which sides were whited-out varied from menu to menu. More confusion.

The best thing I ate was the french fries. Hand cut. In fact, that ended up pretty much being my meal. The mac and cheese was garlicky and mushy- good for mashed potatoes not so much for mac and cheese. 

We were making it through the meal with minimal satisfaction when we were asked to pay half way through because the waitress was closing out her bills for the evening. Let me mention, this was not our waitress!! Long story short, it is possible that I may be charged  twice for this meal because of some miscommunication and inadequacies on their part. They promised that they cancelled the first transaction (but did not present a cancelled transaction receipt).  Giving them the card again may have been my fourth mistake, but it has yet to be determined. 

And on another note, they don't take restaurant.com so don't be fooled.",iunhP0pDZBDJ0fNk_-7LCw,1,0,1,vxeOESSKNkfyNYNIqlX5bA

The place still looks the same but they changed chefs again. I would say that this time they need to change the cook or something if they want the business to be successful. 

I ordered the baby back ribs that comes with two sides. The ribs came in half slab, it was dry and salty. The mac and cheese tasted like it was the ones you microwave and the fried okra was blah (needs more seasoning). I have to say that the banana bread pudding was probably the only thing worth coming here for. But one of the items that caught my eyes was the frychos which is nachos and french fries. It sounds really yummy! As for the prices I think it is a bit too much since the food isn't that great. $20.99 for baby back ribs with two sides that isn't even that tasty. 

I don't think I'll be coming here again, if I do it's probably only going to be for the banana bread pudding and if they change the cook to a better one that knows what they are doing.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,15,2,2,0z-VKpbtdfJS3B964b09RQ
249710,2010-10-19,0,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"Do not waste you money here.  It is the worse excuse for BBQ we've ever eaten.  The brisket was very dry and not flavored well, the Mac and Cheese looked like boxed and the ""fried"" catfish wasn't deep fried but ""shallow panned"" fried from what we were told, which looked like they just baked it and it tasted undercooked.

The atmosphere was nice.  Our waitress/manager was nice, but the owner(?) was on the snippy side when we sent back a raw tasting fish for the dried brisket that wasn't edible. They tried to tell us everyone wanted non-deep fried fish now so they quit making it like that and that everyone usually loves their BBQ and went down the list of the chef's credentials to show us how wonderful he is.  

We warned the ladies coming in as we were leaving that it was horrible, at which the manager started coughing.  Coincidence?  I think not.  And, we didn't ask, but they didn't offer to take any portion of the meal off even though more than half of the table couldn't eat it.",ueCkYms5-gsobEPzfh_IwA,2,1,1,0d-6jF_VEBwn4Z9j60NRkg
415593,2011-09-01,0,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"Boo! This place has a major identity crisis going on. I'm guessing it has changed ownership, because it is definitely NOT BBQ!! If you want to do Mediterranean food, do it. Then take down the expensive neon signage that grabs passerbys. Shut off the laser light show.

1115765,2010-11-09,10,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"What not to do when opening a restaurant! 
Future restaurateurs, take notes, this will be on the exam. 

For the short time Blue Fire BBQ has been open, there have been changes in chefs, as well a fairly significant turnover in wait staff. This is the first warning sign. 

The draw of this place is the pretty blue lights that ornament the bar and sign, not the food. Those shimmering aqua lights make for an awkward setting once inside the restaurant, and do a fine enough job distracting guests from the mediocre food and service. The ribs were tough, salty, and dry. The side dishes left me yearning for Boston Market, clearly not a flattering comparison. The place was empty both times, once during lunch and once on a Tuesday evening. 

This ill-planned catastrophe is hanging on by it's last rib. As a lover of BBQ, I was ecstatic when I saw Blue Fire BBQ open up. 

Unfortunately, a good idea wrapped in a box with pretty blue paper is still just an empty box.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,24,10,2,DXkwarUQKF7_swIhoVGKkQ
1252292,2011-08-11,0,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"I hate to give publicity to a truly awful place but it is important to me to let those living in Las Vegas about Blue Fire BBQ. This is beyond bad food and lousy service. The evening ended with the owner trying to throw water on a table filled with laptops and other electronic equipment and police being called to intervene. According to Ask.com, there are 2,374 restaurants in Las Vegas. I would recommend you try the other 2,373 restaurants before going to Blue Fire BBQ.
So let's start at the beginning.
I am a food writer, not a food critic. I write about chef profiles, restaurants, cuisines and beverages.  If I don't like a place, I just don't write about it. So I was thrilled when I was invited to a networking meeting at Blue Fire BBQ. I had never been to the place and looked forward to maybe discovering a hidden treasure. 
I walked into a very beautiful place that was deserted. I mean not one single person was in the place and it was 6:45 p.m. on a Wednesday night. I saw the banquet room filled with people, which is where my meeting was being held, and I walked in.
This is a networking meeting so I wasn't planning on eating a full meal but I was planning to buy an appetizer and drink. When the waitress, which I found out is the owner, brought menus to our table filled with three other writers, I asked if there were any food specials being offered for attendees of the meeting. She immediately developed an attitude and after some discussion, I found out there were no food specials, only drink specials. Then she stomped away, not asking anyone at the table if they wanted to order and even took the menu away from the one writer getting ready to order.
Afterwards, one person from our table went to the bar to get a drink and when she returned, told us that the owner was nasty to her about giving her the drink special price. We all looked at each other and the three of us went to the bar to get our drinks. The wine was $3 a glass and we each gave $5. The owner THREW the money back at one of the other writers and myself and said that she liked the one writer but not the two of us.  The writer asked her what did he do and what happened to make her treat him like that.  I spoke up and said that she didn't want us to ever return. She said I was right and then started screaming at me that I insulted everyone and started shaking her fist at us. We walked back into the meeting.
We did let the person who organized the meeting know and she apologized profusely. The evening continued with the presentation and I then chose to leave early since I was hungry and obviously not welcomed. One person I knew walked out with me (along with her sister) and said that they were almost bullied into buying food and that the food was terrible. They also vowed never to return.
At a networking meeting, there are sponsors who pay money for display tables to promote their business. One sponsor was a digital specialist company with laptops and other electronic equipment set up to explain what they do. One of the other writers stayed behind and let me know later that there was an altercation between a sponsor and owner and she picked up a glass of water to throw on the computers. Sara Gabriella  Creative Genius at Finesse stated ""I was one of the sponsors who had my computer, my phone and my iPad dumped with water. After which, she grabbed my computer and my iPad and threw them on the floor! My partners and I were given an incident number by the police who made the report and told we could file charges or file for compensation for our damaged electronics. Truly the most horrendous experience I've ever had and I sincerely apologize to any, and all, our guests who were subjected to this rude, aggressive and, in our case, violent, behavior. Thank you Debbie for warning unsuspecting would-be customers about this threat.""
I have interviewed many, many restaurateurs and chefs and the one common denominator is that they want to make people happy with their food and service. Since there are 2,373 other restaurants in Las Vegas, patronize them instead.

My friend and I decided to try something new, and went for lunch when it first opened this morning (7/2/11). The menu has an identity crisis going on. I couldn't decide if it was Mediterranean BBQ or American BBQ.... Once I finally picked a burger from the back of the menu, I was informed that I couldn't have anything from the back, so I just ordered a cheese burger with fries. 

The fries were completely raw in the center. The burger had Kraft american cheese , and it wasn't melted. There was a pool of grease on my plate. The tomatoes were not quite ripe yet either. The bun had weird burn markings on the top of it like it sat too close to a camp fire, and was singed on one side. The BBQ sauce was KC Master piece (or at least tasted just like it).

I'm still confused about the play place next to the bar. Isn't that illegal? 

I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for food, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to flip a really nice looking restaurant into something awesome! Just as a side suggestion for anyone who may want to purchase this place. 

1. Create a small simple menu, and do it really really well
2. Get rid of the ""BBQ"" from the name
3. Get rid of the play place
4. Offer a free meal to anyone who ate here and thought it was bad as a gesture of good faith.

BAM! instant credibility, and an easy turn around.",1csYUsGUX4vwHH-YmRTgQg,2,0,1,0d6drMVN07DGBPHJ8AwWpw
4928735,2011-08-02,0,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"The atmosphere was similar to a McDonalds.  We looked over the menu for 20 minutes trying to actually find something we would eat.

Is this place BBQ?  Is it Mediterranean?  Is it Italian?  Not sure.

Plus, we used a Restaurant.com certificate that clearly said it never expired.  They argued with us for 20 minutes about it not being valid.  It was and they just didn't want to honor it.

5053043,2010-09-28,3,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"the place itself is very clean and felt brand new.  the hostess wasn't nice, wasn't mean - there isn't much to say about the service.  it was pretty indifferent.  the atmosphere was actually pretty awkward since we were the only ones in the restaurant.  

i ordered the pulled bbq pork sandwich.  it was dry and salty.  i pretty much hated it.  the fries, however, tasted pretty good.  my boyfriend ordered the hotlinks and he said it tasted fine.  its pretty hard to mess up sausages.  i'm not sure they should be in the bbq business though - i feel like the venue has potential but they should maybe change their menu.

overall, i give the place two stars because the venue itself was nice.  i would have given it a one if it wasn't.  i would say skip it.",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,15,2,2,AlvI_z9uhNIBIw76-hI39w

5433856,2010-09-08,7,W3cR01oSjxDzaTFlkZsoGw,"This is one for Gordon Ramseys kitchen nightmares. My wife and I went to Blue Fire last Saturday evening. There was one other customer in the resturaunt. That was the first clue. The bartender was nice and after a short conversation learned that she was just hired and had only been on the job 10 minutes. Then the fun started. 3 screaming little kids(either owners or employees) started running and screaming thru the restaurant. When ordering my meal, my wife asked if the dinner came with a salad, the bartender/waitress looked at the menu and saw that you could have greens, she had no clue what greens were. After enlightening her about the vegetable, she placed my order. I want to remind you that  my wife and I as well as one other person were the only ones in the place. After 30 minutes I had to interrupt the employee and ask when I was going to get my meal that was already cooked. She excused herself went to the kitchen and upon her return explained that my order had not even been started. Anyone reading this. Do not waste your time or money.

The main issue i had with this place was that it was trying to turn barbeque which in my opinion is a relax,messy, gluttonous affair into a pretentious meal. 

I dont want my ribs served to me in small,dainty portions and sprinkling parsley over my entire plate does not make it fancy -__-' 

the place tries to be fancy but then goes and builds a McDs-esque play place inside the restaurant.W. T. F.? nothing ruins a meal like annoying children and neglectful parents.

The waitress was very rude and had a language barrier. Food was horrible. I had the Gyro and the pita was hard n the meat had a freezer burn taste to it. Another girl had the brisket which was so dry it hurt to swallow it. Another girl had a salad and stated the lettuce was not fresh. Someone had the mac n cheese and stated it tasted funny so she asked what kind of cheese was used n the waitress answered: OUTOF A CAN..We waited 45min for our lunch & one of my coworkers still didn't get her food and had to cancel it..I will never ever go back to this place again!
