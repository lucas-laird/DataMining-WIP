The fried pickles were great too.   It's located in a bar so kids can't exactly come with you.   The owner is very personable and looks out for his customers.

So I continue to order my wings and ordered 3lbs of wings with a side of fries and a drink which I didn't know I had to go to the bar to get my drink all I wanted was a sprite as I asked the lady for a sprite she asks me for my I.d really my i.d which there was never no SIGN in front of the doors saying I needed my i.d!!! I was coming from out of town so I had left my I.d back in the hotel never did I think I needed my i.d to just go order me some wings to go! she immidietly tells me I need to leave and that I am not allowed to be in there  after I had payed for my food! So I try to wait for my order and she than tells me again I need to leave in front of all the customers so I walk out very embarrassed i couldn't believe this! I literally  had to wait for someone to walk by to ask them if they could bring my wings I had ordered and had payed for!!!,cnTQ2D3TQyN6wf3JMmxf1w,0,0,2,d59Uqa5HoJNgXoTqd72I6A

1729388,2015-01-31,3,e1DfwqDhYQYLKoyHmJu0hQ,"So happy to see that WK has found a new home! I was heartbroken after they left their old space, and really appreciate management reaching out to message old customers via the Yelp reviews to let us know about the new location.

The most important info: they have 80 flavors, but garlic parm is the best. They now offer chicken strips in addition to the chicken wings and pig wings (not always available), order by the pound. New location is a counter inside of a bar, must be 21 to enter- dine in or take out. Friendly service, food made to order, can call ahead to minimize wait time.

Though the garlic parm has my heart, I tried the Jamaican slam and really enjoyed that- the medium garlic was medium but had not even a hint of garlic? Found the wings to be smaller and less meaty than past location. The wings are sold by the pound but did not seem to be that weight. One pound order, per menu, is at least 7 pieces- my order had 8, each pound is $8, works out to $1/wing which is on par with most places in town.

Dropping my review down a star- don't know if it's an ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" thing or what, but I just remember this place being better. It's now a bit out of the way for me, and I will keep them in mind when a wing craving hits but won't be going out of my way to get out here regularly.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,3,3,apZUV65xXhd_wQ1tGXHXjA

2023636,2015-05-25,1,e1DfwqDhYQYLKoyHmJu0hQ,"This wing spot is tucked away inside a sports bar. It's dark, dive-y, and a bit of a questionable neighborhood. The menu, of course, is all about the wings. You can order chicken wings or pig wings by the lb. One flavor per a lb. There's also some combos, chicken and waffles, pizzas, sides, etc. We opted for 2 lbs. so we could try multiple flavors. We ordered half spicy strawberry cheesecake and half cajun hot. We also got a side of potato salad.

The Wing King server/runner was very nice and brought us our food, utensils, extra plate, etc. The wings were large and meaty. Big points for that. They also had a nice crisp. More points. And they weren't stingy with the sauce. More points. The ranch dipping sauce was nice. The blue cheese dipping lacked flavor and was too runny. The yogurt dipping sauce was super bland and boring. I wasn't a fan of the spicy strawberry cheesecake flavor. The spicy is cinnamon. I was hoping for habanero or something. It was just too sweet and dessert like for me. I don't want my chicken tasting like a cinnamon roll with a hint of strawberry. The cajun hot flavor was great. It tasted similar to Wing Stop's cajun. It was good mix of cajun flavoring and heat. The potato salad was incredibly bland and could've used any kind of something (pepper, mustard, something).

Things I wish they did... List the sauces in order of spiciness/heat. It was quite difficult to determine which hot sauce was the hottest. #1 as hot, hell was like #5. So is hot hotter than hell? I don't think so. Some ranking of the sauces would ease ordering for newbies. And as there are 80 sauce options, picking just 1 or 2 flavors is already a challenge. I also wish you could get 2 flavors per 1 lb. so you could experience more flavors.

All in all, great quality wings, cooked perfectly. And it's great to have so many flavor options. This spot is way far away from us, so not sure how often we'll make it back. But I want to come back and try some other flavors.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,5,2,4,XHDXLN8l8NlQDDwj--yyRQ

I got the Mozzarella sticks and they were amazing with their ranch! It was a little cold because they delivered and it was kind of far. (Which I think is awesome that they deliver further than just a few mile radius!)

The delivery driver ended up being the owner and he was very very sweet and polite. And he was very easy on the eye which is always a plus with your delivery man! Hehehe

Needless to say, I will definitely be ordering from here again!",11Qfaoyg3BiciQ4ffKO0JA,2,1,5,LsZH8CZdFvI0lGMuCXZnOA

2759606,2015-03-04,4,e1DfwqDhYQYLKoyHmJu0hQ,"My love for Wing King has not changed. Since my last review was 5 stars, im gonna have to bump this down to a 3. Why you may say? Read on.

Dont get me wrong. I love the wings, the plentiful sauce choices, and even the people that run it. But I have to be honest. There are several things that bother me about this new location.

1. Since its inside Adrenaline Sports Bar and Grill, only 21 and over customers can come and eat here. So that means I cant bring my kids and eat here as a family. Which leads me to the next gripe.

2. Smoking is allowed inside so that means that when you decide to eat here, at any given time there will be people smoking. I dont know about you guys but I dont like the taste of cigarette smoke while im eating. Not only that, if the place is packed with lots of people smoking, your clothes will smell like a fully loaded ash tray of cigarette butts.

3. You order wings by the pound now. Say what? My philosophy is, if it aint broke, dont fix it. Maybe change some things if it doesnt seem right. If you do change it, at least make sure its a good change. Whenever I ordered in the past which was most commonly the lunch special which was 8 wings, fries, and drink for 7.99, it always hit the spot. Now you have to go by pounds. I dont like it.

Now for why I love Wing King.

Before you had your choices of over 60 sauce choices. Now its over 80. Im always down for new flavors. My favorites are the Jamaican Slam, Mango Slam, and Garlic Parmesan. 

Did I mention that you can have the fries tossed in any of the sauces as well? My favorite is Sweet Chili Glaze. Try it. I was hooked since day 1.

They also have Pig Wings. I call them pork on a stick. It's like drumettes but the pork version. Very flavorful and tender.

Recently they just added chicken and waffles. This did not appeal to me. The waffle seemed like it was from frozen and the syrup that it came with was weird. It did not taste like syrup at all.

Last but not least, they have some really good dessert choices. Things like Peach Cobbler, Red Velvet Cake, and Pound Cake just to mention a few.

In closing, when you first come here, from the outside it does look pretty sketchy. Its almost like a strip club setting. There are no windows and the entry door makes you think that you are going into some kind of strip club. Looks like I might have to order to go for eating here is not going to be pleasant. Sorry Brian. I gotta keep it real. Your wings are still the best. They are 5 stars. The location is 1 So there is your 3 star review.

Otherwise, this place was not good to me and my family at all! We are avid foodies and really appreciate great food. At the same time we hate wasting money on horrible food. This place was a waste of almost $26! We ordered 3 lbs of wings (approx 7 wings per lb). 1 of sweet chili jerk 1 strawberry cheesecake and 1 garlic mild. It was late Sunday night so possibly the best cooks were off. The meat was so bland my crew refused to finish them. The sauce was an afterthought, meaning I probably would have been better eating baked unseasoned chicken then pouring some sauce in my mouth after a few bites. Think white looking wings with little specks of sauce here and there! And the size.... The wings were tiny! Think 1 1/2 bite size wings... At approx $1.25 per wing! Smh horrible! If your search app brings up this place as nearby, like mine did tonight, do yourself a favor and drive an extra gallon to somewhere else! Trust me, the $2.86 (I drive premium) is worth it!!! Never again! ***and if by chance management see this post. Please note the way to make me a happy customer is to refund my cc.

The owner personally messaged me to apologize and compensate for the poor experience I had. Very respectful guy. They sent me a free order of wings so I got the Jamaican Jerk I believe , Medium Buffalo wings and Spicy Mango pig wings. Buffalo wings were good, the jamaican jerk wings were awesome and the Spicy Mango pig wings were really good too, soft and juicy. This is what Wing King is all about. Id recommend anyone to try it at least twice! 4 stars solid.

Unbiased review (Updated from about a month ago)

I just ordered from Wing King, got it delivered because I came to visit a friend here in Las Vegas. We got the Spicy Garlic Parmesan, Medium Wings and Spicy Mesquite BBQ PW (Pig Wings) with fries. Wasn't blown away but I wasn't totally disappointed. The Spicy Garlic Parmesan wings, weren't spicy, and if they were seasoned for spice I didn't notice it. The Medium wings, (Medium buffalo) were ok, I actually liked these the most out of the three different flavors.  The Spicy Mesquite BBQ, was pretty bland. The Fries were okay, kinda soggy but that's kind of expected when you get delivery.

Overall okay.",pTv-ZfSeAY9aYrCL7jzZuQ,2,1,4,7yJCHPAq7tf6HQV0ucYevQ
