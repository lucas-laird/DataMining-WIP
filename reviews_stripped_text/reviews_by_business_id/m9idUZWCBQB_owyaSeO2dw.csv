2370800,2017-06-18,0,m9idUZWCBQB_owyaSeO2dw,"Tacos El Rey! I learned of this excellent Mexican food/restaurant. February 2016 from a Target employee. This is not Americanize Mexican food !

At that time I had the Huevos Ranchero is excellent and served not how we're accustomed to. This establishment makes all their food from scratch. There is nothing poured from a can per se. 
The tortillas, sauces, meats, and beans are cooked daily. Along with ingredients for your tacos, etc. It was the first place I wanted to have dinner after arriving and checking in Las Vegas!

Roberto who works here as a chef served me: fresh made salsa, both of different heat. The hot of the two, Has the of pop hot, yet was subtle. It doesn't overwhelm the senses.The othe salsa, was rich in flavor, with the texture of the chiles, onions cooked with homemade red sauce. It's not thick like a puree density. I noticed this as well as the other salsa. The chips are homemade corn tortillas cut into wedge. Not greasy, with the right amount of crunch!

I ordered the chicken tacos, beans and rice.  The order arrived, 3 tacos, comprised of a slightly smaller, yet the tortilla is corn/ slightly thicker. However, it is not dense. 

The chicken is fresh and diced, served on chopped lettuce (not iceberg), with some garnish of diced tomatoes. Along with wedges of fresh lime. The Mexican rice is fresh, fluffy and the refried beans are fresh and cooked superbly. 

I had lemonade.

2525656,2017-04-10,0,m9idUZWCBQB_owyaSeO2dw,"Today I was searching for a Mexican Restaurant and found Tacos Del Rey. The menu had a variety of choices. 

I chose the shrimp burrito and asked for red sauce on top. The waitress did earn me it was spicy but that was a bit of an understatement for me. If you can't handle spicy you may want to ask that they don't use jalape√±os. However, it was totally worth it. It was so yummy. The burrito was moist. Many burritos are cooked too long and end up drying out the ingredients. The red sauce was very good with a hearty and spicy profile.

I had a bite of the ceviche tostada and the ceviche was outstanding. It has beat any other ceviche tostadas I have reviewed. 

I also had a bite of the carne asada with green sauce. I don't usually like green sauce but this was very tasty. It had a bit of a kick as well. I wasn't as impressed with the carne asada. It was a bit chewy. 

Overall, this is worth the trip and has a lot of great food choices.",kn4lbh5vEsqeo5SbHWS_HA,0,0,4,XEKDEZD4PR66VhXyjhWRag
2595394,2015-04-15,14,m9idUZWCBQB_owyaSeO2dw,"We ended up dining here by default one Friday night because our favorite sushi spot (Sakana) had a whopping 1 hour wait! Ain't nobody got time for dat.

We were all hangry (hungry & angry) so we decided to sit at Tacos El Rey and munch on some chips and salsa while we wait for our table at Sakana. After we tried the chips, salsa and guacamole we immediately agreed to postpone Sakana until the next day and try out this spot instead; our first tastes were incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor.

Unfortunately, the chips and dips were deceptive; the dinner combos served to us, although fair pricing, were all mediocre. It all made sense to me why they were completely dead during dinner on a Friday night. I also peeped a major restaurant no-no while dining as well, multiple tables were left unturned, trash and used plates sitting and waiting to be cleared the entire time we were there - not proper. 

Here's what we tried:

Chile relleno plate $9 - we have had our share of chile rellenos under our belt and this version is as basic as it gets. No compelling sauce or flavor captured our tastebuds and the rice and beans are not memorable. Flavor rating: 3/5

Carne asada burrito $6.50 (add cheese for additional fee) -  It's passing on flavor yet totally lacking in the proportions department. They went crazy cheap on the fillings. There's barely anything inside of the burrito so it was practically flat! (Refer to my picture) That's sad for a standard burrito. Flavor rating: 3/5

3 carne asada tacos plate $7 - The carne asada had descent flavor, but the meat was exceptionally chewy and overcooked; far from juicy. The uninteresting rice and beans are offered in measly portions. The best part had to be the tortillas, they were very soft and fresh. Flavor rating: 3/5

It's unfortunate that the portions are not consistent and shockingly skimpy. They have so much potential to step up that delicioso game! Until then, I'll keep at bay.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,17,19,3,7sosohBITGc7SUOHoIkPiQ

2nd issue........ we were a party of 15 and all they can put on the chip baskets was 5 chips per basket... i thought they were putting us on a major diet...

3rd issue.... the famous salsa.. wow that was a bomb ass salsa.... i wont give names but there were 3 people of my party that almost ended in ER ...for being in the restroom dehydrated. .... hour after hour of having major runs.... dam you salsa....
never again will i go here or recommend this place....

Never again, if the meat was as salty as they were in my fries I will not be trying anything else from here. It was so salty I ate about half of my fries and discarded the rest. I was hungry or else I wouldn't have ate any of them. They looked good but very plain.
Compared to other places in town they are a bit cheaper here, probably for a reason. They contain; fries, overly salted meat, cheese (probably Monterey or mozzarella) beans and sour cream. Yup that's it. Portion is also smaller than other places. 
Save your money from here and try any other place. Will not be going here again.",uYCjMIWMjb1mE1SzMaBXFQ,0,0,2,ZdoS5YqGZDz8L86h-RIR2w

I have had ceviche in Peruvian restaurants down in Orange County, in Costa Rica, as well as homemade, but the ones at Tacos El Rey are amazing.  The order will come with ceviche, chopped up soft octopus, and cooked shrimp.  They serve it on a tostada shell and will give you an extra one if the shell gets too soggy, plus extra limes and hot sauce for condiments.

Update as of 4/22/14
I have to say, the service really isn't as nice as it was before in terms of going the extra mile.  I still go there for fish tacos, platters, and horchata, which are decent.

What's good: The place was super clean. The tortillas are super soft, tasty, handmade. Carne asada cooked perfectly. Rice and beans tasted great. Salsa was good, not as spicy as I like, but flavorful. Chicken quesadilla was big, had a good amount of cheese and lots of chicken; plus it wasn't greasy! The bad: The portions are very small, except for the quesadilla. I swear, the tacos looked kid size. The rice and beans were a small portion smeared across a wide portion of the plate so that it looked a lot. The rice and beans were served cold as if they were portioned out before the tacos were done. Husband had a chorizo taco. The chorizo was bland, which was disappointing bc on the menu it states they charge more for it.",Y6Ax3JHhwPasZLSjTaQLqg,1,0,3,ljs2LWT2jbUWs3N-we9kUw
