Went here on my birthday last Friday, May 12. Arrived around 9 pm, maybe a few minutes after that. First, I just want to say- fantastic service from ALL the employees working that night. They were very nice, welcoming, and that to me just makes my dining experience all the more better. 
 
Went with my daughter's and we ordered two large skinny crust Italian Garlic Supreme pizzas, soda,  and an all you can eat salad for me. DELICIOUS!!!! All of it. I love Round Table pizza, but since we've moved, we no longer qualify for their delivery services because we're outside of their delivery range. It's kind of far from where we live, so we don't get out there much but it was my birthday and we had to made it happen!!!! Couldn't be more pleased with the service, the food, the cleanliness of the ENTIRE restaurant. It was perfect. And I speak so highly of the customer service because good treatment is sometimes hard to come by with many restaurants. So when I find an establishment whose employees provide exemplary service, well I just have to show my appreciation by telling the world!! Yes, it's that serious. Oh, and also, I must mention how even though they closed at 10pm, we were there past that time just laughing and having a good time, and we were not rushed to leave. Outstanding staff!!! Thank you, Round Table!!!!

Anyways, the food was amazing!!! I'm telling you, Vegas doesn't know that Round Table is one of the best Pizza chains out there!!! I know this because my home state is California and trust and believe Californian's know what's up with Round Table!!!

The pizza for the most part tasted the same, but I've found other pizza places that I  like. The biggest turn off there was the lack of customer service.

1687860,2015-07-13,8,U7xPpLet56Zhi5GDZNlmoA,"I have many a fond memory of RTP in my home town when I was growing up.  It had ample space for various school and social functions, and outstanding salad bar, and a modest yet fun game room.  It was there that I discovered the King Arthur Supreme.  When I think of a solid tasty pizza that takes me back to the days of my youth, I think of this master piece. 

The KAS consists of Pepperoni, Italian sausage, salami, linguica, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, black olives on zesty red sauce (RTP website).  To this day, I still don't know really what linguine is.  I know....I can look up on the internet.  But I believe this is the magic ingredient (like something in the Coke recipe) that makes this a legendary pie.

When the time came to reintroduce calories to my body after an obstacle course race, this location and several KAS would be a fitting end to a glorious day.

Rolled and order up. Zac M. rolled in shortly after and ordered up.  The lady behind the counter was all smiles and happy to assist.

Sadly, the former beer taps sat dismantled.  But this was not the order of the day.  It was all about pizza which was served up in quick fashion.  It was simply marvelous to look at.  It tasted equally marvelous. The food coma was had by everyone except perhaps Zac M.  He may have been having the food coma version of a small pox episode because he broke out in the sweats.  After several minutes and his body regulating, his vitals returned back to normal.

The customer equivalent of ranch dressing came when the nice lady behind the counter stopped by to tell all to have a nice night.  Outstanding!  If barley soda was provided...it would have been a five star experience without a doubt!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,9,10,4,Zggj_vLoGxRV6ugCHKzsBw

I know my family and i will not be coming back after seeing that. It's a busy sat night with almost no place to sit or clean tables.

Rude how Ray and another employee wait til she started eating to ask her to leave, sounds fishy like Ray was looking for a motive something. She seems like a genuine &sweet lady when i asked her what that was all about, she stated she's had problems with certain employees so it makes sense that they were looking for a reason to ask her to leave.

During lunch hours they offer the pizza buffet for $6.99.  Pretty cheap lunch so why not try it out?  They have cheese stuffed bread sticks, small salad bar and about a half dozen pizza varieties.  Fairly good pizza but I wish there were more options like some of their competitors.  

I did enjoy their breadsticks.  I had to ask for dipping sauce though.  I wish they would have some out for guests.  The lady looked at me like I was crazy for wanting sauce.  I think she gave me the smallest cup she could provide.  Oh well.  

Service could be improved as stated before.  I also noticed dirty plates and tables weren't cleaned off right away.  I may have seen one guy make a round through the dining area while we were there.  For a buffet style lunch I don't think that is often enough.

2054006,2012-07-31,0,U7xPpLet56Zhi5GDZNlmoA,"I am a long-time customer and fan of RT.  I've been going there since preschool (Washing and Oregon stores, not this one).  It's been years since I've had it and I got a craving for it.  So last weekend, we decided to head down there.

The only reason I'm giving the RT two stars is because regardless of everything else, the pizza is very good.  I think as long as they stick to the RT recipe, the pizza will always be fine.  With that said, I am thoroughly disappointed in our visit.

When I ordered it took forever for the guy to understand my order.  It was a pan crust, half King Arthur Supreme, half Hawaiian... Not that difficult.  My wife was a little surprised at the price, but I told her it's fine.  RT is good and worth it.

While waiting for the pizza, we had the salad bar.  What a sorry excuse for a salad bar.  It's 2.5 feet of nothing.  Wilted spinach, a small variety of veggies, and three dressings.  I remember when the salad bar was ten feet long and included bread sticks... That is no longer the case.

They came out with a pizza in 15 minutes.  I thought that was pretty fast.  Well, it was screwed up.  It was a thin crust all meat pizza.  No where near what was ordered.  When I told the server that wasn't what we ordered, he said ""are you sure?""  Really?  I think I know what I ordered, and there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, so there's no way he was mistaking us for another customer.  I told him what my order was and he took the pizza and left... with no apology.

50 minutes into our visit we still had no pizza.  I am a very patient person, but this was ridiculous.  I went to the counter to get my money back and saw the pizza coming out.  The cook asked what I wanted and I told him to give me the food I ordered nearly an hour ago... in a box please.

We got the pizza and enjoyed it, but the rest of our experience ruined our visit.  There are good locations and marginal locations, but I can't remember a bad visit before this one.  It's highly unlikely I'll ever be back.",Anuuo7l9KgAsSvnOHXcE1g,2,0,2,JQBgN50Q9soR45JOGSnV6Q

Weird restaurant layout, they have a huge eating area at least a 100 people but their food area was big enough to fit a soda machine, 2 pizza, and a small salad bar.  How would it be when this place is packed?  Then again I've seen places like this have fast service before so its possible. It may seem that Cici's pizza could have stole some of their business I  think they're about $3, never tried them yet.

With that said, I went with their 6.99 lunch buffet which used to be 9.99 before. I gotta say, the buffet choices were pretty solid. You get a full salad bar, garlic cheese and cinnamon bread twists, and most importantly, a variety of pizzas. The garlic cheese and cinnamon twists were really good! Both had lots of flavor and was not dry at all. The pizza was what it has always been. Lots of toppings. That's what RT is known for, generous portions of toppings. As for the salad. Come on man, nobody goes to a buffet to eat salad! But if I did, the choices were actually pretty good. Better than Cici's or Chuck E Cheese.

The only thing that kind of bothered me was that the same guy that held up their 6.99 lunch buffet sign was also their busboy. That part didn't bother me. What bothered me was that he did not have a Round Table uniform of any kind. He just had a plain button up shirt, shorts and sneakers. To me it looked kind of weird that he was walking around cleaning up tables when he looked like a regular customer. To me I thought that was kind of unprofessional. If you work for any company and are in plain sight of customers, you should have some kind of uniform that indicates you are an employee.

Some random info. Their 6.99 lunch buffet is available Monday through Saturday from 11 to 2. Drinks not included. They have other lunch specials that range from 6 to 9 bucks which includes sandwiches and salad.

Overall, the taste and quality that I have known from my trips to other Round Tables was still there. Solid 4 stars.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,10,4,4,IYj1gthHGhG3e42LsyPCjA

I went on yelp and found round table and ordered from them? I don't know who order 24 is but fine, they screwed up and next time I should call round table direct, EXCEPT !!! When my MEDIUM not large that I paid for shows up 1 1/2 hour after ordering the guy has a round table shirt on!! I ask him and he works for round table not eat 24!!

So Round Table screwed up and made a medium when I paid for a large, they blamed another company that had nothing to do with the delivery and even lied and said they called them and their driver was almost there!

So not only did you make a mistake on the size pizza and it took 11/2 hours but you couldn't admit to your service failure and blame it on eat 24.

The crust, the sauce, the toppings all make for a great pizza, but I don't think that corn meal is used on the bottom of the pizzas anymore and that is a shame. 
No, customer service is not the best, the carpets/seats are usually stained, and the tables are not cleaned as often as they should be. I go for the pizza, but the prices are outrageous in my book. We ordered one medium single topping and one small four topping and one drink and the bill was $30. With that kind of prices, a family would have to budget in a trip to RT instead of just dropping by on a whim. 
I have only been to RT once since moving to LV last year. Looks like it may be another year before I get back there.",YVQFzWm0H72mLUh-8gzd5w,2,1,3,Xsy-HVo_nCuaQEoBJZKqRQ

3203662,2011-11-07,14,U7xPpLet56Zhi5GDZNlmoA,"Rex is not a man of compromise. It isn't to say that Rex hasn't tried. Rex has. Don't believe Rex? Calling Rex a liar? Rex only lies before sex. Still not satisfied? Demanding proof? Smart. Very smart. Rex does the same thing, and since DNA is only 99.99999% accurate Rex still has no official heirs to his empire.  314 wins and no defeats. Rex is good.  Enough bragging...proof you want...proof you shall have.  Compromise number 1.  In Singapore Rex wanted to cut off Michael Fay's hands and sew them to his knees. The government wanted to let him go. We compromised. Rex caned that little punk...and kicked him while he was on the ground crying.  Compromise number 2.  Rex wanted Mr. Rodgers to completely strip down and put on an entirely new outfit. The prudes at PBS said that he shouldn't disrobe at all for a kids show. We compromised. Rex recommended shoes and sweater...a star was born.  Last compromise.  When working as a legislator in a southern state many of my constituents wanted to pass a law that allowed them to marry their daughters...no matter how young or old. Rex wanted to castrate all of them and throw their penises in a raging fire so they can never be used again. We compromised. Now in virtually every southern state you can marry your cousin at a very young age.  Rex can and WILL compromise.  

Once again Rex compromised.  A person who dares to call himself a friend (Rex calls him an agent of the government sent to watch over him) suggested that we go to Round Table Pizza.  Rex suggested that he lay down in traffic and wait for the pain to end. We compromised. Rex was able to huff gas right out of his tank, he paid, and Rex ate.


When you first enter Round Table Pizza the smell is surprisingly good.  Almost like good pizza.  Rex and his governmental guardian got the all you can eat and drink (soda not beer or ammonia, you can't even drink your own ammonia) and settled down for our feast. They give you two plates. One for the salad bar the second for the pizza. The booths are uncomfortable and tight.   Every gentleman knows that the first course is the salad course. Rex walked over to the salad bar and it was just all right. Nothing wrong with it. Nothing wonderful. Nothing memorable.  They had very good shredded cheese and excellent real bacon. Four or five dressings. Some other toppings. Not bad. Rex sits down, clears his throat for eight or nine minutes, blows two snot rockets and is ready to eat.  As expected the salad was okay.  It wasn't offensive and for the price Rex didn't pay, it was better than some salad bars for more money...and they don't have pizza.  The ranch dressing was above average. Not a bad start.

Rex reluctantly walked up to the pizza window.  There were two freshly baked pizzas and one that looked like it was made the year Betty White lost her virginity.  Rex took a few slices and sat down fully prepared to raise hell.  Sadly, Rex was not totally correct in his assumption.  The pizza while not great pizza, and if you made it in New York City someone would have you killed, wasn't horrible.  The first slice was a white chicken pizza with jalapenos.  Shockingly good. Rex was stunned. The second slice was a standard pepperoni and sausage with red sauce.  This is where the wheels start to fall off.  The red sauce is not good. It tastes like canned sauce you get on sale for 50 cents at some discount food store.  It had no real taste except for dried herbs and a little acidity.  The sausage was dreadful. No taste except for pepper and the pepperoni was bland.  Rex was unhappy, so he spit that crap onto the floor and went up for a couple more slices.  The white pizza with chicken, bacon and tomatoes was very good and the mushroom pizza with red sauce was dreadful. Over cooked mushrooms, no flavor.  

The one thing that should be said is that Rex has a huge Johnson.  The other thing that should be said is that the crust is surprisingly good. It is very buttery/oily but in a good way. It gets crispy and has a decent taste.

Round Table Pizza is exactly what it should be. It is a low cost option for people who don't know or can afford a good pizza. It is quick, easy, and cheap. The food isn't great, but it really isn't offensive either. If you haven't lived in the Northeast of the United States you have no clue what good pizza is anyway, so why spend more money on what is sure to be crap?  Get a salad, a drink and some pizza that is slightly better than frozen pizza for under 10 bucks. Fill your faces...nothing will make you forget Rex. Nothing will ever make that DNA test  will never be 100% accurate.  Hear the kid screaming? Hear Rex running? Of course you don't...Rex is long gone.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,13,9,2,HuwvSo0fNDrdMawNIBmODQ

Found Round Table Pizza close to our hotel & decided to stop in.  Upon walking in, there was a party in the party room to the right & in the main part of the restaurant were about 12-15 children, unsupervised, who were evidently associated with the party in the other room.  The kids were screaming, yelling, running around, climbing up & over the booths, & sitting at clean tables pouring & mixing together the peppers, parmesean cheese, salt, & pepper.  They were completely out of control!  Parents did absolutely nothing to try to manage them.  We decided immediately that we'd order take out instead of dine in.  No one from the restaurant said anything to anyone associated with the party while we were there.  As we picked up our pizza, however, the girl at the counter asked if I was part of the party.  I told her I was not & that I'd wanted to dine in but I couldn't handle the noise.  She apologized & said they'd asked the parents at least 5 times to manage the kids & the parents just weren't doing anything about it.

Upon returning to our hotel room, we ate our pizza & garlic bread.  Then, this morning my daughter started throwing up.  Based on prior experiences similar to this, we believe she has food poisoning.

We had to wait for almost 10 minutes for the guy working the register, and two of the kitchen staff to finish flirting with the girls in front of us that came in to pick up an order that was called in. The staff could not deduce which order was theirs, out of what looked like a very limited number of options. An offhand comment was made that they should sell the girls ""a big bag of 'oregano'"" - this will become more relevant in a moment.

FINALLY, they finished the debacle that was handing off three pizzas and collecting funds for said food.

We ordered, had to repeat ourselves multiple times as to what we wanted, the guy behind the counter had the toughest time listening/comprehending/pressing buttons.

When our food finally came out, we were wondering about the logic behind their pizza. The wife ordered a specialty pizza that had all sorts of vegetables and some meats in melted cheese. For whatever reason, some of the vegetables were just thrown on *after* the pizza was cooked.

My BBQ chicken pizza was ok, messy as all could be, but tasted alright. 

When it came time to rinse my hands of BBQ sauce, I made my way back to the restrooms. Remember when I said the staff's comment earlier would be relevant? There was this very distinct, strong and pungent smoky smell coming from the kitchen area. Wonder what that could be. Not really, I know what it was, I've been to high school and college.

Once that hit our nostrils, it became clear why the staff could not concentrate or use basic logic to figure out which order to give the customers.

Here we are three days later and my wife is still trying to get to where she feels better. Amazing how eating at a place can have an immediate and long lasting effect on a person.

No problem.  I call this Round Table, and they are more than happy to take my order.  I ordered the All Meat Marvel, and it was great!!!  Thanks for bailing me out.  Now, you will be my FIRST call!",V2LfRoD_Ws-qAxr2Kria-w,0,0,4,bWzcuWW5IMgsS1T-fF5P8Q
