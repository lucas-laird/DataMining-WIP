6197,2013-02-08,1,AUOlDSQ8R2wIkN4lQ4kVDg,"WOW!!! 

This restaurant is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! Don't get me wrong the other restaurant is still my favorite peruvian restaurant to go to with family but this place is a definite close second and much closer. 

I came here with my mom to try it out because we have heard such good things about it. Boy were those people right, this place has the makings to be a very sucessful restaurant. The inside of this restaurant reminds me of a 50s diner with its layout.

The food very very good. The only thing missing was a traditional chicken dish, but that was the least of my worries. 

The employees were even kind and helpful when it came to deciding what to choose from ( from what i saw tonight) they even came from time to time to check up on the customers.


The Best Peruvian Food in Las Vegas? Hell yea!
Will I come back? No doubt about it.

158528,2014-08-16,3,AUOlDSQ8R2wIkN4lQ4kVDg,"The reason this restaurant is even getting two stars was because of the ceviche. The ambiance is a feeling of confusion. They can't decide to be a high end restaurant or a diner. The menu lacked a few of my personal favorites. However, standard Peruvian fare was readily available. 

We started with the ceviche which was undeniably good, but lacked the crunchy corn that I love with this dish. The Loma Saltado was good per by BFFS review. My dish was so poorly cooked on the other hand. My egg was over cooked. I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it came out well. It had decent flavor, but was quite chewy. 

As for the service it was seriously lacking. We never got refills on our drinks and I was given a steak knife well after I finished dinner. 

Over all we were not impressed. I dub this the ""fast food"" of Peruvian cuisine.",lri6dj49yDp1YdIyklxb3g,0,0,2,REqdMroFqV65aJLDLrtl4A

I ordered the Ceviche and the Lomo Saltado and they were both outstanding! The flavor and presentation of the ceviche was excellent and the Lomo Saltado was prepared perfectly.

We were way out and away from the strip on Decatur when we saw the small yellow and lime green sign which read: Lima LÃ­mon. Not having had the pleasure of eating Peruvian food in Las Vegas or dining at a place that my family hasn't been at this was my opportunity to be first in our family to review a place. The restaurant is clean, with booths featuring intimate lighting. Flatscreen TV's show the latest soccer games but aren't intrusive to the experience. We ordered the standards: Papa a la Huancaina, Anticuchos, Ceviche de Pescado, Palta Rellena and Lomo Saltado. We washed it down with a classic Inka Cola and Chicha Morada. The service was very good, attentive without being intrusive. When we ordered, our waitress asked what order we'd like our food to come out indicating that some items are immediate while others would take a little time to prepare - I suggested that she being the orders out as they became ready. Fresh, well seasoned Ceviche was first. Tangy and spicy with sweet potato and giant yellow corn kernels (not hominy) accompanied it. Next, it was the vegan Palta Rellena, a corn, peas, and tomato stuffed avocado w/ a garlic aioli followed by sizzling iron plates of Anticuchos accompanied by grilled Yucca. We were very satisfied with the freshness, texture, presentation and taste of all of our dishes. We took the Lomo Saltado home and thoroughly enjoyed it later in our hotel room. My son, who was skeptical about eating here was most pleased and gives this place a 4/5 stars. I concur. I am an American born Peruvian who has had the pleasure of having a family who regularly makes and serves all the traditional and esoteric Peruvian dishes.",XYQirrgPOYpq1-AIWmv56Q,0,0,4,g2yhR0eeWY27Gcf3ZBqqxg

Peruvian food is influenced by Japanese cuisine, so don't expect the food to lean really Spanish here. 

I ordered the pollo saltado. The dish was extremely flavorful with the soy sauce emanating through. Some might find the chicken to be a bit dry, but it reminded me of the stir fried chicken in Thai food. Even the rice was buttery and perfect. My favorite part was the French fries soaking in the sauce on the bottom of the plate.

The service is very friendly here. The waiter can offer you an iPad with images of all the food, if you're more visual. The owner is also the chef.

My husband and I stopped in for lunch, and the large restaurant was nearly empty. Our friendly server brought us a bowl of salted corn kernels (like naked Corn Nuts) and when we told her we were new customers, she brought out a tablet to show us pictures of the various dishes. (Although the menu was fairly descriptive, the images helped to show the differences between the seafood preparations.)

For appetizers, we split papa a la Huanciana (boiled potatoes in yellow pepper cream sauce) and palta relleÃ±a (avocado stuffed with potatoes, mayonnaise, and chicken), two traditional cold dishes that seemed like something you'd eat at a picnic. They were both great on their own but even better with the spicy garlic-pepper sauce that our server provided.

For our entrees, I had the lomo saltado (stir-fried rib-eye strips with tomatoes, peppers, and onions, served with sides of french fries and white rice). This, too, is a traditional Peruvian dish, but it didn't stand out to me; I almost felt like I was in Hawaii with all the starchy sides! My husband fared much better with the tacu tacu con mariscos (mixed seafood with fish sauce served with a fried rice and bean patty). We're usually not big fans of octopus or squid, but the sauce was fantastic, and the side dish was a tasty addition.

They don't serve alcohol, so I had an Inca Kola, which was like a golden cream soda, and my husband had the Kola Inglesa, which tasted a lot like Big Red. We both preferred the Inca Kola, and while it was pretty sweet, that's something I would try again.

I read that Peruvian food has lots of Asian influences, and that was certainly the case here, from the soy sauce in the beef dish to the fish sauce in the seafood. And these Latin American flavors reminded me more of Cuban food than traditional Mexican. Portions were large but a bit pricey for lunch, so next time I think I'll stick with the appetizers (and maybe split an entree); there are plenty of options that I'd love to try.

The restaurant has a cute yellow and green logo that appears on their sign and their business cards. It's too bad the interior of the building looks like a '50s diner (red, white, and chrome); it would look so much better with the same theme inside. 

Although our server was friendly and helpful, service was a little slow. We had to ask for water several times, and it took a while to get our bill. But if you have time for a leisurely meal and want to try something out of the ordinary, Lima Limon is worth a visit.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,0,4,dZ32XA7x7CLGCZ23SK3-ow

I'm not sure why whoever opened this restaurant to sell Peruvian food and didn't bother to remodel he interior. Even just painting the red portions of the walls and trim to yellow or green, to match the logo on their business cards, would be a huge step up and be more cohesive and on theme.

Finally got my food and headed home, hoping the lack of Peruvian influence in the dÃ©cor was not going to be repeated in the kitchen. But I was at least partially surprised by the quality of the food: the lomo saltado was a plentiful portion (thankfully, as the pricetag was $14) with peppers, onions, and steak strips over an overwhelming portion of fries, served alongside white rice. The rice actually, was very good. Despite not appearing to have any seasoning, it was flavorful and moist without being ""wet"". Loved using it to soak up the extra juices from the steak and onion sautÃ©. However, I do agree with other reviews that say that the steak could have been more tender.
The stuffed avocado was perhaps the most underwhelming Peruvian dish I've ever paid $7 for. The avocado was not even ripe, and the mashed potato, chicken, and mayo mixture was bland and homogenous to the point where I could not find chicken in the dish. Not sure how or why this is so highly recommended in other reviews, maybe it was just an off day.

Side note: the creamy-looking red salsa sauce they have is surprisingly flavorful.. and has quite a bit of kick to it! Definitely get it but use it sparingly until you figure out if you can take the heat.

1734781,2013-06-16,0,AUOlDSQ8R2wIkN4lQ4kVDg,"Let me preface my review by saying I have never had Peruvian food before, so unfortunately, I can't comment on the authenticity of the food. 

This restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend claiming it was the best Peruvian food in Vegas and so my boyfriend and I decided we would check it out. The location is a little unappealing - although very easy to get to, it's in quite a deserted strip mall, so there's not much activity happening there otherwise. Once inside, we were greeted by a friendly server in Spanish and immediately seated. We arrived at around 7:30 p.m. and there were about 2-3 other groups of people dining at that time. The interior resembled an old 50s diner with upgraded light fixtures. Also, interestingly, the entertainment comprised of Jackass on MTV, which we felt was a tad bit inappropriate for a family/dining establishment (about halfway through our meal, it was changed to ""I Love You Man"" on Comedy Central, an improvement but still questionable).

The menu was simple and consisted of appetizers, entrees (chicken, beef, and seafood), dessert and beverages. We had the maracuya (a passion fruit drink which we thought it tasted like guava/guayaba) and chicha morada (although a corn drink, we thought it tasted like a chai tea or horchata - really, the cinnamon was the overpowering flavor). These drinks were $2 a cup (no free refills) and otherwise they had regular fountain drinks available.

Our order initially consisted of the palta rellena, arroz chaufa, and pescado a lo macho. Again, never having had Peruvian food, we had no idea what to expect and merely went by recommendations provided from other reviews. The server came back to let us know that they were out of the palta rellena and recommended we try the tiradito de pescado as an appetizer instead. Although I was really looking forward to the palta rellena (avocado stuffed with cooked potatoes, mayonnaise, and cooked chicken), the fish strips bathed in yellow pepper lemon sauce were surprisingly delightful - something to note was that the fish and sauce are cold, I was expecting that they would be warm. The arroz chaufa was merely chicken fried rice, with a slightly different flavor than what you would expect at any traditional Asian restaurant. The menu description for pescado a lo macho was fried fish topped with Peruvian fish sauce and served with white rice - there were some additional seafood items included with the fish sauce and fried fish, such as calamari, octopus, oyster, and shrimp - that being said, the dish was probably the most delicious of the two entrees. To end, we had the crema volteada, which is essentially like a flan but made with milk and is therefore a lot thicker in substance. 

Overall, we thought the server was very friendly and attentive and the food was tasty, but I gave it a 4-star rating since the atmosphere was a little off. I would definitely come back and try something else (including that palta rellena) someday!",6N8scdRhsaGLZxvqriE7iw,3,2,4,ANe0sYmWWqXve9InXnCR2A

So my recommendation is to split plates because portions are positively huge! Food is delicious though and you'll be happy with this Las Vegas outpost of Peruvian food.

Not located in the best location, the plaza seemed very empty and old, but the restaurant itself was very nice, clean, and big. The place is big enough for large parties. We came in at a pretty slow time, only a few tables the entire time we were there. We were greeted and seated immediately, our waitress brought out water and a small plate of dried corn with salt, this was very different and pretty good. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet, she answered all our questions and made good recommendations. Great service! 

I tried the sweet corn drink with pineapple juice and passion fruit, this tasted like hibiscus tea with a pinch of cinnamon. My sister tried one of the two peruvian sodas that they carry, we asked our waitress what the soda tasted like before we ordered and she said guests said the soda either tasted like lemongrass or chewing gum :) my sister said it smelled and tasted like chewing gum, but she liked it.

We ordred grilled beef heart and a mixed seafood ceviche for appetizer. The beef heart was not as tender as I hoped it would be, but the seasoning was delicious, it also came with two big pieces of grilled potato that was perfectly grilled, not too hard and not too soft. The ceviche had sliced fish, mussel, shrimp and octopus, it also came with sweet potato and corn, it was very good but a little too sour for my taste. 

For the main entree we shared a beef stir fried with minions and tomatoes, it came with rice and fried. Our waitress recommended this plate stating it is their most popular dish. This was delicious, the meat was very tender, the fries were crispy, and the sauce was really, not too salty. The portion here is quite big, I would recommend sharing, the entrees are definitely gigantic.

The chef does a great job with pastas. I always order tallarines verdes (creamy pesto) or tallarines a la Huancaina, accompanied by a large cutlet of chicken or beef that my husband enjoys for me (the perks of marrying a vegetarian). The arroz chaufa (fried rice) has great flavor, too. Lima Limon is one of my top choices for a weekday lunch because of the specials offered from 11am to 3pm. The menu changes each day, but a starter such as ceviche plus an entree like arroz con pollo served with a beverage for $8.50 is an unbelievable deal.

My only complaint about the service would be that it took forever to get refills, and we only got them because we directly asked! This needs to be worked on by the staff. Sitting with empty drinks for 10 minutes halfway through our meal is really unacceptable. 

The food makes up for this blunder, however. We split the seafood platter and lomo saltado, and of course, the homemade corn nuts. The corn nuts were a delicious appetizer that wasn't as filling as bread normally is, which I appreciated. The seafood platter was fresh and overflowing with seafood goodness. For the price, it cannot be beaten! This was the dish that truly impressed my partner. We will certainly be back just for this. While I love seafood, this platter is a little too much for me personally, so the lomo saltado was a perfect second choice! It is simple, but I am into simple food. 

We liked what we tried so much, odds are when we return we will get the same things again! Except for the Peruvian beverage, I can't remember what it is called, but I wasn't a huge fan. I'll stick with diet coke!",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,4,2,5,eRFwRKopJ4w1kLAxkZgXMw

I'm not sure what the waitress's name was but my girlfriend and I met my mom and her boyfriend around 5:45 for dinner so whoever was working at that time...

I've noticed that even though the food at this place is amazing, it's never really that full. In fact, every time I'm there there's maybe only two/three other parties seated. This time when we arrived there was only one other table and so the fact that it took 15 minutes for us to be asked what we'd like to drink kind of surprised me. And when it took 10 minutes for my glass of water to arrive it irked me even more that the waitress completely forgot what my GF had asked for. I feel like this is why you should write it down if you need to. Not to mention this woman had THEE worst attitude I have EVER seen in a waitress before. 

When my mom and her BF arrived she took their drink order and this woman was just so short with us as if we were inconveniencing her. When looking through the menu we had questions and she'd walk by our table to fast that we never had a chance to ask her anything at all. Finally she takes our order and while my GF is ordering I'm talking to my mom and suddenly this waitress just pulls the menu from under my mom's elbows and that was enough for me to be completely over this place. Say excuse me, have some manners. That's my MOTHER and more than that, that's a LOYAL, PAYING customer. Finally when we get our food and we're all taking our time eating the waitress comes and just takes my mom's plate and my mom looks at her and says, in a very confused tone, ""I'm not done..."" and the waitress says nothing and puts her plate back, then walks away. 

The food is amazing - don't get me wrong. I attached photos of what we all ate yesterday, but the service was so stupidly terrible that I doubt I'll come back to this place and if I do, I will walk right back out if this woman serves me again.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,4,1,3,QU69bqtxyfDauYDA-rxXKQ

I've been here numerous times and order the same thing all the time. Lomo saltado!!! It's a thin pieces of beef cooked with onions, peppers, tomatoes and cilantro. They throw in French fries in the mix to soak up some of the juices. (I do wish that they would use the steak cut fries instead of normal fries, but thats just me). All served with a side of rice!! So so yummy. Tender cuts of meat cooked and seasoned perfectly. Only down side is that they don't serve the green sauce that is a staple in other Peruvian restaurants. They do offer a red hot sauce if you are looking for the extra kick. 

If you are in the area. I highly recommend this place. The waiters are super sweet and attentive.

I have to call in the morning because they gave us pork instead of the beef hearts we bought and paid for. Do they think we don't know what beef heart is supposed to look and taste like?? 
They had no seafood left because it was close to the end of the night. They should be prepared for their Sunday nights and basically ALL hours of operation.  
Also they had NO sauces. We spent over $100 for this food and we're extremely let down. We will be calling tomorrow for the food we ordered since they closed already tonight. 

This used to be my favorite place as it's the only Peruvian restaurant that's good in Vegas. But damn, they need to seriously manage this place better.

They use an iPad as their menu, which is a great way to see pics of their food and get a feel for the portion size. Our waitress was extremely helpful and patient, I highly suggest getting the calamari appetizer and their in-house mayo. I had asked her which of the specialty drinks she preferred (I can't think of the names now, but one was passion fruit flavored and the other one was more cinnamon) and she actually offered samples of the drinks. And there weren't tiny cups, she filled up 1/3 of a regular cup and let us taste it. Both had really distinct and strong flavors that paired well with our meal, so definitely order a specialty drink when you're here. I ended up with the lomo saltado as an entree - I wish the meat was a little bit more tender, but still, good flavors and portions.

I ordered the Pollo Saltado and I was interestingly surprised. The white rice parsley and vegetable stir-fry mixed with the chicken was the perfect meal for me.

The waitress then comes and asks what we want & I have to tell her we still haven't gotten menus.

The restaurant was not at all busy at 12:45 with just one other table occupied.  I was greeted and seated quickly and I ordered a chicha morada for my drink.  I have come to like this drink a lot and look forward to Peruvian restaurants to enjoy more.  With the drink, my server brought a complimentary small bowl of cancha, the first time I've gotten this at any of the Peruvian places to which I've been.  They're salty and nicely crunchy and they go so well with the chicha morada.  

My server asked me if I was familiar with Peruvian food and she had a tablet with photos that you could scroll through and pick out dishes.  I told her I knew what I wanted just as she was pressing the lomo saltado image.  

In a short time, she brought the dish to me along with three sauces, green and red aji (both are spicy hot--test before you overdo something.  I preferred the green aji.  Neither one was too hot for me.  I tasted the white, mayo-based sauce and it was too mild.  

The lomo saltado was very good.  The beef was tender and the vegetables with the beef were not cooked too much.  The onion and pepper slices had crunch to them and the tomatoes were just warmed through.  The rice was flavorful--the fries were standard.  

When my server asked me about dessert, she said all they had were alfajores and flan.  I've had enough flan so I ordered an alfajor.  She informed me they only sell them in boxes of eight.  I ordered the box knowing I could have one or two--or maybe three--and I could take the rest home.  When she brought the plastic box, I asked if they were made in house as they were different from the larger ones I've had before.  She said they were indeed made there.  These soft cookies are filled with tasty dulce de leche and then liberally dusted with confectioners' sugar.  They were excellent!  It's lucky any came home with me but five of them did.

I am a fan of Lima Limon and I'll be back to try some of their other dishes.  The ceviches look very enticing!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,11,4,sYU8_3Jdd62SqkoHdXwOUA

-Piqueo Lima Limon ($40) - My family ordered this because we wanted to have a little sampler of different types of Peruvian food.  It comes with choritos (mussels), huancaina (potatoes smothered in sauce), fried calamari, ceviche, and arroz con Mariscos (seafood rice).  This was definitely a good way to try a little bit of everything.  The stand outs of the dish were the ceviche, fried calamari, and the arroz con Mariscos.  
-Lomo Saltado ($12.50) - Similar to an Asian beef stir fry, the dish was pretty flavorful and the fries served with it were pretty good too.  Didn't wow me enough to want to order it again though.
-Arroz con Mariscos ($15) - My family didn't realize that this already came with the above dish (whoops), it was still good though full of mussels, squid, and shrimp! 

All of the dishes I had here were good/solid, but for some reason I just didn't find myself wowed by this place.  However, I definitely do see myself coming back here to try out different dishes on the menu whenever I am in the mood for Peruvian food.",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,1,1,3,HQaGKYfdIS8VUmWHSr3l5w

(!!!Attencion-Peor servicio en mi vida!!!!
traducion de esta fonda que se hace pasar por resturante hasta abajo)

Decided to come with a large party of 13 on a family members suggestion. (worst mistake ever). It was a birthday celebration that turned into a dinner nightmare.

Lets start,  Amilcar the server was polite but lacked the most basic serving skills.
Restaurant (more like a shack) was busy but not enough to justify the cardinal mistakes he made all night.

From the start we had to arrange our own table as they were to busy to areange larger table for party (should have left then and there).
Also asked for highchairs and 30 minutes passed until i went looking for them and found 2 in a corner.

Party arrived around 7 pm, no server for about 1 hour...
No drinks while waiting (not even water)!

Around 9pm  food  arrives for half the table as it was pre prepared. (ceviche)
Half the table starts eating..... but

2 problems !!!!
No drinks still not even water !!! (placed order 40 min earlier)
No silverware to eat or napkins!

Finally server arrives with like half the places silverware from dishwasher, and they are still wet! (disgusting, looked rinsed not washed)

As half the party starts to eat, the remaining plates come out about 20 minutes apart each from one abother. 

We decide to start sharing food, as everyone is starving and turn our food into tapas style.

Finally we finish eating and realize the Birthday Girl has yet to get her food along with another person in the party!!!! ( 3 hours later)

And we are all done eating... WTF????
They apologize and said they had a mistake.

The whole night we never got water!!
No one did!

We were able to place one drink order that arrived at 9pm.


I immediatly placed another one. 
Did not arrive until 10pm...


I guess you can say the food was ok.
not bad, good flavor. But not worth it. Ever

We spend over $500 and I feel robbed...
any sushi Ayce is better, cheaper and 5x more delicious.

Only bring enemies and foes to eat here,
as you would never want a loved one to experience this dinning experience.

Thanks

Este lugar no es restaurante, es una fonda!!
No tienen host, busser o bartender.
El mesero que tiened Amilcar, aunque amable es un pesimo mesero. 

La comida esta buena, pero el servicio fue el peor en toda mi vida. (no estoy exagerando)

Si usted quiere esperar por 3 horas sin recibir algo de tomar este es su lugar.

La cumpleaÃ±era nunca recibio su comida. despues de 3 horas y media. 

Se les olvido el plato de la cumpleÃ±era y de otra persona aunque ya habian pasado mas de 3 horas!!!

Trajieron comida separada por mas de una hora. Aunque todos ordenamos al mismo tiempo.

Decidimos compartir ya que llevavamos horas esperando, comimos ceviche como si fuera tapas espaÃ±ola ya que nadamas la mitad de gente tenia comida y nadie cubiertos.

Cosas que nunca llegaron!
Agua! Nadie por 3 horas nos dio agua.
Pisco sour- bueno este si llego pero tardo 2 horas. Nunca llegaron mas aunque pedimos mas immediatamente!!!
Servilletas- tuve que robar de otra mesa 
Cubiertos- bueno tambien llegaron pero mojados semi lavados y 10 minutos despues de la comida...... (en serio)

Por esas razones Amilcar es un pesimo mesero, no se donde se escondia ya que no estaba muy lleno. 

Pagamos mas de $500 y me siento estafado.

Hagase un favor y escoja un restaurante si quiere salir a comer, no esta choza, ya que lo va dejar con sabor amargo en la boca. No vale la pena la comida. 

Hay 1000s de lugares en Las Vegas con Mejor servicio y comida, cualquier buffet seria mejor. Y mucho menos, y sirven agua.

Y nunca vaya a este lugar con un grupo y mucho menos en occasion especiales!!!

Vaya nadamas cuando quiera sentirse menos preciado o con alguien que no le agrade.
Este es su lugar.

4451455,2014-04-11,1,AUOlDSQ8R2wIkN4lQ4kVDg,"Lima Limon sits in a desolate shopping center off of Decatur Blvd. It is next door to a Port of Subs. You will see the bright yellow/green sign and then enter into what is definitely 1950s diner vibe. Not sure what that is about - but maybe they are just waiting to revamp.

Service was exceptionally nice. I believe this place is definitely a mom-n-pop place as the waiter took great pride in talking to myself and my co-worker about the types of food, how it is made, etc. He even brought out an iPad so we could scroll through and see what the dishes looked like before we ordered.

I've never had Peruvian food before. The menu is straight and to the point. Most meals are simple: a meat, a carb, and a few veggies. In fact, some dishes come with both fries AND rice. It is somewhat reminiscent to me, of Hawaiian food, that comes with macaroni salad AND rice. However, Peruvian food obviously has an Asian-influence as I could distinctly taste soy sauce, and the ""pasta"" that came with my dish was very much like noodles you may find in an Asian dish.

I ordered the Tallarines Saltado with chicken. This is a BIG dish of food. Noodles were cooked perfectly, and chicken was good. Very few vegetables though - I thought I would get more tomatoes, but there were only two in my dish. Overall, the meal was good, but not great. Not sure if this is just because of the Peruvian dish itself - or the restaurant.

I would like to try Peruvian food elsewhere to see how it compares. For now, an A-OK will do.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,7,3,3,Ql_8UBHVRIHQDipf9qAe1Q

4484471,2016-01-31,7,AUOlDSQ8R2wIkN4lQ4kVDg,"Having traveled to Peru, I was itching to re-try that famous Peruvian dish - cuy, a guinea pig roasted in a wood-burning fireplace.  Nah, that's a blatant lie.  I'll try most anything, but not when they raise those adorable pets directly across from the ovens in cute little piggie cottages.  They don't serve cuy here, nor do they serve alpaca, which I did try in Peru (it's good, and no, it doesn't taste like chicken).  But some woolly llamas (or alpacas, can't tell 'em apart) do grace the entrance, albeit the imitation sort).

But what they do serve is good, and much of it is reminiscent of Alberto Fujimoro's one-time tenancy as Peru's president - soy sauce in many of the dishes.  Like the Tallarines Salteados con Pollo my hubby ordered - what seemed like a pound of spaghetti in a tasty and soy-driven sauce, with lots of sauteed onions and chicken strips.

We had called to find out if they served wine and beer, and the answer was affirmative.  Turns out they had exactly two wines, both from Peru - a rose and a red.  Rose is usually way too dry for me, but our waitress, Patricia, obligingly offered a taste.  It was my kind of wine, and more like a white zin, so I ordered a glass.  It was $7, and a good-sized pour.  

We had fried yuca and plÃ¡tanos for starters, and the yuca was accompanied by a very spicy red sauce and slightly less spicy green sauce.  The plÃ¡tanos were the ripened ones, but definitely less sweet than usual.  That was a good thing.

My choice was the fish in shrimp sauce.  The menu said fried, but I had already far exceeded my fried food quotient, starting with the fried Peruvian corn nuggets that were comped at the beginning, then refreshed when my wine was served.  They're addictive, and it's too bad that CÃ¡rdenas Market right across the street was already closed when we left the restaurant and tried to stock up on them.  Or maybe that's good ;)

Ordering my fish grilled was no problem; the two fillets were covered with a delicious - but a little too salty - sauce whose ingredients were a mystery, and that was adorned with an ample supply of shrimp.  A mound of white rice accompanied the fish, which was tilapia.  Tomorrow I'll enjoy the other half of the fish and shrimp and all of the rice, while hubby slurps up the other half-pound of his noodles and chicken.  Just to say I've cooked, I'll make a salad to add to my favorite meal:  leftovers.

With excellent and friendly service, Jesus C. singing on the middle-sized TV, a big glass of wine, a comfortable atmosphere, a very good meal, and the opportunity to practice my getting-rusty-quickly Spanish, I was a happy and fulfilled camper.  Oh, and for the gringos, Patricia speaks English just fine.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,10,8,4,pYyD_Bh2i98HD8ZpzR_bJg

That, and the fact that I was already rather satisfied from the tasty appetizers. My wife enjoyed a classic chicken dish that had red onions white rice and french fries with it and was pretty flavorful, so of course I nibbled on that.

Ceviche peruano / mixto -lemony, creamy, and has mixed seafood with a perfect soft texture. Comes w boiled potatoes
Lomo saltatado -typical Chinese-Peruvian fusion dish. Similar to steak stir fry with French fries, bell pepper, onion, white rice and a sweet soy & garlic sauce. 
TallarÃ­n verde con bistek-Al dente fettuccine with a creamy, salty spinach pesto sauce and steak cooked how you like.

The lomo saltado with tacu tacu was pretty good as well. The only thing is that I am used to eating lomo saltado where the meat is cooked medium rare. This one was well done and a bit tough. The flavors were there but I just wish it has been a bit more tender. The tacu tacu though was very good.

The menu was expansive, and we chose arroz con mariscos and lomo saltado based on good reviews from yelp. The food had a lot of Asian influence, and while it tasted decent, just a bit bland. We both didn't really understand the hype for this place. The arroz con mariscos tasted similar to jambalaya, and the lomo saltado was like beef fajitas, except there were fries too. 

The restaurant itself was simple in its decoration, it felt like a diner more than anything. I thought the price was a bit too expensive, at around $15 an entree.",uU2B1vrqkpWJI30xoooabw,0,0,3,Ut9C-6RyiRrOvFB9We9byg

5048476,2013-04-07,0,AUOlDSQ8R2wIkN4lQ4kVDg,"When I was about 13, Lomo Saltado was a sick, sick obsession of mine. I used to eat it at least once a week and then I burned out on it, but lately I've been craving for it again. I've had this bookmarked the moment it went on Yelp. I love peruvian food...it's like the odd baby of South American flavors I like and Asian food (Chinese immigrant influence to the country). Hooray, rice!. 

We were given some crispy homemade cornuts (cancha) to snack on while we wait and some spicy aji to dip....it was pink, which I've never had before, I've always had the usual green. 

Lomo Saltado - pretty solid lomo! Yay! The beef was pretty tender which is the make or break point since really it's a pretty easy dish to make. Ask for a bit of lime to squeeze on and I used some of the aji on it which is how I've always eaten it. 

We wanted to get the lima limon chicken but they were out of the sauce so we asked what was popular and went with one of the recommended dishes.

Arroz con Mariscos -  The rice was seasoned well  and it was plentiful of seafood. The only thing I didn't like about it was the mussels had a strong flavor, but the seafood all were cooked right. I think I prefer just octopus and shrimp in my arroz than a whole mix, personal preference I guess. 
Portions here are pretty sizeable so for the $12ish each of these entrees cost, they were rather large. 

Instead of getting just coke, grab one of the specialty drinks if you can. We got some of the marucuya (passionfruit) and that was pretty refreshing.... You can buy by cup or pitcher and we should have gotten a pitcher. 

Service was pretty decent. I've seen the reviews about some servers not really being attentive, but our guy server checked  up on us a few times throughout eating to see if we needed anything. This is a positive change and thankful as the food is pretty good.

Just a note you can't see if from the stree when you're driving, but you'll see a Catherines Plus Sized store and Red Lobster. If you're here on a weekday before 3, also ask about lunch specials!

* No bussing staff means the dining room is constantly trashed with dirty dishes on most tables

5390395,2013-02-20,3,AUOlDSQ8R2wIkN4lQ4kVDg,"Lima Limon was popping up when I was delving deep into Yelp looking for lunch options.  A factoid about myself that might very well scare some of you dearly is that I, on extremely indecisive days, can sometimes spend 10s of minutes just scouring the search results of Yelp looking for that new place to try, sometimes ending up 20 pages in without still being able to decide.  

I'd ended up on Lima Limon's yelp page a few times, but they sure don't make it easy to make a call in order.  I couldn't find ANY menu presence online, as they don't appear to have an official site, and none were uploaded to Yelp.  I ended up on their facebook where they sometimes post pictures of specials, but again I couldn't see anything definitive as far as a menu.  I decided to do something I've never done in my life, I basically cold called them and practically asked them to decide for me what to get.  The girl who answered was friendly, though she did seem a little dumbfounded at my request (naturally).   I believe she asked if I liked chicken, and I said yes, and then I asked if there was any cream or butter or milk in the preparation, and the next thing I know she mentioned something about seafood and I ended up with a rice with seafood (arroz con marisco) dish on order.  I asked if they had iced tea which is my norm and she brought up some specialty peruvian drinks.   Sure why not.   Off I went to collect both food and drink of which I had no idea what I was getting.   If this were a movie my heart would be pounding out of my chest while the protagonist was driving to the restaurant.  Since it was real life and I have no emotions I was fine.

When I arrived I perused a take out menu which I was nice enough to take some crappy pics of and upload here so you can have somewhat of an easier time ordering if you choose to do so.   I went straight for the descriptions of the drinks to figure out what I might be getting.  There were two options, one passion fruit based and the other sweet corn and pineapple based.  I love passion fruit so I assumed I was getting the pineapple and sweet corn drink (which they had just finished pouring).   I asked and they confirmed in a friendly manner.

I didnt even bother looking at the food before heading back to the office.  When I got back and finally opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by how it looked,smelled, and ultimately tasted.  It was a rice dish mixed with a lot of various pieces of seafood (shrimp, mussels, calamari) and veggies all mixed in a nice sauce that provided reddish/orange hue.  It had a bit of a kick which was nice, and the flavors were magnificent.  I devoured the whole thing quicker than it takes me to figure out what I'm going to eat daily.

The drink turned out better than I'd imagined, though it was very sweet which I'm usually not a fan of.   I probably wouldn't order it again though I wouldnt mind trying the passion fruit one at another time.

Overall, don't let the lack of web presence Lima Limon has prevent you from trying it, there's clearly some good flavors coming out of there.   For me it certainly deserves further investigation, and now I have a powerful takeout menu handy.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,6,3,4,zoHy8F9SIu6fey5wiu8AYA

We were driving down Decatur and heading towards Cardenas when we saw a small sign for Lima Limon.  While sitting at the light I quickly Yelp'd Lima Limon.   It has some great reviews so we pulled in to the parking lot.  At first glance, this is not someplace you'd drive by and decide to eat.  The Target that was previously in this lot is closed and this strip mall is not the most inviting place.

Upon entering I wasn't sure that we made the right decision.  The place looked rather old and the booths are super uncomfortable.  I felt like the waitress turned on the lights just for us as we walked in.  However, she was very nice and attentive.  Until she got busy.  They could use another front of the house staff member.

We ordered Ceviche, Pollo Saltado and Lomo Saltado.
The Ceviche was awesome. Be prepared that the fish is in large chunks but so very tasty!!

Pollo Saltadao and Lomo Saltado were SOOOOO DELICIOUS.  Hubby cleaned his plate!!  Make sure to get their pinkish/red salsa.  It's got a kick to it so test it out first...  but it's absolutely amazing.

On the way out the door we bought a box of home made Alfajores.  Aflajores are my favorites Peruvian shortbread cookies with caramel so I couldn't wait to try them.   I got home and opened up the box...  the cookies are delicious.  The shortbread was a little lighter than what I'm used to for the cookie but I will definitely get these again.

We stick to the same things every time for dinner: The Ceviche Mixto-it has the familiar tangy and fresh flavor of your traditional ceviche with lots of seafood in it, but this is kicked up a few notches. It's spicier b/c of the chilies they use and more garlicky and it had a few surprises in there too-sweet potatoes and Inca Corn! The Loma Saltado-is a flavor packed stir fry ( not the Chinese kind) of onions, tender beef strips, yellow peppers and tomatoes in a salty sauce that makes you want to lick the plate clean. That's over top a bed of refried beans and it so good to mash them into that sauce. We also get a side of fried plantains that have a slight sweetness and act as a perfect palate cleanser.

The dilemma...the gang at work will not be pleased to learn that two of us couldn't resist the temptation to take a test drive, without them.  Shhhhh...Hopefully, they won't find out.  I keep telling them to jump up on Yelp, this is why lol.  

I read a previous review about how a Yelper put in a phone order and left unhappy with an empty stomach, swearing she would never return.  This game we play is an emotional one indeed.  Although, like movie reviews, I think we can't let others comments derail us without having tried it for ourselves.  Remember, chefs & staff are people too, and bound to make mistakes.  I wonder if this Yelper ever allowed the staff an opportunity to remedy free situation.  But that's neither here nor there.

Anyhow, we were pressed for time and had to eat with the quickness and by this time had 45 minutes left.  I opted for the mainstay dish, lomo saltado, another for a trainee and a fried shrimp calamari plate.  I was concerned with how long it would take, 40 remaining...and counting.  Nothin to do but sit, wait and analyze the decor that reminded me of an old school diner/karaoke/dance/buy-me-drinkee bar...for those of you that don't know, Google it!

The homie decided to bounce after ordering to get gas in the interim.  Surprisingly, by the time he returned, out came the dishes!  37 minutes to spare...but bad for two full size entrees and a hefty appetizer.  I usually wait for all parties before I start eating, in respect, but this was an exception and dived in while my patnah was in decontamination from the petro mission.

7 minutes later, the lomo was no-mo!  Although it was very similar to chop steak, it was tender and flavorful with a unique sweet soy sauce line taste with a hint of tang.  With 30 minutes to spare, I was more than satisfied with the outing.  Got full, got back to work and ninja mission accomplished.  I will mos def be back with the rest of the unit, fighting the urge to tell them what we tried today since we gotta keep it on the hush.

I'm a regular at ""Las Americas"", ""Don Beto"" and ""Mi Peru"" - all of which are respectable establishments in their own merit. However, when news came through that a small, family-run restaurant was being born; I was forced to visit.

Upon first arrival I noticed a minor lacking of decoration, which is understandable as they have only recently opened. Their seating arrangement is comfortable, taking advantage of the large space provided, without seeming too empty. If I had not known this was a Peruvian restaurant, I would've thunk this was a 60's style diner! Not a bad thing, just unexpected.

A kind and familiar face welcomed us and led us to our thrones. Quickly, she brought our drinks and a small bowl of Peruvian Fried Corn, a tradition. The Menu seemed rather unintuitive, featuring a handful of classic dishes, but missing some too. More than anything, the restaurant's young age is seen in various ways. I firmly believe that through hard work and perseverance, their experiences will come with time.

I'm not one to order several dishes, but I had been craving a good ol' Peruvian meal for awhile, so my comrade and I decided on 5 dishes. A breeze of onion signalled the arrival of the ""Choritos a la Chalaca"" - which were good enough. The choritos didn't feel overly fresh, but the onion relish topping was fantastic - helping cover up any mishaps caused by the choritos. Completely understandable seeing as we're in the middle of the desert, a beautiful one at that. 

Before we could finish enjoying our choritos, a heaping plate of ""Chicharron de Calamar"" made its way to our table and hearts. We were won over by the light yet crispy coating which made these feel like small pillows from heaven. Flavorful yet not over the top. A house specialty!

As mentioned earlier, my main motivation came at the hands of the sivichi; I was slightly surprised after having been underwhelmed at other similar restaurants. The fish was cut well and the seasonings were just right. This took me back to the innocent days as a kid, sitting on Peruvian shores enjoying this same dish. Nostalgic.

To top it all off, I decided to splurge and give the ""Anticuchos"" a shot. Boy was I happy I did! Their flavor profile was spot-on, although they could've been cut a tad thinner, just personal preference.

All in all, I'm very pleased with the whole experience. Friendly staff, flavorful dishes and reasonable prices. There is great potential in this establishment and I hope to be there years from now when this is a booming part of the Las Vegas economy.",G_bJdUPCnL1x6dvRhyHNyw,10,3,4,q04ihhYgibtHxp63fiwYaQ

I cant wait to go back!!!",VAf7_1p7JLM3SooDdeFtxQ,0,0,5,vFeOHPWs3j4lKeJWVKtTZg

When my daughter and I walked in, the place is clean and modern. Instantly, you feel a very authentic Peruvian vibe. They were playing Peruvian music and the tv was set to Univision. It actually brought me back to younger years when I lived in South Florida, with such a strong Latin culture, where this music would be fully appreciated! Significantly unlike any other restaurant you will visit in Vegas. 

When we ordered the food - papa la huancaina, ceviche de pescado & lomo saltado, dear God I thought we died and went to heaven. Being Peruvian myself and having grown up with traditional home cooked Peruvian food, my standards are REALLY high. Not only did the food taste like my parents made it, but when I asked the server if they used GMOs or organics, he said that they used organic. Clearly, that is not verified at this time. However, the food was so savory and heavenly, I wouldn't doubt if it was organic. 

I don't remember ever going to a restaurant where the food tasted this completely amazing... ever! And I've been to some pretty amazing restaurants in my day. If I could give Lima Limon 10 stars, I would. Definitely a MUST. Go check it out for yourself!",KzEHXFjbayCxD12DR8ficA,6,0,5,-zOs1hYaG6SkxlSsMfv4Tg

Our server delivered a small bowl of canchita to munch om. The fried yucca and fish appetizer was a bit dry but we asked for some hot sauces which our friendly server quickly delivered and that helped the dish a lot.  The Lomo Saltado was great with tender strips of steak cooked just right.  The chicken and noodles was also delicious and had a wonderful sauce with a different flavor than I had ever tasted. Dessert was outstanding - a creamy cake that I did not get the name of, but was similar to flan, only better. And Lucuma Ice Cream (our server was kind enough to explain what a lucuma is, even googling a picture for us! And, no, it is not a llama-like animal!)
All in all, this was a very satisfying meal for about $20 a person with soft-drinks, an appetizer and two desserts.
Best of all, it's walking distance from where I live! Sometimes, life is good!",z7XstIeWtS-BAqdrKnr9HA,0,0,4,fLUk5XQUXVOg3FZS8sBlPQ

Different cuisines and chose something off the menu that probably normal Americans wouldn't try. So we chose Lima Limon. And per usual we had to try beef hearts! I was skeptical, but it was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! The server was very patient with us and explained everything the best he could. He even made me homemade lemonade! I can't remember the name of the fish/shrimp dish, but it was SO good! And we had the flan for dessert. OMG. Best I've ever had, and I'm not usually a fan of the stuff.. I had one bite and wanted the whole thing! Definitely will be back. It was a great experience and amazing food.",VDd76GM11DVvK7gKxFtD0g,0,0,5,pFspEyXsSgZF36W5cTcopQ
