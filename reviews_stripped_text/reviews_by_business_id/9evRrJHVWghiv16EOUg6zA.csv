Just asking to switch to a veggie patty took 5 minutes to explain and resulted in the chef having to be put on the line. Really you offer veggie burgers on your menu.../anyways it took forever just to order then it's a $20 order and she wants a credit card over the phone. Ummm I'm driving that's why I'm calling for take out and finally I jus pulled over to give it. Then I show up thinking they must just be busy or something. Nope one couple who already got their food is their. Take over a minute to be greeted while I stand their awkwardly. She says it'll be another 10 minutes so the burger can cook good. Ummm it's a veggie patty. Ok so I wait and wait. Took over 30 minutes for 2 veggie parties. Not even sure if it's good yet I'm late for my appointment now and couldn't eat it in time.

We looked at the menu and pricing online, made a reservation, and show up to a green walled, white table, trendy -looking bistro. The girl at the host station, had us wait for a table, although there were only 4 tables of customers, so she could put together two-4 top tables together for our party of 5 people. Completely unnecessary! The hostess/waitress was not easily understood. Once seated, she disappeared, only to return 10 minutes later, with water. She took our order, then asked what we would like to drink. Again, she disappeared for another 10 minutes, before bringing out our drinks! When our food arrived, only 4 plates were brought to the table. My Salmon Salad, arrived after 5 more minutes. I asked for the Salmon and cheese to be put on the side, but they arrived on the same plate. The Salmon was overcooked, the cheese had no flavor. My daughter ordered a hamburger without peppers, it came out with peppers. When asked if it could be remade, they took it, only to return twice to ask if she wanted to take it to-go! We ordered a Soft pretzel and cheese, only it was 4 small pretzels from the freezer section at the grocery store. The cheese was like warm, no flavor and an unpleasant looking consistency. The fries looked good, but weren't hot, had no flavor, but we're sprinkled with parsley! My husband's eggs were hot but the grave was cold. This experience was so disappointing. When we are paying for good food and service, but this place had neither. Plus the prices that they charged us, did not match the menu online.

4052613,2017-06-03,6,9evRrJHVWghiv16EOUg6zA,"Mountain View Bistro (Cheyenne & Tenaya)

Short Review:
Mountain View Bistro is located in the Target shopping center on Cheyenne and Tenaya. The restaurant opened about 4 months ago and based on the reviews, it's a local favorite. Their menu consists of mainly breakfast and burgers. The establishment is clean and the customer service is fantastic. I recommend the Sunrise Burger. It's simply awesome. 

Longer Review:
I'm so glad that I dined at Mountain View Bistro for lunch. I was craving breakfast and a burger. My decision was down to a favorite fast food joint that rhymes with Sin & Shout and one of the other local breakfast joints in the area. I was parked in front of Mountain View Bistro and out of convenience, decided to check them out. 

There wasn't a single customer here. I had the whole place to myself. One of the employees greeted me, handed me a menu, and gave her recommendations. I told her what I was fiening for, which was either breakfast or a burger. Her response ""how bout both, howbow dah?"" Naw, I'm joking about the ""howbow dah"" part, but she did recommend the Sunrise Burger, which is both breakfast and a burger. The Sunrise Burger is no joke. This is a 1/2 lb. Black Angus burger with eggs, hash browns, two thick slices of bacon, and cheese in a Brioche bun. Keep in mind that everything I just listed is all between the bun. The burger was also complimented with a side seasoned crinkle fries. The burger was work of art and I confess, I was a little intimidated to eat this beast. The burger patty itself is one of the juiciest I've had in a long time. The BAE, cheese, and hash browns made it even better. Craving a burger? Craving breakfast? The Sunrise Burger is a no brainer.  The rest of their menu consists of more burgers and a lot more breakfast eats. And by the way, this restaurant also serves Vegetarian and Vegan burgers. 

Overall, I left Mountain View Bistro very satisfied and extremely full. The service is top notch and their Angus burger is too legit to quit. If there's one concern, it's the fact that this place was completely empty when I dined here. I finally found a delicious local burger close to my office. I hope the traffic increases and business improves. I would hate to lose a good thing. Sunrise Burger!!!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,6,4,i8KR9Bpg2clE_cmGCWyvtQ

Both times..... excellent!
Breakfast..... my hubby had ""Meat Grandma"" Country Fried Steak on Biscuits & topped w/ Country Gravy & Eggs. Served w/ Hash browns. 
My breakfast.....Build your skillet, I chose onions, jalapeno, tomato, and cheddar cheese. It was amazingly fresh and tasty. Jalapeno was the star of the show! Perfect with the cheddar cheese and egg!
Second visit.... lunch....
Hubby got the Sierra Nevada Burger.  Black Angus Chuck Burger topped w/ mixed Greens, Tomato, Red Onions, Applewood Smoked Bacon & Cheddar, he ate it all, quickly!
Me, well my lunch was ""Chachos"". French fries with a four cheese sauce, seasoned ground beef and fresh pico de gallo. Probably not the healthiest lunch I have had, but one of the tastiest for sure.... 
Mountain View Bistro is definitely on the rotation for one of our ""regular spots""",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,24,14,5,_MCka6KIMDu20aU2lwGAWg

It seemed like the person was distracted and when I came to pick it up because they wanted to charge $5 for delivery when yelp says $3.99 I saw the person was on the cell phone as she was ringing me up. You would think if they were so good why is it empty at 1:00?  It took th over 10 min to make a falafel wrap and sweet potato fries, that is too long of a ticket time when the shop is empty.",GBco3mVxeCDix8FHNBW85w,0,0,1,bm9XOT4wBCMPqZhArNCgkQ
4566920,2017-01-30,0,9evRrJHVWghiv16EOUg6zA,Found this place next to the Target I usually go to. Never really paid attention to what was around to eat since it's usually pretty empty. I saw that they opened up a new place but didn't think much of it. I passed by and picked up a menu. I got home and saw that they did delivery. My friend came over that day and we ordered some burgers. The delivery time was pretty quick. I order a cheeseburger with pepper jack cheese and sweet potato fries and my friend got chicken fingers. They were super friendly and fast! My burger was amazing! I ordered it medium and it was perfect. The fries were pretty bomb too. My friend loved her food as well! I will definitely be coming back to this amazing place! It's the best burger that I have had by my area. They have a breakfast menu and I'm definitely coming back for that.,49xkBUeRM0Ii_PiaQMGL_g,1,1,5,uf6nTlyJJ4RvfMzTSYMlVA

Very clean. They have a chicken and waffle selection on the menu but I wanted French toast. I was able to substitute it out so I am happier than ever...the food did not take very long to take which was amazing because I was starving when I came in...it was delicious very well season.

5102324,2017-08-07,9,9evRrJHVWghiv16EOUg6zA,"We came here for breakfast. We were not greeted for a few minutes. There was one family sitting. A lady finally came out from the back to seat us. She seemed very stressed for not really having anyone in the restuarant. 

She didn't take our drink order for about 10 minutes after sitting down. She took our food order at the same time. 
I noticed another couple walking in and standing there forever as well. They ended up just seating themselves. 

We had: The Grandma Meat (really gross name)
And the Eggs and Cakes - the pancakes were okay. I had to ask for syrup. And the eggs were cookes as I asked. 

They were both decent. There wasn't anything to set them apart from Ihop or Denny's. (Your typical cheap breakfast joints.) That is the best thing about this place--it's cheap. 

Overall, it didn't do much for me. It's not high quality food and the wait times are kind of long when they have no one there. The waitress didn't seem to keen on serving people in general.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,24,10,2,LXWQeqsRvyMjq30esw_O9Q

5254587,2017-08-13,0,9evRrJHVWghiv16EOUg6zA,"I had a very pleasant brunch. Our table of 5 was sat immediately. Every single team member was very nice and accommodating. I ordered the crispy chicken wrap with fries. The chicken was crispy and juicy. The aoli sauce was a nice flavor to the wrap. The veggies in the wrap were fresh and tasty. 

We ordered the cinnamon brown sugar biscuits and they were fabulous. 

They brought out the food at a good time and it was nice and hot. The food portions are huge and I had leftovers that I will go back to. I highly recommend trying this place out for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 

It looks like they are set up for all food delivery services and seem busy with them too. 

Our total came to $80 something.

5280907,2017-06-16,0,9evRrJHVWghiv16EOUg6zA,"Found this cool restaurant in the NW area of Las Vegas. I wanted a delicious salad, but not from a chain restaurant. The Mountain View Bistro had a nice selection of salads to choose from. I've tried the blackened salmon salad, which was phenomenal, and the Caesar salad was not to shabby either. Any of their salads can be made into a wrap for an additional charge.

The restaurant has a bright and cheery look to it.
Here you always get service with a smile. Even the cooks are friendly. If you're in the area, be sure to pay them a visit.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,2,2,4,T1QsrjSy6OJdFU_pqNAVKg

We went there for lunch today, and I was thrilled to see a few vegan options, and thus ordered a veggie burger, which was quite tasty.  The tropical iced tea was wonderful, as well.
