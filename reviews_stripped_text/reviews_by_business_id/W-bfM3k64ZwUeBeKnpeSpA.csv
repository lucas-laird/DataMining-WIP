The lady at the register said that it would cost an extra $5. When I came to pick up my order, I received one tofu soup and was told that the other one was on its way out. When I returned to pick up the second soup, the lady at the register shook her head and said that I paid $5 for a larger size for the tofu soup.

700317,2014-09-26,1,W-bfM3k64ZwUeBeKnpeSpA,"I went to this place the other night for three reasons:

1.) One friend said Greenland Foodcourt was so amazing. She doesn't go anywhere else when she eats out since they have everything. 

2.) My other friend raved about this tofu soup. She said it was better than Mr. Tofu because Hot Tofu has super soft tofu. 

3.) I didn't have enough cash for Mr. Tofu. 

I went last night because I craved some noodle soup or some hot soup. I went to Greenland foodcourt which closes at 9:00. I ordered the pork tofu soup since I love pork. The Korean lady asked me if I wanted medium spicy or spicy hot. Now, I love spicy food, but I'm always unsure of spice levels when I go to places for the first time. I picked spicy medium. I also asked for to go. Apparently when you ask for to go, they don't give you an egg. Sad. They did pack the fish, and 3 side dishes which included broccoli, bean sprouts, and kimchi. Their kimchi was very un fermented. I like my kimchi more fermented because than the flavor just tastes bland. 

When I got home, and opened my bag, everything was packaged nicely. My tofu soup had a thin layer of foil covering it making sure my tofu soup did not spill and stayed nice and hot.

Great customer service. The cashier was very helpful, and I watched her carefully package my food. She even made sure to point out where the chopsticks and the spoon were.  She even gave me a take out menu and told me that if I were to call her, she would have everything all ready. She brought out the food to me. 

The reason for the three stars, though. The tofu soup wasn't up to par. It wasn't as good as Mr. Tofu. Mr. Tofu has a way of making delicious tofu soup with  awesome flavor to the broth. I should have gotten the spicier flavor. The tofu did taste delicious. It melted in my mouth. However, I prefer to have a flavorful broth. I'll pick Mr. Tofu any day- even if it is more expensive.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,1,3,qyPKm6d5xaYphA8MoysxRw

First, we ordered the food, but we forget to order a drink so we went back and ordered an iced tea, and the lady at the register asked us if we ere paying with cash, we said no and she didn't tell us there was any charge for a card. So my husband handed his card over to pay. She took it so fast, and swiped the card at the some time she said, you pay card it is $3, and my husband said $3, questions the 0.89$ change!? She said it's OK it's OK, trying to convince us what she did wasn't wrong. the receipt and our bank account showed $3.24 so she Charged us tax on an iced tea. (which is a nontaxable item in NV) I don't care about the fact that there may have been a charge for using a card, but do not fraudulently charge a customer tax when the item is nontaxable. this is fraud. After confronting her in regards to the issue, she continued to say it is OK, and ignored the illegal activities at hand. When pressed, she suddenly could no longer speak English! The issue and transaction have been reported with the IRS for investigation as well as the SNHD! No apology, or sympathy whatsoever, just another person trying to rob the customer blind.

The owner lady told me to just ask ""for salty"" when I order the soup and the cook with make it that way. And be careful when asking for extra, extra spicy.  Mine was so hot that I was sweating with every bite, but it was worth it.  Now I just ask for ""extra spicy"" not extra, extra.  Their bulgogi plate and spicy pork plate are delicious. The galbi ribs are divine but I wish there were more. They make their own kimchi which is AMAZING. I always ask for extra and she tells us to bring our empty dish and gives us more kimchi and sides.

The portions here are large and can easily feed two when you order an extra rice. We are addicted to their food and eat here every time we shop at Greenland market. 

Tip: Ask for extra kimchi. Everything tastes better with more kimchi. ;)

I spotted a little fungi/mold on a piece of meat the last time we went in...if I notice this again...We will have to quit conning here.",4IZxXA8XxeUXEjNf6yZamw,7,3,3,bVJpEMoBA7rC9PLySlhKLQ

My love and I stopped by Greenland to pick up a couple specialty Korean items, but we were hungry after some yoga, didn't want to wait to go home and make something, and so we found ourselves perusing the food court options at the Greenland Market entrance. Hot Tofu was the choice of the evening with a promising Spicy Udon Octopus. As it turned out the Spicy Udon Octopus was a good option, and certainly hit the spot on a cold Winter night. I would order it again if I was in the food court, but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to come here for this Udon on its own. The other dish we shared was a Seafood Soondubu. This dish left me wanting another version down the street, as it was a bit on the bland side.

Hot Tofu is convenient for Greenland shoppers and offers several Korean comfort favorites. Additionally, the banchan was abundant and generally good. Hot Tofu will certainly do the trick if you are in a hurry, but if you have the time head east on Spring Mountain for some more discerning options.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,28,24,3,_QSKA9uDGl6AsR_kYArCdg

Last time I ordered food Togo and she didn't ask me if I got it to go. I returned back after 10 minutes to get my food and saw the food was not packed. I told her I want to take it to go. She said: I asked you and you said you eat here! Seriously! I never said that. Because you didn't even ask me and I didn't even have a chance to open my mouth to talk! Then just put my food in the box which I would be fine! But she gave me a really bad face and made me sit there wait for my food more than 20 minutes. After she packed my food, I saw her throw it on the counter without even calling me over. Instead, she left to the kitchen after she threw my food on the counter. After I came home, I tried side dishes. The Korean squash and bean sprout were way too salty.

2650483,2016-12-08,0,W-bfM3k64ZwUeBeKnpeSpA,"A great place to pick up a to-go order of soondubu (spicy tofu soup) to take home and eat! Or you can opt to sit in the cafeteria-style area at the front of Greenland Supermarket.

With your order of soondubu, you'll get a rice, a small fish, and some banchan (side dishes -- usually kimchi, some fish cakes, and some seasoned veggie like broccoli or spinach). Not bad for around $8 a person. The price gets steeper if you get a combo (adds meat).

They won't give you more rice, but you can get more banchan!

I'd recommend watching the spice level! Just tell them you want it spicy, but don't ask for extra spicy. If you do, be prepared to suffer the consequences. I love spicy food, but this will get me every time!",g42wi9bOD_WAZsro7VW6rA,1,1,3,RBkfr6DN1atBi8ZY0tcKZw
2662756,2014-05-02,2,W-bfM3k64ZwUeBeKnpeSpA,"The soondubu (soft tofu/ soon tofu soup) was bland and lacking a lot. I wanted to order the tofu and beef soup but also add in mushrooms - the lady had a very difficult time understanding this request. After 5 minutes of explaining to her, she ended up saying ""yes, the beef one has mushrooms."" I asked her to make mine spicy, she had a hard time understanding that as well. After another 5 minutes of trying to explain the spice level I prefer my soup, she said, ""get medium spicy, it's spicy."" I gave up, I just said OK to get on with it. There is a major break in communication here. Don't try to request anything special, just order from the menu and deal with it. 

The soondubu came out bubbling with the egg already cracked in it. I mixed it up, tasted it and it was bland as heck. There was also no spice! I immediately took it back and asked if there is any way she could make it spicier, she looked upset and confused. She took the spoon out and handed it to me, took my soup back to the kitchen, came back out and told me to sit down, and she will bring it to me. 

When she brought it back out she told me to taste it. Shockingly it was spicy, deathly spicy - it was actually inedible now. They put a insane amount of spice. I guess I got what I deserved. I was over taking my food back, so we ate some of it - carefully. It really was painful and not enjoyable. To top it all off it was still bland as heck. 

They really don't understand the concept of spice levels here, so don't even try to request anything spicy. Just go with the flow and get it ""medium"" which is actually not spicy. Oh yeah, and not to mention the 3 banchan sides were all so bad - really bland and a disgrace to flavorful Korean food. I was so sad the kimchi was terrible. 

We also ordered the seafood scallion pancake which was about $13 - a pretty steep price. 

The reason why I'm giving them the 3 stars, is for the seafood scallion pancake. The pancake took longer to come out - about 10 minutes, but it was well worth the wait! It comes out sizzling on a stone plate. It's a nice size so I didn't feel too horrible spending $13 for it. There were good chunks of squid, octopus, and lots of scallion giving it great flavor. The stone plate kept the pancake sizzling at the table and gave the pancake a nice crispy texture, it also kept it scalding hot! We loved it! The dipping sauce was basic - just soy sauce, sesame seeds and scallion, but it was good with the crispy pancake. I would come back and just order the pancake next time.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,2,3,_HpnTPGrE5Kx7UHo2ohuQg

Tofu Hut is known for cheap ayce kbbq. However, half of that small restaurant is for non ayce korean food, and the big lines aren't for that. 

One of their options is a soup meat combo. I believe it's almost the same price as the soup meat combos here except with better quality meat, better soup, and better sides. 

It might be a little further or closer depending on what side of town you're coming from, but if you want a tofu soup and meat combo, Go to Tofu Hut.",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,3,2,2,7v1F8RYzcKh4C0wWwmHRgA

I was so excited to find this in a food court - at an amazingly low price. I went with family and we each ate from a different vendor. I think mine was the best.

I got the kimchi version and I asked for spicy and got it. I was worried I wouldn't get an egg in it, but when she had everything assembled, I was asked if I wanted an egg. It was cracked into the boiling broth and I was happy.

Sides were good - especially the fish. The cucumber kimchi could have been more highly spiced for me. But, there was so much more than I could eat. But - the soup was all gone. Yum.
