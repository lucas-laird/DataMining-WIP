The server didn't even get our order until 15-20 mins of being seated. I get its a new restaurant but it shouldn't take that long for our appetizer to get to the table. The manager had to go to the kitchen and get our food that was probably just sitting there. Then when we got our food the waitress came over and said she forgot our onion rings.

The server was rude, I told Ashley that the appetizer (sweet potato fries and fried zucchini) were undercooked. We did eat them, so I was just letting her know as the kitchen manger should know about issues like that. Then I got my medium rare burger cooked well done. The burger was slopped together and nasty. The fries were undercooked. You can tell the cooks there don't care at all about quality. We ordered a chicken  caeser wrap that was closer to rabbit food. Again,bad management.  When Ashley asked if I wanted a new one I said no thank you as the cooks don't know what they are doing, she then stated that I was having a bad night. Apart from the awful food I could have done without her curt fake attitude she so carefully developed as a disgruntled server. To top it all off they not only did not take the burger off the check but added an extra burger on the check like we wouldn't notice. Again, bad management. In the end they corrected the check but I will not eat at this place again.

As a longtime fan of their burgers, I was disappointed with this new location. The bar area was super small, such that you couldn't just walk up to it. You still had to ask to be seated...at the bar! Then when you were at the bar the staff would hover over you like hungry vulchers, asking how your food was with every bite. It was annoying and claustrophobic. Plus, the burgers just tasted differently than other locations.

Recently, I decided to give them another shot. The bar area was cleaned out and the burger actually tasted like a normal Red Robin burger. One (and only one) bartender waited on me and she was courteous but not a stalker. The bar area is still cramped and set up weird, with the beer taps blocking customers from handing the bartender anything and vice versa, but they seem to be getting the location together and living up to normal Red Robin standards.",fMdDLlybOYPheFpq5QQLfw,1,0,4,1l8NXkQ2vYB3Lv3wCVSLUg

My wife and I were seated at the high tables but the chairs were wobbly. I tried moving over a couple of chairs from another table but they were wobbly too.  I would have preferred a booth but it was never offered which is surprising since the place was half empty.  I ordered a water with my meal but couldn't drink it because it tasted awful. Even the lemon (which I didn't ask for nor did I want) couldn't help the taste. The fries were barely warm and obviously had sat for a while.

630400,2015-05-26,0,c-NXKTJ0jrrusTPxJAUwvA,"Absolute WORST restaurant experience we have ever experienced, and that says a lot because my husband and I dine out very often and both work in the service industry. We dined the evening of 5/24 and our server was BRENT. We arrived shortly after the couple we were treating and they already had their drinks when we arrived. Brent approached our table and without saying a word just stared in our direction, no greeting. We assumed that he was wanting to know what we wanted to drink so we told him. Brent seemed intoxicated while serving us, he smelt like alcohol, wouldn't make eye contact or converse with us, and was bright red and clumsy. My husband ordered a root beer float and Brent brought it in two separate glasses, one for the ice cream and one for the root beer. When he reached our table he spilt the root beer ALL OVER me and my husband! My pants, underwear and shoes were SOAKED and so was my husbands phone. And did we get an apology? NOPE! He through a towel at me to clean myself and continued to wipe down the table. Not a word. At this point we decided to inform the manager that we thought our server was intoxicated and that he spilt root beer all over us. All the manager said was ""I'll take care of it"" and again no apology. The server was gone another 10 minutes before coming back to take our actual food order. After that he kept glaring at us, wouldn't speak to us and was avoiding our table. The manager came out with the food and in front of Brent said ""so I talked to our buddy here and everything is fine!"" And again no apology!! How unprofessional! The only time we ever got any apology is when Brent handled us the bill he said ""sorry about the root beer thing"" totally unsympathetic and obviously because we were about to think about his tip. The worst part of it all is that we didn't get ANY sort of discount on the bill, not even for the root beer float! We had other places to be after dinner and I had to stop and buy new clothes because I was sticky and uncomfortable! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RESTAURANT AND THEIR EMPLOYEES!!!

My burger was small and definitely had no pink as requested but also was charred. Barely edible. Came with endless fries, but they could have put more than 5 on my plate with my burger.  The topper of this visit was the HORRIBLE waiter, Moses!  This kid has the worst attitude!  Couldn't make eye contact, looked away while talking to you, never smiled, not even smart enough to smile when handing  us our check. Also I noticed most all of the staff were handing customers their plates instead of setting them in the table, sounds like a law suit waiting to happen. No reason to ever go back!

And it got worse! Was contacted by customer service who took my # and was told a customer service rep would call me and he did, Philip left a message with a case # and a phone # ( I was working and couldn't risk the call.) I called the # and Aman took my call, tried to give her my case # and she said she couldn't look it up but she could give me a new case #, which I let her do and hung up as that was all she could do for me.

We placed our not so complicated order and when the food finally arrived I had a feeling there was going to be some issues. My fries were cold and I  politely  ask Ashley to get me an order of fresh fries. She look so irritated and bothered by my request. Than my husband bit his burger and simply by his non verbal response I knew he did not like his food. He said five guys taste so much better and didn't even eat the burger because it was cold . We were sitting there waiting for some one to refill our bottomless drinks and fries. So my husband actually went in the kitchen to speak to the manager and asked him to remove his burger off the bill and the manager did.

Came in tonight (Saturday, 5pm), hostess was very friendly, smiled, seated us right away. No problems there.

Server came over promptly, was friendly and very professional. Took drink and app orders.

Drinks- ordered no alcohol, so nothing to write about there.

Apps- chips with salsa and guac, voodoo fries.
Chips are very large and they don't give you hardly any at all. I thought they were bottomless, but I guess not. The portions of salsa and guac are tiny. Didn't even fill half of the (I'm guessing 3 oz) plastic ramiken. Voodoo fries were delicious. I had them without bacon (vegetarian). The cheese on them was delicious, and the fried jalape√±o wheels really made the dish. However, again, rather small. I would not recommend sharing with more than 2 people.  However, it took forever to get to our table (right before the main course was delivered).

Dinner-
I forget which burger the fiance had, but he loved it. I bartended at a gourmet burger place owned by a celebrity chef in a casino, so even though I don't eat meat, I know what a perfect ""medium"" looks like, and they nailed it. Good size too.  He devoured it.

I had a veggie burger with Swiss, guac, lettuce, onion, mayo, and added an egg- medium hard. Burger came out and the egg was not at all cooked. I like over easy, just not the mess, but most of the WHITE of the egg was runny. (I'm like, how do you nail a perfect medium burger, and can't cook a medium egg??) Server agreed it was gross and told me she'd get me another. Again, took forever for one over-medium egg. Finally it came, and it was over-hard and overcooked. Ate it anyway. Burger was tasty. Guac is very good. Steak fries were soggy on the outside and not all the way cooked on the inside. And NO FLAVOR, whatsoever. Even after drowning it with all the sea salt and seasoning salt at the table, they could not be saved. 

Daughter had kid's mac and cheese with broccoli. She liked it. 

Ordered 2 ""Cookie Magic"" shakes to-go. They were good, but filled barely more than half of the cup.

I would like to highlight our server Kris (African American young lady). She was outstanding, deserves 5 stars. I drink A LOT of tea, and my glass was never empty. She even refilled my daughter's lemonade before it was empty (which most places ignore the kid). Automatically brought extra napkins.

We waited 20 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we got our food!  Come on! That's a lot of sitting around just starving.  I ordered the Wedgie burger (protein burger) and there was a TON of mayonnaise.  I thought ""no biggie, I'll just scrape it off"" 10 minutes later...I'm still trying to remove all the mayonnaise! It was absolutely disgusting!  I almost filled our sauce cup with mayonnaise  

Also, bottomless fries? I swear that was a thing there...but their service was so bad, the table behind us asked for more fries...and it came so late, the server has to ask ""did you still want these"", because they were clearly finished with their meal.  I had the same exact thing happen to me, except nobody asked if I still wanted them...they just dumped the basket onto our table and walked away.

Bottomless freckled lemonade, rootbeer float & steak fries? How could I not love this place? 

A long Friday at work prompted me to invite my mom, who's never been to Red Robin, out for dinner here just because I wanted to eat my stress away with those unlimited fries. Prior to walking in, I warned mom that it might be a little bit hectic but surprisingly enough, we were immediately seated in a booth in the 21+ area. We had the sweetest server who immediately brought us our drinks. The freckled lemonade is so refreshing! 

We opted for my usual RR favorites: the $5 O-Ring Shorty (Half-order of the onion rings with Ranch and Campfire sauce), the $6.99 Red's Tavern Double (Double cheeseburger w/ the usual fixin's) and the $8.49 Pig Out Style Tavern Double (Double cheeseburger w/ bacon aioli and more bacon) and two sides of the Campfire sauce because I love pairing it with my fries and burgers.

She was busy, seating guests, cleaning tables but was always smiling. Our server was great,  and so was my husband's black and bleu burger with saut√©ed mushrooms, caramelized onions and bleu cheese sauce and crumble. 
They do have a decent kids menu, burger was decent but the side of fruit was just terrible.. it wasn't fresh fruit, so icky my son could barely swallow. 
I have always enjoyed their Ghost burger and if you love hot, this is the one you want. However they changed their veggie patty and the new one is so chewy, dry and hard. The other bummer is if you order ghost burger on veggie patty, you have to pay for the Big ghost which is $11.50 and not $8.50. 
The restaurant is not that clean, dishes are not clean, silverware needs serious upgrade. For the price, this place needs to upgrade their cleanliness and dishes. My burger was served in a little basket, I would normally think that's for fries but they managed to put the big ghost and fries in this little basket, wonder how they expect us to eat.

Boyfriend ordered the Black and Bleu which was decent and I ordered the Taco Tavern double which was an utter disappointment. What should have been two patties, lettuce, guac, salsa, and tortilla chips came out looking like a double cheeseburger from mcdonalds with a few pieces of lettuce a pitiful teaspoon of guac, and cheese- my salsa and tortilla strips were nowhere to be found. 

We told the waiter who then got it taken care of, but even with the missing additions now on the burger I couldn't get over how this burger was one of the worst I've ever had. Salsa tasted like the bottled ones from the market. There was such a small amount of lettuce that I forgot it was there. Guacamole? What Guacamole? And the patties were even level with mcdonalds. The best thing was probably the cheese.

The server did her best to make it up to us, and even brought the cronuts to us free as a desert...but they were uncooked in the middle too.

It's definitely not a paleo place to eat, but for a chain restaurant serving up burgers that's to be expected so I won't hold it against them too much. A lot of the menu items are quite delicious, however unhealthy.

I got the ""Red Robin's Finest Smoke and Pepper"" burger. My only real problem with this was that the burger patty I had was super dry, and a bit grainy. I feel like it was really, really low in fat, like maybe a 5% patty. Fat is flavor and moisture, and the patty was lacking both, especially moisture. The burger flavor that was there, though, was pretty good, and the sauce that came with it on the side was also good. They claim it has ""extra sharp cheddar"" and I think that's definitely wrong. Maybe medium cheddar, maybe, but still good. 

The real star of the show the last couple times I've come have been the appetizers. Yukon chips and onion dip and tavern fries, and the bottomless normal fries. The Yukon chips and onion dip are delicious, and that dip is good for normal fries as well. Really delicious. If you're familiar with In-n-Out burgers and their ""secret"" off-menu Animal Fries option, you know what the Tavern Fries taste like, but with one major addition: bacon. They're like Animal Fries plus bacon, and they are absolutely awesome.

Hopefully next time I come here the burger patty will be improved. It was cooked perfectly so it definitely wasn't dry for being over-done. I ordered it medium and got exactly what I wanted in that aspect but just no moisture and short on flavor.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,0,0,3,Uv3x8CKE-cnW9SVXB9qWQg

First the place was 2/3 empty, my wife and I were offered the bar, or a table. We could see at least 10 empty booths from where we stood. When we asked for a booth, the host went through a song and dance about finding a booth that had been cleared, surprise...... she found one within 15 seconds. 

Waitress comes to the table, dumps cutlery and napkins in pile, doesn't bother to place in front of my wife and myself, no coasters. Asks if we want to order drinks while we are looking at the menu, I asked what beers are on tap. We are directed to a blackboard in a far corner of the restaurant that the waitress can't even read, she then decides she will have the check and get back to us. I understand on tap beers change, but a cheatsheet in your pocket at the start of shift takes a minute. It is 7pm on a Sunday, how many times has she been asked this question today?

My wife orders a Guacamole Bacon burger, she's asked a question I have never heard in a restaurant before ""pink or no pink""? Translation, our cooks have no training and have never cooked a hamburger before, or the waitress thinks we have the minds of a six year old. Then my wife is asked if she wants fries, garlic fries, various other fries, or onion rings. No mention of the cost of the upsale options. I will say this, I will order whatever I want regardless of price, however I can see this practice adding $10-15 surprise to a large partys bill, it's wrong. I order a Royal Red Robin with onion rings.

We get our drinks, still no coasters. Food comes, burgers are OK, but we've had better at Burger King to tell the truth. I really object to shredded bagged lettuce on a $13 burger, someone is really cutting corners. My wifes garlic fries are cold, greasy, under cooked, but unlimited. My onion rings were cooked in old, dirty grease and were disgusting. 

There is absolutely no excuse for any restaurant cooking in old, dirty grease, most especially a national chain that is supposed to have written standards. If you don't know how to clean your fryers, or lack the proper equipment to clean your grease....THROW IT OUT!

When it comes time for the bill, we're directed to the DIY electronic checkout device on the table, which will also conveniently calculate the tip incorrectly for you. The tip should be based on the cost before taxes, NOT including taxes. I just tip on the total including taxes, but trying to slide a higher tip in under the radar is not a convenience.

I don't complain in restaurants, ask for comps, or make a scene, I just never come back. I wonder how many other patrons of this Red Robin have felt the same way?",wKRTpdrKeETSipzbOmWtEg,3,0,1,K9ZSe2PUf-uEGvu482qoHQ

Ate half my burger and all my fries. Never saw our server. 20 minutes goes by still sitting and waiting hostess comes by asks if we need anything and we ask for more fries. Shortly thereafter she comes back and apologizes for the wait. 

Eat my fries and i want more so i wait and wait and wait some more. Please note the dining area is thinning out.

Food arrived hot and fresh, chili had a good spicy kick to it, service at the bar was attentive and engaging throughout.

 While the service is good and the food isn't bad, their meals are extremely average for the $10-15/pp pricing, hence why my visits are pretty rare (maybe twice a year).

This location however is not like other Red Robins. If you've been to other Red Robins, the food and beverages will be very familiar.  The decor and size of this Red Robin is squuezed.  What you'll also notice is that you have to ask for things.  Having to ask for refills is common.  The drinks do not flow here.  I also notice every time we visit that the place is messy. It takes a awhile to clear and clean tables. I did not see anyone interested in sweeping the floor which was a growing hazard. This last visit we  brought our family, we observed five tables sit over 15 minutes from the time people left to the time it was cleared. What got me counting was how long our visit took.  We were seated within 5 minutes which is great for a group of six people. From there it took ten minutes for a drink order. This appeared common for other tables and is common on most of our visits. We ordered meals with our drink order from there everything was suprisinlgy quick. Our meals came quickly and as we normally expect, they were delicous. Then the pace came to a crawl. We had to ask for refills. Here we watched a number of wait staff begin to flow out the door. This was between 7:30 and 8pm. We waited patiently to order desert for 15 min. We had told our waiter that people were looking forward to desert at the beginning of our meal. When we flagged a waiter it took 15 min for our waiter to arrive and he had our check in hand. We asked for desert and our waiter was pleasant but overwhelmed. The resturant was only half full at this time. Overwhelmed staff is normal at this localtion. While we are waiting we notice more staff leaving, no tables cleared and the floor is a hazard.  Desert comes we all finish up and a normal meal that takes less than an hour at other Red Robins is almost 2 hours here. This is not uncommon for this location. We pay our bill and they somehow lose our cards. Gift cards and whatever bonus card thing is gone. I got my credit card back luckily but was so dissapointed.... again. I still tipped at my normal 20% but was very tempted not to tip at all. I'm not sure if this problem was our waiters fault or an overall issue. Why should I punish my waiter when it appeared the whole store had iasues. We spoke to the manager about our experience and let me note we were given a gift card for half the price of our meal. This was a nice gesture but it's a repeating problem. There is Five Guys behind this restaurant that is about the same price with a better burger but I like atmosphere. As we walked out, we walked out with three more staff. As we turned back the same five tables that had not been  cleared were only just being cleared but we could now see it was a worse issue throughout the restaurant and not just our section. Could all those staff who were leaving cleanup before they left?

I ordered the blue ribbon burger with garlic fries which took 14 minutes to arrive. I slowly sipped my drink during this time because I didn't want to wait forever for another one.

I have been here 3 or 4 times usually in the early afternoon after the lunch rush and the one thing that has bothered me are the tables are always dirty or sticky. I get walked by at least 5 tables that still are full of dirty dishes and glasses. 
The food is what I expect, a decent burger and fries with a cold drink. Service is also the same basically friendly and that is it. With this being said I still like going here just wish the management would work on cleaning the tables as soon as the guests leave.",II8eB5mYk200GW-m-wpsug,0,0,3,6YqEf4r-rlyo5uhllferFw

Sent it back, they were fixing it, didn't want my son's food to get cold so I told him to go ahead n eat.
I got my food when he was already done with his. 
Sucks to have a bday dinner when the other person is already done eating.  Then asked for a to go boxe, girl said she forgot, was double charged for my burger so had to wait for that to get fixed...

We ordered some drinks first, I got the Skinny Lime Margherita, it wasn't that good in fact they put way to much lime in it to the point my face kept puckering with every sip.

We had dinner after watching Suicide Squad with a couple of friends of ours. The 4 of us decided on Red Robin when trying to figure out where to have a quick, casual bite to eat.

(+) This location is relatively new and is very clean and has a fun, festive atmosphere. Plenty of TV's and seating available
(+) the bottomless fries were actually pretty tasty and I did enjoy them. I noticed during our meal that we had to be fairly proactive about asking for refills. It just seemed like they weren't going to volunteer or offer refills willingly.

(-) I ordered what was marked as a new item, the Clucks and Mac and Cheese ($12.50) and later my friend treated me to a basket of bottomless fries (sorry, I didn't catch the price). The mac and cheese was a pretty small portion. Even worse, it didn't taste all hat good. Very bland and watery. When I ordered the clucks, I assumed they would be regular chicken fingers, but they were lathered in a buffalo style sauce, which I am not a fan of at all. Instead of interrupting the flow of the meal for my guests and myself, I decided to just give it a shot. 

Eh. 

I just didn't care for it. It does come with a side of ranch, which made it a bit more tolerable, but I was wildly unimpressed.

(+/-) Service wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't very good either. The young man who helped us was nice, but also seemed a bit lackadaisical. One of the burgers was ordered without onions and came chock full of onions, sauces were forgotten, and the bottomless fries plates were taken away with no offers to refill it until we pushed the issue. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but the service was just not very good.

(-) Our friends tried to use their Red Robin rewards points card and it was nothing but hassles and issues just trying to get their ""points"". Seems like a lot more hassle then it was worth.

I left Red Robin just very unimpressed last night with absolutely zero intentions of ever coming back. There are just too many good places to eat  this town, and even in Downtown Summerlin,  to come back here.

We hadn't been to the downtown Summerlin location so we decided to give it a try. We were seated and our server Tabitha took our drink order and we told her that it was our daughters 4 year birthday. She said that she had a birthday sundae for her at the end of the dinner. When the sodas came out, I could tell that they were flat before she even set the tray down on the table. I said ""It looks like your soda is flat"". Without skipping a beat she said ""No not at all,it is fine"" and then rushed off to deliver the rest of the drinks on her table. Not being convinced, I took one drink and confirmed that it was flat and gross tasting. As I was waiting for her to get close enough to flag down, I took a closer look at the glass of soda and there wasn't one bubble in the thing. Anyone that was paying half attention could have easily seen that it was flat when they were pouring it. I flagged her down and asked her to bring out an iced tea instead. We eventually ordered our food and it came out on-time. When she came back to check on us she asked my daughters mom if she wanted a drink re-fill. My iced tea was sitting in front of my plate of food (90% empty) while her glass was off to the right at the edge of the table. I then began to notice that this girl is not paying attention to anything. She didn't ask if I wanted a refill because my glass wasn't in her line of sight. When she brought the drink refill I waited for her to check on my drink, which I pushed closer to the edge, but that didn't even get her attention.

     So given that great demonstration of anticipating your guest's needs, I was eating my dinner without anything to drink when out of the blue Tabitha re-appeared with some other servers to sing happy birthday to our daughter. They sang the song and she plopped an ice cream sundae down like she was Santa Claus delivering the presents on Christmas Eve. My daughter's mom and I just looked at each other. We weren't even half finished with our dinner and my daughter was still eating the first half of her toasted cheese sandwich. I put the ice cream sundae back on her tray and said ""Put that in the freezer please and bring me a drink refill"". ""We still have to eat our dinner first"" She looked confused and once again I could tell that she wasn't paying attention to anything about our dining experience. We ate our food, paid the bill and got out of there. 

     One thing to remember, is that I could see the open kitchen and the female manager was cooking along side of the employees in the back, Her time would have been better served by being in the dining room and observing the lack of effort that was going on there. After crap service like that, I usually don't come back. I might give them another try, but it's not on my list of things to do anytime soon.",m1-HNN4pghUqDIKr2FUcmw,2,0,1,yW7iNKaLhI4u7a4AaZIeLA

The Pretzel Bite appetizer was a great starter. The pretzels were warm and soft. The beer cheese dipping sauce was the perfect paring.
The DGB Burger consisted a a juicy beef patty with roasted tomatoes, garlic aioli and arugula on a toasted  ciabatta bun. 
The Gourmet Cheeseburger was cooked just as ordered and included melted American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles and mayo. 
The battered  Artic Cod Fish was crispy and fried to perfection. It is served with a tasty dill and pickled tartar sauce.

I have had a very bad experience prior to this visit of Red Robin from small meal portions, not accurate orders and poor service but this Red Robin defies all. From the moment we walked into the door to the time we paid our check we had outstanding service. I've never had service like this from any food franchise ever the food was cooked to perfection and there wasn't anything wrong with it, the price was even reasonable. I can say because of this Red Robin alone I will be giving this business another chance. I would like to give a special thanks to Jessie for his hospitality and his professionalism while taking our order, he was clean, prompt, polite and I could go on for days about him but I'll leave it at that. 

I wish I could give this establishment more then 5 stars but unfortually it doesn't work that way, I would also like to give a special thanks to the manager who checked with us during out visit, his name was Ryan! He made sure we were satisfied with our food and didn't leave us hanging!

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Burger which was cooked to perfection and had to be one of the best tasting sandwiches I've ever had (better then my wife's but don't tell her that) my wife also ordered French Onion Soup which was awesome and she didn't have any complaints. I did take the time to indulge myself in some of their bottomless fruit drinks I believe it was the Raspberry Limeade which was Epic in itself. 

I couldn't ask for anything to go any better then it did on this visit, thanks Red Robin in South Summerlin for coming through and making it happen tonight for my appetite, I will be sending an email along with this review to your corporate office to make sure the appropriate people get their recognition!",r714xl9E-R62gO5K5pBspQ,0,0,5,Q8CgNKNJQOI1MLa4oZao7w

They were insanely busy on a Wednesday of all days and though the wait for a burger was long ''as could be expected'' they came through with once again positive service and a tasty burger. 

The burgers are good. RR has a variety of different burgers and sometimes they throw in a limited time burger fixed up with all kinds of neat add-ons. To top it off they have a bottomless French Fries option sure to throw you into a starchy coma.

We went to the new location in Downtown Summerlin a few weeks ago. I was good with the food as usual that would normally grant a 5 star rating however the sales motivated environment was a bit yucky.

As a former national trainer for a major franchise, internally it is all about Add On Sales. Appetizers, Drinks and Deserts. This is where the profits are as you are all aware when you dine based upon the offerings being provided by your server.

This night the sales pressure was on. I felt like the server was humping my leg for adds. The one thing that got me thinking the most was after I paid for the meal.

I was asked to fill out a survey. The server specifically told me that his shift consideration was based upon his reviews. Is this really the policy? Am I supposed to feel bad that if I don't do the survey this fine young man will not get shifts or possibly lose his job.

I am there to eat a frickin Royal Burger and not to feel pressure.

3758446,2017-03-30,0,c-NXKTJ0jrrusTPxJAUwvA,"This review is for my dining experience on Wednesday, March 29th at about 8:00 pm.  My server was Brianna R. and my 2 star rating is by no means a reflection of her service.  I am a server myself and there are certain things that I experienced during this dining visit that should not have happened.  Plus, the complaint I had should have been handled a little more professionally by the manager on duty and not fall on deaf ears.  Here is what happened.

My daughter and I arrived to the restaurant, and it was fairly busy.  Not really a wait at the door, but a normal dinner rush for a Wednesday night.  There was a few people in front of us waiting to get sat, and we were taken to our table within a few min.  Hostess was very nice and polite.  Our waitress Brianna arrived to our table a few min later to take our beverage order.  My daughter and I both ordered the flavored peach tea.  A couple of min later she returned with our drinks and took our food order.

My daughter ordered the chicken strips with the bottomless fries, and I ordered the prime rib dip with onion rings and a starter side salad.  About 5 min later my side salad arrived. I was kind of shocked to see the size of the salad and how small it was for $4.99.  The plate was literally 2 inches by 2 inches and maybe about 3 oz of salad.  Basically, I ate the salad in about 5 bites.  $4.99 for that?  Really?  While halfway through my side salad, our main courses arrived.  Now, being in the service industry you would think that you would allow your guests to at least finish their appetizer before bringing out the main course.  But, at least the kitchen was putting the food out fast.  My daughters said her chicken tenders were just ok, but the fries were cold and stale.  She was hungry enough and ate them anyway, but again, they were cold.  My prime rib dip sandwich was ok, but the purpose of the jus dip is to be flavorful and soak into the bread and be edible.  However, my main complaint was the fact that the prime rib jus dip was like grease water.....literally!  I brought this to the attention of Brianna, our waitress, and she apologized and told me that she would notify her manager on duty right away and have him come by.  About 10 min or so after that, I was done with the sandwich and the onion rings and I had pushed my plate to the end of the table NEVER seeing the manager!  It wasn't until Brianna came back to the table to clear the plates when I told her that the manager never came by but I was already done eating.  I asked her for the check so we can just get out of here; I was clearly frustrated.

She apologized again, and said she would go get him.  A few moments later the manager came by the table.  I never got his name as he never introduced himself to me, he just approached the table with, ""Hi, how are you.  Brianna said you wanted to see me?""  I explained to him my issues about the jus dip, told him that I had waited for him to come by, but he didn't so I just finished my meal anyway without the jus dip.  He said that he appreciated me telling him and that if it's not brought to his attention then he can't change it.  He could also see and hear how frustrated I was with the experience, but all he said in his departure from my table was that he thought he didn't have to come by, thus, blaming Brianna's communication with him stating that I didn't need him to come by.  Clearly, a big breakdown in communication happened here.  

After waiting about 10 min more, Brianna came by once again just to make sure everything was resolved. I told her that my experience was not anything having to do with her because she has no control over the kitchen or what the managers do.  However, I did recognize her for the fact that she got triple sat, including our table, and did the best she could for that little pop she got.  So, again, no negative reflection on her.  Brianna then asked if I wanted to pay cash or with credit, and I told her that I would just use the little kiosk on the table to pay.  While she was standing there, I showed her the bill and I was absolutely amazed that the manager didn't even bother to take anything off the bill or even offer any type of dessert to make the situation right.  Let me be clear about this:  I am not looking for a free meal, but I have been in the service industry for over 20 years and have even been in management.  There is no excuse that can be made that would warrant a manager not doing anything or offering anything to make the situation right.  With all of the different dining options that are available to choose from in that same area, what would make me want to come back to this Red Robin and eat again after this experience, let alone any Red Robin for that matter?  Instead, the manager passed the blame back on the server.  I ended up paying for my full meal which came to $41.36 and I rounded up to $50 for the tip.  Again, no negative reflection on Brianna because she was great, but I won't be back!!",D_uUJZCSVSvV-TTCQbeCQg,1,0,2,v5-CwDhrLbSRG9wGcgtfbw

Since we live less than a 1/2 mile away, this was a chance to try one of the newer food places in Downtown Summerlin.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression. 

We were semi-greeted when we walked in when an employee reached below the podium and got two sets of menus and finally gestured us to follow him.  I don't recall him saying a word to us.

Our server came to the table promptly and seeing his name tag, I said good afternoon *name*.  He responded with, ""Hi, I'm *name* and I'm going to be your server.  He was trained to introduce himself and give his name and by damn he was going to do it even though I had already spoken to him by name.  Odd.

He took our drink orders and soon brought two iced teas to the table.  We asked for time to study the menu more and when he came back we were ready to order.  He had also given me a card to text a word to a number to join Red Robin's reward program.  (He has seen me using my iPhone as I was checking into Yelp).

My wife ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  She got a cup of Red's Chili Chili and a BLTA croissant.  I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a Burnin' Love burger.  *name* asked me if I wanted my soup with my burger or before.  I answered before.  After not too long, I was surprised when two dinners were brought and I had received no soup.  Oh well, to err is human and I forget a lot, too.  No big deal.

My wife enjoyed her sandwich and really liked the chili.  My burger was topped with a grilled jalape√±o that was very good and was a hot one.  There were ""jalape√±o coins"" and the burger was on a jalape√±o kaiser roll.  There was also chipotle aioli on the burger.  With all this talk about peppers and burnin' love, the only spicy thing was the actual grilled jalape√±o.  The burger was good and I liked the fries.  Since they were bottomless steak fries, I wanted to get some more and to get an iced tea refill.  *name* never came back to see how things were.  I finally flagged him down and asked for more fries and iced tea.  Since there were people at three other tables, *name* could be forgiven for being overwhelmed with the work.

I finished my burger before my extra fries were brought and I had moved my plate to the center of the table to make room for the fries.  When they were brought, *name* removed the two plates from the center taking with him my fork I was going to use with my fries.  Instead, I used one of our large toothpicks to eat some fries until they cooled enough to pick up with my fingers and eat.

Before we were finished with our meal, *name* stopped by to see if we wanted to dessert.  I said back off in a nice manner.  When finished, *name* came back and we ordered the mountain high mudd pie.  The dessert was quite good but once again *name* had a way of irritating me.  *name* brought our check while we were enjoying dessert and rather than just folding the two sides closed and leaving it on the side of the table with the no hurry message, *name* insisted on leaving the check holder unfolded and almost forced it under my right elbow as I was eating dessert.  I picked it up, slapped the two sides together, and put it to my left out of the way.  Before we were finished, *name* came back to pick up the check.  I waved him off.  When we were finished, I looked at the check and sure enough, charged for soup I didn't get.  I pointed this out to *name* and told him he never brought the soup.  He just stared at the check and then walked away never saying sorry I forgot or anything else.  He brought the check back and he once again insisted on pushing the opened check holder under my right elbow.  *name* just doesn't learn.

I paid the check and we left.  My rating for Red Robin would have been a three.  The food is not bad and I enjoyed it.  Service is what brought it down.  *name* needs some retraining.  You've been open long enough to have this correct.  One thing, they won't have to worry about a free burger on my birthday.  I won't be redeeming that reward.  A second chance to make a first impression--of course not!  A second chance at having decent service along with decent food--maybe!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,5,2,-OV8ESXrSbI2JrBmfjjlOw
3992345,2017-07-23,0,c-NXKTJ0jrrusTPxJAUwvA,"Although having bad experiences already at this location, my daughter LOVES Red Robin and the distance to drive to the Henderson location from our house is not worth it. I received a message from management from my last visit (and Yelp post) requesting my info, but upon my response, never heard back.

Do not come here with any sort of expectation. This time, my fiance, daughter and I visited around 6pm on a weekday and were seated promptly. (Female, didn't get her name) server came by and was very friendly. Very personable. I noticed they didn't offer (at least on the menu) the kid's Mac and Cheese like they normally do. (My daughter always gets kid's Mac and Cheese with 2 sides of broccoli). On the regular menu they offered a ""grown up"" version,  like $13, which had extra stuff (truffle oil, bread crumbs, etc) which is great, except my daughter only eats plain Mac and Cheese. I asked if we could just get it plain, like they used to offer on the kid's menu, and she said it wouldn't be a problem. I ordered a burger, substituting a veggie patty, with extra pickle, and added a spicy aioli, of sorts. Fiancee ordered a burger, forget which one, but there were no issues with his order. 

I've been bartending (and have served) a long time, and while we were waiting for our meals, our server was quadruple sat... and sat and sat.. Of the tables she had that I COULD SEE, at one point, she had 11 tables. Needless to say we never received refills, my fiance and daughter's food came out a good 10 minutes before mine. My daughter's Mac and Cheese came out with all the ""adult"" added stuff on it and her broccoli was cold. When mine finally arrived, I had not one pickle, although I asked for extra, the aioli I requested was non-existent, and the veggie patty was so overcooked and hard I literally hit it on the plate and it didn't even fall apart. When we finally flagged someone down, my fiance was halfway through his meal and my daughter was hungry so she ate the cold broccoli, so I figured I'd deal with the disgusting patty and asked for the pickles and aioli. Aioli came, no pickle. I was done. Sent back the mac and cheese since it was going to take forever for another, and sent back my veggie burger. I was munching on the ""bottomless"" fries while waiting and was never offered a refill of, like, the 6 fries they actually give you. Our drinks were never refilled. Which 100% was NOT our server's fault because she was running around like crazy with all her other tables. She apologized profusely and said the manager was going to come talk to us (she offered, we didn't request), and about 15 minutes later she asked if he had come by (which he hadn't). She apologized and told us to hang on. Eventually, a man casually saunters over and said ""so, she didn't like the mac and cheese?"".. Seriously?? I showed him my disgusting veggie burger and explained the situation with the mac and cheese, and he acted like he was doing us a huge favor by taking the mac and cheese and veggie burger off the tab (which we never ate). Seriously, at least one of your servers is in the weeds with all these tables and you're not even on the floor to help out where you can?? She was giving poor service to everyone simply because you can't be in 5 places at one time. While we were waiting for him to come over we ordered a split milkshake (fully intending to pay) but he did comp that, also, without request. PLEASE get better people to run your store. Hats off to our server, who gracefully dealt with all of her tables and running around, and was still smiling. Wish I caught her name.",PTfIcx4u7-VaDRaGp0mAdQ,0,0,1,dQCbM5W8reJORxESA_gDyg

I recently had lunch here on a weekday with 2 coworkers. We were seated promptly in the bar area with no wait but service was quite slow from that point on. 

It took our waitress about 10 minutes to come to the table to take our drink order. We have had her as our waitress in the past and she's typically on point, and we could see her interacting with other customers so I believe the delay was due to a staffing issue. 

When she did make it over to our table, she not only knew what each of my coworkers wanted to drink, she also knew we were going to want a basket of bottomless fries to start out. She stated she'd put that order in right away. 

A few minutes later, two of the three iced teas we ordered came out. 
Then the third.
Then our food. Still no fries. Well, I had the fries that came with my burger, but the fries that were meant to be an appetizer were MIA. 

Our waitress apologized and said her manager would be by the table.
Then we get the fries, but the basket was only half full. 

The manager did come by, but wasn't very apologetic and didn't really do anything to rectify the issue. At a minimum, the fries ordered as an appetizer should have been removed from the bill. 

The burger I had was actually really good, but the kitchen and management are not up to par, a good server can only do so much. I'm still debating if I will bother going back.

Time frame: 20 minutes to be greeted by staff after getting a table, 30 minutes until drinks, 65 minutes until burgers arrived.  Ugh, terrible.

Staffing: Nothing short of maximum effort on their part.  Visibly  sweating, moving nonstop, amazingly positive attitude for the unending river of shit customers were giving them.

Food: Not too shabby.  On par with other Red Robins we have been to. 

What happened today was more than likely a perfect storm.  Holiday weekend, 12:30 lunch rush, and no kidding at least 8 groups of families with showed up in a 5 minutes span to be seated.   Loud, baby strollers everywhere, parents obviously fried from dragging their screaming kids from store to store all morning; this was a tough day for the staff. 

So

Food: 3.5 stars.  It's burgers and fries. 
Atmosphere: 0 stars due to the noise, chaos, ( but a solid 4 for the actual place; surprisingly clean)
Staff: 10 stars.  I would have quit on the spot. Strong work gang.

Overall, I would say my experience here was okay.  I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could.   

We ordered:
-Fiery Ghost Tavern Double ($8.49) - my mom ordered this, she really enjoyed her burger but she thought it would have been a little bit spicier because of the jalapenos on her burger, she also noticed her burger only came with fresh jalapenos even though it was supposed to come with both fresh and fried jalapenos
-The Southern Charm Burger ($13.99) - served with bacon on a ciabatta bun, I thought this was just okay, also ordered this to be medium rare but it came out more on the well done side, the ciabatta bun was a little on the soggy side, I opted for the onion rings instead of the fries and the onion ring breading would just fall off every time I would try to eat/bite it.

4350772,2017-05-08,0,c-NXKTJ0jrrusTPxJAUwvA,"Red Robin is my absolute FAVORITE place to go if I don't want to spend too much, but don't want to eat fast food. I'm going to compare Red Robin's Big Tavern burgers (regular sized burger)/Double Tavern burgers (two kid patties instead of one normal patty) to McDonald's meals to show that Red Robin is actually cheaper. On average, the BT burgers are priced at $8.99 while the DT burgers are priced at $6.99. Now this is including unlimited fries and unlimited normal sauce (as in not the special ones so ketchup or ranch, etc.). A McDonald's Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal is $7.43, but that's not including sauce because they charge for sauce now. So if you were to dine at Red Robin, you'd not only get a delicious burger, but also great service, unlimited sauce, and unlimited fries for $8.99/$6.99. If you were to eat at McDonald's, you'd get no service, an okay burger, limited amount of fries, and you'd have to pay for sauce every single time. So Red Robin is actually cheaper especially if you eat a lot of fries or like to have a lot of sauce. They added a new burger to the Tavern menu and it's basically a baked potato burger (includes bacon, fries, chive sour cream sauce, etc. all in the burger) and it's definitely my new favorite. You can't beat the flavor and the price. Seriously I'm amazed at how cheap the burger is for how great it tastes. Now as for the restaurant itself, it's clean and comfortable. The host always greets, the servers are attentive, and everyone is nice, but it's the nice as in they have to because it's their job. It's not genuine. Basically the staff is like any other normal place, but they weren't amazing enough to leave an impression until my boyfriend and I had Britni as our server. She was the only one who ever left an impression on us out of all the times we've dined at this location. She did such a phenomenal job and was really on it even though they were short staffed. We came Tuesday morning after the NAB convention and got seated. It took her a while to get to us, but she did stop by saying that she'll be right with us as soon as possible because they're short staffed. That was one of the good things she did because she communicated with us. She did look like she was very busy due to being short staffed, but she NEVER once forgot to check up on us, give us more fresh fries, fill up our drinks so many times without us even asking, and she was actually genuinely kind! You can definitely hear it in her voice and see it in her facial expressions that she was being kind like you were one of her friends. There's a clear difference between someone who is just being nice and someone who is genuinely wanting to know how you're doing or how your meal was and you can see this in Britni. I'll obviously come back as I have before so many times, but this time I'll be asking for Britni more often!

I got eyes rolled on two separate occasions. Once when I chased the server down for a size upgrade on the shake.

We ordered the ""Big Whiskey"" and the ""Black & Blue"".

I have not eaten a Whopper since I was a kid, but after trying the BW, I now remember what a Whopper taste like. Seriously, I thought I was at Burger King. The only difference was the $12 that Red Robin charges you for the burger. Then I was offered the option of parmesan fries for an additional .99 cents. I was served old fries that were cold and broken in small pieces.

The Black & Blue was good. It was made with Black Angus Beef, mushrooms, and blue cheese. It was served on a ciabatta bun.

The service was good. We were greeted by a hostess upon our arrival and she also asked us how everything was before we departed. The server did a fine job and a woman that appeared to be a manager stopped by our table to say hello. The server brought us fresh fries after I brought the old fries to her attention, so I did not bring it to the managers attention. The cooks should not have sent the fries to the table though. Also, when I asked the server if the meat they used for the Big Whiskey burger was USDA Choice, she said she would ask the kitchen staff. Upon her return I was notified that there was not anyone in the restaurant that could answer my question.

Summary:
$37 for two small burgers, two drinks, and two sides of fries.

Mindy was the manager floating and assisting her servers with the not-so-busy climate in the restaurant being 5pm and not reaching peak dinner time. She kept ensuring her customers were well fed, and always stocked with whatever they needed. I'm an observant guy so when I see a manager on the floor and being extra enthusiastic with her customers, it just shows that she's serious about customer service. She didn't mind taking food plates from customers, bringing sauces, and even bussing tables. She wasn't a high horse about her position like most managers I see in a food and beverage facility. Mindy assisted us well, and our table neighbors in a very polite manner. 5 stars!

Harrison was our server. Nothing but positive from this guy. Enthusiastic, brought our food to us in a timely manner, AND respectful of any requests we had.

I ordered a cheeseburger plain with pickles on the side and I had to ask for the pickles twice after receiving my burger. My group also ordered chips and salsa/guac as an appetizer.  While ordering, I asked if it was possible to have it cut in half (I was told mini burgers were no longer served) and he said it would be no problem. My girlfriend ordered the Royal Robin burger and requested ranch and thousand island on the side. 

He finally surfaced with our food 25 minutes later and our appetizer.  I don't think he understood the concept of an appetizer...it was chips and pre-made dips it really should have came out shortly after ordering. I didn't get the pickles I wanted on the side nor did we receive the ranch and thousand island dressings per my girlfriend's request. My burger wasn't cut in half which would not have been a big deal except Ralf never gave us any silverware or napkins. We had to wait around until Ralf came out of wherever he was hiding to get silverware. Thankfully I had a bunch of napkins in my bag, so we just used those. Also, our drinks were often empty and Ralf would be, once again, no where in sight.  Very disappointing service and I don't think we'll be back especially at the high price tag. The host was pretending to answer the phone and texting on her cell phone behind the podium during the entirety of our visit.

I went out to dinner Saturday afternoon with a fairly large party and upon sitting we informed the server of how we would be splitting our check to ensure that there would be no confusion and he reassured us that it would be no problem. When it came time to pay the server divided the check ""evenly"" amongst all of our party members with the total coming out to around $13.50 per person. This did not make any sense as some ordered more than others and one person in our group didn't order anything at all. We finally requested that each individual pay for what they personally ordered and were instructed to write down what each of us received, we were then given new reciepts by a different server and payed our personal balances. The server returned and told us that our total balance was over $300 and that we were $80 short. One of the members in my party was willing to pay the $80 because we were running late to a function we had to attend, but then we realized that something was wrong- if all 17 of us were initially supposed to pay $13.50 then the total balance should have been $230. When we called the server out on her error she left and returned saying we actually only owed $20. She also complained to us about how ""her shift should have ended an hour ago."" To make matters worse, none of us received the proper amount of change which leads me to believe that the server wanted to scam us out of as much money as possible, or simply does not know how to split a check or give proper change, which I believe all servers should know how to do.

The shakes are well-worth the price and are pretty reasonable; which you can order a monster size for a dollar extra. The mud pie at the end was HUGE! 

P.S. Was not charged for the sodas (don't know if they took it out of the bill, or forgot.)",sYhayoonnMu2wDFmKeWEjQ,1,0,2,uT_wHuglGvRdLUy5g2MgFg

I told my family it was going to be great, and convinced them to come with me to show them how good it was. When we got there, the wait staff was very friendly and I was super excited to get my prime chophouse veggie burger. While other tables were seated and served, my table waited 45 minutes before we got our food. When the burgers showed up, I forgot about waiting because I was so excited to eat! When we got the food it was extremely disappointing. The burgers were missing ingredients, and they just did not taste good. I'm so upset, and I hope the management improves this restaurant. I had really high hopes that it would be good, now I'm just sad and disappointed because I'll never have a veggie burger like I had at another red robin, close to home.

After the burgers, we decided to try two of their desserts (cinnamon sugar doh rings and chocolate fruffles.) Both are super delicious. The cinnamon sugar doh is a light donut that you can dip into two sauces, caramel or chocolate. The chocolate fruffles is a chilled chocolate covered brownie stick that you can dip in a berry sauce and/or whip cream. This one was my fave.

Pros:

Everyone was very friendly, host guy was GREAT, waiter was nice and the manager who came over was also.

Burgers were good as usual. Cheese sticks and onion rings were also good.

Cons: 

Service was pretty so-so. The kitchen seemed chaotic, and they were apparently having a very difficult time getting fries out.

Our waiter seemed great in the beginning, but forgot about us soon after, and was frazzled once we tracked him down. We asked a couple times for refills on drinks and fries. Drink refills came after a manager was involved (see below) and fry refill never came. Fry thing really bugged my husband as he asked for extra fries (which did come with the appetizers)  and mentioned to the waiter that he would eat a lot of refills, even as he ordered, so the fact that he didn't get one, was irritating. 

Our daughters meal was wrong, and we had to send it back which prompted a manager to come over. He asked how everything was (he was very nice!) and we mentioned the lack of refills, very shortly after, the waiter brought them and mentioned they were on the way as the manager came to ask for them, and seemed irritated we ""told"" on him, I guess?? It was awkward. 

Lastly, we got a pretzel bites appetizer which was TERRIBLE, tasteless, full of weird brown grease, and just YUCK. However, the manager took those off the bill for us, which was very nice. 

So overall, while it seems like it was a more negative experience, the great host, manager, decent waiter, and burgers brought it up to 3 stars for me. Hopefully, they will get better about handling the crowds over there!",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,1,1,3,sAzI47FXiIF2hoeruj-atg

We arrived late for lunch, probably around 1 pm. It was not very busy but the servers were rushing around and it took a while for ours to come up. They seemed very under staffed. I ordered a draft beer and water. My wife ordered a strawberry lemonade and water. It took about 10 minutes to get the waters and lemonade, and then the server told me they no longer carried the seasonal summer ale, in May. I picked a different one but heard another server telling a table next to us they were out of some other draft beer. After we ordered our burgers it took about 20 minutes to get our food. After I  took a bite I  realized that it wasn't what I ordered. After another 10 minutes of no server I went to the host stand and told the hostess. She came back and looked and confirmed that it definitely wasn't what I ordered and took it back to the manager. Then she came and apologized. A few minutes later our server came back and apologized. I said it was ok and asked for mayo. The entire time my wife had not taken a bite because she wanted mayo, and had been waiting about 15 minutes at this point. Another 5 minutes or so later i got the correct burger from the manager, who also apologized. At this point I was frustrated but they whole staff was very nice and as I mentioned, I suspected they were under staffed, so I said it was no problem. That's when it all turned way worse. 
We finished our food and the server stopped by. my wife asked for a to-go box. She brought it right  away. Another 10 minutes later she came back and asked if we wanted anything else before we left. I told her we were good for our check. She said ok and went to the table next to us and offered them their check. A few minutes later she brought them their check and then asked the table on the other side of us if they wanted their check. Another few minutes goes by and she comes out with theirs, then walked away. My wife was furious so we just went to pay on the table kiosk. It was then that we saw that we were charged for all 3 burgers. The server originally put in the wrong one. After another 10 minutes of not seeing our server or the manager, we manually split the check on the table kiosk and paid our portion, then left. 
I'm still fairly certain they were under staffed, at least when we got there. By the time we left, which was at least 90 minutes later, if not more, there were at least 3 more servers that I did not originally see. But I now also think that the staff was not very familiar with their food or drink menus. The manager did make a correction and apologized, but no one offered anything to make up for it and didn't even care enough to fix the check. That, coupled with barely being available on the floor demonstrates that customer service is not much of a priority. The food was good, but you can get a good burger other places too, without waiting way too long or trying to track down an employee.",aEeUz7PErpqMMEZ-RNF7JA,1,1,1,FOBwR0Q3bg1qH6P01OLq_w

The reason I felt like this was because I sat in the bar area at a booth over the weekend and received bare minimum service. When I first sat down it took a while before the sever acknowledged us. Once she took our order it was just bare minimum service from there. She never asked if we would like refills on anything. We paid for our food and when the survey popped up on the screen I laughed in my head. Does she really want a survey of how I feel I was treated today? I never took the survey, but I feel like this establishment should know how my experience was so it doesn't happen again....hopefully. I love burgers!

I was craving a JUICY, FATTY burger, and I've had my share around town and thought, ""Hey, why not give this place a shot.""

My burger was SO DANG GOOD! Was it because I was phening for one? I don't know. Everything about it worked for me, and I got my medium with a bit of pink on the inside.
The salsa burger was really cute looking, and though it sounded so bizarre, it was actually PRETTY GOOD. 

Onion rings were way too gooey on the inside for me. And the breading was not my fave. 
I'll just order a simple burger next time.

I, for one, can eat a lot and take advantage of the bottomless fries, drinks, salad, etc. but I've found after asking one or two times the servers become quite curt and avoid you, or take forever to get your request to you. Either they need to limit the customer's expectations if they aren't going to follow through or they need to get more staff to meet the flow of orders/re-orders.

5859731,2016-10-09,0,c-NXKTJ0jrrusTPxJAUwvA,"Well, the only way I will go back to this store is if they do something nice for me and give me a comp. I ordered a burger called ""Southern Charm"". My rare burger was well-done. I do not eat dried out, overpriced burgers. I love a good burger, but this ain't it. So, I sent it back for something that was edible. After and long wait and everyone was finished eating, my burger came. Cooked medium and dry, but not as heinous as the first one. In the booth next to us, I overheard them getting a comp and $30 credit for their next visit. We didn't get much attention from the waitress or management. I made this my Red Robin location because it is closest to my home. From the looks of their rating here, I am not alone. I spent $56 on three crappy burgers and the fries that come with them. Palace Station has an excellent 1/2 pound burger for $3.99, which also comes with fries. So, you pay three times as much for a burger that is not even half as good. Fool me once, fool you. Fool me twice, fool me. The ice tea is weak, also. As a restaurant manager, it is plain to me that the cook cannot follow simple directions, which also then falls upon the manager's head because it is his job to protect his store.",FuT39iQ08WSgsDWDtaGgZg,0,0,1,EJMm6owYLUi1ynOnOZ_2zw

It was cold and windy outside, but inside was so much worse. Icy air blasted from the AC, and there was nothing that could be done. One manager came over to apologize, said their AC is controlled by corporate, which is in Colorado. I guess they're too stoned out up there to care. Later, that manager returned with another one, only to sympathize with us sitting in our winter jackets trying to eat dinner. Maybe offer a hot toddy?

Our waiter, Drew, was excellent. He brought me a taste of the house chardonnay, because I don't usually drink that and they don't stock Riesling. It was passable and cheap. Our food was hit or miss. Mine was a hit - I had the chicken bruschetta sandwich, served on a torta roll. I liked that I was able to get salad instead of the fries, without an upcharge. Hubby ordered the turkey burger, and wasn't happy when the bun completely fell apart, making it hard to eat. His fries were soggy, but Drew replaced them with hot, crispy ones.

I can't enjoy any meal when I'm shivering from unnecessary cold. Too many joints in Vegas blast the AC during the winter, but this was exceptionally bad, and that's the outstanding takeaway from this experience.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,3,3,uWHUK5AMUjy5T0INqal7kA

Awkwardly standing in front of the hostess a few min before she greets us because she's getting some menus together. 

Took 20 min to get the waitress to take our order. Too busy doing setting silverware down, walking away, introducing herself, walking away, saying she'll be with us shortly, walking away. We finally get her to stay and she says we need to order drinks from the computer- useful information to know 20 min ago. Then she had to take our little computer thing because it wasn't working. Finally she comes back and says she'll take our order. I order everything at once because I'm over waiting at this point.

My choc shake comes- without the metal container that always comes with it. Some random had to bring it over.

My burger comes completely wrong- takes the entire time my mother takes to eat to make mine as originally ordered. So we both eat alone even though I asked for some fries to try and eat something together and those didn't come out until my new burger. Food was good- just wish you could eat with the party you arrive with.

Had to basically jump on the waitress to get anything- order placing, ranch, refill, to go boxes- I finally just asked for the check when my burger came right and my mother was waiting on me just so we could get out of there.

5929003,2016-01-04,3,c-NXKTJ0jrrusTPxJAUwvA,"I was excited to hear that Red Robin was opening at Downtown Summerlin. We used to dine at Red Robin often when living in California. Who doesn't love their bottomless steak fries? However, after moving to Las Vegas, it became a rare treat. I know they had a location in The Galleria and somewhere in the Centennial area, which are not convenient to where I live. 

After dining here several times, I have to say that I am very disappointed with both the food and the service. Maybe its the location, but the food isn't as good as I remember. The menu has definitely changed over the years. The Artichoke and Spinach Dip used to be large enough for a full meal. It also used to come with small pieces of garlic bread. This was very delicious back in the day, but now it is horrible - very sour and can't taste the artichoke or cheese at all! It almost tasted like chips with mayo. Gross. The bottomless steak fries used to be awesome as well. Nowadays, they don't even care to cook them very well and are horribly soggy. The generous portions of the fries have now been cut down to about 10 fries per plate. Surprisingly, some of my favorites like the BLTA Croissant, the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap and the Clam Chowder are still pretty tasty. I would also like to point out that the fruit salad here is awesome! Apples, Mandarin Oranges, Pineapples and Strawberries. Everything that I like! I love fruits, but I really can't stand Cantaloupe and Honeydew Melon. 

Service here has consistently been bad and very slow. After the hostess sits us at our table, it seems like the wait for our server is usually about 20 minutes. Then when she finally shows up, we give her our drink and food orders right away because she took so damn long. Then what happens? Our appetizer arrives at our table before our drinks. Ugh, really?! Most of the servers do not even care to check up on us. Luckily, Red Robin has those Ziosk devices at every table so you can pay without having to wait for your server to bring you the check.

Come on guys, you have been open in the mall for a while now, time to get your sh!t together!!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,7,4,2,g3xVmkwszMR21LRb9_pxvg

I understand that someone can be busy, however the cardinal rule of waiting on kids is serve the kids first. We asked if some fries could come out to get my young one started, and the manager did oblige. The kid meal came out with rest of the food.

My main issue is that we would need something and then someone would drop off after awhile or not come back and check to make sure everything was ok. Wrong side items with food, wrong drinks, but because our server was busy, we just went with it. I would normally recommend but I am not sure if this was a fluke service or this location is not equipped to handle a decent size crowd.",nGYWMsfUofP3cWmzuW8fWw,2,2,2,DhSCzU_4kMGWZGJ2yj9bAA
