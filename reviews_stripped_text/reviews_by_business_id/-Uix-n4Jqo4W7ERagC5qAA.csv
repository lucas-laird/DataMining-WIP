Food order was placed at 9:05am. Food came at 11:25am
This should already give anybody an indication how well this restaurant give importance to customer service. And all they could say was sorry for the long wait. Really?!
Lets move on to food...
Tapa, longganisa, bangus, liempo - silog
Food was very bland and obviously cold by the time we got it. Good thing we have a microwave to at least heat things up.
The eggs and I mean all 10 eggs included in the orders are burnt at the bottom and very raw on top. I realize its a sunny side up but how hard can it be to not burn eggs? Once or twice may be acceptable (not!) but to burn all 5 orders of eggs (2/order) is just way too much.
The liempo was made up of 2 slices of pork fat, not even a sliver of meat in it, just 2 slabs of fat cooked I don't know how. 
Bangus (milkfish) that's supposed to be boneless had so much bones in it that its a joke to call it boneless.

With this kind of food, I'm surprised people are still giving it high praises. And with their kind of customer service I will caution everyone about even thinking of eating or ordering from this restaurant. There's definitely better filipino food around Vegas for anyone to waste their time here.",mID_4WxASta4JlOd6B5r9g,8,7,1,fhioeSL-NMKr8BtsthQd4A

I called that number again and the guy give me their accountant for MenuStar which gave me the number to the MenuStar Customer Service.

I came here in the morning with a party of five. We were greeted and seated right away. The  staff was very friendly and accommodating - they walked us through the menu and introduced their most popular dishes. They also explained to us that they only cook the food until after we order, so we know that it's served fresh. 

I ended up getting the longsilog (longanisa that comes with garlic rice, two eggs, and side of pickled papaya aka achara). The longanisa as expected was very heavy but good (hey, it's not a Filipino dish if it's not heavy and we're on vacation so.. ;)). The garlic rice you can tell included tiny bits of real chopped garlic so it was very garlicky and tasty. Overall I was satisfied and got a food baby for sure by the time I have devoured everything on my plates. 

Price is also very reasonable. You can't go wrong with $6.99 plates especially with the food, hospitality and fast service.

The place, being a hole in a wall at Chinatown, is very small but clean. The bathrooms seemed well maintained also.

**Check in on Yelp and see if they have freebies. The staff was kind enough to tell us that and we got free yummy egg roll/ lumpia!!

Menu includes tacos: I tried the ""I'm Going Back to Kalbi"" ($4.50)  and was a bit underwhelmed. Portion was wrapped in one corn tortilla that promptly fell apart on the first bite and flavors were one-note. Interested in trying their chicken teriyaki and tofu tacos on another visit.

There are also bowls on the menu, some hand rolls (the Cali was large and only $3) as well as a handful of sides. Tried the miso soup (simple with lots of green onion), the seaweed salad (classic), and the poke (just a bit spicy, really enjoyed this- $4). 

Location is around the corner from a major plaza and has limited parking out front with signage not to park on the side/back of the building. Interior is rather plain but service is friendly.

-I would eat everything on the menu.

Location:
This place is located in one of the busiest parts of China town. They're on the side of the building. Not very visible and parking is located in the back where delivery trucks roll through. Tiny restaurant with 4 tables. Mainly a delivery-type business.
Very clean inside so good on them.

Price:
Amazing!!!! Such great value!!!!
$6.99 for all entrees.

Food:
Presentation is simple, but the quality of the food is what you are craving for. Big portions, except for the rice. Which is designed to be a cup just enough to command you to order another cup.

Other Comments: 
I gave a four (4) star because everything was perfect, except when I ordered a halo-halo I must constructively inform you that the halo-halo focuses more on quantity rather than quality. 
Their halo-halo is cheap and big portion, except it taste like crap. Mushy unknown ingredients, and hard familiar ingredients. Very bland too, and the ice needs to be more fine. I really hope they rethink the way they make their halo-halo.

Overall:
I love this place!!! I hope nothing but the best for this business and I hope they go big. I recommend this place to everyone who craves a great Filipino breakfast.",n4jYWMUXAq9qA6YRyMbBsQ,6,2,4,GO6joPBqCJCRK37zXONFGg

With only 2 tables and literally 8 chairs and a narrow 2-seater bench (the posted max room capacity is 12), it would be best if you just ordered ""to go"" or called in for ""pick-up"" , or  wouldn't mind the wait if you decided to eat in.  In a weird kinda way, it reminded me of my grandma's ""dirty kitchen"" back in Hawaii (FYI:  Dirty kitchen does not mean the kitchen is dirty.  For Pinoys, it's the ""other fully functional kitchen"" where most of the cooking and dining are done while the main kitchen and main dining room are kept immaculately clean and hardly touched except on very few special occasions).  

There is a reasonable wait because your food is cooked ""a la minute"".  Mind you, its not the best but their offerings definitely hit the spot.  I didn't even know they existed until after reading an email I received from Eater featuring Vegas cheap eats.  

Silogs are typically a breakfast fare (""almusal"" in the native vernacular, derived loosely from Spanish verb ""almozar"") but are offered here all day long with 16 varieties to choose from.

I walked in just as they were opening up for the day so I was the only customer. I briefly chatted with the chef and he looked vaguely familiar.  It turns out, this place is  owned/managed by the same people behind Full House BBQ in Henderson.   After the chef started preparing my food, people started coming in and all were ordering silogs.
 
I planned all along to order a silog but ended up ordering regular lunch dish (pancit canton, lumpia shanghai and tokwa't baboy) since it was lunch time.  Don't get me wrong, my lunch was neither too bad nor the best but let's just say I should have stuck with my guns and ordered a silog. 
  
I am definitely going back and try their silogs and update my review (by the way, my 4 star rating is for the non-silog lunch I had).",W9C7l46Me0iuzbio_0BhdQ,3,3,4,LJLZ9YMpHrIooOePVUmc4Q

To start i really like the place, small enough to sit comfortably watch some filipino shows and really be in the feel of vegas. But what I don't understand is how filipino food specifically restaurants have not raised to the top with our variety of taste and textures we should be at the top of the foodie charts.  When you serve your clients the basic staple of our country ( rice) please make sure its fresh. To serve me Garlic fried rice with the garlic purple in color this tells me that the rice has been sitting, re heated, re fried several times over that the garlic actually changes colors. This is a fact-

Rice to me is essential in this situation- Its really easy to cook and it can make or break you as a business. sounds funny, I know but to foodies like me its the details that matter. to some i might sound harsh or out pocket with my reviews.

We got the pork belly sinigang and pancit bihon. The pork belly was really yummy! The sinigang broth was just perfect. It had the right amount of tamarind flavor without overpowering everything. I also enjoyed the addition of eggplant, green beans, bok choy and diced tomatoes. It's a perfect choice if you're trying to eat healthy and detox from all the carbs in Vegas.

As for the pancit bihon, I really liked it. I've had pancit bihon back in CA and sometimes it's a hit and miss. The noodles were flavorful and not dry. I liked the taste of everything. If you like vermicelli noodles, then you should definitely try it.

5645304,2016-12-06,0,-Uix-n4Jqo4W7ERagC5qAA,"So, of all the Pinoy places in Vegas, why did I choose this tiny modest place?!

Because of their variety of ""-silogs."" (They have at least 16! What?!?!! Yeah!!!) 

And the fact that nothing is cooked until you order is a HUGE PLUS! 

At the speed I was going, I almost drove away from it - good thing Hubbers spotted it immediately. 

Plenty of parking on the street, so this isn't an issue. 

Walked in and yes: it really IS a small joint. I have to say the place can probably only seat about 17 people, bar seating included.

There were about 5 other customers when we got here, so it felt like there was a crowd (it really is that small!) 

Hubbers went for the tocilog. 

I went for the tortasilog. And a melon drink.

So did my Dad. With a coke.

Mom went for the liempo silog. 

We also wanted to try their sinigang so we put in a whole order. 

One would think it might take forever since everything is cooked to order, right?! 

We were all surprised ALL our food got to our table in about 20 minutes. 

Talk about a yumfest. We really enjoyed our individual meals. We also shared our dishes - that liempo was cooked to a nice, well-seasoned perfection. 

We had enough leftovers to build a whole ""-silog"" so we had that wrapped up to-go. (For possibly a midnight meal.) 

Total is approximately $50. (I'm estimating because I didn't see a breakdown/receipt of our orders.) We were also told it included a mandatory $5 gratuity for a party of 4. 

You know... I was so happy with my meal, I didn't even care. Although given the choice, I might have tipped a bit more, but since they decided on their own tip amount, I let it go. 

(I had the to-go meal the very next day and... HOOOO-EEEY!!! That garlic rice got REALLY garlicky!!!! I'm not a vampire, or anything, but it got REALLY strong. I might just opt for steamed rice next time.)
