Sure, $9.99 for a medium sized gelato is a bit pricy, but the creaminess and burst of flavors of all gelato makes it all worth it. For a medium, you can get a good few scoops in a cute little cup. It does get a bit too sweet after each bite, so have water on the side and be open to share this with someone else! This time I went for half Snickers and half Strawberry Cheesecake.

They let you have as many samples as you'd like, but when it comes to the actual purchasing of gelato, they make SURE you don't get more than the top of the cup. They actually scoop gelato off the top so that your cup of gelato ends up flat. Ciao Ciao is pretty pricey, too... so I don't see why they don't let you have a little extra of gelato above the top of the cup! I was super disappointed when they put the tiramisu over the marscapone toffee, so I only got a bit of the tiramisu since they scraped most of it off. Lame.

I've only tried the gelato here and even though it was tasty, it was very ooey gooey. You had to lift the spoon high in the air for the strands to actually break. It kinda ruined the gelato for me even though the flavors were good.

I got the smallest size just to give it a try and it gave me the limit of three gelato flavors. I went with strawberry, vanilla, and mint chocolate chip. I'm not a fan of any other flavors besides vanilla, but I had decided to give it a try, plus the way it was served looked amazing. While my three flavor layers were being served I asked for the whipped cream and they served it with what seemed a triangle shaped waffle cookie? I am not too sure. For the taste, I first tried the mint chocolate chip, it was rich in flavor, creamy, and delicious. That is all I can say for the other flavors they didn't really have that artificial taste, they tasted natural. I ended up paying around $10 which isn't too surprising considering it is Vegas and everything is going to be pricey, but it was worth it.

Ciao Ciao is a gelato bar inside The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They have a good number of flavors and many of them appeared to be creative concoctions with lots of ingredients mixed in.  I went with the pistachio and the mascarpone with caramel and both flavors were good.  The gelato was creamy too.

Service was quick and pleasant.

Pricing was very high.  I ordered a medium size and it was $8 before taxes.  While I did not get the gelato at the more famous Jean Philippe in Aria, I think the gelato there was about the same price (maybe even less at Jean Philippe).

Ciao Ciao's gelato was a satisfying frozen dessert.  Pricing was too high though.  Pricing is high for a lot of stuff in Vegas, but I think for the prices you will pay here, you should be able to find more interesting and more well known sweets elsewhere.

Gelato is probably the reasons why most people stop by. The best deal is the $9.99 three scoop in a plastic colorful cup you can keep. The gelato is pretty good and flavorful for a simple treat. They have lots of choices to choose from such as fruity flavors to chocolates. 

The food items are pretty pricey. Hotdogs are long but for about $10 I would rather get something else. Its not even anything special. They also serve alcoholic beverages as well for an average vegas price.

We have all seen workers like the ones they got here. They hate working, they hate their jobs, and they don't have a high regard for customers. When the cashier girl finally decides to get off her lazy ass and slowly walk towards the cash register, she will usually ring up a total that you might believe to be a practical joke. For some reason, there doesn't seem to be anything here that is under $15. 

The Gelato here is horribly overpriced and horribly overrated. You can walk across the street to the Venetian and get gelato there that tastes better and costs 1/4th the price. Even the gelato they have at the Costco in Summerlin tastes better than this overrated sludge, and it only costs $1.50 over there.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,0,0,1,EKYZYov7nhmZobCddkDKfg

1st of all, being this is Vegas, (inside of Caesars) things are going to cost slightly more.. Knowing that I was okay with paying a little more for a caramel latte. I figured, up to $7 tops for coffee is okay.  She asked if i want it cold or hot. I said, cold... but want the ice blended. No problem! 

My husband gave me the receipt right before we got our coffee. When i looked to see they charged us almost $21.00 ($20.52 to be exact) for two coffees.  I almost lost it!  How the heck is that possible?  I saw on the receipt ""Blended (2 @ $1.50)  total $3.00.  So I questioned the cashier. She said they charge an extra  fee to blend their coffee. Really? Why? 

To top it off... the coffee tasted nasty! It was washed down. I tasted mostly crushed ice, with some coffee.  
Starbucks doesn't even charge more then $5.00 for their fancy coffee. How ridiculous is it to pay over $10.00 for disgusting coffee!! 

Very disappointed!",HwIrEW2_zW8r9MV0YYO6kw,5,1,1,-irKB9ksox1e1F5dPQ2Xiw
