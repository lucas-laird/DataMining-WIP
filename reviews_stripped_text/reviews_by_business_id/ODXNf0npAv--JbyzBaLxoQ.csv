877940,2013-07-18,0,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"The food court at Ceasers Palace is a real nice place. It's always clean and they have a great selection of food to choose from. Lobster Chowder Company is not one of those places!  I wanted to try something new and I was disappointed. I ordered a lobster sandwich and I was literally given some kind of seafood salad between two pieces of bread with way to much maionase. It wasn't a cheap meal either so that really made it rough.  What I had tasted nothing like lobster. 
I may have just made the wrong selection but I don't think eating here again is a risk I'm willing to take.  I'm not a fan of having a horrible lunch.",qqtbExz7oQwXwOp0diaqrA,0,0,1,_t4lPfinB5h8utXLdCQOFg
1498552,2012-04-18,0,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"Having tired of spending copious amounts of money on food during our stay in Las Vegas, my friends and I decided to take a walk and try to find something a bit cheaper , eventually ending up in a food court within Caesar's Palace. Although two of my friends had their eyes set on Chinese food, I was drawn into Lobster Chowder Company and their menu of fried seafood goodness.

Although their menu at first appeared to be decently priced, I soon realized that by the time you ordered a drink, a meal quickly shot from $11 to $17, talk about an outrageous price for a fountain drink. Being hungry however, and seeing that my friends had already ordered, I decided to bite the bullet and oder, picking their fish and chips. 

After receiving my food, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I at least received a hearty helping, and that the food was freshly prepared, something I did not expect. However, even the surprising quality of the food cannot make me bump my review of Lobster Chowder Company past two stars. This restaurant is simply too expensive for what you get. This, coupled with the fact that they take absolutely forever to get you your order,",jCvFeBzqaX7uNcfb8PlPig,0,0,2,16SYjB_0i-x4Wi3kYf9_0w

Probably salt and pepper too.  And then blended so there aren't any huge chunks of pickle.  OMG, so delicious.   

I had the lobster roll, which was very nice, but the tartar sauce was the STAR of the meal for sure!!",m91AUk5WdnarnBXuFFBiVQ,1,0,4,lsmwbBu0pdpHYNonPF4_AA
1702662,2013-07-01,1,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"After circling the food court several times I decided to settle for this place.  I had the blackened fish with fries and it was so so.  Granted I knew I was going to a marketplace inside a casino I wasn't expecting a 5 star meal, but like I said I settled for what I thought was the best choice for price and value.  

Fish was okay, wasn't too dry so that was a plus and you can't really go wrong with fries.  

If there was some generic fast food chain here I would have been in line in heartbeat, but didn't work out that way.  

Wouldn't come back here again, would much rather head to the strip and pick up something along the main road. 

PS. Please speed up your menu screens.  I don't need to see the same items on both screens and I don't need to look at the same items for more than 40 seconds.  I takes standing around 2+ minutes just to see all the options before it loops again!",wWXcjHOsACqRyoCT6wKZEQ,0,0,2,X6Va86e2r3SaQZMV_JJ_WQ

- Located in Ceasers Palace food court

2299187,2012-09-28,0,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"So for all you people who love seafood. In Caesars Palace there is this awesome place in the food court... You guessed it the Lobster Chowder Company. The meals are a little pricey but why complain, I mean it is Vegas everything is expensive. My wife, my brother and I ate their fish-n-chips. Probably the best $17.00 a meal I ever spent. The fish was crispy golden brown on the outside tender fleshy on the inside and seasoned to perfection, their homemade tartar sauce was amazing. Fish came with a side of fries and just like the fish perfect not flimsy or soggy like you would find in other places. 
We also tried the Clam Chowder, WOW! Huge chunks of Clams and potatoes creamy goodness served in a perfectly baked and hollowed bread bowl. So if you are ever in the Caesars Palace and you are not sure what you might want to try, check out the Lobster Chowder Company. 2 Thumbs Way Up!!!",1jHLD7x8L7FR8uIPsQGgVw,2,0,5,CTPkB63HBDaBHBS9XgN_dg

Since I hungry and didn't have all day, I decided to try the Lobster Chowder Company that I noticed during my last trip.

Hugely disappointing and very expensive for what you get. I went with the lobster roll with fries. I really don't like fries but they were the only edible thing in my cardboard basket.

The lobster ""salad"" was slop. It was a huge slice of bread with a wet disgusting filling. It might have tasted like lobster but the white filling was soggy and inedible. 

I hightailed it back to Bellagio and treated myself to the chocolate eclair at Jean Phillipe.",0gpFaPgAeR78Cxeo9gd4KQ,1,1,1,gCjA6f59cF-mhBTaMpc2Nw

The fiance saw someone else's chicken tenders and they looked really good so we chose the Lobster Chowder Company. I got the clam chowder in the bread bowl - which looks like you get A LOT more than the cup. The bread is nice and soft and I thought the clam chowder was really good too. I hate crummy clam chowder but I definitely enjoyed it. It also helped that the buslady was such a sweetheart and made our visit pleasant.

3715858,2012-12-21,0,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"We originally had planned to try the new bacchanal buffet at Caesar's for brunch, but once we saw the line and how slowly it moved, we decided to ditch the idea.

We wandered over to the food court. Being that I have been eating clam chowder regularly (not sure why I always have cravings for it nowadays), it was an easy choice for me to want to try the Lobster Chowder Company. As one would expect, it wasn't cheap. But hey, do you really think Vegas would offer anything at a low price?? It was still probably cheaper than the clam chowder you get at the outdoor window at Disneyland, if that's any consolation.

We ordered both the lobster corn chowder and the clam chowder. Both tasted decent and standard -- nothing amazing but it wasn't bad either. I personally thought the clam chowder was better, though it did taste pretty similar to the lobster chowder. The bread bowls were pretty small though compared to bread bowls I've had at other places. However, this is not to say that the portions were tiny -- one bread bowl left me pretty full!  We also ordered a portion of french fries, which turned out to be the crinkly cut kind and boy do they give you a LOT. Volume-wise, the amount of fries was larger than a bread bowl of soup.

We were so pleasantly surprised on how friendly the staff was. They came around table to table asking how we were doing and if we needed anything else. They brought around napkins and toothpicks, without being requested, too! Awesome service, I'd say!",7KsXJ8MvU9VIG78W10s0SQ,0,0,3,sULcHPk4oHATFp--lCyhPA

Of course it is not the best lobster meat ever and it will not remind you of that magical summer you spent on Cape Cod so long ago. It is served on Texas toast drenched with a crispy sheen of butter (which I dig) instead of the traditional split hot dog bun. I thought the salty pile of crinkly fries that came with it tasted fine.  Not my favorite, rosemary dusted pomme frites, but they will do in a pinch. Also they have decent iced tea.",0qxWgeSiFZDp6DQgvwJItA,1,0,3,0F1eBeJozFoksQRJxr7p3A

We ended up at Caesar's and ate lunch at the food court.  I had the Clam Strips and french fries $9.99 ($8.99 if you have a Caesar's rewards card).  

The clam strips were slightly overcooked, but were still edible, so I didn't send them back.  I enjoyed my lunch and the french fries were good.  

I would eat here again if I'm in a hurry.  Please see my pictures.

I was thinking about ordering another dish to go along with the fish and chips. But the cashier recommended the fish and chips is a big enough portion to satisfy my hunger. The fish had the crispy batter yet the meat was moist. The fries on the other hand were crispy but a little too oily. The cashier was right. After eating the fish and chips I was full. It was a decent dinner and a great alternative if you don't want to go to high end restaurants for dinner.,4hVHTZhy70Sw4gmQfk1pJg,1,0,3,iq637SWwR9mOB7O1gF9bUQ
5492288,2013-12-26,5,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"We came here on Christmas after not wanting to wait in a long line at the buffet. I see the word lobster in the title and I was immediately drawn to it. I looked at the menu and I see Lobster Roll and that is what my boyfriend and I both ordered with a side of fries.

Right when we got to our table, two people came by and commented that the lobster rolls looked good and I honestly wished it tasted as good as it looked. I thought it was quite plain , no flavor at all.  By the way, it wasn't served on traditional roll, it was instead, served on thick toasted, buttered white bread. There was more flavor in the bread than there was in the lobster. The fries were just meh, no flavor, and I even had to use ketchup which I don't like using unless I have to.

The place is located in the food court insides Caesers, and you order at the register and wait for your name to be called. If you have a totals rewards card then you save a dollar on every item so I suggest signing up for one which is free to do.",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,10,6,2,jZ8UJRRbSADZpHKv_U4XQQ

5583363,2013-02-11,0,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"I dont know why this place is called the Lobster Chowder Company.  They had neither Lobster Nor Lobster Chowder on the menu.  What they did have was Clam Chowder, Fried Clams, other fried fish options, shrimp salad options and po'boys.  We opted for the Clam Chowder and fried clams.  The cleams come with french fries.  WARNING, as stated in the review for the food court I will write next, the cost of a combo of fries and a fountain drink is $6.00 only  $2 less than the clam meal . T he cost of a drink separately is $4.25a.  More on this later.

The clam chowder comes in a cup or a bread bowl.  We opted for a bread bowl.  Unfortunately they precut them early in the day and the one we had had a very stale top. Barely edible and not good for dipping.  Further, they must have scooped the bread out and used it for something else because the top had no soft bread on it at all and the bowl had a deep whole.  Disappointing.   The chowder had large chunks of potatos and clams but lacked flavor.   

The saving grace was the fried clams.  They had real large pieces of clams in them, not your typicl empty fried coating you get at most food courts.  They tasted excellent and were fried just the way we like them.  Not rubbery either.

The French Fries reminded me of Del Taco's.  Crinkle cut and thick and not too greasy.  Needed salt though, which I guess is good.

The tarter sauce was ok and the cocktail sauce was frozen.

Not bad in a pinch, but  dont expect a cheap meal in the food court especially with the high price of drinks and sides.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,0,1,2,VqRwG18AXNIcBI6iFxTFmA

5765773,2012-05-19,1,ODXNf0npAv--JbyzBaLxoQ,"Long wait for substandard overpriced food.  Saved a lunch just to try them out, particularly their lobster roll.  The lobster roll is served on a buttered brioche bread, not a roll, which just doesn't taste right and is horrible.  The lobster meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery, to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.  The bread is coated with butter and pan fried which produces an oily, sloppy mess.  It's a failure sandwich of disappointment.

Also tried the lobster chowder in the bread bowl, which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.  My friend ordered the shrimp po boy, which was bad as well.  The shrimp was battered and deep fried then served on a hot dog roll and not good at all.  Why they refused to serve the lobster salad on the bread roll I'll never know (we did ask, the chef refused).  

The sandwiches come with fries or coleslaw and you can ""combo"" it for $6 which means add a drink. WTH?  If it comes with fries anyway aren't you just paying $6 for a drink then?  Better strategy would be to go to another spot and order a drink separately since they all come from the same coke fountain anyway.  I ordered a coleslaw because my friend went with fries and got fries anyway.  After the 20 min wait for the food I didn't want to go back and exchange.

Bottom line: walk across the street to Planet Hollywood's LobsterMe instead for good lobster roll.",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,3,1,1,W7lw25ymirh75VJYkdd-Lg
