17530,2015-01-17,1,94EjzQ9cp7iVctFNe0SSsw,"I recently visited wings restaurant and was very pleased with the food and the customer service. The quality and quantity you get for your money is impressive. I ordered the wing combo and it came with 6 decently sized wings with a good amount of meat on the bone, french fries, celery and carrots, dipping sauce and a medium sized beverage. The price was right around $7.00. Other wing restaurants like to charge additional for sides and dipping sauces, so the price for everything came as a shock.  The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied with my meal. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try to satisfy your wings cravings....you will not be disappointed .",lmmN_AtzpHAF3ugQc9nxiw,1,0,5,j0l9hLj7tJHp0LzWypK73A
45537,2012-11-19,0,94EjzQ9cp7iVctFNe0SSsw,"Don't waste your time at this wing place; the sign says best wing in town...umm I think not! My daughter wanted some chicken wings so I took her here since we were around the neighborhood. We ordered a number 2 which came with 15 chicken wings with your choice of 2 flavors (got the Garlic Parmesan and mild), fries and a large drink. The garlic Parmesan was okay and the mild lacked some flavor. The fries were decent they were perfectly seasoned. 

The service was okay considering the fact that there was only one person working and tables needed to be cleaned. There was one table that was clean and that's where we decided to sit. The tables didn't even get cleaned the whole time we were there so if people wanted to eat there they have to request to get the table cleaned.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,5,1,2,qG6OMPPV9bgLhaZRA97ENw

Got the Cajun flavor and it was hot sauce with Cajun sprinkled on top. Not special. When you walk in it was very awkward. No music. No TV. Dead silence. Wasn't greeted until a couple moments. Only one employee. She took the order and cooked it. She was very nice. Just.. So quiet in there. If your going to try this place.

It's almost impossible for me to find a place that does lemon pepper correctly. This place actually coats the chicken in lemon pepper before its fried and after.  So eating it is awesome cause I actually get the Damn lemon pepper.

The veggies are always fresh, but the reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because my bf who loves the wings here also, pointed out 2 things, the isn't very much on flavor and the fries could be a bit seasoned.

All in all the place is amazing though and he only noticed those two things cause he dips his fries in ranch.",KkEgYRaGr4Dmud2TqFyVFQ,0,0,4,UkjV8vwfkII7JPhZmj1AOg

I waited almost 30 mins also I don't even think my wings were cooked all the way I took one bite and refused to eat anymore and threw the rest away also their ranch taste like they bought it from the Walmart across the parking lot.

I ordered the combo meal for $11.99 which comes with 12 wings,fries, a soda and one dipping sauce. Price wise great flavor and texture not so great. My fries were very soft and my wings were soggy(the spicy ones). The garlic parm did not have much flavor or any Parmesan on them at all. Just fried wings with butter melted on them.  I ate some I don't like wasting my food so I will finish later. I will not eat here again and I don't recommend this place either",LP2jRjUoPT4lsyra9a2P1A,2,1,1,T5LZHoEVJdkmJ_3hJ8Qnyg

We got the Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan and Hot &  Sweet wings. The Lemon pepper were the best out of the three.  They had a pretty good flavor to them. The garlic parmesan were pretty plan. Not very garlicky or parmesany. The Hot & Sweet were neither hot or sweet. The wings overall were a bit on the dry side. Maybe a little overcooked. The fries were ok. We also ordered an order of the Funnel Cake fries but the picture looked better than what they really tasted like. Overall, I think I'll get my wings elsewhere.",NPBN9i3MyKLs-bgxcrEjaA,2,0,2,bB_cgMqh3f6Kfv-XNCu2yg

They were forgetful and looked like they were on drugs! One of the guys the forgot one of our fry offers then has the nerve to charge me for an extra ranch and an additional tip which we had already tipped! I have never met someone who pretty much begged for a tip! He just  kept on asking for a tip! Ugh! I will NEVER eat here again! Absolutely horrible customer service and horrible food!

When my husband brought it home he realized that the ENTIRE order was wrong. It was several orders of bone-in teriyaki flavored wings when we had ordered all fingers with several different sauces. We immediately called and explained the situation to the cashier. They took our information and said we could come in any time for a refund or replacement order of the same value. We thought this was great service, but come to find out when we tried to redeem this offer a couple weeks later, we were informed that this was ""not their policy"" and they ""would not honor the offer"" by the manager of this establishment. She was very rude and would not even offer to work with us or compromise.  we will NOT give this place any more business EVER.  terrible customer service is a deal breaker. the food is sub-par in comparison to other wings places.

From the moment we walked in we seemed to be bothering the one and only employee. After drawing some information about the sauces out of him, he took our order but never even looked at us.  Then it was back into the kitchen after handling money, but I didn't see him wash his hands.  

Once the food arrived, the ""Cajun Kicker""wings had no heat to them at all and the ""sweet and spicy"" chicken tenders were bland as well.",otNRht2ljG8beP6NNwwVLg,1,0,1,Qee1Pie6S-xtibOFbXkrUQ

Walked in and the place is dead quiet with no body in sight. A TV was on but no sound. A nice young man came out from the back and was very pleasent. Nothing spectacular. The menu is a bit overwelming. The prices have been changed and re-written over more than once. I was a little confused on what was what so got the number 1 which was 8 wings, fries and a soda (10 bucks). Took 15 mins for the food to cook which was no problem. I''ll wait for fresh food. I took it with me to go and when I got home I realized they are trying to be just like Wing Stop. The fries are exactly the same but the wings are not very good. They seemed freezer burnt when put in the fryer. I got half Cajun half Garlic Parm. The garlic parm had no flavor. Tasted like they were just covered in oil. The Cajun were ok, but nothing special.

3212509,2012-10-27,0,94EjzQ9cp7iVctFNe0SSsw,"Have gotten take-out from here twice.  First time wife brought home wings and fries and I liked them very much.  

I logged onto yelp today to locate a wing place and was dismayed to read all the negative reviews.  They're the closest wing place to my house and I did like the food last time so I decided to give them another shot.

Called in my order and the lady who answered the phone was very nice, and even suggested one of their specials to save me some money when she heard what I wanted.

Arrived 15 mins later to pick up my food.  Two people working, both adults.  The nice lady greeted me with a smile and took my money.  I looked into the kitchen and a gentleman was finishing packaging my food.  I heard him say to the lady 'I wasn't sure what to do with the fries' so I am guessing he is new.  

The service was fine despite all the previous reviews, and I suspect it's because there are new adult personnel working the restaurant.

Brought my food home and was very pleased with the quality.  The wings were perfectly cooked and the Buffalo Hot Sauce was tasty (though not notably hot/spicy).  The fries were excellent, some of the best I've had from a quick-stop place.  I saw a huge bag of potatoes in the kitchen so they obviously cut them fresh.  The season them with something so delicious I ate them with no ketchup; they're that good.  The blue cheese dressing is homemade and mine was flavored with a LOT of garlic; never had blue cheese dressing taste like that but it was quite good and I did use some of it on the occasional french fry.

I will definitely return.  Hopefully the owner/manager has gotten his staff straightened out and the food and service stay as good as I experienced today.",Q2q3swXJRaNhS4CGTy_kzg,1,0,4,xHLUK383Sccl-9uQREeZ4A

They burn the food and even though I've been there several times (the location is very close to where I live) I have never received decent service at this store.  I wonder if the owner even realizes how bad it is.  It will probably go out of business soon.  :(

I strongly encourage people to try the location on Lake Mead & Simmons instead.  They have good service and actually make the wings right!  The seasoned fries are delicious.  If you like spicy, try the Cajun Kickers.  The ranch dressing is delicious.",UIPObNsyeYu-KZe0UmLA0A,0,0,1,OiN9mZUPEk0OG1y_jWkkAQ

Explained the soda machine was broken and they only had lemonade. It was awkward but we ordered, not realizing we both we thinking about ditching this place. 

Once ordered we had to find a seat. Which should have been easy as the place was empty, but the tables were dirty and gross. At this moment we realized we made a mistake. But it was too late. We decided to give it a shot. 

We sat in silence and watched 3 people walk in and immediately leave. We stared in envy as we wished we could have done the same. 

The food arrives and we ate. The fries weren't bad and they gave me a bunch. The wings were okay. I got the normal buffalo and it was a little sweet for a buffalo sauce. 

The whole experience made this trip a 1 star review.  I will not be returning. Plus the lemonade tasted like crap. So I'm really thirsty now. Thanks Wings Restaurant. For nothing.",VsMwT9BTa445fN01-VQpMw,4,0,1,rVDNCuLoN-I9dFRqs6HBwQ
