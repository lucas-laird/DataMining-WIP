14669,2014-08-11,0,lHCwqXdDSmlmqe88WpjeEg,"Looking for something other than fast food for lunch my husband and I stopped in.  Right down the street from his work and just a few streets from mine we figured that we'd have plenty of time to eat and get back to our respective jobs within our hour lunch.  We were wrong.

When you enter there is a sign that instructs you to seat yourself; we did and the server came over within a couple of minutes.  She took our food and drink order and was off; after she dropped off our drinks however, we didn't see her again at our table though we did see her bouncing around to all of the other tables that had also come in.  As time ticked later and later I finally went to the bartender to ask for our check and a box and she shrugged and pointed to the server and then turned and walked away.  I naturally assumed that the woman was a mute but then I heard her speak to a person seated at the bar and realized she simply didn't want to be bothered by someone who wasn't ""her customer"".  

Once I finally managed to get the servers attention it still took a bit before we were able to get out the door.  I don't necessarily blame the server because if she's the only one working that speaks more of an issue with management scheduling than server ability but I can't believe that a manager never came out to help her.  

The food was okay for what it was but I would never go back for the lack of service alone.",OrPRJiHUp89A-TNijEofcg,0,0,1,2TWdip89hm3ur-578DJi8w

I think there's something wrong with that. Isn't the rule $20 equals one drink? Now you want to add in the minimum play rule? Well I still lost my $20?

1099098,2012-04-03,2,lHCwqXdDSmlmqe88WpjeEg,"Normally I don't review chains. Chains are what they are and you know this going in. For example, you go into PT's, you know you're going to get decent food, decent drinks, and at a decent price. You know they're open 24 hours, which is their selling point, and they're all over. So if all of them are the same, it really boils down to their service that determines if they live or die.

This PT's just flatlined.

We came in, were greeted fairly quickly, got our drinks (we didn't have alcohol, we were both a little on the tired side), and placed our orders. Maybe it was because we didn't have alcohol, but the food took a bit of time to come out. Not a HUGE deal.

So my friend and I are talking the soap opera of my life, when we realize we've demolished most of the pizza and our drinks haven't been refilled. The guy hasn't even come by. So we try to flag him down, and it literally takes 20 minutes to get some refills. Annoyed, we wait for the check. After 30 minutes, he finally notices us... then it takes another 15 to get the bill. I wanted to walk out... that kind of wait time is totally unacceptable. Sorry I wasn't boozing it up for once. Sorry I didn't have big ol' tits like the tarts at the bar. But I'm still a paying customer and demand a modicum of respect.

Very nice atmosphere. Bright with nice comfortable chairs. Lots of TVs. Mostly good service, like all places it depends on the day and whose working but we have had more amazing service than poor service. 
This is our go to comfy sit and watch the game and have a few mugs of beer and food we look forward to bar.",aAzs-qxXuRV1iROjfWpTUw,0,1,5,_VY4WiE5SNrmlw8n4D5VzQ

But the main reason I like this particular PT's is that, unlike *other* PT's which are dark, gloomy caves of service industry post-shift misery and alcoholism....this PT's has floor-to-ceiling WINDOWS, letting in lots of natural light and affording an amazing view of the airport runway right across the street.

I find watching planes take off and land to be oddly meditative, and it's very pleasant to sit on the small patio outside this PT's with a drink and some noms while contemplating the mystery of flight. 

On a Friday night, it's especially fun to watch the looooong line of planes stacked up on approach into Vegas, coming in one by one like a never-ending line of lemmings jumping off a cliff into a sea of broke degeneracy. Good luck, suckas!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,2,6,5,96eFOFv2hyITI501gT4Psw

This location has plenty of parking in front of and near the building. The inside of the bar was really clean and smoke free. There was a variety of seating options and we easily found a table that could accommodate our group. 

Our waitress made her way to our table quickly and had drink orders out quickly. We ordered several food items and everyone noted that the food was pretty good that night. I'm not typically a ""bar food"" person, but the food hit the spot. We had Fried Pickles, The Gilroy Pizza, Nachos, and Chicken Strips.

I told the server, she did apologize and offered to have them redone....hahaha, not in a million years was I sending my plate back or having them make something new.

I came here because I was short on time and it was close, next time I will go to another location that I know they have a clear understanding on how to prepare food.

It is sad because the staff here is amazing, the Bartendar, the servers all great people, they just need a better cook....",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,6,1,2,cThKL8Y1Qy-obVTYwrlC4w
4674129,2016-05-17,0,lHCwqXdDSmlmqe88WpjeEg,"Every time I walk into a PT's i don't know what to expect as they are each somewhat different. Came here to watch a basketball game and had a good time. The happy hour menu is similar to all other PT's where they served fried food for cheap. Certain premium liquor cocktails are priced at 6.25 during HH, and beers are in the 4 dollar range. 

This PT's was nicely decorated with a lot of new furniture, there are little private lounge sections and there are TV's in there as well. Pool tables are also available for rent if one wished to play. One thing though, was that the TVs at the bar were quite small. Mostly 32 and 40 inches, which can be considered a computer monitor size in 2016.

Another plus is when it is gametime, they put the game's audio throughout the place, rather than music, so it makes it even better if you're trying to catch a sports event.

Our bartender was quite attentive as she was in charge of the whole bar, although it was kind of a quiet evening. As for food, we ordered the Nachos and a entree salad, and both were well made. The nachos here are very good and the salad.. well a salad is a salad (Classic Cobb). 

Another thing I need to mention is the ventilation in this place, it is very strong. To those complaining about second hand smoke, may I remind you that this is a tavern. People smoke at taverns. The ceiling is high enough and the ventilation is strong enough where smoke shouldn't be too much of a matter if one is not extremely sensitive to smoke. If you were, you shouldn't be in a tavern in the first place.

I will simply say, I will return.",3gX0SnispHbO2QRdGipt0g,0,0,4,N1KhPzEUPvq2cpRy-7HLGg
5042272,2012-10-25,0,lHCwqXdDSmlmqe88WpjeEg,"This location is by far, one of the nicest PT's Pubs I've been to.  It's in an odd industrial, airport runway across the street-like, location, but I look at it as a gem in the middle of town :)  We came here tonight to celebrate the move of a dear friend.

When you walk in, you are reminded that the bar is and will always be the center focal point of this location.  The lighting is elegant and the smell of cigarettes isn't overpowering.  There's ample seating all around the bar and tables around the restaurant.  We took our party in a small nook in the middle of the restaurant, equipped with TVs and a fireplace.  Super cozy.  

I enjoy their tall drafts of beer.  It's about 5 dollars and for me, lasts a long time.  For the party, we were treated with wings, fries and a pizza.  The pizza was a buffalo chicken pizza and the wings and fries were covered in Parmesan cheese. The bone in wings were somewhat crispy, somewhat soft.  Garlic Parmesan offered a lot of flavor and so were the fries.  I loved the pizza soo much!  Imagine having buffalo wings but in the form of a pizza.  So much flavor.  Little bit of spice, little bit of tang, little bit of heaven.  

If you're in the area, you should take a little stroll and visit this PT's.  If you're ever familiar with PT's, which if you're local, you probably are, then you will love this location.  Although PT's is a chain bar restaurant, this location is one that will impress above the others.  Enjoy!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,0,0,4,EZHfSyle1Yd8irm5ZCzlTg

5312766,2015-07-20,2,lHCwqXdDSmlmqe88WpjeEg,"Nooooo bueno. This isn't my usual PT's location and this was my first time here. We came on a Friday around midnight (for happy hour). It was a coworkers going away get together so there was a about 10 or so of us there. For some reason there was just one bartender there that night. Not sure if they were understaffed or if that's how they usually run things.

I initially felt bad for the guy. Handling everyone's orders by himself was probably driving him nuts, so I made sure that I was thee NICEST customer to him. 

I can understand being frustrated with everyone trying to wave you down when you're doing a million other things, but rolling your eyes at people when they stack up their order cuz they don't wanna waste another 45 minutes during happy hour to wait for you to make your way back around our side of the bar again is really uncalled for. What else does he expect? I was only able to get 2 orders in the whole time I was there and only 1 of those orders was under happy hour prices. It was 2:06 by the time he got around to me again. I ordered 2 beers and 4 four horsemens. And he said ""Just to let you know, the shots are gonna be $12 a shot since it's not happy hour anymore."" 

Um are you kidding me? What'd you want me to do 7 minutes ago? Go to the other side of the bar and scream at you just so I can get my order in before happy hour ends just for you to unkindly roll your eyes at me like you did to everyone else? Lose-lose situation I guess.

Bottom line--1 star based 100% on the service that night.

It wasn't busy when I went in on a Saturday evening to watch the Oregon Ducks vs Kansas basketball game. For some reason its listed as a Ducks bar, but it is not. Per the manager/bartender, they don't even get the Pac-12 sports package. 

I only sampled the rib tips appetizer and it was decent. Cocktails were good, and strong. Unlike other PT's, I had one drink comped for my $20 in play. Happy hour prices from 4-7pm I believe.
