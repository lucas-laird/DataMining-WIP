This is directly going towards the Bartender Sean. What else can I say? WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I seriously don't know how management would hire douchebags like this for their company. This is coming from a person who works in the industry as well!

Went in to have a few drinks and some dessert at the bar with a couple of my friends last Thursday before a movie. Sat at the bar and waited for literally 2 mins before someone actually gave us menus after looking at us for a bit. So this guy Sean comes and drops off the menus, no greeting whatsoever, no offering of water whatsoever. He left and went to chit chat with one of his buddies behind the bar. My girlfriend had to get his attention for him to bring us waters.

Waters come in, asks ""You guys know what you want?"" One of my friends tells em not yet and he just gave this look on his face like ""WTF, hurry up"" so he leaves like hes in distress and does not come back for about 5 minutes after we were trying to indicate him that we were ready to order!

SERIOUSLY?!

This is what pissed us off the most. We were halfway through our food and my friend got his attention because she thought I needed something, so this douchebag Sean comes up to us and asks ""What, you needed something?"" with his hands up in the air, like we wasted his time from leaving him his conversation with his buddies to actually work and helping us out, like come on F*cking SERIOUSLY?!?!

I am very dissapointed with this Yardhouse location as I am a regular customer at the Town Square location. I will not be returning to this location as well as not referring anyone to this place for as long as Sean is there. Seriously you get better customer service in night clubs then at this place. I hope management stumbles upon this review and take action because I am still pissed at how this d*ck treated me and my friends. 

Don't come here if you want to be treated like shit basically. Upper Management please do something about this immediately.",LTD2NAIin8vBRFHv9CKrfw,3,0,1,q1hKHxFMZVSdUcR3LpzGtg

We usually go to the location on Las Vegas Blvd, but we had some family in town so we thought we would try the Red Rock location.  Needless to say the service was sooo horrible last night, my family and I will never be back to Yard House in the future.  Which is disappointing since we really enjoy the food & the atmosphere is nice.  Las Vegas is a service industry town, so you expect to get at least decent service... especially with soo many restaurant options.

I would not recommend anyone go to the Red Rock location.  We had a party of 8 so I understand sometimes there are challenges with larger parties but waiting an hour & a half just to get our food is a bit ridiculous.  Our beverages were empty most of the night, our server never checked on us and not once acknowledged the fact that we had waited sooo long to get our food.  We would try to get her attention and she would walk past us.  When our food finally did arrive, we had asked for a few items such as refills on beers & drinks as well as something simple like tarter sauce for the fish & chips... which our server never brought us.  At the end of the night we mentioned how unpleasant the service was to the manager and he didn't seem to care.  I guess they are not too concerned with making their customers happy.

This was the best turkey burger I have ever had.  I would definitely order it again.

Ol' Ben would have DUG the Yard House. 

I was staying Red Rock, didn't want to leave the cool atmosphere and met some friends who were locals. The Yard House didn't disappoint. I started salivating at the hundred plus kegs at the entrance. I knew right then and there, I was home. 

Dig on the sizes of the beers. You can get an eight ounce sampler, a regular pint. or this massive glass. I stuck with the eight ounce and pints and traveled around the world with beer. Japan. Belgium. Australia. The US. Come on, I had to have me some PBR. I'm a Midwestern boy. 

Service was top notch. Scott was our waiter's name. You know how to tell a good server? They don't talk down to kids. They treat them like customers. And that's what he did. Our kids (who behave in restaurants, yeah, I'm a proud Dad, I gotta give 'em some props) were treated well by Scott. 

The winner at the table was Jambalaya Pasta. I had entree envy over it. It was perfect. My salad was fresh (I had to offset the beer calories somehow!) and while small, it was good. Tzvi got fish and chips. He always does. He digs it. And he said this was one of the best he's had. 

This place is perfect if you're at Red Rock, wiped out from swimming, don't want to leave the resort, have kids and want a nice, cold beer. 

And it was like, 112 degrees that day. Perfect beer drinking weather! 

Next time I'm in LV, I'll probably be back.",SJjW-Uat5Z3JIPwktHtmKA,0,0,4,OMNm0XvAYTxiGjBxFHVi-g

They refilled our drinks regularly, checked if our food was good, and made sure my guests and i were doing well.

423458,2011-04-06,0,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"I don't think I would have ever tried this place if someone hadn't given us a gift card, but I am so glad I did!  

Looking in from the outside, it's not my kind of place.  I don't drink, so a big, noisy and crowded bar and a restaurant known for their beer selection didn't really appeal to me. But like I said.... we had gift card, so hubby and I gave it a shot.

We've been TWICE now, and I have been extremely impressed both times.  

The first time we sat on the patio, which was really nice and comfortable.  It was a little chilly that day, so I was worried it would be too cold, but the hostess was really nice and let us go out and see how it felt before committing to an outside seat.  It turned out to be just fine because they have little space heaters out there which worked perfectly.

On a Yelp recommendation, we ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer (or a ""snack,"" I think they called it).  They were delicious, but we found out later that if your entree comes with fries, you can upgrade them to truffle fries (as well as garlic fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings) for just a dollar more, and you get a TON of fries -- way more than you get for the $4 ""snack"" portion -- so if you're interested in trying them, I would go that route instead.

Anyway, the hubs went for his favorite thing on earth - Mac n Cheese - and he was not disappointed.  I tried a bite of it and I had to agree it was pretty darned tasty.  I went for the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and I have to say... that was the most delicious grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  That's some big words, cuz I've had some pretty good grilled cheeses in my time!  

About halfway into it, though, I started to feel my arteries clogging and as I looked at the small puddle of oil collecting on my plate, I was feeling really guilty about how much i was enjoying it.  I think they must have slathered each slice of bread with a full stick of butter and then used about 2 pounds of thick-cut, full-fat cheese.  No WONDER it tasted so good! I was pretty happy that their dessert menu is crappy because I wasn't even the least bit tempted to order some more fattening food.

On our visit #2, we took an inside seat, which was still nice, but very loud.  If you're on a date, I would suggest taking the patio seating, which seemed a bit more quiet.  But be warned... even THAT is loud.  This isn't a quiet restaurant by any means.

This time we started out with the lobster/crab/artichoke dip.  Another good choice.  The husband got some kind of monster-sized burger with garlic fries (here's where we found out about the ""upgrade"") and I got the crab cake sandwich with onion rings.  Nothing bad to say about any of that!!

I feel like the price is good for the quality of food and the level of service you receive here.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees on each visit, and both times the bill came out to about $40-$45 with tip.  Well worth it for our fabulous meals and some leftovers to eat the next day.

So when I received my salad I was surprised because it was a completely different setup. When I asked what it was she said, ""it's your salad, like I was stupid"". I told her that's not how it usually comes and said that they had changed the menu a few months ago. She didn't offer to make it a different way or the old way and after her rude and off putting attitude I just told her I didn't want it. She then runs off with it and doesn't ask if I want something else until I had to ask her. A manager never came by the table to check on us. Our beers sat at the well forever and were warm by the time we got them. Yard House has gone down hill service wise. The food we had was decent, nothing really good.

Add to the joy, the fans and misters were off. When I asked why, I was told they were broken. 5 min after complaining to the manager, fans and misters are turned on.

I've come to just accept that every Yard House everywhere will always be packed and crowded! Getting a drink at the bar can be just as bad as getting a drink at the bar at a nightclub. Luckily for my party of 10, we had reservations. The host told us it was a 2-Hour wait if we didn't! The music they play is pretty cool, but WAAAAYY too loud! You have to yell and read lips just to have a conversation with the person sitting right next to you! I'm all for a good vibe with good music, but please turn it down a notch or 3!!! 

The food here is just okay. Granted, I haven't tried many things on the menu, but the sliders and fries I ordered came out kind of cold. I would compare the food to maybe B.J's across the street. It's just OKAY. But, the food does go well with the alcohol you'll be drinking! The only drink I order from here is their Framboise. You gotta try it! It's kind of a raspberry flavored beer that doesn't really taste like beer but probably a girly version of it. Regardless, the Framboise...get it! SO GOOD! 

The service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was kind enough to ask us if we would like separate checks before taking our order, and was able to do it for us. Almost all waitresses hate doing separate checks, but thank goodness she offered it with a smile!

We got our pager and we were told it works throughout the casino. (And even if we misheard, no need for the attitude we received.) We then sat out, not 10ft away, and played some games. We got a ring in our pager and went into the restaurant. One hostesses said, ""I'm sorry that was a mistake."" To which my fiancé replied, ""what was?""  Then two women behind he counter decided to become some sort of Anti-costumer employees and said, ""UM WE BUZZED YOU 6 minutes ago, and after three minutes we go to the next person."" 

Ok couple things. 1) only buzzed once. 2) you work in a service industry. So did I got a long LONG time. Never once have I considered be so disrespectful, even to the MOST miserable costumer.

I live in the area (for over 10 years) and eat out all of the time.... Busy schedule, always with clients and I can comfortably take any of my clients here. From the t-shirt tech guy to the established elitist.... there is something there for them.

I've been everywhere in Summerlin and for price, service, an extensive menu and overall consistency -- Yard House is the best place to go without having to break the bank.

The food is always good.... the service is always great. From Business Lunches to Late Night Debauchery -- we always have a good time.

The only thing I can think of complaining about after 20+ visits is that sometimes it gets really, really busy and the wait for a table or to even find a couple of places at the bar can be long.... but that's certainly not Yard House's fault. (Open up another one in Summerlin!)

I'll breakdown our experience chronologically for fun.  We were seated and given our HUGE menus.  Seriously, they are huge, the size of a photo book, half of it listing the drinks.  We carefully reviewed the Gardein and other vegetarian and vegan options before I decided on the Firecracker Gardein Buffalo Wings and an order of Truffle Fries minus the Parmesan.  BF ordered the vegetarian mushroom and pepper street taco plater.  I ordered their house Blonde and he ordered the Sam Adams Octoberfest beer.

Beverages were delivered right away, but his was not correct.  A few minutes to get our server's attention for a correction but soon enough, the Octoberfest made its way to the table.  Shortly after that, the Buffalo Wings, Street Tacos & Truffle Fries are delivered and we are both dissappointed (but not surprised) by the small size of portions verses the large prices charged for them.  

Truffle Fries - pretty good.  Served warm, nice seasoning, small hint of truffle oil and without the Parmesan as requested.
Tacos - okay.  A few vegetables grilled on a flat top served on a 4 or 5 inch corn tortilla (seriously the smallest at the grocery store is 6 inches, can't that be the normal?) sloppily sprinkled with queso fresco.  Served with a scoop of rice that appeared to be seasoned but tasted blah and a small dish of undrained pinto beans topped with cheese.  Save the additional $2 or $3 dollars for the rice & beans and order the tacos ala carte.
Buffalo Wings - fried goodness.  The coating was a nice balance to the chick'n inside and the sauce was flavorful.  Although, I'm not positive that I had the Firecracker sauce, rather than just a sweet tasting one.  It was not spicy at all.  

Our server stepped away on break, but introduced us to her colleague but then we got thirsty.  Beverages were empty, several sightings of replacement server without inquiry about another round.  Stopped eating food so we could order another beverage but it took several more minutes.  Received another round, but wanted to get the check since the food prices were high and the beers were $6.50 each!  Can't afford to stay too long on those prices.  The check had the incorrect beer on it plus the 2 we each consumed.  Flagged down our server, and before I could say anything about the check, beer, extra charge, etc., she made mention of the extra beer and went to correct the check.  So...is that standard practice?  Not to remove a mistake and hope the guest does not review the bill?  Maybe she was psychic?  Sketchy.

$55.08 plus tip and that was all our wallets could stand.  Even if we never return I do not expect the Yard House's bottom line to be hurt, The place was super busy and was not slowing down as it approached dinner time.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,0,0,3,JTljW1tcnjiHhkzdEUoM2g

When we got there we were told there would be a 25 -30 minute wait although there were plenty of open tables on the patio.  We decided to stay and the 30 minute wait only ended up being like 10 minutes. 
We were seated and then started checking out the menu. 
Drinks were in order so we perused the drink menu, Our waiter came up and requested our drink order..

::::::MAJOR PROPS:::::::  to our waiter for carding me and Michele- being ::cough::43::cough::  that was quite the ego boost! 

and JD is kind of a beer connoisseur so he got some fancy schmancy kind of beer which I can't even remember the name of ... I decided on the Pear Cider. 
Let me just clarify that I  my choice ROCKED! 
It was light and delicious .. LOVED IT!
Michele chose the Raspberry Cider and it was good too.

We all ordered and JD chose the southern fried chicken, Michele the parmesan crusted chicken and me ? I chose a turkey club sandwich with french fries. 

Our meals came , and I was totally sad I did not get the southern fried chicken because it looked amazing!
My meal looked amazing too so I really wasn't THAT sad.
Michele was sad because he brought her the wrong dish. So she had to wait a little bit, I shared my fries in the mean time.  oh it was also a good reason for another pear cider.  JD ordered an Arrogant Bastard Ale.   

Michele's meal finally came and she was excited to dig in, and it was delicious.

The portions were large so left overs were even better. 

All in All a great meal.. just one star down for the wrong meal delivery...

We were seeing a 9:50 movie and popped into Yard House around 6:30 PM on a Friday night to grub and drink. The wait was not too bad, and with the bar and sports on TV it went by even faster. The bartenders were friendly and quick, and my Longboard Ale did not disappoint. Mmmmm, beeeeeeeeer. 

Once seated we decided on the Lobster Crab Artichoke Dip as an appetizer. Personally I like this with the Pita wedges so I think they need to 86 the chips on the plate and add more Pita! I highly recommend this appetizer, it's one of our favorites! 

For dinner we decided to try something new. Going off positive Yelp reviews I chose the Jambalaya on Jasmine Rice. My husband went with the Chicken Garlic Noodles. We were both happy with our meals, good flavor, cooked properly, all the basics. I've never had a bad meal at Yard House so this was no surprise to me. If we have to choose, my Jambalaya was the better of the two (Katie FTW, yet again!). 

I love bringing a large group to Yard House, we came here for my pre-bachelorette party dinner :) and that was yet again another great Yard House experience. 

I recommend Yard House for quality food and beer, it is consistent, family or large group friendly and they have a large, diverse menu.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,2,0,4,NHnHhxcuR1a1Rg70AQP4jA
974995,2013-05-31,4,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"Saturday night and we had plans to meet another couple at Yard House for dinner and drinks.  We were seated right away at a high top table close to the bar and kitchen entrance.  Pretty busy area to say the least.

We were greeted by a nice young guy to take our drink orders.  We all ordered beer.  My girlfriend and I always order Coors Light and Bryce (our server) gave us a hard time being that we were at the ""Yard House"" ordering a domestic beer. haha  He recommended the light beer which I went with and I must say it was pretty darn good.  My BF on the other hand ordered a raspberry beer (a girly foofoo beer I guess. haha).  With that said, it was the focus on the rest of the night because our dear server Bryce was not going to let him live that down.  (read on)

As we went over our menus Bryce brought the BF a kids menu (hence the beer reference).  So you know its going down at this point.  It's on son! LOL  That followed by a straw in BF's beer when he wasn't looking...totally crackin-up-classic.  So silly.
 
VARIETY is where its at on this menu.  Huge assortments of food and drinks....what more could you want to satisfy a craving for a fab Saturday night out.  I had beer, sushi and Italian all in one sitting.  How's that for variety. Amen!

Run Down:
Appetizer the California Roll: - It is huge, great to share, totally delish. It is literally  one piece of a sushi roll-but times 10 in size topped with snowcrab and avacado...a definite must try.
Me - Penne with chicken, mushrooms, asparagus, sundried tomatoes in a cream sauce - Never ever a disappointment (definitely not a dish for the diet)
BF - Orange Peel Chicken - Total Yum.  He gets it all the time and loves it.

To end the meal Bryce brought over a to-go kids cup in case BF wanted to take his drink with him (not for real because Im not sure you can do that). haha  What a delight Mr. Bryce was.  He definitely has that something special to add to customer service.  I hope his manager takes notice!  We will be back hoping to get his table again.

Anyways, food and ambiance are always amazing.  They have a cool outdoor patio with TVs which is definitely fun watching your favorite teams play.  Anything we have ordered on this menu has been consistently perfect.  I do think that the mac&cheese is one of my favorite dishes and the hummus is yummy too.  The service is always good.  This is a regular stop for us and we will be back soon for sure.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it....hey it is FRIDAY!!! ;)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,6,4,5,StSUP21uFKqH8HaXMZDSVw

975760,2014-06-06,0,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"I've been here twice, so this is a combined rating of both experiences.

The first time I went was in April at 6pm with my girlfriend. The  I ordered the the Chilled Edamame, Grilled Sweet Korean BBQ Beef and a half portion of the Ahi Crunchy Salad. I also ordered a glass of pinot noir and a large bottle of sparkling water. I can't recall what my friend ordered, so I'm only going to write about my experience. Our waitress seemed friendly enough, however she spoke so fast, that it was difficult to understand her. After we placed our order, we didn't see her for almost 20 minutes. A runner delivered my friend's drink and my sparkling water, however, the pinot noir was no where to be found. Then the edamame came out and my friend's appetizer, still no wine. We asked another waiter (not ours bc we still couldn't find her) if they could check on my wine. Our next courses came out -- Korean BBQ Beef, which was hot and tender with great sweet and tangy flavor and the white jasmine rice was hot and the perfect stickiness.  We started to eat, but I wanted to have my wine with my meal, so I ate slowly. 10 minutes later, I had to ask yet another waiter about the status of my wine, and they went to find our waitress, who finally brought my wine 15 minutes later. The Korean BBQ Beef was still good though, even though it was cold from waiting for the pinot noir. My salad came out shortly after by yet another waiter, then our original waitress came by and said that she was transitioning our table to another waiter since she was going on break, which was laughable bc to us, she had been on break for 45 minutes. Our new waitress asked us if we wanted to order dessert, which I did, a scoop of caramel ice cream. My GF also placed a take away order for her husband to bring home, so I assumed that while we waited for his food, the waiter would bring out my dessert. But instead, they brought out my dessert when they brought out his take away food. So I had to eat my ice cream really fast so the take away food wouldn't get cold.

The second time I went to  YH was on Sat night during Memorial Day Weekend. The place was packed so we got put on the wait list, and then went to the bar. Fortunately, 2 seats opened up at the bar, so we decided to eat at the bar instead, which was good for me bc I knew that my drink would come out much faster than the time. Our bartender was friendly and took our beverage order right away while we looked at the menu. We both had Stellas and then we ordered the Onion Rings Tower and Hummus to start. The food came out pretty quickly and the onion rings were nice, crispy and hot, but the hummus was runny and slimy and had a weird after taste, so we didn't finish that dish. I had liked the Korean BBQ Beef dish the first time, so I ordered it again for my main, while my husband ordered the Spicy Jambalaya with Brown Rice. That food came out in a timely manner, however, my dish was very disappointing and my husband's came out with white rice, so they took it back. Instead of replating it, they scooped out the white rice and put brown rice on the same plate, which was now a total mess. My husband was so hungry and didn't want to wait, that he ate it anyway, but we both couldn't believe that it didn't get replated. I was really looking forward to my dish bc it was so good the first time, however, this time, the beef was dry, much smaller pieces, almost shriveled and lacking any of the juicy flavor from last time and the rice was also dry and cold. I was hungry, so I ate it anyway. I was afraid to send it back bc it could've been worse, especially after what happened to my husband's dish when he sent it back. Our bartender asked us if we wanted dessert and I told her we wanted the caramel ice cream and she said that they didn't have it. She told me that I must be mistaken, bc it's not on the menu. I told her that I had it last time in April, and she said that they didn't, but instead, recommended the salted caramel butterscotch pudding. We ordered that instead, and we're glad we did bc it was quite good. Still annoying though that she said that they didn't have caramel ice cream bc I just checked the menu online and there it was - 

ICE CREAM
vanilla, caramel, mango sorbet, java chip, mint chocolate chip

When you point out that you haven't even had a sip yet, and they are demanding payment in full , they say its their policy.
At any other (non corporate) bar, this would be the height of insulting unfriendliness. In addition, most cards have high limits (I think mine is 20k) . So if I were a thief, they would be on the hook for a few beers, but if anyone in their bar is dishonest, I'm on the hook for 20k!

The restaurant has much more space than town square with higher ceilings and bigger outdoor patio seating. Not to mention flat screen TVs around to watch them sports. 

The food here is great. These are my top picks on the Appetizer menu:
Fried Calamari** (I'm a typical Filipina so you cannot NOT try calamari).
Hawaiian Poke Stack** (De-lish! It's fresh ahi with crispy wontons, carrots, bean sprouts, avocado, and wasabi soy sauce).
Spicy Tuna Roll ** (This is not a cut roll. This is like one round giant roll. But yummy. Has seared rare ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber, and the wasabi soy sauce). 

My favorite Entree salad is the Ahi Crunchy. It has seared rare ahi, Asian slaw, field greens, crispy wontons mixed in soy vinaigrette. I feel like I could go on forever on all the yummy entrees they have. They have everything from burgers to steaks, to pastas and seafood dishes. Which is a plus for me because I need OPTIONS, so having selections to choose from, I can pick depending on my mood of the day.

I am so glad that Yard House is much more closer to me, even for locals in the Summerlin area. I don't have to drive to Town Square and worry about the annoying one lane conversion once you exit Las Vegas Blvd off the 215. GIVE ME A SNAKE BITE PLEASE!!!",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,5,5,4,UlgJqjVhc7QXFcLJbhxS2Q

I had the Southern Fried Chicken Breast, which was really yummy comfort food.  I also tried the Pepper crusted Filet - the filet was very good, cooked exactly as I ordered it, very tender and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes & veggie was also very good.  My brother tried the Carnitas Street Tacos one time, and the Chicken Enchilada Stack another time - and he said they were both excellent as well.  The service was very nice as well - the staff were all friendly and waited on us right away.  The food arrived promptly, and the server checked back often.  Looks like a great place for Happy Hour as well, with a very large bar - a great place for drinks and they have a large selection of small plates, snacks and appetizers.",x7b_X7RGXds47C3BKdJbXA,0,0,5,drnHxdYeWe_WFyW6R_Nafw

Chicken Nachos: chicken was so dry you could barely chew it, like it had been sitting under the salamander for an hour, cheese was cold and rubbery, the only fresh food on the plate was the guac and the sour cream. 

Coconut shrimp: Over deep fried as they were practically black and what's with the plating? You can't spare a little more sauce? I mean it's just drizzled on the plate with some sort of veggie sticks.  

The real disappointment was the famous spinach artichoke dip that I used to love, but now it's a smaller portion and the taste was forgettable. 

The place was not packed for a Sunday afternoon, but the service was slow. Took nearly 45 minutes to get app's, had to send the chicken strips and fries back because it was cold, and wait another 20 minutes for a cup of chicken noodle soup that our guest didn't have time to eat and left.  Waitress was polite but seemed distracted, so the service suffered, but overall I wouldn't go back because it's all about the food, and the food was not good.

Living in Vegas gives you the opportunity to have many great dining experiences and I think that for the prices The Yard House is asking, they could get their act together on simple bar food.",FgpEsFKtv765Q50w9OtpTg,2,1,1,R-IR-4ZoYDYqx1h7zphDSw

- POKE NACHOS ($12.75): Marinated raw ahi tuna on top of crispy wonton crips, in a sweet soy, siracha aioli and white truffle sauce -- topped with avocado, cilantro, serranos, green onions, sesame seeds & nori seaweed strips. (Just do yourself a favor & get this!)
- LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE ($25.75): A generous amount of lobster & pasta with sundried tomatoes, asparagus, wild mushrooms with cheddar cheese, parmesan & truffle oil. (Was skeptical to order this because of the price... but wow. The value is so worth it! Such a mouth orgasm, and I was impressed by the amount of lobster they put!)
- BLACK TRUFFLE CHEESEBURGER ($12.85): A thick patty with house made truffle cheese, a flavorful tomato-bacon-onion jam, with a side of fries. (Substituted for sweet potato fries for a $1.00 charge. Had cooked medium rare and added lettuce & tomato.)

We have been here 10+ times and have liked everything we've ever ordered, so I have to say two thumbs up. The Seared Ahi Sashimi has a great complexity to it, I'll save the description of the flavors to the Bourdain Types but it seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

With regard to the beers, try the ever rotating list of short-termers that are posted on the screen above the bar, they keep a nice variety flowing through there and some of them have been absolute winners. If you are a fan of IPAs this place has a selection that is incredibly diverse, and you should try the Double Daddy, it is SICK.

One of my fave parts of this restaurant/bar is the gardein options for all vegans or vegetarians.  Their jerk chicken gardein option is beyond delicious and flavorful.  I must find the recipe to share for Football Sunday with my veggie friends.  The same goes for their Buffalo Wings and Firecracker Wings.  SOOOO good!  I think they're WAY better than actual wings and the flavor is so on point that I will most likely only eat gardein wings moving forward!

I've tried several things on the menu that weren't just vegetarian friendly and haven't been let down since.  I'd name them all, but, who's got the time for all that?

The turkey burger had many more extras added into the meat (veggies and such) than I had at the other location. Maybe it was a fluke, maybe not. My turkey burger was also missing arugula. The menu did look the same as the Linq location... however the service was a little off... but not enough to keep me from coming back to enjoy some tasty beers on that lovely patio!

We also ordered an Ahi tuna stack and we got that before I got my iced tea. It was kinda annoying because I was super thirsty. A couple minutes after we got our appetizer my iced tea finally came. It kinda tasted off though, like a diet iced tea, bleh. I ended up just drinking water for the rest of the time we were there. 

The Ahi stack was ok. The tuna was good, the wontons tasted like they were fried in old oil though and there was just a huge amount of daikon and carrots that were pretty bland. The sauce on the plate was a really gross brownish green color that wasn't very pretty. It was a wasabi soy sauce, it tasted good though, not too overpowering.

I will get the obvious out of the way first, this is a chain in most suburban western region markets and thanks to the hard floors and being inside of a casino it is very, very loud at night, especially on the weekends. It is also worth mentioning these guys bust Classic Rock all day, everyday. 

The menu features standard American fare that offers little in surprise but what they do offer is better than it has any right to be, particularly their burgers. My personal favorite is the Pepperjack Burger that features roasted green chiles, pepper jack cheese and garlic aïoli on a grilled bun. The Black Truffle Cheese Burger (boasting house made truffle cheese, no less) and Béarnaise Burgers are also admirable, especially a few beers into the night. All burgers are accompanied with a decent helping of Fries and Yard House seems to get the cooked temperature right every time. Another stand out item is their French Onion Soup boasting a perfectly melted cheese and robust onion broth. 

These guys also have an exemplar Happy Hour Menu offering an Ahi Poke Bowl, Ceviche and Truffle Fries that I can vouch for at very reasonable prices. The service has always been up to snuff both at a table or bellied up to their gigantic bar. 

Which brings us to their best asset; the nearly 200 beers constantly on tap. If you are an adventurous beer drinker, it is pretty damn tough to beat this selection. Every imaginable craft brewery from Coast to Coast and across the ponds seem to be offered. Naturally, this makes the Yard House a great place to catch a sporting event.

I had a couple of beers that were good.  Barkeeps were friendly and on top of things.  Everyone loves Olivia.  That happens when you're attractive, friendly, and bring glasses of beer to people.

One complaint, I ordered a second beer just before the end of happy hour.  The beer was brought then the beer was added to my tab.  I looked at the tab, I missed the happy hour price by 1 minute.  But the order was put in a couple of minutes before the order was entered on the computer.  There should be some push back on that, or servers should know to ring up the order first.

My lady and I were actually excited to try YardHouse for the first time. The menu looked attractive and plus it's inside of my favorite casino resort Redrock Station. Unfortunately the experience was poor as soon as we walked through the door. We were first greeted by a gentleman that said we had to see somebody else to be seated. I really couldn't understand what he was saying. We ask him where do we go, and instead of him giving us proper directions or better yet walking us to where we needed to go, he just randomly pointed and stated ""down there"". So we decided we would figure it out and proceeded to walk, trying to stop someone for directions. Once we got to the waiting area we were told it's a 20 minute wait. The wait was more like 30 minutes but we were so excited to eat here we didn't mind at all. When we were finally taken to our seats our table was across from the kitchen directly in front of the main entrance. We definitely do not like trying to enjoy a meal with constant servers and customers passing us and hearing the commotion of the kitchen, so we asked to be seated at a booth, the young lady replied with broken english ""it's up to the boss"". My lady and I both looked at each other in disbelief. I was so shocked that I ask the server again and she actually said it again but this time with a long and awkward explanation. She took us back to the waiting area and it looked like the conversation she had with ""the boss"" seemed to irritate ""the boss"". ""The boss"", who's name tag read Allessa, was irritated to the point that she scratched our names from the top of the waiting list, put our names at the bottom and practically threw the pager at my lady with no eye contact or explanation as to what was going on. I ask her do we have to wait again and I received no response. So I switched up the question and ask how much longer is the wait and she answered ""about 5 minutes"". While waiting outside for about 15 minutes we wondered into Lucilles Bar-B-Q, which is literally about 10 steps away. We really weren't in the mood for barbecue plus the menu was a little more pricier than YardHouse, but the staff was so friendly and welcoming we considered it. We went back outside to wait but after about 25 minutes we returned the pager and told the ""the boss"" aka Allessa that we were leaving. What's even worse is that her attitude basically said good ridden. Something like that could definitely ruin your night especially when you have high hopes of a great experience. My lady and I ended up waiting an hour to be seated at Lucille's barbecue but the wait was well worth it! In my line of work I have to give not just excellent but perfect customer service, otherwise I don't generate income. It's highly unfortunate that a reputable establishment such as Yard House would have employees representing the business in that manner.

With a large group you never really know how the waiter will handle things.  Luckily we had a great guy who really made it welcoming for each and every one of us.  He made it a point to make a personal experience while you were dining.  It was wonderful.  

Our table shared some Queso with Chorizo to start.  It's served with tortilla chips as well as pita bread. Rich in flavor and great to share.  I would definitely add the chorizo every time. Our turkey sandwich was great.  The swiss & fontina cheese accompanied with the avocado and jalapeño spread made this sandwich so delightful!  A turkey sandwich with a little kick is always good!  The BBQ chicken pizza was good but nothing over the top. I would suggest ordering one of their other pizzas or menu items.

For lunch I had the Ahi Tuna sandwhich.  Actually the Tuna was delicious.  It was sushi grade tuna, perfectly seared on the outside and raw on the inside.  The problem is this...If all of the slippery things, like tomatoes, caramelized onions and aioli sauce are all touching each other on the sandwich, its gonna slide and fall apart.  That's exactly what happens with this sandwich.  After the first bite, the whole thing just slides apart.  It was absolutely delicious, but you don't want it to look like it has been in your stomach before you eat it.  And it is really messy for lunch when you have to go back to work meetings. 

Later on that night, I brought my wife back for dinner. We had to wait almost 45 minutes for a table.  It was REALLY busy...But we had a couple beers while we waited and watched football.  

For dinner I had the Porcini crusted halibut, Parmesan mashed potatoes, porcini cream sauce, white truffle oil, asparagus and bok choy.  The fish was SO overcooked that it was stiff.  The rest of the plate was ok, I guess, but when the protein isn't cooked well, the rest of the meal is a let down.  I think it's because the place is so busy.  The food tastes like the cooks are overwhelmed and can't keep up. It's not clear if it was fresh or frozen because it was so overcooked.  It was also a very small portion of fish and a ton of potatoes.

This place has the potential to be really good, but they need to straighten out some things back in the kitchen...",2kV2SEE3dE243GKP5uxnmA,0,0,2,lrIk7qfoKoLSiwqgyUvg7Q

You can walk in and grab a seat at the bar or wait to be seated. They offer inside or outside patio. I actually prefer the patio to dine al fresco. It's quite comfortable, they come prepared with heat lamps or misters depending on the season.

My Boyfriend and I were there last weekend and unfortunately the selection of staff doesn't seem to have been done with the same amount of care and discretion as it was in other locations throughout the valley. 

We were quoted a 45 minute wait time, and went to the bar for our first beer. They didn't have what I ordered, but the bartender didn't seem to know of any similar options (even though there are 3 or 4 on the menu). We were sat in about 15-20 minutes (one star earned there) and so took a few minutes to finish beer #1 and decide on #2. I decided to venture out of the normal and try one of the Yard House blends. When I asked our server about a specific option, she replied ""Oh, I don't know, I don't drink beer."" Then proceeded to go on and on about how it has too many calories and makes you fat. So  A) Thanks, you're calling me and my boyfriend (we're both pretty in shape people) fat cows for wanting to enjoy a tasty beverage? B) You work in a restaurant that specializes in a certain product, and you don't know ANYTHING about it? At least fake it till you make it next time, OK?

What I ended up ordering wasn't at ALL what I was expecting and basically tasted like strawberry juice (since I obviously didn't get any information on it from our server) and I was pretty disappointed with it. When the manager came by to check on our table, I asked for a sample size of the less sweet part of the blend, to try to make it more bearable. She begrudgingly complied, brought it back 10 minutes later and then never came back to make sure it was satisfactory. Not HORRIBLE behavior, but a good manager would have been a little more attentive. 

The food was about the same as the Town Square location, but since the service was not even close to comparable, I would definitely not make this one a first choice again.",X_vJQDgyEQXEOeoQnao4LA,3,1,2,0Rd22qpvtLCY-btiH9Bayw

Good idea; poorly executed 

Not to cut and paste my review of the Town Square location, but they are really no different. This location just seems to have worse service; numerous errors, long waits for items, unapologetically uncaring servers...

Wrong items, spilled beers, check errors with a long wait to have corrected...

So...
They have a lot of beer. Otherwise, it's pretty much Chilis or Applebees... with lots of beer. Yard House is a beer bar for the non-creative.

The list is impressive. They have some neat stuff and the 6 pack samplers change regularly. The food is good, but I can't tell if it's microwaved, so that's almost as bad as being microwaved.

A mix list provides clever names for the combos you already know and love. The servers are generally pleasant and helpful and have, at the very least, remembered the scripts for various beer questions that may arise.

It is good, not for everyone, but sometime for me.

Overall, they are a solid 3 stars. 

Ambiance is a little crazy and very very loud. If you go at an off time... It's not too bad but if you go at a busy time at around 7 or 8 on a Friday night... It's going to be crowded and super loud with lots of yelling as people are watching sports on the television at the bar... Which happens to be right in the middle of the restaurant. So if you are trying to talk to the person next to you.... Uuhhhhh good luck. :/  (2.5/5)

Price... If you outside of happy hour... The prices are decent for what you get. It's not cheap but it's also not going to break the bank either... So for a night out with friends it's not too bad... And the beers they have on tap and by bottle amazing! They carry beers that I have not seen at other restaurants here in Vegas so it's a plus. :) Also, if you do go for happy hour... Be prepared to be amazed... Most of the items they have at a discounted price for HH are full sized items at the discounted price. Crazy!! It's a great deal. (4/5)... For HH...5/5...:)

Now onto the food...

Cheese curds...Omg.... They are freaking amazing!!! I love me some cheese curds... They are lightly battered and served with 2 sauces... Go for the horseradish sauce... The other one is just too sweet. If you love cheese... These are delish!! 5/5

Burgers... I've had a few different kinds and so has my bf... The fries are da bomb.com... They are on the thinner side so they are very crispy... They almost seem to have a light batter on them... The burgers were good... Don't get me wrong I did not have any complaints except for the last time...My bf ordered med well... And the burger came out med rare... Maybe a miscommunication? Other then that the burgers are decent. 3.5/5 fries...5/5...:)

Sliders... Decent but nothing too memorable....2.5/5

Tomato bisque... Really too sweet. It had a great texture.... Very creamy.... But they added too much sugar to it...1/5

Grilled cheese sandwich... Surprisingly... Yummy! They put a good amount of crunch on the bread.... And the cheese was good... But the surprise were the roasted tomatoes on the sandwich! Very very good! 4.5/5

Service was a total hit or miss...a couple of the times I went... Service was top notch. Where the water didn't get a chance to empty and the server was touching my table and checking on us without being intrusive... And other times the service was a total miss. Like this last time I went my server's name was Dallas... And I asked her to wipe the table since I got sat at a table that was still filthy from the last table.    :( Not a great start for me. But she acted like she was totally annoyed that I asked her to wipe the dirty table and it took her a while to come and wipe the table. From there on didn't get any better. She filled my drink 2x and I guess that was limit since she came by to clear but never refilled my drink or asked if I wanted a refill. The entire night, she made me feel like I was just a bother... And when I asked for to go box for my sandwich and soup... She brought me a box for my sandwich and nothing for my soup and no bag either. Once again, I had to ask her for a bag and a container for my soup... And once again she was annoyed... But by this time I was done with her. Crappy service. 2/5

Will I be back? Most likely since I love the cheese curds and the beer but if we get her again in definitely asking to be reseated.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,2,3,3,1UKSlx7t9dkfSSKvQnH3Nw

Well, big let down. Bbq bacon cheddar burger, with the name you'd think it would have some kind of sauce or seomthing? Nope. Dry as the desert I live in. Bacon. I like mine not so over cooked and a bit chewy. It was so over cooked I think I broke a tooth!!

Rick's margarita was terrible and they wouldn't re-make it.  Worst was that they had an attitude about the fact it was a crappy drink. Three of us verified that it sucked.

We opened our menus to the first page and spent about ten minutes deciding which beer to try. I chose the New Castle/Guinness blend, which was hearty and delish. My girl-date chose the Blue Moon/Guinness blend--also delish, and much lighter.

Then we got to the food menu. It's pretty much like going to the Cheesecake Factory (tons of choices.) They have a veggie-based meat substitute that can be put into any one of SIXTEEN of their dishes. I finally settled on the spicy chicken sandwich. It was definitely spicy, but very good. It came with a pile of very thin fries, which I dipped in our guacamole after we ran out of chips. I hate to waste good guacamole.

My particular favorites are the queso (it's actually a bit unique) and the mac 'n' cheese (it's chock full with multiple cheeses, bacon, and chicken). The bernaise sliders are also a fav. But they've stopped putting the bernaise sauce on the burgers and just serve it on the side. (Hint: The bernaise sauce makes for a nice fry dipping sauce.)

The Skinny: so-so sandwich, okay pizza (2), space cadet waiter with a lengthy wait (1), pretty good lunch special pricing (3).

My hubby and I came here at 2 pm to grab a late lunch.

This place had a nicer vibe at lunch than during their evening hours - less loud, less pretentious, less obnoxious.

We were surprised how bad the service was given that the day before we'd had an excellent waiter. Our waiter gave us our menu and then went MIA most of the time. It took longer than 10 minutes to put down our order. It took over 30 minutes for our food (a crab-cake sandwich special and a bbq chicken pizza) to arrive which is bad considering that 1) the restaurant was lacking patrons during this time and 2) they are trying to cater to the speedy lunch crowd.

The crab cake sandwich ought to be bread with a small side of crab-cake. There were large slices of bread to the point where you can barely see the crab cake. My husband did not finish the bread and actually opened up his sandwich and just ate the crabcake. The french onion soup it came with was okay - not cheesy enough but okay.

The bbq chicken pizza was okay - not great. The crust was not crisp enough. Too little toppings with too much sauce made this pizza feel pretty unbalanced. The accompanying field green salad was fine except for the raw leeks that were in there. (Leeks are really not meant to be raw, dudes!).

If you are a beer lover, this place is for you.  There are over 100 beers from which to choose, all excellent and worthy of serious consideration, according to my husband, a huge beer lover.

The food is great and consistently well done.  Menu choices include  ethnic-inspired dishes (Korean short ribs, noodle dishes), burgers, seafood, and steak.  On this visit, I had the turkey burger, which is one of the better ones I've had anywhere.  Even without cheese (I'm allergic to dairy), the burger had loads of flavour and was moist.  The accompanying fries were thinly sliced and abundant.  My husband had the full rack of St. Louis ribs and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Each rib had plenty of meat and the bbq sauce was spicy and tasty.  Hubby's sides were a lovely serving of cilantro infused baked beans and creamed corn, the latter of which featured ""a ton of butter and cream"" (sayeth the spouse).  We both finished half of our meals and are looking forward to tomorrow's lunch.

For dessert, I chose the mini peach-apple cobbler (ice cream on the side and happily consumed by hubby) and it was warm and full of fruit.  The size of the dessert was perfect: just enough to satisfy, not too much to sicken.  :)  

Yard House would garner 5 stars from me if the servers displayed consistent service.  Some days, my server is awesome, not too attentive but just enough, courteous and charming, and nailing every dining request I may have.  Other times, I'll see the server two times, the first time to take the order and the second time to bring the cheque.  Today's server was good and would rate an 8.5 (she remembered that my turkey burger was supposed to be cheeseless but forgot to include my garlic aioli sauce on the side).

Underneath the chip is the ""filler"" of some kind of raw slaw then a few more chunks of fish hiding under it.  Oh, and the avocado?  A few slivers (maybe a 1/4) of an avocado) sitting off to the side.  That is not a poke stack.  If they want to serve it that way, then it should be on the snack portion on the menu for $5.

(I've even had an actual yard of beer, which has now been relegated to a display case by the hostess stand.  Should they change their name to Half-Yardhouse? :)) I think I may have emailed Yardhouse in a drunken rage one night in 2004 because they did not have a location here, but they were opening one in Phoenix. But anyway... now we have two!

Some friends wanted to meet up here and I felt a little apprehensive because it is always crazy crowded.  All twelve of us squeezed into one of the long booths, which was a feat and just started ordering.  It worked out surprisingly well thanks to the attentiveness and patience of the staff.  They kept clearing as needed and just made it work with a fun, can-do attitude.

Two things I did not know about Yardhouse:
1) Apparently someone took the time to type in all the ingredients to all the dishes into their Micros (aka ordering machine computer  thing).  So if you have people in your group with allergies (we had two), they can get a printed list of all the ingredients lickity-split.  None of that, ""I asked the cooks and they think it may not have peanuts in it.  Maybe.""
2) On Monday night, during football season, happy hour is from 3pm until close!  How come no one said anything!?!  Check out http://www.yardhouse.com/NV/las_vegas/ for all the happy hour options and prices.  Maybe this is to compete with LBS that has a $15 mug one-time purchase with 10 cent refills promotion?  Not sure if the Monday happy hour applies to the Town Square location...

Plus, a bonus for me is that they actually had Goose Island Matilda on tap, which is my favorite beer.  Last couple times I came to visit it was tapped out.  

The only thing that sucks a little is that their firecracker wings have gone the way of the yard.  Back in the day they were actually spicy as the name would imply. But apparently, like the yard of beer, they were too spicy from some folks and finally management relented.  Now they are just wimpy and sweet.

Nevertheless, all in all a good night at the Yardhouse! Reminscient of those days of old in Socal.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,2,1,5,s2OyiERqc_mJWal6W48Pnw

I never notice before was they have small lunch special section half sandwich and soup. It straight forward but lot of things that enjoy about it. They have four too five sandwiches and soups too choose from mix and match. The portion size the sandwich is decent size combine with a nice cup of soup for under $10 think steal of deal. I got the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder soup. Both were excellent! The pastrami nice hot, moist, fan of the bread, and like the spread in it. The clam chowder was solid have decent amount of clams, potatoes, and even cup of soup felt hearty and filling. If you want can even up size your cup too bowl of soup at cost. It perfect meal after getting great workout in light, hearty, and healthy lunch. 

The service was fantastic. We went as soon as they opened at 11am.

I can tell you the skinny margarita tasted super sweet and the only difference is the missing salt rimmer - which unfortunately just happends to be my favorite part :-(  These drinks are between 115-175 calories.

Service was pretty good however our salads got to the table and about two minutes later our entrées got to the table. It is like the biggest pet peeve for me of anything because I like to sit and enjoy my salad before I eat my dinner. When they noticed that they were bringing the Entrée out too soon they didn't suggest anything like remaking our entrée or comping us the salad which I didn't even eat. It would've been nice to of had that comped since I didn't get a chance to eat it on my food with and cold. The pork chop dish was delicious with the exception of a little too much Sage. Sage and thyme are two of those things that you have to be careful with it cannot be too aggressive. Otherwise the entrée was delicious salad would've been delicious if I'd had the opportunity to eat it before my entrée shut up. Sometimes I think it's almost like you have to remind them not to placeFor your entrée until you are almost done with your salad which really shouldn't be the patrons job.,xy73dBwqZ_Ppz5_rysDPVg,0,0,4,Eh_YUHcuIS86eB5jyyDO_w

Lets begin with how awesome the happy hour is. 3 to 6pm

All the apps are 50 percent off and the burgers with fries are 3.50 cheaper. The portions are huge and the food is delicious. 

When we go for happy hour we get their chicken nachos, four cheese pizza (my two year old would kill for it!) chicken wings and chicken strips (which comes with fries)

Next time we shall get their spinach dip.

The nachos have red enchiladas sauce, guac, sour cream. Cheese, beans, and a tangy green sauce. Four cheese pizza is pretty big, more than enough for one person. I wish the crust was crispier but it was still good especially for the price. Chicken wings came in three favors and were great. 10 came on a plate. The chicken strips are very crispy but its not a usual crisp. They're light and have more of a Chinese tempora outside. The fries were thin and great. 

The beers are half priced as well but I didn't try it.

I don't mind being surrounded by some hustle and bustle, but it was cold out - and every time someone opened the door out to the patio, we got hit with a blast of freezing cold air at our table.  Just a crowded restaurant trying to maximize space I guess.

Beer selection is great - I forgot my reading glasses this time so I couldn't actually READ the menu, so I just went with a Stella.   For food I got the Ahi Crunchy Salad with field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette (according to the menu) - it was quite good.

I could really give a rat's ass about Las Vegas gambling and tourist culture. The rub of making a climbing trip to Las Vegas is, well, Las Vegas: a dearth of decent beer selections, overpriced food, the dreaded strip. I was explaining all of this to a local climbing out at Red Rocks, explaining apologetically that my girlfriend and I were from Portland, and thus we were insufferable beer snobs. This local fellow, a guy named Adam, told us to go to the Yard House, explaining that it had the largest draft selection on earth. I'm not sure if this is true, but they clearly have well over 100 taps, including a full section of their menu devoted to ""piny, citrusy, hoppy IPA"". Hello! Furthermore, it's right outside of Red Rocks on your drive back to Vegas.

At any rate, we stopped by after a day of climbing and discovered that happy hour is from 3 - 6 daily, and that their normally rather overpriced pints ($7+) were a more reasonable $5. Stone Ruination double IPA worked for me. More importantly, select appetizers are half off. I ordered Chicken Nachos for $6, expecting, well, and appetizer sized portion. What I recieved was a MASSIVE platter of nachos. Well more than I could eat by myself. My girldfriend ordered spinach cheese dip and chips, which was equally huge. We returned here daily for a few pints and shared an order of the chicken nachos--which was more than an ample meal for the two of us. Dinner for $3 a head? In Vegas (well okay, Sommerlin really)? Awesome.

Dirt bags, this is your cheap post climb dinner destination. It get's kind of packed for happy hour, but you really can't beat the beer selection and the prices.

The beer menu is worth the trip.  Whether you like a fruity blueberry brew or a manly dark, rich stout... this place has you covered.   The food on the other hand is nothing that tasty.

This place is TGI McFunster, with a better beer menu.  That's not really a complaint, just a note.  I love the beers!  I really do.  And there is nothing wrong with a big chain restaurant burger or chicken fingers.  Just don't come expecting more than that.

The menu is too big for any decent kitchen to put out.  Expect mass produced entrees with plenty of frozen and deep fried boredom.  I know what you are going to say.... they have a Vegetarian menu... they have exotic dishes.  Well  I am forever unimpressed with these special menus. Remember the ingredients here are falling off the same US Foods or Sysco truck as the burgers.  There is no brilliant young chef in the back struggling to express himself with his unique cuisine.  These are corporate recipes on menus meant to suck the dollars from your wallet.  In the end, they probably hope you drink enough beer to forget the food.  So don't kid yourself into believing that the ingredients are anything extraordinary.  

On the good side...  the food is not bad and the beer is noteworthy.  In proper combination this can result in a nice, fun dinner.  If that is your expectation... you are in luck.  I like this place, but I just don't see it as anything particularly unique or special.

I visited this restaurant for a weekday lunch which was definitely a slow time for them, but they never acted like we were imposing. I even had a toddler with me, and I've found that in Vegas, kids are not always a good trait in a customer. They were super nice.

However, when I received my French dip sandwich, I was not pleased. The meat was so fatty that I couldn't even choke it down. There are few lunchtime quirks worse than fatty roast beef! It really ruined the sandwich for me, and it's been a while since I was there. I was so disappointed! I usually love this place. I was especially disappointed that they served it to me in the first place, as it was obviously lame meat, even without taking a bite. I stopped about 3 bites in. I'm usually the very last person to ever return food, but it really was nasty. 

I'm not sure I would chose to eat here again when there are many other restaurants nearby that seem to be more consistent. This location is normally slammed, so I wonder if going in when they were pretty dead was the problem. I might give it another chance sometime if I were to be invited by a friend or something, but never again will I come here for lunch.",TXo4TyFJrCbwl4mJsHDUzg,0,0,2,BBLHKmYrLzc2S_uiUoIzSA

They sat us out on the patio because that was the only seating they had available and it took forever to even get our waiter to come out to us. We were left with empty glasses constantly and food took quite a while to get.

Then after we left, we got to the car and my boyfriend realized that he had forgotten his sunglasses and hat on the table. He ran back to get them and every person that said that they would go check the table, ask our waiter if he saw them or get a manager for us, decided to go in the back and then go back to waiting on their tables. Nobody came to update us on if they had them or not for 15 minutes. Finally, he went back and started looking around himself until he found a manager.

I have always loved the idea of this place...as I am a huge fan of choices...and even though I am not a beer drinker, I am easy to satisfy with beer here.

We visited the Red Rock version Saturday and had a great time.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table for 6, but we were there for probably 2 hours and not rushed off at all once sat.  

I drank the super yummy Lindeman's Framboise Lambic, a Pear cider and their Michelob Ultra...all of which were fresh and perfectly cold.

I tasted/shared:

Lobster, Crab, Artichoke Dip...in which luckily no one noticed I did not let get out of my reach...yummmmmm!

Their spinach dip was also good, but again, I was focused on the other dip.

Basic blue cheese wedge salad...I have had better, but it did the job of getting a vegetable in my system...

Lobster garlic noodles...tasty, especially the spinach and mushrooms, but prefer udon noodles (this was wheat spaghetti)

(Mac + Cheese)2 which was highly recommended...I could taste all the   ingredients including the truffle oil, mushrooms and huge chunks of bacon.  This is surely a meal for the girl attempting to earn some curves, if you know what I mean...so I didn't enjoy all of it, not even half, but the con-dieter in me says YIPPEE for finding this delicious version of a fan fav.

Tonight our server was Beau. He was wonderful and made great recommendations. I think this review moved up to the 5th star level because of his wonderful and attentive service to us. 

I liked that we could sample around a little bit before I found ""my"" beer. LOL! I had the Speakeasy Double Daddy IPA. It had a deep hoppy flavor. Seriously they have the biggest selection of draft beer around. I can't believe someone couldn't find a favorite here.

Laurie had the same thing she had last time. The Spicy grilled chicken flat bread sandwich and she asked our waiter Beau to sub the fries for a salad. No problem! I ordered the Mac+Cheese2 and it had pulled chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta and truffle oil. It was as good as it sounds. The campanelle pasta was on point. I loved that it was not overcooked like you might find in some mac and cheeses.

This whole time while we are enjoying our meal we were never in need of anything. After the customary check back to see how our meal was and if everything was as we wanted we never had a want for a soda or water glass to be refilled. Beau also recommended another beer and brought us over samples, while consistently keeping our table cleared of any empty plates.

Desert was in my mind as I had read a previous Yelpers compliments of the Salted Carmel Butterscotch pudding. I ordered it and when it was brought to the table it had a great presentation, but an even better taste. The only thing that could of made it better is if they could of put the salt all the way around the top of it. Laurie had 4 spoonfuls before she ever tasted it, and I had 1 and was coughing because it was all on my side of the cup. It was too much for me, but might have been fine had it been spread around. Don't take this wrong, it was great and I probably would order it again!!

Overall I feel that service can make or break a great restaurant. I think that the Yard House is certainly becoming one of my favorite places to dine. The great food and the service we received tonight has me already planning my return!",4Y_Mo5HjkG_FHt4ZCNSruQ,5,5,5,e-2bS4LdLBwTMq-gLOUnyw

When we first entered the restaurant, we were struck by the ambiance inside.  It's beautifully decorated and well-maintained.  The hostess was nice, and asked us if we preferred to sit inside or outside on the patio.  We opted for the patio since it was a beautiful night.  We walked around to our spot and about 10 minutes went by before we were greeted by our waitress.  She advised us that she wasn't supposed to be given any more tables so she could go home, so we were her last.  It made us feel awkward and rushed.

We put in our order quickly, which was pretty disappointing because we didn't get a chance to really review the drink and menu offerings.  I was interested in trying a yummy cocktail, but I didn't get time to review the menu and I was afraid to ask questions lest the waitress need to stay around and waste time.  So, I just ordered a Coke.  My husband was going to try a few new beers, but just went with Newcastle.  At least it was on tap!

We ordered the California Roll, which is actually just a large ""cake"" of sushi.  It was supposed to be fancy, but in my opinion was lame and the staff should let people know that it's not your typical roll.  Also, we ordered it without the wasabi soy sauce, and, naturally, it was doused with it.  I also ordered the chopped salad, which, unfortunately, was covered in a disgusting dressing that I later found out was ""bloody mary vinaigrette.""  This was missing from the menu description.  When the waitress noticed I hadn't eaten much of the salad, she asked if I liked it and I told her ""No, the dressing is too harsh and the flavors don't work well together for me.""  She replied that it was one of her favorite things on the menu and shrugged her shoulders.  Sigh.  I had hoped maybe she would offer to have it remade without the dressing, or something.  But, she was busy waiting for us to get the heck out of there, so, that was a $10 waste of money and food.

Dinner was a bit better.  I had a margherita pizza, which, admittedly, is pretty difficult to screw up.  My husband had some orange chicken, which he said was decent enough.  I had eaten 2 pieces of pizza when the waitress came around and asked if I need a box.  Almost like: Can you please go home now?  After she brought the box, she left the check and said: ""No rush.""  Which literally made me laugh out loud.  

We paid for the entire meal and left, in quite a disappointed fashion.  I will not be going back.  I would've been happier going to Roberto's!",zwzB0nCc-dzNMR_qewcogw,0,0,2,sOEPm6o_eIj1pcOKoXK_ww

We are big fans of the variety of beer on tap and the lobster garlic noodles are a staple at my table.

HOWEVER, the staff was rude rude RUDE. I was going to take my son to the movies inside Red Rock Casino, and had placed a to-go order from Yard House so we could grab our food and make it over to the movies at the other side of the casino. We were out running errands when I placed my order over the phone, and by the time we arrived I realized we had plenty of time to sit down and eat. This apparently was WAY too complicated a request for A) the girl at the first counter B) the lady server who was going to grab our order and B) another chick who brought us waters. I walked in and said, ""Hey, I placed a to-go order but we actually have more time now, I was hoping we could be seated."" All I got was weird confused looks in response like no one could understand what I was saying. So I said again, ""We just have more time than I thought we would, can we have our to-go order at a table?"" The counter girl looked as though I had kissed her boyfriend. I'm not sure what all the confusion and disgust was about, but I couldn't get an actual answer until after other customers had already walked up and picked up their to-go order, so I asked again and then was told, ""YEAH we're getting you a table."" Um.... okay. Thanks? 
Then they had a fit over whether or not we needed our food plated. No, I said, that's okay, we're still going to head over to the movies and want the to-go boxes. Then there was a bunch of confusion about our drinks. A woman dropped off glasses of water, to which I said (softly, as I was already afraid of getting a pissed off response), ""We had actually ordered sodas with our food."" And she just shook her head and said, ""I don't know anything about that."" And walked away. So then the other woman who had seated us passed by, and I asked about the sodas (because our food had already been brought over, but not the drinks, so I was wondering if they'd been forgotten) to which she replied, ""Yes, I know you had drinks. We are bringing them."" It was a good 5-10 minutes between getting the food and getting the sodas so I don't think it was weird of me to ask about them. 
My grilled cheese and tomato soup was phenomenal. Just wish I could say the same about the restaurant staff. For the record, this is maybe the first (possibly second) YELP review I've ever written, because I don't usually bother. But this experience was enough to make me never go back. Oh! And while we were there, I jumped onto a group text with my 5 best friends and told them what a shit show it was, 2 of them wrote back to say they had similar experiences at this location.

2640831,2011-06-22,0,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"This was not my first trip to Yardhouse's happy hour by any means and I'd say that each visit is quite similar (star-wise). It's just that when I get 3 drinks in me, the experience gets ramped up a bit, the food tastes better, and I forget how mediocre everything was. 

My husband and I caught the Happy Hour last night and our server Cristian was really nice and helpful with the menu selection. My husband asked him what a really strong, decent tasting beer was and upon recommendation, he ended up choosing the North Coast PranQster. It was unfortunately a bit sweet for his taste buds and then we saw Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale and wondered why our server didn't recommend that because we knew the reputation of Bastard beers.

So my husband downed his goblet and ordered the Bastard Ale. We got it and realized exactly why he didn't recommend it. It tasted like absolute crap! On a scale of disgusting brews, $1.25 Earthquake High Gravity Lager from a gas station with 12% alcohol content, comes in at a 10 for the most disgusting beer on the planet. Now, this Bastard Ale, even at happy hour prices, is 4 times the cost and a gnarly 9.5 on the disgusting beer-o'-meter. Moral of the story: listen to your server about beer recommendations; they seriously know their stuff. 

Onto the food! We ordered gardin(soy) chicken wings with buffalo sauce, chicken nachos, spicy Thai chicken pizza, and seared ahi sashimi. We opted for the gardin because I wanted to boost my soy intake for the day. They were battered perfectly and tasted pretty much like chicken. As they cooled, the tofu side came out more, but I didn't care because I love tofu anyway. The sauce is a really delicious typical buffalo sauce and the ranch was tasty. The chicken nachos were HUGE. The plate had to be close to 2 ft long and it was covered in nachos with all the goods: pico, sour cream, pinto beans, guacamole, cheese, salsa, and chicken. My only complaint about this dish was the chicken. They were pretty large strips and not many of them, which wasn't a bad thing because they were definitely on the chewy side.

The seared ahi was alright. I've always loved the sauce on that dish. I can't explain it other than being spicy, refreshing, and a perfect complement to raw fish. However, I found the fish to have some fat or tissue which was hard to cut through and seemed of a lesser standard than what you would find at a sushi joint. Lastly, the spicy Thai chicken pizza. We had to send it back for a different pizza. It was really salty because of the peanut sauce plus all the salty toppings made it salt overload. We replaced it with a pepperoni mushroom which is pretty fail-proof and it was the typical mediocre Yard House pizza with soggy center and all. 

You know those places that you go to once every 3 months because they have a great environment and service so you forget about how mediocre the food is? I think Yard House is one of those places if you plan on being sober. However, it is excellent for beer and vegetarians!",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,0,0,3,FfS_OOKeAQCcTN6FL47Xow

While getting in some much need space from the kids we decided to spend our date night at the Red Rock Casino.  We have been to other location's with mixed experiences in the past.  This night we decided to sit out side on the patio with the misters and it was just the right temp.  

I selected the Jambalaya and she had the Gardein Chicken Sandwich.  Throughout the entire meal I was comparing the recipe to my mother's home made Jambalaya and at first I was a little disappointed.  Once the heat started kicking up and chunk's of the chicken and sausage and craw fish started blending in my mouth my thoughts changed.  This recipe was fairly respectable as far as Jambalaya's are concerned.  Nothing beats momma's home cooking but a very good dish that I would order again.  

The Gardein (Faux) Chicken sandwich was pretty decent as well.  These Gardein products really try to mimic a meaty texture with vegan or veggie lover in mind.  I felt the texture was fairly chewy and was juicy like a real breast of chicken.  The Avocado on this sandwich was refreshing and made it perfect flavor combo on a hot summer night.   The YardHouse is a great place to try if you have a veggie lover in your group because they have something for everyone and an excellent beer selection as well.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,4,2,5,oaYdjlq2Q6V514Gn_OXOoQ

I entered via the entrance within the casino and was directed to the front of the restaurant for seating arrangements. I hope in the future that they are able to seat customers at both entrances.

They asked if I preferred indoor or outdoor seating. I was in a movie for the two hours prior, so I chose indoor seating just in case the weather was acting up (again).

Our waiter was fantastic. We ordered what he recommended, which was the jambalaya and the mac and cheese. Their fried calamari was okay; I still think Olive Garden's is a lot better. Don't forget to ask for extra marinara sauce.

The jambalaya was tasty with two large shrimp atop a bed of linguine (or jasmine rice, if you prefer). It was tasty and I'm not usually fond of spicy food.

The mac and cheese was good. I think I have had better elsewhere, but it's a personal preference of mine to have super creamy mac and cheese, not dry as if it were baked, which I think it was. It was supposed to have bacon in it, but I did not find any. The chicken and mushrooms were a great additions. 

My boyfriend raved about his jambalaya, but the mac and cheese was only okay. I'll be back to try more of their entrees.

Overall, the customer service is what made this experience so good for me. I don't know if it's due to them just opening, but I hope it stays that way.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,2,2,4,u6KR0LpHdEazH9zlIktwUQ

I haven't tried anything I don't like on the menu and no matter what kind of beer I'm in the mood for, they'll have something to satisfy.  The menu has something for everyone, and the beer selection is even bigger!  I love that they also have ""chalkboard beers""--special or seasonal brews that they don't usually carry, but that they have on-hand for a short time.  Be sure to ask what they are since the list changes often.

The waitstaff has always been top notch:  friendly, fast and willing to spend time chatting about their favorite beers and food on the menu.  Food comes out hot and in good time, empty plates are taken away quickly, and your drink glass is never empty.  When we bring our young son, it seems they always find time to say hello to him specifically--a nice touch!

The atmosphere is a little dark, but not in a bad way, and while I wouldn't say the restaurant is loud, the noise level may bother folks with sensitive hearing.  This may be because it always seems to be fairly full.  Lunchtime is quieter, and on weekends you may have to wait to get seated.  There's also classic rock playing and it seems they've created a playlist full of all the hits!

Bottom line:  the Yard House is a rock solid choice for good food, good music and an upbeat atmosphere.  Gather your appetite and your friends and go:  it's that kind of place!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,1,0,4,zTJJcL0sJbYGxydPAMny_w

We both ordered the RibEye with shrimp. We asked them to substitute the green beans for broccoli. I do want to add that the broccoli that was served, I don't think I've ever seen broccoli look like that a day in my life. 

But nevertheless we still had this amazing steak with some nice size shrimp. Ha!!!! I asked for the steak to be well done (no pink) which I'm starting to think they read it wrong and decided to just char the outside. We also ordered a chopped salad that came with a brownish tint of avocado but hey, the sodas were decent. It was over $101 which was a waste and when I contacted them they advised me a manager would call me back well that was on August 19th and still nothing!

The Buffalo is tangy and a perfect combo for a HH cocktail. My bf got the skinny margarita (x2) and I tried the new blackberry smash. It was sweet and tart but good for a summer afternoon.

Had we not asked the waitress where our food was ... would anyone have ever noticed we hadn't  gotten our food? It was just super annoying because we had 2 hungry kids and The unexpected 2 hour lunch almost made me late for my doctors appointment.

3. The atmosphere is filled with all different kinds of people 
4. The location is a short drive from my house

Enter Yard House 2.....

3. The atmosphere seemed like everyone had left the office around 5 and wanted to catch a few drinks and some food before home (I'm good with that).

They offer a great happy hour from 3pm to 6pm offering half off drinks and selected, full sized appetizers. 
The food is always fresh and the service is always great. A few months ago my boyfriend and I were having a bad day and the server brought us out a complimentary dessert. I thought that was super sweet and it brightened our moods for the moment. Small gestures  like these remind me how nice people can be, and not just for an extra tip!

The calamari came out looking like either they were re-using oil or they had left it in the oil too long.   You don't fry calamari like fries where if they're a little too golden, it's okay.  Strangely enough, I tried their famous Mac & Cheese squared.... and it was great, except... it was a little over done too.  Strange.

Now I might update my review of them later since their service although good, was a bit inattentive at times, and it was crowded beyond belief.  Probably due to the Luke Bryan concert going on at the Red Rock that night.  Yeah yeah, I know.  I was like... Luke who? (some country singer for those that don't know).  Hey... what can I say, I'm not a huge fan of country.

So the drop in stars really comes from the food side and a little bit on the service end since the beer selection was great and that actually came out in a timely fashion.

It is organic (not a big deal), topped with a fried basil leaf, creamy, and oh soo flavorful. Even though it isn't on the happy hour menu, I always get it because I'm addicted! The Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry was pretty good. I'll admit, I don't drink beer very often at all, but once in a while I like to try something new and I was surprised at how much it really tasted like blueberries. It was almost like having blueberry soda with a mild taste of beer. I highly recommend it if you don't really love the taste of beer very much because the blueberries cover it up a lot. The Tangerine Wheat was a little too bitter for my taste (think tangerine peels), but my friend thought it was refreshing. The sliders are a great deal at just under 7 bucks for three sliders and a good amount of fries. I didn't get it this time, but I usually get the Bearnaise sliders. They also have Ahi sliders, but they're a few bucks more.

And yet there were four parties of two - four people waiting more than fifteen minutes. It's a holiday, and the place is less crowded than I've ever seen it, and yet they have people waiting? Hostesses wiping down menus instead of actually hosting. I go here at least once a month when I go to a movie, and I've never seen such crappy service. They have great guac, but besides that there's nothing unique abt this place.

Upon arrival, we were greeted and told that there would be a 30 min wait. The wait wasn't a big deal because they have a really nice waiting area out front with shade and cool sights! The buzzer went off with 5 mins to spare for us to order from the happy hour menu and the server was awesome about taking our order immediately!! 

The kids chose their favorites calamari, pepperoni pizza, and fries! Hubs had the buffalo bites and steak sandwich and I chose to order my favorite blue crab cakes and copy his steak sandwich order because I didn't want to keep asking to bite his food. 

The calamari was perfect! Crispy, chewy, and just perfect... to the kiddos it's considered the best in town! The pizza was pizza! Not amazing, but again it was for the kids! The fries. This time the fries were a bit off, I'm guessing because I had to request them ( they'd forgot to bring them) that I'd gotten a flash fried order was the reason they were a tad limp.. or maybe because they were swamped.

On to the adult meal. My blue crab cakes were meh today! Crispy on the outside but the inside as well as the sauce was cool. I can only assume they were done before the rest of food was the reasoning behind this travesty! I will admit the flavor was delicious.. and I know it would have been an a+ if it was hot! The steak sandwiches were a visit saving dish!! It corrected all previous wrongs and just made everything right! Cooked medium, the garlic aioli, the onion strings, and the au jus were all on point! It was so filling and I practically forced myself to finish it!

Overall im satisfied, we are a large family of 6 and most nights I barely get food out piping hot! As long as my kids left happy I'm happy!",u6OIc9ndbqrd6fO_jU2xcw,10,8,3,JVMIWKmWW4f8dXtxFlvoUg

I also want to add that I am a big fan of Yardhouse in Town Square but definitely not this one!  I am writing this review after the third visit and third strike against this place.  Drove all the way across town to meet some friends and showed up at 5pm for Happy Hour.  At this time, we were told that it would be a 15-20 min wait.  One hour later we were very frustrated and still waiting to get a table!  We had a 2 y/o with us which made the wait even worse.  I have never been to a restaurant in town at 5pm and had to wait an hr to get a table and I feel this is unacceptable at this time especially when there are tables sitting empty inside!  They finally call our name and we are seated.  Our waitress comes up and we immediately see that she is a scatterbrain (says a quick hello and apologizes saying she will be right back?)  Ask to see a manager immediately to see if we can do anything about missing happy hr.  Manager comes over and is a decent enough guy who says any drinks and appetizers will be at happy hr pricing but doesn't have a reason why it took an hr to be seated?  Order drinks and it literally took 3 tries with our waitress to get our drink order right.  When she finally did, it took another 20 mins to get a pint of beer???  This continued through our meal and needless to say, we were all upset and unimpressed!  The food all arrived cold and unappealling as well.  This very poor service/waitstaff has been experienced all three times at this location and I will not be coming back.  The friends we were with go there about 3 times a week and also said they will not be returning here.

With an open parking lot, you're only a few steps away from their outdoor patio or main entrance where smiling faces will quickly greet you.  BUT, dinner time can be a small wait.  Yes, it is a popular place and many others know it, so be prepared to grab a drink or two at the bar (if there is space) before your table is ready.

Where to start once you are seated?  A drink, for sure...and they are known for their many choices of beers. Ask your server for the most popular. Wine and cocktails are great too.

For an appetizer, try their Hawaiian poke stack, grilled jerk wings, Buffalo wings, pastrami sliders, Ahi sliders...

Your main meal, you have to try (and share) their Mac + cheese which has a chicken breast, apple wood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses with pasta and white truffle oil. Their Southern fried chicken is also great along with my favorite (and very filling) New York steak salad.  This bad boy has field greens, roasted peppers, avocado, green beans, crispy potatoes and red onion tossed in Gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and fried pickled egg.  Mmm Mmmm...

If you have enough room and you're not afraid to loosen that belt a notch or two, check out their desserts, I enjoyed their macadamia nut cheesecake. A friend had a Kona coffee ice cream sundae and another went ""lite bite"" and ordered their Mini lemon souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream.

Was looking very forward to meeting up with a group of ladies from our social meet up group and have another great experience, but at a location closer to home.

I ordered the Tomato Bisque with Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  The Tomato Bisque was wonderful......but the Grilled Cheese was VERY bland.  No flavor at all.  Extremely disappointing.  I also had a French Vanilla Cappuccino, but it was VERY bland - almost like it was watered down.

But the BIGGEST disappointment was our waitress, Janine I believe her name tag read.  She was not very attentive or pleasant.  Our whole table was talking about it,  Maybe she was just busy.

HOWEVER, it took us FOREVER to get her attention so I could ask for a refill on my ice water.  After one of my friends was finally able to stop her, and asked if I could get a refill on my water, she said ""Sure."" And while walking away from the table my friend and I heard her say, ""I'm keeping an eye on your table."". We were shocked and just looked at each other for a second.  Then I picked up my water glass and said to my friend, ""Well, if she's keeping an eye on our table, then my water glass wouldn't be empty now would it?""

Unfortunately, because of her over all service or lack there of today, I gave her probably less than a 10% cash tip so that I could get my point across.  I'm usually AT LEAST a 20% tipper.

Over all, not the greatest experience at your restaurant, not sure I'll be back, and I won't be recommending this location to anyone.  The consensus was the same with all the ladies in my group.

Tonight was the worst meal we've ever had and we won't be returning.  

Sat down pretty easily in the patio on a beautiful Vegas evening.  One of my sons ordered a kids pepperoni pizza with a side of mashed potatoes.  That was tasty.  

My other son ordered an adult mac and cheese.  That was decent.  

My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and she really enjoyed it.  

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.  That was okay.  Way too much bbq sauce all over the plate.  I had a side ranch salad that was flavorless and soggy.

The worst was the penne pasta that my teenage son ordered.  It was awful.  Flavorless.  We told the server and she said she would bring more sauce because the kitchen probably didn't put enough sauce on it.  

Personally I would've just taken it off the menu and replaced that entree.  

Probably the worst thing that happened was when a different server brought a clam chowder to our table.  When he dropped the soup off, he also placed an order of fries on our table that was supposed to go to another table.  My 6-yr old didn't realize that and grabbed a fry.  The server saw that, grabbed the little bowl of fries, and took it to the table that it was supposed to go.  That's just weird.

I left a 15% tip and wrote a note to the server that she should've removed the dish that we barely ate.  Poor service = lower tip for the server and no return visit to the restaurant.

A bus girl had to tell us that the front desk is across the restaurant to get a seat.

My wife and I visited this place tonight and we had a pleasant time.  

To drink, I had a water (from the tap) w/ lemon and she had an iced tea.  The ice tea was unsweetened.  The waitress did a good job of keeping our glasses full.

For an appetizer, I ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl.  I am a poke nut and I was satisfied.  For the price, the portions seemed correct.  It was served with two large chip wafers, guacamole, been sprouts and macadamia nuts.  It was very delicious.

We had a chance to share the Maui Chicken (Chicken breast, grilled in a great tasting sauce, brown rice and roasted vegetables).  I loved it!

We also had a 12oz Ribeye Steak ordered medium well  that came with mashed potatoes and roasted green beans.  The mashed potatoes were bland and dry.  We traded that in for an extra helping amazing of green beans.

Clam Chowder was a side dish that seemed like a bit much with the portions of food from our main entree.  Nevertheless, the small serving was rich and creamy.

Not sure why it seemed to take some time to get our main entrees, but it did take a while.  The place did not seem so busy at the time.

I had the Angel Hair pasta with shrimp and vodka sauce.  It was ok.  The shrimp were perfect and the angel hair was good.  The sauce had WAY TOO MANY shallots and spices in it.  Shallots should be used in small doses.  My Dad had the sliders, which looked good and he enjoyed, but said they weren't really anything special.

Food is pretty good.... menu includes pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, etc. My roast beef dip was okay, cup of clam chowder pretty good. Hubs' burger was better. Nothing too special on the menu, but a large selection.
Awesome choice of beers on tap, we each had a great pint.

We came in on a whim with a gift card and were pleased to see that it was happy hour. The three of us shared the fried mac n cheese, deep fried cheese curds, and BBQ chicken pizza. I also had the California roll and my BIL had the ahi sashimi. The California roll is actually more of a ""stack"" or layered sushi as opposed to a traditional roll. It's my favorite dish and always a good choice. I really enjoyed the fried man & cheese as well. The marinara sauce was good but the other one seemed to be some sort of mushroom sauce-pass on that one. My BIL and husband each had (and devoured) the creme brûlée while I opted for the apple peach cobbler. My dessert was delicious. Our server was initially Anna who got us drinks and then turned us over to Chad at shift change. They were both awesome-Chad checked on us a ton and never let our drinks get low.

They usually have seasonal or local selections on tap as far as beer, in addition to their big menu, and their Happy Hour is quite good ($2 off draft and cheap food specials).  And on mondays during football season it is Happy Hour all day.

The food is nothing spectacular but I believe it is better than the average pub.  And with the selection of beer, it's tough not to enjoy yourself.

I give the Yard House 3 stars.  Why you ask?  I will get straight to the point.

The bad: More often than not, the service is slow at best.  If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you.  The food is over priced and the quality is just not good enough to reflect the price.  I have had probably 20 different items on the menu and have never had that ""this is awesome"" experience, except with the vegetarian menu.

The good:  The beer selection is amazing.  I love craft/draft brew and they have it all.  Also if you are a vegetarian/vegan, the selection and quality of that food is excellent.  I usually go on a 2-3 month, strict vegetarian diet every year and it is a great place for that.

3383815,2015-12-19,0,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"So went there last night (a Thursday) around 6:30. Wasn't very crowded as I was able to find a seat at the bar after just half a lap around. Waiter was attentive and proactively asked me if I wanted a water while I decided on drink and dinner. That was great and I was pretty excited that the evening would include great service, great beer and great food. The beer is where things went very wrong (especially for a place that people go to to drink a large selection of high quality beer). I ordered the house Belgian Tripel...it was out. He said it would be 5-10 minutes and asked if I wanted something else in the meantime. I asked for a Delerium Tremens. It came out with a 1/4 inch head that disappeared to no head in about 5 seconds. There were no bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. As I watched my sad little beer wither before I even took one drink, I already knew there was a pretty major CO2 problem because I immediately looked around and noticed that everyone else's beers also had no head - even the ones that had just just been poured like mine. I put it up to my lips and sure enough...probably about 10% carbonated compared to what it should have been. I told the bartender and he called over someone else, that person poured a small glass, tasted it and said...""nope, it's fine"". I told bartender that it was not fine and I wanted another one. So he poured another and held the glass about two feet below the tap so it would create a bigger head. What...do you think I'm stupid? He gave me the beer and I watched the head disappear in 5 seconds. I told him it was also bad and I did not want it but that I would wait until the Tripel keg was changed. It got changed and he poured me the beer I'd been looking forward to all day...and it was as flat as a pancake too. I was super disappointed in the entire beer experience and didn't know why a bunch of people working in a place famous for beers were so ignorant of the product they were delivering. I travel to Vegas every other week and always stay at the Red Rock and always have at least one meal at The Yard House.

Once we were seated, our fantastic waitress brought us waters and offered some suggestions on the menu. We started with the chicken tender appetizer and I got a barbecue chicken salad for lunch. I went for the small size which was still way too big. Note to others: do not get the regular size unless you're planning on eating it for 3 meals straight. Seriously.

The chicken tenders hit the spot--not overbreaded and still had some flavor. My salad I didn't enjoy quite as much, but it certainly wasn't bad. It had a good portion of chicken along with lots of other fix ins that made it truly a barbecue chicken salad instead of a salad with chicken and barbecue sauce.

We also split a brownie for dessert. It was way too hot but still excellent and a good way to finish a good meal.

At this point our waitress looked at me with a completely lost glare on her face and said ""that's horrible!""

The menu has recently been changed a bit but I'm not sure if it was cosmetic or if items were actually added. If you can find something that isn't absolutely delicious on the menu you've done something wrong. Their spicy jambalaya has crawfish in it which is unheard of and adds an extra level of deliciousness. If you are into eclectic burgers try the surf n' turn which includes asparagus and a lobster claw. I don't think I've had a better burger outside of Burger Bar at Mandalay.

We were a party of 15 and we probably all came at various times but the seating area they gave us was a tad awkward, split across three tables. Me and the hubby arrived last and kinda squished in.  
Hubby was in indecisive mode so I ordered two things thinking he could have some and then decide his own later. I got the Korean beef appetizer and the shiitake garlic noodles which were listed under snack. Sufficed to say both plates came out and we realized hubby def wouldn't need to order anything else! They def give you huuuge portions. 
The beef was well seasoned although a tad chewy. It came on a bed of rice and had pickled carrots and diakon and sautéed greens. I was surprising more impressed with the noodles. Hubby don't care for them much but I thought these were delish! Almost buttery... garlicy and mushroomy goodness. A great meatless option if you need one. 
Oh and we got some drinks; I got the refresher , and he got the el picante marg. Mine was as it's name would suggest very refreshing!! But hubby's was the star imo. It was peppery n spicy, salt rimmed and sugary in a perfect blend! I declare all margs I get now should come with a charred jalapeños!! 
Oh at some point we also had some of a pineapple cider... it was verrry pineappley and the hubby loved it. Lastly we ended with what I would say was the weakest point, a creme brûlée for dessert. I know right?! How could that be??
Well they put banana slices on top and brûlée those. I like bananas don't get me wrong but I think the two side pieces would have been sufficient and it lacked the nice crust I wanted because the actual creme did not get torched at all.",zgz5B0P4LgsUySCqz7jweQ,0,0,3,YdeqAobneSDgXC8ZiOC41g

If you like bar food, the Yard House has an extensive menu of offerings, but everything we recently tried was less than mediocre.  There are much better bar food restaurants out there....

Our party of four shared two appetizers:

Fried calamari, which was the worse fried calamari I've ever had.  Overcooked and with absolutely no seasoning, it was bland, dry and disgusting. 

Lobster, crab and artichoke dip with chips and pita, which had an unusual flavor, not quite crab dip and not quite artichoke, and lost somewhere in the middle. Pretty bad....one taste was enough for me. 

For entrees we tried:

Steak sandwich, which had a very tough and flavorless cut of beef in a bun filled with fried straw onions. Awful.

Turkey pot pie, which had an undercooked pastry crust and served in a dish that seemed as big as a wagon wheel. Way too much food although it was filled with tasty chunks of turkey and veggies. Not bad, not good, but edible. 

Crunchy Ahi Salad, which had decent quality Ahi that was seared quite nicely.  This was the best dish we received. 

Fish and chips, which were greasy and sort of bland. Edible but not a lot going for it.

Service was good, and again the beer was great.  The waiter removed the calamari from the bill after I told him it was tasteless. 

We won't be back, except maybe for a beer.",9VUBm41ZyGrLo4seD7Iqgg,1,1,2,MCu3KZMYSxBhjzUKLnuTaA

They're life changing.  But take note that it's a hot dish because it's topped with jalapeño rings.  It comes with a very generous portion of fresh, seasoned poke, diced avocado chunks, and wonton nachos (so perfect)!  If you're a fan of Poke you'll know that when paired with avocado, it's very refreshing and light... but those wonton nachos do so well at complementing the dish.

I haven't been in the US for a while, so I just came here recently and noticed this gem on their happy hour menu.  Thanks, Yard House, for making your happy hour EVEN BETTER!

My beau and I ordered:

- spinach crab dip 
- firecracker wings
- surf n turf burger
- Bahn mi pork belly sandwich
*watermelon wheat beer
*bacon Bloody Mary w/ beer shooter 

Spinach crab dip comes out nice and hot, nice balance of spinach and crab not too fishy like some are. Comes with warm pita bread and chips. I order this every time I visit!!!
First time for the firecracker wings.. Yummy!!! Sweet and a little bit of spicy, but not too much, and had a nice cilantro flavor as well. Crunchy and not soggy. You haveto try these!!!
Beau had his favorite surf n turf burger, medium done, topped with lobster and a side of shoestring fries and bearnaise sauce. Burger is delicious! Shoestring fries annoy me because they're too skinny, but they were perfectly seasoned and crunchy. Not a big fan of bearnaise, but went well with the burger. 
Pork belly Bahn mi was so tasty!!! It came with a side of naked coleslaw with lime (forgettable) but the pork belly was nicely charred and flavorful and a bit sweet. The Vietnamese sandwich came together with a nice radish, carrot- slaw with cucumber and mint on top a ham spread (really good!) and a light citrus sauce. DELICIOUS!!

My watermelon wheat beer was nice and smooth, not sweet nor bitter, but perfect and the bacon Bloody Mary tasted like bacon and since we like it spicy, was extra savory! Not sure what to do with the beer shooter.. We just added it in! 

My visit to yard house red rock location is always superb, service is friendly and prompt, and am always left satisfied. Thank you Ariandia for you service!!! 5 star all day long!!!!",d4XCDUWioKG1XxzSzCkbTA,1,1,5,DOVi7yfS3mib8bioiZe2hg

Big pro for the Yard House is the sheer selection of beers and ciders! I love the options and the different sizes you can order.

They also have a good happy hour from 3-6pm for beer and appetizers. We got there in time to take advantage of the cheaper beers and some appetizers before dinner.

They have by far the largest draft beer selection of anywhere I've ever seen, available in a variety of glass sizes. Pair that with an overwhelming selection of interesting items and you have a menu full of food and drink that will appeal to everyone.

This makes Yard House an ideal place for large parties and group gatherings. It might not amaze everyone, but all are pleased with the amount of choices available.

I've had some great food at YH locations and some very forgettable meals.  So while the menu is extensive and generally very appealing, not everything is great.

The location at Red Rock is a pretty good one. It's conveniently located and usually not too busy. The restaurant usually appears full but I've never had to wait for a table. 

The beer selection is stellar, but tonight, both my pints (grapefruit sculpin and victory IPA) came out lightly chilled. I don't know about you, but I like my beer as cold as it can get before crystallizing. I know restaurants never serve beer that incredibly cold, but a place meant for beer should at least serve their beer cold enough to be called cold. Just a little disappointing to pay $7.50 for a nearly warm pint.

The food was kinda off tonight too. I got blackened swordfish tacos, which were a little salty, but pretty good. I usually have a burger here and I think I'll probably stick to their sandwiches from now on.  My wife tried a BBQ chicken pizza and it just seemed very uninspired. It was served warm, cheese had no flavor, sauce was way too sweet.. She only had a slice.

Some things on the menu are amazing.... And some are ""meh."" The service is usually good but Casey, my bartender today, was the best. He remembered my name throughout my entire meal even though it seemed really busy. That was really nice because a lot of times when dine by yourself you get forgotten about.

Sometimes you sweat out all the toxins out of your body and then immediately go put things way worse than you have been eating for a long time back into your body because you were just in an oven for 90 minutes trying to contort your body. Sometimes you go to Yard House because your friend has a gift certificate and all you want is nachos. 

Yes, I took a Bikram yoga class and replenished my body by not drinking a protein shake or eating something with nutritional value but by coming to Yard House and ordering a cider and happy hour nachos. I'm cool. The nachos were delicious and I usually am not a big meat eater but I snarfed the chicken nachos like it was my last meal on earth, and since I was coming from Bikram, Satan could have been coming for me, I'll never know. 

One complaint: flat, gross cider. I know it's not that popular of a drink but you gotta change out that keg. It was alright though--it forced me to drink water instead of alcohol in my deflated post-Bikram state. 

All in all, I would not recommend nullifying your workout by eating here, but it was delicious and I don't regret it one ounce.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,2,2,4,Qpzuuyd2kFiGKafy3GMv9A

3812626,2015-12-29,1,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"So...had another date night with my favorite paid male escort.  He has a huge....appetite. He's not a cheap date. We got there right before last call for food.  We got Calle (like the state Cali, not the street in Spanish) who was very accommodating at the last minute, got us everything we needed. Basically, she was awesome and we are going to ask for her again! 

Let's talk turkey. Actually, that is about the only thing my paid male escort for the evening did NOT get. It was happy hour. Happy hour means (usually) small plates so you better order a bunch at the Yard House this is NOT true. You get normal sized meals at happy hour prices. There was so much food in our table that I couldn't get all of it in the photo. 

Let's just start off easy. I had a Bikini Tini. Loved it. Cheese curds. (I had them before and have fantasized about them since, don't tell anyone but at one point I was looking at photos of them on the Internet as though there were illicit adult content.) Loved those.  Okay, now to know me is to know I love dessert. I am a fat kid who loves cake. Well I had the SALTED CARAMEL BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING. Um. Foodgasm, anyone? If you happen to be lonely and can't afford the paid male escort of the evening like I can, come here, get this dessert, it's almost better. I can say TOP 5 DESSERTS OF MY LIFE!

My escort he got...everything. No not everything... He got deviled eggs. Not his favorite, he said they were fancy. He's used to my plain old mayo and egg version, theirs had horseradish, cumin and had salsa and bacon on it. He had sliders. Okay they are good, but come on, this is a burger cut in quarters! Nice try YH, but you can't fool me! French Onion Soup. He said it was good but needed more salt. He got wings, he said they were hot and didn't want them to touch his lips. He got fries and had canon seasoning put on...I like my fries plain.  But I wanted to try a couple and 50 fries later, yup, you guessed it they were quite tasty... And he also got a buffalo chicken pizza. We boxed that to bring home. It looked good but we haven't tasted it yet.  He also got two margaritas and a coke. All expertly made/poured. 

And now we are at home wondering why did he get all that food? If you kept a tally...

3 alcoholic drinks
1 soda
1 cheese curd 
1 pizza
1 cup of soup
1 order of 10 wings
1 order of sliders
1 side of fries
1 order of deviled eggs
1 cup of French onion soup
1 dessert

Bill total:  $71.08.  SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I have paid more at other places that are terrible. Spend your money wisely YH is where you can get a good meal! AND if you like beer 130 are in tap.

Visited the new Red Rock location on a Friday for lunch.  Managed to beat the Summerlin Power Lunchers in and got a nice booth off to the side.

I like the layout of this place, but was a little annoyed at the fact that if I entered via the Casino they made me walk the entire length of the place to the Street entrance hostess to get a seat.

Our waiter was super friendly and very helpful.  So service was a plus.

Beer selection was awesome and I will admit the only 2 other times I have been to a Yard house was for the libations and not for food.  Opted for the Stouts since it was before noon.

The place would have gotten 4 stars if the food was presented a little better.  We started with the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, Poke Stack, and Spicy Tuna Roll, then shared a Lunch portion Spicy Jambalaya.

Moo Shu Egg Rolls were great, nice combination of flavors, crispy and paired great with the sauce.

The Poke Stack was far from good quality poke and our stack was more like a landslide about ready to tumble.  Although hardly a poke expert, I've cut my share of fish in my life to know that poke should be bite size pieces of fish, not mangled rough chopped pieces of flesh (have some respect for your fish).

The Spicy Tuna Roll is a beautiful bounty of elegance, and tastes good too.  Not your traditional roll but presented in stacked layers which works.

The lunch portion of the Jambalaya only had 2 shrimp in it, and if that is their idea of blackened, someone better find their spice peddler because they are getting ripped in believing they are delivering a good creole dish when all they are serving up is some shrimp with tomato sauce over some rice.

Our waitress was a bit rude and had no emotion. We figured she was being like that because we were a party of 9 and thought she would get an automatic tip, so no effort was made on her part. 
She asked my mom for her id, which was expired, so my mom handed her a passport. She had to go ""double check with the manager"" 
my cousin also ordered a beer and handed her a Puerto Rico license. Apparently, she did not have a TAM card or could not verify ids by her self because once again, she had to ""double check with the manager."" She even asked my cousin for the date on the card. Has she not seen an id other than Nevada's?? When she returned, she did not inform my cousin whether or not the id was fine. He had to ask her and she said yes with an attitude. 
Our drinks were empty. Warm beer. Waitress disappeared for a good while. 
By the time our food came out, we still had our dirty appetizer plates. I asked her for another drink which she brought another of, yet I had to ask her to take away my previous watered down one. 
My cousin asked for another beer and to please make sure it was a cold one, she did not look up from her pad and made a face. 
I asked her for a box for my food and it took her around 15 minutes. I looked around, she was not with other tables. 
It was my brothers birthday so she did bring out a plate of ice cream yet DID NOT OFFER US DESSERT. she dropped the ice cream off and left. Returned 10 min later and asked if we wanted any other desserts (as she pulled the check out) 
Our whole dinner conversation consisted of wondering what her deal was. What type of server doesn't even attempt to get a good tip or make a good experience for their guest?? Horrible experience. Bet part about her was offering to take a picture of us. 
To our surprise there was not an automatic tip on the bill which drove us even more mad because it just showed us that that's the type of server she is. 
Walking out, the manager asked us how everything was and I did have to let him know and he asked a couple of questions. I saw him go and talk to her immediately.

Our group came here after an Unofficial Yelp Event at Red Rock Canyon.  They set up for 10 because we weren't sure how many were coming.  We ended up with 8 so the set up was perfect.

Drink orders were taken quickly.  We must have looked like we could use rehydration after the 4.5 mile hike.  Refills were always quick to come.  My iced tea was refilled 3 times and our server brought two of us a glass with extra ice as our ice started melting.

For food, I ordered from their lunch pick two menu.  I got the turkey club with a bowl of clam chowder.  The club sandwich was good.  Each quarter had a piece of avocado which added to the flavor.  There were a lot of clams in the chowder.  It was enjoyable also.

The service.  Tina, our server, was simply top notch at what she does and that's the reason for the 4th star.

She also had an instinct of some kind such that she gave us individual checks without asking if it was one check or separate.  That's SERVICE!

1. When I asked for (2) 4 tops- it was like pulling teeth. It was obvious that it was more of a burden. Which I get it's a pain in the a** but you as a employee you should NEVER make it seem like a burden in front of the Customer. Allison was very rude. 

2. WAITED 30 minutes to be seated on an empty patio- which probably was empty in the first place, which was never an option until I asked for the 3rd time. 

3. Didn't get our drinks/apps for some time. Never saw the waiter more then 3 times during our entire hour and half stay. 

4. Everyone had ordered and received their food within 30 mins. EXCEPT ME (THE HOST) no runner, waiter, etc. even asked about our food or if we were okay. I sat there without a plate the ENTIRE time.  

After everyone was done- they finally came to collect everyone's finished plates and that was when they realized- I had no food...it was quite impressive the lack of customer service that was displayed. 

Manager came over said he wouldn't charge for the food I wasn't even given (irony). But he was extremely sorry- after talking with the manager he offered a $50 gift card which would be mailed in 2 weeks.

This experience was unbelievably bad....I might never go to this location again because of this reason. I will be contacting corporate/regional manager with names about this terrible experience. 

Just a warning- you may not get food.....",9dd0C3KQD6Gq-hiE-w9nKA,4,1,2,-yOOKpZ2iE9sFaOb2N6d5w

Just got done with an early dinner tonight. Our server, Summer was awesome! We had Hawaiian Poke stack and edamame for starters and wow! The poke was so fresh and very flavorful. I could have eaten it the whole night. The edamame was spicy and garlicky and buttery...yum! For our entrees, it's surf and turf burger, chicken garlic noodles, a Korean short taco and Korean pork belly taco. The garlic noodles was extremely good. I was not too sold on the surf and turf burger even with the lobster meat but hubby loved it. The pork belly taco was good, a little fatty for me but what do you expect from a pork belly? It was perfect with the kimchi. Didn't get to try the Korean short rib taco because we were too full. Brought home the taco and most of the garlic noodles for later.

I'd steer clear from any ""signature cocktails"" because everything they use ""dekyuper"" in everything which 1) makes everything overly sweet 2) clearly these drinks are overpriced. Most cocktails tasted like Four Loko, so why not drink the Four Loko at a cheap price and really have an 'experience'

Food is mediocre but its easy to bring a group of people here because, just like the beer, they have a little something for everyone. Artichoke and Wings were delicious.

Service is always a little slow. My bartender seemed a little confused and scatterbrained. Its Sunday and its not even busy. The other bartender did not even acknowledge my presence. But the barback was very attentive on how he could actually help in any way possible.

Our Halibut and Filet were literally drowned in sauce, so I'd recommend sauce on the side. Wedge salad was good, but we had an up-charge for bacon! Wedge salad standard is wedge, bacon, bleu cheese. Simple. Its like charging me extra for my bacon on a bacon cheeseburger! 
When we sat at the table, the girl was incessantly hovering over us. I get it, you are there. We are also a table of four- two couples who are clearly just trying to have a relaxed dinner. Its not busy and I know I'm not taking up your table! Give me some space, please!

All in all, its not bad. Always consistent so you know what to expect. Mediocre food and great beer. I'll be back, not sure when, but I'll be back.

Side note- We tried to watch a hockey game that was clearly playing at Sports Booking next door, but they couldn't play it here. If you have that many TVs, invest in some NHL/NFL/NBA packages. Yard House has the potential for a great sports bar, and we all know Summerlin needs a good sports bar and if you played every game, every time, I'd be here all day everyday.",tE-Ey2Yi1O6cFEkrJuq8GQ,1,0,3,oPsSQFL1Jb-NOXRobXyiVQ

They have a separate gluten free menu so be sure to ask for it if you're on a gluten free diet.

This review is for the Happy Hour part at Yard House...I've never eaten any regular meals there!  Everytime we've gone, it's for Happy Hour.  Yes, Yard House does keep me happy!  Just look at my check-ins for this place.

OK, yes, it's bar food, and yes, it's nothing overly stellar.  But for what they do it is remarkable in terms of food.  And the prices!  You can easily get away for feeding a group of four for under $35.  Take your kids, take your friends, double date!  A good time can be had for little cost.

Yard House has Happy Hour M-F from 3 PM - 6 PM, Sun-Wed from 10 PM - Close.  Lots of opportunity to stock up on grub!  Our first time here was on a hunch since we were staying at Red Rock Casino at the time for my birthday.  We've been back at least twice a month since!  Payday = YHHH day (Yard House Happy Hour).

Most days, especially weekdays after 5 PM Yard House is packed!  The good thing about their Happy Hour is that you can sit ANYWHERE in the restaurant and partake in the cheapy goodness.  No need to only sit at the bar or the patio.  Happy Hour indeed!  We bring our kids quite often to eat with us.

For Happy Hour at Yard House there is a plethora of food and drink selections.  Pints (of a $hi+load of different choices) go fron $3.75 - $5.75 range.  Half yards go from the $7.50 - $10.00 range, house martinis are $6.50, and specialty drinks and wine by the glass are $2.00 off.  But honestly, I come for the food!  For me Yard House does not disappoint!

Yard House has a bunch of appetizers and pizzas that are 1/2 price during Happy Hour.  Choices abound, variety too!  Some of our most ordered faves:

-Spicy Thai Chicken or BBQ Chicken Pizza
-Fried Calamari
-Hawaiian Poke Stack (most def a fave)
-Onion Ring Tower
-Chicken Nachos (another fave)
-Seared Ahi Sashimi (yet another fave)
-Spicy Tuna Roll (it's not sushi but we like it anyway)
-Buffalo Wings
-Chicken or Mushroom Lettuce Wraps

On most occasions we will have nearly all these items on our table!  We are piggies!  It's a good thing the tables at Yard House are HUGE.  No matter though, whatever we don't finish we take home for leftovers later!  Although we ALWAYS end up finishing the Hawaiian poke stack and the seared ahi.  Those are very ONO.  

Yard House doesn't offer sushi like other Happy Hour joints around Las Vegas but no matter.  Their food usually fits the bill pretty good.  Another plus?  Each dish available during Happy Hour ranges from $5 - $8...and they are full appetizer servings!  Cheap, and lots of it.  A very good choice for decent eats in the Summerlin area!

I have a beer (or three), and a few appetizers and I'm as happy as a clam during Happy Hour.  It is a good time.  Service is very courteous and pretty quick, even during peak Happy Hour time.  Keep up the cheap eats Yard House, I will be back!  H-A-P-P-Y H-O-U-R",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,3,4,l8GooKhvZL_5cLhee--nUA

And this review might be a lot a review of their happy hour. My husband had a beer (Hefeweizen Dunkel) and I had a Gin and Tonic. They both were very good and the happy hour prices made me happy. 

Move on to the food: We ordered three of their appetizers (they were all on their happy hour menu), the Ahi sliders, their traditional bone in wings, and the Hawaii Poke Stake. We really enjoyed all of those things and it really was plenty of food. The wings were actually ordered by my husband, but I ended up eating more than him. He loves his wings soaked in sauce whereas I like mine more dry. These were more on the dry side and super good. The Ahi Sliders came with a medium sized basket of thinly sliced potato fries. They were very good spiced and nice and crunchy. I ate so much of those I was getting almost sick. And the Poke Stake? Oh man, it was delicious.

As we were finishing our meal, the restaurant turned the lights on brighter as they were closing. The huge cockroach then came out and was running around near our booth.

This yard house has been one of the great successes at Red Rock casino, with a lot of places opening and closing within the casino this business should be around for a while.

The yard house has more beers than you can drink in 10 sittings from all over the states and the world. If the Cheesecake Factory is the queen of cheesecake well Yard house is the king of beers. (Sorry Budweiser)

The service is quite fast but with  weekends and nights a reservation is a must.

Food wise, the menu is extensive with great apps and a nicely portion sized entrees. I've never got to the deserts as I'm always full half way through my main.

Shepard's pie was the last meal I had which was a saint Patricks day special. It was a little overboard with the amount of sauce and the pastry was most of the plate which became a little much while eating.

I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken with sweet potato pancakes and shared truffle fries with hubby. The pancakes weren't very good. The chicken was to die for though!!

I expected the same quality in food and service. Our waitress Kristyn was pleasant and she looks like Mila Kuniz! I ordered Calamari to start and it came right away. It was freshly cooked however a tad overcooked. I still saved the rest to take home for my kiddos and Darlene was so sweet to wrap it up for me and say ""I appreciate you!"" That made my day. 

I loved my meal! I got the truffle cheeseburger and fries. yummmmy, unique and cooked perfectly. However, my mother-in-law barely ate her french dip roast beef sandwich because the meat was so tough. (She also has braces) We had to send it back. The manager Jen, came right away and she was so genuine and kind. She offered to replace a meal but we were pressed for time as we had a bingo game to get to lol. We did opt for a free Birthday mini-dessert. My MIL ordered the chocolate souffle and I ordered a Creme Brulee. The chocolate Souffle came out first and my MIL gave me a bite. It was more like a brownie than a souflee but it was still good. The Creme Brulee had a candle and they made a cocoa powder design that said ""Happy Birthday"" It was really pretty. Darlene even sang me a birthday song lol it was soooo cute!

4117243,2013-07-14,2,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"The only saving grace to this review is the fact that I've dined at this location without AS MANY issues as we had last night.  

When I first moved here to Vegas, this was the first Yard House that I had ever been to and now I've been to many in a few different cities. I usually really enjoy Yard House because the food is good, there are so many different foods to choose from on the menu and they have my favorite 'Gin & Ginger' drink (that I modify to be completely different using Fireball..check out my 'Tips' for more on that).  Last night, however, was one huge disappointment after another in what I thought was an otherwise pretty consistently good corporate restaurant.

My friend decided to have his going away dinner here for all of the above reasons that I just mentioned but also because this boy LOVES beer.  I don't drink beer (gluten intolerance) and hence brings forth my first issue of the night.  I ordered a tequila and soda in a tall glass, with a splash of OJ and a lime, please.  My drink came in a short glass, with an orange slice and I'm not sure what the deal was but it tasted funk-ay. And this is my go-to drink, so I knew what to expect - and that wasn't it. 

It started out that there was only 5 of us and we were sitting in the first-come-first-serve bar area.  My friend made sure to call almost a week in advance and spoke personally to the manager.  He made a reservation for 25 people for 7PM.  When I got there at 7, there was no table for us - hence the bar seating.  The numbers continued to grow with most people being forced to stand behind other people who were seated and crowd around our table like it was a bar in itself.  Not ideal for us as guests and I KNOW not ideal for the servers who were working.  

The manager came over at one point to apologize, saying there was a 'mix up with the reservations' to which we assured him that we weren't high maintenance and totally willing to cooperate.  THEN he goes into 'actually, your party is really difficult for my servers because people are moving around so we're just going to have to group people together on checks and you guys can figure it out'. My friend, rightfully surprised, reassured the manager that we were easy going and he would cover anything left over at the end if checks got mixed up.

This was again,, where I started to get more irritated.  If everyone in the party had a SEAT, they wouldn't be moving around. Not to mention, most people didn't even have drinks because it was about a 20-30 minute wait between ordering something with a server and it actually showing up.  Trust me, this isn't an exaggeration. That one drink was my only drink of the night for this very reason. 

When it came time to order food, I had actually taken the time to research the gluten-free options online beforehand so I would know what to order.  As I'm ordering the 'Chopped Salad', I recite from the website that I can't have the 'Bloody Mary vinegarette' because it isn't gluten-free. The server doesn't believe me/isn't sure what I'm talking about so insists he will get me an actual gluten free menu. Fine. He takes everyone else's order and says he will return with the menu.

*cue Jeopardy music*

I didn't get a GF menu until right before the table's food was about to come out. 

I still ordered the chopped salad (without the dressing I knew I couldn't have anyways) and got it shortly after everyone else. And..it was gross. The worst part was the chopped celery - why you would put celery in that salad, I have no idea but it would have been so much better without that bitter crunch in every bite. I then had to stop eating halfway through because I had no water and there was no sign of a server in sight. Womp, womp, womp.

When the party was winding down, I was over it.  Myself and 2 other girls decided to ask for our checks, assuming that because we knew exactly what we had and were the only 3 who were ready, it wouldn't be 'too difficult' to split us off.  Nope. 25 minutes later I got my check..the same time everyone else wanted theirs too.

I'm not sure what happened last night but it was a huge disappointment. Yard House is great but I wouldn't recommend it for truly special occasions because I don't get the impression that they can deliver the kind of service those events deserve.",47-nM4VOQRwu86nJ4r3dEw,1,1,3,RRkTkga8diAJMtHYCTOQTQ

The food is where the experience lacked a bit. I ordered a steak salad as I wasn't too hungry my wife got the filet. Both were over cooked even though I ordered med rare and my wife medium. Both steaks were med well, but since we aren't too picky we ate them without complaint. They were OK. Honestly nothing special but good.

HH food is great.  We've tried quite a few things, our favorites are the Thai pizza, the lettuce wraps, and the Bearnaise sliders.

This place is great . . . almost always comes with a wait though, probably because it's in the Red Rock Casino and there aren't many choices for this type of venue.  They have great patio ~ we love sitting out when the weather is nice, having a beer (hundreds on tap literally) and watching a game on TV.  

The menu is enormous and the food is good!  I don't think I've ever been disappointed here, ever.  And there's something for everyone.

Not so exciting is the placement of the doors.  If you are entering from the casino, the host person still has you schlep across the entire restaurant to the other host person.  We have technology people..use it.  

So we get seated and surprisingly it was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. In fact there were only 2 tables occupied in our section so imagine our surprise when it took more than 15 minutes just to have someone come take our drink order.  

We ordered appetizers and then our lunch.  We got the Korean BBQ beef & the firecracker wings.  I have to say the Korean BBQ was delicious with the jasmine rice as an accompaniment.  

The firecracker wings? not so much.  In fact we sent them back. They were not even close to spicy as the description said but rather just covered in a gooey tasteless sauce.  I should have gone with my gut and ordered the jerk wings instead.  

For our lunch, we had the Mac + cheese 2, which was ok considering the huge chunks of bacon that came with it.  I think it might have been better without the truffle oil since the combo of mushrooms & bacon overwhelm the flavor already but geeze it's only mac & cheese x2.  

I had the tomato bisque and grilled cheese.  The bisque was quite good as was the grilled cheese. Not quite as good as Serendipity 3 but certainly closer and easier to get to without schleping to the strip.  

The thing that took this down a * to a 2* was the service. I can understand if they are jamming on an NFL Sunday or the World Cup etc but it was pretty much an echo chamber on our side of the room, yet service was so very slow. Except in getting our food on the table because about 5 minutes after our appetizers showed up, there was our meal.  Which in retrospect of the bad wings, was ok, but I would have liked to have finished the shared Korean BBQ first. 

Then after we were done, we sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our waitress (and asking the bus person 2x) to bring our check.  

This is like the 3rd place in a row that we've been that the food was not bad but the service was so non-existent.  I know the excuse 3 years ago was because there were so many people pouring into Vegas that restaurants didn't care whether you got good service or not, you were ""lucky"" to get a table but you'd think with so many places closing their doors, the ones who are actually doing a good job would want to encourage passable customer service.

Being that it is located at Red Rock Casino & Resort, one of the best in all of Las Vegas, makes it that much more awesome.  If you've never been to Yard House, I think you will really enjoy it.

Positives
1) Beer selection is about as good as you can get.  I don't know the exact count of beers on tap but the beer selections have their own menu!  Best part of the beer selection is it is mostly made up of craft beers from all over the place with a heavy concentration of West Coast selections from Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Washington, & Oregon.  Also a wide range of German, Belgium, and other European selections.  They also have national domestics if craft beer isn't your thing.  It's fun trying new beers and this place gives you a lot of options.  They will provide a sample of any beer on the menu if you don't want to commit without trying.  You can get beer in a pint or large ""half yard"" glass!
2) Food Menu is huge and has EVERYTHING!  Appetizers, entree salads, steaks, ribs, sandwiches, seafood, pasta, street tacos, pizza, & burgers!  I'm sure everyone will find something they will like on this robust menu!  I recommend the boneless firecracker wings, deviled eggs, chicken lettuce wraps, and poke nachos for appetizers.  But you can also have calamari, coconut shrimp, or Wisconsin cheese curds. For main meal I recommend Fried Chicken Sandwich, Chicken Cobb Salad, Maui Pineapple Chicken, Fish & Chips, any pizza. and their street tacos!  Get the tacos ""vampire style"", you won't regret it! 
3) They have great desserts!  S'mores brownie and mini creme brûlée are fantastic!

The wait staff was slow and inaccurate.  They actually argued that the raspberry beer they brought was the dunkel we ordered.  The manager ultimately agreed with us.  Secondly, but importantly, they have a 1-drink-at-a-time rule.....
Everyone knows at a popular restaurant you order when the waiter comes around.  At this particular YardHouse, they will not bring you a beer until the one you have is less than a quarter done.  So now you must wait another 20-30min until the server comes around to check to even make an order.

Appetizers: Seared ahi, ahi roll, ahi nacho, crab cake, crab artichoke dip, seared scallops

Entrees: Sea bass, steak taco

Sides: clam chowder, garlic noodle and kids spaghetti

Desserts: vanilla ice cream and coffee cookie sundae

It wasn't as busy as the other Yard House, in Town Square, but that's probably due to the fact that I went the second day that they opened but they were still pretty busy, considering. I'm almost positive that they'll have a 1-2 hour wait VERY soon... 

We parked outside, not in the parking garage so we were able to walk up to the front of the restaurant from the outside. The beautiful fountain/endless waterfall thing is there, it's real nice! Inside was real nice as well but I wasn't able to walk over to the other entrance from the inside of the hotel so can't comment on that. As in any Yard House, TVs for sports! 

Our server was Ricky, he was an AWESOME server. Knew the menu, inside and out it seemed! We went for HH (M-F 3-6pm & Sun-W 10-Close) and they have awesome items on the menu. We ordered 2 Kona Longboard Beers, 2 Guiness, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Hawaiian Poke Stack, Margherita Pizza and Classic Sliders. The portions are like at any Yard House, not tiny but it wouldn't hurt to get 2 appetizers to get full, if you're there for HH.

The manager came out and Said that the heaters were all connected so he wouldn't turn them on bc they might heat up the neighboring 3 tables. Makes sense, no big deal. When my buddy asked him if he could Ask the other tables if they minded the heaters bc his wife was extremely cold, the manger Rudely said ""I'm not going to ask people that."" Very weird for a manager to speak that way, but maybe he is having a bad day. I have an oil allergy. I told our waiter I have the allergy and asked for my asparagus to be steamed.

Drinks/Beer: Yard house is known for its alcohol, I've never tried one of their specialty drinks but I'm not much of a mixed drink girl. BUT the BEER oh the beer, wow they have a lot to choose from every time I go I try to get something different. They even have yard house craft beers.

It was pretty crowded for a Tuesday night, so it was loud.  Very loud.  I'm not a big fan of loud restaurants, and this was no different from the Yard House in Town Square.  It didn't help that there was a huge table of guys right next to us; it was better after they left, but just a tad.

I had the Blue Crab Cake Hoagie, which came with bacon, avocado, swiss and tomato, with a cajun aioli.  I remembered to ask the waitress if the crab cake was mostly filler, but forgot to ask if it was fried.  So of course, it was.  Deep fried crab cakes - just the thing to stick between two big hunks of break.  I have to admit I liked the crab cakes a lot - I just don't like to eat fried food.  But the bread, which I expected to be crisp 'cause it was toasted, was woefully soft.

I had the Shrimp Ceviche that were served with four filled spoons. If you are hungry don't order this because it may just piss you off. I wasn't that hungry so it was just right! It had little bits of Mango in it which was a nice twist. 

I also ordered their salad that came with Avocado, Mandarin Oranges, Strawberries, and Candied Pecans. It was really good some people don't get the fruit in salad combo but I really enjoy it. It just makes it more satisfying for me.

4557784,2014-11-22,1,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"I will say i have never been particularly impressed with yard house but this experience turned me off so much that i got a yelp account! 

I would like to start with the positive and say that the old 43 is an incredible drink. It is simple, boozy enough, balanced, and delicious. Also the lettuce wraps, while not the best ive had, were satisfying with flavorful sauces and the elaborate wonton bowl aspect. 

However, the service we received at the bar left a really bad taste in my mouth. Sorry to use such a hackneyed metaphor, but in this case its stale nature is fitting. 

Our bartender josh didnt start off terribly (but made no attempt to be friendly) but when it came time to pat our bill he took our cash and then disappeared. When i pointed this out to another bartender, she tracked him down and he made a big fuss about how busy he was, clearly bothered and blaming it on other guests saying how weeded he was. I am sorry but i work in the industry and this is textbook how NOT to handle being slammed.  You dont say that to a guest!

Anyway after he left to ""go get our change"" i overheard him complaining about us to another employee (!!) making exaggerated annoyed gestures in my direction and blatantly rolling his eyes. Then, when he finally came back, he asked me how much money id given him. How can you take someones money, lose track of how much they gave you, and still have the audacity to make them feel like its their fault?

The icing on the cake here was that when he  finally managed to give us our change  he said ""easy fix bro"", with no apology or eye contact, immediately giving us an annoyed cold shoulder. How insulting!

4558335,2011-07-19,1,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"I like beer. I like light beers, dark beers, imports, domestics, blondes... I don't discriminate. So this place, naturally, is high on my list of places to visit when I feel like a cold one. 

Except only kinda. 

My problem is that despite the enormous collection of beers they have, which is an awesome sight, I invariably end up with the same two or three beers. So, what good is 100+ options on tap when I just need three of those? Also, this place being not near my house, how many beers can I really sample when I have to drive back in the hood? 

Still, this place is kinda cool. I'm always impressed by the amount of beer these guys must to serve on a nightly basis, and I'm impressed by what some of the bartenders seem to know about beers. On more than one occasion I've walked in and said ""Surprise me"" and gotten a delicious beer. (I've also gotten gross ones, where I drink it because I'm too cheap to waste it). 

In terms of the food, it was good. It wasn't amazing, nor was it the kind of food you get at your local dive. I had a burger, which was pretty good. My date had a salad, which didn't seem too good from where I was sitting. I wouldn't come here for the food selection, which seems fair given that this place is known for beer over food.

In  the Red Rock Casino, there are many places to eat, for the price, this is one of the best & better than the Cafe by a wide margin. 

The downside: Yes, it is loud. It is not a good place to bring kids. During peak hours, you may have to wait to get a table. They only have shoe string French Fries. Portion size is on the smaller side.

The Pluses: Great menu. BEERS! Very friendly, attractive staff. Open later than most of the Red Rock other restaurants. Not packed with kids like BJ's Brewery across the street.

4669626,2010-06-08,1,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"The newest restaurant at the Red Rock Casino, that delivers! I'm not usually a big fan of chains since I want to support my local businesses, but this place deserves a lot of credit. However, like all new restaurants this place does have some pitfalls. 

@ Parmesan Crusted Chicken - Chicken was cook perfectly with a nice crusty exterior. The chicken wasn't the least bit dry like Hash House A Go Go. While the sun-dried tomatoes and 3 mushroom sauce was delicious, it felt kind of heavy and a little strong of a sauce. The mash potatoes did help to drench this strong taste. The mash potatoes was also delicious, much better than the stuff at Lawrys, but Cheesecake Factory is still my favorite. 

@ Salmon Entrée - I got to taste the salmon someone else in our group ordered. The salmon was good, however, it was seasoned very heavily. Almost overpowering much of the flavors of the salmon. If they used a little less seasoning, this dish would have been perfect.

@ Lobster Garlic Noodles - Someone else in our group got this. The lobster had a sweet and fresh taste. Like my parmesan crusted chicken, it was good, but the sauce was a little too heavy and they seem to salt the dish a little too much. Everything tasted good, but they need to go easy a little lighter on the sauce and seasoning. Maybe they want you to order more beer?

@ Crab Crusted Swordfish - Another person in our group got this. The swordfish was very tender and delicious. Like the other dishes, they went a little season crazy on this. The crab was very salty. 

@ Macadamia Nut Cheesecake - You may be thinking you get cheesecake, with a small top layer of macadmia nuts on top. Its actually the opposite. You get a layer of cheesecake, composed of a rich base of macadmia nuts, drenched in a puddle of caramel. This desert just didn't work. The cake was very sweet, and I have a sweet tooth. They need to drizzle the caramel, instead of drenching it. Sticking to a traditional cheesecake with a cheese base and macadmia nut topping would work much better. 

@ Crème brûlée - This desert was good. The only issue is on the menu they claim topped with chocolate, but its actually on the base. At first I was eating it without the chocolate. Then I noticed the chocolate base and got it with my vanilla custard and notice a big improvement. This dish really needs the chocolate flavor to work. 

In the food department, everything was good. There are some major concerns over the seasoning of their meats, but this could be fixed. At least nothing tasted bad. The portions is also just the right size, not like the big plates you get at Cheesecake Factory or Claim Jumpers. No leftovers for lunch tomorrow, sorry.

There is some service issues with this place. First our waitress April is a very friendly waitress, but she seem a little flustered and didn't have communication with the people bringing our food. She would come to our table to check if the food came, but it didn't come. This happened numerous times. She forgot our drinks once or twice, she dropped the forks on the ground, and came out numerous times to give us more unnecessary utensils and plates. I think she was having an off night. 

The only other issue with this place is the location of the doors. If you're coming through the casino, you're actually going through the back way. While you're greeted by someone, but it seems a little odd to have to go through the entire restaurant just to get your table. The other issue is the person greeting us told us about the wait time 30-45 mins. This was no where near as accurate as they say they were. They need to work on some better communication to better accurately give an estimation. This is just really a bad, confusing, and inefficient layout with many patrons going through the backdoor to be directed to the front just to get a table. We're in the digital age of information, they should be able to seat people from the back or the front of the restaurant. The easier solution would have been to plan ahead for issues like this.

The newest restaurant at a casino that doesn't suck and is overprice. Shocking! This place does have good food, but needs to tweak the dishes just a bit. For a place thats been open for a couple of days, I'm impressed by how relatively smoothly the restaurant is running and how pack this place was on a Monday night. This place could easily be one of my favorite restaurants to go to.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,1,0,4,0qLRKhTdxip_Ddy57cMvbQ

Yard house has become so huge over the years, that It feels as if their standards have lowered since they are so well knows these days. They're at almost 400 reviews, so that can say a lot about a company. High volume of business can lead to neglect of customers such as myself. Repeatedly, it never fails that my drink sits empty before being refilled for at least 5-10 minutes. Every time. Without fail. Food quality seems to be lowering, due to the success of the company. No need to win over customers anymore. Management even walked right by our table, seeing my empty glass along with my husbands and did not even blink.

4721588,2016-07-25,0,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"I always think of the Yard House as a bar with good music and decent burgers. But I've been really impressed with this location, both from the service and food standpoint.

As I said, the burgers are decent, but I've tried some other menu items, like the stacked chicken enchilada, and they been pretty tasty as well! What I really like is that the quality of the food they're using is excellent.

Another interesting thing to note about the Yard House, at least this location, is that they have an excellent kid's menu. This hadn't been a concern to me in the past, but with a 9 year old stepson now, I find myself sometimes seeking out places that are kid-friendly. Who'd have though that the Yard House would be one of the best options for kids? Not only do they have a huge selection (for a kid's menu, relatively speaking), but they offer decent portion sizes and, of course, good food quality.

Perhaps I'm biased because I go way back with the Yard House. I remember when they opened their first location (and I loved the concept at the time). And I remember when they began to expand. Though I'm not necessarily a big fan of chains, the Yard House deserves its success, and I'm glad to see them maintaining great quality.

If you're near Red Rock and looking for a good place to eat, the Yard House won't let you down.",sOPmVW0bmbb8vwEH5C7FzA,1,0,5,OzCRIGoHSIi81tvSHmxswg

This review is in regards to the amazing customer service we recieved by Kayla!!!
I Came with a friend that highly recommended the vegan burger here, so I had to try it.
First of all,  let me just say, Kayla went above and beyond and even exceeded our expectations.
We ordered drinks, my friend asked for something that wasn't normally offered and Kayla made it happen. It may not have been a big deal to her but the fact that she took a few extra moments of her time to do what she did, really spoke volumes to me and about her.
 I used to be a server and this would totally have been something I would have done!
She was so sweet and came back several times to make sure everything was okay.
The Vegan burger was delicious!! It wasn't dry at all. There was a vegan cheese on it that tasted great as well, and the size did not dissapoint. We ate it with fries and they had great flavor that complimented the meal. 
Yardhouse has always been a good choice for food or drinks. It had a been a while since I last ate here, but Kayla really shined yesterday and I thought I should take my own moment to make this review. 
Thank you so much Kayla for being so awesome. You made a great night, even better, just by being you. You are a superstar!!",g2ne7kPY3ttcd3uf0vqz-Q,2,2,5,C-Lxunn_neTVspOr21k1nw

In fact, it was a relief that they weren't alike because Yardhouse doesn't have an occupancy in Illinois.

Stuck to the appetizers, and by far, these are winners.  There were no mixed reviews on appetizers, as people young and old enjoyed them during happy hour AND after happy hour.  That's a tell tale sign that they would pay full price for them 

Dining companion and I shared the chinese garlic noodles, bernaise beef sliders and the Korean bbq beef. Each appetizer could have surely passed as an entrée.  Chinese garlic noodles were buttery, savory and irresistible feel good food.  Bernaise sliders came in 4.  They meat was a little on the dry side, the bun a little too soggy.  Korean bbq beef was great.  Nice texture, not too chewy, and very well seasoned.  Accompanied with it was fluffy-ish white jasmine rice.

The bar was quite busy as usual, we asked a bartender if she could let us know if someone is leaving soon as we'd take their seats. We were informed that they could not do so as it was ""First come, first served"" service. Fair enough. As we could not find 2 seats by the bar, we were looking for someone leaving soon. After 10 minutes we finally spotted a couple getting ready to leave, we immediately jumped there. Once we sat down, another bartender came to us and told us those seats were reserved for another couple that was waiting. Hmmm didn't another waiter has just told the opposite??? We were quite upset and were not going to leave since there were no reservations taken for a bar and we were the first to spot those vacating seats. The bartender called a supervisor who yet told us the same thing that a couple was waiting before us and those seats were reserved. She was quite rude about that too. 

We were sooo angry, we called up a regional manager who took 20-30 minutes to arrive; he did, however, straighten the situation but we were way too pissed to enjoy a meal and drinks.

Yardhouse is a chain, and the two locations are largely comparable. No miracles here, no surprises, no shocks. The beer list is pretty amazing, and so if I'm going here in a small group, it'll be for some sort of weird belgian quadrupel. 

Where yardhouse shines is the ""middleground"". It's a great place to go with a fussy group, or if you can't decide. There's pretty much an option for everyone- vegetarian, carnivore, no carb, the works. The price point is a little bit high, but if you've been dragged along, there are affordable options, as well as the ""impress the date you don't know at all"" sort of pricing. The food is actually shockingly good for a chain, most of the time, too. I have a had a few ""yep, that was a formula. bluh"" meals; the avacado, pepper, dry chicken and corn flatbread. That was a flavorless mess of huge chunks of slippery veg. I really don't want to feel like I have to cut a pizza-again to eat it.

But the fries are fantastic; probably one of my favorites of all time. I have no idea why. It is simply so. The soups are always spot on. The tomato bisque and the French onion are perennial favorites, and the lunch soup and salad/sandwich combo is a pretty affordable meal.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,1,1,4,a8Xqysz093mYKiLRpKSsSA

Didn't like:
- Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich: tuna was not trimmed neatly. Had a hard time eating it because it was tough and gristly. One would expect Ahi Steak to almost melt in your mouth...
- (Mac + Cheese)2: didn't smell very appetizing. After I ate it, I kept thinking I was going to get sick. I don't know if it was the wild mushrooms, but definitely not getting that again!
- Spicy Jambalaya: It was just ok, but nothing beats a Jambalaya with fresh ingredients

Service is usually good, and it's easy to fit a bunch of us into a booth. Of course we'll be back - we're regulars here and come here when we don't feel like thinking of where we'd like to eat.",4Zqh0-Db39qpGEHCIll9hw,5,3,3,so7-VpCy3-3odzpqwCnlaA

Lunch vs. Dinner.
Which do you prefer?
 
I've had two dining experiences at this restaurant and they are completely different from another. One enjoyable and one not so much. So I asked myself why. Was it the atmosphere, or maybe the time frame? 

My first time dining at the Yard House was 3 years ago around 7, maybe 8pm. Let's just say cocktail hour. Haha. I couldn't stop drooling over the huge selection of craft beers. Again this was 3 years ago. Other restaurants didn't have such a variety at the time which made their beer list quite impressive. I tasted ever beer at least once and some a few times. :-)    
I ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer and fruity cocktails for my main dish. I was on a date so I appreciated the dim lighting. I think the candles were even scented. Or Maybe I was just buzzed. Either way I enjoyed my evening.

My second time was yesterday about 2pm. In my opinion this restaurant was to loud and lacked intimacy. I was disappointed. Due to slow service I only had time for 3 cocktails. It's a brewery for goodness sake. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I didn't know whether to eat my food or start a food fight. I was terrified. Kids were running around everywhere. I was waiting for the servers to get trampled. 

I will never step foot in The Yard House before 8pm.",yyM0kRBxvK93OIKUTWZpgA,0,0,3,9qooVxZ4lXPh-TvbiXwwOA

At my new table Joseph C took my order and then came back to tell me he was going on a 10 minute break.  My meal was very good, but I quickly ran out of water.  Joseph C finally came back and did get me a refill of water.  Then he disappeared again.  I finally had to walk up to the side station and get my own water.  Another waitress came over and helped me.  She asked if I needed my waiter and I said no, I've been ignored my whole meal, why would I need him now?  

So now Joseph C shows up from behind me and asks if I want some more water.  I said no, just the bill.  I love how he brings me the bill from behind so he doesn't have to face me again.  The restaurant was busy, but was well staffed.  I wouldn't show my face either if I had done such a terrible job ignoring one of my guests.  There was no reason to have such poor service.    

So overall while the food was great, the front of the house staff really dropped the ball, leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  But with the money I saved on the no tip for Joseph C, I had some great ice cream at Ben & Jerry's.",8QeQKFEcnF38etRidzdPsw,0,0,2,cx5fH224nmHPlQCH12aGQQ

I've been here on several occasions for Happy Hour, late night Happy Hour, on the cusp of Happy Hour lol 

Things that I enjoy:
-Chicken Lettuce Wraps- or you can get them with mushrooms instead of chicken mmm
-Hawaiian Poke Stack- watch out sometimes the tuna is not that fresh though lol
-Spinach Cheese Dip- so bad for you but so good
-Chicken Nachos- quantity over quality.. huge portion; great for sharing
-Pizzas- pretty tasty 
-Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat - tastes like Fruity Pebbles
-Light Lemon Drop Martini- low cal; tasty; strong
-Spinach & mushroom salad appetizer portion (not on HH) but it's delicious and cheap!

Service has always been friendly and fast. One time my boyfriend and I barely made it for the last seating and the server wasn't rude and didn't rush us!

There are 135 beers on tap.  There's everything from Bud Light to Belgian Trappist Ale and Double IPAs.  If you can't find something you like then you don't like beer.  In addition to a selection of seasonal brews, Yard House offers rotating beers on their Chalkboard List.  These limited run beers are available until the keg is kicked.  Then they are replaced the following Tuesday with a new label.  Be sure to ask a bartender for the current list.

Speaking of bartenders, the bar is where to go if you want quick and attentive service.  The floor servers do their best, but they handle several tables, run drinks, pile up at the service bar, etc.  Cut the line, order directly from a bartender. You'll save time and get better service. Not to mention you get a great view of the TVs . . .

If food is on your agenda, check out the street tacos (pork belly, carne asada and swordfish are top picks; white fish tacos if you're calorie conscious).  On game days, the traditional or boneless buffalo wings are a must.  Go for the chicken nachos if you're feeling indulgent (bring a friend; the dish is big enough to share).

Spinach Cheese Dip ($11.85) - Feta, Jack, Parmesan, Cream Cheese, Crispy Flatbread (This dish is Vegetarian) 
This dish came out hot and ready, it was not too cheesy and the portions were equal from flat bread to dip. 

Ahi Crunchy (starting at $11.95) - Seared Rare, field greens, Asian slaw, crispy wontons, soy vinaigrette. (Under 600 calories) 
This dish is my mothers favorite because the ahi is seared perfectly and seasoned just right. The vinaigrette is not too over powering and blends very well with the freshness of the fish. 

Miso Glazed Sea Bass ($29.65) - Bok Choy, carrots, edamame, jasmine or brown rice
Best dish in the house by far!! If you're a fan of seafood, this is prepared to perfection! Though the glaze was a bit overwhelming, we will be sure to get the glaze on the side next time.

Lobster Garlic Noodles ($22.85) - Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, shiitake mushrooms, spinach, parmesan. 
Only a few pieces of lobster with some shredded crab and whole shrimp, this dish was very delicious. I had wished the noodles were a little more powerful in the garlic flavor, but that is just my personal option. 

Mini Crème Brûlée ($4.85) - Vanilla bean custard, chocolate, caramelizes bananas. 
Presentation caught my eyes first and you know what they say, you eat with your eyes first. After indulging in this dessert, I found happy surprises of chocolate chips at the bottom of the ramekin. Delicious!

I've been to the Yard House in Town square, so I know what kinds of food options they have.  I typically visit the Yard House for their happy hour specials, so this lunch was going to be kind of a new experience.  

One thing I've noticed about this location is that it's much bigger than the Town square location.  It was super busy, yet we got sat super fast which was a plus.  Our server was super attentive and really tried her best to engage with our party.  I really liked her personality, I wish I had remembered her name, though.  Blonde hair, maybe Breanne.  She was super awesome, whoever she was.

For lunch, I started with the Cupcake Sauvignon Blanc for $8.00.  As stated on the menu, it's from the Marlborough, New Zealand region.  I just started drinking Sauvignon Blanc recently and I thought this glass was a little to dry for my taste.  I probably should have just stuck to the Pinot Grigio I was thinking of getting.  Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio is usually a great glass, but that's what I get for trying something new. 

For my entree, I got the half sandwich and cup of soup lunch special for a little less than $10.  I also added a bowl of shoe string french fries for an extra $1.80.  The half sandwich I chose was the grilled pastrami sandwich on a toasted sub bun.  The pastrami was a little tangy and was accompanied with mayo.  The bottom of the sandwich was lined with jalapenos.  Not spicy at all, I think they may have been grilled.  This sandwich was great!  As for the soup, I decided to get the clam chowder.  The day was a little brisk so I thought it was a good decision.  I didn't necessarily think the soup was the best clam chowder I've ever had.  Seemed process for some reason, maybe it was the ingredients that made it taste that way.  This soup was garnished with chopped chives.  

The experience was great at the end of the day.  I wouldn't mind returning for another round after another morning of hiking.  The next time I come, I'm for sure getting the Spicy Tuna Roll on the appetizer menu.  I think it was for about $13.  My friend go this and it was sooooo good!  Seared Ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber with a soy sauce and looked like a little sriracha.  I had the amazing opportunity to try this dish and I fell in love!

Yeah, you're at a place that is a dining establishment as well in case you didn't notice it isn't a club where standing room is expected. 

There is a long bar with empty seats so there is no need to have a circle like we're at fucking camp bunched around 3 people already sitting at the bar. I am calling out particularly a guy with a  white longsleeved shirt depicting a archangel religious scene holding up a British flag- thank you for invading my boyfriends dining space and making him feel really intruded upon. I glared and made eye contact with you and the girl even to know that you aren't appreciated and it goes unnoticed. One of your party (thank you greyish? shirt guy) pointed  to our table and pointed out that you and your girlfriend in a purple-ish, blue-ish tank were in our space- you didn't listen to your friend proves you guys were class A people, A- hole class that is. A few of your friends did it too, but then when they actually touched the back of my boyfriends chair appologized and moved out (mohawk guy with a white shirt and tie thanks). If it wasn't for my levelheaded boyfriend I would have gone to the middle of the group and told them off to notice that they aren't the only ones here. 

The waitress was okay. I think as a persons dining host, the comfort of your guests is of importance. I learned from hospitality that seeing the party hover so close our table that it's courteous to ask if we are okay sitting there or to ask the people if they would like a table or a place set up for them at the bar to keep them away from diners. We ended up reseating ourselves when it took a while for her to come back for us, far the fuck away from the bar in a different section. We took our drinks and plates of food to a booth with the help of a different waitress. After we move, guess what happens? They spread out a bit more properly to a table and part of the bar...of course it happens only after they irritate people. 

A beer wouldn't make up for it, but it helps my mood. They did not have Goose Island Matilda on tap today which I wanted and I settled for a random pick I haven't seen around Vegas- Petrus Blond which was not balanced with it's malts and underwhelming. Fuck, couldn't even get a decent blind pick beer today.

The crusted Swordfish is amazing.
The layered beers are awesome, I like trying a new one each time I go, but I seem to wander back to the Eclipse (Half Guiness/Half Blue Moon).
They also have Boddington's Irish Cream Ale as one of their over ONE HUNDRED draft beers, and that's one of my fav's.
Sushi rolls are really cool here, too. Not like the small rolls cut into 6 or 7 pieces like you normally get; it's a huge one piece roll, that you can cut slices out of (almost like a pizza), or just dig into. The Ahi is great & the California is even better.",4wpV4DZlNxQ2xG_O3Y9lSg,2,0,5,E-9AFoeonhWkG9Lp29-d4w

Last night I went to dinner here with my fiance and his family, since his aunt was leaving Vegas for a while to stay with her daughter on the East Coast. Since we had a bigger party, I understand that things happen and sometimes there's an issue or two with someone's food, but not to the extent that we experienced. It truly was a series of unfortunate food events. Yikes. 

Here's the combined list of what happened:

- My fiance had ordered a roast beef dip sandwich, which looked delicious at first, but when he went to pick it up, there was hardly any bread on the bottom and it was soaked in Au Jus. Would you want to eat a soggy sandwich? 

-My fiance's mom had ordered a shrimp appetizer, which ended up being undercooked. 

-My fiance's brother had ordered a beer, which never arrived.

Now, despite all the issues the customer service was extremely attentive. They made up for each of the mistakes, but they just kept on happening which ended up making the experience less enjoyable. While we did appreciate the great service from the manager, I'm not sure that we will be making a trip back there any time soon.",Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ,3,0,2,DMiWHcQX8HwkPtd6Nqzv1g

The draft beer selections lined the center island of the bar all the way around with many of the boring bar regulars but with more craft than anything. The 3 page list of drafts were really impressive and it was nice that they offered 3 different sizes for pours but it was absolutely dreadful that they didn't offer the ability to create our own flights which made them lose a star in my book. The next star was lost because they really didn't have any hard to find specialty brews.... A large selection is nice but ill take a smaller selection any day for better quality.

We decided a small snack was called for so we decided we would split an appetizer between the three of us. The chicken nachos were mouth gobbling good, it was a hearty portion of multicolored chips that stayed crunchy even with the two different types of sauces, guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, and obey gooey melted cheeses. Yum!! I was impressed with all the flavors and that it wasn't greasy in the least.

I eventually went with the house IPA in their halfyard size which is a whopping 32 ounces. The drink was delivered in a glass that was literally a half yard. So that was pretty cool. Even though it was cumbersome at times to pick up and drink, but nothing too serious. 

I decided to order the Classic Cheeseburger and side of fries to go with the my house IPA.  I ordered my burger medium well. The burger was slightly over cooked I am pretty sure it was well and not medium well so you may have to go with just medium. The burger overall was fine nothing special but filled me up just fine .

ok to the not fun part.  $30something dollar Lobster Mac and Cheese, well the lobster was a very chewy and had more an off fish taste than lobster.

The fish and chips. The breading tasted like cardboard, the fish tasted stale. I feel like malt and tabasco are the only thing that helped me get this down.

We went on a busy friday night, so we expected to wait at least an hour (which we did). 

Ratings: (out of five)

Food (3): We ordered two different taco and a shiitake garlic noodles.  The tacos were good, but not worth the $2 something price tag that comes along with it. The garlic noodles were okay, sometimes I just feel like I am eating noodles with lots of garlic powder on it. 

Service (4): Our server was friendly and she kept checking up on us.  It was a very busy night and I believe there was a party of over sixty people that they had. But she was always there and constantly making sure everything was good.

Atmosphere (3.5): Just down to earth and very laid-back.  

Overall (3):  I never been impressed with yardhouse, but I do like their selection of different beers that they have and they do have a variety of food selection.  However, each time I ordered something different, it never taste any good.  If anyone can recommend me something that they love at yardhouse, I would love to try it! :)",oDyEexUT09e3XhxIp0-Wxg,1,1,3,ccGOs_gsuYwTYyqh_obtOA

This was my second visit to the Red Rock location. It's much quieter, doesn't look like a party is going on like the Town Square Yard House.
Both restaurants have friendly staff, great atmosphere and a plethora of drinks to be had.
My favorite dish is the Miso Glazed Sea Bass. I got it on both visits to The Red Rock locale, the first time it was perfect...this time it was smaller and a bit dry, don't know if it was an off day for them or if their quality has dropped. I'll know next time I go which one is the case. So I'm giving them a pass this time.
My husbands favorite is the Pepper Crusted Filet,(I don't blame him, it is delish) this time it was a little dry also.
My mom got the Caesar Salad and Clam Chowder...both were average, nothing special about either.

When going out to eat in Vegas with there being so many options it's rare that I go to the same place more than once, especially being new and wanting to explore. But I crave this place so I keep going back (to the one in Red Rock or the 2nd location in the Quad) It has a cool bar vibe with tons of beer options, which is where I was introduced to my new favorite, Leinikugal (however you spell it) Sunset Wheat - it tastes like Fruit Loops! The wait staff has consistently been friendly and the menu is as big as a book...and that's my only complaint, narrowing it down to what I want to order feels like trying to make a life altering decision. Ok it's not that dramatic, but I do have to keep going back to try all the different things on the menu that made me salivate just reading.

It is bright red and tastes like a full-bodied fruity beer. The half price apps are a marvelous deal! The crab cakes are delightful, a little bit heavier than I prefer, yet tasty nonetheless. The spicy tuna roll is my standby because it is consistently delicious. It is a deconstructed roll of course and it's enough for 2 to share. Another favorite is the Chinese garlic noodles. It's egg noodles sauteed with garlic, butter and shitaake mushrooms, YUM! The poke stack is also delectable. They also honor the lunch specials until 5pm. I tried the lunch portion of the mac and cheese, as it came highly recommended by a friend of mine. I found it to be too heavy. The flavors weren't bad, it just left me feeling like I had a bowling ball in my belly. I think the mix of the chicken and the mushrooms and the cream sauce are just too much.

The Poke nachos were awesome and the truffle fries were pretty delicious too.  They handled my young niece like a pro with all of the whimsical demands of a smaller child.

I actually wound up skipping the beer list since I was still working off a hangover, but went for the lobster mac 'n cheese since I'd heard it was good and my vitality was picking up after the appetizers.  After eating about 1/5 of the mac 'n cheese I decided to take the rest home since my stomach didn't seem up to the task (from the hangover, I thought).  My stomach churned a bit the rest of the day, and I felt a little sick until the next morning.  I figured I'd finally hydrated enough and I felt great all day until I went to the fridge for a late dinner... I ate half of the remaining mac 'n cheese and felt not great within 30-40 minutes.  My stomach churned again the next day...

I know it's tough to pin down a bad meal and I didn't get serious food poisoning or anything, but it is tough to say the mac wasn't to blame.  All of my other meals for the weekend were shared and no one else had any issues.  It stinks because the mac 'n cheese looked really good with big chunks of lobster and I've really enjoyed the Yard House in other cities before, but feeling ill can be tough to overcome.

My only issue with this place is the nutrition.  Unlike Cheesecake they do not have a low-cal section of their menu.

But this time I was seated quickly and we were served very fast, in and out.

So this review is based mostly on the fact that they have a very good vegetarian menu that even meat eaters love. I am talking about the most amaze-balls buffalo tofu wings I have ever eaten, ever. Some of my co workers even got some for themselves they taste so bloody great. Their veg menu is much more than salads and veggie burgers, they have fish 'n chips, chicken wings, fried wings, and even meatballs. 

They also have some very good truffle fries and a California rolls app that is one huge circle of rice, fish, and ginger. And for those who like alcohol they have a huge selection of draft beers and wines. HUGE.

Down sides are that they do not take reservations, lighting is very dim, especially outside, and wait staff can be slow at times. I once had my water filled all over twice after I told them to just bring me a bunch- I am eating buffalo wings for cripes sake! Anyways, other than a few hit and misses this place is a good place to come with a bunch of friends, but it is pretty pricey considering.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,2,2,3,Zx-jSbveyImKirCl6B9WOg

There were 4 of us and we decided to order several appetizers and share. The chicken nachos are soooo good. Possibly best nachos ever. There are 2 sauces...a green and a red, beans, chicken, guacamole, sour cream and CHEESE! Real shredded cheese, not processed cheese sauce. There goes the diet. 

I read a few reviews on yelp and several people raved about the searing ahi so we tried that, as well as the hummus, garlic noodles, shrimp lettuce wraps & mushroom lettuce wraps. The hummus was ok, but on the salty side. The tuna was disappointing to say the least. The last piece I put in my mouth had such a repulsive texture I had to spit it out immediately. I guess its a good thing the texture was so fowl because if I had swallowed it I probably wouldve gotten food poisoning. It seems like the tuna is previously frozen (and possibly artificially dyed bright pink) and wasn't great overall, but that one piece was absolutely disgusting.  I didn't have any of the lettuce wraps, but my friends said the mushroom ones were super salty...bordering on inedible.  The garlic noodles were decent.

We really like Yard House, but I think it tries to have a menu to please everyone instead of sticking to what they do really well--bar food.  The bf loves the giant selection of beers and the service is always very good. I'm going to steer clear of the Asian menu items and stick with my favorite bbq chicken salad...or when I want to splurge, the chicken nachos.",hHNO8Yk1ljB6Iaeb-Nl2RA,2,2,3,FxNmaCBfGuPTuIu5l-zNlA

This time around, I tried the Tangerine Wheat, which was really fruity, and refreshing, but I expected it to be a little more tart, and a bit less hoppy.  
My second choice was the House Honey Blonde, and I loved it!  It was very light, smooth, and had a lovely honey aftertaste.
My boyfriend told me that I would probably like Boddington's, so I tried that as well.  It was very unique, and super tasty.  It's kind of like Guinness, but it's light.  It has a creamy feel to it, very enjoyable.

We asked for the check after the drinks as our friends were disgusted at the thought of consuming meat juices. The waitress practically threw the check at us and stormed off.

Yeah, I have to deduct a point because during busy sports seasons like NBA Finals or Football playoffs, the servers tend to not be as diligent, and the food portions get a little too small. Plus, the take-out service is lacking. I came one time and did not get my food promptly because the hostesses are more concerned with paying attention to the tables.

But enough of the negative. Good vibe, cool music, not too loud. Come at 3-6 for happy hour. I usually get the Pepper-Crusted Gorgonzola or the Fish and Chips.

Me and the wifey shared a meal, we had the Jambalaya with rice. It wasn't as spicy that I expected, but boy was it yummy. What was kind of ehhh was my sons food, he ordered the Mac N' Cheese and it tasted a bit weird, maybe it's because I'm use to eating Mac N' Cheese from the box or Yard House's Mac N' Cheese was just odd. It had a weird texture to it that I really wasn't comfortable eating. My son also had clam chowder to go with his meal, that was good, but I still rather goto a warf to getting chowder.

I seriously need to try more off their menu (poki, ahi, sushi/sashimi looks yummmmy), and this place just might be my all time favorite restaurant to eat at.

I honestly cannot remember everything we ordered here, but off the top of my head: lobster crab artichoke dip, seared ahi, california roll, and sweet korean bbq beef for apps, and fish & chips, thai chicken noodle salad, grilled pastrami, and a couple of burgers for entrees.

Ahi - good, a bit bland
Artichoke dip - good, a bit bland
California rolls - interesting shape like pie pieces, but tasted pretty standard
Korean bbq beef - meh, my main complaint about the Asian fusion thing
Fish & Chips - great fish, great chips
Pastrami looked really good, as did the burgers.

As I said great service up-and-down, sufficiently noisy for lunch for vibrance, and the absolute best thing - Boddington's on tap!!!!

Instead of waiting we found two seats at the bar and they were able to make me an ice cream drink with vodka Kahlúa and cream de coco and only one in 20 bars will do that for me. And it was perfect.

The Caesar salad and guacamole and chips were awesome and came promptly to the table. My best friends meal was great and my turkey pot pie could not have been better

Even though the place was packed we were not rushed and were able to hang out for about 90 minutes at the bar chatting with others and just having a good time.

The vibe at most Yard Houses I have visited is high energy and very loud but this one was a lot more sane.

I would strongly recommend you give it a try when you are in Las Vegas because they don't allow smoking and as you know if you eat in a casino your clothes smell like smoke for weeks.",55PDnYGzt_jM-GS7B2e6xQ,0,0,5,XbUuihUD7GA25rOQgLVyqg

Something about how managers purposely don't listen to employees availability, how servers get written up for the smallest things. I used to be a food server so when I go to restaurants I am always aware of how busy my server is, what they are dealing with etc. I've never had a problem with service here it seems like morale, management, food and overall quality is just down. It's a hard enough job for these servers why make it harder on them? Especially when you can't even do your own job. The cherry on the sundae was when an older manager came to the table as we were getting ready to leave.

3-1/2 stars overall!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,4,3,ECoOxvTMZUm_xQChjnvqIw

We started with the hot and spicy edamame and fried Brussels sprout and potatoes appetizers along with our drinks. The edamame was so well received that we ordered a second. Since appetizers were going so well we decided to make a dinner out of them and ordered: grilled Korean BBQ beef, Buffalo wings, Wisconsin fried cheese curds (one friend is from the mid-west) and coconut shrimp. All the dishes were well prepared and flavorful with the Korean BBQ beef being the top choice. Served with a choice of brown or Jasmine rice, spinach, daikon radish and green onion it was outstanding and would easily be an entrée dinner next time we go. Our server, Dallas, was friendly, attentive and all around great.

They have a ""gluten sensitive"" menu, which is unusual, in that it's a version of their regular menu but  with instructions on what you need to REMOVE from your order to get it gluten-free. However, they are at pains to point out that their kitchen is not a gluten free environment, so it may still not be suitable if you're celiac.

I'd definitely go back, but be warned we went mid-week and it was BUSY!

5893138,2017-01-27,2,y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,"I went for takeout on a packed Thursday evening. I didn't see any signs for takeout, so I went in the back to the host stand where I assumed it was. Upon asking to place an order, I was informed that a ""takeout specialist"" would be summoned.  This is ominous sounding if you think about it, and that didn't distract me from the fact that no one seemed to be designated for takeout orders. 

After waiting for the ""specialist"", I ordered the skirt steak salad, which was $17.45. As listed on the menu, the salad should have steak, peppers, avocado, asparagus, chips, onion, tomato, pickled egg, gorgonzola vinaigrette. Mine had no avocado and a few small pieces of tomato, which I discovered after I was home. No wonder it was ready rather quickly. For $17.45, leaving off even one item is f#c&ed up.

I expected a big salad, and this one had plenty of steak but needed more lettuce, as well as all the ingredients as listed. Instead of using asparagus tips, the pieces I had were pretty bland tasting. The red peppers were pretty good, and the pickled egg was OK. The dressing was mostly gorgonzola chunks. There were quite a few chips, which are very garlicky. I liked them. The salad was presented to go nicely, with the steak in a separate container & dressing on the side. They got that right, for sure. No bread, however, maybe they forgot that too???",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,4,1,2,D6Q0B5WTRieSccmiuH6-xQ

I've eaten here three times within 2 weeks and have been pleased each time. It's always busy, wondering if the entire Summerlin is eating there, but despite the volume of people they handle everything extremely well. The ladies upfront that you check in with are always pleasant and attentive. There's normally always a wait, but the wait is worth it and they normally buzz you earlier than they tell you the wait is. I recommend happy hour which has an amazing appetizer called Poke Nachos. I also love the mushroom lettuce wraps. Aside from the amazing food, they have one of the best waiters in town. He provides excellent service each time, that I request him when I go in. His name is DERICK and he's consistent with being attentive to where you never have to ask for anything or flag him down. He''s always watching the table no matter how busy it is. I highly recommend trying DERICK as your server as you wont be disappointed, along with the amazing food Yard House has to offer. Excellent Service+ Excellent food=THE BEST!

I ordered the Grilled Korean BBQ Beef, which I was impressed to even see on the menu. I thought it was pretty tasty, although I have to admit that I had a more flavorful version elsewhere the following night. To drink I ordered the El Picante, which was absolutely perfect. The giant charred jalapeño on top imparted such a nice smokiness...best drink I've had so far in LV. I also inherited a friend's pineapple cider, which was very good.

Lunch was such a success that we came back for a quick dinner before leaving the hotel for the night. This time I ordered the Carnitas Taco, and it was flawless. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the pineapple chunks provided some much-appreciated sweetness. 

The only miss of the entire day was the creme brûlée, which was topped with bananas, something I'd never seen. There were a couple of bruleed pieces of banana on the side, which I thought was interesting, but topping the ramekin with more thin banana slices left the custard underneath without its characteristic sugar crust. The custard was also rather bland.
