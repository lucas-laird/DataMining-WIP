sadly, this one is short and not sweet.  Heck, it revolves around one issue - TERRIBLE SERVICE !!!

From being told it would take 25-35 minutes to be seated ( party of 6, Sunday brunch around 11:30 ) yet it took 75 minutes.  Oh yeah, while patiently waiting a 10-12 year old boy being dragged into the restaurant by (grand) mother to use the restroom ( my sense, not a customer ) and as them boy passes us a throws up on the ground just behind my wife's feet ( a smidge hitting her pants )

So finally seated, drink and appetizer orders promptly taken, after all, we memorized the menu while waiting.  To keep the poor service going, one drink forgotten after 3 requests for it, another prepared incorrectly.  Two orders of the biscuit app never made it to our table even though it was mentioned several times with our server.

The main entrees.  Well, they got the orders right but served an hour after ordering them, we hit our limit.

The wife and I ate here the first week they opened.  Several service kinks back then;  the problems persist so we've crossed this place off our Sunday brunch go-to list",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,4,3,1,j86ua2BR6kRSuCP5LgFj1w

1158357,2018-03-07,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Since we've been to the Henderson location, we had high expectations when we went here. The food were great just as we've expected, however the service was a whole different game. 

We came in just this past Saturday for dinner and when we entered the restaurant there was no host person or anyone to greet us. We waited thinking that maybe she/he was seating another party. The bartender saw us but didn't make any further eye contact. There were 3 servers and they're all too busy to notice that we've been standing there for a good 3 minutes. When the hostess finally came out from the back of the house, she was in no rush to get to the stand. We finally got seated and a lady who appears to be the manager started off by apologizing and informed us how short staffed they were. We told her we understood and patiently waited whilst she got us our drinks. We then proceeded by ordering our food. Then when we wanted to order a milkshake, we were told that she has no barista scheduled and the only thing she could get us from the coffee bar will hot chocolate. Baffled but understood that she does not know how to make a milkshake we didn't push the issue any further. 

The food came but the service went down hill from there on. The manager stopped by once right before we took our first bites to ensure that everything is to our liking. Our drinks were not refilled, we had to ask the hostess to refill our drinks. We never saw a server or the manager ever again. 

The hostess was the one who brought us our to-go boxes, cleaned our plates, and initiated the request for our bill. A server came to bring us our bill and throughout the duration of dinner he was serving a bigger party just 2 tables down from where we were seated, but he was too busy to ensure that everything is a ok. We paid our bill, still left appropriate tips even though the service was lacking to say he least. 

The awkwardness continued when the server offered my son a cookie as if they knew that their service have been lacking the entire evening and tried to make up for it. We declined the offer as, it was appreciated, however a cookie does not make up for the entire experience. Although cordial, they've made us feel uncomfortable and reluctant to return. Kudos to the hostess as she tried her best with the situation she was presented. However short staffed you are, you should not have made it the guests' problem to accept.",ZyxN83KPosJsi-Xte14Xcg,0,0,1,DwqQIxPRTE-E9G5_TP0lPw
1163537,2018-03-27,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Really Tasty!

Four of us tried Kitchen Table Squared last week for the first time. I've never been to its sister restaurant, Kitchen Table in Henderson, which apparently is not open for dinner. The atmosphere was fun and modern and our waiter (can't remember his name, but he's from Wisconsin - you know who you are!) was super friendly and very informative.

We ordered the short rib taquitos and the avocado toast for starters and both were very tasty. I think I liked the taquitos the best. For entrees, I had the skewers (one chicken, one steak) which are finished table-side on a heated salt slab. These were super tasty and cooked perfectly. I also had half of a cheeseburger ordered by another person in our group. It was amazing! Its hard to make a burger bad, but the flip side is that its hard to make a burger GREAT. But this was seriously one of the top 5 burgers I had ever tasted. 

Give this place a try, it is great. We will be back for sure.",wu5R5_N7q5iqCBh6NBX26Q,0,0,5,L3dFW_Es6hMComX6M_OL8A
1188060,2018-05-21,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"We are always on a hunt for good breakfast/brunch spots to eat at after church and this spot is a definite winner for us.  Finding the restaurant wasn't very hard.  We did end up parking behind the restaurant (thinking it was the front).  But the door that we thought was the front was actually not.  So let's just say we were a bit lost and even confused, but once we realized that we had to walk thru the courtyard to reach the front we were fine.  It took a minute but we figured it out ;)

As soon as we arrived, we were seated right away.  Our servers were very helpful in letting us know their recommendations and their most popular items.  This was very helpful since they have a lot of items you don't typically find at your average breakfast/brunch spots.  We had no issues with our servers and the customer service that we received was great.  My only complaint is that it did take awhile for us to receive our check at the end of our meal.  

But overall, the food that we've had so far have been great.  We tried a few items that were both sweet and savory and no complaints.  Their hashes are pretty good and the smoked salmon caviar was delicious.   Their pancakes (my favorite) are so fluffy and they have many different toppings depending on what you are in the mood for.  I do look forward to coming back and trying out their monkey bread though.  

Now if you're a huge coffee fan, like me, they definitely have you covered.  One drink - their baked alaskan is soooo good.  I never had coffee topped with meringue so this was a first.  But this drink definitely got my blood sugar up so just beware that its definitely on the sweeter side but oh so yummy.  If you want something a bit more subtle, the snickerdoodle is a great choice.  

The teenager is already asking to go back for their pancakes.  So you can bet our family will be back to try out other items on the menu and possibly their dinner.",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,4,3,4,0qNKYweuy6mu4bikNcl6yg

To sum it all up. Great Staff. Great Food. Great atmosphere. Great prices. If you want details, see below.

Food is great, buttttttt lets be honest, it takes more than great food to make you want to patronize a restaurant multiple times.... (did I mention I've been here 4 times in the last 4 days?)..... decor is amazing. As pretty as it all is, it is also very warm and comfortable. The staff is super personable, they make you feel like an old friend. You can tell that Javier was very particular when doing the hiring. Speaking of Javier, he makes it a point to interact with all guest and is super open to feedback and actually applies it. Again, the warm personable vibe. ""Where everyone knows your name""..... yeah that's KT2 for ya.

Food again is amazing. There is truly something for everyone, so even if you don't have a taste for anything specific, you'll find something that catches your eye that your stomach will LOVE. I'm sort of on diet and I really wanted the Sloppy Joe(Don't Ask), but without the bun.,They actually gave me a great idea of using the lettuce as an alternative.... YUM without the carbs. I had enough of those in my fries LOL. 

Definitely will be a go to place for me until I've tried everything....twice ....ok maybe 5x...",xCMMiUeEunMpXnh8bOgjDQ,0,1,5,7SUzvhB3ndUapywpJb0HxA

I ordered the Cobb Salad, my wife ordered the Mixed Green Salad, and my sister-in-law ordered the Eggs in a Basket. The Cobb Salad was serviceable, the Mixed Green Salad was missing bacon and sun flower seeds and the Eggs in a Basket were initially missing bacon (there was a question if it was included).

We sat at the bar. The bartender was not very friendly and might have been new as she appeared to be reading the drink ingredients.

We dine out frequently and rarely feel compelled to write a bad review but this experience was worthy.

1337397,2018-01-25,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Meh. Beautiful restaurant with decent food, but service and kitchen were as slow as molasses. Girlfriend and I decided to go there for her lunch break at 1 PM. With about 65% of the restaurant full, it took 20 minutes to get our appetizer, and 25 minutes for the entrée. The food quality was pretty good, though the price was a little steep. I ordered the crab Po'boy, and my girlfriend ordered peach pancakes. While far from the best Po'boy I have ever eaten, it was still fine. They gave my girlfriend 5 10-inch pancakes! The pancakes were cooked well, and tasted good, but who in the world eats 5 10-inch pancakes? Maybe that's how they justify charging $12 for pancakes? She ate about a fifth of them, and we left the rest on the table. Since our foot took so long to come out, we asked for the check as soon as the food was brought to our table. All in all, we probably spent 25 minutes waiting for the food, and 10 minutes eating it.

I think the restaurant is working too hard to be chic and hip, at the expense of the qualities which make a restaurant good: service, food quality, and speed.

While my experience wasn't terrible, it wasn't great either. Needless to say, I won't be back.",AJUmCnYvYX8HWMYV1U38Lg,1,0,2,eshFX2gyqBtb1qLxRp7luw

We had been wanting to try this place since we knew the Henderson location had such great reviews but was just too far a drive for us. First off, the staff and everyone serving was lovely and friendly. The decor and ambience is nice and perfect for brunch and conversation, but my main issue was with the food. We ordered the taquitos to start and while the actual taquitos were good, the sauce and slaw on top was way too salty. The avocado cream couldn't even balance out the saltiness. Our entrees took a while to come out and that's fine, but they were not even worth the wait. The hash that came with my food was so extremely salty I couldn't eat it. It also had a very mushy consistency, so overall was unappetizing. Also, weirdly, my bagel that came with my smoked salmon looked like it was fried? which wasn't really what I was expecting.

 A prior reservation was made for a group of seven (foodies) for 5 PM tonight. We were the first guests to arrive to be seated. We ordered cocktails and waited 15-20 minutes for them. One of our group ordered oysters on the half shell and waited another 20 minutes to learn that they were not available and neither was the type of pasta another in our party ordered. We were most pleased with the short rib taquitos and crab cake which arrived approximately 20 minutes later. The French onion soup was too salty, risotto was ""rice"" in broth, clams were tough/overcooked in linguine, Paella advertised to feed two, contained 2 shrimp, a tablespoon of crab,and 4 rubbery clams. We waited over an hour and a half for the main courses to be served and noted guests at two other tables departed prior to being served. When we complained to the ""manager"" she indicated that they were not prepared at time of opening. Our server failed to revisit the table to fill water glasses or advise that our order was delayed. Dessert offerings were limited to ""muffins"" and monkey bread.  Our bill was adjusted for complaints regarding some of the food items. In summary, we waited for over two hours for meals to be delivered. We quickly ate and departed at 7:30.

Monkey bread- cinnamonny, crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. When it came out, the air was filled with buttery smelling goodness.

1999483,2018-02-02,8,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"I'm beyond thrilled to have KT2 on the west side- no half hour drive, and thanks to a larger space, no 45 minute wait times! At least not yet. But that'll probably happen soon, because the menu is huge and nearly everything I've tried has been tasty and well executed. Note that this location has exclusive dishes and dinner service that the Henderson location does not.

DRINKS: Frou frou lattes, mimosas with fresh fruit puree, and monster milkshakes, oh my! Something for everyone and every meal. Favorites are the mango mimosa if I'm drinking (rare) or the creme brulee latte if I'm not. 

SWEETS: Be that person who suggests a pan of monkey bread for the table, and everyone will yield to your menu expertise. Come early or don't be surprised if this dish sells out. Other tasty options to start your day with sucrose include the peaches and cream pancakes or berry waffles. 

SAVORY: On my first visit, I tried to go healthy with the Egyptian Toast and while it was fresh and solid, this is not the place to go on a diet. You can't go wrong with the Benedicts but pork belly green chili a good choice if you're feeling more adventurous, and if you like game meats, try the Duck Hash (exclusive to KT2). The bacon and egg shooters (AKA deviled eggs) are a decent shareable app if you come too late for monkey bread.

Service is super friendly but I will say that it's not the fastest. They're still fairly new though, so things should get expedited as they settle in. Bonus points for having bar seating for solo diners to avoid hogging a whole table.

TIP: After parking, walk around to the court yard to enter. The two doors facing the lot are staff entries. Perhaps a sign should be added.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,28,16,4,yFBBWi9so2QPFCczqws72g

Food was good- I ordered the croque madame, my boyfriend had the philly sandwich. The fries were PIPING hot, the meat and bread? Not so much, so he made poutine out of lukewarm meat and cheese and thought that it was good (menu idea maybe?). The final capper was waiting 20 minutes for our bill.

2517065,2018-01-10,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"After much anticipation from the original breakfast spot on the other side of town, we were very disappointed. I am not big on publicly diminishing a small business owner, but this place is a little absurd. 

Upon arrival we were seated promptly. Which was great having visited the original in Green Valley and waiting an 1 hour plus. Soon after, we realized why there wasn't a wait. 

Service. I am big on service and surroundings. Although this place is beautiful, it does not have the same vibe and look as the Green Valley Location. The server was friendly and prompt in the beginning. Then it went south, fast! After receiving our drinks, we placed the order. The taquitos and pastries we were dying for. Arriving at 10:00 it was almost 10:40 before we had the pastries. Our server looked flustered and concerned. But we know it isn't her fault. But what is here fault was addressing the table and making sure we understood the situation. Nope, dropped our food and left. Mind you, it was just a pastry, as we waited an additional 10 minutes for the taquitos. I am OK with the wait, knowing the restaurant is fairly new. But not the lack of attention. We did make it known to her, sadly forgetting her name, that we didn't understand what was taking so long. ""my apologies, they are putting your food up now"". OK, not what I was asking. We went with it. Once the taquitos were dropped, we asked how long the other dishes were going to take? ""Oh, we didn't know you were in a hurry?"". ""I am not, but I really don't want to spend 2 hours on breakfast"", I replied. All the while my Boyfriend was picking through his soggy taquitos. She never even asked how the food was at this point. The second course didn't arrive promptly. Monte Cristo and Benedict was the choices today. Again the server cleared our plates and stated she was going to check on our food, We are slow eaters, and between courses, clocked by texts (hahaha). I sent a text to a friend at 10:42 and she responded at 11:12AM. Shortly after the main food had arrived. We were a bit flustered, not checking in on us and no concern of time. I seen the Chef, talking to another table, sitting and having a great time. Wish that was us having a great time, considering we are paying for an experience!!!!! By the end of the meal, which we hardly touched. She asked, ""hope you enjoyed everything?"". By this time, there was no real genuine sincerity in the comment, we asked for the check so we could go. 

Food. Sub-par, at best. I read through these yelps and a lot of salty issues. Not today. But the biscuit on the Benedict tasted stale, taquitos were soggy, the Monte Cristo should be renamed the oil pocket as well as the mashed potatoes that were served on the Benedict! Coffee was OK. 

I don't blame the server, she wasn't trained properly. I blame management. I had hoped to leave here happy and satisfied. Sorry for the one star, but if anything clicked I would have given it a high star rating! Coffee doesn't make this a 2 start venue. 

I hope you take this with my sincerest regrets to write this. But I hope it will get better and we will come back in a few months to see. I felt the need to write this, because a manger or chef did not come and address problems or concerns. I don't want a comp or free anything! I will come back and pay for an experience, just not a bad one. See you in a couple months, and hopefully they fix the problems.",ZcVlBhrRW3mP-5YKy7hphw,2,0,1,kJeB7yNlD8U3_cGtYKMvyw

Let me breakdown the details:
- walked in at 12:30pm and the place was very busy but we got seated right away
- 15 minutes after sitting down the waitress finally came over to take our order and gave us water
- I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. There are lots of items that come on the sandwich . I will admit I am a picky eater and I am also allergic to avocado so I ordered a  ""chicken sandwich with cheese, bacon and peppers only. No condiments"" She reads it back to me. All correct . Seems fairly simple
- one of the food runners drops off my plate to the table and walks away. The sandwich had everything on it; including avocado which again I am allergic to and mayo which I despise.
- the waitress comes to the table 10 minutes later and asks how our food is. Clearly I haven't taken a bite so yes there is a problem. She looks at the food, says ""I wrote it down correctly for the kitchen. I will take it back"".  No apology.
- she comes back 5 minutes later and drops the plate in front of me an walks away. Now if I just sent back something to the kitchen, wouldn't you ask your customer if the next sandwich was ok?  Nope. Drops it off and walks away. Here is the best part....The kitchen tried to scrape the mayo off of the bun, like I wouldn't notice. They also had the avocado still on the sandwich. I am surprised they didn't try to scrape that off too and pass it back to me.  
- I wait another 10 minutes and she finally comes back over. I politely tell her that she can just take it back and off the bill please since it's still not right. She said very nicely ""No. I will have them make it again.""  This time I got a apology 
- it finally comes out and another food runner drops it off. This time the sandwich is right but the French fries are ice cold since they clearly sat trying to get this sandwich right. 
- at this point I and just disgusted with everything. I was starving so I ate 3 bites of the sandwich and some of the cold fries.
- I was running late for a meeting, since by now we have been at the place for over and hour, so my coworker stayed to pay the bill.  They had the nerve after all of that to still charge me for the sandwich. I would have had more respect for the place had they done the right thing and taken the sandwich off of the bill.

However, the dishes could use refining.  For my first visit, I had pork breakfast tostadas. The meat was dry and over-salted.  The accompanying cabbage slaw was lacking in flavor and could have used an acid to balance everything out. During my second trip, a substitution for a waffle topping was requested, which apparently threw the kitchen into chaos and it took a couple of times to get the dish sorted out.  On my third trip I thought I would get a basic breakfast.  My plate came so covered in oil that it pooled around my potatoes and left a layer of oil under my eggs and toast.  The dish was unappetizing and, given prior experiences, I didn't want to try my luck on a substitute dish when offered. This was the first time I've ever sent a plate back. Despite the above, I will give this place a fourth chance for two reasons.  First, the potato soup is incredible, though quite rich and I recommend sticking to a cup. Second, the entire staff and management could have not been more professional in addressing the above issues, offering accommodations and all would have taken an extra step to make sure I was a happy customer.

This being located in The Gramercy in Spring Valley, with convenient parking, easy access off of the 215 freeway and nice open air feel to it.  This has a lot of items similar to the Kitchen Table in Henderson but with a full bar and some additional items.
We had a 30 min. wait but saw that there were plenty of tables of all sizes open. When we finally got seated, only about half the tables that were left open still remained that way when we were finally sat down.  Maybe the hostesses were new and did not know how to ration the tables. Hopefully that will change with experience.  
Service was just as awesome and welcoming as the other location. So definitely a plus. 
My wife was hoping that the Avocado Toast was on the menu but sadly, it wasn't. She instead went full carb and got her other fav, the Traditional French Toast. I got the Duck Pastrami Hash and our son chose the Salmon Benedict.  Though mine and my son's dish were delicious, My wife stated that the French Toast was missing something that the other place had.
Later in the day we were speaking with friends and other family who had gone to this location in the past as well as having gone to the original, they too found there to be some inconsistencies with the food that they have had here. 
Overall it is still a great place to eat, visit and socialize. It just seems that there are few things to still tighten up. I would still recommend this place, for sure!",Qa67LO6dGw1mKTy7R3YgwQ,0,0,4,31HQyFy8KR8yzR4iZbOHfA
2934888,2018-01-27,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"I went with a group of 8 for brunch on Saturday at noon. 

Service was great - friendly, knowledgeable, speedy without rushing us. 

The money bread is great for sharing - 6 pieces per order, fluffy without being too sweet. 

Another good not-too-sweet thing is the snickerdoodle latte. It's a big mug of goodness. 

Note: the ""traditional"" macchiato is a tiny thing. Just a warning for anyone feeling adventurous. 

One thing entrees are bigger than they look. They don't necessarily *look* that big but I've always left full and satisfied and I'm a chunky boy. 

I've had 
1) the chorizo omelet - really tasty. I'd recommend to anyone who wants it. 
2) croque madame - first time having one was here and it's so surprisingly sinful. On the most basic level, it's a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich, but every single element, including the bread, is a 10/10.  And it's quite filling.

The complaints in the other reviews made me wary but this place just opened and I'd swing by if I were you. 

Last note - they haven't actually started making milkshakes yet, so there's that.

My daughter, sisters, and myself went here on a Sunday morning for brunch. We expected a wait, and were totally fine with the short time until we were seated. However, it did take a full on 2 hours after that to experience breakfast, and it was underwhelming to say the least. 
First off, we were excited about things posted like milkshakes, Bloody Mary bars, and some menu options that were not yet offered. I'm ok with them being out of something. What I'm not ok with, them positing it on all social media sites like it's available, when it's not. Seems very much like false advertisement to me. We waited 35 minted for our appetizers, which they comped, without us asking or complaining about. We started with a cheese crab dip that was put together very sloppy, and seemed under-done. I had the burger, it was decent, but the egg on it was barley cooked. It seemed as if everything was being rushed out of the kitchen. Our drinks sat empty numerous times. If it wasn't for their amazing customer service, my daughter enjoying her meal, and my past experiences, I'd really be confused about why everyone loves this place.

We got seated quickly and got overwhelmed by the menu.  Tons of options from breakfast to brunch to lunch, all sounding fantastic.  I ended up ordering the frittatta with sausage on the side.  The food finally came out and was honestly pretty fantastic.  Frittata was made of egg whites but came out large and had super flavor; really nice-looking mushrooms and plenty of veggies inside.  The side of sausage had a crunchy skin and was cooked just to the right temperature.  The best part was the hot sauce selection.  Ghost pepper, habanero, and a few others that I can't remember.  My stomach was rumbling with happiness and water was a necessity for sure.  Kitchen Table Squared has their food and hot sauce game down pat.

The bad part, which knocks this review, comes from two things.  First, the parking is awful.  Even if you find a lot in the back lot, you need to walk all the way to the front rather than using the back door.  And the parking attendants love giving tickets as well.  Second, the service was oh so slow.  We were seated and order taken within 10 minutes.  Food literally did not come until 45 minutes later.  The waiter even stopped coming to our section and avoided eye contact towards the end of our long wait; three times he came over apologizing for the wait before that.  The manager came over as well two separate times.  In the end, all we got 20% off.  I think we shouldn't gotten a free entree or even a free monkey bread or the like to compensate for the wait, but I guess 20% is better than nothing.  

Kitchen Table excels at the food.  Prime spot for brunch, though not the cheapest with most dishes starting at $12 or more.  I would be back for a leisurely brunch, but I'll be prepared to wait.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,4,5dm2V1fWcJ2jkDFOOYyMZg

As for this Kitchen Table, I'm not going to comment on the decor or parking or anything that takes away from the service and food.

That I didn't realize I ended up ordering more because well, 2 isn't enough (comes with 6 if I recall), and the cinnamon and sweetness was the way I expected. 
Second, the Monte Cristo was very interesting. I'm not one to eat fried food. But the bread was crunchy and well done. The ham and and cheese inside that went with it, was very different, but in a good way.

The decor is great here however the staff must need more training. The restaurant was averagely busy for a Sunday brunch (our family goes to brunch a lot as a group).. however the service was horrible. We ordered appetizers and food within 15 mins of sitting down. 
The appetizers took 45 mins to come out and the food took an hour and a half. We were chit chatting so the timing wasn't too much of a bother.. however the problems came once our meals came out. The first round of dishes came out in a group of 3... fifteen minutes later 2 more dishes came out. Ten minutes later 2 more.. five minutes later another 1. Etc etc. Finally after waiting we thought everyone had their food except one dish they absolutely forgot. We were all finished eating our cold dishes when the last plate arrived. 
Things were missing from dishes and pancake stacks were short in order to meet the needs of the other dishes in our order. There was no consistency in the pancake orders. Naturally we were polite.. the most annoying part was we waited and wanted to eat as a family so the dishes that came out quicker were cold when the time came to eat. 
Honestly about 50% of our order was wrong. Poorly managed restaurant. We won't be coming here again for brunch. We will go back to DW Bistro as our experience is always great there.

The only change I'd make to the salad would be the removal of the date pieces - dates are too sweet for my taste. I dont always take photos of my food but everything that came out looked so good, I couldn't help myself. The potato soup was worth returning for, and I am not usually a fan at most places.

The much talked about monkey bread ($5 for seven pieces) is a great starter to share between a group and much more readily available on weekdays. For gluten-free options, their sweet bread is as close to actual bread I've tasted and goes quite well with their house made strawberry jam (a bit on the sweeter side). The bacon and egg shooters also make for nice appetizers to share if you want to try something more savory.

As for mains, I was craving a Monte Cristo and while it really did hit the spot, it was overly heavy. Most others I've tried were grilled, but I did appreciate the crispiness from the deep fried batter. The ham and gruyere cheese went well with the strawberry jam, but again, it was slightly too sweet for my liking.

There were several other menu items that piqued my interest including a couple of duck dishes that I will have to try. Although I also probably wouldn't enjoy how sweet it might be, the baked Alaska coffee might be too picturesque not to try on my next visit.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,8,9,4,7uEyktizq1p5vrqJz0c03g
3972863,2018-01-09,5,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Three of us came here for dinner after volunteering at the Las Vegas Rescue Mission.  My first task was to get into the place the right way--and the only way.

I first went over a wall and the door was locked.  That's the back and it's not the entrance.  I then tried to walk around only to be met by a large piece of paneling firmly in place.  Back to the wall and two of us tried another way.

Do enter by the stairs that take you to the plaza around which all the stores and shops face.  That's where you get to the entrance of Kitchen Table Squared.  Well, in any case, it helped build our appetites along with our stamina!

We were seated in the right rear of the restaurant.  The place is very modern and quite good looking.  We looked at the menus and found out there was a reverse happy hour in effect for some of the food and for the drinks.  Our server was great at letting us know about the happy hour.

I ordered an iced tea, a cup of potato soup (they were out of their crab bisque--damn) and the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with coleslaw and duck fat fries.

Preparation time was standard which gave us time to catch up on upcoming trips and other things.

The potato soup was good.  It had cream, celery, onion, bacon, carrot, and fried potato skin ground into the soup.  A little bit later, our mains came.  My pulled pork was good but it's something I should learn not to order.  I'm not a BBQ fan and I didn't expect it would be was sweet as it was.  The coleslaw on the sandwich was crisp and tasty.  The sandwich was very large and served on a good sized bun.  I should have cut it in half at the start so I could take 1/2 home.  I didn't finish my fries which is something I rarely ever do in order to finish the sandwich.  I then delicately dipped my napkin into my unused water glass so I could get the sticky BBQ off my fingers.

We all passed on dessert.  I need to return ands try one of the paninis and get there early enough to try the crab bisque.  Oh well, another visit is in store.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,9,3,X5vMk8UhYUE6CKkaPfM4FQ

4008295,2018-02-15,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"I was excited to hear another restaurant was opening up in The Gramercy and to try Kitchen Table Squared after hearing such great things about Kitchen Table in Henderson. Sadly though I was disappointed after having a business lunch meeting recently.

While the food was not bad (I had the egg white frittata), it was not as great as I had anticipated. The biggest issues was the service and flooring flaws. It took an extremely long time for our food to come out and despite it taking so long for us to all receive our food, my friend's frittata was well undercooked and it needed to be sent back to be properly cooked since she is pregnant and could not risk eating it as it was. As we all ate, it took yet again a long time for the frittata to be cooked thoroughly. 

Besides the slow food preparation, I would say the biggest issue that the restaurant should fix is the flooring. The floors are extremely slick and slippery. I had to walk with waddle strides to ensure I would not slip and fall. As we exited the restaurant, my pregnant friend did slip on the slick floor but luckily caught herself on a chair at the bar and luckily a lady was sitting in it. 

Employees should also be careful coming out of the kitchen doors. The doors are located right around the corner of people going to and from the bathroom, and at times employees came charging out and almost ran into us as we walked to and from the bathroom.",0qqbT4_eMwWYHB126Fk6XQ,1,0,3,YY2QZS1hWftuVStR8BCyZQ

She recommended reservations or a very early arrival for weekend visits. 
Seating is tables and chairs, half booth half table and a bar.

The Food...
Any place that has breakfast appetizers has my attention! 
We ordered the egg shooters and a biscuit with their house made strawberry jam. The egg shooters are their take on deviled eggs. It is stuffed with their house mayo, pickled jalapeños and bacon. Four halves (2 whole eggs) came in an order. 
The biscuit was fantastic. Served halved and griddled with a house made strawberry jam.
I got the green chili pork belly and he got the pork belly Benedict. My dish was like pork belly breakfast nachos, it was even topped with two poached eggs. The green chili was very flavorful. Under the chips were potatoes and beans. 
His Benedict won the food face off though! I'd probably order that next time we go in. The pork belly was slightly crispy and paired very well with the Benedict sauce. 

Our server told us they are working on finishing their Bloody Mary bar. It get very busy on the weekends! She suggested getting in early or making reservations.",FANt14cGQpOJskxQUQBK1g,1,1,5,6dKR3mWsnngVMxYfd_EE4A

The wait wasn't all that bad for a popular place on a Sunday + Mother's Day, the outdoor wait area is very relaxing.

From the moment they called us in that our table was ready, the staff was very accommodating.  They moved our table towards the back where there was a bit more breathing room since it was four adults and our 2-yr old in a high chair.  That's where the service got even better!!

Adrienne was amazing.  She was friendly and provided us 5-star service as our 2-yr old was not really into it.  She was one step ahead and made sure we (and he) had everything we needed to make our brunch out more enjoyable.  I could go on and on how wonderful she is.

As far as the food, we immediately ordered the monkey bread as our cousin recommended previous to our visit here and it did not disappoint, deliciousness.  Our tot decided he was gonna have an extra helping by grabbing my serving that was in front of me lol (thank goodness Daddy don't like sweets much).  I got a guava mimosa (yum) and the pastrami hash.  Crack open those poached eggs so they smother the hash and, oh my, taste buds are in 7th heaven.

Our server was very sweet and checked on us several times. Two of my friends had mimosas, one had the guava and the other had prickly pear and they both looked nice. I had a snickerdoodle latte and I really appreciated that it still tasted like coffee, not a sugar bomb like flavoured lattes at places like Starbucks.

Our table split some orders of monkey bread. I was a big fan and probably filled up on too many pieces, but it was warm and delightful. I had the pork belly green chile and it was very tasty. The salsa verde actually had a little kick to it, which I really appreciated as I feel like a lot of places don't make their salsas spicy enough.

It seems like some reviewers had issues with getting food out in a reasonable time. I like to hope it was just the kitchen working out some of the kinks since this location is still rather new. Our entrees weren't super quick to come out, but our monkey bread arrived expeditiously and the entrees for about eight people seemed to come out at a pretty reasonable time.

Overall, it was a pretty good experience. I'm more likely to go to the other Kitchen Table as I live in Henderson, but if I was having brunch with friends on this side of town, I'd definitely come here again.",1auPK3-H5ye5GHNaiqhUAw,1,0,4,nqmNjsSrVRhDdn4AfERjyg

Ambiance: as soon as we walked in, we noticed they put much thoughts into interior designing this place compared to the other location. It's bright, spacious, and modern. It is quite a nice environment for a brunch that's not on the strip or casinos. 

Service: the waiter was nice but the service from the bus fell short. It seems a bit unorganized. Also, each menu that we received had certain pages missing. 

Food: overall, the food was way too salty, over seasoned and not very appetizing. 

1. Money bread (5/5): probably the best thing we had on the menu. Not overly sweet, fluffy and chewy. From there, it went downhill on other dishes.

2. Pork belly green chilie (3/5): it's not bad for the first bite but it gets quite salty and greasy. Tortilla chips were soggy as well. 

3 Pork belly Benedicts (2/5): can't taste much of the spice from the jalapeño hollandaise sauce but the saltiness. Benedicts were soggy. House potato was over cooked and over seasoned. Very different than the Benedicts I remember from the original location. 

4 honeycomb cappuccino (4/5): it's pretty tasty and the portion is huge too.

4924398,2017-12-22,3,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Seriously needs to have a meeting and figure out what they are-
Firstly, it's obviously hipster-millennial-man bun-no clue how to take a concept and execute properly type of establishment.
The name inspires (at least to me) a ""homestyle"", family experience with the ability of modern Vegas standard being injected into the cafe styling-  
Of course hipsters have to ruin this.  Hostess is dress nicely and once walking in the hostess station is simple but clean and modern but is next to a coffee bar with obviously high end tools- 
Decor has ZERO resemblance of continuity-  wooden, nice styling tables (modern ""home style"") but the rest is something you'd expect to see out of a much more ""elegant"" style evening restaurant.  2 seriously conflicting concepts.
So- hostess dressed like an upscale place, but the ""manager"" or whomever she was is dressed hipster plaid dress shirt and leggings............  waitress and coffee bar staff wearing a modern take on the homestyle apron- while the waiters wear a clean T-shirt- 
Ok.

Now comes the menu-  WOW-  some things just shouldn't be put together.  And again- ZERO CONTINUITY OF IDEA.  You have ""upscale"" items but it's printed on blueish cardstock type paper and then stapled together in the upper corner-------------  
Zero kid friendly items- ok, so it's not a kid friendly place, that's fine. 
Ordered my daughter the short stack and side of fruit.
I ordered smoked salmon Benedict 
Wife got smoked sausage hash
Kind of mixing homestyle flavors with upscale flavors yet again-  but ok, we will go with it.

Side of fruit comes out within maybe 8-10 minutes-  seriously-  who in their right mind crams a bunch of fruit into a water glass and then slaps on a heaping serving of whipped cream on top that actually dripping down the side and with ZERO standards even if it were at a Denny's .......... asked for a plate just so I could get the cream off and get the fruit out.  Cream was tasty, fruit was ok.

Pancakes come out about 5 minutes later-  cool, no complaints except they were kind of oddly ""wet"" inside.  Not raw- not undercooked- just squishy.

Waited 7 minutes between the pancakes and my wife's hash.  Comes out in a little cast iron skillet sitting on top of a folded cloth napkin (not too stable or safe in my eyes) with some toast.  All sitting on a flat black ceramic ""wood-look"" plank.
We wait--------------5 minutes later almost-
My Benedict comes out- remember, Benedict is a poached egg- what happens when you slice into a poached egg..........
My Benedict and potato are sitting all together on that same black ceramic wood-look FLAT plank.............I was nice and asked for a separate plate instead of just cutting in and letting the yolk spew all over and right off the plank onto the table. 

Food quality was below average-  all of it (minus the pancakes) was not very hot at all- even the skillet was easily handled bare handed- 
The skillet was swimming in grease, and the toast even left grease marks on the cloth napkin.  My wife was not impressed and I spit out the bite I took-  any quality cook knows with a sausage that you slice and throw away the tied ends- well, guess what my bite had in it.....mmmmmmmmmm ties end yum (being facetious)

The Benedict was ok- barely warm- salmon was probably slightly over portioned and was piled higher on one side so the egg and avocado were almost falling off.  Hollandaise was ok tasting but was too little for the amount of avocado and salmon portion.  The potato's that were served with it I only took a single bite of- there was a greater ratio of grease than potato.

Basically, the establishment needs to figure out what they are going for concept wise, needs chefs that know what they are doing and definitely needs an expediter to organize an order coming out all at once instead of plate by plate with several minute gaps between each.

On top of ALL this mangled mess- my wife took my daughter to the bathroom and it looked like it hadn't been maintained since the opening.  Unclean in general, no toilet seat covers and the top hinge of the door was apparently so tight or not aligned that my wife had a hard time opening the door.

Instagram had me so excited for this place and it just was not what I was hoping ...

First of all they had open hours listed wrong on their Instagram it says 8am and since coming from my moms work we ended up there early and as it's not my side of town we ended up waiting for 9am which is fine but still not really wise so definitely don't post 8am on your posts anymore ...

Secondly the eggs Benedict classic had eggs that weren't cooked which made it where my mom couldn't eat hers ...

Last but most disappointing was my Bloody Mary pitcher which was my only reason for trying his place out .. I did it for the gram but my food and Bloody Mary tasted so bad I didn't even want to post it and shout out the place because I feel like the bartender was so annoyed that he had to make it that he added a gallon of pepper which isn't really needed since it already had jalapeño bacon plus a zillion other food items that aren't really needed and frankly I am not even sure there was any vodka in it which didn't matter cause overall it just was not any good ...

The male bartender seemed lost and their bar menu came on several separated sheets of paper.  Not impressed but the menu looked good so we got a table for dinner.

Waiter Alex was very nice and asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks.  Took almost 10 minutes to get a refill from the bar - not his fault.
We ordered an appetizer.  My husband ordered the beet salad with fried goat cheese and I ordered crab bisque.  He received his salad and my bisque came out almost 10 mins later (my husband timed it on his phone).  We ordered dinner.  My husband ordered chicken and beef skewers and I ordered a double pork chop with apple dressing.  Meanwhile some friends of the owner/manager came in .. some sitting at the bar ... some sitting at a table.  The food and drinks were flowing.  After 1 hour, we asked Alex for our check.  No food..ridiculous.  He kept coming by saying it would be out soon but it never came.  He finally started avoiding us (can't blame him) because the food still was not ready and there may have been 5 tables with people.  

The manager/owner came over and I told him the story.  Didn't really seem phased and did pick up our check which he should have.  We went nearby to DW Bistro and dinner was great!",-NWJI92Jol3cCOfLq7fWaQ,0,0,1,bqqBX-TgXIHMFTLGALZdDQ

When I think of potatoes for breakfast, they're usually cubed or wedged and sauteed. There were also some salty spots in the potatoes. I'm not sure why.  I would hesitate to eat here again.

Not one that makes you feel like you are at a quaint country home location. The table we were sat at moves with even the slightest amount of pressure, the chairs and wall ""booths"" are very uncomfortable forcing you to sit forward making it difficult to relax. We ordered brunch appetizers. I got the monkey bread that came first. It was dry, hard, and lacked enough caramel to even soften up the bread. Our waitress then brought out condiments including an EMPTY ketchup bottle. After 20 minutes they finally brought out the other appetizer of one biscuit. It was like a rock that was separated and then places on a greasy griddle that only made it denser. The jam was the only good thing so far. Meanwhile, we have not seen our waitress. She didn't even bring out the biscuit. We were out of the water and the person who dropped the rock biscuit off didn't even notice the empty glass. Another 10 minutes later we got our food. I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich which was so saturated with oil making the sandwich so heavy and soggy. I tried to eat the middle part, then just the filling but I just couldn't get through it.

5279858,2017-12-25,2,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Officially opened on 12/18/17 for Breakfast and Lunch, Dinner service set to launch the day after Christmas, it was just five days after Friends & Family that a seat was taken at Kitchen Table Squared at The Gramercy, Chef Javier Chavez out greeting guests on arrival but soon returning to a kitchen where his presence thus far appears crucial as wait times for even simple plates extend past half an hour.

Intended as a three-meal expansion of the Henderson breakfast and brunch flagship, approximately 90% of the current daytime menu identical but the Restaurant not yet ""doing"" Waffles per the server, it was as mid-volume pop-tunes played overhead that the decision was made to begin with a Baked Alaska Latte, the bruleed cloud of Meringue on top drizzled with Fruit Syrup and visually quite impressive while the blend of Coffee and Cream was smooth and silky, though only luke-warm as presented.

Classy enough to serve as a good Date-spot at night and comfortable in the daylight, the varied textures and polished woods creating a feel akin to Kitchen Table number one despite Squared's significantly larger footprint, it was as the Latte was delivered that an order was placed for two of the menu's new plates, the aforementioned Waffle replaced by French Toast at the recommendation of a pleasant young female server who did an excellent job touching tables and apologizing for delays to multiple patrons.

Perhaps 1/6 full at noon, the crowd a mix of young families and retirees with no obvious business sector presence yet, it was clearly in an attempt to pacify lengthy waits that items such as Muffins and Shakes were offered from the Barista station approximately twenty minutes after the order was placed, a ""Cookie Monster"" Milkshake featuring housemade Chocolate Chip Cookie both on-top and mixed with Soft Serve once again showing great flavor and smooth texture without being too over-the-top.

Spending some of the delay exploring, the Private Dining Room and back-right alcove pleasantly secluded while the area immediately ahead of the doors offers a much better vantage for people watching, it was finally forty-five minutes after sitting down that the all-new Candied Orange French Toast arrived, the Whipped Cream melted and soaking into subtly Citrus Brioche that certainly needs no Syrup.

Quickly following sweet with savory, a careless male that Javier had scolded earlier for delivering plates to the wrong table plopping down a board and sending the Biscuit skittering, it was after he bare-handed it back onto the plate that two poached Eggs were popped amidst an excellent Duck Hash, the 'Pastrami' bold and rich while the crispy Sweet Potatoes blended nicely with sautéed Onions.

Bringing over a former Andiron Pastry Chef for Desserts, the Monkey Bread and several Muffins from Henderson now made across town, it was with three new items that lunch came to a finish, the Tiramisu in a jar fairly forgettable as the Ladyfingers were dry while the Apple Pie could have used a bit more time in the oven to warm it at the center, though the Carrot Cake was pretty much perfect with tangy Cream Cheese frosting and a complex spice profile.

*** At this point still not up to speed, the lengthy delay in opening now appearing to be compromised by a last-minute sprint to the finish without accounting for staff training or expediting for a much larger space, Kitchen Table Squared nonetheless shows potential to be quite good, though for now fans may want to stick with the original, particularly if time is a concern.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,3,_7DmH-DConCoQt5ELU_rDA

Our server, Stacy, is also the bartender and he's fairly pleasant but the nature of his job has kept him busy so he's just come by once to tell us that the wait for the food is going to be a bit longer because ""the kitchen is backed up"". I'm chuckling a bit at this because I had just read reviews from other users about how they had similar experiences. Let me just say that their kitchen is ""backed up"" from seven tables. I literally just counted. This place has a BUNCH of tables (certainly more than the seven that are seated). If it's taking an hour for food just from a barely filled dining area, how do they expect to even function if their restaurant is ever at max capacity. Makes no sense. There are a bunch of servers walking around and you can tell they feel bad for their customers because the kitchen is taking forever.

Oh, we just got our starter!! The person who delivered it (I think might be a manager) said, ""Sorry about that guys, we had a lunch rush."" HAHA what rush? YOU HAVE LIKE 25 SOULS IN HERE, THIS IS NOT A ""RUSH"".

It really is a shame because this place is really cute!! But we will certainly never come back. We'll make the drive to try the Henderson one since the food seems decent and that location has great reviews.

UPDATE! All the food came out shortly after the starters arrived. Mom got the veggie hash and I got the smoked salmon benedict. Veggie hash was underwhelming and over salted near the bottom of the pan. The hollandaise sauce for the benedict was a bit flavorless - like watery mayo. BUT they put a lot of salmon on it and the potatoes on the side were nice. For starters, we got the crab avocado dip - decent, non-oily chips, the dip was pretty good - only a few chunks of crab found. And the monkey bread - THIS MIGHT BE THEIR REDEEMING DISH! Delightfully fluffy bread with the perfect amount of sweetness *insert heart eyes emoji*.

Next time will be lunch !,FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,0,0,4,adO2ZjsXhq_n4r9r2JD_hQ

The menu is a bit eclectic...but in a good way. There is definitely something for everyone here. As a new restaurant there are a few minor growing pains they need to work through, but the food is excellent and this is the type of restaurant that we locals need to get out and support!",pFEszQn1-Y5N6VpX8G8snw,0,0,5,VzCjssx5axrynZDLbcI30w

I thought it was pretty nice, especially the yard in the center. Which would make a great place to meet up and talk with friends, while you wait to be seated or hang around till your hungry. There is a couple of other venues, but Kitchen table is by far the best pick. 
I've been to the kitchen table In Henderson and absolutely love the whole social watery and the food selections. So I was pretty excited that the Chef didn't change the menu up too much. I mean it already works out good!  
Upon my visit to the new location, I opted to try there fabulous Bloody Mary, and boy was I blown away!  First timer over here... I was amazed with all the fixings it came with!  It was a whole complete meal, and it also had a kick to it.  I would definitely order it again and share it with my hubby.
I also opted to order the strawberry French toast.
The cuts where thick and very fulfilling. I love the sweet, strawberries and fresh cream. So good!  It definitely reminded me of honey toast but a bit softer in texture!  Overall my trip was so worth the time traveled and the calories devoured.  Kudos to the Chef Javier!",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,5,5,5,m6lOpglVn0NDkISyVjICcA

5965942,2018-04-25,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Pay more attention to housekeeping. We were the first ones in the door at 9am. I used the restroom and noticed that the restroom had not been serviced before opening. It should have been spotless as I was probably the first one to use it that day. Also we were sitting by the wall and we both noticed that the ledge had a thick layer of dust on it.

The waiter was friendly but useless. We split a strawberry shortcake french toast for dessert. He did not bring us an extra plate despite us asking for it when we placed our order. We found the french toast awkward to eat. There were 3 large hunks on the plate; they should have been sliced to be more manageable but I guess they were going for eye appeal over practicality. [Why can't you have both?] Also, there was not enough strawberry sauce with it. I actually had to put sugar on it because it wasn't sweet enough.

The waiter brought our bill while we were still eating but told us to 'take your time.' Good riddance.  They need to up their game here. Let's go back to old-school professionalism.",gL87f2_zTmQv_j2W_p_gMQ,0,0,3,FJRzCOSXdwhAX8sk4I5kZA
5995169,2018-05-28,1,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"The first time we stopped by, they were very friendly and the whole experience was five stars. Food was impeccably delicious and service was amazing. But that was their soft opening. 

The second time around, we were so excited to get the same experience but was surprised at how different it became. First off, on a Saturday morning, it was not busy which is surprising to its Kitchen Squared counterpart from Henderson. 

We ordered monkey bread which we were hoping to get before our main meal, but they forgot to bring it in. We didn't really want it in the end but felt bad because they brought it after we ate our meal. It was honestly disappointing. 

At this point, I don't really remember what I got besides the fact that it was gyro, but with that said, it was underwhelming. I also got the hot cocoa, and it tasted like average. This restaturant does not match it's Henderson counterpart which is a shame, because I would have loved to like this restaunt. Overall, never coming back.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,2,1,2,sEVc0H85CXpwB6XP8BvWvw
5996990,2017-12-29,0,zr42_UsWfaIF-rcp37OpwA,"Food: Amazing. I had the Smoked Salmon Benedict and my coworkers had the Pork Belly Benedict and the Chicken Sandwich. The lox and poached egg flavors worked perfectly together and the potato hash was a refreshing alternative to normal breakfast potatoes. I also had the Mexican Hot Chocolate which, while it could have been a little spicier, was delicious with toasted marshmallows on top. 

Ambiance/Design: Beautiful. Purple and grey aren't traditional colors for a restaurant, but they work really well here. The layout and lighting worked perfectly for brunch, and they looked like they could work really well during dinner hours too.

Service: Attentive and friendly. Our glasses were never empty and food came out promptly. 

We're so glad we came during lunch, and we can't wait to come back!",hDamkEc4NvaXDMD1CMtG2A,0,0,5,noRE4YO-wXcY5E_fyK2zwg
