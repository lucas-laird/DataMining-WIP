The fish to rice ratio was incredible unlike some other sushi spots. I had the all you can eat lunch special and man it hit the spot. I could not stop ordering it was so good. The ladies that were serving us didn't give us a hard time about ordering a lot of food. They would just check up on us here and there. Very nice waitresses and very helpful with suggesting their popular items on the menu. The dessert was also delicious. We ordered the fried icecream, a popular item, to finish off our meal. This is a clean restaurant on the bottom floor right next to yosi vapes. I will definitely be coming back! Thank you.",4sK-tMmxPeYSeVzWplUi3A,0,0,5,sPNl_cgC82m4e_MV-m0Edw

Notable Items ordered:
The Shit
Peng
Bulgogi
Spider Roll
""The Best of the Best"" Roll
Honey! Screaming ""O"" Roll
Ocean Trout Nigiri
Surf Clam Nigiri
Vegas Roll
""Just Try It"" Roll

The Fish to Rice ratio was really amazing as it provided more fish than the rice to ensure that you can eat more and more. The quality of the fish tastes fresh and generously sliced. The waiter service is phenomenal as they would patiently take your order with efficient accuracy. Drangon, one of the sushi chefs there would provide us with chef specials with enthusiasm! The sushi was served quickly after I have ordered and the time spent waiting was even more enjoyable as they had Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" playing on the television. Their Lunch Ayce starts at 11:30am-4pm and their dinner starts at 4pm-11pm. I'm not exactly sure what the difference between the lunch and dinner items would be, but I am excited to try! I've decided to come here Tuesday night for another amazing ayce experience!",uEOpGNR4ftCwb33MDvvhaA,1,0,5,P-1Cs9egr-HYkmM4UfWGAw

240675,2016-01-30,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"It makes me sad that I cannot give Sushi Neko more than three stars because I do love their salmon nigiri. 

I went here with a friend, the first time. They were quick with orders and food. (That time, there were only two tables and four people in the restaurant).

So... I came back, again. This time, with my boyfriend. There were seven tables with a total of nineteen customers seated. They had four servers and it looks like three sushi chefs. I would have to say, it was a very disappointing experience. It was my boyfriend's first time in this place and he'll never be back again (within an hour time frame he was only able to eat two sushi rolls). 

Their nigiris, particularly the salmon, tasted good. Their appetizer selections weren't as extensive as other all you can eat sushi places I've eaten in like Jjanga or Goyemon. I want to comment on the taste of their rolls but sadly, we weren't able to eat more than two because they were extremely slow with making the rolls. They are also very skimpy with the tissues and ginger slices. 

Customer service wise... I think they were very friendly people. I just feel bad for the front line employees because they are the ones who have to experience the customers' anger and dissappointment in regards to their sushi and other orders being made very slowly. 

I think this place shouldn't be an all you can eat place. Their sushi chefs can't handle the influx of people and orders (that's just with nineteen customers and you can already heavily feel the slowness in making the orders). Apparently, they know about the slowness in making the rolls but haven't found a way to remedy it. I hope they will find a solution. They aren't a bad restaurant just very ill prepared for the type of restaurant they chose to be.

Thus... if you ever do decide to try Sushi Neko... I would suggest that you come during a time when they are completely not busy. Furthermore, just order nigiri sushis. Don't order the rolls. If you do order the rolls... do expect a very long wait.",HdR-lOoagkl4pQC-xvBlyQ,2,0,3,lrWf1ZI5yk-loT0NKeHf9A

We came in as a party of four and were immediately seated. The first thing that I noticed about the restaurant was how clean and vibrant it looked. The decor on the walls reflects a Japanese theme (as sushi restaurants generally), but with a pop culture twist. 

Our servers Carlos and Hana were very knowledgeable about the menu and explained everything well. They offered great suggestions and followed thru on several of them. We had a smattering of rolls, ranging from the mundane tiger roll to the succulent Chanel roll. My personal favorite was the shit however. I'll let you figure that out on your own.

At first, we thought the service was going to be slow, we were there on Saturday night, but it turned out to be perfectly paced.

The food here is just as great as Sakana. I was glad to see the consistency of their recipes. The ratio of rice to fish is always what keeps me coming back to this restaurant. The fish is very fresh and sliced in large pieces. They give you little rice so you can enjoy and eat as much as you want without getting full on rice.

Nigiri- Salmon Belly (w/ Fresh Wasabi), salmon, unagi, yellowtail, ocean trout, super white tuna

Had to check it out for myself! $20.95 for AYCE lunch (until 4:00pm), $25.95 for AYCE dinner. Was a little put off that we had to be put on a wait list despite there being many tables available (they said it was due to the kitchen being backed up with orders). Never heard of this before, but I tried to keep an open mind -- as the space as well as decor was very appealing. Incase you didn't know, NEKO means cat in Japanese -- so the recurring theme throughout was obviously feline, which is so cute! We took the wait time to look over the menu, as it is surprisingly extensive with so many options.

I don't think I can say this about anywhere else, but I enjoyed EVERYTHING we ordered off the menu. This included:

- the shit (x3)
- pang (x2)
- baked green mussels (x6)
- oysters (x2)

- grand canyon roll 
- king of the lobster roll 
- lisa lisa roll

Thank you sushi gods for blessing me with a sushi restaurant where I actually feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for! Trust me, when you see the menu.. you'll know what I'm talking about. It's as big as a PLACEMAT, filled with items front to back, corner to corner.

I wouldn't say it's a hidden gem, but it's tucked in the SF Greenland strip mall on Spring Mtn, just past Decatur. You'll see it when you're about the enter the underground parking, it's right in the corner. Interior is like hip/Japanese, more trendy and wooden seating areas. We came in as a large group, and as we were there I noticed that although the dining area wasn't very large, the space was used efficiently and I didn't see people wait very long compared to other joints where you literally have to wait 30 mins to an HOUR to sit and eat.

Here's the breakdown:
1 order (2pcs) Garlic Tuna Nigiri (5/5) - WOW. Just wow. Very delicious, packed with flavor. And that fish-rice ratio though.. how do you say it? Yaaaaaas.

1 order Cajun Albacore Nigiri (5/5)-  *Please refer to Garlic Tuna* And add another ""yaaaaas.""

1 order (2pcs) Gyoza (5/5) - Crispy on the outside, steaming on the inside. And the sauce was very flavorful where as other places literally give you soy sauce, this one had other flavor/seasonings added.

1 order (3pcs) Fried Calamari (4/5) - Hot and crispy, but nothing out of the ordinary. And it was served with sweet chili sauce, which I wasn't used to. And personal preference, I like the calamari rings compared to sticks.

Golden California Roll (5/5) - Basically a California Roll that's deep fried. My husband really enjoyed it!

Something Wrong Roll (5/5) - OMG. If you must get something, please get this roll. Topped with an assortment of fish and a deep fried something inside, there was a lot of flavor! It was so good.. I didn't want to share.

Chanel Roll (4/5) - Saw this on the ""Chef Recommends"" blackboard and had to give it a try. It was pretty good, I just would have preferred if it wasn't drenched in the white sauce. I feel like it really overpowered everything else.

Affogato Dessert (5/5) - Coffee and vanilla ice cream and they topped it with Frosted Flakes. If you love coffee and ice cream, this dessert is perfect for you. So simple, but yummy!

Coffee Mochi Ice Cream (5/5) - Nothing you cant get at an Asian market, but points because I love coffee and it helped me get the fishy taste out of my mouth.

We also sampled other dishes, but they will not affect the overall review:

Yellowtail Nigiri (0/5) - I did not like this. Plain and simple.

Seared Salmon and Lemon Nigiri (2/5) - If this we're prepared differently or there was like soy sauce or SOMETHING ELSE.. it was literally straight lemon. And I would rather have cooked salmon or raw salmon, not in between.

Pang Appetizer (4/5) - It's bread with something and cheese. It was different, not my favorite. Just not a fan of cheese with sushi! *Personal preference

The Sh!t Appetizer (5/5): I wouldn't say it's the *poop*, it it was pretty darn good. Hot and fresh from the fryer, it's crispy and delicious!

Also, if it's your birthday, as it was for someone in our party, they cut the lights, play a song & pretty much have the whole restaurant sing happy birthday to you! Super awesome! If you hate things like that when you're eating, don't be a grump.

Overall, great place! I can't wait to come back again. Definitely worth the price we paid & cant wait to try the other items that they have.",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,0,0,4,Dl96CC1Aw6y7d8snaYGpfQ

Saw the reviews for this place. Thought we would check it out. Kinda hidden in the corner of the strip mall on spring mountain. 

wasn't busy when we got there. decor was something different. restaurant is clean. 

When it came to the food, was very disappointed by the quality and size. 

for starters, we ordered ikura (circumference) was the size of a quarter and poorly presented. ordered saba (the waitress didn't know what i was talking about) so i told her it's mackerel. when that came, it was falling apart like it has been cooked well done. taste was griddy. also ordered the garlic tuna, the quality of the fish was tough. not sure if they cut it at the wrong angle but that was the first time i've ate it that tough. also had to keep reminding when i ordered before it even came out. probably waited a good 15 minutes and it was not busy at the time we were there. 

my wife ordered her regular rolls. but she also gyoza which was never brought out. 

in all honesty, probably won't be coming back here and will not be recommending this restaurant to any family/friends.",Uh1bOIzjzpaS5IqvzH_ENw,1,0,1,U_5uB7bB0Dko-RWoCDoadQ

1404227,2016-05-12,8,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Just like its sister restaurant, Sakana... I don't really get this place. Here they do some things really well. But other times it's like WTF... I'll go further into detail (BTW this review can be copied-and-pasted to Sakana as well).

Came here one day after hearing all the hot buzz going on with this spot. Like I mentioned before, Neko is the follow up restaurant to the uber-popular sushi restaurant Sakana on the East side of town. Neko is centrally located in Chinatown on Spring Mountain Rd in a strip mall with other popular eateries nearby. The interior is nicely appointed, and has a very chill vibe. I sat at the sushi bar this time, and was able to watch the sushi chef at work. He was a cool dude and friendly. 

Ordered some food and it arrived in an appropriate amount of time. I can't remember exactly which was really good, or which one was so-so because it was months ago, but I'll give you a general idea on why this is a 3-star review, and it is based on the food. About 33% of the sushi was really good. The other 33% was just OK. And as for the final 33%, the fish should have been thrown out the previous day. Inconsistency would be the best word to describe Neko. Sakana and Neko are known for having large, long cuts of fish relative to the small amount of rice, which I think is the reason for the majority of the 5 star reviews for both restaurants. My argument is, ""If the fish and rice quality aren't good to begin with, does it matter if the fish cuts are large, and the rice is small?"" I dunno. The first half of my sushi experience, the rice was somewhat on the hard and cold side. The second half (they must have made a new rice) was too warm and soft. Inconsistency.

I doubt I would be coming back here, there is a glutton of AYCE sushi restaurants in the Valley, and I don't want to take a chance on a roller coaster experience. But I'm glad I was able to try it and see for myself what the story is. Morning glory.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,14,13,3,3hDA-D_1nNM1agJ5dInf8w
1409427,2017-05-07,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Came here for dinner after finding out A18 was closed recently. My friend and I really wanted some Korean chicken and beer. XD dang those Korean dramas ! 

This is what we ended up going to since myself and her didn't feel like going to Yunnan Tasty Garden. I totally didn't feel like eating spicy food that day. Nor that amount of oil included. Or salt.... anyways I digressed. 

My friends were seated already when I had arrived and ordered. They had ordered a variety of stuff and I just sat and waited for the food.

Sushi Neko is popular as it is a sister restaurant to Sakana, who also owns Hwaro KBBQ. They are known to have the same style of serving sushi as a lot of restaurants in California. By that, I mean large fish portion to small rice portion ratios. Fish is long enough to wrap about the rice, if not overlap. LOL I do like to have a bit more rice though (than what was served) as too much fish can be a bit.... tiring after a while XD 

I think the restaurant had renovated a little bit as it looks a bit different since my last visit. Apparently according to some uh Q&A/Tips on yelp, it was under construction/renovation a month or so ago. 

Overall. Service was decent. The fish was pretty good quality this time. Forgot to opt out of all the toppings and sauces they put but it was still decent overall. Salmon belly, limited 1 order per person, was pretty fatty but thin and skinny (in comparison to everything else). Salmon (normal) was plated really nicely on a round plate, making it look like a flower. Some pieces were pretty fatty. some were pretty lean. Super white tuna and yellowtail was pretty decent as well. They had forgotten my salmon skin handroll and ikura orders but after a while, I was quite full to care anyway. Lol. 

My fear of returning to this place was that the fish would be frozen like my previous visit a year ago. But luckily, it was much better this time around. 

Lots of random Korean Pop music videos playing but it was great when Taeyeon came up at the end of the meal. What a finish... XD ! haha ahah..ha..?",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,3,n23AgEPZI0PPE3Ucrnv66Q

Service was GREAT. Everyone was friendly. They dealt with our shinanegans of 40 orders of yellowtail right off the bat. In all honesty, great service.

Food was great as well. Flavors were on point, freshness was on point. While the fish was good, the temperature of the rice was a little closer to the fish for my taste. Don't let that stop you though. The size of the dwarfs the rice. This is excellent for any fish lovers.

My only gripe, which prevented the me from putting 4 stars, was there was a bone in my yellowtail. While everything else was great, removing bones is an essential skill to have. Will update when I go again.

Sushi Neko is the same AYCE concept and has the same exact menu as Sakana since they are brother/sister restaurants. The only difference is that Sushi Neko offers their dinner option all day which I highly recommend because you'll be paying a difference of $5 more for more expensive choices of nigiri and rolls without rice. Some items was a miss but it's a good AYCE option if you like endless amounts of sushi. 

Pros

Service: You order from their menu and everything is made as you order so it's a fresher option than getting your food under heat lamps. The service was fast and friendly and not once did we felt rushed. 

Nigiri: For the most part, all the sashimi were good and there was very little rice per order. Some items were a total miss but that's mainly items that needed to be cooked. 

Dinner: If you're here during lunch hours, the dinner option is worth upgrading to since they have a section of ""no rice"" rolls which I enjoyed for AYCE. One of the options was a poke salad which had little amounts of salad but plenty pieces of assorted cube sashimi. The dinner options also gives you 2 pieces of uni nigiri, ocean trout nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, and oysters per person. 

Options: It's not limited to just nigiri or sushi rolls, there are a lot of cooked items in their appetizers section and they even offer hot skewers with shrimp or scallops wrapped in bacon. 

Seating: It turned out to be a good thing going here instead of Sakana. While the menu and the pricing are the same, the seating here is a lot more spacious which is great for big groups and a lot cleaner.

I like the way the menu is set up. It's organized and the font size is easy to read. They truly revived the interior decor, but kept the dining areas the same set up as the previous restaurant. It's in the same plaza as Kaba Curry, Cafe Teaze, and Swish. 

This place gets a BIG PLUS for offering half rolls, allowing you to expand your options. The dinner price of $25.95 and lunch price of $20.95 are comparable to other AYCE sushi. There is a time limit. 80 min for dinner and 60 min for lunch.

1702406,2016-03-18,2,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"First of all, spelling mistakes are already a turn off. The specials board stated ""salmon cappacio"" and ""stripped bess."" When we entered, there was no greeting. We sat down and got one menu. I mean, it was not busy so there were no reason as to why we could not get two menus automatically, but we had to ask. First time here and the waiter did not explain anything just threw the menu on the table and walked away. There are two menus, one clearly says AYCE but the other did not. Was that their regular menu? We had no idea. So when another waitress came by we told her it is our first time and she said ""ok."" Thanks for the welcome and the explanation of the AYCE. We had to ask and found out everything on the other menu is included too, but it was weird because it had curry plates and alcohol so I don't think it was all included. She just said it is all included. Not true because regular drinks like tea was not even included. Within a few minutes of sitting down I heard the people behind us ask where all their items were and the waitress sounded clueless as to them even ordering those items and said she would put it in. They said they already waited a long time and they just wanted to get out and they stood up and left. Another turn off was our original waiter coughed in his hand two times and then went to pick up plates and serve food. I had to ask him to wash his hands. Could have been why the rest of the night was downhill, but have we not heard of cough in the forearm or wash your hands since you are serving food?  From there we had the waitress who had no personality and did not get half our orders in and we had to follow up many times and when we reminded her she did not apologize or even seem like she was aware she made a mistake. Maybe it was her twin sister we ordered from. 

My friend asked me what my Yelp review would be since she knew after a few dishes. I actually felt it was 3 stars and said let me tell you after we get more dishes. Well by the end it was down to 0 stars for me. 

Out of all the items we ordered, it was so slow that at times we had to recap with each other what we had ordered and what was missing. Most fish came one at a time on a plate. Would make more sense if they put a bunch of nigiri on a plate, maybe they could keep track of what they had sent out or some other system since the one they have does not work. 

Quite a few of the raw fish pieces looked like throw away pieces. I took one for the team and put it in my mouth and it was tough and had large slices in it, looked like it had been through a garbage disposal. Uni was off color and my friend said the taste was bad. Some fish would come on a plate and all were different colors, but it was the same fish. It was not consistent. Ocean trout was soaked in sauce and rice fell apart as you pick up the fish. We asked for majority of the items without sauce except yellowtail yuzu since I like yuzu. When we got the yellowtail it was plain with no jalapeno and no sauce but we wanted the sauce on the yellowtail. We told them and they seemed to get angry but we did order it regular because I like yuzu. We never got our ""salmon cappacio"" and many other orders. We had to ask and it was clear that it was never put in or somehow lost, because the waitress would write it down again. 

About the sashimi salad- it was different both times I ordered it. One time it was good with very light ponzu sauce and it had tempura. The second order had a heavier overpowering dressing which was too strong and the tempura was gone. 

Waiters were really odd here, no customer service skills at all. There is one tall guy who never spoke a word, a waitress who was a perfect candidate for ""Clueless"" and a waiter who wreaked of cigarette smoke and would throw the food slide the plate on the table and whisk away quickly. We did encounter one friendly and ""all together"" rare waiter there but it was not until the end. He was the best of all of them and wish we had him the whole time. It was only his second day. 

I can go on and on, but in summary is the food was not good at all and the service was terrible.  

The only part of the whole meal I liked was the salmon belly and salmon. The super white tuna was also different than what I have had but I liked it. I hope they can hire some better staff and work on bringing out all of the orders as well as their timeliness otherwise I don't see them lasting.

We were there over 3 hours and I enjoyed my time with my friend, but it should not take 3 hours to bring the things we ordered on a week night.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,1,1,1,Egw1rtaCFUBgHfam-DoDAQ
1723161,2017-06-05,1,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Sushi was really good, but omg was service incredibly slow for a Wednesday night. So slow, this review is borderline 2 stars. My sister and I came last before 7pm didnt leave until almost 9. When we first got there there were maybe 5 other tables and 3 servers. I'm thinking one of the servers shift ended and its down to 2 servers and within 10 minutes a lot of people come in to eat. At first all the nigiri comes very fast, but we waited super long for our rolls. They forget some of our apps and 2 of the rolls we ordered. At this point were too full and annoyed to care. 
Our server never came back to check on us and I had to tell the busser. Ask for the check and dessert and they only bring my dessert and forget my sisters. Idk if I should feel bad that they were understaffed and my server had almost 10 tables, but they should at least have the bussers start taking orders. 
I felt sorry for the table next to us. They were done with all their food by time we entered and they waited 20 minutes for their check and dessert. Overall, come here for lunch.

Great decorations, good sushi considering that it's only $27 per person and you get 80 minutes to eat. 

The service is slow--so slow it dampened my hunger :/ But since the place was empty they let us stay past 80 min. Love the generous fish to rice ratio! Highly recommend the salmon belly, no. 1 chef makes, best of the best, sashimi roll and double dragon.

Important note: you can get sushi by the roll here but don't do that! They'll just serve you the same rolls as what is served to AYCE crowd. I made that mistake and had to convert to AYCE after the first roll came out--too small! 

Note, I can eat raw fish and am not one to hate on sushi/sashimi for being Americanized and having lots of sauce--I like sauce. My one complaint is that some fish pieces came out icy like they hadn't been thawed all the way through.

A few co-workers and I had tried this place when they first opened (probably in 2016) and we loved it! I don't know why, but I had fallen off and hadn't eaten here in a while.

Last month my boyfriend was craving sushi so we came in, and we've been back at least once a week since! The fish to rice portions on the nigiri are absolutely ridiculous (in the best way possible). The fish tastes soooo fresh. My favorites are lemon salmon, white tuna, and the albacore! My boyfriend only gets rolls and his favorites are the Lobster King and the Popcorn Lobster. 

The variety of desserts are what really makes them unique! The mini honey toast is the perfect size and tastes great. I've also tried the green tea ice cream, tiramisu, mochi, affogato, and the birthday cake! :) All were great.

 For starters, my friend and I chose all of the ""one time only"" dishes. The salmon belly was so perfectly fatty. I also really enjoyed the oyster which had a spicy soy sauce (?) spooned over it and was topped with masago and green onion. I would probably not order the sashimi tower again because it was just a mix of fish in a sweet mayo over a fried wonton. It was a little too heavy for me. The salmon nigiri was awesome. I just can't get over how much fish was given for each portion. 

For desserts, we just got a coffee mochi and affogato. The mochi was just one of those premade ones that you can get in a pack of 6. Affogato was topped with cornflakes and almonds (I want to say it was honey bunches of oats, but I'm not sure). They were nothing to write home about, but they were good palate cleansers.

Taste wise, everything was fresh. Portions were great. I actually didn't get to try many rolls because I wanted to get my money's worth in fish LOL but I can definitely see myself coming back.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,37,28,4,11I_lKBnHlY_z2MgMyHwjw

I'd move in here if they'd let me. It's a hidden nook downstairs from Cafe Teaze, cozy with cat decor and art everywhere- trinkets on shelves on the walls, photos at the bar, and even drawn on the menu!

Menu has a huge selection of apps, nigiri, and rolls, broken down into specialty, baked, fried, hand, and riceless rolls. Their selection of riceless rolls is on par with Jjanga (~5 choices), and they are well executed. As others have said, nigiri is fresh and generously cut, and rice is proportionate. They also have a selection of grilled skewers (haven't tried 'em), and desserts are limited to 1/person- but many are made in house and higher quality than elsewhere.  I was so pleased with my first meal here that I literally came back within a week. Same great product and experience.

The only knock was the service was slow so make sure you load up on your order because they come by your table every 15 mins or so. The miso soup was the best I've had anywhere and the fish on the nigiri pieces was very generous as everyone describes in other reviews. One piece of advice is to make sure and order 1/2 rolls on the 8 piece styles.  The rolls are large and very filling, but we didn't think to ask until afterwards if they did 1/2 rolls. The last thought is that the music is loud and annoying as they play weird Asian pop videos, but will definitely be heading back.",DK2p49KuiEHCB3Vm15w4bA,0,0,4,B-xY_SWmT9fICTFk4DS4jQ

Our first server (Carlos) was fantastic and paid attention to all of our needs even for a large party. Shortly after , a different server (a woman , she never introduced herself) replaced him and service went downhill from there. She never had a nice attitude.

I had two of their hand rolls, both were delicious, and we had several half orders of the rolls on their menu. I love that they give you the option of only doing a half roll (4 pieces).

1853625,2016-02-20,1,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"After hearing good things about this place I finally managed to find a time to check out Sushi Neko , located where Shuseki used to be in Chinatown. 

Walked In with a group of 7 for dinner which is $25 per person. We were immediately greeted and seated as soon as we walk in, after we were seated our waiter then proceeded to give us a overview of the Premium specials that they offered for filling out or checking in(?) on yelp and explained to us how the ordering system worked. We were given 1 Paper menu and on the menu we were supposed to fill in on the side how many orders we wanted next to the name, one huge frustrating problem with this is that everything on the regular menu is NOT on the paper menu so this led to some confusion but we eventually just delt with it by writing everything we wanted that wasn't on the menu, on the back page. 
(If they don't tell you the specials, or if you want something specific that's not on the menu be sure to ask them right away as there are many things available that they don't put on either menu) 


(Note: I'll mostly be reviewing the things that I tried, as for what my friends ordered I did not try their rolls so i shall not review it)

 Appetizers - 

KFC(Korean Fried Chicken) - 2 Pieces per order of small chicken with a light amount of sauce topped on it. The KFC is really well made here compared to other places. The chicken was really juicy and it was not over-fried nor was the sauce overwhelming, Most importantly the fried chicken was not soggy at all. 

Pork Belly- 4 small pieces of pork belly covered it what seems to be teriyaki sauce(?) Not many complaints here. The Pork belly wasn't too fatty nor was it bland, the sauce that they used gave it a nice touch. 100/10 Best Appetizer here 

Salmon Carpaccio - (Premium/Compliments from the Chef) Really great and flavorful, can't really go wrong with this selection. Amount of sauce used for the slice that they give you is perfect. 

Bulgogi - 0 Pieces, idk never came out 0/10.

  All in all their selection of appetizers on the regular and premium menu are worth checking out! They're really good if you... you know... get them... 



Salmon, Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Cajun Tuna Nigiri - Salmon was just OK, nothing really great about it .In all the sushi places that I've been to I have never been disappointed in any variation of Tuna be it Garlic/Cajun/Regular, but Sushi Neko managed to do the impossible. . The regular tuna was just bland, soggy, it was pretty hard to finish. Cajun and Garlic Tuna (or should I say Cajun Tuna and Garlic Ponzu Tuna) were equally as bad, not only was the fish really chewy but it was DRENCHED in sauce which made it even more unenjoyable. 

Salmon Belly - (Limited to 2 orders per person) This is pretty much the best thing at Sushi Neko IF they have it. Very fatty, juicy, and flavorful just how Salmon Belly should be, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Fish to Rice ratio here is very good.


Other than the food being mediocre, the service was some of the worst I have experienced as well. One of the guys that started serving us was great(Carlos) , knew everything on the menu, was very friendly and helpful. Halfway into our dinner he was replaced with a Lady who had a very bad attitude and not helpful in any way, strangely enough it was around that time that our orders stopped showing up fast or stopped showing up at all, In total we were missing about 7 orders. Had Carlos stayed with us I'd give Sushi Neko 4 stars.
Very unlikely that I'll be coming back anytime soon, Sushi Neko still is new so I'll give them some time to overcome their growing pains before I try it again.",H95BCWxTwwfHYfdTZooXvg,1,1,2,aGcVZg-2bhhC91XcpolTEg

Stand out items: white tuna was superb!! so soft, sweet and melts in your mouth. The uni was also amazing, very sweet, very decadent, served cold and was delicious! Wish we could have gotten more!! Their spicy garlic edamame was actually  spicy (unlike other places where it is pretty mild) and had tons of garlic which was delicious! Their rolls were very good, nice variety, nice sauce and decent portion. 

Pros: The rice here is very small and the slice of fish is big...which was awesome! We actually got to eat more fish since the rice was small. They have a good selection of rolls that are half order so you can try more without being too full. 

Cons: Each person gets 1 order of oyster, but 1 order is only 1 piece whereas other places gives you 2 pieces per order. The miso soup did not have tofu which was strange (I thought tofu in miso soup was a must!!). 

Service was pretty good, very attentive, drinks were constantly refilled and dirty plates were immediately picked up. Although our server did forget a few of our items and we had to remind him a few times, not a big deal. Food also came out quickly.

Overall, I definitely recommend trying this place out and I will definitely return.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,1,0,4,OalH3IMQISLTMy0wZuVJog

However, today was my last visit at Sushi Neko. My family and I, a party of 8, (which is a pretty big sum of cash for Sushi Neko) were rudely greeted by a woman who seemed like she was already irritated by us. My uncle asked her how her day was, to be nice, and she said, ""Good. But I asked you how many people were in your group."" Well, excuse him for being polite, a skill she's clearly not capable of. 

Our would-be waitress tried to shove us all into two small tables at a booth, which would typically fit four. We asked her if we could move two of the two-seater tables together, since maybe she misheard us. She said something about how they were ""going to be too busy for us"" to move the tables to accommodate us, and then she stormed off. No management came to talk or intervene. We were all dumbfounded and kinda (really) angry. 

I was a bit sad since my family had been customers at Neko before, and we loved the food. I'd always ask to go to Neko for special celebrations, and my whole fam would come in for graduations, birthdays, and get-togethers. No matter how good the food is, though, we're not chumps who take being disrespected lightly. 

I'm giving Sushi Neko two stars for my previous experiences with them. Really great food, fun ambiance, and *once* friendly waitresses. It sucked cause my family (three dads included) was excited for some ayce sushi on Father's Day. 

We went to Sushi Kaya instead, where we were seated comfortably and served by very attentive and kind people. 

Sushi Neko-- please re-evaluate the values you have for customers who are not only fans but people. Your service treated us with a complete lack of respect today.",9zKhKrHwvRv2mAY27jxXpw,2,0,2,jUhwHKHxbje5NgsiWyVrtQ

I came here because of the reviews and even though I was nervous (because AYCE and good sushi do not usually go together) this was a very good experience.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The AYCE sushi menu was fairly extensive and had good offerings.

The nigiri was very good; fish was fresh, placed on a small piece of rice vs most AYCE places where they try to stuff you with rice.

Very tasty and well prepared.

This AYCE can give a lot of traditional sushi restaurants a run for their money.

So, why no 5 stars? Because when it came time to settle the bill, I whipped out my AMEX and they told me ""we do not take AMEX"". There was absolutely no sign anywhere warning customers ""we do not take AMEX"" so that is also a violation.

Thankfully, I did not have any other cars with me so it was either AMEX or I was getting a free lunch. Actually, after a 10' standstill where they were going back and forth with the manager (it felt like I was buying a used car!) and then telling me ""oh, it's going to cost us a $30 additional charge because we are not set up for Amex"" to the waitress claiming ""it will come out of my pay"" (ridiculous) I offered for me to go to my place of work (2 miles away) and retrieve another credit card. They did not want to do that even though I was promising them that I would not vanish...

All of a sudden, they said they would process my card but ""only for this time""...whatever!

It really left a bad taste in my mouth where this would have been a stellar experience and a solid 5-star review...

I love the sushi to rice ratio when it comes to their nigiri. I always rave to my friends and people I don't even know that if you're going to have AYCE sushi, go to Sushi Neko. You get more than your money's worth, the food is fast, the waiters are nice, the fish to rice ratio is almost unbeatable, and everything is also instagram worthy. 

I'll know if I'll like any sushi place by their salmon nigiri. Salmon nigiri is such a staple and basic, I believe it's equivalent to judging any boba shop by their milk tea. It's the standard. The salmon is so delicious! No only that, i usually don't order tuna nigiri, but this place offers ""Garlic Tuna Nigiri"" and it has made me fall in love with tuna!

Apparently there are quite a few of these in Vegas, but alas, we only had time for one...This one was fantastic! I'm glad that we ended up coming here. We came early on a Wednesday afternoon, so we had no problem getting a table (in fact, when we arrived there just before 5 PM, we were the only people there). 
The service is a bit odd. Despite us being the only people there and there being 2 servers, they seemed to be preoccupied. There also seemed to be not so much a language barrier as a speaking barrier. It was difficult to understand our servers because they either weren't very clear in their explanations or they mumbled and spoke so softly that that we could barely hear them. At first, we were confused as to what was included in the AYCE deal -- turns out it's EVERYTHING on their menu! There are some items where they limit the table to ordering one or one per person. They also had a BOGO on their alcohol. We took advantage of that and ordered sake. It was ok, but at $10 for 2 bottles, I'm not complaining. 
We ordered a ton of rolls!! It's good to come here with a group of people so you can order a bunch of things and get to try everything. As others have mentioned, they do a good job with the fish to rice ratio, so you actually get to enjoy the fish, instead of just stuffing yourself with rice. Additionally, their rolls come in smaller portions, which makes it ideal for trying a bunch of things. For example, some of their baked rolls only had 4 pieces. We weren't really sure what was what since the servers would bring out the dishes and then whisper/mumble the names of the rolls. Regardless, nearly everything we had was fantastic. 
The few standout ones, with names that I actually heard were: 
- The SHIT (appetizer): I have no idea what's in this (as this was mumbled/whispered to me), but it really is THE SHIT
- The lemon shrimp roll: Adding lemon to sushi is brilliant! It makes it refreshing and actually felt like an aperitif, so we could stuff ourselves with more sushi
- The lobster baked roll: this is some seriously oooey gooey delicious stuff. 
- Fried rolls: it's fried, need I say more?

Love the fish to rice ratio on the nigiri. So many options and they're all really tasty. Quality is great. Love the creativeness of some of the rolls or even some of the simplicity of them. It's all about what you are in the mood for. Sauce? No sauce? Fresh? Fried? No rice? They really do have something for everyone. Screaming O roll is one of my favorites. No rice. I also enjoy, crunch roll, spicy tuna, rock and roll, tiger roll and sashimi roll. 

Wait time to get in can sometimes be long but I feel it's worth it. Longest I've waited was 70 minutes. Least was 5 minutes. As soon as you order your foods to your table ASAP. The bus boy is quick at taking plates off your table which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. I hate staking plates on my table and it looking messy.

Not a huge fan of the creamy shrimp but the oysters and mussels make up for that miss. Delicious! I could have mussels all night. I actually ordered them three times. 

Pork belly is scrumptious! Straight from my lips to my hips. I have to get a few in every time. 

Skip the bacon wrapped scallops, they're too tiny for my liking, but taste good. Trying these won't take away from your appetite.

Like literally it was a mock clone! ..okay well not literally literally, but you'll find very close similarities. Some of the old favorites from sakana like ""the shit,"" a spicy crab/deep fried..well shit looking roll that you dip in spicy mayo and eel sauce makes a return here along as some new ones I've never seen before like ""the pong.""

Imagine a bruschetta and volcano roll meet and do the dirty, and have a delicious appetizer child, and thus, there you have it.. ""the pong.""

If you haven't tried sakana yet and aren't sure what to expect from neko, a good portion of their sushi rolls and nigiri utilize a lot of ponzu and citrus flavors.

(Some honorable mentions to try: sushi burrito, the pong, 911, and trout nigiri)

Other items like oysters and Shashimi are 1 order per person while nigiri is unlimited in the ayce option. Dessert is also 1 order per person while Ice cream is unlimited.

Alcohol is not yet present but will be coming soon.

The service is pretty good, I tried the ayce option on my first visit and then ordered the salmon entree at my second time coming. 

The owner can be a little chatty but is very nice and explained the sushi dishes as well as a little history along with it if you like learning a thing or two (I know I do)..and when my entree came out, he even added a few pieces of shrimp tempura and some paprika salmon nigiri to ""brighten up"" my entree because he felt it ""looked a little weak.""

I felt the quality was decent, nothing tasted or smelled off, and the nigiri was yummy!  

They have a fairly extensive appetizer list that was NOT fish/seafood related (similar to Jjanga) complete with bulgogi nachos which were THE BOMB (in case you have a person in your group that ain't tryin to eat dead, raw fish)!  

If I'm honest, I would say I didn't notice a *huge* difference between this place and Jjanga, with the exception of some specialty rolls (one of them has peanut butter in it...I was not a fan but it was not disgusting..just super..eh..peanut buttery(?), so therefore it provided what it advertised..haha)

Another great thing is they have a 2-for-1 drink special (beer, saki)!  

I would certainly go again, especially if I'm not feeling like gorging myself since the price point makes it easier to not feel ""obligated"" to ""get my moneys worth"".",01HQG1i5zBwmi0nRD4o1Ng,1,1,4,ZgDI_0NJ7vNGV9KbkNpwbA

If you told me that I could get amazing fish to rice ratio at an All You Can Eat Sushi spot, without the long wait, you can count your pretty nigiri I'll be there! They're conveniently situated in the prime of China Town, on Spring Mountain - right next door to Yosi Vapor Boutique and under Hue Thai & Cafe Teaze. Unfortunately, the signage blends in and is somewhat hidden in the corner of the Asian strip mall, so easily missed if you're not looking for it. The restaurant is decorated beautifully with plenty of comfortable seating, plus there's ample parking; I won't be surprised if it picks up real soon! 

Neko is the sister restaurant of the tried and true, wildly successful Sakana on Maryland! I'll be the first to admit, we're biased. We absolutely love Sakana and try to eat there every meal we can, but they are a lot further from home plus it can get pretty busy during prime dining hours. Neko is offering the same delicious AYCE sushi, nigiri & appetizer menu and since not many people figured it out yet, they aren't busy! The fish to rice ratio here is great, better than any of their competitors; we've been to them all! 

These are what AYCE dreams are made of: (I love that you can also get half sized rolls so that you can try more!) 
- Salmon Belly Nigiri 
- Ocean Trout Nigiri
- Albacore 300 Nigiri 
- Yuzu Yellowtail Nigiri
- Uni Nigiri
- Ama Ebi Nigiri 
- Unagi Nigiri
- Super White Tuna Nigiri 
- Garlic Tuna Nigiri 
- Albacore Garlic Ponzu Nigiri
- House made Tamago! Omg sooo perfect! 
- Baked Green Mussels 
- Poke Nachos
- Pang
- Jalapeño Poppers
- D's Guy Roll
- Lemon Salmon Roll
- ""The best of the best"" (rice-less)
- ""Stuffed Tomato"" (rice-less) - it's not really a tomato, it's actually surimi crab rolled inside salmon and topped with avocado, tropical salsa and ponzu! Super tasty!
- Their house sauces: 300 & garlic ponzu are spectacular. I love them! Pairs great with all of their nigiri
- Mini honey toast & Mochi for dessert - the perfect ending! 

I can go on forever, there's so much more! Even the pickiest eater can find something they'll enjoy! The have cooked items that are great as well, but I come for the raw fish and appetizers. Service always exceeds expectations and the food comes out quick. Chef Dragon really cares about his customer's and his food is made with love - you are in good hands! Also, Carlos our server is on top of his game - Don't even trip, he's got you!

All you can eat for 20 during lunch and 25 for dinner. Standard price. We got sat immediately so that was nice. It's a bigger sushi place in the plaza directly across from monta ramen. It's pretty spacious. I'm used to bumping into every table to get to the bathroom! The parking lot has a lot of open space so it's easy to find parking. Neko means cat in Japanese, so it's obvious that the menu and designs have cats all over the restaurant. 

They do serve beer here. $6 for two sapporos? That's pretty awesome! We got about 12 different rolls between the 4 of us. It's safe to say that I found my new favorite sushi spot. There was not one roll that was ""just okay."" Every single one was so delicious! I'm used to only a few being this flavorful but this place seems to have it all.

I might not need to try anywhere else because Sushi Neko is a keeper.",LA8nn9AJnP9ED-DEXzPqrA,0,0,5,KXboNUVJypiCX7sMS7IM7Q

I always go here but a few days ago, I took my family to go eat here for my Mom's birthday and I have to say, everything was on point that night.

Back story, we were trying to find a Hibachi place to eat at and drove all over town in search of one but there was either a long wait or something just didn't strike us to commit to one so I decided let's go to a place we trust. Sure enough, we ended up at Sushi Neko lol
As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted and I guess I've been here so many times, the server recognized me and said, "" Hey, how are you?!"" That was awesome. And got seated immediately. Not to mention, this place was already pretty busy to begin with.
We ordered a ton of food for AYCE between the 3 of us: 4 orders of Salmon Nigiri and 3 orders of Eel Nigiri along with 3 Miso Soups, 2 orders of Shrimp Tempura and 2 orders of ""The Shit"" (highly recommend) just to start off. We added a few rolls and more Nigiri along the way but not once did we wait more than 3 minutes for our food. Like I said, they were ON POINT  If you like Nigiri, this place is NUMBER ONE. Huge fish portions and tastes so fresh, especially their Salmon mmmm. It just melts in your mouth.

Customer service was so attentive and friendly. Our server always checked up on us during a comfortable amount of time, refills frequently, and empty plates were taken. 
They also did a nice surprise celebration for my Mom with a very delicious and decorative dessert that contained Deep Fried Ice Cream and a couple halves of Mochi Ice Cream with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle. 
If I could give this place 6 stars for that night, I would. We all walked out of there completely satisfied.",8YHqs7Bhmo_BvsKtH0uEFA,1,0,5,xLMSigvp8bbGjEJMEovERw

Their dinner is AYCE for $25.95pp and there are a lot of options to choose from. We wanted to try everything! We followed the rules they have on their menu and ordered little by little and were full after these dishes:

3 Miso soups - 5/5 so tasty and perfect with the sushi

The Shit appetizer - 5/5 very unique dish, it was bursting with flavor and had a nice crunch... I did ask the waiter what it was but I totally forgot!  

Pork Belly - 5/5 cooked perfectly w/ a nice meat to fat ratio

Call 911 Roll - 5/5 not too spicy but definitely had a kick, all the flavors worked very well together 

No. 1 Chef Makes Roll - 5/5 just plain amazing, was recommended to us by our waiter

Bam Bam Roll - 4/5 they used a good amount of fish and it tasted so fresh, it was lovely but this roll didn't have a huge burst of flavor like the others

Burning Your Ass Roll - 2/5 this had a kind of sour taste that I wasn't too fond of

Affogato - 5/5 was to die for!! Korean coffee, vanilla ice cream, crunchy flakes... what could go wrong?!

Tempura Ice Cream - 4/5 the tempura was nice and crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, I liked it but the tempura got a little too soggy on the inside.

Our waiter was very attentive, we never had to wait around to make another order. Our food came out very quickly. We were always equipped with everything we needed.

From the Appetizers to the Sushi(Nigiri), every single item we ordered tasted like heaven on Earth. The fish to rice ratio was A+. Twice the fish with half the rice. Presentation was flawless, A+. Different plates for different orders of sushi adds an elegant flare.

This makes me believe that the reviews are highly inflated because they are doing a promotion where if you leave them a good yelp review, they give you a mug cup or upgrade the all you can eat to premium all you can eat. 

We came here as a party of 4 and we all got all you can eat and ordered a bunch of food. I must say that the nigiri are decent and has a good fish to rice proportion like they advertise. That's the only good thing I can say about this place.. 

There's so many bad things about this place that I don't know where to start. The biggest thing about this place is that the food takes indefinite amount of time to come. It literally takes anywhere from 10-20min for each item to come. We asked the server repeatedly where our food is and he had to retake our same order. This happened 4 times. The wait was so long that we brought card games from my car so that we could play while waiting for the food. 

Next is the service. When we had to repeat our order multiple times, we got zero apology. No sorry no nothing. He told us that he'll put us in a ""priority list"" to get our food quick to us but then the food had only come out at ""regular""speed (we had time to go through a few rounds of Uno while waiting). The salmon belly was the first thing we ordered and it was the last thing we received 3 hours later and asking for it 5 times. And yes we stayed 3 hours and didn't even leave full because of how long the wait was for each item. We couldn't wait anymore and promptly decided to end our meal. However, they were quick to serve our desserts and give us our checks. 

I must say the food here is very overrated. Yes the nigiri has a good fish to rice proportion but after waiting for too long, the taste diminishes significantly.  The rolls are on par with other sushi joints. The appetizer however is pretty bad. The kalbi steak was chewy and cold. The salmon and yellowtail kama were both overcooked and dry. The kfc appetizer had some kind of weird bbq sauce that didn't work with the chicken. The pork belly was pretty good and probably the best thing at this restaurant. The oysters wasn't cleaned properly and I almost threw up eating them. 

Overall this establishment needs a major work in its customer service : ensuring that all orders come out, no orders that are lost are falsely claimed to be on their way,  and to apologize for any inconveniences.",bmmgelxV1eBpWmT32F3xhA,4,0,1,8vLoyZG-3CxDmgB5Iyl6JQ

I'm not sure when this change occurred, but the cuts of fish are very strange and the rolls are Korean style rolls (large and skinny pieces).  Also, the service changed a bit.  Only the one guy that clears the table is awesome.

So here's what I experienced on February 3rd:

Nigiri is fine but their sarada lobster, which I LOVE is somewhat different and the pieces are small.  Also, the nori was torn and a few pieces arrived not even completely finished.  

Rolls are what I know to be Korean style, where they roll is large, as in 2"" or more in diameter, and cut them thin.  I really do not like the size because it's more difficult to eat.  The rice itself is weird now, too.  No flavor.

Service was okay. They did check up on us but we had 3 people taking care of us, so the orders were a bit mixed up.

I saw mixed reviews on this place. I decided to try it out myself. One review that really got me interested was the one that said this place is better than Goyemon. And I do like Goyemon. So, let's give it a try. 

My take on that review: BULL! The food here is no where near Goyemon's quality. 

You know those fast food items never looked as good as their pictures? Well, this place reminded me of that. I don't know if the owners or friends of this place posted a bunch pics or maybe some previous visitors got lucky. My food did not look like any of them. For example, the Agedashi Tofu looked and tasted like it was soaked in sauce since yesterday. The shrimps on the skewers looked like earthworm. It was pathetic. There were sands in my Miso Soup. I kid you not. The seaweeds looked like they've already gone bad. I wanted to order the specials on the board, but the waiter said they're for dinner only. But they didn't write that on the board. 

Bottom line, I'm disappointed and will not eat there again. I could have given this place a 2-star, but seeing all those 4/5 star reviews, I felt the need to correct the curve. 

I usually don't write reviews. And even when I do, it's never this long. But this time I really felt the urge to share my experience. Thanks for reading.",BwkF9_GjzmH_nyqbb1NA_Q,1,0,1,omRWVqu5dejXXMjG8QK4Bg

The food that i ordered as appetizers was just to get me started because in my experience the sushi takes a while when it's AYCE. The Shit,the KFC, the creamy shrimp, edamame,seaweed salad were all very good. I would come here just to try those! The inside of the restaurant was very cute. The cherry blossom trees and the k pop music videos playing in the background was really cute. I would say that the Canned soda was a little different, I'm use to re fills but it was no biggie. The sushi came out and i was impressed of the fish to rice ratio. The smoked paprika salmon wasn't worth getting. The baked mussels were very moist and tender! I loved them! I finished it off with the affogatto which is a 10! I will definitley be returning to eat here!",qEjm0_ivRn8WlfJipeFAgg,1,0,4,sNI8XefTFnZSno0SEXSKrA

3114606,2017-01-03,1,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"This place became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Vegas! They opened up last year in 2015. Ever since a friend recommended this place, I haven't stopped coming back here! The quality, cleanliness, and presentation of this establishment speaks for itself.

Their All You Can Eat menu has a really good selection. You're able to do half order on almost all the rolls and their fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is awesome! (See photo) Like all AYCE restaurants, they charge for any leftovers, including rice. This can make you full faster, but it helps when the rice portions are much smaller.

If you do decide to do AYCE, one dessert per person is included. I highly recommend getting the tempura ice-cream. It's not overly sweet and the portion is just right. Their mochi ice-cream and honey toast are pretty good as well.

If you feel like you want the sushi to just keep on coming and you're not in a big party, the restaurant does have a bar. But no matter where you sit, the service is always great and the staff will keep coming back to see if you would like to order anything else.

Don't hesitate to try this place out! If you love sushi just as much as I do, you won't be disappointed. ;]

-There is a time limit for AYCE
-They DO NOT accept American Express",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,7,2,5,tPL_8hhSv0Eg6yb0vrBdag

3241964,2016-09-19,21,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"This is the second Japanese restaurant we've discovered has AYCE.  And we meant to eat at Tokyo Station but they're temporarily closed.  Luckily this plaza is full of delish looking grub joints.  Even though all the flashy bright happy restaurant signs seem to compete with each other, we decided on this one Sushi Neko tucked in the corner.

But walk inside and it's a plethora of mixed art and objects!  Which one catches your eye?  I like the girl dressed in traditional with her hair up, looking like she just beat you in a breakdance competition.  But the art in this restaurant made me wanna take my time eating to gaze at everything.

So I've been upstairs to a18 karaoke bar.  Their menu design is exactly the same as Sushi Neko's but different menu items.  Sushi Neko's cool menu items - some even funny... Who's Your Daddy sushi roll... Did NOT try that one; nor the I Love My Ass, Wet Dream, or Playboy rolls. OMGarsh only in Vegas - almost hilarious.  My other brain thinks ummm this is food guys keep it decent.

Sushi Neko has gained themselves some new fans though!  Not just cuz of AYCE but especially for the allowance of half orders.  Yep... advantage!!!  Try more selections.  I've never known ANY place to do this.  Got our attention!  I prefer nigiri, since they're simple and easier to eat.  But their rolls look fun and appetizing!  We enjoyed the popcorn lobster roll and chanel roll.  

Our servers were super pleasant.  Filled our waters, and checked on our orders, cleared off empty dishes.  The wait from ordering to table delivery was pretty quick.  Then again we had a late dinner on Sunday evening and it wasn't crazy busy.  

For desserts, Ness tried the green tea panna cotta and mini honey toast.  I tasted the panna cotta but for whatever reason my taste buds were not picking up the flavor of green tea.  I may have been sushi'd out.  It was very light so my suggestion is to have dessert first!  ;)  And the mini honey toast is a sweet roll with honey, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  That can be made at home; but here it can be ordered with AYCE.

Overall a nice dining experience at Sushi Neko. Ate really well yesterday.  Healthy protein choice of fish.  And we shall return :)",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,29,31,5,8o0TSj2mPB-hxiTv9tFGHg

The sashimi that they have has very large cuts of fish.  I wasn't too big of a fan of the spicy garlic edamame, they had a bit too much sauce on it however everything else was great!

The bathrooms were well kept, the servers seemed to all be working together as a team, and my water glass was never left empty!  The ambiance is neat as well.

The only negative was that at the end we asked to split the check three ways and the girl said they couldn't do that.  I explained to her how to do it and of course they were able to.

The restaurant is a fine all you can eat sushi place, however most of it's problems lie in it's wait times. I've been to this location three times, all of which spanning around two to three hours since the sushi just never comes out. While the servers and chefs were all kind and attentive, most of the problem stems from the lack of them. The restaurant is quite large for an AYCE setting, yet in a full house there's really only two servers who double up as hostesses. Three chefs are located in front of a bar. With 30 - 40 guests on busy nights, expect a wait time of around 20 minutes per dish, if it is even the right one. The dishes have a tendency on going to the wrong table. I've been here on three different occasions with different waiters, yet I still have these problems regardless.

The sushi itself depends on the time and day. I highly suggest avoiding any time when the location is busy as quality heavily deteriorates. While the fish to rice ratio is the saving grace of the restaurant, if you really cared about the rice, just head to an AYCE Sashimi restaurant instead. The large portions are sloppily cut at times, leaving unwanted portions of the fish being served. While the menu has a lot to offer, many of them lack taste. (The Ebi is pretty much paper).

Don't go here yet, the place can get a lot better, but for now just stick with Jjanga or Goyemon.",w4ytv-D3eqJ4jesbQA2o9g,6,4,2,HlpwvN34A1j3dbKArMym2g

I've been to Sushi Neko for AYCE since they've opened in Vegas, & always have mouth watered over their super white tuna nigiri, salmon, oysters, towering sashimi, & affogato. 

Their fish to rice ratio is great!!  The Ayce value is also great because of the variety of sides/appetizers/sushi. Compared to other Vegas AYCE spots, Sushi Neko has unique sides other than your typical edamame or shrimp tempura found anywhere else.

NOT RECOMMENDED: their uni (sour & not fresh), pork belly, tobiko (over wasabi'd)

At my most recent visit, there was a 45 minute wait. They do take reservations apparently. So recommended if you have a larger party than 5.

The sushi to rice ratio is on point here! The fish is super fresh and they have lots of flavors for your taste buds!

They are right next to the parking garage, so I recommend parking near or on the first floor of the garage. I've never had an issue with parking but it could just be the times I come.

I highly recommend getting dinner pricing because they have so many goodies on there that you can't get with lunch pricing.

Atmsosphere is date night worthy and great value for the money. 

You can do half rolls on most of their rolls! Which is awesome for trying new things out. Of course the nigiri is my favorite and really puts this place above the rest!",AlrKpOQYhDM_kh9QncOsjQ,0,0,5,AZ6tbNUA3e7pEbB04FH_8g

3511092,2017-12-26,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"On the last day of Xmas my infant daughter gave to me...

2 hours of naptime so a couple of weary parents could gorge ourselves on surprisingly good sushi (after surviving a week of extended family) :P Fed my daughter, got her to nap on the drive over, put the cover on the stroller and rolled her next to our table. While she dozed, we went to town on Sushi Neko's hilariously named sushi rolls.  

Interior: Plenty of space. Clean seating area, brightly lit. Trendy, artsy decor, with music videos on full blast. I haven't heard that much K-pop since I taught high school. 

Food: 
Most of it was really good, and much of it had the most ridiculous names (""Burning your ass roll"", ""Wet Dream,"" you get the picture). 

Standouts:
Baked Lobster Roll -- my favorite, topped with small lobster pieces grilled. We had to have this one twice. 
Something Wrong Roll -- the waitress's recommendation and it really was very good, especially since a lot of the other items were heavier and mayo based (this one uses a light citrus sauce). This one was fried shrimp and spicy soft shell crab on the inside, with tuna and salmon and whitefish alternating on the outside and a tangy ponzu sauce. 
Double Dragon Roll -- fried shrimp and spicy tuna on the inside, eel, shrimp, avocado and eel sauce on the outside. This one was really good but a little spicy for me -- husband loved it
Skewers -- Bacon and Scallop...  be still my heart, lol
No Name Roll -- Eel and fried shrimp wrapped in soy paper, outside salmon, spicy mayo, eel sauce and crunchies. This one was really good. 
Be Sexy Tonight -- shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese -- topped with salmon, unagi and crunchies and spicy mayo and eel. This one was heavy but still really good. 
Monkey Brain -- Fried tempura banana with crab salad topping...  this one was ok, it was a little too sweet for me. 
Only thing I was meh about was dessert -- while I had the ice cream mochi (you get 1), the ""tiramisu"" which really was anything but. It was more like a coffee flavored layered sponge cake with a dollop of whipped cream on the side. 

Notes: 
The pricing can be a la carte or using the all-you-can-eat rules ($30ish for adult, not sure if this is every evening but we came on Xmas day dinnertime).
Part of rules -- they will charge if you leave food, or at least service does slow down.
We came early, around 5PM. Service was ultra fast and they were taking our next orders by the last few bites of the previous order. Efficient and food comes out quick. Things started to slow down closer to 6. 
Some items on the menu are limited if you do AYCE -- no-rice rolls are limited to just 1 per person, along with most dessert items. 
You're able to get half rolls if the original order is a full roll (i.e. if it already says the order is 4-5 pieces, then you can't halve the order), which is great for sampling more items without getting as full.

The sashimi roll, wrapped in cucumber, was a good mix of flavors with generous cuts of tuna, salmon, white fish, and crab. Both the Hawaiian roll and red dragon rolls were good as well with ample fresh ingredients and minimal rice.

Nigiri is good too. The cuts of fish are large and the rice is well seasoned. Their menu has plenty of small bites available like pork belly -- two thing slices of fatty and meaty pork. I loved the subtle sweetness of the sauce.

Desserts were decent. They have mini versions of honey toast using Hawaiian roles toasted, covered in honey and topped with vanilla ice cream. With the tempura ice cream, I thought the dough was too thick and slightly undercooked.

The service was great and the interior is beautiful, modern and kitschy with anime and super hero items found throughout. The most impressive element is the large wooden tree towards the back of the dining room.

For about $26, you can eat all the sushi you can fit into your stomach for dinner! The fish to rice ratio is really good and pretty much every fish I had was good (none of that super fishy taste except for things like mackerel which I don't know how people could eat that). I recommend trying the gyoza, lemon salmon, orange blossom, Chanel, and lobster roll. The waitress recommended trying ""The Shit"" which is one of the 2 highly recommended items, but I personally did not like it. I'm not sure what taste they were going for, but I can only remember a fried outer shell with mushy imitation crab (?) on the inside. The dipping sauce did make it taste a bit better, but I'm still not convinced as to why it is highly recommended. They also have a bunch of one time order only items like salmon belly, so needless to say, order those for sure! The skewers were really good to. I got the sausage one and the bacon and scallop (highly recommended and a nice break from just eating sushi).

Note: Dessert is also included on the menu! You can pick one ice cream flavor in addition to one of their other items (i.e. mini honey brick toast, mochi, tempura ice cream, etc.)

Overall, if you are looking for a good sushi place, definitely check this place out. They also play lots of Korean music videos if that is what you're into as well xD. The cat design is pretty neat so cat lovers be sure to go here! I'd recommend going here on a Friday or Saturday night because it has such a lively atmosphere and it gives you something fun to do!

Man, I really appreciate their fish to rice ratio. They're by far the most generous portions I have ever had and I've tried quite a few sushi places around Vegas. The fish is really fresh and their menu is organized well. I recommend the salmon and shrimp lemon rolls. The lemon gives your mouth a refreshing feel and flavor. Definitely try ""the shit""...no idea what's in it but it's tasty! They have this lobster roll that is to die for. Essentially, any roll with tempura (the middle row on the back of the menu) is a winner. lol. You MUST try their salmon belly. It's easily one of my favorite things to order.

Knowing that this was the sister restaurant of Sakana, my expectations weren't high. This was decided by someone in our party. The atmosphere was pretty cool and all, but our overall experience was kinda sketchy.

seems like they've fooled ALOT of people with their sushi to rice ratio, but you seriously need more rice when it comes to nigiri, otherwise, JUST SERVE SASHIMI!!! Another fail is saucing anything and everything here. That's very common in Korean run AYCE sushi joints, at least in my experiences. Nigiri was a terrible mess, already not having enough rice on top of awkwardly long slices of fish...not a fan of this style at all. Some of their side dishes were pretty good though.

Cheat sheets were given to us WITH OUR TABLE NUMBERS to make ordering easier for us as well as the waitstaff, but did it help? NOPE...Plates were being delivered at the wrong tables
and you would constantly hear ""Oh, we didn't order that"" throughout the evening. Take advantage of their 2 for 1 alcohol offer, you're gonna need it if you end up having a similar experience like we did.  ALOHA!!!

3617600,2016-02-28,6,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"It irritates me how much of a 180 Sushi Neko had on my second visit. 

My first visit was an acceptable experience, the food was unique enough to set itself apart from the saturation of AYCE sushi places we have in Las Vegas plus there was no wait time. There is an array of hot items and menu variety to satisfy my parents who are not by any means hardcore sushi connoisseurs. Almost all nigiri had some type of sauce or dressing as did most of the their other dishes, not my preferred choice, but acceptable. The service was really lacking, as the servers were a bit quiet, but efficient enough. 

This second visit, holey moley, am I even in the same restaurant? Sushi Neko hit 3 strikes really quick and made it a point that I may get food poisoning. Fish is delicate and requires more than a sharp knife to handle, we all know that and we also know that fish isn't supposed to be chewy. With the uncertain origins of super white tuna of whether its authentic or even just escolar, its scary to take a bite and the fish is chewy. It scares me that it had the same consistency of squid or octopus. Consistently having scales on multiple different fishes, or orders that are so drenched in sauce that both the rice and fish fall apart. Second, a lot of things ordered, did not show up, or were confused ie seaweed salad and seafood salad. If you don't have something, let the customer know, rather than have them just sit and wait for it. Third, the service was pretty bad, its not hard to satisfy me, tell me what you're bringing, and refill water. The restaurant wasn't pack or serving any big parties so I can't imagine its hard for 2 servers and 1 busser to let me know what you're serving me.

I know Sushi Neko is part of the same group that owns Sakana, with 99% of the same menu, so how can an apple fall from the tree so far?

The sushi is fresh and the rice/fish proportions are good, but oh my is it bland.  Also, the menu is horrid for the colorblind or those who don't have 20/20 vision.  Neon writing on neon background is not easy on the eyes--but that has nothing to do with the two stars.  

Note: I do not use soy sauce or wasabi on rolls--usually the taste will stand up on its own:

Garlic tuna was on par.  Son of a Beach and Coco Shrimp were excellent.  
The Be Sexy tonight was OK, so was Be Happy.
Burn your ass was so bland even I could eat it, and jalapenos send me into tears.
Chanel was like eating a rainbow roll which was like eating a california roll which was less than thrilling.
And the Full Moon roll was just downright cardboard.

Their menu offers a great variety of choices from appetizers, from specialty rolls, to desserts and the alcohol. They have highlighted items in red on their menu for ""must try's"" and my personal favorite is the appetizer called ""The Shit"". 

The Shit - a (2 pcs) order of spicy siracha imitation crab meat wrapped around seaweed and fried in tempura batter. 

Pang - a (2 pcs) order of salmon and imitation crab covered in cream cheese and sweet soy glaze on top of briochette bread. 

KFC - Korean fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce 

Pa Duk - Korean honey mustard fired chicken

Birthday Mini Cake - dessert specialty for birthday person only

3877215,2018-01-18,4,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"The nice thing about Sushi Neko is that the ratio of fish to rice is large enough to the point where you can wrap the piece of fish completely around the small ball of rice. The actual fish quality is average. While other places like Goyemon will give you unlimited salmon belly, the orders are limited per person here. I did like the other one order per person nigiri pieces of ocean trout, uni, and ama ebi, which comes as pretty standard at many of the AYCE sushi places. 

Many of the appetizers were hot messes such as the shrimp tempura (very soggy), calamari tempura (rubbery and chewy), and the agedashi tofu, which was lackluster. There is a portion of the menu that is strictly dedicated to no rice sashimi, which includes the seafood salad, towering sashimi, and sashimi roll. I highly discourage ordering these as the seafood salad is just a hodgepodge of the shittiest cuts of fish that were discarded and thrown together haphazardly. 

My last gripe was on the dessert, which they were mostly out of due to a late delivery. I did enjoy the affogato with Korean style coffee and cornflakes, but all in all, I've had better AYCE sushi and ice cream options.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,8,8,3,bxUYWqRTxe1G-qHsu0lP1Q

It's a little harder to get a booth here because they're reserved for bigger parties, well that's what the server said. I like to eat in booths at AYCE places because they're so much more comfier to slouch down in when you're full of nigiri. 

The presentation in the beginning was phenomenal for the nigiri. They were so cute the way they set it up, but the more orders of nigiri you put in, the less pretty it gets. They give you a big chunk of fish, but I did notice it got a little smaller near the end. I highly recommend the super white tuna, cajun tuna, and if you can, get the salmon belly!

They definitely have a wide array of options. Try one of the hand rolls!

And yours too if you prioritize:
-Fresh fish on nigiri
-4:1 fish to rice ratio on nigiri
-Salmon belly availability 
-flaky and light tempura consistency
-wide variety of appetizers and sushi options

If you're looking for a place that serves the best ROLLS specifically, I would try Jjanga or Yama Sushi. They put too much rice on the rolls at Sushi Neko so it ends up not being that great. But at other places, the rolls all have different flavors and they're smaller (sometimes you can get half rolls!!!) so you can try a lot of different ones.

But I'm definitely a nigiri person, so I love it here. All of the nigiri I tried was great! With the exception of the scallop... I love raw hotate (scallop) but the one here comes out cooked and with this weird Cajun powder on it. Bummer.

Standouts? Salmon belly, salmon, escolar, yuzu yellowtail nigiri. Baked lobster roll.

Biggest surprise? Bulgogi Nachos. Pleasantly delicious.

Oh btw, they have deep fried eel.

It also said the sushi to rice ratio was ON POINT! So we decided to check it out. Plus, its off the street so it isn't as busy or overpriced. 

Three words that describe the experience: Decadent. Fresh. Proportionate. 

Ambiance: The decor of the restaurant is really cool. There's a lot of Anime and random Japanese decor that really makes the experience great. There's cat stuff everywhere because Neko means cat in Japanese. The location is easy to get to. It's in the SF Market plaza on Spring Mountain next to Yosi Vape Shop. 

Service: The people do not speak english very well here, which is a good and a bad thing. It's good because you know the food is authentic. It's bad because you can't communicate very well with these people. If you try to ask them a question beyond what's on the menu or ordering they will either ignore you or smile and walk away. But, the food is so good I didn't care too much. The Chef even presented a special to us which was his own creation. The rolls and nigiri came out in a timely manner. We did not wait very long for any of our dishes, which is a plus. 

Price: Average AYCE price that's standard in the Las Vegas area. For Lunch its 23.95 and for dinner its 25.95.  

Food: The quality of the food was excellent. If I could give this place a rating purely based on the food, I would give it five stars. Everything was fresh. The rice to fish ratio was spot on. We left feeling comfortable instead of overly full from rice. There wasn't a fishy taste to any of it. The salmon belly and yellowtail belly was a game changer. I recommend getting the eel, super white tuna, trout, and paprika smoked salmon nigiri. It's the best I've ever had in Las Vegas! There's specials on the wall as well that you can order. It's random every time so take a look at that as well.  

Drinks: There's alcohol there, but we didn't have any. From the prices it looks reasonable and it's normal brands like Sapporo, Asahi, and Kirin Ichiban. There's sake as well.

ATMOSPHERE
I loved the interior design here. Seems like interior was inspired by Spirited Away. Spirited Away playing on TV plus this amazing Spirited Away artwork on the wall. This is a huge plus for me because Spirited Away is one of my all time favorite movie. 

SERVICE
Super friendly and attentive service. No complaints here.

FOOD
Sakana set the bar really high for me. Knowing that Neko is the sister store of Sakana, I compared everything with Sakana standard. 

Thick cut of sashimi, check.
Fresh/high quality fish, check.
Good rice to fish ratio, check. 

....so far so good. Then my server dropped a bomb: ""oh we are out of salmon belly""

what? I live and breathe for salmon belly I almost had an heart attack but no worries. This was something that never happened at Sakana so it was a bit of shock to me. 

I do have to mention that green tea pannacotta is made differently here. It was not as creamy as I remembered it to be from Sakana. Texture was chalky and the color was similar to unripe avocado. I was really disappointed. 

Something interesting they do here is that you write a review and you either get their special mug or their premium menu (usually ~$28) for just $25.95.

4039919,2018-04-26,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Sushi Neko is a sister restaurant to Sakana. There's a lot to love, but I still prefer the original location.

Neko is located off of Decatur and Spring Mountain and is fairly new. The majority of the restaurant is super cute and fun, although the bathrooms leave a lot to be desired. Nothing terrible just kind of an eye sore. 

The staff is noticeably young IMO but they are very efficient. I never feel like I have to track them down and they usually don't miss any items I've ordered.

Neko is all about the nigiri in my opinion. They serve large slices of protein for their nigiri. I feel like none of their rolls really stand out. I come here when I'm craving some appetizers and some nigiri.

If you ever catch them at dinner time try their tako wasabi! It is so good! It's octopus marinated in wasabi. A couple of my favorites are ocean trout and the amori scallop nigiri as well.

I can't say much more about Neko. It's a very solid AYCE in Vegas's crowded market. My one huge complaint is that it's always warm in here when I go. It's just not the best feeling when you have to rush to eat your raw fish. 

Definitely check this place out and with any other AYCE spot just try things until you find what you like.

Since Hwaro is my go-to KBBQ, I figured I could give Sushi Neko a shot since they are owned by the same management company! Sushi Neko is located in the Chinatown Plaza that is directly across the KFT/Curry Zen Plaza. It's a bit hidden so park in the back, and you'll see the sushi house as you drive by.

We walked in just to see that it is completely empty. We were a tad bit hesitant since it was weird to find a restaurant empty for lunch but we gave it a chance anyway. Overall, their menu is very similar to Sakana's but once the rolls came out, we learned that they make it differently. So if you enjoy the types of rolls at Sakana, you can try this place for a different twist of your favorites. 

Their fish to rice ratio is pretty good! They have a wide range of options for rolls and appetizers. The only thing about Sushi Neko was that they overload their rolls with sauce. If you enjoy that, then this is the place for you. But personally, I prefer to have light sauce because I like to taste the fish! 

Overall, it was OKAY. As most AYCE sushi places in Vegas are typically crowded with long wait lines, I would suggest coming by for a quick sushi fix.

I decided to try this place after reading the glowing reviews from Elites.  From beginning to end, I had a terrible experience here.  This will go down as one of the worst service experiences I've had in recent memory.  We ordered drinks a few minutes after being seated.  10 minutes later, they were still not at our table.  Once we were ready to order, we tried to order food on 3 different occasions.  Each time, about 1/3 of what we ordered would show up.  After being out of food for a while, the server would stop by and ask if we wanted anything else, then look really confused when we asked about the additional items we ordered but did not receive.  It did look like there was one server to 20 tables, so I am hoping that is the explanation.  But it was Friday night.  Surely, it occurred to the manager that one server may not be sufficient.  

I could have overlooked the terrible service had the food been good.  The food was average to below.

Neko Sushi+: Neko is unique and popular for their rice to fish ratio of about 2:1 in terms of size with their Nigiri.  The Nigiri is good quality which makes this such a win.  
Nigiri Champ: Salmon Belly, there's a reason why this order is limited per person.  They have a great variety of rolls which I limit here because I don't want to get too full for the awesome Nigiri.  
My current sushi roll champ: #27 Golden Tiger = Inside: Shrimp tempura, avocado, Cream Cheese + Top: Spicy Crab with spicy mayo, yum yum & eel sauce + 3 kinds of tempura crumbs to give this roll even more gaainz.  The mini honey toast is the perfect size for me because it allows me to order another dessert to fatty up even more.

Neko ambiance:  Since my last visit 1 year+ ago, there has definitely been an upgrade!  Above is Industrial lighting, you're surrounded by Japanese pop murals, dark wood, brick walls and the plywood 'tree' makes for a fun and attractive dining area.  

Service, attractive dining area and the Nigiri makes me love this Sushi Neko!  If you don't like your fish to rice ratio of 2:1 on your Nigiri, this is not a sushi house for you or you can just stick to their awesome rolls.

4107177,2016-02-12,7,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"It's been ages since I've tried a new all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. Even though it's the younger sister of Sakana, I'm sure this counts.

I've gone without my favorite type of indulgence for a few months, so I eagerly made my way to Sushi Neko. It's at the inner corner of the first floor of the small two-story mall on Spring Mountain that's also home to SF Supermarket, Bazic, and Swish. The parking lot is rather cramped, but I lucked out by finding a spot before having to resort to the garage.

Although I arrived shortly before 4pm, I requested the dinner AYCE anyway at the price of $25.95 (lunch is $20.95). The table seating in what I'm told is the former location of Shuseki is fairly spacious, but as as a solo diner (for perhaps the first time in my Vegas AYCE sushi dining career), I opted for a bar seat for easy ordering.

Appetizer orders actually go through the server, which is a common practice as far as I've seen. I usually order my fair share of apps, and this time didn't differ:

- Pork belly: two huge pieces of meaty (not so much fatty) pork in a sweet sauce. It's among the better AYCE sushi orders, but I'd recommend sharing.

- Baked mussels: with four mussels, it's another app that should be shared. I couldn't resist though, and they were definitely nice. The creamy sauce isn't overpowering.

- Salmon kama (instead of the unavailable hamachi kama): a relatively modest portion, at last. Tender and moist throughout, but a little underseasoned. I'm glad that soy sauce was within reach.

- Pang: some sort of mixture of salmon, surimi, and cheese baked top of tiny garlic bread crostini. I've not seen an appetizer with bread before on an AYCE sushi menu, so it was a nice change of pace.

- Dynamite: with mushroom and I believe shellfish under the creamy sauce, and red onion strings, this is a lighter-than-average version of this appetizer that I loved. It's served on a large shell that you can just pick up by hand (after it cools down anyway).

The real heart of the meal was the nigiri, of course. It began when I requested the blackboard specials of the sushi chef and he presented a nice plate of goodies. The salmon belly was garnished with fresh wasabi and as delicious as any salmon belly nigiri that I've had. The aji (horse mackerel), kanpachi (garnished with shoyu nori), and striped bass (with a cajun-like garnish) were as good as any that I've had in an AYCE setting.

The sushi chef followed that up with a small plate of his own choosing, after inquiring as to whether I'd had mackerel (of course yes). The mackerel was definitely among the better mackerel nigiri that I've tried, although it doesn't match the salty lusciousness of a now-defunct AYCE sashimi menu that I once enjoyed. The smoked paprika salmon was an interesting variant that didn't quite satisfy as much as the salmon belly. The yuzu yellowtail belly was a very nice closer that wasn't too citrus-y.

I proceeded afterward with several nigiri orders of my own volition. The ocean trout (one-per-person) was fantastic, but troubles ensued afterward. The oyster (also 1pp, and one piece at that) was actually not nigiri, and it was decent. The ama ebi (1pp, 1 pc.) wasn't nigiri either, and while the deep-fried head was fine, the body and tail were a little too mushy. The uni was a letdown, with one piece reeking somewhat of dirty seawater and the other one just boring.

And then the biggest issue was the seemingly not-fresh salmon. It lacked flavor and was a little mushy. This was compounded by the oversized fish-to-rice presentation, which is counterproductive if you're actually struggling to swallow the fish. I'm sure it's a fluke, but I wasn't happy.

The super white (with screaming orgasm sauce) wasn't that impressive either. The scallop was fine though (and not of the deplorable bay scallop variety), and the unagi was a high note to end the meal.

Also ordered and eaten around the conclusion was my only foray into the ""rolls"" side of their menu. It was actually a riceless Towering Sashimi that could very well be called mini-tostadas, and the combination of unusually thin crunchy wonton squares, various raw fish, red onion, and sweet and spicy sauces dazzled my palate even though the fullness factor was dulling my taste buds.

Finally, dessert time. I was saddened to see that I only was able to pick one dessert (aside from ice cream scoops), a deplorable policy which Yelpers report that Sakana has also now implemented. I settled on the coffee blanc mange, which had reasonable coffee flavor and a decent smooth texture aside from an unusual top skin that should not be there. Thankfully, the plum ice cream lived up to my memories of the fragrant, smooth dessert of Sakana.

I've heard of other similar places on Spring Mountain, but Sushi Neko is really laying claim to the niche. Their peaks were memorable, but it's not going to be a frequent revisit for me due to various flaws and issues. But do try it once if you're a Sakana or AYCE fan.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,7,4,UeMloDlvI-jMT1smfJ3nTA

To start this off, this review is a few weeks late so I can't give a better description on the food.. so bear with me. Haha. But some of their fish just didn't sit well. I think their tuna in one of their salads tasted really funky and the texture of it was nothing I was used to.. and i eat a lot of sushi, so with that, I was sketched out and barely wanted to eat anything else. The quality of their food was disappointing for the amount of 5 star reviews they off.

The only good thing was their nigiri. They had a lot of fish for the amount of rice they had.. and they had cute decor.. and that's about it. The customer service was eh, but that's expected from an Asian restaurant.

4142878,2016-01-11,3,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"There are so many sushi AYCE places out here in Vegas.  As a result, I just chose one of the new places - Sushi Neko.  One of the cool things about this place is that they don't limit the number of rounds that you can order, which obviously is awesome because you can better gauge how much more you can handle/want to eat.  I don't know if there was a time limit or not, but it was nice that the food came out pretty quickly.  One of my biggest sushi AYCE peeves is that subsequent rounds take forever to come out, but I was glad that this was not the case here.  Well, I guess that the restaurant had maybe 3-4 other tables occupied, so that could be a reason why food came out super fast.  But, overall, the service was very good.  The waiters were very friendly, took dirty plates away quickly, and also got all of my orders correctly.  The menu is very, very big so it was definitely difficult to pick which things to eat.  There was everything from nigiri to BBQ skewers to mini udon bowls.  Big mistake on my part was I went to eat by myself, therefore, I didn't get to try as many things as I would have wanted.  Be sure to bring friends when you go so that you can try everything!

On to the food - the nigiri was overall very good.  Salmon belly and unagi are my favorites and they absolutely did not disappoint.  The fish to rice ratio was amazing, which is the one thing about a sushi restaurant that can either make or break my experience.  Unfortunately, the yellowtail was a little icy (frozen fish, perhaps).  I was not a fan of that one and would not get it again for that reason.  The appetizers were average - I had miso soup, salad, and calamri.  The miso was a little on the salty side.  Salad was nothing special, but was refreshing.  The calamari was served with a generic sweet chili sauce, which was mediocre.  Unfortunately, what was most disappointing for me was the actual rolls.  They were drenched in sauces and mayonnaise; it was so excessive that it ruined the experience of eating the fish.  If I were to come back, I'd either stick to just nigiri or pick rolls that didn't come with some sort of sauce.

A big perk is that there are a handful of desserts that you can choose from at the end of your meal.  I got the mango mochi and the tempura ice cream, which both were very delicious!

An AYCE meal here costs $21 at lunch and $26 at dinner, which is pretty typical for any AYCE sushi place.  I'm not sure if Vegas has better AYCE sushi places out here, but this place is pretty good and I'd definitely come back and get a ton of nigiri.",kFYEp9HvN-yTStS7YD_bVQ,2,2,4,QabF5qtErlxYLjNXOvZrvw

I originally thought it was Japanese-owned, until I arrived, I soon realized it was Korean-owned. Now I know it's the same owners of Hwaro.  Though I had my prejudices, this meal turned out way beyond my expectations. Well, not really, cuz I saw the photos of the huge pieces of fish to rice ratio. hehehhehehhe. 

Salmon and yellowtail were fresh. Nice large fish pieces in comparison to rice ratio. Unagi was really good, way better than Goyemon IMHO. Other appetizer items like ""The shit,"" ""KFC chicken,"" baked mussels, and the rice-less sushi rolls were all delicious. My conclusion is that this place hands down has legit appetizers, and their nigiri's are legit as well for an AYCE. IT's a definite bang for your buck. 

The only two things that I'd say were a bummer are:  
1) No refills on soda. You buy and pay by the can. 
2) No fried shrimp heads (amaebi) available on menu. I also don't think they had any rolls using spam, but I might be wrong. 

There was no wait on a weekday around 6:00p.m. and hardly any customers. Hence, service was quick and efficient. If it gets crowded, service might be compromised. 

A definite must-try in town, and I hope they continue to keep their standard and quality as is for a long time. PLEASE don't start skimping on the size of the fish pieces after a year so that I can keep coming back! :)

My friend and I decided to try this place out on Christmas night and I dont know if this place is just the best in vegas, but I can go to much better places w better service and quality and taste somewhere else. 

The sushi quality was alright. There was also many diversities which I think is a plus, but the amount of rice balls in each sushi differed for each sushi and the shape and thickness of fish for sushi was never consistent. 

Service, it wasnt as bad to be offensive, but I think they could do better. They seemed like they were hating their job and wasnt wanting to be there. Also, the way they take order, I felt that they could find much better way to take the order because it was so confusing for both servers and customers. Also, they never stated what order I was getting when they were serving food, so I think they could do better job on that. 

Taste wise, I thought was alright, but there are other ayce sushi places that could do better. I liked the small portionof appetizer they served w, bc I was able to try different things out.

Whatever nigiri you order, you will always get small amount of rice and a long, thick piece of fish. It's cold and fresh. You'll never get their type of portion elsewhere. I've tried different sushi places (some out of state) and none are like Neko! One thing I dislike is how limited their desserts are. You can only choose ONE out of the choices :( It used to not be like that, but they recently changed it. Hoping it will change back! 

The service here is mediocre. It really depends who you get, but the majority of them are very kind and patient. There was only one horrible server, but I think she got fired. Most of the days I come, they aren't busy at all so the food comes out fairly quick.

If you're reading this, just stop and get over here... like right now!

Neko had been on my mind for awhile and after seeing how consistent reviews were on an annual basis, it was time to stop all their teasing with me.

As my friends and I entered Neko's lair, we were greeted by this upbeat vibe known as Kpop music. At that moment, we knew we were in the right place. 
Thankfully, I made dinner arrangements in advance, because the place was crawling with feasting humans. 
Our host was so eager to seat us and take our order, but we had other plans in mind... like drinks for example.
A couple shots of Sprite did the trick, thus leading us to the next step, our dinner selection. 
They provide you with a piece of paper listing all their entrees and sides available which is very convenient for the consumers and chefs backstage. 
Some selections were haste, some were pondered on, but somehow we got through it without a sweat.
We began to don our AYCE game faces, and before we knew it, the trays started to flow... fast!
Garlic Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Super White, you name the Nigiri, we (most likely) tried it. 
Vegas Roll, Snow White Roll, Lobster Roll, we ourselves!... were on a roll.
Shrimp Tempura, Calamari, Stuffed Tomatoes, Pork Belly, also known as... perfection.
Though, there was one lone surviving plate left on the table... twas named Cajun Tuna. 
No one seemed to enjoy Cajun Tuna due to its rubbery cartilage texture.
After coming to an understanding with our server, all we could do was watch as they took Cajun away...
Fortunately, we were still able to top off with some Mochi Ice Cream.

We were a party of 12. The place is not really made for more than party of 6. So our table had to split. But we were still right next to each other. Which is not bad. We came at the wrong time. It was kinda busy and it seems like they are short of staff. We did had to wait several minutes before we finally got our rolls. But it's probably because they are short staff and their were other tables as well. I did order the pang (which is supposedly the highly requested one) but I never got it. I told them several times. But just never got it. Which is okay because we are already stuffed. But I did wanted to try it. 

Even though we had to wait for our food for several minutes. I love the employees. Specially our server. I'm not sure if his name is sunny. But that's what it says in the receipt.

I had high expectations due to some reviews & word of mouth but it wasn't what I expected for the price of ACE. Once we got seated we had a waitress who was nice & tried her best, but when she came to ask for our drinks a few asked for water & assumed thats what everyone wanted & walked away. It probably took me 15-20 min just to be able to ask for a sprite. As she came to my section of the table to get the rest of our orders she walked away again & forgot to ask what the 2 others seated in front of us wanted. Order a few appetizers - got them right away- & order 3 signature rolls. I received 1 roll which was the ""burning my Ass roll"" (was really good & would come back just for that), but didn't receive my 2 other rolls for about 30 minutes (basically had to reorder) once I got it I didn't like it at all & I was full already so I had to force myself to eat it. 

**My biggest problem though was with a certain waiter. He didn't know any of the names of the rolls so we had to attempt to figure out which rolls were what & who ordered them. I felt disrespected & felt a lack of common curtesy from him. We would all be eating & he'd be looking over our shoulders searching for empty dishes. I get it your trying to clear out our table but he wouldn't say anything & reach his arm right in between our faces mid eating & his armpit is literally 2 inches from my face. The funny thing was he wouldn't ask if we were done with empty dishes in the middle of our table but when we decided to put them at the end of the table to avoid armpit in our face he asked if we were finished with them???***

The price for lunch was $20,95 and I think dinner was $25.95? The price compare to NYC price is the same.

It was boring but flavor wise it was fine. We didn't really order much rolls since I was in love with the nigiri but it was still pretty good. For the eel cucumber roll they gave us the eel sauce to dip in ourselves instead of pouring onto the roll which was new. The plum ice cream was nothing special, didn't really taste like plum but still good and different. Service was also amazing.

4684871,2018-03-09,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Found my new FAVORITE sushi place! I was looking for a new sushi place to try and came across this place here on yelp. And oh my, i'm so glad I came here. I came here about 3:45pm-ish.. Wasn't busy at all. We were seated right away. Lunch AYCE is up until 4pm so we scored lunch ayce price for $20.95. Dinner is $25.95. 

The rice to fish ratio in the nigiri and the rolls are perfect. Not too much rice to fish as many other sushi places are. 

NIGIRI: My favorite nigiri was the garlic tuna and the cajun tuna. Seriously hands down the best garlic tuna i've probably had in any vegas ayce sushi place. It's a must try!

ROLLS: For the rolls, they do half rolls as well. So you can try a lot of different rolls. I tried the wet dream, snow in vegas, bam bam roll, burning your ass roll, lobster king roll--and probably a few more I can't think of at the moment. All of them were delicious. 

APPETIZERS: Most of them were great as well. Except the corn cheese. That one was bleh...it's in a small tin cup, most of it was cheese. I also had the creamy shrimp (shrimp tempura with cream cheese), shrimp tempura, spicy garlic edamame, dynamite, pork belly (was super tender and delicious), saba misoyaki mackeral, miso soup. All of them were great! We all enjoyed them. 

DESSERT: Affogato and Mochi ice cream. The affogato was not bad. Basically coffee poured over vanilla ice cream. I mixed it up and tasted similar to a coffee shake. 

Service was good, and the interior decoration is super cute as well. Overall I'd say I found my new favorite to-go sushi place in town! It's a must try!",3LNCN_aMHo97xvEFR4PhDw,1,0,5,ACFFi00jT2i7cKAkXZUXqw

Every time I have family/friends who visit, I either bring them here or recommend this restaurant to them to try it out. Reason being: of course it's AYCE sushi including appetizers, dessert, etc. The nigiri is the best part about the sushi because they cut large, fresh slices of fish with little rice (which I definitely prefer). I absolutely love their cut of salmon, yellowtail, white tuna and mackerel. If you can handle a huge amount of sushi in different varieties then this is the place to be! Their service is also very attentive as well and I always leave his place with a happy tummy :)",GQKroeIMvVG21BJTWwKUtg,0,1,5,27Mx4axTrcO-86V6O7Ck4g

Service: 3/5
Subpar as it looked like it was understaffed for the sushi section of ordering. We did have regular water refills though which prevents this for being a 2.


Appetizers: 
We always get the bacon and scallops no matter where we go if it's an option. Good as usual 

The shit - honestly overrated (sadly using this word right now). My friend Anna and I didn't really understand the hype.

What you should try is the pang which was overwhelming in flavor and deliciousness. No pics since we inhaled them.



Rolls/ things we recommend: 

The Chanel roll - a perfect blend of fresh sashimi on top to compliment the fried tempura shrimp

Paprika salmon - their version of smoke salmon sashimi and wow that was a game changer - never thought paprika could elicit such feelings of happiness. I'd almost say it trumps the salmon belly.

Salmon belly - do recommend but honestly the paprika salmon won actually.

Honestly anything with salmon here was phenomenal! We had the stuffed tomato riceless roll which was almost all salmon and that tasted delicious! Trust me it's nothing with tomatoes!

Any of the rice less rolls ( they change from day to day depending on fish availability and chef) we got the stuffed tomato? 

Popcorn lobster was meh - too much yum yum sauce and we had the same problem with the coconut shrimp roll. You could not taste anything but yum yum or whatever that sauce was. They were both drowned in it.

Lobster special was the same sauce like the pang except with seafood which was awesome

Don't recommend the coco shrimp as there was hardly any coconut and it was drowning in yum yum sauce.

I was very satisfied with the meal and it didn't leave me too full as many other places would have.

I was ordering dessert and normally the ice cream is unlimited and you get to choose one dessert from below (I have a picture as proof). Hallie was saying that if I got the ice cream I wouldn't be able to select an additional dessert.  The menu clearly states otherwise.

I went in and we all ordered all you can eat. We each ordered water, the water was not only dirty but two glasses were evidently not washed. When the sushi came the sushi was majority fish with minimal rice, making it hard to use chopsticks because the rolls would just fall apart because the nori couldn't seal closed. The deserts were so-so, my honey toast was amazing but my Italian boyfriend who has grown up eating tiramisu said that it was very dry and seemed as if it had been left out for a day or two, my friend had the green tea ice cream which came complete with a piece of blueish plastic in the ice cream.  Our bill was $68. I paid $45 in cash, leaving my friend with a $23 bill which was to be charged to her card. When we received our receipts she had been charged $42 and I was told that I had only put $26 in cash with the check. Originally the busser picked up our check, I do not know if he had stolen the $20 bill before he gave it to the waitress or what happened but somehow my $20 bill disappeared into thin air and my friend was over charged by $20. The host was also rude when seating us, making a comment about us being impatient when I had told my friend that I was so hungry, I was not only not speaking to the host but my comment was meant to portray my excitement about trying this new sushi restaurant to my friend and boyfriend. My boyfriend has also worked as a busser, food runner, server, bartender, and restaurant manager for 6 years, he was very upset with the experience as a whole. The treatment we recieved from the staff was far from acceptable, the food was sub-par, much of if tasting somewhat fishy and not very fresh, the rolls were falling apart, and we waited over ten minutes to receive our water after only two of us were asked what we would have liked. My boyfriend would have preferred a sprite but was never given the opportunity to order and tried twice to get the waitresses attention for long enough to ask but she did not seem concerned with anything other than getting to her next table.

We ordered salmon, tuna, garlic tuna, yellowtail, albacore and red snapper nigiri. The Albacore was so good!!! Everything else was good too, but the albacore stayed on my taste buds for a hot minute.

We then ordered a few rolls and good thing we decided on half rolls, because those portions were HUGE! We ordered the No. 1 Chef Makes, Hawaiian, Be Sexy Tonight and Be Happy. Out of these 4, I would definitely DEFINITELY recommend the Be Sexy Tonight! It was sooooo good!

Downside is their dessert isn't that great; but I came for sushi not dessert. I got the green tea ice cream and it was hard as a rock and didn't taste like green tea. It had a weird taste to it....

We were seated right away , our waitress went over the menu and suggested a few things. The wife and I did all you can eat ( very affordable $25 a person ). I started with a few of the suggestions and some nigiri.

The nigiri,  each pice was perfect,  great size , great taste and quick( literally about 3 min and my full plate of nigiri was at the table) . All the types of fish I ordered were delicious. The tuna quality was top notch amazing texture and taste. 

THE ROLLS, incredible the wife ordered them and I have no idea what the names were but they were all amazing , they offered 1/2 orders so we could try different combinations, and they were all pretty amazing.

I would also try their appetizers like: pork belly, bacon and scallop skewer, or KFC (Korean fried chicken)! It's not for everyone, but they're worth a try since their included for the AYCE. 

When it comes to dessert, I always order their affogato (coffee with ice cream)! The coffee and ice cream just work so well together. It's a perfect way to end the meal!

A hostess whose name tag read ""Panda"" seated us. 

Immediately, the two small soy sauce dipping plates were very dirty. As soon as our waitress came by (a young girl with long red hair), to take our order, we asked for clean ones. She apologetically took them and came back with new ones, and we placed our order (California Roll, Yellowtail nigiri, Lobster Baked Roll, and Salmon Lover Roll). I also ordered two waters.

We got our Cali Roll right away. No waters. Gradually, we got the rest of our order. Good timing. One of them was spicy, so we had to order our waters from a male busser. He said, ""Oh, you didn't get your waters?"" We said no and he came back with two waters. 

We already had about six rolls left of our order at this point. As I was sipping my water, I noticed black marks on the cup and tried to scratch them out from the outside. They didn't come off. I took my straw and scratched the inside of it. Sure enough, the stains were inside the cup. 

That was definitely strike three, so I immediately approached the hostess and asked for a manager. She told me there wasn't one available, so I asked for a supervisor, or anyone in charge. She attempted to dissolve the situation, but at this point, I was adamant about letting ""upper"" management know. 

A chef by the name of Sai (?) came out to speak to me and I let him know of everything I was not happy with. He definitely hesitated, but I wasn't looking for anything but to be validated. I just told him it was not okay and he agreed. I also let him know that I did not mind paying for what I had already ate (keeping in mind that the dirty cups came WAY after the order was placed). He finally offered to cover half the bill and I was okay with that. I thanked him. As I was walking out, the entire staff said sorry and I just thanked them.

I hope they get to this because we know how hard it is to work for tips or how much products cost. So if it's of any importance to them, they will try to improve it for their other customers because I will not be going back.

Sushi Neko never fails to impress me with their service and quality of food. The 3 of us came in for AYCE on a busy Friday night around 6PM and waited 15 minutes to be seated.

Once we were seated we looked at the menu while our server got us our drinks. First round, we ordered a variety of appetizers like shrimp tempura, gyoza, calamari, miso, etc. which were all good and arrived at our table in a timely matter. 

We also ordered nigiri such as tuna, garlic tuna, tako (octopus), scallop, squid, salmon, and yellowtail. I am so impressed by the quality of fish and portion size our nigiri was given to us. The tuna was a fresh red and melted in our mouths as were the other fishes. The fish to rice ratio is 3:1 and is one of the reasons why Sushi Neko earns the top spot on my go to AYCE sushi. 

The service was excellent. Servers were very attentive and always checked on us once in a while if we were okay and if we wanted to order more. Food runners were quick and also attentive, consistently checking on us, picking up our empty plates, and refilling our waters. Everyone was very polite as well. 

Throughout the rest of the evening we reordered apps and nigiri and a few rolls. The Dragon, Tiger, Shrimp Tempura, and Spicy Crab Rolls were yummy. They were nicely presented and not overdone with crumbs or sauce.

Lastly, we topped off our meal with dessert. Multiple orders of Green Tea and Red Bean ice cream. The Green Tea Panna Cotta was delicious and the honey toast was good and not too sweet. 

I am always throughly satisfied with every experience I have here. I highly recommend trying this place, you won't be disappointed.",ggsCD15VUuJ9jl7qbE33Fg,4,4,5,7IIMaXY0mQz8uETHm4wLQg

Sakana guests, if you don't wanna make the drive to sakana, this is owned by the same person and has the same menu. 
They serve the same fish to rice ratio and has the same quality of fish. 
We came for lunch, but I'm sure dinner is good too. 
Knowing that it's owned by the same person makes this place good as is. 
They serve a little slow, but that's not too bad.

Nice art work on the walls, modern K-Pop music, and wait staff is professional and attentive.  Staff easily handled a group of eleven without a problem.

Plenty of Nigiri choices with a high fish to rice ratio.  All the fish that we had was fresh at lunch on a Sunday.  One order of Sea Trout per AYCE diner...you need to remember to order this one.  Unagi was nicely baked and a large piece.  

Large volume of cooked dishes:  Shrimp Tempura, Udon Noodles, Bacon Wrapped Scallops, ..who doesn't like bacon!?!

The fish was super fresh tasting. Also they give you more fish than rice which is unlike most AYCE spots out here. I highly recommend the Cajun tuna nigiri! Also they let you order half rolls. 

The servers were very sweet and attentive but I think what impressed me the most about this place (minus the food) was the decor! There are cool looking trees throughout the restaurant with cool vintage looking lanterns. Also there's a ton of cat themed pictures especially in the bathrooms. So cute! I also notice their music is kinda j-poppy. I guess I like that this place is more quirky and modern than many sushi spots that all look the same.

APPETIZERS
Fried rice - nothing special. 
Shrimp tempura - yummy! Hard to mess up. 
Pang - crab mix on top a crunchy, buttery toast.
Egg rolls - Super oily. Did not care for the filling.

SUSHI
Nigiri is pretty good here with great fish to rice ratio. It is true that the garlic ponzu sauce is awesome. They have sushi burritos listed on the menu. I ordered the hulk burrito (soy paper) and I got a regular cut roll with seaweed paper. Umm...lol. I'm not big on rolls, but they offer 1/2 rolls! I tried the lemon roll and the Chanel roll. I've had a better lemon roll, but I would get the Chanel roll again. 

DESSERT 
Sounds good on paper, but it was just okay for me. The desserts are on the small side and nothing really stood out. The green tea panna cotta is probably the best choice, but not mind blowing. The mini honey toast is definitely ""mini."" It's basically the size of a Hawaiian roll. Sad that the toast was burnt and the vanilla ice cream was more icy than creamy. 

I loved the interior and the service was great!

1. I like sitting at the bar. The bar here is dark and you are looking straight ahead at the kitchen with hobart equipment staring you in the face, so the atmosphere is severely lacking.

2. The tray that you mix your soy sauce and wasabi isn't too deep a dish so it creates a problem.

3. There were no specials, like zero. I was told to come back on the weekend where there is more of a crowd and they have specials written on the board.

4. I love tobiko nigiri. The tobiko was very thin on top, like a thin layer of tobiko icing, half the amounts I'm used to elsewhere (maybe the pics don't show it, but it was thin).

5. There was a 6 inch black hair on my salmon nigiri and it ended up in my mouth...completely grossed me out...it was one of those hairs that was hard to grab from my tongue...and when I took it out I could immediately see who's hair it belonged to from the kitchen who must have done prep that day. I didn't want to be one of those yelpers that would take a picture and put it on the internet and remove business from potential customers who would see that on yelp and run for the hills. Shit happens. I guess I was in a good mood.

6. I ordered the honey toast and it didn't come for 15 minutes...and when it finally did come it was made with a completely stale toasted piece of bread, the bread just crumbled it was so old...and I had this dessert a dozen times at Sakana so I know how it's supposed to be...just totally capped off a disappointing experience. 

SO WHAT WENT RIGHT?

1. I like the Sakana/Neko menu. The rolls are excellent and the nigiri is always fresh and has a nice fish/rice ratio (minus the tobiko situation). +1 for the all the no rice options...I run down the no rice list offered at dinner time and get them all.

2. Salmon belly with fresh wasabi is a winner.

3. Although the mishap over the 15 minute wait on the stale honey toast was a miss, the service with drinks never emptied and friendliness of the wait staff was on point.

The dinner special items were ok to me, so if you are debating if you should go for dinner for extra bucks, I'd say lunch items are good enough!

I know people are commenting about the fish:rice ratio for their nigiri, but I'm a huge sashimi lover so I didn't mind the amount of fish at all!  I also love the fact that they have so many different kind of nigiri, with ponzu, jalapeño, pepper etc, when you put it in your mouth, it's full of flavours! Miss the taste so much right now.

Last but not least, you can't beat the price! 26+tax/person for ayce sushi sounds much better than the 80+tax/person buffet on strip for me. (since I'm more of a fish than red meat person)

There were only 3 tables occupied when we walked in but since this place has only been opened for roughly a month, I decided to try it out anyway. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. After being a sushi-lover for years, I usually rank a restaurant's fish freshness by ordering salmon nigiri's; the texture of the salmon sushi was rough, it tasted like it was refrigerated for a while, and the color was just off. The rest of the sushi nigiri were okay but they all tasted like they have been refrigerated for a while. 

However, I do have to give them props for their cooked appetizers --- they tasted really delicious. Service was okay --- had to get the waitress' attention to refill our cups every single time but she was polite; probably just inexperienced in waiting tables. 

Overall, I don't think I will be returning to this place. There are a lot more sushi places in town that offers fresh sushi. Even though their cooked appetizers are a lot tastier than the place I frequent, it is not strong enough of a reason to return just for that purpose.",95xLmZcOEUl1VWp_ERmTFA,1,0,2,y425M__TQlKcNNG0yA1Gzw

Everything about this place was amazing. Service, food, ambience.....EVERYTHING! I don't have one bad thing to say about this place. It was PERFECT!

We tried a good amount of the menu. Got half rolls of all rolls we tried to ensure we had room for more. 

Appetizers:  you MUST have the seafood salad and the PANG! OMG  The seafood salad and is a one-time order but honestly it was a big portion. There was 4 of us who decided to share it and we couldn't even finish it. The pang is a baked yummy goodness of seafood on top of a crispy toasted toast. It was so good we ordered a second round! I also got the pork belly, the tofu, ""the shit"", baked mussels and I know more but honestly can't remember. Just try them all....you won't be disappointed, I promise!

Other locations give you an equal portion of fish ratio to the rice ratio but this place... man they give you the fish with a dollop of rice. Our party was super excited when we figures this out. One tip though... it seems like there may be only one sushi chef who seems to work on the nigiri portion so I think we over loaded the poor guy.

Another thing we highly recommend was the pang appetizer. It was like a sushi version of a biscotti. Also the hand rolls had tons of raw fish and little rice which we enjoy but others may not.

Came here with zee boyfriend one night to give this place a try since there were many good reviews and what not. Plus, it's a new restaurant! We love to try out new places to see if they're any good or worth going to! 

Sushi Neko is a sister restaurant to Sakana, therefore, same owners. I personally have never dined at Sakana so I can't compare nor do I know what to expect when coming to Neko. According to one of my friends though, from his experience at Neko, the service was severely lacking and the server that helped him was the worst. 

We came here on a Thursday night and it was practically empty. There was only maybe one table occupied. AYCE sushi dinner is $25.95 while the premium is at $28.95. Premium dinner includes the specials on the blackboard that is in the middle of the room and from what one of the servers told it, it was only available for the weekends. (Or maybe not .. I wasn't really listening.)

We tried their:
Salmon Carpaccio: Chef special. Meh. Doused in sauce with tasteless ikura. Pass. 
Tuna Carpaccio: Chef special. Also meh. Not even sure what I was eating. Pass.
Salmon: Tasteless pretty much. Second round was better.
Salmon Belly: Had some fresh wasabi on top. Delicious. (One order per.)
Anything Albacore: No thank you. 
Hamachi: Decent.
Yuzu Hamachi: Decent. If it was tasteless, I wouldn't know cause the sauce covers that.
Super White Tuna: Decent.
Uni: Decent. (One order per.)
300 Handroll: Three types of raw fish with a sweet-spicy sauce and rice. The sweet-spicy sauce was pretty much sriracha sauce mixed with some sugary syrup. No good. 
Oysters: On half shell with some sauces on top that includes a salsa so it does have a little kick to it. The oysters weren't great but the sauces were good. (One order per.)
The Shit*: Crab meat and other stuff wrapped in seaweed and deep fried. Comes with a spicy mayo sauce. Decent. 
The Pang: Garlic toast topped with fish and sauce and other stuff. Delicious. 
Green Tea Panna Cotta: Needs less matcha powder in its recipe. 
Blanc Coffee Manger: Same type of dessert as the green tea panna cotta. Same texture, different flavor. This one was actually decent. 

Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy a good portion of the things I tried at Neko. The only things that I enjoyed were ""The Pang"" but it was heavy so I can't eat too much of it and the salmon belly. However, the salmon belly was restricted to one order per person and salmon belly is my favorite nigiri ... soo definitely a minus for Neko. There was a roll that I wanted to try but I only wanted to do half a roll and Neko wasn't able to accommodate on that either. Another negative. Fresh wasabi was an extra charge of $3.00 when we asked for it...A lot of other places give it for free :(  The first server that helped us was brand new apparently. She couldn't answer 95% of our questions and also lost half of our orders so that definitely did not sit well with me. She constantly asked another server to answer our questions ... 

Eventually, that other server just started taking over. He was wonderful. He was good with giving suggestions and answering everything that we wanted to know. He gave us enough time with our meal, offered to get us more dishes if we were to want them. He pretty much offered to bring us every dessert they had if we wanted it. He was an absolute pleasure to deal with. His name is Carlos. Request him if you can. He is definitely Neko's saving grace. If he were not present that night to serve us, this review would have ended up a 2 star review -- possibly 1 star.

Another plus to Neko is their fish to rice ratio. You get a huge chunk of fish and a little bit of rice so for the fish go-ers, it is heaven. However, on the flip side, if your fish quality doesn't resonate that well then fish to rice ratio isn't even something I would put into consideration. 

End point. I probably wouldn't want to go again as it doesn't particularly hold up to the hype. It is a little disappointing after reading all those great reviews. But, no time limit. Eat as much as you want for as long as you want, I suppose. They also have an offer going on?

       - Decor - From the manga on the wall, to the tree made of wood planks, to the panting of the tatted geisha this place has a modern Japanese / Anime vibe
       - Sakana - This place has the same owners as Sakana. You can see it in their menu items and their unique and fresh sushi.
       - AYCE Premium - With most of the premium items being sashimi, this is a nice way to get more variety and give that omakase feel at an AYCE place.
       - Fresh - Freshest you'll get in the desert.
       - Rice - Just like Sakana, this place has a very good fish to rice ratio that won't leave you full of carbs.
**Options**
       - $20.95 Lunch
       - $25.95 Dinner
       - $28.95 Premium Dinner (Dinner + What's on the black board)
**Highlights** (Rest of the things ordered are in my pictures)
       - Dynamite - The presentation on the sea shell is a nice twist to a AYCE favorite.
       - Power Up - Deep fried eel. Doesn't look as great, but is delicious!
       - Pink Scallop - Some of the freshest and clean tasting scallops I've had.
       - Premium Sashimi - The fresh wasabi on the Kampachi and the Okoda Nori on the Super White stepped up this sushi game to Iron Chef level.
       - Salmon Tar Tar - Salmon sashimi with masago & some kind of cream sauce. Yes please!
       - Monkey Brain - Spicy crab mix on top of a deep fried banana. The wife's favorite.
       - Mini Honey Toast - Who can say no to this at the end of a meal?
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a great sushi place that has both unique rolls and fresh nigiri.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,3,5,fMRh67Yw6V9a0aFsB08x0A

The only reason we didn't walk out was because Sushi Kaya had a 2 hour wait and we were starving. Icing on the cake they overcharged me when everything was ate. Did I mention they added items to the check that no one ordered they took about 5 items off reluctantly. I paid my tab even if my fried rolls tasted as if they were sitting out for awhile when our 2nd server swore up and down the 5 times I asked about them that they take longer (shouldn't  be 90 min longer) honestly I wish I would have waited the 2 hours for sushi Kaya .

I usually never recommend anything all you can eat, because that just means that the quality will be mediocre, since the quantity is higher. Restaurants try to maximum their profit by feeding their customers with cheaper ingredients. However, at Neko's, the quality doesn't change and the menu doesn't get limited. (They do limit the time frame, when you start eating. 3 hours max)

They have a huge selection on their menu, so it is worth paying the $25.95 for the all you can eat. Their sashimi are fresh and flavorful. Their rolls are plentiful and carter to every sushi lover (raw, cooked, Americanize, traditional, etc.)

5386274,2017-11-06,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Best AYCE Sushi in town! First time here this evening and everything was on point. Let me get to the details...

Nice and little restaurant with cute decor and upbeat music. Clean place, and I believe it just got done being renovated few months ago. Great place for groups as their seating tables are booth/bench style. I do not really recommend strollers as they kinda get in the way as its a bit narrow between tables. High chair would be very useful here.

If you love Nigiri, this is the place for them! Great slices of fish atop a small round of rice. Portion of rice to fish ratio is perfect here. They do not cheat like other sushi joints. The best Nigiri my group enjoyed were...

Smoked paprika salmon
Cajun tuna
Super white tuna
Salmon belly (Dinner AYCE only and by far best!)
Seared lemon salmon

Appetizers were great too.. will mention my faves...

Highly recommended Pang. Its a bruschetta toast topped with scallops, crab, cheese, eel sauce, and mayo. 
They have a shrimp tempura filled with cream cheese and oooh that was a hit! 

When ordering sushi, don't forget that you can ask them 1/2 order so you'll have room to try other sushi. Must order sushi..

Towering sashimi (riceless)
Superman (eel lovers)
Orange blossom
Butterfly  (peanut butter and coconut, don't let this fool you it was good)
Popcorn lobster (4pcs)
Lobster special (4pcs)
Double dragon roll
Vegas (5pcs)

Staff were awesome with service. Super great quality with the taste and plating of sushi. Been here twice within a week shows how good this place is. Definitely will make Sushi Neko my regular AYCE SUSHI restaurant!",5QjxYqp5nYKqfbSMjv1ztQ,1,0,5,IkcXy1kodCGqp5U1ocQsgQ

The sides are worth ordering as well; the shit, pa dak, shrimp tempura, crispy rice, stuffed tomato, etc. the atmosphere is very upbeat and loud, but in a good way. The tv stations play K-pop videos and the decor is very eclectic, complete with a wooden tree structure coming out of one wall. There's always ample parking in the garage adjacent to the restaurant.

I thought they had run my card but just forgot to give me a copy for me to leave gratuity. As we are leaving, the server asked us if we split our check, we said yes and the copies are on the table. We then continue walking to our car and the next thing that happened is the server ran out from the restaurant and stopped us, wanting us to pay because the girl at the register did not charge my card. Okay seriously, what the hell? You gonna chase people down the parking lot for your mistake for not charging my card? Unbelievable!

5517476,2017-12-06,2,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Third time will not be a charm. Here's the thing, fish to rice ratio is crazy!  Big cuts of fish with basically 12 grains of rice, seriously. Hubs and I were in awe. Your excitement might actually deflect from reality. I mean, I easily got excited myself until I started eating my nigiris. Chewy cuts, and not the greatest quality of fish. I mean, at AYCES...one shouldn't expect top grade fish, but all I'm saying is...please don't feed us the chewy ones. Just our dang luck I tell you.

Service was suppppper slow, however friendly. I did my usual order of salmon skin and spicy tuna because it's so basic it helps me gauge the place...and it was disgusting. Salmon skin tasted like it was cooked the day before. Matter of fact, seemed like there was barely any salmon skin. The rice on the rolls were too wet. Eek. I had a lousy experience with the same two selections at another sushi spot, and it reignited old feelings. My spicy tuna has the right spicy but just lacked in flavor. I ordered a few other things non sushi related and was just meh. 

Also, they failed to bring out 1 of my husband's order, forgot the name...but that was quite all right because by then...the husband had to spit out a few of his nigiris, yet, was full from his other orders anyway. 

Honestly, the best thing about my experiences were the edamame and mochi ice cream...nothing about their sushi and nigiri had me wanting to return a 3rd time. If friends wanted to come here to eat, of course I'd come...not that much of a party pooper and wasn't thaaaat disgusted. Just know there's other solid sushi spots for us to go to. 

Decor and layout is certainly cute! That was my favorite thing about the place. I wanted to love it considering the rice to fish ratio. It was a disappointment for me/us. My husband who is a sucker for sashimi/nigiris and pretty easy to please...was disappointed himself. So if the garbage disposal spits food back out...just saying.

The ayce is actually a pretty good price, that's probably where I can see why people rave about it. But I wonder how many times do I need to come back to warrant the same 4 or 5 stars? Hmmm....

People gave reviewed about how busy they are. Fortunately, the times we've come it wasn't and we didn't have a wait. For this, I'd  say they're kid friendly and you could manage to safely have a stroller in there IF they aren't busy. 

Still, it's worth a try. The price for AYCE, rice-to-fish ratio...it really is a good deal. Again, to each experience is their own. Maybe you'll have a better one.

5518157,2016-09-18,5,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"I am ready to give this place a mediocre 2 stars. Come here for the environment, but don't come here for amazing sushi. 

Some people claim to be very experienced when it comes to food. I may not be the best critic in the Yelp Industry, but when it comes to AYCE sushi, I've been to almost every establishment in the business that I think I have some sort of idea what I'm talking about. 

It's the rice. I absolutely hated the sticky rice. Sushi rice should never be hard; it should never feel like little tiny grains splitting apart so that you taste it crumbling in your mouth. It should be as the name says: sticky, chewy, a compliment deserving to the fish.  I thought that perhaps it might just be an off-day with the sushi chef, but I saw several other reviews having the exact same problem as me with their rice. I am also salmon-lover, but the salmon in this joint looked very... discolored. 

I tried Tobiko for the first time. I know it's my fault for ordering it, but that thing is disgusting. On the bright side, I also tried salmon belly for the first time and theirs is spot-on! In fact, try any of their special nigiri and you'll forget about the rice mishap. They're all very good. 

I was very disappointed with some of the side dishes on the menu. The chicken karage and KFC tasted exactly like the same dish, fried the same way. The salmon carpaccio was mediocre. In my opinion, the sauce overpowered the taste of the salmon. 

If you like cheese, I suggest trying the Pang. 

One that that I do love about this place, as I mentioned in the beginning of this review, is the interior decor! So creative, so artistic; it felt like I was in Japan or Korea for a moment.

5657541,2017-10-05,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Tucked into a little dark corner in Chinatown is one of the best places for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas... Seriously.

I try to stay away from AYCE places because many of them a) make their rolls too small in order to make more money off of the customer, b) have less than ideal quality sushi sometimes, or c) cost too much for the minimal amount of time you are given for AYCE (i.e. some places it is 30 or less minutes). 

HOWEVER, when I came to Sushi Neko with a colleague, I was pleasantly surprised! Their lunch portion of AYCE is almost $21.00 (which is AWESOME!), and dinner is about $25.00. For lunch you are given 60 minutes, and 80 minutes for dinner. If you order AYCE, the full menu is available to you (excluding 4-5 items which are for dinner customers only). I ate quite a bit of sushi in that time, and all of it was DELICIOUS!

My personal recommendations:
The Butter Fly! It has peanut butter, but I swear it is amazing!
The Popcorn Lobster
The Honey! Screaming O!
The Wet Dream

I think what i liked most about this place was that sushi was really fresh to me AND their nigiri's fish to rice ratio was on point! I think you guys know what im talking about.. Some sushi joints have way too much rice for a small piece of fish so you get fuller faster. But theirs was 70% fish to 30% rice and i was crying, so good! 

I loved their variety of appetizers and desserts. The menu even had suggestions of what to try so I listened to them and i was not disappointed. Their mussels omg!! Ive tried a lot of sushi places with some weak dessert game but i got a little honey toast here which i thought was pretty original.

$20.95 for lunch Open - 4pm
$25.95 for dinner 4pm - closing 

First thing when you walk in you will notice their amazing interior ! So modern and artistic !! Even their bathrooms look cute. Their extensive menus are colorful and organized into sections. Plenty to choose from. They have some very silly names for their dishes. I really like that you can ask for half orders on sushi rolls so you can try more selections. I went for all the sushi and nigiri. Also you DO NOT have to do ayce. 

The fish to rice portion is on point  ! Perfect! Most ayce try to pack as much rice as they could in your sushi/nigiri. But not this place !! Yall the MVP!! Also the fish is fresh too!! 

If you go for dinner try all their specials on the menu - usually one order per person only. There are also specials on the hanging chalkboard. They are all pretty good ! Gotta eat your money's worth. 

Free dessert included! Try their mini honey toast. Basically a hawaiian sweet roll drizzled with honey and topped with ice cream. 

The service was good. Always came to check up on us. Kept food coming constantly and took away empty plates. When you order make sure to double check the order with them at the end! Wouldn't want to be missing any yummy dish! 

Overall fresh fish & ayce that is well worth the price !! Left with a very happy and full stomach. Felt like I could barely walk out of the restaurant haha Definitely will be back each time I'm in Vegas !",k8wtOxV33zMWlE5u6srceg,1,0,5,c5aNr-pw_K1FoUz1K_s3bg

I love everything about this place. Once you walk in, the vibe... the atmosphere.. the service!!!!!! Are you freaken kidding me? Why isn't this place a full 5 star yet? Everything we ate was so good! We got the all you can eat dinner package and literally tried all the things you can only order once. They didn't have Uni though since they said it didn't smell too good so they wouldn't serve it. I love that! Some places will just serve it and you will have a fun time later when you get home lmao. Anyways! MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE WAS THE SUPER WHITE TUNA!!!!! I literally freaken cried when I first ate it. It literally topped it off to such a great meal. If you're on a low carb diet and high protein diet... haha you'll love this place!!! The rice serving is so tiny and the protein is so fresh and it's literally can wrap around the rice. I mean... WOW!!! For the price? Hell yeaaaaah I'll be here all the time now!!! Our servers were so nice and on it. They really came around to cater to you. Taking the plates off the table, refilling your drinks like ninjas and seriously always smiling because we are so happy! Guess what!!! Buy 1 get 1 on beers and some soju!! That's right!!!! I said it hahaha BOGO!!!! You literally have to try this place in order to understand my excitement.

My friends mostly complained that the fish (literally everything I guess) tasted super cold. And it's not suppose to be served that cold. 

Other than that, and the somewhat slow service in terms of some foods coming out, I enjoyed myself. It's probably cus I'm not going to be eating 50% fish and 50% rice. I had more fish than rice so that always makes me happy. I would definitely come back. 

You can request fresh wasabi. The wasabi they provided us were very minimal so you'll probably have to request for more like my friend had to. 

They do charge for hot tea, FYI. Try their trout nigiri. I believe that was one order per person. No limit on mochi ice cream :0D.

I have ordered masago with quail egg, the types of salmon and tuna they offer. The first round was alright, but when we ordered the second and third round of fish it became discolored and tasted a little sour which ended up giving me a stomach ache. I just dont understand how the consistency disappeared after the first round?! I honestly use to call this one of my favorite AYCE sushi places and sadly I will never return again.

5748441,2016-01-30,0,ghVhlFpNhfBwWDFGSlt2JA,"Sushi Neko has a rather generous 4.5 star review on Yelp at the moment but after trying it out, I didn't felt like I received service worth even 4 stars. 

I went with a small group of friends out to all you can eat sushi dinner here after seeing its advertisement in the plaza with Kung Fu Tea and Raku so we decided to give it a try. I'll admit the best thing about Sushi Neko is the indeed the liberal ratio of fish to rice. Reminds me of Sake 2 Me Sushi in Tustin, CA, and it did taste rather fresh. Some nigiri such as the paprika salmon were good, and a lot of dishes looked like they tried to make the food presentation for the rolls somewhat unique and not completely standard cookie cutter fare I always see at sushi restaurants.

The first 6 or so dishes we ordered came out impressively fast. However, for some reason after that our dishes suddenly stopped coming. We told our waiter (even different waiters, to be honest) countless times we still had more than half of our order that hadn't came in yet and all they said was that they'd check again or something along the lines, but nothing improved. I think we even saw a couple that came in later than us, had all their plates arrive and they left way before we did. At one point, we gave up and tried to reorder all the missing items again, only to not have any of them out after more than 30 to 40 minutes of waiting. I've had sushi places misplace an order when we had a huge table but this... was kind of ridiculous even for a small party. When a place offers all you can eat sushi, they kind of need to be prepared to dish out their fish in a timely manner not just for certain tables, but for everyone, or they're going to get hungry AND angry patrons. And that's a bad combination. 

Giving this place 2 stars because I do think it has potential (and because I've honestly had worse before at other places). But service can be terrible and is not consistently good. Hire more sushi chefs or figure out a more efficient system to make food so customers like us aren't sitting ducks waiting for all our items for almost 3 hours.",OGur1LXmbFO4WcudRnHGjg,1,0,2,Tr4vW9BeATD64Wb4SK_3wQ

They said it was take about 30 mins to seat our party of 6, and after almost an hour later they tell us 20 more mins. They left out our last orders, guess they forgot or they really don't give a shit about their customers. My boyfriend's brother ended up getting sick after eating here.

Second time was the worst and our absolute last time. Our server literally came to our table just ONCE, and never checked up on us after that. All the girl employees suck, they never smiled so they gave bad impressions and I disliked their attitudes. We had to ask another server for our check and she had finally brought it 20 mins later. And then our original server comes back and had the audacity to ask if we wanted dessert. I had started to get a really bad stomach ache halfway thru eating which is why we decided to cut our meals short. I mean no one was helping us anyways, we always had to call someone to our table. my bf even found some scales in his food like do y'all not clean your shit thoroughly?? HERE IS THE WORST PART- the first time my boyfriend's brother had gotten sick after eating here. THIS TIME, my boyfriend got sick. We put the pieces together and now we very much believe it's food poisoning from this place. He hasn't worked in almost a week because he hasn't been feeling too well after eating at Sushi Neko. I've read other reviews claiming they've gotten food poisoning here so I'm not surprised. Customer service is trash and the place and and food overall is disgusting.

Yes, the portions are great! The variety is good, too. Lots of rolls, nigiri, and extras. 

However, the freshness is hit or miss, and still not up to the level of non AYCE places, which shouldn't be too surprising but we still had hope. Most disappointing was the uni (sea urchin). When fresh, it is soft, unique, and creamy with a sweet taste. When not so fresh, it is basically seafood diarrhea. I'm sorry to say my visit was the latter. It was inedible and I could not eat it. 

On the flip side, the ama ebi was the best I've ever had here. The yellow tail was also good. The tuna was just okay. 

Towards the end they were getting really busy and were a little more disorganized and slower with service, but the bus boys were always on top of it with the water and plates.

I am a sushi lover and go to many sushi restaurants and this is one of the most unwelcoming, with worst customer service at an All you can Eat Restaurant.

""It just is.""

We smiled, she giggled, apologized, and then took our order. 

I wasn't too hungry, so the all you can eat option didn't pull me in. I went rogue and ordered a few salmon and scallop nigiri. My dining buddy went for it and ate more salmon nigiri than I have ever seen consumed in one sitting. He was very methodical in his ordering, making sure to get his money's worth. I threw a roll onto my order for good measure, something with fried shrimp, and salmon belly for dessert.

Appealing to the hipster crowd with some current hip hop music in the background. On a Sunday night, there was only one other table of patrons. 
Currently they don't have any alcohol available. Our server said it would be another two weeks or so before it comes through, but he said once they do, house sake is BOGO all day every day. 
Service was prompt and friendly. Our guy kept our water topped and dishes cleared. Good guy. 
Now as far as the food goes, it leaves little to be desired. It was average quality like most AYCE spots. Wasn't good. Wasn't bad. Pricing is as expected; $25.95 for dinner. I was happy to see trout on the nigiri menu. That and the salmon belly were the only things I wanted more of. I ordered the ama ebi but was confused since it didn't come with rice and most AYCE places give you two per order but it was just one. I think our server said the same thing with the trout & salmon belly. The unagi tasted good but had a mushy texture I wasn't used to, almost like it wasn't cooked all the way. The Best of the Best was under the no rice menu but had rice in the center of all the fish. The server said the chef probably forgot how to make it and will remake another--which never arrived. The chef also sent out some specials which would've been fine except it was a way to fill us up and it wasn't that great. One was a super white tuna with a whole bunch of sauce and chili overpowering it and another was a seafood salad. The salad had shrimp with its tail still on and salmon with skin attached. Both ruined the experience instantly. Everything else was edible but average. 
Would I give it a second shot? Mmmm... Not likely. If majority of the food was at least decent, maybe. But at the moment, no but thank you.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,7,5,2,rR5-JTEDByr-MdQAiJh6Cg

Before they used to offer unlimited ice cream but apparently they changed it but they didn't change it on the menus. My friends and I paid for AYCE which should include AYCE dessert. 

If you want to get AYCE dessert...STAY AWAY! Go to Goyemon instead!",vJWtKhckdrXSsNw0cNHU-w,0,0,2,QTXMw1mvkUyhdBr6VBz18A
