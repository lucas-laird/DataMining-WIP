The prices are pretty fair for 2 cookies and a big scoop of ice cream $3 and maybe some change. 

This little place is amazing. They have the best cookies all hand made of course and thrifty ice cream which is pretty goodi in my opinion. 

A staple in my visits to sweet addiction are literally one of the best cookies I have ever had in my life! I am not joking when I say the Mint chocolate chip cookie from here is absolutlely amazing! Here is the deal it's made with ""andes mints"" and other deliciousesnous and I mave have just made that word up for those cookies I think. 

My fave: Mint chocolate chip cookies with mint chocolate chip ice cream cookie sandwich. but lately I have been getting one mint chip and one M&M cookie.  m          m m m m mmm mm I was there last night. so good.

The prices were very fair too.  I thought i would be paying much more for the ice cream sandwich delights that we enjoyed.

Being a big fan of dessert I felt this was an appropriate reaction to finding out that there was a dessert shop that just made just ice cream sandwiches. So after I calmed down I made haste to this magical place.

I had tuxedo cookies (Regular and white chocolate chips) with birthday cake ice cream. It was everything I wanted and more. The cookie had the perfect amount of firmness so it was easy to eat and held the sandwich together. The ice cream is of the thrifty variety.  Plus if you check in on yelp you get a discount which makes it even better. The lack of the 5th star is because the person I was with ordered chocolate chip cookies that ended up being rock hard which was sad for them.

You can't say that the cookies get hard because of the cold ice cream because the other places I've been to (Diddy Riese for example), their cookies are fresh, soft & chewy.

With that being said, I really wanted to like this place. I mean who doesn't love cookies & ice cream? First of all, it is a great concept. 2nd of all, Thrifty Ice cream! 3rd of all, I wish it were a Diddy Riese Cookies instead :P

Upon walking inside, it smells AMAZING! & the decor is kind of cute, but that's where it all ended for me. Lol, the jokes on me though, because I bought 3 Groupons for this place :P 1 down & 2 to go. I got a cookie sandwich; chocolate brownie ice cream, between oatmeal raisin & chocolate chip cookies. & Taylor T. had Jamocha almond fudge between 2 white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies. We were both of the opinion that the cookies were mediocre, at best. Well, to be honest, I really did like the oatmeal raisin cookie. However, I can definitely make better cookies than this place. Especially, chocolate chip!

Also, I really didn't like the cookie setup. I feel like they should be put up front, alongside the ice cream. I would just like to see them displayed better, other than up on a shelf. Furthermore, I also wish the cookies were a little more uniform in size. I mean, if you're going to charge 75 cents a cookie, then they should all be the same size, roughly. Unfortunately, my oatmeal raisin cookie was noticeably smaller than my chocolate chip cookie.

Overall, the place is very clean & the staff is very nice. I will at least be back 2 more times, thanks to Groupon. Besides, I do believe in giving second chances. However, if I don't like it; I'm going to open up my own ice cream sandwich places, on my side of town & show them how it should be done ;) After all, it was my idea back in 2007 anyways.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,3,2,3,0Le3GSWOWAejpn4zo8e8jQ

The only drawback is that they don't offer any water.  Their water isn't filtered at all, so they don't offer tap water to drink.  You have to purchase water for $1.50.

I finally checked this place out and it was less than amazing. The cookies didn't look that great so I chose to go with a cone of ""Medievel Madness"" and one white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.

The cookie was cold and uninspiring.  Weirdly, it was also a little salty.  At .90 cents, I wouldn't get this again.  I think Subway's cookies are better than Sweet Addiction's.  That's not a good endorsement.

Also, after eating the ice cream, I was up all night with some really awesome gastrointestinal issues.   Since I made the terrible choice of having ice cream for dinner, I feel like Sweet Addiction may be the culprit. So, yeah, I'm gonna pass on a return visit.

The sad thing is, the ice cream wasn't even that good.  I didn't grow up with Thrifty so I don't have that nostalgic bias that makes me think it's the BEST THING EVER.  To me, it's on the same level as Kroger brand ice cream

Thrifty ice cream is one if my favorites. Like a few others, I grew up eating the stuff as a kid. But it's so specific, I don't know if most of the flavors lend themselves to the complication of a sandwich.  It's not gourmet, and maybe that's the problem. It's a simple ice cream that doesn't offer much depth for a modern ice cream sandwich. If I go back, I'll probably get a simple vanilla with a brownie cookie. 

Speaking if cookies, the cookies were soft and sweet, but I ended up eating my cookies and ice cream separately. My ice cream was too soft to hold up to the sandwich expectation and I didn't want it to melt while I was busy trying to work it out.

We've been coming to here to satisfy our ice cream cravings since they first opened. Doesn't it seem like there aren't too many options for actual ice cream in Vegas? Sure, we have plenty of froyo shops but very few old school by the scoop shops to choose from. 

Anyway, the Thrifty's ice cream is on point here and they have many flavored to choose from. They also make fresh baked cookies throughout the day which makes for a yummy ice cream sandwich! I haven't personally tried the milkshakes here but I've heard they are good, too.

When this place first opened, it was owned by two local sisters that had amazing people skills. Always friendly service and generous scoops as well. I have to say I was a bit worried when I heard the business is under new ownership, BUT so far so good! Everything seems to be business as usual and I appreciate the new owner staying true to the original Sweet Addiction standards. 

Favs: mint chocolate chip, rocky road and butter pecan (my kids love the rainbow sherbet, cotton candy and the frosted circus animal cookie one...forgot the actual name of that one)

Tips: 
- get the Perka app and check in to earn free scoops and sandwiches
- they have different specials through out the week so make sure you check that out before you order",QQsDdoON1lur3iaWP_GcFg,0,0,5,ytKFdLWNYvVPbmucUElfCg

Many ice cream flavors + various flavors of cookies equaling many different combinations possible ! Also, you are not limited to have TWO of the same cookie either in the same sandwich !

Suddenly the cashier yells, ""So which one of you is paying for that?""

Are you serious? Your promotion says it was free and you JUST told me it would be free. Buy one get one free right? My friend bought one. We get one free, right?

I didn't carry any money on me, which is why I wasn't planning on getting anything in the first place. My friend ended up paying for two, and I had to pay him back later. As he was paying the cashier (a guy) was eyeing us down the whole time like we were thieves.

They have fresh baked cookies, 10-12 flavors, great ice cream, soda, milk, juices, water, and I think coffee. You can buy ice cream cookie sandwiches, I bought 3 types, pick a flavor cookie, then pick your ice cream, big cookies, nice ice cream, all together in a cup, ready to eat. These things were great. You can also buy just ice cream, or just cookies, what ever you want. Everything I had was great, and I'm heading back down now to pick up some cookies, and a couple ice cream sandwiches.

They'll offer helpful suggestions so you can stop drooling and start eating!

You want cookies? Just ice cream? Sure...What you're actually supposed to do is make an awesome ice cream sandwich. You pick both, whatever floats your boat.

This was our Yelp stop number two on a three restaurant stop.  I had seen great reviews on Yelp about it and I was so glad our friends suggested we go to Sweet Addiction for dessert.  I saw the homemade brownie cookies to make my ice cream sandwich with.  The cookie itself was huge and did taste like a brownie with the brownie like bendy consistency.  (Yes, bendy is a word I just made it up!)  But what to put between for the ice cream?  Well for me of course it has to be chocolate if you've ever read my gelato reviews.  The clerk suggested a chocolate malt and he let me taste it.  Of course!  So he made my sandwich and served it to me in a bowl.  Elbowing my way past the Yelp takeover, I found a seat and started to enjoy my ice cream.  

What is it about an ice cream sandwich that transports you back to being a kid again?  One of my neighbors used to make homemade ice cream sandwiches and this was so much the feeling I got when eating this ice cream.  I felt like someone lovingly prepared some homemade cookies and made a big plump ice cream sandwich just for me.  We all enjoyed our desserts and I am pretty amazed that I ate all of it.  

We had a great time and management was so awesome to give us $.50 off our desserts for checking into Yelp.  They were very fun and seemed to enjoy having us in the store.  I can't wait to come back and bring the kids!",VtLdzz_1olnpRU6AuSsEVg,2,1,5,mCOmI2FHE2SAVPADSf3TYA

the cookies are ok... not great... they are the soft, chewy, borderline not sure if they've been cooked enough variety, which hey, cookies are a personal thing.... but for an ice cream sandwich i think a cookie with a bit of crunch is better... the chewiness lends to a bite that takes a bit to get through and pushes your ice-cream out the back (insert thats what she said here)

The taste was so awful that I couldn't even finish the whole thing, not that there was much cookie to begin with. And at $1 per (90 cents plus tip), this was the second biggest rip-off of the week.

First impression was noticing that Waffles Cafe's banner is still on the plaza board.

So what does Sweet Addiction offer one who's never been there before? Well they have a selection of ice cream flavors and cookies. They specialize in mashing ice cream between said cookies thus making ice cream sandwiches. 

I choose to go for a chocolate chip and an M&Ms with Pecan Parline in the middle. Excellent quality ice cream but the cookies could have been a bit softer.

BF and I got two different cookie sandwiches and both were okay, but nothing more than cookies and ice cream. Tuxedo cookies were tasty and chewy, mocha almond fudge ice cream was decent. BF got two different cookies and the mint chocolate ice cream, and it was also solid.

Cookies were out in open air, uncovered, which was a little odd. Would think that would be against health code but I guess not. Cookie was mashed into bottom of bowl, topped with a scoop, and closed with another cookie- not quite what I pictured but what was necessary given the size of the assembled dessert.

I appreciated the variety of flavor combinations that could be customized with different cookies (or getting two different ones) and ice cream flavors. Portion was gigantic and we easily could have split one instead of having our own. Pricing was fair for the portion, but I liked that they have a text offer to get $1 off, bringing our total to under $7.

2098623,2014-09-23,0,dYDuaXVyIXMXlmeMYf2ktw,"I had been waiting months to try Sweet Addiction and was thrilled when my husband said we could go. I went to a similar place in Huntington Beach and was raving to him about how much he was going to love it, ice cream and cookies, how could it go wrong? But it did. 

Upon arriving I noticed the decor and I actually enjoyed it, very modern and clean, and it looks like homemade paintings on the wall- tucked behind the refrigerator that is holding the soda and water. The smell of cookies was ridiculous and I was excited to start my cookie, ice cream creation.  I then noticed how small the ice cream bar area was and that the cookies were stacked on a self that was only about 2 feet from the ceiling. 

After canvassing the place, we decided to try and place an order. Like I stated previously we had never been here so my husband was taking a little longer to order to which we were told to ""step aside and let the next person order,"" there was one person behind us and she was ready either. When I looked at the menu and saw a cookie sundae"" option it read ""2 scoops of ice cream, one cookie, and hot fudge""  that sounded like what I wanted minus the fudge.

 While placing my order with the tall blonde girl behind the counter I said ""the cookie sundae please with ___ and ___ ice cream and ___ for the cookie, hold the hot fudge,""
 to which the girl replied,""so do you want whipped cream?"" 
me: ""oh no thank you,""
 her: ""so thats not a sundae, just get the 2 scoops and a cookie""   ..... 

Alright so yes, I suppose I should have realized that a sundae would indeed include whipped cream and fudge, however, I have been in the customer service industry long enough to know that you do not speak to a customer that way. I then heard the same girl speak to another customer in a rude manner. Then noticed that the male that worked there was standing between the back of house and the counter fidgeting with whipped cream and clearly avoiding with any sense of work duty-which always annoys me. Have some work ethic people!!

The ice cream was alright but a little freezer burnt  and the cookies were hard (probably due to the fact they are baked in the morning and left on an open shelf the rest of the day). I have to say that I probably would have been fine with this place if I hadn't first been brushed aside and then treated like an idiot. I also don't like the fact that no one that works here wears a  name tag. 

Personally, I can go to a restaurant that has the best food ever but when the service and attitude of the people that work there is poor and down right negative, I will not waste my time or money to go back.",Kc6XUaNsMqGKr6QWoMD8oA,0,0,2,gujaPWWzcb12KZZEbLdLxA

But, I shall stay strong and spread the good word of what a wonderful place this is!

Okay, first of all- the cookies.  Yummy, soft and delicious!  I like the regular chocolate chip, chocolate chip and walnuts and the M&M cookies.  Fiance strictly orders the chocolate chip oatmeal because he loves it. 

The ice cream!  Even if you don't want an ice cream sandwich (but who doesn't?  Really...), you can get all sorts of Thrifty brand ice cream.  From vanilla to birthday cake, your scoops are covered.

Put the two elements above together and a dangerously addicting combination is born!  For the price of an ice cream sandwich, plus the Yelp deal and their stamp card (via Perka app), it's a steal!  The people who work there are always smiling and friendly, and even though they are always packed the service is quick!  The best part, for me anyway, is that they are only a short 5 minute drive away and open pretty late!",Jdx_u3PxmXLCOyP_Pkn7Sg,0,0,5,OHsROYlH2TYJyYG-IfV5CQ

senior moments are all too frequent these days.

do you live in the las vegas valley?
do you like fresh, warm, home baked cookies?
do you have loving memories of thrifty ice cream?

if you answered yes to any of the above questions, you will most definitely enjoy sweet addiction.

We visited last night around 6pm and the place was empty, as most normal people were probably thinking of dinner, not dessert.  I selected the chocolate brownie cookie and tuxedo cookie for my ""bread"" and the birthday cake ice cream.  While the resulting sandwich was not the best I've sampled, I was happy enough with my selection and consumed every bite.  My cookies were pretty fresh and chewy.  Hubby had a simple pistachio ice cream cone and was more impressed than he thought he'd be, given that it was ""only"" Thrifty ice cream (I don't have any nostalgic associations with Thrifty -- apologies to those who do!).  

I was a bit surprised by the few (empty) tables that were dirty.  If the place had been busy, then there would be some excuse for neglected tables.  But we were the only ones there!  Also, many yelpers commented on the uncovered cookies and I have to agree with them: NV health regulations may allow for uncovered food, but it makes more sense to cover the cookies (from bugs, dust, dryness, etc.).

You can never go wrong with pistachio ice cream between two tuxedo (white chocolate and regular chocolate chip) cookies! Don't forget to check in on yelp for an extra 50¢ off!

The place is somewhat small, so an extremely large party might take up all the tables... also, their cookies are replenished as they run out.  That means if the cookie you want is not that popular (my friend ordered a snicker-doodle), then chances are, the cookie will be hard. You will need to catch them during the perfect time of day if you want a soft fresh cookie!

Seriously, the white chocolate macadamia was so so good. There is also a gluten free peanut butter cookie for those who have celiacs or a sensitivity to gluten which is nice. They also have a strange brand of sodas that have flavors like kitty piddle and zombie brain juice, which is cute. The kids working there were nice and answered all of our questions patiently.

I ordered one tuxedo cookie and one peanut butter with Medieval-something-or-other ice cream. The lady helping us said it was a new flavor and she hadn't sampled it but that it had caramel and chocolate swirled into vanilla ice cream. Sold. 

After I paid, I actually looked at the menu and noticed that they had toppings like caramel and fudge sauce. I wish I would have noticed that... but I'll keep it in mind for next time. 

The cookies were a bit hard, probably because it was late and they weren't as fresh... but they were still REALLY REALLY DELICIOUS, especially the peanut butter cookie. Also, Thrifty ice cream never disappoints and this new flavor was amazing.

It had been while for me since my last visit. It was actually at there other location in Henderson. I have always known about this location just never had that serious craving for some ice cream sandwich. I had visitors from the 808 went out for some sushi and decided get some ice cream sandwich for dessert. It something that you really don't see that often plus perfect way cool down on 100plus vegas day. This location is totally set up different then the other location. But above all the most important thing is consistency and the cookies tasted just as good. I love the white chocolate chip cookie. I got that for my choice of cookie. I can tell you tasted just as good just like my last visit. I went with different ice cream choice coconut/pineapple. So went with tropical kind of flavor. I LOVED it. 

The smell from your first step in the store. AMAZING. I feel like they been baking cookies all day long and not often would make time just for cookie run. I feel that strongly about any of the cookies on the menu. There really that addicting just might have go back get dozen cookies writing about it. Lol. Seriously cookies are tasty. The ice cream the flavor change but really not many bad choices. You can always try sample first make sure. One of the differences between this location and the other location is ice cream display. One less section hold the ice cream. They have it in the back so no way can tell those flavors only based on the chalkboard listing on the side. Thankfully my friends pointed out or would have missed out on my final choice coconut/pineapple. The ice cream another part that could order gallon to go.

First let me say that the ice cream gets five stars. Oh how I've missed Thrifty's, and Sweet Addiction has so graciously brought it back into my life.

The cookies are uhm.. not very good. I only tried two - the white chocolate chip macadamia and the chocolate brownie. The white chocolate was weird tasting. Barely any nuts, and probably too much butter because it tasted more like a shortbread cookie. The chocolate brownie was like a doggie biscuit. Hard as rock. It was really difficult to get over the texture.

They specialize in custom ice cream cookie sandwiches, and they are delicious! It was my first time there, and the girl at the counter explained how everything works to me and my boyfriend.

You get to choose any two cookies and then select from a variety of ice cream flavors. Many of both cookies and ice cream flavors to choose from, and you can tell the cookies were baked in - house.  My boyfriend is not always a dessert eater, but even he was able to customize something to his liking! I choose salted caramel ice cream in between a tuxedo and a sugar cookie. My boyfriend had cake batter ice cream in between a chocolate chip and a chocolate brownie cookie. 

Everything was super yummy!! The staff said ""goodbye"" to us as we left.

I remember the first time I ate here, 2 years ago, their cookies were so hard, I could barely bite through them after they hardened with the ice cream. They have definitely improved on their recipe and I urge people to re-try it if the cookies were what turned them off. The best combination ever: chocolate malt crunch with one tuxedo cookie (milk & white chocolate) and one white chocolate macadamia nut.  The sandwiches are very large, so I think splitting one for kids is the appropriate amount or else it would be too large of a sugar bomb. 

We had a coupon from valpak or something for b1g1 free, but it seems like there are MANY ways to walk out of there with a discount, that they've displayed all through the store (FB check ins, 4square check ins, Yelp).

ICE CREAM
They Thrifty's ice cream is reasonably priced.

SERVICE

Tip
I like to get my cookies on the side because the ice cream melts pretty quickly in this terrible Vegas heat. The cookies end up being super soggy.

The girl who was working at the counter was nice and she asked me and my friend if we would like to sample any of the ice-cream flavors. I ended up getting birthday cake ice-cream with sugar and M&M cookies. Cool thing is you can mix and match the cookies and ice-cream scoops. The quality and freshness of both get a thumbs up! 

This establishment is pretty small compared to other dessert places, and because of this, tables and chairs may get filled pretty fast when it gets busy. Wouldn't be the place to hang out for very long if you're with a big group of people.  As for the interior design/decor, it is very plain and simple. There's nothing that sets it apart from other themed-businesses.

All in all, I wouldn't travel all this way just for cookies and ice-cream, since Cream is a lot closer. But it's a nice lil dessert stop in the Southwest side of town. Great pick if you're in the area and in the mood for something sweet :]

There were 2 girls working but only one of them were helping us, while the other one was doing something in the back. There were 5 of us so we were a bit of a handful i would say. They also allow you to SAMPLE the flavors before you actually make your final decisions. 

They have weekly SPECIALS going everyday as well which is always FUN! To add to the uniqueness of the place, they offer interesting sodas in a glass bottle w/ cute little names.

MOCHA ALMOND FUDGE SHAKE $5.50 - you get to pick 2 different ice creams & 2 different toppings to add into the shake or you could get it on the side as well.

Upon first entering my impression was of a bad knockoff of Yogurt Land. Overpowering fluorescent lights and plastic furniture. While mostly white, the space felt somehow messy. No matter, I was quickly greeted with the aroma of fresh baked cookies and that makes everything better. Besides, as soon as I opened the door my kids had rushed to the ice cream counter to pick out an ice cream with day-glow color. The cookie selection is huge and the ice cream selection is decent, Thrifty Ice Cream doesn't make crazy mix combos. On first bite, you will be a believer. With other ice cream sandwiches the cookies might be too hard and cause the creamy frozen guts to be expelled so all you get is a crumbly mouthful of cookie. Or inversely the ice cream might be so hard that one bite delivers an arctic shock to the root of your teeth. Not so here, the soft cookies with the soft ice cream was perfect combination. I do have one knock- or piece of advice for the owners: clean your bathroom. I realize that if you get busy this might need to happen every other hour. Still, keep it clean, check it and check it often. Hire a janitorial person, I do NOT want the same person scrubbing toilets and making food. And if the bathroom is not clean, how can I trust the kitchen? Yelpers, go there and check the bathroom, if it's good, by all means enjoy a bit (600 calories?) of indulgence.

As for ice cream, I opted for the black cherry. Loved the chocolate chip and the brownie cookie was chocolaty indeed and a little on the decadent side. I'm glad I chose the black cherry ice cream, because it wasn't overly sweet, and I thought it complemented the cookies I chose. After eating one of these ice cream sandwich cookies, you might become really thirsty! No worries if that's the case, because you can buy waters and other beverages here to quench your thirst. 

Another thing I like about Sweet Addiction is how they serve their sandwiches in bowls. Ok, might not sound like it's worth mentioning, but eating ice cream sandwiches can be messy, and a thin piece of paper and napkin doesn't do it for me.

SERVICE
Great customer service. Employees here are nice and friendly, and I can't stress that enough.

There is a shelf with about 10 different cookies; choc chip, choc chip and white choc chip, brownie, m&m's, peanut butter, etc. You mix 2 cookies and 1 scoop (who would get more than 1 scoop?).

They serve Thrifty ice cream, which seems to be a big deal to anyone from California. To me... not so much. I grew up on the east coast. The ice cream, however, is very tasty. $3 will get you your choice of two cookies with two scoops of ice cream between them. I think that's a pretty good deal.

I got strawberry cheesecake ice cream with chocolate chip walnut cookies. The ice cream was smooth and creamy, the cookies were too hard. It was tough getting the sandwich out of the styrofoam container, so I just ate it out of the cup with a spoon instead. No biggie.

My son got the rainbow sherbert with chocolate chip cookies. He loved the ice cream and his cookies were perfect -- chewy and moist. Perfect for taking a bite out of without the ice cream shooting out the back. Just like his dad, he doesn't like to share his food, but I managed to try a little bit.

With ice cream sandwiches it's hard for anyone to top Coolhaus in LA, NY, etc, in my mind. They've got a ton of unique flavors. I'd love to see Sweet Addiction add some crazy flavors like that (whether they make it themselves or source it from someone else). In the meantime, I'll have no problem enjoying the ones they do have. It's a great, locally owned shop that I'll be happy to support.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,4,4,eSJKITXaZPNYGVjpen_9Ig

I got two quarts of ice cream each packed by a different person.  That's where I have a problem.  One was fully packed which it should be for the $6.50 price and the other was not packed firm.  Air was taking up half the space and I could feel the difference so of course out of curiosity I weighed them when I got home and a huge weight difference showed up on my kitchen scale.   

Also, on my first visit I thought the cookies were good but in subsequent visits there is just no consistency in what you are going to get and in my opinion Mrs. Fields makes a better tasting cookie.  In all fairness I have never ordered the ice cream sandwich option so in that case when you are combining the cookie and the ice cream maybe it's so mind blowingly delicious that you don't notice that the cookies are a tad dry and lack flavor.

As mentioned in various reviews, great concept, but the execution falls short. Cookies are baked in big batches and  left out uncovered(health code violation?) ending up hard  and cold...pretty tiny too!
Bite into the cold, hard cookie and your cold ice cream spills out the sides....FAIL!

Nothing is better than a properly made WARM, SOFT cookie sandwich with COLD ice cream...you have ovens and more than enough employees to change up your execution a bit...totally missing out on the temperature/texture contrast that WILL get people coming back for more. Don't take my word for it, CREAM in Berkley, CA has the same concept executed flawlessly-warm, bigger cookies out of the oven, with TWO scoops of ice cream for only $2!!!! No wonder they have a line out the door on a daily basis! They do it RIGHT.

I'm just being honest and telling it like it is, and when you have great ingredients, equipment, and labor to do it right, it is very disappointing when the end product is what you get here. I'll just stick to doing it my way, the right way...I got Thrifty close by in Aliante and I always keep cookie dough in the freezer...:p    ALOHA!!!

It's such a great place to take your kids, or a great place for you to grab some dessert with friends! If you're a kid at heart, you just might find this place is just as fun for you as your kids.

It surely took me back into time as I grew up with Thrifty ice cream. That was when their ice cream sold for $1 a scoop! So, I thought I'd pass down my childhood delights to my favorite 7 year old friend and few 7 year old minded older friends.

Don't let the ice cream casing deceive you, they have a WIDER selection list than that. They also have some gluten free offerings as well if you're not into GLUTEN or is allergic! 

For $16 I was able to order two ice cream sandwiches and 2 sundaes. What a deal! I ordered the pineapple coconut ice cream with macadamia nut cookies. The cookies are all made in the shop so you know it's fresh! My little friend ordered a cotton candy ice cream (enticed by the vibrant colors i assume) with M&M cookies. What an awesome combo! 

My childhood favorite was the malt ice cream which I am so glad they offer there, but I decided to try something different. The texture of the ice cream is so smooth and not too rich. It just melts so nicely in your mouth! I thought the cotton candy was going to be super sweet and extreme, but after stealing a bite or two from my friend, I was hooked. It wasn't too sweet. It actually had this nice creamy and milky taste too it, but it tastes JUST LIKE COTTON CANDY! Animal crackers flavor tastes JUST LIKE ANIMAL CRACKERS. My pineapple coconut ice cream with macadamia was such an awesome combo. Marissa also suggested that you try it with a brownie cookie. 

The service was AMAZING! Marissa was so sweet, helpful, and patient with our horrible decision skills. Her service mimics one of what a vintage ice cream shop would probably be like. Very personal, sweet, helpful, and fun to talk to! The place is small, but it's just right. Cozy and homey. It doesn't have that horrid commercial feel to it.

I went today because it is national ice cream sandwich day and what kind of an American would I be if I didn't partake in this important holiday?  Because of the holiday, they were offering buy 2 sandwiches, get the third free.

So you go into this little bitty strip-mall store across from a Del Taco and a Walmart plaza and are greeted with charming yet sparse decor. You're also verbally greeted (or at least my family was) by the proprietor and spouse who were both extremely helpful (and charming).

An illiterate person could successfully order here, and yet it's a little overwhelming. There's cookies on display on a rack above the counter and ice cream in the standard refrigerated ice-cream display. It should be simple, but everything looks good. I had similar problems at Mad Hatter Cupcakes, which I also recommend. But to be sure, these are the best kind of problems. My wife, child, and I all ordered combos which don't actually make sense (black cherry and chocolate chip? why not?) and got a snazzy blue soda I'd never heard of before. Excellent stuff.

Cookies were excellent. We didn't ask for fresh, but they certainly tasted fresh. The Thrifty(?) Ice cream was superb. I'd not heard the hype, but I know great ice cream and this was good stuff. The stunner was that those ice cream sandys were 3 bones apiece. It felt too inexpensive: I want this place around for a while. Place was hopping 
while we were in on a Sunday late-afternoon though. 

They have a sizable and largely-empty beverage cooler with a variety of milk on hand.

3974413,2012-07-31,4,dYDuaXVyIXMXlmeMYf2ktw,"My mother taught me that a small sandwich for lunch was a nutritious mid-day meal.  She was right, but she never knew about Sweet Addiction.  My mid-day meal was an ice cream sandwich made with two fresh cookies and a nice amount of ice cream.  It makes absolute nutritional sense to me!

On entering the store, I'm sure I had that ""deer in the headlights"" look.  One of the staff  immediately asked me if it was my first time there.  Answering in the affirmative, she explained what they sell and how it's served.  She was wonderful, and I felt like a long time valued customer almost from the get go.  That's good customer service for a place that's only been opened two weeks.

After the explanation, I ordered a cookie sandwich with chocolate malted crunch ice cream.  I opted to get two of the same cookies rather than mix.  I need to save that option for my next visit.  I chose the chocolate brownie cookie.  These cookies are marvelous.  It's a soft brownie in the shape of a cookie with a rich, chocolatey taste.  

The cookie sandwich is served in a styrofoam bowl, so if you're a drip like me, they go into the bowl and not on the table or your napkin or worse--your pants.  Even so, I still had chocolate fingers and I probably had some chocolate in my beard.  They have bathrooms so you can wash off the excess you can't lick off--well not politely anyway.

I spoke with the owner about hiking and his beginning mountain biking and I felt like I was talking with people I already knew.  It's a very comfortable, easy place to go.  And, it certainly is addictive.  I may have to switch now and then the Wallyworld I go to so as not to be tempted to make this a weekly stop.  I'll have to hike extra this week to work off this nutritious mid-day meal.  Thanks, mom!  And, thanks to the Yelpers that discovered this place and let me in on it.  I'm glad they didn't keep it a secret.

(side note, Janel S says she used to go when it was $1/scoop - when was that, yesterday??? When I was a kid, it was .40 a scoop, and I'm not THAT old!)
Anyway, back to the sandwiches. I loooove ice cream sandwiches and so I thought these would be extra good because you get to pick out your flavors. Unfortunately, even though they have lots of good-sounding flavors, none of the ice creams are that great. Second, a good selection of cookies doesn't really matter because they're all sitting out and hard. Third, the way the 'sandwich' is constructed, you can't eat it like a sandwich at all. The cookies are way too far apart and the ice cream doesn't spread all around.
So basically, it's ok, but I had high hopes that the cookies would be good and soft (and I think they should be a lot thinner if they're used in a sandwich) and the ice cream would be delicious like I remembered.

I'm guessing people may complain of price (this ain't the 80's anymore and we must get over the 25 cent a scoop deal) but when you're getting a product/treat like this you forget about $'s sometimes. 

Staff is friendly. Place is kept clean. Good amount of space. Bonus that they have the table style arcade game set up and cool unique sodas in their drink fridge.

I'm bigger on savory- I'd take an appetizer at a restaurant over dessert any day. 

Anyhow, it's 9pm and she has a craving for cookies and ice cream. I'm almost resigned to going to the grocery store to pick up a pint and some pre-made cookie dough when I decide to Yelp the combo first.

So we hustle on over, they're very busy inside their little store. I see they have Thrifty ice cream. Yes!! Then I see their cookie selection. It had definitely been hit hard as we were there late and they all sort of looked.. Well.. Like over cooked slightly burnt, gonna-be-crunchy cookies. Sorry, Sweet Addiction. This is, however, a perfect example of why you should never judge a book by its cover or a cookie by its color!

These are the best cookies I've ever had! Sorry, mom. They are soft and chewy and taste oh-so-homemade! The walnut chocolate chip has finely diced walnuts, so it's a little hard to tell they're there. The brownie cookie is a fantastic chocolatey chew and taste just like boxed brownie mix (the best kind, of course.)

I went with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with some oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies literally just came out of the oven. They were warm, soft, and wrapped around the ice cream nicely.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/diddy-riese-cookies-los-angeles#query:ice%20cream%20cookie
http://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-berkeley-2

I've only been to CREAM and it is 100x better than sweet addiction.

first of all it is more expensive than CREAM. it is $3.50 for a ice cream sandwich and $0.90 for a cookie. sounds cheap in comparison to a cookie at Mrs. Fields or ice cream at Baskin Robbins, but compared to the places in California, it is expensive ($2.00 sandwich if you pay cash and $0.65 for cookies)

2nd- the cookies were not good. the staff had said all the cookies were chewy but really they were borderline crunchy/hard cookies. not so great for the cookie sandwich experience. for a satisfying cookie sandwich experience you can't have a cookie crumbling in your hands after the first bite.

3rd- I don't think they outlined well enough what to do when you walk in. there is no ""line"" and the signs aren't that helpful. employees didn't explain anything or ask us if it was our first visit. after my sister ordered and paid she heard someone else ordering two different cookies for their sandwich. no one had informed her that was an option.

4th- got the praline and cream ice cream. nuts tasted old. soggy, not good.

positives: open late for that late night sweet tooth craving. fun furniture. some room to sit. takes credit cards with no minimum.

4451951,2012-08-06,2,dYDuaXVyIXMXlmeMYf2ktw,"I normally wouldn't do a review after only one visit. However, Sweet Addiction is very far from where I live. Probably about a 25 minute drive with light traffic. So, with that being said - it is a good thing Sweet Addiction is so far from my house because if they were close I'd be here every weekend getting my sweet tooth on. 

First off, it's such a novel concept - ice cream, cookies... who doesn't love ice cream and cookies? Then you put them together - and BAM - well of course, awesome ice cream sandwich with wickedly awesome, fresh baked cookies!

When my fiance and I arrived here on a Sunday evening it was not too busy, although there were a few families eating at the tables when we walked in. The staff was very friendly and were giving samples to the customers in front of us in line. I decided on the chocolate chip cookies (mostly because some had just come out of the oven) and the mocha almond fudge ice cream. My fiance got the cake batter ice cream with the M&M cookies. He said his cookies were a bit tough, but mine were awesomely perfect. Having just come out of the oven they were soft and the little bit of heat gently melted down my delicious Thrifty ice cream so I could squish the sandwich enough to get it dispersed evenly.

I have never heard of Thrifty ice cream until this shop opened, but apparently it is very popular in California? I noticed no difference between it and other specialty ice creams I've had. I mean, it was good, but the best ice cream I've had in my life? Probably not.

Overall - such a great concept. Very good portions for a very cheap price. Both mine and my fiance's sandwiches came to just a little over 5 bucks! That's a steal.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,3,5,5RW8zpAXCnZ7FL-CnD0mZg

I love the concept. Pick your cookies. Pick your ice cream flavor. And, they instantly whip you up an awesome ice cream sandwich on the spot. There are lots of choices for both. And, they will give samples if you are undecided.

I had white chocolate macadamia cookies with pineapple coconut ice cream and hubby had the brownie cookie with 3 Musketeer ice cream. Both of us gave A+ to our selections, and were already planning what we were going to get next time!

Cost for both was $7. And, portions were large (we had the single scoops). I cannot imagine what a double or triple scoop looks like.

My only qualm is the establishment itself--I think the store would greatly benefit from a renovation and decor makeover.

I let one sit out over night and it was still soft and tasty the next day, like it just came out of the oven.  Their staff is great and friendly, too!

Lastly, the prices are great.  An ice cream sandwich (2 cookies and a scoop of ice cream) is only $3, while a scoop of ice cream alone is only $1.50.  They utilize iPads as their registers along with the Square app and credit card readers - pretty neat!

Someone complained about the ice cream selection... umm... they have over 20 something flavors. I don't know where that guy goes for ice cream but I'd say that's pretty damn impressive for such a small little shop. But I get it... everyone has there own opinions... but c'mon... $3! Lot of debate on what an ice cream sandwich should be.... well then open your own ice cream sandwich place. Not all ice cream sandwiches are created equal.

Anyway.. enough about everyone else. I experienced very friendly service, really good cookies (tuxedo) and tasty ice cream (vanilla... yeah i'm boring... so what).

There was a line when we got there (it went by quick) which gave me a little time to peruse their menu. They offer a variety of cookies and thrifty ice cream to satiate your hankering for sweets. They also have discounts in store like $1 off for texting and .50 for checking in.

We sampled some and decided on White chocolate macadamia cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream sandwich, and the cult classic Chocolate chip with cookies & cream. Both were really good but I liked the former best. Sandwiches are big enough to share for two, the cookies are perfectly soft on the center and crispy on the edges.

5091795,2013-04-12,0,dYDuaXVyIXMXlmeMYf2ktw,"Ok, I REALLY wanted to like this place. The concept and cleanliness/ vibe is totally cool, but I'm there for the ice cream sandwiches after all. Sweet Addiction, I hope you're reading this... I went there with my chef boyfriend and we both were super excited to try their fare. After sitting down and taking our first bite, we both agreed:

Nothing wrong with the cookies. If you catch them fresh, they're a nice combo of chewy and crisp. Sturdy enough to hold up to a melting blob of frozen dairy in the middle, which I can appreciate. I recommended their visibly popular oatmeal-raisin, which seemed to be one of the lowest (if not THE lowest) stack in their cookie shelf.

Our major gripe was the ice cream. Boy was it... icy. I wouldn't call it ice cream but dairy-tinged sorbet. Seriously, it was watered down, not creamy, and just.. not good. I know there's some kind of cult following in random groups about Thrifty's ice cream, but if this stuff is it then... sorry to say, I can't support it! No creaminess whatsoever. It tasted cheap, watery, and we BOTH ended up sadly scraping the ""ice cream"" off and morosely eating the cookies. Like I said, we WERE both primed to enjoy their fare. 

I'm from third world Asia and it didn't really bother me, but my boyfriend (the chef, with professional training in commercial food safety and cleanliness) was particularly worried about the cookie shelf, which is in the open air, without any sort of covering over it, high up near the ceiling. Very vulnerable to any flying bugs or whatever else may be floating in the air. Not to mention, prolonged air exposure is a baked good's worst nightmare. Sweet Addiction, we want to like you guys, but we won't be back till the ice cream gets upgraded.

P.S. I bought like FOUR Groupon certificates in anticipation of loving this place and getting a good deal... ended up using ONE certificate and contemplating using the rest for just cookies. We gave one to one of his friends who has a sweet tooth, hope he enjoys it more than we did.",lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ,3,1,2,uzIIZkV0KKLv4XAwfR7zpg

At Sweet Addiction, my favorites seem to be the most colorful ones in the case. Like a child, I gravitate toward rainbow colored ice creams? The kid in me thinks they'll taste better I guess. Whatever the reasoning is behind my sub-conscious wanting pink and blue, candy-colored ice cream, I'm in love with the Circus Animal Cookie and Birthday Cake. They have other ""normal"" flavors as well but those are my go-tos. Cookie-wise I'll order whatever floats my boat. I've sampled the chocolate chip and white chocolate macadamia which are both winners. They're soft in the center with a little crisp on the edges--just how I like it! They've got a fridge of beverages with a few different kinds of root beer for.... you guessed it--root beer floats! Tip from the ladies of Sweet Addiction: Don't get too creative with your ice cream choice. Stick with a classic like vanilla because a mint chocolate chip root beer float just sounds nasty.

I rarely eat ice cream. Long story short, I worked at Coldstone and ate too much Birthday Cake Remix.

Located on Fort Apache with a second location further Southeast, Sweet Addiction had long been on my list of places to visit and with dessert at Hakkasan not quite enough I finally decided to stop by, the simple concept of fresh-baked cookies and Thrifty ice cream proving an entirely enjoyable pairing of America's two favorite treats.  Small in size with white tile set against pastel paints as top-40 played overhead it was just after 8:30pm that I entered the store's cozy confines and with a few families in line at the counter I took my time to peruse the options, my order coming only after I'd sampled several spoonfuls of ""cult favorite"" signatures - the Chocolate Malted Crunch and Medieval Madness particularly impressive with the later a spot-on match for a 3 Musketeers candy bar while the former harkened Whoppers in taste and texture, both.  Generally fancying a vanilla base to chocolate, particularly when pairing with accoutrements, it was with the mash-up of pink-frosting and Iced Animal Crackers between a warm Snickerdoodle and seasonal Oatmeal butterscotch that my tasting began and with pronounced sweetness found at each turn one couldn't help but feel like a child at heart, the scoop of subtly salted Pecan Praline ice cream a far more nuanced 'adult' flavor that proved a perfect counterpoint to a dense chocolate brownie while pairing marvelously to the buttery notes of a textbook chocolate chip cookie, the edges just crisp while the interior remained chewy and soft.

Perhaps not as 'artisan,' yet far less spendy than the ice cream sandwiches at Monte Carlo's BLVD Creamery or Sprinkles at The Linq, Sweet Addiction is the sort of place both 'foodies' and families can enjoy without breaking the bank, each cookie ringing in at under $1 with discounts on larger orders available as items are baked fresh to replenish supplies throughout the day.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,4,4,2Hi6us1-Uxa78LqTi6apRQ

5429126,2016-12-22,0,dYDuaXVyIXMXlmeMYf2ktw,"What a discovery! Great price for the quality and quantity. 

I committed to the cappuccino crunch ice cream sandwiched with the oatmeal butterscotch cookie and the white chocolate macadamia cookie. Both cookies were soft and chewy. The ice cream was chunky and it was just great. The ice cream needed to defrost a bit because it was rock solid. 

My friend had the pistachio ice cream sandwiched with the brownie cookie and the tuxedo cookie. I appreciated the chunks of pistachio but I couldn't get over the fact that the ice cream was green - means they used food coloring. Pistachio ice cream is suppose to be white. The brownie cookie was my favorite. Imagine eating just the top of brownies. 

I sampled the pumpkin ice cream and I was hoping for a stronger ginger taste but it was more like a pumpkin spice latte.

The beauty of this place is you don't have to stick with just one cookie type, you can have a snickerdoodle and a peppermint with cotton candy ice cream. 
Try and get the cookies that are fresh out of the oven and still warm, it makes the experience that much better- but be warned, the cookie doesn't stay warm for long, so just devour it.
Single cookies are 75 cents each, and you can get just ice cream with chocolate sauce and whipped cream if that's your thing. They serve Thrifty ice cream here.
The prices are very low, considering the amount you get.
Remember to look on the wall next to the ice cream, there is a list of more flavors they have in the back (coconut pineapple ice cream is listed here, and it is by far the best they have).
You have endless options, but be careful, you might not like the concoction of your choice, so don't hold it against them.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,2,0,5,dgkYzaboDVVNwPMlmxyhEQ

There are many cookie flavors that you pick (you can pick more than one cookie flavor) with your ice cream sandwich. I got the mint chocolate ice cream with the chocolate brownie cookie. Pretty good -- the cookie got softer eventually.

There are a few other things that I wanna try on my next visits so I'll be sure to update with that.

My husband and I came here with the family one day after eating dinner at Hot and Juicy Crawfish. I believe at the time they had only been open for about a week. The staff was very friendly. They explained that they specialized in ice cream sandwiches and offered us samples to any flavor of Thrifty's ice cream. We all ordered a ice cream sandwich and enjoyed our desserts! Who would have thought that such a simple idea would taste so good! Hot, fresh, homemade baked cookies + tasty and creamy ice cream = awesome! and for $3 each, you can't beat that. I also like how the chips in the mint chocolate chip and chocolate chip ice cream are thinly shaved, in comparison to the thicker chunks that are found in most other brands.

Its funny, we lived in California for about 5 years and have never heard of Thrifty's ice cream. After reading up on it, I discovered that they were selling it at Rite Aid. LOL, that explains everything, I think I went to a Rite Aid location maybe once.

We have been here a few times now. Our usual plan on our weekends is to eat dinner somewhere and then drive to Sweet Addiction for dessert! If you think about it, you may have to spend $10+ to share one dessert at a restaurant. Here, my husband and I can both get something and spend less!

After a filling meal at 808 sushi, it was time for a sweet. We decided on Sweet Addiction since we were in the area. The shop is pretty cute. It resembles pretty much any yogurt shop around town. They have a variety of options. Cookie and ice cream sandwiches, cookie sundaes, or you can choose cookies or ice cream separately. My fella and I opted for the cookie sundaes since we wanted to maximize our Groupon. I chose a tuxedo cookie and combined it with the black cherry ice cream. My fella chose the macademia nut and white chocolate cookie with banana ice cream. The best part about this place is the Thrifty brand ice cream. I grew up on it, but I'm really not going to drive out of my way for it. The cookies were my least favorite part of the dessert but are definitely made better by the ice cream.

Not the most inventive concept, but the end result is pretty tasty, although they could definitely work on a better cookie recipe . I don't think I'll make this spot a regular stop on my dessert rotation, but it's a good option in the area.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,4,3,E24yn0qfLoXopTHZQ6NW9g

Cute little ice cream shop, showed up 5 minutes after they were closed and putting things away and they still scooped up 2 pints for me! Mmm chocolate malted crunch!!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,1,1,5,1KAEYL8hGpum71EVpV2tuA

The cookies tend to be hard in the cookie sandwich since they're surrounding cold ice cream. I tend to just order a scoop of ice cream now with one cookie. The ice cream is Thrifty ice cream, which is cheap and OK. I don't tend to crave Sweet Addiction, but if I'm in the area and want ice cream and cookies, I'll stop by.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,1,3,v4s-HYWgBMtmHka-VYP05Q

The only thing that really sets them apart is their ""homemade"" cookies which was not something I would honestly remember. 

At least I can say that I finally tried Sweet Addiction, but unfortunately, I would not come back. There's no place to really sit comfortably and enjoy your ice cream either because the whole setting makes you feel like you should leave once you get your treat. 

Also, when I got a sundae, it was served in a regular styrofoam bowl. C'mon guys. Try a little. I seriously feel like I could've made my own sundae and made it better at that rate. Not a fan overall.
