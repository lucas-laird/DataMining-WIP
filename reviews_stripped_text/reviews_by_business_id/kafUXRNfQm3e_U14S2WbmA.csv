The dinning room is open, simple, beautiful , casual and comfortable.  Service was fabulous, super friendly and perfect.  The pizza was so good, cheesy with a crunchy and chewy crust that's reminiscent of sour dough bread.

Great (not good, but GREAT) pizza. An interesting and eclectic list of appetizers. An incredibly solid list of beers on tap (many local)... so much so that I didn't get a chance to try their cocktails, which I will next time... and there will be a next time.

Which sadly, closed a long time ago. Satisfyingly the same flavors just a tad too much bechamel aka white sauce. Maybe that's because it's made in large portions instead of the little individual dishes of yore. I'm not sure. It is also minus the bread crumb topping, which we do hope they bring back. After all, this place is still fairly new. As for the pizza, fabulous! Only one complaint, and that is to use raw bell peppers, mushrooms, etc. instead of the roasted ones they are currently using. There's just not enough flavor to them. We ordered their sausage, pepperoni, bell pepper, mushroom minus the onions and black olives and the meat completely overwhelms in flavor with the roasting of the veggies. The restaurant itself could not be any cuter and the remodel is gorgeous! I highly recommend this place. Just giving of 4 stars in hopes that the owner sees it and takes our concerns to heart because, for me, pizza needs to be top notch in my opinion to be worth the return visit anywhere.",ltSn1gx1zqumSEGO4I8lmA,0,0,4,VCk2vxiaMHHNN_aY590qPg

An untraditional dough, but very good and nice ingredients. I love their sauce!
 This was my second visit, and I've also taken to go. 

There was some weird scene going on with the waitstaff though. I was never sure who our waiter was, and I really never got any sort of introduction or 'spiel'. I know the menu already so I didn't care, but a first timer would have been missing out. There was an Italian Stallion looking guy who I think was the waiter, but he was too busy getting berated by another guy who originally sat us. I'm guessing he's a manager? The only person who spoke with us was I guess the busser, who was super friendly. 


Beautiful restaurant and quality food, but if you guys don't get the front of house sorted out immediately you're going to fail. Customers don't want to see you having a disciplinary meeting in the glass wine cellar with your entire staff while they wait for sauce and follow up. This was around 9 pm on a Saturday night... the three other tables that were there with us all had an uncomfortable expression on their faces.",KQ_XMjIB5mQS4NRhT5cesQ,0,0,4,haZ2BFshmNCmZAL-7DpB7w

We tried the sweet and spicy meatballs, the bruschetta, and ensalada for appetizers. The meatballs were excellent, the bruschetta very good, and the salad was fine.

I'm still trying to figure how this place justifies calling the pizza I ordered a large. $44 dollars for what I call a small to medium pizza.  I was stunned when the manager told me the pie feeds four to six people. I mean where are the gold flakes for that kind of price point. It is common knowledge pizza has the most profitability of any food in the restaurant business, but come on, this is supposed to be an Italian style place...where's the love back? Naked City offers a better tasting pie in my opinion and their full sheet is over three times the size for nearly ten dollars less.

In my relocating from Philadelphia, I have been missing an authentic dining experience, where everyone can enjoy themselves all evening. Yes, of course Chef Gio's food is fantastic, with their exclusively imported selection of meat and cheeses, intricately balanced small dishes, and the exclusively aged sourdough bubbling straight out of the oven, which I may add, this is the only restaurant I've seen customers box crusts home (and again, it's Chef Gio). But it's the live jazz on weekends, the variety of cocktails to excite your palate all night (I didn't think a caprese salad could work so well in a cocktail...), then thinning the soles of your dancing shoes in the lounge upstairs. 

All are welcomed here. Whether I'm chanting for our boys in gold or enjoying a lovely pairing suggested by the educated staff, I never leave disappointed or without box. And if you're lucky, you'll even be serenaded by the chef.",6toqlLTZQT6yQXnK0mL9Rg,1,0,5,GxXQUQ9zPDUUmEKOeJDvSg

3010926,2018-04-26,0,kafUXRNfQm3e_U14S2WbmA,"There were just a couple things that kept this from being a 5-star experience for me.

Pros:
- Pizza. Perfect.  Like others have said, the dough is fantastic. We tried the ""Vegas meets Italy"" as well as the pesto cheese one.  Both were really balanced and delicious.  And that crust...

And let me try and clarify something for those looking at pics of the menu and predicting your costs.  I had assumed going into our meal that my wife and I would split one of the larger size pizzas. If you are going to eat ONLY pizza, you MIGHT be able to finish one large between 2 people. But if you get an app and/or salad, you only need the smaller size.

- Ambiance: Beautiful.  Really cool, chic industrial feel.  Well lit, clean restrooms, and your own Alexa to play some tunes while you're taking care of business.  Nifty.

- Appetizers: We came as a group, tried several, and all were very very good.  Squash blossoms, sweet and sour meatballs, and bacon dates. But be careful with the blossoms... they are HOT (temperature-wise). Even their plain-ol' grilled bread was delicious with their butter and olive oil.

- Split pizza flavors: Even if you get a ""small"" pizza, the staff allows for splitting flavors.  They almost encourage it, so that you can experience more of their unique combos.

-Their dipping sauce: Each pizza came with a side cup of Gorgonzola cream sauce.... Yum. I know that some will bring out their pitchforks for this... but if you like ranch and pizza, you'll love this sauce..... And even if you don't like ranch, you'll like this stuff.  Delicious.

Cons:
- Wait times. Granted, we were a group of 5 couples, but it seemed to take too long to get the food out. And we were having a good time, socializing, etc. but it just dragged a bit.  And the most egregious was we had 4 of our 5 pizzas come out very close together, but one couple waited a LONG time to finally get their pie. Hopefully this will improve as the place gets older.  Not terrible, but not ideal.

- Salad(s?): Our party tried just 2 of the salads, the chopped salad and the fennel one.  The chopped salad was just kind of bland (surprising because nothing else was bland all night) and the fennel one had bigger/better flavors, but also seemed under seasoned.  Part of me wonders if they had an off night with the salads, but for us, both were underwhelming.

All in all, a really great new and unique pizza place. We will definitely be back. Hopefully as the restaurant ages they'll work out these couple kinks and I can update to a 5-star review.",PehenIdSDHPPoyVg7NnLvg,2,1,4,-r5LecVPXkC730SxEJtgkA

3207389,2018-03-26,0,kafUXRNfQm3e_U14S2WbmA,"Since moving to Las Vegas in mid-June 2015, I have pined for a real pizza like those I enjoyed back East, in New York and Boston.
I have eaten ""pizzas"" but there was something missing.
We found out about Pizza Monzu via the NextDoor app, because the restaurant is in our neighborhood of Monterey Park, off Flamingo, east of Jones.
We came in tonight to appease my jonesing for a real, Italian, hand crafted pizza. Having watched Ugly Delicious' episode on pie in Naples, and Brooklyn, I was in a state.
We found a very attractive, stylish restaurant with a full bar and very appealing surroundings. The kitchen is visible and they have a room upstairs as well.
When Jason told us that there was a pizza the size of the table, I was swooning.
For appetizers, we ordered the sweet and sour meatballs, which I had seen posted online today, and which are garnished with olives and pine nuts. The serving is generous with eight meatballs.
My husband ordered the Pork Reigns pizza (pulled braised pork. house-made sausage. apple-wood smoked bacon. ham. salame calabrese. guanciale). This was an amazing topping, but honestly, the high quality of the crust is the star.
I ordered the Apricot, bacon, goat cheese, pine nuts, arugula pizza and this was wonderful. There is a very delicate mascarpone dressing which you can use on any pizza, and this, too, was delicious with the pizza.
We had a great Big Dog lager and an Italian white wine similar to sauvignon blanc.
We each had 4 pieces of pizza, 3 of which we ate there. 
Servers were very helpful with our questions.
My husband was thrilled and I am so excited that this lovely restaurant is walking distance from our house. At last, we have pizza in Las Vegas, real pizza.

3397276,2018-03-24,5,kafUXRNfQm3e_U14S2WbmA,"Vegas meets Italy. Yes, it is true, dining here is an experience that will transport you. This new spot has been transformed from the classic much loved Nora's, now just one center over, into a new (also seemingly much loved) old-meets-new world vibe with exposed brick and ""Monz√∫"" in bright lights promising a bright meal. As you're seated you'll notice smiling greetings, the open kitchen where you can watch the doughs come to life and a large piano resting on the restaurant floor, with rumor that they'll be sharing live music soon.

Our server explained how the chef smokes the charcuterie in house, (side note: the charcuterie board runs the table length, it is massive) he has created a signature yeast for their delicious grilled bread (that's topped in olive oil and a housemade sweet butter on the side), dough is made with specialty (Sicilian?) water brought in for authenticity, pizza is topped with 24 month aged parmigiano reggiano at your request tableside. As for drinks, walking in you'll see a contraption sitting on the bar. That's an infuser, infusing grappa with blood orange & basil for Grappa Sour. I think she said they run it through 40x for full smooth infusion?! I am certain these are a small sampling of the fine-tuning they've created for their menu, but needless to say the attention to fresh and housemade is impressive.

On to the bites:

¬∑Italy Meets Vegas Pizza-
This is, the real deal, best bite of pizza I can remember ever having. Sweet dates, crunch from the pistachios, crisp salty prosciutto, creamy ricotta, buttery peppery arugula. ZOMG fireworks!! Chef Gio is a culinary genius based on this pizza alone, before we even get into the dough. 

¬∑Antipasto Salad-
Again, talking balance, the salad is dressed just right, light and flavorful with crunch from chickpeas, crisp chopped romaine, salty ham, crumbled mozzarella (which also gives a really velvety texture to the salad), briney olives and sweet roasted peppers. Meats are served on the side for any vegetarians out there. A universally enjoyable salad.

We haven't tried anything we didn't like, but also notable are the stuffed lemon leaves and a fun peanut butter stout.

Even the bathrooms are unique. Announce ""hey Alexa play, ""These Arms of Mine"" and on plays Otis, while you throw out your hand washing towel in a self-opening can. 

As our group dined happily, Amy Winehouse came on in the dining room, then Duffy, then the XX, and so on!.... Good vibes, great tunes, artful food & creative drinks= a must visit many times!",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,24,16,5,AVcZTuNGFYcMy7S83doXTQ

I didn't come here with any expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of pizza. We skipped the appetizers and went straight to the pizzas since that is what they are known for. 

We ordered the 'Pork Reigns ' and the 'Vegas meets Italy'. It did take close to 30 minutes to get our pizza. Wow the pizza here is unlike any other since it's much more hearty and substantial than most pizzas. The crust is thicker, super delicious and tastes like fresh homemade bread. The sauce as well is really well made, tangy and also super fresh. 

The Pork Reigns tastes like a more umami pepperoni and comes with a variety of meats (more savory). The Vegas meets Italy is a more decadent pizza that is on the savory/sweet side since it has the combo of ricotta and date cream. Together, these were great pizzas that complemented each other in flavor. We ordered the regular sizes, and it still comes in a pretty large size. You really only need one regular pizza to feed 2 two people. 

There was some confusion with the waiters and our order, but other than a few minor hiccups and a slightly inconvenient wait, the service was great. We were greeted and checked in on by the GM which was nice. 

This space is very modern and trendy, and there even is an exclusive upstairs loft to host private parties or events. This place would be great for a date night or even a place to bring work mates/clients.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,4,3,5,wJm4PVkFq-kM6ch1ekpI2A

Side note:  their squash blossoms are absurdly delicious!  Also their Vegas meets Italy pizza.  FUEGO!",2rIM8liMLw99dya1IV9rXw,2,2,5,kk36QYDHEh_txAuWj2wjng

The atmosphere, the music and the food were all top notch. We couldn't decide on one to share so we went halfsies with the Classic Combo and the 'Nduja. It was delicious!  Fresh ingredients, and generous portions leave you satisfied and you have a plenty to take home.  What stood out the most during lunch was the exceptional customer service from all the staff from the moment we walked in. There was a concern at a neighboring table, and it was addressed quickly.  The manager and our server were friendly and helpful. We are impressed, and would recommend this establishment to everyone!",EPRtgMxH27NwSebnt6_UnQ,0,0,5,folip04i7CAbt7UiyeqFDA

There is no extra charge for ordering one 1/2 and 1/2 so we chose Vegetariana (heirloom tomatoes, spinach, olives, peppers, eggplant, onions, mushrooms, garlic, basil, mozzarella) and Vegas  Meets Italy (scamorza, mozzarella, ricotta, pistachio, dates, heirloom tomatoes, arugula, prociutto, date cream).  The clear winner was the latter half.  The crust is amazing and, though we usually ignore the outer crust, we gobbled it down after liberally brushing it with the provided Gorgonzola cream sauce.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,1,1,4,XG5Tx-kfaN0h9mv8j7P-Gg

The pizza crust - OMG - I'm not a crust fan but my gahhhh - even the day old crust was good. Plus all pizzas come with a Gorgonzola sauce that's almost like a ranch. AND do not sleep on the chili peppers there! Made in house and it is fire. I hope they start selling that stuff in jars. We got half and half and wasn't a huge fan of the Vegas pizza - love prosciutto and the fig cream though - so fire. Definitely will try the pesto next time. The other half was the pig one that has all this meat. It was so flipping good. Someone called the pepperoni ""umami pepperoni"" and that it is. 

We also enjoyed the lasagna - Sicilian style and shared some squash blossoms! Also so delicious!

Cocktails were great! Extremely impressed by the Italian wine list. We sat at the bar and will definitely be back! Great service and such a great addition to spring valley!!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,2,0,5,izKJybnVJ191q-fT0wxvYw

I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed. Truly fresh and authentic! The cocktails spark your senses and are crafted with love. My favorite so far, Spacco Totto. Appetizer...Try the Stuffed Lemon Leaves!! They melt in your mouth! And in my opinion, the best thing about Gio's restaurants is the fact that he is a master bread maker....A five day process with two very special ingredients make the best bread and pizza!!

Sweet and sour Meatballs, fried squash blossoms, and pesto pizza being among my favorites of the evening. Everyone around us was raving about their meals, and I can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu! The Jazz band went on as we were finishing our meal and was top notch.

Owner really cares about his food and services, you can tell. I had the solo meal with rucola salad and pizza with mushroom topping. Giovanni's salad is a good choice too and you can't forget about the barata for an appetizer. Will be coming here again when I'm back in town",Xbf65q65s_EcbP8G5NyY9w,0,0,5,98w8l2QCcq-Ez2Av-rbZVA

Ambience of the place was business casual but there were some dressed more casually. 

They had live jazz music and its my understanding it happens every Saturday.

We ordered a small pizza but were able to split it so half was one pizza, half was another. We got the pesto cheese and the classic. Both were awesome. In fact, I'd rate the pizza as some of the best in Vegas.

Service was awesome too.

I recommend this place and will be going back soon.",hcPBLs247nlV8nT5XAc9KQ,0,0,5,XoivMvrecl4OXtnYV93SSw

Seriously, count how many times you hear Blurred Lines or Adele's Hello.

I thought about qualifying that as ""one of"", but no, I feel confident saying this is simply my favorite pizza. Their dough is like no other--not just in the sense that they're making it themselves, but also in that their recipe is fantastic.

In fact, the whole experience was exceptional. The staff was all friendly and helpful. It's not cheap, but it is well worth the price.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,7,0,5,G9ZFArswpQSXY3Y9FIojfQ

It is in a strip small so it didn't look like much from the outside.  However, the inside is decorated very elegantly -- not red check vinyl tablecloths here.  We were greeted right away by a very friendly hostess who seated us immediately.  They immediately took drink orders and kept our glasses filled.  The service here was top notch -- not what you usually get these days.  They were very attentive and made sure you had what you needed.  We ordered the stuffed lemon leaves for starters.  Delicious!!  The meat was so tender and had the perfect flavors.  We then had the classic combo pizza.  It was also delicious.  They make their own dough and you can really tell.  We loved it.  The food is made with care by someone who wants you to really enjoy it -- and we did!  We will definitely be back when we are in Vegas again.  Unfortunately I think it will be a lot more crowded next time as word spreads.  Thanks for the great dinner!",eHnfjZsS3VhD4qX1NRadtg,1,1,5,H-HoCDau7t7sNmDBIce0zQ
