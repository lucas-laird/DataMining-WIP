Hits: fresh veggie springrolls, red curry, pad thai, chicken wings.

Misses: the soups (I've tried at least 5, and to me they all lack flavor), fried rice, roasted duck.

Also, the staff isn't the friendliest.  Even when there aren't many people in the restaurant.  Not rude, per se, just not very welcoming.  And if you come during dinner, expect a considerable wait until you get your food.",X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,2,1,3,qnUY103c9SaoDc4wAeWrBg

It's incomparable to other Thai places out there that my family and I have been to.  I find their food very tasty.  Yes, sometimes service can be slow but it's usually because they are short staffed so that's forgivable. We have complained about a loud waitress who was just starting back then but she seemed to have toned down so that was nice.  What matters is that we love the place, managers, friendly staff, and of course the food.  I give it 5 stars.",ruhfDNFukUyiO-HmOW6p0Q,0,0,5,u-G5mWqjl7Tm7AL46sBoZA

The Pad See Ew's beef was a little too tough. There weren't enough noodles either. Maybe because Kalila sucked them down like a vacuum cleaner, but we still could've used more.

The lemon chicken is really a tempura fried chicken strip w/ their special lemon sauce. Eat it with rice & it's a great meal!

The service was pretty good. We got a good amount of water refills and a rice refill.

The venue is clean. It has a dance floor/stage for karaoke. There was a TV where I was very happy to watch football while waiting for our food.

This is a great place to order a lot of dishes and share them all, family style.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,0,0,4,t7LcDIWkK1mFZRcSNKf7qg

On some occasions we choose to dine in the restaurant...when you have a little extra time to spare its nice to sit in their dining room. The waitresses all wear traditional costume which accentuates your Thai dining experience. The waitstaff are all very personable too.
We have had the pleasure of traveling to Thailand...and the food that we eat at Thai House is very authentic...and transports your taste buds back to those days of dining on the beaches of Phuket. 
Some of our favorites are Tom Kha,Tom Yum, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Sweet Chili Chicken, Red Chicken Curry, Basil Fried Rice, Chicken Chili Mint, Ginger Chicken, Cashew Chicken,Thai tea, and the list goes on...
I've ordered online and over the phone. I've never had a challenge with my order being incorrect...sometimes a few minutes late...but so very worth it!!! We've ordered from Thai House so much that its a warm welcome to see their delivery driver at our door!!! They do their scale from 1-10...we usually do between 5-7...it's the perfect spice level that the dishes aren't so hot that you can't appreciate the flavor of the dish that you're about to enjoy!!!",cs3tRz0zLPLinDZpe6OhkA,0,0,5,sPUbjYO8j-g7edh4N53rCw

126291,2011-12-09,0,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"Well, I'm a huge fan of chinese and thai food, so while house-sitting for a friend within delivery range I decided to try this place out!
I ordered the pad thai, my favorite dish, with a spice level of 7 (Hot!!) and shrimp. The noodles were very good, with a generous amount of peanuts. Since most places skimp on the peanuts first, I was extremely impressed. At first, I was disappointed in the spice level. For a level 7 it was pretty weak; my tongue wasn't even hot. Then, I mixed my pad thai up a bit more... I hit the chili vein. The heat from then on was extreme, not for the weak tongued. The shrimp, however, seemed a little bit soft, maybe undercooked.
I also ordered a side of crab rangoons. I LOVE crab rangoons. BUT, I was really disappointed. They had strange herbs in them, which were surprisingly pleasant. They also had onions in them, which was a big no-no for me. I cannot stand onions, and the strange mixture of the onions and the cream cheese was extremely unpleasant.
Delivery time was ok, and price was also ok. $23 for the two dishes, delivery charge, tax, and tip.
In the end, I would definitely order the pad thai again (maybe a 6), but wouldn't try th rangoons again.",vGdrSjFMc3kJ-sbPesClnQ,0,0,3,LIjBqVn1zbBFaqtBQR7zXQ

Their lunch specials are pretty awesome! For $6.99 you get a choice of entree, egg drop soup, a chicken wing and an egg roll. The entree choices have the popular thai dishes - curry, pad thai, panang, thai bbq chicken and also a bunch of chinese food entrees - ginger chicken, chow mein, beef broccoli. 

I always crave their green chicken curry!! The last time, I thought I could handle a level 7 spicyness but it was soooo spicy! I usually can handle spicy food, but that was SPICAAAY! The next time I think I will get a level 5.

The staff are very nice and service is excellent. They sometimes have live music. Usually at night time. Very big space and a lot of seating areas.

I ordered the Crispy Sweet Squid(Which is Calamari) and the House Lemon Chicken. When I went home and opened my plates. I couldn't believe what I saw. The lemon chicken was in the shaped of onion rings! I mean how is this even possible? They gave me a small cup of not even lemon sauce, but it taste like orange juice and pulp with a splash of lemon juice. Is this a joke I thought? The Calamari was breaded and fried very hard and when I bit into it the breading fell off and I was left biting into a chewy piece of squid! Yuck!! OMG I can't believe I spent $23 on this Crap.

222582,2015-01-25,0,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"I come to Vegas every couple months and am always in search of that hidden gem.  The place that isn't flashy or touristy but that is the real deal.   The place that will show up on Triple D and I can tell Bleached Guy F. ""Yea bro, been there""  this trip I got to find that.  Friends suggested Thai House and I was so ooooh glad they did.  Don't let the typical Vegas shopping strip location fool you...when you walk in you notice it's different.  It's big.  It has a stage that I hear parties can use for karaoke or that the owners son may come out to do a bongo solo (he's about 3 and adorable) or a local entertainer will have fun with the crowd.  

Kinda kitschy but the real gem is the food.  I ate with friends and we decided to do a family style deal to which the staff were more then happy to accommodate. ..in fact we let them choose the menu and it was the best decision I made in a long time.  From the Tom Cha  Gui soup that came with its own heating element to keep it hot...to the beef salad...to the green curry...to the   spicy chili and mint pork...we really liked everything.  The best and I'm embarrassed I can't remember the name (Shanghai noodles maybe...thin with chicken) they were great.  A big deal with Thai food is ""how much heat?"".  We went from 4 to 8 (which was a nice burn but you need to like heat).

I read some of the reviews that talk about it taking some time to get their food.  We asked for things to be brought out as they were ready and it worked out brillantly...they seem to care more about quality then speed which I am completely behind.  

So in short if you're in Vegas and want to find real good Thai food...in a family run and oriented restaurant...take the time to visit.",OFObFNZ9MM7EJTuF9V9XIw,0,0,5,VYMGGrD9n_LUkVLxGNM8ow
223391,2013-01-04,0,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"I gave this restaurant one star because the delivery was actually early, it was convenient to order online, and finally the first bite of the tum yum soup was fairly good.  However, after eating the second bite it was just good and by the third bite it was ok and then by the fourth bite I wanted to throw up. 

The Red Curry Chicken was by far the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life.  It tasted like coconut milk straight with some added seasoning and the chicken thrown into a mess of a dish.  After traveling through thailand and other asian countries like Singapore (who knows how to do it right) I can sometimes be snobbish about my thai food.  Usually when I order thai food in the United States I keep in mind that it is not Thailand.  However, this restaurant is far beyond saving.

250313,2015-09-05,0,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"I would have given it 4 stars had I not realized that their calculations for my total have been wrong. I ordered three times this week! Just this week though... which is maybe why I decided to do the calculations myself.  Wish I had thought to do it sooner.  Think Ive been gypped around 2 bucks each time.  I even had to check if they raised prices again or if the state sales tax had changed. Neither has. They use an old calculator at the check out desk to which I assume they just hit a preprogrammed tax button so this could be the issue. I haven't brought it up to them yet but I will next time. So heed warning and BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR TOTAL AND SALES TAX.  

Despite the math, the food here is great!  One of the best thai places in LV.  Lherrrve their pad see ew. Its my fav. I normally get beef. Panang is sweet and savory. I always lick my spoon at the end. Its soooo good. Their spice levels are inconsistent though as with all thai places. I wish they could quantitate peppers or microscale the spice to be more consistent.  Like 1/4 a pepper for level 1. 1/2 a pepper for level 2 but thats just my thinking. 

Ive tried the singapore noodles which was bland.  Nothing special. 

Sweet and sour pork is awesome especially when fresh.  I love a good crispy batter.  Its the same for the lemon chicken. Crisp batter with a real lemon sauce.  Lemon sauce taste homemade. 

Roast duck is good.  Served over bok choy veggies.  I think its bok choy.

Thai tea is on the sweet side but I just wait for my ice to melt a little and all is well. 

Ive eaten more things from here but if I dont stop now Ill never be able to get to sleep.

But it was not the first time I found something other than food in my plate. 

The very first time I found 
hair, which I understand, hair can be dropped in food very often. So I continue to go back because they do make good food. Plus it is just 3 minutes drive from my house. 

And today, I ordered some togo again. 2 items, I found a rock in my salad, the size of half of a peanut in my food. And I thought to myself, it is ok, maybe the rock is in the veggie and didn't rinse thoroughly. So I finish the first box.

And when I try to have my 2nd item, I saw this on the box. (Please refer to the picture) I am sure this is a piece of broken leg of some kind of bug. And I totally lose my appetite to even open that box. 

I thought I can put up with hair and rock in my food. But for the leg of some unknown insect sticking to a Togo box. I guess I just need to find other place that is more cautious about their food. It was sad cause they do make tasty food.",Wiwvl_qOzdi_E3SWenwGhg,1,0,1,zaKcxMmKf4JWwdf34Qkyow

Not only do they have outstanding service but the food is always on point and the live music on Friday/Saturday night is quite enjoyable. As you walk in the staff are always right there to greet you and when not busy, able to seat you right away. For starters I always order the Pad Thai Noodles. Which has a small peanut taste but is also a bit tangy and spicy. It comes with your choice of meat such as chicken, beef, or shrimp. For my main course I always get the Penang Curry, again you have your choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp. This coconut curry dish is served with your choice of white rice, which is the way to go but if you wanna be a tad bit healthy, then you can go with the brown rice. This dish regularly comes out pretty spicy so my advice to you not so spicy lovers, make sure you request it at a level three on their scale of one thru ten. Overall I think all the food here is great, the two dishes I mentioned are always my go to meals especially on a cold nigh out. The prices are pretty decent compared to other thai restaurants in Las Vegas an Henderson.

1. Fantastic customer service - every time you walk in, you are always greeted with a smile and an up beat enthusiasm. Very friendly! and are on top of their game. 

2. The food is delicious! - I always order Pad See-ew (excuse my spelling) with tofu that I substitute instead of meat. TRYING to be on a diet. lol. Also the Kung Pao Chicken.

Going in here, I was intrigued and surprised by the layout and decor of the restaurant. The hostess counter wasn't being used, but it wasn't busy, and the cashwrap area was in the back near the kitchen. Guess it doesn't matter though because the waitress/hostesses bring your check to their patrons and all. 
Our hostess turned out to also be our waitress, and she was super nice. She didn't do much to chat with us, but she'd check up on us several times during the meal. I'd like to describe her personality as genuinely bubbly. 
I think the manager also came to talk to us a bit - she was also greeting and seating groups as the dinner hour progressed. She was also nice and courteous.
This Thai restaurant isn't like any other that I've been to. For instance, you have to ask them to make your Thai dishes spicy. 
I had the Beef Pad Thai and Lychee Boba, the boyfriend had the Chicken Pad See Ew, and we had steamed pot stickers for an appetizer. The pot sticker plate was still wet from the steam, but it came with a good sauce for extra flavoring. The Pad Thai was yummy. Didn't expect it to be as sweet as it was without adding spice, and I liked the beef 'cause it was marinated well before being cooked. The Boba was really good! It really did taste like Lychee, so I'm definitely happy it wasn't like some kind of powdered flavor. The Pad See Ew was also different without adding spice to it, but I didn't like it as much, so...

Having a partner who worked in some of the finest restaurants on the strip sit down to a meal with me, and be treated as such, is absolutely apalling. 

The last straw, was when I ordered a dish, and the taste was fishy and rancid, and the noodles were over-cooked. When I asked for the manager, the girls were extremely rude and combative, until finally, we had the manager come to our table. After politely explaining that the dish simply did not taste edible, the manager was defensive and condescending, and told me that the dish is ""supposed to taste like that."" The dish was supposed to taste like garbage? He refused to take it off our bill or even swap it out for something else. We paid and left promptly, and never returned. I was shocked.

The interior is well decorated and cute. The cleanliness did not seem to be an issue. The service was great. We did the lunch special which for $6.95 ea included soup of the day (egg drop- large bowl but fairly bland, needed a large amount of chili paste and sriracha), and suppose to be dumplings and spring rolls. They were out of dumplings and just doubled up on spring rolls which was fine. I had the red curry with chicken and steamed rice and sis had pad thai with beef. My curry was adequate... it was not even close to best curry I have had by a long shot..but definitely worth the lunch price. Sister's pad thai seemed a bit greasy, but definitely not bad for the price we were paying.

The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I personally am not a fan of the music entertainment. It's not bad, it's just that when you're dining with friends in that type of setting, I almost always feel I have to compete with the musician/singer.

How can I best explain this?  Well, let's just say that even if I had a severe neurosis about germs and scrubbed with Purell every 30 minutes, I would still offer to lick the sauce in their Panang Curry (sweet peanut based curry) off the floor . . . yeah, seriously, Off. The. Floor.  It is that good.

Given my over-dramatic love of the Panang Curry, why only 4 stars?  Well, it's not the customer service (because the servers are very friendly).  It's some of the Chinese dishes they serve, which are just average.  Not bad, but not amazing.  They have also slightly screwed up a few of my orders.  They're pretty bad at following through on requests to add tofu or vegetables to dishes.

2016041,2014-01-09,12,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"Thai House was off to a bit of a rough start with me when my delivery was a half hour late and my tummy was a grumbling, but other than that little forgivable mishap, I am glad I ordered from here. 

The Cashew Chicken was great! They didn't skimp on the cashews, like most places do and they weren't soggy either, like they often can be when ordering delivery. Their Cashew Chicken was colorful and consisted of baby corn, chunky bell peppers (both red and green) and onions, carrots & water chestnuts. I would definitely order the Cashew Chicken again. 

A side note: be careful with the spice when you order! I ordered ""extra spicy"" on this dish and it was hot as hell! I loved it but I don't think many could handle that level of spiciness. It was borderline too spicy for me and when it comes to spice tolerance, I'm certifiably insane! So I'd say their scales of hotness are on track with where they should be. You never know with some places. In some restaurants in order to get something extra spicy you have to order EXTRA extra spicy, so I thought it was worth taking a stab at deciphering this restaurant's spicy scale for all the other spice whores out there.

My only disappointment was with the Tom Kha soup because it was a little sweeter than I would have liked. It was still good though. I just probably wouldn't order it again.

I'd say that Thai House is deserving of a little higher than their current 3.5 star rating so I'm going to round up to 4 stars and give them that. I liked my dinner enough to keep them in mind when ordering Thai in the future.",ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ,18,16,4,bmi1ohkDZ9q7T9-UXNzEHw

Super excited about the fact that they actually deliver - and for a very small, reasonable fee. And you can order online - major bonus in my world.

The food was delivered in just over 30 minutes. The packaging was great. No dripping or leaking. Plenty of chopsticks, silverware packets, sauces, and fortune cookies. And two free crunchy egg rolls!

The egg rolls were very delicious. Easily some of the best egg rolls I have ever had.

The two entrees we ordered were rather unadventurous, but were solidly delicious. The spicy garlic and pepper beef was pretty much just what you would expect. The sweet chili chicken was a big winner with us - excellent batter and extremely delicious sauce. 

And bonus points for getting the spicy levels just right. (There is a drop-down menu on the online ordering where you can choose how spicy you want each dish you order.)

Food. YUM! The portions are more than generous, flavors consistently delicious, always a friendly staff and convenient for my lunch and dinner dining excursions. My only gripe is the inconsistent levels of heat. A spice level (3) one day may not be the same as a spice level (3) another day.

I don't know what happened to this place.  The food has been reduced in portions, the online ordering menu does not duplicate their in house or take out menu.  The customer service lately is HORRIBLE!  I placed my order online and my email confirmation stated my order would be ready by 8:09 pm.  I arrive at 8:13 pm and  usually, my food would be ready. 8:15.....8:25....8:35....8:40 my food was not ready.  I get a half apology by the guy who runs the place with a helpless expression on his face.  Didn't even offer me water or a small Thai Ice Tea while waiting.  I ordered my food online over an hour ago!  The waitresses scurrying around looking all stressed out.  Yes it was busy (all tables filled) and yes there were tons of orders on the counter (take out or other online orders).  But I just sat there without any acknowledgement or update on my food.  The only communication I had was with the waitress who confirmed my order when I walked to the counter and took my payment BEFORE my food was ready.  I always get asked for my payment when she has my take out ready and on the counter.  To top if off,  the staff just seemed so mechanical when I'm sitting in the booth closest to the register and they are tallying their pending take out and online orders (money) on their ten key in front of me. Without looking my way, acknowledging me or again, offering me something for the LONG wait.  I finally said something at 8:43 and all of the sudden. They come out with all my food.  They may not know me personally, but they do know I order at least 4-5 dishes from them at an average of $8-10 per dish not including tip every time I go.

2461453,2013-08-25,1,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"Lets start with the dining area. This place has more than enough seating.  The tables are evenly spaced so you can have a nice conversation within your party.  They have a nice section in the back in the event you have a large party.  They also have a stage where they have live music usually during the weekend evenings.  I love how the place is decorated.  

I enjoy the food here.  Nothing special that I would say stands out but the good thing is that its consistent in taste.  They have a large menu so you definitely have a lot of choices. They also have a lunch special during the week day so that definitely is a plus. 

The staff is really friendly although some do have a strong accent so you may need to repeat yourselves or ask them to repeat your order just to make sure they got it correct.  They try their best to assist you but I do feel they are under staffed.  When the place gets busy the staff seem to be overworked.  They try their best to serve you but I can see they are sometimes doing too much.  So be weary that during busy times your water or drinks may not be filled timely but the staff is always respectful and treat you very well. 

Price for the food is very fair.  It's about the same prices as any Asian restaurant.  Average ala carte dish is about $8.95-$12.95.  The amount of food they give per dish is a good amount.  2 dishes will usually feed a part of 2-3 easily. I do think at times the food takes longer to cook but this gives you time to enjoy a good conversation with your friend or date.  Don't go here if your really hungry and expect to go in and out. 

Overall, I do come back and forth to this location many times and quite often do take out as the food is good.

2462800,2011-08-15,1,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"I'll be honest, I'm new to the world of Thai. It wasn't but a few years ago that I was actually a Thai-virgin. I still keep it somewhat basic with simple dishes like pad-thai, bbq-chicken, pot stickers, etc. After eating at Thai House I think it's time to start venturing out a little deeper in the Thai food world.

First, their food is really good. The Pad Thai portion is enough to feed 3-4 people. The BBQ chicken is moist and has great flavor. The pot stickers might be the best I've had. I prefer steamed and they are gooey and don't fall apart. Great texture and the meat inside just melts in your mouth. My new favorite item on the menu are the Salad Rolls. Particularly the sweet and spicy dipping sauce topped with crushed peanuts that accompanies it.  That alone is worth the price of admission. Actually all of their dipping sauces are amazing. The peanut sauce is off da hook. 

The ambiance is very nice, but the service could use a little improvement. On our most recent trip to this establishment we were waited on by someone who spoke no English. It was a bit frustrating when we were trying to get some detail about the items we were ordering. Also, I highly recommend dining when the incomparable Skip Eaton is performing some great classic rock hits.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,1,2,4,ct1jUYTKhtU8iWXVNhh8mA
2466156,2012-09-17,2,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"This is my regular Thai restaurant. My good friend introduced me to the place when I was pregnant with my second son. I ate chicken yellow curry and coconut eggroll all the time. That could have been the cause of my 200lb pregnancy. And yes my baby only weighted 6lbs.

1. This place is located in a strip mall next to Smith's. Easy to access and always lots of parking available.

2. The decor is very traditional Thai, spacious, and lots of seating. It's also very clean which is very important to me.

3. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive making sure to bus dishes, refill water, and wrap up our leftovers.

4. The food:

Tom Khaa soup w/ chicken- the chicken was perfect, the flavor had the right amount sweet and sour plus creaminess. I took home the leftovers and ate with rice noodles the next day. OMG!

Beef salad w/ side of sticky rice- I love the beef salad here.  The dressing is always done right, steak is thinly sliced, vegetable is always fresh and with sticky rice on the side. That's a winning combination.

I can't remember the name of the noodles. I seen the pics on yelp and it said award winning noodles of 2011, so that's what I asked for. My older boy enjoyed it but it wasn't for me. It was to oily and had a funny taste to me. Maybe I'm more of a pad Thai kind of girl. I recommend giving it a try and see what you think. If it was voted award winning 2011 I must be wrong.

Chicken Yellow curry- I always order this everywhere I go. It wasn't watery and had the right consistency that is sits nicely on rice. The curry flavor is always done right and you can taste the different spicy they put into the curry.

Thai tea- its always amazing here and it has the perfect sweetness. I usually have this at the Vietnamese restaurants I go to. I guess if you want it done right go to a Thai restaurant.

Mango & strawberry boba- the boys enjoyed it but it tasted like what I would imagine a car air freshener would taste like. Boba was on the gummy side. They all liked my Thai tea better. 

All and all this is a good restaurant and they offer delivery and carry out. Try out for yourself you'll be pleased.",9nrji23HpxUgC_N_q9TaqQ,9,3,4,CG6yZfRTA67ccQw6i2FrDA

We were graciously greeted and quickly seated at our table, handed our ice water and menus and were left alone while we looked at the menu.
The menu is quite large but broken up into appetizers, vegetables, curry's, noodles & rice, seafood, entrees, salads and soups.
There were 5 of us so we ordered one green curry, one yellow curry, pad Thai noodles, spicy chili mint and tom yum soup, all ranging from 5 to 8 on their spicy scale.
First to come out of the kitchen was the soup, looked OK but the taste was fantastic, the chicken was moist and tasty, the lemongrass just lingered on your tonuge and the spiciness was just enough to give you a bit of heat but not too over powering, and there was enough for 5 of us and more.
The yellow and green chicken curry was very flavorful with generous chunks of potatoes, carrots and lots of nice white meat chicken. 
The pad Thai noodles were probably the best I have ever had in Las Vegas, all the other pad Thai noodles I have had in Las Vegas have been a little on the greasy side, not these, the noodles were perfectly cooked not mushy and the spice was spot on, just enough but not too much.
The best thing out of everything was the chicken spicy chili mint, nice diced chicken over a large bed of vegetables and the portion was huge, we had a number 8 on the spice scale and it was just fine.
For such an average looking place in a strip mall, I would say the food, service and the cost was WAY better than some of the other fancy Thai places in town.

I had the Thai Pho, its chicken, which is not advertised. You can ask for meatballs, the waittress said they can remove some chicken to add them. Its a small bowl.

The lunch specials are a great value and include a small soup.
Dinner is a good (larger) portion with slightly higher prices and no soup included. I love soup so for dinner I ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, they have chicken and beef ( and tofu I think) but never thought it should be with anything but shrimp. It is a great tasting soup, hot with big shrimp (:)) and lots of flavor. 
For dinner I had the garlic cashew chicken. A big plate with white rice. Delicious. I would have preferred a little more garlic in a sauce but it was a good meal with a little of leftovers for the next day. 
What made the meal better was the lady and gentleman singing karaoke on the small stage. They really enjoyed singing and it made dinner very enjoyable. I am not sure if they are there every night ( I was there on a Tuesday?) but it really made for a good time. The gentleman told me I was welcome to come up and sing but I wouldn't want to ruin everyone's dinner that way! It is one of those things I have seen on tv but never been to before.

2609007,2013-08-03,1,5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A,"I'm reviewing this establishment's physical location. I have ordered from them through Eat 24 numerous times. A couple of occasions they were late, understandable since I put those orders in around noon where they're busiest. Anyway, I was treated to a birthday lunch on a Sunday at this place. The lady attending our table (I should've remembered her name) took our orders and was quite pleasant (for now). 

So we ordered appetizers tofu and Thai beef salad. Tofu  came in quick. But then our first entrée came in and still no sign of the salad. So we just grubbed along rather than having the food go cold. The rest of the entrées came but still no sign of that Thai salad. So I asked the lady what was going on with the salad, and she just shrugged us off a bit and said it's on its way. The table opposite us was a party of 14 guests. She was attentive to them and not our little party of four. Guess coz she gets more tips from that size party. 

We we're halfway through the Pad Thai when lo and behold, the salad came in. Well we still ate it, I mean it's good food. So we asked for the bill after cleaning off our plates and I amusingly asked the lady if there was a birthday discount, she was stern and said ""No we don't have a birthday discount"". At least greet the person (me) a happy birthday. 

The whole place wasn't even that busy. There was us, 4-man table, a party of 14, and 2 other tables. I guess it makes sense why a few people were there for Sunday lunch, I guess everyone knows their service sucks so they'd rather enjoy ordering and eating at home (which I wish I'd done instead of driving all the way out there).

To be fair, I'll say it again, they're food is great. The older gentleman that delivers my food when I place an online order always has a smile on his face. But that lady, oh boy. I wish that she was just having a bad day and not like that to everyone.

So will I order food from them online? Maybe. Will I visit that establishment again? NO. For the record that was my first time visiting their restaurant. First impressions last. 1 Star for the food.

I decided to stop by here after a short visit to Khoury's.  I ordered the crab rangoon, and the green curry with beef.

I wasn't that impressed with the crab rangoon.  It was over priced, and just not that good.  I liked the cream cheese filling ok, with it's herbs.  The shell however was that store-bought, thin, almost candy like shell.  The sweet and sour was pretty standard as well.  I'd recommend skipping on this particular appetizer.

The green curry was a little better.  It was made from the typical canned stuff, along with an herb or two that made it a little unique.  It had some sweetness added to it even though I ordered it without extra sweetness (I don't know if they held back or not on the added sugar).  The dish was served with the standard bamboo, zucchini, and a red and green pepper or two.  The best part of the dish was the beef though.  It was nice and tender, and really easy to chew.  I quite enjoyed it!

They had live music on a Wednesday night, which was cool.  Just some older fellow with a guitar, but that is better than no live music!  The service was a bit slow, but they were quite busy for a Wednesday night.  There are a few interesting dishes on the menu that I wish I would have ordered instead of the curry.

The spring rolls were fresh with a sweet dipping sauce. Tom Yum soup, fresh lemon taste. For the soup, ordered the heat at a 5 out of 10 and there was some definite heat... 
No complaints on the chow main or orange chicken.

My favorites here are the White Cabbage Soup that comes with napa , glass noodles with chicken or pork & green onions. Both chicken and pork are great. It's a super flavorful light soup. 

I always order the Fresh Rolls. They're big and filled with vegetables, fried tofu & seasoned glass noodles with sweet chili peanut sauce. They're even better the next day. 

The Satay and beef jerky are also great. So many yummy menu items! 

I've tried all of the curries, I definitely like the Masaman Curry the best! It's the one with curry paste, coconut milk, potato & peanuts. It's good with any protein but I opt for the fried tofu. Another dish that's even better the next day!

Favorite noodle dish is Pad Kee Mao, I love the flat noodles. The spice is always on point here and CONSISTENT! Love that! 

Ohh get sticky rice! Sticky rice is fun. It's even fun to say! 
Who doesn't love sticky food?!

This was a little annoying, but not a deal breaker. When I did recieve my food it was very good! The shrimp was especially tasty and the pork was also nice and juicy! 

Two of the friends I went with are Thai and had a little portion of everyones plate, just to check it out, and he said that the food was just ""ok"" and that the fried rice combo plate was by far the best of all four of ours. I guess I got lucky!

I guess my biggest complaint is that the service was so sllllloooooowwwwww. OMG. Like I said, it was annoying that everyone was eating and I sat there for almost 10 more minutes waiting to get my food. The lady who was our server was nice and was very good about refilling our drinks.

All in all, it wasn't bad, but I've certainly experienced better.Maybe I'll be back one day since one of my friends loves his place, but I won't be going out of my way apart from that.

You get what it's worth if you tell them not to put too much ice. Then you'll get more of the tea than just ice. This is the best.

So I usually accommodate for this and order way before I am hungry, tonight I ordered food at 5:15 and it was not delivered to my house until 7:38. When I called the first time to ask where my food was the woman that answered was very rude and told me she would figure it out then she hung up on me! I called again 10 min later (which was around 7:20) and asked to speak to the owner, the owner then said she was sorry and would call the driver and then in turn hung up on me! So these people had the nerve to hang up on a paying customer twice! They also did not offer me anything, no discounts or money back for bringing my food hours late.

I've been coming here since 2006, but this is the first time I've reviewed it.  I generally love getting the Tum Yum (with shrimp) (I ordered this at I Am Thai, and it was so sweet and terrible, so I only get it here now) and the beef jerky when I come here.  The menu has spelling errors all over it, but that is part of the charm.  The service is usually bad, especially if you get the older female, but it is not entirely terrible.  You just might get ignored or it might take awhile before you get served.  However, given the price point and the quality of the food, it is very good.

My wife likes to order the curry dishes here.  They are good, although nothing special and similar to what you can get at the other Thai places in the neighborhood (although not as good as Lotus with its specialty Northern Thai dishes, Arawan is also excellent).   We also tried the pad see ew, which was okay (I like Le Thai's better, also its awesome noodles).  

Anyway, five stars for the Tum Yum Soup and the beef jerky.  3 stars for the service.  The singers were annoying at first, but now it is part of the charm.",7cgp0EXG11v-y4F6sDU1hg,0,0,4,0eC0JaJ-dr8NTtdH9sgDsQ

The last time I went here was for dinner on a Friday night, and to my surprise, they busted out the karaoke machine during dinner. While I'm all for karaoke, when I'm trying to have a conversation with my friends, I'd prefer if I didn't have off-tune singing in the background. A good idea to bring more fun to dining, for sure, but as the night progressed, I couldn't handle the singing anymore. Maybe if the singing had been better...

Anyways, this time around, my friend and I ordered the Wonton Soup in a Hot Pot ($7.95)- BBQ pork, vegetables & wontons in a clear soup. I was disappointed when the soup arrived, as it was served in a large bowl, not a hot pot, making for a less than steaming hot soup after a while. I enjoyed the BBQ pork slices and the bok choy in the soup, but the soup itself and the wontons in the soup were too sweet. Needless to say, we didn't finish our big bowl of soup. 

In past visits, I've tried:
Tom Yum Soup- too sour
Green Curry- too sweet
Thai BBQ Chicken- large portion, but the chicken was too dry

Maybe I need better luck next time when choosing what I should eat at Thai House, but the dishes I've tried so far have not been amazing. But what has been amazing is the service.

After being to several Thai places after our visit here, I realized that this is actually probably the best in Vegas. Thai food just isn't the same here as it is where I've had it before in New York. 
Updated to 4 stars based solely on their curry dishes. 

This place was pretty decent. Coming from NYC, I've always been exposed to the best of ethnic cuisines. I had high hopes for this place since I haven't found a Thai place I really like yet. 

We ordered tom yum, Thai BBQ chicken, Thai house fried rice, and the fresh rolls. 

Tom yum was ok, it wasn't sour enough. 
The Thai BBQ chicken was $10 for a half and very overpriced for almost tasteless chicken. It was also very dry. 
The fried rice was probably the best thing that we ordered. It was flavorful and had a good amount of meat in it.
The fresh rolls were a big disappointment. They were made with tofu instead of the traditional shrimp. They also used iceberg lettuce instead of romaine.

I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after it opened at 11 am.  So when I got there, there was plenty of parking.  I walked in and my first impression was, not bad, a mix of Thai and Chinese decor.

The ladies that greeted and seated me were very nice. So great customer service, right off the bat.

Where i was seated, I was surprised to see the vinyl on the middle part of the seat, where your knees would normally go, was torn :(  That's the first I've ever seen since moving to Las Vegas. My natural instinct was to look for other things.  My eyes were drawn to the wall as they had new dish items listed which were reasonably priced.  Because the menu on the wall drew my attention, it also drew my attention to the soy sauce splattered on the wall. 

As i flipped the menu to find the lunch specials. I was glad to see that their specials start at $7.99 and includes egg roll and your choice of soup.  I figured, this is my first time, let me try something that I know which would allow me to compare the dish to others. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken, one of my all time favorites.

While waiting for my order, I go to the restroom.  The restroom is in the back of the restaurant where you have to walk past the kitchen and where all the cleaning stuff is at.  I get to the restroom where I can immediately see two stalls because the door is propped wide open.  It makes going to the restroom a little uneasy when you hear men working.  The restroom, for the most part is clean.  However, it isn't difficult to see the missing tiles on the floor.

Let's talk about the food since the experience so far is turning me off.  

Best thing that I tried was their egg roll.  Egg drop soup and fried rice was a little more on the bland side, while the Pad Thai was just ok.  It had a fair amount of chicken, but even that didn't have as much taste.  The dish itself was overly flavorful because it was overly sauced.

One of the big pluses of Thai House, is that they participate in Yelps Cashback program.  So it was nice to see I got a few cents back from this experience.

Atmosphere and cleanliness does make a huge difference in a dining experience.  For now, I'll rate this visit a 2 but I hope to raise this on my next visit.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,0,0,2,yt8Cpr4R3mvnSfYTB-EGkw

The waitresses were very cordial and the place was clean. We decided to order the usual papaya salad (thai style). The flavoring for it was good, but it wasn't sour enough. We had to ask for more lemons to make it taste better. Next, we ordered the spicy squid w/ green beans and Yai-kee Maow. The spicy squid was actually very good! It was sweet, yet not too overbearing that you can't taste the spice. It's a good dish to share and eat with rice. The yai-kee maow, however, did not impress me at all. I could barely remember eating it. I wouldn't recommend this dish unless you really don't like Pad-see ew which usually is the better choie for flat noodles.

The thai tea was delicious and served in a tall glass - again, they didn't skimp and fill the glass with ice like other places. The only thing they skimped on was the crab in the crab fried rice... crab was practically non-existent.

Service was warm and friendly. I love how they packed away all of our leftovers for us. Originally I was going to rate this 3 stars but after finding out that they do online ordering and can deliver as far as Southern Highlands, then my review bumped up to 4 stars. Any restaurant that provides that extra convenience deserves extra brownie points.",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,1,0,4,5O0riKNxSaH4OvvxvA8X7w

The reason why I ordered the Salmon Curry was because I wanted to try something different than my usual order of Beef Panang.  BAD IDEA.  Salmon Curry tasted odd.  Just did not work for me.  

I was looking for the Crab Fried Rice on the menu, or something in comparison to Pin Kaow's Crab Fried Rice.  The Thai House Fried Rice was the choice.  Didn't enjoy that as much either.

The first time I had went here with a friend, it was very awkward. Beyond awkward. We stood at the ""Please Wait to Be Seated"" sign for about two minutes before one of the workers decided to acknowledge us and seat us. Our food was delicious! I always get the pad see ew at everywhere thai joint I go to and this place definitely did not disappoint. My friend got the pad thai with the level 6 spice and she was chugging on her water the whole time. Haha. The service was pretty decent the whole time and it was an OK experience. Nothing memorable except being awkwardly stared at by already seated patrons. 

The second time I went was less awkward, but it just told me that this place and me being physically there was not meant to be.

That is why I stick to ordering ONLINE and having them deliver :) that way I did not really have to deal with anyone. Their online ordering is so simply and they have a mobile site for your iPhone as well! I have only had one issue with ordering online and that was when an hour and a half passed with no food so I called to see what the hold up was. The woman who answered did not speak English so I gave up, haha. Luckily my food came about 15 minutes later but that is still a really long wait.

Service was great and food came out promptly. Then it went downhill from there. They also serve Chinese American food - not recommended. We ordered the Panang curry, pad Thai, and thai BBQ chicken. Each combo comes with rice, soup, appetizer (egg roll and won ton - fried Costco) - but for 6.99$ it's a bargain. The Panang and Pad Thai were good. The Thai BBQ chicken tasted like Indian Tandoori (not good). Then they were besieged by the lunch rush.

Flocks of folks came in one after another at noon. I guess other folks want the bargain deals. Most of them were Caucasian or Mexican-- so you can guess on quality and taste.

I would suggest the nearby Full House BBQ. Better food and comparable prices. They are not open on Monday/Tuesday.

There are a few dishes that I really just am a sucker for on any given Thai menu, and therefore use them as standards by which to judge the various restaurants. Tom Yum Goong, which is a clear broth soup made with lemon grass, mint, and chili paste and really just is a fantastic starter encapsulating the various flavor combinations which Thai food has become famous for incorporating. Here, they did not have a small, single person serving (lest you wanted this as a whole meal, versus just as a soup on a cold day), but it was so flavorful, I did not mind (nor did the other people at the table who, unbegrudgingly ate their portion). 

As an entree, I love the noodle dishes, and close to my heart is the Yai Kee Ma-Ow (read: drunken noodles). Here they were chewy and had just the right amount of sauce to coat the noodles, but not to leave them swimming in excess. I ordered them with pork... oh pork, how I love you... which was just on the right side of crispy without being overdone. 

Finally, for dessert, it does not matter what Asian inspired restaurant one visits, it seems that they all have banana spring rolls... though here we had, what we were told, was homemade coconut ice cream to boot! Yum!",RdSGuJ0DDCLR3DJ1KoXamQ,4,4,4,KwDXY4zm3kc5f3K8bcAH2A

Believe the reviews below when they are warning you about the worst service at this Thai place. Not only is it the worst but quite possibly be the rudest. I placed a to go order for chicken yellow curry and was SPECIFIC and adamant that my curry spice level be no more then a level one. 

When I got home it was beyond spicy ( think level 9 or 10 ) to the point where I could not eat it neither could my roommate. Unfortunately they were closed so I could not call until today. 

When I did call back to let them know that I still had a full container of yellow curry that was too spicy and that was not what I ordered, the older lady who was working during the day was so rude to me. 

She said their spicy level was already cooked into the yellow curry and starts at a level 3 or 4. Wait what??? This woman on the phone was so filled with unpleasantness.The way she spoke to me was rude, aggressive and very unfriendly. I told her nobody told me that information on the phone last night when I placed the order for the curry and had I known I would have never ordered. 

She then told me there was nothing they could do and basically made it out that is was my fault. I have never dined at a Thai restaurant that did not let you choose your own level of spiciness. I have a full container of yellow curry sitting in my fridge that I guess I will have to throw out now just like my hard earned money wasted on this mediocre place.

I would sincerely advise anyone that is thinking about dining or getting a to go order here to go support another Thai restaurant in the area. The customer service here plays by their own rules and does not care about the customer at all. It is very disheartening that there is a business open that operates under this level of dishonesty.

Pad See Ew was pretty good. We had it with shrimp. Another pleasant surprise was that the shrimp were cooked perfectly. Who would of guessed that??? Well, I have been educated. I do like my noodles with more....well, uh....noodles. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but I just wanted more noodles instead of the extra broccoli and egg. 

We ordered the House appetizers. I'm sure at the restaurant they taste better.

For that price, you can get your choice of entree  (such as beef panang, sesame chicken or kung pao chicken) with a choice of either fried rice or white rice, a small (but delightfully crunchy) fried spring roll, a seemingly pointless chicken wing, and a small soup (which, as another yelper pointed out, is hard to describe as anything but weak, but remedied by chili sauce). I recommend the beef panang - you'll be blown away.

Service is speedy although not exactly ""friendly."" Quick with refills on water and to clear finished plates, the two servers that I've had were extremely efficient. I find that in this city, servers fall into one of three categories: overly-friendly and attentive, making sure they are part of your dining ""experience""; attentive but making themselves more part of the background and allowing the food to make-or-break the meal; and downright rude. I would say the ladies who have served me here fall into the second category, and perhaps with their traditional Thai wardrobe, they are meant to be more part of the environment as a whole than overshadow it.

Now, I'm not on e to rave about how great a dish is, but every time I come here I alway order a particular dish. If you're big fan of pork, then strap your seat belts and get ready cause this will be the best pork dish you ever had. Are you ready for it? (*drum roll please*) it's the deep fried pork belly with Chinese broccoli. Regardless of the season or day, the flavor for this dish remains the same. It's salty yet mildly sweet flavor pork stir fried with a crunchy tasting Chinese brocolli, is almost too good to pass up when ordering. I'm also a big fan of their beef pad seew, the flavor is ground breaking mixed with scrambled egg and Chinese broccoli sautéed with the thick cut noodles and that incredible sauce, this review is making me salivate at the thought of it. The curry here is amazing too, my personal favorite is the green curry and the yellow curry, both served with white rice makes the dish seem almost complete. 

The service here isn't too bad, and they have no problems when it comes to splitting the check. The interior decoration seems Thai like, it has that Asia sense feel to it.

The first time I ordered from here I got the spicy chicken, mint & basil dish and it was simply superb. So were the crab rangoons. 

The next time I ordered from here I ordered the same dish. This time is was so salty that I couldn't even enjoy it. Not to mention that most of the broth from the dish had spilled into the delivery bag.

I figured this was a fluke, so I ordered the same dish for a third time (yes, I'm a creature of habit) and kindly let them know that it was too salty the last time. Their solution was to not add ANY seasoning. Omgosh- no. It was like eating water, but sweet water because I guess to make SURE it wasn't too salty they added sugar? *face palm*

Then I figured I'd give them one last chance and try a different dish: Thai fried rice. *sigh*

After waiting for over an hour for my food to arrive, when it finally came it tasted like basic fried rice that one would get from Panda Express. Not a drop of thai flavoring at all.

They let us have a party before and use the stage to sing as well. I would rate the food about 3.5-4 stars depending on what you get. Fried rice and Pad Thai haven't disappointed so far. 5 stars for service because the waitresses are always extremely nice and they're pretty fast on bringing the food out. Cleanliness of the restaurant and the quiet ambiance of the place is a plus. I love their lunch specials! It's pretty cheap for all the food you get. Overall, 4 stars.

It took about an hour and that's pretty early for them because they said it should take 1-1.5 hours. Ouch...worst decision ever since we live down the street. They charge $5 to deliver. All of those are still pretty understandable. I got 2 orders of Chicken Pad Thai over the phone and she repeated the order clearly to confirm it.

The girl on the phone was really nice and was sorry but her boss clearly said that they want us to return the 2 orders of Chicken Satay back. Umm okay? Are they going to recycle it and give it to a different customer? That was extremely odd. 30 minutes later, the delivery man came back to give us the other order of Chicken Pad Thai. He took back the other 2 orders of Chicken Satay and opened the boxes to check if we touched or ate any! What is up with that? There was no accommodations made except for fixing the charges on my credit card. They acted like it was our mistake and did it on purpose. I just hope that they don't give the food that we returned to a different customer since they were so determined to take it back and make sure that it was untouched. 1 star for the experience but it was the first time it happened and they have been so good to me for years, so 3 stars overall.",zIJ2dnk5RvPwc-E-Rmh84Q,2,0,3,39uNGoKRWa-P9H-cIgNM-w

You know what I mean, that place that becomes not only a dining experience, but a family tradition where random dinners or celebrations take place. Memories are build and as a result, a soft spot is grown in one's heart. Hate to sound cheesy, but it's true. And for my family, Thai House became that place in Las Vegas. 

Thai House delivers good food in a somewhat campy environment. Despite having the same cuisine as Pin Kaow, Thai House isn't clad in sleek design and intimate lighting. Instead, you have a mini dance floor, television screens promoting karaoke, and tacky decorations. I always see the same friendly hostess, who is kinda loud and recognizes us. She seems to have the best grasp of the English language and handles a lot of the front dining. Fun fact:  my family came in during a session where an elderly man in a Hawaiian shirt was singing 80's love ballads. Awkward and hilarious at the same time. Such caveats might cause people to leave, but I've learned to embrace the ridiculousness and just roll with it. 

As for the food, my favorite dishes are their curries, papaya salad (of course), and crispy chicken. They definitely follow the mantra ""the more, the better"". But I think for the most part, the food is delicious. MSG haters/phobics might want to avoid this place, I can't recall if they had a message on their menu regarding this issue.

Even the rice was old(it was very dry and yellowish, like it's been in the rice cooker for a few days)! I called the server over and brought the issue to her attention. While she was taking the chicken panang curry away, she asked if we wanted something else. At this point, we're already disgusted and just wanted to leave.

1. Yellow Curry - not the best I've had, but very tasty
2. Shrimp with asparagus - I don't really like asparagus, but my family members enjoyed it
3. Spicy Bean Sprouts - very tasty with just a hint of spicyness, the bean sprouts were cooked but still had a crunch consistency... i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this dish
4. Duck - SALTY! but being that I'm on high-protein diet, I ate it all regardless (I was thirsty for the rest of the night)

All in all, the meal was affordable and the portion sizes are more than adequate.

1.  They never asked me the heat level of the curries I ordered. Perhaps because I was with kids, and started with a wonton soup instead of Tom Yam, they assumed I wanted no heat level in the spice.

2.  I had a very hard time to hear the waitress over the loud music. The musician was great, however, I wanted to talk to my guests and it was a bit harder to do with the music.

3.  Ordered Wonton Soup, Rad Na, Red Curry Chicken, Masaman Curry Beef, and this most awesome half chicken fried. Not really a Thai dish, but a delicious fried chicken delicate and flavorful.

4.  They have a lot of Chinese food here in case you have to be careful wifh some of your guest and this is awesome. Some of their chinese dishes are absolutely great. How many places do you know you can get steamed fish?? That is special.

5.  Service overall was nice. I may have had a younger or new waitress, but also a more senior waitress came by during key times and she was very efficient!

I really love Thai food, and it usually takes me trying 5 or 10 different Thai restaurants around my home before I really find one that does a good job with the intricate flavoring.     So far, Thai House is my pick (though I will continue to try others).

  The one constant problem I have is that the Mussaman Curry is never spicy/'hot' enough for me.    Thai House uses a heat scale of 1 - 10 so the first time I ordered it from them, I asked for #6.    I couldn't really taste any heat at all -- it might as well been level 1 or 2.   Nonetheless, the flavoring was still good.  So the next time I ordered it, I chose level 9.    Again, I could barely notice any spiciness.   So the most recent time, I chose spiciness level 10, which they call ""Are you crazy?""     It had a couple dried peppers in it & yes, they were certainly spicy when I ate them, but that spiciness wasn't in the rest of the curry.

 I don't know if I have some sort of medical issue which causes me to be impervious to it or what, but it's annoying that I can't eat any Mussaman Curry that causes me to hiccup & sweat.   Again though, this is a problem I have with all the dozens of Thai places I've tried over the past couple years, not just Thai House.

   The 5 times I've been there so far have all been take-out orders, but the dining area looks nice, and it seems like on some nights (Fridays & Saturdays?) they have live music, which could be interesting.

  I pass at least 4 other Thai restaurants tried previously in order to get to Thai House.  For now, it's my go-to place when I am hungry for good Thai food, though I need to keep trying the many other Thai restaurants here in the Henderson & Las Vegas area to find one that can provide a good balance of both heat and other flavoring.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,4,sncaZhnoTSDnuGtbZ-igsg

1. Pad thai beef, 10.95
2. Spicy eggplant mint with fried tofu, 10.95
3. Yellow Curry, 10.95
for $40

- We came in a little before 9. Seated right away. Ordered food within 5 min. 
- Excellent service. Upbeat. Smiley. Didn't have to ask for water refills, to-go boxes, or a check. 
- Boring menu. Aren't these To-Go?
- Nice presentation of foods. Fancy utensils, napkins, place mat, and plating. 
- Food came fresh all at the same time.
- Food came with steamed rice. Came in a decorative bowl. I've been been many Asian restaurants, and not many Thai restaurants in Vegas put their rice in this kind of bowl. It's usually in a tiny rice bowl. 
-  Spice rack looked nice. 
- Yellow curry: Chicken was a bit hard. Potatoes and carrots cut nicely. Thick and well-flavored curry. 
- Pad Thai: Good. Not too sweet. 
- Spicy eggplant: Inconsistently cut eggplant. Some were raw others were well done. A little disappointing.

The place had lots of empty tables at dinner time. We placed a to-go order and waited a few minutes. We got fried tofu, beef Thai spicy salad, sweet and sour chicken and Thai iced tea.

Fried Tofu:
Average and nothing special which is a shame because I love tofu. The peanut sauce was bland and super runny. 1/5

Beef Thai Spicy Salad:
Thin slices of beef on a bed of unchopped/ unshredded lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and I asked for no onions. It was as if it was too damn tideous to chop lettuce! The dressing was pretty good - a little sweet and spicy and you can choose on the spicy level from 1-10. 3/5

Sweet and Sour Chicken:
The worst thing to order but this is what my friend wanted. He ate a few pieces until he noticed a very bloody piece of chicken. Seriously, that is plain gross. Salmonella!!! Which reminds me, I should probably check if my friend has puked his brains out. 1/5...make that -5/5

Why even bother running a restaurant if you can't even do the basics? Chopping lettuce and you know, cooking chicken. Salmonella: lose 9lbs in 3 days or your money back! Pad See EEEEEWWWW!!!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,2,1,9iJBGDf6Tw3hkN-jFl1n_w

We ordered the same dish, he had the red curry with fried tofu spicy level 4 and I had the red curry with steamed tofu spicy level 10. They swapped our tofu in the spicy levels when the food came out. We figured it out after a few bites... my boyfriend was sweating bullets with his fried tofu and I thought my level 10 was really weak. We then took the tofu out of each of our dishes and swapped our curries.... by the time we did so and attempted to fix it, our dishes were cold and he could still taste the spicy level 10 on his tofu so it didn't help much. We then told our server and we could tell she was confused because to her the dishes looked right (because we swapped them) but my boyfriend insisted that she take them back to remake.... because they did not come out right, they were cold at that point, and he still couldn't eat it because of the spice on his tofu. She kind fought us on it until he was very firm on this request and she realized he wasn't going to take no for an answer. This is very unlike him, he'd never do this but he was furious at her reaction and how unwilling she was to apologize and gladly remake our dishes the correct way. I was shocked at how persistent he was! She grunted when she grabbed the dishes off our table and went to the back. I was worried they'd spit in our meals :(
Our dishes came back out, the right way... thank goodness. We ate, they were delicious! But she just hated us after that. No attentiveness, bad service as you can imagine, she was eating with her coworkers in the corner. We packed the rest of our meals to go and she just brought our check, didn't even offer dessert or anything. We wouldn't have gotten any because we were so full.... but it was his birthday!!!! What if he did want dessert?!! What if we brought friends and family here and wanted to sing and celebrate?! Because they messed up our meals, she's mad at us?!!!!??! It was a salty end to his day and it made me upset that she never tried to turn it around. Shame, because the food was good!

To be honest, I've had tofu Pad Thai at many different restaurants, and the way they make it here doesn't have the most flavor; I say that as a compliment, however, because it tastes like it could be made at home with regular ingredients - not tons of MSG like I think a lot of Thai/Asian food places use to give people that ""flavor"" they just can't get at home.  Sometimes, it's nice to go and get the flavor of a home-cooked Thai meal without having to make it yourself.

I was also amused by the Asian couple doing karaoke while I was there; they were very cute!  Next time I want Thai food close to home, I'll be returning here - perhaps next time to dine in, so I can relax and enjoy the atmosphere.",Y76nS3L426UCz7N_1pUfUQ,0,1,4,U24EqqiF4T9T0CKivPFkfg

My issue with Thai tends to be that it is too rich, too sweet, and just overwhelming. Great Thai does not have to be this way.

Thai House is good. I just felt bogged down afterwards. All of the appetizers are fried. I knew I would get nowhere trying to order papaya salad with my friends so I just let them order. The wings and the sampler plate was at least not sitting in a pool of oil. The duck curry was short on the meat and was overpowered by the coconut. The pad see ew was the dish I liked the most. Their house fried rice is interesting, too. The pineapple, raisins and nuts made me think of biryani. I love biryani and it was different than anything other Thai place.

How about the days where you feel too lazy to even shower and can't bear to pick up the phone to call in a take out order?   Just me?   Anyway, I have these days.  I call them Sundays.

Sundays are often days where I need to just be able to jump on my laptop, fill out what I want to eat on the computer during a Mad Men commercial break, and have it appear at my door as if by magic (Gasoline, how does it work?)

To be brutally honest though, this is the only reason I ever eat Thai House.  The food is always decent, but rarely spectacular.  My favorite dishes so far have been the curries, namely Panang with Pork (the Red and Green were also good).  I've been unimpressed with most of the noodle dishes thus far (Pad See Ew in particular), and the Tom Yum soup was lacking when I've had it a few times.

There is no person that does not speak clearly with a heavy accent to screw up your order, so I am guessing that they have a hard time reading instead.

As I have said in my other reviews, I don't eat a lot of Thai food, mainly because it is full of sugar.  I also can't deal with curries so my choices are limited.  I'm the first to admit that I'm quite boring when I order mostly pad thai.  And this place, does it way too bland for me, I prefer Pin Kaow's version to this.  

But the real reason why I'm giving this place the rock bottom review is that the last time I ordered from here, I got massively sick from the shrimp pad thai (I ordered tofu and extra vegetables but didn't get those with it either).  I admit that everything else is ok that I normally get (stuffed chicken wings, beef jerky, satay), but this was not so fresh.

I ordered the beef and meatball soup with large flat noodles like I always do. And like always I ask that they exclude the beef syrups and instead add more meatballs. It's never been a problem until today. 

When my order arrived I got two orders of half meatball soups with some type of noodle I didn't ask for. When I called to confirm, I was given the run around and asked that the owner or manager call me back. I was told that the order was a mistake by the girl on the phone but I shouldve only paid $5 per order of soup because it was minus the beef strips. Wrong. I was charged full price. 

When I relayed these issues to the owner I was courteous and let him know that the food was always good but that my order wasn't how I normally receive it. He informed me that I had been wrong for close to four years and that they had been screwing up orders for that amount of time as they price is the same whether I order with or without beef strips.

The dish comes with chunks of potatoes, sliced carrots, onions, and white rice on the side. The flavor is so rich and you can definitely taste the coconut milk. The broth itself is far from watery but it's not too thick, I promise you it's absolute perfection. You can choose your spicy-ness level 1-10, I always shoot low because it tends to be spicer than anticipated. 

I also love their Thai Beef Jerky appetizer. The texture is far from tough, again the flavor is amazing. Comes with bits of cilantro on top and a side of sauce that's salty with a hint of spice. I'm pretty sure it's fish sauce.

Back in the day I always played it safe with pad Thai and lemon chic but now we've expanded to the Tom nam soup, freah rolls, spicy eggplant mint, duck curry, Kung pao, spicy chili mint and red curry. I can't say one bad thing. Everything tastes awesome!! Flavorful, spicy and hot. Adding fried tofu to any dish makes a great veggie option for all of us vegetarians. A must for all Thai lovers!",4arRGEGcg5vIAFCg7kbOgQ,0,0,5,Czdzs8l71ahgwWBwirtRKA

I've tried beef panang elsewhere, but nothing compares to theirs (I've also tried the chicken panang, but liked the beef better). Their Seafood Combo (I think that's the name), Pad See Ew, combination fried rice and Papaya salad are also good. I also like that they have spice racks in every table, that way you don't have to ask, and you could order ""no spice"" then just add the spice later esp when sharing. Oh, and don't forget their Thai Tea! I don't know if they have boba for it, I never asked, but their Thai tea is the best in town.
The service is good too. The owners are usually in there and would approach customers to make sure everything's going well.",kNCKozR1iBruWYhpZdc2JQ,0,0,5,pDzsFZjyeWb1PYTQcWpeAQ

So I ordered from their main website, signed up, ordered and paid for bill by cc, easy and quick. Online ordering shows pictures of dishes n gives you options of spicyness, meats, and etc for certain dishes. 
We ordered 2 orders of chicken pad thai and an order of fried bananas. The c.pad thai was flavorful with a little sweet, kick. The fried bananas were delicious, had a nice crunch with sweet banana filling. 
Easy online ordering, good timing delivery and good chicken pad thai.",29DWe8SD_RCeZ_A6ihxnhQ,10,8,4,teqtWsfAs8VVLUDofGY2pg

Super refreshing. 
I had just ordered from a different thai restaurant  that i waited 2 hours for and never showed , so when i ordered from Thai House i was starving . The app said the food would arrive by 12:53 which was surprisingly fast, only 45 minutes so i was excited.  Then the food showed up even sooner than anticipated. Took 30 minutes from when i ordered it. Insane. I highly recommend this place.",aMHjpbAdHfV-NGCc_Mu5SA,0,0,5,ofIY6_-naSXXoCXlH_Bp6g

Everything we tried was on point and it did not disappoint us. I would definitely recommend coming here if you are craving Thai food and want to leave smiling. I would also recommend getting mango sticky rice at the end of your meal because you will die and go to heaven. 
Our meal was 
Spicy basil pork - bursting with flavor 10/10 
Pork larb - 1000000/10 I love this dish much we even got a party size of it the next day 
Fried chicken - it was very juicy and very tender I enjoyed every bite 10/10

We've ordered from here a number of times, with varying levels of satisfaction. Here are the main issues that keep repeating themselves:

-After I had my daughter, my ability to handle spicy food lowered dramatically. As such, I order everything as mild as possible. I understand that Thai food is spicy, but ""mild"" shouldn't be so spicy that I can't even eat it. This happens more often than not, and it seems to depend on who is doing the cooking. 

-They rarely deliver the right things/everything. We've received parts of other people's orders, and we often don't receive all of our order. 

-The food is substandard and overpriced.",-3JFfPTQ4uk2wZuCKWVbNg,0,0,2,A9d4_A9oSVcbJKZnoHK6Dw

No problem... We Arrived there 30 minutes later and were told the food was not ready and it would be another 10 minutes. Not a great first impression but the waitress did apologize. So I decided to wait in the restaurant... 20 minutes go by and at this point I'm getting irritated... I ask the waitress if our food was ready and she replied with another apology "" it's almost ready."" About 5 minutes later my food is brought out to me. They obviously forgot to prepare my food until I arrived there. Not good service in my book. Now on to the food..
1) We decided to try the spicy mint chicken-- it had a layer of oil on the bottom.. Not very appetizing.
2) Vegetable fried rice-- surprisingly was pretty good.
3) Thai Mongolian beef-- very fatty

All in all... The food and service will not have me returning back. Sigh... My quest is still on.",meRvDvEWtvDcHyJsgLbK9Q,1,0,2,nCeila0C9RmEm8AhYCfFkg

But that's cool, it adds to the ambience if you look at it the right way. You can pretend you're a secret agent in a movie and the servers are extra attentive because they're afraid for their lives. Yeah, the service is really good even though everything feels dodgy. I am really stuck on the Tom Yum Soup hot pot right now and their Thai Tea is really big and super sweet. (It scares me how sweet it is, so much sugar!) This is a pretty low-key simple place and it took a bad experience at another Thai place for me to realize how much I like this place and just how many times I've eaten here and brought guests with nary a bad experience. 
They give you generous amounts of food (something I personally get very picky about) and are very convenient in that you can order out. :) They have a nice variety on their menu as well. Gosh, I even turn to their menu right when I get the flu.",-Cm0UFJ2ks2_XgvVtTqMVA,0,0,4,HO_hTQDxHsSO6rztnd62WQ
