198654,2016-05-27,0,Kbbm6Vd5UdbP10dwjBghRw,I got double double and side of animal fries. The burger was good but the fries is not as hot as it should be and very soggy. They were out of chili pepper and one of the workers said they would not be back until July because of the distributor didn't expect them to sell this quick. I'm not sure how true it is. It seems really weird that they will be out of chili pepper for a month.,Dznff28TRq2RB3Wbx42ufw,0,0,3,2DavtEELfDaYUgkyO-6H5A

She came back quickly with the bottles wrapped nicely in a box and placed in a bag. Of course the food was delicious, and even though the line was very long, we waited only for a short time.

I don't know what's wrong with this location but they have a tendency to mess up every single order I have placed in the last month. I don't know if they are under new management and the manager doesn't care about who he is hiring but I am completely turned off. They are rude, they can't take simple order down, and if the succeed at taking it down right then their food prep staff messes it up every single time. I called to complain directly but was transferred to a call center who addressed their horrible service with a ""Dine with Us""

We used the dine with us and again had a horrible experience. They can't get their orders correct ever. Worst In and Out and I have been to many many of them in this state and every where in California. 

I highly recommend yelping and then calling their call center. Let's get the people who shouldn't be employed out of this place. 

Don't even get me started on their drive they times 20mins with 3 cars. They should see how stores in Cali handle crowds of people and what seems like on most days never ending line of cars. 20mins is absolutely ridiculous for this location especially when there's only a handful of people inside and about 3-4 cars in the drive-thru.

Probably one of the tasty burgers especially when you add grilled onions. For the bigger order you can order a 3x3 or 4x4 patty. I usually order with no salt on the patty, lettuce tomato, cheese and grill onions only and they do a great job. I also get fries well done not salt and sometimes with cheese and grill onions. Anytime I have a craving its a cheap eat to satisfy the palate. BTW: If you're going to eat bad mine as well go all the way and wash it down with a soda. I can always trust In-n-out to do a great job of filling my order.

The food is a hit or miss at this location and that's not a good thing. It so isn't that bad. I mean some times it's like OH MY GOD this is why I love In-n-Out and sometimes it's like ummmm, it's just not all that great. 

Tonight never the less was a good night. The Resturant is pretty much always busy by the way but food always seem to come out at a decent time. Tonight the buns were toasted perfectly where the edge is buttery and crunchy and the burger is juicy. The fries are the fries but this time it was not too hard and not too soft and with just the right amount of salting.

There was a good size line in the drive thru lane (not too big to where there had to be a live person outside taking curb side orders) but a size. With that said food was fresh and line moved quick. It is also nice that the drive thru is all glass and you can see them cooking inside which is entertaining and makes you forget that you are waiting when you are killing time in line. 

Anyhow I haven't yet had a bad experience with service every time have been extremely pleasant but food needs to be consistence.

If you 're craving some In-N-Out and don't wanna wait too long at the always crowded Tropicana location definitely hit up this locations.  It is only a few miles south and you're basically In-N-Out as you should.  No 50 or so taxis, limos, or drunks pedestrians in your way. The main reason for the review.  Because this is located in a shopping center there are lots of parking spots to dine in your car, which the Tropicana location lacks when busy.

I'm not a huge fan of In-N-Out but I do occasionally enjoy their burgers which are pretty good for fast food burgers, then again so is Carl's Jr.  I do not eat their fries and think they're terrible.  I am not a fan of ""secret"" menu I'd like to know what my choices are especially from a fast food joint.

I ordered a number 1: double double animal style, fries, and a Dr. Pepper for my brother and an animal style cheeseburger for myself. The person that gave me my food was pretty funny. I asked him for some ketchup and when I already had the bag in my hand he said, ""Oh, here's some ketchup..SLAM DUNK!"" and he put the ketchup in the bag as if he were really doing a slam dunk. The service itself deserves 4 stars. I was probably In-N-Out within five minutes.

Once I got home, I dug into my cheeseburger. It was mighty orgasmic. Imagine not eating chocolate (if you love chocolate) for a few months, then finally having a delicious chocolate truffle.

Moving to Vegas 5 years ago from small town Kansas I had never tried In-n-Out before. First I didn't even know what it was, now I eat here every chance I get. And for good reason.
The consistency of the burgers are always spot on, they've really got this assembly line thing down!!! Almost always I order my burger with grilled onions, and I always get animal style on the fries. The fries are cut fresh from huge potatoes, you can watch them smash and string the potatoes right before they throw them in the fryer and serve them to you. The burger always has a little crispiness to the bun and the cheese drips out of the burger as you eat it. MY KIND OF BURGER!!!! Luckily I've always had a fast metabolism and can eat about whatever I want and stay pretty lean and it's a good thing! There's plenty of calories in this meal!

The menu is simple and ordering is as easy as 1, 2, 3 (i'm not just saying that #1 combo is a double double, fries and a drink, #2 is a cheeseburger, fries and a drink and #3 is a hamburger, fries and a drink). However...there are ways to keep your burgers not boring...you guessed it...i'm talking about ANIMAL STYLE (roughly translated...extra sauce, extra cheese and extra grilled onions). My favorite meal (and probably one I would pick before I go and meet the Lord someday many moons from now) is a #1 animal style, well done fries (takes a bit longer but well worth the wait), rootbeer and if i'm feeling saucy (which is pretty common) I go for the vanilla milkshake. 

This is a great place for your anklebiters too! They give the kids free stickers at the cashier and they will slice up a burger so they can share (just say you want a kids hamburger or cheeseburger cut up). Will always come to In-N-Out because its tasty, cheap and its just what I do.",COjPTDD-tFr73Gly2xL3gw,1,1,5,LG5cronSrU2XNfvir3wAgA

People on the east coast have compared it to Shake Shack, which added to my skepticism. Shake Shack is okay, but it tries to be more of a fancier joint - plus it's pricey! I'm glad In-N-Out embraces its menu, and knows who it is: simple, fast food. Now I know why people speak of its lore, it's so good! It's really a shame that we don't have In-N-Out in FL, it would be my favorite place to get burgers. I loved that all of the ingredients in the burger were fresh, but still easy to hold in my hand. I also enjoyed the the fries tasted like they were cut that day, and didn't have gallons of salt like other fast food fries.

I have visited In-N-Out a countless number of times, and from that, I cannot think of a single time where I was less than satisfied. 

The food is incredible, yet simple. The staff is super friendly. And for how crowded it usually is, In-N-Out delivers their product consistently, and at lightning speed. 

A few tips for the newbies: 

~ In-N-Out has a secret menu. Be sure to ask for things like grilled onions, chopped peppers, protein style (no bun, wrapped in lettuce), the 4x4 (4 patties and 4 pieces of cheese), animal fries (fries with cheese, sauce, and grilled onions), or even a grilled cheese!

~ In-N-Out's fries usually run on the chewy side. Ask for them well done if you want them nice and crispy; they make them fresh to order! 

Overall, you need In-N-Out in your life. This is not a topic for debate. If you read this review, start driving and do yourself the best thing you could do all day.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,5,8w2dsa_1Kz8jK00926NFrw

The food was great as expected but what this review is for, is for management.
My family and flew to Vegas for my 21st birthday and were excited to see an In N Out, as we dont have one in Seattle. We sat outside and there are pigeons which is totally fine we love animals but what really disgusted me was the teenagers sitting adjacent to us throwing their used sauce packets at the birds, when we spoke up about it to them IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS they ignored us but figured they got the message. After about 10 minutes the parents left the kids and drove off. 5 minutes pass and they do the same thing as last time, this time hitting the bird. We spoke up AGAIN and they started arguing with us about it. So my mom got management to come out and do whatever they had to do, if that meant kicking them out or telling them to stop. Well that didnt go so well. They brought out what looked like their best friend as when he came out they greeted him by first name and gave him pats on the back as he told them quietly to ""chill out"" as soon as he left the kids laughed at us. Right after that they threw ANOTHER sauce packet and after that we didnt say anything, we just went inside and asked for the General Manager or a phone number we can talk to and were told that ""these are just how Las Vegas kids are"" we got outside and another older lady speaking to them telling them about respect for elders and soon after they left. The point is Management did absolutely nothing if the kid that was sent out even was management. 
Food was good though.",kXtvBLGo3pDPpr4VHgjRSQ,0,0,1,1H7AAlCAj477WF6TMyQjKA
3620679,2013-05-09,5,Kbbm6Vd5UdbP10dwjBghRw,"Let's get 1 thing straight. I love In N Out! so it pains me to write this...

I've had it in several states in the last 14 years. Its still one of my favorite spots. 

People seem to get overly excited about the secret menu, and that's nice and all, but it's nothing new, far from secret, and definitely not a game changer...funny how people love to be in the know of anything that's supposedly ""secret""..it's not illuminati folks!...lol ..(extra crispy fries, animal style, protein style, etc, etc) yes its good stuff but lets face it, the bragging rights component is far more important (to most people) than anything you'll consume, cause again, it's not overwhelmingly great...it's good though. I just laugh when I witness first hand the smugness and self satisfaction people experience as they share this ""life altering news"" as if they know some secret MI6 agent behind the counter that can ""hook them up, cause they are special""... like disney dust to a 5 year old..all because they know the secret ""language"" lol..(out of towners that might have In N Out twice a year become cool kids all of a sudden)......Jheer ahsum dewd!

Ok so now that we have that out of the way, I would have given the review 5 stars, since In N Out is one of my top 3 burgers (along with Dicks in Seattle and 5 Guys), however the service at this specific location is so poor I had to average the score.

I've been to this location since they first opened years ago, and this place has really suffered a major decline..

Service here, especially at night, really sucks. They take waaaaaaaaaaay longer than  usual to fulfill your order, the place is never clean, homeless constantly pan handle at this location (they stand right next to the entrance and pan handle) and mgmt does nothing about it. The funny thing is, by comparison, they aren't THAT busy!  Is it because they are under staffed?  Whatever it is, it's VERY noticeable if you've ever eaten at In n Out before. 

The pedestrian drive thru order taker is rarely there, and when they are, they can't get  to the entire line since the signal range on their device only goes up to 5 ft from the normal drive through speaker box (so what the F is the point?!?!?) Several times I'll provide my order to this drive thru walker, only to have them say, ""I'm sorry sir but something is wrong with our mobile system, just pull forward and provide them your order""..an absolute waste of time further delaying the experience.....Other things that have happened here on several occasions: incorrect change given, incorrect order (who the hell messes up a plain cheeseburger?), overcharged, cold and stale fries, rude service, always forgetting items, salt, ketchup, napkins (drive thru), and massive delays...to name a few.

If I were to sum up THIS SPECIFIC In N Out location, it would be to compare it to that of a McDonald's....IN A WALMART!  And If you don't know what I'm talking about, go to any Walmart in Las Vegas, and dine in at the built in McDonalds, they all have them. It's what it sounds like, and what you would expect. Shitty on many levels. Sub Par even for Fast Food Standards...

Bottom Line: Save yourself some trouble and skip this location, head to Five Guys which is just up the road less than 2 mins north on LVB, or if you are set on In N Out, head to the Ft Apache or Tropicana location.",qmDuC6dwWvtWHFt-xNovag,4,0,2,5T6Binl4ayX1qJ5RD7Xu_g

The wait was a bit longer than your average fast food restaurant but that's because they make each burger fresh.  It arrived neatly wrapped and ready to eat with a side of freshly cut fries.  The bun wasn't soggy at all and every bite was as fresh as the last.  Could've been one of the best burgers I'd ever had.

I also ordered a vanilla milkshake which was SUPER thick and tasty.  I love milkshakes but hate how they can melt before you're done.  Not this one.  They're practically serving you soft-serve in a cup and straw.  

The customer service was unusually excellent for a fast food place.  Sure, they are trying to resemble a 50's burger joint.  Hence, the limited menu (i.e. no swiss mushroom angus burger with jalapenos etc, no kids meals and toys, etc) and something that most fast food places have neglected.....something called customer service.  Both of the gentlemen working the floor were very kind and came over to our table multiple times to see how things were.  Very unusual for a fast food place but very welcomed!

I think that I would be here a lot more, but it's so damn busy.  The drive thru lines are long.  The lines inside is even longer.  A typical order for me is a Double Double (spread only & extra toast), with fries, and an extra Cheeseburger (also with spread only & extra toast).  Lately, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties / 4 cheese).  Overall, I can't complain.  The lines may be long, but always worth it.

I got a to regular cheese burger with grilled onions and chopped pepers (peppers are not that spicy). This chain always toasts the bread to perfection. I took this burger home and was about a 15 minute drive and it was still hot and crunchy! 

In and out is not like other fast food burger joints. The taste and recipe have always stayed consistent since I was kid. They also make the burger right when you order it, so if you're dining in, be prepared to wait. 

The drive thru line is very efficient and fast.  Don't let the multiple cars fool you! There's always a staff member taking orders from you car that way it makes the lineore faster. There was probably about 8 cars in front of me and we waited about 10 min only. Super quick!

He might not be compelling me to eat a 3x3 animal style, but the biblical references on the wrappers and cups are conclusive evidence that he (or she) approves my fast food consumption. When it comes to Vegas locations, the Blue Diamond offers a fantastic experience that is worth whatever time out of the way it might be. 

The menu is simple. Its a burger that you come here for and the object of ordering at INO is to order off the ""secret"" menu or to try and stump or surprise the staff with a new concoction. If you think you are up to the challenge, try the 3x3 or the 4x4 which is exactly as it sounds three patties and three slices of cheese or four patties and four slices. Getting anything (except the shakes and your soda) ""animal style"" is clearly a must. Animal style throws on a slice of cheese, a thousand island style spread and onions.

The shakes are creamy and flavorful, don't even hesitate if the thought pops in your head to mix flavors. I personally enjoy the neapolitan. If shakes aren't your thing, be sure to get a icy cold coke, it goes beautifully with the burger and fries and just soothes your soul.

Service is good and the staff are incredibly spot on. The orders came out perfectly despite the complexity and the lines moved at a nice pace while still offering attentive service. It clearly puts its other fast-food counterparts to shame.

I mentioned that it is worth the time out of the way. If you happen to be visiting sin city, the Dean Martin drive location near the strip might be the easiest to get to, but the wait might be a little long for your liking, especially when the pangs of hunger should strike. Head south for about ten minutes and it will be well worth the effort.",Gg3K7jsyWEl6TlGmhodODg,3,2,4,ahoUCaK2CyGa04tf1wYapw

  Speaking of animal style, in the fast food jungle, In N Out is an animal with the style of simplicity and efficiency. It is delicious fast food made simple. With the exception of a secret menu, there are only three meals to choose from. A hamburger meal, a cheeseburger meal, or double cheeseburger meal. It is simplicity made fresh. Forget about ordinary burgers being left under warm lights or frozen patties warming up in a microwave style device. At In N Out, they cook the burger right there and in front of the customer.

  Delicious fast food made simple is brings me inside the Blue Diamond Road In N Out Burger oftentimes when I am in the vicinity of the Target in the parking lot. Lol. Sometimes I go out of my way to do an errand in this Target just for an excuse to patronize In N Out. The thing is, it seems that on any given visit hundreds of people are also patronizing In N Out. The upshot us that I am rarely in n out. But then again I always dine inside. Regardless that I might be number 240 and they are serving customer 186; efficiency speeds up the wait. Due to supply and demand, In N Out is so popular that finding a table is as difficult as finding a cold day on a June in Las Vegas. Just like at any In N Out; I consider myself satisfied sitting at a bar chair. 

  On the subject of crowded, I observed that at In N Out; customers rarely seem agitated or annoyed. Ditto for the employees. The employees here are even friendlier than at casual dining restaurants that I have experienced. An example is last Saturday when I dined here, a friendly employee went up to all the customers asking how the food was and making small talk.

   In a City where there are countless restaurants to dine in, In N Out is the ultimate option. It is upbeat, inexpensive,  and delicious. When it comes to yelping this In N Out, I give it a 4 star bark :-)",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,9,4,MJWqebaAevHIjgOLGoeBXg

Burgers - They are well-known for a reason! In-N-Out burgers are freshly prepared with 100% pure beef patties that are cooked to order. The patties are well-seasoned and juicy. Toppings include tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and onions. Their special sauce (mayo, mustard-like) is delicious and adds great flavor to the burger. The freshness and quality of their ingredients come across with every bite!

Animal-Style Fries - Another distinguisher of In-N-Out are their ""animal-style"" fries. Their fries include freshly-cut potatoes topped with their secret spread and grilled onions. Unfortunately I am not a huge fan of the fries. The spread and grilled onions end up leaving the fries pretty soggy and I personally prefer fries with a super crisp texture.

Long wait which is annoying for a fast food that is called In and Out (seriously!)
The fries had a weird texture, almost like they didnt sit in the fryer for the right amount of time. The burger was alright-but dont expect to be mind blown (huge plus that it wasnt greasy at all which is atypical for a cheap burger place)",NOR1Yne-yCXWGw4Tntu1dQ,0,0,2,Wxsw6EmoA70kXaJg1eM1Pw

I always go with a cheeseburger lite spread and grilled onions and animal style fries and fresh brewed iced tea.... sometimes I totally splurge and get a vanilla milkshake!

5913338,2013-07-10,0,Kbbm6Vd5UdbP10dwjBghRw,I don't get it... it is a fast food joint.  The burgers are okay and the staff is great!  But how do they turn real potatoes into those weird things they call French fries?  They are okay as long as they are hot but let them cool down and they get this strange texture.  It isn't terrible and the price is right but it wouldn't be my first choice.  They do hire and or train exceptional staff.,DEierz5cfjM4PQKwU2vaKA,0,0,2,SnSsAvOGaIf4EsX3ctdNqg

I mean what else is there to say? In n out has the tastiest burgers in Vegas. I'm sorry but I don't agree with the new burger places. In n out still beats em all!",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,6,3,5,16q8H78nPgxmNx3E4kb7Tw

You've even managed to make me start enjoying your odd french fries. I can't understand it, though I'm sure it's along the lines of sorcery or Jedi mind trickery.

So why when there are a thousand other burger joints out there do I keep coming back to you? I'm ashamed of myself. But not really.

And at this point, I'm not sure if it's me or you. Whatever the case, we both know I'll be back.",otJymEX3LsMyS3BMn0ROdQ,0,1,4,iQ-Z6mCadWsAele2ffo0kg

Always packed both inside and at the drive-thru, but the workers are always super friendly and the food is always consistently good, fast to come out and perfectly assembled.  Burgers are amazing, fries are delicious (and definitely fresh cut), and milkshakes are da bomb! You also can't beat the prices!!!  Definitely our go-to burger joint!  I don't think I'll ever be able to live in a town that doesn't have an In-N-Out ever again!  It's that serious.",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,0,0,5,KE6JX00A12JykbzKGURTBA
