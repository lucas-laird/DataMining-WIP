I called the dealer and the quoted me $600+ to change the alternator, I called MVR and was quoted $360. Once I brought my car in to MVR I was asked if I wanted to use my own alternator, he gave me the price just for labor and it wound up saving me close to $100 and that was even with an oil change on top of it.

They guy at the counter told me my front brakes and rotors were completely gone and that the rotors had such bad grooves they couldn't be repaired. He said my back brakes and rotors also needed to be replaced and should have been done 40k miles ago and quoted me close to $700. I just bought this car from a guy that really maintained it so I found that hard to believe. I went to Mr. Brake where they told me I still had 15% of life left on my front brakes and 75% on my back brakes and my rotors were completely fine. The grinding noise was due to my front brakes being crystallized so I replaced them.

One of the things I noticed, with every customer they gave them the old parts. Even windshield wiper blades. Someone got an oil change and their blades changed, they had their old blades to show them. That is HUGE. Every single customer I saw in the 3 hours I sat in their waiting room was shown their old parts and their questions were answered. 

I also noticed that they had quite a few ""regulars"". After my experience, I can definitely see why. I would 100% recommend this shop. The only complaint I have is that they are not in California so I can use them when I need repairs.",OJGG1rzqPz0V5OY6giT2QQ,3,0,5,yZpV28aRVJLsfPdWrbl9mQ

Service:
My a/c stopped blowing cold air on my way to work two days ago. Mind you, it is the middle of summer AND I am a college student with limited time and a crazy schedule. I was looking for a shop nearby my house and... tada! There it was: MVR Auto Repair. It is owned and operated by Al who you will see in front with his tech Rony. This team works miracles! They did a thorough inspection to isolate the cause of my a/c problem and kept me informed every step of the way. He did not give me the run around nor did he try to persuade me to perform unnecessary work. Despite his busy shop, he managed to have me up and running the next day. They even worked after hours to have my car back to me as promise. 

Customer Service:
Being a young looking female, I've always had a hard time trusting auto repairs shops so I normally would bring a friend or my father. After reviewing a couple shops nearby and not wanting to drive across town for a different shop, I decided to check this place out especially since they are open on Saturdays. I wanted to find a local reputable shop on my own (I also did a little bit of price canvasing on my own, so I would know the estimated price it would cost). My first impression and experience with Al and Rony is nothing but stellar customer service. Rony greeted me as he was working in the shop and guided me to the front office space. Al prides himself in honesty and constant communication. You can tell these are genuine people that keep your best interest in mind. 

Overall:
If you are in the neighborhood or looking for a new shop, I definitely recommend this place. The prices are great and you can't beat doing business with genuine, honest, and knowledgeable people who will go out of their way to get you back on the road again.",oOzf7vYQq2C3f5fK1jeMPw,1,0,5,xZ3wA1NUFSkMiDu_J1vsIQ
