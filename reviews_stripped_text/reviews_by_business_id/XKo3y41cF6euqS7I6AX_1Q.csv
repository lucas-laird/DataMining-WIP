Asked for no rice and if I can have veggies instead. After telling me it was going to be 9.something I asked what the base price was. She responded with $7 and change (cant remember the exact amount). She said they were charging me for extra veggies. I let her know that I asked if I could sub Veggies for Rice, but if I was going to be charged extra then I would only do veggies, no rice, no extra veggies. She said that that's how she was trained to charged this type of order and it wouldn't be worth it to just do chicken and veggies. That's when I told her Id order somewhere else. I'm not a big fan of Teriyaki Madness buuuuuut, I'm calling them now. They've always catered to whatever we've ordered. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but with this service...no thanks. P.S.

I wasn't blown away, but for a ""teriyaki bowl"" restaurant, there's not much you can do to it to make me do back flips. The teriyaki sauce is decent, not too salty and had a good consistency.  Add some Sriracha and you'll be a happy camper.

Pros: I love the online ordering.  Though it was not ready when I got there, at least it was cooked fresh, the meat was tender, and the bowl was loaded.  I did not eat there, but the place is clean and the staff is friendly.
Cons: Just that I had to wait for my order when I placed it in advance.  Not a deal breaker.
Suggestion: Order extra chicken if you like your protein.  They give you a good size portion, but I eat more protein & veggies then I do rice, so I definitely needed a little more to make my belly happy.",gd-K4VtP9pmyRV6MspFxdQ,1,1,4,j57amSgIfwNEY6srlrQfmQ

The menu is big...almost too many choices I would say. 

I ordered the tofu nugget yaki soba. 

Pass on the tofu nugget.  It was kind of like soggy chicken nuggets with some grated carrots and edamame mixed into it. Not tasty at all.  Blah

But the rest of yaki soba was pretty good. Veggies were still crunchy and not overcooked.  The noodle had good texture.  

Minus one star for the soggy tofu nuggets....
Minus the second star for drowning the bowl in teriyaki sauce.  I get the healthy part because it was grilled but the drowning in the sauce kind of defeats the purpose of ""healthy"".

So we finally got a chance to try it. I ordered the firecracker chicken bowl. Do you love spice? Well I do and this definitely hit the spot! There is a lot on the menu so I had to ask and the guy recommended it. He even asked if I wanted it medium or hot..I said hot!!! It came with brown rice, veggies and really good chicken tossed in spicy, sweet chili sauce. Only suggestion is maybe to put the sauce on the veggies too, they were a bit bland compared to the entire meal but still yum!!!My son tried the Korean steak bowl and I am assuming he loved it because he ate it all up without me having to tell him to finish it. Haha!

The chicken bowl was chicken breast grilled/baked on top of rice. Without the sweet sauce they provided, this tastes like cardboard. Meat is very dry and not seasoned well.

The yakisoba bowl or maybe Chowmein was edible, however not at restaurant level either.

This is probably the worst food I have ever eaten in my life. Although we had a great time eating it since we ate it by the pool at Mandalay Bay. :D",O4gCYmCCE4Fxw4pBqJku5g,0,0,1,U12-wWJqTSm97yrWtpwDdQ

Visit #1: Ordered the $3.99 Teriyaki Bowl ""special"". (See photos) Rice portion size was fair, but meat portion was a straight up joke! The thing is, what I did have tasted very good! Chicken was tender and tasty..that is, the 4 or 5 bite portion I was served..

Ok, I think, I will try again..

Visit #2: Try the large Teriyaki Chicken Bowl with no Veggies. For $7 and change, the portion size is very good....for the rice...the meat was ok...but...chock FULL of veggies..

A) I ordered no veggies
B) I tried to eat the veggies and they were stiff and tasted terrible! If they were steamed/cooked them for a little while longer than I wouldn't have minded it so much...but it was just terrible trying to finish eating them!

Strike Two.

Visit #3: Ordered Same item as visit #2, but tipped Girl $2 and asked Girl to PLEASE not include veggies.

Again, what meat I got tasted really good. Tender and juicy. Just not nearly enough of it! This time the rice was so stiff and stale I could not finish it. In fact, I tossed it out.

That's it. I tried. I am officially done with Teriyaki Boy.

What a letdown.

This location is clean and looks like they keep up with the maintenance. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was that the customer service wasn't as friendly as I like. 

I got the firecracker chicken which was really good! The right amount of spice and sweetness. I wouldn't recommend if you don't like spicy food. I got it on top of mixed white and brown rice. My boyfriend got the Big Boy bowl. He at most of it so I'm assuming it was good. We also shared the crab puffs as an appetizer. Two things I liked were that I saw them cutting up real chicken breasts in the back and the crab puffs weren't fried. The flavors of the sauces were excellent! Food came out quick and hot.

The fiance LOVES the Hawaiian place next door, but they have NO vegetarian options, so I thought I'd try this place. I'd never been there, so I let the cashier know I'd need a minute. I was the only one in line. When he could clearly tell I was attempting to get his attention, he walked right in front of me, picked up a napkin, not making eye contact, and walked back to the kitchen. Finally he comes up and answers my questions as rude and degrading as possible, with a blatant attitude of ""&#%$ you"". Once the food was ready he came over with the bag, and instead of handing it to me, holds it two inches off the empty table in font of me,  and drops it, then proceeds to roll his eyes, without saying a word, and walks away. I was shocked. 
I ordered a side of steamed veggies, which were AWESOME!!  Cooked with just the right amount of crispness and tasted very fresh. That is the ONLY reason for 2 stars.",PTfIcx4u7-VaDRaGp0mAdQ,4,0,2,cHrVWm8gASGa1HUIRpo78Q

Ordered 3 different bowls from Teriyaki Boy, korean beef, chicken and steak and lastly a salad.  Prices were excellent and definitely worth a try, if I'm back for work to the area I'll surely try it again.  

Steak wasn't of the best cut but I wasn't expecting premium pieces.  Ordering white meat chicken was definitely worth the extra .30 cents.  Really well cooked and not dry which is a constant issue at grilled chicken quick food joints.  

Would have given 5 stars had the bowls had a few more veggies.  Both our bowls had cabbage and cucumbers.  no carrots or broccoli.  Would have preferred a little more variety and a tad less rice.  Was pretty tasty either way.",KGye5DpNpguQNv_iaLia7Q,1,0,4,sUMXuAVQkA1sYL3y9ezs_A

I don't think I will ever come back here again being that teriyaki chicken is my favorite thing to eat and they pretty much messed it up.
