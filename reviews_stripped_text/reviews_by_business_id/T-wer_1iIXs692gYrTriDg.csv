The first time I came here was with my bf so we ordered the Nate Dogg, we both liked it. It was loaded with flavor mmmm....just thinking about it makes me want some. It's a definitely must try! As for the french fries, it was good but way too salty for me. My second visit was during a Food Truck Fest so I decided to get the beef tacos, it was good not the greatest. I do want to try their sweet dough that I've heard so much about, so I guess I'll be coming back here some time. 

Oh yeah you have to expect the long lines and wait during a Food truck Fest. People always complain about the long lines, so to avoid the long lines go to their main location spot when you can.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,1,3,UAvrf0BroNX7766B7OrwPQ
170848,2010-12-03,0,T-wer_1iIXs692gYrTriDg,"I was driving down Lake Mead with my Sister and Nephew and did a double take on this shiny Red Truck in front of Lee's Discount Liquor.  Well, I'm a sucker for trying new things and I was on a food truck high just having recently discovered Fuku Burger that past week....so, even though I was on my way to lunch I busted a U-ee and decided to have a taste. 

The operation is a one man show and the guy was nice enough.  So kudos to the humble service.  However, I can't speak too much about the food.  I was pretty disappointed.  Granted I had high hopes from the look of the truck and the overall concept of ""Fusion Food,"" the Korean and Mexican flavors didn't quite well...fuse.   I ordered the pork taco and well it tasted under seasoned and the tortilla was just tasteless.  I was hoping for more flavor from the meat and maybe even just a warm tortilla would've have done wonders to add something to this very sad cold taco.  I really didn't even finish it.

I feel bad giving such a bad review, but hey...it's my honest opinion and I wish Hanshik Taco all the best and perhaps he'll try and put some more pizzaz in his food.

The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the seasoning on the fries were pretty yummy.",6AtAFaMLtHp52aBEa8Jy-Q,10,4,2,onGp4qZL29svNBBPi4yxYA

It was a little annoying how the owner/cook kept name dropping the Lee family and telling how he was friends with them. He also made several obnoxious racial comments (ie: ""I'm an egg- yellow on the inside and white on the outside."") As a Korean American, I found this distasteful. The food was good enough, but if you go, have a sense of humor about the commentary.

Also, the owner of this business is painstakingly flaming/making personal attacks against anyone who leaves a less than perfect review of his establishment.

365648,2011-02-18,2,T-wer_1iIXs692gYrTriDg,"Who knew that Korean food and a tortilla could taste so good? Ok maybe a million people in LA did. Until a little Italian came along with a love for the cuisine and cooking planted roots in a Lee's Discount Liquor parking lot, we were missing out. Before opening shop Ron (the owner) out of respect for the food and the people sought approval from the Korean community before even opening shop and they happily accepted the dishing from his kitchen. Now that's respect baby.

With that said let me tell you that this is some good stuff and when you go you'll be hooked. What I love about it is that you can tell that the meat is properly marinated, there are layers of flavors and everything is properly seasoned. The amount of filling is perfect and the price is so so right. We almost feel guilty paying so little for something so good and so satisfying.  And come back often because Ron gets a little crazy and busts out something special that's seasonal that'll take your taste buds to another level.",r24oTVLC3Tlv4OC4YCnLUQ,3,1,4,hSLuVcfjGmvkFifQKmG7VQ

Nate dog ($3) - the bun was a cheap crappy bun u can buy from the grocery store. the hot dog itself was super small and all it really had on it was seasoned cabbage. 

chicken and beef tacos(2/$5) - honestly i couldn't even tell the difference between each meat. the cook said that one would taste spicy and the other would taste sweet. but they looked EXACTLY the same. same ingredients and same taste. 

""not so "" fries ($1.16) - frozen fries tossed w. spices...not great spices. the serving was so small! he put it on the same plate as my small hot dog. it looked like it was a side serving, not an individual serving. the fries i could have just made at home by buying frozen fries and getting spices from the Korean market. 

the cook, probably owner, was saying how ppl don't come to eat because they're scared of trying something new..but now i know its because THE FOOD SUCKS! not worth the money...you could make it at home easy. 

the only way this food could taste good is if you've NEVER IN YOUR LIFE tasted Asian food before. even if you've eaten Panda Express your palate would be too advance for this place.

947100,2011-03-15,0,T-wer_1iIXs692gYrTriDg,"It seems I've been hearing nothing but great things about food trucks lately.  The inception and subsequent success of Kogi BBQ in L.A. a couple of years ago incited a food revolution like no other.  Suddenly, mobile restaurants started to appear one by one, not only in the City of Angels, but major metros across America.  I'm glad to have been witness to the shift in the food paradigm and I'm equally as glad to been a part of the experience at Hanshiktaco.

Crammed in the corner of the Lee's Discount Liquor parking lot, Hanshiktaco, although inconspicuous, delivers on so many levels.   Firstly, the food is outstanding.  Hunger was an egregious understatement at this point in time, so I ordered both a beef taco and the ""Nate"" dog.  I found that the meat in the taco was laden with a smooth, yet unexpectedly spicy marinade which makes all of the difference in my opinion.  The soft tortilla the meat was sprinkled in made a perfect pairing.   The ""Nate"" dog was very good, but I wouldn't declare it the best dog in Vegas like many others have suggested.  I respectfully give that distinction to Great Links on Craig/Jones.

On to the service.....impeccable.  Ron made us feel like we've known him for years and also allowed us to try a free order of his Crazy's Sweet Dough, which was similarly tasty.   He also asked us to return for 2nd Sundays, which typically feature other food trucks in the area such as Sloppi Jo's, Snow Ono Shaved Ice and the Slider Truck to name a few.  Ruefully, I was unable to return as that was our last day in Vegas, but I will be certain to make the trek back when we return to visit our family again, which is very often.",acIm1t76GjS63KxT0c2G2g,1,1,4,2jYPU_aPxl83o5wprkmcDA

As Ron was working on my order, Kenny Lee walked up into the truck, placed him order and chatted for a little bit as well. He was having a burrito. He was telling me how addicting they were.

I finally made the trip across town to check out HanshikTaco and wonder why I didn't try it sooner

Today I had the ""Nate"" dog and the Chicken taco.  Both were spot on delicious.  

The chicken taco -  Has really nice heat, maybe too hot for some, but nothing out of control.  The crunch from the kimchi adds excellent texture.  For those who aren't familiar with korean flavors, gochujang (red pepper paste) is used in many dishes, and has nice notes of salt, heat, and almost a garlic taste.  The kimchi (cabbage) used at Hanshik is  a mild and balanced approach to what can sometimes be quite sour.  

The ""Nate"" dog - The best hot dog I've had in Vegas!  No, this is not the Chicago dog some of you may know.  This delectable treat features many of the same flavors found in the tacos.  It was cooked perfectly, and featured that crisp snap that all the best hot dogs have.  

The owner, whose name I forget, but am dubbing Onyoung Money, is a solid guy.  We spoke for a while, and it became obvious that this is someone who takes a lot of pride in his product.  Onyoung Money is a 5 star guy, running a seriously spectacular joint on wheels.

1216420,2010-08-28,0,T-wer_1iIXs692gYrTriDg,"Hanshiktaco is now one of my regular lunch spots. It seems like the Slider Truck (which I love) is never near me, so I was happy when I heard about Hanshiktaco being parked at Lee's Discount Liquor on Lake Mead/Tenaya. 

The tacos are comprised of simple flavors that, when layered, become quite tasty. The meat (I had chicken and pork) is lightly seasoned and is cut, or maybe shaved, in very small  pieces. The kimchee is slightly spicy, but also sour.

The chef used flour tortillas. I was dismayed at first because corn is my favorite, but unlike other reviewers my tortilla was soft and warm. I think it was grilled because it was crispy in places. 

Sure, a trip to Del Taco or Taco Bell would be cheaper, but ew! Why go there when you can have real food? 2 tacos for $4 something is more than enough food for lunch, and I think the price is very reasonable. 

If you are heading west on Lake Mead, it may be difficult to get to the truck because you have to swing a u-turn and take an immediate right to get into the parking lot. Approaching from the east is a lot easier.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,3,2,5,0FWVYp0Q68ApldliiA4mrg

Pretty Cool Themed Truck/Trailer and Owner was delightful and Convincing as he briefly explained his inspirations for his creations of Korean Fusion Tacos and such..

Here is what I got roughly an HOUR after I placed my order:

Pork Taco & Beef Taco

Both the tacos had their version of korean inspired kimchee/saurkraut spiced with a twist. UUmmm.... Okay, I'm always up for new takes on food. First off, there wasn't much meat in either of the tacos and the tortilla made them look even more skimpy (especially for the price). Secondly, the beef was very bland, pretty chewy (not in a good way) and all I could really taste was spicy/heat?! Where's the flavor? Pretty much the same with the pork.. except it was a little juicier with a bit of flavor?! I couldn't comprehend what they were trying to accomplish here..

El Korean ""Nate"" Dog

This looked interesting but wasn't much different in regards to its flavor profile compared to the Tacos. The hot dog tasted like a regular hot dog and bun was no different. The only slight upside to this was the texture from the same kimchee/saurkraut thing that accompanied the tacos.  

Disregarding the horrendous wait (which was the dagger), the bang for the buck, and the slight edge the hot dog had over the tacos, I cannot give this place much justice. Sorry",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,16,8,1,sMnFwmPeudSRbTn-yGVKAQ

After hearing about the Nate Dog, it clearly became what I was jonesing for. As a side, I opted for the sweet dough.

The hot dog was good, it just wasn't great. It's skinny and the toppings are far from plentiful. But the flavor is there and it's cooked well. I think if it had a better quality bun, I would have enjoyed it more.

The sweet dough was yummy, but nothing that left me craving for more. It was just average.

I am anxious to try out the tacos and fries, though, so I will definitely be back. And everything else about the experience was great.

I've been here a few times and I'm a big fan of the fries, the pork taco, and the Nate dog.  Everything has a good, fresh flavor to it and if you need to make it spicy, the siracha is right there!  The Nate dog is already pretty spicy, though.

Plus he's been great about hosting food truck events in the parking lot, promoting other food trucks that may or may not be lesser known.  He's not afraid of a little competition. :) From talking to him, I think he's worked out the kinks in his service system when big groups show up for the food truck events.  Basically, you'll just wait in line long but get your food faster, like how Slider Truck operates.  Ever notice how the order guy for Slider Truck disappears for a while each time after taking an order?  He's managing the tickets so the nice gentlemen cooking the food don't get slammed.  Hopefully now that Ron is wise to that technique, things will go more smoothly when the crowds show up.  It's great that he's flexible and willing to learn and experiment with both the food and the service.

Tacos: They're $3.00 each, but are $5.00 for two (including tax), so we bought a beef taco and a pork taco just to sample. Both tacos came in a small flour tortilla, dressed with kimchi (which resembled sauerkraut ,and was pretty bland), lettuce and cilantro. It was difficult to differentiate the two meats; they tasted pretty much the same, and were overly sweet with a hint of spiciness, but really lacked any depth of flavor. I also felt that there was too much of the kimchi/lettuce and not enough meat.

Overall, the owner was friendly, and the food was fresh and cooked up quickly, so that's where the 2 stars are coming from. But unfortunately, I was not impressed with the tacos, as I felt there was nothing remotely ""Korean"" about them.",b7CwEKur07HjPr4D0msT0g,10,5,2,uzk1HQsVBP7iaJpfzpRmHQ

Both tacos came with lettuce and a kimchee slaw that wasn't too overpowering or spicy, but added just enough kick to make the taco the most unique flavor combinations in a taco I've ever had (including the Bombay Tacos from Yayos which are curry-based). I felt that it needed a bit of sauce so I added some sriracha and it added just the right ""oomph"" I was looking for. 

We got the garlic and asian fries, both of which were very addictive. I love my side dishes and will often make a meal out of side dishes and appetizers, but to pair with the tacos was a little out of reach for me. Not that they weren't tasty, fries and tacos just didn't mesh as a meal together for me. Didn't stop me from eating them, however. Like I said, very, very addictive. And as always, the sweet, fried dough was delicious and crispy as always. Those are pretty much a never fail.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,3,4,4,cpX6rUNY-RXpsyKjSNzMqg

This place was a random stop after checking out the liquor store for a Christmas gift. Ita cute and loud (music) with coolers as chairs--just like back home when we would party on the beach. The menu is simple: tacos, hot dog, sides and fried dough. We ordered a chicken taco, fries, hot dogs and sweet dough. To be honest, it's all good. The texture of the dogs are awesome, as are the tacos. Great flavors, great combo of the whole Korean spices with hot dogs and tacos. Overall, I'd eat there again for sure. 

I hope that they continue to serve what they have now. Fried dough is a great way to cool off the palette from the spicy flavors, so order a basket. Great experience!",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,2,4,Qqn9tSUr8e60TMEwnvCB8Q

I've been wanting to try this place for ages, but every time I went by they were closed. Sad face!
I finally figured out when they were going to be open and zipped on down to try out the ""controversial"" tacos myself.
Contrary to some of the reviews, these tacos were DELICIOUS. I tried both the chicken and the pork taco, along with the fries.
The chicken taco was the spicier of the two, but that pork taco was no slouch either! The fries were perfectly crispy and  slightly spicy. Two tacos and fries came up to 8 bucks, which is slightly (by a few quarters) higher than what's listed on the site, so if you tend to not carry too much cash on you, remember that. 2 tacos were $5, and the fries were $2. All in all pretty cheap.

Had all four tacos that were offered today, which were chicken, beef, pork and tofu with egg. 

Overall the tacos were okay, all the tacos have kimchi, so expect a bit of a crunch and a little spice, would of been better if the the tortilla was warmer and soft. The tacos were $2.50, and just a bit bigger than a 99 cent taco from Del Taco, if it was somewhere like $1.50 a piece, I would certainly load up on them each order.

The fried dough was good, reminds me donut holes that taste like funnel cake. 

The wait time may be a little long because it is a one man show and everything is cooked on the order.

The kimchi wasn't very flavorful, in fact I thought it was more like sauerkraut than kimchi.  The kimchi was also too overpowering, I couldn't taste the lettuce or cilantro, in fact, the only way I was able to tell pork, chicken, and beef was from its texture and color.  The only taco that had any flavor other than kimchi was the egg and tofu.

The food:
The fries and the sweet dough are solid.
The tacos are decent but not amazing.  Kogi in SoCal is better.  I think they needed a higher filling to tortilla ratio to begin with.  Also, $2.50 for a street taco is pretty damn high.
3-4 star.

The service:
This is why they have 2 stars.  Now, I went on a busy day (saturday lunch).  I arrived at 12:30.  ordered around 12:45.  I ate my tacos at like 2:00.  Seriously, what the hell?
Yes, i understand that it is a two man operation.  I understand the the taco trailer isn't the ideal kitchen.  However, it took over an hour to get 2 tacos and sweet dough.  There can be no excuse for this.  Look, normal taco trucks serve as many people as you had moving food at a much faster rate. Even the places that cook to order.

We got for ourselves, mom and grandma to share 4 pork tacos, 2 tofu&egg, 2 (not so) fries, and 2 crazy doughs. 

I'm going to be the first somewhat negative review, but seriously I came here excited for some ""Seoul"" Fusion tacos and it came up short. Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, ""bahn mi"" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). 

Even if I didn't have ""experience"" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the ""expert"" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a ""bowl"" instead of a taco. I think it needs a ""heavier"" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying ""I'm soo hungry"" in the car after we decided to skip ""lunch"" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. 

Fries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). 

I think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an ""event"" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed.

 I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them. I have to resurrect it myself by getting in my kitchen late tonight and doing up something Chef worthy. It might have been an off day for them and everyone can have that, but shit it made my seeming good day off. It wasn't their fault we chose to come at that day and time, but we expected something worth giving up my day for and that leaves me bitter as the kimchee.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,11,9,3,1tH87gb3t5AWin5Wt3S09w

The loot:
1 Tofu + Egg Taco
1 Chicken Taco
2 Beef Tacos
2 Pork Tacos
1 Garlic Fry
1 Asian Fry
1 Crazy's Sweet Dough
1 (Just for fun) Order of asian chicken wings

Total $20, cash only

My wife and I agreed that pork tacos were the best. Pork was well marinated, and tender. I liked the beef, it was charred just the right way, even though she didn't care much for it. Chicken was excellent. Just the right amount of asian ginger-based spice, some kimchi, and lots of fresh greens. Everything was cooked to order. Tofu taco was something i never tried before, so i can't compare it to any other place. It was good, although the main taste came from the kimchi and the spices (as expected).

Chicken wings were a little less spicy than I would like them to be, but they were tasty, and not greasy - actually a tad on the dryer side on the outside (still tender on the inside) come to think of it.

Fries were very good. They had the home made taste to them, and were cooked in tasty oil. The garlic fries could have used more garlic, but if you aren't a big fan of really garlic-y fries, you are bound to love the subtle flavor. Asian fries were great, with just enough zing to make them stand out from most other fast food places.

Crazy sweet dough (very much like donut holes) were surprisingly good. I expected them to be more soaked with oil, but was excited to find out that they were crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside - no oil drippings, and the taste was donuty (and not oily). The powdered sugar on top was just the right amount.

I was the only person in ""line"" so it took a little while for everything to come, ~15 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. Plus the weather cooperated - it was the high 70s and pleasant, instead of the 100-degree heat we have seen all week.

5199485,2010-07-19,12,T-wer_1iIXs692gYrTriDg,"The mere thought of them has had my tastebuds giddy for weeks. I love kimchi, and I love corn tortillas, so kimchi tacos seemed like a guaranteed culinary nirvana. Mix it up with tofu, and I was convinced someone had been listening to my prayers.

Alas, the kimchi tofu egg taco at Hanshik was a disappointment. I only had one taco, so I am giving them 3 stars as a benefit of the doubt. Sadly, the solo taco experience will probably prevent me from returning unless I hear of a tofu rework. 

What were the shortcomings of the taco? Well, there were primarily three:
1. The tortilla was not corn. It was a big, fat flour one. Props for providing generous tacos, but the flour tortilla was not warm and yummy. Perhaps corn does not go well with tofu? If not, then, I think a thinner, warmer perhaps even smaller flour tortilla would make a more delightful taco.
2. The kimchi was not kimpressive. It reminded me more of sauerkraut. Yes, the cabbage was fresh, but the seasoning was heavy on the sourness without the balance of the chili spice.
3. The tofu and egg mixture was not seasoned well, and thus, pretty much tasted like plain scrambled eggs. 

All of this combined for a taco that I think could use some improvement. As always, mad props for an inventive and passionate entrepreneur. Service was definitely nice and enthusiastic. 

I would say give one of the other tacos or the crazy dough a whirl.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,13,3,RmHFV9jqI4YA04lIQ9MTzw

 His crazy Korean/Taco truck looks really nice and clean inside and out,  and he and I had a fine conversation while I got a great meal for $5!   The ""not so"" French Fries were pretty rad too, but the star was the kimchee-laden Nathan's hot dog!   With a little Siracha, it rocks!  

I'm glad I finally stopped in here, although I wish I'd have not had to buy new tires to do it...  it's cash only, which is the only other problem.  But at these prices, you can afford it with change in your car!",5tFUXNnFh7g1V2waWvQfbA,4,3,4,XbDAeDhnvJiuk75ap3hVbw

Was going to buy some wine at Lee's and my friend pointed to Hanshiktaco...it was dark, no lights and I didn't want her to walk there alone...so cut to the chase...Ron the owner is a very cool guy, food very good for the price and kudo's to the Lee family for letting him be there...its places like this that give Vegas its cool vibe....shame on you people giving him one or two stars....",zvoDcHLURhJpHDIItLlJxQ,1,0,4,9-vCuSBNOs2UY4EQS16Vng

My husband was driving past it one day and decided to stop best thing he could have ever done!!!!!! He kept raving about these ""Korean tacos"" for a week before I finally broke down and said lets go try it. WOW is all I have to say we started with their Nate dog and not so French fries. I have had everything on their menu, and look forward to their specialty tacos that change every two weeks. All I can say about Ron's (owner/chef) creations is ammmmmaaaaazzziinngggg!!!!! He's always coming up with different yet delicious treats! Sometimes i'm skeptical to try like his Persian, but in the end it is always a blend of flavors that I end up craving all week long! He's extremely customer friendly and you can always tell when someone is truly proud and happy with his work. If I were him I would too!!!!! My Husband even participated in his Nate dog eating contest swore he could never eat one again but after a week started craving the deliciousness that is the Nate dog!!! Definitely a hidden gem we HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you stop and try this place, we drive across town most of the time just to eat here. Do not listen to the negative comments below, its not meant to be ""traditional"" Korean. Come here with an open mind and leave with a very very happy belly!!",cxjTyQwZoRETvxjH7ojjKA,1,1,5,6L3xiUUXHVjDZXr1PXmHhA

Guy working was cool and friendly, had RUN DMC playing I thought that was a nice throwback.  Anyway, had a ""Nate Dog""  a pork taco and the sweet balls.  Nate wasn't really my thing, was a grilled hot dog with mayo-ish sauce, and I am not much of a mayo fan.  However I thought the pork taco was REALLY good, somewhat spicy but very meaty and fresh.  And the balls, well, they were good too - served very hot with a sweet sauce. 

I suppose it is worth trying if you are into this kind of food.  I'd probably eat there again but these comments about cheap food - no.  It was $2.50 a taco.  For me ""cheap"" is Del Taco and a 59c taco which is basically across the street.  Yes Mr. Hanshishtaco if you read these, your pork taco was better than any taco at Del Taco but I would guess most guys especially, to fill up at this place, you are looking at $10 easy.",fMfOeUAMvmRigE78zhPluA,1,0,4,Rnop5MJdQubqierxs4_yZg

The chicken taco is spicy and the kimchi adds a good bit of savory, sour taste. But the nate dog was awesome! it has a different spiciness to it, and the spicy mayo was bomb! dont eat it if youre on a diet though!! :D",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,3,4,5,F_RJPE7nakVScLPr3HHchQ
5973631,2011-04-21,9,T-wer_1iIXs692gYrTriDg,"Disclaimer: I used to work in LA where my lunch options were a line of lunch trucks everyday. I ate from the famous Kogi truck and the other copycats at least once a week. So this review might be a bit skewed because I already have a set expectation of what I want it to taste like. 

I ordered the pork taco and tofu & egg taco, along with a side of fries. I didn't see an option to order the famous garlic fries that everyone was raving about though. But, it's all good- I was there for the tacos. 

There were quite a few people in front of me but I didn't mind because I just made my way over to the Snow Ono truck parked next door. Plus, they had some great oldies playing- kriss kross (jump, jump) and sublime. 

Okay- onto the food.  2.5 stars.
*The seasoning on the fries was nice, but the fries themselves didn't taste fresh.  
*The pork taco had a nice flavor, as did the egg & tofu, but I was disappointed with the kimchi.  I appreciated the texture, but was hoping for more of that kimchi kick.
*I am also used to a soft corn tortilla- and these were enveloped by a hard, chewy flour tortilla. 

Regardless, I ate the entire thing and will probably return because it is definitely tastier than any fast food joint.  It is right around the corner from where I live so if I see a short line- I will definitely give the Nate dog and Sweet dough a try, with hopes to update this review.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,21,14,2,Wl6RZZOkecv51qxx6a2pEg
