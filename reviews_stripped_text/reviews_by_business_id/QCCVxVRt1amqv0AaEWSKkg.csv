A huge elevation to the real Vegas food scene (i.e. not overpriced, underperforming Strip outposts of actually good restaurants). Not pretentious, reasonably priced and perfectly prepared. As good, if not better than Scarpetta, but without having to go to the Strip or go broke. Plus, a chef who cares enough about the food to be in the dining room.",igD4EvQWAcYIElbEjVXljA,4,2,5,O31ZTKyNYPyWZauDcMOknA

Once seated it took awhile to get waited on. Service did improve slightly but could really need some work. The bathrooms need improving too. Not dirty just not nice. 

For the food we ordered:

Meatballs (2 per order....not 3 like the pics) not bad not outstanding 

Zucca flowers: Squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and fried. EXCELLENT!

Sourdough bread w/oil & butter: crust was burnt beyond a normal char making most of it uneatable but the inside of the bread was good

Bucatini all'amatriciana: perfect amount of spice and perfectly cooked

Agnolotti: could have used a little more squash but still was delicious 

Spaghetti: had a lot of whole garlic cloves in it. The only thing that saved the dish is that they were whole & could be picked out to not make garlic over power everything. 

Overall a pretty good meal for a decent price. We will be back to try again.",8Ox2EA8A7FVSzVEM3TRn7Q,2,4,4,LWvpLD0Oa4vV7OdnCiWAuA

1249409,2018-06-11,0,QCCVxVRt1amqv0AaEWSKkg,"Eating at esters is like eating at a friend's house. It's a comfortable atmosphere and the service is casual but thoughtful. When we were at the bar my husband ordered a gin martini and they didn't have pickled onions, instead they brought him a selection of house made pickled items that they did have available. It set the tone for the whole evening. Our server I feel bad I can't remember his name, also had a casual friendly vibe. It was a date night and we did not want to be rushed and he timed our courses perfectly. We did the homemade bread with burrata and basil oil which was so so yummy. We enjoyed the grilled octopus and yellowtail Crudo as starters. I'm always a little nervous ordering octopus because it's one of those really good or really bad food items. Theirs was delicious! It was smokey and grilled to perfection but most importantly very very tender. The tuna Crudo i loved. The fennel, the pickled cherries, the pistachios, they all paired together beautifully. For mains we had the bucatini and agnolotti. The bucatini was cooked the perfect al dente and the sauce was delicious. It tasted like it was slow cooked with love for hours. I loved the mint and lemon ricotta in the agnolotti. It was bright fresh and delicious.  For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake and the butterscotch pudding, which the pudding is more like a silky creme anglaise and just melts in your mouth it was so good. At the end of the evening we noticed the chef going around welcoming all the tables talking to them getting feedback and sure enough we got an opportunity to talk to him and we even shared a drink together. It was awesome hearing his story and it was so clear his passion for his community and what he does. And we wish him all the best of luck and cannot wait to eat there again and try new things.",PIbmLU3JCmgyTdJoJGQbrw,0,0,5,oYa6LMZ7QG004uwUNVuvsg

At Esther's Kitchen, Keith our insightful bartender was happy to mix me a non alcoholic ginger cocktail with chamomile trimmings. We ordered the housemade sourdough and burrata. Holy - tomolely it was a loaf of bread that was warm and so delicious. Then we shared some Spaghetti Squash and the Mushroom with Polenta from the Verduras section of the menu. It was a perfect supper for a cool Las Vegas night. 

We watched as the pizza and handmade pasta left the kitchen to fill other tables, wishing we had room in our bellies to order. It looked so good. We will be back. If not this trip then next.

Chef James Trees shares his heart and soul with us through his incredibly delicious, thoughtful, and beautiful dishes. His restaurant is a friendly neighborhood place where you are likely to run into people you know. Service is warm and attentive. Craig, the manager, is very welcoming, kind, and professional. The Chef took the time to visit the tables and talk with his guests. Everyone worked in harmony to make our dinner with friends very special. 

The bread is spectacular, as is the house made burrata and butters. The polenta is comfort food at its best- I had it last night, and I am craving it again already! The pastas are heaven. Parsnip risotto, and spaghetti squash with pomegranate, mint, & ricotta salata are thoughtful and delicious. The chicken is wonderful, and the porchetta is absolute perfection- crispy skin, tender, juicy, and full of flavor. All of these dishes (except the bread and pasta) accommodate gluten free diners, too! The cocktails are well-crafted, and the wine and beer list has some tasty gems, and is refreshingly affordable.

Only small disappointment was the chicken parm sandwich. The chicken was tasty, but the bread was a very dense, dry roll (maybe potato bread?) which was a bummer bc the meatball sammy had a nice roll and we saw some bread /oil appetizers that also looked like special bread. Even dipping the roll in carbonara sauce didn't fully salvage it. Also, we were expecting whipped burrata on it and what we had tasted like regular mozz (tasted good). That said, we take our parms seriously, so perhaps someone else would be good with it.

The woman loves food and says it very well may have been the best meal of her life. Each course was better than the last. We started with the burrata and cultured butter with fresh bread -- just those alone were worthy of plate licking. The polenta with mushrooms and truffle butter -- if you get nothing else, order this. Amazing. All their pasta is fresh and house made. The cacio e pepe was better than what we ate in Tuscany. And oh my Lord, the desserts! We shared the butterscotch custard, chocolate torte and buttermilk panacotta -- each unworldly. To top it off, the chef came out to chat and was kind and welcoming.

1694603,2018-02-05,13,QCCVxVRt1amqv0AaEWSKkg,"Seriously underwhelmed. 

Locals have been aching for this joint to open, what with the hype, pomp, and circumstance lasting for months, if not a year now. It seems like forever. And with the disappointing closure of Rock'n'oodles (a superb, diverse, and affordable pasta place) around the corner, people have been burning for a business to fulfill the need.

Esther's doesn't cut it. Not on this venture. For one, it's pricey. Which is fine, but if you're going to do your part to gentrify the Arts' District of all places, the quality had best be there. It's not. My dining companion and I each had a glass of wine at $10 a pop, no matter which you select; this model I like, but that's about it. We shared the Weiser's Parsnip Risotto, the squash agnolotti, and for dessert the butterscoth budino. 

In short order:
The risotto was the best of the batch with its artful parsnip adornment, but at $16 for a vegetable plate, it's pushing its luck. 
The squash agnolotti was the prime disappointment. We love pasta, but the flavor wasn't there. There was nothing exciting about it, and once again, I can do better at home. The squash was diced small, so barely recognizable as such. The quantity, or lack thereof, made both of our eyes pop when the plate was presented. $21? You're paying for the IDEA that Esther's Kitchen is high-end dining. 
The butterscotch budino was tasty, but once again, lacking in quantity. It barely filled 1/4 of the glass it came in. Truly, our glass was half empty. Sad. 
$70+ for that night, and for showing an out-of-towner a restaurant people have been excited about forever. Meh. 

So yeah, I've experienced better, and for a whole lot less moolah. At these prices, and that quality, I won't be back.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,14,5,2,q41CxON1DocrAFAdSMrE2g

The ambiance is chill and upscale at the same time,  and the bartenders were super friendly and accommodating.  They even made my friend a special mocktail to go with my cocktail because he doesn't drink.  

We ordered the charcuterie, which was nothing short of spectacular.  All the cheeses, all the meats,  that amazing rustic Italian bread and... wait for it...FOIS!  Delish!  And the carbonara was fantastic! I had to of course try the panna cotta for dessert and was not disappointed.

Our server, Patrick was fantastic.

The food was OMG awesome! We had the cauliflower appetizer which was seasoned perfectly and had a really nice light crunch to it. My husband ordered the house fish which he must have really enjoyed because it wasn't on his plate for very long. I had the white pizza. I was really surprised with the flavor.

We made a reservation and I'm glad we did.  The place was packed an hour into service.  Our server Zack was not only courteous and professional but he help us with our experience every step of the way.  

DRINKS: We ordered craft cocktails first which were amazing!  If you can't decide, I encourage you to order the ""dealers choice"" which is a drink of choice by the bartender on that particular day.

APPETIZERS: We had the fresh baked sourdough bread (it's a full loaf so don't get full) with cultured butter with olive oil, cracked pepper and sea salt.  We also had the perfectly cooked meatballs with a beautiful sauce with pesto on the bottom.

MAIN COURSE:  We had a white truffle oil pizza with leaks and fresh grated parm on top.  If you've never experienced a top quality white pie I suggest you try it.  We also had dish that had strips of lasagna pasta died with squid ink with huge chunks of lobster topped with a beautiful homemade marinara sauce.....WOW!!!!!!!!!!

DESSERT:  We had the amazingly delectable Butterscotch dessert with a caramel layer topping with a dollop of fresh whip cream sprinkled with some flavored sea salt.

Some establishments boast about being this type of restaurant but don't reach the mark.  Esther's is not trendy but real.  You can feel the love and dedication in the food....AND their menu is seasonal so you are always in for a high quality menu that changes with amazing produce in season.

I ordered the fish entree and water because i was nearly 9 months pregnant. Citris oil and fennel with these incredible potatoes and perfectly cooked fish. It was the only thing on the menu I could eat because I have an allergy. To butter milk and cheese. Like not poop your pants allergy, like every dr at southern hills hospital knows me allergy. Like I went out to eat and my throat is closing allergy. Like a dr telling you cant do this anymore allergy. So I was thrilled about this fish dish at the cute place that I could eat. So I made another reservation for last night for my other halfs birthday. Everyone ordered all these incredible dishes. The beets, the cauliflower, pasta, and I sat drinking a bubbly pino which was great patiently waiting for the fish dish. Well the waiter came back and said I couldnt hv it because there was butter in it and they couldnt mod. I told him that was the only thing I could eat last time. He said hed go back and ask. Back and forth they said okay well mod the fish and give you last weeks set up of the dish. Well maybe I upset the chef because the whole plate was burnt. The potatoes were burnt black and shriveled. The fish was burnt. The fennel was replaced with endives and were charred. It was almost inedible. But I politely ate the burnt fish and watched everyone else eat and drink. And our guests left and we stayed for dessert and digestif. Which our waiter brought us 3 drinks. One tasted and smelled of novacaine. When we brought this up to the waiter he compared it to a urinal cake. Confused as to why he would choose this for us as he thought it was that vulgar was off putting. The dessert was the third on the list topped w honeycomb. My boyfriend described it as root canal sweet and took 2 bites before we left mildly full and dissapointed after a 250 dollar bill. I understand kitchens not wanting to mod dishes. I get it. I hate being that person that cant eat anything. I hate being the complicated guest. But I also cant help that I have this allergy.

What is the point of making a reservation if we have to wait over 30 mins more for a table? Second, Esther's Kitchen has no condiments, at all. My friend wanted a side of ranch to dip her hard crusted pizza in and the waiter said that they do not offer any condiments, including ranch. Next, the portion size of the food (compared to the cost) is small. Everyone at my table left feeling hungry for more food because everything comes out small and we all ordered different items. We also purchased the bread, butter, oil combo and we were still left hungry. Lastly, they really push their handmade cocktails and wine. The waiter did not offer soda or tea (I really would have liked an unsweetened ice tea). 
On a positive note, the food was delicious! (The food saved their review) The food didn't take long to come out to the table. The ambiance of the restaurant was casual and pretty hip.

They clearly needed to change their pasta water.  For a restaurant that prides itself on home made pasta not being able to cook it right and season it seems like a major flaw.

You get a loaf of sourdough it's skin is a bit tough to cut through without the proper utensil. I didn't really care for it I have had better sourdough before. However the burrata alla panna was delicious! The yellowtail crudo was really good never had a sweet and savory herb mixture work so well on your pallet before! The herb fettuccini was my favorite dish, from the aldente fettuccine it's confi garlic, lemony flavors plus the clams just superb combo. This dish I wished I hadn't had to share. The margherita pizza was ok nothing worthy of mention. The Mary's chicken...well it was extremely tender which was the best part but it was just a tad bit too salty for me then you had radishes and snap peas that were a bit too sweet I wasn't too big of a fan for the flavors but loved the tenderness of the chicken. Excellent customer service from our server who by the way knew so much about each of the dishes I can tell the restaurant was big on food education because it certainly helped with choosing a dish. He always came by to ask if we were ok and food refill frequency on drinks. One star less only due to address confusion it's not on Casino Center Drive but really ok California had to drive around a few times to finally see it. Really I'd do a half star less but not possible. There is also outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant and I'm not sure they advertise that well enough to take advantage of the weather.

Seated promptly, restaurant nicely busy. Server greeted the table, offered drinks and explained the menu. It was loud (music) and difficult to hear him and/or discuss our selections. Drinks ordered and delivered in a reasonable time frame. So far, so good. We ordered:

Little Gem Caesar: Presentation-A, Portion-A-, Flavor ProfileA+, Overdressed, so overall B+

Cauliflower: A++++, the stand out of the meal

Stuffed Squash Blossoms: B-

Polenta: A for favor profile, Too much salt, overall, B-

Second Course:

Rigatoni:  Nice Portion, WAY TOO SATLY, C+, hint both the cheese and pork products you are using have a lot of salt. Sit down and eat a 1/3 of a portion. Salt builds on your palate. 

Mushroom Pizza: Sand out, A+, Crust delightful, toppings perfectly portioned and distributed. Flavors heavenly. 

Lobster Lasagne: Fail, Lobster was ""off"" Fishy in taste and smell. The black pasta was a weird texture. In fairness, we mentioned this to the server and it was removed from the check. Also TOO SALTY, Will try again.

Service: Spotty at best. Will not name the server, but he was inattentive and when he was there did not accommodate us. Asked for a second round of drinks. Failed to bring them until he was reminded, well after we had wanted them. That interrupts the flow of the table as we looked around for service instead of enjoying our meal and our conversation. Offered us new base plates after we had put food from our second course on them. Said he would bring our check, then wandered around for a while, chatted with other tables, and after 10 minutes deliver it. Just a mess. 

Wine List: Narrow, odd, need a few higher end options. We would have easily purchased a $100+++ bottle if it was available. 

Interior: Super nice. Love all the eclectic finishes, furnishings and little ouches. Lighting is top notch. 

Management: For a new restaurant, I would expect more ""table touching"". We were thanked by the manager on the way out, but where was he when we were having issues? I rarely saw him at any table or assisting any staff member. Could do more. 

Full disclosure: I work in the industry, management in Fine Dining for 25 years. 

Overall: I admire them for what they have accomplished so far. I expect they will grow. They've got this. Let's support local establishments who enhance our neighborhoods. Look forward to my next visit.",61Ut_cz0nEO9l5Ab0UdDFg,0,0,4,5qHLGFgD43rzBoxkZOrUgA

Well, it's the strip; crowded, noisy, chaotic, touristy, etc. My wife and I wanted to try something a little bit different so we took a cab to this place on a whim. It'd only been open about 2 months but the reviews were good so we rolled the dice (Vegas pun intended) and we're glad we did. 


The food was amazing. All the pasta is fresh made daily and was terrific. The mushroom polenta and ceasar salad we had for starters were also to die for. (Note: this is a real deal ceasar with actual anchovies so if that freaks you out, avoid this one)


The cocktails were unique and delicious and our server Patrick was friendly and knowledgeable. This place is worth the cab ride.",GhFuhim1tKwmSPUMXDOe4w,1,1,5,KOiLKysGlq_q59TBfF93HA
2323331,2018-05-09,1,QCCVxVRt1amqv0AaEWSKkg,"Final word after finally getting in and trying this place.  Went and got seated promptly with a reservation and the server, Juan was friendly and engaging.  The service was not the most attentive, but it was not bad at all.  The bread with burrata was tasty, nd the meatballs were very good.  Fresh tasting and clearly not frozen.  They were a decent size and came with two good hunks of bread (lot of bread at this meal).  The pastas were good as well.  The cavatelli was delicious although it was not very large at all.  My colleague had the rigatoni, which was about 50-75% more food than my plate, which was odd.  

The positives were that the food was good, the pasta was excellent and we were seated promptly with pretty good service.

The negatives were that this place is LOUD....and I mean LOUD LOUD LOUD.  We spent the entire night engaged in a light shout to talk to each other, and I am not kidding.  By the end, I had a headache and a sore throat.  Clearly there is only so much to be done with the acoustics in this place, but maybe changing the glass front to allow open windows or something, because the noise alone would dissuade me from returning.  Second, the disparity between portion size was really odd and significant.  I mean, really, the rigatoni was almost double the food from the cavatelli.  Third, the prices are steep.  I mean, yes, it is hand made and everything is very good and clearly attention is paid to it, and that has value.  However, a bowl of pasta should not be 21 dollars...certainly not for the size they give you.  At the end of the day, pasta is still just flour and water.  The price for 1 beer, 3 pasta dishes, 2 desserts, meatballs and bread with burrata was 107 I think (100 and something).  A little steep honestly.  Lastly, the panna cotta dessert just was not impressive.  A real mishmash of flavors, that did not really work that well together, with some over pronounced and others barely noticeable, and it was a cream rather than a firmer panna cotta.

Overall, the place serves pretty good food, and if you don't mind the hectic disorganized nature, the insanely loud environment, the slightly steep prices and the heavy plaid/neck beard hipster crowd, then it is a solid choice for pasta.  I would give it 3.5* overall, but since the food it legitimately well executed for the most part, I will round up.  Kudos again to the owner for reaching out after my first terribly abortive attempt to eat there and even offering to buy me a meal to try them out (which I declined).  Still a great gesture though.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,0,0,4,qg5vRDaaC6YeB9epbLyIJA

The drink menu is certainly the most eclectic I've come across in all of my foodie adventures, offering a couple of classics alongside an array of unique cocktails with liquors I've never heard of before. The appretivo spritz was suggested and enjoyed offering a refreshing mix of citrus and bubbles. My fellow diners and I tasted different vebduras as starters; the best two were the cauliflower and the mushrooms with fresh ground polenta. The cauliflower was lightly breaded and spiced, fried to perfection leaving the delicate cauliflower tender and juicy.  The mushrooms had such rich flavors and complimented the polenta beautifully. The entree I chose was the cavatelli with crispy sausage. The pasta was perfect, not too firm, not too tender. The sauce had such a variety of ingredients making it so flavorful with a hint of spice, and the crispy sausage just added to my enjoyment of the dish. There are no desserts listed on the menu, but desserts were offered. We tried each of them and hands down the butterscotch pudding was the best!

Portions are very generous and food is all fresh - you can see someone making the bread and the pasta in the back through a little window! I had the carbonara (not super traditional, but yummy) & my partner got the spicy sausage pasta which had a really good kick to it and a delicious tomato sauce.

The pasta i had was supposed to have bacon inside and where my portion only had one or two bits, one of my friends got the same thing and hers had way to much bacon and not enough of everything else. The lobster lasagna had good meat but the noodles themselves were a little lack luster, the carbonara a little eggy so instead of being lightly coated it was thick.

The atmosphere is high energy. Very loud to the point that it was difficult for our server to take our order. Forget about trying to have a conversation across the table.

We ordered the meatballs and the porchetta.
The meatballs come two to an order along with two slices of bread. The meatballs are made with a combination of beef and pork. My wife prefers all beef and said the meat was lacking flavor. 
The porchetta was delicious, tender and juicy from the roasted jus. The roasted whole garlic cloves just melt in your mouth. Under the pork were several pieces of broccoli which was the perfect complement.

Not many Yelp reviews mention the conversation difficulty. I wonder if this night had an overly energetic crowd.

So we proceeded to leave and a gentleman said he could set us up a table outside if we didn't mind. We accepted and appreciated him accommodating us. We ordered drinks, which i must say were very good the bartender did a great job on my perfect Manhattan. Needless to say we waited an hour and still no entrees, also no appetizers! Nothing had come out! They kept apologizing every 10 minutes. Finally we told them we'll pay for our drinks and go somewhere else, they actually were nice enough to comp the drinks, 2 rounds actually.

3332707,2018-02-12,0,QCCVxVRt1amqv0AaEWSKkg,"I think I might have found my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. Fresh, handmade pasta at this quality is pretty rare from what I've seen in the area. Esther's has about 6-8 pastas to choose from, all tasty and unique, fresh out the oven. Most are priced around $15 which is unbelievably affordable. Cocktail menu at $9 is cheap as are the beers at about $5, with many local options in bottle and draught. 

Esther's, as of this review, is a reservation must since they seem to not seat the entire dining room at once; perhaps based on not enough servers. Bar seating available with full menu which is nice. 

Our meal began with a Esther style sazerac which really hit the spot. The prosecco cocktail from the menu was tasty as well, with the sage hitting home. Next we had a Caesar salad and fresh bread. Salad was very nice with thick and long romaine. The bread was glorious. I usually get peeved when bread is not complimentary, but for $4 they give you an entire loaf, charred perfectly - really exceptional bread. For entrees we had the spicy spaghetti and the sausage pasta (not sure actual menu titles). Sausage was a true standout. Really full dish with a lot going on. The pasta, similar to a small gnocchi, was oh so fresh. A little undercooked which is perfect for fr shot made pasta. The spaghetti was good but nothing compared to the other dish. 

In the end we are a fantastic and filling dinner with two drinks for less than $75.   Esther's is the new must in terms of Italian off the strip.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,2,1,5,BzdRy3N85BLwWMwBYOiZIQ

For dinner, I had the herb fettuccine with vongole (clams out of the shell) with the lemon preserve. The hubby had the spaghetti with meatballs. You can definitely tell it is fresh pasta which makes all the difference. Both dishes were delicious. The fettuccine would be just as perfect with no protein or chicken. We both had cocktails.

Mushroom polenta - also delicious but a bit rich. 

Popette? (meatball appetizer) was tasty and great reheated.

Porchetta - only thing I wasn't thrilled about.  I expected the outer shell to be edible but it was too hard and chewy.    Is it supposed to be like that?  The pork on the inside was yummy though.

Lamb sausage and clam pizza pleased all.  It was surprisingly spicy.  For me the best part was the crust.  Excellent sourdough taste in that crust. Any of their pizzas will be incredible with that crust. 

Person who took my order was friendly.  Loved the cookbooks to skim at the front while waiting.  I took cell phone pics of a pickle recipe that looked 20 yrs old with lots handwritten notes.

The joint seemed way more mature and sophisticated than I, the girl raised on endless breadsticks and minty dessert chocolates... But in all seriousness, you can tell they actually put a lot of thought into each dish, including where the ingredients come from, which is great. Lots of local sources tapped.  Even the plates you eat off of were crafted in town! Super rad!

My party of five demolished a little bit of everything, tbh: meat & cheese board with toasted sourdough and burrata alla panna + basil oil for starters. I ordered the bucatini dish as my main plate, and then later, we shared the panna cotta for dessert. 

The bucatini all'amatraciana was the star of the show for me, however. The sauce alone was perfect. Great portion size as well. I'm the type that purposely saves a little to see if it passes the ultimate test: Does it taste good being reheated for lunch at work the next day? The answer is yes.

All in all, I highly recommend giving Esther's Kitchen a try if you're in the area!

Pro Tip: It seems to be the buzz around town right now (for good reason) so it's super busy, even on a random Tuesday night. I'd recommend making a reservation beforehand if it's more than just you and a friend. They couldn't seat a group of 5 on a whim one night, so they asked us to make a reservation for a later time.",ImnJ5KKaWWNjj1E9kEArmQ,2,2,5,fMTOgbqvvulHYDuwyReoxg

We ordered the sourdough bread as an appetizer, it came with a side of butter in olive oil. It was amazing, it was actually the highlight of our meal. The olive oil was so... olive-y. I decided to play it safe and order the carbonara since all the pictures of it on here looked great. For $17 it was kind of bland. When I order carbonara I usually switch out the peas for capers to add some saltiness, but when I asked if they were able to do that the waiter just said no. Why the 4 star rating, you ask? I liked the ambience and the freshness of the foodz. 

There was one thing I'll note, during our meal one of the waiters was getting berated right outside the entrance by his manager. It's glass, y'all. The front of the restaurant is glass, as in, WE CAN SEE. Poor ponytail dude. Some professionalism would've been nice on their part.",Rsez5iSKBDgkqt6yU62o2A,0,0,4,scxMxKFWHlAb_kpqWwdfzg

Fresh baked homemade bread (delish) with butter and burrata, all of our appetizers were well thought out in their flavor combinations - Yellow tail crudo- light, fresh and delicious. 

I had the Lasagnette Nero - outstanding! Huge chunks of lobster, perfectly made squid ink pasta with a little chewiness dressed in flavorful red sauce. I can still taste it! 

The Spaghetti with polpette. Again...outstanding. The flavor!!! So incredible.

My fave dessert: the butterscotch budino, though everything was fantastic, that budino won my heart. Next time I'm getting my own...I honestly can't share it and will have to stab anyone's hand who tries to eat mine. (And I usually share everything!)

Thanks to Chef James and the rest of the awesome chefs in the kitchen and staff for such a beautiful eating experience. I will be back...again and again. I haven't felt this passionate about wanting to return to a specific restaurant in a very long time.

3936864,2018-01-31,0,QCCVxVRt1amqv0AaEWSKkg,"Last minute decision and this won out.   
Arrived with no reservations (didn't think we'd need).   Party of 3 including a four year old.  Here are my thoughts/experience:
1) place is small. They can get a decent number of people in there...and there was!  We couldn't be seated for almost 2 hours.  The noise level was too much for my 4 yr old.  That was ok because the hostess offered us a table out front.  We took it and it was perfect!
2) food.  Had the sourdough bread, the cavatelli, the pasta with meatballs and a dish of spaghetti with just butter for the kid.  She doesn't like red sauce.  
The cavatelli was amazing!  The spaghetti with sauce and meatballs were equally amazing as it was with just butter.  The meatballs were sooo good, too!
Towards the end of the meal, my 4 yr old actually tried the spaghetti with the sauce and LOVED IT!  So much that we had to mix in her pasta with it! 

My complaints.   These are personal thoughts, so I didn't reduce the number of stars lol
-If you offer outside seating, invest in heaters and get the tables level.  Waitress poured glasses of water and it ran right off the table. Maybe try to put up a divider between business and edge of sidewalk?  Maybe a fence?
-the bread.  I don't like my bread to have a black/hard crust.  Would've been more enjoyable with an nice darkened crisp crust.  Just overdone in my book. 

Overall everything was great.  Will definitely be back!!",g-iuEllF--jRXfhcf1CZIg,0,0,5,t1ShigaQ-3vt97aKRf-CyQ

Four of us shared three pastas, two sandwiches, a Margherita pizza, and one dessert.  The two rigatoni dishes were excellent. The one with black garlic and lemon was something very different and delightful.  The sandwiches were great especially the roasted porchetta.

Esther's Service: Our server was great with suggestions for the table. He keept the water and wines fresh for our party of 7 throughout the night.  The kitchen got our food out timely throughout the night even with all their tables filled, fantastic.

Esther's cuisine: All the carbs are made fresh in house and wow could we tell.  I had the Rigatoni Carbonara and it was delicious.  That grana panada cheese and egg yolk are a great combo to match up with the Guanciale pork.  My ahh dood's Lasagnette nero was tasty, I love the truffle action and that dish brought it.  The Branzino fish was offered that night and it was prepped perfectly.  The preserved lemon that was in the herb fettucini was a taste I've never tried before and worked well.  We grabbed a side of meatballs/polpette for fun and they were yum and large enough to share.

Esther's Ambiance:  The clean Industrial look with plenty of wood throughout the room keeps it casually classy.  A black and white beach mural on the wall really pops and is visually pleasing.  The tables are close to each other but not too close as to take away from the intimacy.  The bar with the blue wall takes helps take care of drinkers and single diners.

The location is deep in the Arts district downtown and is a fine addition to the area. Reservations are highly recommended because the word is out already on how great this place is.  The price point and the quality of food and service is exactly what's making Vegas a foodie city: High quality food and service for around $25-$30 a person.

We ordered the meat and cheese platter. No one explained what the cheeses were, they were brought out staggered instead of at once, and the guy explained some of the meats but ""forgot"" what the other meats were and never came back. 

Then I ordered the spaghetti. In an Italian restaurant the spaghetti and meatball are my go to as they should be perfected. Meatball was alright, but the pasta was almost gross. It was gummy and sticky. Almost like it sat in the sauce for too long and was stuck together.

Going to dinner on a Saturday evening at 7:30 as a walk in is a BAD idea, unless you hope to get lucky enough to sit the bar which i did (thank goodness). My approach to the hostess for two seats was greeted with ""earliest seating available would be 9:45""...whoa! Seems this place is getting some serious play from the masses and its keeping their reso book filled, good for them! Sitting the bar you are able to be a bit more interactive with the service staff (which i like), and usually leads to a better experience to me personally. Our bar keep was nice enough, making me a mezcal cocktail from the menu that presented better than it tasted. It wasn't bad, i simply would say that it wasn't balanced. My entree was a no brainer, being the carbonara i starred at on Yelp through photos. My response when the dish was set in front of me was ""McDonald's Hamburger"". This of course means that the food served to you never looks like the photos presented. I dug into my dinner hoping that the flavor would overwhelm me and force my return time after time and it was ""Just ok"". My server/bar keep was nice enough but didn't seem overly friendly or interactive, so i felt like this time was a very ""basic"" dining experience. Was anything particularly bad or negative to justify a bad review? I would not say so, and is the reason for the 3 stars. But i also think i can get similar food from a chain restaurant, with underwhelming service, and not have to wait 2 1/2 hours for a seat in the dining room in plenty of other locations.

My friend chose this place and I was wanting more traditional Italian food so I wasn't that excited about eating here, aside from the cool vibe/decor, but dang, the food was excellent. We started with the Caesar salad, which was overdressed but realllly good. The dressing was a bit heavy on the anchovy flavor, so just know that. We also got the bread service with burratta spread and I would come back just to get that. Holy moly. I got Mary's Chicken as my entree, and it was interesting/different but excellent. It had a golden crispy salty skin and sauces that complemented it wonderfully. The other 3 people in my group all raved about it too. The restaurant is small but very popular and is probably very loud at all times. We were able to converse ok, but don't come here if you're looking for a quiet meal. We ended our dinner with pannacotta. I don't remember the exact description, the server just rattles them all off to you, but I think it was buttermilk pannacotta with strawberries, basil and maybe rhubarb. It's more like a slightly runny yogurt than a pannacotta, but if the texture doesn't get to you too bad, the flavors were incredible! Really impressed with this place, I highly recommend it--if you can handle the loudness.",frdBrneRqE_tW0HjBVav8g,0,0,4,zy3PXDhTcPXDIefhp4RwFQ

Food was really great Italian food, having trouble remembering names of dishes but pasta was cooked al dente and full of flavor and pizza with bacon and quail egg was divine.

I definitely recommend making reservations.  I arrived at 7:30 with reservations, the place was half-full and within 15 minutes there was a wait, so definitely make them if you can.  On to the food... 

Ever taste something so good you giggle a little?  That was the cauliflower.  I almost ordered bread to sop up the leftover oil and fried capers.  How do they say, it's ""lick your plate clean"" good?  Light breading, super crisp, soft in the middle and a pure flavor explosion!  The fried capers are a great touch.  

Me and my girlfriend shared two pasta dishes(the pasta is made fresh there); Cacio E Pepe and the Rigatoni Carbonara.  I didn't post pictures because there's plenty of them on here of both.  Cacio has always been one of my favorite pasta dishes because how simple and flavorful it is.  Main flavors are parmesan and fresh black pepper.  

The Carbonara was outstanding.  Carbonara has always been one of those pasta dishes that you can easily mess up, but they do right.  You can really taste all the ingredients down to the egg yolk,, but for me it was the guanciale that really sets this dish off; salty, smokey and super crisp.  

For dessert we had the panna cotta.  This was a super inventive version of panna cotta.  Fresh strawberries, cubes of pistachio cake, rhubarb and little dollops of some kind of basil oil.  I don't know if it was an oil or some kind of extract, but it was a great contrast to the sweet and creamy flavors. 

Can't say enough good things about this place.  I will definitely be back to try some more dishes.  It is a lively dining experience, a bit loud, but I enjoyed that.  I even loved the dishes they use.  The place is artsy meets rustic.

The service was also good.  I can't remember his name, but he was very friendly, attentive and was enthusiastic about the food which really helps with the experience.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,1,2,5,7r_579OpMRyxjURIoJQe5Q

After confirming business hours via Yelp my favorite unfiltered dame and I stopped by Esther's for some  grub around 4:30pm. The bartender was pretty uninviting attempting to persuade us to sit at the bar because the dining room allegedly wasn't available for thirty minutes. After a short debate we were seated at a table nearest the bar. Overall service 2/5 

The food however is without a doubt delicious af! We were extremely pleased with the menu and will certainly be back with hopes of welcoming, efficient service.

White Pie $16 Truffle cheese garlic panna, mushroom, cauliflower & white asparagus. The crust alone was satisfying to the last bite. The pizza is by far one of the better pies I've had! 5/5

House ground polenta $15 great presentation and taste great. The ""balsamic"" was not our fave to pair with dish but cleaned the plate! 

Chard Octopus $18 has a bold flavorful taste that I appreciated. Regrettably,  the squid was a tad bit tough to cut through!

Dessert|| The Budino $8 has a lot of potential but definitely needs a chill pill. The liquid like consistency was disappointing but the ingredients made this dish a hit!

We both love Italian food and Esther's Kitchen came highly recommended to us by the chef at Sparrow + Wolf.  We certainly couldn't ignore the word of a talented chef at a restaurant we'd just dined at and loved.  Even though it was a Wednesday night a little after 6PM, the dining room was packed and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  Thankfully, we had dinner reservations and were seated immediately.

We ordered a couple of appetizers to share, the Ricotta Gnudi ($15) and the Polpette (meatballs) ($11).  As I learned, the name of the dish ""Ricotta Gnudi"" is actually a bit redundant since gnudi by definition is a gnocchi-like dumpling made with ricotta.  Regardless of its name or definition   They were fluffy, light, ricotta pillows complimented nicely by beets and pistachio pesto.  The polpette were moist, juicy, and flavorful and served with a piquant red sauce.  For my entrée, I had the Bucatini alla Amatriciana ($16).  We were informed that all of the pasta was made fresh in house.  My bucatini, a pasta style that I had not previously tried, definitely had that taste and mouth feel of fresh pasta.  It was paired with a nicely seasoned, spicy, red sauce.  My dish was absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we shared a Budino (butterscotch pudding) ($8) and a glass of amaro ($9).  It was a sweet, but not overly sweet, ending to our meal.  Service was exceptional as we were made to feel like guests in someone's home.

If you've been, you understand.  A jovial dining room filled with guests enjoying simple but incredible food that speaks to tradition.  Homemade pastas, sauces, dishes that come from passion and love.  Esther's kitchen has it.  The trick, you need to know what to order.

Tip:  Bread is for mopping up left over pasta sauces (not to smear with butter or dunk in olive oil ahead of your meal).

Tip:  Pastas are NOT side dishes and should be eaten by themselves.

1.  Cacio e pepe -  1/3 classic Roman pastas.  Steaming hot, very al dente, handmade pasta, a bit of starchy cooking water, a copious amount of pecorino cheese and a load of fresh cracked pepper.  Sounds simple; it is and wow is it sublime.  Liquefied essence of aged pecorino. 

2.  Bucatini all'amatraciana - 2/3 classic Roman pastas.  Bucatini (think spaghetti with a hole in the middle), finished in a sauce of guanciale (cured pork jowls), its rendered fat, onions, a hit of chili flakes, and crushed sweet and acidic tomatoes.   Sublime.

3.  Carbonara - 3/3 classic roman pastas.  This isn't the faux carbonara made with cream and filled with ""stuff""  rather house made rigatoni tossed with guancale and its rendered fat, raw egg yolks and a handful of grana padano (hard cow's milk cheese from Emilia Romagna).  The residual heat of the pasta melts the cheese and partially cooks the egg yolk.  While the cheese isn't Roman, the resulting product taste correct; eggy, porky goodness.

Need meat?  If available, order the prochetta.  Think of a rolled up boneless pig roast.  Crispy skin on the outside, soft, tender, juicy pork on the inside.  Another roman classic that beckons you to pull it apart with your fingers and devour it while sipping a negroni. 

Simple wine program.  Food friendly offerings.  Some amaro (required digestif), and they do make a good negroni.  Great HH.  16:00 - 18:00 daily. All wines by the glass $5, $4 beer, $9 signature cocktails.

Service is a work in progress.  It will improve with time.

My friends and I started off with ordering some bread with the basil oil and what seemed like a really thick cheese that really took to the bread perfectly. Also the very juicy meatballs with basil ricotta, and the meat and cheese plate that had liver patte and stinky cheese. I mention those because I've never tried them and they were really good. Different but good. It didn't last long amongst five people. As we went to order our entrees the chef saw that our table was empty and sent us another bread on the house. Well worth the carb overload. After that we ordered our main dishes. Everyone got something different so we could really try most the menu.  And the portions however misleading in pictures are actually a good size. The lobster with squid ink pasta gives a generous amount of lobster which is rare in most restaurants. As for the pasta, it's all made in house and was my initial reason for wanting to go. Last but not least was the dessert. The panna cotta was full of different flavors that paired nicely leaving a lightly sweetened taste in you mouth. Nothing ordered was less than amazing. The staff was great here as well. From the door to the table and even the kitchen. Everyone was really working as a team.

Busy but not hectic at Lunch, the menu cutting back on Pastas, Appetizers and Entrees with Salads and Sandwiches served in their place, it was with Chef Trees busy in the kitchen and Baker Dylan making fresh Pasta in the prep room that six dishes were ordered in addition to one Dessert, the soundtrack overhead once again delighting with the likes of Led Zeppelin though the tempo and volume of song selections was slower and lower than at night.

Dining with one repeat customer plus two first-timers, the desire to order only novel items compromised slightly for the later, it was perhaps ten minutes after taking a seat that plates began to emerge from the kitchen, a Chicken Parm Sandwich quickly announcing that Chef Trees wasn't about to mail it in just because something can be found cheap at almost any 24/7 bar in town, the crispy fried Bird itself a fine rendition with light spicing but the real star a topping of Whipped Burrata and bright Tomato Sauce plus the toasty housemade Roll.

Sold out of Radiatorre after another busy night, the Lunch menu's only exclusive Pasta thus offered instead with Rigatoni, suffice it to say that those looking for something unique would be well-advised to invest $12 in a plate of Noodles topped in Lemon Cream and Garlic plus toasted Breadcrumbs, the Citrus adding levity one certainly won't find in Trees' textbook Carbonara though another good choice for those looking for something light is Esther's simple yet stunning Spaghetti available with or without two well-seasoned Meatballs.

Waiting a few extra minutes for the rest, a flooded four-top soon to be a reward for ordering too much for most, those who've not had an opportunity to taste Esther's limited-run Porchetta may wish to consider lunch as a good time to taste the same Meat in a more accessible format, the Roast Pork topped with crispy Skin and Bitter Rabe as good a Sandwich as one will find anywhere in DTLV while the Margherita Pizza represents another case of simple done right with good Mozz and crushed Tomatoes on housemade Sourdough Crust.

Further impressed by Taro and Sweet Potato Chips served with the Sandwiches, a few oily specimens only worth mentioning because everything else was so pristine, a lone ""flaw"" of counter-style ordering is that those unaware of Esther's unlisted Dessert Menu may miss out on the Butterscotch Budino loaded with Butter and deglazed with Scotch and that would be a damned shame because it puts other versions in Las Vegas to shame at a price that is a few bucks lower.

*****A 'surprise' sensation regardless of James Trees, his talent never in question but the likelihood of Las Vegans seeing the value in $15 plates of handmade Pasta originally worrisome given long-lines at Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory every day of the week, Esther's Kitchen may just be what The Arts District has been lacking all along and that is a Restaurant where the owner put his passion, skill and money on the line to do something personal and genuine.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,10,5,TN7KgApkiamqIkRhvAyfKw

Parking wasn't bad for being in Downtown LV. The place was packed so do make reservations. It felt like California, Portland and IKEA in one place - 2/3 of those places I do like.

Uni Toast:
Crusty bread grilled to that perfect crunch. The layers of flavor and different textures in your mouth are what makes this APPealing. The celery root balances the flavor of the uni. 4/5

Chitarra Cacio e Pepe:
This was what brought me here in the first place. Pasta with 2 basic ingredients: cheese and pepper. So simple, yet so satisfyingly delicious. Think mac and cheese for adults. No protein in this dish, just pure glory of carbs (and fat). Strings of melts cheese for every twist and pull of that fork. 5/5

Lasagnetta Nero:
Squid ink lasagnette in tomato, lemon and truffle sauce with lobster and fennel. This is a beautiful dish with vibrant colors and flavors just the same. Pretty generous with the lobster. If you like fresh flavors with a bit of tartness - this is for you. 5/5

Butterscotch Budino:
 Rich and thick budino with caramel on top sprinkled with honeycomb for a nice crunch. 4/5

The mushrooms, cauliflower, the bread and butter (a dangerous necessity), herb fettuccine, squash and scallop agnolotti. Best Caesar salad I've ever tried in this city and I was exited from the womb with a Caesar salad in hand. Literally had to be rolled out of the restaurant in a wheelbarrow.

Make a reservation!! They're on OpenTable too but it's a necessity. Plus all the red wine (ALL) is $10 a glass and $36 a bottle, I think white is cheaper. ALLA THEM.

We spent a few days as tourists in Las Vegas and got many tips and recommendations from foodie friends, Esther's Kitchen was by far our favorite meal of the trip (maybe our favorite meal of the year?). If you want details keep reading, otherwise just go and enjoy ;)

Atmosphere: We were a group of 4 adults and 2 toddlers and we were seated under the misters on the back patio, where it was nice and shaded and the little ones could walk around a bit since currently there is just one large table back there (awesome - that meant a relaxed meal for the adults and no rushing). Staff checked in with us at least every 15 minutes, bringing tons of water and were very sweet to the kiddos (and Vegas dining usually isn't 'kid friendly', so I was over the moon). Everyone chatted with us quite a bit - even gave us excellent tips for brunch the next day. Nothing makes a vacation feel more like a vacation than personal and friendly attention over a relaxed dinner. 

Food: We started with anchovy garlic butter and burrata with bread. Pretty much universal consensus this was going to be the highlight. Then the ricotta gnudi arrived, which we thought was going to be the real highlight (perfectly tender-and-chewy pasta with a melty creamy filling, beautiful beets). There was a seasonal salad with the ripest nectarines and a basil/lemony dark green leaf in it dressed with balsamic that was a perfect break from the bready start, just in time to prepare us for the squid ink infused pasta that proved you can go from ""this is the best"" to ""this is even better"". We served the small ones crispy cauliflower (think tempura done exactly right) and margarita pizza (also, perfection).  

Cocktails: We asked the staff to make recommendations and had three rounds (hey, it was vacation). I actually was drinking non-alcoholic mock-tails, and while typically a mocktail is nothing to write home about - these were special! I had something with a bit of the house-made sage syrup that was refreshing, and a muddled grapefruit and mint sparkling drink that I will be attempting to recreate for the rest of the summer. My husband requested ""something smokey"" which was delivered with bourbon, and he had ""something with gin"", which he says was the ideal summer drink. I can't recall what else was imbibed but we all would return for an extended cocktail hour, maybe without children, any time!

Neighborhood: I knew nothing about the Vegas 'arts district' - this is definitely the up-and-coming hipster neighborhood. Would love to see what else is happening here in the coming months, it's great to see a side of Vegas that is neither the strip nor surburban.",3WBdIM3wqSLI1DvEgvvoTw,0,1,5,1gTkeqtJms1PBYSWr_OZZw

Esther's definitely pumps out some tasty a$$ food!! 

Their pastas are extruded/ hand made. They use no more than 3/4 ingredients which means the pasta will talk for its self. 

I love that the place is small and open you can see the cooks kickin ass back there. 

Their cocktails and wine are  you won't be disappointed. I always go with the super Tuscan and the cacio e pepe.

We were running about 10 minutes late for our reservation and they still honored it when we called, which was excellent. After we got there, we realized that the wait for food was going to be substantial because the kitchen was hopping. We told our server that we had a 7:30 pm show and he was more than accommodating. We got our food on time and out the door in time to make our show. 

Additionally, the decor is eclectic and lovely. It's certainly a nice aesthetic, but the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. The music was incredibly loud and everyone was talking over it. Because everyone was talking over the loud music and the tables are close together, we got to hear basically the entirety of the conversation between two ladies next to us and had a very difficult time conversing ourselves. We eventually gave up. Mercifully, the food came out about 25 minutes later (we both ordered pasta dishes to speed the process) and we were completely underwhelmed. 

I wasn't expecting anything to taste like I stepped through a portal to Florence, Italy, but for the hype and the price, I expected that in my lasagnette nero, the lobster wouldn't be so overcooked and chewy. The sauce wasn't terribly flavorful unless you like fennel paste with a dash of lemon. None of it tasted quite right. The nero noodles were heavy and rubbery. My husband's cavatelli was overly sweet and honestly pretty bland. We had such high expectations of the food and walked away disappointed. 

Again, it's a charming place and the service was excellent. If we try again, we'll opt for something completely different off the menu.

A 2 year local to Las Vegas, I brought two of my visiting friends who wanted to dine off the strip on a Saturday night at the end of May. The restaurant was busy for any good joint on a weekend night. 

I arrived and waited about a minute for the hostess after we entered. A couple arrives behind our group, the hostess comes up, walks past me and greets the people behind us when we are clearly next in line.

We eventually get seated at the back patio after getting drinks at the bar, the weather was nice and I was looking forward to having a good time with friends I haven't seen in a while. 

We were seated for a couple minutes and someone drops off waters to our table and tells us our server will be with us, soon. Several employees walk by our table numerous times and we are never ever greeted again...for about 15 minutes...while the staff is serving other tables, they even served a table that was seated several minutes after we sat down. I grew very agitated at the absurdity in the lack of service.  At this point, I concluded that our time at Esther's will be downhill from here. I called it a night at Esther's, we got up and walked out...with no one ever once greeting us again. 

We went over to spend our time and money at Carson Kitchen to have dinner where service was a million times more better and the food was amazing. 

I am greatly disappointed I did not get to try Esther's Kitchen, I had been looking forward to dining here since it opened. I am a great supporter of local restaurants but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Will I go back?

I had the opportunity to come back in a give it another go.  Another great experience.  I do have to say that this is probably one of the best food experiences I've had in Vegas, including those hoity toity expensive places on the strip.

Let's talk about the food.  Each time I've been here the food has been exemplary.  You know what's even harder?  Consistency.  I've had the sourdough bread with anchovy garlic butter each time I've come in and every time it's the same amazing flavor that I've come to crave.  I've had every one of the pasta dishes now and I can't tell you which is my favorite because they are ALL that good.  Yes, the house made pasta is the star but they all also have the right ingredients to make a great balance of flavor.  Picking a pasta here is purely personal preference.  

The service is great.  Yes, it may get a little slow when it's busy but I can't think of any other place that this doesn't happen at.  We too had to wait a bit to be seated even though we got there exactly at the time of our reservation but it was very very crowded.  Every seat was taken, as well as at the bar.  

Every server and bartender I've come into contact with here is great.  Knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, not pushy, not too standoffish.  The general manager and the chef/owner both actually work on the floor here (which I love) and they were so gracious.  They made me feel as if my business was important to them.

Moved onto the meatballs which were hearty and the pesto ricotta which we named ""the green sauce"" stayed on the table until every last drop was soaked in bread. My only issue with the meal was the sourdough bread we ordered with the burrata. The bread was way overdone and I was not a fan. 

The caramelized onion pizza was mouthwatering and he tiny quail eggs were a brilliant touch on each slice... no yolks left behind! The Carbonara was rich and the fresh peas added a nice crunch of texture. I enjoyed a glass of Sauvignon Blanc with the rest of my meal but we skipped dessert.

We were 15 minutes late for our reservation and they offered to seat us outside in 95 degree heat or eat at the bar.  The hostess and manager were extremely unaccommodating, boarding in rude, combined with the fact that the resturant does not have air conditioning or at least it was not on.  So we decided to sit at the bar and in spite of the bad first and second impressions Sonya was fantastic.  The burrata was ok and the pasta was fine.  
With all of the other options in Vegas I will pass on Esters the next time I am in town.",dcDjXc64u9lbHkS_8sjlUg,0,0,3,BjzncI2wi1ku41OLNs8UVg

We went to Esther's about 2 days ago on a Wednesday and now I'm scratching my head on why we haven't checked out this little gem sooner. We had the 3 different pastas and everyone was delicious. House baked bread & burrata was a perfect start to this carb overload of a dinning experience. totally worth it.   Defiantly check this place out when searching downtown spots as its the best one in a while.",BPRMzqVa2JVhAI0kxKycGQ,0,1,5,mDKJGVzHp5n6dVLRHuzbSA

Highly recommend the peppery pasta (they'll make it vegan for you!), the beets, and the mushrooms.",8AOhacFnvL-TFX9PdIN-fA,0,0,5,7geMcgHgU4eavceOqA0clA
