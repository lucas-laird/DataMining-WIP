959486,2018-02-13,0,-kFyzXRzOlyoL4NyzoVkMA,No very good my scrambled eggs were runny and the French toast was undercooked. The cooking staff needs more work and the service was terrible the lady took or order left brought or food and did not appear until the end of our meal. Would expect more from this so called good restaurant. Don't waste your time or your hard earned money to go here.,UWuSfrB3NPbofdOtwMoJKA,0,0,1,IpRfHrdrOoo6Zm_OD-Ixgg

I also had a Bloody Mary the night before and it was so delicious.",9bFa3CU3Tp49I0k2zL3pXw,2,0,5,9hasvEi_J3NAwQ9TPe5GAg

I felt compelled to create a new Yelp entry for this one, as it isn't inside the DJT restaurant, nor does it reflect fairly on the Trump hotel. That said, this buffet isn't a regular thing, as it only happens in the mornings on busier days. They shut off the lounge area in front of DJT and put up temp tables with the fare, and roll out an omelet station. 

Basically, for the coin skip out on this one if you can. It's not that the food is terrible - it would be fantastic at the Holiday Inn Express Fargo for instance. But it would also be half the price there. So they charge you around $20 for what at first glance seems to be a DECENT buffet. If you've never experienced what a modern Vegas buffet has on offer then you might be quite satisfied with the cold flavorless potatoes, the stale pastries that could be from an Entemann's box, or the the omelet station that was on par with the one at my college dining hall. At least they have ample lox and cream cheese...

...but no bagel selection! The rest of the selection of fruits and cheeses were the best thing going...

...if you've never been to the buffet at the Cosmopolitan, Bellagio or Wynn. 

The point is, if you really need to grab some food here there better be a damn good practical reason. Otherwise take the time to try another buffet out. I went to the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan and was blown away by the amazing spread of options, decor, service and lower price. For more money you can be amazed by the Wynn down the street, and the Bellagio's buffet reviews well too. 

You've been educated.",ZffZVnS1CIBjkfu5BNKBlg,20,3,2,yDh8KtrKCXofkSTlFxr7EQ
