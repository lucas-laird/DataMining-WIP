124289,2011-08-13,0,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"The king. You will not find many chains on here aside from a few regional ones, but this particular one can't be ignored. Not much to say about this burger, the price can't be beat anywhere in town to match the quality. Most fast food patties I wouldn't consider eating on their own, or even looking at too closely for that matter, but theirs are good no matter what. I'd almost venture to say it's real beef? The patties are never frozen, and supposedly they only locate their restaurants to within a certain driving distance of any food prepping location. The lettuce, tomato and sauce are all fresh, and almost even refreshing on the burger. I personally love the fries, although they're almost always cooked inconsistently throughout with some overdone, and some undercooked all in the mix. The fries are a bit of a controversy with most people I know, some people hate them, some love them. As for their flavor, think of those old school Potato Sticks. Still, for the value this meal can't be beat. You do get that slightly off stomach ache after a meal here that you don't necessarily get from higher end places, but I compel you to find something better for $6 all in. The shakes are great, the iced tea and lemonade are also good choices.

The secret menu adds a bit of mystique and makes for great articles all over the internet. And at times you almost feel like you're in an exclusive club when you order your fries 'Animal Style' or get a Neopolitan shake and the tourists next to you can't seem to find that verbage anywhere on the 3 item menu. You've all heard about the place, and it's a must on anyone's list if you travel to a city that has one.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,5,uUKwd9UJtluniK-rS9BzwQ
171690,2011-08-04,0,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"So, after years of hearing about In-N-Out, I finally decided to try it.  All fast food burgers are seen through the prism of Five Guys, so, with that in mind, I tried the basic, no frills, no quasi-secret menu hamburger, fries and chocolate shake.

The verdict:  not bad...not bad at all.  I'm still a Five Guys fanatic...there are times I would kill for a double with fried onions, jalape√±os, relish and mustard...mmmmm...sorry, slipping into food fugue state...stay focused...

The burger was tasty and moist, the toppings and bun fresh.  The fries were okay (The use of peanut oil for Five Guys fries really sets them apart) and the shake, while good, wasn't up the standards of another fast food franchise, Carl's Jr.  

While my love - perhaps even unholy lust - for Five Guys (insert joke here...I'm not doing all the work for you) has not been shaken, In-N-Out makes a respectable burger and will be getting my business again.  Like the most satisfying fast food places - Five Guys, Canes - they focus on doing one thing - burgers - and doing it well.  I'm looking forward to trying an Animal Style next.",qo35VLrBsx4hvTGkHZLxvg,0,0,4,-6hG0US0e_F0LvqMEba9Hw

But, their animal style fries are ridiculously worth the hype. I really recommend giving these a try. Regular fries are alright, I usually order them well done.

I was quite mad that they forgot about my order to the point where I had to go up to them and remind them about it, but mistakes happen, and the people who work there are extremely kind and charming. And once again, you can't go wrong with the prices. For a double double, animal style fries, and a milkshake, I spent about $11. At Shake Shack, one specialty burger is already $10.

548463,2011-03-25,3,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"This place clearly knows what they're doing, and they continue to do it long after opening their doors. While other fast food joints water down their menu with a jack-of-all-trades approach, In-N-Out sticks with a small menu of items they've perfected. The only thing I've seen them add is coffee, a Kona blend that's very similar to what's offered at Jack in the Box. That's where similarities end. When the economy slides down another notch, their prices only go up by a couple pennies. McDonalds and Taco Bell hold no qualms about jacking up stuff 35-65% whenever they feel like people aren't paying enough for the egg on their McMuffin or the Fritos in their burritos. And In-N-Out doesn't water down their drinks. If anything, they intensify the syrup and blast it with extra carbon dioxide so that the bubbles furiously retain their presence. And the water tastes clean, an amazing feat in fast food around here.

All items are fresh and trucked in regularly. I don't even think they have a freezer, because nothing is frozen. The meat is always cooked medium-well, with the slightest sliver of pink remaining in the middle, just enough to retain extra flavor while still being completely hot. Vegetables are ice cold, which can be potentially problematic if your burger sits for a long time without being eaten. Best to attack that thing as soon as you get it, because nothing compares to the bliss of a freshly prepared burger at this place. And never does it sit under a heat lamp. As soon as it's done, it's in your hand.

A standard Double Double contains two 1/8 lb patties. This is typically enough, despite a culture that expects our burgers to weigh as much as a human brain. Considering this is more meat (and better meat) than a Big Mac, I don't see the problem. But if you really want more, they do this weird thing there where they put as many patties as you want. Considering the burgers are fully customizable, from the number of patties, cheese, toppings and even the inclusion/removal of the bun, it's hard to see where you can find fault with the burgers. Short of ordering it animal style, they don't even charge for extra toppings.

And speaking of animal style, there is no greater sin than animal style fries. Whenever I feel like throwing caution to the wind and indulging my inner fat kid, that small hill of cheese, sauce and fried onions is enough to bring a tear to my eye. A full meal at this place always leaves me satisfied and jovial. And while I enjoy hitting the other places every so often, never does it compare to the immaculate In-N-Out.",NgqVI51Fot6-bTUT6lpYow,3,4,5,vflWN481uiFPWG19iN1U9Q

Our cashier, Steve Me, was friendly and he answered our questions clearly and knowledgably. The fries were a bit bland and soft, but I won't knock them for that because some people like them that way (like my husband). We ate in the restaurant and then decided to get a chocolate shake.

And yes, it was delicious.  Call me a freak if you will but I would've enjoyed a little more mustard mixed into the meat.

The best parts of my In-N-Out experience were my fries and shake.  At first, I was too busy digging into my cheeseburger to notice just how light and crispy my fries were.  Even more impressive was the fact that... Brace yourself... In-N-Out's fries actually taste like potatoes!  But as good as the fries were, they barely held a candle to what might have been the best fast food milkshake I've ever had.  Before my trip to In-N-Out, I was under the impression that White Castle had the best chocolate shake around.  It's always nice to be proven wrong, especially when being proven wrong means you can give White Castle a little less credit.

For years, I've heard In-N-Out described as the Mecca of fast food.  My verdict?  While In-N-Out might not be my favorite burger joint, I enjoyed every moment of my holy pilgrimage and would gladly make it again.",n89fWyx196kRbDJO2Kcz_w,0,0,4,GS00oFOOBmRp5J3agIQs7g

I went to In-N-Out for a late lunch after visiting the Hoover Dam. The burger was delicious and made just like I asked (mustard grilled with extra veggies), the fries were perfect and my Neapolitan milkshake was To-Die-For!!!! I love that everything tastes so fresh - and you can even see them making the fries from fresh potatoes. 

Word to the wise - this is NOT on the strip - it looks like you can walk to it's glowing sign, but you will be fooled. Also, some cab drivers downright REFUSE to go there since they end up just waiting for you when they could be out making more money. The restaurant is also just average size - we were lucky enough to get a table, but as soon as we were done we saw several families standing around with their food not knowing what to do since there was no more seating :(. If you're visiting Las Vegas and are lucky enough to have a ride to this delicious restaurant, please go! You and your wallet will love it! P.S. Families - ask for In-N-Out hats for your kids!

Way cheaper than McD's and your food is cooked fresh to order and you get it hot! Unlike McD's where the cheese isn't even melted 99% of the time.

I used to not be an In N Out fan, but compared to other fast food places, really how can you complain about it? You can't compare them to other $6-8 per burger joints.

1. They are open til 1am inside, which is awesome, especially after getting out of a sporting event late at night with friends.

2. A Double-Double is an American Classic and one damn good cheeseburger, nothing beats it.

3. They have the simplest menu on earth, which means the food is incredibly fresh because all they make is burgers and french fries, which happen to be the most perfect combination ever.

Yeah, it's pretty straight forward here. There is nothing better than a Double Double with a handful of their fresh cut fries washed down with a shake or ice cold Dr Pepper or Coke. Theyre open late, the food is amazing, and incredibly affordable. You can easily get meals for two people for $10. There's a reason any location you go to is always busy.

Now that I'm well into my 30's, my visits to In-N-Out have dwindled to only a few times a year.....I can't seem to burn the calories like I use to, so visiting one is a huge treat for me.  Last night was one of those nights.

I ordered a Double Double & a Cheeseburger & Fries.  Of course, they came out prepared just like I remember them.....Sloppy, Drippy, and Nom-ilicous!  I am talking about the Burgers....ok?  The Fries are my fav's too.....you can always tell that they were just cut moments before I walked into the door.  I love it!

This location is the closest to my house, but for some reason I've never eaten here.  The drive thru was a madhouse of course, but there was no line inside....bonus!  I love watching them prepare the food as I wait....It amazes me that they can crank out so many burgers and fries so efficiently and consistently.....one of the major reasons why I come back.

Will I return?  That's a stupid question.....of course!",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,8,7,5,6g5EZGTH-MP_IExhtywSPg

3997108,2011-05-24,0,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"This place is a classic, so of course everyone raves about it, but in all reality-ITS REALLY NOT ALL THAT GOOD. Ya, for fast food its pretty decent, but don't expect to get anything decent here other than a hamburger. Their menu is really limited, and I know they have a ""secret"" menu with items like animal style fries, but what average person who comes here knows that? They don't offer a veggie burger or anything other than a grilled cheese which is rubbery cheese on a hamburger bun and a tomato on it..if you think this is quality food, think again. I'm not saying In-N-Out isn't better than mostly all fast food, I'm just saying it's not really the dining delicacy that everyone makes it out to be. Its just sort of average, that's all. It should be called OVERRATED instead.",OR1ZAPnhXRxPm1GTY1F7Tg,1,1,3,lX5cU38eX1TaPgu-dWnBvw
4014404,2011-02-18,0,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"In all my years living in Las Vegas...why haven't I ever reviewed In-N-Out Burger???  This place is like an institution on the west coast!!  They even have one within walking distance to my college alma mater UNLV!  Yes, yes...many good memories...some very memorable, some a lil' hazy thanks to my introduction then to cheap liquor...and even cheaper college women.  Nah, just kidding!  I think...

I frequent this In-N-Out the most now a days.  Since my 1st succulent bite at In-N-Out as a prepubescent college geek I've been hooked ever since!  This is my go-to place for a burger when I don't want to think about having a burger.  It is my wingman on a Friday night when I'm doing a Taio Cruz (now sing it, S-O-L-O!), my buddy when no other cheap eats will do.  It is the Robin to my Batman, the Chong to my Cheech, the Ivory to my Ebony.  Wow, I just realized I need to get out more.

Back to the lesson at hand, In-N-Out is really what a hamburger is all about!  Really!  They got the K.I.S.S. thing (Keep It Simple Stupid) down to a science!  No overcomplicated menu, no fancy schmancy, no bad attitudes!  Just meat, cheese, potatoes!  Easy!  I have never had a bad burger at In-N-Out...ever.  If you have, either your order was wrong (which they will gladly fix), or In-N-Out isn't your kind of place!  Everything here is fresh, fresh, fresh, and that is the key to the great burger and fries.  Fresh meat (not frozen like that McDonald's place), fresh cut fries, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions!  The cheese might be processed a bit, but ah, I give them the benefit of the doubt because it's so good!  And they serve COCA COLA!  Yeah, forget you Pepsi!  Sorry to all you Pepsi lovers, but I was born in GA (but yes I am Asian..and yes, I am from Hawaii) so I'm keepin' it real and being loyal to the homies out in the A-T-L.

If you've been to In-N-Out you of course have seen their main menu.  It's only got 3 combos on it!  1-The hamburger, 2-The cheeseburger, and 3-The Double-Double.  How hard can it be to log in an order?  Please!  Even a drunkard can squibble out a number and still be pleasantly fed.  But if you're a fan of In-N-Out or have been coming here for a long time you know all about the 'Secret' menu.  Right?  Come on!  OK, the cat is out of the bag:

http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp

Was that so hard?  Now you can order like an In-N-Out connoisseur just like me!  Here's my usual whenever I hit the joint:

#2 Combo - Cheeseburger 'Animal Style' with extra grilled onions, add raw onion, extra pickle, add mustard, fries well done (trust me, they are good), and a Diet Coke with lemon

See...simple!  Deliciious!  If I'm feelin' really good that day I'll get the fries 'Animal Style' as well!  What's better than fresh fries topped with cheese, grilled onions, and In-N-Out spread?  It may not look appetizing but damn are they tasty!  Need more meat?  Get yours in a Double-Double(2 meat-2 cheese), or a 3x3 (3 meat-3 cheese) or 4x4(4 meat-4 cheese)!  I once knew a guy that liked an 8x8 (8 meat-8 cheese) but that's a bit much for me!  

In-N-Out prides itself on cleanliness, so for the most part the restaurant is very tidy and not funky smelling.  Service here is fast and consistent, while still being very friendly.  Often times the line will be out the door, especially on weekends and late nights!  I constantly see 6-7 cars stacked in the drive thru on a busy day.  You know your burger is doing OK when your neighbors are Panda Express, Raisin Cane's, On the Border, and SmashBurger..and your place is still packed!

Enough of this, the thought is making my mouth water.  I will gladly run extra laps and do extra crunches for this meaty delight!  I feel so bad for you vegetarians and 'Raw' eaters.  How can you not love In-N-Out?  It puts the ""Ooooooooo"" in ""Moooooooo""!!!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,5,AiP7Hs3jTzDt81plhQcxvw

4052595,2017-01-18,9,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"10 Reasons Why I'm a Fan of In-N-Out

1.  Their burgers are always fresh with no preservatives

2.  The menu is basic....Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Double Double, and Fries

3.  A Double Double, Spread Only, and Extra Toast. Nuff Said!

4.  Price is as good as it gets.  A Double Double (2 cheese / 2 patties) is less than $4.00.  The Double Double meal is less than $7.00.  A full meal is about the price of one Cold Brew.  

5.  The Service.  They're so efficient.  Food is ordered and served with the quickness

6.  Their Secret Menu.  My favorite ""off the menu"" item is their Flying Dutchman (2 patties / 2 slices of cheese / No Bun), a 3 x 3 (3 patties / 3 slices of cheese), and Well Done Fries

7.  Low Carb or Keto Friendly.  Cutting your carbs and increasing your fat intake?  For less than $5, Two Flying Dutchman's will do the trick. They're even Vegan friendly. They'll say ""hi"" to them. 

8.  Pet Friendly.  Fido will thank you for the Pup Patty.  

9.  The beef comes from the happy cows of California.  In order to guarantee freshness, In-N-Out is only on the West Coast.  No freezers here.

10. That's What a Hamburger's All About

Definitely when it comes to a big chain, these are great burgers. I love that when there are a bunch of fast food that sold out to prepped preserve laden foods that In-N-Out is still keeping it real. Fresh, simple, hot food can go a long way. 

I love a animal style double double but I sometimes also get it animal protein style (wrapped in lettuce) when I'm feeling something crisp. Can't beat some animal style fries and a shake too.

5470992,2013-04-10,4,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"Ok, so I would have orginally given them four stars. Really, I was such a fan of theirs. Lately I've noticed that even though they may have fresh burgers, a 'cool' 'secret' menu (that everyone knows about) they have quite a few problems that have been adding up to my annoyance over the years.
I've lived right up the street from this place for 18 years, so I was there when it first opened up (and it was a big deal to the community, no more shall we have to drive down to Lake Mead!) and have seen them develop over the years.
1.) Service has gotten worse, the wait time is ridiculous, and to make it more of an insult they have an actual timer for you to watch while you wait. This applies to when it is busy (which I can understand to a POINT- fifteen minutes at the LAST window? Not cool) and when you  come at 11pm at night and wait 10 minutes for your fries and milkshake. I'm sorry, but it has gotten ridiculous over the years, the amount of waiting I have to do inside and outside (inside is worse by the way) so much so that when I went to one in San Francisco (one that had TWO lines by the way) I expected to wait half an hour, but it turned out it took less time to get us through there than it does here at this location when there is only one person in front of you. So it is not an overall In N Out issue, it is THIS place's issue.
2.) Prices have gone way up. End of story.
3.) It is not unresonable to ask for a grilled cheese to be grilled away from the burgers, on the other grill. Escpecially not when there is an actual option for it. So when I ask, and I find meat chunks on my grilled cheese, I know you did not, in fact, grill it on the other grill. This ties into a very important reason why I no longer come to this location: They rarely listen to what you want, if it is outside of the ""Double Double no onions"" deal. More cheese? Maybe. No salt on your fries? Perhaps. Half strawberry half chocolate milkshake? Kinda. If they can't hold up to their 'secret' menu, then they should not have it as an option.
Other locations are way better.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,4,2,2,UKbvWpev8EDTq5wvGS5Y9w
5473851,2012-02-18,0,mnU3iGsL55MCWXiWV3AcAQ,"My husband is a huge fan of In n Out Burger and since they stick to letting us on the East coast suffer by not bringing the chain closer than Las Vegas we make a visit any time there is one in town. 
In Vegas you get tired of fancy eating after a while, even more when you have Joel Robuchon on your list for the week of restaurants. So In n Out came as a welcomed relaxed, smacking good meal.  My husband had already advised me that taxis go in and out of In n Out all the time, so we let our taxi go not before having been told by about three locals, ""oh, your going to get real good food now"" of course when we came back to the hotel and they saw me with my drink cup all the valet people asked what we had brought them from In n Out.  It is no coincidence that In n Out is so famous.

They use really good clean oil for their fries which come out, without fault, light yellow and crispy.  For ladies I suggest the single burger and for guys the Double Double. The Monster Fries are not on the menu, as are about 7 other articles, that are secret knowledge of only the  real fans of the chain restaurant. We had the monsters last time, which are like a double dose of fries drenched in their special pink sauce which they also put on their burgers, I think. I'll have to ask the hubby for the real story.

Milk shakes are pretty, darn thick I should have done without those calories, but heck I won't be having one of those for a while now.

The staff are always very friendly. I have become a vegetarian and when i cheat a couple times a year, the meat i will eat will be a IN-N Out Burger. That is all i will miss not eating meat.",Y2jRTW_yFPwd1Nhu5fCCPg,0,0,5,6Pq017bA-nP5Yc3waltqzg
