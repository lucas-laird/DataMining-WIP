So much so, after I ate here for the first time, I returned two more times in the same week (last week).  Food was consistent, fresh, and servers were always pleasant and efficient.  Shrimp is always easy to over cook, and can get tough after sitting in the steam table tray after a while.  The shrimp here was especially good for Panda.  

I give it a 5 because it is great Panda Express food.  I'm not walking in expecting gourmet.  For the price, and convenience, and for a chain restaurant.  This one is run very well.",MLOT_Q6ZcNqsTligvQAI1g,0,0,5,vBOkihbU0dNnFCDS5NFgyg

The only bad service we feel we have is when the manager serves us our order he is very sloppy and we feel like he always has preference  and he served our to go in really small portions we saw he served the ppl behind us and he overfilled his plate...

1949701,2012-08-09,0,7GfA5WMSRd-JCaPxnwgIQw,"I remembered the food here being mediocre and I normally do not come here for Chinese food but I was in need of white rice and I did not feel like only ordering white rice from an actual Chinese restaurant.  I know what you're thinking...why don't you just cook rice at home yourself?  Sad to say, I am probably the only Asian person who does not know how to cook rice.  I know...way to fail at being Asian.

Anyways, the lady Jano helped me and her service was superb so I decided to get orange chicken, green beans and chicken, and chicken potstickers along with white rice.  All of the items that I ordered tasted better than I remembered.  I don't know if the stupendous service made me bias about the quality of the food or what but it's not bad for fast food Chinese food!",L5uRYpL9arVGueEetKjmpw,0,0,4,fzqrTtNSUVl9_sGFpKJSyQ

One thing I didn't like is that they had half of the restaurant seating closed off because they had cleaned it and they didn't want anyone sitting there before closing. Kind of lame. Other than that the food was just OK as usual. On the bright side, there's a Krispy Kreme next door!",965QDYAn8jXQ9Wj7whuHsA,0,1,2,Jt7Qz9oGRbtlJeVqFjLz8w

I've been to Panda numerous times, but this was a first for sure. While my mother-in-law stood in line that gave me lots of time to take photos and videos of the food and staff for Yelp, so overall it was a win, plus everything was super fresh because of the high turnover with the crowd. 

Despite being swamped, the staff still asked everyone in line of they wanted samples, and they kept a happy, friendly attitude. It became clear to me why there was a rush. There was a new Shanghai Angus Steak entree available and it was fantastic! It was tender, juicy and extra flavorful. Now, I hate steak. It is not my favorite dish at all. I get the eggplant tofu usually. But this steak was special. It's steak for anti-steak people. No gristle and no fat- hooray! 

We also picked up a box of the honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken. Sides were fried rice and noodles. Both of the other entrees were good, but the steak was the star of the show. My father-in-law and husband said the same thing. I will absolutely be back, and next time I'm coming for the steak. Load me up!",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,9,5,4,i5BQGFtYN4vK-L74w5U9lA

Plus I asked her if I could order a panda bowl with half orange chicken and bejing beef...to which she growled ""NO"" at me...come on, give me a break it's a bowl. You can only put so much in it. I guess it's too much to ask of her to put a little less chicken in it and give me a couple pieces of beef.

The guy behind the counter apologized that it was his first day before I even received and paid for the food, i never complained about anything or even looked frustrated he just apologized out of no where.

Service big fat ZERO! I waited forever in line behind a family that couldn't make up their minds. I order a small box of orange chicken.  That's it! I am standing there after I order at the counter waiting...two employees are waiting on the people behind me...and I am standing there. Put my chicken in a little box and take my money...but that's too difficult for the employees here because they were so concerned getting the order of the people behind me correct. I could have said hey I am here wait on me but if you have ever seen me in real life I am not hard to miss. I walked out. 

I WALKED OUT!!!!!!!!


I went out to the parking lot and called the manager from my car. I told him that I walked out because I was left standing there while they waited on the people behind me. He asked if I got everything? What? I got nothing. How do you not understand this? I told him why I walked out and that I would go to another location.  He said okay NO PROBLEM!  Um... Excuse me?  I corrected him and said no we have a big problem, I called you first of all because I think you deserve to know why people are walking out, second of all, I live around the corner and I am being inconvenienced. What about this makes you think there is no problem??

I would never dream of reviewing Panda Express regardless of the food, but service that bad NEEDS to be addressed.  A sorry would have been nice. The manager said he'd talk to his employees I'm sure he won't by his flippant attitude.",ElUiVmEMoQgyWcnYeR560w,0,0,1,yku_-7AZcirEDwW05HI5vQ

So I went in Panda the other day for dinner. The customer service by the two young ladies in there was superb. They offered samples and assisted with menu election. 

Since I was waiting for fresh chow mein they offered me a free drink and just tried to make me feel comfortable while waiting. When my food was ready they bagged it up and gave me all the condiments I asked for. The service really stood out this trip. Thanks girls, keep it up. 

I ordered the 2 item combo with chow mein, and grilled chicken teriyaki - my fave, along with their famous orange chicken. Yummy when hot!

I expect the service and quality to be a smidge better than what I received. I've been here before and it's been better. This visit there were slim pickens.. One entree wasn't even available, I was told it would be five minutes. I'm no restaurant expert, but shouldn't you get things ready to replace well before you run out? So my second choice was my usual sweet fire chicken..sweet with a little kick. I always enjoy the pineapple chunks but didn't get even one this time..sad face.. I ordered the cream cheese rangoon, unfortunately it was way over cooked but my dog didn't mind! There was one person in front of me and it took as long as if there were 12.

I'm not a big fan of Panda Express since I am accustomed to authentic Asian food, but at the same time it's not terrible enough to hate. This is a clean restaurant, but the portions were pretty stingy. At most Pandas they will give you a ton of rice and noodles to at least make up for the stinginess of the entrees (if they are even stingy with the entrees, it really depends on the person serving you), but not at this location. My bf pointed out that perhaps if we had ordered it for there we might have gotten more. I do like the outdoor seating. It's facing the parking lot, not the street, which made it quieter and more relaxing to eat outside.

5848946,2013-06-04,2,7GfA5WMSRd-JCaPxnwgIQw,"This location is a 50/50 crap shoot seriously as there is no consistency in how they operate. It really all depends on who is serving up your plate and/or what cook is making up the food as it can be good or it can be bad!

I can go in one day and get a fresh tasty combo and it be wonderful and on the next visit get a combo that is skimpy and taste old, dried and hard.

This is the closest and most convenient location to my house so it gets the most business from me and sometimes my visit is OK and sometimes it sucks ass.

The shrimp dishes are a rip off as they charge an additional $1 however give you just a few pieces of shrimp which is mostly vegetables or whatever the shrimp is mixed in with. If I order a shrimp item than give me some damn shrimp, OK!

Get your free sample so that you don't have to guess and wonder if you will like the item or not as they have new ones from time to time. I was not crazy about the new surf and turf item they have so I am glad I sampled it and ordered something else.

I really like the honey walnut shrimp however it is not always made the same way, it can be sweet or less sweet and more of just a plain mayo taste. When I order something that taste good then I come back for it and it taste completely different that is an issue for me.

I much prefer authentic Chinese and Cantonese food however on the go this will do the trick for American style Chinese food.

This location isn't too bad. There are many parking stalls outside and the restaurant is clean. However, I do feel sorry for the employees who are working here. It seems like every time I stop by, there is only one employee behind the counter who has to deal with a long line of customers and no one else is around to help out. But even under all that stress, they try to be friendly and are always asking if I would like to sample any entrees. 

The main problem with Panda Express is that you don't know how long the food has been sitting there, and they don't make a fresh batch until they run out of something. Sometimes the fried rice is dry, the egg rolls are not crispy, and some of the other entrees may lack flavor. 

Over the years, I have become a fan of Pick Up Stix. But since they don't have any locations here in Vegas, Panda will have to do for now.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,1,3,Z7txg9FHJFLEIIL3pgEfIQ
