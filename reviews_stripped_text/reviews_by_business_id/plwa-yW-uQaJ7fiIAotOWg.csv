Had to change the order to go becoz of how long it took (waah!) but the bread was really soft, and what was stuffed between it was really fresh meat, grilled onions and american cheese plus veggies ordered at my request. IMHO, a little expensive for a lunch sandwich, but the small is really large for what you get. p.s. on my order chips were extra, and there's no ""name-brand"" kinds, they only order Wise brand chips (the kind out of the vending machine you get at rest-stops along highway routes) LOL",01prx46XR0mMJpNjpGeS6Q,1,1,3,-hd9inRkrgajcOsZIpp7Xg

Being from Southern California you can't call the pastrami here a true pastrami sandwich. First off all the Capastrami comes with coleslaw and Russian dressing on it... YUK! The cheesesteak here I eat during the colder months but it as well can't be called a true cheesesteak. The cheesesteak here is more like crumbled beef and you wont find any whiz here to add to it either. 
What I do like here is the Italian sandwich and the Italian Sausage. Sandwiches come in 3 sizes from small, medium and large. The large is 20 inches so you will need a appetite or someone to share with.

Italian Sandwich..... Has  genoa salami, capacolla and prosciutini. You can have all the standard stuff added to it like pickles, onions, lettuce etc. I like the sweet crushed peppers on this sandwich they have a pickled flavor but a nice kick too. 

Italian Sausage Sandwich..... Has grilled sausage and marinara sauce and provolone. This is a really good sandwich.

2140237,2013-05-15,0,plwa-yW-uQaJ7fiIAotOWg,"I have two words for you; The Bobby. 

Warning! Do not operate heavy machinery after eating this sandwich. You will be in the itis within 20 minutes. 

Fresh baked french bread, succulent daily roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and mayo give you a creamy and hearty sandwich. 

The small, which is more than enough for me for two meals, rarely lasts until meal 2 as it's so freakin' delicious. I'll wrap up half of it and find myself picking at it. 

I order extra mayo/extra cran (no additional charge) because otherwise, it's too dry for me. When people try mine with the extras, I've been told that it's too wet, so it's mostly my personal preference. 

This location also sells TastyKake and Nothing Bundt Cake which are nice, light dessert options after such a heavy meal. 

I haven't fallen in love with any of their other sandwiches. Whenever I got outside my comfort zone to try a new one, I always feel like I made the wrong decision and should have kept to my tried and true. 

I love that they use plain butcher paper to wrap the subs. This way, you won't have ink smears on your hand if the sandwich goos out the side.",4YO567yc-4bFLuvFMMX75w,0,0,3,7HAJkt4OptLFiVQlJ33snA

It's a soft hot sandwich stuffed with moist pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw.
Sm: $7.79
Med: $8.99
Lg: $13.79

My boyfriend and I shared the medium and it was more than enough. We would probably stick with sharing a small next time. 

It was a soft, warm and moist sandwich, but the cole slaw gave it a great cold crisp texture and the Russian dressing which tastes like a homemade sweeter thousand island dressing, added a nice sweetness to the sandwich. 

I'm a saucy girl, so I asked them for an extra side of the Russian dressing to spread on my sandwich. I also asked for a side of sweet peppers and piled them into my sandwich and it turned it from good to amazing. So much better with sweet peppers in every bite! I loved it.

I came across The Bobbie while on adventures in the village of Las Vegas, and it was there, that I encountered a truly delectable specimen. One whose melding of savory sweet flavors has kept me awake many a night, seeking to once again rejoice in a reunion of the senses. Some day, we shall meet again, and I shall once again slay The Bobbie, enjoying every second of it.

This location on Town Center is attached to a gas station. 
it has plenty of room inside unlike the other locations to sit and enjoy one of their tasty options.The one thing I have noticed is that not each location is consistent with how the food comes out. This location is. 

I do know they hand make each meatball everyday for the meatball subs. I have only tried the meatball once and personally wasn't a fan. 

If you have never had a ""Bobbie"" then please try it at least once. If you love a Thanksgiving meal then you will really love this one. When people complain about it not being hot or not having gravy I wonder why they came here and ordered a bobbie?! There are lots of places that have a similar sandwich but Capriotti's invented the one and only bobbie and it doesn't come hot or with gravy!

The Capastrami (my fav) is perfect. When I order it I know it will be to perfection and each bite heaven. I have eaten two this week!

I never ever have an issue with the Italian sub. It is just a winner every time and perfect if you are heading up to Red Rock for some hiking as a picnic lunch. 

The Wise chips are a very excellent addition to your sandwich. The ""Honey BBQ"" is what I like to get when they aren't sold out.

You can call ahead your order for pick up. That is what I usually do because lines can be very long especially during lunch.
