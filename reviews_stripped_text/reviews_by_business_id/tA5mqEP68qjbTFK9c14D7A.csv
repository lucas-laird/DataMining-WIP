This place does serve good food and looks delicious but I am a sauce person and similar to my joy pot I like popcorn chicken with sweet and sour or spicy sauce. Something along the lines with a flavorful taste so I don't just taste the fried chicken breast. 
It may be due to the many Asian fusion places in my area. Living in SGV (San Gabriel Valley), which leaves me to make a drastic opinion based on things that others may not even care for. But overall presentation and quality is pretty good but I would not come back.",o865-7pvsMdSEowBbdp-bw,2,2,3,ygewwni0yXUeNrg8ElYLzw

Had the half & half Taiwanese sausage as an appetizer for the table. Definitely liked the black pepper sausage more.  

We all had the Ribeye hot pot. We were hesitant to order medium spicy,  so we ordered mild with a side of chili oil/sauce to add if we wanted to go spicier. Be sure to get your side of rice with the minced pork! The hotpot itself had a generous amount of different ingredients besides the ribeye itself.  

Strawberry & mango shaved ice with sea salt caramel ice cream was delish! The ice cream was sooo good!",Dzh5UUSHDZ1Mu0uSzo284Q,1,1,5,33nffy6t7LJfUg8TthSy5g

Me and my husband went to check it out just a few nights ago and we absolutely loved it! The popcorn chicken is absolutely amazing.  It is soft and tender on the inside and just the right crispiness on the outside, the flavor is awesome. I got the Rib Eye hot pot and my husband got the Miso hot pot and Holy Moly, we were impressed. There was so much food we couldn't finish it all. You can definitely share with 2 people (order an appetizer as well). Their teas are so yummy yumy, my favorite is the Passion Fruit Black Tea (you can get boba in them as well), Yumo!!! 

The ladies are so sweet and nice there. There was even a lady walking around with more hot broth, refreshing everyone's hot pot. I loved that the pots arrived to your table over fire  So Cool! 

I loved it so much, I ordered take out tonight and got a popcorn chicken rice platter which I'm looking forward to devouring. I definitely recommend this place and I'm looking forward to my next trip there.",VDmxhv_hqkRW2FZkP378MQ,2,2,5,nBI1yeuhBTr3cQ-lLnIqyA

I've never had this dish anywhere before but it is much lighter broth than I expected. Maybe I needed to order higher spicy level. Anyways, the portion was way too big for just me, so at $12 it became a pricey lunch for me.  It would be great for 2 people to share.  Next time I'll ask if it's possible to turn off the fire whenever we want, because the noodles became way too overcooked as I ate. The minced pork rice was good though.

The hotpot was lack of flavor the noodles that came inside the pot was so stale that it had a smell to it. That totally ruined the hotpot for me.  I tried to pick out the few pieces of meat and edible items in there since the pot came out to about $13 which is very pricy for having nothing in it but noodles and bland soup base. 

On to the next.... The chicken wings were completely not marinated at all. They brought it out with a dipping sauce expecting the sauce to make the flavor.  No... That's not how wings are supposed to be made.  I wouldn't have graded this place with only 3 stars if the price was reasonable. I had the mini hotpot wIth an order of Chicken wings and a cup of tea which made my total bill almost $40 bucks.

Set in a nice location with very friendly people, they do a good business, and have obvious repeat customers, including myself.

All of the pots have a lot of food in them, they are full.  A lot of extras in there, they are not cheap about it at all.   Not especially spicy overall, but tasty, and they'll give you a huge bowl of spicy sauce if you ask.

Popcorn chicken is awesome!

I had never had Taiwanese hot pot before dining here, so I can't tell you how it compares to others, but I found the food to be pretty good. I ordered the spicy beef pot on every visit and I think the broth is pretty tasty.

My problem with this place isn't the food - it's the service. The staff is very friendly but not attentive at all. I've been here when customer traffic has been at varying levels, and each time their attentiveness has been consistently low. On every occasion, once I received my food, not one server checked in to see if we needed anything else, refills, etc. Furthermore, the service is very slow. It's taken them an abnormally long time to serve us our good every time we've been here.

They gave us a complimentary appetizer. It was the fried chicken, the same kinda fried chicken you would get at a boba place. Personally, at $6 I would've never ordered the chicken, it's just nothing special. Now their hot pots..... When you snap a pic of the food, it looks AMAZING. It's very colorful, it looks good. But there was almost no taste in the broth!!! It was verryyyyyyyy bland. I tried to play around with the sauces they had on the table, and I just created some other alien cuisine.

I ordered the mango black tea as suggested. The tea tasted fresh, but it was overly sweet. I did like the different hot pot choices and settled on the rib eye, spicy. The presentation of the pot was beautiful. The colors of the veggies in the pot was eye catching and made my mouth water, but it stopped there. Besides being eye catching and the ingredients being decently fresh, there was nothing delicious about this hot pot. To me, the broth makes the dish because, after all, the ingredients are cooked in this flavor. The broth was too bland and with the added spiciness, all I tasted was spicy water.

I went to several personal hotpot places in the valley and finally came to a conclusion that pot tea makes the best hotpot in town. 

I haven't been here for 13 months. Last time I wasn't so happy about their rice and how they were mopping the place while I was working on my food. But I decided to give it another try after being absent from pot tea for quite some time. 

For this experience, the meat rice was delicious! I guess they heard my displeasure from my last review. It's funny how that since my food was good this time that everything else didn't matter anymore. A bowl of rice makes a world of a difference! 

I also brought my mom and my sister and OMG, they finished their pots before I did. My mom was really satisfied. My husband was super happy since he scored points with his MIL by taking her to pot tea too. 

Though my experience this time wasn't exactly the best, but I'm happy because the food was great and we left with full bellies and happy smiles. I'm giving pot tea four stars because they earned it. I didn't smell anything funky like what other reviewers described. They must have fixed their problem.

There were maybe around 3 or 4 other parties when we got there so we didn't expect to wait long. We ordered chicken wings and the Japanese Miso hot pot. It took at least 30 minutes for the order to come out and only after following up with one of the servers who later turned out to be the manager. All the wait staff were very nice and did apologize for the delay. The food came out shortly after and the chicken wings were okay but we were so hungry by then anything would have tasted good. The hotpot came out after and the serving looked good for the price. 

Our dining experience made a turn for the worse when I found a piece of wire in our soup and I brought it to Ariana, the server's attention. She apologized and told us that she would be right back. After waiting another 10-15 minutes, she came back and said the manager will take care of us but didn't really elaborate. At that point, we had waited almost an hour and only had chicken wings. Another server asked us if we were okay and we told her that another server was helping us. We waited another 10 minutes and finally followed up with Ariana again who then told us that the person who came over was actually the manager Kara and she would take care of our bill. I told her that we didn't even know that she was the manager since she didn't introduce herself, just thought she was another server.

I understand that the place is new and maybe they are not used to handling this type of situation. I appreciate that they took care of the bill but we hardly ate and left still feeling hungry. They could have offered to replace our order although I'm not sure how much longer we would have been willing to wait.

Cons: not much flavor to the broth; my husband had veggie broth so I'm not surprised. While I had beef broth and still kinda bland. I can taste the fat of the meat so I added soysauce and lemons. It was a little bit of work to eat- opening mussels while really hot/ shrimp.

Negatives: Its tough to say. There really is really no negatives that I have to write about this place. It just was just not my cup of tea. It is more of a personal preference sort of thing.

Price/Food: The food is what really makes of breaks a restaurant for me. If the food is not that great, then the rest of it doesn't really matter much to me. The variety in a single meal was awesome. But my hot pot was bland to me, it really lacked flavor. Although I loved their chicken wings, and I loved their teas. Its one of those places you just need to try and experience for yourself. The person I was eating with, genuinely enjoyed it. But again, just not my cup of tea. If you are into quail eggs or tripe, this is the place for you.

Service/Ambiance: Service was great. Very clean. Quiet and casual. Probably not for the kiddies, because of the open flame used to keep the hot pot boiling hot, but great for a weekday meal.

The miso is by far the most flavorful, but I really do like the clam and pork as it's savory and gingery. Decent-sized portions. Taiwanese popcorn chicken and stinky tofu is great. The sauce for the stinky tofu kicks butt.

They have bubble tea and black/green teas. Service was really nice and friendly as well as warm. The restaurant itself is clean, bright, and modern.

Very comfortable and home style seating with kpop blasting in the background which is the norms nowadays. 

The girlfriend ordered Ribeye Hot Pot with the mince pork rice (first picture) & I got the Veggie Pot Delight!!(second picture) 

So the name of the place is ""Pot Tea Social House"" which now I totally understand now because 1.. the food is damn pot is hot! And 2.. You are suppose to socialize and let the food cool down!! Pretty legitimate way to dine!! 

For me the food was okay I give it a 7/10 only because I feel like they didn't have enough condiments / spices to go with the dish. I noticed my girlfriend dipping her food into the chili and lemon ponzu and I just imitated being my first time. It still tasted a little off to me and kind of blandish. When I finally realized it I just threw all the chili and lemon ponzu all up in the soupy soups and that was the game changer for me!!

Tips are.. You can always get extra broth and they can turn the flame off or on to your request!

There were only 3 ridiculously small pieces of beef, most of the pot was filled with vegetables. The broth was okay, but the entire pot was definitely not worth $19.99.

This hot pot just was not enjoyable.  I believe I had the Rib Eye Beef Pot, but the broth lacked flavor and had way too many vegetables for my personal taste.  I am used to having some sort of sauce on the side to enhance the flavor of the dish, but that wasn't the case here.

On our way out, I had the Lychee Green Tea with boba and that was delicious!

I honestly think this place got high ratings because this is the best hot pot we have in Vegas.. which isn't saying much. So overall taste wise, Pot Tea gets a solid 3 stars which is a little harsh, but since I am Chinese, I do have high expectations for hot pot.  

Came a couple of days after their opening and they were still doing some minor construction work. No biggie. I got the spicy beef hot pot and friend got the spicy miso pot. I asked for super super extra spicy while the friend got the mild. My hot pot turned out to not be spicy at all.. while my friend's actually had a good kick to it. The hot pot came with a side of minced pork rice (or vermicelli or white rice). I loved how they filled the pot with lots of ingredients, beef, fish cake, corn, imitation crab etc so they definitely weren't lacking in ingredients. What they were lacking in was flavor of the broth. The broth was really really light.. barely any flavor. And sure you can dip the stuff in the sauces they provided you with on the side, but they only provided you with 2. No option for you to make your own so that's kind of a bummer. We also ordered a side of popcorn chicken which wasn't that good either.. I thought the popcorn chicken at Easy Life was better. 

So overall, if you're not familiar with Chinese hot pot, then give this place a try. If you've grown up eating hot pot all your life, best to save the $12 and eat hot pot at home.",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,7,6,3,m3uH-tFw_cYBHKKOEd9rmw

The hotpot is designed for each person to order their own. But with appetizers and extra meat - 1 hotpot is enough for my mom and I. When you order the hot pot you have a choice between mince pork rice, steamed rice, or vermicelli. The minced pork rice is amazing if you like the taste of peanut. I personally do not like nuts - so I always opt for the noodles instead.

5/5 for amazing service, every second we were there, we were treated so good. The servers are so sweet and very quick to be at your service. Yu was our server by the way! 
5/5 for the hot pot and the price points, 
The hot pot is $13.99 for each pot, you can have your own pot and it's SO filling you don't need to even order appetizers. 
There's many different types of hot pots and it comes with rice or vermicelli. 
I ordered veggie delight, my friend ordered the rib eye pot, and you can also add on extras- seafood, meat or veggies.
The broth is a little plain but that's okay you can always add spices or flavor (which is located on the left side of your table)
As well as they refill your soup with more broth If your pot starts running out of soup which is pretty great. 
They even offer a stamp card so you can come back and get a free hot pot after 10 visits which is crazy I've never seen such thing lol.
I ordered a winter melon green tea with boba at the end and it wasn't too sweet at all, perfect amount of sweet and the boba isn't too hard but it isn't mushy either. 
Definitely coming back forever, the atmosphere is very comfortable. 
The tables are very big, the inside is very spacious and they play pretty good Korean or Japanese music for a Taiwanese place haha (pretty sure it's korean music I recognized some of the artists haha) 
Lastly to add to everything else; I'm pretty sure they don't use that much MSG in their soups because I didn't feel like crap, bloated, or lethargic after eating here. 
This is probably one of the best hot pot places I've been to in Vegas.
(Oh something I haven't mentioned though, they don't give you that much meat or they don't completely fill your pot to the brim. ITS OKAY though, it will still fill you up, so don't look disappointed when you don't see like 10 pieces of rib eye in your pot. Those 4 pieces of meat with the veggies and extra stuff will still be good enough.

U know?  :)

So overall I gave them 5 stars.  Why?  I have never been to a hot pot place where I didn't have to adjust the soup and theirs was one of the most flavorful ones....and their hot chili sauce on the table was delicious. Service was great and I didn't have to drive all the way to China town to get hot pot.  :) so would I come back?  Definitely!",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,1,1,5,sqEluDfhrZOVNTHkE-cpWw

Both have good flavor. Beef gets a little too tough for me since there's no way to stop it from being overcooked. Plenty of veggies in both and I like that there's both seafood and meat in most of their pots so you're always fishing for something different.

Their Chinese bbq sauce on the table goes great with dipping your soup goodies in plus it's homemade. 

The free jasmine green tea was delicious~ regular sweetness was not too sweet which was perfect and the jasmine flavor is prominent. Love that they're served in to-go cups already.

Although it wasn't busy, Mandy was an awesome server!! Thanks for the A++ service! She checked up on each table throughout the meal, refilled drinks and offered to refill the broth; was very attentive overall.",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,3,1,5,KzAGd8WvWDZAPie3vAMhSQ

I actually really liked the food, atmosphere and service here! Oh and the prices is not all that bad at all. 

I order the Strawberry Lemonade not to get mistaken for the Pink Lemonade and it was sooo good. The Wings came out hot and crispy with sweet dipping sauce, yes it was not full of ""in your face"" flavor but it was pretty good and you get a good amount. The popcorn five spice chicken had great flavor and the hot pots were fun as well as pretty yummy. I liked it because I was looking for a healthier alternative for dinner and the variety really help with having something a different to have. 

The people here is super friendly and helpful. Place is super cute and cozy. I will definitely come came here again oh and the mince pork rice was my favorite. For those of you out there who had the Bariatric surgery the Hot Pot here is a great option. The soup is not too salty or sugary and there is way more then enough protein in it to fill you up.

Service was great. Super friendly and attentive. Not sure if its a family ran restaurant but they seemed to have plenty of workers and the food came out in a timely manner.

2355779,2017-03-24,0,tA5mqEP68qjbTFK9c14D7A,"Taiwanese hot pot is great for when you're craving something soupy, and this restaurant has a one-size pot that can be shared or for an individual. Pot Tea Social House is a good pick that's located in the Southwest area near Mountain's Edge/Rhodes Ranch, which is nice if you don't want to go to Chinatown.

I've enjoyed my choices so far, and have favorited the rib eye beef, seafood & tofu, and the Japanese miso. For each pot ordered you have one carb choice, which I highly recommend the minced pork rice that has a lot of flavor and pairs well with the broth. For spice level I usually get a mild or medium, and ask for the chili on the side to add in since it seems to add a different taste to the soup (SO good!) The portion size is very generous, and a pot is more than enough to share with two people and even to have leftovers since the servers will come by with more broth.

I've gotten the popcorn chicken twice before and thought it was average and something that can be skipped, however my favorite appetizer here is the konnyaku spicy cold noodles. The first time I tried this was in July 2016 when it was on a special menu, I recently ordered this and while it was not on a menu, I hope that these noodles will be a permanent option soon!

A regular entree will run about $14. The service is good and attentive. I think the decor is cute with the bamboo in the entrance area, and I like the bench seat options.

I just couldn't get over the stench. If I had a weak sense of smell, I could probably tolerate it. It tasted bland too. I didn't like the dipping sauce it came with either. I won't take off any stars for this dish because I anticipated that I wouldn't like the smell before I tried this dish. When it comes to delicacies, a lot of people don't like it the first time. 

Anyway, all hot pots are now $12.99 except for the lobster hot pot. I ordered the ribeye medium spicy. It wasn't that spicy. I should have gotten extra spicy. Something was missing in the flavor. I'm not sure exactly what was lacking but it was a little on the bland side. I like that I get my individual hot pot though. Depending on how much you eat, one hot pot is more than enough if you're a fatty or enough for two petite girls.

I had to get dessert to cleanse my palate after trying stinky tofu. I ended my dinner with their strawberry, mango, condensed milk shaved ice topped with salted caramel. I wanted to like their specialty but unfortunately I ended up liking dessert the best.

We ordered boba milk tea, which was delicious (I hadn't had milk tea in over a year and it definitely hit the spot), though it would have been nice if they had different milk tea flavor options. They had about 15 beverage/tea flavors, but only one milk tea option. 

Our hot pots came out and we were informed that the heat could be turned off at any point if it got too hot. About 10 minutes in, I was nearly sweating because the heat being kicked out of that small metal cup, so I requested mine be shut off. I regretted that decision two minutes later when my food got very cold very quickly, but I was almost done anyway so it wasn't that big of a deal.

We ordered
1) popcorn chicken= horrible. Most of the fried pieces were of cooked pieces of batter and not of chicken. It was also served kinda cold and it was truthfully tasteless.
2) Beef hot pot- zero spice= the soup and broth was super bland. large pieces of squid balls, lots of meat, radish, carrots (wouldn't get this again)
3) Taiwanese seafood hot pot- BROTH was a BOMB and super flavorful!!! we ordered spice level 3. Not spicy, just the right amt of spice esp for me, a person who doesn't like spicy at all. Had a chuck of pigs blood, taro, seafood, squid balls and what looked like ramen instant noodle- which was confusing and a little off setting that they would serve that in the hot pot (at least get authentic noodles)

2660199,2014-04-26,0,tA5mqEP68qjbTFK9c14D7A,"This spot just had a soft opening so my friends and I decided to check it out. It's in a nice location on Rainbow, right by Oyshi. We came in and were greeted immediately by the hostess. There was only one other table of guests in the restaurant, so they weren't very busy at all. Understandable since they're brand new. We were told their grand opening will be in May, so hopefully business will pick up for them. 

Let's get to the food. We ordered the sweet potato fries, popcorn chicken, and chicken wings to start with. Sweet potato fries were okay, not my favorite. The popcorn chicken and chicken wings were pretty amazing. Both were crispy and very flavorful, especially with the sweet chili sauce that it came with. For our hot pot, we ordered the rib eye, which was delicious. There were three of us there and it was enough for all of us. The cool part is that when you run out of broth, they'll refill your pot with fresh broth. And the pot is heated up the whole time it's at your table so it doesn't get cold. For dessert, we tried the cheesecake and the salted caramel ice cream. Both were pretty tasty separately, but together, they were amazing.

As far as service goes, the staff was great and attentive the entire time we were there. The owner, Wendy, was kind enough to stop by at our table and ask for our input on what we ate. We had a nice chat about their food and she was very sweet and recommended that we try the stinky tofu next time. Our server, Ariana, was awesome and friendly. The other servers that helped were also great. I'm looking forward to many more visits to this place!

Also... bring cash! The one and only downside was they were only taking cash at the time, which was understandable. We had cash, so it wasn't a huge inconvenience at the time. I'm assuming they'll start taking credit cards eventually, so hopefully they'll have that taken care of by the time they have their grand opening.",O_CJTNcF9iO_wfsdWDD-1w,8,2,5,N4b40xHyLq3PcC6ktnJtvw

This restaurant though is quite serious about it's casual but modern design and it's awesome food.  You enter into a large space that is bright, casual yet tasteful, a mixture of rustic wooden tables and benches with more industrial chairs.  Coupled with very warm and attentive service, this place is perfect for families and dates. Personally I am not a huge fan of shabu-shabu or hot pots, but this place has definitely converted me into a wanna-repeat customer.  (Thanks for bringing me here wifey!)

From 11am-2pm, you get free green or black tea with your lunch which you can have sweetened or unsweetened.  We had the Taiwanese popcorn chicken and my hubby, son and I LUVED it.  Popcorn chicken can be so boring and hard and chewy but these have a delicate crunch and light but savory seasoning and it comes with basil leaves.  Mmmmmm.  I ordered 2 plates and didn't get to take any home.  My friend ordered the chicken wings and I didn't feel like trying them coz it looked dry and they didn't care for it too much either, said there wasn't much flavor in the chicken itself so you can skip this.  

For the bowls, hubby had the Rib Eye and I had the Kimchi bowl.  Let's start off with my Kimchi bowl, when it was served in their adorable containers over a live fire, even with the mild spice level that broth was EXTREMELY spicy.  It was more manageable when I had the fire under my bowl put off but man, was I sweatin!  The broth was very tasty and I enjoyed the mix of meat, vegetables, seafood and pseudo-seafood elements in my bowl.  I had beef, shrimp, scallop, squid, mussel, clams... the works.  Add a few more meat toppings and 2 people can share this bowl with an extra cup of rice.  I definitely enjoyed both the filling and broth of my bowl much more than my husband's order, which I thought was quiet bland.  

However, they have this wonderful condiment pronounced ""sha tsa"" sauce which reminds me of a marriage between chili paste and bagoong (shrimp paste).  My friend said it's called Chinese barbecue sauce made with dried scallops.  It is very addicting and you can bump up the flavor of your hotpot to your liking.  

If you are into hotpots, sharing and clearing up a stuffy nose, definitely stop by this Pot Tea.  Teehee.  Seriously, they've got some good stuff!",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,0,0,4,yvA_SZ6ECwC91g4xWFWNRA

The hot pot it self was good, but unlike Boiling point, they didnt have many sauces to choose from, they had your basic chili oil and ponzu. I LIKE VARIETY. but the flavor of the broth was still delicious, in fact I think it has better flavoring than Boiling Point.

We started off with the fruit flavored green tea. I got passion fruit, hubby got strawberry. These were delicious!  Very sweet though. The flavor reminded me of Asian candy.  Like the bubblegum they sell at Sanrio. I had to pace myself since it was hot out!

We got the chicken wings and popcorn chicken. From the looks of the apps, I would've assumed I'd enjoy the popcorn chicken more, but I liked the wings way more.  Our 2-year-old are most of the wings. 

Hubby got rib eye hot pot and I got seafood hot pot.  I really liked it. I did feel I needed to add lots of sauce to get more flavor, but I appreciated that it wasn't too salty. It was boiling (as expected). I wish they had a way to blow out the fire underneath the pot before it burns out on its own. 

Our daughter ate all the fish and tofu out of my pot and loved it. 

I like the picnic style tables. They make it easier for my kid to fidget. 

I wish they sold beer and wine. Maybe I'm a lush, but i do enjoy a beverage with my dinner. I'm sure the license is pricey, so I'm not mad about it. 

Service was great. They even come around asking if you'd like more soup. We didn't need more, but it was a nice touch. Then service went a little downhill at the end.  I don't know if it's our luck, or if it's an off-strip Vegas restaurant thing, but we always seem to get held hostage waiting for our check. I hate having to ask for it. Bachi Burger is the worst with this, so Pot Tea didn't seem like such a bad wait. We sat there maybe 20 minutes (we've waited almost an hour to pay the bill at Bachi before so I guess this wasn't too bad).

I wasn't sure if it was due to a candle or air freshener, but my friend said it was their stinky tofu. I eventually got used the smell throughout my meal and it didn't bother me as much. 

Pot Tea offers milk teas, regular teas, appetizers and hot pot. I was excited to try Pot Tea in hopes of satisfying my Boiling Point cravings while in Vegas. Prices here are a tad bit higher. The hot pot comes in a metal pot and there's a flame underneath the pot to keep it boiling hot during your entire meal. If you want it turned off then just ask and they will do it for you. They are also really good about refilling your soup base with more soup. 

Hot pot lunch ($13.99) includes: 
- Green or black tea (sweetened or unsweetened)
- Your choice of steamed rice, minced pork rice or noodles
- Any of the hot pot options except the Lobster one. 

We started off with the chicken wings. They were crispy and super hot when they came out. I think they gave us some sort of sweet & spicy sauce on the side but we did not end up using it. I thought the wings were well seasoned on its own. 

I ordered the mild rib eye with noodles and a sweetened green tea. I think my friend ordered a mild pork & clam pot with the minced meat rice and a sweetened black tea. I was very surprised that the green tea was good. The tea flavor wasn't overly strong and it wasn't super sweet. There was a lot of stuff in the Rib Eye hot pot compared to boiling point but the soup base wasn't very good. It was spicy, but was lacking some salt or something.

Ordered
1) Taiwanese Sausage
-Sweet flavored sausage 
-I dipped in chili
-Dish was ok, I wouldn't be heartbroken if I never had it again

2) Beef Rib Eye Hot Pot and accompanied with rice and minced pork
-would definitely get again
-decent amount of veggies/meat/tofu etc
-feel free to order mild, medium, or hot
-would get again
-great flavor

3) Popcorn Chicken
-I recommend adding some chili for added flavor
-Dish was ok, but could use more flavor in the batter

4) Black tea with lavender aromatics
 -flavor was nice, but I could do this at home. Buy black tea packets and an aromatic infuser to add whatever you prefer
(Food 4 out 5 stars)

Service staff were friendly and constantly smiled. Pleasant, relaxed, and casual atmosphere.
(Because the staff were overly pleasant, I scored the venue 5 out of 5 stars)

pros: presentation of hot pot is good. flavor is decent. maybe the best boba in the neighborhood?

Food: I ordered the Seafood/ tofu hot pot level 3. It wasn't incredibly spicy ( but I can handle a lot of spice) but it was the PERECT amount! They don't go light on the ingredients either, every time I went into the pot there was more meat and veggies galore! Thank you for not being cheap on the ingredients. ( was told it's all fresh with no MSG too!) my BF ordered the Taiwanese spicy hot pot, I was envious of his noodles in his. I didn't ask but hopefully you can ask for noodles in any dish. It didn't matter too much because I was FULL and couldn't finish all of my meal but my BF was happy to help haha.

I ended up ordering the beef hot pot along with popcorn chicken, sweet potato fries, and strawberry shaved ice. My favorite part of the meal was seriously the sweet potato fries because of their taste, although it could have been crispier. The hotpot could have been way better in terms of the flavor of the broth (which was lacking) and the quality of the beef. The meat was chewy and tough. I also don't like the fact that they already put everything into the pot so the longer it takes you to eat, the more overcooked your food will be. Other places I've been to just keep everything separated from the broth so you can regulate how much you want to cook at a time. The strawberry shaved ice was okay at best, but it could have used more condensed milk. Once you finish the other layer, the inside is basically just ice. Other places don't skimp out as much for their toppings and flavorings. 

Overall, I wouldn't really recommend going here for their hotpot. There are some really good places in Chinatown so I suggest you look around that area.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,14,13,3,-mwfCw0JeP-MWc_keZNs1w

The popcorn chicken can either be an appetizer before your hot pot or you can get a platter that comes with rice, veggies and an over easy egg. 

They have a wide selection of hot pot sets to choose from. Ranging from lobster to rib eye to veggie to stinky tofu, you're sure to find something to choose The hot pot set comes in your own pot that is individually heated so you can choose how hot (or not) you want your soup to end up. Their broth's aren't jam packed with flavor though iirc so just be aware of that. It's no flavor explosion in your mouth but it's still pretty good.

They also offer several Taiwanese side dishes/appetizers like popcorn chicken, pork hock, stinky tofu, fries as well as a small selection of milk teas. (Which I haven't tried yet)

Especially this time of year, it's the perfect weather to slurp down some hearty hot pot! There is lots of parking in the lot for this restaurant",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,8,9,4,e6W_BTb3tHlAP94z_3hvGA

3884853,2016-11-19,1,tA5mqEP68qjbTFK9c14D7A,"OBSESSED. Las Vegas has a handful of hot pot restaurants, and Pot Tea Social is definitely on my top three. 

Food: they have a total of 11 different pots, ranging from rib eye beef to lobster and even a veggie delight pot to cater to the vegans/vegetarians. All their pots all filled with a delicious broth, various meats, various vegetables, and an option for steamed rice, minced pork or vermicelli on the side. If it's your first time, I highly recommend the rib eye beef pot with minced pork rice. That pot has a ton of stuff, like fish cake, tomatoes, cuttlefish ball, corn, quail egg, squid, etc. Don't be scared, all the flavors do go well together and it's literally the perfect meal for the fall/winter season. The meat to soup ratio is great, I was able to eat a spoonful of food with my soup, without having an uneven balance of soup or meat/veggie at the end. The minced pork is very unique because it's not too heavy but still juicy enough to eat with the ingredients in your soup. They also have appetizers like sweet potato fries, chicken wings, popcorn chicken, and deep fried stinky tofu. All around, it is a great fusion of Asian and American food. 

Service: I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and both times they were slow. The service is average and I can't say they are too personable because it depends on your server that day. They are quick with getting the food out and checking on you at least one to either refill your water or to turn off the fire. I have nothing to complain because they were nice and the restaurant is very clean. 

Overall: I took off a star because some of their broths could use more seasoning. I've only tried the rib eye beef pot, seafood & tofu pot, and Japanese miso pot. My friends and family have tried the others and they can be rather bland. All the pots are $11.99 each with exception of the lobster pot that is $19.99. It's on the pricer side in my opinion because the vegetables used are cheap and there are not enough meat in the pot to justify for $11.99. I recommend to try this place if you're new to eating hot pot or just want a small meal (and spend $7 more at an AYCE hot pot place for a real hot pot experience).",TJZ773c6IobB29sEwkBAyg,3,3,4,VZ2AhixtZronyWbCWyi-rg

As we were leaving, she caught up with us and escorted our huge group out the restaurant.

They have a very diverse menu, with plenty of options! You also choose the level of spiciness for your own hot pot. In addition to the hot pot, you get the option of either plain rice, minced pork over rice, or vermicelli as a side. The minced pork over rice and vermicelli are probably your best bets (plus they're worth more). I ordered the Rib Eye Beef Pot with vermicelli and it was delicious! The tofu and the fish balls were my faveees. There was a decent amount of beef but it could use a bit more vegetables. The broth was pretty good and yes, you can ask for a soup refill!

Coming from SoCal, I was spoiled with having Boiling Point (which is very similar to Pot Tea) so it's hard NOT to compare.

The waitress kindly offered multiple times to continue to add additional broth to our pot which i was pleased about. I cant say the broth is the most flavorful as others have said but thats why you get the sauce on the side to add to taste just like making a broth at home. I prefer it this way as everyone is different with their spice levels and the kitchen cat make it spot on for everybody. Another nice surprise was the lunch special with the free green/black tea between 11-2 on weekdays i think, i didnt take advantage of it this time around but ill surely try that next time.

I've been a regular at this restaurant, until today, I don't know if I'll ever go back....first of all, they changed their menu, all the hot pots are all increased with no improvement, so instead of $11.99, then $12.99, and now $13.99, they took away the lotus root that I really like, meat quality was downgraded significantly, it has so much weird looking fat on it I cannot even chew(actually I don't even think it's fat, it looks like the cow has cancer or whatever worst part of meat you can think of) also, the free drink is now offered only Monday through Friday, not during weekend.  I got some pop corn chicken, it's literally 90% batter and ONLY 10% chicken meat, for $5.99, I'd say it's pretty darn expensive and totally not worth it, it seems they offered you such good deal up front, but now they are slowly taking away things, if they think they can fool the loyal customers like this they are totally wrong, I'm really disappointed about the whole thing and will not come back.


Reivew from about 6 month ago

I went there twice already and really enjoyed the whole experience, owner Wendy is super friendly and sweet, to me, service is the most important thing, I like their pop corn chicken a lot, very juicy inside,  however, I wish they could change the name to ""salt-and-pepper chicken"" or ""Crunchy salt-and-pepper chicken"", so people who are new to it won't think it's the same as KFC pop corn chicken.  fried basil is a great touch!  I like the hot pot so far, but I wish the ""super spicy"" level could be a bit more spicier, but I know they want to play safe, I also wish there's more sauce option, such as garlic, chopped green onion, and wish they used the most popular Taiwanese BBQ sauce instead of generic brand(yes I can tell the difference).  They have a lot of ingredients in hot pot and I really like it, you feel what you paid is worth it with drink and rice, and an order of pop corn chicken and a pot is actually just enough for 2(you can always have extra side order)

Another thing I wish they could improve(hey I know I complained a lot, but that means I care and want them to be better!), I wish they could change the dining ware from cheap plastic to ceramic bowl, plastic will actually release harmful chemical upon touching hot temperature that is known to cause cancer, and we are talking about boiling hot pot here........might be urban legend, but why risk it, I do like it they use stainless steel chopstick though! By the way, it's cash only, but it's good because it makes me think more carefully not to order too many thing! would be awesome if they take credit card though!  Don't expect the quality to be like from back home, but it's good considering I'm so far away from home and yup, I will definitely come back!

We were given non spicy when mild was ordered, although the waiter was very accommodating in bringing out extra spices for us to add to our liking. Never order the hot pot not spicy.

VERY Minute amount of flavor even when we dumped in a whole bowl full of spiced oil and peppers. This lack of flavor was a huge turn off for me.

The server took our drink orders and we got mango green tea & wintermelon. I had the mango tea with lychee jelly and it was good.  We also ordered popcorn chicken and wings for our starters.  The food did not take long at all.  Maybe around 10 minutes or less which is a decent time.  We ordered our soups.  The kimchi soup medium spicy, and seafood soup.  We shared because the pots are pretty big. The soups come with either vermicelli, minced pork and rice, or rice.  We got pork and rice which was so DELICIOUS!!!!!! The kimchi soup was pretty good.  It contained various seafoods and I believe it was sliced beef & of course the kimchi.  The seafood pot had all kinds of seafood from clams, mussels, crab, fishcake, etc.  Both soups tasted great.  Now the popcorn chicken was my second favorite next to the pork rice.  So yummy and crispy!!! The wings were good and cooked perfectly. Very juicy and crispy.  

I am actually craving the popcorn chicken as i type this out.  I spent only $60 on everything which is pretty decent. Apps were $6 and pots were $13 i think? But great deal, great location, and great food!!!",SyX94Qkpowm_9dsn1SDrCQ,3,3,5,hBNOwcZNxy_4Xkz6FTvvJg

Had the credit card machine been working last night, we would've tried it. We ordered the Pork & Clam pot, one pot with stinky tofu (name escapes me), and popcorn chicken. The broth from the Pork & Clam was our favorite. 

As for the popcorn chicken, I'd say it is so-so. Doesn't taste exactly like the one from Ay-Chung, other Taiwanese eateries in LA, or the food stands on the streets of Taipei.

One criticism I have is the lack of dipping sauces. Pot Tea only has 2: Sacha & Ponzu. Come on.....it's a hot pot place. You need more than 2 dipping sauces! Also, please provide chopped green onions and cilantro, too! On the other hand, they must be commended for offering minced pork over rice as one of your carb choices with no extra charge. Nice touch.

The one thing that is a FIVE is the service. The staff is very attentive and polite with them constantly checking on us.",HxdCh7lvfe86M8eQ7qeb8A,5,3,4,PAAoraVrmTCBfYYjDaDvpQ

Traditionally hot pot is served with a verity of dipping sauces. This place didn't have any that I seen maybe I needed to ask? Not too sure. The highlight for me was the minced pork rice.

The servers are friendly, and they always come by and check up on you and your hot pot. You can get your fire turned off after a while, but I love piping hot food, so I always let mine burn until it's gone. They even offer extra broth at no charge!

The popcorn chicken is amazing, as Taiwanese popcorn chicken tends to be, and the milk tea is nothing to scoff at either. As for the hot pots, they're all very good. You might have to do a little bit of experimenting to figure out which one you like the best, but they all offer a unique flavor and a wide variety of ingredients. My two favorites are the Pickled Mustard Lamb hot pot and the Miso hot pot.

After looking at the menu I noticed the price was now $13.99 but oh well.. I was already there. 
We ordered one Ribeye Hotpot and one miso.
For sides, minced pork rice which was really good and some vermicelli Noodles. 
The Ribeye broth had very little flavor,  while the miso broth was really good.  
We also got an extra order of taro and Ribeye for $3 and $4. I though it was kind of strange how the meat was already cooked. That means you're re heating the meat in your  soup and most likely it will come out over cooked.. 
The taro being pre boiled was convenient though since you don't have to wait too long for it to soften.  This place is decent but I prefer Chinese style Hotpot where you pick and cook your own meats and veggies.

I ordered the medium spicy seafood and tofu. Major downside, it wasn't spicy period so it was really bland. Probably next time I'll try spicy, to see if there's a difference.  However I do like the amount and variety of seafood they put into the hotpot. There's crab,  mussels,  clams, scallops, fish, shrimp, squid. My favorite part of the whole dish was the tofu actually.  Don't know why,  but it tastes really good dipped in their soy sauce chili paste mixture.  Which is another downside, their dipping sauce is nothing special, its the same sauce you would eat with dim sum. They don't have a signature garlic sauce like boiling pt or jackpots. 

The rice with minced pork was very tasty and is probably the true seller here. My sister ordered that while I ordered the vermicelli, which wasn't very good. The noodles were kinda hard even when dumped into the hotpot to cook further.  

Overall service was good, our server came by and explained everything on the menu and pointed out their popular dishes. She was super attentive and poured me more broth when it was getting too low. I really appreciate that. I would come back again to try the other hotpots. They are located super close to my house,  so it's very convenient.

So when Pot Tea Social House popped up, I was super excited to check it out.  It took over the New Day Café, so it was interesting to see what they did with this casual breakfast joint.  I was pleasantly surprised with how they changed the look and feel of the place.

The menu is very detailed, which makes it easy for those new to the hot pot world.  You know what you're getting upfront, so no random things in your soup show up.

The Husband and I chose to share one pot:

#9 Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot ""Sliced Lamb, Sour Pickled Mustard, Daikon, Tofu, Carrot, Fish Ball, Fish Fillet, Lotus Root, Cuttlefish Ball"" ($11.99) with the waiter-recommended Minced Pork Rice (other choices are Steamed Rice or Vermicelli).  When the hot pot arrived, it looked great!  However, as we dove further in, we noticed not too much pickled mustard in the soup.  What's the point of calling it Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot if there's not much of the main ingredient present?  The server came by to shut off the fire and didn't really hear me when I suggested lowering it instead.  (Or perhaps lowering it wasn't an option?)  As a result, our soup got cold quickly.  Therefore, you don't really want to drink the broth when you're done.  The accompanying Minced Pork Rice was a really small portion and it would cost $2 more for another bowl.  We chose the medium spice level, and it wasn't too spicy.  

We also ordered the Taiwanese Pork Hocks Stew ($5.99).  Biggest mistake ever.  They were the driest and toughest ham hocks I have ever had.  The term 'stew' is misleading because it's not tender at all! I could barely pull any edible bits off and I needed some major flossing when I was done attempting to extract some meat off those things.

Another appetizer we tried was their Fried Stinky Tofu ($5.99).  Average, not really stinky or memorable.  I should mention Sweet Potato Fries ($5.99) were also on the menu - totally random in my opinion.  And I looked around, and not many people finished their order of it.

Overall, Pot Tea Social House was an okay food experience.  I guess I would go back again if I was too lazy to drive down to Spring Mountain.

Pot Tea is one of the few authentic Taiwanese food joints in the Southwest (and really Las Vegas overall).  Their signature item(s) is the hotpot, which is essentially a selection of protein and preset veggies put cooked in an individual pot in front of you.  

We went at noon on a Wednesday and the store was completely empty.  For some reason, the store reeked of sewer....though it was a wave of nostalgia of the Taipei night markets.  I ordered their $13 ribeye hotpot, which came with the broth, ribeye, and veggies in the individual pot and a choice of white or minced pork rice.  I found the broth to be plain and probably only 5 thin slices of meat inside the soup.  The rest of the soup was veggies.

We arrived a little before 5pm on Saturday (12/27/14) and it was empty! I was scared because I chose this location for my boyfriend's family to try since I love hot pot. They ended up enjoying it so yay! Unlike BP's hour wait, we had no wait here. Perfect. A lot more people arrived after us and the place began to fill up. 

FOOD:
My bf and I had the ($20) Lobster Hot Pot. It was good. The shells were pre-cracked so it was easy to open (I think). He didn't let me open it. We got minced pork rice with it, but I wish all the pots came with noodles already like BP. He can't handle spicy, so they gave me a spicy soup base on the side. Nice! So I adjusted the spiciness in my bowl to my liking. Unless you're really hungry, one pot is good enough to share between two people. They refill your broth if you need it. 

His parents has the rib-eye hot pot and they seemed to enjoy it. Price is actually a bit cheaper than BP. Popcorn chicken was yummy. Needed a dipping sauce though. 

SAUCE:
The two sauces are a Ponzu sauce and a chili bean paste(?) sauce. They were good but I like BP's side sauces better. 

TEA: 
SO GOOD! I'm spoiled by LA's tea shops, but I enjoyed this. I got the lychee black tea and it was delicious. I believe the waitress said their tea were imported from Taiwan(?). BF got mango green tea and it was yummy but I liked my choice better. His dad got a tea latte and it looked really good. Wish I got to try it!

SERVICE:
Service was wonderful. Since we were first and it was less crowded, service was very attentive and nice. The waiter and waitress were really helpful since it was our first time there. She explained things thoroughly and said we could sub things in our hot pot if we wanted, which is something you can't do at BP! The Filipino waiter said something to me in Tagalog (possibly thank you) because I guess I blended in with my bf's family haha. He was very polite to my bf's parents. Basically, they were great! 

It was a different experience from LA's Boiling Point; I enjoyed it. Loved the no wait!! Like the other reviewer said, they're both different and they're both good. And don't forget a stamp card if you're a Vegas local!",8D41ePS63qHsbrIs8vVq7w,1,1,4,vrk4OycG-crTuLD8eU5oZw

The waitress was super young so she forgot a lot of things and we had to ask for things twice but she was very nice.... Just forgetful??

Each pot is 12.99. And they actually had a variety of flavors. I'm surprised but they had stinky tofu, spicy Taiwanese, seafood, veggie, beef, pork etc. it also comes with vermicelli, plain rice or minced pork rice. The mince pork rice was a bonus for me because it was really yummy. I normally order vermicelli but at this place I'll always order the rice. 

I got the beef pot. The portion size was good. With good portion of meat, cabbage, Fish cake, corn, tomato, enoki mushroom and tofu. It also had preserved pickled veggies in it that gives the broth a different flavor. The soup was not too flavorful. It doesn't have that beef or pork bone flavor that boiling point has. It's lighter actually. However, the more I ate it the more I like it.

Their pork blood cake was mushy and had more rice than anything... I like that better because I don't really like the taste of pork blood. 

If this was in LA I would give it 2 maybe 3 stars but it's the only one I know of in vegas so far. So I'll definitely come back because it hit the spot. But I've  had better. :(",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,2,4,LdLOYMZMhs8BXSySv1HTWg

I appreciated how fast the food came and they gave us my rice with pork (which was sooo yummy) before all the other food so my one year old daughter can start eating. They also gave us a large appetizer plate of chicken wings for free for checking them out for the first time. It was a great experience. Coming from suburban Chicago, we have checked out a few restaurants here in Vegas that got good Yelp! reviews but were still disappointed by either the service or the food.

We ordered taiwanese popcorn chicken hoping it would taste the same as 'Kara Age' a japanese crispy chicken but to our disappointment, it tasted nothing special. The chicken wings were good though! 

The rib eye hot pot was flavorless and I'm glad we did not order two of them. I won't be coming back again just because the food did not meet my expectations and were a bit pricey for the size.

I ordered the lobster hot pot in mild spice and it was really good. The lobster didn't have much flavoring inside, but it balanced well with the pork broth added. The lobster took up most of the space, but it is perfect for lobster lovers!

Next, I ordered the Japanese Miso pot in medium spice. It was tad bit spicy, but it was delicious. It becomes more spicy when it is boiling, so you can turn off the fire to make it less spicy. 

The service was nice and very friendly. I also got a stamp card! In addition, the pricing is good and on the cheap side.

My #1 favorite thing about this place is that it serves BOBA! It's so hard to find a boba tea place around this area.. 

Anyway, I always go with the classic Spicy Beef combination. This place is not stingy by any means. They always pack my hot pot with tons of veggies and meat. The soup is also packed with flavor, and the side of minced pork rice is YUMMY!

The last time I went with friends, we also ordered the Lobster hot pot. There was a huge tail sticking out of my hot pot! It was so cool! But probably because the nature of it being in a hot pot, the tail eventually became overcooked and was chewy. But I can't complain.. it's a lobster tail, sitting in boiling hot soup for a long time.  Of course it'll be chewy.

The only thing I can complain about is: #1 I am so used to eating hot pot with more variety in sauces.. like having sesame oil, minced garlic, a sweet asian bbq sauce.. etc.. I like to mix my own concoction for my sauce and this place doesn't give you that option. You only get the choice of one sauce, and soysauce. 

#1 complaint is.. I prefer my broth to be a bit sweeter. The broth at Pot Tea Social House is more on the salty side. But that's just a personal preference. My fiance loves salty, so he has no qualms about the broth at all!

Overall, it's clean and tasty here. I will come back.. and HAVE been coming back!

Now one of my sisters is really picky. Because the other two are substantially younger than us, they copy us. My sister turned up her nose at everything on the menu and so did they. That's how we ended up with 3 orders of popcorn chicken at $5.99 a piece, a BOGO boba for the younger two, and 1 Taiwanese beef hot pot for $11.99.

My hot pot was okay. It was really full and both of the younger two kids each ended up liking what they tried. I think it was because it was novel and I made a big deal about all the different stuff in the pot. 

So why 2 stars? The chicken tasted straight up RANCID. For $18 worth of popcorn chicken, it should be pretty great. Plus, isn't popcorn chicken one of those high turnover items? Did they think we wouldn't notice that that's NOT how chicken is supposed to taste? It was really questionably bad, especially because I could taste the rancid flavor despite being deep fried and piping hot. Imagine the smell of chicken that has gone bad. Now eat that smell. That's how it tasted.

They've got a number of different hotpots to try. Between #1 and #2 I went with the seafood and tofu hotpot while my friend went with the other one. 

The last time I had hotpot was at boiling point in Cali and I was disappointed with mine. This had the right amount of napa cabbage for me not to get annoyed with. I felt like they weren't trying to take my money with mostly cabbage. It was a great combination of different seafood items and meat :D. Also had a piece of crab and two pieces of shrimp. 

Looking forward to other crazy random chilly days to try it out. Not that you have to since the AC feels like it's cranked up so it's pretty cold in there (for me since I get cold really easily). Definitely coming back soon to try the other pots. 

My server, Sae, was such a sweetheart. She's great, sociable, and such a sweetheart. She found things of interest to talk about that didn't make me feel like you're just trying to make small talk for the heck of it. She was genuine.

Decor is nice and simple and so is the menu. 5 appetizers, about 10 different ""pots"" , about 6 or 8 types of tea and the desert of the day. I ordered the seafood pot, it had real crab, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp and fish. The flavors were clean, you can taste every ingredient and know they are fresh and the broth was perfect... Pair that with steam rice topped with delicious minced pork and the highly addictive ""milk tea"", which in my opinion was better than Thai iced tea. Oh, and let's not forget the service which was outstanding! If anything, I think the employees try a little too hard, but that's understandable, since as a new business they want to make the best first impression. I was impressed. They got me. I'm a fan!",X_liEerKb33-EogeagGqzQ,2,1,5,0xPmok3xL_bn2U_rmNH3Qg

I am completely obsessed with hotpot, and even more, obsessed with hotpot that offers stinky tofu!  my last meal on earth, i would ask for stinky tofu hands down.  

Ordere the fried stinky tofu and the stinky tofu hotpot that comes with your choice of rice, vermicelli and something else (this is unusual as most other places charge extra for that).  

Plenty of food, the broth is amazing, i got medium spicy, very manageable and delicious.  The waitresses were so attentive and sweet, really makes a place way more likable. They are always checking to make sure you have enough water, soup, and if you want the fire out- all VERY VERY important when having hotpot :)  

will definitely be back again!",FzT-ujff-c11Wa_WdItwig,1,1,5,wrMz4qUDM8hURBN3iA_SXw

She was very welcoming and friendly. My friends and I ordered the Korean, miso, beef, and the popcorn chicken. They were all delicious! I especially love the miso hot pot and their milk tea! You have the option to chose rice,minced pork rice, or noodles with your hot pot. I've chosen the pork rice because she said it was the most popular. The rice was amazing! I think I would go their just to order that amazing rice!! The minced pork had so much flavor. I'm craving it right now as I'm typing this :(  my favorite hot pot would have to be the miso hot pot. It just tasted great, not too watery and had lots of flavors going on. Each hot pot came with veggies, shrimp, and a crab claw. The hot pot itself is good for one person if you're super hungry or for two people that have small appetites. 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone that's in the area! It's worth a try!!! You won't be disappointed.",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,2,2,5,N9d6436bprpKz8tug7XH7Q

They had been already cleaning up and getting ready for closing since it was not busy. But they welcomed us in and they didn't give us any attitude. They were very patient with us too! The food was amazing, I got the kimchi pot and it was delicious and they give you a lot of it too! The waiters were so sweet telling us to take our time eating, but I still felt bad.

I tried both the kimchi pot and the Taiwanese pot. The menu looked good enough, but the broth is just not very flavorful and everything else in the soup don't seem very fresh. I am not a super fan of boiling point in LA, but I like their pots so much better. Overall, service was good, and food was fast. I probably won't drive 30 min to come to this place, due to the lack of flavor and freshness.",oK1v-yP9ygKWg6M19wWYIQ,2,1,3,ugmr_7IZiuLyfNxCFLnHfQ

Juni who is very attentive and asks us more than 3 times how we like the food and is there anything he can get for us!! 

4.5 stars for the interior.
Very clean, neat, and spacious environment to dine in. 

3 stars for the food.
Other than the popcorn chicken, other food is mediocre. The broth of hot pots is light, and the portion is poor.",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,3,2,3,Kz7ZXG1v622WV-1ZJ9iI1A
5860233,2014-07-15,1,tA5mqEP68qjbTFK9c14D7A,"Food: We ordered the chicken, which was so yummy. Reminded me of Chinese crispy pork flavor for some reason. 
I had the Japanese miso (spicy level medium). I thought it was a good sized portion with a variety of vegetables some seafood and pork. I had also ordered an extra side of beef, which I thought was also a good sized portion. If you like spicy, I didn't think that the medium level was that spicy either. 
Drinks: I got plain black tea which I loved. And my boyfriend got lychee tea which was sweet and super good! 
We also got the strawberry tea, which wasn't that sweet but it was alright. I liked the lychee tea the best. 
Service:The service was just alright. We had came later in the night around 9, so the server we had was pretty preoccupied with sweeping the floors.  Other than that, everything was great! Would definitely come back again!!",sENjMdWptgy0rMpzSSSx6g,2,1,4,7MOObzB-zSPDFIaGOhW8ew

The first time I ordered the rib eye and loved it. It was loaded with veggies and beef, and the flavor was clean. Recently, I ordered the seafood pot and I was just a tad disappointed. It seems like the portion has gotten smaller. It is still good but with the higher price and no complementary drink for lunch, I don't think it is worth it. 

I do like the option that you can substitute the pork with beef since I don't eat pork much.",bIhhH7SURXRZzI4RVOG91g,2,1,3,6W_Ik9c-YgFnW33ZaGQWHg

I ordered the seafood and tofu hot pot with some Ramen noodles on the side plus it also comes with some steamed rice and ground pork on top. The Hot Pot itself was priced at about 12 bucks not a bad deal! It came with sliced meat, fish balls, crab, shrimp, mussels etc it was just really tasty Hot Pot that was small enough for one person with some leftovers as well. My total with a hot pot and extra noodles plus tip for the waiter is around 20 bucks! I will definitely be back for more hot pot yumminess!",xIjw368KoWqmAZ7JUrwf3A,4,3,5,S0riZwIBCoH5YL2PrT25ug

I was happy to find a Taiwanese-styled hot pot place in Vegas. If you're ever in the area and looking for a delicious hot pot meal, I'd definitely reccomend Pot Tea Social House.

Service? ON POINT! They were super awesome!

I ordered the Rib Eye Beef Pot with pork and rice and the Chicken Wings. The Rib Eye Beef was delicious! However, it was overshadowed by the side of rice with pork on top of it. 

I tried to like the chicken wings, but I just couldn't. It didn't taste too good and it had a weird after taste. I thought maybe the chicken was old, or if the oil they cooked it in was bad. Regardless, I wouldn't order this again.

Great place though! I'd come again.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,2,1,4,A2ic7N-h0LQqDIXjG1vCtA

I went with the spicy beef hot pot and my fried ordered the lobster hot pot as well as a chicken wing appetizer. The wings came out first and they were tiny. They looked dry, but were surprisingly moist. They lacked any sort of flavor and definitely needed a little more seasoning or sauce. 

The hot pots came out and they were surprisingly large. I'm not well-versed in this cuisine but after my dining companion mentioned the lack of dipping sauces (they only offer two) it definitely felt lacking. More options would have helped quite a bit, I think. My spicy beef was actually quite spicy and flavorful. Opting for the vermicelli noodles over rice helped retain all the flavor from the broth. 

Despite the spiciness level being right on, nothing else about our meal was particularly memorable. Everything  was just ok. My friend seemed less than enthused with her lobster hot pot and said she regretted getting rice instead of vermicelli. 

The place is new, so I cut them some slack as far as service. They were busy and the severs seemed to be trying their best. Everyone was really nice, so I give them kudos for that.

Make sure you bring cash, since they are currently cash only.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,6,3,iJ_BwdRc1-k6_xka0jsyXQ
