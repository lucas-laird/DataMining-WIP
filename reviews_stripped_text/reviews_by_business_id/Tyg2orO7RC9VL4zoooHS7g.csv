49518,2012-11-17,0,Tyg2orO7RC9VL4zoooHS7g,I was ono for Chicago style pizza so I found this restaurant on Yelp.  The person who took my order was very nice and most of all got my order and address correct.  The driver with a smile delivered my hot pizza in 30 minutes.  I'm not from Chicago and know only of the Bay Area Deep dish pizza places.   I found Rosati's pizza delicious and it surely satisfied my craving for Deep dish pizza.  I would recommend this restaurant and will order from there again when in town.,TkK25uHvxuHHvUPUFoqFSQ,0,0,4,iQiOOtdsCl7qnkxz99FqSw

1169512,2013-01-13,1,Tyg2orO7RC9VL4zoooHS7g,"Pricey and not worth it. 12 wings and a 12"" combo pizza set me back 35 bucks with tip. I'd totally be ok with the price if it was quality or unique. The pizza lacked toppings and the cheese used was government cheese. The wings were soggy and disguisting. The delivery guy forgot to bring Parmesan cheese and red pepper. Avoid this place at all costs.  Not worth it and not good.

In my mind pizza needs to hold any 2 of the following 3 qualities:
1.Taste good
2. Unique
3. Cheap 

It was none of the 3, that's why I'm giving it 1 star. Sadly fast food pizzas ( pizza hut, dominos, and even hot n ready lil caesars) are better than this crap.

I'm not a pizza snob in any way. I'll eat a grab-n-go Little Caesars, Papa Johns, shoot, gimme a Mama Celeste or Totino's and I'm good with that. That said, when you want a little better pizza, one that packs a little more punch on the palate, then Rosati's is a great option. Definitely not a chain restaurant pizza. Their sauce is delicious, they put a perfect amount of cheese, and most importantly the crust is outstanding. The only negative I would say is that they put the pepperoni under the cheese. Personally, I'm not a fan of that, I like it to crisp up on the outside. I made the request to have it on the outside on my most recent visit and they happily obliged. Their pizza is a little more costly compared to a Papa John's or Domino's, but they do have some pretty solid daily specials that I would reccomend. For $20 I got two medium two-topping pizza's which was enough pizza to feed 5 people and have a decent amount of left overs.

It wasn't until a friend of mine brought some deep dish pizzas from Rosati's that i learned to love it. The deep dish pizza here has the right amount of cheese and toppings and it will definitely make you full. It's really hard for me to go back to eating a regular pizza after trying this. Been going to rosati's ever since for the deep dish. Save a trip to strip and go try Rosati's.,iPceDCz6O2__AZK00w4gQw,0,0,4,9qsg9mgx6rAqh-5PiJMbRw

I've had three incidents where things did not go well. The first time was I asked for green peppers on my pizza and the girl asked me what kind of peppers so I said sweet because when you're from Chicago green peppers sweet peppers. I got a pizza that had sugary Green peppers on it. So I called and they gave me a credit. The second time I ordered a stuffed cheese pizza and it was about the same size as a regular I took pictures offered to bring them in but they gave me a credit. This happened in the span of about five years so considering how much I order that wasn't too much of a big deal. On Valentine's Day I ordered And the pizza was undercooked ,very much so. It was not the pizza I have come to know. I called and spoke with a manager I cannot remember his name I believe it was a Hispanic name. When I told him it was under cooked his words were "" uh, I think I was the one that made that and I think it was done enough"" I told him that I have been getting pizza from this establishment for six years and it was not done and it was not what I have come to expect from there. He told me I would get a $15 credit. Mind you even after he told me he thought it was done enough I told him I understand that it could be under cooked as I'm sure they are overwhelmed since it's Valentine's Day I was making excuses for him. Today I went to use the credit and he told me he will not honor it as he has no record of it. This is what another young man told me. I told him the manager is the one they gave me the credit on Valentine's Day and he just said sorry he said no, not until A cashier can come in to verify it. I will not come back to that Rosatis.

When I got there, I said, ""how come I can order a large pizza from Pizza hut with all the toppings I want and yours is DOUBLE the price?""  
First she looked at me funny, like DUH, and then I pressed her more. Seriously explain it to me, help me understand. She babbled on about homemade, fresh, not frozen dough,  family business, blah blah.  She said she had worked at pizza hut and she guaranteed this was way better.  With the explanation she gave, I could understand $4-5 more, but not DOUBLE.  I said we'll see if its twice as good.  

So I got home,  took the first bite,  ok, not bad, I could tell the cheese was different,  good.  Then I took a bite with chicken.  I had to put the slice down and pull a piece of chicken off to inspect it to see if it was really chicken because it was crunchy!  I pulled another piece off to see if it was deep fried chicken,  no.  It was just half inch chunks of chicken sooooo overcooked and dry that they were almost impossible to chew.  My pizza hut chicken is cut strips of chicken breast moist and meaty.  The mushrooms on Rosatis were smaller and more black shading, like not as white and fresh as pizza hut. And the crust was THIN and burnt around the edges,  not soft and fluffy like pizza hut. 
So if you like, thin, dry, overcooked, overrated, overpriced,  pizza with decent cheese buy Rosatis, if you want classic, gooey, soft, moist pizza for half the price, stick with pizza hut.  

To be fair, everything else we've ever ordered from Rosatis is good, like pasta, ribs, shrimp, etc.   But they may want to rethink their pizza quality to justify twice the price.",nsZquYOxe6b_6x8MOKC-lA,0,0,2,9XABrQFVHexFNflQHPcOVw

The ciabatta on which the sandwich is served is good enough, but the bread's not as important when it's soggy from gravy. Fortunately, the au jus that Rosati's includes is more than good enough to make up for the underseasoned beef.

We wanted something simple, since we had a bunch of kids with us. When we checked in at the resort, they gave us a menu for Rosati's Pizza. It even had some family value coupons and they deliver. Spaghetti, Pizza & Wings it is then. 

The coupon ""Family Pasta Special"" ($25.99) was for (1) Family Spaghetti or Mostaccioli, (4) Bread Sticks, (6) Meatballs & a 2 litter soda. We chose the spaghetti w/ meat sauce. When they say ""family"" they mean big, large as in a full tray of spaghetti. That was not what I expected. And it was very very good. The bread stick was garlicky, also good. The meatballs were delicious. (A must order) Matched well with the spaghetti. Highly recommend this deal. 

Like I said, I didn't expect the special to be so much food, so I ordered more. 

Hawaiian Luau Pizza, Canadian Bacon & Pineapple. This was just okay for me. The kids loved it though. 

Buffalo Wings (24 pcs) Delicious. Fried to perfection. The sauce was not too vinegary (the way I like it) I could not stop eating them. Yummy!!

Fettuccine Alfredo was also a hit. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy without being too rich. Delicious 

Service was good. From the lady taking the order to the gentlemen who delivered it. Even got a courtesy phone call to tell me he was parking (it's hard to find parking where I'm staying) I appreciated that
