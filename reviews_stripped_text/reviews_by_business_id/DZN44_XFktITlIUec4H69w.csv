This place has all the appeal of a hot dog cart - but without the ability to see the dirty hot dog water. 
I came here for a hot dog - a Chicago dog to be exact. A good sized hot dog with plenty of toppings. When I looked at the menu and saw prices upwards of $6 for a Chicago dog I nearly turned around but I gave it a shot after the guy at the counter said it came with fries and a drink (an offering on the white board) for $7. 
The dog came good and warm along with a good portion of freshly chopped fries. The ""Chicago"" dog was somewhat disappointing though in that there were plenty of toppings but they were either really thinly sliced (a pickle spear i could see through) or sparse (2 small quarters of tomato, a spattering of neon relish). The hotdog was a good sized thickness dog (about an inch and a half in diameter) but barely filled the un-warmed bun. It ended up being an OK dog though and the fries were pretty good. For $7 I was satisfied - much better than a 7-11 or wienerschnitzel option. 
All in all I'd say if you are looking for somewhere new to try this place is a good stop. They seem to have a few other non hot dog offerings so I may have to go back. This is no ""gourmet"" or ""Chicago replica"" however I do not think. Just a hole in the wall joint that offers a fair deal on decent food.",4oUjcsnWbU13Ap8l05WF3g,0,0,3,h5_h35gRSPkTGNV2yBB9Mw
461749,2010-11-09,0,DZN44_XFktITlIUec4H69w,"I'm a Chicago native living in Vegas for a while now and I get the usual cravings for Chicago food.

I was in the mood for hot dogs tonight so I decided to try Tasty Dogs for the first time. 

I've read the other reviews here and I really wanted this place to be great, but unfortunately it didn't live up to them.

Although they had all the right ingredients, Vienna beef dogs, neon green relish, poppy seed buns, sport peppers, etc, the final dogs served to me were pretty sub par.

First- one of the buns had a stale end- like the end was hanging out of the package and dried up. How do you serve a customer a rock hard bun? Next they really skimp on the toppings, Two TINY slices of tomato (seriously looked like they sliced a cherry tomato as thin as possible. A pickle spear on the dog looked like it was shaved off the pickle with a vegetable peeler. Then just a bare minimum of the other toppings covered the dog.

I understand this stuff is mostly all shipped in from Chicago and it's expensive, but I'm paying a premium- the 2 dog special is $8.99 + tax!!! For that kind of money, give me a decent topped dog on a fresh bun! I felt pretty gypped.

The one good thing I can mention are the hand cut thin fries- very tasty.

I may go back and try the gyros and Italian beef and hope it gets made with a little more care. Maybe I just had an unusual bad experience.",u7Vf-xXa_yBw5XmevnTh4Q,1,0,2,hmWoGmLTwOgxfLwFuRCsag

I somehow even managed to get food poisoning from this place which ruined the rest of my day.   I don't mind paying for great food, but I have to agree that $9 for a poorly constructed dog and a few soggy fries is a bit much.  My pickle was a sliver which consisted of the outer SKIN of the pickle and very little else.  My bun broke because it was too dry, and it was generally a sloppy mess.  

I realize true vintage style often includes blackened door jams but I could have done without seeing the grime on the windows and walls.

Out of all the times I have eaten here, I only ordered the hot dogs so my review is strictly about them.

I miss Chicago-style hot dogs a lot and when I get a bad hankering for one, I will go here.  Yes, the prices are a bit high but you are paying for something not easily found in Las Vegas.  Also consider they have to ship in much of their stuff from Chicago such as the Vienna Beef Hot Dogs.

These hot dogs have the authenticity complete with poppy-seeded buns and Vienna Beef hot dogs.  The taste has always been right and the buns have never been stale.  They even serve Jay's Potato Chips!

I have also tried Bono's on Warm Springs and Chicago Hot Dogs on Rancho.  Neither are as good IMO.

That just didn't seem right.  But sitting in front of the computer now, with a belly full of hot dog, I've never been happier.  

And if a doctor instructs you to eat more hot dogs, there are few places in town serving a better frank than Chicago Tasty Dogs.  I've read the negative reviews on here, but my experience has been completely different.  This place serves up the best Chicago dog in town.  The tomatoes and onions were fresh, the relish was neon green, the pickle wedge sliced right, and two pickled sport peppers to top it all off.  And the Vienna Beef hot dog was perfect.

The chili cheese dog was pretty good--delicious cheese sauce, but the chili was just decent.  I'm not the biggest fan of the fries here, but I will say they are the closest thing to Chicago shoestring fries -- a little gritty, but crisp with a slight paper bag feel to them.

For those refugees from Chicagoland living in the desert, this place is home away from home.  The walls are covered in Chicago memorabilia.  And if you're missing the Windy City, this place will feel like home.

5 stars for the Chicago dog, their hot dogs in general, the cheese sauce, and great customer service.  Minus one star for high(er) fast food prices ($9-10 for 2 dogs, small fries and small drink) and mediocre fries.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,1,1,4,rTyQkiJ999SPLfcuxtA-Nw

I love Chicago dogs, and for awhile, this was the closest Chicago dog place to me. I will say that it has gotten better over the past year.

The hot dog itself is good. And they do Chicago-style right. But the ingredients aren't the best quality. The tomatoes are mushy and really thin slices, etc. The fries are ok. They're shoestring and sometimes undercooked.

The place is a little messy looking - tables not quite clean, etc. The Coke on the fountain machine is always ""out of order"". And they never seem to get my order right - though, this is usually to my advantage, giving me a free extra hot dog, etc.

The BF got a hamburger with fries that he enjoyed but didn't think it was great. Well, I know one thing- they know how to make delish hotdogs that are worth all those calories.

The hotdogs on the other hand were very good. I enjoyed the pepper they put on them, and the neon green relish is fun to look at.

Overall I would eat here again however at 10.00 for a 2 dog meal, It'll have to be on a day that I feel like splurging.

This place also sells their hotdogs that are imported from Chicago so you can have your own BBQ... next time I'm in there I'll check the prices of that and update this review.

They recently started giving out these cards that count how many times you've been there and then you get a free meal on the 11th visit. When they started doing it the guy retro-actively put two marks on it for me because he'd seen me twice before!

1. Biggest issue, I was told I could not just order a hot dog by itself.  I wanted just 2 dogs by themselves.  I was FORCED to either get 2 dogs with fries or 2 dogs with a drink at a cost of over $9.00

2.  The buns were not kept in a warmer so they were cold and the pickle was so cold it made the dogs cold.

3.  Very little seaseme seeds only on top so the buns are not the same as a traditional dog.

At Hot Dog Heaven which I will go to today, you can get a dog for about $2.75 without being forced to purchase anything else.  At the place above I was told that a hot dog with fries which is close to $6.00 that the only thing he can do is take .50 off which still makes a dog twice as much as a dog at hot dog heaven.
