With that being said, this place is amazing!! Diverse genres of music and an awesome venue. Go up an escalator and you're where the magic happens. Do you like to bowl, eat, and listen to music while drunk? Then this is your place. Gotta add, ordered a vodka redbull and they did not hold back on the alcohol. Brooklyn beers also available on tap.

The restaurant serves some good fried chicken from Blue Ribbon. Add some of their hot sauce or soak that ish' in honey and your set. Their fries with cheese and gravy are worth trying too but attack it immediately and eat it when hot. You can even pass on eating inside the restaurant and sit at their outdoor area overlooking Sprinkles and the High Roller. Asked our server it it'd be possible to eat at the restaurant during performance nights, she inquired, and said that it shouldn't be a problem. 21+ after 8p.

For the show itself, her performances were great I liked that she remixed all the songs. Almost a 2 hr intermission from the opening act was ridiculous!!! she performed for about one hr and then left the stage and i left the venue. IDK if the concert was over then or not.

Now I do know the long line was due to his crew needing another sound check, which was fine. What was not fine was the rudeness of the staff, unwillingness to inform the people what was happening, and unwavering attitude the entire night. There was two nice staff that I recall, one dressed like a cowboy and another gentleman who went out of their way to explain and try to see if there was a different line for Vip (there wasn't). The waitresses(yes, more than one) in the Vip were absolutely atrocious and I honestly never want to go there again and the only thing that saved my night was his performance. I've attended so many shows here and I've never felt as awful as I do now about it there.

It wasn't busy at all, but had to wait an extended period to be seated ordered drinks and a appetizer the drinks took a while to come out the appetizers came out in a timely manner. The entrees took a while to come out. For entrees we ordered the fried chicken and the po boy. The chicken was excellent, the po boy was meh, so we sent it back. Throughout the whole dining experience service was lackluster and we would have to waive down our server even though the restaurant was practically empty. In place of the po boy we ordered a Greek salad thinking it was a traditional Greek salad however it included romaine and the dressing wasn't quite right. In addition we ordered a side of cole slaw which had too much dill so it was sent back, and a side of fries which were good. We were not pleased with the service and just wanted to leave at this point so we asked for the check. It came promptly and was $80 however there was no pen to sign the check. It took an additional 5-10 minutes to waive down a server to request a pen to sign a check. Finally when a server attended to us we requested to speak with a manager. The manager came and I cited my grievances with the service or lack there of and the fact that numerous items were sent back. The manager just shined me on and said they will try to do better thanks for bringing it to her attention. Although the fried chicken was excellent everything else was sub par especially the service.

I payed for ""VIP"" to only be there for no more than 2 hours just to watch a DJ. Just like everyone else that night, my friend and I had drinks from the bar. Needless to say it smelled like weed in there. I'm not going to lie the music was good and we were dancing, having a great time waiting for the main performance. 

After being told by the bartenders that Ashanti and Ja Rule came on at 9. I decided to head to the bathroom so I wouldn't miss anything. When I came back my friend told me that security from downstairs were staring right at us. I looked down at the 2 securities and didn't think anything of it.  BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING not only that we weren't the only people in that area!

With that being said, not even 5 minutes later 2 other securities tapped us and stated they needed to ""talk to us in a quiet place"" I didn't think anything of it so we followed. Just to lead us to the front door and saying do you know why we pulled you? I was completely puzzled and stated I didn't have an idea what was going on. He proceeded by saying ""you guys have been throwing ice at the crowd""  I was so lost.  I did let him know I had literally just returned from the bathroom and he did not even acknowledge what I was saying  and added ""security has been watching you all night"" the  told us to leave.  There was no way I would've payed that amount of money to be kicked out.  They had no way to directly point fingers at us and if so. i would definitely like to see the proof of me throwing ice.

I've had the fried chicken before at Blue Ribbon Sushi in NY and at The Cosmo here in Vegas. This was not the same. I actually think they might have forgotten to double dip it in the batter.  The skin coating was kind of thin and not that crispy. The ribeye was just plain fatty and chewy. Additionally, although I ordered it ""Medium"" it was clearly delivered ""Rare"".
I might give the fried chicken another chance due to its reputation but the ribeye was clearly an inferior/cheap cut they are serving.  And although they have only 8 or 10 tables outside I enjoy al fresco dining this time of year in Vegas.

I do really enjoy the entertainment and feel of the place. I've already seen 3 live shows here and look forward to seeing a few more.  Maybe even doing some bowling next time.",Wwa7RshRpvf5Ob2zeS6fng,4,2,1,CgKUQP4pszkltQuS2gziUQ
226895,2014-06-17,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"REVIEW FOR RESTAURANT ONLY:

finishing up lunch right now. service was a little on the slow side, maybe because it's tuesday lunchtime? there seems to be enough people walking around (we checked in at three separate hostess stands, for crying out loud), but there was no sense of urgency in getting water to the table or taking orders or checking in on us... either way, the food was worth the wait!

hummus appetizer was pretty good - wish it came with crudités, too, but the pita bread triangles were fine. the half chicken dinner (mix of white and dark meat, 4 pieces total) was fantastic!!! meat was hot and juicy, the breading was crispy and peppery, and the hot sauce and honey pulled all the flavors together nicely. we subbed the mashed potatoes and collard greens for fries and pickled cucumbers - both were just ok. 

the fried chicken was the main reason we stopped in anyway, but the blt we ordered to round out our meal stole the spotlight. yes, a blt! i was skeptical at first: $14 for a sandwich and side salad? but that thing had bacon piled high and falling off the plate! must've been at least a dozen slices. simple side salad was just that - nothing too fancy, just heaps of greens in a simple vinaigrette, which helped to balance out the spicy, fried stuff. YUM. 

for our three-year-old (who, incidentally, closed our meal with a completely out-of-character tantrum - maybe vegas is too much for him?), we ordered the seared salmon and red rice/beans. he doesn't eat your typical crap ""kid's food,"" so we appreciated that brooklyn bowl's kids menu had actual food on it. for $9.75, the seared salmon filet was a great value and easily could've fed an adult. we split a chocolate frosted cupcake, too, which was just the right amount of creamy sweetness.

an appe, two entrées, a kid's meal, and dessert for the three of us was $60 before tip. not bad, not bad at all for eating on the strip!!! definitely glad we stopped by today. hopefully the service gets better.",VlsUtqRd3bgg83Z4IsmW-g,5,0,4,-TyJJFzt0cIuypjIVoMAvA

Our service was spot-on, and that is what made the experience great.  It felt just like cabana service at the major Strip resorts - but at a bowling alley. It took my brain a few minutes to wrap around that concept.

The FRDIAY we arrived to Vegas, I received a call that they had been trying to get a hold of me to let me know my reservation had been cancelled for SATURDAY .  Obviously a lie.  I asked how long they had been trying to get a hold of me and she said for 3 weeks (ridiculous)!  All they offered me at the time was a refund.  So, I was stuck trying to find a place within a day, for 30 of us (including young ones) to all get together to celebrate, which is just about impossible this time of year in Vegas.  It pretty much ruined our trip.

After speaking with the manager at Brooklyn Bowl, she claimed that it was the fault of the online booking company (Galavantier), and that they should have let me know earlier (???).  Some large organization had booked all of Brooklyn Bowl for a corporate event that weekend.

They gave me my full refund and said I could have 4 lanes free of charge in the future (LOL).

479582,2017-09-21,1,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"I drove here all the way from California to see one of my favorite bands on Friday 9/15/17 and it was the worst venue experience of my life. We got to the venue around 8:30 am to wait in line for a band that opened doors at 7:30 pm because I know that their fans are crazy 16 year old girls that can't drive and bring their parents with them, so I wanted to make sure we got in line early so we could get in the very front. When doors finally opened we all got in line inside fairly in the same order we were outside. So now I'm looking at about only 10 people ahead of us to get onto the floor of the venue and I start to notice a line growing to the side of me about 30 people deep and I asked about it and I guess the security guard only told a few girls in the front and some other people that if you bought food and showed the receipt you got to cut the line. I was furious. I had been there since 8:30 and some people just got there and now they're in the front. This is so f'd up. I explained that to the guard and he absolutely didn't care. As the ""I bought my loyalty and spent way too much money on crappy food to get to the front of the line fakes"" made their way in the guards never checked their receipts! Which was even more f'd up. So once that line got in, we got in and we were nowhere near the front now. Just remember, money gets you everywhere. The people that run these venues don't care. It's all about the money. And it always will be. So don't come here expecting to see your favorite band up close. I wouldn't recommend spending any second of your life at this dump. Their food looked horrible, burned, and over priced. The unfriendly staff and weak drink selection is another reason to never waste your time at this unmoral constitution.

Came to eat brunch on 4/19 and catch Robert Randolph's brunch concert as well at 1p. I reserved a table and when I arrived at 12p, I was seated promptly in the corner of their bar area. I was given a menu, and looked everywhere for brunch (which is advertised on their website as available on Saturdays and Sundays), and it was nowhere to be found. I asked my waiter and he said ""Oh, we don't serve brunch.""

Huh....? it says on the las vegas BB website that brunch is available Saturdays and Sundays at 11a. When I told him this, he said he would go talk to someone to see. He comes back a few minutes later and says ""yeah we aren't serving brunch at this time."" He seemed sympathetic but not at all excited about working there, and the hostesses gave that vibe as well. The entire reason I came to eat there was for the Cinnamon Pizza advertised on their brunch menu. Why would you advertise something being available and not serve it? Especially when there's a ""Brunch with...."" concert the same day?? Not cool.

I was really hungry, so my friend and I decided to just order something anyways, so I got the fried catfish sandwich and a magic hat to wash it down. It was okay, but nowhere worth $15. the catfish breading wasn't seasoned at all, and the balsamic vinaigrette served with the greens was super bitter, even for my tastes. I didn't finish it all, because the sandwich fell apart and because the concert I was going to had started.

I'm willing to give this place another go around if they ever fix their brunch menu. I hate to say, but the dining experience here was a let-down.",K0ilMgm_KwwqPApK1_11vA,0,0,2,aAVILKQf2GDT094icfOb8g

After seeing concerts for the last 40+ years in the EU, Australia, US, MX and many other places, we have never had to leave a venue because after 2+hrs, we were still listening to an opening act of music by a musician we were not informed about, waiting for Mr. Harper to appear. We specifically called BB prior to the show and asked mgt. the best way to visit the venue. We arrived at 5:00 PM for dinner;  after spending $50 for taxis, $100 at dinner and nearly $200 for 'Club' seats at the BB; it was a complete bust. Seating was completely wasted and view of the stage blocked by the drunk deadbeats that stood in front of the seats. For nearly 2-hours, we were compelled to watch a solo acoustic act by an artist we did not know, nor was his opening act posted on any of the advertising for the show. When we asked to speak to a mgr., we were told by BB Mgr. Hernandez, (who does not speak Spanish, but perhaps he should learn how to), that Mr. Harper might show on stage by 10:00 PM, but that BB had no control of when Mr. Harper shows up on stage...REALLY?!!!

We saw Soja, it was a Tuesday night show, but the floor filled quickly after the opening act. We saw the opportunity for our group to upgrade to the VIP booths upstairs when we noticed availability prior to show time. We negotiated a fair price (if we didn't meet our food/beverage minimum, we could've moved to the bowling lanes after the show until we met it - I thought that was nice); got our bracelets and took over booth and then bellied up to rail once Soja took the stage.

Ordered the fried chicken for lunch and it did not disappoint. It had a nice spicy, crispy crust with juicy meat. There was also a spicy sauce in the condiment caddie that enhanced the flavor nicely too. Generally, all the food passing by looked good and straight-forward.

I was surprised by the price of their drinks. It really felt like you were being gauged by sheer greed. I took a pass on the $9 pint, but was even more stunned by the $4 iced tea. Plain ole Lipton Iced Tea. Those prices only motivated me to go the Yard House for beer afterward. Service was empty and awkward and made the experience rather uneventful.

Do NOT EVER purchase ""Club Level"" tickets. Basically never buy tickets to view the show from upstairs. Its an absolute rip off.

You will risk the chance of not been able to view the show at all. 

If you go to the bar and leave your spot you are done. Im not even talking about coming back and being able to kinda see. No, you CANT. You lose your spot at the barrier and you are DONE!

I tried to bring it up to the staff very politely and they said ""well you knew it was limited viewing"" (which btw it is NOT stated in the website at all). And also, since when limited viewing means NO viewing at all? 

Listen I hate complaining let alone wasting my time whining on yelp but Im trying to help people out there that are serious about watching their favorite band. 

Save yourself some money. DONT purchase anything higher than GA if any. It ain't worth it. 

I left the concert half way through. I raised the concerns to management and staff and they couldn't care less. Lost $150 for that crap.

Went there to eat and it happened to be the night that Wu Tang Clan was playing, so it was super loud (the restaurant is a little area by the bar that is also very close to the concert venue and bowling). Noise is a problem if you are looking to eat there and have any sort of conversation with your dinner mates.

Food was good. Big portions, even on the appetizers. Solid menu. Fried chicken was a little overly salted and I think the reviews on here overrate the food for what you can get at other places on the LV Strip. However, the mac and cheese was the shiz. You can add stuff to it for $3 and IMO it was worth it to add the artichoke hearts and olives, although they were a little heavy-handed with the olives in that and my husband's veggie sandwich.

The reason I gave it 3 and not 4 or 5. The service was SLOOOOOOW. Like, annoyingly slow.

From the time Brooklyn Bowl opened I have seen many great artists in this intimate venue. Everyone from Primus, Steve Winwood, Cake, Jane's Addiction and most recently Echo and the Bunnymen. As stated the venue is small and unless you get VIP seats, it is standing room only which is great especially if you find yourself up against the stage! Hint of getting those 'up against the stage' positions, go in for Happy Hour when it opens at 5:00 and you will get a wrist band to go in first. Dinner and show options, work it people!

As for the food, you can not go wrong with their Happy Hour or full dining options. I think I have tried almost everything on their Happy Hour menu, which is half price off of appetizers and the sliders. All are great except for the Fried Pickles. They are good but in my opinion there is more fried batter than pickle. I do have to say that my favorite has to be the FRIED CHICKEN!

We bowled a few games, had drinks, and listened to the music from downstairs. The couches are very comfortable while you watch or wait your turn to bowl. It somewhat dark in there so to me out makes the experience better. The wait staff was very attentive & very pleasant. The only thing I would have to complain about is that it was very warm in there. Doesn't seem they had the air turned on and with bodies, drinking, and bowling.....it got very warm in there. 

Doesn't realize they also had bowling lanes downstairs also which I thought was pretty cool. Their margaritas were pretty damn good and I could even taste the liquor in it. The bowling is a bit pricy at $25 per half hour or in other words $50 per hour for 8 people. And you can't just walk in but have to make reservations before coming. I can assume since there aren't alot of lanes this is the reason they require it. 

And I finally was able to try their famous chicken and it was really good. I usually don't eat breasts but this one was pretty tasty, juicy, and even gluten free. They ended up catering the entire party food, drinks, and bowling.

We wanted to eat & bowl but they charge you by the half hour and the half hour starts as soon as you get your lane.

I will say the mashed potatoes and gravy was good but It def. wasn't worth a 20$ meal. 
After we ate we decided to bowl, let me remind you they start the time as soon as they give you your lane, you cant bowl until you get your shoes which they bring to your table and let me note you still have to find your size ball so by the time you even get to bowl 5-8mins have passed. There was 6 in our party, we made it to the 5th before we had to get another half hour. They def. know how to get you on your money.

1425617,2015-01-13,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"My husband is a bowler and so when he found notice of Brooklyn Bowl before our last Vegas trip, it went to the top of the 'must see' list. We cruised the menu and decided this was a spot for dinner as there were no concerts when we were there (Christmas).

For our visit, we came in early to catch happy hour in the bar. We got a pitcher of boozy arnold palmers as they were on for half price. To share, we started with the rock n roll fries, as I love poutine. If anyone has had Beecher's mac and cheese, this oddly tasted very similar, which I think it per the cajun spices. It was amazing overall, though veeery salty. We figured it was the gravy as we encountered that again with dinner. After the fries, we shared a 1/2 chicken mixed plate with the cucumber salad instead of greens as I don't eat pork. The chicken was good, though my husband had the breast and he claimed it was quite dry. The cucumber salad is also pickles, which could be quite disappointing if you actually ordered it as your sole side. We then ordered a pitcher of mojitos and enjoyed lounging on the couch in the bar.

We decided to bowl and while it was quite a long wait, they're very nice and offer to call you when your lane is ready. It took us about an hour before we could bowl, but when we got up there, everything was ready for us, including shoes, and so we could start right away. They let you stop your own time by letting a server know when you're done, which lets you talk yourself into doing an hour instead of half, like you had already planned. I was terrible but we had a good time.

Finally, and my absolute favorite part of our visit, was the karaoke portion of the night. It appeared that this was a new event, but a full band plays on the stage and you go up and sing along. It was like a free concert. The host was hilarious and didn't hesitate to rip on people who made up their own lyrics or botched the song. The band was amazing and happily played duplicates as necessary. This made our night and is what all of our friends have heard that we will be going to during our next visit.

Overall, service was wonderful in all parts of the space. The concert area is small enough to be intimate but has plenty of different places to stand, so you're not like sardines. We won't hesitate to be back as we had a great visit.",B393RKS1yuQdkiynXKa1iQ,4,3,5,7845u5vxtQJbilu7mWTurw
1439909,2015-03-14,2,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"At first glance it seems like a neat place, but it's not a good venue at all. Awful in my opinion. I came here with my boyfriend last night to see Korn. My night was ruined because Brooklyn Bowl clearly oversold the show to the point that it was unsafe.

Stage View: I do not recommend this venue to see a concert unless of course you're 6'7"" or you don't care about seeing the stage. If your father is Daddy Warbucks then maybe you can afford the $500-700 VIP section and get a view of the stage. I saw Korn last night at this venue and was very disappointed because I couldn't see anything. What a waste of a $50+. I've been to a lot of shows in my lifetime and this venue is setup very poor. 99% of the concert venues I've been to are set up in such a way that you can see the stage from any spot in the house. Not Brooklyn Bowl! If you go here expect to not see shit! Although there is the option of watching the show on one of the flat screen TV's. However, I didn't pay $50+ to watch Korn on a TV. That's pretty pathetic. 

Crowd: This place is a tourist trap. Not good for locals. Every time I've been here it's a total bro fest. Douche bag bro guys everywhere acting like assholes shoving 100lb girls like myself to rush the stage. Not cool! 

Cost: Again it's a tourist trap. The venue is set up shitty so that next time you'll spend $500-700 on balcony VIP area. For a beer and a mixed drink and it was $20. The food is extremely overpriced as well. 

Staff: I went upstairs to the balcony area thinking I could get a glance of the stage. I found a small area where I could see. Then the Brooklyn Bowl staff ruined it by deciding they wanted to watch the show and stepped into the unused VIP area and blocked my view. 

Sound: The sound was good. I'd say just a notch below House of Blues quality. 

I will say, this venue may be a cool spot to watch a lesser known band as it wouldn't be so crowded. I just have yet to experience that.

In addition to over selling the Korn show, they oversold the Jack White show as well. This gives me the impression that Brooklyn Bowl is a greedy establishment that has no regard for the safety of it's patrons. Oversold shows are miserable for everyone involved. 

In conclusion, this place is more of a hassle than it's worth. I personally don't recommend it.",IEQjRwcXUJQ4J-x4H6Nfsg,9,3,1,ddV6VISJHTRzoG_Duy173w
1448092,2014-07-03,5,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Rolling Stone magazine may call this place ""one of the most incredible places on earth"", but the fascination goes down when you actually have to pay for the experience. In theory, it's an amazing mix of bowling alley, music venue, bar, and restaurant, with separate areas for each and even a patio overlooking the hoppin' Linq area.

Amelinda's review thoroughly details the pricing difficulty with their musical acts- the only way to get the advertised price and avoid miscellaneous fees is to order in person at the box office with cash. But no local wants to go to the Strip just to make a purchase unless they work nearby. 

I'm not a huge bowling fan, but it's a great place to do so- but a group of 6 took about 45 minutes for a single game, and at like $30/half hour not including shoe rentals, that's pretty steep. Best advice would be to include the sock/shoe fees in the lane rental for what they're asking, or bring it down about $10. I'd understand increased pricing during concerts due to demand, but going on a weekday evening the place was dead.

And now for their food. You're on the Strip, so it's ridiculously priced. Variety is good, with some unique  appetizers including knishes and a smoked fish plate! But their ""famous"" fried chicken was too salty for me to enjoy and simply did not stand out or wow me in any way- maybe you have to be drunk or from some place other than the south.

Maybe I'm a cheapskate but it's not worth dropping $100 for a couple to enjoy for date night. Props for being a one-stop shop for it all, but music would be the only thing to bring me back here specifically.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,3,3,yY1AiWZGuWBS548f4y3M-w

The venue itself is big and airy, and I like the idea they're going for. The open concert floor is pretty big, and good for a small-medium sized show. But not sure if that would distract from the bowling or the bowling distracts from the concert, because it shares the same space. 

I went on a Friday night, with no particular band that I recognized playing... the bowling area was full, the patio and side table area were busy. The side beer pong/game area was empty and the concert floor was pretty empty too. I appreciate it not being crazy crowded, but I'm thinking the size and emptiness of the place when there's not a particularly popular band playing sorta takes away from the atmosphere. I enjoy live music but want a cozier feel. 

The service was decent. Nice, and  they checked on us regularly. I don't really need too much. Keep in mind the chicken can take a while to come out, but they usually warn you. Just good to know that going into it.

Man! What a show! I really dig this venue! There is seriously a bowling alley right alongside the performance space. I love it! The beer costs are a little steep ($6 PBR) but it's the strip...so when you compare it to the surroundings, it's not so bad. 

The set up is pretty easy to navigate, though I can see this place becoming a can of sardines for sold out shows. There are many options to get booze and an outdoor area to take a breather, which I appreciate. Their beer selection isn't half bad and their mixed drink prices weren't too horrible either. For happy hour, the prices were good (about $4/beer) and the window view was fun to people watch.

Once you walk in (from the Linq Promenade) head up the escalators and go straight back (for concerts or dining) or make a quick right (for happy hour). It's as simple as that!

It's kind of a strange arrangement with a huge floor in front of the stage (think House of Blues) and a ""side area"" for VIP ticket holders. Roughly 20 feet away are several couches (and a small bowling alley behind that! No one plays during the show though) but if you sit there, you won't see the concert very well. They are not clear on this when you go through the line (which is both floor and VIP) so if you're in VIP, go to your immediate left once you get through. There is a long bar where you can at least put a drink or purse (or both). Was slightly disappointed on the ""personal"" waiters we were supposed to have. They mill around behind us not really approaching until you flag them down but are very nice once you get their attention. I found all the staff here very friendly actually.

The first night that I got to experience the place was at a work get-together. had 2 lanes reserved, and our director ordered a spread of food for everyone. We just had to pick up our own beer tabs, which was cool. We liked our wait staff that night 'cause they were all nice and checked on our group throughout the night, despite minor hiccups and confusion as to whether or not we'd be able to split our bills. 
Second experience was for the Grouplove concert with the fiance. Got to eat at their restaurant area with cool and attentive wait staff again. Food was good, not great that makes me wanna go back, plus I was kinda disappointed with their beer menu (not that big of a variety). Bartenders around the concert floor were nice and on top of it - no long wait to get a drink nor was there trouble getting anyone's attention. 
My only hesitation was the set-up of the bowling lanes. LOL. The walkway honestly kinda sucks going between the sofas and tables, trying to take your turn at bowling. Also didn't really appreciate how the concert started about an hour after the advertised time with the opening bands, but that could be my lack of experience going to concerts. Even then... Do I get irritated with the band(s) or the venue for punctuality?

At that point we asked about our wings which we ordered initially and 10 min later they showed up. The music for this atmosphere was terrible, we asked along with other parties who were not part of our group if they can change it to something else. They said that due to their production being gone they couldn't. So we were stuck with terrible music, terrible service and for a second time we had the attendant alert us of our other 30 minutes almost up. We then advised her we had just gotten our wings.

This amazing looking building offers dining, bowling and a great concert venue except it is mostly standing room only,  

It is easy to transport here to what an older building in NYC would feel like but with all the upgrades that a new building like this place offers.  

Everything I have sampled food wise here has been pretty tasty but their Fried Chicken steals the show and during game nights you may see some great specials like $1 wings and $2 sliders.

We have been here for private events like the Yelp Nerdy Dancing event where they really took care of us.  But I have been back for other occasions and ended up having a great time too especially while enjoying a concert, with the exception of a particular time were several of us were allowed to go the upstairs balcony seating area and then by a rude lady told this was a reserved area.  She could have definitely handled the situation differently, in a more professional manner.  Hopefully she was just having a bad moment. 

The place can get a little too much to handle from what I witnessed with not  having a good amount of security personnel .  With so much alcohol being consumed, you will most likely encounter like we did on several occasions, your mean drunks.   The fights that break out are my main concern and then perhaps not kicking out the patrons who have had their drinking limit. 

Their concerts and events are pretty reasonably priced and on some occasions free!  You can check their website for their entertainment calendar or also posted right outside of their ticket office and if you are lucky on some nights there is a uniquely dressed promoter who is both charming and informative.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,5,2,4,6KJ6xnR7LU0pTtzM_h29Gg

I always say you can trust a place w/ PBR on tap and my rule has yet to let me down lol They get some of the best shows in town and their tickets are reasonably priced (I heard locals get 2 4 1 tix if bought at the box office but always forget to ask). Combining bowling, fried chicken and live music is an interesting concept but seems to work considering this isn't their 1st rodeo w/ locations in NY and somewhere else. After many visits we broke down and tried the fried chicken (how could you not?). It was quite tasty. Not the cheapest fried chicken prices but I get it. Worth it, especially if you're already there watching or waiting for your band. 
 The bowling is cool too. I heard there are like 30 lanes in there but don't know where they're hiding them all. A cool feature is if you get a lane while a concert is going on they broadcast a live feed on the big screens that sit above the end of each lane, looks cool. If you forget to wear shes w/ socks you can score a pair but they'll run ya like $6 (ouch!).

They have a decent draft selection w/ both PBR & Stella making the cut and being somewhat affordable, so kudos to that. PBR weighing in at $6 and all other beers I think are $7. Mixed wells drinks will run you $12. Their gried chicken (what they're known for) is pricey as fux but equally as good. 8 piece of dark will run ya $24, $26 for mixed & $28 for all white. They have the shoe string fries and for $4 they're worth it.

We went on a Saturday night and although bowling was advertised outside, we were unable to even enter the bowling area- it looked like a group had rented it out.

The cajun catfish was beyond impressive, this was extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spicy and grilled to perfection for me. It topped off the mashed potatoes with bacon pieces, I pretty much could have died happy after eating this on an empty stomach! Needless to say, I highly recommend this if you cross paths with Brooklyn Bowl. Pretty steep at $19.50, but you know what, it's effing vegas!

The fried chicken is their signature dish, being a black man I fancy myself to know a lil about fried chicken. Stereotype intended!  The skin on the fried chicken I think is too breaded, it is almost separate from the chicken. However it is tasty but if I were to eat chicken here again it would be their wings.  Those are some of the best lil chicken wings I have ever tasted, the sauce, the smokiness are a must try.  The grilled catfish was descent, mac and cheese was alright, I really enjoyed the red beans and rice.  Their french fries are stellar. The rock and roll fries are like crack.  I ordered them with light gravy and I couldn't stop shoveling them in my mouth. Share that dish its a lot. 

Pizzas come on french bread which is cool, we ordered The Beach ""pulled pork"" and it was ok a little better when I used the sauce from the wings to pour on it.

So the venue in general is cool as was Kehlani but the front bar/restaurant has horrible service and was ran by a very rude nasty and condescending manager. I won't include her name in a public post but will message the venue directly addressing her.  So our bill last night ran well over $200 as we were celebrating me and my friends birthday early. While waiting for an extended period of time and AFTER having to ask numerous servers for menus once the concert started I stood briefly be myself at the back railing. The manager then comes to tell me ""Mam' you can't stand back here this area is for people eating at the restaurant."" I then tell her that's fine I would be eating already if I hadn't been waiting over 30 min for service and turn to walk back to my table. While following me she then accuses me of walking by the hostess without stopping and asks if I would like to get a order to go. I asked her are you politely asking me to leave??? Mind you I'm in no way acting up or out of character but at that point I did tell her NO she was wrong and as a matter of fact let's clear this up with the hostess I spoke to when I walked in. I then walked to the hostess stand where she followed and we confirmed what I said. I told her look you asked me not to stand somewhere and I graciously obliged however addressing the horrible service we have received has seemed to have agitated you can I please speak to the manager when she then tells me that she IS the manager. I then ask for her name and politely say thank yew as I'm not about to be baited any further into a confrontation with their horrible manager. Mind you it STILL takes 30min for someone to come take our order AFTER this occurred. We had to ask for our menus prior to this happening so I'm confused. I felt like they were trying to refuse us service. So halfway thru our meal and sometime later low and behold here comes first an Asian guy and Caucasian guy and they stand at the back railing. Then a couple of girls join them. The manager stands right there and lets them stand there for sometime before I finally see them leave.

1964109,2015-01-09,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Brooklyn Bowl is a little too $$$ for me to come here often. In fact, I've been here exactly twice. Once to split an expensive adult milkshake (which was small, but quite tasty). And once to see a concert. But special hint alert!: You can find free bowling coupons in some of the weekly magazines. So I now look forward to actually bowling here.

The place itself is pretty awesome. It's got lots of different areas (bar, dining, bowling, stage, upstairs, etc.) and a cool and hip vibe and atmosphere. Staff could stand to be more pleasant. And they could use more restroom locations.

As a concert venue, it's nice. I like that it's got a small club feel. But they really REALLY pack people in and oversell. So be sure to arrive when doors open so you can stand in a spot where 1) you can see and 2) you can avoid being completely smooshed. (Hint: Stand behind the barstools to the right of the stage. Good sound spot. Good view spot. Close to the bar. Won't get excessively smooshed.) Arriving early, however, will not secure you a seated spot - not even a barstool. They actually charge extreme amounts of extra $$$ to sit on a barstool. I can understand charging extra for the tables and the bowling lanes, but the extra money for the barstools seemed ridiculous. If I ever have the money, it would be pretty kick ass to bowl and see a concert at the same time.

Overall, as a concert venue, I like it. Decent sound quality, small club feel, good lighting, etc. But I would probably have hated it if I arrived just before show time.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,8,3,3,FFfz29TW0Jm5rduBqk2fYQ

First the good and why I love BB. I love the whole concept of this place, the decor, the layout, and the multiple forms of entertainment. BB is one of my favorite music venues in town, tickets are relatively cheap, and they support lesser known bands that most vegas venues wouldn't feature. They serve Brooklyn Brewery on tap (an awesome domestic brewery) and the fried chicken is bomb!
Now the bad and why I don't like BB. $30 for a pitcher????? I get it, it's on the strip, but come on! The bowling lanes are fun and have a very hip decor, however the lanes are shorter than average lanes and the pins are attached to strings which don't allow the pins to fall over as easily as regular lanes. Lastly, during the day when they are setting up for a band later that night, all the sound checks and instrument checks get pretty annoying when you're trying to have a good time bowling.

This venue is consistent in its poor service. From getting my ticket scanned and wrist band put on (no one made eye contact with me or acknowledged me when I thanked them) to my interactions with the bartenders and security guards, it seemed like everyone was perpetually pissed off. Once again, I couldn't get a decent drink. I asked for a lemon drop martini, remembering how they couldn't make a sex on the beach on my last visit, and was given something that tasted like orange dish soap and not lemony at all. When we went back to nicely ask the other, older bartender if he could mix up a better one, he did a decent job but gave us a lot of attitude and just stomped away instead of accepting our tip. The bartenders were doing a lot of yelling at customers hanging around the bar so I didn't feel like it was personal, just a general hatred of their patrons. 

The music this time was way too loud, and as the Brooklyn Bowl has a really nice patio outside, we decided to get some fresh air and see some of the beautiful views of the high roller outdoors. The music sounded better outside (the acoustics seemed really off inside the venue for the show I was at, maybe their regular sound guy was off or something), and we were having a nice conversation when a security guard came outside and kicked us out. No explanation was given, just a ""you can't be out here."" As he marched us back indoors, a few guys tried to ask him if the patio was available for smoking, and he just ignored them and walked away. We later saw the smokers sitting on the curb outside the Brooklyn Bowl; kind of shitty to make people completely exit a venue to smoke when you have an empty patio available.

I came to see Warren G and DJ Quick perform. When I first arrived there were two lines. A line for those who had already purchased tickets and a line for those who still needed to purchase.

Once you reach the doors, there is more security, they pat you down, wave their little wands, check your purse,  put  a wristband on you, and you're good to go. 

It never took long to get a drink at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly. When you are down on the floor, there's a bartender with a cash register to the left hand side so you can order drinks directly from there instead of having to go back to the bar. Beer prices weren't too bad ($8). 

My tickets were GA standing so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to see amongst the crowd since I'm 5'3. I didn't have any problems at all. I was able to see all of the performers perfectly and they put on an amazing show.

I also asked to book dinner for 10 people-and received a phone call 40 minutes later informing me that the venue had just booked a concert-so the price just went up to a minimum $1000 spend for my group to have bowling, food and drinks on my requested night. I knew we would spend $1000 at least so it wasn't about price but did not want to be forced to eat dinner in the bowling area-and did not want a concert so we could socialize-and changed the booking date.  Did receive an email confirmation of the change. When we arrived-all members of our group were not in yet and the restaurant was hesitant to seat us despite being at 35% capacity in the dining area. I assured the wait staff we would eat and drink while waiting for the full party. They suggested Happy Hour which I did appreciate.

We continually needed to flag the waiter down to order more items, clear the table, place our dinner order etc-not sure if lazy or unaware-but when you are at an automatic billing of 22% service with a group looking to celebrate-I would put in some hustle and awareness! As a manager myself-I would be very unhappy with an employee who didn't recognize an opportunity to sell! Truthfully-the food was ok-everyone seemed to enjoy it despite my thinking the blackened salmon was very dry and little blackening-and everyone agreed that the collard greens were a miss-and we are a vegetable loving group! Bowling was fun-the venue was cool-very nice music. My group had fun but the $1100+ bill was sure a missed opportunity had the staff been more aware and actually engaged us-that's what customer service is all about.",C3-__jJNxwbR5Rvr-CaW1g,3,0,2,ec7X0cennYbFR9MibyipEA

Came in to see The Roots and their set was ridiculous!! The stage is quite small but wasn't too crowded. There are also about 5 bars throughout the place serving Brooklyn brews on tap.  How dope is that though?!

What I'm most excited about Brooklyn Bowl: Bromberg Brothers serving Blue Ribbon fried chicken right around my neighborhood till four in the morning.  Make sure to eat it with hot sauce and honey... foodporn!!

Bowling alleys on two floors with one overlooking the stage.  I'm not much of a bowler but I'd actually try it out in this place.  Not sure if you need show tickets to bowl when someone's performing.  They also stream the concert at the front of the alley so players can see what's going on at the stage while having a game.  Then again, why trade an epic live performance with bowling?!

Overall, Brooklyn Bowl is certainly one of Las Vegas' awesome music venues.  I pick this over Boulevard Pool/House of Blues any day.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,1,2,5,eQxUWG_u5p8dApYv3pvoZQ

It wasn't my ideal choice as it wasn't rated but A-OK on Yelp! However we decided to check it out and in the end it turned out to be exactly what Yelp! said it would be, A-OK.  First of all the interior is really pretty cool and it's very large.  It's all exceptionally clean and I liked the layout.  

However, the first sign of it being A-OK versus anything better reared it's head when I asked the server at our table what would be a good drink that he would recommend and he replied with ""well here's the menu"" and walked away.  Honestly, it really struck me the wrong way and went a long ways towards me wanting to give this place two stars or even one at the moment.  But I hoped the rest of the experience would be better and it was.  After that gentleman walked away another server brought over our drinks and was a bit friendlier.  We ordered drinks and chicken sliders.  We didn't have to wait long for either.  The chicken sliders were ok, nothing exceptional.  The meat was pretty good and the bun was fresh, but they didn't put nearly enough mayo on it and because of it they turned out to be too dry.  

All in all I would likely not go back to this place, not because it's bad, it's not, but because it's not exceptional and there are too many places in Vegas to eat that are 4 or 5 stars to mess with a place that is average like The Brooklyn Bowl.  

Also, I hope the server who was rude to me just had a bad day because if he greets everyone like that I could see some folks simply walking out without ordering anything.",MqvuybIfFPZpKbwLcaeutg,0,0,3,Iagxf9WJDHfrbnqTUY56GA

I came here for a work event with a talented house band playing, rather than for a proper concert.  But I'd love to come in here for a sold out show from a marquee act that I am a fan of.

The event I went to was fully comped but looking at the prices, definitely seemed like you could go broke quick in here if you weren't careful.  But hey... it's Vegas and it's on the Strip.  So it's really just enforcing the status quo in that regard.

I wish I would have gotten to try the fried chicken.  There was food served but it was mostly just pizza and sliders and such, pretty good but nothing mindblowing.

I wanted to buy tickets for 3 concerts in person because I did not want to pay their $6.99 online service fee per each ticket.  I was told that if I go in, the service fee would only be $2.00.  I figured I save $15 on service fees over 3 concerts, even though I would have to only pay in cash.  I know their box office has weird hours and usually opens up after 5 or 6 so I checked their website to confirm.  The website said their box office was open from 5pm-close with no indication of what the closing time was.  I then used their automatic phone service to see if I could find any more info.  This service said the box office was open 6pm to close, again with no indication of what closing time was except that it was open until their normal operating hours which is usually 2am.  I then decided to stay on the phone to try and reach the actual box office.  The phone kept ringing and ringing so I hung up. 

 It was only 8pm so I decided to head down there.  Mind you this was a 30 minute drive.  I get there and the whole giant parking lot is shut off to everybody and you are  forced to either find parking far away from the site or in a very small, Linq garage.  I finally found my spot and went down to get a ticket.  The box office looked closed but a sign said it was indoors.  When I finally went in, a security guard said that the box office had closed at 8pm.  As it was 8:30pm and I had just spent 45-and hour driving down there and finding parking, I was extremely pissed off.  

I don't know what kind of operation is being run down there but it is bullshit.  It was a complete waste of my time, my gas, my patience, and my faith in Brooklyn Bowl as a good and fair venue.",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,4,0,1,pOqyh9vXzRKUVnmzbOTYBw

The sound was great and there was plenty of room for dancing. They also keep the entire place well air-conditioned so that was definitely a huge plus for me.

The best part about Brooklyn Bowl is their fried chicken. I think I talk about it at least once a week. My boyfriend and I split the 1/2 mixed order which came with mashed potatoes and collared greens (w/bacon). Everything on that plate was PHENOMENAL. The chicken is juicy, well seasoned, fried to perfection, and had just the right amount of heat. Both the sides were also really good, but the chicken was...just unbelievably good.

Literally puts the saying winner winner chicken dinner! In complete context. It by far the best fried chicken had in long time and the best part is not commercialize/fast food fried chicken. I had the complete chicken dinner so it came with mash potatoes and collard greens. The mash potatoes was super creamy silky consistency and the gravy was solid brown gravy. The two combine made for the perfect balance. Collard greens must admit had my reservations about cause collard greens had more bad then good experiences. I was impressed. Not only was the collard greens cooked on point but the nice size diced pieces of fried bacon. It had perfect aroma of greasy cooked bacon and sautéed collard greens! I could have had bowl of collard greens be happy in life. The star of the show the fried chicken. I have no idea the breading mixture they use. I would love to know cause dam I would make fried chicken more often even though my heart would regret it. =(( It not only the common traits the crispy skin, moist meat, and cooked through perfect. Something about the skin not only crispy but more depth to it. The fried skin on this one has the crunch. But it not overly greasy and kind of flaky when bite into it rather then one bite the whole fried skin comes off in one shot. The hot sauce they make in house makes it even more tasty. Not that it needs the extra flavor. Hot sauce and fried chicken need I say more...Not! Our server recommended doing combination of hot sauce and honey. I tried on the side but for me combination overly sweet for my taste buds. I would highly recommend trying both. I just prefer the hot sauce. There lot of different options that can choose from dark meat to white meat. So no worries if only want one kind of meat. The wedge salad looked amazing. My cousins meet for dinner they shared order. They told me was great. I never tried it but eye appeal looks as good as they told me it tasted.

The bartenders were awesome! I was meeting cousins that was visiting from out of town. We started at the bar drinking some of the great options of craft beers on tap plus Brooklyn Bowl finest!! Just ended up having dinner at the bar. We were there for so long had two different bartenders. Both were on top of it. I love energy both gave out. They were super friendly answering any questions we had and when brought out the condiments reminded us try the hot sauce and honey on the chicken. My cousins and Me both ordered the fried chicken dinner. 

The only thing that was sad is fact was walking into ghost town. I know during concerts they do well cause I know been here for concert. Nothing going on that night. For second going upstairs thinking myself is this place even open and no life in the place. My cousins got there first and they thought the same thing. Hopefully Brooklyn Bowl sticks cause they have the best fried chicken in my mind hands down!!!! Just wish closer and not on the strip.

Decent view of the stage which is great for enjoying the show while you eat.  Drinks came quickly.  Dining area wasn't busy. Time definitely passed. Just under an hour before we received our food. The bright side was they got our orders correct, wasn't necessary to ask for anything additional, and they kept the drinks flowing. 

Pork sliders - tender meat, crunchy pickles, decent taste (nothing I would particularly crave again) portion of 3 was great for me and my small appetite

Mac n cheese - great portion, shredded chicken, good flavor (I would order this in the future)

Chicken wings - I don't prefer bbq flavor. It has very strong bbq flavor as if it came off the grill.  The table really really enjoyed these.

We grabbed tickets to see Local Natives on Sunday night.  First of all, the venue is absolutely gigantic. From the outside, I would never have expected it to be this big. There's a restaurant area (I'll be back to check out the food) and about 5 different bars that make a nice exterior border of the space. There are TWO floors everyone has access to - each floor with bars along side the stage.  On tap options include Rogue Dead Guy Ale and three different ""Brooklyn Brews"" beers. The bar staff was also really friendly and helpful - after ordering a Dead Guy Ale and a coke, the bar tender asked if the coke was for my DD and when I said yes, she said no charge. Little things like that really made me feel happy about where I'm spending my time and money. 

I don't think there's a bad view of the stage from any spot in the entire venue. The ""floor"" area in front of the stage looks big at first glimpse, but as soon as the band takes the stage and begins to play, the area immediately begins to feel more intimate, which makes for a great live music atmosphere. The venue also has pretty solid audio-visual. They're not trying to do too much by hanging huge screens everywhere or over the top lights and LED/laser shows.  Instead, the focus is on the band and the music, highlighted with an impressive mix of smoke effects and color schemes. No distractions - let the music and venue speak for itself.  The sound was absolutely incredible too - from every angle. I stood on the floor, on the side of the stage at the bar, in the back, upstairs, and in a booth at the bowling alley and the sound was consistently great. I'm not sure if this was because Local Natives was playing (they are SUCH a great live band), but I was super impressed by Brooklyn Bowl's acoustics.  

Oh yeah, there is a bowling alley inside with lanes on both floors!!! At the back of every lane, there is a giant leather booth that overlooks the stage so you don't miss anything while you're bowling ... or, so you can just hang out and enjoy the show. Reserving a lane is probably the way to go when you've got a big group of friends - drink/food service, seating, bowling, and huge screens above every lane that show a live feed of the band that's playing. Can this place get any cooler??  

I found my new favorite hangout and with the lineup they've created for the next few months, Brooklyn Bowl has something for everyone. Check this place out - you won't be disappointed.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,8,3,5,nLqIDFEUnr8OBQ5jQbCoVw

They have a decent size area in front of the stage. They also have a few tables in the back that you can stand at. It's a lot better set up than some places out here. There are plenty of bars throughout the place. The bartender we had poured a generous amount of alcohol in our drinks. The drinks weren't ridiculous either. I think beer and well drinks were $8-9.

I remember seeing an event posted about a concert at the Brooklyn Bowl in the Las Vegas Yelp events. So, we ended up attending the concert. The concert line had the following artists: Anuhea, Rebel Soljhaz, and J-Boog. Apparently that evening the concert sold out!

This venue was a multi-floored building, with multiple bars, lounges, and a huge stage with a spacious standing/dancing area. I wanted to check out the multi-laned bowling allies, but the area was closed off due to the concert. I was disappointed that we didn't get to try the fried chicken here. We had dinner prior to attending the concert. We did get a couple cocktails. Drinks were very pricey. Two Jamesons and ginger ales came to a total of $32.

The venue overall was very impressive to me.",xxMg8OyUtXFNJ2QXDXF4dQ,3,2,4,AwzQ8xJYUvDRu9s-2POEEQ
2351490,2017-04-12,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Thievery & corruption at its finest!  It was my birthday and the band RED was playing. I purchased a bowling lane so that my party could have a place to chill and watch the band.  The price of a lane for this show was $327 plus the price of all the tickets, equaling a total cost of nearly $500.  So once the band started, the sound was so bad that nobody could hear the vocals and this continued for about 7 songs.  Keep in mind there were less than 100 people at this show, and we were the only people that purchased any sort of ""vip"" table.  So after a good 30-40 minutes my friend and I walked over to the sound booth and told the sound guy that the vocals couldn't be heard.  His response was ""get the fuck out of here"".  Not exactly the response I expected but ok, this is Las Vegas after all lol.  My friend and I continued to hang out on the floor watching the band and a few minutes later we walked back to our table and while on our way, got cut off by security.  If you can believe this... They kicked us out!!  They kicked us out for talking to the sound guy.  Just to make this very clear, neither of us were drunk.  We had a few drinks but were in no way belligerent.  The whole time they were kicking us out we were calm and respectful.  I tried speaking to the manager but he kept his back towards me and wouldn't acknowledge me.  Security wouldn't let us go back to our table to get our belongings, they wouldn't even escort me back to get our belongings.  Had I not had a few friends still at the table, Brooklyn Bowl would have kept our belongings and not given them back.  We also had money left on a pre-purchased bar tab that was stolen from us and not refunded.  Now heres the best part.... One of the security guards was actually on our side and told everyone that he thought it was weird that the vocals couldn't be heard.  He also said we were the only people who purchased a table and it was clear that he didn't like what was happening to us.  Now, I don't expect someone to do what I suggest when it comes to a bands production.  I'm not there to step on toes, I'm just there to have a good time wanting to here the vocalist.  As someone who has been in bands my whole life, there's nothing worse than playing a live show and finding out after you played that nobody could hear you.  So as you can expect, none of us will ever attend another event or anything at Brooklyn Bowl.  To be treated this way is absolutely insane!  If the venue or sound guy felt that we were out of line, then security and management should have talked to us like adults and asked us to go back to our table and enjoy the rest of the show.  Had I known that speaking to the sound guy was cause for ejection, than I would have stayed the heck away lol.",sJbGuu30hLx_AQEVcYe17A,0,0,1,a_iOVLK0krqvZyBBiglALg

#2 - if you don't like paprika and spicy breading - don't eat here.  It was on the chicken, the fried pickles, the fries.  I thought everything tasted a bit ""scorched"" as far as the breading, but the inside of the chicken was moist and not over cooked (which is normally how chicken comes out to you).

Pros-
Good sound, which is often hard to pull off in a small venue.

Cons-
Overpriced drinks. $9 for a vodka tonic.  This is pretty much the case everywhere on the strip, but it still sucks.
Not easy to get to- for tourists I'm sure it's fine, but driving there, parking, and walking to the place isn't exactly convenient.  Again, pretty much par for the course on the strip.  

Also it seems like the venue has a ton of wasted space- a large area when you walk in, another large area upstairs that I never see anyone in, and bowling lanes that are never occupied.  Also, why would you want to bowl when there's a concert going on?

A few days ago, my friends and family went to check it out for the first time to see the Roots (so I have yet to actually bowl there!). There was a huge line outside, but since the venue is pretty big, we got in there fairly quickly.

The stage is fairly small, but there is plenty of room to move around if you are watching the show. There are a couple bars close to the stage, and the bartenders are pretty fast so the lines aren't too CRAY. 

One of the coolest things I observed is that there are bowling lanes upstairs and downstairs! Also, if there is a performance going on, they have huge screens in front of the alley so you can watch while you bowl! 8) Now isn't that cool?!

After experiencing life in the bowling lanes during a concert, I never want to purchase general admission tickets ever again! My boyfriend and I were extremely impressed with the service we received when we came to check out SOJA for their Poetry In Motion Tour. 

A stage level bowling lane will cost a pretty penny, but it is completely worth it. You're allowed up to 8 people in your party per bowling lane. There's a leather couch for each lane and communal table too. Although we didn't bowl, shoe rental is included! A good chunk of the tab for the bowling lane is put towards a food and beverage credit for the party to spend as you like, which was awesome! Keep the Captain and Coke flowing, please! The Chick-N-Tots were also really tasty, the perfect snack to munch on while drinking.

Our server Derek (sp?) was amazing, exceptional to say the least. It was very easy to tell that he loves what he does. From the moment we arrived, Derek was so friendly and completely genuine.

The New Brooklyn Bowl in Vegas is quickly gaining popularity because of its concerts and location at the Linq entertainment area. However, you do not want to miss out on the food because it may be the best part of Brooklyn Bowl and if you time it correctly you can still see and hear the music for free and skip the price of a ticket. Simone and I timed our dinner just right so we got to hear the nights Band rehearsing their set before the concert that night and although it was loud it was still pretty awesome. While taking in the sounds we drank a very good Drunken Palmer drink which was basically Sweet Tea, Lemonade and lots of booze. After starting those, our appetizers of Potato Knishes and House Fried Pork Rinds arrived.  The Potato Knishes were good and reminded me of fried mashed potatoes but with a lot more onion flavor. They were served with sour cream and mustard and were enjoyable but nothing compared to the Pork Rinds. The Pork Rinds are all kinds of fabulous (and fabulous is a word I try not to use often). Man, these things were crispy and salty and crispy and salty, and did I mention how crispy they were? They were like bacon on steroids. They were topped with crumbled red onion and Queso Fresco Cheese and had the consistency of a cheese doodle.  They were  light and airy so they were not overly filling and by the time the entrée arrived they were just about gone.  For the entrée, we had Fried Chicken and I'll be damned, it was just as good as the Pork Rinds.  These guys in the kitchen know how to fry themselves up some good eats. The chicken was not heavily breaded and was coated with Matzo meal and then fried, so it didn't seemed as greasy or dense as the well known KFC chicken we have come to love (or hate).  We ordered a mix of Dark and White meat and both were equally good in flavor and moistness (that sounded really dirty).  I think they were eight pieces of chicken and we were able to finish half of them. The rest were great as leftovers for breakfast a few mornings of our vacation.  The waiter suggested that we dip our chicken in honey and habanero oil that is house made. We took him up on the suggestion and sure enough the combination was delicious.  What a great meal.

Me and my friend came here on 09/28/17 to see Motionless in White perform (my sixth time, her first). Brooklyn Bowl is literally right next to the High Roller and only a few feet away from the Linq valet.
We got there a little early so we could get a decent spot on the floor. They let us inside the building at around 5:00 but didn't let us into the actual venue until 6:00. It then took another hour for the first opening band to perform. MIW didn't come up on stage until 9:35.
Lining up to get in was a little strange and confusing. Security makes you stand in single file with one person next to you and one person behind you. VIP (those who got to meet the band) were in a separate line and were let in first. When we got in, I noticed that it was a bowling alley, a restaurant, and a music venue all at once. They have giant TV screens above each lane so you can watch the concert while bowling.

The box office to buy your tickets is on the outside of the venue and right next to the front doors. Once your inside of BB it's has a very cool vibe, with its decor, the 3 bars located in various sections for your convenience.

Staff was on top of everything, gave us the right amount of attention. I really have no complaints or constructive criticism. 

I'm not much of a bowler, but a lot of the bands that have played or are scheduled to play there are bands that I'd like to see. I'll be back for sure.

2730000,2014-04-21,9,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"After visiting Brooklyn Bowl in Vegas, I quickly got back to my garage where I am building the laser from the 1989 Rick Moranis classic, ""Honey I Shrunk The Kids."" Why? I am shrinking this place, putting it in my pocket, clearing the security checkpoint in the airport, flying it to San Diego and opening it up down the street from my house. Love. This. Venue!

Here's the deal, I always like to plan reasons to visit Vegas other than simply degenerate gambling - that just comes with the territory. So, when I saw a show listed for a couple of cool bands trying to kill some time between Coachella sets, I was all over it. Do yourself a favor, scan the upcoming shows and buy a few tickets. Brooklyn Bowl really is a good enough reason to make the trip to Sin City, at least for the music lover in me. 

The restaurant is solid and definitely deserves a quick visit before the the music starts in the main room. If you're running late, don't sweat, you can hear everything loud and clear while scarfing down dinner in one of their cozy booths. We opted for the famous fried chicken and I'm sorry, Public Enemy, I believe the hype. Best I ever had? Nope, but it's damn good and I recommend ordering it. With that being said, what the hell do I know? Well let me tell you!

I know a thing or two about live music after touring with bands for 5+ years. I've seen small clubs and larger venues across the globe and can appreciate them from a totally different perspective. I can tell that Brooklyn Bowl is one of those venues that musicians get excited to play, which carries some weight. When bands are happy, they play better, longer and the crowd can genuinely feel the love. The incredible sound, the effortless set changes, the great lighting, the integrated bowling alley and numerous bars are all perks to the place and the list doesn't stop there... it's all just awesome!

It's always tough reviewing concert venues because the actual show is such a major factor. Seriously, Kenny G anywhere (or Kenny Loggins or Kenny Chesney ... pretty much any Kenny) is going to suck. Elvis Costello & The Roots, on the other hand, can make any joint your favorite place on Earth for a night. 
The beauty of Brooklyn Bowl is that it's got its own perfect game going. The people running and staffing BB are a separate class of awesome. (In particular, Adrees Ali earned the title of Grand Protector and Redeemer.) They took us in, made sure we had everything we needed, and sent us home feeling like we'd just found the one true oasis in the desert. 
I confess that I mostly hate Vegas. BB understands that not everyone wants to wallow in the desperate skank that floods every casino and most every corner of the strip. They've found the right blend of food, drink, music, and atmosphere and, naturally, added bowling! It works brilliantly. Even without the tasty grub and ten-pin hijinks, it's a great venue. The sound is excellent, and no matter where you are--from floor to balcony to the bowling deck--you have clear sight lines. The size is ideal (just under 2,000 capacity), and you can tell that the musicians feel the intimacy of it as well. The whole affair is also a screaming good deal. 
If your show starts at 9:00, grab a lane at 7:00. After that, you're taken care of. It's a kind of magic Copperfield can't touch.",2zhTsvYOEPQaQP9w53zkvA,2,0,5,hcpM_Kd7OImNajirr5Ot7A

It was a great idea! I think they did a wonderful job in capturing the spirit of the original.

The owners have such great skill at finding great bands that I don't even need to know who is going to play, I know it's going to be good and I will have a great night!

I sat at the restaurant just before the set and had a great table from where I can see the band. The food was good and tasty, the wine choice was a great match and the band was great.

After dinner, I continue to wander a bit around the see the place and enjoy the band and then realized that there is a second floor! Yes, the place is much bigger than the original one with a full  second floor (often labeled as VIP or reserved for private event). The second floor have a large opening over the part where the band is playing but have another full set of bowling lanes, a bar area and a private lounge.

I've seen a handful of shows here and after each one I find another reason to really love this place. For one thing, no matter where you're watching from you always have a great view of stage and the sound set up gives a good mix from any nook and cranny. The stage isn't huge, which makes for an up close and personal vibe between the crowd and the band, like when I saw Deftones here a few months ago the lead singer, Chino Moreno, actually walked all the way down the wall beam that separates the bowling area from the crowd. This was amazing to witness, I mean how many venues would allow that?! 

The bars areas are plenty; I mean there's literally one in any direction you turn.  Which is great because there is almost never a line and if there is a line it moves fast. The bar near the main entrance is an awesome alternative to actually seeing the show live a mere on-hundred feet away. They live stream every show on all of the TVs in here, so if you missed out on getting tickets, belly up to the bar and enjoy the show. 

They have some great Brooklyn Bowls and full bar. Prices are pretty competitive for a ""Strip"" venue and not much more expensive than a off the strip live music spot. I still have yet try the food or actually go bowling at Brooklyn Bowl and I hear the fried chicken is off the chain!

2985420,2016-01-18,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"While this place has both a bowling alley and a restaurant, this review is in regard to it as a concert venue. There is a lot to like, but there are some highly annoying issues that really take away from the experience of this place. Taking everything together, I really think the appropriate rating would be 3.5 stars, but I decided to round up given the potential of the venue.

As a birthday gift for my girlfriend, I bought tickets for an Erykah Badu concert at Brooklyn Bowl. Hoping to make the evening special, I purchased VIP tickets for us. I would expect that the VIP experience would begin at the entrance but instead we encountered a long wait in the will call line. Then, after finally getting our wristbands, we received no guidance to the VIP area. After asking about this and getting some vague directions from a staff member, we made our way upstairs to enter what we thought was the VIP area only to be informed that our VIP status didn't enable us entry to that particular area.

To help others avoid the same confusion, here's a description of what the VIP package actually entails at Brooklyn Bowl. Firstly, this information should have been clearly described on the Ticketfly ticketing site and the Brooklyn Bowl site as well, but sadly it was not. For clarification, there are downstairs and upstairs bowling alleys (with seating and standing room) to the left side of the stage and general admission concert area. The downstairs alley was closed for bowling and was the designated VIP area. VIP ticket holders could also access the upstairs bar, lounge, terrace and bathrooms. (TIP: use the upstairs bar as it is faster than the VIP bar downstairs.) The upstairs bowling alley area as well as the seating areas around the upstairs balcony (overlooking the GA area and stage) required additional admission privileges. VIP ticket holders could occupy the standing area upstairs behind the seating area, but the stage wasn't really visible when there were people standing in the seating area.

The downstairs VIP area is actually quite spacious with plenty of tables to place your drink. The tables are designed to look like audio road storage cases, which I thought was a nice touch. There are several couches too, but as the amount of VIP ticket holders outstripped the seating capacity by a lot, sitting was not an option. This wasn't really an issue though. Note that the side view of the stage from the VIP area is actually quite good and we were able to secure a spot fairly close to the stage. Moreover, we could float around and checkout the upstairs lounge without fear of not having a good view when we returned. The concert was also projected on all the large screens hanging over the bowling lanes, so, again, the view was amazing.

In general I really liked the venue. It's new and has a very modern, clean design. In addition to VIP amenities, there were also multiple bars in the GA concert area. Speaking of, it was a welcome surprise to finally find a bar that could actually make an Old Fashioned. It was far from being great, but a mediocre one is better than none. Plus, they could even make a Dark 'N Stormy! (Maybe I'm spoiled from life in the Bay Area, but I have had so many failed attempts at ordering this drink on recent trips to Reno and Vegas. Since when is jagermeister an ingredient?) That said, the bartenders were a little loose with the ice; I thought we were facing a drought. Also, there was some suspicious variable pricing: we ordered the same pair of drinks a second time and the price went up by $6! All complaints aside, though, I really did enjoy my evening watching Erykah Badu in concert. The DJ even continued to play some good music for dancing after the crowds had dispersed from the main floor.

I'll end this review with a few recommended improvements for the venue.
* Provide clarity about what the VIP package includes. There was suspiciously lacking information on both the venue and ticket seller sites.
* Include mobile ticketing options to speed up entry to the venue.
* The VIP experience should start at the entrance: at the very least, give some guidance to where the VIP area is located.",jsu8iKgjn-mrDuuJ1juXJQ,7,2,4,A4vTB_5ghfyxJzL5CAG8Aw

We came here for the Trey Songz concert and it was the most terrible experience. Firstly, the ticket listed the show to start at 8:30 pm. We arrived promptly at 7:30 pm to find that there was already a very long line. We found out that the door to the concert hall actually did not open until 8:30. After waiting for 2 hours in line (which had grown to almost near Las Vegas blvd), we finally got into the venue. Trey songz did not start until 10:30. By that point, my excitement for the concert had died. To put the nail on the coffin, really drunk girls kept spilling their drinks on me until my feet were soaked. I was over it halfway through the show. Never again. Extremely disorganized venue.",95vHPExuHMCCccaBp41htw,0,0,1,9h9o_v3oBACXXVrBJq2TPQ

Opens at 5pm everyday. 
Happy hours are 5pm-7pm and 12am-2am. 

Great venue for concerts, food, and drinks. They have real nice speakers with lots of bass, cool lighting and smoke effects. A lot of helpful people bring their own smoke effects too :-D . I've been here a handful of times and I'm always impressed with the variety of great bands and good vibes they bring. 

It's standing room only so be prepared for tired feet but it's worth it. There are places to sit and rest between sets if needed.
You can choose floor tickets or get upgraded high rise seating. I haven't tried the high rise since it's always been sold out but I believe it's also standing room only. Vibe on the floor is more energetic by far.

You can pay a mini fortune and watch the show while you go bowling. Bowlers get a great view of the stage and also have big tv's to watch the concert and epic couches to sit on. They should fix the pricing on bowling as I've seen a lot of empty lanes during packed concerts. 

Friends and I seen 'Stick Figure' tonight and it was awesome! It was packed and such a good time. Both opening bands were fantastic and the main band played a long time. 

I'm sure to be back often with bands like 'Tribal Seeds' and 'Passafire' both playing soon. Both of them and Stick Figure are newly found bands for me, Brooklyn Bowl helps me find new bands. 

I suggest you visit if a band you like is playing, and go early for happy hour. Enjoy!",2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg,6,4,5,Ko5sQej4Ig7BpbjXBFS61A

The environment is awesome, the vibe is really chill and it truly has a New York feel.
The staff is SUPER friendly and very attentive during your dinning experience. 
I really did love this place, however; the food didn't even come close to meeting my expections. The chicken was no where near as flavorful as they claim. It was seasoned on the outside and whatever they seasoned it with wasn't even all that good. I took it to go, hoping maybe the ""flavor"" would set in and possibly be better the next day. That wasn't the case and I ended up just throwing the remaining pieces away. 
The rock and roll fries were nasty, period. They were tough and lacked flavor.

All ages, everyday until 8 pm, so the kiddos can check out this amazing place also. I heard they have outstanding food too as they partnered with Blue Ribbon to create the menu! But alas, it was pretty late when we decided to check this place out, so we didn't get to try any.

I was a bit worried that a place like this with the bowling and restaurant wouldn't want heavier shows playing but I saw butcher babies, Devil You Know, and Black Label Society here and the music was heavy and the pits were strong and not a thing was stopped by any staff.

3167491,2015-05-14,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"The original Brooklyn Bowl hasn't been open that long, but it's sure gotten it's fair share of positive attention, and I'll admit I was pretty skeptical when they announced a Vegas location. Since they opened, I've been able to come here for all sorts of stuff...concerts, special events and finally dining. It's now not only one of my favorite music venues, but probably my favorite place in the entire Linq Promenade.

Our first time here was for a concert we won tickets to. It was kind of shocking to see just how big the place is. Even after going up the escalators and seeing the big open concert area, all the bowling lanes and restaurant areas, you still haven't seen it all as there's even more upstairs...upstairs. More bowling lanes, more bar space, and more areas to see the stage. Downstairs, the classic open standing area and simple stage setup kind of remind me of The Huntridge. As a concert venue, BB just gets it right. The sound quality is outstanding, the lighting is excellent, and you can see the stage clearly from just about anywhere in the place. If you get a chance to see a show here, don't skip out.

For our second visit, we came out for the Yelp's Nerdy Dancing event. The event in itself was amazing, and BB really did a great job hosting, in nearly all aspects. I'm not sure how often they hold private events here, but again, if you get the chance to come to some event, I'd be willing to bet you won't leave disappointed.

Finally, I gotta say...we waited far too long to come here strictly to eat. A big part of that was me just not giving them the benefit of the doubt. All I kept thinking was that their menu just looked like more overpriced, mediocre food on the strip. After all, they are a concert venue with bowling lanes...how could they possibly have good food? Well, they do. In fact, they have some of the best fried chicken you can find in Las Vegas.

Their regular fried chicken dinners run anywhere from $18 and up. If there's at least 2 of you eating though, I'd highly recommend going with the platters. Since my wife isn't really a dark meat fan, we ended up going with an 8 piece, all white meat platter for $30. It might sound like a lot, but you're getting a lot of food for the money. Not only 4 whole wings, but 4 breasts too. Big, juicy chicken breast with some of the best ""batter"" you can get in town. I love that they aren't afraid to actually put some flavor into it. There's a nice thick coating with a present, but not overpowering spicy kick to it. What makes it even better is that there version is some of the least greasiest fried chicken I've had. Juicy meat, crispy flavorful outside, and almost no grease...it's a must try.

We also got an order of the Mac & Cheese. It's a bit pricey at $13, but if you like Parmesan, this will be your thing. I'm not so much a fan of Parmesan, but even still, it's a solid version. Lots of flavor, a unique crispy bread crumb blend on top, and the portion size is huge too.

Brooklyn Bowl really just has so much to offer, that's it almost unheard of that they do so much, so well. If you haven't been to BB yet, whether its for a concert, event or even just to eat...what are you waiting for?",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,6,1,4,L6Fk3Iae4CSGL-c1Te-LHg

There are three stories, a gigantic disco ball when you're walking in, several bars, two outdoor patios, and a mezzanine to view the show from upstairs (sometimes it's open sometimes it's not). 
I've eaten here once while waiting for the opening band to get off and finally tried the fried chicken. It was amazing, maybe not legendary, but definitely great. The awesome thing about this venue is you can open a tab and it's open at EVERY bar so you can just order from whichever bar is closest to you instead of going back to the original one or closing your tab. 
The bar I waited/ate in was in the middle level between entrance and main floor, it had a beautiful view of the linq as well as some visually stimulating chandeliers. I was able to chat with friends and enjoy beers while seated before the show, and still could hear the opening acts.

First off, the chicken is amazing. Well the whole menu is pretty awesome. Its a smaller menu, however everything is cooked just right. Three of my favorite appetizers are the Rock & Roll fries (see my pics to learn how much I love fries topped w/gravy), the fried calamari w/the cayenne mayo, and BBQ pork sliders w/slaw and dilled cucumbers. Sometimes my fiancee and I will do a San Gennaro flatbread pizza as an app instead. As far as dinner, I loved the ""really"" sloppy joe. Not a fan of coleslaw, but the slaw on this sandwich is awesome. I still have dreams of the blackened catfish, which is weird, because catfish thats not fried is like, ""WTF BRO""! But the chefs here blacken that catfish to perfection. As well as the blackened salmon. Anything blackened on the menu is SPECTACULAR!! And I'll still fight anyone who says Brooklyn Bowl's chicken isnt up there with the GOATs!! Eat the chicken with honey for an orgasm of your tastebuds.

I've also seen the Roots NYE at Brooklyn Bowl. What a magical show. Seen Dizzy Wright twice. DJ Quik. Bone. Dogg Pound. Erykah Badu. I got to see George Clinton and muthafuckin P-FUNK NYE at Brooklyn Bowl!! Its an awesome place to catch a show. Most times you won't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get a drink, even of the place is packed, and a round will always be less than $20. Pay the extra for a table with bar and food tab on a bowling lane for that extra VIP service during a show. 

I can go on forever about Brooklyn Bowl. All I'd suggest is go to Brooklyn Bowl if you're hungry for dinner. Go to Brooklyn Bowl for Happy Hour. Go to Brooklyn Bowl if you want to catch a concert. Just go to Brooklyn Bowl!!",UVrJsEjnT9mWCdWyWVm5Nw,1,1,5,iN_JRM96arRKQq8j0oQyeA

Tickets run for about $40 which is very reasonable for Las Vegas and the venue allows you to have a great view wherever you are.

In other words, the bar is expensive.  Beers run about $9 and mixed drinks $15.  After 11pm is half off all drinks so I would always wait for that surprisingly good deal if given the chance.  The headliners come on at 10pm usually, so if you can hold off, sneak to the main bar, and grab a bunch of drinks, then you might just go ahead and beat Vegas for once.

You can hear the act throughout Bowl so once you get up you can sit outside, at the main bar, or in the venue and listen.  I recommend coming early to at least hear the opener (if not see), and just hang on the Bowl balcony and people watch.

Pros: Plenty of diverse standing room. If you are a shorty, you may actually get to see the drummer. The lighting was great. It was similar to the tribute show I saw before. It was perfect for the small-ish venue. It made the show feel at once more intimate and exciting. 

Cons: The sound was iffy. The bass was solid, but at times was allowed to overwhelm the already effects laden vocals. 

There are two bars, which is good news for thirsty folks. The lanes are adorable. I believe you can rent one for the night for around $400? But don't quote me on that.",Up425JN4Thf3kThLTZIA9w,6,4,5,vIFXY7R191MO0lDZzz-f3g

Starting with the restaurant, I had the steamed fish... who am I kidding, the menu is basically chicken, chicken, oh and, did you see this other chicken? So, I went for the chicken! Once with a waffle for brunch, and more recently, the fella and I split the Mixed Chicken@ dinner, complete with mashed potatoes and a sub-in of mixed greens. I'd say, there is a huge portion here to split, and that made for a very reasonable a tasty dinner. Seriously, could not have tried  dessert if my life depended on it! Had a couple drinks, an enjoyable time and on to the show (I must say, having everything under one smooth roof is a super bonus of this spot).

On to the venue... if perhaps the food sits in a little above mediocrity, for a Vegas concert venue on the Strip, I've been most impressed with their venue. Very easy to navigate between the patio and stage area. Plenty of room. Even in a full house, I have yet to feel claustrophobic like some other Vegas places give me the blues when I'm packed in like a sardine... See what I did there? Also, with your wristband, you can come and go, another big bonus.

Last experience was the bowling. When we played it was up to 8 people for $100 per hour, included shoe rentals and some great graphics, music and service.

First I have to say the place is really bad debt which is awesome they have multiple bars so everyone's not just crowded standing around that one bar waiting to be served, they also provide upstairs and the downstairs section for bowling.. Upstairs is usually for VIP downstairs is general but either way it goes I still enjoyed myself and the downstairs part was the only part open.

I also noticed they were setting up for a concert while we were there playing bowling which is pretty cool and away because it's not just a bunch of bowling balls hitting the floor and pens falling you also have some music to listen and dance along to you as you bowl with your friends.. However it be in a live band that night it was kind of noisy!!

We decided to order some food while we were there the menu has a pretty brief selection of food and snacks for you and your associates to enjoy. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad which was pretty yummy we had a side of shrimp cocktail which really wasn't the greatest and an order of eight piece chicken wings which were pretty alright I just wish they were cooked crispier than they were..

The place was pretty empty which made me a little nervous but we decided to stick around. We sat in the restaurant area near one of the bars. 

I ordered the cajun catfish with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The catfish was blackened with minimal cajun spices. It wasn't really spicy but it was decent. It's always a gamble when ordering seafood at restaurants that aren't known for their fresh fish but I was happy with my entree. The fish was fresh and most importantly they didn't burn it. The mashed potatoes and greens were excellent as well. The food definitely wasn't typical ""bar food."" It was much better than I expected. My sister ordered the pulled pork. She enjoyed her food as well. We both ordered the rum punch to drink. That was excellent as well. 

The service was great... the staff was really friendly. Our waitress even let me charge my phone at the bar. While we were there we found out that they were going to have live music later that evening so we decided to return after 9pm.

We ended up seeking this band from France called Caravan Palace. The place wasn't filled to capacity but it was a good size crowd. We ended up near the front of the stage off the the side with a near perfect view. We had a few drinks and just enjoyed the music. It was nice and relaxing. We enjoyed it so much that we ended up going back to BB to catch the Prince tribute they had a few days later. 

The place doesn't seem to do as much business as one would expect and that's a shame. It's a really spacious venue perfect for parties or a simple night out on the town. Check out their show schedule and do yourself a favor by stopping in.",c3j7Ew9lIzJjbCJTdGzutQ,0,0,5,2h2znISg1CdfKdBQvoVjJw

Luckily for us, we secured a spot next to the sound booth where no one could block us from our view. 

Each of the artists did their thing and got the crowd going with their hits and it was a damn good time! During his set, J-Boog even got a little starstruck when Wanya Morris from Boyz II Men  came out on the stage and hummed a few melodies alongside him! 

MARY JANE WAS HERE!
You know for a fact that with any live music concert that someone's gonna bring Pakalolo(weed) to the party, and sure enough that familiar smell permeated the air and it reaked of ganja throughout the evening! 
Also with all the alcohol flowing, you almost always anticipate a brawl to go down because of some doofis trying to pick a fight with another random dude. Yes,  there was that doofis,  but lucky he didn't get on anybody's nerves enough to get beat down. 

We managed to squeeze out during the last song of the evening (or shall I say early morning?) To avoid the crowd, and I was so lucky that the second hand smoke didn't impair my drive home!  ALOHA!!!

Was looking for a cool place for my besties' bachelorette & found Brooklyn Bowl's website advertising a really bomb package. Like most things, it's too good to be true! I sent in a booking request for early August expecting at least a decent idea of the cost, information on when I could book, & confirmation of what the package included. 

What I got was a sales associate asking me if I could wait to be booked/given exact pricing ""at the end of July"" (I was trying to book for the second weekend of August), telling me that on a night without a concert their lanes are $95 per lane per hour (I saw one of the Yelp reviewers say she paid $75 & then had a group next to hers tell her they paid $25 to which a manager replied ""tough shit-wrong sales associate"" basically), & then tell me that days with concerts can be anywhere from $250-$1000... zero mention of bachelorette package. 

So I decided to dig a little through Yelp & figure out what this place was really about. Suspicions confirmed! There's NO WAY I'm going to have our bachelorette party of 10-12 wait until the last minute just to be told that a bowling alley is going to charge us over $100 each because they happened to book some talent we may or may not like, then best case scenario show up & have nowhere to sit (because apparently their lanes aren't very accommodating), have shitty service, eat shitty food, & not even be able to complain about any of it due to horrendous management all while being worried we might be kicked out by power happy bouncers... & that's if we aren't screwed out of either our package (because apparently they're in to false advertising) or our entire booking anyway in favor of a private event (how did I see multiple reviews with this issue?)! 

Do you people even care if you miss out on business? No one even responds to any of these shitty Yelp reviews & all the good ones aren't very thorough. I'll take our party of 10-12 FEMALES elsewhere! This is Vegas after-all... 

Update: Received a final email from Sales Associate, no apologies about not being able to book a large event ahead of time, just a simple ""unfortunately that's all I can do for you"". What a waste of time- I'm not waiting until 2-3 weeks out to book a large event & I don't know who would. Horrible customer service.",Ne4S_C9TtmDR5s0xMAJMzw,3,0,1,JFv5Z25m_IzaDLo_YG7wWg

Bowling is not fun during the dark. The stage is a little awkward while watching concerts. The drinks are overpriced because your on the strip. I also don't really like the acoustic environment when your watching the shows. Might need to find a better engineer who can mix.,P4XUvN_8alI6dpTC_3LMkg,1,0,3,QfF1sFRAhUU8k234EKxmkA

First things first, you can not leave Brooklyn Bowl without trying the Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken.  It is ridiculously delicious!!

Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken --  http://bit.ly/1njeypC
1/2 Fried Chicken served with White Toast, Mashed Potatoes, Collard Greens with Bacon and Honey
I ordered the Mixed dinner which comes with drumstick, breast, thigh, and wing.  It doesn't get any better than Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken.  This was so good, especially at 1am in the morning!  Believe the hype!  The chicken was perfectly fried, crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside with a ton of flavor!  Try  them with habenero sauce and honey for maximum yum effect!  I totally doused my chicken with all that.  This was probably one of the best Fried Chicken I've ever ate.

Of course, the menu at Brooklyn Bowl is so extensive, I came back a couple nights later because I was really curious about their French Bread Pizzas.

The Theresa -- http://bit.ly/1nrpaD8
Mushrooms, Butternut Squash, and Roasted Garlic.
This French Bread Pizza was pretty impressive! It came loaded with mushrooms and squash and tasted really good!   Definitely not the Stouffers pizza that you grew up with.   I really underestimated this pizza because I was stuffed halfway through and boxed up the rest to take to my room.  Probably better to share with a group, but if you're really hungry, it should fit the bill nicely.  Next time I'm probably going to try the Classic or San Gennaro.

I haven't been to the original Brooklyn Bowl in Brooklyn so I can't really compare the two or say how closely it resembles it, but it's definitely a must-see spot on the Strip.  I will be back again to maybe go for a couple rounds of bowling, check out what concert is happening, and definitely to try the rest of their menu, and of course, more Fried Chicken!!",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,8,10,5,CDCzUFzOcuZ75CC0g_Z3vQ

Me & my friends got bored as shit during the 1975 so we decided to eat at the little restaurant right there by the bowling alley. You don't get a freaking restaurant with a view of the stage in many or any venue! I had a blast at this venue. If I had paid probably a ridiculous amount for an upgraded ticket I could have even probably reserve a bowling alley and they even have screens on above the pin showing the concert even though the stage was right there. And bars, bars at every corner. 

Man I had a great experience here. Awesome performance by the Naked & Famous. Ate these bomb ass ""Rock n' Roll"" French fries. Idk if I was just hungry as shit but those fries would be enough for me to come back even if there wasn't a concert haha. That lime margarita I had wasn't too bad either.

3792070,2016-02-09,3,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Went to Brooklyn Bowl the saturday before the superbowl because Emily King was performing there. We bought tickets to the concert, then paid $350 to rent a lane for the night that included shoe rental, bowling, and $250 worth of food an drinks. Shoe rental was fine buy me, and the balls were fine for bowling, the reason why this place gets such low stars is the customer service.

To start out, I didn't like the ""lane rental"" seating could comfortably fit three, maybe four people. I've rented a lane at a bowling alley once for a party, if you're charging that much for a lane, make the space comfortable for more than 4 people. There were 6 of us, and while three where sitting on the couch, other had to either stand, or on this little bench where the balls were. That was annoying. 

Secondly, we saw our waiter very little. He didn't take our order (someone else did) and he barely came back for when we wanted to order more food. Our table (that we shared with another group) stayed packed with dishes and cups that we were done with for the duration of our night. I have a picture of my friend cleaning up the table to make room that I'll post shortly. If he's not going to be around, then we won't leave a big tip; oh but we did. Gratuity was 23% and we HAD to pay it because there were 6 of us. WTF! Really tho?!

My friends found the food sub-par, and the mixed drinks lacking alcohol. I however enjoyed my glass of margarita with the cheap tequila (at $12 a cup, really?!). It lasted me all night. We ordered a pitcher of the Rum Punch and while a pitcher should pour at the very least four glasses, our ice filled pitcher poured 2 1/2. We had to send it back to point out that half the pitcher was ice, and only 2 people could drink from it. Why do we have to send back a pitcher and point this out to you?

We bowled and enjoyed Emily King, and the acts before her. I appreciated the concert being played on screens above the pins, even though our lane (#8) had a decent view of the stage.

When the concert was over, and we were settling our bill, JUST as we were going to pay, we noticed we'd been charged for three items that wasn't ours, and management weren't very nice about clearing it up. They told us they confused our bill with the people that we shared a table with, but I'm pretty sure the three items we were charged for, the other group had not ordered either. Maybe if the waiter were more attentive, that wouldn't have happened.


Overall, I'd skip Brooklyn Bowl if I were ever in Vegas again. While I appreciated the smoke free air (Vegas is a smoking city and it's DISGUSTING) that 23% automotatic gratuity for below average service did me in! I'm good.",x4UhScafPeIF1e2lQoyRNA,8,1,2,H-owCcZi_7KPv325AvQkOQ

I went to a show there a month ago.  I paid in advance for a VIP bowling lane.  I called ahead of time to ask if I could bring a cake, since we were celebrating my wife birthday.  The office person said no problem just pay the cake cutting fee $2.50 per person, no problem.  Upon arrival the staff seemed completely baffled as to why I would want to bring in a cake, who said I could bring in a cake, if I could bring in a cake or even what a cake was.  I had to speak to 3 different managers who do not speak to one another and got 3 different answers as to who to take the cake to, what they should do with it, etc. etc. There is little to 0 communication between the staff and zero between the staff and patrons.  They have the typical venue staff ""Why are you bothering me"" attitude if u ask them what's open, what's not, what time the show starts, etc.  At first I wasn't going to post the review and just chalk it up to a bad night until I went last night to see a friend from out of town perform.  He added me to the guest list and upon arrival the hostess informed me that I wasn't.  My friend in the band again assured me that I was but it was clear to me then just as it was the previous visit that THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION  between anyone there.

Being a fried chicken connoisseur, I know how to tell what's sufficient, adequate, and optimal. This fried chicken battered in matzo and seasoned with some kind of magic dust is a first ballot hall of famer.

The crunch is one to remember. Matzo gives it a unique taste and texture you're likely not to have experienced. The seasoning is whimsical. Flavorful, but not overwhelming. Spiced, but not hot. However you decide to order just plan to for everyone to have at least two pieces. We ended up with 16 after initially ordering 8.

Here's what took this place to a five: Buttermilk pancakes. Yes, that good and I don't even like pancakes. First off, it can feed a small family of four or two hungry versions of myself. Yup, couldn't finish it. Maybe in my college years I could have done it. The pancake had crunch on the outside yet remained extremely fluffy in the inside. I've never had a perfect pancake and if I ever had to declare one to be flawless I'd put house money and my life savings on this recipe.

My suggestion is that share it so you can enjoy at least two pieces of chicken :)

Brooklyn Bowl is a House of Blues meets Lucky Strike in my opinion, although the menu is heavily soul food influenced.

I'll admit it. The main reason I came in the first time was for the fried chicken dinner and it was extremely filling.

The chicken itself was good, but I'm not sure it was worthy of some of the lofty praise that I've heard on TV and here on Yelp. And I even dipped some of that chicken in a mixture of honey and hot sauce that was the in-house recommendation to add even more flavor.

I might even argue that the collard greens were the best thing on my plate. They were simply sensational. No complaints on my mashed potatoes and gravy either.

There was even a second trip back down the promenade to try the Chicken Muffaleta (Never saw that anywhere else on a menu), but Brooklyn Bowl was sadly closed entirely that night for a private event. 

While I didn't bowl or attend a concert, I would certainly do either here and think it would be very enjoyable.

They have an afternoon Happy Hour and another starting at midnight with half-priced drafts and appetizer specials. And if you find a young lady named Angela working one of the bars, stop right there, sit down and enjoy her sweet smile and excellent service.

Not that I had one, but PBR drafts are way overpriced at Brooklyn Bowl. Honestly, if you're going to ask for over $6 for that beer...there really is no reason to even have it on tap. 

And just as I was finishing dinner, they started up karaoke and I honestly couldn't pay my check fast enough. While I dislike karaoke anywhere, the volume here was way too loud considering I was sitting nowhere near where they were doing it.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,3,3,3,wFixZV3PY4wuihmTQa-Ahw

3896810,2014-06-08,3,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.

SUMMARY:  This restaurant can be summed up with a simple statement: interesting concept, horrible execution.  
Save your money.  There are tons of wonderful restaurants & interesting eateries in Las Vegas.  With such strong competition, you don't need to waste your time in a place like Brooklyn Bowl--the food is reasonably tasty, but not worth the absolutely horrible service.  This is not the kind of restaurant you want to take your family to espescially if you have small kids--it's amazingly loud, and you will have to shout somewhat to talk to one another.  The ONLY reason I didn't give this place 1 star: the manager who at least attempted to salvage the situation.

My brother-in-law serves in the Navy in Marlyand.  His wife is temporarily living in Las Vegas with thier 7-month-old daughter so she can finish the internship requirement of her photography degree.  As a surprise birthday present to his wife, my in-laws arranged to have their son flown in for a little less than a week so they can spend time together.  When she walked onto the High Roller, she had no idea that her husband would be arriving to surprise her; it was a wonderful time on the 30-minute ride with her husband, daughter, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law (my wife), niece (my 3-week-old daughter) and me.  After our fun ride, we had a 7 PM reservation for a meal at Brooklyn Bowl.  Or so we thought.

Upon our arrival, the two very rude hostesses kept asserting that they didn't have our reservation, despite the printed reservaton confirmation we provided.  Frankly, I don't care whether The Linq concierge failed to transmit the reservation to Brooklyn Bowl or whether someone at Brooklyn Bowl failed to input the reservation into their system.  I don't care whose fault it is because I know one absolute thing--IT ISN'T OUR FAULT.  After pressing the issue with the manager and Concierge for over 15 minutes, the seven of us (a friend joined us after the ride on the High Roller) with two chidren in tow were finally crammed into one booth.  I asked if we could be seated at the vacant table next to us, but the hostess said it was reserved for another party.  Then she rudely added, ""Just like the table we're giving to your party.""  I felt like defending our position as their customers (who had placed a reservation, confirmed by our printout), but I figured, why fight with someone who barely makes more than minimum wage?  I've got better things to do & accomplish in life.

I hoped that our waiter would finally provide a semblance of good service.  To be completely honest, he was accommodating and friendly.  However, at best, the wait staff were quite absent-minded.  Food orders arrived incomplete.  Drinks took quite a while to be refilled.  (It's 100 degrees outside, the food is very salty and the glasses aren't very large... safe to say, a waiter's got to work to keep those glasses filled!)  The food was average; I ordered the fried chicken dinner, and while it was reasonably tasty, the chicken was overcooked so the coating tasted slightly burned.  

The manager was kind enough to provide our party with desserts on the house for the oversight  & trouble regarding our reservation, and the poor service we received before being seated.  I thought, ""Now THIS guy knows how to treat a customer... that must be one reason why he's a manager.""  We ordered desserts to go, since the kids started to get fussy.  When they arrived, we found that we were missing some desserts.  Wow, even the ""apology"" dessert order couldn't be fulfilled properly.  Like I said before, nice concept/idea... horrible execution.  

There's much more I could explain about the horrible service we received, what I witnessed at the tables around us & what those diners were saying about their waiter(s) and the poor service I witnessed being given by the hostess to other potential diners (some who were unfortunate enough to not have a reservation and were rudely told off).  Frankly, I'm tired of writing.  But take my word for this, poor service is a strong theme in this place, even on a night that wasn't particularly busy.",AZUF5EVwh-W08nrFTbKM4A,5,2,2,zZVutAMBD7EorqM_cnbrNA

He agreed so he shut down 1 lane and our party played until the lanes were shut down...... Now mind you my party ate and drank $13 drinks the whole time we were there....... So when I got  the final bill for the additional time.. It contained the 4th lane. Of course I asked for the error to be corrected Jay argued with me for 10 minutes about how he let us go over etc... And if he wanted to be a jerk he could charge us for every minute....... Not great business practice.....

Alright. At the door will be an able-bodied jester imploring passers-by to come on in to the ""World Famous Brooklyn Bowl."" Honestly, I've been to Brooklyn, NY for shows and had never insomuch as heard of Brooklyn Bowl until it opened the outpost (BBLV) here in Las Vegas. In any case, their jesters are entertaining, as is requisite in their job description. 

The box -- both regular (which is outside) and will call/guest list (inside) -- are staffed by competent and friendly professionals. And, that shall be a recurring theme with BBLV: nearly every area has the utmost professional staff in terms of hospitality for a music venue. Only other venue that even comes to mind that surpasses is MSG and every one knows that the Garden just happens to be the Platinum Standard when it comes to professionals. 

--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­-----------------------

Once inside -- whether grasping a ticket or otherwise* -- you should have three choices on any given night: bowl, eat, or listen to live music. If Jack White or My Morning Jacket are playing, you won't be bowling, you jerkface. You really shouldn't bowl if anyone is performing, out of respect, however, you purchased the lane so do whatever the hell you want. Lanes during shows vary depending on the artist. It's not really my thing to do; however, I have had a lane during a show and we simply left it abandoned with purses from our party when the artist went on. 

*There are unticketed, free shows every once in a while.

Pro Tip: The security won't watch your lane even if you have the first two ones which are located right next to where he is posted. No biggie. 

Like most venues of its size -- think the original The Joint or House of Blues -- there is the wood floor pit and an elevated second level that surrounds the floor area where there are bars and vertically challenged concert-goers. Additionally, this may be the spot for you that simply wishes not to be jostled about in the mosh pit, if at a show where one develops. Beware of the chatty people who attend shows every so often to have the live music serve as background to their philistine conversations about nothing. 

Pro Tip: Wear hearing protection. The good kind cuts off the highs (most harmful), thus silencing the talkers, and making the music sound better as well. 

Unlike other venues of its size, they are actually booking artists who simply would not stop in Vegas if it were not for BBLV, or do so a lot less often. I can't think of a time when MMJ would've stopped in Vegas and I wouldn't fathom a two-night stint from the badass rockers if it were not for BBLV.  

Pro Tip: My Morning Jacket's two sets in two nights was shekel for shekel the best several hours of music in years in this valley. One has to go back to Leonard Cohen's seven hours at Colosseum or the B/S eight-set mini residencies to capture that magic. If you don't know what I am talking (writing) about, you need to get out more.

--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­-----------------------

I won't expound too much on bowling (who cares?) or the food (probably ... nay: for sure the best out of any music venue) because who comes to a concert venue for that? The bowling is bowling. The fried chicken is phenomenal. I don't remember which dessert I got but that was probably on account of all the cannabis smoke in the air during The Wailers.

Pro Tip: They are not lenient when it comes to smoking in here. Security will take it for ""safekeeping."" Burning Man this is not. 

Lastly, they might have the best house photographer on Earth with the handiwork of the versatile Erik Kabik behind the 1D X.

3963566,2014-07-10,2,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"The brand new ""Brooklyn Bowl"" in the new ""Linq"" area of Vegas (behind Harrah's) is both amazing and a disappointment:

Food - 5 stars. Some of the menu options are ridiculously pricey, ie: 8 pieces of honey fried chicken for $24, but the daily specials are amazing. $10 for a HUMONGOUS fried chicken sandwich with fries. The fried chicken was perfect, with honey drizzle and hot sauce. Perfection! The brisket with southern slaw and collared greens was delish.

Drinks - pricey. Maybe $2 too pricey with $12-15 drinks for a non-club.

Service - 5 stars all the staff is really attentive.

Marketing - 1 star. This is where it fails. From the outside half the people I asked said it looked like a bowling alley, the other half said a small concert venue. Both are correct. It's so hard to see inside that you don't realize how gigantic it is inside with multiple floors, awesome decor and tons of room, indoor and outdoor patios, to roam and explore.

Give it a shot and tell their staff to work on marketing it from the outside. It's worth it once they come in.",WnzRueYdRWNSbkXB0_0i4Q,3,2,4,E6q8DRgdz0jigsqlUQFe5A

The acoustics aren't the best, but the space is top-notch. It's standing room only, but there's plenty of room on the large wooden floor to rock out and bounce to the music. If you get tired of the crowds, you can move back into an open bar area with very limited seating. If you're a high roller, you can reserve one of the bowling lanes for the duration of the live performance (but it'll cost you a pretty penny). The best feature of the venue is the large outdoor deck where you can catch some fresh air or leave for a smoke. I also LOVE that there are televisions all around that broadcast the show live so you never miss a minute.

The bar can get a little crowded but there's 3 bars in the area you can order from in the concert section of the venue.  We usually eat at the restaurant either before or after the concert and will always order the fried chicken, don't miss this!! I always say I'm going to try some of the other items on the menu especially the desserts but after a few beers and pieces of fried chicken I'm usually done for the night.  Wait times for food can be little long from what I've noticed so just prepare for that.  If you're planning on a concert and dinner expect to spend about $30/each for show tickets, $15 fried chicken and $8 for beer.

A group of friends and I went to the Brooklyn Bowl to see Pepper, a Hawaiian band. Upon entrance through security all of our drivers licenses were checked. One member of our group was stopped because they thought hers was a fake. They made her sign her name on a paper to verify that it matched her drivers license and when their ""professional eyes"" didn't feel that it matched, they did not allow her entrance into the establishment and she was kicked out and not allowed to re-enter. The rest of the group of course followed and asked the security guard what was going on and he explained that she ""didn't pass his inspection"". I personally asked to speak with the head of security who told us that he didn't feel that her license was legitimate due to the fact that her signature didn't match her license close enough. I asked him if we could go home and get another form of ID such as a passport in order to verify it. To which he rudely replied, ""No. I already explained to her the she isn't allowed here"" and I asked, ""you won't accept a passport?"". To which he replied very rudely, ""I'm not listening to this, she can't come in"". I then explained to him that we all came as a group and collectively paid over $150 for our night out and that this situation is absurd"". He then replied, and I quote, ""that's not my problem!! NOW she has to leave"" 
Brooklyn Bowl, you seriously need to consider reformatting your leadership structure and employ someone who can respond and perform in a professional manner.

In the beginning my friend was told there were plenty of lanes available and so we could sit in the bar area for awhile.  We were told we were not allowed to reserve a lane the same day and should have reserved a lane at least a week in advance.  (Not sure what the difference is if you have a credit card and willing to pay but ok, rules are rules.)  I ordered a soda and the fried pickles- the fried pickles were good and moderately priced at $8.  My husband had a corona; I didn't ask about anyone's dinners but they had salmon and sloppy joe's.  After eating at a bar table with two servers that we rarely saw but were friendly we moved on to ask about getting a lane.  An employee told us they no longer had any lanes available and that we could come back in an hour.  After talking amongst ourselves my friend who the party was for and had been there the week before decided to try again and ask for a manager.  This time the employee she spoke to was super understanding and said she would try to work us in in the next half-hour.  That employee had recognized her from the week before and totally tried to work with us.  The bowling lanes were nice and they had table service there.  The music was Grateful-Dead-type music which wasn't my thing but it was kind of neat to see.  There were a ton of elder clientele stoned out of their minds and I could smell weed everywhere.  The security didn't give anyone with weed a hard time yet gave my police officer husband a terrible time about bringing a gun in.  The first time we entered the security team missed the gun even with their metal detectors so we walked right in.  The second time we walked in (an hour later) they refused him entry and he had to walk back to the car.  I was assured it isn't illegal to do this so OK.  I just thought the security at the door could have been much nicer about it- especially since they weren't doing such a great job at scanning people anyways.  If something was to go down at Brooklyn Bowl (since the security team is so-so) then let me tell you I don't trust this security team to do anything to protect me and I would prefer a trained law enforcement officer be around to assist (off duty or not.)  None of us gave the security a hard time over their rules and I do think they could have been a lot nicer.  I don't think it is worth going back here but it was cool to see.

Their favorite trick is to be intentionally deceptive about the start time of their shows.  The rest of the civilized world uses the qualifiers ""show time"" or ""doors open"" to communicate clearly to their customers.  Not so at the BB where they make the ridiculous claim that it's ""technically impossible"" to be honest in their advertising and on their tickets.  Their misguided strategy, apparently, is to bring people in for what they think is an 8pm show and then surprise them with the news that nothing will happen until 930pm.  I suppose they think that this pathetic sleight of hand will persuade you to sit down and enjoy their very marginal food and drink--reviewed on Yelp separately and not so positively

When you discuss this issue with ""management,"" they acknowledge that they get complaints, but why should customer feedback force any reflection?  It must be because the customer just does not matter.

Went to a show with friends, split the fee for the reserved couch area, $300 for the couch on a Friday night?  You cannot beat that, a super amazing deal, the $300 is a food/beverage credit.  So, if you have friends like mines, then eating and drinking up $300 of worth of stuff is an easy task.

As a group, we ordered (scale rating 1 - 5):
- Baked Mac & Cheese
baked in a small casserole dish, underneath a crunchy layer of cheese is creamy spiral noodles.  Even though the noodles were cooked perfectly and it had the right ratio of creamy-ness to noodle was great, it lacked flavor for me.  My favorite part of the dish was the 'cheese crust', cheese broiled into that bubbly goodness, once cool it's like a gooey, crunch, chewy cheese Chip. YASSSSSSS and please, cheese chips all day. 
Rate: 3 

- Rock -n- Roll Fries
I would and will order these everytime I come here, this is the American version of Poutine.  Shortstring fries, smothered in house gravy,melted on top a mix of provolone and cheese, sprinkled with some kind of cajun spice.  You know it's good when you wipe you finger along the bottom of the plate to sop up what is left of the gravy.  Yes I did and it was finger licking good.  Despite the french fries being slathered in gravy, there is still a light crisp to the french fry when you bite into it.  It is enough to share with 4, but I'm telling you, you may want to order 2 orders...1 for the group and 1 for you.
Rate: 5 (HELLS YA THIS IS A STRONG 5)

- Really Sloppy Joe
in my Homer Simpson voice ""mmmmm, really sloppy joe"", this was a surprise to me.  I liked a lot better than I thought I would.  The mac&cheese may have been lacking flavor for me, but the Sloppy Joe was a PARTY OF FLAVORS!  Piled high, spilling over, packed between a sesame seed bun.  Sweet and tangy beef, diced onions and green peppers, not too WET to where it looks like soup with a side order of bread, nor too DRY to where it meat is crumbly like taco meat on a bun.  that is a TORTA, I did not order a Torta, I ordered a REALLY SLOPPY JOE and it was just right.  Now take some Rock -n- Roll and break a piece of sloppy joe off, put fries on top of and/or inside of bun (choose your pleasure) and E-N-J-O-Y.  It is total UMAMI!
Rate: 5

- Chicken Wings
for me, not my favorite. breaded wings, it was crunchy but not seasoned.  A little salt and pepper...um, no. Maybe some Lawry's seasoning salt?  Have the dipping and hot sauces near by.  When you're drinking though, it doesn't matter, buuuuutttttt.....if you stack some Rock -n- Roll on top, man U-M-A-M-I

The fried chicken was top notch. Loved the seasoning on it. Probably the best I've had in this city (Note: Vegas isn't really known for fried chicken). Super juicy, but not too greasy. Real good combo with some beer (Magic Hat on tap) . Came up to $20 for 4 pieces of chicken, collared greens, mashed potatoes, and a slice of white bread. Wasn't too hungry so I shared it with a friend. Good stuff to munch on while waiting. You can either eat indoors or outdoors with a view of the Linq that's great for people watching.

As a music venue, it's really great too. It's just an overall fun atmosphere to be around. Plenty of bars, lots of walking room, and a outdoor 2nd story patio for some air. I also liked the fact that you can get away from the stage to some seats where you can actually hear conversations with company.

I didn't get to try out the bowling, but the alley looked really modern and trendy. More upscale than most bowling alleys that I've seen.

All in all, a really great venue that offers a lot to do. It looks like they have some great artists lined up to perform in the future. I'm definitely going to be dropping by here often.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,5,5,5,QYRPr2vn0dQ0RLXRxePs5w
4247612,2014-08-19,1,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Food: Ordered the trout salad and dark pieces of chicken. The salad had a mustard seed vinaigrette which added a nice kick to this refreshing salad. The trout was seasoned nicely and tasted amazing. Now for the chicken, simply put, was the greatest fried chicken I've had. The skin was crispy and flakey, seasoned with multiple spices, and fried to perfection. The meat was moist, juicy, and just perfect. 

Venue: Attended the Honda Civic Tour Group which presented Tokyo Police Club, Portugal. The Man, and Grouplove. The venue had two floors. Bowling lanes on both floors and bars everywhere. The beers are cheap (for Vegas $7-11), and the tickets were only $42! And this was the greatest concert and venue I've ever been to.  Definitely better than all the EDM clubs, the crowd won't harass you, no bumping and elbows, chicks aren't getting grinded on by creepers. Just good vibes and no losers.

The restaurant bar tends to be faster service than the bar in the concert area. They have had some great artists at this venue and I hope that continues. Park at the linq outdoor parking. It is free right now for locals for the first 24 hours. It is great that is it part of the Linq promenade because when this place closes other places nearby are still open and we can bar hop!

Not just deleesh bc of the sweetness, which really didn't look that bad, just chocolate sauce, but the texture of the bread pudding was just right; a light crunch, amazingly not too soggy given how the vanilla ice cream melted right away.  Recommend for sure.

I asked her if there was a different list and she said there was only one.  I gave her the name of my friend that got me the tickets; she wasn't on it either.  And for some stupid reason the list was sorted by first name rather than last name.  So the girl confirmed that neither of our names were there and just stared at me and showed NO concern.  So I said I would call my friend up because she set it all up.  I waited in the cold for almost an hour because my friend was in the concert and couldn't hear her phone; I looked like a total idiot.  There was nothing I could do; so, I finally decided to leave, and halfway home I got a call from my friend and explained what happened.  She went down to check - AND MY NAME WAS ON THE LIST.

4701313,2014-05-12,4,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Tickets: BBLV utilizes Ticketfly for online sales. There is a service charge on orders, however, their website doesn't state how it is calculated (it was $6.93 on a $25 ticket). For delivery options, Print-at-Home and Will Call are free, standard mail is $3.50, and UPS 2nd-Day Air is $17.95. The box office is your best bet. There are no service charges and obviously, you don't have to worry about delivery. The downside: there is a credit/debit card processing fee of $3/ticket. However, if you buy your tickets with cash, there are absolutely NO fees! I can't remember the last time I was able to buy a ticket at the posted price.

Shows: The stage is located next to the bowling lanes, near the back of the property. You can actually view it from the lanes and some areas of the dining room. The space is General Admission (standing room only) with VIP sky boxes on both sides of the stage. Ruben and I visited last month for The Naked and Famous show with The 1975 and White Lies. We arrived after the posted ""Doors Open at.."" time, but they weren't allowing anyone to enter, so we were directed to wait on the stairs (with the line starting next to the dining area). Security was rather strict with bag searches, pat-downs, and ID checks. Some shows are 18+ or 21+, so I'm assuming a wristband meant the latter. I like the intimate space of the stage area and this particular show was really great! The sound was good and the venue in general was really cool. The screens on the bowling lanes showed live feed of the show, so it's not a bad idea to reserve a lane instead of buying a ticket. Plus, the stage is open air, so I'm sure the music can be enjoyed everywhere. I would definitely see a show here again.

I haven't had a chance to bowl or try the menu yet (I've had the Blue Ribbon chicken at their Cosmopolitan location), so I'll add it to my review in the future! Anyway, it's a great place to hang out and I love the versatility of the venue.

IMPORTANT Update (12/15/14): The box office does NOT charge a credit card fee anymore. However, there is a standard $2 fee on every ticket purchased at the box office. Still MUCH cheaper than purchasing online!! The processing fee on Ticketfly's website was $10 and some change for a $35 ticket. It's ridiculous.

4723727,2016-06-07,1,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Really not the best venue to go to if you're a serious concert-goer.

This venue primarily caters towards the teen-21 year old crowd as many of their concerts are often General Admission/Standing Room Only.  My fiancée and I went to a concert there back in 2014 of White Lies/The 1975/The Naked & Famous.  We were really only there to see White Lies and The Naked & Famous.  

Seeing one of my favorite bands (White Lies) perform first was a great thrill.  They performed about 7 or 8 songs and then left the stage as the crew prepped for The 1975.  During our time on the floor, it was very crowded and not very comfortable.  A lot of people brought in backpacks with them and some people just kept swinging them all over the place bumping into us.  Also, and I guess you have to expect this at standing room only venues, we were constantly having to deal with people pushing through the audience to get to the very front of the stage.

I really think they could do better with security control with allowing people to only be so close to the stage and I really think they should make it mandatory for all bags/backpacks to be checked or install lockers for safekeeping.

After White Lies we decided to have some food in the lounge.  I got to try their ""famous"" Blue Bell fried chicken.  This was extremely hot, which was good, but also made it incredibly difficult to eat right away.  I probably asked for extra napkins from a server three times until they finally showed up, and the chicken was still scorching hot to bite into.  I won't say that it was the best chicken ever, but it's not the worst either.

After a while, my fiancée and I decided it wasn't worth it to stick around waiting for The 1975 to finish up and to go back down to the floor and see The Naked & Famous perform.  Considering how huge the band's popularity is to the 21 and under crowd, we knew it'd be another nightmare waiting to happen when it came to the audience we'd end up being a part of.

I know a lot of famous musicians have performed at the Brooklyn Bowl over the last two years (Beck, Elvis Costello to name a few) but the problem is the fact that these events are open to people under 21 which means that there'll be tweens with backpacks and selfie sticks a-plenty.

Maybe I'm just a purist when it comes to concerts, but I just hate it when you're trying to enjoy the performances and your view is spoiled by over 200 people holding their arms up with their phones/selfie-sticks.

I haven't been back to Brooklyn Bowl since this concert, but honestly, it feels like I really don't need to attempt to give it a second chance.",m8d1HYOCF8WCfO3AuwiJSw,13,2,2,SyDhjwBPngOwCrTDf1e8Yg

I had a unique experience, as I was on a work assignment to do a news report about a musician performing at Brooklyn Bowl.  I showed up in Las Vegas, called the venue off-the-cuff, and Christi responded within minutes.

When my crew arrived for the shoot, Christi not only greeted us at the door, she also found us the best angles to shoot our video.  She was also quick on her toes.  Minutes after our live shot fell through inside the building, she made sure we were clear to videotape live on the Linq Promenade.

I must say that after spending a few minutes inside, I ended up falling in love with the venue itself.

For one, whoever does lighting for the concerts is amazing!

The proximity of the stage to the floor where the audience stands makes you feel like it's just you and the band in the room.

If you don't want to stand with the rest of the audience, there are areas on either side of the stage.

You can also sit at a bar close to the front entrance of the venue that's somewhat sectioned off from the stage area.

The reason it's called Brooklyn Bowl is because there is an actual bowling alley, stage left.  As I understand it, you can rent out a bowling lane as a VIP area during concerts.  Correct me, if I'm wrong.

All in all, I cannot wait to revisit Brooklyn Bowl off the clock.  It's a surprisingly intimate and amazing musical treasure that I never expected to find so close to the busy Las Vegas Boulevard strip.",aJRnjwJ3D4Knl9pRwOfKDg,3,2,5,bNo-LZgK2A40rrR1MtYfwg

This place sucks and gets one star for keeping the beer cold. Unless you are right in the front of the stage you won't be able to see the band. Who the F@CK designed this place. It's the worst layout for a ""concert"" venue I've been to. Unless you're over 6'0 don't even bother. I'm 6'0 and had a hard time seeing the band. WTF??

To the GM:
The bartenders are skimming. I was charged different prices for mixed drinks all night and bar staff take change automatically for tips. My total was $18 and I handed the bartender a $20 which he took to the register and walked away. I had to track him down and ask for my change. He looked pissed and tossed it at me and did not even say anything. Guess what, he just lost $2 cause I was going to tip him $2 had he given me change in the first place. 
As a service industry professional I was shocked by this!!

I will never return to this venue. As a local, this bummed me out. I do not recommend this venue at all!! But if u must go, drink before you go. They will rip you off. They love dopey drunk tourists!!",CLhwqxLbc4GsNLDUC0gaww,17,1,1,AwUYE3tjfv5PAPTbPI_Kmg

There is also a restaurant inside. They have the best fried chicken I've ever tried. The seasoning is just perfect and the chicken is so moist. You can either get a half chicken and choose all dark meat, all white meat, or a mix. And they can also do larger portions for big parties.

Food: 9.5/10

Me and my friends ordered calamari as appetizer and it was pretty good. Nice and crispy, lightly seasoned with a slight kick to it because of the chopped jalapeno fried along with the calamari. 

Fried Chicken 
The chicken was seasoned nicely. Tender and juicy definitely not dry. The toast that came with the chicken was a different story. It was Super dry. I don't know if the toast is usually like this but I say skip the toast if you're getting the chicken. 

The chicken came with a dipping sauce which came with Vinegar, Carrot juice and Jalapeno mixed with Honey. Honestly I was skeptical with the sauce but the server recommended it so I tried it and I was surprised how well the sauce/dip complimented the chicken. Honestly I would recommend the chicken and the sauce.

Ribeye Steak 
The portion size for the steak was pretty big and it was juicy but to me, it was heavily seasoned which took away from the taste of the steak. But that's a personal opinion. It also came with a huge portion of fries which was nicely seasoned and nicely fried.

Chocolate malt
Nothing special about the malt shake. It was a standard malt shake, nice and creamy but the serving size was a bit small 

Service: 10/10

The service was great! Samantha served us and she explained the works of the menu. She also told us about the sauce for the chicken and our water is always filled with water.

Overall good food and great service. Would definitely come back and recommend.",ULLBZkybKlh6Lp4Q6B_iHQ,1,1,5,o1mv6OG_Eevab0b8yMXjNA

Everything inside is pretty nice.  There is balcony for smoking and several bars and seated restaurant.  The problem is that this place is in the strip.  So what does that mean? It means there is a dude in the bathroom who gives you towels. That kinda ruins the whole dive bar flavor.  There is also heavy ass security like the other big clubs on the strip. I've seen several concerts here and there is always some 500 pound mexican guerilla standing above the dance floor watching closely.   I'm used to concerts in California, where you light up on the dance floor.  Not here.  Like all things in Las Vegas Strip, it is a cheap imitation of something better than exists elsewhere.  

The people who come here are a mix of old, young, locals and tourists.  Concerts definitely cater to different crowds.  While i'm not a huge fan, this place is definetly cooler than the typical chuck-e-cheese casino meets doucebag, techno, synethtic suites night club that dominate the casino.

I had called a month earlier and asked about a reservation, and she said since it was March Madness week the cheapest bowling reservation was $1,500.

I said no thanks and was bummed we wouldn't get to go. We walked by and went in anyway and didn't see anyone inside. I asked why and the hostess said we could get in for normal price before 2pm when they had reservations. I wasn't quite sure why I wasn't told this on the phone, but I didn't mind.

I had an Arnold Palmer to drink with some sort of alcohol in it. And it tasted great. We ordered fried chicken because the waitress recommended it. It was good but nothing amazing. We began bowling and our lane stopped working twice. The pins are on strings I think so they don't jump up when hit and make the loud bowling noise everyone is used to.

This is not a budget friendly outing though.  Food in the restaurant looked good and sounded good but it is on the pricey side. 20+ bucks for a fried chicken dinner (which I'm certain is very delicious). Drinks are overpriced just like the rest of the Strip.
This is also a very difficult concert venue for people who are handicapped or have disabilities.  Brooklyn Bowl earnestly attempts to accommodate those people who have challenges getting around following ADA guidelines. But its not a good place if you have any physical limitations
The concert venue has a cordoned off area for disabled people.  Sadly, there are those people who lie and say they are disabled to get in this area. It is cramped, over crowded and I believe not safe.  The general ""seating"" of the BB concert venue is STANDING room only for the most part.  The disabled section has seating and is in a really good location for seeing the stage. So people lie about being disabled to get in this area.  How do I know?  A few of them told me. They thought it was cool to pull off the scam.

4926759,2016-10-25,3,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"My incident that I'm writing about took place months ago, but due to JUST reading about other negative experiences on social media, I've decided to come here and tell MY story. 

 A friend of mine was on tour and playing the venue. He'd put me on the guest list. I'd JUST picked up my tickets at the box office when a large security guard approached. I had two tickets in my hand that he'd taken, which I thought he was about to scan and let me in. He then asked me to step outside. 

I saw someone outside the venue that I wasn't very fond of before I came in. I said nothing to them to provoke an incident, as I wasn't there for drama. They approached security and told them that I'd threatened to ""slit their throat"". I told the security guard this was a blatant lie. Not only did I NOT intend to kill anyone, I wasn't carrying an instrument to perform such a heinous act. He had a hand held metal detector and I asked him to use it. He told me it didn't matter, I wasn't coming in. He told me I had no choice but to leave. I was already outside and asked him to call the manager. He told me I had to get off their property, which I ALREADY WAS! We were standing in the Linq thoroughfare. 

Despite him threatening me, I refused to leave until I spoke with a manager. He was intimidating in a way that seemed he would have gotten physical if he weren't in plain view of hundreds of tourists passing by. 

When the manager came, with two other security guards, I calmly explained to him that I came there to have a good time seeing my friend's band play and NOT to kill anyone. I further explained that I've NEVER been to prison, that I intended to keep it that way, and as a grown man was QUITE well aware of the consequences of killing someone, ESPECIALLY in a public place. 

The manager STILL wasn't going to allow me in. So I went further by telling them that I've worked as venue security myself, which I have. I told him that I'd NEVER seen anything so ignorant as far as security goes to listen to hearsay and deny someone entry with NOTHING to back it up. I even said that I respected their job since I've done it myself, but that they were going the wrong way about it. NONE of that mattered to them. 

I was then told that even if my friend who was playing were to come out and give me an all access pass and walk me in, I'd STILL be denied. To say I was livid is an understatement. I asked for my tickets back so I could pass them along to someone else who'd like to see the show, and they wouldn't even give me MY tickets! 

I'm hearing other VERY similar stories on how the security and management behaves. I've even heard that they're intimidating to women without real provocation. This isn't security, these are PUNKS who are going to ultimately piss off the wrong person who can handle multiple security guards at one time and teach them a lesson the hard way. 

Needless to say, I have NOTHING nice to say about this place. I've LITERALLY missed shows I've wanted to see because they're booked there. I will NOT be patronizing them WITHOUT a full apology and a more friendly attitude. HOWEVER, I don't expect that to happen.

4957997,2018-04-09,2,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"I was told Brooklyn Bowl has the best fried chicken in Vegas.  I do not think it can beat Culinary Dropout's chicken, but the chicken at Brooklyn Bowl is strong and worth a try.  I had dinner at Brooklyn Bowl on a Sunday evening around 8.  The restaurant part of the of facility is basically a bar and if you get a seat near the window you have a nice view of the Promenade below.  The joint is dark and there are plenty of TVs and the tables are spaced apart so you are not on top of your neighbors.  Comfortable enough atmosphere.

I went with the wedge salad on a plate ($11.50 versus the larger salad which is $15.50) and the fried chicken, dark meat.  The salad arrived within 10 minutes of ordering.  It is doused in blue cheese dressing and good quality bacon.  The dressing uses nice blue cheese as well, very flavorful but it did need some pepper.  This salad was better than the wedge I had at Jean Georges the night before which cost nearly $20.  Definite re-order.

The chicken is served with collard greens and mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  This arrived nearly 30 minutes after I ordered, but it was not a huge problem.  They clearly make the chicken fresh, it was HOT when it arrived at the table.  Burn your mouth hot, so be advised.  That said, the chicken was really good.  It has a crispy skin that is seasoned well and adheres to the meat.  Further, it was not overcooked and the meat was very juicy.  Like I said, probably not the best I have had in Vegas, but definitely worth the hype and worth a shot.  Take advantage of the hot sauce and honey they give you.

The sides were excellent as well.  These were some of the better collards I have had lately.  Seasoned perfectly and wilted but not overcooked to the point of destruction.  The potatoes are basic but fluffy and you get a large order.  The gravy went well with the potatoes and chicken.

My only issue was with service.  Everyone was very friendly but my server would disappear for long stretches at a time, making refills an issue.  She was nice enough, just absent a lot.

Brooklyn Bowl's fried chicken lived up to its reputation.  I would definitely eat here again and probably just order the same thing.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,4,3,4,PqBSQigIOKOnWhnzMSGGvA

4986628,2014-08-09,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"So I've returned to Brooklyn Bowl a few times after experiencing some terrible service because although I was disappointed by their lack of efficient service the first few trips, the venue offers delicious and suuuuper tasty food treats, as well as some great live music. And I'm kind of in a work bowling league there too.

The past couple of experiences there have convinced me that not all BB staff are airheads. I've had a few very friendly bartenders that didn't dick around, and an even better waiter tending to us while eating at the restaurant. So because of this, I've decided to come back and give BB a better review; the review they originally should have gotten from me.

You'll definitely be seeing me again, considering that some of my favorite bands will play you in the future. Oh, and because the fried chicken, as well as the mash and collard greens, are so f-ing good.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,0,0,4,xTgN7X0fwWReU3dK712dkQ

The venue looks brand new--its immaculate and beautifully decorated. Staff was friendly.  To me, the layout and feel is very House of Blues.

It's like walking into a circus, but better. It's a concert, bowling alley, bar and restaurant all in one. What an awesome concept! 

Because it was a work party they had the whole second floor blocked off just for us. Super fancy! The second floor is a party all it's own. It has its own bar and bowling alley. Plus, the best view in the house! 

Once the food came out it was on. They brought out so much stuff. A veggie tray with the best blue cheese dressing, French fries covered in assorted cheeses, French bread pizzas with sausage and veggies, and my favorite thing the chicken!!!! Omg, the chicken it was amazing. I'm pretty sure it's Broasted chicken like at Chilly Jilly's in Boulder City. The chicken was so moist and crisp. I totally filled up on that. 

At the bar we were offered some free specialty drinks courtesy of Skyy Vodka. They were tasty although lacked a real shot of alcohol. 

We got to see local band the Retrolites who did some cover songs. Then WAR came on! They rocked the stage. The Brooklyn Bowl has an amazing sound system and even at floor level it's a great place to see a show. 

This was a great opportunity to experience the Brooklyn Bowl. The staff was super nice and so helpful. And I'll never forget that chicken!! Yay, chicken and WAR! What more could girl want!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,3,1,5,ewG3aopG4Ku4C2qqGffvew

First of all, the venue is set up poorly so that you can't see anything and you waste your time and money buying drinks that are hot, over priced and water down! Our experience started by ordering a few rounds, every time we got up to dance and let our new drinks covered on the table, the waiters would come remove them. This happened 3 times and at that point we had spent over $200 alone on alcohol. If you are a local you are getting charged 350% more for a beer that is shittier than any other place off the strip. It is a good concept however, poor management, business designed to rip off tourists/ customers in general and worst of all the Operations Manager Mike Kaupoe could care less that we were dissatisfied. I wouldn't even give this place any stars because when we asked for our money back, we were just given managers card with comped drinks that we will never get because we will NEVER GO BACK!

5041551,2014-03-15,11,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"I've had the wonderful opportunity to visit Brooklyn Bowl not once, but twice in one week and let me tell you, I couldn't WAIT to write this review.  Instead of writing a review the first time, I waited for two visits, so I could write a really well balanced review. I thought the first time was too good to be true. Man, I'm glad I waited...

FINALLY, a REALLY great space on the strip.  As a local, I try to stay away from the strip as it's too congested and inconvenient for the everyday life.  This place, will absolutely bring me back time and time again.  When you approach ""The BB,"" you'll notice a very aesthetically pleasing olden day-type cinema sign.  From the outside, it doesn't look that big, but don't let that fool you!  Once you enter, you'll make your way up the escalators.  To the right is a little bar, high top table seating area.  This area is full of large windows which offers great views of the Linq.  To the left of the concierge desk are the restrooms and a couple of ATM machines.  Pass the desk and there's either an outdoor space with table tops and a smoking section to the right, and a lovely restaurant with another bar!  Then, the good stuff:  Passed all that, is a HUGE concert venue area and 16 lanes of bowling.  WOW!  Don't worry, there's a few more bars to keep you liquored up all night long.  If that's not enough, make your way to top VIP area where there's lots of balcony space for the concert, sofas for seating and 16 more lanes to bowl on!  In the VIP area, there's also a bar, an outside roof deck and even a very eclectic living room which offers comfortable couches, big screen tvs, quirky signs and lights, all encompassed with a quieter atmosphere.  SOOO AWESOME!!!  

Brooklyn Bowl is full of amazing features. All around, there's leather couches, palm trees, artsy signs, vines covering the walls and lots of exposed brick. Shows lots of character. The staff is also on point!  They are nice, attentive and EVERYWHERE.  All I have to say is the staffing department did an amazing job!  (There's your shout out, Java!) In all seriousness, one of my former coworker left our company to work at this place and I'm glad she did.  I'm absolutely amazed!  On my first visit, our server was Michael, who goes by Micah.  He was AH-MAZE-ING.  So accommodating, so nice and personable, so awesome. I firmly believe the overall experience comes from the tone a server sets and The BB is filled with positive servers and bartenders.  

I'm not going to lie, the drinks aren't cheap.  I payed about $12 for my Ketel One vodka and soda water.  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  You're on the strip.  If you're going to come here, make sure you can afford it.  If not, I think Southpoint has bowling and dollar drinks LOL.  I don't mind it at all, because I don't do this very often.  On both visits, I also had the awesome opportunity to try their food for free.  Here's what I had and here's what I thought:

BBQ pork sliders with cole slaw:  The pork was tender and flavorful.  The cole slaw added a crunchy texture and sweet taste.  The bun was good, maybe too thick, but didn't hurt the experience.

The San Gennaro Pizza:  VERY GOOD pizza.  It's filled with sausage, mozzarella and pepper.  This pizza is packed with sausage!  Lots of toppings offered NO complaints LOL. 

Chicken wings:  THE BEST THING THEY HAVE, BY FAR!  The batter was crispy and crunchy and light.  It was so flavorful with spices and not overpowering. It was served with honey which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It really just takes the wings to the next level.  So delicious.

Rolling Stone really hit home when they said Brooklyn Bowl is ""one of the most incredible places on earth.""  I really believe that on a Las Vegas strip perspective.  Who would have thought a venue that offers bowling and live music in one place would be such a hit!  This is exactly what Vegas needed.  Opening up with one of the coolest bands, The Roots, was a great move on their part.  Listen, if you're in the area, turn north on Koval and make a turn into Winnick street.  You need to park your car and walk to Brooklyn Bowl.  This place will blow you away.  Trust me, it's simply AH-MAZE-ING!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,20,14,5,NLkB8Xz2ZeJMVUc37QuA2g

5080488,2017-02-19,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"The Brooklyn Bowl is part of the new Linq Promenade which is located on the strip between the Flamingo and the Linq casinos. It's actually a really cool area with tons of bars and places to shop and eat. 

The Bowl is a combination restaurant/bowling alley/music venue. It's two levels with the restaurant area, some bowling lanes and the stage on the first level, then the second level (the balcony) is like a whole second venue with it's own bowling lanes, bar, bathrooms, huge leather couches everywhere, and you can look down onto the stage below. 

We went to see a concert so we opted for the seating in the balcony level. The great thing was that even though the venue was packed downstairs, upstairs there was plenty of space. No lines for the bathrooms or bar, and they have servers to take food orders. So it was a really nice experience. My only complaint about being on the balcony is that the view of the stage is very limited. Unless you are standing right against the balcony rail, you cannot see the stage, and there's only so much rail space. A huge architectural oversight in my opinion. Luckily there wasn't many people upstairs and we got a space against the rail, but I would feel sorry for people attending a more packed show. 

After the show we went downstairs and had dinner and it was really good and not terribly expensive. The wait staff was outstanding as well. My wife knocked her wine glass over by accident and the staff was on it immediately, cleaning up and assuring us that it was no problem. And they refilled her glass for free. Great service.

I've been here twice now, once for Primus last year, and once for Tribal Seeds this last weekend. Primus concert was packed which makes it a little difficult to get bar service but it was still decent, the problem is the cost for the booze. Our first round for 4 shots of fireball the bartender only charged us $14. The second round we had a different bartender and it was $14/each. We basically bought the place 4 bottles for those 4 shots so buyer beware. PBR's are the way to go for only $6.
I went last weekend for the Tribal Seeds show and with no warning, email, or anything the show had been cancelled due to a sudden illness. The other two bands were still there and they played a free show - so we will get a refund - but it was still a disappointment. I look forward to coming to town for another show sometime in the future. 
Tips: There is a nice spot on the upper floor to sit down on couches and relax, and a great deck out the back (on both levels I think) for you to smoke if that's your thing!",LV5KPQQ8qACP0_zo8thirA,0,0,4,bDWtlUsI1B27078vlnTF4g

I'd the staff out numbered the patrons in the dining room, but that's their problem not mine.

The real bummer came with the service.  You'd figure with such a lack of diners, it wouldn't take as long as it did to get our entrees and the check, but it did.  Infrequent visits from our waiter to refill drinks didn't help matters either.

I like coming to this venue. They've got a great lineup, purchasing tickets is easy and affordable either on the internet or at the door. It's not huge inside, but there are 2 bars-- 2 within the limits of the concert area, one closer to the bowling side and another in the eating area. I'm pretty sure they have happy hour specials, although I'm not too sure of what they are. 

As for the restaurant, we ordered the gluten free fried chicken platter and a side of fries to share between the two of us after an insanely awesome Andrew W.K. concert. Service was fast and friendly, despite it being after midnight. The chicken was juicy and moist yet fried to crunchy deliciousness. The fries were good, too-- not soggy and weird. It was easy to see that everything was freshly fried.

The venue as far as a show goes is pretty awesome! Small and intimate without feeling claustrophobic, Brooklyn Bowl is a great choice. There are 3 bars in the concert area and plenty off security and staff.

5162014,2015-03-15,3,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"One of my favorite bands I haven't seen in years was playing at this venue. I never been here for a concert, but I've been here to bowl once. This place should only be for BOWLING. 

They have no understanding how to handle a concert and they ruined my whole night. Lets begin. 

We parked at Harrahs on the 5th level. The walk is about 10 to 15 minutes from the parking to the venue.  When we get there, the line outside wasn't that bad. We were there a hour early. Two security guys were checking I.D.s. I showed I.D. and walked up to more security at the door. Time for the pat down. I got the green light from her. I had no purse on me, just my small digital camera, I.D, and some cash. All of which was in my coat pocket. 

I needed will-call to pick up my tickets. They pointed me to the cashier inside, which was only a few steps away. I got my tickets and, wow another pat down... But you guys just saw me walk from the door to this cashier? Ok? 

So she puts my wrist band on, and then starts patting me down and feels my camera in my coat pocket. I tell her what it is and she tells me ""You can't bring that in"" So I ask if I can leave it somewhere and pick it up after the show. She says ""No, were not responsible for it"" She removes my wristband. 

My friend is already done. He has his wrist band on and his ticket scanned. I was in shock. I can't believe that I have to walk all the way back to harrahs to drop off my camera. 
So he gets ready to walk with me and one of the male security guys yells out ""You have to stay sir. You have a wrist band, you can't leave."" She removed mine... but they can't remove my friends, so he can go with me!?

I just remember him dropping the car keys in my hand and the utter anger that rushed through my veins from these fake rent-a-cops. I also had no cell phone on me at the time, because I left it at my house. So now I have to walk back, alone and without a cell phone..

I started crying on 15 minute walk there and 15 minute walk back. It was all anger. My camera is 10 years old, and these camera phones that they make now, is 10X better than my digital will ever be, and you are treating me like I have a professional HD Movie camera!? 

I finally return and now the outside line is MUCH longer. I walk up to the security, which, now they are down to one, and I want to let him know, I've been here already. He is not even looking my way nor listening. He is to busy telling a girl she can't bring in her backpack. Hey, girl, you should be lucky they told you that before you got inside. So I see, it wasn't the only one that night that was taking a long walk back to the car.

Guess where I went? Back to the end of the line and waited to get searched again..  After 10 minutes, I finally got to get back inside and meet up with my friend. He said, he was having problems with security in there as he leaning up against the wall waiting for me. They wanted to search him again too. 

So the whole concert, I had tall people with cell phones in my view. I watched them take videos and pictures, since that was my view most of the time. I had to watch the concert through other peoples cell phones. I got no pictures. Cell phone was left at home and my compact camera wasn't allowed in.

Was our last day of our honeymoon and we headed down a couple of hours before we had to leave for the airport - in search of a lovely last experience of 3 weeks spent touring California and nevada. 

All started well. Great choice of craft beers, the chicken wings rocked as a starter but then came the main. 

I realised too late that I hadn't been asked how I wanted my burger cooked and unfortunately then got the dish I expected. 

Over cooked, well done, dry, lacking depth of flavour. I LOVE my burgers and had hunted out the best on our trip. This was sadly the worst we had. Also it seemed strange that the burger listed along the lines of the ultimate bowl burger came without cheese or bacon for which you had to pay extra on the $16 or so price tag. If it's the deluxe venue burger pimp it up guys!

To top matters off my wife's chicken burger was made from chicken mince and not breast. She had one bite, said it was cold and didn't touch anymore. With such a cool venue, rock ethos, friendly staff and great beer menu we expected food to match - maybe a bad day in the kitchen but it sadly reminded us of cheap chain pub food in the uk - not fresh, lacking care and definitely a sad end to our beer and food tour that had so many highlights.",iU6POSAKN3XRDhr3mDo3fg,3,1,2,-c3roHa_hQ7d942FnyUI-A

2.  There was so much CO2 from the fog machine that several of us in the same section on the floor got queasy! Yuck.",-D9dcHFhzLuQfs6P3S39Rw,0,0,2,F0pa1enPUF5AcCPR8W7woQ

5260154,2014-06-18,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"I'll give BB 4 stars. My wife and I just saw Thievery Corporation there and it was a really great show. Obviously, most of the credit for that would have to go to the band but even so, I think the venue held up it's part of the deal quite well. 
The sound was pretty good, but some of the vocals were mixed a little too low to really hear. That being said, I was both surprised and relieved that I never once heard any noise from the adjacent bowling lanes. The main floor is flat, but sunken, and there's plenty of space in the back and on the sides, which I imagine offer pretty decent, unobstructed views (not certain though. we were in the front). For the most part, I really dig the set-up and I continue to be impressed with the number of quality shows they're booking. There are already a few show that I plan on seeing there, so I imagine I'll be coming back fairly frequently.

The food: 
We had some time before the show and were both starving, so we decided to try their famous fried chicken. It was really good. Crispy, juicy and cooked to order, it wasn't (by any means) the best fried chicken I've ever eaten, but I'd definitely order it again. They offer honey and a habanero buffalo sauce, and I recommend trying a bit of both. They really set the chicken off. Beyond that, the mashed potatoes were good, but nothing special, and the collard greens were pretty good, but a little dry (or maybe ""not wet enough"" is more accurate). With our dinner, we each tried one of their drafts (Brooklyn Brown?), and it was quite tasty.
The whole meal, while good, was a bit too expensive for what it was, though. So, in all honesty, I don't see us coming back for food all that often. 

That's it, I suppose. 
It's a really nice place to see a concert, but if you aren't careful, it could end up being a really expensive night.",J6Jz3UXH1oab79JShMaLGw,0,0,4,Ygxv37yQ-sw-ZRXMpCn64g

The only thing I haven't done is eat at the restaurant! Brooklyn Bowl is probably my favorite thing at the Linq. The first time I walked into BB, I was completely enthralled with the place. 

BOWLING
I bowled at BB around the first time it opened. Me and some friends seen a sign out front advertising free bowling for locals, so of course we walked in to check the place out. All we had to do was pay for shoes! Bowling here is really flashy but the seating arrangements are kind of weird. There's only one sofa and a shared table for your party, so unless you're group takes over two adjacent lanes things can get a little weird. Also, employees were on us like bees on honey asking if we needed any drinks. It was like, I'm fine, I swear! 

CONCERTS
Me and my guy seen a show headlined by Black Label Society with the Butcher Babies at Brooklyn Bowl. The stage floor is kind of narrow, so I ended up pretty far back from the stage. BB isn't the best venue as far as visibility goes, but I'm glad to have another concert venue option in Vegas.   

BALCONY BREWSKIES
For a great people watching spot and a view of the Linq promenade, grab a beer and sit outside on the patio of BB. PBR drafts are $6 and a pitcher is $20. Try to make it for Happy Hour if you can.   

Worth a Return Visit?
But of course, 'ma dear. I still need to try out the actual food lol.

Knowing full well that testing a restaurant during its early days is always a risky proposition the visit from three friends, all music fans and two vegetarians, made Brooklyn Bowl an irresistible destination for Saturday Night; a night not without mistakes - but not a single one of them involving the food.  Over 80,000 square feet and opening nearly 20 minutes late as staff scrambled and soundcheck overran it must be said that the new Linq locale is beautiful, the dining area, stage, and lanes all up a gleaming escalator and with clever bowling-hip décor used to divide but not occlude each area from the next both the energy and the volume were high, even with the lanes not opened for ""unexpected"" reasons.  Settling into our seats, five of us in total, and provided the Blue Ribbon crafted menu service was decidedly rough around the edges - dishes misdescribed, crib notes clearly used, tickets incorrect, and delays plus dropped plates common - but with grace and humor plus a good environment most was forgivable...at least for now.  Moving on to food and beverage, a total of four beers and two milkshakes complimented six plates plus two desserts and with the Bourbon Street Shake and Cookie Dough disguised as French Toast ""bread pudding"" shining brightly amongst the sweets it was the savories that all wowed; 'bar' or 'bowling-alley' food only in spirit.  Beginning first with toasty pizzas featuring immaculate produce over thick toasted bread and moving on to smoked chicken wings so moist as to fall off the bone without a hint of grease it was what followed that most diners will come for, and with good reason.  Considered by some to be the ""best"" fried chicken they've ever tasted an 8 piece mixed plate was ordered and delivered alongside breadcrumb crusted macaroni that could certainly generate similar praise the matzo-crusted, brined bird truly was remarkable - just enough spice and salinity in the golden coat plus a chicharone-esque crunch to each bite bringing the quality of the moist bird to the fore. Already running an impressive kitchen in a venue primed to make a big impact in the local music scene it should only be assumed that service and timing will improve and while the 'best' debates will surely continue I know for a fact this was not my last visit to Brooklyn Bowl - gutter-balls and Black Label Society followed by a Banana Split and Molten Chocolate Brownie anyone?",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,3,4,WAwSwzo12y6aFEVbD7sJtA

Here's why: for starters the staff was nice (which is rare in venues like this as most bouncers are trained to be dicks). Meanwhile we got there hours early thinking it would be packed, and though it was a good sized crowd the layout of the venue doesn't leave you feeling like a sardine stuffed in a tin can. Between the bowling, multiple bars, restaurant area, and giant patio overlooking The Linq we stayed entertained until showtime. The crowd couldn't have been more diverse and chill (though I realize this has more to do with the band than venue, but still, it enhanced the overall experience). Though the poor staff was scrambling trying to get people to stop smoking weed inside - but they weren't aggressive about it and I never saw them kick anyone out but rather just made them put it out. Perhaps they caught a contact high? (kidding). I'm super short and always have trouble seeing over people's heads at concerts, but either marijuana stunted everyone's growth there or the stage is tall enough to allow the little people in the back to see. As for the food the portions are MASSIVE! The waitress warned me about this so my dude and I shared a meal vs having leftovers we had to drag around all night. The prices reflected the large portions, but then again any place on the strip that has to pay concession fees is going to have to jack up their prices to make a profit. And as for The Wailers, they rocked! Tickets were only $30 each too which I thought was cheap to see legends.

The party of 8 across our table were pretty bunched up.  It also would've been kind of a mess had they ordered drinks and food too since all 12 of us were sharing one (albeit long) table.  

Definitely dine before bowling because eating with your hands, playing with balls and then eating more is gross.  Someone is bound for pink eye or worse.  Although ""The Fatty"" pizza was Stouffer's French bread pizza on steroids delicious, I had to eat it with a fork while standing.  That's kinda lame.  

It's all minor stuff in the whole picture of things.  Can't wait to check out some shows!  Lots of great acts on the schedule already.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,24,17,4,pIbeFhBXnA21OOM503endA

There are a ton of bars surrounding the standing area so you have quick and easy access to them no matter where you are.

5674394,2014-07-02,2,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"I'm definitely a big fan!  Brooklyn Bowl has officially become my favorite venue in Las Vegas for concerts/live music.

This is what The Joint used to be - before they got too big and impersonal.

It's a great layout.  You head up an escalator and are not overwhelmed by a big crowd, since the stage is in the back.  The first thing you see are beer pong tables, a bar and seating.  I love that there is seating - and plenty of it (not a ton, but way more than most venues).

I was here for the private event celebrating the announcement of the Life is Beautiful lineup.  I didn't get to see the opening act because I had to work until the show started, but I showed up just in time for the ""surprise guest-"" Girl Talk!  There was some confusion while trying to get in.  Since it was a private party, they had a table with laptops and the representatives checked to see if you were on the list.  My friend was invited because she purchased her tickets immediately after last year's festival and she arrived before me.  It didn't take a long time to get in, but it was bit unorganized.  Once I had my wristband, I was on my way and excited!

There was an hour wait at the restaurant (there is an actual restaurant inside - how cool is that?!), so we decided to just sit at the bar style seating against the window by the front bar and order from our waitress.

We shared the hummus ($9).  Pretty good - but I think it's pretty difficult to screw up hummus!  We also had ""The Beach,"" ($15) one of their French bread pizzas.  It had pulled pork and pickled peppers.  It was larger than I expected, and the pickled peppers were actually pretty spicy.  Overall good and we would order it again.

They have a decent drink menu and beer selection.  Although I found it funny that they had Green Flash Western IPA - it's actually called West Coast IPA. :) Of course they have quite a few beers from Broolyn Brewery.  The thing that could REALLY make this place amazing is if they could strike some sort of special deal with Yuengling to carry their beers there.  What's more East Coast than Yuengling?! Anyhow, that will never happen, but a girl can dream!

After eating we wandered towards the back. We passed a small area with couches and lounge chairs, which was really cool.  We also passed a patio with misters.  The venue is NON SMOKING, which is amazing.  It looked as if there was a 2nd patio upstairs for the VIP area as well.  Well done, BB.

Once we saw the stage, I could see the bowling lanes to the left as well.  I hope to go back and bowl during a show sometime soon - what an amazing experience that would be.  The bowlers all looked like they were having a blast.  It's too bad that the price to bowl is comparable to highway robbery. (Please take note BB, lower the prices!)

I love, love this place.  The sound was amazing, the floor and stage were small and it's by far the best place for an intimate show.  They've also done a great job of bringing in a variety of talent.  I am for sure going to Wu Tang in September - can't wait!

This is a very welcome and wonderful addition to Las Vegas.  Although it was crowded, I never felt like I was jockeying for space like at other places.  Do yourself a favor and go see a show at Brooklyn Bowl!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,5,4,4,hPPcIjRM0-Nke0wgSE9kzg

Had dinner and drinks in the bar. Our server was Patrick and he was great. Attentive, relaxed, funny. We ordered the fried pickles, poutine fries, Mac n cheese and fried chicken. It was all delicious. The mac n cheese is baked, creamy yet not super rich. The chicken was hot and crispy. 

We saw the Silversun Pickups after dinner. It's a great intimate venue. Stage is right next to the bowling alley and it's not huge so you get an up close and personal experience. The screens above the lanes either have trippy mesmerizing visuals or you can watch the show live. There's a balcony above the main floor, floor standing or near the lanes. Wherever you're watching from, you'll have a great view. Plenty of bars, and no lines.

It's been about 2 years since I was last at Brooklyn Bowl. The last few times I tried going, they had a private party and canceled my reservations.  I had given up going here but I gave this place one more try on this visit.  Hurrah! I got in!

The place is actually a music venue and an upscale bowling place. They do have a bar and a restaurant, but they focus more on their music scene.  For this visit, they closed their restaurant side of the place, and had diners go to the bar to eat.  The bar area is small, and I had to wait for a lower table. It wasn't really the fault of the staff, as they claim diners took over 2 hours to eat, hogging up the tables.

The menu is simple, and has everything from burgers to sandwiches, but their signature item is their matzo fried chicken. The chicken, however, isn't cheap, but so darn good!  Stephen and I shared a 1/2 chicken dinner (mixed portion with mashed potatoes and collard greens) and an order of their Rock. And Roll. Fries which is similar to poutine, where the fries are mixed with cheese and topped with hot gravy.  Ask for extra gravy!!

The food didn't look like a lot, but we barely finished the 2 dishes.  We left so full! 

I forgot how delicious the fried chicken was, and it was worth the 2 year wait.  I will definitely come back again.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,4,3,4,tDw77u6Q17d8byL5jonkVA

I know that everybody's different but there were two girls that put them away just as well as the two guys, and the two girls both weighed under 130 pounds.

But, as I'm learning the longer I'm here, Vegas' culture is actually just an appropriation of all other cultures. 

That being said, it's actually really dope inside - that whole area is incredible - and this Brooklyn Bowl is significantly bigger! It's also not in a giant industrial wasteland, which I appreciate. Got to see The Roots perform for free was a highlight, duh. 

Blue Ribbon: y'all already know. Fried chicken always gets two thumbs up, and a wink! ;)

Lots of attractive locals seem to frequent here, which makes me happy. It's been a LONG TIME coming that Vegas needed a place like this. Somewhere on the Strip that has an open and walkable atmosphere that is down to earth and not something overly kitschy, glitzy, or touristy. I'm sure once The Linq actually opens, it'll be a shit show. Until then, I'm into it.

All is good if you arrive early which we did and hung around for the 3 hour pre-show before The Glitch Mob would start. The Brooklyn Bowl site was not clear as to the show details and start times. So after 2 hours of waiting for glitch mob to start we left to get a quick bite to eat since the security guard told us the real show would not be on stage until at least 10PM. Anyhow we ran and got a quick bite, came back and the stage area is full of people with no wristbands.

I went to Brooklyn Bowl for dinner and to watch college basketball. Brooklyn Bowl was busy after opening in the evening. Brooklyn Bowl has a dining section,bowling alley, and music venue inside. I sat at a window seat in the dining area (good view outside by The Linq). I ordered 8 pc chicken wings and fries. The chicken wings and fries were average (IMO). I expected more from Brooklyn Bowl chicken after reading reviews. I'm born in the South,I have high expectations for fried chicken. Our waitress was decent. Brooklyn Bowl has a cool ambience and a lot of televisions (very lively). I only ate here, next time I would come back to bowl or check out the music venue. Brooklyn Bowl is a cool place to check out in Las Vegas.",-NbeVN5tnwdyYAvdNkKMjw,6,4,3,07X6y_VKvajw0b6LhZsfJg
5892916,2014-04-15,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Props for the overall venue, but I grew up bowling old school style. This is a concert venue/bowling alley hybrid & I'm not sure what to make of it!
Disclaimer-
I won free bowling, concerts & comped food & drink from vegas seven. I was treated well and given a great bowling lane. We enjoyed the BLT (really good), french fries, and a few drinks. Prices are high for drinks, beer is $7-8, speciality drinks are $12. This may be on par with drink prices at other venues at the Linq, I'm just used to locals prices off the Strip
During concerts, the screens on the lanes project the show. Looking forward to returning for another night of bowling!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,1,4,_uWovpm4xU81_wR0bm9kVg

A lot of angry customers and people upset, hopefully the tournament never uses this venue again!

5900740,2014-04-18,1,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"I cannot say enough flattering things about this place.  The food, the atmosphere, the staff, the music, the energy, the talent they have booked... on and on and on.  I will keep this simple: you MUST go here.  Whether you love music, fried chicken, bowling or just want something new to do - this is your spot.  

For a new venue the staff is on point.  They were knowledgeable, friendly and full of suggestions on what to try.  The fried chicken was good but I was a little let down with the mac'n cheese (good but safe in flavor).  I will say, however, there were some variations on the mac that i didn't try, maybe that's what I am missing.  The cocktails are strong and relatively reasonable for the strip.  

One of the best parts of the venue is that you can hear the talent from everywhere: dinning room, bar, bowling alley and, of course, the upstairs VIP area.  The sound system is killer; clear, clean and as loud as it gets.  The upstairs VIP area has a lounge section with these cool cow skin rugs and couches.  There is also an outdoor smoking section so up there so if you're not a smoker you can enjoy the show without hacking up a lung.  I haven't tried the bowling lanes yet but you know I'll give you an update as soon as I do.

The only reason I am giving this spot four stars - their mac'n cheese needs a little flare and wine list wasn't too tasty.  I am sure these will both continue to develop over time.   Other than that, this spot is off to one hell of a memory making start!  Do yourself the pleasurous (yes I know that's a made-up word) favor and take your happy ass over to Brooklyn Bowl.  If you're not happy you went I probably won't believe you.",I4z0kawvdZHrYR1Iq3Whew,1,1,4,C3-3R5diNxxFD0YKx6XAKA

The security staff is far less than friendly and it's very confusing to know where your ""allowed"" to go. Many different colored wristbands with no rhyme or reason as to where you can go, and this being a brand new establishment you would think the security would be a bit more friendly when they explain the MANY rules of the place. They definitely need a lesson in customer service.",Hf6_JIBViaqfSUcNPgwzmQ,3,0,2,3VnHURdc6YABLL34QboQ6w

5922191,2014-09-09,3,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Ya know I'm quite surprised I haven't written a review for Brooklyn Bowl, but better late than never. 
For those not in the know Brooklyn Bowl is a combo bowling alley/restaurant/bar/ music venue
Pros: it's big, and expansive so when you come here there's usually room to dance and there's an outside patio and multiple places where you can sit
-there's bowling upstairs which I actually didn't know until a few trips
-the bartenders in my experience are liberal with the drinks which are always appreciated and always results in extra tips
-the fried chicken was pretty damn good, I've heard good things about the rest of the menu but haven't had too much of a chance
-the musical lineup absolutely cannot be matched in Las Vegas. From acts such as flume, chromeo, Elvis Costello, bass nectar, the roots, Wu Tang. They book all different genres of acts and all levels of celebrity, so it can range from icons to just a local band who's trying to get some stage time and exposure. It's quickly becoming where I tend to see a lot of live music in town
CONS
-cell service is absolutely atrocious. Like none of me and my friends ever get service whenever we go here, it's accepted that no texts or snapchats will be sent unless you go out onto the patio. There's supposed to be WiFi but it's about as reliable as Lindsey Lohan at 3am on a Saturday night
-bowling can randomly fill up quick and bowling during a concert isn't easy to do :(
-they randomly close the upstairs for some concerts and allow people upstairs sometimes. I've never been able to get why it's open some times and closed the others",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,5,3,4,HUKnBHuFW8AWzwXYNIEyQw

5950615,2014-03-30,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"Wow, awesome venue! Visited for the first time last night to see Lettuce and was very impressed.  I am a Las Vegas local, so I've had the opportunity to see a lot of great venues, but this is my  new favorite. I didn't bowl, but thought it was cool that all the lanes had screens which showed the band, so you don't miss any of the action. They have two bars right next to the dance floor, so I was able to get drinks quick and easy. I'm not one to spend $15 for a mixed drink, so was happy to see they had about 10 draft beers which ran $7. As an added bonus, they have a nice sized balcony which overlooks the Linq, so you can get away from the music if you wanna chat. This is the perfect place to go if you like to hear great music and dance, but HATE the clubeque experience of overly priced drinks, deafening noise, and douche bags. Definitely worth a visit!",IxMVf76Ke4jJCsZSmo3UUQ,0,0,5,PCEfsYC6Juetivvm7sIx7w
5956454,2015-04-10,0,BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ,"This is a really interesting venue.  You can bowl, eat some pretty good food, drink cocktails and hear a live band all at the same time.  Tonight's headliner was Milky Chance. The floor space is always GA with no seating.  It's standing only. 

There are carnival posters on the exposed brick walls and the lighting is dim and funky.  It's a big place. There was a Tarot card reader there tonight but she announced she was leaving at 8:30pm sharp.  Guess it wasn't in the cards?


The food offerings consisted of 3 different types of chicken wings, 3 different types of sliders, French bread pizzas, Voss water, salads, couscous etc.
I'd give the food three stars. An extra star for the intriguing space.

You can also purchase tickets nearby for the High Roller Ferris wheel.   Adults tickets are $24!  The ride takes 45 minutes and each car seats 12 people.",XrzkP-EPpql8cis-GlQ57A,0,2,4,hjbg7O3oyjneuDLDHP1XIA

They could use a few more tables around the bowling check in center but other than that, this is a really sweet new spot in Vegas.

Overweight security guard was also rude as my girlfriend and I walked in with a drink in our hands, he proceeded to rudely order us to finish drink b fore coming in.
