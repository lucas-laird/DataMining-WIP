They changed their sauce about a year ago, Ive been told and that is where the problem lies.  The chicken parm used to be the Bomb, no more. The sauce is now like jarred sauce, bitter and acidy. Today I decided to stay away  from the sauce and ordered the Chicken Philly, it's like they used the leftover gristtle, all hard and dry and full of grease. Went right through me if you know what I mean. Damn, now I'm going to have to find a new place! I think the owner Rick is cutting corners!",KMbPhOkpK5xJjOtnxQBEdA,0,0,3,RUypIFlxNaoKNRZDuDqWkA

Now the pizza.  It's really good! The crust is not too thin and not real thick. I'm not going to get into whether Chicago style or New York style is better because I think this qualifies as New York style.  In Las Vegas, we get people from both great cities and get to choose which style we want on any given day. 

I usually order the pepperoni pizza, an order of chicken wings plain, with hot wing sauce on the side. 

My kids are very picky, we usually can't agree on which major pizza chain we order from on late nights.  When we have time, we all agree on Verrazanos!   And the number one test for great pizza....leftovers.  It tastes good when it's cold.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,3,0,5,jznGe24Pymx4CA8_A-wK3Q

Food: Being from NY, I must say that this pizza is pretty darn close folks. We're never gonna find our favs out here, but in terms of style, amount of ingredients, etc, this is on the money. 

Staff: Good ol' boys from NY, always very accomodating and nice. We sometimes have few people with us and they help with moving tables together, etc. 

Ambiance - reminds me of the 'on every block' pizza places in nyc. Has some seating, has a tv on. Has a walk up counter where you order and they will bring it to you if you are staying in. 

Price: Normally don't talk much about price, however they are super cheap compared to the other pizza places. Slices and pies

We ordered a large pepperoni - they had a special so we paid the same amount as for a medium pie (awesome!), and an order of hot wings.  The decor is not fancy - just a long aisle with booths.  It reminded me of a lot of places back East, no frills, but practical.  

The wings were normal, this is not the dish that will bring me back.  The clear and definite winner was the pizza!!!  It had an amazing crust, foldable but crisp on the bottom, so good that I even ate the ends (I usually leave them behind).  The sauce was tasty and the cheese was high quality, long gooey strings every time we picked up a new piece from the serving plate.  The amount of pepperoni was good.  It was just really good, soul satisfying pizza!

I get that it's a Saturday night, but when a customer calls well before closing and is willing to drive across town for your food why would you not want that business. In my opinion this was the act of the employees who decided to stop working at least 30 minutes early.

Now there were 4 of us so we got a large half cheese and half pepperoni pizza. The man behind the counter doing pro pizza tosses (very impressive!) advised us to go with a classic cheese pizza with no toppings because toppings spoil the pizza. He took our order and gave us our drinks and we sat down at one of the booths they offer and watched a football game and caught up. As soon as the pizza came out I was loving the fact that it was thin crust. true new york style. large slices that you need to fold to stuff in your face. I will say that we should have gone with the employees recommendation of just cheese. The grease from the pepperoni did ruin the pizza a little and took over the flavor. the crust was amazing that nobody left it on their plate.

Depending on the time of day you stop in, unless it happens to be a Monday (they are closed only on Monday), you might have to wait for a seat unless you are getting your order to-go. I was telling my friend about this place and suggested it for lunch just over a month ago. When we walked in I noticed every table was taken. Luckily it didn't take long for a table to open up. I do wish they wiped up the tables more often during the busier times instead of us customers just taking over a table that is whatever way the previous person left it. When I stopped by for lunch last week, I was the only person there, so you just never know when they will be busy as this is a popular spot.

I usually just have the cheese slice special unless I'm picking up a whole pizza to take home. The special is $5.29 and you get 2 slices of cheese and a drink. Each additional item is 50 cents. The sauce has a nice sweet flavor and the crust is thin yet has a slight crispness on the bottom and holds up cheese and toppings well. If you like to ""fold and eat"" then this pizza is perfect for that. I like how they aren't stingy with the cheese. Solid lunch spot indeed. 

They also offer hot and cold sandwiches, chicken wings and fingers, pasta, calzones, salad and fried foods like mushrooms and ravioli. I have had some of their sandwiches and just found them to be okay. Here it's all about the pizza for me.

Next I went after the Pepperoni Slice.  I prefer to have my Pepperoni well done burnt a little on the edges, but I didn't hold that against them.  The Pepperoni has a nice zing to it and the Pizza slice had an appropriate amount of Pepperoni....I don't like it when too much Pepperoni is put on a Pizza, it can ruin the flavor.

Overall, I thought the Pizza here was very good.  I'm not sure how it will hold up on delivery though as most NY Style Thin Crust Pizza that I've ordered delivered shows up soggy.  The people who work here are very friendly too, which is another plus in my book.

Will I return?  Of course!",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,2,2,4,ecMI4giMW3ir_E1G79AXfA

Don't get me wrong, this pizza place is good NY-style pizza. BUT my boyfriend and I both felt is was not the best we've had. My boyfriend is a pizza eating machine, but even a few hours later after leaving Verrazano he told me he didn't think it was that great. I'd have to agree.

I like the shop, it's quaint and gives you a feeling like you're really eating in a hole-in-the-wall in New York City. The staff was friendly enough and our pizza came out pretty quick. There was only two other people in the place when we walked in. 

We ordered a large with mushrooms and ham. Normally I would get pepperoni, but my boyfriend thinks it's too greasy *eye roll* Anyway, I had a LivingSocial deal for $20 and our total came to $18.something so we ended up not having to pay anything over, which I'm glad about.

I felt as though the pizza did not have enough sauce and the cheese was kind of bland. Also, they were super skimpy on our toppings! I was really, really wanting some more mushrooms, but alas our pizza had only a few.

I see that there are many good reviews for the white pizza, so if anything, I'd come back here to try that pizza. But being that it really isn't anywhere near where I live I probably will not get the chance.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,3,LNx_pn4H1FUAZ_mU-qdkTg

There are 8 tables there so what do dine-in guests do?

I had already paid. I had already tipped.  I am not dirty nor do I look like the type to do drugs.

But I was told no.  So, ya know. That felt quite rude, and well I sat quite uncomfortably for quite some time.

As for the dish itself, the spaghetti was seriously over cooked.  Quite mushy.
The eggplant was pretty okay. The sauce wasnt bad after I added some red chili flakes.

But quite annoyingly, they did not provide me with cutlery.  And so after I realized this, I had to go back out to procure some as all of mine are currently boxed and stored away.

Anyway, it's not like it was a god-awful dish, but between the spaghetti, my bladder, and fork situation... eh. 

I likely won't be back.  There are just too many choices.

Lately, I have been on the search for LV's New York style pizza. This place was close, but honestly it wasn't IT. We ordered a pepperoni with extra sauce because the sauce usually makes the pizza. But the pizza hardly had any sauce, the cheese was average mozzarella, but the crust was PERFECT (not too thin and not too thick and had a nice fresh dough taste). Lastly, the pizza wasn't too greasy, it had just enough for that extra flavor and to prevent dryness.

Now, for the garlic knots. The garlic knots were REALLY GOOD. They were cooked in the oven along with the pizza. Bread was soft and was soaking in some fresh garlic and butter. The sauce used for dipping was hand made, as there were chunks of tomato, onion and garlic. The knots had to be the best part.

* Atmosphere and room capacity: 3/5
Restaurant was in an older plaza, it is located in a tight corner so it could be hard to find. Inside, the decor was out-dated deli style set up.

Then a few people told me the Sicilian was good here. I'm an absolute sucker for a good Sicilian pizza. So with slight hesitation I ordered one, and I'm glad I did. It was similar to the Sicilians we use to make at The Big Inning. I liked it a lot! Plus it takes up the entire pizza box, which is the way it should be. I'm convinced this is one of the best Sicilian pies you'll get in this town. Also, the garlic rolls are just like New York garlic rolls! That, plus they deliver and are right around the corner from my house and we got a winner. I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but their mediocre regular pie and terrible hours made it more of a 3, 3 1/2. Since we can't give halves, 3 it is. The wings were decent, slightly above average. I would get them again, but they aren't ""OMG amazing!!!"". So keep all that in mind.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,1,0,3,EyDyX-hEe_QTpVV7_wjHTQ
5139323,2013-09-08,0,mIlQi6nZdFbEAjZuQ6pFfQ,"Good pizza.  Supposed to be more ""authentic"" than most others in town, and it DOES taste a little different...in a good way?  Maybe...depends on who you ask!

Verrazano Pizza is a good choice for lunch! 2 slices and a drink for around $5...I think the toppings were an extra $0.50 or so.  The slices are pre-made, just tossed back in the oven with your toppings like everyone else in town.

Started off with the Pepperoni slice! Very oily and tasty...super simple, cheesy, foldable slices. Since I am not from NY, I don't care much about authenticity, but these are good slices at reasonable prices.

Sausage slice! This was good as well...I think I prefer their pepperoni topping more here...weird, since I have been a house-sausage-topping guy for a little while now.

Don't expect anything else besides good pizza and cheap prices.  It's like a family owned pizzeria style spot, and they do it well :)

5180642,2017-01-05,0,mIlQi6nZdFbEAjZuQ6pFfQ,"Visiting family in November (yes, this is long overdue)... We were all craving either pizza or take-out Chinese.  Finally settling on pizza, we had three nearby places to choose from.  Two places were either flyers left on the apartment door at my sister's place or just 3 blocks down the street.  Read the reviews on those and thought they were sketchy.  Found Verrazano's!  It was a 4-mile drive, but totally worth it.

In all of my travels to New York, Chicago, Portland, OR (where I used to live), and the local places I like in my hometown, Verrazano's is easily in the top 3 of my favorite pizza joints now.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  Sometimes you'll find a gem, and this place definitely qualifies!

Crust was perfectly baked and flavorful on its own.  The sauce wasn't overstated with spices or bland like other places I've tried.  Toppings were just the right proportion, yet still generous.  When I return to Vegas to visit my family, we will definitely get pizza here again.  You can choose to eat in or do take-out, of course.  Prices are very reasonable.  Nice, clean atmosphere if you want to stay.",rTKETxi2xRo0VHaIcxzV7w,1,0,5,pvGd6IwdujQkdGDBVwIjWg

5540576,2015-04-08,1,mIlQi6nZdFbEAjZuQ6pFfQ,"This place boasts about being from New York with a New York owner and New York style pizza but it doesn't live up to the hype.

Yes the inside looks like a pizza place back in jersey, yes the staff are cool since most are from the east coast. However the most important aspect of a New York style pizzeria is the pizza. Their pizza is just okay. The suave is average. Cheese is normal mozzarella and if you leave the pizza to cool down for five minutes it's like little Ceasers. Gross. I live for fresh amazing New York staple pizza but man I was disappointed. 

Is it better then most other pizza places in Las Vegas? Yes it is. But that isn't saying a whole lot when you have grimaldis and sabatibos which are better all the way around. If you are from the tri state area this is just not good enough.",BIcfTJw4-76b9NuZUgpKIA,2,1,2,MN9CvBTYhhtm0PS8FhCt0g

5636423,2018-06-02,0,mIlQi6nZdFbEAjZuQ6pFfQ,"THE NAME OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT HAS CHANGED. THEIR NEW NAME IS RIZOLI'S. The name has changed, but the 'za is the same!

I'm sure that in this sprawling metropolis there are several, if not hundreds, of pizzerias that offer New York style pizza, but until I stumbled on this little hole-in-the-wall, strip mall pizza place I hadn't found any. The pizza here transports me to New York's lower East Side. The crust is perfect, just aching to be folded, but not so droopy and soft that the sauce and toppings slide off before you can get it to your mouth. The sauce is the perfect blend of tomatoes and herbs, spread thinly over the dough, and the edges are just a bit thick and chewy. The cheese is melty and stringy and messy and applied just right, so you can see the sauce peeking through, and the 'za is just a bit greasy (maybe ""oily"" or ""unctuous"" would be better words, less fraught with ethnic innuendo) like God intended it to be. The toppings are the usual, added in just the right proportions.

Of course, there are other items on the menu; pasta, meatball subs, calzones, salads, and (mostly fried) sides. I've only sampled the salad, which is meh, and the garlic knots, which are very good. But eat them all the night you order them! Left to sit overnight, like any garlic knots from any Italian place, they become hard little projectiles one could conceivably use as ammo. There are lots of lunch and dinner specials, and they also serve pizza by the slice, in case you're done shopping at the Sprouts next door and feel a bit peckish. I don't generally drink wine or beer, so I can't tell you if it's offered there. There is a table and a couple of chairs outside the shop in case you'd like to dine ""al fresco."" The interior design is, well, not really given much thought, but it is scrupulously clean. And they deliver, although if you order delivery, you might wanna heat up your oven to 250° when you order, then put the pizza in, box and all, to warm it a little. There isn't a pizzeria on earth that can deliver a piping hot pizza, though, so no fault, no foul!

The staff can tend a bit towards surly, but that only lends a New York feel to the place, and no one there has ever actually been rude. If you're ordering to dine in or take-out, they'll keep you notified of the wait time.

Plenty of parking, as it's in a strip mall. And if you feel guilty about scarfing two or five slices, you can always stop by that Sprouts on the way home and pick up some healthy food, just to make yourself feel noble.

If you're anywhere near the neighborhood. I highly recommend that you stop by and sample their pies. You won't be sorry (except for that guilt), but you WILL be hooked!",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,5,SpNE7e_ZYiz9phPZ6T8cqg
5695822,2011-08-28,0,mIlQi6nZdFbEAjZuQ6pFfQ,"I like this place a lot.  Count me in the ""Adam Carolla"" style of pizza eating.  That is, when it's time to eat pizza, I want to EAT PIZZA!  And that means I don't want some thick crust weighing me down or filling me up after one slice.  

Verrazano solves all that, the pizzas come on a nice thin crust which is just the right amount of doughy.  I am a pepperoni fan myself but they offer most of the other usual toppings as well.  I will mention I tried the sausage one time and wasn't real thrilled with it.  

Sauce tastes fine to me, they do not skimp on the cheese, and they have a variety of specials as others have mentioned.  Also the guys that work there are great, they always greet everyone and are happy to chit chat when possible.  Also I have a toddler that gets a real kick out of watching them cook.

So today I went there for the first time.  After hearing so much about it, I figured I'd give it a shot.  As a native NY'er...the only places I'll eat a pizza at is Papa Enzo's (Venetian), Metro Pizza, and Broadway Pizza.  If I want a sit-down pizza, it's Grimaldi's.  

Well, I walked in and asked for 2 slices to the big guy behind the counter.  He walked to the back...and when he came out...another guy from the back came out and offered me a free personal pie that I guess some lady never picked up.  Totally on the house.  I insisted on paying since I didn't even have any cash to tip the guys.  He simply told me to do something good for somebody else.  I can do that.  

Now on to the pizza itself.  AWESOME.  Just like any slice I'd pick up at a corner pizzeria back in Queens.  Being that the gesture was so kind, I already planned on being a steady customer, but you throw in the fact that they make one helluva pie...the deal is sealed.
