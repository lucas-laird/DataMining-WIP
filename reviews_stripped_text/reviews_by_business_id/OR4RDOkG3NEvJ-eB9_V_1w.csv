We make better and delicious food in home.
I ordered Qabuli and Kofta . 
They brought something cooked last week.
The next day I got sick.

I paid 15$ and trashed the food.
Don't go here never",di8DXLZS0ZXuZEG6yVwU2Q,1,0,1,JUQ787lQJtBee5d4RWmYpA

I'm a vegetarian so I was happy with all of the veggie options I had. The dishes are all original and taste like they are made in my own home country. The staff is very friendly they have great prices and I highly recommend for anyone to try this restaurant.",9yoN5PbCuZ_pQOjWJjq0_g,2,0,5,vrZ7IBgWl7dDsrPES146BQ

The bread was tasty and freshly baked, I will definitely go again and again.",LeADJm55u8R-IQ39rKPOXg,0,0,5,CahrXFY6d69xx-HGDJMqQw

I am unclear whether the ownership has changed, but location interior remains a banquet-like space with some added decor since my last visit.

The kabobs and rice are the best bet here, everything else has been hit or miss. Kabobs available a la carte or as combos with rice, salad, and bread. The lamb is my favorite. The rice is absolute soft, long-grained perfection... but I've been disappointed with the salads, which have entirely too much onion and use underripe tomatoes. 

Pricing is confusing, my total was $10 more than calculated from menu prices. Location is odd, seems to be set up for event rentals and catering but there's never anyone here. Food is fair, but I don't understand why the constant business name changes if they're not going to improve the business to a format that makes sense for the location.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,12,3,OOSFb9cv9eRBnM1qjyGmbQ

3109714,2015-09-28,0,OR4RDOkG3NEvJ-eB9_V_1w,"Very disappointed. $12 Kabuli gave us two very tiny pieces of lamb in the pile of rice and even then the lamb was dried up and tough. $10 chicken tikka gave 6 of the smallest pieces of chicken tikka I have ever seen in my life. They charge average price but you get way less meat then what you pay for or other restaurants provide. Also it gave me a stomach ache all night. I would not recommend you waste your money here. Not a good way for a restaurant to start a new business. You have lost a customer.

***also a note to the person thinking I own a restaurant this is not true. I have given great reviews to great places I visit. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and mine was based on a legitimate experience. Don't take it personal if the food is great I have no problem saying so.",j-VfpIGvosfusxA6U1iBHQ,0,0,1,K8v6qm6uXyJOH3kmY1b4LQ

I ordered the tandoori chicken and my father-in-law ordered a lamb dish (I can't remember exactly what it was called) and so did my brother-in-law. All three of us loved our food. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We also shared an appetizer that was kind of like a quesadilla but had spinach in it (I can't remember what it was called, sorry!).  It came with a nice yogurt sauce for dipping as well as a cool, mint yogurt sauce, both were great. 

My biggest issue with tandoori chicken is that it's always a bit dry or tasted like it wasn't quite marinated long enough but this was the first time I got tender chicken that was seasoned throughout. My family and I enjoyed our food and will definitely be back. I highly recommend giving this beautiful, family owned restaurant a try.",-tEu9XCZJHtgBFu9q6xXzQ,1,0,5,2ZaZSivgBuwH3YEuW3Kd4Q

Someone complained about the Kabuli Palau...do NOT believe them, it's really good and the portion is huge.  Also had the chicken Karahi, very tender and flavorful.  Before you leave, the bakery connected to the restaurant has fantastic fresh bread so don't forget to pick some up.",DfPBsH2ROJAsu5ukYCVc2Q,1,0,5,dQ-1P0D-jvL41mtBSTb9qg
