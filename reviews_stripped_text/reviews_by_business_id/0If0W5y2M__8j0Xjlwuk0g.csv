The decor is contemporary and has all the potential, heck the food is pretty good too-not sure what the problem is.  We ordered a bunch of small plates:  duck profiteroles-the bun was like an actual profiterole or cream puff and it would have been much better on a traditional Chinese steamed bun, hot and sour soup, honey tamarind glazed baby back ribs (yummy),  grilled rib eye & vermicelli noodle salad with spicy cilantro dressing (ok), and yelowtail sashimi with serrano and cilantro (very good).",c8cJtcIcZ-rUt3uR6kPWOQ,0,0,3,5IHZFbqYDXGJ00QlyUMPUQ

The hot and sour soup was just okay, not sour enough for my liking, but the egg roll and potsticker apps were fantastic.

Having more money than sense, I got the Wootini.  I don't recommend that one at all since it tasted like Lemon Pledge.  Maybe I shouldn't have chosen my main entrees after being doused by a martini, but I took a leap and chose the Peking Duck profiterole.  

I have no idea what a profiterole is.  When the food came out (service was commendably quick), it was simply a sliced rolled-up duck with hoisin sauce, green onions, and bleached white bun.

Ask for the daily specials:
We also had lobster with a roasted jalapeno sauce. A bit spicy with an amazing presentation.

I really hadn't heard anything about this place, and we were slightly reluctant to come since we had eaten at PF Chang's the night before, but man, were we glad we gave Woo a chance! 

We arrived early and were immedeately seated- the restaurant was quite empty at 7PM. Our server explained the menu, concept and recommended drinks. Not only did they serve mixed cocktails, but they also had an extensive sake list. 

We ordered:

1. Black Cod Lettuce Wraps
2. Rock Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Cilantro
3. Chicken Chow Mein
4. Stir-fry Scallops in Spicy Schetzuan Sauce
5. Kalbi Rib-Eye with Garlic Soy Sauce
6. Ginger Chicken Ravioli

Sounds like a lot of food, and they recommend sharing dishes, but they are tapas style, pretty small, we were a group of six girls and we probably could have eaten one or two more dishes, so don't be afraid to order a lot!

Absolutely everything we ordered was delicious. No exceptions. Everything came with a wonderfully flavored sauce that complimented the dish perfectly. 

In particular, one of the girls fell in love with the Ginger Chicken Ravioli- to the point that she would not let the servers take the empty dish away as she wanted to lick the sauce off the plate. 

The Kalbi Rib-Eye was also a stand out dish-- came on a bed of rice, with some crunchy burnt rice on the bottom- SO GOOD! The sauce was also absolutely fabulous. 

I could have gone without the Rock Shrimp Tempura-- it was a bit bland for my taste, but the Black Cod Lettuce Wrap, I don't even know where to begin on this one.  I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday without getting sick of it. The warmth of the cod, and the bold flavor, paired with the freshness and crunch of the lettuce-- what more could anyone want? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ORDERING THIS, I repeat, I REALLY recommend ordering this dish in particular. 

The chicken chow mein was also delicious, and the scallops were perfectly cooked. All around fantastic meal, wonderful service, friendly staff.

The Chef was very accommodating and made up some Vegetable Tempura for us. No, it is not on the menu. It was the best I had ever had! Very crisp, fresh veggies, no gross greasiness. Pretty generous portion. The chili aoli dipping sauce was wonderful. The salad with honey mustard vinaigrette was superb- taste was more complex than the very plain lettuce presentation seemed. Steamed veggie platter was just OK. Jasmine rice was great, albeit overpriced. 

Our server was great at offering suggestions and was attentive (almost bordering on too attentive.) 

We didn't need reservations on a Saturday night at 7 pm. In fact, the place was about only half full. Only four stars because without the Buy $50, get $20 off coupon, it would have been too pricey for what we got. 

Coming from a service industry background, I was pleased to see that an 18% gratuity was added pre-discount in order to save the servers from 1) getting tipped on the discounted price, which is not right and 2) from cheapskates!

The hostess/greeter was a bit rude. Our waiter seemed hurried, which was strange because it really wasn't that crowded. He didn't tell us about any specials nor did he tell us that things were sold out until we tried to order them. Oops, my bad! Grrr.

The food was nice, but very small, and certainly not worth our bill of over $100. We purchased the shrimp lettuce wraps, lemon chicken, and a spicy basil lobster dish. We also had one beer and one bottle of sparkling water (the water clocked in at $9).  Our waiter kept trying to push more food on us - ""Are you sure you've had enough to eat? I know the dishes are small!"" For the price of the food, I expected slightly better service. 

No, we didn't have enough to eat - my poor boyfriend ate the carrot garnish on our lettuce wraps (two wraps on a $10 plate - with about 1/4 cup of shrimp on one piece of iceburg lettuce). 

I was rather pleased with the lobster - the price seemed relatively fair at $39 for a lobster tail. The lemon chicken, however, was so so. The cheapest thing we had was the $4 bowl of brown rice. Funny, because we assumed it would be included in the price of our entrees. 

The prices seem ""casual"" on the menu, but we would have needed to have ordered twice as much to have been satisfied and paying $200 for a meal with such mediocre service isn't my cup of tea.

Anyhow, upon arrival, I was struck by the stark decor and I don't minimal either. The place looked like it had run out money when it came time to do the interiors which consisted of painted Sheetrock and some curtains. Not what you'd expect from a $25+ per entree Vegas establishment. 

When we finally did get our food it was a lot like the atmosphere; bland with something missing. My wife's $30 seared tuna looked and tasted like it was out of a vacuum pack. It didn't even have pepper on it. Completely plain and void of flavor. My tempura salmon was much the same way.

I went here with a large group from work, and we had a sort of family style tasting. A few of the dishes were done very well. Fantastic lemon chicken, and I'm not normally a lemon chicken fan.

Please note, I didn't comment on any dishes that were fine, but not standouts to the positive or negative. We tried a lot of food. 

The yellowtail sashimi w/ cerrano follows the time tested formula, but the cerrano chile is cut too thick for the delicate yellowtail, and makes it difficult to appreciate the fish. The Peking Duck profiterole is misnamed. There was no crispy skin, and didn't get the true flavors of Peking Duck. The dish was dry, and lacking in flavor. The tempura calamari with salt and pepper was very tasty, and had a very good balance. The pan seared rare tuna with wasabi soy was disturbing. It tasted butter poached, and the butter was so overpowering, the fish taste disappeared. The wasabi soy dipping sauce some how was very flat in flavor, and even something that should be potent like wasabi soy was completely missing punch. The cod with lemon garlic was also a very odd flavor profile, though the fish was well cooked. I'm not sure if I had issues with the naming constructs as the dishes didn't match the flavors that should be connected to the names, or that it tasted like the restaurant was catering so much to the western palate that it actually lost the Asian flavors.

I was seriously not expecting much at all.  For starters, our waiter was more than a touch strange, weird vibe coming off that one for sure.

We chose the Tuna Tartare which was fantastic, the escargot which was extraordinary.  We love Thai escargot and this surpassed our best Thai escargot experience.  The highlight of the night, for sure.  We also did the black cod miso which was very good, but a touch disappointing considering it was a $20 dish.  The other highlight of the night was the salt and pepper calamari.  Wow.  It was unlike any other salt and pepper anything I have consumed.

""Mainland"" is practically fast food.  ""Zine"" is more like a the quick dish joint with a really large menu whereas ""Woo"" (which has it's originations from the famed Mayflower restaurant locally in Las Vegas) has a small menu with very carefully selected & prepared tasty dishes that will always please the palate. 

THE WINNER:  ""WOO""
Hands down:  ""Woo"" has become a favorite restaurant of my wife and I in Las Vegas.  The shrimp dumplings and the Kalbi Ribs on rice were two of my favorite dishes while in Las Vegas.  It sort of reminded me of Kevin Wu's old Dim Sum restaurant at the Venetian called ""Royal Star"" which has since closed much to our dismay and disappointment.  And if you speak Chinese and you ask nicely, you might be able to order ""off the menu"" and ask for... well, basically anything.  The chefs are skilled in creating virtually anything you want but I'd try what's on the menu first.  This is some of the best Chinese food I've eaten in Las Vegas without a doubt. 

Why?  Well... here we go:

1)  FLAVORS, FLAVORS, FLAVORS:
Man, do these folks know flavors.  I may go into the poor house buying their shrimp dumplings or their Kalbi ribs but damn is this place tasty.  The culinary concoctions that they've put together are just superb.
...And folks:  The menu is small for a reason.  It's because most of the dishes are so caringly prepared, they take longer than a normal Chinese restaurant.  I wish some of the other reviewer's would understand that.  If you're running a restaurant, you don't want to have people spending forever trying to make up their mind if you're putting together dishes that frankly take time and care to put together.   This isn't an operation that pulls crap out of a the refrigerator, dumps it into a stir fry pan for 3 minutes and serves it:  Everything is made on the spot.
...So if you're looking for bulk dishes or cheaper prices, just go down to ""Zine"" at the casino level for God's sakes.

2) SERVICE
The waiters there aren't just employees, they're not just customers... they're seriously invested long term into the restaurant.  Just ASK them.  I've had numerous discussions with the friendly waitstaff about why they stay at the restaurant, what the future is of Woo, and why they love it so much, and the answer is pretty consistent:  They believe in the family and their tastes.  The Wu family knows how to make a good dish.
...It should be noted that according to ""The Strip"" podcast Sheldon Adelson himself is a frequent guest just as he was at the Mayflower.  In an interview with the family's daughter,  Adelson originally asked Peter Wu and his family to pull up roots from the old famed Mayflower restaurant and come set up shop at Palazzo and with good reason:  If you want a good flavorful meal to invite a delegation of Chinese businessmen to, this is the place to do it at.  

3) SERENITY
Yes, it's pretty quiet here.  And frankly, I kind of like it.  Unlike the tasteless and raunchy ambiance of Sushi Samba or the cafeteria like atmosphere of Mainland, ""Woo"" is a quiet, off to the side restaurant that focuses more on the food and less on the dynamic.
...Admittedly, this hasn't exactly been their choice.  They don't have the draw of ""Emeril Lagasse"" like Table 10 does or ""Wolfgang Puck"" like CUT does, but those that know, know that Woo's got them all beat for sheer tastiness per dish.

CONCLUSION:
I consider this to be one of my personal secrets that I go to at least for lunch every trip.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone I know as being the only cuisine really worth taking the side trip to try at Palazzo.",hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA,1,1,5,Ahqs8bpBDqqWV3X6dtAS7Q

Since the restaurant only opened 3 days ago, the dining guests were definitely outnumbered by the waiters. We had at least 4 people waiting on us. While normally that would be a good thing, that was not the case at Woo. We often felt rushed as they try to clear our table between dishes -- even in cases when we still had food on the plate! Our conversation was also interrupted at least on 2 occasions because the waiter just had to describe our dish to us.

Our main waiter kept upselling us on entrees and drinks too. He recommended that we order at least 2 of everything so that we could have a few bites of each dish as the portions were on the smaller side. Um hello, do you not see 4 relatively petite women at this table?
He also seemed very particular about where we placed our glasses, plates, and utensils. He kept moving stuff around as if they were in the way of where he wanted to place the dishes. 

all of the dishes were overpowered by the sauces -- either too much of it or just plain too sweet.

Oh and one final note...even the bathroom was rather unimpressing. the toilet seats were way too low and the toilet paper dispenser was not the easiest to use.

But with a free 3 course meal curtsey of The Palazzo we thought we should give it a shot. Well things were mixed. To start, they have a $25 corkage fee. Not unusual in Vegas but at least you would expect an outstanding wine list. Woo, not so much. A very small list with some decent wine but greatly overpriced. As a positive, they did provide decent stemware. 

Onto the service. I would say our server and the man bringing our food provided outstanding service. Friendly, responsive and informed. This was a major part in them getting 2 stars from me. 

We had 5 dishes plus dessert. The starters were mixed. The chicken pot sticker was absolutely outstanding. The cod wrapped in butter lettuce was tasty but was overly salty and had strong candied/caramel flavors that took away from the balance. For the main course, my wife had the Kalbi rib eye. Now this was one ugly dish when it arrived but it did deliver on flavor and texture. Very nicely made and her plate was completely clean after a few minutes. I on the other hand got the wok seared salmon. This will go down as a shameful dish that should not have been served. Seared? Hardly. Overcooked to hell, yes. But thankfully before overcooking the salmon, they didn't bother to season it, or the sauce it was served on top of. So they just served me a $28 (menu price) overcooked under seasoned piece of salmon. This alone takes away at least a star. Oh to add extra nothing, they topped it with tasteless tempura shrimp. I don't even know how they figured out how to serve something with no flavor. 

The servers, pot stickers and rib eye lead me to believe with some help they could pull off a nice meal, hence 2 stars. Hopefully they'll pay attention and get help.
