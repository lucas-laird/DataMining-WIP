On the Station Casino app, it says that it opens at 8:00 am. So I called shortly after (while we were driving to the next place to eat, with our super hungry and grumpy four year old) trying to be helpful and just let them know that the app states the 8:00 am time for opening on Sunday. The lady on the phone let me know that, ""Fiesta Henderson opens at 8, unfortunately Rancho opens at 9."" I kindly said that they should probably clarify that information, and she unenthusiastically says, ""okay,"" basically acknowledging what I said but we knew she wasn't going to say anything to anyone.

I didnt go here to gamble. And I doubt I will ever go back! 

The rooms are small, but comfortable and cozy. The hand soap and shampoo is actually the best thing about the place! So much so, that I pocketed all I could in my 3 days there. 
Hotel is divided from the casino, have to use your room key to get in, which made me feel safe staying there with my kids. 
Poor selection of channels.
Hidden security deposit that NO ONE MENTIONED when booking, nor was it anywhere to be found on the online reservations page. No bellhop, had to force them to help me with my 8 suitcases upon checkout. But I tipped the guy who got stuck with the job.

Made reservations for a king room, when checked in all they had was s double double. The room was 3rd grade at best. The sheets were wrinkled and yellowish. The walls was brink with peeling paint. The carpet looked like it was installed 20 years ago. Some guy playing loud rap music in the parking lot. Despite several calls to the front desk, the wifi, included in the hotel fees never worked.

693941,2015-10-13,2,19umlhmVB9O3njIBfRAe8g,"If you value your safety, DON'T stay here. No. Seriously. If you want to unwillingly share your belongings, then feel free. Otherwise, read this:

We're locals, but for the last couple of years we've been living in HB. We often have to go back to take care of our house, but if it's a short trip like over a weekend to do maintenance, we usually stay at a hotel rather than have the utilities turned on and off. We prefer to stay at Aliante because of distance, but they were booked, so we opted to spend one night at the Fiesta Rancho. BIG MISTAKE.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is that there are two types of people in the casino: Zombie seniors who never take their eyes off the slot machines, even when they pick up their free drinks or smoke while pumping quarters in and pushing buttons. The other are flat out dangerous gangbangers. That's it. If you have to go out to your vehicle to get something, you had better be armed, and it isn't against the senior citizens.

We checked in & had a room with a ""pool view"" on the first floor. BTW, that's not a pool, that's a cement pond. I wouldn't put my feet in it for fear of an infection that would drive away all mankind. 

The entire place smells like they are trying to use a massive amount of toilet cleaner to cover the smell of about 300 campsite outhouses that have been used by 600 Boy Scouts at their annual Jamboree where they'd just sampled their first Mexican/Indian/Thai/Curry with extra Brussels Sprout fusion dishes in an all-you-can eat stinkfest buffet. I wanted to gag.

The walls of the rooms are literally made up of painted cinder blocks like you see on those prison shows. Honestly, the room isn't much better than a prison cell. 

The first thing that happened was my youngest daughter, who always takes her shoes off when entering a room, stepped on an exposed tack strip and it punctured her foot. When I complained, they couldn't care less. All they asked was whether I wanted to fill out a security report. Are you kidding me? Send MAINTENANCE and FIX IT! Nope. 

I should mention, we stayed on a Sunday night, not exactly a hotbed of activity anywhere else in LV. On the other hand, at the Fiesta, every night is a hotbed of activity because the gangbangers can just wander up Carey Ave. and Hey! If they don't have the bus money to get back to MLK, they'll just rob you to get it. But if you have a cell phone on you, they'll take that, too. In that case, you're one of the lucky ones.  If you're one of those unlucky senior zombies, they will take your dentures, which apparently almost any pawn shop in town will cash in for a bus token, as long as the gangbangers paint one tooth gold. 

The shower is made for someone 4'11"" and shorter, and I am SHORT, so plan on taking a bath/shower, which means you're going to be sitting in the bath while the shower head blasts down on you. About every 14 seconds, the water will turn scalding, so schedule your bath/showers accordingly. Jump in. Batman roll out! Wash hair in 12 seconds. Jump out! Breathe. Jump in. Wash your body in 12 seconds. Jump out! Just hope you don't have to shave your legs. Otherwise, there's a good chance you won't have any skin left from which to shave any stubble. Forget shaving your arms. I'm pretty sure, if you're as careful as I am not to cut the armpits for fear of any sweat later causing you horrible pain, you'd wish you were in Mexico drinking the local water while taking a laxative instead of showering here.  

On the other hand, considering the housekeeping, I wouldn't even suggest you sit on the toilet without Clorox Wipes under you. Sure, your a** gets a bleach burn, but it's better than the Gunga you will probably catch from either the toilet seat or the bathtub. For this stay, just soak a towel in bleach, carry it around with you, and use it to step on, bathe on, sit on, sleep on, and wash your hands, face, teeth, eyeballs! Pretty much, by the time you get out of there, if your skin wasn't that white before, it will be when you leave. Or, you know, you may have caught something you don't want to bring home to your wife/husband or kids.    

And let's talk about the water closet. Not a bathroom. Do yourself a favor, and just go ahead and give up wiping yourself while you're a guest here. I am 5'3"" and weigh 95 pounds so I can't imagine how much of your hand will be immersed in the toilet water just to wipe if you're bigger. The toilet is made for children, which strangely at first, made me feel tall when my knees were way above my hips. I'm happy when my feet touch the ground when I am sitting on an adult chair, so if you don't have this short-person problem, holy crap! Don't go to the bathroom here. Bring a wok. You would be better off! You can do all your business right there in the wok, toss it in the hallway, and no one would know the difference with the stink of all those Boy Scouts eating their stinky buffet and the 7000 pounds of toilet cleaner they use...everywhere!",t7jrwutL_d12aTh2xvvDgQ,2,0,1,gFeDNF6L9CtW3rEC8Fnj5Q

They ended up moving us but because of this we didn't get a paper with the room key number on it and got lost. after waiting nearly an hour in the reception I got a bad attitude from the girl at the counter and had to jump through 100 hoops just to get it. The room kept fluctuating between SUPER hot and SUPER cold through no control of our own, the Channel selection was VERY limited (no cartoons, and no comedy central but 5 news channels)  on the television. The walls were paper thin and the hallways REEKED of marijuana. Housekeeping was very loud and took our do no disturb sign twice. No toiletries were offered but a crusty towel and a small bar of soap, there was no coffee maker and 2 cups. Dining options were limited, and the only real restaurant they had was a Denny's We will give the Denny's a different review (YUCK!). Check out went smoothly, was assured we would be charged no more and we were assured we would not be charged any further and receive our deposit in no more than 72 hours but they charged us an additional 32 dollars that was never explained and we had to wait 5 days to get our deposit back.

Then the woman at the Amigo cards desk totally blew me away and its times like that they should be lucky my wife has a tight chain on me. First of all I didnt know that kids even toddlers have been banned from the casino floor unless they are on the platform of an eatery. So, when Im standing 10 feet away from my wife waiting for her to get the amigo card the woman at the desk was like you HAVE TO stand at McDonalds you cannot be here with anyone under 21. Im like WTF? Shes 2, what the hell do you have to worry about???? and in a STROLLER! What is she gonna slap a waitress on the ass order a jack a coke, take a drag off a found cigarette butt and pop in her bus money and take a chance on the reels like some honky? No! Was she screaming? NO! Did she scream when I had to take her away from my wife? YES! Stupid fucking laws, you know why casinos are loosing money? Because they are overly dependent on Dincs  (double income no children), retirees and transients! WAKE THE FUCK UP VEGAS! If a casino is connected to a hotel, an attraction (like the ice rink outback), a movie theater, bowling alley etc.. then HELLO! Your gonna have families and kids! If you are harassing my two year old because you cant control the hood rats then find the revenue to pay for COMPOTENT security not barney fife! Ive done casino security for years and Im damn good at it. Never had an insurance liability issue in all the years Ive worked in a casino. So this new anti family laws are bullshit and its why your loosing money. Because of how poorly you treated us and how my daughter was made to feel like a prisoner having to be only on the tiled areas, keeping a family SEPERATED while one takes care of player card stuff and check cashing we cant be together? Thats fucking stupid. Bring on the state tax cause if this is how you treat paying LOCAL customers who would have ate theyre had it not been for your poor staff and nazi like regime then I can totally see why LOCAL casinos are going belly up! Sad sad state of affairs. Bottom line, I understand casinos are not a childrens play place and that some people cant control theyre hellions. HOWEVER I have better service at the Klondike off sunset and its PURELY a gamblers place, no ice rink or hotel so no reason for kids to be theyre but when we go for breakfast they have never treated us harshly or cruely like Fiestas employees.

1) I called around 5pm or so to book the room. The lady on the phone asked me if I wanted a king. She also said that I couldn't cancel because it was same day. No problem. I said yes, because that's what I wanted. 

2) She tells me how much it is, and after fees, its just under $100 for the night. No problem, I booked the room.

3) I get there and there are 3 people in front of me, then three more people show up after me and only 1 register open, so I wait almost 30 minutes to check in. Even the people behind me were complaining and I'd been there twice as long as them.

4) I finally get to the counter around 6:20pm and the lady tells me they don't have any kings available and haven't since yesterday. That pisses me off because the lady on the phone told me I was good for a king. Then the lady says that the king is only a ""request""... well don't bill my card for a king if its only a request. Say that up front instead of lying to the customer and STEALING their money.

5) So now I can't cancel and we're stuck with a crappy room with 2 full beds instead of a king, like I was told I would have.

Avoid this place. They are liars. Any time you don't disclose that the customer may not actually get what they think they are paying for, it is dishonest. 

On top of that, they have the worst buffet in Vegas. I wouldn't even use my comps to eat there. I'm thoroughly pissed off right now because I'd much rather go somewhere else and actually get what I pay for.

When we placed our order for food we received a portion of what we had ordered. The food was not good at all. The chicken nuggets arrived soggy and full of grease and everything else was cold. When we asked to speak to the manager it took 15 minutes for him to arrive, he stopped and spoke to the people next to us and proceeded to walk away. My husband to hail him down and ask him to come back. We informed him of the issues and he said he would look into it. 30 minutes later he nor our waiter returned.  People from our party started to leave and we had not received a bill yet. After someone hunted the manager down again he arrived with the bill, stated that he could not locate our waiter and advised us he had taken 20% off. After careful calculation we realized we had been charged for food and drinks we never received and that issue to another 20 minutes to clear up. 

Outside of the service issue there were a couple of other problems. The establishment has a live band that plays Banda music. The musicians go out into the crowd, sing to people, and take special request. They refused to pay any attention to me when My husband requested a song but when the table next to us made the same request they played it. I am not sure if the issue was they did not understand his Spanish or maybe it was the color of his skin. Let me make something clear Hispanics come in all shades of the rainbow and apparently so does ignorance. I recorded a video of him and the way the musician turned his back on him when he made the request. 

The other issue I had with this establishment was while attempting to take care of the billing situation at the register the manager was to busy eating Ramens  he got from another establishment to assist the young lady in correcting the errors on our bill. The reason I know this is because he sat out in the open eating them with a couple of his friends. I don't know about some people but I am a little turned off when individuals that work at an eating establishment don't eat their own food or they eat food from somewhere else out in the public eye. 

Maybe this establishment does not care about making themselves or the casino money an the community they do business in. From what I have read and heard throughout the casino there seems to be a general theme of horrible service. 

If it were not for the fact that this establishment is located in a casino and the consequence of getting black listed from all of their sister casinos we would have all walked out and not paid the bill.",tpOqn0OsbWp0acpw7rkQcA,0,0,1,5XQZ4WLtyuo5p77zNG5WqA

I was surprised to see how much this place has changed and for the better.

The addition of the drive up sportsbook and new Sinaloan Style restaurant were a plus.  

First off the casino and lobby have been refreshed.  New carpet, wood floors and paint. Also the ventilation was updated.  

The casino floor seems to have a more open layout.

Now to the room. 

Let me say the addition of new ac unit, furnishings, paint and a flat screen tv were very impressive.  The last time I stayed here I felt uneasy seeing a tube tv.  Though the room is still small it is comfortable and clean. 

The casino staff as well as room service were courteous and welcoming.

Not being far from the strip, this is an absolute value play.  

If all you need is a clean place to sleep for a few hours and take a shower, this is a great alternative to the strip hotels. 

The ease of getting in and out of the hotel is another advantage. 

I will never hesitate to stay and play here again.

The buffet was good and reasonably priced.

My biggest gripe with this hotel (and the reason I only gave it 2 stars) is the extreme incompetence of the woman at the front desk. When I tried to check my father in law and my sister in law in to their room, the person at the desk couldn't find their reservation because she was looking for it using my father in law's FIRST name instead of his last name. She claimed his CA drivers license confused her. It wasn't until I demanded the manager that I was able to clear things up.

Yeah, it's obviously a budget property, with some signs like worn carpet and etc. ... but the rooms were actually nicer than I was expecting based on the unenthusiastic reviews here and elsewhere. Everything done in a bit of a Mexican villa style. You need a room key to get through a door to get into the hotel area after hours.

Re: thin walls mentioned in other reviews, I was also surprised here. I ended up with a two-bed room since that was all they had, through the bed wall I heard nothing but a faint baby squall here and there ... but when I walked by that room's door en route to the elevator I could clearly hear two older kids being rambunctious as hell in there with the TV cranked up! Wasn't making it through the wall. And that was the thinner wall, each room has one of those and then cinder blocks opposite it which are more substantial. 

The only downsides that dock a star - the wifi flat didn't work (connects but went nowhere) and no mini-fridge in the room. Plus the shower was a little goofy. 

Decent location for budget food. Buffet on site is inexpensive, though unlike other Station properties it is NOT open for breakfast. Panda Express that charges about 50 cents more than normal but is right next to the hotel area for super convenience. Also a BBQ joint that I really wanted to try, but when I stopped by at 11:15 after checking out they were still not yet ready to rock.

The desserts weren't that awesome, but I was pretty full from the food, so I won't complain. You can also get $1 margarita upon entering the buffet! It's not weak either - I was feeling it after one.

There are many wonderful attributes that Fiesta Rancho has that simply cannot be found elsewhere. The value that the casino offers is second to none when it comes to prices of the buffet, limit table games, and rarified classics such as ALL PAPER Bingo. The clientele is older, lower middle class locals and a few stereotypical degenerates that find Texas Station to be too high falootin'. It is a poor man's Station Casino, that's for sure, but that doesn'tmean it should be avoided. Quite the opposite, actually. 

Occasionally when I'm driving home from a late night playing cards on the Strip, I'll stop by Fiesta Rancho just to throw some dice or play some 21. Their crap table is often just run by the dealers. No box man, and half of the table is closed. The limits are $3 with 10x odds, which puts them better than most Strip casinos that usually offer 3x4x5x odds. The place is rarely crowded and the atmosphere is casual, smoky, degeneracy laden, and fun. 

The buffet offers a great value, especially if you have kids. Though the prices have been raised, lunch is still right around $6. No breakfast is offered. Dinner is $7 or $8 and included a pretty good selection of somewhat flavorful Mongolian, American, and Mexican choices plus pizza and pasta (I hesitate to truly call it ""Italian"")

The casino offers an ice skating rink (random, I realize) and a small sports book. 

Overall, I do recommend Fiesta Rancho for those wanting a divey local's casino that is world's above Poker Palace but light years below Red Rock.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,5,3,3,utzfFb1cPGshGhScb6VHBQ

I was in heaven sleeping in that nice big comfy king size bed!  Ah...I have so many good things to say about this place, just wait! 

1) Loved the fact that check-in was incredibly simple (I used the Hotels app on my phone to book one day in advanced).  I gave my name, ID and she found me and already had my room keys set aside.  **One thing to remember is that no matter whether you're a local or not, you have to put a $100.00 deposit down, don't forget!  

2) The room was nice and clean, plenty of towels, face cloths, soap and shampoo

3) The AC unit was a traditional unit but was controlled from the wall, AWESOME feature- it got really cold fast too, just how I  like it!

4) The bed didn't come with a bagillion covers like some hotels do, it had the sheet and nice thick duvet on top, lovvvvvved that

5) There was free wifi access and a cord as well to plug in (which saved the day when we had a storm)

6) Plenty of lighting and a nice big window to let in plenty of sunshine

7) Newspaper every morning when I woke up to leave for work, kudos!

8) I almost forgot to mention! For the shower lovers out there who just have to have the right pressure- well, LOOK NO FURTHER! This is the BEST hotel shower I have ever used, I mean EVER! You can control the pressure, and the heat is incredible! I even shut the door turned it to max and enjoyed a 'sauna-like' environment for 20 minutes

Please note that there is a $11 and change charge each day (resort fee) which includes things such as # 5 & #7, but seriously the room was only $19.79 a night so were talking like $30 and I got all this awesomeness!  Even though it wasn't a Wynn or Bellagio, it was fantastic for the price and just what I was looking for! 

For TV fanatics, note that the TV is just a standard tube 32incher, BUT it comes with movies still in theatres, a selection of your preference of 'out of theaters' Thriller, Comedy, etc. and for the more risky lovers, they have lots of adult channels; straight, bi, gay, lesbian- whatever your preference you have it! 

The casino itself was nice, great size and offered quite a few places to eat.  Check out Gurdanos! And heck smash burger too, they were all wonderful! 

The absolute only thing that I can say about this visit where I had to call the front desk was in regards to the ice machine.

THE ROOM- well what can I say, 2 beds, a shower and a tub, and a basic TV. They say they have wireless, but in a 3 night stay, the first 2 nights they had to come and reset the access point. The last time they did this, they said the access point in our room was broken, so we did not have WiFi, but they were ""nice"" enough to loan us an ethernet cable. The speed is terrible, and do not even try to stream a video with their network. 

Casino- Fair at best. Few blackjack tables, and if you think other sports are better than basketball, stay away. When I was placing some bets on hockey games, people in line were yelling to hurry up, even though there were no other open windows. (I was up there for less than 2 minutes)

The Fiesta is the smaller and more intimate of these two casino options. Seniors with mobility issues may have an easier time getting around here due the more compact floorplan and convenient arrangement of all the pertinent attractions.

The Fiesta has one of the most reasonably priced buffets in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and is always worth a visit with it's plentiful variety of food attractively presented at six cooking stations and multiple international cuisines.

A coffee shop and a Denny's are also located on the premises. The usual casino table games and a plethora of one-armed bandits/poker machines are available whenever your itch to gamble needs scratching.

The front desk staff was useless.  I was only waiting behind one family, but it took FOREVER to get checked in.  One receptionist was hopelessly trying to help the family, and the other one was just sitting there doing nothing.  I understand sometimes that there's a wait, but neither one of them said ""I'll be with you in a moment"", or ""I'm sorry, I'm in training (or whatever) and she'll help you in a moment"", or anything remotely useful.  When I got helped, not only did I not get an apology for the wait, but the receptionist was rude and brusk.

The key reader to get into the hotel tower didn't work 80% of the time, regardless of the key.  I saw quite a few people struggling with it.

We had booked a room with a king bed, but they gave us a room with two doubles.  We were only there for one night, so we just put up with it because there was no way we were going to try and deal with the front desk again.

The room was clean, but very basic, almost to the point of being prison-like.  If you like staring at cinder block walls, you will love the decor here.  The walls and doors are paper-thin, to the point of being nearly able to hear conversations in the next room.  You could definitely clearly hear conversations people were having in the hallway.  It's the kind of place where you worry that people will hear what you're doing.  The clientele was a bit sketchy since it's a cheap place, but the place was well-lit and had security everywhere.

I've stayed at the Venetian and New York New York and this casino is not much smoker than those. It definitely seems to have a ventilation system.  I have never smoked and am sensitive to smoke but honestly it's fine. It is a casino after all!  The staff has been very friendly and helpful. I was playing a machine and noticed staff going around cleaning, straightening chairs.  The rink isn't too cold for spectators, even in summer clothes.

Food: my teenager is happy that there is a SubWay, Panda Express, and Denny's right inside the hotel/casino. We had a nice Mexican dinner at a Mexican restaurant in the casino last night with yummy coconut margaritas. They put toasted coconut around the rim with honey.  We haven't tried the buffet. They have Italian, Mongolian, not sure what else.

Cleanliness: like I say, they're cleaning a lot in the casino. My room smelled very clean, even a little bleachy when we arrived. The shower is a little worn, but I don't care. They have a non-smoking area of the casino. No tables in that section, just machines. Public bathrooms in the casino are large, modern (lots of tile), and very clean. The carpet in the Denny's is a bit trashed looking but the Denny's is otherwise clean. They decorate a lot and have left lots of adhesive stuff on the walls. Weird, but not an issue.

Room: clean, basic. No microwave, coffee pot, or fridge. They do have wall outlets handy, which is sometimes not so even in more expensive hotels. I have a view of a parking lot, abandoned drive-in and a billboard advertising a Hawaiian buffet. No free Wi-Fi. I think it's $6 for 24hrs. I'm using the hot spot on my phone. No conditioner.  Newer, up-to-date bedding. Air conditioner works great. Plenty cool in there.

Location: 22 min North from McCarren Airport  on MapQuest.  10min North of Downtown/Fremont Street Experience.  Next to Texas Station, same property owner. Texas Station has a bowling alley, theatre, Starbucks.  People say their buffet is good.

Transportation: taxis on site. We took the 106 bus from a bus stop across the street and rode 20min south to Downtown last night to go to the Fremont Street Experience. The bus was running every 30min. $2 for single trip. $3 for 2-hr pass. $5 all day. There is a 24-hr ""Deuce"" shuttle between Downtown and the Strip. It's over 100 degrees, so it was hot waiting but there is a small bus shelter. Not bad.

Pool: basic, small, clean.  Clean towels provided poolside but no food, drinks, or dressing area.

Casino: a few card tables, lots of  machines, a Keno runner circulating at least thru Denny's, a Keno machine area, several bars, a large Bingo hall.  I had an issue with my machine so lit the call button. The guy was there in about 10seconds to re-boot it. Very friendly. There's a bar in the center of the casino; not walled in.

This is not as upscale as properties on the strip, but it's not on the strip.  Smoky? Yeah, but not bad. I would come back!

I hadn't been there for awhile and figured it might be nice to be reminded why I liked the Fiesta Rancho. I started out in the Cabo Lounge with four deuces and two Budweisers and moved on when someone started smoking next to me. 

I sat down at an Alien machine near bingo and put in a $20 from my winnings. I proceeded to lose the entire $20 in short order. I sat at the machine waiting for a cocktail waitress (one hadn't come because I lost my money so quickly). 

Josefina finally came around the corner asking for cocktail orders. I ordered a Corona. She said, ""are you going to be playing?"" 

I replied, ""I just lost $20.""

She stuck to her script and said, ""I was in the area and did not see you at the machine.""

I said, ""I'd like to speak to your manager.""

I waited for a good 12 minutes for Josefina to return before I noticed she was at the cocktail station chatting away with another coworker. I started to think, 'she didn't see me in her station because she REALLY takes her time doing her job.' She didn't think that during the time she was socializing in her work station that I could have lost $20. 

Needless to say the manager did not show and I did not get a beer that has a cost of somewhere around $0.89.  Now that's customer service!

They have average eating options including Gardunos, blue agave, subway and dryers ice cream. For fun, there is an ice arena, club tequila, and a couple longues for the older crowd! I do have to say that they have pretty cheap drinks here, which I never object to. I got a margarita for 99 cents! 

Other than what I listed, there's really not much to do here, especially if you have some underagers! I recommend that if you do have kids stayin with you here, you should go ice skating or just hop next door to Texas and see a movie :)",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,5,2,2,X4moTzeiJ9HDD7eQdY2VlA

We were first given a smoking room and we had reserved a non-smoking room. They stated they had rented all the nonsmoking. We went to the room to check it our and it had an unbearable smell. We returned to the desk to complain. They first stated ""sorry"", no vacancy left. I asked for them to cancel the reservation only to find out that if I canceled I still would have to pay for the room anyway. My wife stated she has Asthma and showed her medication and inhaler. At that point, they gave us a handicap room. Stains on the walls and shower. Not the bed we paid for, and not a standard shower. No coffee maker or any other commodities. Tried to get a partial refund and was refused by the Fiesta Management and Hotels.com. We will relate this establishment to all our family, friends and acquaintances regarding the sub-par accommodations, cheating, lying, and bad customer service given by these two establishments.

Part of Station Casinos, this place must be the blacksheep of their properties. I don't recommend staying here, playing here, or eating here.

Ok so this is part of a Stations Casino, but nothing like Red Rock or even Santa Fe. It is a older and dimly lit casino with lots of smoke, dirt, and of course equally dirty people. I would have to say that this casinos best friend is the bus line and the people who come here from the bus. Most people in this place I believe are spending welfare money and trying to win enough to pay for another week at the budget suites and other low income housing around the surrounding area. 
The ceilings are low, the machines are pretty old and there will always be some form of cigarette ash and debris you will remove from your play area. There is a bingo hall which is ok.. however you will smell cigarettes and urinal/fart smells most of the time playing. Even though there is no guarantee of winning coming to any casino, there is a guarantee that your hair and clothing will smell of smoke, and trash when leaving this place. 
I have never experienced the ice rink, or even stayed at the hotel as a guest... which I would never do even if comped. I have experienced a older woman vomiting in a trash can who was chain smoking and then telling the staff that she had some bad Chinese food. I also experience a woman who was sitting at a Buffalo machine tell me and my girlfriend that another man at the bar was ""trying to get at her butt-hole"". This place will play 90's hip hop/ popular music and does actually have some really nice employees. Please tip them well as they really deserve it. 
With all that said, don't worry about getting dressed up or even doing your hair when coming here as it is totally not needed. If you wanna fit in just wear pajamas, have some smokes, have some gold in your teeth, and of course understand the meaning of lowered expectations. Who knows you might be able to bring a hood rat heffa home with you if thats your thing. Enjoy !",bX0ZrqsZ6ZyQ_Xgxvo9-Qg,1,1,2,tXncBGvglqU1UPse-_dKAg

*** Casino Only ***


It Seems like we go to this Casino whenever we are close by in the area.We usually stop to gamble or to hit the buffet since it is cheaper than some casino buffets and it is not that bad for the money like a 3 star. Not the best but not the worse depending on what you eat.

It is for sure a locals place a bit too far from the strip.

I did not know they had a skating rink till now considering how many times we have been here! That is pretty cool. 

Fiesta is not glamorous by no means. It is a older looking casino. They do offer quite a few slot machines. We have never had a problem playing here or going to the buffet.

You can use your station casino card here to get your points added as well as get offers sent to you. 
We have had free buffets as well as free slot play and other offers. 

If your close by check it out even if it is just for one of the restaurants.

They also have :

Denny's
Panda Express
Subway
Dreyer's Ice Cream
Big Ern's BBQ
and
Blue Agave
Garduño's",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,13,12,3,ZL84P6jLCyBK33RHJaNP1w
5972437,2012-11-01,0,19umlhmVB9O3njIBfRAe8g,I have eaten at the Fiesta Rancho Buffet this summer and it was a great value.  Very cheap and pretty good food.  This time the summer prices were marked back up to normal buffet prices which still isn't too bad.  Just ate there this week and was very disappointing with their policy towards children.  My buddy Steve had his twin 2 year old twin girls and a 3 year old boy with him.  The buffet policy for the buffet is it's free if you are 1 year old or under but if you are 2 you pay full price adult dinner price.  His kids hardly eat anything so it ended up $50 for two adults and a few really small children that shared some rice and a couple of apple juices.  They really need to put a new policy that children are 1/2 off the adult price.  A little bit of a break for the little ones.  They could also increase the age kids eat free to a higher number that is more reasonable but I do know there are a lot of people that lie and will say their kids are 2 when they are 4.  That's why I think the 1/2 off is the way to go..still have to pay just not what an adult does.  I don't want something to take advantage of the place just something more reasonable.  In this economy everything helps.,Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,1,0,1,27qD4qT4_-uLpZW7rKSoQg
