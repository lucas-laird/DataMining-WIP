Then said nothing until she started making the sand which . And I asked her to toast my sandwich and looked at me like I was dumb and said the toaster was down Right now . Okay ? It's hard to have a bad experience at subway . Thank you for that .,BcIFC2A4HbGo09hUU8VLHw,1,0,1,P0nrAiuniX2VGD-wq7STSg

This review is specifically about the manager of this location. I work in customer service and this person should never be allowed to represent the subway franchise on any level, employee or manager. He insulted my girl friend and brought her to tears. When I asked for the owners name and information he told me he did not have it. BS! every store manager has the district managers name and number and the owner of the store information. I have been working with hundreds of subways in my career and know a little more about subways then most people. Normally a subway owner will own multiple location and something Even dozens. Then when I made a corporate complaint the district manager told me that I was a Lying about my story, what horrible people they have representing  the franchise in this community. What reason do I have to lie the DM and GM must be friends outside of work because no supervisor should ever cover for employee misconduct. THIS IS WHY I HAVE NOT EATEN AT ONE SUBWAY SINCE AND WILL NEVER GIVE THE ORGANIZATION MY MONEY AGIAN.",xUSag5Ad6FopTsyFrAsaLQ,1,0,1,4vPK_9fKQo5riHaaUOmQSQ
1919595,2018-06-14,0,Z1HnNAGBt0y9uZX1a1_9sQ,I've never had better service at a subway in my life. Dustin the night shift worker was slammed but so polite and fun with every customer in line and made sure you knew he appreciated your patience. Such and awesome guy !!,7BFqcDGohn8yc4oU4wwxbw,0,0,5,aFVzJDxtNzP0tlwnU_LlIQ
2093336,2017-04-06,0,Z1HnNAGBt0y9uZX1a1_9sQ,"Now, food-wise, this Subway is pretty standard. 
Cheap, quick, decently passable food. Normally, I would give this place a 3 star, because I'm not the hugest fan of the food or the fact that if you eat here you'll smell like the ingredients for the rest of the day.... but I'm giving it one whole extra star because of the STAR quality of service I had on Tuesday morning.

I was helped by a nice lady who quickly made me a Tuesday special (chicken breast sub). She was excellent, extremely sweet, and just good at her job. I thoroughly was impressed, therefore I recommend this place to those in the area! :)",bJ_CWJ55ZLgwNvo-OAW2Og,0,0,4,V8eTUQz0Do_zqybO83a9fw
2967349,2015-11-17,0,Z1HnNAGBt0y9uZX1a1_9sQ,"I went to this subway around 6:30pm on Saturday after visiting my gym. Alex (I think that was the employee's name, it's on my receipt!) helped me and was very nice and amusing. Considering the lot of us in the restaurant and Alex being by himself, he worked very quickly! 

I felt bad that he seemed very tired and was by himself, it sounded as if some other employees didn't show up. I appreciate that he kept his spirits up and didn't take that out on us as many employees at other establishments have before! 

Thank you for making my meal, it was delicious!",dYXkcwz6Xs8cFCtGfihE7A,2,0,4,TuxtTlSMfpTdMDnoPq9poA

We walked in and moments later she came out of the bathroom and went behind the counter and said ""what size and what bread"".",xCQcH9Dm_y_LXzas3TlJEw,0,0,1,wcSa_c8xRCLAk8rKhDQ9Mw
4321665,2016-03-14,0,Z1HnNAGBt0y9uZX1a1_9sQ,Seems like there is a different person who works here everyday. By chance the last two times I've visited here I got the same girl. Last time she (the tall blonde) made my husband and I's sandwiches she didn't even cut the sandwiches in half. This time she didn't give me proper change back for my transaction. She's less than friendly and seems put out working here. The sandwiches are good but lacking in customer service. Two stars is for the sandwich alone.,g_pUYlnlfLyx_RSzWLXNlA,0,0,2,YSCWVbQUBFOXdoceljQ7Pw

5044072,2017-08-13,0,Z1HnNAGBt0y9uZX1a1_9sQ,"Subway food is always amazing. I love the food so much but this 1 star isn't about the food. It's about the customer service. So a couple of us were pretty hungry and we were just a bit indecisive on what kind of meat we wanted, we were extremely nice to the guy who was working, Eric but his name tag said something else? So not sure what his name was but Eric was on the receipt. Like I was saying, being indecisive on what kind of meat we wanted, we apologized. But as rude as he was, he was getting impatient and constantly kept asking us ""what kind of meat do you want"" which was irking us & pressuring us a lot. We weren't entirely done with our orders and I needed to order about 2 more sandwiches and I apologized again asking for 2 more sandwiches and he looked at me and rolled his eyes. I get it, you're tired & you're working a late shift but I was being extremely nice to you. And when he was ringing my orders up, I wanted one last drink to wrap up this whole order & he dead stares at me & gives me attitude saying ""HOW MANY?"" And rolls his eyes again. Which was so extra of him to be rude about. Why work there if you hate it so much to a point where you have to take it out on the customers? Like come on. Eric or whatever, has to work on his customer skills.",1YfHCtcflow82fH9gOggiA,1,0,1,OTJFAJ6vih2MF58zjzbM8w

5241032,2016-10-18,3,Z1HnNAGBt0y9uZX1a1_9sQ,"Alrighty, we get here and only one girl was working a big order. So it took forever just to get our order started.
Finally a guy named Jorge comes out of the bathroom or whatever, and goes in to take our order. He starts out asking what we want and is just flat out rude the entire time. Didn't even say hello was demanding us to give him our order. I give him my order and I told him exactly what I wanted but he got a phone call on his personal phone and left to go answer the call. So the girl took over, and I had to repeat my order and she gave me crap for telling her spinach last. Um she chose to put it last, I simply called out the items and she could have put it on first if she wanted.
She also came from the back where she was stocking up chicken trays into a container. She wasn't gonna switch her gloves when she was gonna do my order until I asked her if she was getting new gloves.
She goes yeah I'll change them if you want, I was just doing the chicken.
Like HELLO. Especially if you're doing chicken so I want your gloves changed. That should be automatic, homegirl.
The sodas are flat as well.

Overall super annoyed with Jorge thinking his phone call is more important than doing his job.",tGuMHXSvqcLTA7rifH_3_w,5,3,1,_-gwd2dcOpgavNnRHwPbEA
