One day we decided to skip restaurants and have lunch at the Cafe. Eggs Benedict or cafe Benedict are really very good. Especially given you can order them 24/7 OR visit the place any time of the day and night you want. There was one thing, however, that ruined the whole impression. The fork they gave me was dirty! It had food leftovers dried and stuck up to it, apparently, either from a dishwasher or whatever they use to wash their silverware. I informed our waiter and he replaced my silverware with a new set. Never in my life have I seen dirty forks wrapped in a clean white napkin! Also, during the ""rush hour"" we had to wait for our waitress for over 30 minutes! 

We picked a table overlooking the Conservatory. The view of the Chinese New Year decor was nice. But, like I said, the dirty fork just turned me off and ruined the whole experience.",FpR76ZvE1XDbGRXrQ6FofQ,0,0,3,UYOl6UBC93MqgZpWKSyc3Q

(1) Not a buffet (2) Not faux Chinese food (3) open 24 hours in the lobby

Menu has a broad assortment, so it's perfect for a large group who can't agree on anything (which is what usually happens by night 2 of Vegas trips).  A small sampling of our recent trip:

Half Caesar $8 - covered in dressing, ask for it on the side
Short rib sandwich $18 - thick pieces of meat - could barely finish 1/2, recommend splitting
Meatloaf $18 - very good, but another big portion, ideal for sharing

Service has always been great, so no complaints there.  My favorite thing about this place is the view - on one end you have the conservatory, and on the other you get the pool - not a bad place to relax and get away from the casino.",FFTX63pqjbhbBhdw-ZTXow,1,0,3,lzfb3ccpqr0PWvC6hmMSvw

I tried the BBQ Chicken salad during this visit.  It was a deconstructed salad, the romaine was left as a head and was just split down the middle.  You the customer needs to cut the romaine up into manageable bits and then cut off the inedible base.  The salad had a bbq ranch dressing, but I didn't get much on my plate.  I think having the dressing on the side would have been a better option.  The lettuce was accompanied by a pile of black beans and fried onion strings and a chicken breast that was cut into strips.   For $21 I was unimpressed, I think that the similar BBQ chicken salad at Panera taste better and is half the price.

The service, like most location in the Bellagio was impeccable.  The server was very nice and our drinks were filled and food was delivered quickly.

After a long day of travel and taking in the sights of Sin City, my family and I wanted a place to relax that wasn't too stuffy, too expensive, or too much trouble to get into.  Cafe Bellagio fit the bill perfectly.  Depending on where you're seated, you might have a view of the beautiful atrium where you can watch people and enjoy the botanical display.  We were fortunate to be favored with this view.  Elsewhere in the restaurant, however, without a view, the decor might feel slightly institutional.  The surfaces are hard and bright, although sound is muffled well.

Although the restaurant was half empty, service was abysmally slow.  I started with turkey chili, and my son had a first course salad.  Both of these took quite a while to come out, and even longer to be cleared away.  The salad was good, but the turkey chili was wonderful.  Some might find it slightly salty, but I favor a lot of salt, and I thought it was great.  Our main course was finally delivered.  I had a turkey burger, my son had meatloaf and mashed potatoes, and my wife had a Cobb salad.  Everyone enjoyed their meal immensely, although my son and I were more enthusiastic about our meals than my wife was about her salad.  Creme brulee was my son's choice of dessert, and he thought it was delicious.  It comes in an interesting snail- or nautilus-shaped bowl, and was sweet and creamy.

Unfortunately, our waiter disappeared after dessert, never to be seen again.  We finally appealed to another staff member, who prepared and settled our bill for us.    I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars, because the food is fabulous, and because it appeared that other diners, with different waitstaff, were being moved through expeditiously.  But there is no room for an establishment of this caliber to be anything less than perfect on all fronts, and the Cafe Bellagio fell short.",nyUKJ4H2Azatdvt4FvNNJw,0,0,3,-oH33iLzEj8sT5dCtHjX9g

Get a table overlooking the Conservatory, so you can check out whatever their current display is. It's always spectacular.

Even though this is their 24 hour ""coffee shop"", it is more upscale and they use quality ingredients. I love the attention to detail. The very first time I ate here, my iced tea had cubes made from tea and they still do that. Served with a little thing of simple syrup too for sugar lovers. For those complainers, find that at Denny's!

This last time, I had the Cobb salad ($15.50) that was served with an entire chicken breast and was so big, I only could finish half. Everything was fresh, fresh, fresh. The bread basket included some very tasty pretzel bread too.
. 
My friend had the Eggs Benedict ($17.50) and those were wonderful as well- love them for breakfast here.

I've tried most of the menu at some point- open faced hot turkey sandwich, Crab Benedict, their burgers, a lovely wiener schnitzel and the lobster omelette come to mind.

Many of the servers have been there since it opened, so they must love their jobs.

BTW, if you are a member of the Player's Club, you can get a line pass for here and the buffet-just go ask. You still have to pay, but the guest line is way shorter at busy times.
Prices are reasonable for The Strip-just a tad higher to keep out the trash (or most of it).",jX1qYFyrIuWtyFQgVkKrMQ,1,1,5,JOZACGsD_LcGzk0paBiIPA

The whole experience is just wonderful, way above average for what you think of when you think about a 24-hour cafe in a Vegas casino. We've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner - never had a bad meal. The service is always excellent and the food is delicious. 

On our last trip I discovered the breakfast item not to be equaled, the bananas fosters waffle. Perfection on a plate. It is simple, you get a waffle topped with bananas and warm, scrumptious fosters sauce. The waffle is the perfect size, you don't need anything on the side, just the waffle and a cup of coffee (or a Bellagio Cocktail as the case may be...) and you are set.

Sometimes there's a line to get in, but it moves along nicely. Even when they have been pretty packed, the service has been outstanding. Is it pricey? Yes.

It's not an accident, I think, that one cannot find an online menu with prices for Café Bellagio; even they must feel a bit embarrassed to charge $3 to add a slice of cheese to an already overpriced hamburger.  So.  The hamburger, topped with grilled onions (an extra $3) was delivered as ordered, medium, but was nonetheless dry and tasteless.  The accompanying deep fried onion rings (still ANOTHER $3, to substitute for French fries) were soggy, mushy, and almost certainly dumped into the hot oil from a plastic bag from a restaurant supply vendor. My burger (no cheese) and onion rings ended up at a total of $28 before tax and tip, and I've had much better at less than half the price.  It's pretty obvious that management knows it's the only dining venue in the Bellagio that doesn't require you to mortgage the farm, and that they're pretty cavalier about what they serve.

We signed the bill, but left it on the table where she couldn't reach it, or so we thought,  because we were still finishing up and sipping coffee. She reached over us to get the bill anyway.

The dinning room, which is large and beautifully decorated, looks out to gorgeous garden and pool areas.  It is set up with two waiting lines, one for the VIPs and the other for everyone else. 

My wife and I recently breakfasted there on a weekday morning and stood in the pedestrian line for about 15 minutes before being seated.  I noticed that at that time a large section of the restaurant was closed.  After perusing my menu I determined that an inner page was missing and had to have the menu replaced. 

Service was painfully slow, but eventually we placed our orders.  My wife chose a ham and cheese omelet and asked that the hash browns be substituted for a fruit cup.  I asked for the lobster omelet.  

After a lengthy wait we were served our food.  My wife's omelet was average and accompanied by cool hash browns instead of the fruit cup.  My omelet was awful.  It was very overcooked and thoroughly dried out, completely ruining the taste and texture of the ingredients.  The accompanying hash browns were actually cold and a half of tomato topped with cheese that should have been baked and served hot was also cold.  I would have asked to have my food returned, but I couldn't locate our waitress.  So as a result, I ate my toast and discarded almost all of the omelet and side dishes. 

Finally when the bill arrived, I provided my credit card and I asked the waitress to advise the manager of the problems encountered.  When the waitress returned my receipt, she informed me that she had spoken to the manager who cancelled the cost of my breakfast.  Still, that was little compensation for the utterly poor dining experience.

For the week we were in vegas, we ate here five or six times. The food was quite good, always made to order. Occasionally, we'd throw the chefs curve balls and ask for something very specific and not on the menu (our ""comfort food"").. it almost always came out perfect!

Several times, we wanted just a bit more alcohol to put us to sleep. Typically, this was a ""Chopin long pour with sugar-free red bull."" All except for one night, this was made nice and strong, just how we like it!

While no it was not the cheapest option, it was certainly the most enjoyable! I mean come on, buffet's suck ass. No one wants to eat food that has been left out for so long, and no one likes the exact same food! We all have our own little preferences as to cooking style and what not, so I highly recommend you give this ""Cafe"" a try! Throw a curve ball at the chefs and bartenders, and you shouldn't be disappointed!

Our favorite spot to sit is in the clover-shaped 4-plex booth to the left when you walk up the ramp, facing the conservatory . . . what a view and you get some of the best people watching in Vegas!

The food is consistently delicious.  Over the years (most recently in early March 2012), we have tried just about everything on the breakfast and lunch menus. For breakfast, I highly recommend the Bellagio Classic Omelet or the Maryland Crab Cake Benedict.  I always ask for my eggs on the soft side and they have never failed me.

Coffee is top notch, and they will leave a carafe on your table. They have real cream or milk, not the faux stuff that comes in mini plastic cups. I adore the fact that when you order an iced tea, the ice cubes are actually made with the tea itself as well.

Line was long, it always is - don't let that fool you. It's long because it's really the only breakfast place in the Bellagio. There's the patisserie which is run & go...& the Pool Cafe, which is outside (Which by the way is the exact same menu & foods for the most part).

We sat at the counter so we could be seated quicker. The two waitresses running the counter were so tired & had very little help, I just plain felt bad for them. Most my guilt melted away though when I 'd ask for something & they seemed bothered by it!

The omelette....I got lobster, it IS Vegas afterall. I think there was probably 6 pieces in all and the eggs were easily mass produced, the cheese had barely melted which makes me question the fat content. 
We ordered OJ, were shocked later that it was $7. NO OJ is WORTH $7! It's not like they were slaving away squeezing it by hand! 
I honestly enjoyed my toast most of all with all my little jelly jar choices along with my coffee, which was incredibly tough to get cream for.

I've been here when there is a line wrapped around the building (Saturday breakfast), but I've also been here when a party of four could walk up and get immediately seated, so it just depends on when you come. My recommendation is during the week during brunch time (around 10:00am) when there is no line.

The service is, for the most part, very quick to attend to your table, although the most recent trip saw several of our water glasses sitting empty for a majority of the time. Besides that, the food came out quick, and was hot, fresh, and delicious as always. My go-to breakfast/brunch items are omelettes and pancakes, and I have to say they have some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The ham and cheese omelette was very good, but the has browns were not the greatest due to being a little overcooked and too crispy. If you like it that way, then these are perfect for you.

Either way Café Bellagio has always been consistently great and above average which in my book is Four Stars. 

On my last visit, I met up with a High School friend who was visiting from San Francisco and decided Café Bellagio because it was 10:00 AM and not a lot of places are open at that time. We met each other there, hugged said the courteousy ""Oh my God! Hiiiii!"" and waited to be seated. We were promptly seated since there was only two of us and actually were seated before others who were there before us. They knew we were coming! Anyways, we sat chatted and decided on what we wanted.

I ordered the ""French 75"" cocktail because I was sure it was 5:00PM in Bellagio, Lake Como, Italy. I really don't think that that has ever stopped me from Day Drinking anyhow. I also ordered a coffee and my friend ordered a Coke. So I don't drink soda but if she can drink a Coke at 10:00 AM I can drink a French 75! It took quite awhile for our drink orders to come and they were taken before our food order was taken. I really wanted my French 75 probably more than my friend wanted her Coke. Our food came out about the same time as our food although I do remember my friend asking the server about her Coke when our food arrived. We weren't going to dink her on it because there was a separate beverage server and things do happen.

I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast with Berries. I opted out of the strawberries so my French Toast was topped with raspberries and blueberries. I also ordered a side of sausages because I do like a bit of saltiness to counteract the sweet carb-induced French Toast topped with berries- no strawberries. The French Toast was really not what I expected, I think it's just that when I thin of Cinamon Roll French Toast I remember a time in Utah where I had actual Cinnamon rolls made into French Toast. This version at Café Bellagio was good with enough butter and syrup poured on. The sausages, well they were sausages- I don't know- they were sausages.

Service was definitely 5 stars.  William was personable and extremely professional.  He definitely upholds the swanky Bellagio name.

I ordered the Tuscan chicken sandwich, which is wildly overpriced for what you get.  You get pieces/medallions of chicken (some cooked perfectly, some a little dry), not an entire chicken breast.  The ciabatta was fine, the pesto was tasty, and there was a massive amount of greens on the sandwich.

The French fries were extremely tasty, and the serving size was very generous.  They seems to be bartered, and were served piping hot.  These were actually the freshest (hottest) fries/potatoes I had this entire trip, including fries at Michael Mina Pub and Bouchon, and the hash browns at Tom's Urban.  When I asked for extra ketchup I was provided with more than enough.  The fries truly made the meal.

The cafe borders the conservatory, but it was all very dimly lit that late in the evening.  It was quite calm, unlike the usual ""crowded with tourists"" energy of Bellagio, which made it relaxing.  The carpeted and fabric-covered atmosphere was a little bit ""fancy cafeteria"" like  (fancy 90's Luby's).

Eating the entire huge plate of French fries had me take half the sandwich as leftovers for the drive home (Signature at MGM had a fridge, and I had a cooler).  William boxed it up very nicely, provided me with a set of plastic utensils, and packaged it in a nice plastic Bellagio-logo bag.

Service and the French fries bring the cafe to a 3.5, but I'm going to round down due to the utter disappointment of the expensive chicken sandwich.",mvq6mTZBd3mdDg_bZRWiuQ,0,0,3,JsZ833X6f5VFj5hI6pqh-A

The Greek salad - I am forever on a quest to find a great Greek salad, and while it is good here, IMHO it is missing the Greek Pepperoncini's and the prosciutto stuffed red cherry pepper.  

The corned beef hash - terrific breakfast choice, poached eggs on a bed of corned beef hash - ask for some hot sauce if you want to liven it up a little bit.

The Fish & Chips - Fried Cod and French fries served in a basket with newspaper lining.  It may not be haddock but it's still pretty darn tasty!

Speaking of prices they are pretty much out of control at this restaurant... $8 for a side of fench fries, $18 for a cobb salad, $13 for some chicken tenders?? Where are the late night deals? Most 24 hour cafes have spotty service but the food is cheaper and more varied. This place had high prices and service was lacking.

At abt 3am..when the club lets out one would think mgmt would staff correctly. Having only two servers take care of 10 tables each is just bad customer service.

I don't personally find the decor disjointed. Yes, it feels oldish which clashes with the upscale attempts, but whatever. It was clean and homely, to me. I don't ask for much more from what I think is an attempt at an upscale diner.

We had lunch, breakfast, and dinner during a recent stay.

Our first visit was while we were waiting for our room to be readied.  Because we had an early dinner reservation, we just wanted to split a cheeseburger.  Our server didn't mind that we were sharing and even brought extra plates and condiments to make it easier.  That's a refreshing difference from places that resent sharing.

We went for breakfast the next morning.  I had an excellent omelet that was nicely prepared, and Robin had pancakes that she reported were about the best ever.  My toast was a little bit cold and the portion of hash browns was a little bit skimpy, but those are very minor drawbacks.

The next night we went for dinner, where I had fettuccine alfredo with shrimp, spinach, and tomatoes.  Wow!  $19 is pricey for something like that, but it was really tasty.",co_f4a3VaJFHnl9HkvpNdQ,1,0,4,5R9DycT5N1yyLvNv1PMDew

1614895,2017-12-26,2,JTFFtWy_chbsHTs95yD_2Q,"The Bellagio is a favorite of ours every time we visit Vegas (at least twice a year).  And every time we stay at the Bellagio, we frequent Cafe Bellagio.  Now, the food has always been amazing, even at Vegas prices.  What made me rate this 2 stars is that especially for Vegas (much like Disney properties), you expect the staff to be friendly and accommodating.  This very thing is hit or miss at Cafe Bellagio - everyone from the hostesses to the greeters to the wait staff.  The only staff members I can honestly say have been 100% amazing have been the bus (?) staff?  The ones who bring us our water, bread, deliver the food.  They are always so friendly and fast.

On many an occasion, we had a mail server who always rubs me the wrong way.  I wish I could remember his name.  The most recent time, though, on Christmas Night, we had Julie from Appleton, Wisconsin and she was great.  She was super fun and friendly.  Made us feel very welcome.  May I also add that in her absence, Ms. Destyn was extraordinary.  She is the definition of ""lead by example"".  I can only assume she was a supervisor/manager of some sort - dressed very professionally and was going around the restaurant to check on tables and make sure everything was in order.  When our server was MIA, she not only took my mom's extra food order but also cleared our table for us.  Ours was not the only table she did this for.  I witnessed her tend to others as well.  She is truly remarkable and Cafe Bellagio not only got it right when they hired her but is also very fortunate to have her on their staff.

The Cafe is what provides the room service, should you choose to take advantage.  It's located next to Michael Mina in what I tend to call the ""gallery"" or place where the seasonal decorations are on display where you must fight everyone who is busy taking selfies or otherwise.  If you are looking at the front desk, it is to the right.

We came here with a party if five at 10am in a Sunday.  We had about a 10 minute wait.  

Crab cake Benedict - 4 stars - egg was perfectly cooked! Crab cake was moist and flavorful.  Hollandaise was light and creamy.  I really liked this dish.  I substituted regular bacon for the canadian bacon.  next time i will ask for it to be extra crisp as it was a little under done for me.  Only thing this dish needed was toast or muffin on the side.

In general everyone enjoyed their meals.  My husband got the cafe Benedict and it was not nearly as good as the crab Benedict's.  my party got the banana foster (3.5 stars) and cornbeef and hash 3.5 star

Service was very slow.  3 stars. It took us 1/2 hour to get our food.  We only saw our waterless when she took our order, delivered our food and gave us the check.  No how are things, refill on water, etc.

Tips - 
If you have a party larger than four it is always good to let the hostess know as you will usually be seated quicker.

We were seated at about 10:50 right across from another couple that was seated at the same time. The couple across from us was greeted and had their order taken.

My boyfriend and I weren't so lucky. We waited, and waited, and waited. We couldn't even see a single server near by to get their attention. We didn't even have anyone bring us water. 

At 11:20 the people across from us received their food. I had an appointment to make so I asked the gentleman who gave them their food if he could take our order. I told him we'd been waiting a long time. He said he'd find our server.

He came back a couple minutes later to take our order himself (which I appreciate) only to be interrupted by the woman who was supposed to be our server. We were finally able to order.

Our food arrived at 11:35 was a decent speed (but I had to leave at 11:50 so I still had to feel rushed when really we had allowed what should have been plenty of time.

The rest of the omlette was okay.

Food:
I ordered lox and a bagel. Can't screw that up, but I will say that the bagel was small and they only gave my three rings of onion - not even a full slice of an onion! That lox and bagel was NOT worth $15. The cream cheese portion was not much...maybe a tablespoon. The tomato slice was a regular beef steak, not vine ripened and the tomato was pill-y.

In the 4 meals I had there, I tried a selection of their menu.  The first morning both me and the wife had the bacon cheese omelet.  A pretty good omelet.  However, what they don't tell you is that it has broccoli in it.  In fact, there was probably more broccoli than bacon.  The family also got the fruit plate (excellent selection of pineapple, mango, papaya and berries! - even comes with banana bread!).  

Second day, I had the pulled pork sandwich.  Good, but not great.  Needed more sauce.  The wife had the cobb salad.  She loved it!   Nice gesture by the staff, for the mother-in-law's birthday, they brought her out a carrot cake with some kind of orange flan like topping.  I'm not a fan of carrot cake, but this was excellent!  

Third day, I had the eggs Benedict.  One of the best that I've had.  Not too much hollandaise sauce, so it was just right.  The wife had a BLT with avocado which she thought was excellent.

The wife had the eggs benedict on the 4th day and didn't like it as much - she didn't think the eggs were cooked well enough.  I had the southwestern omelet.  It was also so so... 

I would say that the meals are highly priced, but perfect size portions for an entire day.  We didn't have the urge to eat for a long time after each meal!

The guacamole was okay the salsa had a weird Smokiness to it and the salsa Verde was only okay. The chopped salad was alright but nothing to write home about.

In terms of food, I have to say that I have mixed emotions about it. The place was lacking in specialty. Nothing necessarily stood out to me here. My brother ordered the chicken tenders as an appetizer, however it tasted like any other chicken tender from any other location. $14 for a small portion of plain tenders? Not worth the value.

The Cobb salad portion was actually quite decent, enough for a very hungry person.

My mother and aunt complained about the shrimp scampi being very bland and sauceless. It's as if it wasn't seasoned at all, so they tried to salvage what they had with Parmesan, salt and pepper. Very poorly made in my opinion.I believe Italian franchise restaurants do a better job for half the price. The alfredo chicken fettuccine was good, very creamy. 

The branzino was very interesting. The fish was amazing, but the rice bed laid on was hard and dry. It's as if they took leftover rice pilaf and used that. 

I don't think this place is worth the money. You can definitely find better places. I essentially paid for aesthetics and convenience for the sake of eating at the Bellagio.

Edit: I recognize that the service was very good. I decided to give the establishment a fairer review. When my sister forgot to order a pasta dish, they made it very fast for her. So there's still something to offer here.",Qc97kKQEByADfKmlGVlgmQ,0,0,3,yPO9tGpYYlO9upPjg6JoQw

FOOD:
The food was FABULOUS (though we only tried two plates). 
- Seafood Linguine: Honestly one of the best linguine plates I've ever had. This was sooo flavorful. Scallops were a-plenty and the shrimps were HUGE and juicy!
- 8oz Filet Mignon: Cooked to perfection. Despite it being medium well (which was what we asked for), it was so tender, soft, and delicious!!! The vegetables were also at the perfect level of soft/crunch.

SERVICE:
We weren't greeted upon our arrival--instead, a server pointed to a table and left us with the menus...as if she hated us for coming in late (mind you it was about 11:30pm and they close at 1am). Our first waitress took our drink orders and never came back. Our second waitress came by as we were still deciding on what to eat. When asked what she recommends, the waitress shrugged it off and said,  ""everything here is good... I'll just come back later after you decide."" Thanks for your help. Another waitress came by and took our order. After we finished our (delicious) food, the same server dropped off the bill at our table, with nothing to be said. No thank you. No ""have a nice night."" Just the bill.

Now I know we were there for late night, and the staff probably wanted to go home & call it a day. I get it. But you advertise your restaurant as offering late night cuisine... And if it's not after hours yet, isn't it expected that you meet every customer with some kind of decent service?!

Overall, come here to eat great food -- but expect to be treated like you're unwanted customers of an apparently 5-star hotel if you walk in around 11:30pm on a Saturday night.",Fs0HDT0DA3maBBG4hs9qSg,1,1,3,K5--PKJl5MoQZy_EFZ4fnA

Okay, I might be describing it worse than it actually is. Check out the picture I posted and judge for yourself. The presentation was nice, but wasn't at all how I imagined it. I dug into the puff pastry hoping to find lobster, but it was just more...puff pastry. =[ Boy was I bummmmmmmed. If only all the peas and turkey bits were INSIDE of the puff pastry..it didn't even taste that great, hence the 2 stars. 

I won't come back unless I'm really hungry at night and everything else is closed-why? It's open 24/7.",W-La-8pnqIYBk2eyfoA4Gw,0,0,2,pkzlmBfwTdk9ENr4g2PyaQ

Lunch was outstanding, good service and great food.  I had the Wednesday daily special and it was delicious.  My wife had the chicken piccata and loved it enough to order it again the next night.

Dinner on Thursday night managed to knock off two starts.  We were seated quickly enough, the waiter came to take our drink orders and disappeared for a while.  The food finally arrived after a lengthy wait.  The waiter dropped it and ran.  I asked for another glass of wine that never arrived.  In fact we never saw our waiter again for over 45 minutes.  He never came back to check how the food was or to see if we needed anything else.  Never.  Finally we asked to see the manager who arrived 20 minutes later and listened to our complaints but really didn't seem interested in doing anything about it.  They offered to comp our drinks but the waiter never came back to take any drink orders (other than my glass of wine which never arrived) so that was a no go.

So the five of us left rather irritated with the poor service, this is the Bellagio after all!  On the upside the food we were served was outstanding, it just takes a while to be served and order your drinks early, they may never come.",yn3A7n0I7FGuanUnTWpX2w,0,0,3,cleOWOFKGYj5IY4EYjgMLQ

I don't regret the choice entirely, but my eggs benedict was standard (egg, ham, english muffin) and disappointing. I should have taken the waiters hint to order the crab benedict. To top it off, there was a hair on my plate when it was served. My espresso martini was the best part of my breakfast.

At 3pm, we experienced a waiter change. Our waiter politely informed us that we would have a new waiter, and pointed her out to us. We never saw her again until we found a manager to ask for our check.

Had bunch here with the 3 homies I roomed with at PH for our bro's bachelor party this past weekend.  Had to wait like 10 minutes in line by the garden to get seated.  Food seemed overpriced which is understandable since it is part of the Bellagio.  I got the braiche raspberry french toast with a side of 2 sunny side up eggs and bacon, green tea, and a cafe mojito for brunch.  Food was decently good.  Of course better than all those diner chains, but not like super great.

You can play Keno while eating too over here.  The Keno lady with her mini skirt, fishnet stockings, and stilettos comes around frequently to collect your gaming fees and pay you out your winnings.

Our total bill came out to around $130 for 4 people plus tip for brunch.  Good thing our friend treated us out since his parents were staying there that weekend too and get meals comped to their room.  Gotta love them Vegas comps, but you gotta hate getting suckered into losing them dollars on their tables to fuel your player's card.",v10dHdqf42tUkxbYVnFW6w,3,3,3,fdwzuDf13sig7p5gNWnmNg

The best way to eat it is with a fork and knife because the croissant is so airy and flakey and just full of deliciousness. One thing I loved was the portions were realistic. Most places you go to get breakfast put an obscene amount of food for one person. This plate came with hashbrows and the portion was good. I didn't get full from just looking at my plate. Delicious and the service of course was amazing! Only thing is the line to get in. Sooooo long. If you're a bellagio VIP you get to cut the line.

Located in the Bellagio Conservatory, the Cafe is a great place for breakfast and brunch. However since it's so legit, the line to get in forms very quickly. We got in line around 9:30 and had to wait around 20 minutes before we were seated. This wasn't too bad but the line was much longer by the time we left around 10:45 so get here early if you don't want to wait!

When you walk in the Cafe itself is very large, which is great because it allows you to be seated more quickly but it's also a disadvantage because the waitresses have to cover a greater number of tables. Our waitress was very nice but it was clear she was overwhelmed so it took her a bit to bring us drinks and other things we requested.

The food was fabulous!! I had the veggie omelette which came with toast, a baked tomato and hash browns. The egg was very fluffy and yummy but it was way too big for one person to finish. I'm usually not a fan of hash browns but these were crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside!! The toast was great and they brought me three mini containers of jam to choose from: I used the strawberry and took the rest home hehe =)

My dad ordered the bowl of fruit which had a nice selection of strawberries, melon, kiwi, berries and pineapple. Both my mom and boyfriend had the eggs benedict which they enjoyed, and my mom actually liked the hollandaise sauce which meant it must have been good!! 

All the food we tried was fresh and presented in a very beautiful and classy manner. I'd definitely recommend breakfast or brunch here at the Cafe Bellagio!!",UVs_7nPjqK_W_ap96IClpA,1,0,4,A2iBVDvtG3UZBLL454PK3A

2716072,2009-08-28,1,JTFFtWy_chbsHTs95yD_2Q,"Writing about Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn made me think of this place, my former leaving las vegas haunt. For years I couldn't leave the strip without stopping here for the shrimp and artichoke salad or the lobster omelet. Unfortunately while the restaurant still appears to be the same restaurant I knew and loved its actually quite different, at least my two favorite dishes were. The omelet that was once so perfect, so filled with lobster and asparagus, you couldn't take a bite without getting some had turned into a watery mess, with only a smidgen of lobster and something green that I suppose could have been asparagus, they tried to cover for the lack of lobster and asparagus by smothering it in cheese. The omelet had small pools of water and cheese oil floating around it. The salad was equally disappointing, the previous ones fresh cuts of artichoke heart had clearly been replaced with canned ones. The former salad was also loaded down with shrimp, in fact sometimes I thought it was to much shrimp, but it was grilled with a pesto sauce so perfectly that really how could I complain, besides who complains about two much shrimp? The ""bigger, better, newer salad"", had 3 shrimp, delicately placed on bland crouton. I thought maybe they just put those three on top for decoration, that once I removed the over sized crouton I would find my usual bevy of shrimp. I was wrong; $18.00 bucks for soggy arugula, 3 shrimp, and bitter canned artichokes.  

We tried to give the place the benefit of the doubt and visit one more time, sincerely hoping that we had just gone on an off day, unfortunately that was not the case, we found ourselves paying for a breakfast we didn't even want to finish, and then driving home grumpy about it. It was so bad the grandma in me was inspired to write a strongly worded email about the decline in quality. I was contacted by a manager, who in spite of her offer to ""buy us breakfast"" made it abundantly clear that not only had the standard of food quality gone down, the management at the place was also questionable. Even her in friendliness she was blatantly unprofessional and clearly had no idea what she was talking about, I had the distinct feeling I was talking to somebodies girlfriend who had been given the job as a favor.

Part of the whole dining experience was the pleasure of walking through the atrium at the Bellagio, this is the only reason I gave it an extra star, however to be honest, I can remember thinking, even the atrium looks cheaper and less thoughtful than usual. They say that when the Wynn opened Steve Wynn went back to the Bellagio to hire all his former employees for the new place, I actually believe this.",CKHRhKZobmNBfUvlzxNqgg,2,1,2,xUOwVj8lxAQjc3TYtyQ2iw

Tasty chunks of lobster, crisp fresh asparagus, and creamy brie made for a divine eye opener.  As I have become a coffee snob, I had no complaints with the java served. I thoroughly enjoyed my time.

I repeated trips to Las Vegas in the next year but finally, 12 months to the day, returned to Bellagio for the glorious omelette. Michelle was still there and remembered me by name!

I explained that thsi was not the same omelette i ordered a year ago. He questioned me, and I immediately asked for Michelle. She confirmed it was not the same omelette, and the chef decided to substitute Boursin for my beloved Brie. She went to the kitchen, returned and advised me that they had no more brie. She also said that if I came back the next morning, she would insure that I got my omelette the way I liked it, and to consider breakfast comped. Disappointed, I ordered a pouched egg with toast, and promised to come back as it would be my birthday. 

I came back the next day, Michelle seated me at a great table by the window, brought me a Mimosa, and toasted me Happy Birthday. She advised me that my omelette was in the works.

So perfect, buttery, warm and soft... I want them now just thinking about them. Every time I go to Vegas it's a must stop destination for me.

I have tried other things and taken a lot of friends there as well and everyone is a fan.

The peach belini is like a peach and champagne icee. Sandwiches are towers of meat, salads are massive bowls of deliciousness, and almost everything is perfection.

Second, our waitress was great when she did come to our table but she didn't come enough.  We always had to look for her and request things.  Third, the meals we had were so-so and nothng special.  It was overpriced for what we got.  Fourth, it took way to long to have our food cooked and brought to our table when half the restaurant was empty.

Overall, this place we nothing special and I wouldn't come back if I had a choice.  I did have a early dinner with my friends around 6:00 PM on a Saturday so maybe that might of affected the experience.  Who knows?",FL59itHfuewYgzOhdAgkwQ,0,1,3,tImLJt7x8qIgbQWlUvr7rg

The service I received last weekend was awful. Friends and I had ordered two entrees (both came with order of toast). But our waiter only brought one order of toast and never refilled our waters or asked us how our meal was. Thus we never had chance to ask about our missing toast.

The prices are reasonable, and the menu has a variety of options.  If you get to stay at the Bellagio, this also serves as your sole delivery option.

One night a few years back, I'd complained about some construction they were doing eight floors above us.  They gave me a free meal on the house.  I asked them if room service counted.  They said sure.  I invited all of my friends over for a several hundred dollar feast.   Pancakes, french toast, eggs benedict, waffles, you name it, it's good stuff.  The only thing that was seriously a joke was the congee, but the truth was, it wasn't disappointing cause we weren't expecting it to be any good.  We just ordered it cause we could.

This is also a great place to go for the after hour munchies.  My girlfriend loves the apple crumble here, it's served a la mode.  Simply delicious.

3020047,2012-07-30,0,JTFFtWy_chbsHTs95yD_2Q,"Cafe Bellagio has become one of our ""must-visit"" restaurants every time we visit Vegas.  It isn't inexpensive, but if you order carefully you'll have an excellent meal at a reasonable price (considering it's in the Bellagio indoor-garden).

We always get the appetizer chicken tenders ($11).  They are amazingly filling and incredibly tasty.  My kids discovered them, but now we all order them!  Frankly, I can't see how someone could order the tenders for an appetizer and still have room for a meal.  They're served with fresh skewers of carrot and celery, with ranch dressing.  They're obviously hand-breaded, and freshly fried to a delicious crisp.  I'm not ordinarily a fan of chicken tenders (or strips, or whatever a given restaurant may call them), but now we end up here two or three times on each trip to Vegas!  

I'll agree with the other reviewers who noted that much of the menu is fairly expensive.  A few examples are Arnold Palmer's for $5.50, sodas are $4.50, fish and chips is $18, and the steak was somewhere in the neighborhood of $35 (though my picky daughter reports that it's one of the few steaks of which she'll eat every bite).  Still, you're not going to find anything much less expensive in a major casino on-strip with great atmosphere.

Ask for a table that borders the garden, and you'll find the atmosphere much more magical than sitting buried deeply inside of the restaurant.  Try the chicken tenders for a somewhat affordable but delicious meal.",jOC2NByENxWmjivMcLuW6w,0,0,5,GGjxwSNqzR9c6zt-KuwZSw

First time was after watching the 10pm show ""O"", so my boyfriend and I was there around 1am. We told them we wanted it to go because we were tired and didnt want to sit there to eat (rather go back up and eat in bed), so they sent us to the bar and we ordered there. The service was decent but still a bit slow, the bartender came and asked us what we wanted but we didnt know yet, so he left and didnt come back for a while.  The food took about 10-15 minutes. The prices are a bit ridiculous though(not the food but the add ons)... my boyfriend ordered a Bacon BBQ burger and wanted jalapenos... which cost an extra $2. He also wanted Parmesan on the cheese, which was an extra $3, and they just sprinkled a bit on it.... The to go soda was $4.50, we should have just got the soda from the Bellagio vending machines which were only $3 AND it fills up that to go cup Twice. But the food was really good. I got the buffalo wings and they really really good, it had a lot of flavor to it and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The fries were good too, if only they put more cheese on it. My boyfriend loved the burger and loved the jalapenos because it was really really spicy. 

The second time we came here was the next day around noon. We got seated pretty fast even though there was a line. But after our waitress took down what we wanted to drink, it went downhill... our waitress completely disappeared and another waitress had to come and ask us what drinks we ordered. After we got our ice tea, no one came to our table for a good 15-20 minutes. So I asked another waitress that we are ready to order and she just went back to setting up another table. After 5 more minutes, one of the hostess/server (don't know what she was, but she was not in waitress outfit) came and apologized and took our order (this was after I said ""the food here is good but the service sucks"" out loud, and the hostess/server probably heard because the computer that they enter stuff into was right next to us)

We finally got to order and we got some really delicious dinner rolls with butter. And we had a good time for the rest of the meal. My boyfriend had the Spaghetti Bolognese and I had the Bellagio Penne. Didnt really like my penne because the tomatoes made it a bit sour and I didnt want that so early in the morning, but my boyfriend liked it so he traded me. The spaghetti bolognese was very yummy... too bad I was stuffed with bread... I couldnt finish it...

I guess the waitress/server knew they messed up because they gave us our ice tea for free at the end.

The food here is really good, the pricing for the food is reasonable but not the add ons. the service slow, so if you are in a hurry then dont come here.

It was cooked fine, but the cut was just horrendous. Maybe I'm spoiled with steak since I've eaten at most of Vegas' steakhouses, but the filet at Cafe Bellagio was just plain ol' bad.

And while it's probably slightly more expensive than some of its peers, it is probably the best 24-hour resort dining spot in the city.

When I'm there for breakfast I tend to do my own mixing and matching so that I can get pancakes, eggs, and some bacon or sausage on the side.  Admittedly, this is very ""Denny's"" of me, but I'm always surprised there isn't a pancakes and eggs combination on the menu.  I've also been pretty happy with the Eggs Benedict.  I am less of a fan of the Corned Beef Hash, but I've also yet to find a restaurant that makes a solid version of that dish.

I would probably pass on the TIger Shrimp Cocktail unless you were really jonesing to satisfy your shrimp cocktail fix.  It consists of four or five large--but not especially or monstrously large--shrimp and the requisite cocktail sauce.  Of the entrees, I really like the Spaghetti Bolognese and was also pleasantly surprised when I took the server's advice and got the Sauteed Tiger Prawns (no, it wasn't with the shrimp cocktail).  On the latter dish, the garlic cream sauce went very well with the aromatic rice.

Above all, what I really like about Cafe Bellagio are the iced-tea ice cubes for the iced tea to prevent your drink from diluting as the iced cubes melt.  Once upon a time, I think they also offered a liquid sweetener for iced tea, but I haven't seen that on my recent trips.

Service is pretty standard.  Usually the cafe is adequately staffed, but if you happen to be dining at an odd hour (like 4am, for instance) and it is a little bit busier than normal, things can take a lot longer.

Food: our party tried the burger, Thai salad, steak, fish and chips, penne, and fettuccine alfredo. All were lukewarm, not seasoned, tasted stale, and were overpriced. Biggest reason for 1 star is the food quality.

Service: our table was handled by two employees, a waitress who appeared perturbed by requests for drinks and basic service, and a more professional gentleman who was a little eccentric. Biggest issue was wait time.

Atmosphere: for a place with a nice view, the atmosphere is an unfortunate mixture of bingo parlor and empty ballroom.

Now the food...
I had the onion soup. It came with this thick layer of cheese and a soggy crustini inside. Now for most soups I thought it came with a crustini on top.

My husband had the turkey club which was exactly that a plain dry turkey club.

My friends had dessert. One the creme brule the other had the frozen tiramisu.

Creme brule was average.
Tiramisu was served in oversized coffe cup with whip cream and chocolate chips on top. It was ok, I wont go back for it. Chocolate chips were definitely not needed.",p_QErki4bI6Ni598P0QX9A,0,0,3,crNBQjsO02QM6R3Fr7Vihg

On that scale alone, I think it's a pretty good deal. The prices are higher (but it's Vegas, what do you expect) but I think the portions are a very good size.

The Atlantic Salmon was alright. However, I think the Bellini (?) drink was delicious! For someone with such a low tolerance, I can honestly say I thought it was very tasty (not good for you hardcore alcoholics)

What impressed me the most about this place was their attention to detail. I ordered an iced tea and I noticed that my ice cubes were discolored.

Having gone hard the night before, a group of friends and I were looking to eat something a bit healthier . 
Walking around The Bellagio Hotel, we stumbled upon this cafe.
Located just next to a nice & airy indoor-garden...this place is a great change of pace from the shadowy casino halls we'd been walking around earlier.
A harp was the soundtrack playing in the garden and it echoed throughout. 
Cafe Bellagio's seating area. 
With an open seating plan provided views of fresh flowers and sunlight teeming through a glass roof next door.
Just what the doctor ordered. 
We all went with salad to try and stave away the booze soaked night we'd just endured.
Specifically, I went with a classic Cobb. 
Good choice.
Heaping mounds of egg, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles as well as half of an avocado and a grilled chicken breast on top of fresh greens--this salad delivered.
It was a very large portion, so big in fact that I gave half to my buddy who stumbled in after losing his shirt at the roulette wheel.
Friends ordered the Greek Salad, which also seemed to be a hit.
Our server, Neal, was a consummate professional.
The kind of waiter that seems to oblige your every need and anticipate what you will ask for next, without hovering over you uncomfortably.
My meal came to just under $20 which is a deal for the charming view and service.

My friend ordered the french toast which looked absolutely amazing too! She ordered a large glass of orange juice (which was pricey @ $7).

For starters, we ordered chips & salsa. Chips were fresh & warm out of the oven. Guacamole was thick & flavorful, along with the salsa verde & a red sauce. 

For dinner, I ordered the Bellagio's Penne Marinara creme penne. The shrimp was juicy & plentiful. The penne was cooked al dente. The sauce was good; it had a similar taste to what we call ""fat free"" if you catch my drift... 
Not the same deep, thick flavor as Mama makes it, but regardless, it was good. 

I also ordered a Pomegranate Cherry Martini that was a perfect mix of sweet fruity flavor & hint of alcohol. 

Overall experience was nice (despite the strange choice that maintenance took to having a huge bobcat machine in the foyer, Where the garden is, separate from the cafe but right outside where we can hear & see- cleaning the ceiling at 11pm at night). 

I rate the food 4 stars, drinks 4.5 and the decor/ambiance & service were 5 stars.

The setting's nice, most certainly, but for 3 persons to have breakfast here and the bill to come to $90, tax and tip included, you better be wowing me with your omelets, Chef.

At $16, you gotta do better than that.... Way better than that!   Now my wife's Spanish Chorizo breakfast was better, but I'd still only give that 4 stars.

They make a kickass coffee, though, laced with something like Cocaine or Speed...  My wife was bouncing off the walls for the next 8 hours, which was quite entertaining, actually!

3803092,2010-01-17,0,JTFFtWy_chbsHTs95yD_2Q,"Having been to Vegas on numerous (work) occassions, I have come to realize that each hotel has their kind of go to breakfast spot for its guest.  Cafe Bellagio seemed to be it for that sit-down breakfast dining feel, and one can definitely tell based on the line through the garden and the wait.

First, it was hard to find because the Garden was under construction, but the line should have clued us in.  It was pretty early in the morning, and the line was there.  Despite our apparent hunger, the line went pretty quickly though...let's say about 20-30 minutes waiting.

We were promptly seated and actually saw a better table and requested that instead.  The host was gracious enough to accommodate our split second decision.  Our hostess was nice, and I guess at one point during the service she was either done or had a break scheduled, so she introduced us to the new server who would assist with the rest of our meal.

It took us a while to figure out what we wanted, because in this place you couldn't just get a meal that included bacon, eggs, and pancakes (formerly known as a Denny's Grand Slam breakfast).  But once we were ready (one omelet and one corn beef hash plate), we still had to wait for the server to return.

Sigh, stomach growling.

The food came and all was well with our hunger.  I particularly found the toast perhaps the most memorable part of the meal, but did enjoy my corn beef hash.

Sadly, my overall experience here at Cafe Bellagio could have been better, but it wasn't.  It was average for me, and the waiting time to actually place our orders just pushed the review a little lower than that.  Another clincher for the lower score....2 orders of orange juice (that's 2 glasses) was the equivalent price of 1 of the entrees.",LZPtLWnjGZVODlhZk_uPdg,0,0,2,03FcMpTIdh-XgEtEdFNiDA

The stupidity was that I was in Vegas and I thought must of been dreaming that I was down the Old Kent Road. I got round bits of reconstituted ham that they call Canadian Bacon, oddly, since its neither Canadian nor bacon, and furthermore quite possibly doesn't even come from a pig.  Maybe the Bellagio financed that recently announced stem cell research where they grew white meat and had to add colouring for the tasting.  All the journo's hated it.

The sausages were anaemic looking white things that the waiter told me was a mixture of sausage meat and turkey meat.  The menu called them bangers.  Now any self-respecting Brit knows what a banger is and this certainly wasn't one.  I think they might have been made from the scraps from the meat factory floor, which of course bangers are, but at least they're the right sort of scraps.

I chose fried eggs because then at least you can see 3 separate eggs rather than have an omelette made from a 100 gallon drum of eggs which is how many of these industrial kitchens buy their eggs (BTW Michael Pollan told me that).  Unfortunately these eggs were so under done that that I could hardly eat them.

From this point on things got much better.  My waiter, Anando, saw my forlorn expression and offered to change it after I'd done my best to eat a little - my mother never let us reject anything on the plate.  We swapped it for an omelette, which was ok'ish but he also went off in serach of numerous expressi for me - there machine was down.

THEN my friend finally gets the omelet - and its full of cheese.  she has to send it back as she is lactose intolerant.  about 15 mins later (note: i have completely finished MY sandwich at this point) she gets a new omelet - IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT.

Smoked salmon w bagel - The smoked salmon was OK but not great.. not the best quality and a teeny bit slimy. Came w cream cheese, onions and capers.


Service was OK. There was no need for refills since a huge coffee thermos that is filled is placed right on the table.",fk0U1yLy8woJ87LpIkgU4g,0,0,2,t1e-KLOhKAKGia_AFOk3RA

If you opt to sit at the counter you don't have to wait in line, assuming there's room of course.  To be honest the waitress wasn't all that friendly and my friend and I are not high maintenance customers in the least bit.  We decided not to let her bother us and wanted to enjoy our meal so we paid very little attention to her.  I should have rewarded her bad disposition with a 15% tip instead of a 20% tip, but I hate being a dick.

The food was excellent! I'm not sure why, but I really wasn't expecting much.  Figured we'd get an average meal.  Like with everything in Vegas, the portion sizes were huge.  My friend ordered the Turkey Club and couldn't finish it, which was good because we needed to bring lunch back for her husband.  She wasn't fond of the cole slaw - she said there was an herb that was overpowering the taste (we think it was the celery seed).  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Sandwich and it was soooooo good!  Marinated grilled chicken with lettuce, tomatoes, roasted yellow peppers, and a pesto sauce all on ciabatta bread.  The only thing that was missing was a good pickle! Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals too.  

The food was a little pricy, but you're in Vegas and it is what it is.  But the portions were large so maybe it all evened out.

This shabby 'diner' I should call it, is open 24 hours which is the only reason I came here, since most restaurants are not open around 1:30 am.  The decor of Cafe Bellagio was as if Hollywood spruced up an IHOP!  It was totally dated from the underdone upholstered chairs, to the faux marble gating separating the diners from the tourists which seemed to come from a cheap soap opera set. 

THE STAFF - 

Our first server was horrible, she was completely confused on the menu.  I asked her politely if I could have a virgin Bella peach, which she confusingly replied with a ""No, all of the drinks are PREMADE, so alcohol is already in there"", which perplexed me; so - I ordered a water instead -out of distaste for their alcoholic menu.  Our waitress then said she will order it anyways after I told her I only wanted water.  It had passed over 20 minutes, and no drinks were flying out, I was ready to walk out and find a different restaurant, but our waitress ran out and yelled at me to sit down, because my drinks were coming.  Does water take that long?  Minutes later, our drinks come out, and the drink I did not order came as well.

We had to get a second waiter, which made our meal much more enjoyable.

THE FOOD -

I indeed got to order my Bella peach but after waiting that long, my drink still wasn't Virgin, but it was delicious, although, it was literally filled to the top with ice, and trickled with a splash of juice and vodka, if I recall, it was $14 for that?!

For appetizers, I ordered their French onion soup which had a toasted baguette and melted Gruyere cheese which was delicious, but my photos would say otherwise, unfortunately the easy soup was over-seasoned, although I did enjoy the caramelized onions.

For my main course, I ordered their Shrimp scampi which could have been better.  The heirloom tomato's were watery and lacked flavor, the shrimps tasted like the bad shrimps at the bottom of the containers at Red Lobster, and to top it off, the Basmati rice was completely stale,  Disgusting.


The meal was memorable, but for all the wrong reasons.  

P.S.  The only reason this place didn't receive 1 star, was because our second waiter was super sweet and cordial.",1orfwtwIaqCbLgfs3W1i6Q,15,12,2,eA-oEzui5F0JF5hvclI02Q

We stood in line for 15 minutes just to get a table but once inside there were lots of empty tables.  Ambiance nice, view of the conservatory was easy to see, friendly service, prompt drink order then it stops there. 

I saw the problems when customers who were there before us were already eating their meals and we had not even had our order taken!   The bread basket was not brought out until the meal came.   She apologized and threw in some french fries with the chicken fingers basket (there's no kids menu either).  My other kiddo ordered the chicken soup, which I also do not recommend. I have made plenty of homemade soups and have opened lots of cans of soup too and believe me this version tastes like it came out of a can.  My hubby ordered a boring crab avocado salad. He liked it.

Their version of a Bellini is throwing in chemical tasting ""champagne"" (if there was any in there to begin with) in with some orange colored concoction. Also not recommended. Seriously, I only saw the words ""Bellini"" on the menu I never imagined that I would get a blended drink? WTH?

I had a chicken quesadilla and I really loved the taste but they were tight with the Pico, Guacamole and Sour cream.  The worse part was I had a horrible stomach ache after I left!  Not sure if it was the Bellini or quesadilla?

I've been coming to Cafe Bellagio for about three years now. It is convenient because it is open 24 hours. I usually order my chicken noodle soup to go and eat it in the room.  This past Tuesday, I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to go and asked the waiter if I can have a cup of water while I was waiting since it usually takes 15 minutes during  the late night hours. I signed the bill to my room and left zero tip since I was taking it to go. The waiter, an older white male with long, grey curly hair, looked at the bill, aggressively proclaimed, ""Really?

It is rare for me to get a chance to do this, so I ate eggs benedict all 3 mornings. Well seasoned hollandaise (allthough I always add extra lemon juice whenever I eat eggs benedict at a restaurant), perfectly poached eggs and thick pieces of canadian bacon. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meals every day. Our coffee mugs were never empty and the fresh squeezed OJ truly tasted fresh. However, the last morning we were there, we found mold on the supposedly fresh raspberries and I was served a dirty water glass. It put a serious damper on our breakfast. Otherwise, the menu selection was great. Just like Village Inn or Denny's, this place is open 24 hours a day and serves breakfast, lunch & dinner all day long. The tandori chicken pitas were pretty darn good too! Prices seemed to range from $14 per plate and above. A little pricey for what is served, but it seemed that way with everywhere in Vegas.

I ordered the special for the day, which was Lobster Mac and Cheese (~$22) and a cup of their Clam Chowder. My friend ordered the Bellagio Classic Omelet ($19) and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip ($11). We started off with my soup, which was full of flavor and chunks of clams. It was definitely what I needed after a night of drinking in Vegas. The cup was the perfect size in addition to my dish to come. After I was done, the rest of the food came together. The dip was presented on a wooden board and crispy, toasted baguettes. It was a great choice for appetizer. As for my mac and cheese, it also came with a side salad which was a nice surprise for me. The mac and cheese was good, but I found too much sundried tomatoes for me taste. It was good still, but I was stuffed and asked to take it to-go. The waiter misheard and thought I said I didn't like it. He was incredibly sweet to take our concerns so quickly, but there was nothing wrong at all.

We ordered the crab cake salad ($18) and the BLT ($14) a few beers, and...a $12 Bloody Mary. I have to say, it was a delicious Bloody Mary, complete with spicy homemade mix, lemon, olives, picked green beans, and celery, but for $12 they should have served it in the form of a miniature replica of the Bellagio water fountain, but with Bloody Mary contents instead for me to sip from...with music.

They had a few beers on tap of those a chose the Goose Island as that's a great brewery with delicious glass of brew!

Their chicken salad sandwich just sounded right and it was! The sandwich had a good amount of flavorful chicken with the right sprinkle of pepper on a yummy roll w/ a juicy tomato that went well with the crisp lettuce.

The sandwich also came with fries they had this crispy awesomeness to them that rocked!

The restaurant has great views with the Conservatory on one side and their pool viewable through the large windows on the other side. It's also open 24/7!

I chose the Bellagio Classic Omelet ($18) with Maine lobster, asparagus, mozzarella, roasted tomato, and hash browns. The omelet was beautiful! Fluffy and perfect with ample amount of lobster, uniform chops of asparagus, and gooey mozzarella. The roasted tomato, although rather small for the amount of omelet, was succulent and left me wanting more. The hash browns were a surprising delight. If I had a choice, hash browns are the last form of potato I'd order because of its usual terrible preparation of undercooked, dry potato shreds under the crunchy exterior of flattop cooking or simply missing the crispy texture. These hash browns were extraordinary. The amazing crunch on the outside and the potatoes on the inside were moist and cooked perfectly. There was an addition of chopped parsley that made these the best hash browns I've ever had. If everyone made hash browns like this, I might actually order them!

Obviously you are overpaying for everything $4.50 for bottomless cup of coffee $5.00 for a Juice but if you're a hotel guest it gives you what you need. 

Food is always good with in my opinion the Eggs Benedict and Corn Beef Hash with poached eggs being their breakfast bests.  Fruit is always fresh and an option instead of their hash browns and basket of Sour Dough or white or wheat large thick slices of toast and whipped butter always a nice accoutrement. 

If I had one complaint it would be the toast is always cold and I Mean always and the servers are good at what they do, but there are not enough of them at breakfast time, they always seem to be running around like chickens with their head cut off.

Anyway - the host/seating area needs some work as those ladies seem to do a lot of standing around, milling about, and not actually seating anyone in an efficient way. That said, once you've got a table things go quickly. 

I had a few meals here and here's how it broke down:

Chicken fingers - hit. Don't judge me, I just needed a snack, okay? Their tenders are plenty good, and were served piping hot in a cute dryer basket. 

Cobb salad - miss. This was barely ok - the lettuce was limp shredded iceburg and none if the toppings tasted fresh. And they were miserly on the avocado. 

French dip - hit. Not at all gristly, and served with a garlicky au jus that wasn't too salty, their French Dip is really good. And so are their fries which are the crispy battered kind.

4958030,2014-08-12,0,JTFFtWy_chbsHTs95yD_2Q,"Café Bellagio is the requisite 24 hour coffee shop joint that all casinos must have.  Because it's in the Bellagio, it's more expensive than a lot of the 24 hour coffee shop places.  But, the food is also above average for coffee shops, so there's that.  

This place is large.  Very large.  Some tables have a nice view, but the majority of the place is you just see other diners, or the atrium from which you just came.  The lines can be VERY long during high traffic times.  To be honest, if you don't have a line pass or can't skip the line for another reason (your MLife card is gold or higher or you gamble a lot) I would probably order room service and just stay upstairs in the comfy bed.  Or, I'd rather spend the time walking to somewhere else to eat.  If I ever waited an hour for this place, I would be very disappointed.  But, if you can get right in, or just really want to eat here, you can get a good meal.

I've eaten here for breakfast and late night.  Everything I've had is good, but it's not ridiculously good.  My favorite breakfast is probably the sausage and peppers omelet.  It's a good size omelet, and the ingredients are quality.  The breakfast potatoes are good, and the breakfasts are served with a roasted tomato topped with bread crumbs.  I've also had the French toast a couple of times, and it's solid. 

For lunch/dinner, one of my favorites is the short rib dip, with caramelized onions, tomatoes, provolone cheese, and a fantastic jus for dipping.  It's a large but messy sandwich, you'll probably need to finish it with a knife and fork.   The burgers are also good, but there are so many burger places on the strip that are better, so I certainly wouldn't wait in this line for a burger.  

Service is good, but at high traffic times you won't see your server very often.  That is fine for drink refills, because there are a lot of other wait staff running around.  But, you may have to wait to order or for your check during busier times.  I think this place is so busy because there aren't a ton of cheaper dining options at Bellagio.

Customer Service: First, it took the waiter about 20 minutes to come to our table... Even after we flagged down someone. Then, our waiter proceeded to get in an argument with another customer... Right in front of us. Awkward is not nearly a strong enough word to describe the atmosphere. 

Food: Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Almost as bad as the service. I ordered the steak and eggs, and my boyfriend got the penne. The steak was not seasoned. At all. My eggs were overcooked (seriously though.... Who messes up on scrambled eggs?!?!?!). Hash browns were soggy. The penne sauce was mediocre, and somehow my boyfriend got fettuccine and spaghetti mixed in. What. The. Eff.

It's a sit-down restaurant open 24 hours a day, pleasant, open atmosphere with nice views of the conservatory and the outdoors. the food is good, so is the service, and the prices are pretty good even considering it's Vegas and the Bellagio. We enjoyed four breakfasts during our stay, and each was very good, tasty and consistently so. What's not to like about that? The breakfast sandwich is actually two biscuits, each stuffed with cheese, crispy bacon and a fried egg. And if that isn't enough, they add some hash browns. It's $17 and is guaranteed to fill you up. For $16 you get three big pancakes; for $15 we also liked the poached eggs with homemade corned beef hash that was just spicy enough. Strong coffee and lots of it adds up to a happy meal for us. 

Our other meals were no less pleasing, including a holiday turkey dinner with all the trimmings ($32). The servers were unfailingly courteous and efficient in spite of very big crowds. The Cafe has a good vibe, in our opinion, and it takes much less time to dine here than to wait in an endless line for the hotel buffet. By the way, alcoholic beverages are also available, of course. A Bloody Mary with breakfast is always a good idea.

There are some outstanding restaurants in the Bellagio (like Prime, for instance), but the chances are you won't dine there three or four nights in succession. So we'd suggest you be sure to stop by here.",Rn7g5XZpT-_DKE8MkB4Ezg,3,1,4,m-0QTGBM1sJ50bE4gWv7Ww

I've had some good breakfasts around this town over the many years that I've been coming here but none finer than the 'Classic Omelette' at the Cafe Bellagio. Overlooking the iconic Observatory and Botanical Gardens with its myriad of fresh flowers and larger-than-life sculptures, the Cafe Bellagio offers a bit of refuge from the madness outside on the Strip. 

The 'Classic' is stuffed with generous chunks of Maine Lobster, Asparagus, Tomatoes and Mozarella Cheese. I always compliment this omelette with the Sour Dough toast with the mini jars of Orange Marmalade. The omelette also comes with half of a baked tomato and hash browns. 

For me, lobster in the morning with a hot cup of Joe is as good as it gets. The Bellagio's Lobster Omelette is, in my mind, second only to the Lobster Omelette served at Key West's Blue Heaven. 

I will say, however, that the service at the Cafe had slipped a bit during this visit...not by the servers who are consistently excellent as they address guests by name. The service by both of the CAFE's hostesses was terrible leaving patrons waiting more than 10 minutes behind the velvet rope while dozens of tables were wide open...not acceptable for a place with Bellagio's rep.

Then we waited. 

And waited. 

And waited. 

And watched groups that had been seated after us served. We had just decided to walk out (It's something which I have NEVER done, but the lack of service was getting to be down right offensive) when our food came out. It was mediocre at best, except for the French Fries and the water. It was also very expensive! I paid around $15 for a greasy, bland chicken quesadilla.

Once for breakfast and then again for dinner. It was delicious both times. The portions are very generous and the price is just right for the atmosphere, taste of dishes, and the service. We had a very short wait for breakfast and ended up opting to sit at the bar because they had open seating and we were starving. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious. I've gotten an omelet here before that was great. This time I got the eggs Benedict which was all very good! It comes with hash browns. I liked that I didn't have to choose how I wanted to the egg. They just cooked it to perfection, runny on the inside but the white was cooked throughly which I enjoy. I hate it when I get runny whites in my eggs Benedict. They did it perfectly! The flavor was great. We proceeded on with our day after breakfast and came back later for dinner before seeing ""O"" at the Bellagio. I was looking for a restaurant in the hotel but nothing looked as good to me as going back to Cafe Bellagio!! They have a very good house blend coffee. We actually had the coffee with dinner because we were tired already and our show wasn't until 10pm. Our server, Fernando F., was excellent. I wanted some mixed fruit and a salad for dinner. I ordered the oriental chicken salad, it was amazing!! It was also huge though so the boyfriend and I should have shared it! He got the applewood cobb salad, which was also huge. He said it was good as well. For the fruit, I was going to order a fruit cup but when I asked the waiter how big it was he said it was a little small. He recommended a fruit bowl which was bigger and had a bigger variety of fruit in it. Everything in it was so fresh and ripe just to perfection! It was just what I was looking for as a lighter dinner option. They bring you a basket of bread with dinner. I always get ice water too. It's nice and refreshing in Vegas when it's 1000 degrees out!

But if you don't mind paying $15.00 for Eggs Benedict with a great view of the garden, then this is definitely the place.  The way it's laid out feels like a Fine Dining restaurant.  Normally a cafe looks like a regular average restaurant.  The look of this tops them all.  The tables were laid out with long off white table clothes decorated with gold silverware.  There are even nice water glasses that almost looks like they want to serve you wine with it.  The lighting has a brightness to it but not overpowering.  Plus the view of the garden has a romantic feel to it that makes you want to go there on a date.  But, you know it's not really a date place because Cafe's are normally a hangover joint.

Since I got there late, I ordered my food as they were finishing up.  My cousins and their friends were already complaining about the service.  I guess the lady didn't come back to see if they were alright and didn't take the plates when they were done.  To me, that's not a big deal but I guess everyone's different.  

My cousin has never eaten Eggs Benedict, and loved it after tasting my order.  She ordered the Tuna Salad Sandwich but wasn't impressed with it.  The chicken salad looks mediocre - nothing special looking about it.  

So, overall it's an average Cafe masked to look like a Fine Dining Restaurant.  Food and Service was just like any other Cafe - average.  But, you know what?

Their non-alcoholic smoothies were DELICIOUS, and the crab eggs benedict was excellent. I really don't have any bones to pick with the meal, except for the little sliced tomato on the side.

Before you think I ordered a chili cheese dog, let me say that wiener schnitzel is actually a deep-fried veal patty. Deep-fried. Veal. What could possibly go wrong?

The first few bites were fine until the breading started to come off.  That's when I witnessed the horror. The meat patty, underneath the golden crust, looked like the shriveled gray skin of an alien cadaver.

I was so grossed out I didn't even take a picture. And this is from a guy who photographs his own food poisonings.

Yes, at $7 this is Strip robbery (a close relative to highway robbery, but with better decor), but the Tropical Mango smoothie is delicious.

We were seated by a friendly hostess. Immediately our drink orders were taken, followed by our food orders. The food took a while to arrive, but to be fair, the portions were quite large and presentation was both simple, but elegant. I ordered the braised short rib dip. It was a sandwich stuffed with beef, tomato, caramelized onions, and cheese. On the side it came with fries and au jus dip. It could've been more salty, but that is just personal preference. 

The service overall was slow though. Food took about half an hour to arrive and another ten minutes to call the waiter to get our check. The waiters and waitresses were kind but I think that only your waiter can take your orders and/or questions; if you ask other waiters/waitresses, you will be ignored.

They have a really cool three way creme brule that is hazelnut, pistachio, and vanilla creme brule. It was a great way to have desert because there was a variety and it was pretty good.

First and foremost, the service was hardly there.  We waited roughly ten minutes for a two-top.  Half the restaurant was empty.  We were seated and it took our waiter an estimated 5 minutes or so to get around to even acknowledging us.

Once he did, he visited us roughly 4 times, including collecting the bill.  The first time he came to the table, he curtly asked us if we were ready to order.  I may be biased because a bunch of my friends back home were servers when we were growing up, but basic courtesy is something that should be there.  Especially when two people are dropping $40 down on two bowls of French onion soup and one small and average tasting Cobb salad... AT BELLAGIO.

I've gotta say- Bellagio has this reputation as if it's got the market on class cornered in its favor... but after this experience, and seeing Palazzo/Caesar's/Venetian/Wynn, I'm thinking Bellagio is losing its status at the top tier.

Worth it if you have a coupon or get comped to come.  Otherwise, go to Grand Lux Cafe for a similar menu style with more options- all of which are better prepared.  And the waiters there treat you well.

In closing, we *NEVER* leave less than a 15% tip on anything.  You pretty much have  to call me a dick to my face to get a 15% tip, and we left duder 10%.  I feel no remorse in doing so.  AWFUL SERVICE.",wRmrMuDkkTXLAK8rQEGFAw,1,0,1,mw6jRjHRo5DrqhxVMXdsBA

When we were seated, a bus boy came to offer water/tea/coffee and we got water and coffee; then we waited for another 15min before we were able to spot our server to take our orders, other tables who got seated after us had already ordered (ridiculous). We ordered steak & egg and grilled salmon; after we placed our order, we waited another 21min before we got our food (I felt like I was in France).  The salmon was pretty good but nothing over the top, the steak was overcooked.

Something interesting happened while we were there though; there was a table of 6 men who only left our server $10 tips, she was upset but couldn't do much about it. I found it very unfair for our server so I did leave her 18% tips.

About 10min later, 1 of the 6 came back and claimed that his iPhone was lost and it was just on the table, he couldn't find it. Right before we left the restaurant, another person claimed that she lost her iPhone and it was right in front of her; that scared us and my husband immediately grabbed our iPhones that were on the table and secured them.

1. club sandwich with fries

4. a soda and an ice tea

the bill was $65.00 after tax and tip, what a rip off for a glorified Denny's.
If the food was exceptional I wouldn't care but the fact that it probably tasted worse than a typical all nighter coffee shop made it worse. Oh ya the drinks we ordered a soda or ice tea costs $4.50per drink yes that's $4.50 for 1 coke.

I go to Vegas all the time but talk about a rip off. Folks unless you got cash to burn for horrible food save yourself few bucks and go to a real Denny's or off the strip where you'll spend 1/3 of the price for better food.

I told him water with ice, I glanced at the late menu and the prices were extremely high for what they were serving compared to a restaurant off the strip that was serving the same kind of meals but since you're eating at the Bellagio nothing is really cheap unless the hotel comps your lunch and dinner or offers you food credit when checking in. 

I ordered Buffalo wings $12, French Toast with whip cream $16 and a glass of orange juice $8. The food was very good and the service was excellent despite being late and me being a bit tipsy. The decor of the cafe should he updated and seems to be the same since it opened under Mirage Resorts back in 1998. The pricing should be updated as well and the $8 Orange juice is just too much and is the same price as the one in the Society Cafe at Wynn. 

Overall all I consider this cafe to be good but not excellent and it needs a major update with the menu, pricing, and decor.

Since my friends and I were too hungry for crepes at Jean Philippe Patisserie but not hungry enough to tackle the buffet, our options for brunch at the Bellagio were rather limited.  After wandering around the casino to check out any other alternatives, we ended up at Café Bellagio since the line was relatively short and they were able to sit our group of nine pretty quickly.

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it came with a decent amount of food - homemade corned beef hash, two poached eggs, hash browns, and choice of toast.  The eggs and hash browns were fine, but the hash itself didn't do much for me.  While their generosity with the amount of meat they used would usually be a good thing, it felt like I was eating a salty corned beef patty than an actual corned beef hash.  Ironically, their attempts to make it a ""hash"" didn't help either, as the shreds of potato they threw in tasted a bit undercooked.

Although I might have given the food two stars on its own, I'm giving a one because I thought the service wasn't entirely there...literally.  After bringing out our food, our servers seemed to disappear for long stretches.  We had to motion several times to get our bill and once we did get it, one of my friends had to practically hunt them down to give them our check.  After what felt like 10-15 minutes, our server finally returned with our credit card  and slips...but only the merchant copy (none for us to keep).  Rather than wait around to ask for our copies, we just signed and left.

Why? Because I just felt like drinking some orange juice but then it turned out to be $7.50, without any refills. The orange juice is supposedly freshly squeezed which is probably why they charge so much. However, you're better off getting some orange soda with free refills to get your moneys worth. I'm not being cheap, but damn $7.50!

Anyway, if you're unsure what to order, get the Bellagio Classic which is a pretty big lobster omelet. The lobster is substantial and tasty. You might even consider sharing the platter with someone since it's so big. Another popular menu item is the eggs benedict. The presentation of the parmesan french fries was nice as well.

Service was better than average and it's a great location in the Bellagio hotel. Try to get a table with a good view of the garden thing.

First off they have complimentary bread and butter, but as me and my dining companion quickly learned, you have to specifically as for it if you want it to be served to you.  As we were waiting for our food, we noticed some tables would ask for bread and were quickly served some, while the other tables who did not ask for any were served none.

The service is attentive and professional. Most tables have views of the pool area or the Conservatory.

Unfortunately, you might wait for a very long time to be seated. Once, we just gave up and left. And all the while, empty tables go begging.

It was worse this time because they make you wait once in front and again after you're finally called to standby. Kind of like being at a doctors office. Anyway, we were finally seated after 40 minutes. I will say though that the older woman in front routing people to their seats was very efficient and personable. But things grew worse after that. Server was a middle-age gentleman who was faintly friendly but obviously sick with his job (or life). Ruined the service experience. Also, someone at our table was diabetic and requested to sub the hash browns for cottage cheese. Remarkably, there was a $3 substitution charge. Last time it was $7, so I guess this was an improvement. The sucking continued, however. I ordered the corned beef hash, which they proclaimed was ""homemade."" It was an abomination. Stringy, tough, and almost inedible. Then I had stomach issues the rest of the day. I just don't know why this place can't step its game up. Bellagio needs a new concept in this space.

The breakfast menu isn't so big and I opted for the Corned Beef Ruben which came with a pickle and parmesan fries. The rye bread was soft but flavorless, there was plenty of meat, the sauerkraut and cheese was well balanced and added more flavor. The fries however were cold and soggy.

Cafe Bellagio is located in the back of the Bellagio's conservatory of flowers. It was later so there wasnt a line to deal with but I've seen a line here often times during brunch time. 

We ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger, penne pasta and an appetizer of shrimp cocktail. It was all very good. The bbq bacon cheeseburger was very good. It was huge. The american cheese was melted on to the patty, there was shredded lettuce and tomatoes, it came with onion rings that were tucked under the delicious burger patty (1/2 pound) and the brioche bread it came in was good. The only knock I have on this burger is that it definitely is messy eating. With the bbq sauce and the brioche bun, it made for sticky hands for sure. Other than that it was quite tasty.

The penne past was well received. The pasta was cooked just right and the red sauce and chicken it came with were both tasty and cut into good-sized pieces. The shrimp cocktail was also tasty as it was fresh and the shrimp was a good size. 

Our waitress was the sweetest. I wish I remembered her name so I can thank her in this forum. She was a good sport and even advised us on MLife benefits when it came to dining at Cafe Bellagio or any other restaurant on property...

5622610,2014-09-13,0,JTFFtWy_chbsHTs95yD_2Q,"Came here with the girlfriend for some breakfast after a long night of partying. 

Like the Bellagio itself, Cafe Bellagio gives off a relaxed, even peaceful sort of vibe. This could be attributed to the fact that we stepped in for breakfast at 8 AM - but nonetheless, it offers a welcome escape from the fast-paced action of the Strip itself.

While others have said that wait times here can be a bit of a pain, we were seated almost immediately. (This being said, this may have been because we unintentionally managed to make it to the Cafe before the AM gambling crowd did - who knows how that happened!)

It's funny to see how others compared the design of this little cafe to that of Disneyland. I was definitely getting that vibe, as well. With mirrors covering many of the walls and some ornate ceiling decor, you feel as though you're paying for an experience that's a step or two above the typical IHOP/Denny's meal. 

The prices were a bit higher than what I'm used to seeing for a ""casual"" dining option. We split an order of the Caramelized Ham & Cheese Omelette, which was accompanied by a side of hash browns and a breadcrumb-topped half of a tomato.

Although the Cafe's prices were indeed a bit raised, the portion sizes certainly were also scaled up, as well. Both of us were more than filled by our respective half-omelettes, and we had a meal's worth of leftovers to take with us when it was all said and done.  

My half omelette was filled with gooey, well-melted cheddar; the cafe didn't skimp out on ham, either. My favorite component of the meal was definitely the hash browns. They had a wonderfully crunchy, crisp crust and a moist, fluffy interior. These were some of the best hash browns that I've had in recent memory. The crumb-coated tomato was also tasty and was great for refreshing the palate in between bites of egg and potato.  

Service at Cafe Bellagio was a noticeable cut above. I can't recall what our server's name was - she was an older lady - but she was welcoming, attentive, and plain ol' genuine. I got the feeling that I was seated at a relative's table each and every time that she checked up on us, refilled our drinks, etc. Honestly, I wish that every server took the time to care for her guests the way that this lady did. Her informative descriptions of menu items and overall pleasant demeanor were exactly what our slumped, painfully-hungover bodies had been hoping for. 

If you're just not feeling the buffet option, open up the wallet just a little bit and make your way to Cafe Bellagio. Just make sure that you come hungry!",Hv3vaKQGK71sLei7hQs9og,0,0,4,cTFOcRoOlEP_NX_0Vc4prQ

For breakfast, I ordered the Florentine omelette, which came with hash browns and toast. This omelette simply had TOO much cheese (and it kills me to write the words ""too much cheese""). But there was cheese inside of the omelette AND on top, which just wasn't appealing. I would not recommend this omelette. The second day for breakfast I ordered the small fruit bowl (this bowl of fruit is actually not small - it was quite large) and hash browns.

For lunch, I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna salad. The tuna didn't seem that fresh and was actually quite dry. The rest of the salad was lacking flavor as well. I ended up filling up on the breadsticks that are brought to the table during lunch.

Even though the hotel was busy we were quickly seated. We noted what a fascinating fabricated environment we were presented. You get the sense you are dining in an open air, outdoor restaurant but upon closer inspection one realizes it's sun coming in from skylights in the neighboring atrium plus some pumped in scents and moving air. Pretty cool and totally effective. Its Vegas after all baby.

Stacy, a vegetarian at the table ordered some of the mushroom tacos as an appetizer and I have to say I really enjoyed them. They were literally just tiny hard shell tacos filled with some nicely plump and sautéed mushrooms. I had two but secretly wanted a third. 

For the main course, the table ordered a mixed bag of items. This isn't fine dining, but everything was plated with a classic towel wiped white plate aesthetic.

I ordered the Friday special which I quite enjoyed. It featured three shrimp and chorizo ""brochettes"" which is just a fancy way of saying skewer. The shrimp was wrapped around a slice of dense chorizo like you might wrap bacon around a filet. While it was marinaded in a delicious chimichurri sauce the proteins were really overcooked. Almost like it had been grilled hours prior and then held in a heat drawer waiting for it's unexpected victim.

The shrimp was rock hard and the sausage had lost all of the soul, aka it's oil. Still, it was delicious. Also delicious was the perfectly executed saffron risotto that sat underneath the skewers, er sorry the brochettes. All in all, it was a great meal but I would not order this dish again. 

During our lunch we discussed all sorts of interesting subject matter. My boss Bruce suggested I watch a movie called ""Mondo Cane"" which discusses the way different cultures around the world produce the food they eat. 

The conversation got a little dark for a moment, with people talking about having to personally butcher animals as children. At some point Haluk (another coworker) described a previous job that required him to visit a chicken factory farm. He claimed that it made it impossible for him to continue consuming chicken and he's glad he hasn't been to a cow or lamb farm yet. 

It was at that point that Haluk made a statement describing the ritual of food: eating the dead to stay alive. Stacy the vegetarian noted that yes, everything she was currently eating was dead. 

What an unexpectedly profound moment, burnt into my brain forever and now immortalized on yelp.

Service here is awful.  Maybe it was the way we were dressed [it was 12am and we were all in a different array of pajamas], maybe it was because we all had our travel faces on, or maybe it was because they lacked decent customer service but waiting around for 30 minutes in a near-empty empty restaurant on a weekday for a glass of orange juice and a sandwich with fries is ridiculous!  At least give us some water if you can't pour me a glass of oj!  I get that the servers deals with the drunks and asshats that venture into their beloved city but we were nothing but polite.  My friends and I all work in different fields of customer service and the lack of manners and a smile is just rude.

So how was the food?  Mediocre at best.  I daresay that even Denny's or Village Inn can slap together a better sandwich and deep-fry some frozen fries.  Oh well.  We ate, we paid, and we left.  Never again, Cafe Bellagio.

I got the eggs Benedict which was also
Good but the hash browns were burned so we asked for them to bring out another order.
Bottomless coffee, which is ok-Bellagio definitely doesn't do coffee right (not in the coffee shops, the restaurants, or even served at the conventions)...lack of enough raw sugar on the table.

The first thing I noticed was the nice opulent decor, followed by friendly greetings by the hostess and our server, Julie K.  The meal then began with a warm tasty roll and butter, followed by a good Crab Dip spread on toasted baguette slices.  But the dip could have been creamier.

A crock of French Onion Soup with well-melted Gruyere Cheese was excellent, and dense Meatloaf topped by Brown Gravy and mushrooms was very good with Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans.  Unfortunately, the chef read the ticket wrong, and Diane had to send her medium burger back to receive a medium rare replacement.

- Artichoke dip (can be shared with another) / yummmmmy!
- Salmon w/ Mashed potatoes and veggies / had my salmon cooked all the way and came out PERFECT!
- Berry Cheesecake

However, when the waitress (Susie) delivered the food to the table and said who ordered the pancakes I gestured, me. She then processed to hand me the plate instead of placing it down, which would be fine except for the fact that the plate was scorching  hot. Then when my husband felt the plate he said to me, ""Why would she hand that to you?"" She then looked at him with a nasty face. Service could have been better!!",c4yOEh9K62_B-7cE-qBYog,0,0,3,1quHnKsQvz_6M3DYDgloZg

My friends and I came in the early afternoon and didn't wait too long before we were seated. We got a great table next to the conservatory so we had a good view while we were dining. (We could hear the music from the conservatory which was a little troubling since the western music they were playing did not fit the whole springtime theme of the displays...but that's a whole other story.)

The food is mediocre and is fairly filling. My friends ordered the burger while I had the torts de milanesa which I had trouble finishing. It was a little hard to flag down our server when we needed refills for our soft drinks or anything else.",mNVP9RnHydn1RL01vlp1jg,0,0,3,tPljwHCKQYG99pxxQSXIaA

The food was overpriced for what it is (I get it, it's Vegas, but at least have great service).

Our waiter was friendly and pleasant, and even though it was going through construction it was still a really nice place to eat. I ordered the waffle and a side of cottage cheese as well as a latte. We were all served our food at the same time, everything came out hot and tasted amazing. This cafe is for sure a place to go eat at in Las Vegas.
