Didn't have anything available that was on the menu so I went with just curry. I figured, you can't fuck up curry right? Man I was so wrong. The food tasted really bad. They probably just bought some packaged curry from the store and heat it up.

The first thing you will notice is the furniture and layout. its very cafe-like and clean. its 2pm on saturday and its calm. it feels like a small retreat from the normal chinatown hustle.
the menu is a bit smaller than other places, but that is not always bad. i did notice chicken katsu missing, but there is always trusty pork katsu. i wanted to try okonomiyaki but it was crossed off the menu. the curry was delicious, but there was a slight difference than other curries. perhaps a different base. 
the attention to plating really does make it feel like from tokyo.
for dessert i had a chocolate banana parfait. the contents were sliced banana, vanilla ice cream, frosted flakes, whipped cream, and crumbled chocolate cake and  chocolate syrup and a chocolate pirouette. altogether very good. i will definitely be coming back.",l_i3ZQx2-x2a7HfsHjex9g,0,0,5,tysWyvQwaU813ickoKuqpA

1432179,2016-03-12,16,yfXk-WRkDUn0W_dAT1Pn0Q,"Tokyo Kitchen is a new restaurant that has taken over the old Kaba Curry place in Chinatown. After walking in, the dining room has a more upscale feel to it than its previous incarnation. I particularly like the chairs in this place, they are super comfy.

Looking at the menu, it looks like they are going for a casual Japanese cafe type food with a focus on curries, vegetable bowls, appetizers including okonomiyaki, and desserts. After ordering from the friendly server, I waited.

The food took an abnormally long time to come out. It was about 25 minutes after I ordered, and I was the only person in the restaurant.

The okonomiyaki came first, after taking a few bites, I sent it back because it was barely above room temperature. When it came back, the chef just took the one I sent back, and heated it up so it was burnt on the bottom. 

The Katsu Curry wasn't a success as well. I kept hearing a microwave go off, and I thought that was odd. When my dish came, I understood why. The pork was tough as rubber and was separating from the overcooked panko crust, and was watery. I ate half because I was trying to figure out why it tasted so weird. The curry tasted average and the rice tasted like it had been sitting in a holder for half the day. Fortunately, the server didn't charge me for the okonomiyaki.

I gave an extra star because my server was really nice and pleasant. But the food is poorly prepared.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,30,23,2,9ABR1GvujfF5xYNGQxQFiA

The food was cute it wasn't exquisite or anything it's just simple curry, but the way they present your food is super cute! The portions also look like kinda small at first but it REALLY fills you up. I got the spaghetti omelette, it tasted kinda sweet but it was really good. My friend ordered the pork cutlet lvl 10 spicy and his mouth was on fire LOL. And there was this other one it was like beef curry or something? That one was probably THE BEST. 
Once you're done I recommend getting dessert like I MEAN IT. Everything on their menu was delicious. If you get the chocolate banana ice cream, the presentation of it is TOO CUTE and really delicious too. And there was this green tea one with Mochi and red bean? That was my other favorite too.

I like the interior, I like what they have on the menu, I like how it's clean and I like how the employees are super friendly. 
But how can someone run a restaurant and not be able to keep simple functions of the store maintained?
I came to try the curry with pork cutlet but the first time I came, their fryer wasn't working so everything I wanted could not be made. Well fine. So I ordered the curry with sausages. Of course the presentation was nice but I got 3 small sausages with lots of curry and not enough rice. 
I decided to give this place another chance because determining something of what it is with one experience does not provide fair justice. 
So I came again today with a friend. The minute we walk in, the employee notifies us that they don't have anymore curry.. Uhhhh well 
My friend just decided on an omelette rice instead but apparently the certain rice they use for the omelette rice was not available either. 
In the end, he ordered a spaghetti dish with a fried egg on the bottom called the 'Neopolitan'. 
The employee brings over a free chicken salad to apologize for everything but I felt like it was in vain. 
The food is good but the business seems unstable. Whatever the case is, I'll just stick to Curry Zen.",C_CqWSkpn2aOnUXtHx0-iw,6,3,2,TsPrVAmG18tSmU1dRdmmCg

The place is decorated really cute and has a very lounge-y feel to it. I ordered the katsu curry and added veggies with a spice level 5. I really like spicy food and this had a pretty comfortable spice that kind of builds up like when you eat hot cheetos. They have a very interesting concept to their place because they have some board games laying around for you to play. So in a sense it's like an asian cafe with more dinner-time foods. My boyfriend and I broke out the game of Blokus I felt like such a happy little kid getting to play games while I ate my meal.  Everything was delicious, and they had little pickled sides on the table which I practically ate most of. At the back next to the games they also had cute cut out frames for posting on facebook and instagram, so when you share it on social media they let you try a dessert.
