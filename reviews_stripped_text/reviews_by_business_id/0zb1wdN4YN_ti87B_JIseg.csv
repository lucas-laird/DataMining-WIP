My friend Micah went on to explaining how awesome it was and I'll never forget his facial expressions.  He went on to say that it's so sweet and spicy and chewy and crunchy and we immediately went and got some.  I never had anything like it and it was an instant hit.  It's not every day you find something out of the ordinary that makes you feel this way, but the first time I tried this food truck I felt like it put me right back to my first pho experience.  These guys are really on to something.  The ""Q"" sandwich is the bomb!",0VOsLti6yTNKBNycy_szuQ,1,1,5,B09mUZ0ozHOcHS44Nzx9Qw

I'm so glad that I did. They know how to do Pho as well as some other Pho(n) stuff (get what I did there?). My hubby and I ordered the delish Pho soup which was the right amount of seasoning and beef flavor. I hate a tart Pho and Wa Da Pho's was perfect. We also ordered the chicken lettuce wrap, Baos, the tofu nachos (yummy) and my favorite of the evening- the Ahi Poki Nachos! They are out of this world. I would seriously follow this food truck to eat the Poki nachos everyday. The only thing I was disappointed about was that they ran out of the Lobster balls but I was there at the Foodie Festival on the last day 2 hours before the place was closing so I can't blame them on that. I'll just have to get them next time. I also liked that the truck was super sleek and the service was on point. I couldn't believe they just launched at the Foodie Fest. These people know what they are doing. They also are on punch card / frequent buyer app called Epoxy where if you download you can get punches for each meal you order and the 10th entree is free.

Da lobsta ballz- soooooooo addictive with their dipping sauce.  

When we were there they had a special dish, spicy poke!!!!!  So mouthwatering good!!  Some of the freshest poke I've ever had....and it came from a truck!

So all morning I was all excited about going to Rollin Smoke BBQ for lunch and here pulls up the Wa Da Pho food truck outside my window at work. It was closer to walk to the food truck than my car. I had both Rollin Smoke BBQ and Wa Da Pho bookmarked for a while and wanted to try both equally as bad as the other. Talk about a food c-block, f-block.  Well since Wa Da Pho usually isn't out there, a regular food truck and occasionally a good food truck is parked there, I had to go for some. For lunch they have a ""da pho box lunch special"".  Choosing 2 of 5 items and a drink or a dessert and chips for about $9. I went off of the pictures on their food truck since everything looked good, didn't read the food descriptions usually the best way for me to do things. 

The first item I chose was the ""da lobsta ballz"" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wa-da-pho-las-vegas?select=ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg#ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg I enjoyed most of it.  The outsides tasted very delicious. The insides however was meh, it tasted exactly like imitation lobster which is what the menu exactly said after I read it, lightly fried imitation lobster balls served with 'da' sauce spiced with their special blend of seasonings. I did no care for the insides because it was mushy like when you use too much water when you cook a pot of rice and try to salvage it. I know some people who like this kind of mushiness so maybe it suppose to be like this, which is fine.  

The second item was the ""pho-licious 'Q' slider"" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wa-da-pho-las-vegas?select=ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg#FPBIQcO1L4JkJRqleDeUKg it tasted like eating a pho in a slider with more. It was a pretzel slider bun with BBQ pho brisket, papaya slaw, cabbage, cilantro and their 'wa' sauce. It was good again but I didn't really enjoy the pho meat part maybe because I always dump sriracha and hoisin into my pho. I'd ask for more sauce next time or even some of that 'da' sauce from da lobsta ballz. The chips and cinna-bao dessert were enjoyable.

I sampled some of the ""pho-licious 'Q' nachos and they were very good, nice sized but a little small for the price.  It was lightly fried wonton chips with pho 'Q' brisket (wow they actually call it that haha), cilantro, green onion, melted big eye swiss cheese topped off with a splash of 'da' sauce. Enjoyed them the most.

I'm a fan of their organization and effort in making things easy and standing out, logos on food boxes and containers, order numbering and receipt system, friendliness, etc. Follow them on Facebook and Twitter to know where they at.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,8,3,3,mwZC21snQeFs71OvpZnjqQ

3063676,2013-05-01,3,0zb1wdN4YN_ti87B_JIseg,"Okay, tried this place at the Foodie Fest. What an amazing concept!  Pho on a food truck, genius! I mean, I avoid China Town like a freaking plague b/c I can't stand the horrible asian drivers on Spring Mtn, especially the grandmas in Camrys too busy trying to cover up from the sun if yunno what I mean, plus it seems most of the Pho restaurants in town are kinda dirty, yunno the 'I shoulda brought my own clean utensils' kind or 'what's the restaurant grade here?' kind of place. So I am glad I can finally get quality, deep flavor Pho from a very clean 'food truck', yay! Not only that, but they have other great food options on the menu, like Da Lobsta Ballz (love the dipping sauce), Da Poki Nachos (fantastic flavor & it's good quality) and their signature sandwich (from what I heard in line) Da Pholicious Q, which my Hubby absolutely loved. It had great components to it, good flavorful meat & asian slaw with a special tangy sauce & interesting bread. I heard others raving about Da Big Baoz (like a Vietnamese taco) & Da Meatballz (I think they were Hawaiian style). Overall, I recommend trying this place. I'd like to try all the other items on the menu & will provide another updated review later. A clean, contemporary choice for asian fusion food, I hope they're around my office sometime soon so we can get our Wa Da Pho fix!",E1XA_SC0-caYcRjYgyvNSg,1,0,5,xfOcqJiF5pNfNBDZOWF2qw

I got two orders of Da Big Baoz ($2.75 ea.) and one Pho-licious Q Slider ($2.75) for lunch. The sirloin in the bao was slightly sweet but the sauce gave it a bit of a kick. Both had plenty of filling. My only gripe is that the buns were a little dried out. The slider was amazing.

Tried Da Big Baos which were like any Pork Belly Bao I've tried. Still, the best value is at Cheesecake Factory where you get the same set up for $5.95, but they're known as Vietnamese Tacos(Why? IDK???) We also tried Da Lobsta Balls which were decent but kinda tasted like kamaboko(fishcake) instead of lobster to me.

I wish these guys continued success, and give them a try if they are on a street curb near you....ALOHA!!!

The gentelmen that was working the truck informed me that it was a local truck and they were launching to the public via the foodie fest. The truck was very clean and the prices seemed a bit high especially for launching day but I was eager to try it. I noticed that this food truck seemed to have some tyoe of rewards system setup where you scan a QR code i imagine to get a discount I didnt get much information on it of how to sign up the sign was just out there. The truck was very well fitted i saw that they had an entire POS system setup with a clear modem and all. The ipad had a square on it that allowed them to take credit cards and it also wirelessly printed the reciepts to a printer that was seup on the side, pretty trick for a food truck. I wanted to try the asian wrap but they were already sold out so we settled for da lobsta ballz and da pho-licious ""Q"". Im not sure what it was but i felt like they lobsta ballz lacked something something to give them a kick or make the lobsta stand out. Da Pho-licious Q was really good however i found the pieces of meat to be a bit too big for a sandwhich that i truly wanted to share. 

I decided to re-try the food truck on saturday 4/27. I wanted to try the asian wrap again but again they were out of it. So this time we had da tofu nachos da meatballz and vegtable wa da pho. The tofu nachos were spectacular they made my wife and step son really like them and they are not tofu eaters at all. Da meatballz were also full of flavor and we're very tasteful.
