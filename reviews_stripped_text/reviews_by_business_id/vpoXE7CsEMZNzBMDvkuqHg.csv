We've been by it a bunch of times, but we're usually grabbing Fuddruckers and cupcakes from Mad Hatter. We were lured in because my husband's uncle had a discount with the Entertainment Book card. 

The space is relaxed and nicely decorated, but frankly I don't care what a place looks like if it's tasty and priced right. Still a nice atmosphere is always appreciated. My husband and I ordered our standard Thai dishes: pad thai and spicy eggplant. Uncle ordered spring rolls and stuffed chicken wings. The peanut sauce was the highlight and the spiciest of the dishes despite specific requests for spicy. The eggplant was waxy and sweet. I was not fond of it. However, it was better than my husband's too sweet pad thai and overcooked noodles. He gave me a small portion to try and I had no desire to finish it. It was some of the worst I've encountered in town. Uncle wasn't impressed by his selections either.

Service was below average. Timing was off and refills were slow.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,0,2,jZ8l6_v1adVboPZJzremrw
1162066,2011-01-24,0,vpoXE7CsEMZNzBMDvkuqHg,"A friend and I stopped in to Aranya and ordered carry-out for dinner.  We were invited to sit at the bar while we waited for our food to be prepared.  The interior is very nice, clean, and well-maintained.  The service was prompt, friendly, and professional.

In addition to offering the usual chicken, beef, and tofu panang curries for $9.95 each, Aranya also offers shrimp and salmon panang for $11.95 and $13.95 respectively.  I thought it would be interesting to try the salmon panang, since I had never seen that as an option for panang before.  

The salmon panang was not served the way other panangs are typically served -- that is, in a tall plastic container with the chunks of meat or tofu submerged in the coconut milk curry sauce.  Instead it was served in a styrofoam flat bed container (over aluminum foil) with the whole salmon steak doused with the curry sauce.  I guess it makes more sense to do it this way with salmon, but it was actually somewhat of a disappointment to me because I think I only got about a third of the amount of curry sauce that I would have gotten with any other panang dish, and there was hardly a need for the brown rice I ordered on the side. However, it's my fault for not asking or thinking about it before I ordered.  Anyway, it tasted very good.

My friend ordered the tofu pad kra pow, which some other Asian restaurants would simply call spicy mint tofu.  The tofu was served in large chunks.  My friend enjoyed the dish, but she thought it would have been better if the tofu had been served ground -- to mimic the way the spicy mint chicken is typically served with ground chicken.

As with some other Thai restaurants, rice is considered a side dish which must be ordered separately.  Sticky rice and brown rice are $2.00, and steamed rice is $1.00 (small) or $2.00 (large).

So, Aranya Thai Bistro has good food, good service, fair prices, and nice interior.  This place is A-OK.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,2,2,3,XlrQNPSjrGjXSo_49t_Jbw

I was set on Zaba's this evening, when out of nowhere, a wild sign appeared that read ""Thai food!"" I immediately started craving some sweet sticky rice and mango. So, I ventured off into the complex across the way.

Went in, looked at a menu and discovered that they didn't have it ;( but figured, ""what the hell, I'm here already,"" so I ordered some food to go. The place itself is nice looking.. ""quaint."" I ordered a Thai iced tea, which the lady brought to me quickly, so I started sipping-- delicious! But more on that later...

The food actually came out pretty fast, which seemed a bit unusual. But after reading a couple reviews, I'm guessing what I got had probably been sitting out for a bit and was popped into a microwave or something. I'm not too picky, it all tasted fine, so whatever.

So I'm sitting at home, done eating, watching me some Breaking Bad and finishing up my tea. I take off the lid and without second thought, began munching on ice, like I do. Well, eventually I decide to look into the cup and see that there's little black specs  in pretty much all of the ice cubes. I shake it around a bit and find a bigger piece of-- Now, for my fellow Yelpers who have worked in fast food and know how gross an ice machine can get if not properly cleaned, this one's for you-- MOLD.

And that right there forfeited all the couple of stars I was going to give this place for being adequate. I realize I've probably eaten at places that don't practice kitchen cleanliness, but when it's so bad that I fucking see mold in my ice, that is where I draw the line.

I have gone to four thai restaurants in town so far (well, 6 if you count the three different Archi's locations with different names). So far, I have ordered the maximum hotness level at every one of them and still had to add everything available on the spice trays.

I think they all figure that I'm a white guy so I can't handle the real heat. Let me assure you, that is incorrect. The lady at this place told me to just order it extra extra spicy next time I come in and she'll try to hook me up. I look forward to it!

The flavor on the panang curry was very very good. It gets a star taken off for lack of spiciness, and I wasn't a big fan of the salad either. The egg roll was pretty good for an egg roll, but I'm not a fan of them in general so I didn't ding them for not impressing me.

At the end of the day, I will *definitely* be coming back here and ordering the lunch extra spicy. Definitely a great lunch spot.

1639834,2015-06-15,0,vpoXE7CsEMZNzBMDvkuqHg,"About two weeks ago, had wonton soup in this restaurant, which was the worst I had ever, ever had in my whole life.

Here are the components of the soup:

1. water,  with one big drop of oil floating on the top. This was the only aspect showing the ""generosity"" of the cook, and owner.

2. Two pieces of veg stems:  very hard. with no leaf on either stems, I could only guess: kale stem. Also this was the first time, I learned that such hard stem were used in soup. 

3. Four pieces of wonton, all wrappers were in rugs, The stuffing of beef meat was tiny, yet very hard. Since it was so tiny, one had to just swallow down, leaving the job of breaking it down to stomach.

4.  two pieces of  shrimps,  overcooked, hard with no flavor at all.

5. three pieces of sliced meat: I guess pork. also hard, no flavor at all. 

Among the five items, except shrimp ( finished with disguest), and water ( did not taste at all), I just had a tiny bite of each of the other three item, then dropped, stopped to eat. So the lunch was a sample tasting for me, I only had two pieces of shrimp. The rest of them was left in the bowl.

Without any exaggeration, every compoenet was a failure, a compelte failure.

 The total cost was around $1-2 at most, sold for around $10. I left nearly the whole bowl behind. The owner even did not bother to ask about any issues for future improvement. Or improvement was not what she cared about in the first place.

I wrote my review with two purposes in mind: 

first of all, the owner should raise here sense of responsibility for customers. She simpley did not any sense of responsiblity shown in the soup at all. Yes, either side has responsibility for the other: As a customer, I should pay for the cost of material and  labor. As the owner and cook, she has the responsibility to produce a meal up to the charge, or at least edible. But she failed here completely, even without any sign of caring about why it nearly remained untouched.

Secondly, I really don't want others to repeat what I experienced. The good thing is that I am local and I can have another lunch at home. What about non-local customers?",ArDzkENc5sbLdGqHBASY2A,1,1,1,yxqfUQvLgisRTVRAFQjF7w

Upon entering the restaurant, we were quickly greeted by the server and seated, and I have to admit that I was quite impressed by the well done decor.  That aside, I would have to say that I was pretty satisfied with the food experience.

Had to order some our usual fav's (Being that it was our first time here, we decided to play it safe and order 2 out of 4 level spicy just in case we didn't want our bootays kicked too badly):
1.  Papaya Salad - We couldn't taste the spiciness at all.  However, I still enjoyed the tangy and sweet refreshing and crunchy papaya shreds.  Perfect for summer.
2.  Tom Yum Gong - This soup I felt was way too sweet and also lacked any spiciness.  Someone was a little heavy handed with the sugar ladle, but the bf seemed to slurp his up happily.
3.  Pad Kra Pow - We ordered this dish in the chopped beef form and it actually had some spicy kick.  Maybe they forgot to add the spice in the other two dishes?  *shrug.  Either way, this dish was my fav of the night.  Spicy, minty and flavorful.  =)

Conclusion 08.02.2010:  I've certainly have had better Thai food at other places, but this place is very a-ok in my book.

Conclusion 08.03.2010:  Yup!  I went 2 days in a row, but it did help me solidify my conclusion that the food here is definitely on the wayyyy sweeter side.

Since I was only doing takeout, I just made the cut for the lunch specials from 11AM-3PM (also valid on weekends!) and opted for the garlic chicken. 

Per the menu, lunch specials come with soup (when you dine in), salad, fried rice, and egg roll (I thought this was a Thai place?), with entrée protein choice of chicken, beef, or pork,  surcharge for shrimp. My dish was  one flavorless spring roll, a heap of wonton strips (who eats those except on soup?), and a chunk of ice berg lettuce with some matchstick carrots. And my (half?) portion of garlic chicken: lightly flavored sauce, tender chicken, and a good shake of pepper on top? Very odd. Oh and the ""entrée"" section of the takeout box was largely dominated by a gigantic heap of white rice. Not fried. This would be better placed where the wonton strips are.

Service was quick and polite. Order did not meet my expectations. Did not eat half the order: won ton strips and dressing-less lettuce were tossed, could not stomach the flavorless spring roll or more than a few bites of the white rice that was hogging the space that should have been occupied by more garlic chicken.

We arrived right when the store opened and the waitress seemed unhappy to see my friend and I. No smile, no greeting, she just walked us to our table and handed us tattered menus. Great start. We were the only customers but it took her a while to take our order.

Our food came out first and our drinks last.. Is that a Thai thing? The food was also severely disappointing. My friend ordered green curry and I ordered my favorite Thai dish, Pad Kra Pao. After tasting both, I knew I would never return to this restaurant. The curry was watery and the Pad Kra Pao was somehow flavorless.

I noticed this place as I was working on the road in this part of town yesterday.  I had a little time to kill and was craving some Tom Ka soup!

Right from the get-go it's hard to note much in the way of positives.  It was approx. 4pm, not a single customer in the dining room.  I walked in, and there was no hostess... (She was hiding behind her make-shift office in one of the dining booths).  I asked her if I could sit at the bar since I was dining alone, sadly there was only ONE available seat at the bar, the remaining seats were occupied with restaurant supplies.  

I ordered my Tom Ka and some Chicken Satay along with a glass of Iced Thai Tea.  While I waited for my food to arrive, I noticed them microwaving several meals, and they weren't even being discreet about it as the microwave was sitting behind the bar facing patrons.  The microwaved food was then packed into 'take out' bags.  

My food arrived and it was less than impressive.  The soup had chunks of tomato so large they had to be cut with a knife, I was offered a 'spicy' soup and it came out a weak 4 out of 10 on the Thai spicy scale.  The chicken Satay was decent, however I refused to try the dipping sauces since moments before serving I saw them take it out of the microwave!!!!

The three items totaled over $20 which seemed a bit steep for the quality.  The Thai food market in Las Vegas is strong, and  in order to compete, you've got to be good.  ..... This place left a lot to be desired",3lOqsX_9TqcdLTrdaXbjQQ,1,0,1,y3yr4p2v6YCV90SJEuQZzQ

We got an order of Thai egg rolls, an order of Garlic with Black Pepper sauce (extra garlic requested), and an order of Red Curry (Gang Dang) chicken.  My wife thought the chicken was OK but not as described.  The menu notes that it's topped with roasted garlic Thai style but it wasn't.  It wasn't topped with the roasted garlic like every other Thai restaurant from which we've gotten garlic pepper chicken.

My red curry with chicken was flavorful.  Their spiciness is done on a 1-4 scale.  I ordered a 3 and it had a nice spice to it.  I also received a small container of ground red pepper to add more spice if I wanted.  I appreciate it when Thai restaurants do this.

The Pad Thai had a really good flavor too it and it was the best thing on the plate. The fried rice and the egg roll were blah! The egg roll really needed to be served with sweet and sour sauce in order for it to taste okay. The rice needed some flavor .I was waiting for the waitress to come back over because I wanted some hot sauce to put over it. She never came though.
