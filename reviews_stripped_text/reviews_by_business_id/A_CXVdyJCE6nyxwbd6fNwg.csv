We started with the daily chefs special, a garlic bread knot stuffed with roasted garlic and drizzled with garlic oil. Just terrific. I followed with a burger that was just as enjoyable. My wife had the avocado and melon salad with fresh local avocados and tomatoes. She said it was terrific. 

I would definitely recommend giving it a try.",TZ2rwiZfk3c_1lWG-w6u6A,0,0,4,3NrZuUe0qfLvaoAD6GSugg
336842,2016-12-04,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise! Outstanding food and bunnies on the logos! The gastro-pub concept is not exactly new but this one is, so I was worried. Things started off badly when we had to wait almost twenty minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. But in retrospect that was more a sign of the place's popularity than its lack of preparedness. The food and service made up for that and more. They suggest ordering multiple small plates to share. We had shrimp, scallops, flat bread, cauliflower, agnolotti pasta and a wonderful dessert with ice cream and pistachios. Check out the menu online for better descriptions of what we ordered. Everything was absolutely delicious and interesting too. The only critique I can muster is that the flat bread was not quite cooked enough for my taste. My spouse thought it perfect though. Drinks were spot on, as you would hope for a gastro-pub. So overall this is an easy five stars.

388882,2016-10-17,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Sat at the bar on a Friday night before hitting up a show down the hall at House of Blues and this was a great start to our evening. It was a toss up between this and Stripsteak and we picked Libertine expecting a little more variety and a little less sticker shock (not sure the variety part came through but overall I think this was reasonably priced meal FOR THE STRIP - $160 for two people having 4 drinks, appy and mains).

What we had: Scotch Olives (our favorite overall) - the lamb sausage brought in a robust (NOT gamey) flavor and paired perfectly with the acidity of the green olives; Libertine burger (excellent and the cheese, tomato, carmelized onions and sauce were each a stand up quality on their own so bringing it together was an incredible flavor profile. We asked for medium-rare and it came out medium++); scallops (cooked properly in that they were tender and juicy, not at all overdone but we missed the element of a nice pan carmelization. Sauce was non-descript and posting this two days later I can't remember anything about the sauce except it was white sauce); roasted cauliflower (heirloom/tri-colored cauliflower with a nut-based crunchy topping - very satisfying and went well with the scallops); Beverages: in some ways their cocktail menu is really robust but, in the moment, hubby and I struggled to identify anything we wanted to drink; their pitcher drinks are quite impressive looking;  I ordered the Paloma (bottled on site, very kitchy/cute and good but probably would try something else next time); Manhattan (hubby liked it); we needed a ""pick me up"" drink before going to the concert so we went 'off menu' and ordered two Irish Coffees - these were terrific (whipped cream was made fresh for our order and it was a true mixologist performance putting the drinks together - couldn't have tasted better!!).

Pros: atmosphere is great with the cool lighting and wall decorations to the slightly-retro'd feel of the furnishings (bar stools were really comfy); service (I can only speak to bar service) was well orchestrated across the team and we were well cared for without it being intrusive - they nailed service; Irish Coffee.

Cons: Yes, it's a steep price tag overall ($160) for a gastropub dinner for two but I don't think you can do much better for pricing on the strip when you're getting this type of quality food + atmosphere; burger was over-cooked per our order (we didn't ask them to fix this - the juicy toppings compensated enough for over done meat)",YzXAwVGxg1DB3rIFjgV25w,0,0,4,ptcNsva0nFpk9go6KuhoIg
505401,2016-08-19,1,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"So I tried this place the other night. Charles was our server he was great. I'm starting with the food because that's why i go to restaurants. 

We ordered the ahi tuna cones, Parmesan churros, foie gras pate, green kale salad. 45 days dry age rib eye with bone, charcoal corn, and whiskey bread pudding. Ahi tuna was bomb! Parmesan churros look nice but tasted bland, like not enough cheese or salt. Foie gras pate would have been good but it tasted like they watered down with too much cream, which was no Bueno to me because I love foie gras and barely tasted it.  Kale salad was bomb and I don't like ordering kale salads. (you can guess who made me ordered that) rib eye was on point! And it's not on the menu so you got to ask. Charcoal corn also tasted bomb! The bread pudding though was too dry and bland. They need to work on that. 

They're still new so I would give them another shot. Charles our server was great. The atmosphere or ambiance whatever you want to call it was ok but the music was way too loud, I felt like I had to yell at my girl sometimes to hear me. lol",fMurg3G5cC8C7yN-4AxeuQ,2,0,3,7Wk6yTdWICgrWc19hG7jNg

Their cocktails are so good that I ask for their pitchers. Another one that I like to have whenever I'm having dinner with not enough friends to ask for a pitcher is the nostro rosa, it is one of a kind!

I've had the fried egg which is one of my favorites plates. I think it is so rich and creamy that I ask for it every time I go there. I also like the fingerling potatoes with the poached egg and Serrano ham. Another great item is the lamb shank, I think is so juicy and tender and they pair it with great flavors. The waygu beef is one of the most outstanding dishes they have. I asked it rare and was BEAUTIFULLY cooked! It is so hard to find someone who execute it like they do. I also enjoy the combination of flavors their flatbreads have, one of my faves is the fennel and sausage. If you feel like having fish, their branzino is fantastic, it is so flavorful and even they cook it on the grill is juicy and tender.

All the dishes were best-of-breed.

1241419,2017-07-18,1,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Libertine Social is a fancy gastropub that is a great place to catch up with friends. Though it is a little pricey for a gastropub, the food is pretty tasty. 

The House Baked Pretzel was baked perfectly, allowing the dough to be light and soft. The cheddar fondue was the right amount of gooey-ness and was a delicious dip to the pretzel. The Wood Grilled Sausages were a good sampler of different types of sausages, which were all grilled to perfection, giving the sausages a smokey kick.

The Black Truffle Pizza had a good ratio of fontina and Parmesan, giving it a nice cheesy and stringy consistency, which is always nice to have with your pizza. The pizza was topped with slivers of truffles, which accentuated the delicious flavors of the cheese. But my personal favorite was the Fennel and Sausage flatbread. The flatbread was thing and crispy, while the sausage was very flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness that was noticeable with the notes of honey that was on the flatbread.

Hmm. How to explain my experience? We came here for my gf's birthday and first of all, it's called Libertine Social, but I'm not sure why. As I glanced around the decor for more clues, everything just jumped out at me as being completely random. No theme, just had love, beaches, photos, cars, all seemingly thrown together without much thought. They even had random bunnies everywhere which were cute, but pretty random. Or maybe because of the playboy bunny? But the bunnies looked too cute! Maybe the Stay Wild sign? But the rest seemed so tame! The lighting was nice, but the tables were plain.

We were also a group of six and they sat us at a table meant for 4, and the restaurant was not bustling. It was just a little confusing. All of our place mats touched each other's so there was zero spacing in between anyone. They didn't think this through? You're seating 6 people for a birthday dinner and you squish us in a little table! Luckily they were fast at clearing the courses from our table, because we could only fit 1-2 dishes at a time and even then it was a tight fit. Our drinks were also perched precariously at the edge of the table because of the lack of space. And this was with only 2 people drinking! The rest of the space was taken up with water.

Luckily, most of the food was tasty and nicely presented. I wouldn't recommend any of the vegetable dishes though. Those were too salty. The ahi cones and oxtail crostini were the tastiest dishes, albeit pricey. They were very awesome about adding an extra cone to the ahi dish to make it a 6 person dish instead of 5. That was very nice of them to do that with no extra charge. They were so cute and delicious!

Service was great and fast! They brought out a birthday dish for my friend, and even though they charged for it (I find charging for a birthday dessert tacky since most give it for free) they at least priced it at a discount.

P. S. The bathroom is freaking gigantic!

Oh yeah, and make sure you take a picture with the bunny angel outside!

Maybe with a few kinks fixed, this place could be better!",N6S6h8kFXk0tuxPSiZKCMw,2,2,3,5tHAkq0qkCdPp5Qjo2zIng

The hamachi cones and Thai spare ribs were our favorites, but the gnudi was also terrific.

The restaurant's energy and feel are really nice - somewhat energetic, but not loud. You can have a conversation at the bar (at least on week nights, anyway, it looked like they had DJ on Friday).

We started with the tuna cones which were awesome.  They were perfect little savory bites and good for sharing.  The house baked pretzel was also surprisingly good with a very addictive cheddar fondue. 

The grilled octopus looked absolutely amazing but by some freak accident my water ended up spiling on the plate!  Without hesitation the server took the plate away and brought me back a new dish - awesome service.  It was worth the wait as the octopus was delicious.

We got there at 10:30 and know that they closed at 11:00. Regardless, the hostess was happy to receive us and brought us to the dining area. Our server Kawyn came over and offered us sparkling or still. Everything seemed pretty normal until I asked him what was popular there since the items on the menu had items I was not familiar with. Kawyn really took his time going through sections of the menu describing items from food prep, appearance, temperature and taste. Having come from the server industry myself, I really appreciated that he took the time to do this after we ordered our cocktails. The rest of the serving and bussing staff was nice and professional. When our dessert was accidentally ordered out early as we were still on our entree, the server said that he would bring it back to the kitchen and bring us out another one when we are ready for it. Plate setting was nice with classy heavy duty looking place mat and utensil were still looking brand new. 

My orange vodka sunsplash was very well done with simple garnishes and my girlfriend was please that her lemondrop was ""the best that she has ever had!"" 
Grilled Kale Salad tasted great and came in a good portion size for sharing between two with enough to take home. 
Braised Ox Tail Crostini had just the right crunchyness to it and was cut to a good portion size for neat and classic dining. (I wish it was 4 pieces instead of 3)
Our Manhattan Style Bread Pudding was done just right and did not have an overwhelming amount of whiskey taste to it. 

A lot of other items went out to other tables that looked very appealing. I will be back. 

Bathrooms had bright yellow retro looking doors that really popped. There was also a photo booth on the way to the bathroom where you can take pictures. Great idea, sadly it couldn't print our picture yesterday. Wide open space and design on wall was tasteful.

Libertine Social is located in the restaurant row of Mandalay Bay next to Aureole and across from Kumi. Colonel Klink read about it and we headed over after drinks in Eye Candy. 

Room is huge, ""this is a gymnasium"" said the Sprossling, and the walls are covered with interesting objet d'art. The waiters have a rabbit pin on their ties, and there was some story about a guy and his living room, but I'm not sure we caught it (could be on us for we had some cocktails beforehand). I would like to know more about the concept. Maybe on the menu? Edited to add correction by the Colonel that he heard the whole story so I guess only I was drunk.

We were seated and immediately looked over the drinks. Colonel Klink got one of the adorable bottled drinks, ZigZag, which was pink and had a chunk of watermelon sticking up. I tasted but am not a good judge as it was following a Manhattan I brought with me; but he was pleased and the presentation was adorable. The Colonel meanwhile got a Margarita with mezcal, and was happy. The margarita was served 'long drink' fashion, an FYI for the purists out there. 

I regret to report I did not get our waiter's name but he was friendly and attentive throughout, as was all of the service. The Sprossling was wowed at how his Pepsi sugar bottle was whisked away the moment it was empty. The Sprossling agrees with the first commenter, looking around at one point and saying, ""the service is ON POINT."" 

I collected the desired order and we had, as a table: 

Belgian fries with aioli -- very good sauce
Coal charred Irish corn -- my favorite of the night for unusual flavor
Chilled grilled prawns -- firm, tasty, a tad salty
Sausage board -- not sure I got all of them, I think merguez was best
Shaved ham flatbread -- pineapple was a bit too present in sauce, threw off balance but it was a far better thing than the original 'devil's pizza' as that particular combo is referred to in our house. 
Ahi tuna in tiny cones -- adorable and tasty, have I seen before?
Crab dip -- I feel like spinach could be chopped finer, and blended better, the crab really only came to the fore after it had been mixed up by eaters at the table, also maybe serve hot? ETA not being sarcastic here, we are thinking the shallow ramekins may have let it cool down super quickly....

Finally we had for dessert margarita donuts -- a tad salty -- and the other winner of the night the Negroni, a panna cotta with Campari gel and plums, truly novel and tastebud entertaining. I enjoyed that with an espresso and a lemon twist teleported to me upon request by the seamless service.

Despite the very small quibbles everyone left happy and agreed that we could theoretically eat there every night for the rest of our stay!",P-uo7wtFEyA3xTZMqbDyBg,5,5,5,iF7r8se4CGy7qpT05rhvIg

Bartender told me that will be added soon. (It's the little things I tell ya). I was able to interact with all three bartenders and they know their shit!

Food!!!! Jose pointed out his favorites and told us that everything was good. So we chose a couple that he suggested and a couple that caught our eye. Let me tell you.... He wasn't lying... Everything was good!!!

Skirt steak- I'm sure it doesn't say it on the menu, but it's accompanied with a chimichuri sauce!!! 

Corn- roasted and whipped with an Irish butter!!

Wilted spinach flatbread- if you like burrata... You'll love this. 

Parmesan churros- has a different taste than I expected, but it was amazing

Warm crab dip- actually had large pieces of crab (no small, maybe it's crab, maybe it's not pieces)

Chocolate martini- it's desert inspired by cocktails! It's rich and yummy

It was a slow night for them, there were only a few tables when we arrived around 7pm. We were greeted and sat  immediately, hostess was very friendly and sweet. Love the decoration of the restaurant, very modern, chic, variety of decor around the wall, very cool place to sit and have some drinks. Our server was great, very friendly, made drinks and food recommendations, came back to check up on us several time, service was on point, drinks were always re-filled, no problem with service at all. 

Now the food...they have a few interesting items, our server told us that we ordered all their signature items which are also their most popular ones. We were informed that their menu is meant to be family style so we shared everything:

Marinated Tuna Cones -  average item, very bland, not much flavors, not worth the price. 

Modern Fried Egg was very interesting to try, very small portion for $12 per egg; warm egg yolk on the bottom, corn pudding, then caviar on top served with brioche. This was the most interesting item on the menu, was not sure what I was eating at first, overall tasty but not completely satisfying. 

Braised Oxtail Crostini - the most flavorful appetizer, topped with onions, slices of radish, the sauce as very flavorful, good item to try.

Foie Gras Mousse - light foie gras flavor, topped with some kind of sweet jelly like ""sauce,"" served with slices of pear and crostini. The mouse was very smooth and creamy, not too fatty in flavors to where you get sick of it. We did ask for more crostini since the jar of mouse was pretty big for just 3 slices of crostini. 

Salt Roasted Beets - similar to other beets salad - delicious but not much different from beet salads from other places. 

Sausage board - 3 different types of sausage served with pickled peppers and sauerkraut, nothing special here either. 

Lastly we ordered their special for the night, which was Wagu steak with stroganoff sauce on top served with shitaki mushroom. This dish was delicious, the meat was tender and flavorful, cooked perfectly! 

Overall, I enjoyed the dinner but was not crazy impressed. For the price of some of the items, the food should be more impressive. I have had tastier and more interesting food at the same price point, none of items stood out to me and make me go ""WOW."" Having said that, service was awesome, the restaurant is pretty, they have a nice drink menu.

This is currently my favorite place to eat, drink, and hangout at Mandalay! I just realized that I love gastropubs and will be adding Libertine to the list.

The food menu changes because they are farm to table (which I appreciate and love) so if you're a yelper like me scrolling through photos, you won't find dishes that are the same because it depends on what is in season.

We sat at the bar and ordered: 

oysters (West Coast) - a must try, sweet and delicious 
beet salad - refreshing
fried olives - to die for!

Service was impeccable. Everyone we encountered was smiling and kind.  The bartenders are so friendly and happy! It's contagious. For me, this speaks volumes about the establishment and how they treat their employees.  

I absolutely love the decor, ambience, and the fact that there's an open kitchen area where you can sit and watch the professionals in action. The back of the restaurant features a wall of glass overlooking the Mandalay Beach. 

There's only one bathroom each for men and women but the rooms are huge. You can fit like 20 people in there. Seriously! But only one toilet, haha.

Nick, the general manager stopped by to say hello and was so gracious as to comp a couple of drinks for us before our Bash at the Beach concert at the Mandalay Beach (thanks to my friend, Ashley, for the connection). Unfortunately, we had to decline because we both were not drinking that night but we were very gracious of the kind offer.

I would definitely recommend this spot. Reminds me a lot of the type of establishments you'd find in NYC. Great food, strong drink menu, and service as it should be. 

An A+ gastropub in my eyes and 5 stars !",--ZNfWKj1VyVElRx6-g1fg,1,2,5,pivOU17IAsb_qk8IQaVd4Q

The only reason I have to give this place 4 stars instead of five is because the king crab strawberry gazpacho was horrid, I mean like... kin to vomit. It was beautifully served, little whip of avocado paste on top slice of king crab was thick and impressive and then came the strawberry liquid.- now I love strawberries but something went horribly wrong there.

I don't mind paying extra for quality but sadly even with this coupon it hurt me to pay. We ordered the pretzel and cheese sauce plate appetizer $18 wow SALT!

My husband and I were so hungry & don't like to send food back so  we ate most of it and washed it down with water. Their menu is somewhat limited compared to many restaurants. We decided to order the burger as we had seen it on some list online of top vegas burgers. When the food arrived it looked and smelled delicious!! We took one bite and to our great disappointment it too was salty. Idk if the chef/person who made our burger cant taste food anymore or is a long term smoker but we were so bummed. I could tell the burger had good flavors and was quality but the salt  we didn't finish our burgers and were so over the place we just wanted to leave.

I especially loved the beet salad. The beets were a yellow variety that they were very tender and subtle. The pork belly was one of the best I have ever had. 

The reason I'm giving this restaurant four stars is for two reasons:

1) The entrées came out cold. Unfortunately we did not have time to have them re-fire it because we were trying to catch a show. They were very favorable and I'm not sure why they would have left the kitchen cold.

Apple Cobbler Cocktail - gin, Apple cider juice, ginger syrup, cucumber/lemon juices - so refreshing 
Pirate Punch - rum based tropical delight. My hubby loved this so much he had 2-3 of these!
Boulevardier -will kick your a$&! 

Food sound good?
Ahi tuna cones - phenomenal to me. I don't know why but just like eating a spicy ahi roll with the little tempura flakes on top, having ahi (but non spicy) in a pastry like cone is just a whole other level of awesome.

Black truffle pizza - I love truffles. This is spendy because there are actual slices of black truffle instead of a traditional topping like pepperoni but it's good. These pizzas are definitely Jen sized which means they're personal sized which means you'll probably be hungry if you eat this alone but it's still worth trying if you love truffles as much as I do.

The short rib crostini app - flavorful and good! Perfect for sharing between 2 people!

Burger with fries - we were drinking so this seemed really good but we had it after being buzzed so not sure if it knocked our socks off (or I guess flip flops off) or it was indeed really good. You be the judge.

While waiting for food is of course going to happen on a busy evening, the waitstaff was friendly and highly efficient when it came to everything else, from water to ordering and right down to getting the check.

Food was AHH-mazing! The short ribs (with Thai seasoning; also worth noting that this ""small plate"" had at least five pieces of flavorful meat), BBQ carrots (unexpected knockout!), and American prosciutto board (perfect balance of savory and sweet cured meat with cornbread and maple butter) came together to be an haute spin on American classics--great for right before our country concert! We admittedly did not try cocktails because we were planning on imbibing later in the evening, but that's now another reason to go back to Libertine Social :)

Ambience/decor was trendy without being stuffy or unwelcoming. Dare I say it was tastefully cozy? And the ""dare"" cards on the table make for a fun distraction while waiting for food.

3332870,2017-01-14,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"I thought everything was fantastic.  The food was incredible, the drinks were strong and remarkably tasty, and the feeling at the restaurant was just very upbeat and lively.  To begin we had wine and a bourbon based pre made cocktail. I really liked the ingenuity of the cocktail where you're given a bottle instead of having to wait for the crafting each time. We then had the tuna cones, mushroom flatbread, and the brussel sprout salad. The ahi cones had a nice kick with the sauce and the presentation was awesome. The flatbread had more of a pizza feel than your typical flatbread which I enjoyed tremendously. The brussel spirit salad was a nice side with whole pieces of bacon and apple rather than sprinkled as per usual. I like this heartier rendition better. The ambiance of the bar is really nice and the staff were great. I really wish I had a casual bar like this closer to my house on the west side. Prices are very high so it's not a weekly dining venue, but I highly recommend trying it out if you're looking for a new cocktail bar with amazing food on the strip.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,5,u8uK00YctzD9yqDirNAszQ

3356456,2016-11-06,1,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"They are still new, so they may still be going through some growing pains, however there is not much here that warrants your attention. We tried several of their small bite options as these are usually more flavorful than the entrees, thus we can't really comment on the larger entrees. However, with the exception of the braised oxtail crostini, everything seemed a bit off. We wanted to try the duck pastrami and the coal charred corn, but alas they were not there the evening we dined here.

The braised oxtail crostini was the most flavorful bite of the evening. The oxtail was braised well and had the luxurious feel of collagen that you get from oxtail. There were some pickled onions on top which added a nice sweet and tart note to the dish. Overall, it was the most successful dish of the night, with the exception that the bread upon which it was served was very bland and lacking any character.

The warm Dungeness crab dip sounded good, but alas it was lacking in crab flavor and a bit fishier than we are used to. Good Dungeness crab should be delicate and sweet. It was creamy as expected, but the flavors were overwhelmed by the spinach. Perhaps, a little less spinach (as in none) would have allowed you to taste the Dungeness crab, which really should have been the star of the show. Again, the toast chips that came with the dish were underwhelming and bland, so we ended up just skipping the toast chips.

My wife was excited about the caramelized fennel and sausage flatbread, however again, there was something lacking in the execution. Fennel sausage is usually very good, but here it was lacking in flavor. In addition, the camembert that was on the flatbread tasted almost like goat cheese and overwhelmed the sausage, so that you end up tasting more cheese flavor than the fennel sausage. Given the overwhelming cheese flavor, the dish would have been better served if it was paired with more sweet notes, such as the addition of caramelized onions or even an onion jam.

Of the dishes I was looking forward to the most was the house made soft pretzel. I have a special place in my heart for home made soft pretzels and baking fresh pretzels at home fills the place with the warm flavors of butter and yeast. Given all this, I was especially disappointed with the soft pretzels. It had a good crisp exterior with some crystals of salt, however the inside had no flavor whatsoever. There wasn't any of the warm presence of yeasted dough. This was made more evident by the raclette fondue, as it is a more pungent cheese thus overwhelming the flavorless soft pretzel.

The salt roasted beets were also disappointing, especially given that roasted beets are usually so full of flavor and sweetness. The main problem here is the salt roasting process. While it might work for whole fish, with its protective layer of skin, salt roasting beets end up saturating the beets with salt, almost to the point that it is inedible. Perhaps, the beets would have been better served if they were rinsed before serving. The only bright note in this dish was the appearance of oranges which really helped to offset the overly salted beets with some needed brightness and sweetness.

Given the lackluster dinner, we decided to skip out on dessert, instead heading over to Sweets Raku to try them out.

All in all, the food looks good here, but there were many missteps in execution that should make you wary and try some of the other more seasoned places around town.",izLeU7SgRLNA0QLiBEYbYA,0,0,2,pV9bw1bLbJawwYkN5jXAOw

We grabbed a booth in the main restaurant area and perused the menus. Not a huge lunch menu but the burger sounded good. After ordering some beers, our food arrived. The plate was quite warm which was great for the burger but my side salad did not belong on a hot plate. The salad was basically lettuce but it was decent enough. Eating something green in Las Vegas should count for bonus points. The burger was pretty small for $20. The bun was tasty but was so soft that it basically collapsed in my hand. It was greasy, too. The beef and toppings were pretty tasty but really nothing noteworthy. We split an order of fries with garlic aioli. I was expecting a large plate with a light sauce, but we got was a very small plate of fries with a small cup of ketchup and a small cup of the aioli dip. Decent enough, but nothing great.

ATMOSPHERE: 
Fun, upscale, hip and spacious. Definitely a date night kinda spot, I love how spacious the restaurant is, you can go with a large group of friends and not feel cramped. We sat at the bar to catch a game.

FOOD:
Very nice menu for my epicurious people out there! So much variety and unique dishes on the menu, I know I'd like to return to try different dishes. Had the crab dip, which was delish not too overpowering but still flavorful. Spinach flatbread was cooked perfectly, but I wasn't blown away with the flavor, and got fries  (can't go wrong there) with a killer garlic aioli. I was most impressed with the presentation of the dishes here, nothing was over the top but it also caught my eye, they walk the fine line just right. And now the cocktails, the margarita was definitely too sweet, but I didn't mind, the lemon drop was perfect I could smell the lemon zest even when the drink wasn't near me quite aromatic. Probably the best lemon drop I've had made by a bartender. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Nice staff, friendly, and attentive for sure. The bartenders were great giving me directions on how to find the events center and were just great bartenders period.

We came in right when it opened so it wasn't busy. Pretty comfortable, modern, ambience. I eat pretty much vegan style so I asked the waitress about vegan options. She recommended the hummus platter & also they can alter anything on the menu to make it vegan like eliminating any cheese or dairy in a dish etc. 

I ended up ordering the broccoli appetizer & hummus platter which tasted really good. My husband got the pretzel without cheese but they still put out a side of cheese just in case lol We also ordered a flat bread with tomato sauce, mushrooms & olives & potato dish. We got the hummus platter & pretzel & got full so fast. Between the two of us, we are lightweight consumers.

It was taking quite awhile to get the other dishes so luckily as we were waiting, my husband brought a lil medical mj chocolate bar from the dispensary the other day to hold him off. While we waited, we ended up getting full. The restaurant started filling up & our view of the basketball game that was blocked. 

 The waitress finally came out & said that the potato dish we ordered comes with butter & asked if he still wanted it & we were like no thank you. She should have asked us that when she took our order but at the same time we were actually relieved because we were already full. I asked about the other dish & she said it was coming out soon. 

Everything was pretty good there. The service was just a bit slow but maybe she was having a bad day or because it looked like business was starting to pick up.

My wife got one of the fizzes(Milano) and I ordered a glass of Pinot Gris which were fine.  The small plates we ordered where the Cheese Board and the Prosciutto Board.  The Cheese board was what we considered to be about average but the Prosciutto Board was an odd combination because it had a maple butter, a syrup on the meat and cornbread with it and the combination just didn't work at all.  Too much sweet and not enough to balance it out.    

Jose had said that they just changed that dish and it used to have a grilled bread as a side which would have been a better pairing.

The menu is funky and they had some amazing options. I'm mostly vegan but they didn't have many vegan options- of course- I could alter recipes if I wanted but I just didn't want another plain salad or hummus.  We did order the hummus for an appetizer and it was good. But I had hummus the night before. 

I opted to go off the map and I ordered the Branzino filet with caper vinegarette. It's fish. Yes I know.  I'm not a true vegan. Whatever. The fish was ah-may-zing!!!  The flavor in the skin and the buttery meat was Delish. I ordered a side of asparagus with it (less the ham and egg garnish). I didn't need it. The fish was plentiful and flavorful. (I even thought about not reviewing and posting because I ordered fish for the fear of ridicule.) 

My coworkers ordered the braised short rib (both) and they raved about the dish and the portion size. 

I'm giving 4 stars for the noise level and for the timing of the meal. We hadn't even finished our appetizer (maybe 1/3 of it) and our entrees came out.

My last stop for the two weeks of RW was at Libertine Social and it was a good choice.  I ordered:

Caviar fried egg
House made cavatelli pasta
Black and tan pudding

The caviar fried egg was a small appetizer but luscious!  The salt of the caviar mixed with the egg white foam and the whipped yolk was an amazing combination.  Following this came the house made cavatelli pasta with fava beans, mint, crushed tomatoes and parmesan.  Very tasty and filling pasta.

For dessert, the ""Black and Tan"" pudding was made of Dutch chocolate and butterscotch pudding and served with salted caramel corn.  The combination of salt with the pudding was excellent.

The restaurant is quite noisy.  I was seated in the back which shielded me from some of the Happy Hour crowd of conventioneers but the whole place has a very vibrant atmosphere.

My server, Karen B was excellent.  She gave advice when I asked about a choice of which I was unsure and she was right on all the time.

I've got a fever and the only prescription is more Spicy Tuna cones and scotch olives.  Food can transport you and evoke so many memories. If you grew up in the South on that government cheese, then you are probably familiar with a chuck wagon patty.  That is what these scotch olives reminded me of in the very best way. My sister and I bit into one and were instantly transported to our childhood. 

It wasn't until my second trip that I worked up the nerve  to try the truffle pizza. As a general rule, I find truffles overpowering and somewhat unpleasant. Until I tried this pizza. I. Am. Still. Speechless.  The pizza perfectly balances the egg, truffles and crust which add up to a perfect flavor combination. You must try this pizza.

Libertine Social is an A+ across the board. I plan on being a repeat customer.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,1,1,5,6vnaPNBYIx9LD6ed-fypIA

4063944,2016-12-11,2,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,This place is located inside Mandalay Bay. I came for lunch and tried a flatbread pizza for around $16. Interior decoration and vibe here deserves 5 stars (but food a 3). Everything is very modern and trendy. Their cutlery were not your average silver color. They were a bronze-brown ish color. They had Persian rugs on the floor and super cool looking light-fixtures. Waitresses wear Crocs heels and food service is a bit slow. The fennel sausage pizza tasted just ok. The toppings were completely great and up my alley but the bread itself was chewy and dry. I didn't get their cocktails but would come back again for them because they looked really tasty (check out their fizzles and social swizzles menu!).,I9vkjKs1O5Ctf5gy0ry4yg,3,2,4,6TTjhPrpIqTd7jXXc0ofxQ

The bar pizza with wilted spinach and Burrata cheese may be one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  It was like eating a tasty cloud. Not all Burrata is equal. I'd like to know who their supplier is.  Stopped in for drinks and food before the Dave Chappelle show. No pictures as no phone allowed at the show. It was on my list. It was better than I expected.

We shared the gnochhi in parmesan broth with mushrooms - they were light, fluffy, and unctuous! We also shared two orders of the crispy octopus salad (see photo). The octopus was perfectly cooked and charred and the accompaniments were Mediterranean in nature: eggplant, a puree, greens. Paired with a nice chardonnay, it was the perfect mean before going to the show. Ambiance is modern yet comfortable.

Pros:
Excellent drink selections - for beer/wine/mixed drinks
Great service
Delicious food

Cons:
Price, but it is located near the convention center, so what isn't pricey? Had a hard time paying $10 for a beer, even though it was delicious.

I went here for dinner with a group of 20 or so. Great selection of drinks. Food was also delicious. It was all served family style. There was only one item that I would probably not get again. Below is what we had.

- Marinated Ahi Tuna Cones - Unique and delicious!
- Grilled Kale Salad - Not our favorite. THis is the only item we wouldn't get again.
- Whole Petaluma Chicken - Wow! Awesome flavor.
- Wagyu Skirt Steak - Another winner. Just melts in your mouth.
- Whole Roasted Fish - Not sure what fish it was but it was tasty.
-Barbecued Carrots - Have had something like this before, but this would make me always eat my veges!
- Coal-Charred Corn - Another really tasty dish and its corn!
- Margarita Donut - Not the best donut I have had but it was unique.

Over seasoned. And the cheese grits where more like a soup in the bottom of the pot it was served in. Mustard greens where blah. Got a side of mashed potatoes- they were inedible.

4389260,2016-10-26,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"One of my two favorite restaurants in Las Vegas with a fun and creative menu!! 

I opted to sit at the chefs table since I was dining alone. Christopher, my fabulous waiter, had excellent food recommendations.

I started with the Marinated tuna cones that were artfully presented in a stand. The cone included whipped pink peppercorn creme fresh which created a little spicy zing.

I next had the Braised oxtail crostini. Toast dishes seem to be all the rage in Vegas right now and this dish did not disappoint. The oxtail was tensor and flavorful.

The final dish I tried was the Salt roasted beets. Sounds boring but it was not!! The beets were roasted in oranges, pistachio oil and goat cheese that made for a creamy and dreamy sauce that made me want to lick the plate. It was probably the best best dish I've ever had!

There were 5 sparking wines, white wines and red wines to choose from. My only complaint is that most were $19 a glass!!!

The restaurant is very open space wise and not ideal for a romantic dinner. Given the small plate nature of the dishes it's perfect for groups so that you can try lots of different things.

There was a five minute wait without reservations on a Saturday night at around 7 pm. 

The small plates are remarkable.  I had the smoked ricotta gnudi, which were dumplings made with ricotta with semolina. The sauce had peas and mushrooms. They were topped with lamb prosciutto They were a new experience for me and they were sublime. 
 
I had some of the warm crab dip.  The crab had a lot of flavor. 

I also had the American Artisanal Cheeses, which came with grilled country bread, roasted grapes, almonds and a fruit preserves.  The cheeses were a triple cream Brie, Lincoln Log, which is a mild goat cheese, and a hard cheese whose name I didn't catch.  Delicious and recommended. 

For my main, I had the braised lamb shank pot pie.  I was pretty full at this point, but it was good.  The English peas were a highlight. 

Where mistakes were made were the side plates.  The grilled calcot onions were good, but the romesco was the star.  The sauce had hazelnuts, roasted red peppers, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar.  

Someone else ordered the Barbecued Carrots.  The one I had was burnt, chewy and stringy.  

The desserts looked really good, but I was stuffed.

I loved the fresh watermelon and thought the balance of all the ingredients blended together deliciously for a very crispy, slightly sweet flavor. We then shared the spicy tuna cones (2/5) and warm crab dip (3/5). I loved the uniqueness of the cones, but they were just waaaay too salty for my liking. The crab dip was good and flavorful, but just missing that little extra something to make it a 5. The main course for us, the wagyu skirt steak, definitely a 5/5. The meat was so tender and seasoned perfectly. I couldn't get enough of the salsa verde. Absolutely amazing! The side of mashed Yukon gold potatoes were also a 5/5 for me.

Looking out onto the general dining area, there are traditional dining tables, as well as (taller) pub tables with stools. They also have a lounge area with large stuffed chairs and sofas.

For example, if you are there for business and want to have a drink with colleagues, you might choose to sit in the lounge area, versus traditional tables. But as nice as the place looks, it does come down to the food and service.

My only disappointment was the dinner. I ordered the ""Roasted Day Boat Scallops"". I would say the presentation was good, and the plate appeared nice. The basic taste would have been good--except for the fact that there was the very light, beginning of an ammonia taste.

All the dishes we tried were delicious. My favorite was the oysters on the half shell, which were served with a wonderfully flavorful mignonette. We also tried, and loved, the broccoli, the cauliflower, the beet salad, the spinach flatbread, and the prosciutto/cornbread board.

The only item I was disappointed with was the restaurant's signature cocktail--The Libertine Social. It just didn't work for me. I probably should have focused more on the ingredient list (""Will I really like Campari with limoncello, orange juice, and egg white?"") before I ordered it.

The service throughout our meal was exemplary. We arrived slightly before 6 p.m. on Sunday night, and we let the hostess and the server know right away that we had tickets for the 7 p.m. Blue Man show at the Luxor. They not only ensured that we got our food very quickly, so that we actually had time to enjoy eating it, but they also let the manager know, and he stopped by to make sure that the service was meeting our time constraints. I was impressed and appreciative.

Two final notes: First, like almost every other restaurant on the Strip these days, Libertine Social's prices are high. The signature cocktail was $17. For two of us, each having one cocktail, sharing a half dozen oysters and one salad, two sides, one flat bread, and a board, the total bill, including tax, was $138. We were happily stuffed, but this is not bargain dining. Second, Libertine Social accepts MLife Express Comps, which is happy news for gamblers who like to eat well. The staff also knows that the restaurant accepts Express Comps, and the payment process was quick and easy (MLife players will know that this is not the case at every restaurant that accepts Express Comps).",nEABfoTu6n6qvLRD2_mX1w,2,0,5,IMxKhyZYfZfmTLdiZ8_LFQ

5094888,2017-10-10,22,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Self proclaimed ""next generation gastropub"".  Does it deliver?

- Replace the beer with a killer list of brown libations and seriously crafted cocktails.
- Replace the been there, done that, prettied up pub grub with in your face, up end, back yard BBQ.
- Toss in some rabbits in the decor (although there are none to eat on the menu).

In a word, yes.

Note:  This is social dining, order dishes in flights and share.

In general, flavors are very bold.  Sharp acidic contrast in flavors, spicy elements in dishes that will make you sweat, and underlying pleasant smoke throughout (hints of smoke permeate the restaurants so even if your dish doesn't have direct smoke flavor, you will still taste it).  Go for the bold.  You will be rewarded.

The octopus crostini exemplifies the style.  Loaded with tender slices of octopus, it is sat on a spicy, smoky roasted eggplant puree with bits of tart, pickled peppers and golden raisins.  Smack you in the face flavor that just works with any drink.

A ""board"" of wood grilled sausages packs a spicy punch, accented by grilled spicy peppers on a very acidic, tart, sauerkraut.  It sets your mouth on fire but the flavor of the individual sausages is impressive epically the merguez with its distinct lamb flavor and Northern African spice notes.

For larger plates, top props to the mesquite grilled whole branzino.  Blistered, charred skin adds a bitter component that makes the mildly sweet flesh of the fish come to life.  Flavors are boosted even further with a tangy olive and caper vinaigrette and slices of grilled lemon.  Very good.  

Steak lovers, it's all about the grilled wagyu skirt.  A great butchers cut, loaded with beefy flavor.  The smokiness brings out the sweetness.  A salsa verde enhances the natural metallic flavors of the beef.

Excellent cocktail program.  Well chosen list of craft cocktails backed up by a huge list of brown libations (there is a second high end bar in the back of the restaurant for those wanting to savor these treasures including the impossible to find Pappy's 20).  Typical resort markup.

Service is friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.

I won't lie, I did go in expecting a mesquite grilled rabbit.  Alas.  I'll have to settle for these other flavorful dishes.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,30,28,4,tSRL4YWziIpVy5V8OIoWjg

5225060,2017-09-28,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"While staying at Mandalay Bay myself and two friends tried out the new Gastropub, Libertine Social for the first time. I had been wanting to experience this small plate eatery since learning that it was helmed by Sage chef Shawn McClain. Sage is famous for its farm to table, locally sourced menu. Sage is in my top five Las Vegas restaurants, so a visit to L.S. was a must do. The emphasis here is what I would call Sage Light with many menu items coming from the bright and shiny wood fired grill (the aroma was amazing). We started off with Feta and lamb stuffed Scotch Olives, 24 hour braised Porchetta, and Fois Gras Mousse with berry mostada and country toast. All were exceptional. Two of us had 8 oz. filet mignon cooked on the mesquite wood fired grill with roasted Maitake mushrooms and Béarnaise. The steaks were as good as any I've had in Las Vegas and perfectly cooked! My other friend had the seared Day Boat Scallops with  roasted peach purée, Lardo, and Calabrian Chili Vinaigrette. They were delicious but a lot spicer than expected in a good way. Delicious! The side vegetable was the dish we couldn't stop talking about. Wood grilled broccoli with Taleggio cream, wow! Too much food to order dessert, and the bill came to $211 plus tax. The cocktail program is by Tony Abou-Ganim who designed Bellagio's original bar menu's and many others around town. The drinks looked spectacular.

We popped down around 7pm on a Saturday without any reservations and were able to get a seat in their lounge area, which overlooks the interior of the hotel walkway (great people watching). (Note: We were here only a week or so after it opened so I assume it will get busier).

I can't get over the décor here, I loved everything about it. Very ""now""...with a mix of art installations (make sure to look up if at the bar), mixed metals and natural wood elements. The food is geared more towards appetizers and small bites for sharing versus personal larger entrees. They have a mix of cocktails as well, they even do something where the mix and pre-bottle some cocktails. I tried one...it was interesting, it didn't seem as fresh to me but I honestly can't tell you if that was more of a mental thing.

5279617,2017-02-13,6,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Impressed by Shawn McClain since his Green Zebra days back in Chicago, a meal at Sage shortly after it opened confirming that his elegant simplicity could indeed translate to the Las Vegas market
(though Five-50 Pizza later proved to be a half-baked Money Grab,) rumors of Libertine Social at Mandalay Bay being the first Casino restaurant in ages to challenge Gastro-Pub conformity by way of ingredients and technique finally lured me in almost exactly six months after it's opening August 8th
2016 opening.

Not immune to the advertising or PR push, an invite to the grand-opening by Kerry Clasby politely declined as 2016 was dedicated to supporting more longstanding restaurants both on the Strip and in the community, it was as a party of two that dinner on Friday was enjoyed amidst spacious confines where guests are invited to sit at the bar, lounge or dining room in back, a plethora of decorations ranging from street signs to old-LPs decorating the walls as music plays forgivingly lightly.

Certainly a spectacle, the outdoor patio and well-stocked bar both showcasing design as low lighting generates an intimate feel despite the restaurant's size, the menu and kitchen at Libertine Social are the responsibility of Executive Chef Jamaal Taherzadeh, his modern American cuisine ranging from fun to seriously technique-oriented while vegetables from the Intuitive Forager Farmers Markets stand unparalleled on their own, or when used to enhance the flavor of everything from Pastas and Flatbreads to roasted Meats.

Well celebrated for Cocktails crafted by Tony Abou-Ganim, the classics perhaps a bit pricey given their nearby ubiquity while the Fizzes, Draught, Barrel-Aged and Bottled lists all show a lot of thought, those fond of Gin are encouraged to take a look at the refreshing Apple Cobbler with a clean Cucumber finish while Vodka fans will undoubtedly be delighted by a frothy Milano that is Spirit-forward and bright with a whole lot of Citrus.

Partially deferring to Chef Taherzadeh and adding a few intriguing items along the way, guests enjoying a drink would be foolish to ignore the Scotch Olives pitted and packed with Cheese beneath a lightly fried Lamb Sausage Crust, the laser-cut Modern Fried Egg a vessel seen several times in the past but here better than most with creamy Corn Pudding blanketed in Egg Custard beneath a dollop of Caviar.

Taking the extra steps to pour a chilled Watercress Soup tableside over King Crab Salad before having some fun with airy, flavor-packed Churros that will make fans of Cheetos question why they've been fooled into thinking the snack was as good as it gets for so long, a different sort of upgrade is delivered by 'Shrimp n' Grits' that improves on both with snappy Prawns and creamy Polenta plus the savory heat of Chorizo.

Turning attention to some Boards, Spreads and Dips, the Pretzels puffy and piping hot alongside house Mustard and melted Raclette, more Crab comes by way of the creamed Spinach Dip studded with big chunks of the good stuff flown in daily from Alaska while the Duck Liver Mousse at first appears to be far too much for even a party of four until the air is stirred out of it and the bright Fig-Balsamic Glaze on top turns it into the city's most luxurious PB&J-reminiscent topping for Grilled Bread.

Placing two handmade Pastas on the menu, one old and the other new, Jamaal admits that the tender Lamb Neck served over Cavatelli is his dish most often taken home for dinner, the salting intense even when accounting for the mellowing effect of Ricotta while the Sweet Potato Agnolotti rival any Italian restaurant in town by placing the typical Sage and Brown Butter in a different context with softened Pears and toasty brown Pesto.

Mistakenly guessing the sweet and savory duet of Honey-drizzled Fennel and Sausage Flatbread plus Barbecued Carrots atop earthy Kohlrabi Puree as the final round before dessert, and thus overindulging in both as they each exemplify the pure, honest flavors familiar to followers of Chef McClain, it was with wide eyes that the kitchen presented two more entrée-sized plates including Sea Bass quite similar to that at Aureole next door (minus the head) plus a daily special of Medium-Rare Wagyu brightened by acid with a bit of heat and Black Truffles plus an outstanding side of ""Local Fare"" featuring wrinkly Fingerling happily soaking up the flavors of two types of Pork carried by a soft-poached Egg. 

Taking a Double Espresso over Ice next, the choice of Cubes vs. Pellets a nice touch, dessert was presented with two menu-favorites plus the all-new Black and Tan Pudding, a refreshing savory note imparted by the Cream in a tall glass while neither the Pie nor Bread Pudding were overly sweet, instead focusing on letting the ingredients shine on their own with the Maraschino Cherry Ice Cream playing particularly well off the Whiskey in replicating the classic flavors of a Manhattan Cocktail.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,10,5,-_tnH20GBsR6N4B93IZ_9g

The highly-recommended short ribs, which was our waiter's ""favorite dish"", were bland and dry (at $48).    The Libertine Burger was just a smashed bun surrounding a burger and grilled onions - nothing else to it, no sauce, no flavor, nothing (at $28).  And the Roasted Petaluma Chicken came partly fried.  Right next to a very delicious roasted breast of chicken were three sprigs of overcooked broccoli and a pile of charred bits of fried mess.  The fried mess was apparently the rest of the chicken, a thigh hacked into pieces, battered and burned to a crisp in a deep fryer.  At first, I wasn't even sure it was part of the meal or some kind of weird garnish.  As I began chipping away at the chunks of charcoal, I found the greasy bits of chicken hiding in the pile.

Make a reservation and be sure they honor it... In general I recommend Open Table reservations for all restaurants in Vegas because it's so easy to use and get (and never worth waiting when there are so many restaurant options in town).  Be careful that they honor your reservation, when we attended they attempted to put us at a bar.  The hostess seating us (different from the one that greeted us) let us know that their dining room was fully committed and that the bar was all they had.  We know it was committed, we had a reservation, right?  When we highlighted this, we were fairly quickly given a table but certainly not at the greeting hostess' delight.

What really matters, the food:  The burger was very good, just be prepared for a two patty burger that is very filling.  The Lobster Ravioli was one of the best I've seen in Vegas.  Expensive but made up for it with lots of lobster.  The filling was primarily lobster and corn.  The ""Black and Tan"" pudding was dark chocolate and butterscotch.

My co-habby and I made the long trek up to Vegas to see Janet Jackson and show our support to the fallen and Vegas residents from the devastating shootings that took place 2 weeks prior. Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected.

Although I loved the decor and ambience of Libertine Social, I was not impressed by our server that day. While she was friendly at the beginning, she seemed perturbed that we didn't immediately order alcohol with our food. We were still undecided on what we wanted to drink and instead of asking if we wanted more food/beverages, she proceeded to swipe our menu and give it to someone else; didn't even ask if she we needed anything else, just assumed we were done. And there was a menu at an empty table across from us too!! So much for the extra food, cocktail order and my hubby's beer we wanted! We were also expecting another guest and then another waitress decides to take our extra seat WITHOUT even asking us. RUDE MUCH? The only reason why I think our waitress started being nice after was because I was staring daggers at her.

The only saving grace was the gentleman who checked in on us and the Parmesan Churros which were to die for and melt in your mouth amazing. The flatbread was not bad either. Very happy with our food but very UNHAPPY with the service from our waitress...wish we had gone to the Sushi place across the way like we had originally planned. Lesson learned. Good food but terrible service.",DfOj2Jf4MlTQiF5TMHCm2g,7,2,2,RGEq53odOAMdqtEF6xR-9w
5669294,2017-04-09,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,I was in Vegas for work and took a coworker here since I happened to know someone who works here (thanks Mike) and it was amazing. Tried several appetizers and entrees- my favorites are the scallops and the ribs. Presentation was on point and the flavors danced on my tongue.

5677557,2017-08-22,2,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Libertine Social is a great place to grab a few appetizers before a show. We walked in (no wait) on a Friday evening around 5:30pm for drinks and appetizers before a show. It was very quiet, and we were seated away from everyone else. The atmosphere is very hip, with new and interesting drinks and dishes to choose from.

Between the four of us, we shared the following plates: House Baked Pretzel, Shaved American Prosciutto, Spare Ribs, and Grilled Gulf Shrimp. The consensus favorite was the house baked pretzel with the cheese fondue - I could have ordered a few of those and been satisfied. The ribs and shrimp were cooked really well. The prosciutto with melons was pretty standard. 

Overall, if you find yourself at this end of the strip or at Mandalay specifically, you should check out Libertine social. Great atmosphere and delicious food.",s1lSqHleEH3OLjUwy6tcYg,3,3,4,1TN_e7a-tFcI6b3rz2jq8w
5683995,2017-05-06,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,Poor service (server was understaffed or too busy to take care of us but he was very nice nonetheless) but the food is AMAZING! The crab dip was to die for (note: ask for side of lemon and pepper to intensify taste buds) truffle pizza amazing and tuna cones were great! Would be 5 stars if our server was a little attentive. Every time we had a question he would walk away midsentence. This place has lots of potential!,_UU2xBhC0AdcMjUrH7hirw,1,1,4,bVBFNyS2U51k_kbgWErmcw

Our First was days after October 1, and we wanted to give back to the local servers at Mandalay Bay. But since we had such an amazing time we brought our friends back for a double date..

The food is unique, fresh and something you will remember.. their hand crafted drinks are strong but very palatable, two rounds each and damn we were having a great time!",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,2,0,5,upiPiqc3-lcgUU032-UYlw

I see why. My wife and I sat at the bar in front of the kitchen. So we not only had a fantastic meal where every single thing we ordered was fantastic, we also got to enjoy watching the chefs at work. What a joy. We have been back a few times and can not wait to return. I apologize

5954195,2017-08-11,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Libertine Social is a great addition to the Mandalay Bay campus. After eating at the usual spots for few years while we attended annual conferences, we really needed a new place and Libertine Social offered that fresh vibe under the gastro pub identity but it's much more than that. 

It's an open concept restaurant with a lounge and a bar (they have their own 'Fireside Chat' menu) in the front and the dining room is in the back. While we were there for dinner they had a basketball game on in the lounge area so it's a very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. They are not greedy with space as they have comfy leather couches and arm chairs to relax with a drink.

Menu is all about shareable plates and the dishes from the mesquite-fired wood burning grill in the open kitchen. One of the most memorable and tastiest dishes was the Whole Roasted Branzino from the grill which was cooked to perfection. It can be easily shared between two people. If you are not in to seafood then go for the 10oz Wagyu or the bone-in ribeye, they are equally delicious. Some of the other notable dishes were the roasted chicken, seared scallops and the burger. Our group is not much in to salads or desserts but these got the favorite vote: Avocado Panzanella, Roasted Beets, Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble and the Margarita Donuts. 

Considering that we always ate at the Red Square, Aureole, RM Seafood and Lupo during a seven day conference,  this trip we ate at the Libertine Social on three separate occasions. One drawback was the unresponsive host station and somewhat slow service but I'll give them a break due to the few large parties eating at the same time as we were there including a very large party in the private room.

We hope to return next year, let's hope they'll stay as good as when we were there.

Enjoy!",HOLIgF2ByPKfXzA6l1_fjg,0,0,4,Mhse4A9OlR-J8NjpSfIveg
5954766,2016-09-21,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,"Came here during the soft opening, and I was very impressed. We ordered a little of everything...ahi tuna cones were delicious. Skirt steak, two thumbs up. The kale salad...so good. Avocado salad, yum! The modern egg was so good and something I would never typically order, but I'm glad that I did! Desserts were great, drink inspired. 
And of course, the drinks were on point. They bottle a few drinks so that was a nice personalization. 
If you're in the area this is a great spot to grab a drink and bite or have a culinary experience. 
The decor and atmosphere is fun, so definitely a great place to go with a group of friends.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,4,2,5,BO0O2udWoi72FxjkKN_CyA
5969398,2016-12-27,0,A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,What a great choice. We stumbled on in for a few appetizers and craft beer. We ended up getting the Braised Lamb with a Pomegranate sauce. Wow. Also the sweet potato Angoloti with a sage and olive oil sauce was bomb. Our server Alicia was very helpful in our beverage and food choices and always checked up shortly after every item arrived for complete guest service. A shot of espresso and house made limoncello went great with the bread pudding topped with maraschino ice cream. It was a nice little pit stop and I will definitely hit it up again when I go back to Vegas.,tePbkOx3Sq3u0bqjobwa8w,0,0,5,ixXgJ5r1wPJ1qCtzoqqZWQ
