They had french toast, sausage, bacon, steel cut oatmeal (really good with the nature valley bar pieces available), potatoes, pastries, smoked salmon, waffles, etc...etc... The honeydew seemed partially frozen, but they actually separated the pineapple from the other fruits (Thank God!), so kudos to them for doing that. Everything else I had was good. I was surprised that the regular price of breakfast here was ~$20 because nothing stood out as amazing, but for a free breakfast I can't complain.",WYNXicjK_V36OdXRDzeBvw,0,0,3,jEkg3OOFwCcRk2yQm79jLQ

It started off with the coupon you get in the mail: 3 course meal all for $20.09. It piqued my interest since JW Marriott is not a dump figured why not? 
We got there and immediately there was no one there on a weekend night 
When we got the bread basket it was warm and the assortment was good. But after taking a bite out of the cheese biscuit, olive bread, rolled wheat bread, and the rosemary bread the bread's quality was masked by the warmness. It was clearly old, but reheated. YUCK. 

I started to regret being enticed by the coupon, but decided let's give the food a try. 

A) Parsnip bisque: Canned soup would have tasted better. There was oil sitting on top of the soup! The flavor was too strong and it didn't have the right consistency a bisque should have. 
B) Salad: Most decent dish there. You can't go wrong here just need fresh lettuce, which there was a pile of. The dressing was too thick though. It tasted processed. 
At least the tomatoes and manchengo cheese sufficed. 
C) Salmon with baby potatoes: Salmon was overcooked and too salty. 
The other choice was a steak, which I also tasted to make sure I wasn't being too harsh of a critic..the steak was despicable. No flavor, overcooked. 
D) Dessert: Strawberry shortcake and Chocolate Mousse. 
Why even bother at this point? 
But I had to see...the desserts failed miserably too. 

The only highlight of the night was finding a new wine that I like:

I think that the buffet would have been a better deal, particularly since they have an omelet making station as part of the buffet!? Oh well. I ordered the asparagus, brie omelet. I thought that the asparagus was a bit tough - probably because it's not asparagus season. Would have liked to see a more seasonal menu. The brie was good in the omelet, but I think that I overall paid about the same had I gotten the buffet.

Went here for restaurant week, because it was the closest thing in a small window of time.  There was nothing too special about the meal, the scallops were overly gritty, the salmon was overcooked, the crab stuffed artichokes were under cooked, and only the desserts were worth coming back for.

Croissant sandwich w bacon avocado and egg and loved it as well. Excellent service from Monika, too. The only downside was the piano up by the hostess.

The service was good and attentive.  Our server always cleared the table as soon as we were about done and ready to get up for 2nds or 3rds.  I had a pounding headache from hugging my water bottle the night before so I helped clear it up by ordering a champagne and mimosa, $5 each.  

There was also a line cook at the egg station.  I ordered an omelet and freshly made waffles, mini waffles.  Take advantage of that!  Thanks to Amanda for hosting a brunch UYE at this location because I never would have tries this place on my own for brunch.

If you want a safe brunch to go to then Ceres is your spot, come and try it!

One thing I do remember being there from last time was the smoked salmon. That was the highlight along with the omelet and waffle station. It's quite expensive for a relatively simple buffet. But if you factor in the live jazz and the relaxing scenery--there are fake waterfalls outside in every direction you turn--the Ceres Sunday brunch is a decent deal.

4974373,2008-03-13,0,PG9I7ZfeXV4UKVXo-yciLw,"Finding Ceres Restaurant inside the JW Marriott can be a bit of an adventure, especially if you came through a different entrance.  Located in the Spa Tower and nearby the hotel lobby, views from the restaurant include the surrounding garden and pools (not swimming pools).

Making our way past the Ceres Lounge and the bar, we were warmly greeted by the host.  Asking if we had reservations (which we did not), we were seated right by the windows.  It was very quiet on this Sunday evening with only another party or two of diners.  

As menus graced our table, beverage orders were taken.  Hot bread rolls with cute little butter pads arrived next as we waited for our appetizer to arrive.

The BF was immediately intrigued by their Fresh Shrimp ""Saganaki"" ('Tomato, Kalamata Olive, Lemon, Capers, Feta Cheese' - $14).  He had saganaki once before and really enjoyed it, so he wanted me to try it.  When it arrived, it wasn't quite what he expected.  Saganaki is usually a Greek appetizer that includes fried or broiled cheese.  The cheese is usually flambeed at the table and then doused with lemon juice.  We mentioned to the waiter how it was different from what we had expected, and the waiter said they used to light the dish on fire at the table, but after an incident where a tie caught on fire, they now light it in the back.  Nonetheless, the three chunky shrimps were cooked to perfection and the light sauce complimented the dish quite nicely. 

The waiter recommended the Rosemary & Garlic Marinated Domestic Lamb Rack ('Ratatouille Gratin, Herb Potato Puree, Sauce Bordelaise - $38), which is what the BF was easily sold on.  The lamb came out beautifully presented, along with a nice side dish of the gratin and mashed potatoes.  The BF enjoyed his perfectly cooked lamb and buttery potatoes.

I had the Chargrilled Delmonico Steak ('Confit Fingerling Potatoes, Sauteed French Beans, Natural Veal Reduction' - $34).  It came out cooked the way I wanted it along with a nice offering of potatoes and beans.  The side dishes were ample and very delicious.

We were both impressed with the food and the service.  Our waiter was very personable, refilled our beverages without being asked, and offered suggestions as well.  A manager came by during our meal to also check on how our meal was, so they were quite thorough.    

We did ask our waiter if they were normally this quiet and he expressed that depending on what functions were being held at the hotel, the pace does change.  The night before, he mentioned, was quite busy while this evening was a very relaxed.  

The lighting were we sat was quite dim, which others can deem as quite romantic.  For us, we should have asked to sit under the light because we like to look at our food, but we weren't that anal this time to move.

They describe this restaurant as American-style fare with a Mediterranean influence.  It is a bit pricey and wouldn't normally be a place I'd go for dinner on a regular evening.  But I think they can do well for a nice meal out with friends and such.

I've been wanting to eat at Ceres for a while and finally decided to make a reservation in person while I was at the property. That was painful as Ceres is open for breakfast then becomes Carmel Room for happy hour and dinner. The employees at the host stand didn't seem interested in taking my reservation but I did get a phone call confirmation after leaving my info.

We were lucky they had jazz brunch on this Sunday and got a table overlooking one of the property's waterfalls.  Here's my issue with this brunch- it's a glorified continental breakfast. I knew this going in so it's a statement more than a complaint. So, most pics posted here represent a former version of brunch when it looked lavish, was more costly and probably included alcohol. I didn't post food pics cause it was too boring. You can also skip the brunch buffet and order from the breakfast menu. 

We had pretty decent omelets, too hard waffles (no toppings! oh the horror), nice fruit selection, very good fresh juice, Greek yogurt, good coffee in too small cups, good pastries. Plenty of Breakfast items but not so much the lunch portion. No salad or soup. No Benedict (a brunch staple for cryin' out loud). The stations were: made to order omelets/waffles; eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage; fruit, cheese, cold cuts; cereal/pastries. Our server was great and made sure our beverages were filled.
