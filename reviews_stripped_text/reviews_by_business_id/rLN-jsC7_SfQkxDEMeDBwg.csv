348938,2017-01-08,0,rLN-jsC7_SfQkxDEMeDBwg,"I was so excited when I found out they offer gluten free crust and the first time I went in I asked if they could make one half like breadsticks and the other half pizza so my daughter wouldn't feel left out. The manager was accommodating and kind and told me it was no problem and I could get it that way every time. 
Every time we go back to do it they look at us confused and tell us they can't do it and we have to fight them on it. Tonight they did that again. We redeemed a free pizza but he did not offer us a new stamp card even though we ordered multiple pizzas. I went back for a Chicago stuffed pizza and the woman putting it together was either flirting with her coworker or staring off into the distance and didn't notice I had a special order. When she topped it with cheese she didn't add enough to even cover the sauce. I asked for more cheese and after having to repeat myself because she wasn't paying attention to me she took about 20 shreds of cheese and tossed it on top. I'm disappointed in the poor customer service and the lack of cheese on my pizza! Papa Murphy's always is super cheesy but tonight I had to go home and add more just so the sauce would be covered!

1077378,2016-04-14,0,rLN-jsC7_SfQkxDEMeDBwg,We normally love Papa Murphy's. We were thrilled one opened 2 miles from our house. Sadly this location is extremely greasy and just doesn't taste the same. We've ordered from them 6 times and never got a good pizza.

But then I saw a bunch of people had posted online how good Papa Murphy's is, so we tried them.  This is awesome pizza!

The Centennial location is new, and is still working out a few details (online ordering wasn't exactly as smooth as it should have been).  But even after having to wait a little longer for our pie, we were rewarded with a fabulous pizza.  And they have text specials that are incredibly good deals, when they happen.  

To the nay-sayers who think there's no need for another pizza place in the area, I remind you this is TAKE-AND-BAKE pizza only, a whole different animal in the pizza world.  

Also not to be missed is their s'mores dessert pizza, which for s'mores lovers, is phenomenal!",I2LqdDguUbkh22hc06dgWQ,1,1,5,kcbCcz5F9vlXMRdFl0yuJw

1520961,2016-05-21,5,rLN-jsC7_SfQkxDEMeDBwg,"I never really understood the idea of a take-n-bake.  I believed it was just a fresher version of the frozen pizza.  A pizza I was doomed to undercook or worse yet....burn.  Up until today, I thought who better to bake a pizza pie than the pizza pie professionals.

The GF came across some coupons for Papa Murphy's and suggested we order.  After a week of some what clean eating and listening to her telling me the pizza was good, I thought I would give it a shot.

We ordered up two pizzas about an hour before we were going to pick them up.  The first pie was the Angus Steak & Roasted Garlic on a thin crust.  The second was called ""Cowboy"" on an original crust.  This was a more traditional pie consisting of red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and olives.

When we made our way to the shop, we were greeted coming through the door.  The remainder of the experience was friendly enough.  The purchase of your take-n-bake was efficient enough.  Out the door we went with two cellophane wrapped dough disks; each one looked like a thawed out version of a frozen pizza I was sure to F-up in the very near future.

When we got home the GF assumed the the role of an amateur pizza baker.  It seemed to me the longest part of waiting for our meal was preheating the oven.

When these gems were pulled from the oven, they took on a very different appearance from other pizza delivery joints.  These things looked fresh....they radiated freshness.  They smelled fresh.  Best of all, they tasted fresh.  I proceeded to devour as many pieces I could.  It was pure pizza joy.  I quickly became pizza drunk on angus steak and pepperoni.  Take-n-bake is good to go and I will be back again....but only if the GF is going to do the baking.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,7,6,4,OqVU_4QZ6_lPQJLTBzN4yQ
2065724,2016-11-04,0,rLN-jsC7_SfQkxDEMeDBwg,"Their Large Chicken Bacon Artichoke Thin Crust pizza was really tasty. I would've given them 3 other stars, but the issue below really concerned me...

The issue I had was with regards to the transaction I made to purchase this pizza. On 11/01 - Tuesday - pick up was ready at 7PM, I made a purchase online via this website here: https://www.papamurphys.com/menu#menuBannerPopup (you can find your store location as well - I used 89131). As with any online transactions you receive an order confirmation of your purchase via the e-mail you put in. I entered my debit card information and got an e-mail of a $10.00 bill. 

Anyways, my husband and I drive down to the store at 7PM and a gentleman behind the counter tells me, ""Sorry Ms. it looks like your card declined, I'll need to charge you again."" So, without hesitation, I say, 'Sure, that's fine.' I looked at the register and the bill he was trying to charge me came out to $17.50. I was shocked...this was my first time ordering Papa Murphy's online...so I tell him, 'Sir, I think that's a mistake...I paid $10.00 online.' He says, ""Really? For the whole thing?"" I said, 'Yes, for the whole Large Chicken Bacon Artichoke Thin Crust pizza'. 

I then pull out my phone and show him the e-mail confirmation of $10.00 - confirmation # 4200 (snapshot below). He looks at it and says, ""Eh okay, I'll charge you $10.00 - I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW THIS WHOLE ONLINE STUFF WORKS."" I'm thinking to myself, hmm okay. I understand. Despite this, I asked him nicely if he accepts tips. He gladly says, ""ABSOLUTELY WE DO"". 

Its the 3rd - Thursday - about 2 days since this whole event. I decide to check my bank, low and behold - 2 TRANSACTIONS for $10.00. I went through the steps to dispute the charge with my bank - no success. I then decide to call their location instead - Phone: (702) 413-7171. A nice representative named Spring told me the owner will take care of it. I'm hopeful he will. Just a little scarred about experiencing this (perhaps again) with Papa Murphy's as a new customer. 

Advice to Management/Owner - please have Spring be the supervisor of the kid that duped me and told me my card declined - there are two transactions on my account for $10.00. I'm just hoping that male representative isn't doing this to cheat people into giving him tips. Its atrociously playing the system. :/ 

Advice to others - please PLEASE, make sure to bring in a printed copy of the order confirmation you receive after ordering from this website: https://www.papamurphys.com/menu#menuBannerPopup and their location - Farm Rd 
8426 Farm Rd 
Las Vegas , NV, 89131. If you don't, you might end up like me, 2 transactions and an experience with a male representative who might just want to cheat you.

3349670,2018-01-20,0,rLN-jsC7_SfQkxDEMeDBwg,"New to the area so I had no idea this place only sells frozen pizzas. 

The good: It's convenient because you hand over your money and immediately get the pizza pie of your choice without any delay. Just preheat the oven, peel off the plastic wrapper (no boxes) and pop it in the oven (they have some sort of disposable paper tray especially designed to go straight into the oven)

The bad: The pizzas taste like any you can get from the frozen aisle at the supermarket and the ingredients didn't really taste fresh. Can't see much value in this ... maybe they are healthier than the processed options in supermarket stores?

Later that night my husband said ok ok it was really great, I didn't want tell you since I made a big deal about you cooking it.  He also said the same thing I was thinking. It was so fresh!

They recently discontinued one of our favorites. We decided to try a different pizza that we had a coupon for. At time of pick up, the cashier took about 5 minuets to enter coupon while the rest of the staff including the manager sat in back and talked while they saw him struggling. Then he wouldn't honor coupon. Called manager and still insisted they wouldn't offer coupon. Said they had new management. So I decided to just purchase 1 of the pizzas I ordered since they wouldn't honor coupon. I told the manager it's unfortunate they won't honor it and now lose out on a already made pizza. Cashier said it's ok, 1 pizza isn't going to hurt us, we don't need the business that bad. I'd like to mention that I was the only one in the store and no other pizzas were made for other customers. I told the cashier and manager that I didn't like their comments and wasn't going to buy any of the pizzas...... they said bye as they laughed at me. It's ashamed what customer service has come to. With so many other pizza companies around you'd think they would  give the best service they can from a not so popular pizza joint.

I ordered one of their stuffed crusts and the guy told me it was $12 because the owner said they had to charge $12 for stuffed pizzas. The quality and customer service is horrible. When we called the owner Spencer he was not helpful or willing to listen. He didn't take any responsibility for his employees behavior.

Papa Murphy's, was the answer. 

Fast forward  a year or so and they open one near my house. This location is really nice and clean , lots of parking and friendly staff. The pizza is top notch always taste great. So far my favorite is the stuffed chicken bacon one (drawing a blank on the official nane). 

You might ask why only 4 stars when I clearly love the pizza? Well its because it's take and bake, and to be honest I have messed up one or two from over cooking and one damn near set on fire. But if you are remotely good around an oven and know how to set a timer you should be fine. Just a hint I set several timers now .",LrKg5LXV2ZUu0GEddeD0zQ,2,1,4,CiyrBhdlCco5fcnMOoNe5A

I stopped in here one night because I didn't feel like cooking, and I thought I'd try the new pizza place on my block.  When I placed my order I was shocked at how quickly I was handed my pizza.  I'd say it was under a minute.  My pizza, however, was frozen!  I was dumbfounded.  The cashier instantly saw my disbelief and assured me that this is the ""best pizza in the world"".

Well, I can assure you that it isn't.  I'm not going to go so far as to compare this pizza to NYC or NJ.  I'm not even going to compare this ""pizza"" to Vegas powerhouses like Pizza Rock or Novacento.  Actually, I'm not going to compare this to Little Caesar's hot n' ready because:
1. Little Caesar's bare minimum pie tastes much better
2. Little Caesar's hot n' ready comes hot, ready, and NOT FROZEN!!

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that people order take out because they don't want to cook.  If I have to go out, grab food, bring it home, and still cook it; it would make sense to just pop in a Digiorno's.. which also tastes better than Papa Murphy's.",x7tsmp5lbgWXQ72pkwEWPg,0,0,1,Y71xfDKhHQNw5SkS2muKVQ
