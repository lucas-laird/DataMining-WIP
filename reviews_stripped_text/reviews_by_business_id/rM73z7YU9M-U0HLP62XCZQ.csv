We got a late night dinner there and everything was horrible. First, it looked like it was closed. I am sure that the employees do this so people just drive away (I wish we did). Our order was wrong. Cold and super greasy fries. 

and the chicken sandwich was RAW! If you think it's a pain to cook chicken late at night because it takes awhile SAY YOU ARE ALL OUT! But never rush it.

This place needs to either be under new management or torn down. Start over with a place that gives a damn.",nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,0,0,1,76-blx-l94yFJf7VIoPgxw
165920,2013-05-21,3,rM73z7YU9M-U0HLP62XCZQ,"Hey arbys explain this to me.... 
I went through the drive thru... mistake.  When I ordered 6 meals and request a big handful of arby sauce (love that stuff) I get 4.  What's the difference with 4 and a big handful? A lot!  We use it on our sandwiches and fries. I use more than 4 myself. I ask for more and they give me about 4 more. He gave me this irritated look like I was bothering him. IT'S YOUR JOB! If you hate it, leave it.  He informs me that I can only get 3 per sandwich (3 x 6 =18 right?). 
If I want more, he'll have to charge me. I just spent over $40 at ARBYS!
   The last time we ate there, we had to search for a table that didn't have garbage on it.  I went to the register to ask for a rag so I could wipe off the table, the girl gave me the rag... that was a hint. All the tables are dirty. Someone who ""works"" there should clean them.
  Anyway.... if I order the same meal inside, I can get as much sauce as I want from the pumper.  Why charge me for sauce when I'm messing up my own table?
   Terrible service.  Terrible eating conditions. Terrible policy on sauce...

They had a brand new guy at the cashier counter inside all by himself. He was very very nice and kept apologizing for the wait. He was very polite and kept a smile on his face. There was a lady with light reddish blonde hair who was running around everywhere like a chicken with her head cut off. She kept coming up to him frustrated and telling him why didn't you do this that or the other thing. He would give a very reasonable answer and she was just throw her arms up and yell at him in front of us (made me very uncomfortable). He would apologize to her and say he would remember for next time. When they yelled out what I thought was my order since my receipt didn't have my order number on it, I walked up to inquire. I said I think this might be my order and tried to show her my receipt. She completely ignored it and said okay this is your order. I said but there is no fries... She told me ""he didn't ring you up for fries."" I tried to explain to her that he did and that it came with the meal that I had ordered and that I even watched him press the button for them. Before I could explain that he did and did a good job she was like ""WHAT SIZE!"" I was baffled and couldn't get out what size in the time she wanted and she yelled it again ""WHAT SIZE!"" Seemingly very annoyed. I said medium and she picked up a cup of them and threw them on the platter. She was so rude to me and was so rude to all of her employees. Other customers in my general area were commenting on how rude she was to the young man behind the counter and just in general. She shouldn't be training anyone. I've worked in fast food and if your don't have the composure to handle the big rushes then you shouldn't be a manager. Absolutely horrible.

What some people don't understand is that the DT is on a timer, some places have incentives to assure you are delivering quick service to your customers. Alas, here comes Skylar and Brittany ordering one of everything off the menu... COME ON. GET OFF THE CAR AND ORDER INSIDE! I've always thought the DT was for quick items, maybe a bag of food... and if you had more that you needed to order, you walk your ass inside. NOPE. It happens this way everywhere I guess, I don't mind getting my pregnant ass off the car and getting my order, but WTF you can't?

Anyway.

The food here is pretty good, because Brittany just ordered up all the fries, I get the fresh ones. The employees here are hit and miss. The time I did go inside, they were more concerned with the massive DT order to actually acknowledge me and my measly $3 order. So, I get screwed either way! LOL.
