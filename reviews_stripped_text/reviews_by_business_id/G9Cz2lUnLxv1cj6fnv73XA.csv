124324,2013-03-25,1,G9Cz2lUnLxv1cj6fnv73XA,"It seems as though every casino has to have a feature burger joint now, whether it's tied to a celebrity chef or not. Gordon Ramsay recently opened one of the more popular ones at Planet Hollywood, long after other chefs opened restaurants at Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Harrah's, you name it. Some actually hold up fairly well and provide you with some pre-designed burgers to choose from, while others take the lazy do-it-yourself route, such as in the case of my latest meal at Burger Bistro in the LVH. Although burgers are a fairly easy thing to make, it's even easier for these Vegas properties to throw together a half assed restaurant like this that sell mediocre burgers at insane prices and it's really starting to piss me off. I'm not going to hide my anger and disappointment anywhere in this article; Burger Bistro's approach to providing us with another burger joint is just insulting to the scene in town and I want the execs at LVH to know it.

After parking in the lot off of Paradise and wandering through the casino and sports book, I finally asked an employee where the hell this restaurant was since there is absolutely no signage of any kind to let you know. Tucked in a corner with a few other restaurants in the path to the convention center, Burger Bistro sits in a long-abandoned restaurant space that looks like it used to be something Italian complete with faux marble columns, awful pink-lit vaulted ceilings and lots of wood paneling. There's also an abandoned bar in the front that could be a great place to stop in for a quick burger, yet the restaurant hasn't made use of this yet for some reason. Another puzzling item is the display of books behind sliding glass doors in the front, not sure if this is supposed to be some sort of library theme? Basically what I'm saying here is the LVH execs decided that burgers are hot, there are massive amount of bodies coming out of conventions so let's just slap a burger joint in this unused space, charge way too much money and see how it goes. They were so lazy about this that their menu gives you the choices of a few meats, several toppings, and leave it up to you to figure it out. It looks like a bad rip off of the Burger Bar menu.

Being totally uninspired I went with a swiss and bacon burger. After a shorter wait than anticipated, our burgers showed up on a food cart that was wheeled to our table, and what I was given was a completely generic 24/7 caf√©-style burger. There was nothing wrong with it at all, but nothing that stood out as great either. It would be great drunk at 2am, which unfortunately I wasn't. The pre-made patty was probably cooked on a griddle then thrown on a grill to add grill marks, as it had no char flavor whatsoever. It had decent flavor overall, and was cooked fairly consistent to medium rare all the way through, but lacked any type of seasoning. The frozen tomatoes added nothing, the cheese was barely noticeable, and the standard breakfast bacon was nothing special and not even cooked that well. The brioche bun was really good; grilled with garlic and butter but grilled poorly so there was raw butter in middle. Overall it was a decent burger, but something that could be found anywhere in the country at any time.

My skinny fries were completely awful; hard with a horrible oily flavor that made them completely inedible. And when I typically order skinny fries, I expect something similar to what you're given at In-N-Out or McDonald's, these were like potato sticks. The 'fat' fries at our table were pretty much what you'd consider regular skinny fries, and had just as little seasoning or good flavor to them. The weird sauce was a mixture of ketchup, A1 and who knows what, and reminded me of some concoction of sauces I'd make as a kid with condiments from my parent's cabinet.

To round out the negativity, this was way overpriced. Maybe it would be ok for $10 if it included fries, but it didn't. My plain burger plus cheese ($2), plus bacon ($3), with fries and iced tea at $3.75(!!) that was never refilled came to a ridiculous $23 before tip. I wouldn't spend that much at Burger Bar for something far better, which is surely the place they're trying to rip off. The burger trend might still be happening, but this is uncalled for. While they provide a somewhat decent burger, the fries are awful, the service was iffy, and the prices are insulting. This meal pissed me off the more I wrote about it, and I can't recommend it to anyone unless the folks at LVH seriously consider remodeling this space, providing the customer with more of a thought out menu, and reducing their prices considerably.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,5,2,1,SG2sz0omfRurPKHQ-ItF5Q

Happened to be in the LVH around lunch time and decided to give this place a try.  The menu looked good and they had a lot of different burger options (lamb, tuna, veggie, etc.).

Our server was pretty mediocre and didn't come across as if he cared about anything.  He wasn't necessarily rude but he did a bunch of smaller things like pour water sloppily spilling it over the table, didn't utter a word, only stopped by once or twice - just a very disinterested attitude.

None of this would be a big deal if the food was good but unfortunately it was not.  The mac & cheese tasted like it was from a box.  The fries had absolutely 0 seasoning.  The burger I had  was OK - think 3 stars.

You can get an average to slightly above average burger here if you add some of the unique toppings but the whole experience with waiter, garbage side dishes and of course the Vegas pricepoint drop this place down to 2 stars from 3 for me.",ieFfKNd7BF414uVGThON8w,1,0,2,_3e7AafynUzN-htRCh6n2w

I had the ahi tuna burger which seemed fairly fresh. I like the addition of pickled cucumbers and ginger on the side. Coworkers both ordered the Asian chicken salad which was really just cold pasta noodles with some dressing and some veggies/chicken. It didn't look super appetizing to me but they both said it was okay. We ordered a side of Parmesan garlic fries. They had good flavor but a little greasy and soggy.

There was a big party that was wrapping up so we didn't mind waiting for a table. We wouldn't have even mind slower service but there was basically NO service. Servers brought out food and we had to essentially beg for water refills. Towards the end, my boss was frustrated and asked if he could have some water at some point and the server said, ""Sure, at some point"" and didn't come back for another 10 minutes. 

They did give us a free order of fried pickles. They should have just said, ""So sorry, this is for the long waits,"" instead of, ""Oh you can have these because the big table isn't going to eat them."" Gee thanks?",MjFzEiAtJXpQt9Ta34J7wQ,1,0,2,z5MYbhaVehhuis_Qs7VTzw

We went to the Burger Bistro - The food came out cold and when we told the waiter, the chef took our food and re-fried it in the fryer, sent it back out with our bite marks - we also heard a ton of shouting.

The chef was so pissed off that he took our food that we had eaten and put it back in the fryer where other customers get their food - That is just plain SICK. 

Then, we asked for the manger, only they had none - so they got a back up manager from another restaurant to come over - he was less than stellar; he just babbled and told us that he was surprised the cook did this, but he could not do anything - I would have fired him there and then!! 

We payed for the meal rather than argue - but this is the standard you are doing - recooking other peoples eaten food in the fryer - GREAT HEALTH for the customers.

We had the salad with bleu cheese dressing, tuna burger & fries with truffle & garlic. Salad dressing was very good. Loved the dressing. The salad was a typical bag mix & no added greens to dress it up so that was a kind of a bummer. 
The fries were COLD & couldn't taste the truffle or garlic. Major bummer.
The tuna on the burger wasn't cooked as requested (over cooked). The advertised pickled onion & wasabi sauce were non existent on the flavor & on a stale bun. 
We had a plane to catch & didn't have time to have the kitchen rectify anything so I'm giving 2 stars vs the 1. 
This was post typical lunch time after 2 p.m. so maybe there was a shift change going on so the kitchen & service wasn't so hot.

4254743,2013-04-07,0,G9Cz2lUnLxv1cj6fnv73XA,"I've been craving a burger and based on the menu and all the signage throughout the Hilton this seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. When I arrived I was greeted by a sign saying, ""please wait to be seated"" and a group of three ahead of me. After a while the hostess finally arrived and told the trio ahead of me it would be a thirty minute wait. I wasn't starving so I went back to my room, I should have recognized the signs though. 
An hour later I returned and was told it'd be a few minutes. Ten minutes later I was seated. The restaurant was only 3/4 full.
There isn't a lot to the menu so it was easy to decide what I wanted. After ten more minutes I was yet to see my waiter. Finally the hostess came around to get my drink order. She brought me a Guiness in a can with no glass. Ten minutes later she swung by to tell me it'd just be a minute longer. Meanwhile the man who was seated after me was placing his order. Ten minutes later the hostess came back, apologized and took  my order. As I waited I noticed that a number of tables were empty, but hadn't been cleared. They were obviously understaffed. 
After another ten minutes a waitress stopped by with water for me. Five minutes later my meal (and the man who was seated after me, but ordered 10 minutes ahead of me) were served our food. And of course my order was wrong. I ordered no tomato and saut√©ed onions and got tomato and no onions.
Too hungry from waiting I ate it. It was okay. Not the best burger I've ever had by a long shot.
When I finished eating, the bill had the saut√©ed onions on it, as well a piece of chocolate cake. Twenty minutes after my food arrived, the couple who ordered five minutes after me had still not received their meal. They were still waiting when I left.
I honestly considered skipping out on the bill the service and ambiance were so bad.

4702292,2013-03-09,1,G9Cz2lUnLxv1cj6fnv73XA,"It wasn't too difficult finding the place because it's located near the other restaurants (Benihana and TJ's Steakhouse). The entrance is really exciting! There are stacks and shelves of books that makes you feel like you're in a library and there's a bar in it. What's confusing is no hosts, but there is a convenient sign inviting you to seat yourself at an open table (I'm glad they mentioned ""open"" or I would have sat myself at someone else's table). The room is hexagonal with tables lining the walls and when we walked in, most of the tables were taken or dirty from previous diners. Awkward.

Our server was friendly, but we had a rocky start - we inquired about the 'foie gras terrine with sweet apples' burger topping and her response was...annoying. ""It's duck...like a slice of duck and apples. Well, it's liver...and apples."" My brother informs her, as nicely as possible, ""I know what foie gras is..."" So I say, ""Yes, we want to know how it's prepared."" She continues, ""Like I said, it's a slice and apples...it's just a topping, so..."" UHH, what???? Yeah, not happy about that.

My brother had a comp, so we took advantage of ordering several things on the limited menu. I ordered the Angus burger (medium rare) with extra toppings of avocado and grilled red pepper. Ruben ordered the Australian Lamb with mint jelly. We shared the truffle ""thick"" fries, garlic parmesan ""thick"" fries, and fried pickles. The fried pickles were not bad. I liked that they were spears and crunchy, but not much in the flavor or tart department. The fries were called ""thick,"" but really were just normal cut fries. I commend their using Idaho potatoes and cutting the fries themselves, however, the truffle flavoring was gross. It was that overpowering, disgusting faux truffle oil nonsense. Couldn't stomach it. The garlic parmesan flavoring was good though with actual garlic (not sure where the parmesan was). The burger itself was prepared nicely and although I asked for medium rare and received medium, it was still succulent. No flavor though, but I guess that's why they offer nine different sauces. I also really liked the avocado and grilled red pepper on the burger with the fresh onion, lettuce, and tomato. Overall, the burger offered very little flavor and nothing spectacular. The portion was large and priced well though ($10 before extras, $11 for the lamb).

The service was just okay. She was kind, but had her really bad moments like earlier with the foie gras incident. Then, when we wanted to order plain fries, she responded, ""Oh, I think we're closed."" You think you're closed or you are closed? Also, why would you not inform your tables that the kitchen did last call for food anyway? Then, she goes to check and comes back a few minutes later with a plate of skinny and thick fries. I said thanks wholeheartedly, but knew these were leftover and for whatever reason, the staff decided to give it to us. Kind, but weird. The worst part was that some of the fries were doused with that horrendous truffle oil! Could you at least warn a gal? Oy. I can't help but think there was a reason LVH didn't do much to advertise their new burger joint. Not worth it!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,1,2,CEp_jdfS4ov9PKA7tqLxcQ

About the Food: fried pickles were hot and crispy...very nice. Hubby had the Angus burger and he thought it was good. I had the sliders to try out several different flavors. The beef and the lamb were good. The turkey one was not...kind of the same as a chicken nugget with no breading. 

About the service: not horrible but not great. Just about borderline average.

4884586,2013-06-14,0,G9Cz2lUnLxv1cj6fnv73XA,"I was in Las Vegas for a business meeting and stayed at LVH. Rather than go to the luncheon at the Convention Center we took a client to Burger Bistro.   They were so Unprepared for a Large number of people. There were a lot of empty tables but not enough wait staff so they stopped seating people. There was a very long line of people waiting to be seated.  So we waited. Went to the bar to order soda the bartender was on the phone totally ignoring me. Finally he asked what I'd like - gave him my order and he says ""we'll you know I'm going to have to charge you for these"". Hello???   I told him I didn't expect them for free and of course I would pay.  Sad thing is that we are in the travel  business and in a position to direct (or not) clients to this restaurant.   When you are a major hotel adjacent to the convention center you would think management would beef up staff when a large group (6000+) is in town. 

So two days later we decided to chance it again with another client. It seemed like they had more staff and we were seated rather quickly. The lamb burger was great but the menu says choice of wheat or brioche and they don't ask which you want so be sure to specify. At the convention we are on a tight schedule and this restaurant is convenient but they need to do a much better job of being prepared when conventions are in town.",H3Q59EOc0SveTcs3zGIquA,1,0,2,0pog3pmCKMgDvZX21LZSxg

4996150,2014-01-28,0,G9Cz2lUnLxv1cj6fnv73XA,"The Burger Bistro is located inside the Las Vegas Hotel.  After a long day walking around at a trade show, I decided to find a place to eat inside my hotel instead of heading back out.   

 I showed up at about 9PM, and stood & conspicuously waited in their front entrance area for about 10 minutes before someone finally noticed me & took me to a table.  The restaurant -- as was the case with all restaurants in the LVH on this Thursday night -- was not very crowded, though not empty.    Other than the bad-start of me having to stand around for 10 minutes waiting to be noticed, the service was pretty good.  I ordered a veggie burger with cheddar cheese & onions, and Truffle-garlic fries.

 As seems to usually be the case at these so-called 'upscale' burger places, when you order a burger, that's all you get on the plate.  Fries are extra.  Other than that annoyance, my veggie burger was pretty good, though the cheddar cheese which I'd asked for was not on it.  The truffle fries were great.

  The waiter was apologetic about the absence of cheese when I mentioned it after the bill arrived, & he made sure to deduct that optional cheese from the bill.  The burger was decent enough without the cheese that I just didn't bother sending the burger back for it.

 Seemed like the place had a good selection of beers, but I just had an iced tea.

  I would not go out of my way to dine at the Burger Bistro again, but would certainly dine there again if/when I stay at the the LVH again.

  A quick comment about the LVH & all the restaurants within:  Maybe the place is jumpong on the weekends, but during the mid-January Wednesday & Thursday evenings & nights I was wandering around, none of the restaurants were ever very crowded & I wonder how profitable they can be.   I wouldn't be surprised if the LVH is subsidizing them in order to market the hotel/casino as having numerous restaurants to chose from.   *IF* the LVH & businesses within are losing $$ like I think they must be, things could go down-hill pretty quickly if/when they decide they need to make drastic cutbacks.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,3,oZ3c_12PsG_nSGh-d5qyPg

The place itself isnt too big. Wood panel walls with paintings and marble colums with a chandelier in the center. I'm not totally sure but I believe this place is fairly new, opened within the past few months. It's a seat yourself type of sit down restaurant.
Menu is pretty simple and straightforward. Prices seem reasonable. There are 6 different burgers available to choose from. Angus 10oz, Lamb 8oz, Tuna, Crab,Turkey & Veggie. Then you can add a variety of toppings anywhere from foie gras & apples to brie & bacon. Some sides include fries(shoestring or regular) either natural, parm garlic or truffle, fried pickles & mac n cheese. According to the menu you have a choice of brioche or wheat bun but our server didn't ask and we all got brioche. We did get our appetizer at the same time as our burgers & fries. I got the angus burger, it was quite a hefty sized burger. We also got the fried pickles, all 3 fry incarnations & onion rings. Nothing mind blowing but not horrible either. I was satisfied with the size of the burger and everything tasted ok. Our server was nice enough to bring us 7 different sauces to try with our burger & fries. She was friendly but service was a bit slower than we expected. They seemed to take awhile to bus the tables that were done. Some were still not cleaned off by the time we left and some of those were there before we arrived.

There was a nice side of onions, tomato slices, and lettuce.  Plenty of condiments at the table so I could dress the burger just the way I wanted.

I was in a party of nine.  Seven of us had angus burgers.  No complaints.  One had the tuna burger.  She's usually the first to complain but liked it very much.  One had the lamb burger.  He raved about it.

I hear what folks are saying about the skinny fries and thick fries.  The skinny fries *are* like shoestring.  The thick fries are regular fries.  The frying oil was dirty because they were too dark.  A burger joint should have excellent fries - these were not!

Our server was outgoing and personable.  He would have seemed like a smart a** if I had been in a bad mood.  For example, he would reply, ""No,"" about half the time to a request for a beverage refill or the like.  He was teasing but that might not go over with some people.  

I thought the pricing ($10 for the basic burger plus $5 for the blue cheese and grilled onions) was justified.  I really enjoyed the burger.

The decor inside the restaurant doesn't really seem like a burger place.  It's kind of shi-shi.  It ""feels"" like an upscale Italian place.

We ordered food and drinks and the food came out relatively quick. I ordered tangy BBQ chicken wings thinking they would come out cooked in BBQ sauce. I was wrong.... They just came out plain with a side of sauce on the side. The sauce wasn't even BBQ it was actually the honey ginger but I ate it anyways because I knew the waiter wouldn't be back around for a while. After we finished, the waiter brought us our check and charged my boyfriend for 2 beers when he only ordered one. Of course he fixed the issue and we paid our check and left.
