445064,2016-02-22,0,7usumJrTK_qs2GbSd8zIvg,"I have enjoyed everything I have eaten here. Their prices are in keeping with the norm and their food always seems fresh. I have had a few wraps and a bagel sandwich and 3 different things from the coffee menu. A+ on the menu and integrity of the food.

Also - there is free wifi.

So why the missing star, right? 

The customer service is hit or miss. A couple owns this and they mostly run this place alone but they do have help. Even so, EVERY single person behind the counter is a bit rough around the edges. They seem to think they are delivering good customer service, but most often they are not gaining the kind of rapport with their customers that a business like this needs. 

ONE example: this one time I witnessed the owner shout out for someone to come get their order (the setup is much like a Starbucks in that there is an order placing counter and a pickup counter). When the girl sat out of his sight, eagerly engaged on her laptop instead of hopping up at his repeated beckoning - he rapidly walked all the way around his counter and all the way over until he could see her and then LITERALLY yelled that her order was ready. Thank goodness her response was timely! I am not sure what he would've responded like had she just smiled, nodded, and said thank you - leaving her coffee at bay for another moment. hahaha. I understand wanting your customers to have their order while it's hot, and maybe he has lost a little bit of money when it comes to people taking orders from the counter that don't belong to them... but maybe kindly delivering her coffee to her since he took the time to walk all the way over there anyway would've been a better move.


That said - you can tell they take a great deal of pride in their menu and each individual item they make. Also, the owner uses dry humor - which I get a kick out of.",uBrBgZ92hoKa2a2GB2gEug,0,1,4,vAg83tqrQGyS43dTNDRBwA

I won't be coming here again after my recent experience. My BF wrote a review that pointed out the male owner was grumpy, due to his frequent unprofessional demeanor and tone.

A few evenings ago, we were grabbing a coffee in the drive-thru and the man began calling him racist epithets peppered with F-bombs. This escalated to spitting in his face and chasing our car with a baseball bat while screaming threats. All because he was called grumpy, which was clearly the understatement of the century.

So the boba milk tea overall wasn't terrible, but not that great either. The boba itself was a combination of what seemed like old/new batch of boba. Few would be chewy while others were tough. The milk tea didn't seem to come together. You'd taste light tea then a sugary aftertaste. 

+quiet location! If you're trying to get some work done, the place doesn't get busy (and they have free wifi)

We pulled up to an adorable and unique coffee menu and received amazing service from the older woman working there. I have never seen a non-chain coffee shop with such a large store AND a drive-thru. My Thai Tea Latte was served piping hot and was exactly what I needed to perk right up. Be warned that is is on the sweet side so if you aren't in need of both a caffeine and sugar rush, I would suggest asking to have it made less sweet.

Nadia was so kind at the register and she made my Frappe the way I liked it. White chocolate Frappe with Almond milk which was nice and creamy.  I love any coffee shop that offers almond milk!  Which automatically beats that one overrated coffee chain that doesn't even offer that option.

4006006,2016-04-01,5,7usumJrTK_qs2GbSd8zIvg,"A cute coffee cafe across from CSN. Perfect spot to study/or to grab breakfast.

I came here to study on a lazy weekend. I was headed to Starbucks but realized I had this place on bookmark. The major difference is that they have more pastry options, and the fact that you don't have to deal with rude baristas at Starbucks. Lady on the register who I believe was the owner was extremely sweet and friendly.

According to her, you choose a drink on the menu (3 sizes offered) then you can choose the flavoring of your choice. Some of the flavoring options includes vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, peppermint, etc. I decided to order their Iced Latte with vanilla flavoring and total came out to be $4.38 for their 16oz. Pretty reasonable in my opinion.

Coffee was brewed strong but when I got my drink, it was luke warm. I stirred the ice for couple of minutes and it was finally cold. I wish they'd do that for me since I ordered it iced. I did enjoy my drink regardless and it was the perfect drink for a caffeine fix. 

Fast wifi. The password is their phone number! Lots of tables to study and get your work done. 

I do want to mention that place seems to not have any air conditioning. It is warm and humid inside. When I walked out of the establishment, it felt like I was walking out of a sauna.

Facility:  this is a cute little shop. It has tables and chairs for seating.  I like the metal decorations on the wall. It has a display case for the pastries next to the register and coffee making area. 

Service:  the couple that work there seem very nice. I assume they are the owners and maybe the wife even makes the pastries. Either way, they are both very patient and helpful.  

Food:  so far this is may favorite place to get the Napolean. It is a pastry layered with flaky pastry and cream in the middle. I have tried a few other pastries here, and they are good too. But I have not found a better place in town for the Napolean. They serve sandwiches and stuff, but I have not tried them yet.

A bunch of us from school dashed here for lunch to be greeted with the soothing aroma of freshly made pastries. My Iraqi and Syrian girlfriends suggested to keep the desserts for later with a useful tip about Armenian specialty desserts. Apparently they're hard to resist. But first, we needed to find out what the owner's ethnicity was since he had an accent.

In the meantime, we got ourselves our main courses - roast beef wrap for me and hot water. With every bite, the taste of onions, swirls of hummus, tomatoes and juicy roast beef oozed with flavor. And brace yourselves people, eating that pita-like bread will be messy but it's worth every crumb that falls to your lap!

Stuffed, we walked back up to the counter and asked the owner the question we've been itching to ask. Moment he said he was Armenian, we got ourselves a crepe, cheesecake filled red velvet cupcake, and a fruit tart. No turning back! They were the bomb and even better, they were cheap compared to the prices offered at novelty cafés. Most of the sweets were below $3 and the crepe cost us roughly $5 which wasn't considering it fed 4 people. 

Students at csn will enjoy a 10% discount. There's free wifi and whatever's on the menu can be customized according to your need. Just be a little patient. They've been running for only 5 months and are still getting a hang of efficiency. All because they're focusing well on quality first and that's a great start.

Having driven past the small Charleston storefront daily for nearly five months it was finally this Saturday that I decided to stop in at Wake Up Coffee Café, the husband-and-wife owned Armenian bakery greeting myself and a pair of local police officers with hot beverages and breakfast savorires alongside a tempting display of cakes, cookies, and pastries ranging several continents and cultures.  Allowing the cops to go first as I browsed the options with the enviable task of spending a $20 gift certificate I was immediately taken aback by the low prices displayed below each item and fortunately en route to a brief morning meeting my selections ran a nine item gamut, the total bill a mere $21.45 and only a soggy cannoli and overly sweet baba proving anything less than impressive.  Admittedly a touch slow in service as the owner tended to both the café and drive-thru it was with a warm fig strudel that my Wake Up tasting began and with shattering layers around sweet fruit my hopes for the rest soared, the boxed options experienced two hours later with much sharing and praise from my two colleagues but the glut of the bounty left to me.  Trending light to rich alongside bold coffee both the macaroon-crisp walnut roll and reinterpreted napoleon offered serious textural contrast overlying mild flavors while traditional takes on the chocolate chip strewn blondie and dense baklava rivaled the city's best - a sentiment I can only assume to be true of the novel cream-meets-crunch Bird's Nest and a condensed milk sweetened graham and walnut butter ""Honeymoon Cake"" similar to the more appropriately titled ""Dream"" Cake at Manan.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,11,4,1p6YMJZqjH9RYK1bJMo5VQ
