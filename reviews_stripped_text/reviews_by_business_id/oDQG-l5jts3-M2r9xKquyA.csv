No friendly welcome, that's fine. As I was ordering the young man took my orders, but was totally not paying any attention because as I was ordering he was busy talking to the other employee making the ice creams. The other employee left to talk to some chick. Anyway, I ordered a chocolate covered strawberry sundae, ehhh where the heck is the strawberries? There were only 2 small pieces of strawberries.

I am never going back to this DQ, they are rude and can't even get an order right.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,0,1,2TAN1eYghkw6OZnmQ4GhBw

But if we weren't the hard core Blizzard fans we are... I would NEVER give this place my business.  Every time we walk through the door, the teenagers working behind the counter act like we are irritating them with our very existence.  One night we got there about 45 minutes before closing time and as we were sitting there trying to enjoy our ice cream, they put up all the chairs onto the tables around us and kept staring at us like we were keeping them late.   Seriously?

This place needs some kind of management to step in and whip the employees into shape...  Or I might have to start driving all the way down to the DQ on Tenaya and Alexander.  At least the employees are friendly there.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,4,0,1,EbggMfuXn_0N5-AQ4tWMkA

Most of them have problems with cleanliness and staff, though occasionally you'll find an awesome one that is run with care. Despite their track record, there are some base expectations that need to be met when you go to a place like this. It's nothing major really. If you can grab some ice cream and not be disgusted or angry by the time you leave, you're usually alright.

This location couldn't even accomplish the basics. Five high school girls were working the place, could not care less about their menial jobs, with no management presence to speak of. While they talked, handled money, and used the phone, a 10 year old that didn't work there was making all the orders. She looked confused and overwhelmed as a line of customers were filing through. The actual employees? Not doing much.

22 minutes to get a blizzard. Twenty-two. I'd never waited so long for ice cream in my life. Wasn't made properly at all, so the taste was sullied as well. That's why I'm taking the time to write a review of a _Dairy Queen_. Boo this location.",NgqVI51Fot6-bTUT6lpYow,4,0,1,ucBbcDz0462Ngq-um97h9w

He has end stage colon cancer and each morning looks forward to that first cool smooth taste of blizzard.

I showed the counter person the card and said I could only use it one time.  So I poked and prodded, but why....it does not say that on the card. The response was that ""only the location in Henderson approved the offer and since each DQ was independently owned and operated they would allow one use and mark your card with a punch so you could not use it again"".   

I say Boo!!! to that but I understand.  I would not want to give away $1000's of dollars in Blizzards away in one year because one business owner was irresponsible in there discounting and did not seek territory approval.  I get that part.

What I do not get was the RUDE attitude of the young women behind the register.  Why did you feel the need to continually ask me if I wanted you to mark my card.  Seeing that you were going to do that anyway.  Because of your bad attiutde and poor customer service I am positive I will not be back in you establishment for your overpriced ice cream anyways.

If you do wait for your order and decide to eat it there, good luck finding a table that is not all sticky. The whole dinning area needs a good scrub down, everything is dirty and sticky.

After paying for our meal the Cashier made a series of mistakes by not communicating well with his co-workers. First, they forgot to make one of the shakes. Second, they forgot to make one of our sandwiches. Third, they forgot to give our chips. Fourth, after making the shake that they forgot they put it on a wrong size cup. Fifth, they only gave us one bag of chips instead of four.

Seriously, how much mistakes can u make for every customer that u serve..

DQ Corporate Management should look into this location either it's a Franchise or not. Brand marketing is totally not in place at this location.",aMJ2qaMOz7BuzJJzf7SWVw,1,0,1,lPxhEaikHVgTO7a6nUKuyg

The employee was busy by herself and was blending someone else's drink and dessert, but she never acknowledged me that there would be a wait...so I just kind of stood around there.

But after she was finished with their order, she took my order and the guy behind me, and the smoothie came out pretty quick.  Not too much wait at all, after the order anyways.

I think they just understaffed at that particular time of day, but then again, the rest of the reviews aren't much different or worse than mine, so maybe it's more than that.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,2,1,2,XT9HDdu-KIWzvGi6CXPWtA

Unfortunately they were severely understaffed, just one girl working the counter and the other one making the frozen treats. Girl ringing everyone up, really sweet and professional. She was apologetic for having to step away to help make things. I told her not to worry. The girl making the treats- holy crap. The first thing she says in my direction is- get out of here. Go home. Don't you see how busy we are ? I was shocked. Then I realized she was talking to the girl in front of me who had just gotten off her shift at McDonalds (uniform was still on). I presume they are sisters. They start arguing which makes it even more uncomfortable. At this point you can here the girl slamming the things she's making down. Have you no tact? The entire line looked just as shocked as I did. 3 stars because I understand the wait and my blizzards always turn out just fine.",OJHW3xgqAFGSDu2sWppTCA,0,0,3,LOzGDqvddFlkZn2f21P8_g

I get one thing and one thing only at DQ: a cherry dipped vanilla cone. It is always tasty, so that's where the two stars in my review come from. 

The service is hit or miss. Mostly young teenagers who are friendly, but make a mess out of the pick-up area. Every time we are here, someone's order is wrong. Whether someone picked up the wrong order or they brought out items in an odd order, it's always a mess. We had someone random pick up our order (not the employees fault), but it took almost 20 minutes for them to get back to us with our order. 

Last night my boyfriend ordered a large Orange Julius, and it definitely was not an Orange Julius. Tasted like a strawberry milkshake. Not sure what happened. 

This DQ could be good if some improvements were made. It's not horrible, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere for now.",-IM1qwYck6nqKizjCzR_ww,0,0,2,26dnO_cv39oIpF-4i1XqSQ

Little did I know that the kid behind the counter had no clue what he was doing, he didn't put ice cream on it but he smothered it in whipped cream. I was in a rush and didn't notice until I got home to eat it. I must say I'm extremely disappointed because I used to work at a Dairy Queen and it's not that hard to understand how important the ice cream is in any treat you get from Here.",OK8Kn04VMJFL1jTQ_KjGhg,0,0,1,t661w9bo4qjcFJEkLK2r2A

She was fun and funny, and the entire staff was fun and friendly.  It was my first time to this location, and since I just moved to that area, I wanted to check it out.  It was delicious.  We enjoyed Blizzards, and a banana split, and chocolate dipped cones.  A very teary eyed woman came in and asked if she could post a picture of her missing dog.  The owner was so comforting and caring, it was nice to see that in a neighborhood DQ. The place was clean, and fun. I never really knew how many specialty cakes they offer and at this location, you can get it personalized with a picture. I also didn't realize how many to-go ice creams that are offered, the Butterscotch Dilly Bars are now my new favorite, as well as the Vanilla Orange.  The place was filled with fun families.  Loved it here. Will make it my weekly stop with the kids from now on.  And promised my kids a dipped cone for every A they bring home this semester!",XqsSXrEoY5NAT10r1lIDAg,0,0,5,8QhlG4XVNRfAqw1TCNwdTg

You could only see specks of Oreos. Like a grain of dirt, small. The only reason I didn't give one star is because the mini was made right. By the time I got home I was too pissed off to go back. Not to mention the wait was crazy. Might want to consider hiring more people.",Znc4RdECswfpInYV5qr1QA,0,0,2,nAKiUqBO-xeDl2Fp1Fj7tg
