First, in broken English ""we at San Gennaro come see us there"". Second, ""we at Foodie Fest see us there""....third time it just said closed now it said ""Closed for a week on vacation""!!!! Really...you don't have enough employees to keep 1 person at the store to man beef jerky and boba? The hours are really weird like 11-7 week days and I believe today Sunday 12-4????? Just weird....",vrYY6ByqCS-2We-raSqjXQ,0,0,1,f-4Swqx8-pgfKnZoyjZoUw

I came to this place out of convenience, because I had to pick up something from the nearby Amazon lockers. I walked in and I was greeted by a man excited to let me try any and all the samples that I wanted.

Every sample I had was great, but I had an allowance of $30 dollars to spend, so I got 3 large packages. I told the Jerky salesman what I wanted and he placed each item in a bag behind the counter. 

My only qualm is that I did not double check what he put in the bag. I asked for pineapple and he put in mango. I don't know if it was a translation error or if it was an accident, but I remember telling him that pineapple was better than mango.

Anyways, I like the mango enough to not go back and trade it in. There will be a next time, especially because I am unable to stop eating it and its only day one.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,4,4,4,534cqHKCXrsbtupqv0SQUw
