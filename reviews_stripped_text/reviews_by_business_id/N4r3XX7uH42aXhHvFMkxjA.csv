1.) Employees do not take their jobs seriously since they take their sweet time gossiping about thier husbands (this is what happens when you understand spanish) and not prepping the food. Seriously a simple order should of taken 3 minutes not 20 minutes.

2.) Ice cream did not look fresh.

3.) Some talked about the windexed guy earlier and I had a bad experience. He washed my windows on a audi which I just clean and left a bad job then demanded money for such act...",cBObVxZMFroj0BUl_KXMxA,0,0,2,UyOvF5dsb3Pvm95MmFU2dA

The store itself is mostly an empty room lined with freezers like a convenience store- left hand side has the fruit paletas then the Blue Bell, counter with the traditional dulces straight ahead, and freezer to the right with ice-cream-man style frozen treats and the oddball paleta flavors. No seating available.

Came in seeking something unique. Found it in the oddball paletas section: tamarind!
Sweet but not cloying, 80 calories for the entire thing, and frozen rock-hard: I'm pretty sure their freezers are set at way too low a temperature, because I nearly a chipped a tooth on my treat and had to set it out on the counter for 10 minutes before I could gnaw off a shard to try.

For a cash only business, you should probably have quarters. My $1.75 total got me a pained stare when I paid with two dollar bills, and my change consisted of a fifty-cent piece and some nickels. Seriously?   

Side note: also watch out for the guy in the parking lot with a bottle of Windex. He'll spray down your vehicle while you're inside, unprompted, then expect payment afterward.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,3,2,aMwRzVfCRj4p3l9n1Sfn4g
