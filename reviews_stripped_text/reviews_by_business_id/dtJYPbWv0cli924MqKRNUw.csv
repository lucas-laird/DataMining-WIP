I was so grateful to have her kind heart and expertise there for me when I didn't have a clue what I was doing.  She made time to communicate and meet with me on several occasions to help set things up and set my mind at ease.

The day of the event was seamless on their end.  The staff was friendly and wonderful to us and our guests and the space was beautiful.  We got so many compliments on the food all through the night, and still hear about it today 2 months later!  My only drawback would be the pricing, but I can assure anyone considering them that it is worth the extra $$. Definitely recommend.",iSDDefwh-DgP36L7g78o0g,0,0,5,FnCu_-CW5Lvd5ZMgS_G98w

Working with Cindy was wonderful and seamless. She made sure all of our wishes were granted to the best of her ability and her sweet upbeat personality made us look forward to meeting with her every time. On the day of our wedding, everything was flawless -- the catering staff even made sure that my husband and I didn't forget to eat by serving us a plate from the buffet line and bringing it to us. We have nothing but praise for the operation they run, even if it is a bit on the pricier side (worth every penny).",8FRsUQ5LfXkPcvF0kZFfOA,0,0,5,7a1aFdDcE_hH39bpu2MbHA

Our primary contact was Cindy and she was amazing. She was very communicative and flexible. We had some guests with allergies (myself included) and Cindy had no problem handling these multiple requests. I even had a special gluten free plate waiting for me at my table!

The food and presentation were beautiful and most importantly, DELICIOUS! The menu consisted of meatloaf, chicken beurre blanc, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, rice pilaf, corn bread, and salad. Though I had a separate plate full of allergy-friendly chicken and veggies (so good, btw), everyone else raved about the buffet. DiVine Events also provided a cheese and veggie plate for cocktail hour and operated the open bar all night. We were impressed with the bartender who kept the party going and remembered all of our drinks as we approached the bar!

There was a bit of a mishap with one of the dishes at the buffet but Cindy and team handled it SO professionally and rectified the situation immediately, really highlighting their great service. We also got a free plate of desserts and they coordinated the cake cutting and serving. 

The bride and groom were very pleased with the catering, as was I since I helped organize the wedding. I highly recommend DiVine Events for your special occasion, I am thoroughly impressed with them!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,27,21,5,YrhPru8tsHQonsJRea8iIQ

These guys are my favorite by far!  They send a chef who works hard in your garage even in the heat and two servers (or more, if you need) who are happy to help and/or assist with anything.  The food, oh the food, so yummy!!  There is something so fun about appetizers and especially appetizers that are being brought to you on a silver platter!  How can one resist?  The answer is, you can't!  They took my party to a whole new level and they will forever be my go-to caterer!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,5,4,5,NAhbNtNZOemaSe7M93-fmg
