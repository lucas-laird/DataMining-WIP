7734,2014-09-18,2,8YJOMfdnk42v3PvpkDxJGg,"I am so sorry that I didn't take a picture of the cheese enchilada that was served to us. It was the sorriest enchilada I have ever seen. Maybe a quarter of an inch thick, with cheap cheese that melted into liquid grease. 100% unappetizing, and they wanted to charge three dollars for a single one. No sides or anything.

Meanwhile I got their Thursday $5 special, the carne asada. It at least had a proper portion size. But the meat was chewy and tasted almost old. Beans tasted pretty good, but rice was very mediocre. The waitress insisted that everything is fresh and they go to the market every morning for supplies. If that's the case, then they've figured out how to take fresh ingredients and capture that mysterious and elusive 'slightly outdated' flavor that's so hard to achieve with fresh food. I only managed two or three bites before giving up.

The chips were alright but nothing amazing. We got two rounds of them, and the second round tasted fresher than the first. Salsa was alright-ish but lacked sophistication, and had a slight burn in the back of the throat that managed to drag on and on. Top this off with the water tasting either like tap or like their filter had gone out. We both drank from my tea, just to mask the dubiousness.

So far this is completely in 'Eek!' territory, so why 2 stars instead of 1? The waitress that day was great. But she's apparently one of the bartenders and was just covering for the Maribel's staff today while they were short. She was extremely understanding, and took off both the terrible enchilada and the disappointing carne asada. We left without being charged, but we still happily left a tip.

And really, there were other patrons here who seemed to be quite happy with what they were getting, so I'm very confused about how lousy this was for us. I remember reading over these yelp reviews and wondering how you end up seeing a bunch of 4 and 5 star ratings and then an intermittent 1 or 2. I've definitely had a 1 or 2 experience today. Not sure if I'll ever return to try for a 4 or 5.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,2,qAkKws9D3MYoTBQniHk_4w

Not many of their dishes are vegetarian friendly as written, but they made the special point of telling us that they would do as much as possible to accommodate us, and essentially made us entirely new dishes.

I don't understand the 4-5 stars
When I first walked in to the simi large open and cold room there was one couple at a small table. I wanted to leave as it should have been crowded at dinner time with great reviews. It was like sitting in an enclosed patio, Zero atmosphere. We gave it a try and found the 5 start guacamole GREAT! I usually judge a mexican restaurant by the salsa. This was thin, no flavor and just spice hot. I did finish the salsa and chips though because I went for the $5 special and the two little enchiladas may have been enough for lunch but not dinner. The food was ""okay"" 
but nothing to rave about. The young girl that waited on us was obviously a family member which is fine and she was very nice but no training.

My opinion; ""We can cook Mex food, let's open a restaurant and have all our friends and family give us 5 stars"".

Our enchilada plates were even worse. I could not eat more than 2 bites before I had to spit out my attempted 3rd bite. It was not good at all. The beans tasted burnt and the rice had an odd spice I have never tasted in mexican food.

Ever since we moved to Vegas there's been very few Mexican restaurants I've been impressed with. Had this place bookmarked after I read Kathy R.'s review couple months ago. Even with the stellar ratings, reviews and hype from trusted Yelpers Matt, Jaime and Emily, I still wasnt in any hurry or had the urgent need to check out this place. Things sure did change though after my first visit here.

The complementary chips and salsa - chips warm,fresh and salsa IS HOMEMADE. Love how it's blended to a smooth consistency. 

The shredded beef burritos, my personal favorite!  Comes PACKED with shredded seasoned beef that's juicy. Requested mine wet with green sauce, 

Rice and beans - What I really like about it is it's not greasy! 

Portions were satisfying for both Mr. B and I. One of my friends thought it was not enough beans and rice for them. I pointed out rice and beans are fillers! Hello!!  What's important your main entree is not skimpy servings. 

The restaurant resides inside the Doc Holidays building. There's banner signs in red and green that wrap around the building and signs advertising $5 daily specials. It's hard not to miss. You walk in side it's sectioned off from the bar. So not too much cigarette smoke escapes into the restaurant side.  You walk in there and the server will greet you and tell you to sit anywhere you want.  

It's family friendly.

Clean and super casual, like a big family dining room complete with pool and game table right in the dining area!

Service. I'll just say I came away so impressed with how our young but very mature,intelligent and confident young man handled himself for his age. Our first time there, Sam didnt miss a beat. Got our orders right, our drinks refilled, offered some great suggestions.

The table that had people was occupied by three kids (pre-teen, early teens) one of whom got up immediately and grabbed menus to present to us.  Honestly, we were just about the turn right around and go somewhere else but felt bad because the kid seemed eager.  We decided to give it a try anyway.  The teen (who I will refer to as our waiter) asked about our drink orders and placed a basket of chips and salsa at our table.  The menu was very small and nothing really caught our attention.  My wife had the fajitas, my daughter the chicken strips and I decided to order the carne asada nachos.  The chips and salsa weren't bad - only needed a touch of salt.  While we were waiting for our food, I decided to look up the Yelp reviews and was shocked to see so many 4 and 5 stars!  This gave us hope that maybe looks can be deceiving and we shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  Our food came and the fajitas were sizzling and my nachos and daughter's chicken strips were hot and freshly prepared.  Overall, the food was not bad - just a little bland.  The reason for the 2 stars - 1) decor and ambiance is severely lacking!  The tables and chairs were run down and the pool table and Galaga video game in the corner added to the confusion of the place.  The fact that the restaurant sits at the entrance of the bar was a little distasteful.  Every time a bar patron needed to use the restroom, they would have to walk through the restaurant.  My wife's fajitas got compliments at least three times by people on their way to the bathroom.  2) pricing - we visited the place on Saturday, so no specials.  The fajitas were $13, nachos $8 and kids meal $4.  Neither my meal nor my wife's were up to par with these price levels.  Again, the food was not bad, just not worth the price we paid.  Perhaps if we had the $5 specials others have mentioned it would have been better.  I will say that the kid who served us was very nice and professional and we had no problems with service.  Obviously a family business and the owners should be proud of this kid!",EpqN9dEsZ2dgrqE4yjjSGg,0,0,2,fRWHydBhLid_VIk6NbY-Sg

A couple of my coworkers suggested picking up Maribel's for lunch. The idea of paying $5 for lunch appealed to me, so I tagged along. Maribel's is attached to a bar, and has a weird setup. There's about 6 tables, a pool table and a couple of TVs. No hostess station or anything like that.. just a big open room. The daily special was fish tacos, which I am not a fan of, so I settled on a bean and cheese and split half of chicken quesadilla. My party (6 ppl) was the only party in the restaurant and it took about 20-30 mins for us to receive our food, which is a bit of a bummer. They probably aren't used to the volume. They did give us free chips and salsa though, which was really good! The bean burrito was comparable to a Taco Bell burrito as was the chicken quesadilla. Nothing special. The server was nice and friendly. I probably wouldn't go back when there are better alternatives, like Roberto's, with much faster service. I will say this place would be super handy if you got wasted at the bar next door.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,3,1,3,_BlQfMN_iE1xJcMG1FwszA

Let's start with the service - our waitress was outstanding. She was attentive and gave some recommendations and also informed us of the specials throughout the week. Definitely trying to make sure we come back - which I totally appreciate. However, we placed our order when there was only one other table seated, and it took a good 35-40 minutes to get our food after we placed our order. The waitress apologized several times and even brought us a complimentary churro to apologize. The churro was outstanding. One review compared it to Disneyland churros. While I appreciate them recognizing Disney churro's as the greatest in the land, this one wasn't quite that good.

So for my entree I was simple, bean & cheese burrito. It was only $3 so I figured I'd take a stab. OUTSTANDING! Beans were really good, probably could have used a little more cheese. And they have Dr. Pepper, nothing goes better with Mexican food than an ice cold Dr. Pepper in my opinion. My wife ordered 2 cheese enchiladas, one with green sauce the other with red sauce. The green sauce was average, neither of us cared for the red sauce. They were also very, very small. I know she wouldn't order it again and I wouldn't venture out to try it - but I am interested in the carne asada which the waitress said was very good.

I'm always game for a top notch bean & cheese burrito - I just hope this restaurant isn't a one trick pony because good Mexican restaurants in this city are few and far between.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,1,4,j5a97d8jJ-664reaujXpwA

It's nothing fancy here so if you need to be seen or require a mariachi band killing your ear drums than this is not for you. 

The menu is limited and at the same time everything I have tried has been stellar.
1. Chicken taco combo (3 street tacos, rice , beans) $6. All white meat chicken seasoned well. It's going to be hard to try more of the menu because this my shit. 
2. Carne Asada taco combo- same as above and real good. 
3. Chicken Enchiladas (comes with two) - Pretty damn good. 

I LOVE their guacamole, homemade chips and red salsa, rice and beans. I bet even just a bean burrito or breakfast burrito would be bomb here. 

Point is food is solid, affordable and it's a local family owned business. I have to give props to the server Ozzy (I hope that's her name. It may be Izzy. I know I suck.) Her service is on point and she remembers me which scores major points and tips.

We started with chips and salsa and an order of guacamole. Salsa was spicy with a nice, fresh made flavor. The made fresh when you order it guac knocked our socks off, not overly spicy, but fresh, fresh, fresh...and you can't beat that. 
And enjoying it on fresh made tortilla chips was even better, second batch was still warm. 
For entrees my wife went with the shredded beef tostada, I had the smothered pork chili burrito and we shared a cheese quesadilla. The best testament I can give is that we both left empty plates. Wife said the tostada was very good, with fresh veggies and a couple big slices of avacado. The pork burrito was delicious, with the right amount of spice and very flavorful pork filling. The tomatillo ""smother"" added a nice bite as well.

Hubby and I were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. Our server was excellent! She got our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa right away. I usually like chunky salsa and this salsa was thin, but it had a lot of good, fresh flavor and the chips were tasty. For $3.99 I ordered a side of Chips and Guacamole and my oh my was it so good! It was made fresh to order and had such great flavor. I'm very impressed at the price of the chips and guac considering it was fresh and the portion was good.

Tuesday - Carne Asada Tacos
Wednesday - Fish Tacos
Thursday - Carne Asada Burrito
Friday - Chicken Sub
Saturday - Shredded Beef Burrito

If you want flour tortillas you can also get that for no additional charge, but you get 2 tacos instead of 3 and our sever said they are bigger than the regular ones. Options are nice! The asada had good flavor and the tacos were filled nicely, especially for the price. The beans were good and the rice was even better. It's awesome that you can get quality food that tastes so good for $5 plus tax and leave stuffed. Inside was clean and they have TV's. I can't say enough about our server. She checked on us often and took the time to chit chat with us for a bit letting us know about other specials and I could tell she was genuinely passionate about the food being served here. They even take phone orders if you don't have time or want to eat inside. I saw several people picking up to-go orders.

5016718,2014-10-18,2,8YJOMfdnk42v3PvpkDxJGg,"Talk about a hidden gem! This place fits that description to a T! I'm a sucker for Mexican food and when Jessie suggested this place for dinner I was all in. 

Maribel's is located inside Doc Holliday's. It has a very simple decor, but they don't need it cause their food is that good. Their menu is simple, but has all the authentic Mexican food you'd want. Plus, they have an awesome $5 daily specials. They also serve their breakfast items all day. 

Jessie and I ordered the chips and guacamole which was only $3.99. Wow! The bowl of guacamole was huge and perfectly flavored. The salsa had the perfect kick. We  both choose the steak chimichangas,wet with everything on it. While we were chatting and enjoying our chips and guacamole all of a sudden a homeless lady was beside me handing me a note written on a small cocktail napkin. In the note she was asking for money. I was so thrown off and felt incredibly awkward. I don't think our young waitress noticed that this was happening because the homeless woman scurried away before our waitress appeared again. Finally our food came out. They look so tasty and it was! It also was way hot temperature wise. The crispy shell was filled with steak and cheese. Plus it was piled with more guacamole, sour cream and pico. Also, the enchilada sauce pulled it all together. Yummy!!! 

We left with full tummies! The service is pretty good here and the food is wonderful. I love random hole in the wall places like this. If you love authentic Mexican food check out Maribels!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,4,3,4,-J2RVtDbhAlUnWTCaXrKiQ

What was most impressive was the waiter. He couldn't be older than 15 and was helping his mother run the entire restaurant. He was very professional and even working on a Saturday! I can't wait to go back.",Ddl3e0igk2aI_VD4e0gL4g,0,0,5,ANnXpH3a0BecVjhmSpWeHQ
5066940,2014-08-24,4,8YJOMfdnk42v3PvpkDxJGg,"I'm writing this review with a full tummy and let me tell you it is a happy tummy. I'm glad my cheat day was chosen wisely this week ! Yelp did not let me down with this place ! If youre coming and expecting a fancy Restraunt with a mariachi band you won't find that here. What u will find is a cute little hole in the wall place next to a bar. Literally when you walk in to the left is the bar and to the right is Maribels. A tiny place with a few tables and booths , has two pool tables a few TVs and a kitchen in the back where all the magic happens. When I say magic. Literally it is magical what happens behind those doors ! 

I initially came in to try the daily Saturday special but I was told they were out of shredded beef. So I asked for a few minutes to decide on what to order since I had mind set on the shredded beef burrito. The server and owners son Sam asked me if I needed help with any recommendations but I told him I heard everything here was good I just needed a Minute to decide. I knew I wanted guac because I love guac and enjoy when it's done right. Who doesn't love guac ?! If you don't we can't be friends let's state the obvious and move on. Lol , but seriously I'm not joking. Since my phone was dead I couldn't check yelp for recommendations or photos . I asked Sam some questions about the menu and he was very helpful and friendly. I placed my order and waited patiently. 
 

Guac - Perfect consistency it's not completely smooth which is what I love. I love a guac that has chunks ! You can tell that it's freshly made I'm almost convinced it was made to order. So yummy ! Big chunks of Avacado , cilantro , tomato and onion. Perfect ! 

Huarache - almost like a tortilla but thicker .  Topped with beans cheese and a generous piece of tender Carne Asada ! I'm almost certain the huarache was made to order the masa tasted so fresh. This my friends was literally , a party in my mouth ! So good. I've never had a huarache before and I'm not sure I would order it anywhere else because This was so good I would expect the same. 

My one and only complaint is that there  wasnt enough chips for the generous size of guacamole they give you. That can easily be fixed by just asking for extra. Im sure it wouldn't be an issue. 

I definitely missed out on the daily special but It doesn't bother me at all because I was so satisfied and I will definitely be back ! Maribels is doing it big in Flavortown. I just wished they weren't so far from me :(",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,7,5,4,TySYfRcaA3otBJmpWaz6DA

Place was empty at lunch, which came as a surprise considering all the reviews saying how good it was. The server must of been hiding in the back because after  using the restroom, I came out to a completely empty restaurant with NO help in sight. I went into the crappy little bar this place was in looking for help and the bartender stood near the register on the phone. Never asked if I needed help or anything. Terrible experience.

5267471,2013-12-21,0,8YJOMfdnk42v3PvpkDxJGg,"I was pleasantly surprised by my entire experience here.  From the outside you see 1 single banner thats easily over seen by the Doc Holiday's signs that take over the entire building, but I'm glad I took the time to stop in and have the best mexican food I have had in Las Vegas.
I have lived in Las Vegas and have tried lots of mexican restaurant this city has to offer, and this one was by far my favorite. When you first walk in you aren't overwhelmed with loud hispanic music and dim red lighting (like every other cantina in Las Vegas), You are greeted with the family who runs the whole operation. The decor was simple,  but it obviously wasn't the focus, because the food and the service was the real star.
 I ordered a the chicken enchilada meal. It came with a drink, rice, beans, and 2 enchilada's, which is more than enough food. Get this, it was 5 dollars! thats a deal! it cost more to eat at Roberto's and I wasn't violently attacked from the food 30 minutes later like I am when I go to Roberto's or Faustos. obviously I was excited that it was so keep, but it was absolutely delicious. you can tell that the chicken was seasoned, moist, and made with love. 
Our server was a young boy, probably about 13 or 14. whenever I go to a family restaurant and the service is by the children, it can be awkward and kinda painful to watch these young kids try and interact with adults and do a good job, but not for this kid. He was bright, lively, and not awkward at all. He was very quick to have combacks to our jokes, and was very good at answering our questions. Not to mention he gave us better service than that of adults at far more expensive restaurants.

I will gladly comeback, and I am constantly telling everyone I know about this place.",weD_Cd-tJ-5Mq88zkdAWoA,2,1,5,SVFNKAHihzHtRSvU0CZVhQ

The place is a dive similar to many I've eaten at in Mexico. That's fine for me makes me kind of nostalgic for the time I spent down there. Is this place a drug front? Possible. It would explain how they stay open charging those prices. Maybe not a place to bring your wife or girlfriend but if your meeting a friend for lunch and you want something cheap and tasty.

5620563,2014-09-22,1,8YJOMfdnk42v3PvpkDxJGg,"It was finally our turn to try Maribel's for dinner on a recent Thursday and the Yelp friends were correct: delicioso!  It took a few wrong turns for me to find Doc Holliday's where Maribel's is also located, so note that the building is behind Freed's Bakery.  This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall joint, but the food and service were top-notch.  Sam, our very professional and personable teenage host/waiter was at the top of his young game, greeting us and making sure we had our ice water and chips and salsa after we were seated.  There were only two other tables occupied when we arrived and then it was just the B/F and I, which doesn't make sense because the food is great and the prices are more than reasonable.  I had the guacamole and chips all by myself to start since Mel doesn't eat avocados.  The guacamole was fresh with tomatoes and nice chunks of avocado.  The serving was more than I could eat by myself so I took the rest home.  I chose the chicken enchiladas for my meal, which came with rice and beans and it was served piping hot by Sam the man-child.  Bottom line:  the food was great and it was just like eating at a friend's house.  The atmosphere is casual and Sam is the son of Maribel, the marvelous mamacita cooking up the food in the cocina.  We didn't meet her, but Sam proudly told us how his mother is the one doing all the cooking while he and his hermanas help out with everything else in the restaurant; this kid has charm and he loves what he does.  
We'll definitely be back and I know it won't be long before I update for cinco estrellas.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,5,5,4,B6uCI185qWuzSzbB3R-HVw
5674617,2015-05-11,1,8YJOMfdnk42v3PvpkDxJGg,"I had lunch for less than $10 - you gotta love that!

This was my 2nd time at Maribel's. This was much better than the first, for sure.

Just like my first visit, I was the only customer in the place. That's sad! I hope this isn't the case regularly, because I don't want to see a place like this close.

The daily specials can't be beat. For $5 you get a full meal, plus a drink! I was there most recently on a Thursday and was happy to see that a carne asada burrito was the daily offering. I also ordered a side of guacamole, because it's really delicious and fresh made ($3.99).

I overdid it on the guacamole and chips/salsa, because by the time my giant burrito arrived, I was full! I took it home and enjoyed it later that evening and it was just as good!

There is nothing particularly wrong with the service - but this is definitely not why people go to this restaurant. Trust me, this is a spot worth visiting for quick, cheap and delicious Mexican food.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,4,N39NIQfRhAE5qvDrhB5rpg

The restaurant was a little larger than I was expecting and the server approached us immediately for our drink order and we put in an order for guacamole while we looked over the menu.

They have daily specials that all looked amazing. Since it was Tuesday, we both opted for the carne asada tacos special. This comes with three tacos, rice, beans and a drink, all for the low price of $5. How amazing is that. The rest of the menu was extensive and had good prices as well.

Our guacamole arrived and it was heaven in a bowl. Big chunks of avocado and not overly blended, I couldn't get enough. I tried to be a lady, but I really wanted to eat it by the spoonful. For $3.99, it was a great value and the portion was enormous.

Our tacos came out and I was even more amazed. Everything tasted great and I was stuffed and very happy by the end of my meal. 

Service was attentive and refills were plentiful. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu and, of course, to order more guacamole.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,19,19,5,khy0a87_c8LEFHmtgOtKfw
