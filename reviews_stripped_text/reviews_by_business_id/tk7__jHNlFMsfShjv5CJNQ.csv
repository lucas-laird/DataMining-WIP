1024100,2015-01-04,1,tk7__jHNlFMsfShjv5CJNQ,"I live in the LA area and whenever I'm in Vegas I make sure to stop here for some Serbian food! Is it 100% authentic? No, but good luck getting that outside of Chicago...it's as authentic as you're going to get in the western United States and I'm a big fan! I love their Kara?or?eva nicla and burek...the ?evapi are OK, not as good as Aroma Cafe in LA but still good. My girlfriend (not Serbian) has had the gove?i gula and sarma and she seemed to like both...I tried both and they were good, though not as good as my mom's and deda's cooking :D The service has been great here every time I've gone, MUCH better than my one experience at the other Serbian establishment in Vegas, Cafe Derbi. On that note, all the smoke is a legitimate concern and not for everybody, but having been to Serbia many times and not being a smoker myself I guess you could say I'm used to it...still, this place is WAY more ventilated than Derbi, even if it's smaller, so if you're worried about smoke while you're eating (and rightfully so) this is the better option.

I love me some Prince...I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas! Vidimo se!!! :D",thJ_NcbEYMKqYh0m-3ZZ4g,6,3,5,bA0Cm6vU8W4LdE8d_nS1HQ

1920854,2015-03-22,3,tk7__jHNlFMsfShjv5CJNQ,"The best way I can describe Prince is by calling it a dive bar with greasy Ukranian/Serbian food, except in a good way. The décor and atmosphere are nonexistent but the staff are friendly and the food is good. They have a full bar and indoor smoking- patio seating available if you're not a fan.

Majority of the clientele here are from Europe, so don't get offended when you're asked where you're from- it's not meant in a rude way. But don't be a stereotypical boring American diner and get the shish kabob, ask for a recommendation or pick something from the specialty entrees section and prepare to be impressed.

I opted for the Makedonska Pljeskavica, which is a gyro-like meat stuffed with mozzarella, ham, mushrooms, and cream cheese, between two slices of soft, oily bread. Definitely split this order, as it's a giant portion AND unhealthy. Add a shopska salad to lighten things up- cucumber, pepper, tomato, and feta with a vinegar-oil dressing.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,4,4,dwOE3Gnr1ZAM7QquJPy2ow

For there shopska salad, they use the cheapest roma tomatoes, and while you pay $5.50 for a plate, you have about 3 soup spoons of salad, seriously??!!
The chevape who ever says are out of this world or best in there life, those people probably never ever tried authentic chevape!! They have no taste, they were over cocked, they did not even smell on chevape. Same as the pljeskavica... Tasteless rubbery ground meat. Veshalica was acceptable but again not even close to how should be. Big plater with meat for at least 3 people to eat but fries for one person...what s joke.
Nobody cares if u enter it or not, very unwelcome atmosphere, very dark, have to use phone light to read the menu. 
Service was unbelievable terrible, the owner was there but he dose not care for customers, the only thing this person cares is to put money in his pocket. 
We asked for bread 3 times and ketchup as well... On the end waitress asks if everything was OK???! Seriously???

This restaurant is the size of an average cafe and kept dark and cool most days.  The bar at the end is typically occupied by a lot of gruff, affable Balkan expats watching sports and smoking, something we could see but not smell from our spot due to what I assume is excellent ventilation.

Don't let the size of the venue fool you, they serve up some serious grub.  The opska salata was fresh, delicious, and spot-on.  The sarma was beautifully-constructed but the kisela kupus had taste/texture of having been frozen (not that big of a deal). The sampling of beers and spirits from the region was wonderful and punctated a great walk down memory lane,  We left so full and happy that we can't wait to come back.",7JAdkaWbXuXA4YULqxKaMg,1,0,4,cnH_f_IGYgl35czUd_5lSQ

The good:  Our server was gracious and attentive. The ?evapi, Pljeskavica, pork schnitzel and Kruh were fine. You should order them to go

The bad: We were not allowed to order tap water. only bottled. I get the feeling that not being from the Balkans will substantially change what you are charged and served. Maybe you will experience something different. They nickel and dimed us for some sauces, which isn't that big of a deal, but it would've been nice to have been told this would happen. I asked for hot sauce, i got some canned hot peppers.

Don't get the meat plate. The chicken, sausage, and pork on a stick were disappointing. pan friend meat without salt or flavorings. I suggest just ordering the above a la carte.

The front of house atmosphere was lacking, not a place for an adventurous first date, even if you know they don't mind dive joints. Lots of dark corners and bright florescent light, I felt like i was eating in a back alley. 

If i return, i'll bring along some Serbian friends. Or, i'll ask them to check it out so i can further investigate if non-Balkans are taken for a ride.",ljBH91Qi0Xe53CzJWcsO_g,3,0,2,CxgJ5WNUf8kIjNrt5eu7tA

I was glad they had Karlova?ko on the drinks menu. Even though they did not have any in stock we still enjoyed a Nektar beer. It's so hard to find these beers in Vegas. 

We both had the mixed meat plate... First let me say, as expected the portions are enough for 2-3 people. We could have easily shared a plate between the two of us, but we were looking forward to taking leftovers home. 

It comes with ?evap?i?i, pork steak, pljeskavica, and additional meats, salat, pomfrit, and a basket of kruh. Everything was cooked to perfection. It wasn't the best ?evap?i?i, but it captured the overall flavor.

5228749,2015-03-19,2,tk7__jHNlFMsfShjv5CJNQ,"Prince's is right around the corner from where I live, but I'd never seen it before a friend took me and my fiancee out last night. 

We got there a little early, so I pulled up the Yelp reviews, and I was worried about all the smoke that was mentioned, but looking forward to some great food. 

We walked in, and its a dark little spot, with a bar set up in the corner, and a handful of tables. 

It was a LITTLE smokey, and you are allowed to smoke inside.  It wasn't bad though, and I'm very sensitive to excess smoke, but it really wasn't awful. 

Our server/bartender was awesome, offering recommendations, and checking up on us frequently.

For drinks, the guys had a shot of a Serbian brandy, which I was too scared to try.  
I had a fresh squeezed orange juice with lemon drink that was awesome!  I actually had two.  My fella had an ""orangina"" which was like a non alcoholic mimosa (sparkling water with oj type of taste.) 

For appetizer, we had sarma, which is lamb, rice, and spices wrapped in cabbage.  I would eat this all day, every day.  It was wonderful, and the portion was enough for three of us.  

The boys got salads with tomatoes and cucumbers, which I hate, so I wasn't a fan, but if you like these kind of salads, you'd probably enjoy it. 

The bread basket was great as well.  The bread was crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside...just wonderful, and went well in the ""sauce"" of the sarma. 

For the entrees: 
I had ?evapi sausage sandwich, with homemade bread, onions, and a butter/sour cream type sauce.   The sausage is veal and beef, and was very flavorful. 
Not 100% sure that I enjoyed it on the bread, because it fell a part a little, but I loved all of the individual aspects of the dish.  

My fella had Makedonska Pljeskavica: Ground steak stuffed w/ mozzarella, ham, mushroom, and cream cheese spread on house made bread. This was enormous.  I thought it was pretty tasty, but he wasn't fond of the cream cheese filling.  The meat seemed to be more of a gyro meat consistency, which again, he didn't care for.  I loved it though, and thought it was great. 

My friend had Kara?or?eva nicla: pork loin schnitzel stuffed with mozzarella cheese, cream cheese, and ham; rolled and breaded; fries; slaw. 
This was the best entree, and I don't like port.  lol  It was really tender, and delicious.  

Portions were generous for the price.  
I have every intention of coming back, and frequently.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,7,3,4,tVKv-uvCANYvqVn6_gfksw

I've found this little niche near my place without pics and decided I've give it proper pictures. We all know without pics we're not going. 
I parked in the back because driving by in the afternoon sunset was difficult to see. Really must pay attention. 
The restaurant is cozy, clean, and the manager who greeted me was friendly; along with the staff. 
Since this is the first time being in a Serbian I asked to try their traditional foods. ""stuffed cabbage(beef, rice and no tomatoes)"", ""cucumber salad with tomato and feta cheese"", and ""cordon bleu""(baked stuffed pork(homemade cheese, and ham with sour creme) along with a special homemade dipping sauce(bell peppers, tomato, garlic all hand chopped and cooked really long to make it pasty and purée). 
Appetizers are around 7ish and entrees are about 15ish. 

overall, the stuffed cabbage and cordon bleu hit the spot. :)
