I sure didn't until I started YELPING around and found this little gem!

I'm in Vegas working a conference this week, and my colleagues and I were looking for a nice, reasonably priced option for dinner. 

We thought Japanese sounded good, so I started looking and found Tokyo Japanese restaurant. Unfortunately, I can't eat fish anymore (digestive stuff) but the rest of my party said the quality was top notch (and it sure looked good!)...

They also have some teriyaki and breaded katsu pork cutlets. These weren't AS good - but come on, it's a sushi place. Totally reasonable for all you can eat (and includes salads, meso soup and a scoop of ice cream!) anywhere---let alone just off the strip in Vegas!

428929,2010-05-05,0,fB4cb6uvz-QngtYP0fbfAw,"Insanely good find!

We were visiting from out-of-town and staying on the strip, but decided to check out something a bit outside the ""normal"" zone. This place was rated highly on Yelp, and so a taxi-ride later ($20), we were there. Where ""there"" is exactly is hard to say for us, and we had to look around to find the exact location of the place (it's in the middle ""island"" building on the right). It's located right in the middle of some Korean restaurants, and is definitely not your standard ""strip"" business - it's not at all notable from the outside.

The inside is another matter. We chose to sit at the bar to watch the itamae at work, but we liked the set up of the tables and the main room. I was immediately intrigued by the aquariums in the back that housed live flounder, prawns, and abalone. I inquired about the abalone (it wasn't on the menu), and was a bit taken aback at the price ($25), but ordered it anyway due to the fact that we were on vacation, and I couldn't recall ever seeing it on a menu before. It was fantastic - very nice, firm, texture and a very oceany- (almost uni-like) taste.

I decided to have some of the prawn, too (also not on the menu), and was very pleased with that, too. They serve the prawn raw, first, and after you've had the tail, they then tempura-fry the head. It was extraordinary!

We had some other dishes, too: some of them ordered by us, and some of them presented to us by the owner (we ordered a few things that weren't in-stock, and I think it was a very nice and appreciated gesture). Everything we had, from start to finish, was just excellent: fresh tako, hamachi, and unagi sushi, and a HUGE ""special"" maki roll. The sake was good, and reasonably priced too. I was so full by the end of the meal, I couldn't fit any uni, and that's a first for me!

The only (very minor) complaint I have is that they didn't have closed-captioning on the TV's. 

I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fantastic meal of sushi in Vegas.. It doesn't have the ambiance of a Tao or Koi, and it's not a teppenyaki place, but that's not what I'm looking for in a sushi restaurant anyway. We spent over $50/person (because we wanted to..the food was GOOD!) but could just as easily have spent $25/person if we wanted to be more wallet-conscious.

We'll definitely be going back the next time we're there!",w5xMAsu9rEIRffew5nmyig,0,0,5,_gikM9JNn5cNHZwJcaYrWQ

However, the latest reviews I read prior to dining here the first week of 2013 indicated a decline in standards.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with those reviews.  The sushi was still very tasty.  Seafood still nice and fresh. The presentation was still gorgeous. The art of sushi as it affects quality is on the downhill slide.  The rolls were somewhat sloppy.  About 50% of the pieces fell apart when we tried to pick them up.  If they continue with this, they'll be forced to serve the sushi with a spoon. The edamame, Shumai and miso soup were all served at barely above room temperature.  A huge disappointment for such simple principles. Hot food- hot.  Cold food- cold.

While it isn't exactly in a nice area, once you step in the quaint little eatery it takes your mind off the dark strip mall you just came from. 

First of all, the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that I visited the restaurants' website. Big mistake, they apparently haven't updated the site in years. The site claims they do tepenyaki style dining, they don't. It states that beverages begin at $3.50, and they most certainly do not. Furthermore, the menu is almost completely different in every way. After I got over the shock of nothing being what I had expected I began to appreciate the restaurant for what it is today. A great place to eat sushi!

My boyfriend and I ordered the Las Vegas Boat, a Sapporo and Nigori Sake all to share, bringing our bill to $85, not bad for the tremendous amount of food and service we were given.

None of the rolls were anything spectacular. Wouldn't ever order rolls here. There was no taste to them. 

Service was pretty good. At the start of our evening it was great as we were the only table in there but as the night progressed it got worse & worse having to wait far to long for items. Part of my dining party actually left since they were tired of waiting for the rest of us to get food.

The WX4 roll was great. A California roll with spicy tuna and a fried scallop on top. Probably my favorite.

The Yellowtail Lover had a California roll with spicy yellowtail and masago on top covered very lightly with a spicy lemon garlic sauce.

The China Roll, shrimp tempura with spicy tuna on top, was average.

Many of the rolls have a California roll base. But they are not heavy with the sauce and I like that. There was only one other couple when we arrived and the sushi chefs were working but they prepare the sushi slowly. So order quickly.

Once inside staff is attentive and welcoming. The décor is dated and they are always playing ABBA. You will be seated immediately on a Saturday night. None of that- is your whole party here or it'll be 45 minutes and you have to stand outside business. The booths are the best place to sit. You can actually hear the other people at your table talk. You can stretch your arms out and not hit another person. TJP is close to my house too. Can you see why I come here so often? Doesn't the place you always go to sound like a pain in comparison? That's not all. Even if you eat a la carte you get lots of FREE stuff like miso soup, cucumber salad, edamame, and a scoop of ice cream. Think about that when ordering so you don't get too much food. They have many gourmet rolls to choose from loaded with mayo sauce this ponzu that. I usually get the marinated mackerel sashimi. It's oily and rich. I also order the Hamachi kama. The appetizer is a very generous portion (in comparison to your favorite place) served with a bitter greens salad and a thousand island dressing. It's great with a giant beer.

You were on your way downtown for a night of drinking because it's close.

Our meal started with miso soup, chawanmushi, and namasu.  The small sashimi plate came with almost 30 pieces of assorted fish.

The sashimi plate also comes with some side dishes that we were unaware of -- we were surprised when they brought us saba, a corn and cheese dish, and grilled mushrooms.  I was so full by the time the chicken/tempura dinner came.  It was so much food, I couldn't eat anymore.  Hubby thought the chicken was overcooked and a little dry.  He said the tempura was okay.

2945951,2010-01-23,4,fB4cb6uvz-QngtYP0fbfAw,"Some people come to Vegas to gamble in the casinos. I took a culinary gamble at Tokyo Japanese Restaurant and hit the jackpot.

Glitz and bling doesn't dazzle me. Feeling the soul of a chef in the food does. And this unassuming restaurant off the strip overwhelmed me with good vibes and good food.

For those without cars, expect to pay $20+ each way for a cab to the Commercial Center from just about anywhere on the the strip. For those with cars, lucky you, there is heaps of parking. The vast parking lot encircled by a small collection of ethnic restaurants is disconcerting, but patience and courage will pay off.

The men behind the counter will shout their greetings upon your entrance and the women in kimonos will bring you hot tea, a hot towel, and a small bowl of edamame to start you off.  Included with the platter of wasabi and ginger (which you will hardly need, because the food is seasoned adequately) is a little marinated cucumber salad.

Everything we ate was delicious. Hamachi belly and smelt roe nigiri, freshwater eel roll, spicy tuna roll, and live ama ebi shrimp that the sushi chef pulled from the tank to order. 
They also served us a sizzling platter of king oyster mushrooms, and a fillet of broiled hamachi, which the kitchen sent out. From others' reviews, I see that the mushroom dish is not an unusual nibble to get from the kitchen. Everyone appreciates that little gesture! 
We had green tea and ginger ice cream for dessert.

Expecting a large bill, we were stunned to have dined in Las Vegas for just $45, feeding two.  The fact that every other business in town is driven to separate you from your money as quickly as possible, this was such a refreshing change. 

There are tatami rooms for fancier folk, small group booths in the common dining area, and the counter. We ate at the counter, chatted with the other diners, who all seemed to be locals rather than tourists like us, and everyone insisted that *this* was the place to come for sushi.

Sure, there was no douchey bartender with a faux-hawk shaking mediocre $13 cocktails by bouncing them off his shoulders, and I do acknowledge that this seems to be a quality in high demand at most places on the strip, so if that's what you like, you won't find it here.
Pretension and extravagance can be left at the door!

Thankfully, I like a little quiet, and I like dining in well-lit spaces where I can actually see my food and see other happy diners. 

If there is one place in this city I will go out of my way to recommend to my friends, and say it is worth the effort, it is here.",qunxFdBDVl0ordRJEPVNtQ,4,2,5,ykxWLQvQB0gyxK3l9Tuhig
2953648,2011-01-24,0,fB4cb6uvz-QngtYP0fbfAw,"Me and my fiancée(before our wedding) were looking for a good place to eat before we went to vegas for our honeymoon. The reviews were so good for this restaurant we decided to go here for our first dinner. 

We had a little trouble finding the place and the strip mall is pretty empty when we went there. But there were a lot of cars around this restaurant so that had to be a good sign. 

We ordered variety of stuff. Before our food arrived we got miso soup and the steamed eggs(I dont know what you call it..) and it was awesome!!! Miso soup was on the warm side but still tasted great! I especially loved the egg dish, my favorite!!! 

When we were done with that we got our Shrimp tempura appetizer. Very cheap and nice portion if you don't want to get really full before your meal. 

Then we got our shrimp tempura udon. Shrimp tempura udon was ok... I wouldn't order it again though. Having owned a japanese restaurant and cooking there I like my udon better lol 

After that we got the sushi that we've ordered. Salmon, Halibut, and white tuna sushi. All the sushi was very fresh and had no fishy smell at all. You've got to try their Halibut.... It is one of the best in my opinion. 

As we ate about half of our sushi dish we got the other orders. Tokyo Special roll, a tuna with avocado dish that I can't remember its name, and the screaming orgasm. Tokyo special roll was ok but the other 2 dishes were great!!! My wife does not like tuna at all because of the fish smell but she tried both of the dishes and enjoyed both of them. I could tell that they are very careful about keeping their fish slicing knife very very clean. 

Even when we got all of these dishes, we almost finished all of our food. The waitress and the owners were very nice. Place wasn't too fancy to intimidate you. 

Oh yeah and you get ice cream at the end for free too!!

Overall 5 stars!!!!!!!! Great place to go if you're looking to eat Japanese food at a cheap price compared to the other ones in town!!",gbrmNS0XB2G5yOa8PwplEg,0,1,5,Doh5uABZoaBgefT98dQ4vw
2966943,2010-06-01,1,fB4cb6uvz-QngtYP0fbfAw,"Don't be fooled by the shady looking strip mall area that looks ripe for gang activity at night. This place is a gem. They definitely are in the low rent district on the Sahara side of the strip and is Korean (not Japanese) owned. They do a great job in providing good sushi (even though they are far from the ocean) and their preparation and presentation are very good. This rivals some of the best Japanese restaurants on the strip without the high price. We had the tatami room with a party of 11 and the service was friendly and attentive. They even gave us a ride back to our hotel in their own cars....what service. 

Their teriyaki meats aren't very good, but their yakitori is excellent, don't know why that is. Top picks also include sushi, sashimi, udon, unagi, agedashi tofu, gyoza, chawanmushi, and chirashi.

I had a serious bias the first time I went since my then boyfriend had found the place with his ex and I really hate the *itch so I truly wanted to hate this place simply because it was associated with her. Man was I disappointed to find everything fresh and delicious! Im a fan of the variety and the authentic menu. Yeah they know they're in Nevada (lots of variations of the California roll) but there's so much of what the regular American Mc foodie would never touch I was grudgingly impressed right away. Food took time but it didnt bother me a bit since I watched them make it. Preggers me still found my ever expanding arse happily settled in and ready for a face stuffing session with plenty to consider from their baked rolls. Ive been so happy with their sushi menu Ive never actually tried anything from their regular menu but hope to soon. I always get a bowl of rich miso soup and some edamame to snack on before my meal (no extra charge) and at the end have to coordinate with whomever Im with about the ice cream (u get red bean, I get mango, someone has to get green tea and we're all agreed on sampling rights) all of which makes my little mixed asian heart feel right at home. I agree with others on the location:ghetto and somewhat sketchy but once inside you cant really do better- its a well established mom and pop with enough polish and class to make for some good casual business lunches. Private rooms for parties (baby showers and such) which has always made me happy- I dont have to listen to dumb party games while I get my grub on. They also use those rooms for families with lots of small children. As a mom I appreciate making that kind of room for me and mine so I can enjoy good food without feeling like Im pissing off the whole building. nice clean highchairs and not even a second glance at the mess we make.

As soon as we settled into our hotel suite, we jumped into a taxi, and made our way to Tokyo Japanese Restaurant.

The area is a bit secluded. There are other small restaurants and shops there, but it looked really dead. When we went inside, the restaurant itself was kind of small and there wasn`t really anyone there. Because there was a group of us, they put us in one of their private rooms which was nice.

Their menu wasn`t that big and they didn`t have a lot of options, so we just ordered a bunch of sushi, two rolls, and an order of fresh oysters. We also wanted to get the fun started, so we got a couple shots of Johnny Walker.

As we were eating, the manager walked in and asked us if we were doing okay. Later, we got something special that the manager had sent to us. I don`t know what it was, but it was yummy. She also gave us another round of Johnny Walker shots on the house. AWESOME!!

Overall, the food was okay. The service was great. The prices were pretty reasonable. I`m used to going to sushi bars that have all you can eat, so I expected the bill to be a little more than it would be if we were to go to an all you can eat sushi bar, but the fact that the manager gave us some free food and free shots, it was some what worth it.",Pcz-qJb0s037hU5g78Rrrw,0,0,3,ik5N5MKjVZR3M9nJ6YX6hw

We gave it a solid effort but still left some delicious sushi on the boat.

The restaurant is nicely divided. There's a large open area of tables in the middle, mostly of four-top tables. Then there's rows of booths kind of concealed behind shoji screens. And then there's tatami rooms. Like five of them maybe. 

There's a sushi bar that seats maybe seven people. 

The booth we sat at had padded booth chairs, but then zabuton on top. Kind of funny. 

The parking lot has ample parking because its located in the Commercial Center and there's nothing really happening in the Commercial Center anymore. 

The place is non-descript from the outside. But to me, it looks suspect. It looks like an illegitimate Japanese restaurant. I couldn't put my finger on it before, but I figured it out tonight. The signage uses katakana for the word ""Tokyo"" and not kanji. Plus there's some Korean writing. SUSpect. 

The place might still be Korean-owned, I don't know, but the menu is dedicatedly Japanese. And there's at least one Japanese person working there. 

The moon-faced mama-san looks Korean, though. And she was at the sushi bar with some gaijin doing soju bombs. 

They have sushi, sashimi, rolls, don (bowls), box dinners, etc. 

We just had a bunch of appetizers. Hamachi kama, hamachi and sake sashimi, steamed clams, and deep-fried soft shell crab. 

Everything was good. The hamachi kama was exceptional, but the steamed clams were horrible. They were tiny, looked like they been dissected, and the sake broth they sat in was super strong. I wanted to do shots of the broth. 

The sashimi was good. The pieces were large and of good quality and served with shiso, a requirement. 

With our meal, we also got some complimentary appetizer napa cabbage, sunomono, edamame, and miso soup and at the end we got complimentary ginger or azuki bean ice cream. We tried both. Both were meh.  

The bathroom is stark white and blinding, compared to the softly lit restaurant. 

Everything was clean. But our table was weird because it had a gas pipe looking thing sticking out of the wall and a cowl above. Must've been a yakiniku before.

My cousins were in town from Hawaii and we all wanted to get some Japanese food, but didn't want to fight the crowds at the large popular hotel chains.  Tokyo Restaurant is located about 1-2 miles off the main strip. First thing you need to know is that this restaurant is more home-style cooking. Restaurant owner, Becky, was a nice but a firm Korean lady.  She has owned the restaurant for 9 years.    

I ordered the AYCE Dinner ($26.95) and was given a 90 minute time limit on my meal.  No problem.   All dishes are mini tapa-style plates, and the sushi orders are about 1/2 size of what is normally given in regular sushi bars.  Fun, as you can try many different things with plates this size.  Eat, to the pumping sounds of ABBA playing in the background.

Sashimi Plate:  A combination of hamachi, maguro, salmon, tai snapper, and several other fishes.  This was probably the highlight of my meal.  Nice fish and beautifully presented.  Grade:  A-

Grilled Hamachi:  A 3""x3"" piece of grilled Hamachi yellowfin tuna.  The fish was a bit tough, not because it was over-cooked.  I don't know if it was the quality piece of meat.  Grade:  C

The meal comes with ice cream - vanilla, green tea, and a few others.

What I liked best about the restaurant, was that it was a family-owned environment.  Everyone is welcomed.  One of the female patrons sitting at the sushi bar stood up and shouted.  Then she went around the sushi bar and ended up head-butting her head on the glass counter.   This caused 7-8 glasses of Sake-Beer shooter glasses (*prepared by the sushi chef) to foam immensely.  Everyone at the bar, including the sushi chefs, yelled GAMBATTE and everyone grabbed a glass and shot the sake-beer drink.  Lady - I hope your head is OK as that was a pretty big bang on the sushi bar.  Impressive!

Sean and I took our boyfriend here a few days ago. I really like the atmosphere, and most of the food we tried was amazing. It's rare to find really fresh fish here in Vegas, so having good stuff like this reminded me of some places we go to when we're at our place in Seattle. 

The service is very friendly, though I find it odd that Korean people own a Japanese restaurant, and that only 2 staff are Japanese.

Most places in the mainland can't compare, but I was surprised to find quality sushi in this sort of place.  We decided to order the Love boat which had everything we wanted for $23 a person, it was the best meal I had on this Vegas trip.  It included miso soup, salad with a spicy dressing, shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, assorted sushi, California roll, spicy tuna roll, katsu, yakitori sticks, chicken yakitori, ice cream was also included.  If you get tempura, don't forget to ask for daikon to put in your tempura sauce, it makes it taste better.  All was great, and I'm still happy with the quality of the fish.  Grandparents ordered yosenabe and they said it was good as well.

The worst part about this place is that they put a ranch like sauce on almost every roll. It's just kind of gross.

If while stranded you decide you really need some Japanese, then Tokyo will take care of you. I went for the first time this past weekend, and upon entering I fell in love. As you may know by now, I am a sucker for vibe, any vibe will do, just give me some atmosphere puh-lease, and Tokyo does just that. If I had to label the vibe with one word: umami. (I know it is a taste word, but I am going to start using it for experience.) Booths separated by floor to ceiling walls line each side of the restaurant, so you can really go into hiding here. There are low hung paper lanterns that you have to duck under if you are taller than 5'6"", and the waitresses wear kimonos. I found it very Japanese-refuge. Yes, that is my other new adjective. 

Before the meal starts, you get edamame, a little seaweed and a little cucumber starter. Nice touch. 

I did not have sushi, so I can not help the sushi lovers amongst us. For my entrée, I had a salmon teriyaki dinner. My eyes popped out of my head when it arrived! There were two enormous pieces of salmon. I would say an entire salmon, but my husband coolly reminded me that a salmon is a 50 lb fish. They are served skin on, which should delight fish lovers. It was quality as it tasted fresh, not fishy. The dinner is served with a solid miso soup, rice, a little salad (romaine, not ice), green tea and ice cream. They have GINGER ice cream (and red bean and green tea)! My dinner was $13.50, and I could have easily shared.

My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki/tempura dinner, and the bento box looked like a small shoe closet. I stole a couple of pieces of tempura from her, and they were pleasing. They weren't the crispiest tempura I have crunched, but the vegetables were fresh. My other friend had udon, and he was happy.

The service was friendly, but a little absent-minded. Still, it is the type of place that if you just surrender to the atmosphere, you really won't be bothered by that empty water glass. Just be chill and eat your fish.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,15,5,4,JFJaTINOm3f9d59coGfghQ

I was in the mood for sushi.  But I didn't feel like going to a restaurant on the strip that would charge me $20 for a roll.

I yelped sushi and found Tokyo Restaurant.

For starters, the strip mall where this is located is very dark in the evenings.  Make sure you only go in circles looking for the blue sign that say's ""Tokyo Japanese Restaurant.""

I ordered two rolls which we ok.

However, it came with miso soup, edemame, some mushrooms that I got and to top it off Ice cream at the end.

Where do you go that gives you this stuff for free???? Nowhere.

Stacy whom was behind the sushi bar also serves 3 nights a week.


She made the place a 5 star restaurant.

She was friendly, funny, and charismatic.  In most sushi/ japanese restaurants the people behind the bar don't speak very much (I'm sure not being able to speak English is a factor for that) but Stacy did.  She was a G.  She jokes with ther clients and seems to be liked by them.

The place has the whole in the wall feel to it.  

Everyone is nice and makes you feel welcomed.

The the people coming to vegas to have a good time but also watch what they spend, go to this place and ask for Stacy to take care of you.

The food wasn't bad nor wasn't amazing.  But the experience was good.

I probably would have given this place a 4 star but Stacy was cool and I told her that I was going to give this place a 5 star because of her.

She gets 7 stars.

We decided to go for some Japanese one night. Took us awhile to find this spot because of course our GPS got us lost.

We knew we were in for some good food considering our lives were probably in danger once we parked here. (Hole-in-the-walls are awesome)

Walking into this restaurant I noticed how run-down and old the interior was. We were seated at this booth and the wallpaper was peeling and probably had some mold back there. Eeeeeep! Not the kind of hole-in-the-wall I was expecting!

I didn't feel like doing AYCE like the bf did but opted for their salmon teriyaki which came with a salad, soup, tempura and some rice.

I'd have to say, I was still pretty hungry after my meal but definitely didn't wanna be stuffed and looking like a balloon later that night for our clubbing adventure. 

I feel like some of the fish they serve here isn't the freshest and the way they cut their sushi wasn't too generous either.

I'd suggested Komol for that heavenly herbal salad, but the friend wanted to try Tokyo instead.  I almost bailed but decided I'd go to Tokyo with him, and if I wasn't impressed I'd simply call Komol for an herbal salad to go.

That wasn't necessary.

On the outside I saw a big sign advertising their all you can eat prices.  I don't recall exactly what it was, but it seemed pretty standard pricing for a lunch AYCE ($21 or so).  I'll be honest, I don't really enjoy going to sushi restaurants unless I order AYCE.  It just bothers me to order rolls for $8-$12 a piece when I'm so used to the comfort of ordering and ordering and ordering and ordering knowing I'm paying one set price.  There's too much to choose from that I want to eat, that my brain can't handle having to pick and choose a few select items.  That being said, I treated myself to a more expensive lunch than I'm used to, to fully allow myself to enjoy the experience.

I could never accurately describe everything I ate, but I must say I enjoyed nearly each and every item.  My order consisted of a handful of rolls, 3-4 orders of nigiri, and some side items like miso soup, gyoza, and a small piece of salmon teriyaki.  All of the fish tasted fresh and the side items were prepared as I'm used to at my favorite AYCE places like Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway with the exception of maybe the salmon teriyaki which seemed overcooked to me.

So give Tokyo a visit if you're into AYCE sushi, and if you don't like it as much as I did, remember you always have Komol next door.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,9,10,4,O1zKn2SWzxd-njTasayhQw

As for the food we order. We ordered the chicken teriyaki & tempura combo with the hawaiian and crunch roll. Food was delicious... along with the complimentary miso soup and edamame.
Everything went well, except a comment our waitress made when I asked for more edemame. I mean really?! I don't think it's costing them a lot of money to fill our little bowl with more edemame. When I asked if we could have a little more, she commented back with, it's only for service... (meaning they don't give more then 1 serving) I've been to other restaurants who never had a problem giving me a refill... just saying.
Dinner for 2 cost us around $40 not including tip.

Indoor seating. Located in an old building in an off the strip area. Nothing fancy, whole in a wall type of place with authentic japanese food. I did get lost for a split minute trying to look for then hidden gem... look for their blue sign. There was no wait on Saturday night around 8pm and the restaurant was surprisingly on the empty side.

First place I've stumbled upon in Vegas where the waitress was dressed in kimonos. Love sitting in the wooden booth... very japanesezy,

I would love to come back here again to try more... despite our rude waitress...
Great place to come with friends, date or family night.

If you're looking for a japanese spot off the strip... stop by TJR.

I wish I could give Tokyo Japanese Restaurant a more insightful review, but I was pressed for time while dining here. Our server acknowledged this and made sure my meal came out first. I had a plane to catch so I literally had to engulf my meal within 15 minutes, which my friends sat in their seats with amazement. None-the-less, I still managed to catch my plane and made it home safely.

Tokyo Japanese Restaurant is located off the main Las Vegas strip in a strip mall type of plaza. My friends and I definitely would not have found this place if it wasn't for Yelp.

One of the great features of Tokyo Japanese Restaurant is the amount of food that comes with your meal. For instance I noticed most of the dishes come with soup, salad, rice, pickles, dessert, and green tea. After our group ordered, our server brought us edamame, pickled bean sprouts, pickled cucumbers, and miso soup. 

For my main course I ordered the Sukiyaki ($14.00) that consisted of thinly sliced beef, noodles, and assorted vegetables like onions, napa cabbage, mushroom, and tofu. It came out piping hot and was pretty good. The noodles were springy and the beef was tender. I wished there was more tofu though.

Although I missed out on the green tea ice cream for dessert, the quantity of food provided for the price is very reasonable. My server was also very accommodating given the fact that I had to leave quickly. 

I can't wait to come back and try the sushi or bento boxes on the menu. From the Yelp pictures, there looks to be a lot of food.

Not only I ate delicious nigiri but had a number of different sashimi, and unique rolls. Not all places have uni in the menu. Definitely a plus. I tried for the first time river shrimps, served like soft shell crabs -so different from regular shrimps. 

I sat in the bar and at one point the chef made me a very tasty roll with salmon roe, avocado and shrimp, not in the menu. Other customers were only Japanese, so I guess that is good...

The restaurant is located in that ugly and god forsaken plaza in east Sahara, not far from lotus of Siam. The whole block is worth scouting, thou. There are at least 3 very worthy restaurants: lotus, komol and this one. 

My only complaint is that  fish was not consistently fresh. Some pieces seemed fresher than others, like they had been in the fridge for a while (ebi pieces is a good example).  The standout was, by far, uni and river shrimp, which make the restaurant a quite different experience. 

Finally, the menu looks more interesting that AYCE. I will definitely be back.",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,2,1,3,Dg0Y94P6U2Ky_cUS7b2boA
5918728,2013-01-24,1,fB4cb6uvz-QngtYP0fbfAw,"Same name, same bat channel, and still serving fresh seafood, but now with the AYCE lunch ($21.95, 11:45am to 3pm) and dinner ($26.95 and starts at 3pm) options. It really is a no brainer to head over here for some Japanese cuisine if you are in the neighborhood.  

The sushi chefs that were working tonight are not the A-crew (death in the family prevented the boss from being there this week), but the food prepared and served looked wonderful and tasted great.

Highlights of the dinner AYCE (typically not served elsewhere or items worthy of a special shout out):
6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore, white fish)
6 pieces of spicy sashimi
Uni Shooter (usually not on the AYCE menu; packs a little heat)
Korean B.B.Q. Ribs - operated by Koreans,so they know their kalbi.
Fresh Scallop (Hotategai) - can't be torched, but it was very good.
Fresh Oyster
Mushroom Yaki (Grilled King Oyster Mushroom with Butter)

I ordered most of my usual sushi and special requested some hand roll (temaki), that the sushi chefs were able to accommodate without missing a beat.

Service was good.  The waitstaff cleared away the used plates and refilled the beverage without prompting.

Would I recommend this restaurant? You betcha!

4 stars.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,10,6,4,TI2EOpvaPbDEg1gz3GGqXA
