789327,2017-03-06,0,Rd6f8vuyYgcfg-RPh6GXHw,"Let me start my prefacing that most of the really good BBQ joints have a smoke shack right out back where they prepare their meats, this one being in an airport, doesn't really have that option. That being said, this place was pretty great. Let's talk portion for price, I discovered that in Vegas, nothing is cheap and when places are charging 6$ for a bottle of water, I was pleasantly surprised to see my meal was a lot bigger then I expected it would be. We ordered the chicken and brisket plate. Let's get the negative out of the way first: the green beans had NO flavor and were a bit under done for my liking, the meals get a dose of the house BBQ sauce on everything right before being served and don't get me wrong it was an alright sauce, just a little sweet for me and honestly, the meat didn't need it. Now there were a few things that were in the neutral zone, such as the slaw. I prefer a more vinegar based slaw with a nice bite to it and this one was more mayo based. Still not bad, but just not my favorite. The cornbread was more of a ""corn cake."" It was fluffy, soft and sweet: very tasty but not what I picture when I hear ""cornbread."" On to the good stuff! The brisket was tender and juicy and still had a nice subtle smoke flavor. The chicken quarter fell off the bone and was tender with a sweet, tangy BBQ type sauce. With so many choices packed together at the airport, and everyone competing for your money, it can be overwhelming to make a choice on just what you want to eat. When I walked by and could smell the brisket, I knew I had stumbled on to something good. They were very accommodating and when I asked if it ""Tasted as good as it smelled"" a gentleman (who I think was a the boss man) accepted the challenge and gave me a piece to sample, and the rest is lunch history. I gave this place a solid 4 stars because of price, portion, and main course meats. I was indifferent towards the sides but seeing how there were a couple others to choose from, I am going to give them benefit of the doubt. So next time you get stuck at LAS, down by gate C, go get some brisket!",_Law7uX9jEBeZuFD8Cfiqw,0,0,4,KA9JhCG7n4taOpxhPo84vQ

2478180,2017-10-22,5,Rd6f8vuyYgcfg-RPh6GXHw,"I don't expect much from airport food. It's often no surprise when airport food is overpriced and not that great. Thus it was a real big surprise when I found quite the opposite at Brookwood Farms at the Southwest terminal at McCarran international airport.

It was early in the morning and I hadn't had breakfast yet. Lines were long at Starbucks, Coffee Bean and at Burger King. The Burger King happened to be right next to Brookwood Farms and I would've easily passed by Brookwood Farms without giving it a second thought but I'm so glad i didn't. I saw nice displays of various different biscuits and gravy on display. They all looked so good that I decided to give it a try.

I asked for the biscuits with ham and gravy. The lady helping me brought out two fresh baked biscuits and proceed to put layers of ham on top. She then scooped up a bunch of scrambled eggs and then drizzled the whole with gravy. The whole time I was in awe. I didn't expect her to pile the biscuits as she did. There were at least three large pieces of ham on there and lots and lots of scrambled eggs. It was more than enough to share. All of this food and it only cost me $5.40 ($4.99 + .41)! It was truly unbelievable the amount food and the price I paid. I would easily have paid double that the neighboring places at the airport.

Now taste wise, it was great as well. The biscuits were fresh and soft. The ham and eggs were just right and the gravy was rich and tasty. The gravy even had little bits of sausage in it. It was truly drool worthy!

It's not often that I rave about airport food but I have to say I became a fan of Brookwood Farms that day. With it's big portion and very affordable prices, I was one happy traveler.",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,8,7,4,Dyjw_ciq0gllQSne0j61GQ

When I grew up in NC, Brookwood Farms was a go to brand for pulled pork barbeque IF you absolutely had to get some at a grocery store. That means it was pretty good for a store brand. 

Anyway, typical airport place here with high prices for a trapped audience. But the portions are large and drinks are self-serve. Their pulled pork sandwich, Carolina style with slaw on top, is huge and messy! Not in a bad way, but juicy and delicious. Even though there is obviously no smoker in sight (key sign of a bad BBQ joint) the meats have been thoroughly smoked somewhere and even at the end of the day seem fresh enough. For the Carolina BBQ, they top the pork marinated in a plain vinegar sauce with another sauce made with ketchup. So you get two Carolina styles mixed into one, but it works. Overall not your typical airport fare. So if you are travelling through here, give this place a try... I know will again next time!",zHNT3D_T3ZM6Y8c0GLH7nQ,0,1,4,DNNltShT2wJSzDdHvyUVig

The meat was already cooked and placed in a grill to quickly warm it up. The sides resided in individual compartments. Freshness wasn't expected and they delivered on that point.

I craved some BBQ and this satisfied it a bit.

At least, the lady behind the register was nice and the drink had free refills (ideal for a lengthy or unexpected layover).

Tri-tip with two sides plus refillable drink (and tax) = ~$18

Brookwood apparently does BBQ later in the day but their breakfast is definitely not the worst thing I have eaten in an airport. You can get 2 big biscuits, sausage patties and gravy for under $7 - it's a lot of food and for an airport, the prices are quite reasonable.
