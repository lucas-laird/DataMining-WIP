And it's not because she was mean, but because she never comes by.
I even had to ask her for silverware and when the rest of my party came, had to ask for them too.
They don't fill up your  and you have to ask for everything, we had to actually flag her down for the check.
My mom went up to pay the bill and the lady actually told my mom to wait because she was ""busy""
There were only 2 other tables occupied.

Basically this place is only good if you're there for the food. If customer service doesn't matter to you then this place is ideal.

That being said, I don't think I will ever come back. Good customer service is something I NEED with good food in order to consider coming back.",8Xko6Kye0u2o2jbLtj5vHw,3,2,2,lL0pxVQ-KHW4p7DPoo_zpw

807063,2015-07-29,0,Lzg7YuoP1SDyg2S5lvBvhg,"I was looking forward to giving this place another try since it's been under new management. Back when it was called Mashisoyo, I felt that the meat dishes were adequate but the soondubu tofu soups were extremely lacking in depth and flavor. And very stingy on the amount of meat in the soups.

So I was hoping for an improvement in the flavor of the tofu soups, but unfortunately, after giving them another two chances, I'm writing this place off entirely. Perhaps it's under new management, but maybe the cooks haven't changed.  

I love soondubu. I've had a lot of it, and it's one of my favorite dishes ever. Mr.Tofu was my absolute favorite place to have it, but unfortunately they have changed owners and it's gone totally downhill.

But I can honestly say that Mashisoyo/Good Fella has the worst soondubu I've ever tried. Zero flavor to it. Just tastes like water soup with some chili flakes in it. Disappointing, since I was hoping for an improvement with the change in management.  I wish there was something redeeming about it, as the employees seem nice enough. And it's one of the very few Korean restaurants in the far Southwest area of town. But sadly, it's just not worth compromising on flavor just for convenience.

Oh well, maybe one day I'll give the rest of the menu a try. But one thing's for sure (at least for me)... don't bother wasting your money on their soondubu.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,1,2,YStXXOUDK_t1BHvkW0FjiQ

Bibimbap: lacked any flavor as well..had to use a LOT of the red sauce to give it some life, unfortunately.

The banchan (side dishes) were good, especially the kimchee.  Good rule of thumb in korean restaurants, if the kimchee is good then the rest of the food will be delicious.

I wanted to see if the new owners would improve this restaurant, because at the end of the Mashisoyo run, the old owners decided to take a big crapola on that business. Suffice to say, I thought everything here was OK.

The new owners haven't deviated from the original concept of Mashi, with the exception of being able to grill meats right on your table, whereas it was previously only available cooked beforehand in the kitchen. I didn't get to try this, but in the future, who knows?

This time, I wanted to try their soondoobu soup. I remember that the previous restaurant had a really crappy one on my last visit there. Hopefully that would have changed with the new owners.

The banchan came first, and by the way it tasted, things were not going to look so great. The only side dish that I thought was remotely interesting was the radish kimchi. It had a nice crunch, the sauce was well prepared, and it wasn't bitter at all. The other side dishes were pretty forgettable. The waitress was kind enough to refill my side dishes frequently.

The soondoobu soup came out. First, I think it should have been must hotter, temperature wise. It was barely bubbling. When I cracked my egg in, a lot of the albumen did not cook all the way. About the flavor. I gotta say that it was improved over the last visit when it was Mashisoyo. The broth is better, but didn't really blow me over or anything.

Everything was alright, but I don't know if I would come back for the soondoobu. I'd like to come back and try some of their other entrées, cause I'm like that. Oh, and I think Ace of Base should have a reunion tour. End.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,19,15,3,_prdk3rgnIe1tzsQQ2PqPw

So what's a girl supposed to do...I guess keep on searching for Korean restaurants to pop up....Lol

So when Good Fella popped up on Yelp and I started to read the reviews...I was a little hesitant as the reviews were mixed... But the pictures of the food is what drew me... The pictures looked delicious which is always a huge plus. 

When I walked in I realized that I had been to this location before when it was a soondubu restaurant and again when it was a Mexican taco joint...

But the cool thing with Good Fella is that they must've bought the other place next to them to give them a larger dining area. Very cool and more seating which is a plus for me. :)

I got greeted right away and say right away. Restaurant was totally empty but after I had ordered and was picking on the ban chans...a few more tables walked in. The ban chans were all great which is always a good start to any Korean restaurant... If they pay attention to the dishes that are given away for free and they rock... There is a greater chance that the actual dishes will be great. :)

I ordered the Kim chi jun which was crispy on the edge and flavor was just right served on sizzling plate. I don't think that there is another Korean restaurant that serves this in Vegas. Most places carry the seafood jun which I hate. Their Kim chi was delicious and the flavor carried through in their jun. It brought back happy childhood memories of eating this with my sisters. Definitely be back just for this! 5/5

I also got the tteokboki... And it was so delicious!!!!! The texture of the tteok was chewy yet soft and the flavor was really balanced. It was spicy with a hint of sweetness. It came with o-dang(fish cakes) and of course a hard boiled egg. This really was one of the best I've had in Vegas. This dish beat out the same dish at Soyo and Mammah Oh's.  (10/5)

It has that mom and pop feel to me. The person who helped me (I'm assuming he's the owner) was really sweet and made sure I had everything I needed. 

I ordered the seafood tofu soup with kalbi combo. I asked for medium spice and it had the perfect amount of kick to it. The soup totally hit the spot since it was pretty chilly outside. The soup comes with a raw egg that you crack into it and the heat is suppose to cook the egg. While my soup was boiling when it came out, it still wasn't hot enough to cook the egg so I asked the owner if he could re-heat the soup for me and he gladly did so. Some of kalbi was on the fatter side but it had that nice char taste that I like. I just wished it came with more kalbi pieces!

The interior is simple bad... The restaurant seems unfinished. No other special features.

I might try this place again later. Maybe it was just a bad day for Good Fella.",vsZy481c3AVrl1ht-qwMuA,0,0,3,xHR2JbSCFgemzT9XFMl8gA

Cute little spot.  The staff is very friendly as it seems like a ""mom and pop"" shop, which I usually prefer to franchises and large chain restaurants. 

I ordered the Dolsat Bibimbap (I think I spelled this right).  It was excellent.  My girl says this place has some of the best Bibimbap in town.  Don't let the restaurants simple exterior fool you.

My girl ordered some cold noodles.  I am unsure the name, but perhaps after looking at their menu online it's the Mul Naengmyeon?  They were fantastic, whichever it was.  The male server was shocked that my ""white girl"" girlfriend ordered such a Korean dish that he says he only has seen 3 times ordered by someone who isn't Korean.  My girl says this is the first place she's ever had this dish after visiting many Korean restaurants here in Vegas and SoCal and this dish is excellent here.

The wait staff was nice.  I think they seemed to like us.  It helped it was a slow Friday night so the male server made small talk with us.  My girl speaks a little Korean so her ordering in Korean (being a white girl) shocked the staff.. which is why the gave us complimentary fried dumplings (mandu?).  These were fantastic and extremely fresh.

5073419,2015-09-19,2,Lzg7YuoP1SDyg2S5lvBvhg,"My wife and I had a personal tragedy yesterday and we were looking to cheer each other up with some of her favorite comfort food - Korean.

We did our typical Yelp search as it serves as our only guide in a valley still new to us and found Goodfella.  Now I had my misgivings.  I'm from an Italian neighborhood in Chicago so, naturally, I was intrigued to make the connection.

My wife is observant about lots of things, but it comes to restaurants, she wants to see people of the same ethnic background going to the same cuisine (Italians at Italian bistros, Chinese at Chinese, etc.).  She noticed right off that plenty of Koreans were popping in and out of their establishment.  Another person we noticed was the ever present elder in the corner watching tv.  Now, in Chicago, I've noticed that elders in the restaurant are the silent overseers of the establishment - kind of like the gargoyles sitting atop French churches keeping an eye on the city.  It's comforting and reassuring.

Gino cooks and Yung, his wife, manages everything else.  It's a team that works and produces, hands down, the best Korean food we've found in the valley.  So much better that they're close to home and a bargain compared to our former staple of Ginseng BBQ2 on the strip.  

Yung and Gino went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  We got the feeling like we were given the private chef's table in the kitchen like some of the old, authentic Italian restaurants back home are famous for.  Gino, a well travelled man of culture, shared with us his philosophy on Korean food.

Authenticity.

Gino has a distaste for fusion.  Why?  Because it dilutes the cultural heritage of a cuisine by trying to make it adapt to a Western palette.  He believes in cooking and doing one thing good and it's making authentic Korean food.  

The result is delicious.

He pulled up a chair and regaled us with stories of his time lived in various places such as New York and Chicago - his culinary adventures there and the experiences he's had.  We could have talked all night - it was like we were being entertained by Andrew Zimmern or Samantha Brown.

Anyway, I'm gushing.  Since we ordered so much food, we had plenty of take home.  Gino made sure that we understood how to properly warm up our food so we could enjoy our japchae (the best I've ever had) again the next morning.

Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad at all, but I wouldn't say it's the best either. What turned me off was the price point.

We went last Sunday, a little after they opened at 1. We were the first customers that day, when we walked in a younger lady was sitting by the kitchen just staring at us. It was kinda awkward for a minute since she didn't say anything, then a middle aged man walks up to welcome us and led us to a table of our choice. The place is tiny yet cozy, feels like home in a way.

Nothing in the menu really stood out for me, there wasn't really much to choose from. I'm not into Korean soups but I do like Korean BBQ and bibimbap. We decided on an order of Bulgogi, Korean spicy pork and Kimchi fried rice. Both the meat dishes were flavorful, of the two I like the spicy pork the best. It was sliced very thinly almost like bacon slices with just the right amount of heat which was perfect for me since I don't really like spicy food all that much. The Kimchi fried rice wasn't up to par at all, I can say in all honesty that what I make at home tastes way better than what was served. 4 out of the 6 banchan was good so no complaints there.

So for 2 dishes, Kimchi fried rice and 3 drinks, the total came out to $55 including a 20% tip, roughly $15 per meat dish which is kinda high in my opinion especially when there's plenty of competition around, for the same amount of food and quality for $3 less.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,4,5,3,xVIat5f-IKkem1iFduNnyQ

I decided on the bibim naengmyeon while my boyfriend went with the jajangmyeon. It took them a good 15ish minutes to bring out our banchan and another 20ish minutes to bring out our food. It took them a long time despite there being NO ONE eating at the restaurant aside from the other table. Especially for the dishes that we ordered, it shouldn't take that long. It's noodles and sauce! 

The jajangmyeon was average. For my bibim naengmyeon, it was decent but they had way too much sauce. After a few bites, I just got really bored of the flavor and the yummyness of it died off. 

So for the average food and the extremely long wait .. it certainly makes me not want to come back.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,0,2,xlH04jLVoaO8PGggqs3pUA

The ban chan selection was good and the owner came to check on us a few times.  The place seems to have expanded since this was Mashisoyo.  The décor seems to need a little work, but this place worked for us since it was quiet and we have an infant =)  Oh and I noticed they have Korean fried chicken on the menu.  Will definitely need to try that at the next visit to determine if it is legit!",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,5,2,4,3g1wCHcl8TItOKymJ0zagQ

Their kimchi is perfect.  I've tried a few dishes which were all amazing, but haven't found a spot that can make jja-jjang meun like my mom...and it's finally happened!  That passed the final test. 

And this is home cookin made to order!!  If you want your food in 5 min and not made with love...go to Panda Express.  No fast food here! 

If you're looking for delicious Korean food, great service, and a cozy spot....you've gotta come here.  Can't wait to bring my Korean mama here next week. Usually we end up cooking at the house because we can't find anywhere here to eat!  And after 6 years...we've tried most in the Vegas valley. We'll definitely be on a first name basis soon. :)))",3GXYDsq39ocLBuGhtA-ohQ,1,2,5,uceAoVYy9pEYaqPq_DM8DQ

Since this restaurant been under new management the number of customers has picked up during lunch. Most of them being Korean which says a lot about the quality of the food.

The only negative is they're closed on Monday.",S_FzMzMS26qTTePxfL5eUw,2,1,5,k3rLdLABrVGwldO0jomcXg

So they've reduced the menu quite a bit, to only include the more popular items. I like small menus. It means you don't have to take as long to decide what to eat. I decided to get the soondubu combo with the kalbi. The soondubu arrived boiling hot and it was yummy! It hit the spot! It wasn't as spicy as other places I've gone to but I'm sure they can spice it up to the spicy level that you want. The kalbi was also very delicious. It was tender and the marinade on it was just perfect. They also gave you a good serving. 
The service was also on point. It's rare to find good service nowadays. The waiter was always there when we needed him and he was checking on us frequently, not an annoying frequently, but just right! He also grabbed us more sides since he noticed that we've finished all the fish cakes, without even asking for more. I appreciate observant servers because you don't have to ask for things. They just know already and it's great!

I highly recommend!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,5,2,5,yyK8C-jjbcqzriNEyXb2uQ

The prices are about average for what you would find in any type of Korean restaurant, but you will be satisfied with the amount of food they bring to the table.
