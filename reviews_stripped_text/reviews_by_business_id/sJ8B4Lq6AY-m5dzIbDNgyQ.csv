3391483,2013-08-20,6,sJ8B4Lq6AY-m5dzIbDNgyQ,"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat, as I was running very late to meet friends. I normally avoid places like this, but when you are in a hurry and your options are limited ya do what ya gotta do. 
 
The drive thru line was too long, so I went inside. I figured I'd get the two Cheeseburger deal, since they looked small and easy to eat while driving. The customer service was ok and the food came out pretty quick, almost too quick.  Place seemed clean. I don't really feel it's fair to remove stars based on me not liking fast food. This is definitely as good as I expected it to be, which isn't much.

The first issue that I thought was a little weird. While I was waiting for my food, a father and son came up to order more food. The father asked if she had a side of fruit for his son. She replied no. When she walked away I told him, that it looked like they had apple slices in the kids menu. When she came back he asked her and she said that they did have those. Last I checked apples slices were still fruit, but whatever. He asked how much and she said something like 50 cents or a dollar, then he asked how many came in that serving and she said 2. We both assumed she meant 2 slices... so he ordered like 3-4. When she gave him the 3-4 bags they easily had 4-6 slices in each bag. So I wasn't overly impressed with her knowledge of the menu, and felt that she didn't really seem to be invested in ensuring that she was giving out the correct information. This guy didn't really look like he was on a budget, but still he definitely didn't seem to need all of those apples for one small child.  
My second issue is that I asked for my cheeseburgers without onions, and when I got in the car and opened up the wrapper, both burgers were covered in chopped onions that were basically impossible to easily remove. Boo!!
I'm assuming I won't be back until the next time I'm desperate for a quick food fix.  Why can't Five Guys have a drive thru window... sad face.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,8,5,2,59NTDDPdvOkMmbdFmkSnzQ

I was waited on immediately and placed my order with a friendly and up beat cashier. The only issue that I have with this establishment involves the execution of preparing the food. The time between placing and receiving my order should be under three to five minutes, not having me wait around until summer is over for thus order.

The cashiers was doing a wonderful job at placing and taking orders for the drive thru and the front counter. It is the balance of shifting to prepare fries and nuggets and placing these in bags that he lacks skills at. He realized that the cook making the food had done his part with the sandwiches, but they were out of nuggets when he decided to bag it all.

I have no issues with time tonight except when shear stupidity is shown. After seven minutes the manger decided to inform me that it will be another five until those nuggets are ready. All I ordered was 3 cheeseburgers, a bacon double burger, large fries, and two twenty piece nuggets. I do believe it is not rocket science. 

Finally, the order is in my hands and after checking it all the sandwiches are there but were made incorrectly. The twins will get over this. The dog does not care what comes on her sandwich. The chicken nuggets were undercooked but a go in the microwave will fix that. 

The decor of this restaurant is using a different color scheme of purple and white instead of the traditional red and yellow. The wall paper in the lobby is a pastel violet and white that give it an upscale feeling. There are chandeliers hanging in the dinning area and this is not something one would expect from McDonald's.

I believe from the reviews on Yelp and my own experience should be a wake up call. McDonald's should give more attention to the customer experience than the decor in the lobby. Maybe McDonald's, you could shoot for the stars and deliver both. Your already half way there in redoing the lobby with such precision.

My order a Angus burger combo and a apple pie. The burger was good, only exception there was excess mayo.. The fries were cooked perfectly - crisp and yummy. I've always been a fan of the apple pies at two for .99 or the same for one. Ended up getting only one.

Can't go wrong with McDonald's if you're in a hurry for fast food and they offer healthy options.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,7,6,3,a63m5f3lDUiv4r23327rIg

The employees don't pay attention to anything and everything was wrong- From what I ordered, to what they tried giving me, to what I actually received and the time it took to receive it. The sad part is that I was the ONLY person in drive thru at 6:40am. And they still screwed up from beginning to end. 

Save yourself the time, money, and spare your anger. The people representing this establishment make the whole franchise look bad. DONT COME HERE.",D-L1vI4T83XQmkmICsByxQ,1,0,1,h90nsf_g_1E6pDLDWycmow

It wasn't enough that he doesn't smile and just portrays that he just doesn't want to be there. He gets my order and I pull to my next window and my fries aren't included in the bag with the burgers. She looks at her copy of the order and sees that I ordered a combo then informs me that had to park because the fries would take 2 minutes. It actually took longer than 2 min and the fries were stale and not appeared to be freshly cooked. Just very disappointed all around since our burgers were already filed by the time we got home since we waited on the stale fries.",9SS37PzKIixIZDbfSS5Lkw,0,0,1,PfH0-AlSaoHL3fRMdSudvg

And it sucks because this place and Sonic are the only places open while I'm at work (graveyard). And to top it off my fries are always cold and the workers here are jack asses. F*ck this McDonald's! If I could give a -5 I would instead of 1 star. This is also the only 24 hour McDonald's I know that closes randomly at night.

Well, tonight it was late, so I hit the drive thru. 6 cars ahead, but it's fast food, so I'll maybe wait 20 mins right? Wrong! 44 mins and I finally just asked for a refund,  which I got with an attitude.  My drinks were in the car for 20 mins as it was melted in this heat. Wasted gas and 46 mins total when I finally got my money back. I would've left, but cars had me blocked in. Calling corporate tomorrow and never to return.  These people want more money when they can't get 2 simple meals right? I could've went to a steak house and got it faster!",BTZE_i8YrIssDIk-O7HY2Q,0,0,1,6tYD_9OgXxAm3ihaJKiUng

Sunday morning around 11am
Anyway i ordered 
the food the came out fast enough 
But as i was waiting for my food 
I saw the Mgr. walking with (hair rollers)in her head WHAT!!!!
I just couldn't believe my eyes 
And shes like what ever walking around handling food etc and without a hairnet 
Like if she is at her house 
I took a picture of her

They never have anything ready and whoever thought of not having an intercom needs help. This food chain has seriously lost it. NO INTERCOM? So dumb.

Late night.....drive-thru kinda sucks!  You order at the first window (not through the speaker) but the window...so by the time you get to the second window ( if there aren't any cars in front of you) then you're just waiting for them to make your food.
So you can be sitting there from 10 minutes (minimum) to about 20 minutes.
Not really fast-food if you ask me but sometimes MCD's just fills the craving...especially after drunk and partying on the strip all night long and its time to just head back and unwind.!",Ynu2Z2L8Wv2fbTwQ_8LFqQ,2,1,3,rO7ZVO5BN-qst4_Bj80aFw
5522404,2014-12-06,0,sJ8B4Lq6AY-m5dzIbDNgyQ,"This is a nice McDonald's location, built into the side of a gas station on the southerly side of the Strip right next to the Premium Outlet mall. Some coworkers and I dropped in here several times for a quick bite during lunch, and they were always neat, clean, friendly, and accommodating.
The food wasn't the fastest that I ever received from a McDonald's, but they got our orders right every time and they were tasty to boot, so I'll gladly wait an extra thirty seconds to a minute to ensure I don't have to spend another five minutes explaining and reordering the food when it comes out wrong. Call me crazy, but that's how I see it.
The location was very clean, and as a previous reviewer indicated, they've put flowers on the wee tables that bring some color to the joint. The staff is just as bright and cheery as the decor, and I'd definitely recommend dropping in if you want a good, cheap, relatively quick bite while you're at the Premium Outlets.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,0,0,4,oZiyRslRyP_EL9ud4yUZpw

Today the drive thru girl came to the window chewing like a damn  goat. I guess i interrupted her breakfast. How rude is that? She could have made me wait at the window a extra minute before coming to the window. So rude and then as I pulled off she yelled shut up thru the store because her co workers told her she was wrong for doing it.
