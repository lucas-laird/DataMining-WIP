The only complaint I would have is that you will wait for about 20 minutes to get the food you ordered. If they can learn to expedite their service, I would give this restaurant 5 stars.",jVbgzstT_hy6qEsWLEKUvA,0,0,4,vgbA-KaPVDmWN6szTjUK7Q

There were very few patrons, which was too bad because this place has a lot to offer: decent organic food, a nice view of the lake, live jazz music starting at 7. Unfortunately, with little advertising or visibility, I worry about its future success!

While I generally recommend Captain's Cove, I must warn against ordering the ""World's Healthiest Dessert"" featuring the Xocai chocolate the restaurant hawks. It consists of a medium-sized chocolate cookie, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a square of the chocolate itself. The cookie is gritty and has a horrible flavor, and this dessert will set you back $14 - the same as most of the entrees on the menu! Yikes! Do yourself a favor and order one of the cheesecakes, which are quite nice and reasonably priced.",oNeyHF8MKilKZOUENpTk3Q,2,0,4,m9ueRTsZX7Ww4lkbZRwYCQ

The water view, though artificial, is still nicer than no view at all & it was nice to sit outside.  It was very quiet with 3 tables occupied for a Sunday brunch in October (when we did go) while it was still 75-80 degrees out.",FjIu5bf6dPW7_V_-0Jg4kQ,0,0,3,-4_ydIPL0of3TnUbnQTnQA

Wait staff was young and inexperienced (same owners as the convenient store next door), but I would forgive them because of the lake location and quaint setting. Then the day of ""s**t"" service came. Waited 45 minutes for a sandwich... When inquiring about it, I got a vague answer. It had been 1 hour for my party already (we were the only patrons), so I decided to pay for the salad that actually made it to our table and talked to one of the owner, explaining gently the situation. Reaction: OK. Not a sorry, not an apology...It causes me great concern when an owner actually do not care about the well being of their business. I used to be their number 1 fan.",MKC5kBFwZ3oAX2ZAT-9IVw,1,0,1,_zlSXD8edVqNNIKlWZAxDQ
