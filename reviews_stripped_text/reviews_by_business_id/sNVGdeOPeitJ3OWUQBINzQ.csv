They seem to have a full staff, cashier, busser and servers at least 4 of them, so why is the guy next to me waving for attention because his coffee cup is empty and I noticed it was like that for a good while. At one point, not one employee was in the front of the house. Oh well, again the food was good but they specialize in red velvet so how can it not be.

THE GOOD: the pancakes are amazing! Not only are they cooked flawlessly, but there are some creative toppings. Red velvet, banana fosters, cinnamon bun & s'mores. Hands down best pancakes I've had in years.
THE BAD: service isn't that attentive. There wasn't any sugar on my table and it took almost 10 mins to get the attention of a server. Also we weren't pressed on how we liked our half uneaten entrees. Which leads me to...
THE UGLY: neither anyone I've gone with or myself have ever gotten a savory dish that was good. The Kailua pig Benedict's sounded great, but I was eventually grateful they don't give you much pig. Pretty flavorless. This last time I tried the chili loco moco special. Horrible! Hamburger was dry, egg over cooked and it was served over dry jasmine rice. Why would you ever do loco moco over jasmine rice?

However, we didn't have to wait 45 min to get a table and it was on a Saturday around 10ish. Since I was on this side of town and had a groupon for this place...why not? It only took 10 minutes to get our table. Good thing we came at the perfect time because the people started to arrive and the wait was 30 to 40 min. The place was a little bit larger than the other location. 

It took about 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. I ordered the ranchero omelet since I haven't tried it, with the red velvet pancakes. My daughter ordered the LJ's scramble with the red velvet pancake. Her pancake took an additional 10 minutes to come out after we got our food. The ranchero omelet was pretty good with a kick of hotness due to the green salsa. The red velvet pancakes is still my favorite because it's not too sweet...dessert for breakfast is just the perfect way to end your meal or start it. 

Other flavored pancakes to try is the Rocky Road, S'mores, and White chocolate macadamia, Lemon ricotta, and Strawberry. They are all very yummy and will not disappoint you.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,1,4,xbjj_d_lYPr7KuDNPOEnwg

The Kalua pig eggs Benedict - 3 stars, and although everyone raves about them, I wasn't :(. My muffin was soooooo soggy which made the entire thing just a big wet mess.

169302,2014-06-05,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Food was good for the most part. Customer service needs work. 

I was really excited to try out Babystacks for the first time and it all started out looking good. They had a good selection of pancakes and it was so hard for me to decide which one I wanted, especially since they don't come with any meat. We ended up going with an entree and upgrading our side to a baby stack so that we could try out some flavors. 

The adobo omelette was tasty and a good sized portion. The red velvet pancakes we got as it's side was also really yummy.  They were moist and the cream cheese syrup wasn't overly sweet. All in all we were very pleased. 

Now our second entree was ordered later (since I couldn't decide what I wanted) and ended up coming out just as we finished our first dish. We were severely disappointed this time around. 

The chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes were alright...they didn't taste too bad, but they were pretty dry. The two pancakes instantly soaked up all the syrup we poured on them and texture was dry, sticky, and all wrong. Not enjoyable at all, but at least they didn't taste disgusting. 

Then came the baby chick skillet. The eggs we ordered over easy were cooked perfectly, but the entire dish lacked flavor. The chicken was microscopic because we literally found one piece that was smaller than the potato cubes. And to top it off, I found a piece of hard packaging plastic in my second bite. 

We stopped eating and brought it to our waitress's attention. She took the plate back and somebody else came out to talk to us about it. This lady inquired about where we found the plastic and when we told her, she  said that was weird because everything in the dish is freshly made and not packaged. That's exactly what I thought, but there is no excuse for foreign objects to be found in food and it wasn't cool how accusingly she spoke to us, as if we were the ones who put it there. 

Then they tried to give us a 20% discount on the meal instead of taking the skillet off the tab completely. This was very upsetting considering we only had three bites in all and left the rest of the dish untouched (including that tiny piece of chicken that was only found after thorough inspection). It was only after my boyfriend insisted they take the skillet off that they proceeded to do so. We still tipped our waitress $5, but I left extremely unhappy about how they handled the whole situation.",olnTacPoKxP_uFRS-__4bQ,3,0,2,7oX143I-ro97TEp99m57KA

226896,2014-06-20,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"i'm a bit torn about writing this review, but after reading the recent ones, i feel like i have to chime in, too...

we were visiting vegas from la this week and wanted to eat at some off-the-strip (read: cheap) places. babystacks actually reminded us of cici's cafe and ninong's cafe here at home in that they offer lots of crazy yummy creative pancakes, plus homestyle classic filipino dishes and are small family-owned businesses. unfortunately, the similarities end there.

red velvet pancakes, hazelnut pancakes, and banana cream pie pancakes were all fantastic. we liked how you could get just a short stack of 3 instead of 6 - who can really eat 6 pancakes anyway? the banana cream pie ones, especially - the banana slices in between each pancake plus the banana pudding on top... wow! the chicken adobo fried rice omelette dish was really good, too, and I'd definitely order it again.

now the reason for two stars: the corned beef hash was spoiled. like totally rotten, could smell it before tasting it. whoever cooked it should've been able to tell it was no good. we eat out (for breakfast, especially) all the time and this is the first time we've ever been served spoiled food. EVER. the worst part was that when we told the waitress that the corned beef hash tasted off, she didn't even seem surprised!!! she just asked if we wanted something else. only when she brought the new dish of bacon and eggs did she apologize. it was all quite shocking, actually. or maybe the sugar/carb high had us all foggy and unable to react faster. she did remove the dish from our bill without us having to ask her to - which was cool, but again, she didn't seem too fazed or apologetic about it.

when the hostess (who i'm guessing is the main proprietress?) asked us how everything went as were paying, i didn't have the heart to say anything about the corned beef. i certainly hope the waitress did, though, or at least brought it to the attention of the cook! after she took our plate away, i kept an eye/ear out to see if anyone else ordered it, but no other orders came out. 

so, two stars with reservation because the pancakes were so good, but really should be one star for serving spoiled food. thankfully my senses are in overdrive from the pregnancy hormones so that it only took one tiny bite to know the corned beef was bad, which i promptly spit out anyway. future customers, beware! or just stick to the pancakes!!!",VlsUtqRd3bgg83Z4IsmW-g,2,0,2,3aRLzhv961OOpwVHGgtwww

A little silly, but whatever. I wanted food. 

I was pretty indecisive about trying a new type of pancake, but my friend convinced me to try the banana cream pie pancakes. I had the country fried steak with an upgrade to the banana cream pie pancakes for $1.50 more. My friend had the Portuguese sausage & eggs with garlic rice with an upgrade to (I want to say) rocky road pancakes. (I was distracted by my own food I don't remember. Fail. :/)Both of our entrees were delicious! I loved how crispy my steak was & the gravy was savory. As far as our pancakes.. both tasted exactly as they are described. Definitely some good stuff!

I did the BYO omelette, which is cool cause you can add one of the specialty pancakes for, like, a dollar or two.  I added the lemon ricotta pancakes.  

The omelette was good but I found myself adding a ton of salt and pepper.  The pancakes, however, were awesome!  The cream cheese syrup was SO GOOD.  I literally ate everything off the my plate, scraping off the last bit of the butter, which is rare for me.

There was a long wait for parties more than 2 or 3, but since it was only my wife and I we got seated right away (got lucky, I guess...).

The restaurant is pretty tight, as in it was a little small. We arrived around lunch time so there was a good amount of people when we arrived. We were seated, however, right away which definitely deserves an A+. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive the entire time. Food came out pretty quick so A+ for that as well.
On to the food... first the red velvet pancakes.. was I expecting red velvety battered goodness? Yes. Did I get it? No. They were pretty much pancakes with red food coloring topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with mini chocolate chips. Nothing mind blowing. The cream cheese syrup tasted like the icing you would find in a store bought cinnaroll can. Once again, nothing special. For me, total fail to the excitement I had before I actually tasted them.
Now on to the saviour of this review... the adobo omellett. It was a hefty size. I was expecting more egg than filling but thankfully I was wrong. It was chockful of yummyness! The rice tossed with the adobo sauce and shredded chicken were delightful for my taste buds. The creamy side Mac salad was a great addition to the dish.

I ordered the eggs and sausage that came with pancakes and seasoned potatoes or other items.  I paid $1.50 upcharge for the specialty pancakes.  What's the point of going to Babystacks to get regular pancakes.  I ordered the s'mores which were really good.

It was around 10am and the wait was about 15 min.  But hey, it was a Sunday and anywhere breakfast spot it going to be busy.  

I ordered the macadamia nut white chocolate pancakes and a side of bacon.  The pancakes come in a reg stack which is 6 or a short stack which is 3.  The three is plenty for me and I usually can only eat two. The pancakes are full of macadamia nuts and sprinkled with mini white choco chips.The side of bacon is three nice, crispy, thick pieces that aren't greasy.  Just thinking about this is making for hungry.

My bf ordered the red Velvet pancakes the first time we went and they were pretty good.  He loved them, but I'm not the biggest fan of red velvet.  This time around he ordered the corn beef hash, which hash browns, and he upgraded his pancakes to the Almond Joy ones.  Man those pancakes were so yummy.

862935,2012-08-19,2,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Okay, right off the bat I need to state that I am a Goin-Out-TO-Breakfast fiend. It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.

I learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.

Their hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.

And that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?). 

So I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, ""Really?""?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning ""Really?"" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an ""epic fail"". 

I'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.

BS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends, ""Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns.""

Long after the trendy red velvet thing has passed, people will still love going out to breakfast.",_8qu8GfnQCv0yae2i-OU5A,0,0,2,GWCc2W_3zVQPqXNsLkupDg

The skillet was the perfect blend of savory flavors, the red velvet pancakes followed like dessert and the banana cream pie pancakes weren't overly sweet - thankfully, I was nervous.

So, here we are; first in the door and i have my coffee, so far so good. The sweet sounds or reggae make us smile and relax. The places has quickly filled up as i patiently waited my PB & J pancakes and portugués sausage.

Hubby ordered the sliders, but wasn't impressed with the lack of meat (spam) in the dish.

1109270,2015-06-19,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I friggin' love this place.  Yes, that is correct, love the place.

BabyStacks is the number one place for breakfast when visiting Vegas.  It is the place I take friends and travel companions when in town and to a person they are pleased with the meal. That is because the staff members are all pleasant, the food is tasty and prepared quickly.  While everything is good, I recommend ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes (there are enough to share with the ""friend"" you met last night, or flew into town with). The coffee is always hot, fresh, smooth, and your cup will never be empty.

Don't be put off by the simple exterior and location.  This place has the feel of a family run restaurant (and probably is) and they make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Oh, and did mention I love this place because the food is oh so good.

So, if you are a Vegas local, give it a try.  If you are a visitor to Sin City, make a tiny extra effort, travel west on Flamingo and turn south on Buffalo.  It is on the corner just south of a drug store in a strip mall.  Pull in, walk in, enjoy. There are two locations in Vegas, but the one on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo is the location I am familiar with.",U2cNYvPy5EHkBsp-GIsXaQ,0,0,4,udkZZbBwEJWw-reA2G0M6w

When i go to breakfast places, I try to steer clear of ordering stuff i can make at home...spam and eggs, Portuguese sausage and eggs, etc etc.  I always try to go for stuff that I can't make or would take too much effort to make.  Pancakes are not hard to make but the creativity that baby stacks has come up with forced me to order them, lol!

We had the velvet pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes and the corned beef hash.  

red velvet pancakes: they were good, not spectacular like most people here say, but definitely good.  They came with a cream cheese sauce and I noticed most people were pouring the entire thing on their pancakes, lol.  Yeah, they were good but all of it was too sweet for me. 

The banana cream pie pancakes were really good.  banana slices, a banana type sauce, almonds and a whipped cream that tasted like it was infused with banana.  If they only added some chocolate too! mmmm.........

The corned beef hash said that it was homemade on the menu but it looked like and tasted like the canned stuff.  I think the best corned beef hash still belongs to Black Bear Diner...

Overall a great experience and we will be back.  We're looking forward to trying the kalua pig benedict, chicken adobo omelet, etc.  

p.s. for any Hawaii Peeps out there, their banana cream pie pancakes tasted exactly like the banana mac pancakes from BOOTS N KIMOS in Kailua!  I think the chef here used to work there or something, lol!",XYy7o-sRCJ9_XqzACDk7iw,0,0,4,KkU-Q10pw1qk2LQG7tKyGQ

Tom Petty says it best, when he sings the chorus to his song ""The Waiting."" This also sums up the experience you'll have at BabyStacks.  

There is no doubt that BabyStacks has the biggest selection of creative pancakes in town.  The panacea of pancakes changes often, but expect to find staples like Red Velvet, Lemon-Ricotta, and S'mores on the menu when you dine.  Besides lots of pancakes, BabyStacks also stays true to it's Hawaiian roots with breakfast grinds like Loco Moco, Spam fried rice, and Kahlua Pork omelets.  


The place is very small, and can feel cramped, especially during a busy weekend rush.  If you don't have the sweet tooth of a five year old, you may want to pass on the pancakes, and go for something savory.  On my last visit, I kept it simple, and went with some scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, and toast.  Everything was good, not great, and for the 30 minutes we waited  to get our food, after waiting about 20 to sit down, and another 10 for our coffee, it just wasn't worth it. 


Breakfast doesn't need to be a whole production, and the food isn't good enough to warrant the wait and the potential cramped seating.  

BabyStacks is worth trying, but not frequenting.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,1,1,3,AjIOW_J--p6zg92a2n31rw

It didn't taste much better. Plus, the whole breakfast was cold. Well, luke warm, I guess, but not as hot as it should have been (cold eggs are gross).  The pancakes looked promising.  I went with the Cinnamon Bun (it was a compromise because I was sharing). But they were dry, and not hot either. And waay too sweet for my taste. I should have gone with my instinct and tried the bacon or carrot cake.  I was not disappointed to the point of not going back.

Wasn't hard to find, but just pretty off the strip. Can't miss the signage outside tho. Totally feeling their logo.

For a Friday, there was a lunch rush especially since it closes early. Wait wasn't too bad, took about 10mins which gave us time to check out their menu.

Everyone's been raving about their red velvet pancakes so we got that. Not bad, wasn't as red as I was expecting, a bit dry but the cream cheese frosting/syrup saved it. Someone in our party got the chocolate chip pancakes but they were underwhelming --nothing special. 

For my main meal, I got their version of the loco moco. Maybe it was my fault for getting it with egg whites but something just wasn't right about it. I did like the fact that I had the option of getting it with garlic fried rice tho. Probably won't get it again.

Take note ! They only seat after ENTIRE party is there. And they get pretty busy during breakfast or lunch time (only open for breakfast and lunch, for obvious reasons)

Been here a few times. Various friends and family. So got to try different things. 

Like a normal breakfast place, they offer a variety Omelettes, pancakes, etc. They have a slight Hawaiian influence so you'll see things like kalua pork, or bbq pork, or Portuguese sausage on the menu.But the most talked about, and hyped, is their Red Velvet Pancakes. For those who dont know, red velvet is more known for the cake. Bright to dark red cake flavored with cocoa with a cream cheese icing, So essentially, simply a chocolate cake, without the overload of chocolate. 

My first time here, was with one other friend. We had tried the red velvet, as well as the banana cream pancake. Prior to this, i had been very sick of pancakes because one year, my friends and I decided to go around to different iHops on international pancake day, and eat free pancakes.... that killed it for me for a few years. So traditional normal pancakes, definitely a no go for me ! I was eager to try these new pancakes with different flavors though. 

At BabyStacks, they offer their pancakes in full stacks or half stacks, and their pancakes are smaller than the normal ones you see.  Maybe like 4-5"" in diameter vs the plate sized ones. 

Red Velvet Pancakes - As said before, its red, but essentially a lighter chocolate pancake with cream cheese icing and whipped cream. Its pretty good. Not what it was hyped up to be (maybe im not much of a dessert person anyway) but its not bad. I still do recommend people who hasn't tried it, to try it. Light chocolatey flavor with a not too heavy cream cheese icing. 

Banana Cream Pie Pancake - Traditional pancake with what you'd find in a banana cream pie so sliced bananas, a banana cream, and whipped cream. The first time i tried it, it was surprisingly amazing, Originally being a lover of banana cream pie (to the extent of not being a dessert lover... if that makes sense), this had sparked my interest in pancakes again.

Also, they do not split checks. Time to bust out that calculator and do some arithmetic. If you have that cheap friend who never chips in for taxes or tip, you may need to throw in a few extra bucks. 

Menu is full of pancakes on one side. The other side offers their specialties. The first two items listed are the adobo fried rice and loco moco. There was no way I was going to leave that place without ordering both. Each item comes with a choice of potatoes, hash browns, etc. Went with the hash browns. Small order of pancakes comes with the loco moco or you can upgrade to the specialty pancakes for about $2. My bro had the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes and said they were some of the best he has ever had. 

The adobo fried rice was excellent. It was interesting to have it wrapped up in egg. I felt like there wasn't a lot of the fried rice inside of the egg. I should have asked for the loco moco with the adobo fried rice. I asked after the meal but they do not serve it that way. The gravy for the loco moco was rich with flavor. The rice was a bit soggy. The hamburger patty was thick and I think they used two eggs. 

Overall, food was great. I could have used more of the fried rice and the white rice was a bit soggy but the excellent flavor cancelled out the downfalls. The service was great and to top it off was the price. It was $29 for 2 with drinks and all that food. Give them a try, stuff your face, and then head back to your hotel pool and strut your six-pack. Happy eating!",5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,23,24,4,UWNCbIn-Mf5g0dsiFOg0Tw

It's sad when the two are combined. 

I get the place is your relaxing breakfast dine, but to have your guest sitting for 7 to 10 minutes after being sat and then only taking our drink orders and then bringing it to us five minutes later and then having us flag down our server is irrelevant. 

This isn't my first time experiencing this here, but being that I work in the food and beverage industry I always try to give chances because I understand the inside and out... However, that isnt something I should have to get use to. It's annoying especially when you are hungry... the management needs to teach them that.

We were brought in and seated and the man hosting who sat us at a table kept asking where the rest of our party was, we insisted they would be arriving shortly. But he kept nagging us about them and spoke to is VERY rudely and with bad attitude and a facial expression to match said to us ""You better not get me in trouble"" and he walked away.

Our sever (I wish I heard her name) was super sweet. She was so nice with such a pleasant attitude and very accommodating.  

The food was yummy, good enough to redeem the poor behavior we had endured from the douche of a host, but still I wish we didn't have to encounter that man before trying to enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast with my family and our blessing babies and toddlers. 

I ordered the honey French toast but it didn't come with anything g other than the two slices of toast so I had to order a side of breakfast potatoes. The French toast was great, I appreciate non-soggy toast since I'm extremely picky of food textures. I also decided I wanted to try the sweet cream crepe and it wasn't anything special, still tasty, but maybe if I had order extra topping for an extra charge I might had been more impressed.

The last time I went, I got the almond joy pancakes. They were chocolate pancakes with almond shavings, coconut, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. I thought it was reeeeeally good because the chocolate pancakes weren't TOO chocolately as you would expect, I think it was the perfect amount of chocolately goodness. 

Everyone thinks the red velvet pancakes are amazing.. I beg to differ. They are just ""bleh"" to me, nothing special. I think the hype sells them. 

My usual is the honey whole wheat pancakes. These pancakes have a different texture from the regular pancakes which I really enjoy and they're supposed to be more healthy.. hence the whole wheat --so it's the one I typically order.

I came here after one such night in Vegas last month, and a delicious fusion brunch was exactly what I needed.  The wait for our party of five wasn't too long, only about 20 minutes or so (compared to our epic wait the night before at Bachannal, this was easy peasy).

Since there were a few of us, I was lucky to try some other things too.  The loco moco was amazing, hands-down the best dish we had at the table.  The sauce was on point and the beef was so good, especially for the hungover.  The Kalua pig benedict was good, although not super impressive.  While everyone at the table raved about the white chocolate macadamia nut and red velvet pancakes, I personally thought they were both a bit dry.  Of course, you can dunk the red velvet in the cream cheese dressing on the side, but that's just a bit too sweet for me.  Maybe it's because I'm not really a sweet tooth, but I'd come back for the loco moco.

Service:  Pleasant and friendly.  Ma-and-pa local run kind of place.

Why do I have to be Filipino? Why couldn't the numerous restaurants and huge variety of food on the Vegas strip satisfy my tummy?

But I hesitated, afraid I'd be disappointed by the lack of quality in the dishes and I did not want to take such a risk. I searched further as my tummy growled and mumbled ""rice, rice, rice"". Then I hear my toddler say, ""Mommy, I want wice!""

Then I see it. BabyStacks Cafe. I browsed through their menu of delicious goodness. Kahlua Pork, whaaaat? Red Velvet Pancakes, whaaaat? Garlic Rice, whaaaat? Can you just imagine a big plate of those three dishes and a cup of joe? I was so excited, my mouth watered. I said, ""Screw you, food at the Strip! I'm takin' my tummy elsewhere!"" 

This cozy, little restaurant was very welcoming and we were seated immediately. Of course it was only 8:30am in the morning but there were already many people there. We ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which was wrapped in eggs, like an omelette. The hubby loved it. There were so many dishes to choose from...

Usually when I order this item at other restaurants, it was ehhh but I was really pleased here. As for the garlic rice, it was a little bland for my taste but still delicious.

For main course I had the Cowboy Omelette with cinnabun pancakes. I also tried the carrot, red velvet, and wheat pancakes. Ranked from most to least favorite: Cinnabun, Carrot, Red Velvet, then Wheat.

The cinnabun pancakes was flavorful and not overly sweet. I would highly recommend this pancake. The carrot pancake was good but couldn't taste the carrot flavor. It was very mild and it basically looked like the wheat pancake but a little sweeter. The red velvet was fairly dry and the melted sugar overpowered the red velvet. 

The cowboy omelette was okay. The eggs were overcooked but there were lots of ingredients in it. I would have preferred the eggs to be a little more watery and the vegetables a little less overcooked. The fried potatoes were okay. It was not overly salty and not burnt at all.

Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars. This place is good for breakfast and I would come back here again. Portion size was excellent. They do give a lot for breakfast. Unfortunately, it just missed the mark on certain things. Service was excellent. Pancakes here are excellent. Next time I'll try their french toast and another egg dish to test.",HEncape8aii836Zf6pO9Iw,1,0,4,QKp3eMqBn9gTMHcp8FeoZQ

My dining companion had the lemon ricotta crepes, and the lemon sauce was really, really good.

He was very skeptical on the red velvet pancakes,but when both me and the child raved about the ones we tried at the partner place, baby cakes, he ordered them. we both did, and as usual, phenomenal.
Also, we both never eat just sweet things for brrfst, so he ordered country fried steak and eggs w/ hash browns and coffee, I ordered bacon/eggs/hash browns with coffee. I usually won't order something like country fried steak unless a place is known for it, but after I tastes his, i was sad i didn't order that. Mine was good, but his was awesome.
So round two (we've been twice in 2 wks-bought groupon NOW deals both times)-this time i got the special-orange creamsicle pancakes with corn beef hash (another thing I typically won't order unless they're known for it)...hubby got an omelet with red velvets again :)
My pancakes=TDF. they tasted like those pillsbury rolls in a can you twist to pop open then cook in the over...comes with a orangey frosting? these taste like those!!!! 
My corn beef hash,sadly was eh. whatever i just won't order it next time!

Btw-this place has a bit of an island theme to it-they serve kahlua pork, side of steamed rice as substitute for toast, potatoes, etc, and various other islandy things.

The place was small and packed full of people which was a great sign! We were seated at the bar and impressed by the variety of pancakes. They sounded more like different pies or cheesecakes.

One dish caught my eye: homemade corned beef hash + eggs + rice + pancakes! Ii wasn't a fan of their homemade version because it didn't have enough potatoes and wasn't cooked enough, so it felt like dog food. I think I would have preferred the canned corned beef hash.

My sister got the Spam version. We had to. YOLO.

The rice was a nice touch to breakfast. Reminded me of being at home. I wasn't too impressed by the pancakes, my sister got carrot cake and cinnabun pancakes. They were a tad too sweet for my taste and also I prefer a fluffier pancake.

Banana creme pancakes looked incredible as they were served to us.  Bananas, whipped creme, drizzle of some kind of brown stuff on top..yummy!   But taking one bite, I was confused.  The toppings and the pancake didn't work together and the pancake definitely lacked a punch.  I've had great banana pancakes (Bruddah's in Gardena, CA) but these were kind of disappointing.

Blueberry pancakes - same batter as the other pancakes with some blueberries pushed inside and topped with fresh blueberries as well.  Kid will devour anything with blueberries so she like them but once again, the pancake doesn't deliver.  (Stacks in Dana Point, CA - now thats a blueberry pancake!)

Chili skillet - this was very tasty but I wish it had more chili.  One more scoop of that delicious chili would have made me much happier.  I wish the potatoes were swimming in that stuff!  Combine that with a sunny side egg... ono.

Cornbeef hash - this was ok.  Just a plain ground cornbeef hash patty with rice and eggs.  Not too spicy but could have been burned just a little bit longer on the skillet.

Service was good and seating was faster than quoted.  Also noticed the tables were promptly cleaned after someone leaves.  Kind of far but its a decent alternative to an expensive weekend brunch on the strip.",2AmyrQ0f7ErlXYdkXKLGPg,1,0,3,tvrgMUcEcP3GuF9KuS6k-w

This review is years overdue. I'm not even a big fan of pancakes. However, I am a huge fan of creativity, and I definitely appreciate how they've married many desserts with classic pancakes.

Red Velvet Pancakes // WHAT?! Okay. I do have to admit that I have tried other better similar concoctions (i.e. red velvet waffles at Larchmont in LA and red velvet pancakes at the Grand Lux in the Venetian), but I was first introduced to these here at BabyStacks... so I have fond memories of this item!

Cookies n Cream Pancakes // I tried these babies for the first time today.  So good! I'm an Oreo lover, so I'm surprised I haven't tried these. I would definitely go for these rather than the Red Velvet from now on. I haven't seen these anywhere else before!

Biscuit & Gravy, Loco Moco, and Kalua Pork Benedict are some of the other items I've tried. Honestly, I wouldn't order any of those items again.

The pancake selection is awesome, but the pancakes themselves could use a little more fluffy... Still, a must-visit when in Vegas!",Zx2mGCP_8Jkj0KYDbr5G0w,6,3,5,5MfZ5WlBiQ-adMm4gC_IiA

I've eaten at this location recently a few times and I've left feeling happy and full. I really enjoy cafes that only serve breakfast and/or brunch like this one, because they do it right! 

If you've ever been to Hawaii and miss those nostalgic eats, like spam, Portuguese sausage, eggs, & rice, Kalua pig Benedict, or some fluffy white-chocolate macadamia nut pancakes, you've found your place that serves all that and more. I haven't tried some of their more creative creations, like their Spam Scramble. Spam, eggs, rice, furikake, with homemade macaroni salad?! Or the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice or classic Loco Moco? It all sounds ono, doesn't it? They also offer omelettes, skillets, burgers, and even Zippy's Chili! If that wasn't enough, their pancakes or babystacks as they call them, are delicious! Classic toppings like blueberry and buttermilk, but their unique flavors like Orange Dreamsicle, rocky road, PB&J, S'mores, Carrot Cake, Banana Cream, even Bacon pancakes are sure to catch your eye. They are most known for their Red Velvet, however the rest of the selections sound just as delicious, I think. Recently, we tried the Cinnabun and Hazelnut w/ Nutella. Light, fluffy, and delicious, as pancakes should be! Their garlic rice, which are sautéed with onions are amazing, which many people substitute for the plain steamed white rice. 

Another thing I love is the way BabyStacks lets you substitute anything, some for a small up charge. Garlic rice? Egg whites only? Lemon Ricotta pancakes instead of regular buttermilk? I appreciate restaurants like this that'll make your breakfast the way you want it! And the prices are very reasonable. Their highest priced item I saw was $11.95, and that's for a full breakfast entree, which you get a big portion of meat accompanied with rice or potatoes AND pancakes or toast. 


I've had great service on each of my visits. Waters filled, food delivery fast, and servers are friendly and helpful. 

Honestly, the only thing that makes this place less than 5 stars is probably the wait to be seated. I've been lucky not to have waited very long, but my servers told me there's certain weekdays that can go an hour wait for a table. See...the food must be good!

The menu is incredible, with many very interesting crepes, pancakes, burritos, omelets, and even sandwiches.

It had cinnamon, cake crust crumbles, and Nutella drizzle all in one breakfast dish. YUM! If I had eaten the whole thing by myself, I would have gone into sugar shock. But it would have been worth it. Best French toast ever! By comparison, the pancakes were a disappointment. Yes, it had Nutella on top. It also had a huge mound of whipped cream. Even with the Nutella and the whipped cream, the pancakes were somewhat disappointing. Maybe if we didn't have the French toast to compare it to, it would have seemed better.

Chocolate pancakes with a slight coffee taste, chocolate syrup, almonds and whipped cream. It was so good!  My daughter got the Nutella crepes and they weren't great. Messy to eat and the Nutella was so thick it was just too much. My hubby got the chili loco moco. I was hesitant about that. But the chili is very tasty. I would order that next time.

It was late Friday morning and the place was doing brisk business. We waited for about 10-15 minutes (party of six) and were seated with our drinks taken care of somewhat promptly. All was well...then we placed our orders...that's when my frustration with this place grew. I base my reviews on the quality of the food first, then the service, then ambiance. With regards to service, I want to see that my glass of water is refilled before being emptied and not having to summon a waiter to refill the glass...and for a breakfast place to ensure my cup of coffee is promptly refilled. Well, the coffee wasn't refilled before I could see the bottom of the cup. On top of that, the waitress got our orders messed up once the food finally arrived after a 35 minute wait! 35 minutes! Waiting for our food for 35 minutes from the time we ordered! Unacceptable. The only redeeming quality was that the food was actually pretty good. Everyone on our table liked what they had and were willing to overlook the long wait...I wasn't. If it wasn't for the decent food, I would have given this place 2 stars or 1 star.

Between the two visits:

Highlights were the red velvet pancakes (yum all around), adobo fried rice omelette and corned beef hash w/ garlic rice

Be warned, the garlic rice isn't just a hint of garlic, it's full force garlic, which was fine by me. 

Lemon ricotta pancakes had great flavor, but the texture was soggy, which is why I probably wouldn't order it again.

I literally miss this dish and dream of it constantly.. at any location it is cooked to perfection.. I am referring to ( you guessed it!) the Country Fried Steak. Since eating this dish at BabyStacks, I haven't touched it at any other restaurant because it just will not compare. 

The pancakes are phenomenal and fun as well because of all the different flavors. Makes it feel like you're at an ice cream shop for pancakes. Or a cake shop...........

Now for the nitty gritty: it is absolutely crowded on the weekends. You will wait up to an hour sometimes to be seated and it is well worth the wait! Customer service is great. Food comes out quickly. Don't be daunted by the crowd - take it as a good indication.

Pulling in I saw a long line, I was thinking about leaving since I was on a tight schedule so I walked in an asked how long the wait time was, for two people it was only 20 minutes so I decided to stick around, for others with larger groups, the wait time was an hour, eek. In the end I only ended up waiting 10 minutes. 

I felt a little bit claustrophobic walking in, it was really packed and all of the tables were very close together. You could lean over and eat off of your neighbors plate! 

Our waitress came out quick and took our order. For my drink  I decided to go with coffee, blah! It was gross. The coffee tasted watered down like they prepared it, dumped half of it out and refilled it with water, I could get a better tasting cup at McDonald's. For my breakfast entree I went with Cora's corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and substituted the buttermilk pancakes, instead I got the red velvet pancakes.

Food came out quick as well, the corned beef hash was seasoned well, tasted great, but my eggs came out over easy instead of over medium. The red velvet pancakes were mighty tasty, very fluffy and a little crisp on the outside. They were topped off with whipped cream, which went well with the cream cheese syrup. After our food came out the waitress disappeared, we were to never see her again. We were never asked how the food was or if we wanted any refills. We are very generous tippers when we get great service, on this occasion I was thinking of not even leaving a tip but I'm not that rude, she got $3 for her disappearing act! 

Honestly, if it weren't for the food, I would have rated this place two stars, but since the food was great (minus the eggs), they get four from me.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,6,5,4,b9avovKrnSxiM7DHV3pKqw

My boyfriend's cousin spoke very highly of this place, so we had to give this place a try, especially since he told us that some of the dishes are Filipino inspired.

Since there were a lot of us, we all tried to order something different so we could try each other's food if we wanted. The food here is AMAZING!!! The red velvet pancakes are a piece of heaven on a plate and the Portuguese sausages are delightful as well. They also have delicious garlic fried rice, which is basically a comfort food if you are Filipino. It honestly gave me my rice fix since I was having withdrawals on this trip. For bacon lovers, like my boyfriend, there are bacon pancakes that are mouthwatering. My sister's fiancée had Rick's Adobo Rice dish, which was very delicious and was large enough for two people. All of the dishes are reasonably priced and they do give you good portion sizes here.

The service that we had was on point as well. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and refilled our drinks when she saw that we were running low. A+ in my book

Overall, this place will not disappoint! There are a wide variety of pancake combinations and the other items on the menu are also a wonderful treat. I'm looking forward to dining at this place again in the near future.",g8HZLiCSgWVkIMvcMHtRjA,1,0,5,3qpunAbWepqJ7iSr5kH_tQ

It was about 10 minutes away from The Strip and BabyStacks is a small casual cafe in a local plaza. There were so many choices to choose from, but I had to try their famed Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm usually not a huge fan of Red Velvet since I've had enough as a dessert and I find it usually a bit too sweet with their cream cheese frosting. I was a bit afraid that it would be too sweet for pancakes, but I was wrong. BabyStacks Cafe was the first and perhaps the best red velvet pancakes I have ever had. The pancakes was not too sweet and its syrup was just right that didn't left me feeling like I already indulged a load of sugar for the morning. I got the short stack which was enough for me for 3 pancakes. It's affordable with entrees costing less than $10! BabyStacks Cafe is a casual cafe that seems to be known within the locals, so it didn't felt like it was all touristy. Their service was great and the waitress welcomed me as a newcomer which I thought it was a pleasant experience at BabyStacks.

So we chose this place. It was also my mom's birthday... I love everything red velvet and had to have the pancakes, however the Cinnabon ones were also ones we wanted to try. So we got short stacks of both. In addition we split the Spinach and Bacon Eggs Benedict. The Benedict came with a choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. I am pretty sure that most of the food is typical Sysco food, I'm not even sure the hollandaise is freshly made. With that said however, the Benedict was delicious. I ate one potato and pushed them aside, should have ordered the hash browns. We did have a ton of food though so it wasn't like I was starving for more food. 
Now to the pancakes. I made the mistake of not telling our server to put everything on the side as they put so much whipped cream(fresh homemade) and powdered sugar and some chocolate dust. I removed all the toppings and went for the bottom one. I liked the pancake, it was cooked perfectly, super fluffy and warm. I was not so thrilled with the ""icing"" it needed more of a cream cheese flavor because it settled at the bottom. I liked it but I didn't love it. I had a bite of the Cinnabon pancake, although too sweet for me I liked it better. It didn't need any syrup because it had the icing already on it and the pecans made it crunchy and perfect. Again it was a perfectly cooked pancake. 
My mom would give this place 4... And a 5 just for the pancakes. I can't. Looking around at the egg dishes, they looked so generic and again, like Sysco food products.

2100083,2018-05-06,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Baby Stacks is a breakfast spot, with a generous selection of ""yummy"" pancakes and a strong Hawaiian influence. Their portion sizes are smaller than other restaurants, but their prices are higher. I've eaten here a few times, but never been blown away with the food or service. 

They appeal to the Hawaiian/Filipino market specifically, with staples like garlic rice and Portuguese sausage. FYI, if you plan on interacting with ANYONE after eating here - do not order the garlic rice. You could murder a vampire with your breath.

The ""star"" of this joint are the pancakes, which come in short stacks. They have a myriad of flavors and toppings, most of which carry an artificial candy-like flavor. Do not expect leftovers, as stated before the portion sizes are significantly smaller than what you would expect from the price. 

I'm not an advocate of huge portions, quite the opposite. But i am a cost sensitive consumer, who can see value in quality or quantity. Neither of these metrics are met to justify menu pricing here.

Baby Stacks is a classic example of current Las Vegas local cuisine, shameless appeal to a niche market and no single item is exceptional.",Z23C2KX_7gEeYy3030PDUA,0,0,3,rrVLfEgWY_qgY9hAH1ewaA

From the outside, this place doesn't look like much. In fact, I was never curious about what this place was until my bestie invited me here for breakfast.

The service was also great and friendly! 

If you're looking for a great breakfast/brunch I suggest opting out for the skillets! They have so many combinations and possibilities for them.

I know that everyone talks about their Red Velvet pancakes, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolatey goodness first thing in the morning (ironic I know). Instead, I am in love with their CARROT PANCAKES!

I had a strawberry lemonade and ordered the spam and egg meal with an upgrade to their garlic fried rice - which is a must.  To top everything off and to ensure I was full of carbs, I chose the simple pancakes with maple syrup.

My wife and a more colorful choice which included avocado and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes. They tasted as good as they looked.

Anyways, the wait is usually anywhere between 10 to 30 mins, which really isn't that bad. The wait gets us quite excited because just thinking of what we will order from the many different items on their menu can take a while to decide. But overall, whatever you choose.. This place will definitely fill you up! The servers are quite attentive, sometimes there's a rush so once in a while you need to get their attention, but other than that, you'll feel satisfied after taking those first couple of bites of food.

My friends and I always order something savory and upgrade to one of their specialty short stacks, which is definitely plentiful.

Lastly, we love the island fusion and music! Having lived in Maui for a few years, and having a step-father raised on the island of Oahu, it definitely brings me back to a sunny day at the beach.",3lQJQc_OBIu2hNDA3rqULg,1,0,5,ni-xrBzkeBaYMQKUUJFGhg

Was sat down and ordered the scrambled eggs with diced spam and furikake on rice. I know, so Hawaiian of me. My friend ordered biscuit something and something egg. I didn't care, I was just eggs-cited for my egg. Haha, pun intended. 

Got my food and took a bite of of the scrambled egg and spam. Eh, it's alright. The egg was still runny as if it wasn't cooked enough OR not scrambled enough. The spam was still pink as if it just came out of the can. Oh yeah, especially the rice. I'm Asian and I know what rice is supposed to taste like. It was really undercook, kinda hard and very dry. It wasn't great, it was just undercooked.

i think the last time was when it was still babycakes and they only had the one location.
now they have 3 locations which is a good sign.
i'm happy for their success and i'm also happy to report that they are just as good, if not better, than they ever were.

i had the breakfast burrito with no meat and it came with a side order of 2 buttermilk pancakes.
the burrito was good but nothing extraordinary.
the pancakes were a lot better than i remember.
they were fluffy, buttery and perfectly cooked.
the hubby had the loco moco which looked delicious.
his over medium egg was cooked to perfection, slightly runny in the middle and the garlic fried rice was tasty and very garlicky.
their mac salad is quite tasty as well.

i remember in the past thinking that their food was pedestrian with nothing too spectacular but i believe they've made some improvements and it definitely shows.
they appear to have put much more thought into their menu.

2318830,2012-07-16,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Listen to your YELP friends, people. This place is good for one thing and one thing only: PANCAKES. 

My girlfriend and I got here after waking up late on Sunday morning with an epic sweet tooth. She was craving chocolate cake so I figured this would be a great spot. 

It was semi crowded by the time we got there. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, but we were given the option of sitting at the dining counter within 5 minutes. We aren't picky, so we took it! (One star here for under-promising and over-achieving. BabyStacks does a good job of over estimating wait times and then having you seated before your estimated wait time expires. This is great, in my opinion. Nothing bugs me more than being told 15 minutes and waiting 40.) 

Ashley ordered the red velvet pancakes. She knew what she was getting before we even got there. I ordered the eggs and bacon with white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes ($1 upcharge for their specialty pancakes - well worth it). 

Let me say this: the rest of their breakfast foods aren't all that great. The bacon actually didn't taste very good and the eggs were nothing special. The only reason I ordered them was because I figured I should get some protein in me. However, in all honesty, if you're coming here, you should be coming for pancakes and not expect much else. The home fries or breakfast potatoes were also pretty bland, as if they came from a frozen bag. 

However, I'm still going to give 5 stars because I have never tasted better pancakes in my life. Ashley's red velvet pancakes came with cream cheese type syrup. They were UNBELIEVABLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS. My white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were also good - not as good as hers - but still very soft, delicious, and with white chocolate morsels that were half melted into the pancakes. MMMM. 

So, seriously guys, when a restaurant names themselves after PANCAKES and specialize in PANCAKES, don't order something other than PANCAKES.

2348824,2014-06-27,1,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"BabyStacks is one of my fave breakfast joints. 

It's right up the street from our house so it could be super convenient. I'll touch on that later.

The main thing I love is the creative selection of their pancakes and that they have specials of them occasionally too! The Red Velvet made them famous and for good reason but I urge you to stray away and try some of the other yummy pancakes! The second thing I love is that you can get a full breakfast platter for under $10. The works, a little bit of everything. Eggs, potatoes, toast, SPAM :) and pancakes. An up charge for a special flavor but it's not much. I like when I don't have to choice my favorite breakfast components or spend a fortune on getting all the additional sides. 

They opened a location on South Buffalo because this location became so popular and it is super small. Which comes to my gripe with BabyStacks, not because there is a wait but because every time I go or call ahead to check the wait time, it is ALWAYS off sometimes in my favor, sometimes not but it drives me crazy. You may be busy but you are also turning people away. Get your table times in check. It's breakfast your table time should be about an hour, hour and half for a chatty table. You should be able to quote tables based on that time frame. I'll still visit but it is definitely not as often as I would like it to be because of this. 

Maybe another location on the East or Southeast side will spread the love out.",EPa3uxyyGfRMpPX47lKwvQ,2,1,4,1AMa2R7JuuCvgfHgzVn1rg

I remember my friend taking me there and he told me to get the Red Velvet pancakes because they were to die for! Of course, I ordered it to see what it's all about and I am so glad I did! It has to be one of my favorite things to eat and one of my guilty pleasures! Ever since then, I always opted to go back, but because it was too far from where I lived, going there was usually only on very special occasions such as friends or relatives from out of town and they want a ""local fav"" breakfast joint. 

After BabyStacks being so successful, they finally opened a new location right across from my old high school! I frequent now at the Buffalo/Flamingo location because its so close and convenient. Come early when they open because lines will get long! 

My typical orders:

Red Velvet pancakes
Peanut butter & banana pancakes
Rocky road pancakes

These are my top three favorites. They are so good and more dessert like. I usually order my pancakes last because I need something fulfilling to eat at breakfast rather than sweets.

Build your own omelets- I'm a sucker for omelets. I love the option of building my own only for less than $10!

BabyStacks is a Hawaiian/Asian style breakfast joint so a lot of the dishes have rice, spam and macaroni. It tastes a lot like home to me. The portions are huge and very fulfilling!

  The people have spoken.  And they said they want red velvet pancakes from Baby Stacks Cafe.  So who am I to argue?  For my first trip to this highly recommended breakfast stop, I got the velvet short-stack along with a side of scrambled eggs and a glass of milk.  Very basic.

FOOD:  The short-stack was 3 smaller thick pancakes, which was just right for me to feel full but not disgusted with myself.  I've never had red velvet pancakes, but why haven't I heard of this sooner?!  It's one of the most delicious things on earth.  The perfect sweetness, texture, toppings - man, I just can't do these things justice.  Trust me when I say they are straight from heaven.  

SERVICE: The only thing sweeter than my short-stack was my server.  ""Yvette"" I believe was her name, a young Hawaiian-looking girl with the happiest attitude without a hint of fakeness.  She was smiley, quick to greet and take my order, always asking if there was anything else she could do, checking up on me just right.  And my food came out ridiculously quick.  I was pleasantly impressed!

DECOR:  The restaurant is fairly small, but cozy, clean, refreshing, and new in appearance.  You can tell someone took pride in it.  The small bar style seating area was neat.  There was a TV.  Soothing, light, uplifting music.  Very nice colors, plants, decorations, new furniture (tables and booths) and overall just extremely well taken care of.

Pros:
- Everything tasted homemade
- Friendly staff
- Red velvet pancakes were delicious! Not overly sweet. The cream cheese ""syrup"" was a nice complement to the moist cakes.
- budget-friendly, family-friendly
- go for the garlic rice as a side (goes great with over-easy eggs)
- don't come here if you're trying to watch your weight or have food issues. If you're going to be high-maintenance, stay home & eat a gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free thingy.

Cons:
- Food could be hotter. Our meals came out lukewarm. Not a deal breaker. Just request that your meal is served hot, that is if that's how you like it.",pCPJLeBhSA4cLT9xzprrIA,0,1,4,vtJzUYPtKhFmrlf10WgVVQ

We wanted to take my dad out to breakfast, but since we're not from Vegas and he's only lived in Summerlin for a couple years, we turned to Yelp for help. And of course it did no disappoint. 

We started at the original location, but the line was crazy long so we drove down the street to this location. There was still a wait, but we offered to sit at the counter so we were seated immediately. And our service was great, BTW. Sometimes the counter gets forgotten, but we never were.

I ordered the bacon and avocado skillet with a side of red velvet pancakes. My husband ordered the carnitas skillets with a side of lemon ricotta pancakes. And my dad ordered the carrot cake pancakes and a side of potatoes. We were all blown away with how delicious everything was! My skillet was perfect and those red velvet pancakes -- well, you can read all about them in the numerous other reviews. Let me just say, they were everything they were cracked up to be. I think I actually prefer red velvet pancakes to red velvet cake now. That's right, I said it. Oh, and their salsa is all homemade and delicious!

The winner of the morning, however, was the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were more like crepes and they were absolutely PERFECT. So light and fresh. We couldn't stop talking about them, or the restaurant in general. So much so that even a month later while having dinner with some family back home, we mentioned the place and my aunt (who isn't visiting Vegas for months) made me send her all the info for BabyStacks so that she could go eat those pancakes during her visit. 

Well done, BabyStacks. We come back to Vegas at least once a year and I know where one of our stops will always be.",QExDVuut0SnRgyIDqqKASg,1,1,5,MvVEX8qR7S4E2D06ITm7QA

I'm really hoping she just didn't hear me. That waiter got me a fresh cup and put some sugar packets under the leg of the table to even it out. I finally get to try my coffee and it's very bland.

First off, the wait is going to be extremely long as seating is limited here. If you can withstand the wait, you will get seated very closely with other customers.

Then I wasn't very hungry, so I saw the kids meals were available. It never stated anywhere on the menu that you are not able to get a kids meal over a certain age or anything. So I thought, what a great idea to get the perfect amount of food since I wasn't that hungry. Well, the waitress was very rude and would not allow it, despite me even showing her there is nothing showing an age limit. I settled on just a drink and small side item. 

The food is good and prices are alright. Service once seated took a little while as well. I will not be returning, to this location at least.

Whenever I am not at work, or wake up early enough to eat breakfast, this is the first place on my mind! I am so glad they are opening up several new locations (this is the 2nd location) because the lines were out the door!!

As everyone recommends, the Red Velvet pancakes are always a hit! Personally, my favorite pancake is the Banana Cream Pie pancakes!! There are so many to choose from, and I bet they are all great. Hmm. I just thought of a new goal.. TRY ALL THE PANCAKES ON THE MENU!

Along with the dessert, the food is undoubtedly WONDERFUL! From the Adobo Omelet, Kahlua Pork Benedict, Kahlua Pork Grilled Cheese, to the Portuguese Sausage and Egg, you cannot go wrong with anything you decide to get. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOSO!!!

Also, if you use a cc - expect them to ask for your tip at ring out on take out orders... it's really awkward, and horribly worse when you get home and it's the wrong order! 

By the time he got home (now 1 hr later), I found out it one of the two orders had the wrong meat...If you call in a takeout order, have them repeat it back to you & check it at the counter...because when I called them, they argued with me that I ordered it wrong. I have never in my life eaten turkey sausage (which apparently are scary dry patties). 

After I said there's literally no way I ordered something I've never heard of, they did replace it, but I drove to get it since he was already really pissed off from the first pick up delay and the nerve of them to ask for a tip when they lost the ticket and he got stuck waiting around 30+ mins.

So I thought I've never been here before, but once I entered the restaurant, I was like ok I actually remember coming here before. I came with my family and they all said the same thing. At that time though, I was more of a savory breakfast type than a sweet breakfast type. 

When I first saw the menu, I had a really really hard time choosing. Ive never seen such a large variety of pancakes to choose from. I wanted to get the Cookie Butter French Toast because I LOVE Nutella and cookie butter, but I also really craved Banana Cream Pie Pancakes because I LOVE banana cream pie. So, I just couldn't help it and got both. My mom ordered from the Specials Menu, she got the Toffee Lemon Caramel Pancakes (TLC). 

We got short stacks for all the pancakes, which prices vary by type of pancake, but in this instance the banana cream pie pancakes were $5.75, the French toast was $9.50.

The Cookie Butter French Toast was really really good. It had a slight crunch and not overly sweet, just perfect. They used crunchy cookie butter which was just delicious. I would totally get it again.

So for the pancakes, I was expecting banana cream pie pancakes, but it tasted too artificial and nothing like banana cream pie. I was pretty disappointed in that and for the TLC pancakes, they were an even bigger disappointment. They were barely sweet at all, so we asked for some maple syrup. 

I would give this place 3 stars if it wasn't for the French toast. It was love at first bite, I instantly fell in love with it. So that boot the 3 to a 4 star.",ufyAVgQtyR1hazUYkMvlMw,0,0,4,H31jf_5NOb8Ooe2-plEzdw

The servers don't seem to care at all if you're waiting to be greeted, what I would like to drink, and most of all... take my order and get my order right. I waited nearly over 20 mins. to get my drink order then I literally had to stand up and see all the servers hanging around the cashier laughing and not giving a damn. I said *out loud.. Can I pleeeeease order? The next reaction just stunned me. All three just looked away and looked down as if they were checking their phones and counting money?!??? Seriously??? After one server was finished with whatever bs she was doing, she walked up to my table like nothing and asked me what I want to get. At this moment, I'm already disgusted by the service here. I told Felisha, my server a short stack of Macadamia Nut and Carrot Cakes.. also Portuguese sausage and eggs.. for an extra charge, I substituted with egg whites. From how things are going, I also asked for two to go boxes, because I wasn't going to stay much longer. Waiting is Riiiiidiculous here.

My pancakes came and unfortunately both were tasteless and dry even with all that syrup and cream cheese toppings. Then my server brings the egg whites separate and the Portuguese sausage separate.. I'm like.. you have to be kidding me right?!! Does she not know I came here before and order this very dish to know she messed up on my order. Since she never came around after dropping off my food I waved down to catch another server/busser? and asked him... doesn't the Portuguese sausage and eggs come with hash browns??? He looked so puzzled and slowly said yes..... yes ""wait"" a minute. Then another five minutes later my server comes by and said oh I thought you wanted them separate. I told her no I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs entree. It does come with hash browns right? She goes.. yes here you go and was about to turn around and walk away... Not so fast... I told her.. Excuse me... she turned around and I go, since I ordered the entree.. it includes a side of pancakes doesn't it?? She goes.. yes it does. I look at her and she looks at me like yea so?!? I told her.... Soooo am I going to get a side of pancakes or ??? She goes well what kind you want? I'm like whatever kind comes with this entree. She goes well we have buttermilk or for an extra charge red velvet. I told her I just want what comes with the entree. If I didn't say anything, she wasn't even going to bother correcting my order and think I haven't dined here.. more so think I don't know what this entree includes. Not that slick sweetheart. I'm going to get what I'm paying for not half ass. That right there was wrongly done. Not nice to treat a repeat guest or any guest for that matter. The hash brown was semi-cooked, portuguese sausage was over cooked and extremely dry like burned wood chips. The only thing that came out good out of this experience was the eggs whites. I can't believe the service here and the worst part is it WASN'T even busy at all. Unacceptable.

Thank goodness I asked for my to go boxes, it came in handy and again, I had to ask a different server/cashier if I can get a container cover for the syrup and cream cheese. This place should be called Long Wait that Stacks Up, because obviously that's all I experienced here. And of course the sneaky server Felisha that tried to get away in not offering me the pancakes that came with the meal. Lazy. Even though it's the last hour, you should always treat the guest as if they are your first, middle, or last. They are still your guest!!!",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,10,5,1,ixM7nVA7PNdSdqQVwCts9Q

The wait was 20 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't too bad, and for once, we were at a restaurant where my in-laws being white, were the ones who were outnumbered!! Muahahahaha. 

The atmosphere is very casual, and not bad for a brunch place. I ordered the Huntington omelette and I wish I heeded Alana's review saying to stay away from it. It was pretty miserable. Everyone else at the table loved their food, but mine was by far the worst. An omelette with probably 2? or 1 1/2? pieces of bacon cut up into the omelette with nearly non-existent cheddar cheese mixed into the eggs, and half of an over-riped avocado slices on top. I will NEVER order that again. I got the specialty Almond Joy pancakes & I guess this was my fault, but I didn't expect a chocolate batter, because I am not a big fan of chocolate cakes or chocolate pastries, but obviously, this came with chocolate pancakes, with slices almonds, coconut, and whipped cream. They weren't THAT sweet, but I wish I ordered something else.

My husband got the country fried steak which I tried a piece of and was very tasty. He ordered banana cream pie pancakes which were the best of the table. My children had s'mores pancakes which came with marshmallows and graham cracker crumbles. I didn't try them, but they were engulfed in seconds since I try to limit their sugar intake. This was certainly a treat for them. They also had the breakfast combo with eggs and bacon. The bacon was great! Thick and perfectly cooked to a crisp. The carrot cake pancakes that my mother in law ordered were a flop. WAY too heavy and cake-like rather than light and fluffy like pancakes should be. I don't know if I would be back as I already have a favorite brunch spot, and we seldom go to brunch, but I can see the appeal of specialty pancakes and I would say to stick to those, and stay away from the Huntington omelette.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,0,0,3,IozxOvtN-1k5UI07Wnj36w

**Loco Moco--Order this with the sausage patty instead of the regular beef patty. It will change your view of Loco Moco forever! Go with the garlic rice, too. A must!

**Kalua Pork Benedicts-Disappointed! The flavors didn't work well together and it was so bland. I only had a few bites and gave up...I was tremendously unsatisfied that I had to order another Loco Moco to fill in that void!  

**Red Velvet Pancakes-BOMB! It's better to eat this fresh so if you plan to eat this for dessert like me, order the pancakes when you're halfway through your savory dish. The cream cheese syrup is just amazing and not too sweet! Try not to add too much of the whipped cream in each bite so you can really enjoy the flavors of the pancake. For me, the short stack is just the perfect portion. 

**Lemon Ricotta Pancakes-Just wonderful! It's light, fluffy, and simply refreshing. The citrus flavor of the lemon is really enhanced with the cream cheese syrup. There's no short stack option for this so plan to share because it's huge. 

**Portuguese sausage sliders-Not impressed. Hawaiian rolls with Portuguese sausage and eggs scrambled with green onions. It's good but it's something you can make yourself at home..maybe better!

I've always been sketchy about breakfast food but after my experience with the French toast, I've decided that brunch is a must for me every weekend. If you let the whip cream melt for a bit before eating your french toast/pancake, it is definitely worth it!

2794512,2015-03-27,2,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I cannot convey in words just how delicious these damn pancakes are.

My boyfriend is not a pancake person.  He doesn't enjoy food like I do, and pancakes are pretty much at the bottom of his breakfast/brunch list. He always finishes these pancakes.  

This breakfast place works great for a California- Hawaii couple like us.  They have an awesome selection of Hawaii ""comfort foods"" like corned beef hash, Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, loco moco, etc.  But, they also have awesome Southwest/Cali/Mex breakfast foods like huevos rancheros.

Favorites:
- Red Velvet pancakes are a MUST try.  They're light, delicately chocolately, and covered with REAL whipped cream- which really makes the dish superb. Pancakes are a normal size, not hujangez like Hash House a Go Go, and are slightly crispy on the outside, and warm and spongy on the inside.

- Bananas Foster pancakes:  YES... quite decadent for breakfast, but definitely worth the calories... no wait... I don't want to know how many calories there are in this... Again, the whipped cream really ties the dish together... along with fresh bananas foster.... warm and caramelly. Next time, we'll try the French toast.

- Adobo Fried Rice:  My favorite [non pancake] item on the menu so far.  Pork adobo is cooked to perfection, and combines well with the rice in a savory- slightly tangy (from adobo vinegar).  Next time, I may ask for the rice with the egg done over easy.  I enjoyed the fried egg wrap, but I think it may taste better with an egg yolk cracked over the rice.

- Kalua Pig Benedict:  Awesome... although, I've done this myself at home with some leftover kalua pig, English muffins, and eggs.  Their hollandaise sauce was definitely better, though.

- Loco Moco with garlic fried rice:  Pretty typical.  I would recommend adding the garlic fried rice for an extra kick, though.  Traditional brown gravy, and well prepared hamburger patty made it feel like home.  Gravy was a bit saltier than usual though.

*TIP: Go on a weekday if you can.  Weekends are just nuts.  The boyfriend and I both work from home, so we've been going on Tuesday or Wednesday mornings and usually have no wait for a table.",CkH69yFBvm4dPDeKNzIjYw,1,2,5,sh3eVblXaMo5FwZlBZWjcQ

We came in and waited patiently to be seated and another party of four walk in and they seat them right away. I say something to the person who sat them and he said I didn't know you guys were waiting. My response was I just randomly sit in a restaurant not trying to eat. And he said well I can't ask them to get up since I already sat them. 

But we were just super hungry so they sat us at the bar. Our waitress took our order and then we waited for 45 mins before some of our food came. 

My friend ordered steak and eggs and my husband ordered country fried steak and my other friend ordered red velvet pancakes. All of which came out before my salad did. When our waitress brought out their food she said the salad was going to be right out. Fifteen mins later my salad still didn't come out. So I asked our waitress what happened to my salad. And her answer was I don't know the kitchen is all confused back there. 

So I told her if it's not coming out now cancel it I'll just eat somewhere else because everyone else I am with are basically done eating. 

When we got our bill you figure she would have discounted something for the issue but nothing. Then when I went to pay in front and the guy asked me how everything was she still didn't say anything.

The other two dishes were kinda meh. Im not a huge fan of egg things so thats my fault really. The adobo fried rice was good on its own but the egg it was wrapped in had no seasoning or flavor so I had to pick it apart.

I can't give this location 5 stars only because the service just wasn't there, however everything else seemed exactly like the North location, of course I'll be back to try more menu items!",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,0,0,4,8eTvA5aHqD426Y3oJuMt6w

I tried their Rick's adobo fried rice, which comes wrapped in an omelette-style egg, and the loco moco, which has two eggs any style you want on house made burger patty on top of steamed white rice slathered in their gravy. Both were really good, although definitely a bit heavy for the morning. I opted to spend $1.50 more to add on their babystack pancakes as a side. I tried the red velvet which was delicious with the whipped cream but the cream cheese syrup was too heavy for me. The smores was okay. It didn't have much  chocolate chips and marshmallow in the batter and the toppings were lacking. Wish I tried the banana foster instead. 

My boyfriend liked the baby chick and omelette and the build your own omelette option. He also usually doesn't like pancakes but he actually enjoyed their cookies and cream pancakes.

Yea... Yea... it's a breakfast place that serves up dessert for breakfast.  I mean... their specialties are pancakes that are dessert-like.  They do have a big menu but I was fixated on the pancakes.  (There are egg dishes and ... Oh Yea... Spam dishes and Adobo Fried Rice on the breakfast menu... but I just couldn't order it all in 1 sitting .... Must Go Back!)

So... I had the Bananas Foster French Toast.  As you might expect... it was sweet. But Oh So Good!  I did wipe most of the whipped cream off of it.  And I should have asked for the syrup on the side rather than have them slather the whole plate in syrup.  Next time... I'll know better.  The bananas foster was good but like I mentioned to my friends... needed more rum.  :)  LOL!  That's just how I roll though.  :)  I did like it a lot though.

My girlfriend had the nutella pancakes and she pretty much licked the plate clean too.  So... all in all... a success.

My other 2 girlfriends opted for egg dishes and they enjoyed their breakfasts too.  None of us had a bad thing to say.  

The ambience is diner-like... small and tables are kinda close together.
There's usually ALWAYS a wait on the weekend.... so be prepared to wait.

They do have a lunch menu too... who knew?!  But I love breakfast and would probably always order off of the breakfast menu.  :)",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,0,0,4,fvJBUGIkYBIHj7GYOav3PQ

BUT, Babystacks is known for their pancakes so I thought I'd get some. Their pancakes are the reason why I give this place 4 stars. I ordered their new ""Cookies n cream"" pancakes.

My friend got the fried rice adobo which was too salty for her but she said the egg and some ketchup and hot sauce saved it. She also added the smores pancake on the side for $1.50 more. I got the kahlua pig Benedict with hash browns and it was definitely lacking some flavor. I had my friend try a piece and she agreed that It needed some hot sauce and salt. 

Portion sizes are big, especially if you're adding on a pancake! It's about the same size as their normal orders but instead of 3 or 6, you get 2.

We came on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was busy; I believe we waited 45 minutes.  Echo the hostess welcomed us and asked for our name.  In the front, there are benches so you can sit while you wait for your table.  I was looking at the menu and there were a lot of tempting breakfast items to choose from.  The pancakes that caught my attention were, carrot, bacon, hazelnut, cinnamon, banana cream pie, orange creamsicle, rocky road,  white chocolate chip macadamia nut, and cookies & cream.  We ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (comes with one side), Portuguese Sausage & Eggs, and Cora's Corned Beef Hash and Eggs.  Then we got pancakes, Banana Foster, Cinnabun, and Red Velvet.  

::Food::
I was curious about Rick's Adobo (traditional Filipino dish) Fried Rice.  The way they served the adobo was creative.  It was wrapped in an omelet, inside was shredded chicken, rice, and garnished with green onions.  I like the concept but the flavor tasted different.  Also, there was more rice than chicken.  The Portuguese sausage and corned beef hash were good, they both came with poached eggs.

The PANCAKES!!  The Banana Foster is my favorite.  It was topped with caramelized bananas, whip cream, and cinnamon sugar.  Next is the Red Velvet (best seller), the color of the pancake was bright, it was topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumble and came with a side of cream cheese.  Then we also got the Cinnabon pancake.  It had sweet icing, crunchy pecans, and dusted with cinnamon and sugar.  I would get the Banana Foster, Red Velvet, and Portuguese Sausage & Eggs again!

Those babycakes...whoa. So good. I would suggest starting out with a short stack bc the sheer amount of sugar in these things will start to get to ya, but holy is it worth it. These bad boys are delicious. I had the pleasure of taking down a few cinnabun style today and I'm thinking of going back for more. Sweet icing on the top, cinnamon sprinkled throughout and just a few crumbled nuts on top, it was just like eating a cinnamon bun (Costanza style), but you get to dip it in syrup. Win.

We also ordered the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs. For less than 2 bucks, you can upgrade regular pancakes to specialty. We got the carrot cake which were yummy but the red velvet trumps them all.

Be sure to take advantage of the current Yelp deal - 15 dollars for 7 bucks. You can buy up to 3 and it excludes Fri and Sat.

Now, I'm a HUGE breakfast and brunch fan! Their extensive menu is mostly geared towards breakfast food, with just one page dedicated to their lunch menu. At first I thought it was just your regular American type of Breakfast and Brunch place, but they also have Hawaiian plates such as Loco Moco and Spam Scramble. Apparently they're known for their pancakes, or ""BabyStacks"". There was such a huge variety that I felt pretty overwhelmed. I wanted to try everything! Thanks to Yelp, I just had to order the Red Velvet short stack. Seriously, this was pretty much a dessert party in my mouth! Probably one of the best Red Velvet pancakes I've had.

We also ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which is adobo fried rice that's stuffed into an egg omelette.

I've always liked red velvet cupcakes/cakes, but cluelessly had never thought of it being made into different forms of carb goodness. 

Baby Stacks is a normal looking breakfast joint in a normal looking shopping mall, but what lurks inside is NOT normal. The food here has a bit of a Hawaiian influence that results in an AWESOME party in your mouth ;) 

We each ordered from the ""Breakfast Favorites."" The hub had the ""bacon and eggs"" and chose hash browns and buttermilk babystacks. I had their ""Portuguese sausage and eggs"" and chose rice and their specialty RED. VELVET. BABYSTACKS. The hub said his breakfast was good, but you can get what he ordered anywhere else that serves breakfast. My order on the other hand was absolutely FANTASTIC! There's no way to describe the joy and utter elation I felt when those red velvet cakes hit my tongue *cue foodgasm noise.* Done deal, 5 stars! As soon as those stacks hit the table I pounced and I pounced hard! Oh man, I can't wait to have them again. They're perfectly done and when you add the cream cheese icing/syrup with the gorgeously whipped cream, it's utter food heaven. 

So, what have we learned? Don't come here for a ""normal"" breakfast and get here fast because this place fills up quick! And please, please don't say I didn't warn you when you fall in love at first bite ;)",MSCVDZf_2AygHxLg-bz8kQ,45,42,5,9hg8LXTKZ3EmwPV6A-4N3Q

I love Banana pancakes and the short stack of 3 (couldn't finish) was chock full of bananas both inside and out.  I opted out of the powdered sugar sprinkle. 
My hubby got Huevos Rancheros with a side of nicely browned hash browns.  He almost finished it.  It was not too spicy which was fine with him.
Our neighboring table got beautiful Kahlua Pork sandwich with fries and the gentleman got some substantial Eggs Benedict.

Don't blame him so this weekend, a holiday weekend, he asks, ""Wanna go to breakfast?"" Um, YEAH! So off we go to wait somewhere for breakfast. I chose a no-egg-in-title-ergo-no-griddle-fry, breakfast joint, for this rare occasion. Been to Babystacks a couple years ago before the name change. It was good but mostly crowded, and we were suckered into ordering the red velvet pancakes. As pancakes go, they were good, but honestly, it was a mistake to order because not particularly a fan of red velvet because of the systematic abuse of red food coloring and fake chocolate flavor that occurred as a result of the trend that been red velvet in the last decade, as opposed to the light cocoa flavor it's supposed to have. This time, however, we partook in the Hawaiian-style brekkie (Moco Loco and Portuguese sausage and eggs w rice) as well as a skillet and of course many sides of many non-red velvet pancakes (banana cream pie, cookies and cream, lemon ricotta) plus a Nutella crepe. Suffice it to say, everything was delicious, not greasy, no odor of the dreaded griddle fry, and despite all the food ordered, we all left satisfied and not overly stuffed. There was a wait, but turn-around was efficient and quick as could be. Place was clean and friendly and did we mention no griddle fry? Btw, their red velvet pancakes are, in fact, good if you still like the trend, er...flavor. 

Him: The pancakes were soft and delicious. I ordered cookies and cream pancakes. They were so chocolatey. They came with cream and glaze, but I didn't even need the glaze. Also, I loved the skillet. It wasn't a scramble, just over-easy eggs on top, so there were sautéed veggies underneath and they were so good. I couldn't stop eating them. There were potatoes, onion, peppers and mushroom and cheese. There was a wait but it felt like forever (it actually was about 20 mins after told 30). That is how good the place is: everyone wants to eat there so we had to wait forever. It was worth the wait.

The signature Red Velvet pancakes will bring more meaning to your life. They come out sprinkled with a chocolate crumble, slightly melted whip cream and a side of cream cheese syrup.  You may think the short stack won't be enough, but it is PLENTY.  Only order the full if you plan on sharing (prices are more than reasonable btw.) 

The Lemon Crepes, and the smore's pancakes are a couple others I've tried.  If you're indecisive, this place might stress you out but just know -- everything is delicious.  I usually order seasoned potatoes to go with the sweet portion of the meal, because you can't have sweet without salty :P

The red velvet pancakes: chocolately red fluffiness with a dollop of sweet whip cream and chocolate. That cream cheese frosting is not overly sweet  (to me) so it went well with the pancakes.

My bf didn't like the banana cream pie pancake since it was too dense for him. We both like fluffy pancakes. The Portuguese sausage was very good but it tasted like the ones we buy packed at the grocery store. It was not made in-house.

I decided to take my family there before we left Vegas, so my second trip was just as good as the first. This time I ordered the Honey Toast (delectable!) and my family ordered: red velvet pancakes, strawberries and cream pancakes, and corned beef hash with garlic rice and an over easy egg. The garlic rice was so-so as they put too many onion slices in it. Be prepared to order a full or half stack of pancakes if you're hungry and a sweet tooth.

In terms of service, we arrived at a busy time, around 11:00 AM so we had to wait 15-20 minutes before we were seated. The waitress was very pleasant and replenished our coffee mugs. The restaurant is small and gets very busy, so if you go, go early. Their hours are Mon-Fri 7:00 AM - 2:00 PM, and Sat-Sun 7-3PM. Their prices are a bit steep, but makes up for the quality of the fresh food. You must eat there!",bipKZW5yj41Sw50HifIS6Q,0,0,4,3VAGLq4n76Ab75inSBWZGA

Came here by 9 and there is already a line. Thats pretty normal here to be busy so expect a slight wait if you have parties of more than four. 

Lets get to the must orders:
Pancakes
- Red Velvet (if you like it, not my favorite but a guest favorite, get sauce on side if you don't like things too sweet)
- Banana cream Pie - LOVE IT, but I always get the sauce on the side since its too much for me
- Chocolate Chip - LOVE IT
Crepes
-Solid Choice, but you can also get at buffets so, usually I pass on this one
Adobo Fried Rice Omelette - Delicious! Must try
Loco Moco - Good gravy, not as good as in hawaii, but you can add garlic rice here which I recommend!

They also have usual breakfast items like Ham, bacon, corned beef hash, etc. These are all not bad items, but also you can also get them anywhere and they do a find job of making these dishes. I only talked about the ones above because they're my favorites and you can't get at too many other places.

I was the one who wanted to go here, but my friend who has a sweet tooth started getting more excited than me as he perused the menu. No surprise since the pancakes sound more like desserts than breakfast food. We ordered a few to try - red velvet tastes like dessert with marshmallow whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, while white chocolate and the others taste just like normal pancakes with fancy toppings. Also, the kalua pig benedict didn't taste like normal kalua pig so I wouldn't recommend it.

It had all the makings of a great place--great food, great service, comfortable seating, etc.  Both locations are a bit of hump off the strip, but are great places to hit up after a weekend of binge drinking and other unsavory activities up to and including: donkey shows, midget lap dances, dice games at the MGM west wing alley way entrance, passing out nudie flyers.  I had the adobo omelette and shared a short stack of the red velvet pancakes with the lady.  Besides creativity, the omelette was pretty spot on.  No surprises here with the chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette.  Just good eats.  I could make a recommendation of trying to use pork instead of chicken next time.

The omelette also came with what could possibly be the best macaroni salad I've had in my life.  Rich and creamy with a possible hint of garlic or something magical, it left me wanting more and licking the tiny bowl the serving came in.

For the piece de resistance--red velvet pancakes.  Seems like a great idea in theory and even better in practice at babystacks.  The pancakes had a perfect melding of  cake and pancake texture while maintaining that subtle red velvet taste.  The cream on top was absolutely phenomenal and I would definitely consider that as a bath water substitute.  

All in all, great place with great food and service. Like I said, it is now a Vegas tradition of mine and you might want to consider making it one of your as well.

Soo this place is a interesting breakfast place. I believe its a asian/filipino/hawaiian style of food, but they also serve a wide assortment of pancakes. Came in with a couple of friends and the place was pretty busy. I didn't know that this location existed, but we were quickly seated. They have alot of the traditional breakfast fare, but they also have a bunch of hawaiian/asian food options as well.

We checked out of course what everyone gets: the red velvet pancakes! and the white chocolate macadamia pancakes! These things are more of a dessert rather than a actual dish, pure sugary sweetness. I liked the white chocolate ones but my friends thought they were waaay to sweet. But I think they jus have poor taste. the Red Velvet ones were exactly that, red dyed pancakes, with a interesting cream cheese syrup which sounded out but worked out well. I liked the red velvet, they were good, but I don't think they live up to the immense hype that I heard of.

We also ordered another dish, I think Huevos Rancheros or something, but it was obviously forgettable. To be honest, the place is my opinion is good, but it's not as amazing as everyone else makes to seem. The red velvet pancakes are good, and I liked the food, but there are much better breakfast places in town.

Way better than dennys or ihop offers. The pancakes are fluffy and the cream cheese syrup is delicious, not overly sweet. The melted whip cream on top adds a nice freshness. It only took about 5 minutes for my food to come out. My waitress made sure my coffee cup was full at all times. Just a few tips: make sure to check out the specials board, if I had I would have ordered the chocolate bliss pancakes instead of red velvet  (since one is limited and the other is permanent). Another one, they have this posted everywhere, you cannot split guest checks so if you come with a big party just be prepared! I will definitely be coming back!

The name is BabyStacks Cafe, so you can assume that they specialize in pancakes, and specialize they do! The front page of their menu has a list of different kinds of pancakes they serve. The red velvet is supposedly the most popular, and it is delicious, but my favorite is the cinnabun personally. I personally wouldn't recommend ordering plain pancakes here since they have so many different specialties, but if that's something you like, I don't think that'd be a bad decision either. 

I usually order a skillet or omelette with a side of pancakes. It cost more to order specialty pancakes with your omelette or skillet, but you get the best of both worlds that way. I treat the pancakes like a dessert/side dish kind of thing because most of the pancakes are sweet. You get the main dish with eggs, meat, and maybe potatoes and then you have the pancakes on the side that that is just the perfect combination!

On the weekends, it gets kind of busy, so expect a wait unless you go fairly early and the service can be slow at times, but you can't expect every place to be overstaffed with people waiting to serve you when you come in. They do the best job they can. I remember I came here with many of my family members and we didn't get one of our orders of pancakes and they have us a free short stack of a random specialty pancake. I'm glad they made it up to us for not bringing our order in time because that showed me how much they care about their customer service. 

I recommend going here if you want to catch some breakfast or lunch. I personally won't go to any other breakfast specialty place in Vegas while BabyStacks is open for business.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,3,3,5,QeQjOfbfp_CDNqSJlx-lVw

I order the steak and eggs over easy with hash browns, and opted for the upgraded two stack red velvet pancakes. Uncle Kai gets  some kind of avocado sandmich and fries with a stack of banana cream pancakes. The steak and eggs meets the standard specifications of steak and eggs. Nothing was left on the plate. I did not sample the avocado sandmich so I can't comment on it. Let's get to the pancakes. I did sample the homie's banana cream pancakes. I had one bite. It was    AIGHT.

The Good:
Holy moly, their breakfast was so good!! They specialize in pancakes, of course. They have a wide variety of just about everything you can think of to mix in to pancake batter. In fact, there were a few specials of pancakes that weren't even on the menu. 

I had an egg white omelet with a side of rice instead of hash browns. In addition, I ordered a mini side of chocolate chip pancakes. SO GOOD!

The Bad:
It's hard to eat healthy in this type of breakfast place. Most all of the pancakes and breakfast items are for sure going to be high in calories. But, sometimes you have to treat yourself every once in a while. 

Oh, also their tables are a bit small for their plate sizes. Other than that, Baby Stacks was great!",d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,1,0,4,YWeUAiL4w3SgLr11s8zX_A

I decided long and hard after mulling over the menu that I needed to have my savory and sweet! Country gravy was made with real ham and not at all heavy.  More creamy and just the perfect amount smeared on the steak.  The potatoes are so good! Like little steak fries! And probably the best part was the Red Velvet Stacks!

So so many different delicious options for pancakes! There are a ton of unique flavors of pancakes offered such as banana cream pie, cinnabun, etc. Our table ordered full stacks of red velvet and s'mores pancakes to share. In my opinion, the red velvet pancakes were a little overrated because they were kind of dry unless you covered it with whip cream and cream cheese frosting... But the s'mores pancakes were delicious especially the part of the batter that had chocolate. It was like having dessert for breakfast. Those of you with a sweet tooth will be especially pleased. :)

I'd definitely recommend taking the drive off the strip to come here if you want some good breakfast! Friendly and attentive service. They're only open until three pm so they specialize in breakfast foods and you can sleep in a little and go get brunch after noon. 

Babystacks has savory breakfast items, but I think you MUST order pancakes here at least to share with everyone at the table.

I loved the crumbled chocolate on the red velvet pancakes but I have had better ones. It seems as if reading ""cream cheese syrup"" on the menu is supposed to hook you in but I felt that it was nothing more than liquidy cream cheese icing, hardly a syrup really. Plus, there was way too much food coloring in the red velvet pancakes because the color was beyond a deep red velvet and more like an unappetizing shocking red color. The Kalua Pig Benedict didn't stand a chance with soggy english muffins. The ""seasoned"" potatoes were bland and tasted like they were straight out of a frozen bag.   

Service here was mixed for me. The hostess was friendly enough considering how busy it was, our waitress was very friendly but the girl at the cashier, the one person actually taking our money didn't provide any customer service at all. A real let down at the end of the meal.

They were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside. In gave up and just laughed it off, as this is really unprofessional in my opinion. The crepe was mediocre and underdone too.

Not only is it my favorite meal of the day, but I almost always have to get a savory item AND a sweet item. Wifey kept it simple and ordered Cheesy scrambled eggs and hash browns with an upgrade of Rocky Road pancakes. I had the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, substituted the macaroni salad (but still got it anyway) and  upgraded to their famous Red Velvet Pancakes. I love banana pancakes and banana cream pie, so  I had to try their banana cream pie pancakes as well.

I KINDA SORTA FORGOT two important words though.......

Short Stack.........DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Must've been a sign of hunger!)

I killed my omelette and  we both preferred the Red velvet pancakes as the rocky road ones sounded better than it tasted. Out came the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes, and that plate of 6(or was it 8???) pancakes was enough for 2-3 people! I dug in and wow! were they good! It felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast. I also kinda wish they would've toasted the almonds for added flavor though, just sprinkling them on raw didn't do any justice.

Anywho, although I didn't kill it, I did some serious damage leaving just one pancake  left. ""Whoa!, you really put a dent in those pancakes!"" A table next to us said...""Are you a competitve eater?"" ""No, but I did have 80 pieces of sushi in one sitting, and put away a 12 scoop bucket of ice cream with the works in an hour.""

Back in the day there was a ton of hype for BSC, all my friends were uploading pictures of their glorious pancakes. Now that hype is over and being an egg making master I've become disappointed with the eggs. The previous visits I've always had eggs that are overcooked, makes me sad. The portions have gotten smaller and isn't exactly the cheapest spot in the neighborhood. These days my tooth isn't as sweet anymore to devour their variety of pancakes. I've always thought $3 for a smaller glass of orange juice is a bit high. 

While BSC does have an array of Hawaiian breakfast items, it just doesn't scream excellence or cause any cravings. However if you are determined to have your first meal of the day at BSC, my favorites were the kalua benedict, the Huntington skillet, and carrot cake pancakes. 

Service has always been fine, water gets refilled, no problems with the bill, and orders are correct.

Filipino fusion breakfast food. Amazingly delicious.

Our table ended up ordering the same thing - Cora's Corn Beef Hash & Eggs $10.95. You can choose to have it with potatoes or hashbrowns, 2 eggs any style, and it comes with regular pancakes.  I got mine with eggs over medium, garlic rice (extra $1) and nutella pancakes (extra $1). My friend got it with eggs over medium, hashbrowns, and macadamia nut pancakes. My other friend got it with eggs over medium, potatoes, and lemon ricotta pancakes. There was no talking at breakfast. And every morsel was eaten. So incredibly flavorful and delicious!

They also bring you a smorgasburg of hot sauces with your food - you don't even have to ask. The menu is extensive and they have all sorts of pancakes and specialties (our neighbor table got the Kalua Pig Benedict and the Loco Moco and was raving about it).

Service was great! Restaurant was super clean and a chill, mom and pop ambiance. If you make a reservation, they won't seat you unless your whole party is there -so respect the rule. They weren't busy when we arrived at 9am, but other reviewers say the place gets packed so be ready for a wait if you aren't there early!",-FuYIK8244zl00282CSDLQ,0,0,5,Jm73v-GUKF6Xagfgm2jykw

Yes there is quite a wait but my friend and I were catching up so it went by quickly.  From the looks of the menu, I wanted to order everything.  Being part Filipina from Hawaii, it was refreshing to see the food had that same ethnic vibe.  I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs, & garlic fried rice.  I really didn't like the texture of the corned beef hash.  It was too processed, and like another Yelper noted, reminded me of dog food.  The garlic rice was good, like my mom's.  I also didn't care for the pancakes.  They tasted very strongly of baking powder.  I can't remember what my son ordered but he ate it all without complaints.  My friend, also from Hawaii,  ordered the Loco Moco and ate all of hers.  She ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and again, the taste of baking powder was overpowering.  The cream cheese syrup was good.  My son ate the rest and liked them.
  
I am not completely turned off by the place and want to give them another try.  Perhaps the pancakes were just bad that day?  I want to try other items on the menu.  I think it's great there are Hawaiian-style breakfast items on the menu even though the owner is not from Hawaii.  Oh yeah, we were told that the chili on the menu is Zippy's chili!!!

Unfortunately they did not live up to all the hype, we were both expecting red velvet pancakes but got pancakes with food coloring we were pretty disappointed. The pancakes were not fluffy goodness but yet a weird texture not to tasty and the ""cream cheese syrup""  tasted like that frosting you would put on those cinnamon rolls you get at the grocery store. 

Now on the flip side I ordered the Huntington omelet which had cheddar cheese, bacon and avocado which came with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes i got the ""seasoned potatoes"" which were not seasoned one bit and i also got an english muffin which was good but how can you mess that up. The omelet was pretty tasty how can you go wrong with cheese bacon and avocado , nothing that great but it was good.

Plus I owed him a good birthday breakfast so I had to make it count! The wait wasn't long at all. We were seated at a small table for two, but they were so accomodating to move us to a bigger table when my sister dropped in for breakfast last minute. 

Vince ordered their orange creamsicle pancake (figures since his favorite color is after all orange.) After sampling a few bites, I would say that it tastes a lot like an orange creamsicle. The pancake is also orange. It is a fun choice for kids. the cream cheese and orange syrup was pretty delish and made for a good mix with the pancakes. 

I however, ordered the lemon ricotta. It is served with three crepe like thin pancakes and fresh lemon slices with cream cheese syrup. If you are a sweedish pancake fan or even a fan of tart and sweet...THIS IS THE PANCAKE FOR YOU! Oh..it was amazing. the pancakes were thin and soft, and the tart and sweetness combo made it just the right choice. the portions are big so you will get full fast.

It appears to be a family owned establishment, and that showed by the warm, genuine welcome we received upon entering the front door. On a Sunday, BabyStacks was packed, but we were able to snag a table in about ten minutes. 

BabyStacks has a reputation for a robust menu featuring every pancake flavor you can think of, in addition to hearty breakfast classics that come with a unique Filipino touch. I wanted both sweet and savory in my belly before the journey home to San Diego, and, therefore, opted to have the Kalua Pork Benedict and a small order of the Carrot Cake Pancakes with cream cheese icing. 

The Kalua Pork Benedict was amazing. The pork was succulent and flavorful. Loved the potatoes on the side. Unless you're a vegetarian, I challenge anyone to have a bite of this dish and not walk away happy. I enjoyed the Carrot Cake Pancakes, but I regretted not picking a different flavor. The pancakes were very good, but they weren't as moist as I was imagining them to be. On my next visit, I'm going to have the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes. 

My breakfast companion opted for the Adobo Rice Omelette. An imaginative dish that worked on every level. I snagged a bite and would have equally been pleased had I ordered it.

That's one of my biggest pet peeves, when a server drops off pancakes and doesn't leave any butter or syrup! It's a pancake!! Butter and syrup is crucial.

As much as I loved their Adobo and Rice Omelette last time I was there, I wanted to try something different this time, however I wasn't in the mood for their pancakes since I wanted something more savory.  The Hawaiian Benedict definitely caught my eye on the menu so I ordered that while my mom decided on their Kalbi Beef & Eggs.

Hawaiian Benedict -- http://bit.ly/2vLHkJQ
Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, Spam, Eggs, Brown Gravy, Furikake
This was like a loco moco but with Spam on top of Hawaiian sweet rolls and it was really good!!  I loved how everything was smothered in gravy and how the runny egg yolks oozed over everything as well.  Made for a very comforting meal.  I'd definitely order this again.  

Kalbi Beef & Eggs -- http://bit.ly/2vLshQl
This was what my mom ordered and she enjoyed it as well.  She gave me one of her kalbi short ribs to try and I thought it was marinated very well and not overcooked.  Great portion size though.

BabyStacks once again delivered as a great breakfast spot.  I'm glad I took my mom here and showed her that there are other great places to eat breakfast off the Strip.

It took a little while for someone to get our drink and food orders but they were super nice and didn't rush us. I got a strawberry baby stack with my Spam scramble with garlic fried rice. I demolished my strawberry pancakes and I only ate half of my Spam scramble. My cousin got the adobo omelette and he prefers the one at Baby Stacks over Aloha Kitchen.

So if you want to split the check, get over it. They do one check per table. Also they only seat you if your entire party has arrived. This didn't apply to us since we were paying and arriving together.

We were seated immediately by a very kind waitress. The menu has a good variety and their pancakes are so good. A short stack (3 pancakes) can easily fill you up for less than $5. We decided on the Bananas Foster and Red Velvet with sides of sausage and hash browns. The food was served very quickly. It was fantastic and surprising.

I highly recommend their pancakes and hash browns. They are the best I've tried in the Vegas area.

We ate at a relaxing pace and there was attentive service. When we asked for our check, it was ready immediately and we paid at the cashier. They cleaned our table before we were out the door and had it ready to seat new customers. I think we were out of there by 9:20.

3781002,2017-07-26,1,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Babystacks is a great, consistent breakfast choice for anyone living in the Spring Valley area. I've been going here since they opened and I've tried most of the things on the menu (except the lunch stuff). They have tons of creative pancake flavors, many of which can be an upgraded side for other breakfast entrees. I recommend the red velvet, lemon ricotta, and the strawberry pancakes. The red velvet pancakes come with a cream cheese syrup and a whipped cream on top. The strawberry pancakes have a strawberry syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream on top. Then the lemon ricotta is a thin, crepe-like pancake with lemons and powdered sugar.

I highly recommend getting a skillet or the adobo fried rice, then upgrading the side to your favorite babystack for an additional fee. It's worth it to have both if you're hungry then just take home any leftovers. The adobo fried rice is something I've never had at another restaurant. The fried rice is wrapped in a big omelette, probably like 3-4 eggs if I had to guess. The rice itself is flavorful and I love that you can taste a bit of vinegar in it with the meat.

The staff here is always friendly and attentive. They'll refill your water or coffee before you even need to flag them down. The prices are great, with most things hitting just under $10. When you're ready to go, they'll hand you the check and you go up to the front register to pay when you're done. They have a big parking lot in this plaza so there's more than enough space. Just try to avoid the weekend brunch crowd, when the wait can sometimes be 30+ mins. Other times, you'll be seated almost immediately. There's bathrooms in the back, always clean.

3788477,2015-10-18,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"My wife and I get out to Las Vegas one to two times per year.  Just like most people, we usually stay on the strip.  We get a shuttle from and back to the airport.  We NEVER rent a car.  Cabs can be expensive so we normally spend 95% of our time on the strip.  Now that we have family in Sin City, we are starting to venture out a little bit more, and it's the one of the best Vegas decisions we have ever made.

We were talking with our family about where to go for Sunday Brunch.  We found buffets ranging from $17.95 to $90 per person on the strip.  Then I hopped on the internet and found BabyStacks Cafe.  They have 4 locations in town. We liked the description and headed to the one off of Flamingo blvd on Buffalo Drive.

This restaurant is owned by a woman who dared to ask herself one crazy question:  What would happen if you take cupcake flavors and turn them into pancakes?  The answer, pure AWESOMENESS! We were a party of 4 and waited for about 30 minutes to get our table.  From what I read, this is pretty normal for the restaurant.  The capacity is a little over 50+ people, and the demand is high, so be prepared for a little wait.

Once in the restaurant, we found it to be clean and the service was spot on.  We ordered quickly.  Here is what we decided on:

Red velvet pancakes
German chocolate pancakes
Lemon Ricotta crepe like pancakes
Orange Creamsicle pancakes
Bacon pancakes
Biscuits and Gravy with sunny side up eggs and hashbrowns
Mexican Omelette
Egg White Omelette

The menu is full of great sounding cupcake flavored pancakes, as well as traditional favorites.  They even have Hawaiian specialties with pulled pork and spam. If the other dishes are anything close to what we ordered, you can't go wrong.  Every single dish was delicious.  We all shared what we ordered and all any of us could say was, ""WOW!""  Personally, I thought the red velvet pancakes were the best, but it was so close to call that there really was no clear winner.

I have never raved about breakfast before.  But I just had to write about this place. BabyStacks Cafe is by far the best breakfast I have ever had. Here is the kicker...the total cost for all 4 of us was $70!  We all ate until we were stuffed and every bite was wonderful.  I guarantee that you can't find anything like this on the strip.  I would suggest that if you are on the strip and you don't have a car, Uber, Lyft, or cab-ride it to this restaurant.  You will be happy you did!",cgvfNSTOnz2-cgg56ZXuCA,0,0,5,cW_0Zn8ZCUDPYPh8GrL2LQ

And then the FOOD happened, & it was all over:

Steak & Eggs - I chose their oniony, garlicky garlic fried rice instead of potatoes - SO GOOD with my poached & runny eggs.  The steak was perfectly rare, & my side of hollandaise made me happy.  AND - I upgraded the plain pancakes that came with to:

Red Velvet pancakes - not the best textured pancake bc it was a little on the dry or overdone side, but the chocolate shavings & fresh whipped cream & cream cheese-y syrup that came with it made each bite yummy!  The small stacks are two small pancakes, which are the perfect size to try them yet not stuff yourself silly.

Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs - I had a bite of this & it was damn good!  The crispy battered steak & the gravy were really good.  Hash browns were kindof basic, but the upgrade to these were SO good:

Banana Cream Pie pancakes - another short stack of two perfectly textured, light & fluffy little pancakes, topped with vanilla pudding, sliced fresh bananas, & fresh whipped cream.  These were THE BEST!! 

Their selection of unique kalua pork menu items (grilled cheese & benedict) as well as fried rice rolled into an omelette make me wonder why these guys don't come to LA!!

The famed red velvet pancakes are literally a flattened red velvet cake with whipped cream AND cream cheese syrup. Sugar with sugar on top of sugar. On my quest to give myself type II diabetes, this certainly could do the trick.

I could definitely see myself coming back here, but maybe for some more savory fare. I felt sick to my stomach after eating about half the short stack.

We came around 1 in the afternoon, so we avoided the typical breakfast/brunch/lunch rush hours. We were seated immediately and received good service throughout. Nothing super, but solid.

As soon as I looked at the variety of pancakes on the menu and on the specials board, I got excited. So many choices! I ended up going with an omelette with chili verde on it to go with 2 peanut butter and banana pancakes. The omelette itself was OK; it had all the elements of an omelette, but wasn't particularly fluffy. It was solid. The pancakes, though, were great! I am a sucker for both peanut butter and bananas, so maybe it wasn't that hard to impress me, but nonetheless, they were delicious. I also tried my friend's pancakes banana foster, which were one of the daily specials. He had ordered a large stack of pancakes (6 pancakes) and was overwhelmed by what came out. Those pancakes were pretty tasty and were pretty much like dessert.

What really interested me when I went to the restroom was the spam sandwich on a sweet roll that I saw in a newspaper review of BabyStacks. I'll be coming back, and that will most likely be what I order.

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, with bacon pancakes.

The CFS had a good texture.  The gravy was good.  The eggs were a little underdone for ""Over Medium"", but that's up to interpretation.  But enough of this.  This is a pancake joint, so let's talk about those.  The bacon pancakes were very good.  They had bacon in them, and on them.  They were springy and resilient without being tough.  Not too soft or hard, but just about perfect.  They were flavorful, and very tasty.  

The service was good.  The waitress pleasant.  Everything was pretty quick.  The cost was decent.  Were I a local, I'd probably come here often.

About the only thing that I can ding them on, and the reason this isn't a five star review, is that the coffee is not great.  It's on par with the other places I've been in Vegas, but not great.  I'm a coffee snob, and can't handle what tastes like something that came pre-ground in pre-measured bags.",GgI7kzf0r1FlioPqg8lCcQ,0,0,4,WGseuxdDRvDxGTLTP1O2gA

This location is a bit bigger than the original, but of course all the food especially the pancakes still taste the same. I've been here on 2 visits and my most recent I ordered something other than my usual selections of kalua pig benedict and red velvet pancakes. They had a dry erase board with new menu selections and it had things like kalua pig grilled cheese and breakfast sliders. Both sounded delish, but after reading the description of the breakfast sliders it seemed like it was something I could make on my own making me choose the kalua pig grilled cheese! Loved every bite of it because it had a good amount of pork in there and meshed well with all the cheesey goodness. I've heard from friends and from my own personal experience that the other pancake options cannot compare to the red velvet, does anyone know of another pancake they offer that is just as spectacular?

Some of the things I usually get is the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage or the Adobo friend rice, both tasty and winning dishes. Service is quick and they will continue to come by and refill your coffee or water without having to ask or search around for assistance.

The location at Smoke Ranch is by far the best, but that being said it's almost always packed with people and there's a wait. If you go to the other by Flamingo, it's MUCH less crowded. They have one other location and I also heard a Henderson location is on the way.

Rick's Adobo Fried Rice -- Shredded chicken with rice wrapped inside an egg and green onions. Simply incredible. The saltiness of the chicken was just right.

3992121,2014-11-27,1,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"On Thanksgiving morning, my husband and I wanted to enjoy a nice quiet meal before joining his family this afternoon for the Thxgvn festivities. As an out of towner, we relied on Yelp to find a decent breakfast place and avoid the typical gross joints such as IHOP or Denny's.  With limited holiday option, we decided to check out BabyStacks Cafe.

I been to the first location years ago and was pleased with it. I pleased to see they have done well to open a 2nd location.  Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and was seated immediately. This location certainly has more space, but it does not have the same 50's style I recall the first location had.  The menu is about the same and I noticed they are offering more ""Hawaiian"" style breakfast which I didn't remember they've had before.  No matter, they still have their famous pancakes.

My husband an I ordered the whole wheat french toast coated with corn flakes cereal.  My husband went with a BYO omelette with a side of Oreo cookie pancake.  When our order arrived, my french toast looked amazing.  They were so thick I decided it's best to eat it using my hand like a french toast bar.  However, my husbands BYO omelette looked less than appealing to me.  The side of hash browns looked dry as if it came out of a frozen package hashbrown.  The omelette is just uninteresting. The Oreo cookie pancake came shortly.  My husband thought it was ok.  It was essentially a chocolate cake not even a pancake with whipped cream; well....not a total lost, the whipped cream was tasty.   My French toast was really good. I also ordered a side of Portuguese sausage so I have a sweet and spicy combination.  It was a good call; the combination was very good.

Overall, I think the place is ok.  I think there are other places that offer a more well rounded offerings here in Las Vegas.",yfQCp22JJ2AnnGYIdu3JmQ,2,1,3,q4_CZgnhbzdUABJNA9obig

Service- No, just no.
Wait time- Not worth it...
 The first time I came here I was blown away by the Red Velvet Pancakes.
The second time I came here, I realized this place wasn't as amazing  as I originally thought, and considered it decent. 
After that, I tried to steer clear from here, but of course everytime someone wants to have brunch- they and their neighbors always want to meet up here, so I go, but not by choice.
Like I said- their food is decent, but the wait time is annoyingly long, and not worth  it for the service you get. Even after waiting 45 minutes for a table, the server took 10 minutes to take our order. She came back missing 4 out of 8 drinks, and gave us the wrong 4 when she came back...ok, maybe she was new or having a bad day, but with 3 servers and not that many tables, someone should've helped her out. Another 30 minutes later (no exaggeration here, I promise) she came out with our food. 
But wait-
The cream cheese syrup is what MAKES the Red Velvet Pancakes decent...no cream cheese syrup?! Guess what happens next? Oh right, I wait...AGAIN, this time for a HALF filled syrup cup!!! I ask, nicely, maybe she'll fill it up a little bit, since it's half full and I server says ,""it'll be another 75 cents extra.""
Okay- in my defense, I read that it would be extra for the syrup, but I just wanted her to fill up the syrup cup included with my pan-cakes-puh-lease!!!
 
What in the hell?!?!? 
I would've given this place 3 stars if it weren't for the extra hour and a half used in waiting for seating and food...and the syrup!!!",Z5gOO48vA86uz4fpLjzdyA,6,2,2,l3Zv-YM0ry9mmElOOEclxQ

it was a full house during breakfast/brunch time (weekend).  Be prepared to wait. 
When we left at about 2pm - there was no wait. 

Tip:  Look at menu & also the specials on the board while waiting. Then when you're seated..BAM - you're ready to order. Efficiency! Time is of the essence in Vegas :)

                                          THE SCOOP:

KAHLUA PORK EGGS BENEDICT:  pork was tender and seasoned well.  Not too salty, which is a PLUS in my book.  I asked for hollandaise sauce ON THE SIDE.  You might want to request this too.  B/c once you break the egg yolk it can get pretty rich & heavy.  And if your benedict is drenched in hollandaise sauce too...idk!  Can you say heartburn?  This dish was pretty good. 

PORTUGUESE SAUSAGE w/ garlic rice & eggs PLUS your choice pancakes (2 cakes).  This dish is simple, but AWESOME. The garlic rice is good & homey, but NOT ENOUGH (portion size is about 1/2 bowl of rice).  Us Asians like our rice. 
Sausage was tasty and plenty. 
As for the pancake - i ordered Banana cream Pie.  A bit bland and dull for me.  Like all some of the other reviews say - if you like Banana cream pie...you would like this. However, it was BLAH.  I even ordered CREAM CHEESE syrup on the side.  The syrup wasn't as good as I envisioned it to be.  Tasted more like a sugar glaze w/ a hint of cream cheese.  

ADOBO FRIED RICE: Egg omlette w/ pork adobo rice inside. Sounded pretty unique...had to get it (to go).  It was good, but nothing too special.  Meat was tender and well marinated. i would go w/ the Portuguese sausage combo dish rather than this. 

SERVICE: friendly waiter.  Food took a LONG time to come out. 

Overall, I liked the food and the wide selection on the menu.  I LOVE the idea of  Hawaiian/Filipino mixed with american breakfast.  What a great FUSION CONCEPT :)",loXavxKqdcIgrQeX1GSWUw,0,0,4,orcpgEF_9TEus14XCNNBxQ

There were many tasty sounding options and it took me a while to decide! It's cool to be able to order a skillet or omelet and have the side as a specialty pancake option. 

I chose the Piglet skillet: crunchy potatoes, good melted cheddar, eggs cooked as ordered, sausage, ham, and bacon. Pancake choice was rocky road short stack, which I didn't love (but it was still good) because the chocolate overpowered the almonds and marshmallows. 

The coffee was a basic weaker brew and the tea only green or black. So for a breakfast place, found myself wishing for better hot drink choices. 

Good friendly service was appreciated.

4030586,2016-04-01,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I went here with my cousin after she picked me up from the airport. She recommended it to me, as it is the original BabyStacks Cafe in Las Vegas.

I ordered their Banana Cream Pie pancakes and the Hawaiian-like combo order, which I don't remember the name of, that consisted of Spam, eggs cooked to order (I got my usual scrambled), white garlic rice and furikake (rice seasoning of Japan). The breakfast definitely reminded me of what I typically eat for breakfast, as I really love Spam! Spam was good, although I should have asked to have them cooked longer to brown them - my Spam was just cooked and hot (which isn't particularly bad). The rice could have been made better as it was more moist than I usually have white rice. The pancakes were really good, but the bananas weren't as fresh - soggy, brown was how they were presented to me. I think that the pancakes were definitely sweet enough to go with the banana cream pie part and didn't require any syrup of any kind.

I also tried my cousin's red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. It was VERY red in color (I don't think they should put that much color in there), but it turned out to taste really well and not have an artificial taste. Usually with a bright color, I associate that with artificial taste, but this was not the case for the pancakes.

Overall, I would definitely come back here again, so I can try all the other flavors of pancakes they have! The price per person was definitely matching the quality and portion of food!

As expected there was a wait but even though we were quoted about 45 minutes, it ended up being only a 25 minute wait! Service was great, it was hectic but the servers and hostesses kept their cool. Major props today since it was so busy because of the holiday. 

They have a wide selection to choose from on their menu. On the front, you have what you would expect from breakfast/brunch joints such as egg and meat entrees, omelettes, pancakes, and skillets. On the back, you have a variety of Asian-fusion choices. 

The portions are quite large and most entrees come with potatoes or toasts on the side. When you're trying this place out for the first time, definitely get the Red Velvet Pancakes because the hype is real for those suckers. They're so fluffy and tasty!

4053151,2013-03-04,9,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Nearly 7 months since my last visit to this specific BabyStacks. So, an updated review was in need. 

Whether you're local or visiting, you have to try Babystacks at least once.  My opinion, still one of the best breakfast joints in town.  You can still get your eggs, bacon, and hash browns at BabyStacks.  But let's be honest, it's all about their stacks.  You can't go wrong with most of their pancakes and it's their Red Velvet that they're known for. Other favorites for me include their Portuguese Sausage, Loco Moco (IKR?), Garlic Rice, Biscuits/Gravy, Macadamia Stack, and their Adobo Fried Rice. 

Regarding this specific location, I have to say it's the best one to go to if you're looking for less of a wait and a bigger location.  At this location, you're almost seated immediately.  However, I still think the North Buffalo location is better.  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just loyal, but I think the food taste just a tad better at the north location. But please, continue to go the south location so that I don't have to wait as long at the north one. 

TIP:  On my most recent visit, I did something that I never do. I got a full stack of their Red Velvet pancakes. A short stack is usually good enough, especially if you're just complimenting a main dish.  I don't believe in wasting food so I cleaned my plate. I don't think I ate for at least another 5 hours after.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,10,9,4,7nbCxTRsU6EllgVYPNuqtg

- long wait, average 30-45 minutes 
- place isn't fancy, just a small cafe 
- portion to price is favorable 
 
The meals at this place is influenced by Hawaiian, Filipino, and American items. We drove away from the strip to eat before we went to the Rise Festival - definitely had this place in mind because we were thinking ""big breakfast"" before spending hours in the Mojave dessert. It seems to be the local's favorites and outsiders (like myself) have come to take over and create longer lines. 

LOLA CORA'S CORNED BEEF HASH AND EGGS - served with your choice of the following: (2) buttermilk babystacks or toast and steamed rice or potatoes, and eggs of your choice. Upgrade to garlic rice $1, Upgrade to your favorite babystack (extra charge). I tried to upgrade to their special that had rick's adobo fried rice but was declined and therefore I settled for garlic fried rice. MUST upgrade the buttermilk babystacks to RED VELVET. The corned beef hash is house made, not greasy, and had a nice corn beef flavor without it being too salty. It's hard to write a review about cornbeef and garlic fried rice.

Next, well, it's a small cozy nook so I expect that parking is minimal.. It's located inside a commercial complex so parking is not bad.. We just had to circle around once to find a suitable parking for our truck.

Being that it is a cozy little nook, of course waiting area is a bit packed when we got in. Cashier is also right there by the door so you have people trying to get out and people trying to get in at the same area.. One plus, there are benches where you can sit while you and your party waits. My only biggest comment would be that, I wish the hostess would smile. She doesn't look happy at all.. All the while, there's a sign that says ""be nice or leave"".. Well, how do you expect people to be nice and friendly when your hostess does not acknowledge the guest at all let alone smile? Even after I said thank you after she sat us at our table.. Still no smile. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't rude or anything.. But just please smile!

Our server on the other hand, Jamie, is very friendly and accommodating. All smiles and cheerful! She made sure my drinker are re-filled all the time.. She's very attentive. Great service! Good job!

Now, my favorite part of the review.. FOOD! Being a chef, this is where I tend to focus on. We ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in omelet. That was bomb!!! So tasty and fluffy! Absolutely delicious! As a side for it, I ordered Rocky Road Pancake. That was good too! Our server suggested to get that instead of the s'mores pancake. I'm happy I did! Then, we also ordered the Kahlua Grilled Cheese Sandwich. My fiancé said it was really good but if only the portion is bigger for the price they sell it for. And lastly, I ordered Loco Moco. That was amazing! But it wasn't enough rice.. Lol. I had to order an additional side of rice. Now, the macaroni salad that came with it, it was a bit bland. Could use more mayo and salt & pepper.

This breakfast place is highly sort after by locals and people from afar. The menu is extensive pancakes that make your mouth water. I've had the pulled pork once before and thought it was great.

The weekends can be pretty packed full with lines out the door but it's to be expected. I'll put it simply, Babystacks is one of the top breakfast places in the valley, yeah it's busy busy place, but the reason is because it's great quality food with great service.

The seasoned chicken with mushroom, spinach and runny OM egg topped with my substitution of pepper jack cheese was a good choice.  It was on the high end of garlicness but that wasn't a negative.

You notice this as soon as you walk through the door, there was an inadequate area where people were supposed to sit and wait for tables but that section gets overrun with people within 5 minutes. They should have a designated host/hostess to seat guests. The second reason for only 4 stars is because we knew our server was busy but he didn't refill our drinks the entire time we were sitting there and he didn't great our table for approximately 7-10 minutes. It was busy and I understand that things get lost but I believe management should hire more servers for this venue.

The food is great! I ordered spam and eggs and everything was cooked to my liking. I ordered a side of hazelnut pancakes! Those were also excellent. Family of 4 was happy aside from the drink part.

We went to this BabyStacks because it was closer - menu and quality is the same. This time around, my boyfriend got the corned beef hash because he enjoyed it so much when I ordered it last time.

My boyfriend got red velvet with his order.

My Hawaiian chili loco moco was delicious, everything was perfectly seasoned. My hazelnut pancakes were a little dry, it wasn't dry enough to make them not taste good, but it kept crumbling every time I tried to pick it up with a fork. The red velvet pancakes were fluffy, the texture reminded me more of a cake than a pancake which made it great!

In this case, the corned beef hash is my go to. The corned beef hash is nothing to write home about I guess. It kind of looks like the stuff from the can so sometimes it doesn't look the most appetizing or appealing. The taste is hit or miss as are the potatoes. Of course the saving grace is always the pancakes which I definitely like the red velvet or the blueberry. The last couple of times I decided to just order to go, because it is easier with a toddler in tow and I really just wanted pancakes. The blueberry pancakes were good, but there were barely any blueberries. I do like that they put fresh blueberries on top, but the ratio of blueberries to batter should be a bit more than what I've seen lately.

Red velvet pancakes- 5 stars. I still drool thinking about this pancake, because it's like eating cake but in pancake form. The texture is more like a muffin cake rather than a chewy pancake, but it's SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD. For a sweet tooth like myself, this is heavenly. 

Adobo fried rice omelet - 4 stars. The flavoring inside with the rice and adobo is good. I think it could have been a bit saltier, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a fried rice rather than in an omelet since the egg outside dilutes the saltiness inside, making it a bit bland for my taste. I was confused if I'm supposed to put ketchup outside and eat it or should it have been tonkatsu sauce? Maybe that would be more genius. 

Side of portugese sausage- 4 stars. Who don't like sausage? OINK OINK. My belly does. I'm no Portuguese sausage connoisseur, but I love a fatty polska kielbasa and this sausage did the job. 

Some healthy bacon and all kinds of stuff omelet with avocado on top- 4 stars. I never order omelets at restaurants, because I can make a pretty legit version in my own kitchen. SO, I don't know what to say and how to rate this omelet. It was good, but not something I'd order.

Instead of seating us she said they could not seat us until ALL were there. Today is THANKS GIVING and the restaurant was half empty with NO LINE. Being in an industry that deals mainly with customer service I understand their are certain policies all companies have but there is COMMON SENSE when to bend the rules. 

For being a smaller cafe they sure can't afford to deny business especially for only being a local spot. They have 2 signs which were pretty negative from the get.

1. Be nice or leave
2. We can't sit incomplete parties.
(Which is understandable is they were BUSY)

Both signs just deny business. Morons!!!!",PKR1-xDFOdot2fIoDsvRsg,3,1,1,NFdd7mrSVuSwoU0ggE9ZlQ

The pancakes are delicious and creative, but a lot of places have delicious and creative pancakes. You will never show up here and not have to wait a minimum of 30 minutes for a table, so the sole reason that I suffer the wait is that it's the only place I can get garlic rice. And it's GOOD garlic rice. Today I joined a few friends for brunch. We met at 12:30, were seated around 1, and unfortunately got the table next to the window. And the air conditioning was apparently broken. It was 108 outside and at least 150 inside. At one point, Satan stopped by our table to ask how the food was. Ok, I may have hallucinated the Satan part, as I was in full on heat stroke. It was difficult to enjoy the meal with all the sweat that was dripping into it. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the employees back in the hot kitchen. In the Las Vegas summer, you have to put more effort into temperature control. If I'm waiting 30 minutes for a table, I expect you're bringing in enough revenue to invest in a couple fans at least.

They definitely serve hotcakes! Their pancakes are literally little mini hot cakes, and there are tons of choices. We had a hard time deciding, because there must be over 25 choices of pancakes! We went with carrot cake and German chocolate pancakes, upgraded onto our entrees. They were amazing, like you deconstructed a cake right out of the oven. (I'm definitely a dessert person, and proud of it!)

 The entrees were good as well. I had the Portuguese sausage & eggs, with chunk potatoes. Next time I would order the hashbrowns, to help soak up my eggs. The potatoes were ok, but not super exciting. Everything else was great. My friend ordered the cheddar, bacon, & avocado omelette, with hashbrowns, and ate every single bite of it. 

The place is very small, so I imagine it's a nightmare on weekends for wait times. We were there on Tuesday at 11am, so not bad at all. The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses in the small shopping center, so parking might be difficult at peak times also.

The prices were reasonable,  especially for such exotic choices. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I'm going to have to work my way through the menu. Chipping off a little bit at a time. Bucket list, try it all.",zIPDNcRNS6AjyO7NQ6yEig,20,18,5,FNP5FfTSKL0MZBpnUDiVcw

4387574,2013-04-08,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"The first time I tried this place, it was probably close to two years ago.  Back then I was expecting some amazing mouth watering experience since all I kept hearing about was Baby Stacks (baby cakes back in the day) and read a spread about it in the Seven Magazine. 

We had a party of 6 which i understand there was wait since the location is extremely small with only about 10 tables.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (corn tortillas layered with refried beans, seasoned diced chicken, cheese, two eggs, and covered with their homemade fresh salsa) thinking that it should be good though yes, i understand that the is place when raved about was on their pancakes.... When the food came out it was okay... I cant really say it was good because it really lacked a lot of flavor.  I had to pour a ton of hot sauce and salt on it to make it taste like anything!

My boyfriend ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict (Toasted English Muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke flavored pork, topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce).  His choice was so much better! The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, the pork was flavorful, the english muffin had the right amount of crunch that gave the dish an added texture! I ended up eating half of his dish cause it was so much better then mine!

Red Velvet Pancakes (topped with their fresh whipped cream and chocolate crumbles ans served with cream cheese syrup).  So this is supposedly what they are known for.  I THINK NOT! Yes, it tasted like red velvet cupcake but it also tasted like I was going end up diabetic.  The cream cheese syrup was the topper for me on spitting the piece out of my mouth.  I just couldnt swallow it because it tasted like it was only made out of powdered sugar... 

Today was my second time coming here.  We waited for 30 minutes which is okay since our party of 3 expected it on a Sunday.  During that time, I figured i'd look over the menu and make sure I'm careful this time and pick something that ends up being at least good.  

WRONG!  I decided to go for simple this time and ordered the Spam and Eggs with the Garlic Rice upgrade.  Spam was heated on the flat top and gave it a hard exterior which made it almost chewy and not what I want in spam.  The garlic rice had no flavor at all and I actually thought it was just plain rice and didnt give me the right order until I noticed a big chuck of onion at the bottom of my plate and I thought ""Oh i guess they did get the order right, but this doesnt taste like anything!""  

The buttermilk pancakes that came with the dish wasnt bad (which i'm glad cause I really hope nobody would be able to mess up regular pancakes especially a place known for their pancakes).  However the pancakes were cold... which is pretty strange since the plate it was on was a little bit warm.  Normally I would understand this if I left it on the table for a while but once the waiter put it down, I checked cause it looked cold.  

I think the only thing they got truely right on my order was my over easy eggs... 

My boyfriend ended up getting the Biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy wasnt too bad with the help of salt! The order comes with 3 small biscuits that are hard.  I take that back, only 2 were hard and the last one couldnt even be cut when you stabbed it with a fork.  Yes, he did try to do this and the fork amazing stayed completely vertical in the air.   When we asked if the biscuit were usually like this, the waiter said no but in that hesitated tone that made you think somebody knew but hoped the customers didnt noticed...

Everything they brought out for other tables looked great.  Seeing someone else get the home fry potatoes persuaded me to get them instead of hash browns and I almost always get hash browns if they are available.  

We also got the spinach benedict.  That looked the best to me and that with the potatoes was great.

We were curious about the Kalua Grilled Cheese (NO, it isn't alcoholic, weirdo!) and when asked if it was good, the waitress (who was really sweet) confirmed that it was really good and she had just recently tried it.  Done deal.

4399425,2015-11-09,1,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"First of all, the ambiance is nothing special. In a sort of run down strip mall and all the signs (on Xerox paper with highlighter) plastered all over their doors and hostess table are very off putting. The signs pretty much say one of two things: they will not seat parties until the entire party arrives and they will not split checks. I don't really have a problem with the first (lots of places only seat entire parties) it is more the way they convey the message. Just kind of rude/bossy. But the no splitting checks thing just baffles me. I can't remember the last time (ever?!) I've been to a place that won't do it. 

The menu is huge. So many different types of pancakes! Every flavor under the sun. They have savory items too, but really the pancake choices seem like what 9/10 people order. Normally I am not a huge sweet breakfast fan. I much prefer savory, but, when in Rome... 

So I got the short stack of Red Velvet pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. Definitely could qualify as dessert more than breakfast! The pancakes were very good! Fluffy and had a great red velvet flavor. Surprisingly, I enjoyed them more than I expected. I couldn't even finish the short stack though because they were pretty rich. 

Service was fine. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. 

I think just maybe classing up the way they convey their (kind of annoying) policies could bump them up to 4 stars for me. A little more polish could go a long way.",XplmuRZZetndMldSnpRncQ,2,2,3,FzWmCCuO0zu7SwbZYBeHEQ

Red Velvet Pancakes: 4/5 I'm not a big pancake person because I'm not much of a sweets person but my boyfriend is. He loved them! practically inhaled them. The velvet pancakes were very soft and fluffy and you could definitely taste the red velvet especially topping it with cream cheese icing. A little sweet for my taste but my boyfriend loved it. 

Bacon Spinach Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise sauce: 5/5 I've never had eggs Benedict but I was looking for something on their menu that consisted my favorite's for breakfast: eggs, cheese, spinach, bacon, sausage. Closes thing they had was the spinach eggs Benedict. I was iffy about the hollandaise sauce because its a buttery sauce but it complimented the Bacon Spinach Benedict perfectly. The hollandaise sauce kind of taste a bit cheesy to me.

We ordered the Kahluah Pig Benedict and the Chick Skillet with Red Velvet Pancakes. The service was good. The server was prompt and polite, always there to refill coffee.
The food came out quick enough, the portions weren't enormous like many breakfast places do. The Benedict was good enough, the pig was tender, cabbage just slightly crunchy. The poached egg was poached hard (Not runny) which I like a little more runny, but that's ok, and I could always go for more hollandaise! haha!
As I had seen mentioned in another post, the hashbrowns suck. They're a thin layer of potatoes crisped on the top side, mushy on the bottom. Meh.

The skillet sucked terribly. The ""chick"" aka, chicken, was in the form of 3 small pieces. VERY disappointing! (Mentioned it to the server, and it was taken care of, but besides the point) They did not skimp at all on the benedict, but the skillet was a wash.

The Red Velvet cakes were amazing. But then, who doesn't like eating birthday cake for breakfast? Because seriously, that's what it is. Sugary mess of yum.  And honestly, not impressed. I can nuke some birthday cake in the microwave and call it a day.

Probably the best pancakes I've ever had. There is a large selection of pancakes to choose from; red velvet, cookies and cream, orange creamsicle, and s'mores are just some of the many choices you have. If you want even more food (which I always surrender myself to), you can order the entrees that include the pancakes of your choice. I've had the adobo fried rice omelet (holy moly it's big), spam fried rice with garlic, and chili moco. Everything on the menu is so much like Hawaiian style food, so you definitely get Hawaiian vibes when you dine here. There are three locations, and I've been to all of them.

Some of the people looked like they didn't sleep at all with their dresses and New Year's eve hats!

  I needed to go to a Hawaiian breakfast place this time because what I was craving you would not find in your local IHOP. I decided to wait the 30 minutes even though I was super hungry.

I ordered the Kalbi (beef short rib) , upgraded to the garlic fried rice and an over easy egg. I like to mix the egg yolk in my rice. (Learned habit from childhood) . It was delicious and just what I needed!

 I figured while I was there I would also get a side of their Lemon Ricotta crepes. It may  sound weird but spritz them with some lemon and drizzle some of the white sugary topping and you are set! I haven't encountered any crepes like this anywhere else in Vegas so I made sure to have some since I don't come here all the time. I also had the white chocolate/ macadamia nut pancakes . You can upgrade from a buttermilk pancake to one of their specialty cakes for a small price.

4512855,2012-04-21,9,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Las Vegas Yelpers, you guys rock for sharing about a great place like Babystacks!

We're from the SF Bay Area and we've had a few visits to Las Vegas the past year.  We're so over the usual stuff and just wanted to find a good breakfast that wasn't on the strip.  We Yelpers know that some of the best food can be found off the beaten path, right?  So my trusty Yelp App not only roped me in with an eye catching menu that had pancake choices like Smores, Banana Creme Pie, Red Velvet (cue eye pop here) but it also told me that this place is about 15 minutes from our hotel.  Sweet!  Off we go in our rental.

Probably because we went on a weekday, we didn't experience a lengthy wait as mentioned in the other reviews.  During the 5 minutes we did have to hang out, I noticed the clean, casual & laid back surroundings with a bit of an island touch.  Cute butterflies everywhere.  I also saw the specials on the board and I knew I was in for a dilemma.  Almond Joy pancakes?  Orange creamsicle pancakes?  I asked for a menu to have an early look but by that time we were ready to be seated.

I got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  It only comes in one size, and the order was HUGE.  The cream cheese syrup made each bite delightfully sweet and really went with the lemony, fluffy pancake. My leftovers: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RIYUD4i-_sPDH597B92DXg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg

The huzbeau ordered the Kalua Pork Eggs Benedict.  I liked my pancakes, but I was coveting his plate the whole time.  The pork was tender and nicely salted with perfectly poached eggs.  I've never had this rendition of Eggs Benedict before and its a work of genius!  If it were me though, I'd throw in some spam in there (which I did order on the side; comes with two slices).  Note to self for the next time.  And I'm definitely getting my own. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wgy9HFmRWyhY8IupO76RHw&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg

The Keikis enjoyed a short stack of Almond Joy pancakes (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RziSeEnGuGZ-SfEMFhZXrg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg) and the combo meal that came with bacon, hash browns, eggs and a red velvet baby stack (no picture, sorry...my little girl inhaled it).  

Everything was delicious.  We may have ventured off the strip, but we made our own smorgasbord here.  Service was sufficiently friendly and there is plenty of parking.  We will definitely be back when we visit this area again!",6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg,11,8,4,C3oX1gAXDTYncUMcQ9-_Bg

We first ate here on a Saturday morning, and almost turned away because of the wait, but I'm sure glad that we stuck around for the 15 minutes, because it was well worth it. While their seating area is small, and crowded in some places, the overall feel is great, and the attention to customer needs in flawless.

The big pull factor for me is their food. I've been there three times, and each time I've gotten different flavors of pancakes. I've always gone with their Mexican Skillet, which is tasty, salty, a little spicy with some fresh Jalapeños, and the perfect portion. I like that they offer the option to upgrade all the buttermilk pancakes that come with a breakfast to the ""premium flavors"". I've had the red velvet, orange creamsicle, pumpkin, s'mores, and carrot cake. (I go with my wife, we each get a different one and share). They are so good, I could order these for desert after a meal!

I'm a local girl that is used to making the rice plates at home, so thats my take away from my rating.  I've seen how small their omelets are and giggled to myself.  If they know people from the islands, that's a pupu size portion.  Pupu as in appetizer.

Their carrot cake pancakes, bomb.  I can never make up my mind between having eggs or pancakes, so I go for the combo.  I do the Portuguese sausage, or cornbeef hash, eggs, and garlic rice with an upgrade of carrot cake pancakes.  

I've tried the Kalua Benedict.  Eeeeeh, its okay.  I say that because if you have had Cinnamon's in Kailua, its hard to get that anywhere else.  My Kalua Pig always seems to be dry.  Like its been sitting under the heat for too long.  

Like most breakfast joints, this place gets very busy.  So if you do come with a large group, you will find yourself waiting for awhile.  Same like the bathroom, there is only one.

They offer Filipino and Hawaiian style breakfast and lunch specialties, along with American breakfast classics. They are also known for their Red Velvet Pancakes and Adobo Fried Rice. 

I went in for breakfast and I had the eggs with Portuguese sausage and home fries. The sausage was well cooked, the fries were crispy with a good  amount of seasoning, and my eggs were cooked perfectly to my specifications of over easy. 

My special came with butter milk pancakes or the option to upgrade to a specialty pancake. I decided to indulge and went for the lemon ricotta crepe style pancakes. Oh my...so darn good!! They were served with a lemon glaze syrup sauce and dusted with powdered sugar. Perfect size, not too sweet and the lemon glaze had a nice tang to it.

People really like Babystacks, though.  Business seems good here.  The room was full.

The Red Velvet short stack was comprised of three extremely red pancakes.  Rather heavy-handed in the food colouring, even for RV.  Cream cheese syrup goes very nicely with them.  The combo tastes exactly like a Red Velvet Cake.

It was pretty good, light and fluffy... if a bit on the dry side for a pancake.  I prefer hotcakes with more butter or moisture in them.  Babystacks offers interesting variety of pancake flavours, including Carrot Cake.

Loco Moco was tasty.  Poached eggs, cooked medium, were still runny enough over the meat patty and scoops of rice.

- Red Velvet Pancakes: Now this, this is what a lot of people like to come for, so I had to try it. It really is a delicious stack. The ratio of whipped cream, to pancake, to cream cheese syrup is the key to the perfect bite of this dish! I do have a comment on it's consistency though. I prefer pancakes that are fluffy and melt in your mouth. These pancakes have a little bit of a chew to it but not enough to be drastically inedible. In fact, my peers didn't even notice. Otherwise, this alone is a great reason to come to BabyStacks!

Props to the owner for including creative Filipino touches to the menu. The chicken adobo fried rice and garlic rice option for breakfast specials (Sinangag in Filipino) made me and my galpal feel right at home! 

I honestly can't believe we waited this long before hitting Babystacks. It's an all-rounder, service and food were both wins! And even better, the lines weren't hauntingly tedious like we dreaded them to be. Took us less than 5 minutes to be seated but don't buy our case as fact. I have a feeling that certain days will be busier than others, seeing as people come in families, not just in pairs/singles. 

Due to unavailable table seating (yep, they had to re-arrange tables to accommodate parties of 4-6), we were led to the bar where we tuned in to the morning news. I don't remember us waiting long before we ordered. We were pretty ready to rock & roll and devour! Servings are pretty decent (I'd say large for us, Asians) and we shared the Corned Beef Hash with Sunny Side up Eggs, wheat bread and the savory, buttery Garlic Rice, also known as Sinangag in Filipino. 

On top of that, we figured it would be a waste to not try one of their specialty pancakes. As Hazlenut/Nutella lovers, we debated whether to get the Hazlenut pancakes or the more well-known Red Velvet stack. We ended up with the former and beamed as they got to our counter drizzled with nutella, crushed almonds and whipped cream. Holy moly, were they pretty - and I don't know if you could use this word for pancakes - chunky! A whole spoonful would take a while to chew on and swallow without the help of a drink.

The spot off of Smoke Ranch and Buffalo is a little smaller than the one on Flamingo and Buffalo but the food is absolutely the same. I love this take on Hawaiin and Breakfast Food, definitely something different and the pancake variety is crazy good. I personally do not care for pancakes but here, they are irresistable, super moist and fluffy and pretty much any topping you could wish for. One of my favorite dishes tho is the spam omellete, omg... I really don't understand what spam is, nor do I want to, but fried... it is one of the most amazing meats(?) ever!! I love the little sesame & seawood stuff they sprinkle on the rice, what a unique breakfast.

I got a skillet, husband got a benedict, neither one of us got pancakes since we try to eat low-carb these days.  The portion size was just adequate for me, husband left hungry.  I felt like the plating was designed to hide how little meat was on your plate.  The coffee was not bad, but I noticed they are quicker to refill at first than later, they pretty clearly were trying to get people to finish eating and leave quickly.  Even though there were empty tables around as we were eating, and nowhere near closing time.  That, along with the spartan, crammed-in atmosphere, tacky signs, and lack of warmth, is a bit off-putting.  I would probably come here again, since the food wasn't bad, but there are so many decent cheap breakfast places around the neighborhood that I might never bother.

I ordered the Mexican omelette, minus the carnitas, which you can do if you don't eat meat or don't like an ingredient in their put together omelettes. My bf ordered the breakfast burrito, once again without the meat. The Mexican omelette was a 7/10, which is pretty decent on my scale. I'm the spicy type of person, and so I had to soak my eggs in Valentino (which they provide, yippee!). The Bf definitely enjoyed his breakfast burrito, which came with a side of potatoes as well (seasoned or hashbrowns)...but I think he liked the Mexican omelette more too!  

The omelet also comes with a side of potatoes and 2 babystacks, so it's like getting a WHOLE meal and more.

I will say though that the times I have gone with a group, more specifically - my daughter in a wheelchair - the service was great.  I am so appreciative of their wanting to ensure her comfort level & actually acknowledging her existence vs. giving strange looks & talking to me about her in front of her (happens at other restaurants all the time).  The servers are wonderful. Seriously.

As for the food - oh.em.gee.  I have sampled almost every pancake flavor they have & I can't think of a single negative thing to say.  The friends & family I have taken with me who have tried other dishes were just as satisfied by what they had.  

The prices are great, the food is amazing, the service is great...the wait sucks but hey, at least they're busy enough to stay open so I can keep going back!

Chicken adobo fried rice is like an omelette with rice inside. Srircha makes it taste amazing. - 4 stars.
The loco moco was more like a 2 star dish for me. The meat tasted old, like it had a stink to it, like dirty fridge stink. The meat was also pretty pink on the inside. Not bleeding red, but I don't really like my ground beef on the medium rare side. It definitely set me off and I had to force myself to finish what I had.

Service - 2 stars. 
The service here was lackluster. We (party of 9) came the day after Christmas and boy did we come at the wrong time. They weren't necessarily busy, but we did have to wait a bit. A party of about 20 went in just before us and it was a HORRIBLE idea to stay after that. The host said he'd separate us, which we didn't mind because we already waited about 30 minutes and our party sat on opposite sides of the restaurant, again no problem. But here's the kicker. The party of 20 that came in before us wiped out the kitchen service as there were only TWO cooks that day. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and by the time the food came, everyone was extremely upset. Our server DID notify us 25 minutes into the wait that they were short on staff in the kitchen. But he never checked on us before or after that notification. We should've left after that, but since we saw the food coming out for the party of 20, we waited. Still, we waited a LONG time after. No compensation made for being there for almost 3 hours. 3 precious day after shopping hours.

Some friends of ours decided to take us to ""Babystacks"" before we departed LV Sunday afternoon, I'm so glad they did! I've actually NEVER heard of Babystacks till that day but now I might actually make a pit stop whenever I'm in town! Babystacks as you've probably guessed is primarily known for their variety of pancake options.. I'm not much of a pancake fan so I opted for one of their signature dishes ""Chili Loco Moco"" along with a side of small order of macadamia nut pancakes to try. A friend of ours is an LV local and she suggested we order the Chilo Loco Moco with the adobe fried rice substitute so we can try 2 signature dishes into 1. Hence, our order was ""Can we have the chili loco moco but instead substitute the regular rice with adobe fried rice, hold on the onions, replace the burger patty with kalua pork, and also upgrade the side to a macadamia nut pancake?"" The waitress (so sorry I didn't catch your name) looked at me in shock and said ""Hold on, let me see if we can do that for you"" and came back 10 seconds later with a thumbs up! I was so happy they were able to accommodate to our complicated order LOL. 

It took awhile for our food to come (25 minutes or so), my assumption is because of our complicated order haha. When our food finally arrived, I was surprised to see the GENEROUS portions! As in, the food was falling off the plate because it was THAT MUCH! I'm so glad we sub'ed the regular rice with adobe fried rice because it definitely added some texture/flavor. I'm also a sauce person and the loco moco gravy was heavenly. The kalua pork was perfectly shredded and flavorful, at a heaping generous portion as well. Subbing the side dish with the macadamia nut pancake is highly recommended because we were able to try what the pancakes are all about! It was a bit overcooked (stale and dry) but otherwise sweet and delicious. Even with both my boyfriend and I sharing, was more than enough because we still had left overs to go! I'm so glad we were able to try Babystacks because I will definitely be back!

I ordered the spam, eggs, and potatoes with pancakes. And of course I upgraded those bad boys to the banana cream pancakes. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I wasn't able to finish.

The banana cream pancakes was so rich and like a dream you don't want to end. It tasted just like pie, with a buttermilk pancake crust. Sooo good, and worth trying. 

My wife ordered the shredded pork and rice omelette with a short stack of rocky road pancakes. She loved it and couldn't finish her meal as well. Had some bites and I must say what we both ordered was flavorful and a good filling breakfast.

We had actually planned on going to the donut shop next door, but their selections was lackluster to say the least.   The restaurant was PACKED when we got in there.  Every table except one two seater was full.  It was too crowded to easily walk through, but in had a pleasant vibe.  It must be said I DO NOT like pancakes.  My husband ordered cinnabon pancakes and I ordered pumpkin pancakes with a side of homefries.  Ordering was a challenge as the employees were standing in front of the specials board and we couldn't read it.  Breakfast came out in a timely manner.  The pancakes were smaller than I expected for the price.  The syrups that came out were also very small.  We bother requested regular syrup on the side.  The white icing style syrup that came with mine was AWESOME and the highlight of the trip.  My husband was disappointed with his meal bc the pancakes were too small and stacked poorly on the plate so the syrup ran off the side.  The homefries were good, similar in flavor to the Egg and I.

I had the Orange Dreamsicle Pancakes, which were actual orange flavored, and just lightly sweet. The cream cheese syrup and fluffy homemade whipped cream made them a real treat, and rounded out the flavors. I got a side of bacon that was crispy, flavorful, and perfect, and a nice bottomless cup of coffee, as brunch requires.

My mom had the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes, and from the taste we swapped, they were amazing. My dad had the Strawberry, and would not take a break from inhaling them to answer any questions. He also refused to share. High praise indeed.

Our first visit was at the Henderson location and from what we remember it was exceptional. Coming from there we expect everything to be the same. The dining area is clean and dare I say hip? The staff is friendly and accommodate to their customers and that's always important to us as patrons. The wait time for us was quick although we arrived 1hr before closing so we caught the tail end of people leaving.  

We ordered the usual breakfast items with the exception of the abobo omelette which I'm sorry but Aloha kitchen is far better. It was rather small and the taste wasn't anything to write home about. I think the biggest disappointment was the original pancake and that was a big surprise considering they are called baby stacks. It was super dry dispite having butter and being drenched in syrup. I literally couldn't swallow it and end up spitting it out which was the 1st time ever! Congratulations on becoming the worst pancake I have ever had in my 40 years of life. They did remake it and it was a little better but I now know I truly dislike pancakes that are cake like. On the flip side we also had the red velvet pancakes which was more palatable and pleasant to eat, I'm guessing it's because red velvet was originally meant to be a cake.

I decided to try this place with a few of my girlfriends on a Sunday morning. I ordered the steak & eggs with hash browns and upgraded my original pancakes to the red velvet pancakes. Two of my friends got the red velvet pancakes as well. We absolutely loved them! They are soo delicious. They're the perfect combination of a bit of chocolatey flavor & cream cheese. They were also very fluffy and light, but the edges had a little crispiness to them which was good.

The hash browns and eggs were yummy as well. The steak, however, wasn't all that. It had a very charred taste to it. I ordered it medium rare and there was very little pink to it. It was also very tough and hard to chew. I could have done without the steak.

The ambiance of the place was nice. It was very clean. I don't think they turn on the A/C though, which I didn't mind much but my friends did. They had ceiling fans running but I guess with that many people in one place, it tends to get a little warm. 

We waited for about 20 minutes to get a table because it was so busy, this isn't a bad thing.. just shows how good this place is. Our server was very nice and friendly.

This is literally the best breakfast I've ever had IN MY LIFE.

It was so good that I am going back weeks later to review it, because it was seriously THAT AMAZING.

ZOMGGGGG ALL CAPS BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO VEGAS AND DON'T GO THEN YOUR LIFE WILL BE WORSE AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW.

All right, so the food. I am a huge eggs benedict fan, so after reading the great reviews, I went with the kalua pork eggs benedict. Wow!!! It certainly did not disappoint. Smoky and savory and melt-in-your-mouth tender - mind-blowing. I was torn between wanting to savor it slowly and wanting to shove it all in mah belly at once. My boyfriend had the adobo fried rice, and the second he took the first bite, he had to close his eyes just to take it all in. I tried it too, and I don't even like rice, but I almost wanted to trade mine for his. Almost.

But, the best part of the meal was the pancakes.

We shared an order of Butterfinger pancakes. Let me repeat - BUTTERFINGER freaking PANCAKES. The lady asked if we wanted them made with peanut butter batter and we said yes... best decision ever. They came warm and awesome with candy shavings and a huge scoop of really thick and amazing whipped cream. I'm telling you guys, the noises we were making while eating were downright indecent. 

I wish I could paint you all a better picture of just how incredible this food was. Mostly I just want everyone to go there so they can get lots and lots of business and expand to SoCal, because I have been craving it ever since. Yes, it's off the strip. Get over it. It's beyond worth it.

If I were to take off stars, it would basically be because no breakfast can compare and now that I know food this good exists I will forever be a spoiled brat saying, ""Well, it's good, but it's no BabyStacks...""

If they weren't so small they may not have the rule of not seating until your whole party is there. I knocked off a star for that.
 The crepes are delicious. They have made me a Nutella fan. I have fought for years against it. Then I tried it with strawberries, and then bananas. Both set it off nicely.
 The rest of the menu is varied with some specialty dishes I've never seen. Everyone raves about them, I've had some bites. They are very good, but I'd have to give up a crepe for them, so a bite or two do me just fine.
 If you get there before nine there's no wait. After nine you will wait 15 to 20 min.

We went for brunch on Friday at around 11:30 AM.  There were a group of 6 before us but other than that, not much of a wait.  We got our seats within 10 minutes.  Love that they had Hawaii-an food selection.  i ordered the kalua pig omelette while one bff got a crepe and the other bff (who i'm mad at), got the red velvet panackes. 

The crepe, was just a crepe.  But the pancakes were warm and delicious and so much like a red velvet cupcake.  A perfect accompaniment to my slightly salty kalua pig.

The kalua pig was perfectly salted and made me miss home just a bit.  The portion was generous; if I were going home after brunch, I'd save some to eat for later.  But I wasn't so I went ahead and ate most of it.  My crepe-bff ate what I couldn't finish.

I can't wait to come back to Vegas for this place!  Slots/gambling/clubbing, I'm not such a huge fan.  But this place, is worth flying back for.",L0-264Troy7Pcv2my5eBFw,1,0,5,4zAiyUx4fDHM_juR_cutmA

Hawaiian, and Filipino cuisine. Extremely good comfort food. I got the banana foster pancakes, loco moco with Kalua pork and garlic rice.

Very extensive menu of pancakes and brunch style food. Good for a night of drunken adventures (for sure hungover when I ate here, and it GAVE ME LIFE)!",94fRqjj6_366A4Hkt2UO-Q,0,0,5,6hlbysvYlZ-KeeI0Px5z_A
5042194,2012-03-19,3,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I have never heard soo many great reviews as I have heard about this place.  When I got a text from my friend last night before that they were going to Babystacks for brunch, I jumped on the moment to tag along.  Boy am I glad I did!

***Please be advised that you may have to wait a while before you get a table.  The hostess advised me that it could be upwards of up to 45 minutes.  We ended up waiting a little over 30 minutes.

Speaking of the hostess, I would like to share the only reason why this place got 4 stars for me.  This morning, there was a young girl in the front, taking everyone's name for the list.  She was definitely not as pleasant as I hoped for.  Maybe it just wasn't her day.  She showed a lot of irritation and no patience for anyone in front of her.  When it was time to pay, I noticed a jar that said, ""Tip for hostess,"" and realized why there was only a SINGLE dollar in there...

Ok, I'm done with my negative rant.  I want to talk about the AH-MAZE-ING food known as Babystacks!  Here's what me and my friends got:

Spam and Eggs for $8.25- It came with 3 slices of fried spam, eggs the way you like it (I got it scrambled) and either potatoes, hash browns, garlic rice for an extra charge and pancakes (any kinds of specialty pancakes for an up charge as well).  I chose the garlic rice and the bacon pancakes to get a versatile meal.  The rice was regular white rice with some kind of garlic infused oil drizzle over it with onions.  The only suggestion we had was maybe having caramelized onions in the future, but the rice was good.  The eggs were eggs and so was the spam.  Here's where this dish blows your minds...WHEN YOU COMBINED THOSE FLAVORS IN ONE BITE! That combination in one bite just made this dish worth it for me.  The pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with strips of bacon in the batter.  I really love eating breakfast meat with maple syrup so having that bacon in the pancakes made it AMAZEBALLS for me!!

Kalua Pig Benedict for $9.75- Now this is the dish that will keep me coming back!!  Let's start with the most flavorful seasoned potatoes cut into small cubes.  Then my friends, then there's the main attraction!  Toasted English Muffin, layered with a smoked Kalua (shredded) pig with cabbage, a medium poached egg and topped with hollandaise sauce.  I can't tell you how AH-MAZE-ING this dish is.  You'll just have to try it yourself.  Just know that the pork is super juicy and smokey, the English muffin is toasted by still soft, the egg is perfectly poached and the hollandaise is...well, let's just say that I'm going to dream about that sauce for months to come.

My friend had the short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes for $5.75- Start with 3 red velvet pancakes, topped with chocolate chunks and whipped cream and served with a cream cheese syrup.  I had the opportunity to try this and boy was it good!!  Super moist, super flavorful and such a great concept/reality!  I will be ordering a full stack the next time.

My other friend got the Portuguese sausage and eggs for $8.95- He had his eggs over easy, got the hashbrowns and chose the banana cream pie pancakes for an extra charge.  The Portuguese sausage is very familiar to me, being from Hawaii and it looked like the eggs were perfectly cooked.  Although I didn't try his meal, I know he was very satisfied by it, especially the banana cream pie pancakes.  His pancakes had bananas in the batter and as a topping.  These pancakes also came with sliced almonds, whipped cream, crushed pie crust and drizzled with a banana cream sauce.  

The place is small.  Super small.  There's a t.v. in the joint, contains bar top seating and a couple of butterflies as it's decor.  I'd consider this place a contender for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The food is that good!  If it wasn't for the hostess with the bad impression, this place would have gotten a 5 star.  Mark my words though.  The food itself will keep me coming back!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,5,3,4,wSQTFwCx-Ka8Cc3Wfc5k3A

5050089,2013-03-05,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"The wait was plain ridiculous at the original location so we decided to go to this secondary location where I called ahead and there was no wait and close to other errands we were doing. I don't like this temporary new earlier schedule of ours. Having breakfast at breakfast time really sucks with the wait times and dampens the mood.

We had zippys chili omelette on the specials white board. It's pretty decent and a bit different. I never really thought about chili on eggs, but it makes sense. 

I did a make your own skillet - potatoes with your choice of toppings (1 meat, 2 veggies, 1 cheese) and you can add additional toppings to the base price. I did carnitas, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese and asked for green sauce on the side. It was decent, but different from most skillets that seem cooked together, this is more thrown on top and put in the broiler to melt the cheese. 

We got our babystacks that come with our breakfast upgraded to their two new flavors on the white board. We did butterfinger which was rather nice and the butter finger pieces slightly melted were more peanutty in flavor and some parts crunchy. The creamsicle was decent, but I don't know if I'm just not a fan of orange flavored baked goods. 

Service was alright. It took a while for someone to come see us and order but once we did food came out pretty quickly . Server and host were both friendly. 

Yep. Same consistency of food as the original which is good. Sometimes it doesn't happen that way with new locations. Same food with possibly less of a wait!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,0,4,Dm5S6Zp6OFdvB9nQSLtD8g
5051091,2013-06-20,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I used to be a french toast girl, and then suddenly this affinity for pancakes showed up.  While in Vegas, we noticed a common theme, all of our best meals were off the strip, and Babystacks was not an exception.  The touristy thing would have been to stay on the strip for breakfast, but after seeing all of the pictures of red velvet pancakes, i couldn't resist.  I applaud Babystacks for providing a half and full stack option, there is nothing worse than feeling full and sad for wasting all of that food.  I ordered the half stack and i love how they embodied the essence of  red velvet cake.  They could have been lazy and served the pancakes with maple syrup, instead they came up with a genius way of incorporating the cream cheese element into a sauce.  When it arrived to the table i was unsure of the look of the sauce, but after tasting it, it was delicious, a wonderful accompaniment to the lightest pancakes. I also ordered a side of turkey bacon at it was fab.  
Overall, Babystacks is a very humble restaurant serving dynamite food, and i look forward to coming back and trying more pancakes on my next visit.",3UY0P5vAPTavFNTqqE2nVw,1,1,4,9u6GySW65RkrwyP_SilM1g

I had the short stack of their best selling red velvet, Ranchero chili chicken omelet w/hash. The pancake had a nice crisp on the outside w/a nice fluffy interior and very good chocolaty flavor. All the the whip cream and cream cheese  syrup complimented it very well. My wife had the baby chix skillet w/fresh veggies and a nice garlic flavor.

Pancakes were too heavy on the blueberries for my liking... can I have some pancake with my blueberries? The potatoes were very boring with little to no seasoning or flavor. I would think they would mix some more in there.. where's the chopped peppers and onions or something?? The eggs were eggs and the bacon was bacon.

Some of the other dishes I saw come out looked pretty good so I'll have to come back and try it. Maybe the red velvet pancakes are that good that I'm an idiot for not ordering them.

Service was fair from what I remember and I was happy that it didn't take as long to get seated as they quoted us. TV at the little bar area had on CNN which I thought was pretty strange. Who wants to watch that?",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,0,3,iikn9Ef5OxiESF083rLbow

The place was busy which was a good sign that the food was bomb diggity!  We didn't mind the wait because we were a party of 10 but the hostesses were just rude and didn't seem to care to be there.   She calls our name and not even a second later calls it again all annoyed like us having to pick up my nephews car seat was such an inconvenience to wait a second!

Our server didn't help the situation either.  He didn't introduce himself,  was getting irritated because 3 of the party of 10 wanted their pancake toppings on the side.  To top it off he goes ahead and decides to make it so that everyone gets their pancakes toppings on the side..  So we got the joy of having to spread Nutella on 4 kids orders of Nutella Pancakes and do the red velvet pancakes as well as.  If it wasn't for the food being so good this place would have gotten 1 star honestly.  Got checked on by the server once and never got out water refilled...

The food was delicious, but I definitely will not go back to this location.

Adobo Fried Rice (Adobo Omelette) was on point.  Perfect rice to adobo ratio and the egg was not to thin or thick just right.  (It was colder then I would like but it wasn't the cook who decided to mess up my kids orders.)

Kids Nutella and Red Velvet Pancake orders were both great but they might have just been bomb because we put the toppings on ourselves haha.  Naw seriously though the batter mix was good it wasn't overly fluffy or too thick it was perfect.

The place looks nice though so kudos for that but the food is a whole different story. Not worth the $40++ price tag most definitely. My husbands plate was so sad with the corned beef looking so unappetizing, taste was boring. My Portuguese sausage plate wasn't much better either, the egg was slimy and gross. The only saving grace was the garlic fried rice which was pretty good. I order the Lemon Ricotta pancakes on the side with the cream cheese syrup, normally that's my go to but for some odd reason that day it had a weird uncooked batter aftertaste to it. Service was ok, a little bit of a wait as can be expected given the place gets super busy. 

I'm rarely impressed with island style breakfast places and this just solidifies it.

I usually order breakfast with the cookies n cream pancakes, an Oreo type pancake which is so sweet it needs a side of insulin (that's not a joke). If you order them, get an iced tea, hot coffee, no sugar to offset the sweet. 

I had the chili moco which really was perfect for the time of day for me. It's hamburger, eggs, rice, ""Hawaiian"" style chile with onions. I upgraded to have the lemon ricotta crepes. It should come with two slices of lemon to give a nice kick with the icing. I had a glass of water as well. Felt like a perfect brunch. Delightful atmosphere with the bustle of a nice Monday morning. 

My boyfriend had iced tea, western skillet, ham, onion,bell pepper, with potato and two eggs over medium. Served with an indifferent salsa, nothing was special very mediocre. No spice. Nothing. 

That came with bananas foster pancakes. Bananas needed a bit more time cooking but was enjoyable. They don't need the whipped cream, already rich by themselves. But if you want a sugar rush, scratch that sugary itch, here ya go.

The many Hawaiian influenced plates are some of the best, though they are obviously well known for pancakes. I tried the Kalua Benedict with a short stack of banana cream panacakes. Pancakes were lovely and hit the spot. The benedict was tasty, larticularly with the smoked pulled pork. However, my hollandaise had the same typical taste and texture you would find at any cheap breakfast joint (as if it came out of a jar), and the poached eggs were overcooked. The yolk did not run at all which is a sin when serving benedict or even just poached eggs. It showed a lack of detail and commitment to the food they serve. It seems a shame as they clearly have some nice plates and flavors but without the execution you are only just slightly better than an ihop or dennys.

RED VELVET PANCAKES: Don't lie. You know of Babystacks because they're home to the red velvet pancakes. And red velvet is hipster. But that's ok, that's why I came here too. I'm not a lover of pancakes,  but I am a lover of these. They're tastier than regular pancakes and topped with a house-whipped whipped cream and chocolate chips. And who can complain about a cream cheese ""syrup""? Its painfully sweet, but in a good way. Order it alongside some savory items and you will have the perfect meal to please your palette. Get a full-stack if your hungry, short stack if you wanna nibble.

KAHLUA PIG BENEDICT: I love me some eggs benedict. And when its mixed up with some creativity I'm all for it. This was pretty good. Not great! But I was happy with how it tasted. The shredded pork and cabbage mixture could've used a little more flavor though. Spices are your friend Babycakes... Cheese and Egg yolk alone cannot flavor up a whole dish. I finished the leftovers the following morning. It tasted even better to-go once the flavors had settled and melded together!

VARIETY: The menu is quite large. All the usual breakfast combos and classics like loco moco are orderable. So many dishes look so delectable!

Kalua Pork eggs benedict-A little too saucy but the pork was on hit! tender and juicy.

I ate at the counter and had the spinach eggs Benedict - an eggs Benedict that uses bacon, spinach, sauteed mushrooms & onions. The spinach, mushrooms and onions were fresh and good quality. I was in the mood for eggs Benedict, but the last couple places I ordered it, they made it with some sort of ham instead of Canadian bacon, and I didn't want to risk that again (fool me once, shame on you...). I was also impressed by the perfectly poached egg - probably because that is a skill that continues to elude me. The coffee was fresh and had a good flavor, albeit a bit too weak for my liking.

The Hollandaise sauce was also fresh, plentiful and had a good consistency, but it wasn't seasoned properly. I couldn't taste any lemon in the sauce, which was disappointing, and I could tell that there wasn't any salt in it whatsoever. Perhaps this was to counterbalance the bacon (and I'm not a fan of oversalted food), but if you don't put any salt in it at all, it's not going to taste like anything. The low-point of the meal were these country potatoes. They were very dry and clearly frozen, and my mom's are much better. They do, however, give you several options for a side, and the obviously correct choice would have been the pancakes, which is what the restaurant is known for.

Overall, I was impressed by Babystacks Cafe. If I hadn't ordered coffee, the meal would have come out under $10, so it's definitely a good quality for the price. I'll certainly be coming back and next time, I'll order the pancakes as my side. Babystacks Cafe is worth the trip.",O0JPkrL9cBxx2u1Ka9iAXA,0,0,4,UejOX3Ub3XiZ8gaEuPcKEw

I'd heard great things about Baby Stacks, and I really liked the place.

It was pretty empty when we arrived, but quickly filled up as more reasonable people started waking up and coming out for breakfast.  

We ordered:
The veggie skillet:  2 eggs (I ordered mine over medium), cubed potato, spinach, peppers, onions, and tomato.  I upgraded my short stack to the hazelnut pancakes (instead of plain buttermilk) 
The country fried steak with hashbrowns and bacon pancakes. 

A word about portions:
Really smart here.  The skillet was the perfect size.  I was able to eat all of it, AND most of my pancakes without feeling stuffed, or overly full.

Fella's portion was a bit bigger, and he had a little trouble finishing all of his food, but he was a trooper. 

The food is REALLY good here.  
As with most breakfast places I've eaten at here, the food is NOT aggressively seasoned.  I had to add a bit of salt and pepper to my skillet.  Not a big deal.  I'd rather have to add some than have the food be too salty to eat. 
The eggs were PERFECT.  Firm whites, runny yolk...I'm drooling a little remembering how amazing it is.  

The hazelnut pancakes were great too..although they were a tiny bit dry,  but I find that most pancakes are unless I drown them in butter and syrup.  These were full of flavor though, and the dryness went away with the whipped cream. 

Fella's food was great too.  I tasted everything. ;)

all in all, it was a great visit!  The service was excellent, and they had reggae music playing, which is also a win for us.

My coworker and I sat at the bar to have some lunch. I asked the waiter if he could take our orders separately so we could pay separately. I was looking for a loophole in their ridiculous policy. He states that they cannot separate checks. I replied I understand that for the tables but we are sitting at the bar. He explained that we ""came in together"" therefore we could not pay separately. My coworker said ""Then what if we sat here and didn't know each other? Would we still have to pay together?""

The waiter begins to look around and under his breath he slyly tells us ""Well they are separate seats so I guess I can take your orders separately"". He took our orders and commented a couple more times about it.

I have no problem with the waiter. He was a nice guy and he was following policy. My problem is with management who apparently doesn't realize that a restaurant is a customer service based business.

Undoubtedly a place where kitsch finds prominence but where classics and good diner-service also stand strong it was admittedly with much debate that decisions were made on a menu where no less than a dozen sweet selections and numerous interesting savories plus specials reside but with coffee free flowing a plan was eventually hatched - two sweets, one savory, yes bacon, no potatoes, and much sharing after a short wait.  Beginning savory and progressing to sweet I must say things started shaky with a small plate of $4 bacon and surprisingly bland pork lost to buttery bread and cheese but progressing to ""dessert"" the story turned one-eighty, the thin pancakes fluffy and rich but brought in check by light citrus while the French Toast pulled on no reigns, a full display of decadence with supple egg bread surrounding a slathering of Speculoos and drizzled with Nutella plus a half cup of whipped cream...more than enough to share and impetus for a trip to Centennial Hills to visit Babystacks III soon.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,0,0,4,F_Vqu8zFAHEdekewis6OAA

Of course I love to support local and so coming here was a no brainer. 

Upon coming here we did take notice that they are known for their pancakes and their adobo fried rice. We order those in addition to the S'mores pancakes and their breakfast 2 egg special. 

The 2 egg special wasn't too special I thought. The potatoes as well as the toast  look and tasted like something you can get anywhere. 

The adobo fried rice in the egg wrap lacked a bit of salt but was quite good with a touch of hot sauce. Oh yeah, you know this place is Asian owned because they give you some choices of hot sauce in advance before you get your food.  It's tasty but I did wish the fried rice wasn't nearly as soggy. 

The S'mores pancakes are just regular pancakes with marshmallows, choco chips, and regular syrup. It was good but not excellent good. 

We also got the Kalua Pork benedict. The Kalua pork was juicy, smokey, and so good! I did wish the eggs were hotter and more runnier. I am picky about my benedicts but together, they were still really good. 

But the best thing we got undoubtedly was the red velvet pancakes. Slightly crisp on the outside with a dollop of cream and the cream cheese syrup on top. The syrup DOES make the pancakes come alive!

By the bathroom, it shows how the owner wanted to make cupcake flavors into pancakes. I have to say, she did a wonderful job transforming it. Babystacks are regarded as one of 50 US must try pancake locations. I totally would agree with this statement. They have locations in San Diego and Las Vegas. 

I thought the service was great overall. I did wish the hostess was friendlier and more outgoing. She seemed like she had a bad day and it was only morning.

So great breakfast choice when you don't wan to eat in a casino when coming here to Vegas as a tourist. Just make sure you come early because there will be a wait here!",GaTWkVy-pY6phZOqW6ykuw,2,1,4,M69Iu8tn8tDS0TGwI4ssPA

This is a super popular place for breakfast or brunch, and their targeted hours (closing at 2PM or 3PM everyday) make sure they are ALWAYS packed. If you come with a group, make sure you don't have any lagging friends, because they will only seat you when your entire party is present.

I tried the limited edition Chocolate Peppermint Pancakes, which were tasty for the first three bites then were too sweet. The pancakes themselves are chocolate, with peppermint pieces cooked into them. Good thing I only got a small stack! I did try the red velvet pancakes, but they just tasted like flat red velvet cupcakes, as expected. 

The wide variety of food at BabyStacks is a little overwhelming, but I guess you could say they have something for everyone. The service is decent (not outstanding) and it's just a hectic place to eat with all the crowds and TVs and bar area and AHH it can get crazy.

I couldn't decide, so much good stuff on paper.  I decided to go with what they're known for, Adobo Chicken Omlette!  Also a side of  Banana Fosters Pancakes... yum!!!!

Location:
Located in a shopping center about maybe 20 mins outside the strip is this hidden gem. A lot of parking. Small waiting area inside. Decent sized breakfast/brunch spot.

Only open til 2p w wait times I hear that can grow to almost 2 hrs. Luckily, I went here with my best-friend's older brother before the crowds and didn't have a wait! 

Food: 
Adobo fried rice omelet was very good! Not greasy like a lot of Filipino food. Rice, meat, and egg were all cooked perfectly. It really worked well. Who would've thought Adobo in an omelet?! We also ordered the White chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! This was a little overkill for me since I'm not a big pancake or sweets guy. If I remember correctly, I finished only half of the split dish.

Service:
No issues with the service. Great, attentive, and we were checked up on more than once. Greeted very warmly when we walked in and immediately were shown to our table.

Overall:
I'd come here again to try a different pancake dish that's not overkill on the sweets. The Adobo omelet itself is worth the trip back and dare I say, even worth a wait if you happen have one!",nkPkq59Wpa4K8O4GsF7HuQ,0,1,4,KEu1nvxilT8kR5owEjommQ

I had the banana cream pie pancakes and they really tasted like banana cream pie.  If you like banana cream pie, you will love these pancakes.  My friends had carrot cake, cinnabun and bacon pancakes.  They were all well received but the bacon pancakes had a complaint that they were lacking a bit in the bacon department.   I didn't not try them, but they did not look like they were super infused with bacon as they should be.

The only major complaint we had was service.  When we first arrived we asked if they had fresh brewed iced tea and the woman taking our drink order said no.  We saw a pitcher of what looked like iced tea sitting on the counter top.  We asked our waiter when he came to take our order and he said that was indeed iced tea.

Babystacks is know for its fluffy pancakes and its Island inspired breakfast items. Adobo Fried Rice. I don't know what this stuff is made out of, but it's so addictive (so probably crack)! On a previous visit, I overheard a guy ask for the rice as a side and the waitress said, of course. A big pile of fresh adobo fried rice arrived with his order.

On my last trip I asked for just a side of the rice and was denied. Being in a large group and not feeling particularly bratty, I let it slide as a friend said she'd take my eggs and I could have the filling. When the food arrived, the rice was delightful except for how crunchy it was. Starving and because the rice was so damn tasty, i plowed away. I was insatiable. To this day, I still find my self muttering Adobo Fried Rice in my sleep...

The rest of the menu is hit or miss, including the pancakes. Most are simply pancakes with dope toppings, but the pancakes aren't anything spectacular. The most delightful I've had were the Cookies N Creme pancakes. Diabettttus for breakfast, but heavenly.

I don't hate, Babystacks, but I don't love them either. Very middle of the road. It's a coin toss and the same can be said for your experience there as well.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,6,4,3,LdJO1CeMueL8vBP9e4_m6g

The loco moco, corned beef hash and garlic fried rice were good in their own respects but could be passed on. The adobo fried-rice/omelette on the other hand... delicious. Would love to see over easy eggs on top of the adobo fried rice as opposed to a solid scrambled/omelette piece.. in which I shall note for the next Vegas trip.

There are a few reasons for this:   1) My lactose intolerance limits a lot of the cheesy/milky items I would normally want to order, and I don't like starting my day with an angry tummy.   2) I usually don't have time (weekdays) or motivation (weekends) to really go anywhere to grab something.  On this Sunday, I had to drop off a friend who had a little too much to drink last night as well as a tux rental to Men's Wearhouse, and decided it seemed like a good day to try a breakfast place I'd heard a lot about.  You know, carpe diem and all that.

Upon walking into Babystacks, I wasn't surprised to see a large crowd sitting around waiting for a table, and we signed in and were told it'd be a 15-25 minute wait.  Quick sidenote: While we were seated near the door, my friend pointed out a black widow spider crawling along the floor that went underneath our bench.   I did the good Samaritan deed and promptly stood up and switched seats.  It looked harmless, really.  

Once seated I ordered an orange juice which I'd forgotten was so expensive when eating out.  I naturally ordered a full order of Red Velvet pancakes, because if I'm going to blow up my insides with lactose goodness, I'm going all the way.  A short time later I was presented with a beautiful plate of 6 huge, red pancakes with the fixings.  The first bite was heaven, and 15 minutes later, the last bite was heaven.  I can't really add anything that probably hasn't already been said about them.   The rumors are true, the hype is justified, the pancakes are freaking delicious.

Next time I would switch it up and probably just get a 1/2 order with some side order of something savory.  The couple next to us ordered some sort of skillet or plate with some lovely pieces of cooked animal flesh that were really disarming to me as I continuously shoved my mouth full of candy in pancake form.   Yes, next time I need bacon with my candy.

Service was fine, though it did take a little while for the waitress to take our order after we got our drinks.  Obviously it was packed so I was understanding of it, and once the food arrived, no complaints.  The prices are very reasonable.

They've got a couple of TV's inside which kept us entertained as Chippendales was on the morning news show that was playing ;)  Definitely worth checking out for a tasty breakfast!",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,0,0,4,v2bRzLigxfGXc-fZ_I1BZw

Babystacks is a cult favorite and I'm so glad my AirBnB was close enough to this place since I rarely ever make the drive off the strip if I'm always on it. 

* PARKING *
Located in a plaza with plenty of (unshaded) parking.

* WAIT TIMES *
On a Sunday brunch session, BabyStacks is certainly quite busy but none too much that we didn't get seated for longer than 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is rather small which is what largely amounts to the wait time but as I said, I went during peak hours and still got seated quickly.

* FOOD *

Strawberry & Nutella pancake stack: DELICIOUS!!! There were so many options that I wanted to try out but I'm so glad I ordered this because the pancakes were fluffy, the strawberries were a-plenty, the cream was soft, and the drizzled hazelnuts certainly made for a wonderful dining experience. 

Bacon eggs and cheese omelette: my boyfriend had this and quite enjoyed it as well. The omelette is cooked with the cheese melted over it and comes with an additional side (hash browns for him) and your choice of toast as well. Overall nothing spectacular but not a terrible choice either if you're looking to have this plate. 

* SERVICE *
Our server was sweet but doesn't seem to do her job very well when she's stacked with a full section. Our friend had ordered plain rice and she still managed to serve him garlic fried rice. Even after acknowledging the mistake, she still charged him for the garlic fried rice even though she said she wouldn't... Also, it took forever for us to receive our check so we didn't find it in our interest to argue our bill. 

* OVERALL *
I certainly enjoyed my meal here enough to warrant a second visit. And because babystacks is located off the strip, I know it won't ever get as busy and I can always pop in whenever I please. This is definitely a must for your visit in Vegas, so consider adding it to the bucket list!",HQnfONrTQKBdHPV7iebtxQ,11,11,5,1s7CD0qBNxhKrjqY1L_LxQ

The only thing that changed was the location. The food at Babystacks is so good that it haunts you in your dreams. It also causes memories of happy times spent eating to dance around in your brain. If you are not a foodie it will convert you into a foodie. I was already a foodie though. Today's line up consisted of 2 Loco Mocos, Baby Chick Omelette, Seasoned Potatoes, 2 Banana Foster Short stacks, and Butterscotch Short stack. Once again it was all a hit. I tried to deviate from the loco mock and was all set to order the Portuguese sausage and eggs but I couldn't sit back and watch my friend enjoy her loco moco. I needed my eggs coated in savory gravy. Seriously, next visit I am trying other stuff because it is all guaranteed to taste good anyway. I swear they have baby angels in the kitchen sprinkling little dashes of heaven on the plates. The baby chick omelette and butterscotch pancakes were great as was the seasoned potatoes. It is always good when a restaurant can add just the right amount of seasoning without making the food taste salty. Now you maybe wondering why 4 stars instead of 5...let me catch you up to speed. The service: 5. The food: 2375. The 4: a result of this location charging for every little thing and refusal to split checks. For the baby chick omelette, my friend asked for salsa and was told it would be an additional charge. The location yesterday did not charge and brought 2 different types for her to use. Even IHOP provides free salsa as does any other restaurant I can think of. Also, what is up with not splitting checks? People dine out all the time and split checks. Not everyone carries cash and these days mostly everyone has a card. Not allowing the option to split checks is an inconvenience. Alright I have said my 2 cents.

In conclusion, Babystacks is addicting. You have been warned.",TgMoYlTbvWJQpoJdbOeVbA,0,0,4,dg7IsbJMC44_cB0JqwT3YA

Babystacks has breakfast food down to a tee....I've tried both the adobo omelette and loco moco and I'm a fan of both!

[1] Loco Moco - upgraded to garlic rice topped with a beef burger patty, two eggs over-easy and covered in gravy. I'm a big fan of loco moco and get it any time I can. The garlic rice was a nice upgrade and the dark gravy was delicious.

[2] Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - adobo fried rice wrapped omelet style and garnished with green onions. This was in a special golden box on the menu and I had my doubts, it was good but a little dry, and not amazing IMO.

[3] Banana Cream Pie Baby Stack - bananas and buttermilk pancakes topped with whipped cream, sliced bananas, and banana cream sauce. Definitely a banana cream overload, but not overly sweet. 

[4] Red Velvet Baby Stack - red velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and a side of cream cheese syrup - this is a stack for all those sweet tooths out there, it's very sweet and the cream cheese syrup just adds to the decadence.

5599567,2013-03-18,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"If you are looking for a good breakfast joint that caters to carnivores and sweet toothed mammals alike...look no further than Baby Stacks.  I believe the original location is on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Although, the location that I frequent is the expansion branch on Buffalo and just south of Flaming-O.

Baby Stacks, to me, falls into that Island-Style breakfast category that you can find at Cinnamon's and Boots & Kimo's on the Windward side of Oahu, nestled in beautiful Kailua.  This style consists of the normal comfort breakfasts including spam or pocho sausages with rice and eggs your way in addition to loco mocos, an island favorite.  But specialty benedicts and an elaborate pancake menu is now a common theme in island breakfasts.

I usually get the kalua pork eggs benedict but opted for the grilled cheese kalua pork sandwich on special.  The sandwich was good, but more appealing to the eyeballs than the taste buds.  Also, I have this unquenchable appetite for Tabasco, sue me, and tend to douse my kalua pork and manapuas in it, I'm talking drowning...lol.  If it weren't for my spicy little friend, the meal could have been much worse.  A banana cream pie stack was added and by far my favorite aside from carrot cake pancakes so far.  The white chocolate mac nut is again more name than anything.  My lady went with the zesty chicken omelet and like most onomatopoeia, was exactly that...zesty.

The place is a hit, both locations, so be prepared to wait if you aren't there before the rush.  The place reminds me of home with smiles from local islanders, but, I know for a fact that a lot of mainlanders aren't big on it and the culture, so beware.  

Otherwise, decor and ambiance is good and staff is friendly and attentive.  The check out dude has a Filipino accent and a little rough around the edges, so bare with him.  Parking is plentiful and although, not quite on the level of Cinnamon's, the place is definitely worth a look.

The sad thing is that there is no seafood related items on the menu, such as lox and the the like.  I know breakfast is not synonymous with fish, but I came here on a Friday during lent, and my selections were limited.  I had to settle for a spinach omelet and a short stack, but it didn't quell the monsters in my tummy.

The best advice to Vegas on a budget is to eat off-Strip if you can. Not only does eating out become much more reasonable, you would be surprised of the variety of options. Considering that most locals avoid the Strip if at all possible, some of the real hidden gems can be found.

To a lot of locals, this restaurant is one of those gems. Most plates are less than $10/order, which is unheard of on the Strip. Not only that by eating here the plates can feed you for at least half the day. While there are no reservations and everyone in your party must be present, if you can wait 30 minutes to an hour, the meal would be worth it.

The menu features quite a bit of Hawaiian and Filipino plates, so when eating here try one of the plates and upgrade to a short stack of pancakes if you can. My order consisted of the homemade corned beef hash and eggs over medium ($10.95) with an upgrade to garlic fried rice ($1.00) and red velvet pancakes. 
- The corned beef is similar in texture to the corned beef found in the square American cans which are commonly given as gifts when people visit the Philippines on vacation. Personally I like the Australian corned beef found in the bigger round cans, but this is hard to come by and only one restaurant I know served it like that. Still delicious.
- Garlic fried rice has an interesting note - ""contains onions"". I can taste more onion powder than I can the garlic. Also still good.

Pancakes are good, but I was more impressed by sight than taste. The pancakes look quite fluffy and I like the toppings, but the pancakes just by themselves are plain with a slightly bitter aftertaste due to having too much baking powder. The toppings really do make the pancake taste a lot better, which was the case with the red velvet (cream cheese) and the hazelnut (Nutella).

My family likes to go here for breakfast because you can get full here for the same price as eating out at IHOP or a little more than Denny's. Despite some of my minor issues I would still recommend eating here as you get good value for your money.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,8,8,4,X61Qlvc5x_orJhlDlbdN_w

5635965,2013-02-27,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Wow what a place. Came here on a recommendation and damn is it good.

First off, the menu is pretty big and pretty awesome. It's got a unique / filipino flair to it with their Portuguese sausage, adobo omelette thing (side note: it's not really an omelette). They had a special Kalua Pork Sliders or something like that when I was there.

Nearly everything comes with pancakes and they have a ton of different kinds from S'mores to Rocky Road to Banana Cream Pie to Red Velvet, etc. The list goes on, but your stomach will not. It's only $1.50 to upgrade your regular pancake order to one of their fancier ones...and I'd recommend that if I were you.

I got the Mexican omelette ($9.25), which was awesome. It comes with 4 eggs in the omelette. It also has the option of either seasoned potatoes or hash browns...I opted for the hash browns on a spur of the moment decision, but I think I'd go for the seasoned potatoes next time. They're not huge pieces of dry potatoes, but really crispy, smaller pieces that make them perfect. I made that mistake, but you live and you learn. My friend got toast with her omelette...not sure if it was a side of toast or somehow it came with her meal, but when they give you toast, they don't mess around...she had 6 1/2 bread slices (so 3 whole slices for those not good at math). And they're huge pieces

Anyways, it's about 5 miles off the strip, but definitely worth the drive for something a little more local and delicious and different.",nSorHK8zv_8D41i6DEsf9A,1,2,4,_vJuYH5m91_hlrHg2jxKog

We were seated and I must have spent 30 minutes trying to make up my mind on what to get...it was a pretty big decision after all. Finally, I decided to get what the Husband called 'the coward's breakfast' (since I just avoided making a decision by getting one of everything) which consisted of 2 eggs, rice with garlic/onion stuffs, and 2 hazelnut pancakes (I couldn't make up my mind....I call it the Most Winning Breakfast...but that's me!). He got the orange creamsicle pancakes. The pancakes were tiny, but filling. Mine had got od flavor, but were served kind of cold. The rice was not as delicious as I thought...it was garlicky, but didn't have any flavor beyond that. The eggs were cooked well. The husband liked his pancakes, but I didn't care for them.

Service and food are consistent between here and the two other locations I have been in. It is a Filipino-Hawaiian influenced cafe. I noticed the big set of wooden knife, spoon, and fork hanging on the wall (a favorite wall hanging in many Filipino homes). 

My favorite is Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice platter. I usually add one of their signature pancakes (usually the red velvet pancakes). I have sat at their dining bar when I am alone as well as at a table with family/friends. Staff is always friendly and efficient. Food comes out in a timely manner.

Not that I'm a huge pancake person, but I was with someone who is picky and flapjacks is one of the few things he eats, so pancake house we went.
We were there before 9am on Saturday and got ourselves a table right away. I saw a few seasonal pancake specials on the board (ex. Pumpkin pancakes). I was trying to get into a pancake mood... but then I realize I may have stumbled on something special. But before I got too excited then highly disappointed, I asked if the ENTIRE menu up for grab that morning, AND the waitress said YES!  
My friend, they have Spam Scramble served with rice and a side. SPAM SCRAMBLE! There was no need to even consider anything else. I decided to try their garlic rice instead of plain white rice. I chose a side of macaroni salad. I even ordered a side of their ""country gravy"" (think thick brown gravy).  Best $7.95 (plus $1 for garlic rice and $0.75 for gravy) ever spent on breakfast.
NOW - be warned, they aren't messing with the garlic. I could have fought Dracula himself with the amount of garlic I had on my breath. But it was good. The eggs were fluffy, mixed in were chunks of Spam-goodness. They sprinkled a little of furikake all over. At the end I mixed in some of the gravy with the rice. It was legit.

5736764,2012-03-19,1,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I had bookmarked BabyStacks a long time ago and finally decided to make the drive up to give it a try. When I arrived there was a line out the door, but we expected a wait. After about 30 minutes, we were finally seated. I noticed a few things that they could improve on right away. The hostess was rather cold, when people are waiting for extended periods of time for a table, kindness and a smile go a long way. They also have a very small counter area, which I assumed was an option when you placed your name on the list. To my surprise, two couples walked in and went right to the counter! They didn't even tell us that it was first come first served, you don't have to add your name to the list for counter seating! Again, they need to get better control over that because we were not the only group that was upset when we realized this. We waited 30 minutes and two couples walked right in and sat down.They should have everyone add their name to the list and then offer the counter as it becomes available.

Now, onto the food! I got a short stack of their famous red velvet pancakes! As stated by many other yelpers, they were so dreamy! They were moist, delicious, and the cream cheese syrup was divine. They are a little sweet, but not so much that you feel like you are eating cupcakes for breakfast. The short stack was the perfect size, I cleaned my plate but I was definitely full. I was also able to sneak a bite of my husband's banana cream pie pancakes, which were just as tasty.

I was also lucky enough to try their Kalua pig Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was out of this world and worked very well with the rest of the dish. The shredded pork and cabbage were fantastic and overall the dish was very well balanced. They also have delicious seasoned potatoes and hash browns that seem simple but are a really flavorful accompaniment.

Overall, the food is fantastic! I love the way that they designed the menu, almost everything you order comes with pancakes. Unfortunately, they have a few kinks to work out, but the food is so worth the wait. I wish they would open a location in Henderson so I could work them into my weekend brunch routine!",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,2,3,4,NMDLUm965LFXvMlEvJHCbg

I used to love coming here! I was first introduced to a Babystacks cafe (a.k.a Babycakes) by a friend but we used to go to the one over in summerlin. Once we moved, this one became our favorite.

This place, like every other location is always busy! Which isn't a problem, just be prepared to wait about 30-45min depending on how big your party is, especially on the weekends. 

Ever since this place started expanding and opening up more locations, the service went downhill. The food is still pretty good depending on what you order. My favorite of course are the red velvet pancakes. They are soooo worth the long wait. They have a variety of pancakes you can choose from. But they also have everything else; omelettes, crepes, French toast, burritos to name a few.

I've tried quite a few different dishes, they used to do so much better. The food used to taste delicious and the prices were reasonable. But it's been a few visits where the food had to be returned. For the most part I stick to just ordering their pancakes.

I was so excited to bring my mother for breakfast, she had never been and I had hyped it up. But it was such a disappointment. The steak was so tuff the fork wouldn't even go in. Her whole meal was a disaster. We waited almost an hr to be seated and almost another hour after ordering. So by the second time they messed it up my mother had lost her appetite, and the waitress at the moment was so rude a decided to get an attitude and argue! Smh..

The service can be a hit or miss, but for the most part it's a miss. It's never consistent.

On a different occasion we showed up around 1230-1pm, after being seated and placing our order I started to get a strong smell of ammonia. They had already closed off one section of the restaurant, which to me was weird since they were still opened for two more hours. 

Once our food arrived, the smell of ammonia was so strong that I could practically taste it as I was eating. They had actually started moping in the area where we were siting as well as other customers and left the bucket sitting there without them using it. They had already mopped the area that was closed off so that's where the smell was coming from in the beginning. So I nicely asked my waitress if they could please at least wait till we left, but I was ignored cuz they kept on going.

What makes this place even better is their Asian inspired breakfast items...makes the whole family happy!  We loved this place so much we came here twice during our one week vacation here in Vegas. 

On both of our visits the place was crowded, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Service was friendly and fast. From the time we placed our order to the time we got our food, probably was only about 10 minutes. 

Everything we ordered was soo good! The spam scramble w/garlic fried rice, cookies and cream pancakes, adobo fried rice, bananas foster pancakes, kalua pork grilled cheese and spam and eggs were all equally delicious!  Whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. 

Just to highlight on a few:
1) The garlic fried rice is quite tasty!  Just like how my mom used to make it. Lots of garlic flavor, just enough salt and even some bits of the rice is crunchy. I like my rice like that, brings back childhood memories. 

2) The Kalua pork grilled cheese was delish! The pork was smoky and had the perfect amount of saltiness to it. The Muenster and cheddar cheese made this grilled cheese oozing with cheesy goodness. 

3) Bananas foster pancakes - saving the best for last! My mouth is salivating as I'm writing about these pancakes!  The pancake alone is fluffy and has great flavor. The brown sugar butter combo serves as the syrup in this dish, thank goodness. It has the right amount of sweetness and the bananas was caramelized perfectly.

They don't do separate checks.  But the food was on point .. No complaints At all. The seasons potatoes was off the hook. The sausage was good too! My banana cream pie was different I give that a 5 Star!! I will be back I promise you that lol I even order to go lol..,OJW3y3BkJHn5m5ZP8kxSwg,1,1,4,T7Fx5PHXhYOk4ysdL9lnCA

I think the red velvet pancakes tasted like cake and it was too sweet, but it wasn't bad either.  The banana foster pancakes were yummy, but I probably would ask for the syrup on the side since it was too sweet. However, I would definitely give this another try since there are other items on the menu I would like to try like the blueberry pancakes and spinach benedict. :)",4-pOz1BzZ88w2LaPPdl8rg,0,0,3,e9l1SLdFbpWBjjEHnEjbZw

I love their pancakes with extra fluffy whipped cream. I've tried the red velvet, banana cream pie, hazelnut, and regular pancakes. I also enjoy their seasoned potatoes! I always get them when I go there. The loco moco is delicious as well as the adobo fried rice stuffed in an omelet. SOO GOOD. Their skillets are also pretty good. I tried my boyfriend's one time. It was a little spicy because of his tabasco sauce but obviously that is something that can be controlled.

Babystacks is always a great place to have breakfast or lunch!
I would definitely recommend it!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,0,1,5,ZCRL4nT26p7AKZff5fA83A

5921329,2012-03-04,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"The red velvet was delicious, it was light and didn't make you feel disgusted after wards. My daughter had a kids chicken quesadilla with a side of fries, I had a bite, they were just okay. I had a loco moco, the menu said ""generous portions"", but it wasn't generous. Ive been to other places where their loco moco was humangous
 The loco mock was ""just okay"". I rather eat at Egg works or Hash hash a go go
Service was good. The waiter made sure our cups were filled w our coffee.
The place was clean, my party didn't wait long. We came early to beat the crowd. It started getting packed after 10am.

1 star for the pancakes

If you are going to splurge get the Red Velvet or Cookies and Cream.  

Only three stars because they are just pancakes and the other items are average.",YcaO4xCNgt123pNHsJkS_Q,0,0,3,nkoghVcomCcWPt7FB7pytA

5932592,2013-09-01,0,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"Coming from out of town I had literally no expectations. One my friends suggested we try this place after they had heard about it on a previous trip to Vegas. 

Got to try a pretty good array of dishes because we were a group of four and very willing to share a bite of everything. 

The pancakes are obviously what people come in for, and they are phenomenal don't get me wrong -- but I actually really loved the zippy's chili skillet. Chili on breakfast seems so obvious, but for whatever reason I would have never thought to put it together -- it was hands down the best thing we ate there that day. 

I ordered the spam scramble, which was just meh, but I probably should've figured that since no other Yelpers really mentioned it at all. 

Lemon Ricotta Pancakes & Carrot Cake Pancakes were our babystacks of choice, and boy were they good! 

Get yourself off the strip and try this place -- it's totally worth it.",F262q88zc7zsdEeNCzcA0A,2,1,4,Tkwo5WwbLIHW-aJOvtTY-g

5959727,2012-02-11,2,sNVGdeOPeitJ3OWUQBINzQ,"I debated between giving Baby Stacks a 3 or 4 star review. I give them extra credit for all the variety and the fact that it makes me want to try more.

I came here for breakfast this morning to redeem my Yelp Deal. I have been to their first location in the past and was excited that they opened another location closer to my home. 

We came in around 10am, and as I have experienced at the other location, the wait was pretty long. Unfortunately, as with the other location, they underestimate the wait time as well. I just like to know what I'm getting into before I decide to wait or not (don't worry, I'm done venting about that).

We were finally seated and the service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the ham and eggs with hash browns and upgraded to the lemon ricotta pancakes. My fella ordered the chicken omelet with homestyle fries and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes. The food was solid, although I was not a fan of the canned ham they served instead of ham steak. I was also a little disappointed that despite asking for my eggs and hash browns well done, the eggs were runny and the hash browns were really pale, not well done by any means. The food was still good though. I'm a big fan of the flavored pancakes, but the lemon ricotta really weren't doing a lot for me. I wish the curd were slightly more tangy and lemon-y, it was just a little too sweet. The red velvet were just right however. I also wish the pancakes had a fluffier consistency, but the flavors are still really nice.

Overall, a good dining experience and I'm still interested in trying more of their menu items.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,3,SCujW3-F6-rxuce4OCPpkg
