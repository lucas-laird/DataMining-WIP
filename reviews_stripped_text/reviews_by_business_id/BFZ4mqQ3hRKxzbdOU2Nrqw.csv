I drove by today on a way to the bank at the same time trying to figure out what do I want to eat for a late lunch. So I decided to give this place a shot and was not disappointed. I ordered Togoshi Ramen ...
+ bowl is big so I am still full :)
+ tastes good and it had a little bit of everything ... shrimp, squid, pork, fishcake and lots of vegetables.
+ decor is simple but who cares ... just give me good food! :)
+ there was some funny 50-60s japanese music playing ... i kinda liked it too ;)
- it is located in a ghetto ... although why would you care unless you're walking.
Bottom line - best $12 spent for lunch this week.
I will be back to try more stuff.",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,0,0,4,P9IspOD9DZIDp4PlBs2cAA

1007169,2006-08-25,2,BFZ4mqQ3hRKxzbdOU2Nrqw,"I am in Las Vegas. As a friend of mine puts it, it's a ""towering monument to the American dream in all its gaudy crass tasteless glory"". It means buffets, unbelievably big-name restaurants, hours upon hours of shopping for pretty clothes to wear that night, people with egos to match the casinos, all amounting to an insane amount of money-wasting. And that is where people find the fun. 

It is August. I don't even want to know what the exact outside temperature is. I've spent miserable days in Vegas before, and these days are just as fun. I need something, something that is reminiscent of my home, my comforts, my teddy bear. And then we spot it: ""Ramen Restaurant"". A plain sign in a plain strip mall behind all the casinos, but once we enter the parking lot I find that it has quite a big presence in the plaza. 

The windows and the glass door is completely covered up from the inside, but a flashing neon ""open"" sign invites you to come in. Is this Vegas? Or not? Inside is a pretty large space, the walls were plentifully decorated with signs with nothing but Japanese written on them, which is a positive note for me. An open kitchen to the left, cashier directly in front of you where the waitstaff can watch the door, seating area to the right. 

The menu has many typical Japanese snack food, including croquettes, kara-age, and others, rice and curry dishes, mapo dofu (Japanese style, of course), and a nice ramen list that is simple and yet enough for everyone to find something to their tastes. I got the chashu ramen, my significant other got the mapo ramen. 

The broth was nice and clear, even for the mapo ramen, which is a good sign. It was served at the right temperature, came steaming to the table, and remained plenty warm to the last drop. The noodles could have been a bit softer, but I am also used to Korean ramen which has much softer noodles, and just as Japanese tend to like drier rice than Koreans, I know Japanese like firmer noodles. But perhaps they could have been cooked just a bit more, I found some noodles sticking to each other in the beginning which was not a good thing. They loosened up by the time I was about 2/3 done with the bowl.

For Koreans, and other people who like stronger flavors, the mapo ramen is definitely more suited to their tastes. Very strong presence of sesame seed oil and pork, bits of ground pork floating in the soup that get caught amidst your noodles, making every slurp a bit more interesting. The chashu ramen was much more subtle, hearty and yet mild, however the pork slices were unfortunately overcooked, hence a bit dry.

But in the end, I ate and drank it all, and was so grateful for the fact that such a place was present in a desert hell that is Vegas. And the last sign that I was satisfied was that I was immediately overcome by the sleepiness that can only be produced with a good bowl of ramen, and I was quite content.

I would go back just for the mapo ramen, and perhaps try the others afterwards. If I ever find myself stranded in the Vegas horrors yet again, this will be the place I would turn to in order to keep my sanity, and yes, find my teddy bear.

And did I mention you can smoke with your ramen? As a Californian, this is mindboggling.",mvH7LLr26Wj3STZeBdi7Jg,4,3,4,UXbCcmkYGl3DH_Py5UOtbQ

This is where the locals go for good old Japanese food.  The place is not fancy at all in fact looks more like a cafeteria but if you want to eat off the strip, crave authentic Japanese flavors, don't want to spend a fortune or have visitors in Japan and want to make them feel welcome then hit up Togoshi Ramen.  They serve up a lot more than a hot steamy bowl of Japanese style ramen.

My Mom and I took my grandma there during her first trip to the US.  We flew out to Vegas and just when she was getting a little overwhelmed with the crowded streets and loud sounds of the casino we took her to Togoshi's and she looked relieved as if she was lounging on her own little paradise island.  She found the food filling and comforting. 

Then it was back to Vegas life.  We let her rest up as my Mom and I hit up the sushi bar at the Wynn and drank way too much.  Grandma had to put up with the 2 of us snoring through the O show.  I actually was really looking forward to the show.  Bummer!

A new owner has taken over this special Ramen joint as of November.  You can tell as the food and flavor has been spruced up and so has the decor.  The walls are painted red and I love the wall where a menu has been decoratively placed on beautiful twig backdrop.  Very artsy.

My mom and I were back and we hustled are way to Vegas since we were craving ramen and more.  Luckily with made it with an hour or more to spare thanks to my lovely speeding and we had forgotten that we gained an hour driving from Denver to Vegas.  This is what we hit up...

First off we pounded a couple Sapporo drafts as ""nama beer"" is only $1.95.  So good and refreshing especially after a 13 hour drive.  Then we went nuts and ordered tons of dishes to share (ippen dishes is what they are called in Japan and it is the equivalent of ordering apps. or tapas here)

* Mentaiko (spicy cod roe)
* Gyoza (pot stickers)
*Chikuwa Tempura (tempura style fish meat in a hollow tube like form cut into bite size pieces)
*Tori no Karaage (fried chicken bites - my fave dish served with a wedge of lemon)
*Tako no Karaage (fried baby octopus - now my ultimate fave dish wow unbelievably tasty)
*Kimchee (Korean style spicy pickled Napa cabbage)
*side of rice ( I like to enjoy all of the above while eating it with steamed rice, how Japanesey of me)
*Shio Ramen (salt flavored ramen, there are tons of options!  I actually topped mine with kimchee and I love the slice of pork (chashu or char siu style), bean sprouts and green onion toppings)
*Yakisoba (we ordered the comb: beef, pork and vegetable noodles, think Japanese style chowmein)
*Side of Kewpie Mayo (this is something I picked up while living in Japan for 2 years, dip everything in this Japanese mayo kicks everything up a notch esp. with chicken/taco karaage, mentaiko and yakisoba)

So yes, my Mom and I shared all of the above.  Then we ordered some Onigiri (rice balls)  to go for a snack for drive from Vegas to Monterey.    We ordered a couple konbu (seasoned seaweed), an ume (Japanese plum) and katsuo (seasoned bonito fish flakes).

I also grabbed a Calpis aka Calipco ( I know, sounds like cow piss huh... love it)   in a can to go since I was parched.  They also have Chu-hai a very popular adult beverage in several falvors that I highly recommend.  I love Calips Chu Hai!

So as you can see we had a blast and had a great time drinking beer and trying several of their dishes.  The menu is extensive and they have them available in both Japanese and English. Love it!   I can try an read the Japanese menu then I get fed up and order off the English one.

Great exciting new they are opening up another restaurant.  Probably called Izakaya Togoshi in September!  Very awesome... as Izakaya is the Japanese word for pub and is the place where you can grab an adult beverage and feast over small tapas like plates with friends and fam.  Love the idea!  can't wait to try them out in the near future.",2l0O1EI1m0yWjFo2zSt71w,4,1,5,SNJztxs1azTvIz_NU8Ylqw

I usually get an order of Gyoza to go with it.  When speaking about Japanese food, most people think sushi or hibachi.  Not here.  Here you'll find fares that are served in regular restaurants, Ramen, Donburi, food that is cooked or fried, or grilled.  It's off the beaten path, not on the strip, but that's ok.

My fiance and I were so sad when we had to face the reality that we would have to settle for ""ok"" Ramen elsewhere...

From the interior, to the workers and their delicious food, I swear, I just stepped into a ramen shop in Japan. The only thing that was missing is the fact that most ramen shops in Japan have a ""bar"" type thing that surrounds the kitchen and I don't remember there being a ""bar"" by the kitchen. 

They served sake and all the Japanese beer, including orien and all for a nice price. Actually, from food to beverage, everything was affordable and potions and quality were good and VERY similar to what you can get in Japan. Their main attraction was, of course, their ramen; doesn't matter what you get, they were all freakin' good. They also served udon, japanese style hamburger, fried rice, Onigiri!, and other very authentic Japanese food items. It's hard to find a place in the valley that serves authentic, straight up from Japan, Japanese items!

I ordered the Shio Ramen:  The noodles are very very nice.  They have a nice bounce and mouth feel.  I hate limp soggy noodles.  The soup was amazing.  It tasted very meaty and savory.  The salt level was perfect.  The Chashu was very tender, just the right amount of fat, and flavored just right.

My wife ordered the Shoyu Ramen and while I did not like it as much as the Shio Ramen it was still very very tasty.

We also ordered some appetizers:  

Takoyaki - Tasty but the octopus chunks inside were very dry/hard... My daughter though the moving flakes of bonito were freaky!

Gyoza - Tasty but I thought they were a little heavy on the ginger
Shrump Shumai - Very tasty
Croquettes -  Surprisingly good.  Nice buttery flavor, salty, and included corn and carrots inside.  Yum!

The customer service was good.  The chef was happy to accommodate my request for just a simple bowl of rice and butter for my picky daughter.

One of the few things I don't like about Boston is that the noodle shops in the area are either a pain to get to or average at best.  My friend who's currently in grad school in the mid-west has it much worse with very little in the way of authentic ethnic food.  Ramen in the summer?  Sure why not!  I decided to look for a noodle shop on our trip, seeing as that we were both on a budget and looking for something different from the typical Vegas scene.  Togoshi Ramen came up in our search and we weren't disappointed. 

What's amusing is that this place seemed to be pretty popular with the off-beat college students, ie the people my friend and I would hang out with when we were their age.  We really felt in our element.  The radio played JPop music and there was a bookcase with rows of manga available to people who wanted to read while they eat.  The windows and door are indeed tinted to help keep the dining room cool.  The food was great, and reminded my friend of her time in Japan.

The menu is pretty simple, with ramen being their most popular, a few rice dishes, appetizer plates, and some other entrees.  A few other menu items are posted on the walls.

I got the Curry Rice ""curry sauce with vegetables and beef over rice"" for $7.95, which came with miso soup and a side salad.  The soup and salad arrived first, the soup was heavy with seaweed while the salad was shredded cabbage with a tangy vinaigrette.  When my curry rice arrived, I looked at my meal with disappointment.  It was an average amount, and the vegetables were only carrots and onions.  On top of the rice there was pickled ginger.  As I started to scoop out the sauce and rice onto another plate, I noticed there was no beef present.  I swam my spoon throughout the sauce and there was no beef to be found!  I double checked the menu to be sure it said beef and it did, so I waved the waiter over.  I asked if there was supposed to be beef in my dish and he nodded, and apologized and headed to the cook.  When he returned, I was afraid to see what he held in the small soy sauce dish.  Four pieces of cubed beef in curry sauce was what he placed in front of me, and that was just very sad indeed.  Sad for the beef being completely absent in my dish, and sad because of the sorry four pieces of beef cubes he then gave me.  In regards to taste, the curry sauce was fine, nothing special and not worth the price.

The Big F ordered the Cha-Shu Ramen ""soy based soup with EXTRA roasted pork"" for $9.25.  He was very hungry and the bowl presented in front of him was smaller than what we both had in mind.  He then remembered why he hadn't been back.  He was disappointed the last time and he was disappointed again. We probably could have gone to Yokohama Kaigenro and gotten more for our buck.  There were about four to six pieces of sliced pork in his dish, and I wasn't so sure about what made it so 'extra'.  

Overall, we left hungry.  We finished our dinner and was disappointed with the quantity and quality of the food.  Sorry, Togoshi didn't do it for us and you won't see us back here again.

per previous writer, this is a REAL ramen house. Even more ""authentic"" than the ones found inside Mitsuwa.

i had ordered a bowl of tanmen, which is essentially a bowl of Chinese home-style ramen in pork soup. Why not the typical miso ramen or shoyu ramen? Because tanmen, while extremely popular in Japananese ramen shacks, isn't found in too many ramen houses on the west coast due to its similarity to Chinese noodle soup.

Maybe I'm just not used to this style of ramen, and perhaps my experience at ramen places in Gardena, CA might have spoiled my taste buds, but I really didn't find it appealing. I ordered the shio ramen, expecting it to be like the one I usually get at Santouka but it was nothing like that. The broth was clear, unlike the milky white soup base at Santouka. Chashu was rather dry and unflavorful. 

Maybe it's the best ramen place you can find in Vegas but it just didn't do anything for me.",LGa1GmTItb4bu6HI7KPKfA,0,0,2,f-kcW5a6SQe0gjdF5Ybs4g
