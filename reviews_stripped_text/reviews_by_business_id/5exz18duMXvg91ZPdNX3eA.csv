We had enough of buffet the last couple of days.. and since today is our last day in Vegas we just wanted a quick bite for lunch before heading to the airport.. The price is too expensive 6pcs chicken is 22bucks.. for me thats ok it must be good for the price.. We order to go coz our plan is to go at Bally's food court where we can grab rice .. good thing We did! why? the chicken is TOO SALTY!!! salty on its breading but when you eat the inside part of it? Its TASTELESS!!! OMG.. You cannot even compare the price and Taste of POPOYES Chicken or even KFC.. Totally Ripoff,f2iPcf08cOCv0Xn2K4WvYg,2,0,1,Kyk_R0ZEEIl-Jgdd68nzug

Let's be real about fried chicken in any area dominated by tourists and shoppers- you're probably over paying for not-so-southern style fried chicken.  While Church's (aka Texas Chicken depending where you live) and Jollibee hold my top spots for taste and value, this place surpassed my expectations being smack in the middle of the LV strip.

For about $30, my girlfriend and i had a relatively generous dinner for what LV restaurants would offer at this price-point (3 thighs, a fried chicken sandwich, and sides).

There was no wait to order and plenty of seating, which was nice considering we went on a Saturday night.

Their sauce selection at the tables was nice- honey, some special sauce, a combo of hot sauce and honey, and a siriacha-like sauce.  And of course ketchup for non hipsters",DDZCg3rXZ8NpWhFdLwThMw,0,0,5,VS3d4R5iJwsQoTgtU1pnJQ

Many who wander claim to not be lost, in my travels I stand tall and admit, I have been and will be lost throughout my adventures. Arriving at this chicken joint I'm greeted with humble and inviting personalities from all across the world... The Vegas world. I decided to scarf down a royal wing food entree which consisted of 6 individually picked wings. Succulent pieces of prime poultry. I drizzled every sauce I could get my paws on, and boy.. what a great decision I have made. One of the few good choices I've made in my life.

The chicken was tender and moist, but not freshly cooked or hit. Really barely warm. Whatever seasoning the sprinkle on it after it is cooked doesn't really help with the flavor. I ate the first wing plain. The second I used a couple of the sauces. I'd say these are mandatory because they add a lot. The honey chipotle was good.  I got lucky with the fries and caught a fresh batch. I noticed the cook just dumped the fresh over a large quantity that were already in the pan so in a few orders the people wouldn't be as lucky as I. The mac in the mac and cheese was perfectly cooked but I didn't care for the cheese at all and didn't eat much if it.  Decor is ok. Staff is listless and not too helpful.

Ordered a kids meal it comes with 1 chicken strip and I added one more. It was $3.25 for an additional strip I shouldn't haven't ordered another one because the portion is hugeee!  My kid couldn't even eat 1. :( We also ordered the family meal and 2 of their chicken sandwiches. Everyone seemed to enjoy the chicken. I ended up eating the chicken sandwich we ordered the blue ribbon original and the Firebird.  The original one was okay! I liked the Firebird better it was super spicy though but it was a good kick.  I wasn't too crazy for the pickled cucumbers. I love pickles but cucumbers on a chicken sandwich odd combo to me but some people love it. The fries were really good as well as the shakes. 

Elvia the girl at the front as well as the others working there were amazing. But Elvia was a total sweetheart, patient and helped me on what to order. They have some good service here.

The chili one that I had was actually pretty damn spicy so it kinda gives a twist to your regular fried chicken sandwich. The other reasons why I like it though is that they have a good variety of sauces(honey, chipotle honey, wasabi honey and so on). I also really love the fries. These kind of fries are my absolute favorite. The thinner the fries, the more I like it. I had a bite of the fried chicken itself because my friend ordered it and that was the most surprise of all because the chicken itself was actually very good. However, I'm still unsure if I'll get the chicken itself over the sandwich just because I feel it's more worth it for the sandwich in terms of being full and a good portion vs the chicken itself.

I personally liked Blue Ribbon...It isn't Howling Rays but I would definitely come back AND it's probably one of the cheaper meals you can get in vegas.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,0,0,4,jZWcVM39dnJG_Qrovp1gYg

This restaurant is located in front of the Bally's hotel in an area called the grand bazaar. If you park in Bally's parking lot and you are a resident here, you can park for free for up to 24 hours using your valid Nevada state ID. 
Now, about the food here. I would have to say that the chicken is very tasty and tender. There's not so much batter taking over the chicken experience. They seem to use homemade pickles in their sandwiches. I would recommend this place as I enjoyed the food tremendously. However, I would not recommend the lemonade or the shakes. The price of their shakes is $5.95 which to me is ridiculous. You could go somewhere else afterwards and get better dessert for a lot less. The lemonade tastes like the powder mix not like real lemonade. I was very disappointed with it. Also, when I was trying to locate this restaurant, I tried calling but no one answered, another negative to this place. But overall I would give this place four stars for the flavor and tenderness of their chicken. Check them out and let us know what you think!

Update, I am now a vegan and came here with my family for lunch. I had the kale salad and sweet potato fries. They were pretty good in spite that they're known for their chicken. I was hopeful that I could at least have those two things. I would probably have the salad again, it was tasty after all.",FSj9x9h4C90__hTKvnazEg,0,0,4,wc-664W3VmpR5ufvGO_A3Q

Let me start with the overall taste of the fried chicken since that's what's obviously drawing people to this place.
It was good but not as mind blowing as the experience of getting it turned out to be.
We got there around 11 pm on a Sunday. There were about 6 people ahead of us in line. The line took about 30 minutes to get to us. We're immediately told by the girl taking orders that all they have is chicken and we can only order chicken. Mind you a fresh tray of fries just came out. I ask if we can order fried chicken livers and she said no. Only fried chicken!
In any case, we end up ordering 2 chicken strips at $3.50 each and a breast at $5.50 along with a chicken sandwich. The total comes to around $25! It now takes another 20 minutes for us to get our food. Mind you, the chickens already all premade and sitting right behind the counter ready to throw into a bag right next to a huge tray of now cold fries that we weren't allowed to order while they were still hot! The cashier continues telling people all they can order is chicken. 
My number is called and I go to get my food. It's not to go and I tell the guy it's supposed to be, to which he responds, ""that's not what the ticket says""!
Anyways... We begin walking down the strip and I pull out the strips to munch on while walking back to our hotel and they are kid meal sized tiny! I feel like I've seen bigger strips when I've order nuggets from other places! Definitely not worth $3.50 each! They have a family meal which feeds 4 and comes with 12 strips! Truth be told, I could easily put away all 12 of those strips and last I checked I wasn't an entire family! The chicken sandwich wasnt great at all. You could tell that the chaos happening inside the restaurant greatly affected how this sandwich was rushed to put together. It was soggy and lacked flavor.
Long story short... The fried chicken was good but the experience makes me never want to go back especially considering the thousands of other restaurant options all around this one!",YVgZkCwXnnC60uq6nmi4vg,1,0,2,y13dPSldns5qieM5MLTr3g

The extra chicken on the sandwich is just another patty. Though it admittedly is quite a bit of food. Wouldn't really say the sandwich was so good that it was worth the 13-14 dollars.

I wasn't impressed by this small fried chicken chain despite being very hungry. The food was fine but nothing was particularly outstanding. 

The breading they use is on the bready side and tastes like many other fast food chains. This is especially noticeable with the patty which isn't a piece of chicken breast but more processed like a culet, or again like something you'd get at a chain. The chicken wing I got was fine but it just wasn't high quality.

Was also turned off by the cashier who was rude. I normally don't write about service but this was pretty egregious especially given it was in Vegas.

You can add other sauces at the table though I did not since I wanted to try their food as is.

First, the staff is sooooo unorganized.  Everybody's orders took forever when all of the chicken was already made and sitting behind the counters! When we got to the counter the seemingly new and clueless counter girl told us we can only order chicken (because they were out of everything) when a fresh pan of fries literally just came out of the fryer. 

This place touts its 12 piece tenders meal as enough to feed a family of four. Thinking they were large my friend and I ordered 2 to find that they were TINY. We also ordered a fried breast piece and the Pit Burger. The tenders and the breast tasted pretty good and were fairly crunchy but by no means lived up to any hype. Especially the teeny portions of the tenders. The burger was not great either... it was kind of overstuffed and the flavors didn't really work. It was too wet overall. 

Disappointing experience to say the least given the 35+ minute wait with only 6 ppl ahead of us in line and all the chicken was premade..",xbjaurNReCDOKzqYlLYv2Q,2,0,2,tTCH5_m0BgZfoSLgj5coVQ

It's tucked away behind a small plaza and there isn't any easy parking spots nearby, but it is definitely worth the walk. They have a bar window outside for easy access, but in terms of size for seating it is pretty small. There is seating outside however!

I ordered one of their signature burgers (sandwiches) The Blue Ribbon and their dirty fries.

The burger had delicious buns and the chicken was seasoned well and super crispy!  They also give you the choice of many sauces (about 6) which can suit your taste needs from spicy to sweet to savory. The dirty fries are a must try! Absolutely delicious! It includes bacon and Cajun seasoning. My girlfriend also ordered their cheesy supreme burger and really loved it.

So when I was asked what I wanted for dinner we were in the same vicinity so this place was an obvious choice to come back too. Now let's talk about the parking..... THERE AINT NONE. This spot is technically located in the Grand Bazzare Shoppes so to park anywhere near the place you would have to park in the parking garage at A) Paris Hotel  B)Bally's or C) do what we did and parked AAAALLL the way down the street for some free parking and spent a little bonding (walking) time getting to the place.

Anyways it's located the farthest from the street and it's sort of tucked in the back so finding it is a little difficult. Considering I've been there before I knew exactly where it was with no problem. So when you walk in you go to the counter and order up there, they give you one of those beeper type of things to tell you when your order is ready and then you wait from there. The menu is very straightforward. Chicken, Chicken sandwhiches, Chicken tenders, Salad which you can add chicken too. LOL they had a few other things that could be customized but the general premise is the same. I ordered the two tenders and fries meal (8.95 ish) and normally for a few tenders and some fries I wouldn't spend 10 bucks but these things are HUGE and they pile the fries HIGH. Our wait wasn't too long and when it did come out it was piping hot. Like you could see the grease still popping on the tenders HOT. It came with a small side of cole slaw and on the table you have your options of loads of different sauces. My favorite is the chipotle honey mixed with hot sauce and some bbq sauce. Everything was great. The service was excellent. I swear the lady taking our order was so helpful to me and my friend. Explained everything, and was so patient with us.   Honestly I don't even think I finished my entire meal. (think they threw in an extra tender for our wait).My signs of a good restaurant experience is if I leave full and happy.

The cheese, the BBQ sauce, the Chipotle honey... the service, the wait time... it was all spot-on.  That $9.75 delectable monster barely fit in my hands but I managed!  The stringy fries were fresh, as was the coleslaw.  Beverage-wise, that Boylan's Diet Cane Cola was leagues better than any diet soda I typically drink.

They have a fairly large menu with all sorts of chicken items on it. From sandwiches to wings and tenders, sides, salads, milkshakes, Boozy shakes, shots, alcohol drinks and of course fountain drinks. Many of the items on the menu I wanted to try but decided on the Firebird sandwich since I was looking for something spicy. 

The Firebird sandwich is a sandwich made with a crispy chicken piece (mine was huge!), shredded lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, pickled peppers which are jalapenos, and a spicy Chipotle sauce all on a toasted bun. Cost $8.75. The chicken was delicious. It was cooked perfectly. It could've used a little more salt, but that's nothing I couldn't add myself. The chipotle sauce was tasty without overpowering the whole sandwich. My only problem with the sandwich was the number of jalapenos they put on it. The jalapenos were terribly hot and they added oh so many of them on my sandwich. My mouth was on fire, so I had to take off 90% of the jalapenos. So, if you don't like spicy, don't get this sandwich. I'll probably ask for fewer jalapenos next time I get this. 

My guest got the Cheesy Supreme sandwich and made it a combo. He added a small order of ""Fries with the works"". All combos come also with cole slaw. The Cheesy Supreme sandwich is made with a crispy chicken piece, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, your choice of 2 kinds of cheese and Blue Ribbon Special Sauce. His combo cost just under $14. 

The Fries with the works are made of crispy fries and topped with aged cheddar, smoked bacon, and sour cream. The small order was more than big enough for 2 people to share, especially when you have one of those HUGE sandwiches. 

The inside was very clean and organized. They had a selection of different kinds of honey and hot sauces at each of the seating areas as well as at the Hot sauce table. They offer ice water for free to their customers, which is very nice on hot days here. Their trash can is a trash compactor. First time I've seen this. 

Employees were friendly and very knowledgeable of the items on their menu.

I ordered the cheesy supreme and added smoked bacon! Chicken was cooked to order and was served piping hot with oooey gooey melted cheddar and American cheese, with what seemed like a marinated beefsteak tomato, house made pickled cucumbers , fresh shredded lettuce and a delicious (egg?) bun, and thick cut smoked bacon, perfection !! The fries were piping hot and good , but maybe a thicker cut as an option as they cooled off fast and became crunchy and cold ! While hot they were delicious once cold I threw half away , same for the sweet potato fries, the coleslaw was bland and vinegary ! The real star is the chicken !! Maybe get sides at wahlburger or one of the other restaurants in the bazaar shops?

4163726,2018-01-24,0,5exz18duMXvg91ZPdNX3eA,"Since everyone was going crazy over this chicken, I figured I needed to try it! So, I brought my friend from out of town to eat for dinner. 

The location itself is perfect if you're on the Strip. It's tucked away in the Bally's Bazaar. There are a few table seats and a bar seating area. It was relatively small, so we had to eagle-eye for a table. There was a sauce station in the corner and sauces on every table. 

I ordered the AM-PM sandwich, which is the January special of the month. It was very good. The chicken was actually fantastic. It was extremely tasty and full of flavor. 

The three star review is entirely because of the service. I would give one star for the staff, but the food was too good. So, they entirely messed up my order. I ordered the AM-PM sandwich, the Rancher, a side of corn bacon, a small beer, and a large drink. They gave me mac-n-cheese instead of the corn bacon. They charged me for a large beer ($15!) and forgot the large drink entirely, even though they charged me for it. I figured since the beer was already poured, I would just drink it. I mean, more beer is always fine with me. I think my friend got a different sandwich than he ordered, but he was fine with whatever at that point. The food took a long time, so I didn't even bother complaining about the mistakes in the food. Just not sure how so many things were incorrect from my order. 

It was pretty expensive for being chicken sandwiches. The total for the above order was $45. However, I understand that it was on the Strip and the alcohol alone was $15. So, it was okay. I would say the prices are comparable for Strip prices. Just not sure I would pay for it again. 

Overall, the food was great. Pricey, but great. The staff was very disappointing. I would give this place another shot but probably at the Summerlin location.",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,0,0,3,PK5t10Y_SvTfXx3k_I8w_A

Basics:
- Order at the counter and sit down or take it to go
- Price Range / Person: $12 - $18 (without alcohol)
- Any meal listed + side should fill you up
- Classics include drumsticks and the Firebird sandwich (there are also seasonal specials not-so-obviously posted around)
- Their sauces are great to amplify flavor profile that you enjoy

Upon walking in it is loud and a bit small but there is seating outside. The next thing I noticed were the prices. There were close to Five Guys prices and it was over $30 for a beer, fries, two sandwiches and hush puppies. The sum of my Ranch sandwich was not impressive.

LOCATION/INTERIOR:
 - located in the shopping area right outside of Bally's.
 - they have seating inside and outside.

ORDER & TASTE:
* You order first then they will give you a buzzer for when your order is ready.  When you pay with card, there is a prompt to tip - I don't appreciate this system especially because of the service I received. I don't think they served the tip.  The girl taking the order was not friendly. 
 - 2 pc tenders ($9.95): this is the combo that comes with fries and coleslaw. Chicken itself was okay, wasn't dry so that was at least good. But presentation was terrible. If you like the thin strongly fries, it is pretty good. It was crispy. Still think it was expensive for the 2pc.
 - fries the works small ($7.75): I honestly didn't think this was with it at all. It didn't like very appetizing and it was super oily.  Don't waste your money.

* For the price, didn't think the food was worth it.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:

Try the chicken and fries with their honey sauces: wasabi or wildflower. Both honey are good, even the wasabi one was delicious (that's coming from someone who hates wasabi!)

This location is in the Grand Bazaar at Bally's, which is a new development of modern restaurants and shops that are open late. We came here around midnight and they were still open and happy to serve customers.

The fries are good, and the chicken is solid (lots of pepper flavor!), but it's not lifechanging. The inside of the restaurant was pretty messy when we went (they're busy, I get it, but no one was cleaning up trays that looked like they had been sitting on tables for a while). The staff was also pretty unprofessional; any staff at a Shake Shack or In-n-Out would make this place look like McDonald's in terms of service.

If you've never been to a Blue Ribbon before, this is an ""order at the counter place"" that's pretty narrow inside and ultimately looks like a fast food restaurant (because it is). The chicken sits under lights, and they quickly grab it with tongs and give it to you. You can get food pretty fast as a result, but it's still hardly an upscale fast food place, which you'd expect after spending close to $20/person. 

That being said, it serves a purpose. You can get food fast, and it has a lot of bready goodness. It's not fancy, but the fries are bomb, and the chicken is better than most fast food places.

To me, it was a one and done type of thing. And I hate saying that of any business. Flavor was good, but that's about it. Maybe the pieces that I had were flavored inconsistently? I'm not sure.

The food comes out fast, they serve Boylan natural sodas, and cocktails on draft. Their draft beer selection is a nice mix of national and local and might I recommend the Hazelberry boozy milkshake. It's a blend of Nutella and Chambord.

Then the next day got the 2 piece with and extra wing added. It was great! Come with fries and coleslaw which is very tart and not to good.  Bf got the chicken sandwich he said it was great too. They have a spicy honey sauce Over the chicken. Can't wait to come back to Vegas to visit here again. Staff is super friendly. There's a red head girl she was some helpful and nice !!,OvgbjviwkivkUST0yQQsxw,1,0,5,qF7tZ9RUz2YYVzD0ITQOlw

The chicken was moist, well seasoned, excellent breading. The condiments on the sandwich added to the flavor. Love this place and will go again when I am back to Vegas.",ftul9cQ-TO_fLCiAUeM7eQ,0,0,5,z6fRGBVcBb07Z60JE36Q7g
