Don't ever go here if you are really hungry, cause the service is beyond mediocre and no food comes quickly. The people are nice enough, but are in no hurry to do anything quick for you, that includes bartenders, getting drinks, plates cleared, getting food.....the food is alright,  drinks were tasty, but the poor service ruined the experience",gnFP9cD_ktlM3XrC9dSYbw,0,0,2,T9vloiv7bU5po40uVEtX_Q
156592,2013-03-04,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"Without a doubt, the worst food I have ever eaten.  Ordered linguine with clam sauce and chicken parmesan.  The clam sauce obviously came out of a can.  The chicken parmesan was cold and the pasta looked like it was left over from someone else's dinner.  The female bartender on Thursday told us the food was fantastic.  We came back on Saturday and I will never go back to Dean's Place................that's how bad the food tasted.  Even Burger King makes a better chicken parmesan, so you know it had to be pretty disgusting.",wqigvo85tGAB9TP0navelg,0,0,1,2L-qz42aHQTcY3wxatRbbA
233442,2009-11-15,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"My husband and I stopped at this place on our way to Red Rock canyon. Being Dean Martin fans, we were also curious. When we entered the place, we were greeted warmly by the staff. Our server, Edna, was incredible. She was so nice and attentive to us! I ordered a custom made calzone and my husband had a Philly Cheesteak sandwich. The bread is made fresh daily as are all the sauces. One bite of my calzone and I was in heaven. It was by far the BEST calzone I have ever eaten! The bread was perfectly cooked, the ingredients were fresh and tasty as was the mozzarella cheese. It was so good in fact that we came back the next day!! There were many wonderful items on the menu but I had to have the calzone. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his sandwich and the breakfast the next day. They also make all their sausages in house. I cannot say enough about this place. On our way out of town, Edna was kind enough to supply us with cold bottled water for our trip. She definitely went above and beyond and even told us some history about Las Vegas. When we return to Las Vegas, we will definitely stop in again at Dean's Place. If you go, ask for Edna. She will treat you right.",71nxWEFtCTEQfONDnPK4NA,0,0,5,BhmmLURhM7VGpeHr6GDD3g
267382,2008-12-15,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"When one of my friends suggested meeting here for drinks instead of my usual favorite hangouts, i.e. Yardhouse in Town Center, I was skeptical. After all, I live in Henderson, and the only time I've ventured near Blue Diamond is when I'm taking 15 South to head towards L.A. Anything outside of the 215/15 intersection tends to be pushing my comfort zone! However, I am never one to turn down the possibility of finding a potentially new favorite hangout place. This place wasn't bad though. My vodka tonics were strong and only $4 a piece. Food wasn't bad either. My friend ordered the Italian Wedding soup, which was decent. I got the fried mozzarella, which of course is the *perfect* drunchie food. The service was good, and it's actually the perfect place to just hang out, relax, and talk.

They now charge more fir dinners and don't include soup or salad anymore not good. I don't think we will be coming back because of this, my wife and I have been coming for years and now we just decided never again. I hope the management takes note and puts back the choices and the menu. I recognize that food cost has gone up but not that much.

I went for ribs night...the ribs are not good/overcooked and service was aweful.  I would have accepted 1 without the other based on venue and pricing.  The other 2 items ordered were fine, good for bar food.  Summary...I won't be back and would only recommend visiting if intoxicated AND walking home .

I clip a few of their coupons and have seen their Billboards all over the place. I finally stopped in for some grub. Well I was thinking yucky bar food! However I happen to hop in on a night that they were doing a 7 course wine tasting and to my surprise they have an extensive Italian Menu. I sat at the bar, look around and saw that others were eating at the bar. Struck up a conversation with another patron and he suggested trying the Lasagna. The Salad and the dressings were good, the server/Bartender allowed me to try the soup which was Jalapeno corn chowder. It was too rich for me but I took some home for my husband and he loved it and wanted me to go back and get some more. The Lasagna was tasty but the food should have been hotter. It was very tasty but I did mention the lack of heat on it and she offered to heat it up but I kindly refused due to my paranoia. I did lose $40 in the machine but she comp my meal feeling bad that is was not hot enough. I left her a $20 tip and we parted ways. I want to go back with my husband and try it again as this point. See you there soon.

627725,2012-11-27,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"Dean's was nothing special.  I guess the location on Dean Martin Drive and the one picture of Dean Martin in the entryway are what makes it ""Dean's"" Place.

It's billed as an Italian restaurant; there's Italian aplenty (chicken piccata, eggplant parm, Italian sausage sandwich, etc.) but there's a lot of American influence as well (burgers, pulled pork).  The food is fine, portions are a good size, and the prices are reasonable.  

The service is slooooooooooooooow.  The restaurant was nowhere near busy the night we were there, but it took our server forever and a day to bring our drinks.  I thought she'd gotten lost on the way to our table.  A couple that was seated fifteen minutes after we were received their food ten minutes before we did.   

There are several TVs in this place, all playing sports, so it feels more like a sports bar than a restaurant.",wtOtViAQNprzTw6qJxj-hg,0,0,2,mi3itPBB2G2LL_si5xJsFw

The atmosphere is very casual and calm. Plenty of TVs in the bar area and a friendly staff. What brings me back though is a few of the menu items. Namely the Fish and Chips and their amazing Prime Rib Dip Sandwich! OMG, a must try if you are a French dip fan. The fish and chips get the same review from me, a MUST try! As far as I know almost all their menu items are homemade including their desserts, lasagna, dressings and even some awesome Italian sausage! A bit out of the way, you will feel like a foodie guide bringing people here, who otherwise  would never have known. Deans has gone through some staff in the last few years and seem to have found a great group of people who really care about giving a customer a great experience.

After that we heard the bartender informing everyone at the bar about the DUI checkpoint so they didn't drive home that way. We finally get our food my pizza was over done and my husbands sandwich was a white bun with lunch meat. It was something you'd expect from a school cafeteria.

Sat at the bar and had a few cocktails and ordered some appetizers.  Apart from the delicious food, the service was fantastic.  We caught the day shift bartender at the end of his shift, and spent another hour or so with the swing bartender.  Both were friendly and engaging!  Great service!

1829130,2017-10-14,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"I heard about the ribs special on Wednesday nights (all you can eat ribs plus the usual sides for the very reasonable price of $19 - such a deal!). We were in the neighborhood with friends and had to give it a try. The ambiance is ""local bar/restaurant"" - think Winchells or PTs. Very basic, no tablecloths, lots of TVs with sports running. 
When we arrived, we were the only ones in the dining area (there is a walled off bar area that is very separate). As soon as we sat, our server, Sara, came by to explain the special and take our drink order. My wife and I each got the ribs. My buddy went with the spaghetti and meatballs. The portions are huge! My buddy loved the spaghetti and meatballs. Also a very large portion and very tasty. In addition to the full rack of ribs, my order came with a very large portion of fries (done perfectly), beans, slaw, and corn bread. The ribs were fall off the bone tender with a sweet bbq sauce. Yumm. The corn bread also excellent. Way too much food for me to finish even the first serving, let alone take advantage of ""AYCE"" (I guess one portion was all I could eat).
Next time here, the wife and I will share a serving of ribs and forgo the unlimited refills. Even with 2 of us working on it, we wouldn't finish it all.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,1,4,E1vOdGeHPysVXm8SN8RFWA
2005400,2012-03-01,1,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"Lots of negative reviews, but I had a fine dining experience. As usual, it starts with the bartender (in the non-smoking section). She was very nice and so was the pig-tailed server. It was about 8pm on a Wednesday and I was looking for the UNLV game. The staff was quite helpful and found the game after a few minutes (They have every freakin channel if you need to watch a game). Meal started off great with hot Rosemary bread served with butter and balsamic and olive oil mix. Usually that is a good sign. Entree came with a large salad loaded with croutons and some of the biggest Cherry Tomatoes I have ever seen (i needded a knife to cut the 2nd one after the first one exploded in my mouth). Dressing was homemade Vinegarette and was getting full already. For the main shot, i tried the Chicken Picatta - something I don't usually get, but i was trying to avoid cheese. You need to like Capers andlemon sauce, but that is what Picatta usually consists of. Two large chicken breasts were tasty and then they even included a large side dish of pasta (( i had angel hair and marinara). All of this for $11.95. Oh yeah and a slice of garlic Bread to boot. 
     Some of menu is all over the place (south of the Border specialities?), but stay with Italian basics and if it seems like too much is going on with a dish skip it.

I love listening to the old school music they play and relaxing with a beer. Usually when we eat here, we come for breakfast on the weekend. The service is usually good and the Saturday breakfast is always well prepared and tastes really good. Another good meal is the ribs on Wednesday. They are really tasty and come with beans, coleslaw and corn bread which is also really good.

3512507,2009-03-15,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"I really wanted to like this place; my husband and I have been on a search for a really good Italian place in Vegas close by to where we live.  I've eaten there three times now, and I have to give a mediocre review.  
First off, the bread they serve with the dinner's is plain awful.  Not a really good, fresh baked regular Italian loaf like I expected, but a white bread with what I believe was tons of strong fennel baked inside it.  I about gagged, and the five other people I have eaten there also didn't like it.  So that was a disappointing start to our meal.  
Fried cheese appetizer was pretty good, but honestly is a bit hard to screw up in my opinion.
I ordered the fettucine alfredo, and my husband the spaghetti and meatballs.  On one good note, my husband really loved the spaghetti and meatballs and their Italian wedding soup.  But I ordered the fettucine alfredo, and I have to say it was the WORST I've ever eaten!  It had absolutely no flavor, and was the blandest sauce ever.  I had to send it back.
Second time, we tried their pizza.  Not too bad, only down side is I have this pet peeve about chunky sauce in my pizzas, and their sauce there is chunky, and that's what's used in the pizza.  I know a lot of people probably don't care about that, but I do, so a negative in my opinion.
But the third time we ate there with my mother and sister and law.  They both ordered the lasagna, and both about gagged on it.  Couldn't put a finger on it, and maybe it was spoiled, but both said it was disgusting.  Sent it back, telling them it was just plain gross and perhaps spoiled, but the waitress said it had been made the night before....but who knows.  The waitress that time was very friendly and gave us free cheesecake because of it, which was not too shabby at all.

Overall, because of the two times in a row somebody in my party has had to actually return dishes to the kitchen ( and I honestly cannot remember the last time I had food that bad at any restaurant so not like it's a habit!) and the crappy bread to begin the meal, I really can only give Dean's Place two stars, and the only reason that high is because my husband really enjoyed the spaghetti and meatballs and wedding soup.

4137850,2012-02-23,2,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"Food looked appetizing but was so darn bland!!!! Service was rude,slow,unfriendly,not welcoming,unhelpful and totally unapologetic!!!

I got the Cappelini Pasta topped with basil,tomatoes and cheese. The dish was $12.95 but I added shrimp to it which added $3.00. = $15.95 The BF got the Penne Pasta with Vodka sauce $13.00.  When I told the waitress about how bland our food was - her responce was ""Well, you have salt on your table - you could add that"" - My reply- Excuse me - for the price I'm paying I shouldn't have to add salt for some sort of flavor.

The bruschetta was edible but did not look anything like the picture of bruschetta on their picture menu   T.V. that they have playing. Our meals came with soup or salad- we both opted for salad- Edible-

My daughters fettucini was bleh - hungry child ate it-

The waitress told me that every cook is different and some cooks just cook better than others- she asked me if I wanted anything else - so I asked her for the menu- she gave me the menu and I told her that I didn't have much time cause of my kid's practice near by - she said it shouldn't take that long.

After informing the waitress that I was running late for my child's practice and that I was not going to order anything else she rudly picked up both our uneaten bland dishes and kicked open the door to the bar while taking a big breath as she was walking away saying ""OK hmm let's see what can be done about this"" 


After about 10minutes of waiting for her to take my order she finally came out and instead of taking my order first she took another tables order (4 orders) so of course that meant I wasn't going to be able to eat- she ignored my hand gesture to come over to my table - she went to the back - then appeared out of no where with the check showing me that she took off the 2 bland orders but instead charged me for the salads that we both ate - OMG!!!!!


Umm the salads were a freakin given - they came with our horrible meal - we would have never ordered a small plate of salad for about $6.00 each anyways- the waitress could totally tell that we weren't happy but she didn't give a crap - no manager came out - no comp meal - no offering of a free dessert - no nothing- 
Now I'm not looking for free handouts but come on you want customers coming back after such an unpleasant experience don't you??.... Am I right??

At the end of this whole experience our waitress finally said these 2 words""I'M SORRY"" Those 2 words should have came out of her mouth a long time ago - I quickly caught on to the fact that she wasn't sorry she was just working for her tip-

Here's my tip - learn how to smile, learn how to say Hello, learn how to be compationate to your customers needs and concerns because without us customers- you my dear would not get a paycheck- learn how to go that extra mile for your customer because it only benefits yourself!!!

Bottom line is that even though there were only 2 other people in the dining area no one paid attention to us and when the waitress did come around and we had a request/concern she acted like we were bothering her - she looked like she hated her job - Honey, that's not the customers problem!!

As far as the first impression, it is pretty similar to the hundreds of bar & grill type establishments in the valley. They offer a separate gaming area, and have a non-smoking dining area and second bar/dining area without gaming. 
First impressions aside, the food is quite good. Much of the items are made from scratch or have fresh made components (salad dressing, pasta sauce, etc...) My favorites include their grilled cheese (on marbled rye) and their pasta. I've also had their pizza, which was good as well, but only had that once. 
I almost exclusively visit at lunch, and on almost ever visit it takes more  than an hour to get in and out. This is an issue and would stop me from giving four stars.

4902007,2012-08-16,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"My wife and I had been wanting to go to Dean's Place for months.  We eat out 3-5 times a week, many times at places we have a coupon for or they have a dining or happy hour special.  Dean's has been running a coupon in the Vegas paper, the RJ, for quite some time for buy an entree and get one free.  Every week I would tear one out in anticipation of going.

We decided to go last Monday.  Unfortunately, we could not find one of coupons immediately so my wife got on the Internet.  On the newspaper's website where we get the coupons from, in a section entitled the ""RJ Marketplace"", was a Dean's coupon.  We printed it out and zoomed over there.  We normally eat at the bar and play video poker, but it was smoky in there for dining so we went to the smoke-free dining room.  

I need to preface this as my wife and I are both former wait-people.  We are VERY critical of servers/wait people.  I also was a bartender, bar manager, restaurant manager, owner and operator of a restaurant, and a restaurant consultant.  

Our server, Victoria, was exceptional.  She quickly greeted us after we sat down, said she would be with us shortly.   She came back, asked us if we had ever been to Dean's Place and why we had decided to come there.  Jointly, my wife and I said ""the coupon"".  I did mention I liked their radio ads and it sounded like a place we could have fun eating, drinking, and gambling at.  

We ordered a fairly-priced bottle of wine.  Victoria again engaged in small talk that was not your everyday ""is it hot outside"" sort of dribble.  My wife's salad was good, had red onion, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and nice croutons in it.  A cut above your average dinner salad.  My soup, chicken tortilla, was possibly the best I have ever had, loaded with chicken in a fantastic tomato base.

My wife's lasagna was good, not great, but better than some more highly-priced places.  I had the spaghetti carbonara,  reasonably priced and it was good.  A lot of chicken and bacon.  Two days earlier I had the carbonara at Terra Verde at Green Valley Ranch Resort and Dean's was better.  

The kicker:  (sorry for the length).  We gave our coupon to Victoria.  She came back and said they couldn't accept it as it was not an original, it was printed out.  (it is exactly the same as the original, but did come from the RJ's website).
She told us it says they only accept originals.  We didn't understand why they let the RJ post their coupon online with a ""Print this coupon"" button.

She did the proper thing and politely said ""I will get the manager"".  He came out and just kept reiterating that it says they don't accept printed coupons on the coupon.  And he is right, it does say that in the very fine print.  Which we obviously did not read (it would require my reading glasses which I rarely even now where they are at)

The manager had an opportunity to turn a bad situation into a very good situation.  Instead of saying, ""I will make an exception this time"",  we were basically treated as people who were trying to rip Dean's Place off of $13. 

He had the opportunity to gain frequent customers for life.  Instead, we will never set foot in that restaurant again. 

 I went to their website as I thought I would drop an email to them recounting our visit.  Their website does not list an email address and the ""contact us"" form does not work.  Somebody needs to give a makeover to Dean's Place overall.  Yes, their phone number is listed.  But I didn't want to call.

One last note.  My wife left her sweater in the restaurant.  As we were getting in the car, our server, Victoria, came running outside with it.  It's too bad Victoria doesn't run that restaurant.",KSntp6D7TVYThnwUDjKnYA,1,0,1,MmtLPSj568c_ClC49GZiPw

The service was a little slow but I think it's because there was only one server, which isn't her fault. Let's just say I feel I wouldn't go back unless someone wanted to treat me to dinner and they wanted to go...which is the reason I went back this time after not eating there for 4 years...its just okay and in this city that's not good enough.",AWjkzpWvoL0UAT55ldvBuw,0,0,2,a5KJePpCTjsFl8XxdIkhiw

The bar is centrally locates with a dining area on both sides that are separated so your not being smoked on as your eat.   If your hungry you must try some of the pasta plates, a big salad or The Godfather ribeye which is awesome.

5183837,2018-06-05,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"This is our first experience with Dean's Place. We placed an order for pick up. An order of Chicken Parmesan, an order of Tortellini and an order of Fettuccine Alfredo. It was completely wrapped up upon pick up. Styrofoam boxes were wrapped in saran wrap. Upon arriving home and opening the boxes we were appalled at the portion received for our order of fettuccine Alfredo. I am including a picture for your reference. We placed it on a salad plate just so your aware of the actual size if the plate. Are you kidding me? And of course its not like this place is close to home for us to turn around and go back. Also, they do not include a soup or salad with their entree meals. That would cost extra so you would think the portions of food would be appropriate to price. We will not be going back to Dean's Place. This was our first and last time ordering food from them.",CJuka8-Hh1iwqKtlxvF2iw,0,0,2,rsXa9ueV3opP1_4QoAddYA

The service was great. Our server Nicole was friendly, fast and made sure we were taken care of.
The negative.
I ordered the Ribeye. Asking if the steak was thin or thick. I prefaced that I did not want the steak over cooked so I asked for rare to medium rare as thin steaks cook fast. My steak came out medium to medium well.  It was tough, had grissle. 
The Caesar Salad was fair at best.

5454791,2012-09-19,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"I like to try new places and definitely ones that are not part of a national chain. We were craving Italian and find it oh so hard to find local/ mom & pop restaurants in town.  So we yelped a couple places nearby and decided on this one.  

We got there on the early side, around 1145 am, there wasn't really anybody here, YET. Sat in the non-smoking lounge that had plenty of Frank Sinatra on, tons of TV's, has a full bar, gaming, AND has an outside deck. Now there's not much to look at but when the weather gets nice I love to sit outside.  So far we were impressed.

Ordered Chicken Parm and my friend ordered meatball sub [under $10].  I started with Italian wedding soup [made with rice here not pasta] and it was very very good.  Chicken Parm was average, nothing to write home about, but wasn't bad by any means. Came with garlic bread and a huge side of pasta [and the soup] for $12.95.

Waitress was very funny pulled some jokes on us and was very attentive. Nice red-headed lady :). When we left there was about 5 other tables dining here and about 20 people up at the bar in the smoking room [aka it got pretty busy]. They have daily specials, graveyard specials, and a daily soup. 

Both of us agreed we'd go back.  It's easy to get to once you know where you are going, there's plenty of parking, it's reasonably priced, there's outside seating for nice days, and the music was very relaxing.

They also appear to be open 24/7 or dang near close to it",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,3,1,4,gMyt9BrS3GyZ25WG1Q27EA

I ordered a roasted red pepper chicken sandwich on ciabatta- it was soggy with grease from the 4 slices of melted cheese and did not taste at all good. The fries were even waaaay too greasy to eat.
It was made for a 280 lb alcoholic that only consumes food for the caloric value.

5607709,2018-02-09,0,KSRBPWOSqxclHkDd23P7CQ,"Garlic balls!   All I need to tell you is order the garlic balls.  They are tasty balls of bread sitting in a small pond of melted butter and enough garlic to combat an army of vampires.   I mean this is a super simple dish that is so satisfying.  

This is a gaming bar establishment with dining available on both sides of the enclosed bar area.  You have to deal with separate bills for food vs alcohol.   That is a small price to pay for solid food, some delightfully quirky servers and a very relaxed and laid back spot.  

Two of us had the Deans Burger and it was a proper burger.  Really enjoyed it and the side of fries.   The third member of our party ordered a pizza which was dispatched in short order.  We had a very chill dinner and left very relaxed and happy.   We will definitely return to Dean's Place because now it is one of our places!",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,1,1,4,5Z4Pvf7wAYhkXWIA3PD0Ww

I can't believe I wasted 80.00 for 4 people to eat. The pastas do not even come with a salad. They give dinner rolls instead of Italian bread. We will never return here. I will gladly pay $80.00 somewhere else like Bucca that has a real Italian menu with real Italian portions.,uwRd0buZlfjPWbmNK7kGhQ,0,0,2,M2uY7WoyCKh-9F21cWxaHQ

We have been here a bunch of times and have always enjoyed our dinners.
Everything we have ever ordered was really good,

My husband likes Italian food and he really enjoys the pasta dishes here as well as the bread they bring out.
Service is always really good too. They are always on top of everything,

There is a bar separated from the restaurant which is nice for anyone with a family that may want to go in,

No complaints and we would for sure go back.  Try it for yourself were sure you will enjoy!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,8,7,4,dMk1cDa2cyYyhuzSgXo0TQ

A large variety of seating options including patio, smoking bar, non-smoking bar, gambling, non gambling, and even take out. A menu that features Pizza burgers and pasta and probably the best breakfast on the southwest side of town, if not all of Las Vegas. This is a family style restaurant run by a core group of employees who might as well be married and part of a family together anyway they are so wonderful.

Although we were the only diners present at 6:30 p.m. on a Sunday night, the food was clearly freshly made, and quite well prepared.  Bacon-wrapped Shrimp dipped in Sweet Chili Sauce and triangles of Fried Mozzarella were nice starters, and Italian Wedding Soup with medium-sized rather than tiny meatballs was a suitable accompaniment.  Caesar Salad was good but desired anchovies were not available.  And garlic-supported Linguini & Clams was a fine finish, except I had to dodge two pieces of shell near the end.  

Service was quite attentive and friendly, and the informal dining room setting conducive to an enjoyable dining experience.  I expect to be back!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,20,13,4,aeh84JUgv0D4mQ5_wkYGDw
