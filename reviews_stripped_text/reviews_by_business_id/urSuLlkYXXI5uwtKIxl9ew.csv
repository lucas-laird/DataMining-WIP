For a seriously chocolaty experience, try the extra chocolate mocha...but remember it's EXTRA chocolaty.

For a more classic coffee drink, I have the flat white which comes in only one size: just right.  I began drinking these in Australia during the 80s, and they still taste just like I make them.

Joe's beans taste super fresh because they are day-to-day shipped from the roaster back in Cleveland.

 If there is any down side whatsoever about Joe's coffee, I wished there was an Italian or French roast, because the tasty medium roast it's just a bit light for my well seasoned taste buds.",hhYOs0L2G6AUq_HwXQEDPg,0,1,4,cOhtOr-P-SmfJ2tX7X5GnA

THINGS I'VE ORDERED MULTIPLE TIMES
* Violife Cheese Slices (cheddar is my fav)
* Vegan Fajita Pocket (so delicious and hearty)
* Vegan Banana Chocolate Scone With Cookie Butter Glaze (warning you will eat the whole thing in one sitting)

PROS
+ Everything I mentioned above was so yummy
+ Cute quiet place, I've seen a of couple small groups there for meetings
+ Staff is friendly and knowledgable

CONS
- They run out of the Violife cheddar cheese slices and fajita pockets so I usually call before I drive there to make sure it's in stock. 
- Their vegan menu is so good I wish they would have a larger selection. (Updated - I received a Yelp message from an employee there and she said they're working on expanding it so YAY!)

As I said above they do have a few great vegan items; however, I really hope they expand the vegan menu to include other creative bites. Either way, I love the few things I always order here and have yet to find anything close anywhere else.",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,2,1,4,2SpZ5jgU5hRTp-tNMbVcVA

Lee, behind the counter was very helpful, giving me the lay of the land. The cold brew was great. It's very drinkable even at 24oz. My sandwich was terrific. It's completely customizable; you pick the bread, cheese, egg and protein. It's also under $5 and filling. 

Overall I feel like this is a great coffee shop if you like great coffee with an unpretentious vibe. If you're looking for that overly hip and overly artisanal thing, well, this place has a drive-thru, so it's probably not for you.

First we thought they were closed as it was dark inside but there were a couple people inside once we went in, they had a whole area closed off by yellow tape--Christmas tree had an accident is my guess.

I had looked at the menu online and decided I would try the Bumblebee but when we got there, that was not on the menu so the girl who was very nice and helpful upon hearing it was our first time there suggested some holiday drinks.

My ex tried a campside marshmallow hot chocolate drink, he said it was good but not very hot and he wanted hot...

I ordered pecan pie frapp (all drinks can be made hot or cold)    But it was just OK-No real depth of flavor.   

Pros are that they had some Vegan products, The Beyond Meat burger is on the menu and thats something for me to try next time I am there and they had Violife cheese which I have never seen in Vegas at all.

Im not Vegan but I was going through a 90 day Vegan challenge a while back and it really changed my perspective around and now I just want to try Vegan food whenever I have the chance.

It's a sweet vanilla latte with ground cinnamon which is not overpowering at all. Before you run for hills, you should know I am not even a huge cinnamon fan. I don't even love cinnamon rolls! This concoction is just the right mixture of vanilla to cinnamon. Unfortunately for me, I am on a diet and delicious blends like this can't be my go to anymore. 
Exploring other options on the Joe Maxx menu today did not disappoint. I tried a hot rose tea and the smell alone was intoxicating. It is loose leaf and it comes out right away, where they inform you to let it steep (mine was for about four minutes because it was a black tea). The rose taste was subtle which is perfect for my taste. I like this tea on its own I couldn't imagine how amazing it would taste as the base for a latte.  

The ambience is nice. It's a slow and relaxing place where both unwinding and working seem to be live in harmony. I've never seen it packed. As I write this there are four other people here enjoying the brews. The music isn't too loud which I really appreciate. I hate it when stores blast their music. OH! Two more people just walked in. Six customers here now - seven including myself. The wood accents on metal chairs and counters really give it a clean, open, modern feel. 

I'm a fan! I will be back. This hidden gem is so perfect I can hardly believe it is a chain. I'm glad they came over from the east coast and gave Vegas a shot!",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,10,7,5,KZwnvCFAnARm7YYWM7lqew

On my first visit I literally left double fisting two coffee drinks, I was wired all day. I had the Kiki Aloha which is a salted caramel iced latte with coconut. I couldn't turn that down it had salted caramel and coconut enough said. I'd order it again. I don't remember what the other drink was but it could've been the Jamaican Me Crazy. The name sounds like something I would order.
 
If you're a peanut butter cup fan the Black & Tan is going to be your drink. Hot mocha with peanut butter. Occasionally you're going to have to stir the cup cause it seems like the peanut butter will form at the bottom of the cup. 

The rest of their drinks menu includes a few more hot and cold drinks, even frappes, teas, and smoothies. There's a lot syrups and sauces you can add to your drinks like butter pecan, cinnamon, peppermint paddy, dark chocolate, etc.  Be on the lookout for their seasonal drink. In December they had a variety of peppermint drinks and an eggnog drink. I had the candy cane latte. Right now they have a butterbeer latte, a firecracker spice white mocha, and a few more.

They have a comfy couch don't be surprised if it's already taken when you come in, board games like scrabble and sorry, plenty of seats, and even a drive-thru for those in a hurry which ain't me. I don't even remember when's the last time I've used a drive-thru anywhere.

And so you know I've only used the free small coffee Yelp check-in offer only once. Come on what kind of person do you think I am!? Though I don't think there are any rules about not using them EVER SINGLE TIME.

In fact, they handed my partner her chai latte w/o a straw and we finally asked. Frustrating. Just wanted to sit down to a hot bold cup of Jo.

Great VEGAN menu for a coffee shop. For a sweet tooth I particularly like the Cookiebutter Toast. They also have a very tasty Beyond Burger if you are hungry for something more substantial.

Specialty drinks are great options to get, like the black and tan (rich mocha steamed with creamy peanut butter) or Kiki aloha (salted caramel iced latte with a coconut kick). I don't like milk and only drink almond milk when I have to, so I love that they have coconut milk as an alternative.

What separates this coffee shop from most others around town is their pastry program. Made in-house, their options are plentiful with quite a few vegan items, too. But, if they offer to heat up something for you, just say no. I made the mistake of saying yes and they microwaved my nutella croissant, rendering it a soggy, limp mess.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,7,4,vJaqT4U6yXM6uk3p01hqqg

Rishi, one of the really talented bakers here at Joe Maxx Coffee, comes up with some tasty treats. There's a bit of something for everyone including more than one vegan option. I recently arranged a ladies brunch here at Joe Maxx Coffee and they were great about reserving us tables/chairs. I'm not sure however they were prepared to serve our large group even though this was scheduled well in advance and I kept in touch with them as a courtesy so they would know how large my group would be. I was assured the large group would be fine, and all in all it was, but some orders were forgotten and that meant some people had to wait even longer for their food and or drink to be made. Staff was apologetic and I do appreciate the effort made to correct things. 

Joe Mocha Maxx ($5.50 large) The menu says this drink is loaded with chocolate and all the caffeine you'll need. My taste buds were really stretching to find that chocolaty flavor. It was more of just a regular mocha than anything with super chocolate flavor. 

Black and Tan Frappe ($5 large) - Mocha steamed with peanut butter. If you like peanut butter this is the drink for you. It can be made hot or cold. Really delicious peanut butter flavor and something I'd order again. 

Blueberry Cheese Danish ($3) - This is actually what I came here to try and was lucky enough to grab the last one out of the case for the day. You can have the pastries warmed up if you'd prefer. I loved every single bite of this blueberry treat! Definitely worth trying if they aren't sold out already. 

Chocolate Nutella Croissant ($3) Good amount of chocolate inside, flaky and delicious. 

They have a lot of breakfast items, but they do have wraps and some other savory baked treats that are worth checking out.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,61,59,4,Mr48HSFH-2JKaRtqY4lzow

The wrap had a lot of flavor, and the pesto adde a nice flavor and moisture to what can sometimes be a dry meat (turkey).

I ordered the caramel spiced cider in hot with whip cream. An interesting flavor-- you can definitely taste the caramel mixed with strong apple cider so it definitely requires a certain type of person's taste buds to handle it well. 

My friend got the caramel macchiato and was able to finish it with ease. This place is fairly good for relaxing and having small morning conversations as the cafe music echoing in the background isn't so overbearing.

The baristas are welcoming, informative and convivial when I specifically wanted a non-coffee drink that isn't overly sweet nor bitter. I have yet to try out the majority of their menu (their vegan items have me curious), but lets just say on first impressions they had me sold.

The Big Joe Maxx Breakfast Sandwich caught my attention. It was a build your own sandwich with your choice of meat, bread, egg, and cheese. I went for scrambled eggs, bacon, and pepper jack on a croissant. It was very good. It made for a deliciously filling breakfast.

If you're vegan, their options are phenomenal. Their walls are decorated with lots of awesome (local!) art work. The spot is pretty quiet (which I enjoy, because I like my quiet coffee time). The wooden aspects are comfortable. Try the Vegan pockets. They are like little hot pockets of vegan-yumminess! Violife vegan cheese, peppers and ""chkn"" sometimes they have the sausage one. They are warm and flaky and to die for! I always get the dirty iced chai with almond milk. The Caramel Macchiato is also yummy but a tad bit on the sweeter side. Their smoothies are also delish.

4610245,2018-07-01,0,urSuLlkYXXI5uwtKIxl9ew,We have been here twice and have been disappointed both times. The first time we ordered a cinnamon roll and they forgot it. The second time we went we told the drive thru worker what we wanted and then get up to the window and within about 5 seconds he already forgot what we ordered and had to ask again. We get our drinks and our frappe is extremely watered down. The ICED americano had no ice and was warm. Then we get the receipt and they decided to double charge us. So watered down drinks for double the price...that's great. I wouldn't recommend this place. Just go to Dutch bros right next to it. Way better and they get the order right and don't water down your drinks to save money.,Uc_n9n_ikrmLdRs5ch8UXw,0,0,1,UxEG8TaxlEqr_NpiF3wb0A

Especially a new one. 8:45am arrived. Only one in line, a few guests already served and sitting. The cashier, though very nice, tell me it will be a minute. Fine I can use a minute, I'm new here. About 8 minutes later he tells me ""I have a huge order to put in for the Doctor.""  Ok. So just about 15 minutes later ""OK what can I get you?""  I order a drink off the menu and a croissant. Easy!  I sat down. Now others have come in and ordered. They get there croissants, rolls and what ever food they ordered immediately. 9:15 my coffee is on the bar. I ask for my croissant. And please make it to go, because now my extra time to enjoy the coffee was taken up by the waiting for the coffee. Which was just OK!  And the croissant was cool.

I happen to be in the area looking for a new coffee spot that might have cold brew and luckily they do. They have nitro cold brew on top of that. Great.There were plenty of workers and all were helpful answering my questions about what sweetener and creamers they have. Even informed me that if I added creamer to nitro brew it would curdle, so best to use almond milk instead. Good to know! They only have one size for the nitro brew and it's 16 ounces, which is fine by me. Drink came up fast and it was really smooth. Price was comparable to what I have paid at other places about $4 to $5. There was also some unique artwork on the walls and they were availble for sale. There were some muffins and wraps in a case, so if you needed a quick bite with your drink that would be availble. It looked ok. The condiment section was kinda high up for me, but I managed to reach for some napkins that was placed in the far back if I tip toed. Overall, clean shop, good nitro coffee, and good service.

Ok so my coffee order was the Black & Tan. Good Lord have mercy it was unbelievable. It's their peanut butter latte and I substituted coconut milk and was completely blown away! By far one of the best coffees I've ever had.  I dont care or wanna know the calories bc to me it was worth every sip.

Although where one lives determines many things, where they come from cannot be changed, and although many may feel that Ohio and the surrounding states are little more than 'fly-over' country The Heart of it All actually contains a lot of passion and the roots of several national brands, the recent expansion of Youngstown's Joe Maxx Coffee Company to Florida and the Southeast Corner of Las Vegas bringing the legend of a World War Two Era Pilot to a city where a good 'cup of Joe' remains scarce in all corners.

Now open for just under five months and slowly spreading the word by way of little more than word of mouth, a location near the original Bachi Burger and daily hours from 6:30am to 6:30pm plus a drive through generating a fair amount of traffic, it was just past 8:00am on Saturday that the front doors of the spacious shop decorated by local artists was entered, the vibe cool and casual with clean lines and a lot of white plus some comfortable looking couches alongside a handful of chairs and tables.

Playing everything from ambient modern rock to classics like My Girl at a low level, the smell of coffee and baked goods hanging in the air, it was after a brief chat about life back in the Midwest with a General Manager from the original store that the Las Vegas expansion was explained by the fact that one of the original investors was based out of Henderson, while the store's good fortune in finding former Mothership Intern Rishi Stocks to reinvent the bakery was described as ""an accident, she found us"" - and that is most certainly a good thing.

Using Beans roasted in nearby Cleveland, several Organic Free-Trade Origins forming blends used to make everything from Drip to Cold Brew and Nitro, plus several Lattes and Frappes, it was with both a Toddy-based pour over on Ice plus the Cinnamon-rich White & Dirty in hand that a table was located, Ms. Stocks and another man bringing out seven of the scratch-baked Pastries with the Manager quick to follow offering a sample of the indulgent Peanut Butter and Dark Chocolate thickened Frozen Black and Tan.

Impressed by the quality of the Cold Brew, a clean blend that starts strong but finishes fruity, while both the Frappe and hot Latte are clearly well thought out despite not being too Espresso-forward, a focus on Pastries made by the self-trained young woman who states that she ""discovered my love for baking a couple years ago"" shows that with enough heart and effort one does not require a degree to make something delicious, the Broccoli, Chicken and Cheese smooth and creamy inside a flaky pastry shell that makes one wonder why there are so many lousy Pot-Pies in Las Vegas when a small Coffee Shop is already making something similar, and better.

Progressing through the selections slowly, a choice to focus on Fruit first leading to bites of a Lemon Bar that is welcomingly sweeter than many, though perhaps not as sour as it *should* be according to purists, Rishi's popular Blueberry-Raspberry Pie Bars made their return to the weekend menu with outstanding results, the juicy berries soaking into a thick crust without rendering it flaccid while the crumble on top was smooth, buttery and mellow.

Happy to see Scones featured at Joe Maxx, the time spent with Beth Ryan-Small in Henderson hopefully paying dividends as the unique collection of flavors at Mothership continues to set a high bar for the rest of Sin City, Rishi's version is scaled down to about half the size and more focused on traditional ingredients without being any less delicious, certainly not the dry versions that require Clotted Cream and Jam over in England, but rather a hefty sort of pasty offered with Blueberries or Chocolate Chips that eats akin to a French Financier.

Acknowledging that things were about to get rich, the use of Nutella rarely subtle, it was with water replacing Coffee that a fork and knife were used to pierce the golden shell forming an arched cavern around a dense center of the Chocolate-Hazelnut Spread, each bite from beginning to end growing a little more filling while the Bacon-layered Twist took very slightly different approach that almost seemed as if it was made of Phyllo Dough, tiny flakes raining down with each bite from the lengthy stick that is equal parts sugary and savory.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,4,DVWpKZShUN2P8EmorWO65g

5708082,2017-03-06,1,urSuLlkYXXI5uwtKIxl9ew,"We stopped by this coffee shop while we were on vacation and it was definitely our favorite. Here's our top 3 reasons:
1. The shop itself - super cute set-up and design with lots of natural lighting making it very bright and welcoming. Also, great use of subway tile! There was a ton of seating mixed with cafe tables, a larger table near the back, and a couch area for lounging. 
2. Customer service - the barista was super helpful and recommended drinks for us. Ended up talking to the owner who was super sweet, helpful, and knowledgeable about his coffee.
3. The coffee itself - I am not a normal coffee drinker, we normally go for my husband whose an addict but we both found a drink we both loved. In fact, we grabbed 3 bags to take back home. 


Definitely would recommend as a great place to stop by, hang out, or even get some work done.",xvtb35uBwzNC8IhKUZctNQ,1,3,5,SoyOAiVu7nQyhPv5k7ii7g

The dessert was pretty amazing, however I have gone on two separate occasions to try there vegan fajita pockets and both times they were sold out. I went at 9:30am so I guess they sell out quiet early ;(",KzG_6Aq-nz0nwgisf1EdTA,0,0,4,hKLX1prXk1DWxnNPmrx0SQ

This place has such cute decor and their staff are sweet and helpful. I believe the art on the walls were by local artists so that was cool to see. It was nice seeing the local side of Vegas away from all the glitz and glamour. The food was great too!",FlBh6GwSb_L7DH-LBUaMJw,0,0,4,Vh2xn_3h2wHgSUrD3ZcwOw

Most of the pastries are vegan and made in store, which I love. The wraps are the size of a Chipotle burrito, and I definitely wasn't expecting that. Efficient and excellent customer service, Emerald and Joey are my favorite employees. They act like everyone there is family and take the time to actually talk to you and get to know you. Did I mention they sell quiche as well? That's another thing that I love. Free wifi and music isn't as loud as Starbucks is.",PFs0_lUg6NlQvwdjnqZhUg,1,0,5,GPbw696nyjqyluiFTsftVA

They have plenty of options here not to mention all the yummy food options. The coffee is mild tasting yet surprisingly strong. Will have to ask for one shot next time.

you an arm and a leg for their goods. Everything is freshly made and imported. You have to try their ghost pepper cheese on a sandwich. It's so delicious! Be warned, it's not for mild lovers...",QVdnSGbmbe_lm_epFvQDBg,0,0,5,pYWlkPS45IbHZOlP6nXJ-g
