721428,2013-05-26,0,zwddv6HjTjDx9fOr3MFtwQ,"I wasn't really bothered when the host that sat us, also turned out to be our server.  It really didn't phase me when our order came out at two different times, four minutes apart.  I can't say that it chapped my ass when I realized our server/host, hadn't introduced himself, nor seemed to concern himself with asking how our food was until, our dining experience was nearly complete.  My party and I, were hungry, and had waited a half an our for the joint to open at 4PM.  We had just finished having a great time, and lots of laughs at Jeff Civillico's Comedy in Action show.  So, we were all in a great mood.  The little stuff wasn't really bothering me, or my party.

However, after the food did arrive, and my taste buds were left wanting something that had some taste, I began to feel disappointed.  It was further excruciating when I had to wait an undo amount of time for a check.  Then once the check arrived, the rest of my party left the table to wait outside of Quesadilla's.  Meanwhile, five plus minutes later the server/host, who clearly had a nice smile, but zero service skills finally retrieved my credit card so I could finally put Quesadilla, and it's bland food behind me.

In retrospect, after mulling over the bland taste of my sizzling chicken fajitas, I can see why the host/server decided not to ask how our food was until it had passed our lips and found it's way toward our gullets.  I understand that places like Quesadilla's do not require the need to build a local base with excellent service or tasty food, but it would be nice to see an effort.  Tourists beware, if you want something much more delicious, you may want to Yelp around a bit before entering this particular joint!",YT4bQTrmqAkVFWcGefxnkw,1,0,1,9FUcHHwb6xDQkXmaJH9stw

On the 5th floor, there are two restaurants, one Korean/Chinese/Japanese and one that serves Mexican/Southwestern. After having dined at the Asian restaurant, decided to give this place a try since I stayed at the QUAD and after a long hard work day, didn't feel like heading out for dinner. Service is friendly but the food is a hit or a miss. Drinks are pretty good and strong. My frozen margaritas were good but some were 'over-frozen' meaning it was difficult to drink if off the straw. Food is not bad and inexpensive for the amount of food you get. Appetizers are Entree portions so be careful!! 
I would definitely skip the Carnitas (it was VERY BLAND and DRY!!!) and the Fish Tacos (I was thinking some Ceviche Style Fish but it was one piece of fried fish on a flour tortilla...BORING)

1331151,2011-09-21,0,zwddv6HjTjDx9fOr3MFtwQ,"During our trip to Vegas, my fiancee Alicia and I really wanted Mexican food quite badly, and we didn't want to pay out of the @$$ for it.  So we opted for Quesadilla in the imperial palace.

Armed with the negative reviews from Yelp, we proceeded with caution.  Upon sitting down in the restaurant, I noticed that one of my cardinal rules were violated.  (Rule #12 - Only eat in Mexican restaurants that display a crucifix and a likeness of ""our Lady of Guadalupe"", though rule #13 (silverware shouldn't match) is also good to observe in Mexican restaurants as well.)  So we ordered with caution.

""What would be hard to screw up?""  My clever fiancee asked me.  I looked back at her.  We immediately decided on passing on the Fajitas.  Instead, I opted for the cheese enchiladas and she opted for 3 ground beef tacos, which she asked for soft rather than hard.

We also got 2 $2.00 strawberry margaritas.  At first, I didn't taste any booze (there wasn't much) but I felt a bit of a kick later.

We then enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa.  They actually serve you both freshly made pico and salsa.  The salsa is underwhelming.  I'd skip it.  However, the pico was quite good, and reminded us of Chuy's back in Dallas.  And we love us some Chuy's.

The service was slow (especially since we were the only ones in the restaurant--we were there later than lunch diners usually eat), but not unresponsive.  When our food came out, it was warm.  Alicia's tacos were good, but I think I made the better decision.  The enchiladas weren't bad--they came with like a ranchero green sauce on one half of eacn enchilada, and almost a plum sauce (think: mole sauce) on the other side.  The beans were okay, but I was pretty hungry.  I didn't like the rice (though I don't usually eat my rice anyhow.)  Putting the pico (bite by bite) on my enchiladas provided an extra ""kick"" and further improved the dish.

Anyhow, could have been much worse, though I would recommend going to a Tickets 4 Tonight counter and paying $2.00 to get half off your check prior to dining here.",fiDcrSANmmljv-6nl_gPtQ,0,0,3,yYFI0jkf78rXCgss-XLqNg

I'm a sucker.

The eye candy factor of hot waitresses in low cut outfits & push up bras is dulled by them spending more time gossiping with each other than checking on your table. The service totally sucked.

The food? Meh. I didn't finish my chicken burrito because they did a lousy job of cleaning the meat off the bones and almost every mouthful left me picking cartilidge out of my mouth. Even if I were totally hammered, I wouldn't eat here again. It was that bad.

And the primary reason for trying to eat at the IP was because I figured it would be cheap. Wrong again. Totally overpriced. Save your money and walk past the dump that is the IP.",VzlX5LJ7__pl6AaBWBiw9w,1,0,1,F7ZbtXzC5QhMTLFw4zOn7Q

The food here was nothing special.  The establishment was clean and there was no wait.  The portions were very generous.  The specials were the quesadillas.  I got the loco loco.  It came stuffed fat with plenty of meat and cheese.  It was good, not great but not bad either.  Just good.

There is complimentary salsa and tortilla chips.  The chips were good, it came out warm and very crispy.  The salsa was just salsa.  Nothing extra tasty or special.  Seemed a bit dry to me.

They had $1 margaritas.  For $1 what can you expect right.  

Overall this place really is not that great or special.  The portions are big and the service was very good, but that is about it.
