The lower level is the gift shop which you have to walk thru to get up to the restaurant (of course). There's a patio with the view of the strip which was pretty nice and the waiter was good. The appetizer was awesome, we ordered the bubba far out dip (tortilla chips & spinach roasted bell pepper, artichoke and jack cheese). We had the seafood trio and surf & turf entrees, both dishes were too salty and the steak was a little overcooked. The fizzy fun and frozen lemon-ups beverages were awesome and we got to keep the glass. Overall, for the price we paid, we were disappointed and expected more. Will I go back?

My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Again, we are not food snobs and this was the first place we ate in the day. I'm gonna assume it was the dip that did us in.

433221,2013-06-19,2,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"I've experienced Bubba Gumps once before coming to this one. When I heard Planet Hollywood was opening one I couldn't contain myself. The first thing you have when you enter is a souvenir shop which makes sense since there are a ton of tourists wandering the streets. you have to go upstairs to go to the actual restaurant. The walls are covered in Forest Gump memorabilia which makes it dangerous as you're walking up the stairs if you can't multi task.

Once we made it to the top the host asked whether we wanted to be seated inside, outside or at the bar. We chose outside and glad we did the view is AWESOME! Fast forward to ordering our food; our waiter was very helpful with explaining anything we had questions about and even offered suggestions. Most of the best tasting drinks come with a souvenir cup.

 We ordered a bucket of shrimp, half Cajun half garlic & butter, they dumped it out on a giant platter so you can grub away. Be careful though it can get messy. We also ordered lobster stuffed shrimp on top of jasmine rice. It was very oily but when something is smothered in butter what can you expect. It mixed well with the rice. Couldn't finish everything so we took a to go box and our souvenir cups all for $75. A bit expensive but i'm sure it would have been cheaper without the cups. Overall great service, food and great time.",rb7pDkz38_75prVDsGJAvQ,3,2,4,qRTzsRrTvr3Ubst2NmIsFw
439886,2014-04-29,0,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"So let me just start off by saying that we love Bubba Gumps. We've gone to different locations and have had great experiences every time...except for this one. The restaurant wasn't very crowded. There was no wait, but we got seated in the very back room all by ourselves. Felt a little out of place and ignored. That was strike one. 

Strike two was when we ordered. I wanted a dish that came with tilapia and just wanted a different fish like salmon or mahi mahi. Most places would say ""sure no problem"" but our waitress said ""nope. We can't do that."" Imagine my shock when a restaurant can't do a simple switch like that. It took several tries of me asking her to please go double check with the chef before she finally went to ask. She came back and what do you know...""oh okay we can switch that for you"". It's just very irritating when a restaurant makes it seem like a hassle to do something simple for a paying customer. 

After that whole incident I had asked for a comment card...and guess what. They don't have any. Of course they don't have any. So that's why I'm writing this here.

All in all food wasn't anything special and service sucked. Our food was cold when it came out and they just dropped it off without a word. There are so many options on the strip and you can find something a lot better!

-I did not know that at this location you had to pay for drink refills. My first cup strawberry lemonade had an average amount of ice in it, so I was not complaining, but my second cup but literally a whole cup of ice. Why I had to pay $.99 for that, I don't know.

868360,2018-01-22,0,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"Went to Bubba Gump on a Saturday night. It wasn't as busy as I had expected it to be. We used to always go to the one in Hawaii and I was craving their Hush Puppies (which btw is to die for). I've always loved Bubba Gump. It's cool how this entire restaurant is based off of the movie Forest Gump. 

Anyways, the food selection didn't seem like there was as much as the menu in Hawaii. We mainly came for the Seafood Harvest but unfortunately it wasn't on their menu. 

We ordered the Calamari for appetizers, Run Across America Sampler (as a meal), and the Trio for our entree. All three tasted pretty good and were up to our expectations on taste. 

The service was mediocre. Nothing exceptional but not bad either. Our waitress was nice for the most part. There were a few times that it was hard for us to get her attention, let alone any otter waiter/waitresses attention, but we'll give them a pass since there were 3 birthdays while we were dining there. 

Overall, I'd go back again. I wouldn't NOT recommend this place because it definitely hits the spot if you're looking for seafood on the strip with a very minimal to no waiting line.",0LpzYL0oNrsurPokNSnQxA,0,0,3,I5RSf07sxU2Hha6v5H762w

Started with the Hush Puppies, which were amazing (and came with a terrific dip); then did the Po Boy with Shrimp. Definitely not bad - the bread was a bit tough and the Mayo didn't quite stand-up to the other ingredients, but overall was still pretty good.

Drinks were ordered and appetizers too I ordered a dip and my friend did too. Drinks come and appetizers too by a different server who brings us out two of the same appetizers. So we stated that we didn't order two of the same things. She states that ok no problem and then our waitress comes up to us and says rudely ""Didn't you order the dip that you sent back"" We attempted to tell her that we didn't want two of the same appetizers and she walked off with a attitude and service went down from there. We had to ask for togo boxes and the check from someone else due to the fact we couldn't find her again. Once the the check came she split the tab which was not asked if we wanted it that way.

1056653,2015-09-10,0,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"I'm a local in Las Vegas and I went here after spending the day with my friend who came down for the Labor Day weekend and I always wanted to try the place. I love seafood and when I worked at Marshalls just a few blocks away one of my customers said to try the place if you want good seafood. The prices are great for the average seafood place. It's very lively there was two birthdays when we went which was a cute birthday song.

The service was good aside from when the waiter came over to do Forest Gump trivia he kept staring at him while my friend was with me at the table. It was a little unnerving to have him staring at me like that.

The food was okay but wasn't the greatest. I ordered the ship wreck platter and the crab was sweet as crab usually is, the breaded shrimp was delicious, the fries were great except for the misleading bucket it all came in, and sadly the battered fish was a let down as I love battered shrimp it lacked seasoning to it. The side coleslaw and the butter, didn't bring out the taste of the crab, wasn't that great either. My friend ordered their trio appetizer plate and she said it was good but the fish was overcooked for her liking. 

The alcohol was very overpriced too but what do you expect from a restaurant on the strip except it cost a meal to have one.",s7tfEaZHnJ_KTTaNCQ7SXw,0,0,3,l0-YBeSLlxj8NjgxiRc-tA
1069141,2013-01-16,12,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"My momma always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""

Well, no... actually Forrest Gump said that. MY momma always said, ""For God's sake, Ryan, why can't you put down that Nintendo controller and play outside with the rest of the NORMAL kids? And what the hell are you wearing all that TINFOIL on your head for?""

No, Forrest Gump was the one who talked about chocolates, and Bubba always talked about shrimp, hence, we now have the chain of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants. They're all over in touristy spots, and the Seestur raves about the one in Anaheim in Gardenwalk. She even sports the sweatshirt proudly. This from a girl who would practically retch if she even got near seafood.

So boy, howdy, was I excited to see that there was going to be a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. on the Las Vegas Strip. So excited, that I didn't even care it was located mere steps from the horrifying (to me) Goretorium. I was going to brave the danger and go to Bubba Gump, and if one of the evil scary monsters from Goretorium and/or one of the sleazy porno-card giver-outers on the corner of Harmon and the Strip came after me, well, by God I would buy fresh boxers from the Bubba Gump store.

If life is like a box of chocolates, I should have tried poking the bottom of the candies before coming here. I got stuck with that one everyone else dodges. You know, the one with the pink cream-ish center that's supposedly cherry or raspberry but tastes more like Pepto Bismol.

Las Vegans hardly need a reason to celebrate but we find them anyway, and as I had just been unceremoniously and hurriedly booted out the door by my former employer, ironically who stood across the street from Harmon Corner and rhymed with ""Bosmopolitan,"" I decided to have a little ""New Beginnings/I Got Fired"" dinner at Bubba Gump's.

Figuring I was the last one there (as I usually am) and not wanting a demon to jump out of the Goretorium and eat my soul, I asked one of the store clerks, ""So... I'm in the store... but where's the restaurant?"" She smiled and directed me up the stairs toward the back of the store. A sign or something would have been nice.

I headed up the stairs, where I was actually first, gathered the party, and we were seated. They explained the license plates on the table that say ""Run, Forrest, Run!"" and ""Stop, Forrest, Stop!"" which I thought was a cute touch.

The crew was stellar. Our main waitress was super bubbly and thrilled when she heard we were all locals (like, apparently they had not been frequenting the place... what a shock no locals on the Strip). She was very attentive to our needs, to the point where we never really needed our ""Run/Stop"" plates on our table. She even regaled us with ghost stories in nearby mining towns. So despite whatever else I say in this review, the staff was great and should be commended.

And with that being said... well... 

We started with a round of drinks. Since it was my firing party, I was ready for something nice and strong, so I went with Bubba's Blue Hawaiian: vodka, rum, gin, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Sierra Mist, yes, please, come to DADDY! The menu says $8.99, but don't be fooled! That doesn't include your collectible Bubba Gump glass, so you're more looking at $13. You have to specifically ask to NOT get the collectible glass, whereas I think it should be the other way around. But the drink was pretty good. Not quite an AMF, so it won't belt you on your ass, but not a totally tame drink either.

Dinner came around, and I have to say I was gravely disappointed with my dinner.  I got the Shrimper's Heaven, which along with french fries came with Fried Shrimp, ""Chilly Shrimp,"" Coconut Shrimp, and Shrimp Tempura, along with three sauces: Asian, cocktail, and a Cajun sauce that reminded me more of orange marmalade.

I started with the ""Chilly Shrimp,"" which I thought was just going to be cold shrimp like you might find in a shrimp cocktail. No, in fact, that is wrong. ""Chilly Shrimp"" is Bubba Gump's version of ""Peel-n-Eat Shrimp,"" which means the shrimp is cooked inside its shell. Yes, shrimp have shells, and shrimp have legs, which took that portion of the dinner from ""tasty seafood morsel"" to ""creature that used to be alive, probably leaving behind a family he supported and a shrimp company job that will have to do some PR work to explain his disappearance and he was probably named Charles."" I can't eat things that could probably be named Charles. So there's a quarter of the dinner shot down.

The rest was tolerable. The coconut shrimp and fried shrimp were kind of dry, but the shrimp tempura was fine.

What wasn't fine was the bill: for JUST that and the drink, after gratuity I was paying $55 BY MYSELF. People, I just got fired! Just because I was paid out my vacation pay doesn't mean I need to be spending it all on dinner! I'll stick with Lazy Joe's for some good, affordable shrimp from now on.

Our food was served in a timely manner, however in between our food being served the waitress made sure we were comfortable. Our food was exactly as she described. I ordered the shrimp and chicken jambalaya, it was awesome! If you like spicy food I definitely recommend. My mom ordered a shrimp dish that she enjoyed. However my sister ordered the lobster salad; the lobster was overcooked. The manager immediately took it off the bill when he learned that she was not satisfied with her food.

Flipped the sign to Stop Forrest Stop when ready to order and a server was with us within a minute. Ordered the Shrimper's Net Catch with half garlic and half Cajun. I personally preferred the garlic. I thought the Cajun was too saucy, but thankfully it wasn't too spicy. 

Also had Forrest's Surf and Turf as my main. It comes with a 9oz tenderloin, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and onions. It was food a plenty for me. The shrimps were my favourite in this meal. The meal wasn't 5 star spectacular, but it was a solid 4 in terms of taste and value.

Service is definitely top notch here with a casual atmosphere. Servers are prompt and kept us up to date with the orders.

There is only one way to have that dish- with garlic bread on the side. Peel em and layer them carefully on the bread.  Then dig in. It is the only way as I said and it is the Monica and Jonni way!  
The waiter we had saw us doing this last year,  and he has adopted our style too! We met him this year too.

1594726,2013-07-08,1,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"Had this restaurant bookmarked for some time now so we finally tried it for dinner last night.

Location - great view, but horrible to get to.  It is quite a far walk no matter where you are coming from.  You can either park in the garage in Miracle Mile shops, park across the street at Harley Davidson cafe (for a small price), or park at the Cosmopolitan and walk across the bridge.  The views, if you are sitting outdoors, is awesome!  The location is overlooking right in the middle of Harmon and LV blvd. which has the views of City Center and The Cosmopolitan.

Restaurant - Forrest Gump themed.  If you are a fan of the movie, you will appreciate the memorabilia all over the walls.  First floor is the retail area, Second floor is the actual restaurant.

Food - Overly priced small portions type of meals (what one should expect of a strip restaurant).  My boyfriend ordered 2 of what our server recommended which was the Georgia Sweet Tea (alcoholic drink) and the Shrimp New Orleans.  I ordered Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  I loved the sweet tea drink (again, it was a steep price for a small drink).  I didn't care for the sauce on the Shrimp New Orleans dish (even though the server raved about it).  All that matters is my boyfriend liked it.  The Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp dish was nothing out of the ordinary.  It was shrimp, sausage, mashed potatoes which shoestring chips on top.  I probably could have made this myself if I made the effort to.

Staff - friendly and attentive, but then again the restaurant wasn't that busy yet.  We did get a free glass at the end of our meal.  I didn't really catch the reason why, but I think it's because of the drink we ordered.

Honestly, I don't know if I can recommend this place mainly because of the price.  But if you are like me who has to try it just to say you tried it, live the experience..!",3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,2,1,3,Qtz8SoHXuXrRfwZvjnGjSg

The dining area is located one level up from the entrance filled with memorabilia and gift items.  We were luckily seated in Chad's section for our meal.   He definitely provided great service throughout the evening.  He was fun and very friendly.  

We started off with the Seafood hush pups that are filled with shrimp and fish.  Since we love hush puppies, this was right up our alley.   Very good with the remoulade dipping sauce.  For my entree I chose Jenny's catch.  This was seared tilapia over mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach covered with a lobster butter sauce.   Sounds good right? But it really lacked flavor.  The sauce was very mediocre.    

I tried my husbands meal which was Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  This was lots of shrimp mixed in with andouille sausage in a bourbon sauce.  This was fantastic.  Spicy and so delicious!

There are a lot of positive vibes with the friendly? staff and delicious food. 

I first had the jambalaya, which had chicken, shrimp, andouille sausage, bell pepper, onions, rice, green onions, tomatoes, and a decently spicy sauce. The jambalaya? was a savory dish, full of flavor and filled with tender meat. 

I also had the shrimp scampi, which had shrimp (of course), capers, and linguine (duh). This dish was rich and zesty with the lemon garlic butter that covers it. The shrimp was tender and good in size. It also went very well with the garlic bread that came on the side. You definitely? cannot go wrong with the shrimp scampi here. 

Additionally, I like how you can flip a sign indicating whether you need a waiter or you would like to be left alone. The sign worked well in the beginning, but towards the end of my dinner, it did not seem to do any good with getting help when needed. Maybe this was a one time deal, but it was still disappointing?.

2132532,2014-08-05,1,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"The bf and I were craving seafood on our last night in Vegas. Walking around the Miracle Mile shops, all the restaurants wanted to charge an obscene amount for seafood. In the end we found ourselves at Bubba Gump-- seafood craving satisfied, no wait time, wallet happy, and definitely buzzed.

I have to say Carlos really deserves this review. He was a great server, honest and to the point. For people like me who've never been to Bubba Gump, their menu is extensive and therefore a bit overwhelming. Carlos made some good suggestions based on customer favorites, as well as help us make a decision of Gumbo vs. Jambalaya. We went with the jambalaya. Best. Decision. Ever.

FOOD:
- Deep Fried Calamari w/ Red Bell Peppers and Pepperoncinis. Served with Dippin' Sauces. ($10.29) : The Calamari was good. Could do without the additional veggies, and they need to give more tartar sauce! [3.5/5]

- Jambalaya (Blackened Chicken, Shrimp and Andouille Sausage, sautéed with Bell Pepper, Onions, and Rice in Bubba's own Spicy Sauce. Topped with Tomatoes and Green Onions. $17.99): The portion is deceptively a fair amount. Initially we thought it was a bit small on the platter, but even my hungry boyfriend couldn't finish it. And it made the best drunken munchies later that night. The rice was spicy and creamy, all it needed was some baby scallops! [4.7/5]

-Jenny's Catch with Lobster Butter Sauce (Pan seared Tilapia laid over Mashed Potatoes with sautéed Spinach and a creamy Lobster Butter Sauce. 19.99) : SO GOOD. The fish was cooked beautifully and not overcooked like in most restaurants. There were two good sized fillets served with this dish. My only complaint was the mashed potatoes were a bit lukewarm/cold. The lobster butter sauce was fantastic. [4.5/5]

Trust me, if you're looking for seafood this place has it at the best prices (unless you're doing buffets). The restaurants in the Miracle Mile Shops next door in Planet Hollywood were charging anywhere from $28-$50 for seafood, not to mention tiny portions.

Our server was alright. There was a couple times where we couldn't find her but I'm thinking they were just understaffed that evening; it was during the holidays after all. When we were done with our meal, she seemed a little pushy on getting us to buy desserts even when we told her we were way too full and just wanted the check. She asked us to think about it and she'd come back. What the heck? Why can't you just bring the check? It seemed like she wanted us to give a definite answer of no before she was willing to print the check. Strike one.

When we finally received the check, we attempted to pay with an e-gift card that had $100 loaded on it and our meal was $91 including tax. When she brought the receipt for us to sign, she told us that we couldn't tip with the gift card and that we still had $8 or $9 remaining on the card, awesome...where's the gift card, could we have it back? The server refused and told us it was policy to keep our printed gift cards whether or not there was a remaining balance. WHAT? How does that even make sense? I will never be able to use the remaining balance then! We asked her to make a copy for us but she refused and told us to simply re-print one when we got home...problem is how do you do that when it was a gift and I already deleted the original e-mail?! No other business I've frequented has ever asked to keep a gift card, remaining balance or not without asking first if I wanted it back. She told me this is what her manager told her to do, which didn't really help the situation. I considered not leaving a tip since I just lost 9 bucks but ended up leaving a decent one and decided to take it up with management at a later date since it wasn't her fault and she was just doing what she was instructed to do.

I e-mailed the company about a week later and complained about my remaining balance that was lost because I was unable to get my gift card back and 2 days later received a phone call from one of the managers of the Vegas location. She stated that it was company policy to do this and the server indeed followed protocol. I was really angry and got in a heated argument with the manager about the policy since it doesn't really protect them from anything, while making it super inconvenient for customers and discourages them from buying and using gift cards. It wasn't the 9 bucks that I cared about, but the principle of what was going on that seemed fraudulent to me. I got nowhere with management and she continued to tell me that it was corporate policy. Ok, I guess I'll have to contact them to get more info then.

Then we contacted corporate customer service and was told that this was NOT corporate/company policy in any way, shape or form and that the store was mistaken and they weren't sure why. They ended up sending us a new link to re-print our gift card with the remaining balance and informed us that we would be receiving a phone call apology from the General Manager once they contacted him about the situation.

All in all, Bubba Gump Las Vegas is run by liars and they did nothing but inconvenience my family and then lie to me about it to back up their side of the story. It will take a lot for me to come back here in the furture, if I ever do. Just thinking about it gets me fired up and angry. I really hope they go out of business some day when this all catches up to them!

I haven't had this problem with any restaurant on the vegas strip. I'm sorry I won't order your $6 drink but would rather order your $25 entreé. Will never return to any of their restaurants due to the way this was handled. I was told to finish my drink before they closed in an hour & would be served then.

This now means 2 things, I can no longer eat you in Cali, because it's against the rules being that you're an official Vegas restaurant now. Second, you decorated well, but maybe you should have stayed in Cali. I liked you better there. 
I was super hyped up when I heard the news that my city was getting a Bubba Gump. I have dined at both the Santa Monica and Anaheim locations in the past and always loved it. Fried Chicken, shrimp bloody marys, and cajun shrimp. YUMMMMM!
My boyfriend and I waited to go with our friends Mario and Sonya. They were always who we went with in Cali so it just made sense that we check out the new location together. I am in there looking like a tourist. It is set up so you enter through a gift shop, go up stairs and wait for a hostess. It looks just like all the other locations with great Forrest Gump decor. Everyone was super welcoming and friendly. 5 stars for service all around. Again as a tourist I asked to sit on the patio. It was about 9:30pm so the heat was dying down. We ordered a sampler appetizer that came with seafood hush puppies, chicken, fried shrimp, and shrimp cocktail and a pound of cajun shrimp. To me, the cajun shrimp were the highlight of the entire night. 
Mario and I ordered the bucket of trash which is a little of everything. Crab, fish, shrimp. It was average. Not amazing but not bad. My boyfriend had fish and chips which he didn't like, and Sonya had fried chicken, which again was average. Disappointed in average fried chicken because I know its above average in Cali. 
Now I understand when going to a seafood restaurant you should expect to pay $20 a plate. Especially on the strip. But oh boy do they rape you on the drinks. $4 sodas and $9 lemonades!?! And they charge for refills?! $160 seemed a little rough for 4 people. But maybe I am just not use to paying attention to the price cuz I am usually on vacation while dining here.

As expected, since it is located on the second/third floor of Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, the location gets great foot traffic from people on the strip or those coming from the bridge from the Cosmopolitan or Crystals/Aria. The retail store has all sorts of neat shirts, accessories and souvenirs and you have to go up the stairs to access the restaurant section. My eye caught the Stupid is as Stupid Does Shirt!

Since I was on a lunch break I did not take long and went to the bar. 

The only TVs I saw were at the bar and I did not see any in the regular dining area so I for now, I do not believe this is a good spot to try to catch any game; only come for the fish and shrimp dining!

I asked the bartender's recommendation and went with a cup of Mama Blues Shrimp Gumbo. He explained the gumbo as having worchestire sauce in it with a little kick and I like that sauce in my marinades so I was sold.  Surely enough, there was a little spice but 

The main course I ordered was the accidental fish/shrimp. This was a broiled mahi mahi with jasmine rice, grilled shrimp that came with a side of lemon butter with roma tomatoes. I've had freshly caught mahi mahi in Hawaii so I have a high standard when it comes to this fish. The one they served came very close but not quite that standard. It was a generous portion and came with some shrimp which I thought could have been bigger. 

The price of the meal was kind of high as well but that's what's expected from restaurants on the Vegas strip. This was a great experience and hopefully I'll buddy up with one of the staff there to come back in and get a discounted hookup. lol.",RSLTG7N0wYJhRTW5CGEm5Q,3,1,4,IDckALsH_kbMGjzjbZfaKw

As we ventured out on our night which he had decided on walking around and eating to wherever calls us...he said...""Hey, there's a Bubba Gump's here!"" I look over to see he's on Yelp! 
I said, ""You know what, I could go for some Gump's!"" And away we went!
The line was non existent and the restaurant had some open tables. We were behind a larger group, both of us asking for outdoor seating... Without asking if we wanted to wait, we were immediately sat in the dining room while the larger group was taken outside.

The first thing I noticed was the smell and look of a new building, thats always a plus. They have plenty of space there and the design worked with the location hovering over the strip. The interior stayed true to the theme of the restaurant.

We had a great waitress, I forgot her name but it was evident she enjoyed her job and was truly happy to work there. 

The gumbo, EXCELLENT. Even the waitress said ""Bet you wish you ordered the large"". LOL. I had the cup. Beautiful arrangement and quite a bit of sausage and fish. I destroyed it in about 5 minutes. I recommend anyone reading this to try it. 

Had the seafood feast, The fish and shrimp, very tasty. Light and with flavor and not that heavy grease aftertaste as you would have in some places. Seasoned just right. Now some would say that it didn't have enough seasoning to the batter but I think it is just enough to where you don't overwhelm the taste of the actual fish and shrimp.  Try it. I would recommend trying every incarnation of shrimp they serve. I have my sites set on the Shrimpers feast next..

Cloe slaw- cut fresh as you order it, not drenched in mayo. +5

Only thing the jury is out on, and probably because of my own tastes...the hush puppies. I like the more flavorful ones,like at Long John Silvers...if you try both you'll know what I mean. But not work deducting a star, When your main course is good, who cares about the side piece.

Several of us ordered top shelf margaritas and they were okay, but didn't taste too shelf. The plastic shaker they were in leaked and our hands were sticky, so the design wasn't good. 2 members got a ""free"" cup with their drink, but it wasn't explained they had to take their receipt to the lobby to get it, so that took time waiting for the cup that wasn't coming (check your bag they hand you if you get this because one of the gals only got the shaker lid and not the actual cup. 

Our main complaint was that management didn't seem to care about the ""missing in action"" food and wasn't proactive in letting us know it was being taken care of. When we complained, management (?) sent us a beautiful complimentary dessert tray. Unfortunately we had already said we did not want dessert. We really wanted our check and to leave because we had been there for so long. It took forever to get the checks (the checks were split. I honestly don't know if the server was told when we placed orders we wanted to split the checks and I understand it takes longer to do that after the fact, but 30 minutes? We were sitting outside freezing. It took a good 40-45 minutes from the time we said no dessert to the time we got our checks and got out of there. I believe they took an appetizer off of someone's bill and took something else off another persons bill (I don't know what).  The ""missing meal"" should have been free and a free appetizer and no dessert should have been sent (a nice gesture but we honestly wanted to leave and it just extended the time we were sitting there waiting for the checks, so it wasn't something that made the situation better, unfortunately).

Food was generally decent, drinks were overpriced for what you got but the service killed the experience. The ""run forest run/stop forest stop"" plaques sitting at the table that indicate to servers and management something is needed did NOT seem to help in getting service. The concept that if ANY team member sees the ""stop forest stop"" at ANY table, they stop and ask what is needed is a great concept and I have eaten at other locations where the service was excellent using this model. Perhaps it was an off night or they were short staffed, but the service failed miserably as did managements handling of the situation.",xUz760SV4SoyhW9GECgbkw,8,0,1,h20-o3E5y1o7TU8jtT0ROg

My friend had the fish and chips. The chips were good. Not many places can ruin fries - no worries there. But the ""fish?"" Boo. WAAAAAAAAAAAY too much breading, she could barely find the meat!

Fun fact: you tell the waitstaff that you need help by flipping over the license plate signs to the RED side. This lets your waiter know that you are ready for service or you have a concern/question. They'll tell you that, "" you're in the drivers' seat."" 

I see what they did there. 


I got the burger. It was really good, but nothing spectacular. It kept well, but I was not too happy about the price tag. I believe there was only one option for a burger, so I was sour that I felt overcharged to add cheese to the burger. 

And what is a burger without cheese? WHAT. IS IT?

The outside seating looked pretty appealing, but it was definitely chilly considering the temperature had dipped down into the 50s. and for the desert during midday, that was a little too CRISPin Glover for me. 


If you know you're about to get the chili's rate seafood experience, then you will not be dissapointed. As my friend pointed out, she would have liked more fish with her breading. From what I saw her pick off, it was an accurate assessment of the FISHuation.

The restaurant was easy to find thanks to Yelp.  Upon arriving at the restaurant the line was fairly long.  We just sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait to be seated.  

Upon sitting the bartender was very knowledgeable of the menu and drinks came fairly quickly.  We ordered the Run Across America Sampler for our appetizer which included the Bubba's Far Out Dip and Chips, Chilled Peel 'n' Eat Shrimp, Spicy Chicken Strips, Seafood Hush Pups and Mama Blue's Fried Shrimp.  The Spicy Chicken Strips were great.  My girl liked the shrimp on the appetizer.  Overall, being from New Orleans I have had better fried shrimp.

For our entree, we ordered the Soup & Salad Combo which was a house salad with Gumbo and the Shrimp Po' Boy which consisted of a Fresh Toasted Baguette stuffed with warm, hand breaded  Shrimp, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Pickles & Mayo, Served with Fries.  The food came out quick and that was a huge plus saying that it was packed.   The food was ok.  The shrimp Po-Boy could have had more seasoning to make the food more enjoyable.  I have had better.  My lady didn't like her salad and she said the gumbo wasn't good.

You walk upstairs and their are more items all on the wall, hanging from the celling.... this is so cool.  As we are seated on the table, their are questions and answers about the movie.  I wanna play...

Our waiter was a bubble guy named Charles. He appeared with a warm smile and  trivia questions. I don't think I'm ready. LoL...

First questions, nope I didn't know the answer let's just say I needed to see Forrest Gump again...

Now it's time for lunch... I ordered the filet in a garlic butter sauce. Wow....delicious! I was truly surprised that I enjoyed it that much.  

Dessert was banana bread.... HELL NO.... dont do it! It was watery and mushy.  Listen not everything is worth the money this is one banana bread I wouldn't order again, ever. 

The waiter was so nice he removed the banana bread from our bill, so I decided to make his tip worth it.

Lots of walking to get here-it's located inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino near the shops with an outdoor patio as an option for dining. Not convenient for locals who have to park and walkkkkkkkkkk.

We were seated right away and our waitress was very cheery and service was great.  I love using the signs at the table so you can easily flag a server down when you flip the sign over to STOP.  We had three servers stop at once-so service was perfect.

A nice kids menu offered favorites like pizza, hamburgers, macaroni and cheese and of course shrimp.

We started off with a refreshing margarita which my only complaint was the small glass that it was served in.  It took a while to get the drink at a perfect cold temperature.

I ordered a variety of shrimp...boiled, coconut and panko fried.  It came with a few different sauces (cocktail, sweet and sour, teriyaki).  Shrimp was cooked perfect and it was a yummy comfort food indulgence.

The shrimp macaroni and cheese was also on item we ordered and it had a nice smoky flavor.  Really good!  The hubby ordered the tilapia and it was served with creamy mashed potatoes and spinach.

Overall I don't think I'll be running back just because of the convenience factor.

4259349,2013-01-07,0,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"This is my favorite theme restaurant everywhere- been to the Oahu (the most visited one), Maui, Anaheim, and San Francisco locations, and finally here! I was wondering when one of these would come to town- what took so long?! I'm a Landry Select Club member, so I can easily rack up more points for rewards (spend $250, get $25 in card credit). 

This one is located next to the Miracle Mile Shops, so here are your options: park at Valet at Todai or park at the Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops parking garage- enter the shopping center but exit out of the Todai side, and take the escalators or in our case, the elevator- we're parents now, so we're pushing a stroller. From here, a host will direct you. You will go through the store, into the elevator and up to the 3rd floor. From here, the host will seat you. It wasn't that busy, for lunch on a saturday, but then again, it's still new. 

New, clean, featuring memorabilia from the movie, seems a little smaller compared to the other locations, but the ambiance feature is this one is overlooking the popular Strip. There were some patrons outside, but it was too cold for us, plus, our two-month old baby. There were some tables  with chairs and booths (the booth was too small for us- we had a stroller). I can't comment on the bathrooms since I didn't leave the table. 

On to the food, the ""Run Across America Sampler""- hush puppies, artichoke dip and chips, spicy chicken, fried shrimp, and peel 'n eat shrimp, is our absolute favorite. The price was $15.99, slightly higher than the last time but maybe the prices have gone up since then (last year- Oahu). This one never disappoints- we always split it. My husband really loves the hush puppies, it's his favorite. Mine is probably the chicken. I got the strawberry speckled lemonade at $5.99- refills are 99 cents. (Similar to Red Robin's lemonade.) The Ice Cream Caramel Spice Cake was phenomenal! This was $8.99, but well worth it. We've had the other ones in the past-  the bread pudding, strawberry shortcake, and the cookie sundae, but this one is specific to Las Vegas- it's new. I'm pretty sure we are getting this dessert again. It seems like a seasonal flavor combination, but really, you could have this all-year round. The server was really nice, and the service was pretty good, too. We got to ask the server questions about the movie. The manager stopped by to see how we were doing. He even changed out my wobbly chair. 

My husband thinks that this takes away from when we go out of town, because we always include this place in our must-haves/must-eats, but I really like that it is finally here, where we live. I hope that this place does well. Las Vegas and certain restaurants do not always mesh (except mexican restaurants seem to pop up when space opens up). And I intend on getting a shirt at some point, even though I live here. We were pretty stuffed and needed to walk around the mall to get a little more comfortable.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,5,UAScpQb-BsgiemQu0qAm2g

It was FUC'n horrible!!! We walked up, we were sat down next to the windows on the strip, and handed menus. And we sat. And then we sat some more. And then even more. Damn near 20 minutes of this $hit went on. Servers, (and when I say servers, I mean 4-5 at a minimum), walked by us, more than once, clearly saw our menus, (either open or after we had ""made our choices"", closed on the table top), without glasses of water in 105 degree heat. And not even a single one of them said absolutely anything to us like ""Oh have you been helped""? ""Would you like a glass of water""? ""You're butt FUC'n ugly""... Something... Anything!!! THE only reason we waited as long as we did was because we were famished and felt like some Bubba Gump... We love the Shoreline Village location in the LBC.

Now, I have never been in the business of serving folks in a restaurant, or waiting tables for that matter, (unless you want to count working at Jack-in-the-Box as a teen), BUT I will say one thing... If I DID work in a joint like Bubba Gump AND saw patrons sitting for even 5 minutes without water, I would do one of two things:

1). Either offer them water, and get it to them myself, (even if it wasn't my table), or;
2). Tell the lame ass who WAS responsible for that table / area to get their $hit together and tend to their customers.

I personally love the movie ""Forrest Gump"", so I was really excited to try out this restaurant. But, the food fell way below my expectations. I don't know if it was just an off day for the chefs, but all the dishes were mediocre.

Loved the vibe of the restaurant plus we had an awesome waiter too. It was cool the waiters play trivia with your table even though I haven't seen the movie myself. I ordered the appetizer, Cajun shrimp with garlic bread, and a side of fries to share. That ended up being the perfect portion size for me.

The decorations and designs are pretty much the same sans the UNLV memorabilia near the bar. Walk past the Miracle Mile shops and Planet Hollywood until you reach the staircase at the intersection (next to the Cosmopolitan if you're on the other side); you will see the BG entrance at the top.

Watermelon Lemonade ($10): Easy, breezy, lemoneezy. The drinks are currently being served in light-up glasses that you can take home with you. I couldn't really taste the watermelon, as it was more tangy and lemony, but it was good. I'd probably order a strawberry lemonade next time, though.

Hush Puppies ($10.29): Chunks of shrimp, fish, and corn mixed, battered, and deep fried served with their house remoulade on the side. Each hush puppy was bite sized and quite flavorful with or without the sauce.

Cup of Gumbo ($5.99): I found the gumbo to be pretty flavorful; you can taste the andouille sausage, shrimp, green onions, and spices all blended together. It isn't too thick, but it was definitely not watery either. 

Shrimper's Heaven ($22.99): This was my choice, and I found it to be pretty good. You get four types of shrimp--tempura, golden, coconut, and grilled--with fries in each basket and three sauces--Tangy Asian, Cajun Marmalade, and Zesty Cocktail. Of all the types of shrimp, the grilled one was my least favorite; it is flavorless even with the sauces. Speaking of sauces, the Tangy Asian flavor doesn't stick to the shrimp. 

We also ordered a bowl of Clam Chowder ($7.99), Bourbon Street Mahi Mahi ($20.49), Captain's Fish and Chips ($16.99), and Strawberry Lemonade ($5.99/ea and $0.99/refill). I did not try the Mahi Mahi, but it was said to be flavorful. The fish and chips were good--the fish was nice and flaky--but at its price, the serving is too small. As for the clam chowder, it was nothing special; it's not bland, but more of a ""light"" chowder.

4654891,2013-01-16,1,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,"Bubba Gump Shrimp has arrived in Vegas! Last Saturday, I arrived on the Strip to dine in Bubba Gump. 

     I have been to Bubba Gump Shrimp as a tourist in New Orleans and Chicago. I had been waiting for the grand opening of their Las Vegas vacation. Last Saturday the wait was over.

    Bubba Gump Shrimp is located in the new mall that opened up on the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard at Harmon Avenue in the shadow of Planet Hollywood. It is a second level tenant with pedestrian traffic from  two strip pedestrian overpasses. Currently it is easy to find because a lady is advertising it to passersby. At the entrance is the menu. I appreciate it when restaurants have the menu at the entrance. I prefer to have an idea of what I want to order before I step inside a restaurant. Once we decided what to order,entered through the edge of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Gift Shop. The woman greeter nicely directed us upstairs. Once upstairs, we were directed to stand on a cue of circles in a waiting area of the restaurant proper. If you have waited to ride on Disney Land's Star Tour's ride, this is a similar arrangement. Inside the restaurant, there is a spectacular view of the Cosmopolitan. When the weather is nice, the balcony seats overlooking the Cosmopolitan is a prime dining spot. The weather was cool and we sat in the general Forest Gump themed dining area.

   If you have never been to Bubba Gump Shrimp, they have a neat gimmick. On the table is a sign that you flip. If you want service, I believe you set it to ""Stop Forest"" and if you don't need service, I believe you set it to ""Run Forest Run."" 

  If I was in vacation state of mind, I would of spent $21.99 on the Shrimper's Heaven. I was in a budget state of mind. Bubba Gump Shrimp is a reasonable option if you are on a budget on the Strip. I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich with fries and bottomless Coke. After a tip, the dinner came to $22. Not bad!

   I have a minor complaint, which is the waitress up selling a restaurant card. When the waitress sat next to us, my instinct was that she was not a die hard Forest Gump fan that wanted to share with the world that Forest Gump played football and that he was from Alabama. When I am eating out, I do not care if Forest Gump was wearing no sneakers in a scene or that football was a sport he played. I want to relax! By the time I am eating I have passed enough people in the hotels trying to sell me time shares. Fast forward to when we were walking out, they were advertising sales at the gift shop. In other respects, the waitresses were friendly and served with an urgency.

   Most likely I will return to Bubba Gump. If I am in a tourist state of mind, I will relive my past vacations with Bubba Gump's Shrimper's Heaven.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,2,3,4,_XSxrgSp9erSRSwpY7uOqg

I didn't say keep the change and leave you a large tip..... so why wasn't I given exact change?

My food looked really good .. small serving size but that cheese sauce on the bourbon Mah mahi dryed up and resembled cheez whiz (no bueno) the crispy fried chips were cold those were definitely sitting out and added to the plate as a decoration.. shrimp was good (I could've eaten a plate of those and been happy!)

I figured, if I am going to get full eating this meal, I am taking down the sandwich and avoiding the fries. Glad I did, I was stuffed by the time I finished the sandwich.

Crap, we aren't in HI. This location lacked, alot. Our server was lousy, unattentive, and you could see him by their register thingy playing as if it's social hour. The Bubba Gump we once loved and wished we had out here, had arrived, minus the Bubba Gump.vibe we are acquainted with. 

My husband always gets the Shrimp New Orleans. I'll usually order a Caesar salad (surprise surprise), their salmon, or their ribs. I will say I have always loved their Caesar salad. Their Caesar dressing and croutons have always been on point, so I can't critique that.

I feel like their ribs for $24 is not even worthed. It isn't even that great. It's good, just not 24 bucks good. On this particular evening I ordered salmon. Can we say, dry! DRY! Look, I am those weirdos who actually can bare through dry food, love my steak charred and well-done...chewy? No problem. If I accidentally overcook my salmon at home, I can bare with it. BUT when a restaurant serves you a dry fish at 20 bucks....grrrr. 

It isn't a bad place to try. Maybe it's a hit or miss. But I just think they are way too steep for what you are getting. Also, the service we received was pretty lousy. I can seperate lousy service and good food or vice versa. On this night, wholly cow. I mean, from the long anticipated wait just to get our name called, to the walk uo the stairs just to stand in another line to get seated...It just all sucked. 
Our waiter got no tip whatsoever and I seriously regretted going there with the whole brood.

Oh, forgot to mention..the husband enjoyed his dish (surprise surprise). 

I came in with a stroller and had no problems. Just the part where we had to carry the stroller up the stairs. I could've swore I seen an elevator, so it would have been customer service friendly if someone mentioned it. However, my husband and I like to move quick...so carrying that bad boy up the stairs toddler strapped in was the only option even if there were other options.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly! I won't HIGHLY recommend it. There are other GREAT restaurants in the area to spend your money where you will receive better service and a well-worthed meal. But, I don't like my isolated experience to deter other from trying it out. 

However, because of the service we received that night, quality of food, the price...only way I'd come back to THIS Bubba Gump is if someone gave me a gift certificate...only then will I give it another shot and only hope to up its ratings.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,0,2,uuulxF_TwVPhIOFLJHhf6g

The restaurant is located on the top floor of where the Miracle Mile shops are. Very easy to get to and accessible from the strip. 

Our table of 8 (gratuity already included) placed different orders, but I made out with the cup of gumbo and the Stuffed Shrimp (stuffed with crab). My gumbo was OK. I haven't had a gumbo as good as the gumbo from NOLA unfortunately. 

My shrimp entree ($20) was soooo rich and buttery. WOW, such great flavor! I also tried my Dad's jambalaya and it was spicy! Drink lots of beer!!! I also tried the coconut shrimp, which I enjoyed as well. I had a tempura shrimp and I didn't care for it. There was a weird taste that accompanied it.

Hard swallow (drinks water)....

BUT....this place...NO ma'am!!!!  Customer service is horrible, food is not southern, my group felt we were treated different (I will use that word), AND to top it all off, there is no mention of BUBBA!!!!

Well, as I stated, I am a fan....I went to see memorabilia and that I did.  There was ""Forrest"" memorabilia everywhere, from downstairs to upstairs.  The decor was nice, hence my one star.  I can say that part of the experience was nice.  However, as we looked in the store downstairs, on the walls, upstairs in the restaurant, we noticed there were lots of mention of Forrest, his extended family, Jenny, LT. Dan but no Bubba Gump.  I didn't see his extended family nor pictures of him.  Definitely left us ALL confused, but we climbed the stairs to the restaurant.

Now, to the Restaurant.  When we were seated, we opted for the patio, but as we sat there for 30 minutes with no drinks and watched others being served, it was decided that was a bad decision.  We moved ourselves to the inside.  It was comfy in both spaces.  We just wanted fresh air and scenery.  The patio offers a nice view of the strip.  Great for people watching while you wait on your food.  BUT....inside we were met with annoyance and poor customer interaction.  I opted for the fish sandwich,  as a look on yelp offered some nice looking fish.  I am southern, so my expectations were high.  When the food arrived, I must say, I was looking very sad. I probably should have ordered shrimp since it's in the name.  The sandwich was Cod.  I am not a fan of Cod, I expected something else.  It was thick cut Cod with heavy coating, more than needed in my opinion.  But, it was bland coating so it was just useless.  The fish wasn't seasoned either, so blah!!!  I won't speak on the rest of the food since I only ""tasted"" the sandwich.  There was enough food on the strip that I didn't need to eat something I didn't find great.

The plated food was a bit warm rather than hot so the group sent back a few items.  This didn't turn out well.  As new items were ordered and we were still charged for items sent back.  Well, that definitely made for frustration on  both sides.  When a manager was asked for, 30 minutes later, no manager.  We agreed to just pay and leave.

Never Ever again.....

Not worth the hassle.

I stated I'm hungry now and she wanted to take the burger back versus having the manager come over or put in another order.  Given my condition, I need to eat now not later. I told the bartender I'll just got somewhere else to eat. 

Well my partner stopped eating so we can get something else to eat. I wanted to leave (and did leave) everything else unfinished so I can go. Our entire order was this awful mushroom burger, water (for 1 person although we asked for water for starters), an adult beverage (the bartender had to make two different once but they still wasn't good) and calamari. We asked to speak to the manager and Bud, shift manager or whatever he is, waltzed over and with a nasty attitude and said we have to pay for the unfinished items versus offer a solution. Bud claimed him and the chef were sitting and watching us. They didn't proactively intervene. 

Forget customer satisfaction or service, we paid for the unfinished items cash (surprise surprise Bud we had money for our meal and then some) and walked out. Matt Stensrude, general manager, needs to work with their poorly trained chef, unskilled/inexperienced bartender and definitely Bud with his customer service, managerial skills. I hope they are happy with this $23.56 cash they got for poor service and awful food; I knew Bubba Gump restaurants to be so hard up for cash to treat us as such. No tip for poor service and food!

Location:  Is perfect if you ask me, the outside balcony seating that over looks the strip is great. They have the same Forrest Gump memorabilia everywhere. Only thing I didn't like was the entrance to (well all the people), you get to the front where there is a booth and the hostess radios how many (fine) they direct you through the gift shop up the stair (OK) there is a guy that tells you to enjoy your meal at the bottom of the stairs (nice) then you get to the top of the stairs where a person then tells you to follow the yellow smiley faces to another set of hostess.

The service was pretty fast too. I loved every bite and can't wait to come back.,wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,1,0,5,1CmmzY85_lZI6Gzzmc0_Qg
