1504736,2008-02-11,0,JYtGcfc3iFvwj5Zi4oQg7Q,"I adore Long life. The owners are the only employees there and you can tell they really care about their business and customers. The wife serves all the food, and the husband cooks it. Sometimes they take a break and eat dinner together when business dies down. It's all very sweet.

Decor:
Typical chinese restaurant fare. pastel colored seats, bare walls with the occasional painting, a few floral arrangements, (I'm not sure if they are real or plastic) and a fishtank with a few MASSIVE goldfish inside.

Patrons:
 A semi scary smokeshop/ tattoo parlor moved in next door recently with shady types hanging out front but even they come in from time to time and get dinner there. It's odd to see your typical granola looking vegans, scary looking pseudo gang members, and the odd office worker all enjoying a nice quiet meal in the same place. Long life is never super busy, but it appears their customer base is loyal, as I usually average a visit or two a week and see many of the same people there.

Food:
Everything I've had there has been wonderful, but the best dish I've had would be the Rainbow Chicken Chunks. Tasty, moist faux chicken nuggets in sauce with veggies served with either white or brown rice.  Most of the menu is vegan friendly, however a few dishes do have eggs, sugar, or fish in them. Yes, the fish dishes on the menu is actual fish.. so steer clear of them. Other than that everything else is delightful, especially the curry dishes.  If you are a strict Vegan, they do understand what that means and will tell you exactly what is in the food you are ordering, which is great. *glares at Komol Thai*


Most dishes hover around the 6-9 dollar mark, drinks are between the $1-3 range, appetizers (which are big enough to be a entree) are around $4-6.",s_40OrWdKyqRuK-BeFeNjw,1,2,5,KVj9_PGCIzXxocd6TzVAog

I wasn't sure what to expect when he invited me their for lunch, I was impressed to say the least.  We ordered the hot and sour soup sans egg, eggplant with garlic sauce and tofu, and of course the much raved about triangle meat with veggies( I think it was faux chicken?).  

Everything was excellent, triangles were my favorite, with a choice of white or brown rice we also received fresh melon and fortune cookies(not vegan, but still prophetic) with our lunch.  

Our waitress/ co-owner? was a delight,  with kind and caring service I felt very welcome and want to go back to try more of the dishes,  It is without a doubt a family run restaurant which makes me even more inclined to visit again.  The d√©cor was almost comical but adds to the ambiance.  

The only thing I noticed that was a bit odd was the lack of background music, as we ate in silence i felt it could use a bit of noise besides the sound of me chomping on veggies.",ezDZTeQATd0Vjw8m-IaatQ,2,1,4,yqEO-Ikz4n8PBA6DT92Fsw
1687116,2009-09-28,0,JYtGcfc3iFvwj5Zi4oQg7Q,"One more vegan review from the meat eater of the group...

My vegan daughter and boyfriend ordered the pot stickers and curry veg fried rice (no egg). 

Our server was tuned in to the vegan order and without my asking, scored extra points when she told us the hot and sour soup is vegan. YAY! I love it when a server can anticipate your needs even before you are aware of them.

I ordered the tofu and garlic sauce, and loved that I could order brown rice!

The exterior is blah nondescript strip mall, but the interior is decorated nice and looks like any other American authentic Chinese wall decor. We were in at 1:40, well past lunch time but found four other groups enjoying their meals.

The fortune cookies were served individually wrapped, including nutritional information and ingredients, allowing the vegan to know that they are NOT vegan. (I think it was egg, but by the time I am writing my review I am not sure)

Ping the lady that owns this place is the sweetest lady with a smile on her face all the time. I'm not kidding...all the time. Go check it out. No exaggeration here. It's a hole in the wall in the middle of a pretty weird and old strip mall next to a tattoo place that plays the loudest music at all times of the day. 

The food here is pretty good. They have lunch specials for less than $10 that is served with soup and a pretty significant portion of the entree. 

Our favs are the following:

1. Mung Bean Ball Soup - Deep Fried Balls of some kind of bean and batter in a clear soup with some veggies

2. Hot and Sour Soup - Generous helpings of tofu and bamboo shoots and mushrooms in this soup that is THE best on a cold or sickly day

3. Pepper Tofu - Deep Fried Tofu (silken inside) with some bell peppers, onions and broccoli. Very Very Good

4. Mango Tofu - A more sophisticated version of Sweet and Sour and this one tastes good

5. Potstickers - Pan Fried and YUM YUM YUM. I can finish an order of 8 myself.

I avoid their fake meats as I generally don't like them except at certain places. I also think their fried rice is pretty bad. Sticking to my staples, I love eating here whenever I trudge my way to this area.

The scallion pancakes are a must and the spring rolls are pretty jammin' too.  My fiancee really digs on the crab rangoons here but it's a pretty standard rangoon compared to other places.  I've tried quite a few of the chicken dishes and the orange chicken is possibly my favorite.  I must admit.. the orange chicken is pretty sweet (as in sugary sweet) and I only get it every so often.  BUT my main man master dish is the chicken egg foo yong.  The foo yong is pretty standard and it comes with the usual sauce draped all over it but the fact that I can eat a chicken-tasting egg foo yong is a real treat.  The service is always good and the lady who owns the place is always ultra nice.  One of my favorite restaurants in town.  Go try it.  The food is good and you might actually live a little longer?

4287077,2008-10-09,1,JYtGcfc3iFvwj5Zi4oQg7Q,"This place is located at the southeast block of the Flamingo-Sandhill intersection. Took me a second to find it. Ghetto area, but lots of parking. 

I went at 6p on a Weds evening and there were only two other parties in there. The waitress was attentive and polite. 

The restaurant is severely under decorated, with some Buddhist items and random Chinese things and a fish tank. 

The menu confuses me. I thought it was gonna be a totally vegetarian/ vegan restaurant (like Veggie Delite on Spring Mt and Wynn), but it was a mix. They serve fish (sole) for sure. And there were items with beef, chicken, or pork. But then I got into the meat substitute section of the menu. I thought it was all meat substitute. 

I ordered the honey walnut tofu ($10), but I also wanted a meat substitute dish. All of the items looked pretty tame. I asked my server to recommend something. She asked me, ""You want spicy or no?"" Not spicy, I replied. Then she gave a thinking look, like I'm SOL. So then I said a little spicy is okay. So then right away she recommended a beef and veggie dish ($10, forgot what it was called, but it was the last or second to the last item of the section). The beef sub was good. It looked like beef broccoli, but had all kinds of vegetables. And the texture of the fake meat was good. Not anything that would deceive you to believe that you were eating real meat, but still very good. 

The honey walnut tofu was like honey walnut shrimp. But with tofu. And they put the sweet mayo sauce on the side. When I ordered it, she warned me there was egg in the sauce. The tofu was even lightly battered and fried, like honey walnut shrimp. The tofu sans the mayo glaze is very bland. This is served with steamed broccoli. I love that Chinese people rarely overcook broccoli. 

I also got a brown rice, for which she did not charge me. 

Now here is the strange thing. After she took my order, she went in the back and placed the order with the chefs. And I DIDN'T hear screaming and yelling in Chinese. So strange. 

For dessert, I got a fortune cookie. 

For the two dishes, before tip, my total was $22.

4300182,2010-07-01,0,JYtGcfc3iFvwj5Zi4oQg7Q,Wow! This place may soon become a regular stop. I also am hoping that it will become worthy of a 5 star rating. The wife and I wanted Chinese food and Diana and Sangeetha's reviews sold us on LLV and we were not disappointed. The location is a bit iffy but the place was clean. We were the only eat in customers but that didn't dissuade us. As others mentioned the service was very good. And the menu must have changed from the older reviews as the owner let us know that the only meat served is seafood and all other meat is faux. Also she said that all of their sauces are animal free. I had Kung pao tofu and the wife had garlic veggies. We both had brown rice and veggie wontons. The veggie wontons were hands down the best fried wontons I have ever had. No cream cheese here just veggies and an amazing sauce. They were lightly fried and not oily. My main dish was great. Plenty of flavor and good spice (could have been a hair spicier). Veggies were not overcooked at all. The tofu was good. I prefer fried but this wasn't which was fine because it is probably healthier. The wife greatly enjoyed her dish. Also a bit spicy. The serving sizes were huge and we both have lunch for tomorrow. The main dishes (non seafood) are around the $8-9 range and the wontons were $6ish.

My first round wasn't *bad*, it just wasn't all that.  The second time was much better.  I think the key here (at least for me) is to order the dishes with tofu instead of one of the fake meats.  I did not care for their taste or texture*.  And beware!! the fish items on the menu are real fish, not soy versions (as opposed to Veggie Delite)!!

Here's the rundown - I was thrilled to be able to get vegan hot n sour soup, which was super tasty and lived up to it's name! I love that you can get brown rice at no additional charge.  They also have great lunch specials deals - soup + entree + eggroll for like $7-8?! awesome.  

So, WMFP with this place? why not more stars? Well, I'm giving it a 3.5 --it's good, it's just kinda generic.  All of our dishes (curry, kung pao, mongolian bbq-style) had the exact same veggies, although we ordered different proteins.  I wanna go back and try some of their more diverse offerings that aren't a stir-fry w/ sauce kinda deal, and hopefully bump this place up to 4!
