After a night of little slumber
We woke up with much hunger
We drove about 2 miles
And Kristi/Kristy(?) greeted us with BIG smiles

The food was oh so yummy

I even left some on the plate

They have lots of different omelets, which they all sound really delicious. Out of all the omelets to choose from I ordered the ""Just Cheese"" which is an omelet with your choice of cheese, but I added mushrooms since I love my mushrooms. When the waiter brought out my omelet, man was it huge (good to share with someone). I even ordered the baby size, an I was full after my 5th bite. The potato chips that it comes with is really good, it was crispy and fresh. The waiter forgot my pumpkin bread, I did remind her that I never got it, even though I knew I had no room in my stomach I just wanted to try it. Pumpkin bread was really delicious and you can tell that it's made fresh. 

I am definitely coming back to order the mushroom burger! That's a must try if your a mushroom fan (the very first time I came here I ordered the mushroom burger so I know it's really good).",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,1,4,oBPBQ8q5KAYCXHkCSfm6cg

My fathers day as well as my son's father day was ruined from the moment we entered his restaurant. The host (who happens to be the owner), was the rudest person I have ever met. He made it very clear his business model is how many people he can herd through his establishment and not at all about customer service. It was not just my family he was rude to, it was everyone (my heartfelt sympathy goes out to his employees. It must be embarrassing to work for someone like that). As a business owner myself for many years in Las Vegas, I can assure you that if I treated my customers that way I would be out of business! Personally, I will never step foot in his restaurants again.

My boyfriend was satisfied with his chicken fried steak and eggs but we both thought the gravy was a bit salty.  

I had a wonderful time there but my breakfast was my least favorite.  I had eggs over medium and they were a bit under-done.  To be fair, I didn't say a word but I'm sure they would have fixed my order.  I was the only one bothered by the ""surprise"" potato chips.  I LOVE hash browns but when I asked for my hash browns extra crispy, our waitress did not correct me.  However, the chips were tasty!  Now, on the upside, I was in LOVE with the pumpkin bread (which actually filled me up before my breakfast came) so I really didn't care about the other stuff!  Next time,  I will share an omelet with my sweetie! 

This is definitely a great departure from casino buffets!  We got there around 10:30 and didn't wait at all.  When we left, however, there was a bit of a line.

Next, unless you are starving - order your OMELET ""baby size"".  They come out in generous portions.  There are so many options on the omelet - I like the California, BB&C and Farmer's.

310412,2009-06-13,0,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"Overall: 
Found this restaurant off of Yelp so decided to check it out. It's a family owned business serving typical diner style breakfast. Go here if you want hearty breakfast with great portions for the price, but be prepared to feel stuffed and a bit overwhelmed. 

Ambiance/Location: 
In the back of a strip mall, also a bit difficult to find (when you turn in, look on the back left of the parking lot). The inside is cute, with various curios on the walls and old pictures of famous people and their Best of Las Vegas articles (they won several years in the early 90's). 

Food: 
portions are HUGE (each omelet is made with 6 eggs, 4 if you downsize to the ""baby"" size). We ordered the ""kitchen sink"" which literally has everything in it from stew meat chunks and chili to bell peppers and onions. The lobster fest is filled with lobster, avocado, and cheese. Both tasted good, but were a bit overwhelming and heavy. (ie. if you are on any type of diet, you probably don't want to be here). Omelets are accompanied by potatoes cut like thick chips and deep fried, as well as a side of pumpkin bread, banana bread, toast, or English muffin. I highly recommend the pumpkin or banana bread which were hot, moist, hearty, and well-spiced. The pancakes were also pretty light and a bit more cake-y than others I've had. the syrup was thin and very sweet, not very flavorful. 

Service:

It's one of those places I would never have gone to unless someone had recommended it to me first. That would be Yelp, in this case. I'm glad I found it, though, because the breakfast here is great.

Their omelettes are gigantic! No one in my group was able to finish theirs. I had the Black Forrest omelette which had mushrooms, ham, and swiss. The eggs were perfect and the cheese was nice and melty. But it was just too big. I should have exercised the option to make it a ""baby omelette"" for $0.85 less. I had considered the option, but decided it would make me look like a wuss. I didn't want to order something off the menu with the word ""baby"" in it. That's worse than ordering off the kid's menu, as far as I'm concerned.

There's one thing that troubled me. There's one omelette on the menu called the ""Flatlanders Special."" This is what it is word for word from the menu: Raw liver, parsnips, peanut butter, organically grown black jelly beans, sauteed grunion lips (2), gardenia petals, and topped with mint ice cream (Subject to when grunions are running). It costs $69. I don't know if it's for real or if it's some kind of joke. Thinking about it now, I'm really kind of curious about it. 

That aside, this place is great. Definitely check it out when you're in town. Oh, and don't leave without trying the banana nut bread or the pumpkin bread. Or both.",jEa6HgHWmCoNxeTSdzddiw,2,1,4,9P1kuImhA_jpEaBEeQGdxA

If you've had your fill of the cookie-cutter, mediocre, chain-like, diner-style restaurants; and your craving some good food, personality, and kitch, then you have to check out the Omelet House. 

Tucked away in an otherwise, run-down, and non-descript strip mall near UMC, the Omelet House has an extensive menu, just broad enough to please its rather large, & eclectic following. 

Be prepared to wait a few minutes, although the restaurants multitude of seating areas seem to have branched off over the years into hidden hallways and secret garden rooms.

Basic good, hot coffee (complete with staff who seem solely dedicated to the task of keeping all the cups full) helps to keep your growling stomach at bay, while a comedically-described, fun list of deliciously tempting omelets ranging from the simple Southwestern to the brazen, 'Kitchen Sink' (comprised of who knows what), will only make you more hungry, as you toil away about what to order.

My recommendation is the Chorizo Omelet (there is some unspoken harmony between eggs & really good chorizo that I find irresistible), but for those of you calorie counters - just along to enjoy the scenery & conversation, you will be equally pleased by egg whites filled with whatever you like...

Arrive with an open-mind and an empty stomach and you're sure to have an interesting & tasty experience.  For the best people-watching, try a weekend if you don't mind a short wait; then, while you anxiously await your fluffy yellow taste of breakfast-heaven, entertain your eyes with all of the bizarre items that have been lovingly collected and hung on the walls around you - some of them even for sale!",iZT3J9v_mFHPLw9PgaT9Iw,0,0,4,vpQDLrMZxnoziKazn4r3aQ

It's fantastic, but the standard options and portions are not for the health-conscious. The star menu items are, of course, the omelets, of which there are 34 to choose from, including quite a few unique combinations (lobster, shrimp, salmon, etc.) I've tried a few of them at this point and have left happy every time.

All breakfast items come with ""spuds"" (thinly sliced fried potatoes) and a choice of toast, english muffin, homemade bread or tortillas. You want to get the bread (Pumpkin Nut or Banana Nut, both are great). While the potatoes and rest of your meal will be tasty, I am sad for people who don't order one of the breads. You are truly missing out should you pass on it.

For the health conscious, you'll want to downgrade to a ""baby"" omelet, which would more accurately be named the ""adult human"" size. The standard omelet portion is more appropriate for horses or elephants. There are also options for splitting a dish, substituting a side for sliced banana or fruit cup and using egg beaters, egg whites or swiss/feta cheese, all for additional cost. The Omelet House has ways to make their offerings more healthy but it's going to cost extra.

There are also traditional American lunch items (sandwiches, hamburgers) but if you're visiting from out of town, stick with breakfast. The one exception might be the fried zucchini which is worth getting (but also terrible for you.)

== Environment ==

The folksy environment is a far cry from the glitz and glamour of the strip but it's an island of authenticity in what tends to be a sea of garish veneer during a trip to Las Vegas.

The place is tucked inside one of the hundreds of strip malls that make up most commercial districts within the city and seems to cater to a split of tourists and locals.

== Summary ==

As you can probably tell, I'm a huge fan of the Omelet House. The food alone is worth a 5-star rating, but the charges for all the healthier substitutes and the spotty wait staff (who range from extremely friendly to mildly contemptuous) docks a star.

That said, the Omelet House is a standard part of every trip I take to Vegas. The casinos can be cruel but giant omelets, fried potatoes and amazing bread never fail me.

Reason for the deductions in stars was because a friend noticed there was actually a cockroach crawling all over his utensils. I alerted the waiter or whoever was helping out and didnt realyl get an acknowledgement that this was not right. We could've been asses and created more trouble, but we were there for a family function and didnt want the rest of family to be bothered if we changed venues. 

A star is added due to the good service by the waitresses that handled us.

Pluses: our server was really sweet and accommodating, no wait in line on a Monday lunch hour, lots of options for the ovo-lacto. I liked my guac omelet (just the right amt of spice), and Boyfriend got the spinach one. He wishes he got the artichoke one because it was pretty standard, BUT both of our omelets were well-filled w/ ingredients. They use real butter on their toast, too, yay!

Minuses: parking was surprisingly full. We had to circle twice before finding parking. Their coffee wasn't to my liking, but if you like your coffee really thin and watery (like my mom does) you won't mind it.

Other: the decor reminded me of stopping at one of those random places off the 5 on your way down to L.A., but in a good way. Lots of junk to look at on the walls, and try to get a booth.

In the past, I'd always ask if the grunion were running, but lately, it seems some of the waitstaff isn't as familiar with the menu as I am, so I've kind of stopped asking. 

The potatoes here are excellent. 

If you transplanted them to just about any low/mid 20s zagat-rated steakhouse, you'd be paying between $7 to $12 bucks for these cottage fries. Really, really nice potatoes. I prefer them to the $7 fries at Bouchon. Dead serious. 

The banana bread is good, be sure to have some when it's available. The pumpkin nut bread is pretty good as well.

I like to order the breakfast sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg, or more economically, breakfast bacon sandwich with a side of lettuce and tomato instead of the cheese. 

The omelets are all pretty large. Depending on your ability to put away a 6 egg omelet you may be pleased or intimidated when you see it in front of you. 

The lobster benedict that a lot of reviewers rave about isn't as good as you would imagine. Something isn't quite right with the lobster or the Hollandaise. It's not their best menu item, and there's so many other things to eat here, I'd skip it.

I've been eating here for a very long time, and I have always found the service to be personable and relatively quick. However, I avoid this place on weekends. 

I am told that weekends can be quite hectic at peak breakfast hours.

Also, they aren't really open very early for a breakfast spot (7am), so it's not exactly a place for early birds or night owls looking to grab a late post-afterhours meal.

It's an affordable place to eat north of the strip. It isn't the best breakfast spot in the world, but it does the trick about 96% of the time, so it's a solid 4-star place for me, and one of the few staples on my reliable vegas eats list.

I did also enjoy the potatoes that came with it. They are sliced like potato chips, but not cooked to a hard crunch. They are soft and crunchy at the same time. My wife said her omelet was quite tasty as well.

I am sorry to say that in the long run I was not very impressed. When we arrived we waited to be seated a good three to five minutes. The restaurant was only about half full at the time.

My sandwich, even though tasty, was priced way too high. The slices of bread were not very big, the ham was not very thick and the cost was close to eight dollars.

Today it's dated, the food is bland, and the menu is whatevs. Or maybe people from podunk parts of America aren't accustomed to good breakfast places and equate big with delicious.

I wouldn't call this place nice, as it looks sort of dilapidated on the outside, but the food is AMAZINGG.
I think this just might be the best mom and pop place that I've been to. The inside sorta makes you feel like you're at grandma's house with all the little knick-knacks (is that a word?) and vintage posters. 
The service is alright. I would say it's a hit or miss because sometimes they make me feel so welcome and are really engaging and other times its just standard, not bad though. 

The omelets come with bread. Don't get the toast, GET THE PUMPKIN OR BANANA BREAD. I LOVVEE the pumpkin bread so I usually get that. Its totally tastes homemade, straight out of the oven good. Mmm
  
There's no one specific omelet I always get but everything I've had here has all been really good. The omelets are ridiculously huge and for pretty cheap too, so you might wanna share with someone, which they'll conveniently do for you for a small fee. The potato chips that come with the omelets are homemade too, which you can taste. Sooo yummy and fresh. 
I've just recently got discovered eggs benedict (i know, what??) and this place has amazinngggg lobster eggs benedict!!! mmmm

You have to try the Bugsy Siegel omelet that has marinated melt in your mouth beef chunks in a delicious Italian sauce, sour cream, and cheese.

Menu has a long list of selections of different types of omelettes.  They also have the sweet breakfast stuff like pancakes and french toasts, etc.  On other other side is the lunch menu, which I didn't even get a chance to look at, are burgers, salads, sandwiches, and other lunch items.

Got the Egg White special for $10.19 and got it ""baby"" omelette, which is an 89 cent discount for a smaller omelette.  Definitely get the ""baby"" portion if you can't finish a lot of food since the regular size omelettes are huge!!  Most of my friends couldn't finish their regular omelettes or split a regular one.

Egg white omelete was good - filled with zucchini, spinach, and some other stuff I forgot.  I added an avocado for an extra $1.49.  You couldn't really see the egg whites, though, because it was filled with a lot of veggies!!  It was pretty good, maybe needed a hint of salt.  Also comes with a side of potatoes sliced like potato chips and cooked almost like potato chips with a few soggy potatoes.  Sooo delicious!  I loved their potatoes.  I try not to eat too many potatoes (too many carbs) but I couldn't stop eating these.  Yum yum.  Comes with choice of banana bread, toast, or pumpkin bread.

Get the banana bread!!  It was soo good and delicious.  Came out hot and fresh with walnuts on top.  It was so moist and delicious with the butter.  So good!  There wasn't too much of a banana flavor but it was still really good!

Our waitress was awesome!!  So friendly and easy-going and talkative.  Makes you feel right at home.  They filled out waters all the time and checked up on us.

Got a taste of the hubby's coffee and it was good, too!!

As I've mentioned before, go here the morning you're leaving: no chance you'll feel hungry on the plane flight home, however long it is.

I've been migrating from the popeye lately to the king of hearts omelet (which is with artichokes and jack cheese.)  I've also found you can get a ""small"" omelet if you ask for it, which comes on a small plate, but I think has the same amount of fillings, just fewer eggs (it only costs a few cents less, but a full-size omelet probably has a week's worth of eggs unless you get egg whites.)  The potatoes were better this time around...so I added the star back, although service was spotty (but friendly.)

I had the chicken fried steak with country gravy and the homemade house chips.  The dish was accompanied by pumpkin bread.  The pumpkin bread  was plentifully apportioned and served with spreadable butter versus the normal hard butter.  The homemade chips were crisp and delicious.  Chicken friend steak is one of my guilty pleasures and this version of it was one of the better ones I've had, best version in Las Vegas.  One of our dinner patrons had one of the omelets and found it underwhelming.  I won't speak as to the omelet as I didn't have it.

tried a bite of each - very good. 

Overall, just ok by me - like the old school feel to the place, but after a couple bites of the omelet just felt like it was lacking much flavor - my guess is they used farmer john skinless links for the filling - not much of the lil buggers either. 

total cost with coffee , $22 so it ain't exactly cheap eats , sure i can take 1/2 our order home but i doubt it's like day old spaghetti, pizza, and the like. 

and yes, at Scott's directive, I took some pics with my cell phone but the banana bread looks more like meatloaf then bread !! 

happy eating",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,1,0,3,0tvpatCjT61MZ6oVUT2NLg

Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say ""Yeah, that's a lot of mustard"".  That was his solution.  

So in a nutshell:
1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.  
3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.

Even the side of chips were made fresh. I also liked how they had three selections of hot sauce. I didn't finish my Omelet because I wanted to save room for my banana nut bread.

The eggs were made to order, and were not over or undercooked.  The pancakes were delicious.  The 2 types of breads they served were warm and very tasty.

You walk in the door on a saturday morning at like 8-8:30.. immediately seated. If its after that, you're looking at a 10 minute wai.. if that. The hostess is always sweet, the bussers fill your coffee when its half way down, the servers are friendly and on point. Our favorite server is Devinn (not sure of her spelling) but she is absolutely sweet. We get her pretty often, but would still vouch for any other server in that joint. She subtly remembers us which is cool because she knows we are regulars but still services everyone else like they are too. 
NOW..the food. Lets just say, you get BEYOND what you pay for. This is literally THEE omelet house. There are so many choices. Not only are their omelettes delicious, but everything else I have tried was delightfully satisfying. Their portions are huge! Even ordering the baby size I still cant finish it, but its also priced very low. I dont mind splurging on the tip! 
I personally love the decor. I was a little weirded out at first, but it kinda reminds me of my grandmas house. Plus its pretty eye catching and you wonder where it all came from.
I will forever continue my Saturday rituals at The Omelete House.",3-sYUZM-t10SV2MYaBdIqA,1,0,5,vKvgbaef9VY-sqw7fk6zCg

Thanks to Yelp, I stumbled upon this place and the menu looked decent. We were not disappointed. The omlets are HUGE and they come with homemade chips and your choice of bread, I chose pumpkin, or sub for fruit and other items.  
I chowed down on a green chili omlet (i can't remember the specific name) and it was awesome. Omlet filled with large chunks of pork and a tasty green chili blend and cheese. Delicious! The pumpkin bread was also amazing. Don't think Starbucks pumpkin bread. This is a mini loaf of pumpkin bread made with walnuts and raisins(?). Fantastic. Amazing. Yummy. 
The waitress was also great. We walk in right at closing because we didn't realize the time and they didn't hesitate to seat us and we got great service.",gNek9ptAu084yG830qYJuA,1,1,5,FXwKS3wa01zeR3Cbj1G1jA

I once had a bite of my brother's chicken friend steak and eggs (one of my favorite breakfasts), but I still only order The Kitchen Sink.

The potatoes are always good. My daughter loves them. My wife loves them and I love them. The one thing I don't love is the sausage change in The Kitchen Sink. I'm not sure when it happened, but I like the previous sausage better. The new sausage isn't bad, it just isn't the same. If you've never been, it won't matter much because you can't miss what you never had.

BIG Mistake..it was hands down the worst cheeseburger I have had in my life! The meat tasted like it was old and from one of those tubes that you buy for 2 bucks at the store. It was burned on the outside and pink in the middle, over worked dry and tough, the bun was wet from the wilted veggies. It actually made me sick ( i only are 2 bites )The atmosphere is unclean and it smells like dirty grandmas. I dont know how it got so many rave reviews... I guess people have no taste buds!

-Popeye Omelet- spinach, mushrooms and cheese
-Cowboy- chili
-Carnitas- Well pork for you that don't speak ESPA√ëOL 
-Everything but the kitchen sink- Literally EVERYTHING it was HUGE!!

They have the sharing charge. I do suggest this option if you do not eat alot since their portions are RIDICULOUSLY BIG. 

We were all very satisfied. My only complaint on my omelet was the chili was a little watery. There was an accumulation of water in my plate, not a major factor but I do like my Chili on the thicker side. 

Your meal comes with a complimentary side of bread, we all got pumpkin spice.

The portions are enormous and there was maybe one healthy thing on the menu so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're dieting. I got an omelet with chorizo, cheese and onions. Each entree comes with spuds which are basically potato chips. Wasn't sure how I felt about them at first but they grew on me.

The chili in the Cowboy Special was flavorful and had the right amount of spice without being too hot. Beans and finely ground beef in and delicious chili sauce all stuffed into this gigantic omelet that we couldn't finish - HEAVEN. 

My Lox Benedict had the creamiest sauce on top of the softest muffin. The salmon was a great touch to the meal. I found myself using the extra potatoes that came on the side to finish up the sauce. 

We also ordered banana bread that was piping hot when it was delivered to us. How can so much banana go into bread?????? What is this magic???????

The food and the price makes everyone want to come back. The omeletes are huge (6 egg) and are the standard plate size. If you'd like less, order ""the baby"" at only 3 eggs. But for a few coins more, I go regular size then have leftovers for lunch!

As everyone else has said; the banana bread & pumpkin bread are great! served both moist and warm. The potatoes are more like thick cut potato chips (but that isn't a complaint!!).  They've always managed to keep my coffee cup & water glass full.

It's a maze of rooms and filled nick-nacks. Look around at all the kitsch, you'll find something from your childhood. The hidden large back room is great for groups and children (I've seen balloon animal makers here, late mornings, on weekends). A side booth area for more of a coffee shop feel, and a main room that feels like tables have been set up in grandmas dining room.

I had the Bugsy Siegel omelette with egg whites which was one of the best omelettes I've EVER had. There were tender roast beef chunks in a savory Italian red sauce with creamy sour cream and lots of cheese. Their signature potatoes are thin crispy slices that are a cross between potato chips and home fries. I also added a pancake which was huge and fluffy--like a larger version of an ihop pancake.

I ordered the homemade corned beef hash and eggs. On their menu it says ""best you ever had"". That is 100% accurate lol. Literally the BEST corned beef hash I've ever had. This place is going to be a tradition every time I go to Vegas. Every plate comes with homemade potato chips too!

My friend ordered their vegetarian omelette which was almost the size of a football lol she finished half and loved it. You can also opt in to get the smaller portion for a dollar less.",36uvaRQNsYxHOhmB7iPZRA,1,0,5,9PuhER2hcKxBPxOcIi6jKA

There were 13 of us and our server Megan was so accommodating and definitely made for a pleasant dining experience.

I shared the chicken fried steak omelet with pepper jack.   The omelet was huge, but I found the egg to be overcooked which forced me to eat around it.  It seems to me like they concentrate more in bigger and not better.  

The plate also came with sliced potatoes which I believe were intended to be served either crispy or soft but not in between.  I did enjoy them however, but I think it was more my love for potatoes. Then you have a choice of their toast selection or a slice of their homemade pumpkin or banana nut bread.

Pricing isn't bad considering you can split your plate which I did, but they failed to mention there is a $1 charge for doing so.  I can see why, since the portions I am sure prompt people to do so more often than not, but my thing has always been not being made aware of it by our server.  Whether or not it is mentioned somewhere you should still be told by your server.    

Overall I liked how accommodating they were for our large party and offered to split checks for us without having to ask which was very nice for a change since most eating establishments frown upon this practice which is pure laziness when they hesitate or refuse to do so.   As for the food though, I still think I can cook better eggs and yet I am not a cook.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,6,4,2,k_pPtaFeoMEntxL6sEaUCA

Just looking at the menu makes you all so full already. Menu contains all sorts of dishes from breakfast to lunch, from Mexican to polish.  Definitely something new to try each time you come.

This place gives excellent service.  When I'm eating here it feels as if I'm eating at my lola's (grandma) house with all the antique collections.  The feel is very warm and cozy.  As soon as you come in to the door you're greeted right away and seated.  So many people come and go.  Only thing, worst time is around 8am. All medical students come and eat breakfast there.  But as quickly as they seat you and you order...your food comes in less than 10 minutes! 

As for the food, I had the ""egg white special."" not your typical breakfast size.  Even when you split the food, your plate is still overflowing! I like how their potatoes are like chips...quite different!  Most of all, the favorite to have here is their pumpkin nut bread. Comes warm and fresh from the oven. Every time you come, it's must!

Walking in this place is country cute and felt like an old grandmas home, I enjoyed the very cozy atmosphere. 

As we sat down we ordered two orange juices and as they were brought over by a young kid they both slipped out of his hands (maybe because he was attempting to carry 2 waters & 2 juices at the same time). All 4 drinks landed on my lap...down my legs and into my ballerina flats. What a way to start a Sunday morning off! FML!

After basically washing my ass & legs in the bathroom and my ballerina flats now squishy from taking a full bath I was pretty bummed. I decided to stay because this place was bookmarked forever & I was really hungry for some great breakfast food. I need to also point out everyone apologized & the manager came over & said my breakfast was on him. That helped but now I'm sitting here soaking wet. 

We ordered banana nut & pumpkin bread which were both great. I ordered a Black Forest ham omelet & it was massive. Unfortunately I took a few bites & was over it. The entire thing was in a puddle of grease & butter and there must have been a pound of Swiss cheese on this thing. Just a bunch of thick wads of cheese everywhere. So gross and it felt like a heart attack on a plate, no thanks. My man did enjoy his polish sausage & eggs and luckily my plate was free because it would have really sucked to pay for that.

Here's the worst part. After getting 4 cups spilled directly onto my lap they didn't charge me for my food however they charged my man for his and guess what, they also charged us for the drinks. What a joke. I could definitely get over the accident but to be known for the omelette's here and to have one of the shittiest omelette's I've ever had was too much. 

Next time when you spill anything on your customers, just a piece of advice DON'T CHARGE THEM for what was spilled on them. Common sense...",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,38,28,1,f7dGbpt1PxCLcLbdRm1P6Q

Being an out of towner, I found this place through Yelp the last time and found it again through Yelp, without realizing that I've been here before.  Both times, I was very happy with the choice.  It's a breakfast / brunch type place with good food.  The ambiance is very fitting.  You'll find a very eclectic mix of people.  I had three OLD people next to me, a gay couple across the room, and a bunch of families and younger couples too.  The decor is all wood paneled in a woodsy cabin from the west sort of look.  I liked it.  It's simple and clean.  The location is about 3.5 miles from the mid-strip and a short car-ride away.  It's in a strip mall with nothing going for it from the outside.  It's got a cheesy ""Voted Best Breakfast"" banner outside and from the looks of it, you'd never tell that it's crowded and popular inside.

I got the egg white omelet and a pancake.  The omelet comes with your choice of toast, pumpkin bread, and banana nut bread.  I chose the last one and it came piping hot and really tasty.  I put butter on it and ate it up.  It was also a good sized.  Everything was good sized.  The omelet was huge and tasty and perfectly done.  The side was potatoes thinly sliced like chips but more soggy like fries.  I liked it.  The pancake was also tasty and perfectly prepared.  It was like 9 inches across and 1 would be more than enough for most people.  I had to take it to go after finishing my omelet.

Overall, the food was very good & the place has quite the kitschy ambiance. I prefer chicken fried steak to be an actual cut-of-meat steak rather than a ground steak product. The former is rare & this place served the latter. The gravy, however, was distinctively outstanding & the potatoes, served as home-style chips, were pretty good too.

My wife had one the their famous Omelets with Swiss cheese and avocado - the avo was both inside and out and was perfectly ripe.

Our local friend (it was her first time here) had a waffle with scramble eggs and bacon.

Our meals came with those homemade potato chippy things with garlic salt everyone on yelp talked about. All I'll say here is we all enjoyed them. My wife ordered hers without salt and were a tad underdone- but the owner overheard her telling us and insisted on fixing it by bringing another plate filled with those delicious potatoes.

The coffee was ok. I prefer supper dark full bodied coffee, but I was there for good eats and the coffee was totally drinkable.

Pumpkin bread is warm. Leave off butter.

HUGE portions. Great and attentive service.  Every waiter/waitress helps you, not just yours. 

Spuds are not homefries northerners are used to. 

Corned beef hash was actual chunks of meat and obviously not from a can!  (can't say the same about other places).

Mile high omelet was too big to eat and I am big guy!

Kitschy decor, but who cares with that when the food is good!

Packed for Thursday morning, but didn't have to wait.

But if you step into this restaurant, you instantly are in another place, and it feels comfortable.  Yeah, everything is kinda woodsy, but the food is where this place really shines.  

We start off with coffee and water with our meals, or as our waiter calls it, ""a stiff coffee and a water chaser.""  Hey, this place has personality too!  ""Waiter!  Another round !""  

Omelets are huge and very delicious.  The Californian omelet has avocado, sausage and jack cheese.  American comfort food at a good price!  The only drawback is that I miss the hash browns.  They have ""spuds"" which look basically like potato chips.  

The chili is very good.  It has a little kick, but it was made for most people to enjoy, so it is not too hot.  

Sandwiches  and burgers are also very good.  They come with spuds too.  Why can't they have french fries?  You can check them out on the web.

The best words to describe Omelet House: cute, classic, comfy

The food is consistently OK, but the portions are HUGE and often unfinishable (new word). Breakfast comes with a ""chips"" option, which are delicious, fresh made slices potatoes... GET THOSE!!!

1865261,2015-08-18,14,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"Omelet House rocks! Over 30 different and unique varieties on the menu, all with clever names, a gut-busting size, and crazy-low prices! Even the varieties with fancy fillings like asparagus and lobster are still around $11, and the sheer size makes them more than shareable!

THE SPARTACUS: Asparagus, mushrooms, and cheddar, with cheese sauce on the side. You wouldn't think to combine a classy veggie like asparagus with the white trash favorite condiment of nacho cheese, but it works! Even without a protein this packs a punch, if you can eat the whole thing, it'll fill you up all day!
CHILI VERDE OMELET: pork, green chile sauce, and jack cheese. It's just slightly spicy, super meaty, and full of flavor. The green sauce is done well here, and you can add on various hot sauces at the table if you need extra heat.
SIDES: Omelets come with a bread choice and ""Rip Taylor's favorite spuds"", which are house-made potato chips, and they're pretty decent. Good mix of soggy and crisp potato slices to pick out the kind you prefer, but I wish they were seasoned better. Of your bread options, the Pumpkin Nut Bread is off the chain. Get it.

Service was attentive throughout, the whole staff hustled to flip tables and help each other out. Interior is bigger than the exterior suggests, and it's decorated country-style with homey knick-knacks and antique furniture.

We started with the fried zucchini at the suggestion of the waitress, which came with ranch and orange ""cheese"" sauce, and was good in that it just tasted like fried dough (I'm not sure why they even bother to put zucchini inside!).  I had the scrambled eggs with wheat toast and potatoes - for those of you who don't like your toast pre-soaked with butter you must ask for it dry, and beware the potatoes are sliced like potato chips but are not crunchy... not really my thing, but my boyfriend loved them.  He got an omelet made-to-order with spinach and cheese and mushrooms and it was enormous, but he made a good dent in it.  :)  

We also got the pumpkin bread and banana bread on the side and both were moist and tasty.  My better half said the coffee was surprisingly good, and we both found the service to be very friendly and quick.

1896751,2013-10-02,2,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"The Lobster Benedict was what I ordered. With no regrets. The side option was thinly sliced chip-like potatoes. I dipped these in the hollandaise that smothered my benedict dish. 

A nice selection of hot sauces: 
Tabasco, Frank's, Cholula.

Coffee wasn't great. 

The service is pretty on point. I have to say that I had forgotten who our server was because she was tag-teaming with at least 4 others. 

So when boyfriend didn't get his side of pumpkin bread, I asked the next server that refilled our coffee about it. She scanned our table and told us she would be back with it right away. 

I guess our original server saw her do this and ran over to our table. She asked the other server what she was bringing us. She told her that we hadn't gotten our bread. Original server asks me if she had brought the pumpkin bread out and I say ""no"". She then grabs our receipt from the table and says, pointing at me, ""She doesn't get bread with her dish"" to the other server. Other server says, ""Well, we forgot, so they get two now."" Original server makes a huge deal and finally says ""ugh, okay. They can have both. This time.""

So rude? So not what I was expecting? I'm more than aware that the English muffin from my benedict counts as my toast option, but when the server brought bread for both of us, I figured it was her way of making up for forgetting about us. Our original server made it seem like we were scamming them out of pumpkin bread. Did she get up early to bake it herself?

Boyfriend asked her for a to-go box for his unfinished bread. I made it a point to tell her that we only need it for the one piece, but she acted like she didn't hear me. 

I'd definitely go back to Omelet House. I would say that I'd just avoid being sat in her section, but I honesty don't remember what she looked like!",92QbGGM9PAyqtW_WVlehiw,2,1,4,fIQS-tQiAl_Qckwg4HNn6A

2120097,2018-06-14,0,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"Went to try the omelette house for the first time as we were recommended this place by a friend. The decor is old fashioned and looked like your grandmas house. The menu had a quite extensive array of omelettes ( duh why would it be called the omelette house) but also offered sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, burgers, and more. These omelettes are really big so I would suggest you guys just order one and get it split (cost 95 cents) and they just added more potatoes (kind of a hybrid of a potato home fries and a chip). For the whole family we got the chicken fried steak, the famous fried zucchini half order, and the chili verde omelette. The omelette was almost like a chicken enchilada but replace the tortilla with eggs. It was good, filling, but couldn't eat to much of it. Seemed like they used half a dozen eggs to make the darn thing. Chicken fried steak was also good and again portions are so big you can share between two people unless you eat a whole lot. Kids got the waffles and hit chocolate and that was too much for two kids The zucchini was ok as I prefer large pieces of zucchini and they made theirs like zucchini fries. Never had it with cheese dip but was good. Service was great and overall would seem like a 4 Star deal but I just couldn't do it. Omelette lovers this would be the place for you!

Sorry almost forgot and had to come edit it but the banana bread was probably he best part of the meal as it was warm and tasted pretty good. Didn't much like the pumpkin...but I'm kinda biased too about banana bread because I am still floored by the ones I have had in Maui, HI and really haven't had any better",bt1Ei1CHPN2gKnu64uBO8w,0,0,3,BFtXLB4Ukny4tYq1UCkYzQ

My son ordered ordered short-stack of pancakes which only contained two pancakes..go figure, everywhere else a short-stack is usually 3 pancakes. My son will eat just about any kind of pancakes as long as there is enough syrup pour on them. Well, let me tell you, when my kid turns down pancakes, there is something wrong with them. i had a taste and they tasted like someone took a McDonald's pancake and put it in the microwave too long, after a while they were stiff as a board. The banana bread was Very tasty but the food in my opinion was nothing special and certainly not worth the $114 we spent at this place for breakfast. I could tell no one else was too impressed with the food as they had some left over and no one wanted  take the leftovers with them. 
I was not a fan of having potato chips served with breakfast, with no options of having anything else. one last thing, if you want to order a ""baby size"" which basically is half the size of a regular omelet....you save a whole $.98 cents.....what a ripoff.

The food came out shortly after, very very quick food. And the Benedict was to die for because ""that is the best benedict ive ever had!"" Me and my boyfriend split food whenever we go out, I didnt even get to taste my boyfriends omelette because I was too full after the bread and my half of the Benedict.

First, you have to know that we were staying at the Golden Nugget, and we needed to get out of the constant thump, thump, thump that has become the staple of the casinos.  We needed calm, we needed organized, we needed the feeling of home, and boy did this place deliver.

Your town probably has one of these places.  It offers everything, but, as this was our first visit, we only got to try two things.  My wife had an egg white veggie omelet that arrived with a side of potato chips.  The chips had been freshly cut, cooked and seasoned.  She ate a few and I ate a few.  It was all good.  Her dish also came with pumpkin break, which she enjoyed.

I had the pancake, egg, and bacon breakfast.  It was good.

So, if you're downtown at one of the casinos, need some space, some calm, some 'down-home', this is a great option, and it's only about five minutes away.",_mMGDi9ZSY-r85GAEcsksg,0,0,4,ymTTuNU56yqSNiofqmCnbg

The exterior/ interior was kind of old-school, and kinda compact. 
But me, my boyfriend, and his mother decided to give this place a chance. I was hesitant because diners / cafes in Las Vegas are a 50/50 to me. 

The service was fast, and we were sat right away. Our server was on top of her game and she could tell by the look of our faces that we were newbies in this establishment She gave us time to look, and was ready to take our orders. 

Me, knowing the food and beverage industry - I could tell our server was busy, but still managed to hit our table. Also, I could see the manager was trying to hit every table as well. I wish I could remember our server's name, she was pretty awesome, pretty, blonde, and on top of her game. She definitely received more than 20% from me. 

Now to the food part, my boyfriend ordered a side of banana nut bread - and let me tell you, it came out fresh, warm, and tasted home made! The portion sizes of the breakfast were good. I ordered the waffle special, and the waffle tasted good even without syrup. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash breakfast and I was surprised to see potato like chips. The chips were different sizes, some thick and moist, others were crunchy. I kept grabbing at his plate for it. I have never been to a cafe that served this. His mom ordered stuffed french toast, and she was happy with it.

disappointed.

First of all, a big thank you to our waitress Megan.  She was awesome!  Fast friendly service and a great sense of humor.

Look no further if you want a great breakfast experience.  Breakfast entrees can easily serve 2-3 people.  There is a surcharge of 95 cents if you split an entree.

Our group ordered the following entrees.  

Kitchen Sink
Corn Beef Hash
Chile Verde Omelette
Stuffed French Toast with Apple compote
Meat Lovers Omelette

All were yummy....but my favorites were the  Kitchen Sink and Corn Beef Hash.  True to it's name, the kitchen sink had a little of everything, bacon, sausage, ham, mushrooms, 2 maybe 3 kinds of cheese, beans, bell peppers and more.  Sampling all the entrees put me into a food coma so my memory fails me.

The corn beef hash is homemade.  Yum!!Served with fried potatoes and your choice of banana or pumpkin bread.  Think extra thick potato chips.  Crunchy on the outside, some with soft centers.  My favorite was the banana bread.

Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas!  Not soon enough for hubby......

We arrived on a non-busy Wednesday morning. This is a local's joint, but I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the absence in customer service that morning.

It was odd that when my boyfriend and I were seated, the waitress NEVER returned to our table to take our orders. I forgot her name otherwise it would've been mentioned on here. She had passed us a few times, and I think she had forgotten about us. There was one occasion where she even asked us how we were doing, but she still managed to not take our orders. I'm not sure if this was an off-day for her, but the restaurant was not busy. It was strange, and it left me feeling uncomfortable.

I finally had the nerve to flag down another waitress and informed her that we were ready to order. She rudely communicated this to our waitress, and finally she came over and jotted down our orders. She apologized, but it was an empty apology, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt nonetheless.

Our dishes were delicious, don't get me wrong. The coffee could've been more bold because it was very light and watery. I'm picky with my coffee (I grind my own beans at home) and was left disappointed that the coffee didn't give me an extra kick.

I've come here on countless occasions when at UMC hospital. Just good food, service, and feel every time. 

They have a plethora of customs omelettes with countless combinations if you want to make your own. What I love is a normal size omelette is 6 eggs!! No one else does that! That's amazing. 

I haven't had a chance to have the pancakes or French toast. But just by looking at the menu and how they make them (fruit cooked inside the pancake) - that's how you're supposed to do it.

When here, you have to try the freshly made banana nut bread with butter. Soooo...good!

If you are a spuds fan, then you will love this place because that's all they serve. I'm a little disappointed that you can't swap the spuds for fruit, oatmeal, potatoes, hash browns, or even greens. That would be a great improvement if they could one or all of these.

Its a shame this restaurants owner maybe manager probably takes a lot of pride in this business but without proper management or accountability they could lose more business. The phone didn't work. Not a big deal so I just walked in and placed an order. When I got the food, the waiter nearly forgot to take payment then when I gave him my money he asked if I wanteu change back. Uh... Once I left I realized I didn't get part of my order. My fault I should've checked. The food was negligently packed, food spilled everywhere though I held it up right.

2491254,2016-07-15,0,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"Walking into this place is much like going back in time. It almost feels wrong using a cell phone inside.

It has a farmhouse type of feel--but not in a modernized, trying-to-hard-to-be-farmhouse-type of way. Like, you know it looked like that long before it was cool to look like that. 

The omelets are incredibly well-priced. They were pretty much all $11 for a 6 egg omelet (only 50 cents more for egg whites), unless you wanted a 3 egg omelet--then it's $1 less.

I got the My Little Chick-a-Dee Omelet, which had white chicken breast, onion, broccoli, and cheddar cheese. It was pretty tasty. Not the strongest of flavors, but nice and light.

My fiancee got the Rio Grande Surfer, which included chorizo sausage and cheddar cheese. I'm usually not a big chorizo fan, but this was really good quality. 

Each omelet comes with their house made potato chips, which have an oddly appealing anti-crunch to them. Absolutely addicting, but when are potato chips NOT addicting? Nonetheless, I loved the unique spin they put on them.

The honest truth is you can't beat this place price-wise. My favorite omelets are at the Peppermill across town, but those are still 4 dollars more than this place (albeit, tastier). But if you want to support a cool little piece of off-the-strip history, go to the Omelet House and you won't be disappointed.

It's been forever and a day since I last ate here and the parking sucks just as bad once the other businesses open up. The wait wasn't bad but there were a few larger parties that had to wait for their turn. I lucked out as I got there early enough and a party of one is easier to seat than two large parties. 

I don't like leaving food as much as I don't care for leftovers and the portions were so big that I ended up leaving a quarter of my breakfast because I couldn't take it to go because I'd be out and about all day and it probably wouldn't have kept. The breads are awesome which I know I ate too much of - and the Omelet I had, pretty much the Denver, was tasty enough to where I didn't drop on any condiments, like hot sauce etc. 

Service was ok but I think the fact that my face was buried in the paper was a sign to just take my order, bring my food, bring refills and bring my bill when I was done. I didn't need nor want much more than that.

Service is great, and the food is even better.  I love the banana nut bread! Warm and melted butter on top. Divine!

From the outside this place don't look like much and it's even kinda hidden in the back corner of a little strip mall.

After seeing other people getting their food and seeing huge the portions were I decided to go with the 38 special (perfect for meat lovers). The food was amazing. Every bite was packed with meat. There wasn't an overkill of cheese. I did have the large portion (6 eggs) but I could have easily done with the small portion (3 eggs). My only complaint was that they serve home fries instead of hash browns. Hash browns are not even an option.

2812185,2016-11-27,1,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"Omelet House is a great find off the Vegas Strip for a hearty American breakfast!

We came here on a lightly drizzling Sunday morning and the restaurant was jam packed! After being warned that the wait was an hour, and it was, we finally made it in. The restaurant was very organized with someone always keeping track of the line and making sure that the smaller tables go to the smaller party and the larger tables are saved for the larger party. 

All of the omelettes were excellent. They must have used at least 4-5 eggs because each portion was more than sufficient. They come with potatoes that were like crunchy like potato chips but some were thick enough to be soft and greasy and delicious! 

They also come with a side of your choosing: toast, English muffin, homemade pumpkin nut bread, banana nut bread, or tortilla. I highly recommend the pumpkin nut bread and banana nut bread! They come out still warm and are super fresh and scrumptious! 

Here are some of the omelettes we tried:
- ""The Californian"" - sausage, avocado and jack cheese - how can you go wrong? Yes, yes... I am actually from California. This was designed for people like me. 
- Rio Grande Surfer - this one had spicy Mexican sausage that went really well with flour tortillas. 

The ""Famous Friend Zucchini"" is also really good but GREASY. I highly recommend it but make sure you have the stomach for it. We only got 1/2 portion to share among 6 people and I think that was sufficient for all of us to get a bite and enjoy it. Any more than that and I think our stomach would have a hard time handling it. 

For 6 people, the bill came out to be less than $10 per person (keep in mind some of us only order salad and soup). For the amount of food we received, this was valued packed! Sure the plates did not come out in fancy decoration as one would expect from restaurants on the Strip, but this was as good as it gets at an all American diner. 

Note: 
*$0.95 charge for splitting plates
*omelette in smaller portions for $1 off.
*parties of 8+ get a 15% gratuity add on.

The parking was a bit tough given how crowded it was. I overheard some people saying to each other that they were going to go to another branch. There are 3 locations listed on the menu but since I'm not local, I have no idea how close they are from each other.

I tend to get either the lobster omelet or the lobster eggs benedict - I just love those feisty crustaceans. The portions are definitely huge, but they make great leftovers, so what's the big deal? Both lobster meals are very heavy on the lobster - giant chunks.

The first time, we stopped at here because my parents practically demanded that I give it a try! We stopped in on our way out of town for both visits, and it really was some of the best food and service for both, too.

The first time I ate here, I ordered corned beef hash, which came with eggs and potatoes if I remember correctly, and I got one of their sweet baked breads instead of toast. DELICIOUS! I also ordered a side of pancakes and split them with one of the people I was with - actually, come to think of it, I remember giving him a decent sized portion of all of my food. They don't skimp on things, let me tell you!

The second time I ate at this delicious restaurant, I tried the Eggs Benedict Lobster - SO WONDERFUL! The hollandaise isn't too rich, which I really appreciated. I rarely every enjoy hollandaise, unless I've made it myself - theirs complimented the flavor of the lobster. The eggs were done perfectly, the potatoes were delicious, and there were actual chunks of lobster. I really enjoyed my breakfast.

Speaking specifically about the second visit, myself, my partner, and our best friend were traveling. We ate at NUMEROUS places during our 4-day stay in Vegas (even a restaurant that ended up having a film crew there from the travel channel WHILE we were dining there!), and I must say, the service here blew every other place out of the water. Before eating here, we were all talking amongst ourselves about how absolutely horrendous all of our customer service experiences had been at almost every single place we'd dined at. Say we ate at 8 places - only two of them were nice, and one of those two was better than nice (guess what - it was Omelet House).

Also, it should be noted that both times we stopped in, they were pretty busy - and yet we were sat pretty much immediately.

The variety and the omelets themselves are gigantic. They're made with 6 eggs for the ""large"" and 3 eggs for the ""baby."" Personally, I think it's more bang for your buck to get the large as the price difference is only about a dollar. 

I've tried a variety of omelets and each time it was delicious. My faves are the Rio Grande Surfer and the Cowboy Special. The distribution of ingredients throughout the omelets is a little off sometimes so don't think they skimped out on you when you make that first cut!

Before Omelet House I was never a huge fan of omelets. Now, I get excited whenever I see the sign.
A tip: definitely get either the banana nut bread or pumpkin nut bread instead of the toast. It's no extra cost and is half the reason I love this place.

Ginormous portion sizes that can be shared (for a fee). I ordered the ""Plymouth Rock"" Omelet ($8.89), and was told afterwards that it's made out of 6 eggs!!! Ingredients also included turkey, guacamole and Jack cheese. I thought it could have been seasoned better, but I wonder if this is on purpose: catering to an elderly crowd perhaps. On the side was some freshly fried potato chips and moist banana bread. Overall, I was satisfied with the food.

AMBIANCE
A local breakfast spot, and certainly seemed popular. The interior felt cramped in some aisles. The decor was primarily decked in wood, as well as the walls, booths and tables. It really feels like an old-fashioned diner from a long time ago.

SERVICE
Most of the waiting staff was pleasant enough. Managed to get a refill for my soda. The main reason for the rating was this: after just eating half of the omelet, and as we were preparing to pay the check, our grandmotherly waitress cleared the table... At first I thought she was going to take it back to box it to go... Nope. And it wasn't just my order that was thrown out. My girlfriend's dish as well. Oddly enough, she didn't take away the banana bread.

There are men and women's restrooms.

You can tell that they just kept expanding into the neighboring retail spaces. Oh, and 1982 called and they want there fake flower displays back.

The Omelet House would have gotten five stars, but our server was a little crazed about taking our order within two minutes of sitting down.

I don't like how they have a split charge, but I guess their omelettes are fancy enough for that.  I mean, where else can you get a lobster omelette?  Not IHOP.

I got the King of Hearts and it was amazing!  It was huge and loaded with yummy artichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, fantastic!  It also came with these potato chip things.  Potato circles?  Potato slices?  They weren't crispy but not completely soft either.  Well no breakfast is truly complete without some potato side-dish so I ate them anyway.

My party had 3 different hosts try to seat us. There is no organization up at the door. Idk why the restaurant is laid out like this to where walking to your table you have to walk through the busser/server side station....very unorthodox.

We got sat and didn't get greeted for 17 minutes. I started timing it on my phone after 5. We had to grab another server who clearly wasn't supposed to be ours. She kind of saved this ""experience""

I specified to my server I was vegetarian and didn't touch meat. Low and behold my omelet was full of sausage. Gross. I lost my appetite after that. The avocado on my omelet was turning. Either it was originally bad or it was in the expo window wayyyyyy too long.

Banana bread was probably the best part of the meal, sadly that's not a good thing.

I'm upset with the fact no manager came over after ALL OF THIS. Maybe the server should have told the manager it was going this bad. Nothing was done on the check for anything. Losing clientele isn't a good thing, especially locals.

You could tell how popular this place is by the almost full parking lot. The server that showed us to the Garden Room, mentioned how crowded they were, probably due to it being the day after Father's Day. The Garden Room was a bit more intimate, fake plastic hanging plants and all.

Our server gave us a few minutes to look over our menus, then we decided on the following: my wife the Health Nut Omelet, since in her words ""you can't come to Omelet House without ordering an Omelet. That would be like going to IHOP without ordering pancakes"". Her extra tomatoes were noticeably missing and when brought to the server's attention he removed the        additional .79 charge. She also chose the banana nut bread which came out first. She shared it with me but I only wanted a small sample, which was very good and moist. Our plates arrived not too long after. Oh, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs. Good sauce and large portions, but I've definitely had better. I also ordered a side of 2 Turkey Sausage Patties(average).

The eggs were cold, I'm sure due in part to the cold draft coming through the door we were seated next to. 

The chicken fried steak itself was pretty good. Tender with a flaky breading covered with country gravy. However, it was served on top of what is usually fresh and crisp potato chip like, fried potatoes. I had to move the CFS to it's own plate for proper consumption. 

The service was slow at first, but once they got rolling, the coffee and water were never empty.  I would give the chicken fried steak nearly four stars, but the overall rating is only three stars this time around. I will be back.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,5,3,3,4oB5QAQTRECe3503_9R94g

I came here with a large party and several of us were determined to finish their omelettes in one sitting. I was not among that company. Just getting through 2/3 of this monstrosity took an absurd amount of effort. 

I went with the cowboy, which is basically beef chilli and cheese in an already enormous (must be at least 4  or more eggs) contraption. The chilli is tasty- I had no problem wolfing it down. Bit of advice-- If you are feeling a bit of health guilt and opt for the wheat toast as I did, make sure to ask for it UNBUTTERED or else you will be treated to two gelatinous slabs of what used to be a healthy side dish. I can't say I was impressed with the fried potatotes-- they were extremely greasy and soft. In other words, not appetizing at all. Our party ordered some fried zucchini as well which came with some tasty ranch, and some not so appealing nacho cheese like substance.

Our waitress was pretty friendly however, and I thought the coffee wasn't bad. And in terms of restaurants in vegas, this place is bordering on iconic-- it's a known landmark on Charleston and is often frequented by Old Vegas money. The selection is very impressive-- they basically have an omelette for every possible taste preference you can think of.

The menu is quite large (literally, the double-sided single page menu is printed on oversize paper), and as the name of the restaurant suggests, they have quite a few omelet options, many with clever names. They also have a full breakfast and lunch menu.

I ordered the lobster benedict, which took a while to prepare but was tasty (though I wish it came with some fruit and/or vegetables). Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.

Thanks for the reply, guy.  Apparently you didn't notice the other tables around us who walked out not appreciating having received the same kind of service. Guess they weren't ""honest"" enough either.  The woman who attended our table was actually nice and playful and she was as concerned about getting the rest of the party there, but she wasn't rude about it and getting in our faces in the same manner. That's another thing you should learn to respect: personal space. It's not nice to lean waaay over the table not really saying anything, making faces, and just kind of sweating over our plates.
And unless you had your timer on and were on it, I'd be hard pressed to say it was an hour wait. And it wasn't like the present party wasn't ordering drinks, appetizers and entrees in the meantime. 
I noticed that you only respond to negative reviews where you think you have the upper hand and can get the last word in.

3494648,2016-04-18,0,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"After getting burned on multiple Strip recommendations (that's the road, not strip clubs), I sought a highly rated breakfast place that was a little more local, away from the hungover sin fest and douchery along Las Vegas Boulevard. I'm sad to report that my new favorite omelette (or omelet?) is two time zones away from where I reside. This is why we need to eliminate time zones altogether and have one universal clock. Then that way I could have Omelet House anytime I wanted. Er, wait...

...Anyway, think Denny's, but way nicer and friendlier and less greasy. Actually, don't think Denny's. It's a quaint, old-timey establishment that is unapologetic for what it is. I'm surprised to find these kinds of friendly, no-frills restaurants with (mostly) good folks in them. That's what I get for forgetting that Las Vegas is still a city outside the Strip, with hospitals, offices, grocery stores, and friendly restaurants. My older server was delightful. And when people say the omelettes (or omelets?) are enormous, they are not lying whatsoever. They're gargantuan and hearty. And with many options to choose from, you're sure to find one to your liking. The spuds on the side, though, are basically potato chips but harder to eat. You get a choice of banana bread or pumpkin bread or toast before the meal, which is fun.

But what bothered me most here was, as a guy was bussing a table, the manager came out behind him wiping tables (typical manager, doing the easy part), and called him out in front of everybody, saying he needed to pick up the pace because his fellow associates had made complaints about him not working quicker. I hope that manager reads this: that's not okay. Do that kind of thing in private. I guarantee you that kind of management toward me would have the opposite effect than me working faster.

One-star reduction for the spuds (although they are unique, which is nice) and that manager.

I can't go and not get an order of ""Fried Zucchini Sticks"". They are the best I have ever had! They come in a half or full order and you can get cheese sauce or ranch or both for dipping. If you haven't tried them yet please do! I always get the ""Green Hornet"". It has avocado and cheese and tomatoes. I am notorious for it and just can't change it but do take a bite off my families plates hehe!

Just so you know, the omelets are made with 6 eggs so if you don't think you can eat that much you can just ask for a ""baby"" and they will make it with 3 eggs. They also give you a little off the cost for using less eggs I think it is like 75 cents or something. The spuds are so good too. I usually ask for them with no salt and love to dip them in ranch dressing.

The lines can be long but you don't wait for long and the wait is more then worth it! This last visit we waited maybe 5 minutes. They are only open for breakfast & lunch.

My hubby had Californian omelette, and loved it(insider's tip: order the baby size...it's only three eggs). All the egg entree's come with homemade potato chips(more please!)

I saved the best for last: the Lobster Eggs Benedict. Loaded with chunks....yes chunks, of lobster and topped with homemade hollandaise sauce. The eggs were cooked to perfection! It was worth jumping off the diet train and indulging. Again, this was accompanied by the those delicious homemade potato chips. 

The kids had pancakes and sides of bacon and ate every bite. This is our new go to breakfast place when in town.",uIVLLAHVeuSNI30pjHd6bQ,0,0,5,QyxsBqGllBCiymwQb15X7A

3653295,2012-10-02,2,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"Hi.  I grew up in Las Vegas and have eaten breakfast at the Omelet House many times.  My experiences have always been decent which is why I am completely disheartened by my family's last experience with the Omelet House.  Yesterday, my husband and our two children, ages 8 and 4, were running errands and decided to have breakfast there.  My husband had been fasting for blood work.  The facility was across the street and as anyone who has ever had to maneuver around Charleston and Rancho knows, it is quite difficult to get around due the no u-turn lanes and multiple lanes of traffic.  My family parked at the Omelet House and walked across the street at 9:50am.  He signed in at the blood place at 9:57am.  He returned at almost 10:25am ready to eat food and noticed that his car was missing.  The Omelet House had him towed.  Now I understand the need for ample customer parking on busy days, like weekend brunch, but it was Monday and there were many open parking spaces.  The gentleman and I use that term loosely, claimed that he waited 30 minutes to call the tow truck, but tow records show that they called at 9:52.  As my now stranded husband was trying to figure out what to do, The Omelet House staff read to him from a piece of paper something that ended in him needed to leave the premises with threat of arrest.  Did I mention he had two small children with him?  When did we stop treating people like people?  How would parking in the lot been any benefit to my family unless they were planning to eat at the Omelet House?  Well, if the purpose of the parking policy is to keep people from parking there, it worked.  I know of at least 4 people that will never park in the parking lot again.

Service is always good! This is the family atmosphere here with customers and workers alike.  For example, police officers come in frequently for breakfast, and we've seen Sheriff Lombardo and Commissioner Sisolak. They're all very friendly, saying hello or starting conversations. 

Constant coffee and water refills are still going around all the time.  Everything on the menu is hearty servings. I'm always switching it up between the omelets, French toast, and breakfast special (on the weekdays).

What I like the most, they accommodate requests. I know the potatoes can get soggy, so I request them extra crispy and they're served to perfection. Same with the baby Greek omelet, since the feta cheese can make it soggy I ask for it to be cooked well done. If your first time here wasn't to your liking, I recommend you give it another shot and request how you like certain things, they don't disappoint :)",W6eCwJposL5fN6DK_RewUw,0,0,5,gtxDxrzsRzgSAklq6jXtuQ

3754431,2015-02-22,0,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"My fiance and I have always had a weekend tradition of going out to different breakfast joints every Saturday morning. We can say with certainty we have tried at least 90% of all of the breakfast places in the Las Vegas-Henderson metro area, and we have no reason to return to any of them after we decided to stick with the Omelet House.

Unlike the most other breakfast spots like The Cracked Egg or The Egg and I, where on a weekend you will almost certainly have a 25-35 minute wait for a seat (generally the wait is outside), I have personally never waited for longer than 8 minutes to get a seat here, even when the line goes out the door. We are seated in a variety of interesting rooms with lots of neat old decor (think grandma's house), and drink orders are taken immediately, no waiting for a server! They serve topnotch Farmer Brothers coffee, which is a major plus for me since I'm a big coffee drinker. The menus are simple and descriptive, and offer all the usual breakfast fare, with a major emphasis on the omelettes. We have a few favorite servers there, and we usually get Devynn (hope I'm right on the spelling) who is nothing short of fantastic and kind. Orders are taken quickly, and I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order to arrive (I time it every weekend, just to see if maybe I'm wrong, thankfully I'm not!)

It's impossible to describe the food without it sounding like hyperbole, but I can genuinely and honestly say this is the best breakfast I have ever had. I've seen a lot of restaurants boast about their portions, and the value of those portions, but Omelet House cannot be beat in that regard. The omelettes are simply huge, and packed to the gills with whatever ingredients you like (and trust me, whatever you want, they have). I can't recall ever finishing an omelette in one sitting, come to think of it. I usually get a #9 bacon and cheddar omelette, plus I add chorizo. I couldn't tell you if it's a four-egg omelette, because it looks like they used a half-dozen eggs to make it. They also serve excellent seasoned fried potatoes with every omelette, sort of like really thick potato chips fried and seasoned with a salty garlicky mixture. Generally the potatoes are heaped on the plate to the edges, even on top of part of your omelette (which gives you a few potatoes with cheese on them!). They serve steaming breads with their entrees, currently the choice is between pumpkin or banana bread, either of which are fantastic. The portions are large enough that I usually take half of the omelette home with some potatoes and reheat it in the late afternoon for lunch or dinner.

As another important point, the value of what you get for your dollar is incredible. We pay $29 plus tip for this gigantic meal, which is basically two meals for each of us since we have a ton of leftovers (not quite Hash House A-Go-Go huge, but pretty close, and much cheaper!). The crowd is also much more mellow and friendly here, with lots of Rotary Club, motorcycle club, Elks Lodge, etc. folks coming here to enjoy some socializing. If you are worried about obnoxious kids and loud diners, you won't find them here. Just considerate older adults for the most part, which is why we love to come here (we're probably their youngest customers, we're both 28!) I also get the sense that the emplyees are well-treated, and some have been there for a very long time, which speaks for itself. I know that cooking, serving food, cleaning floors, and dealing with entitled customers can be very hard, but I've never seen it on anyone who works here. Everyone is very respectful and kind, and the manager is very direct and firm, but also respects the people who work here, and I can appreciate the good business sense.

In all, this is the best place to enjoy a good breakfast and chat with your friends and loved ones, and it's a great place to start a weekend breakfast tradition. If you do, we'll see you there every weekend, because they can consider us customers for life.",PgCPTcpjpezcBi6oSFbLMQ,1,0,5,PVF0CjSXpGyVcEIXBS5Xmw

Once inside we were seated within a few minutes, the host was nice.

She told us 5x that she would be back to take our order, we saw her walking back and forth and not making eye contact with us but she keeped saying ""I'll be back""  finally she takes our order, & then brings back our food but my order was the ham benidict  when I had ordered the lobster Benedict, I was pretty disappointed, my tummy wanted lobster. We heard the manager talking to the table next to us, apparently our waitress didn't bring take down their order correctly and didn't bring out all their plates. We felt bad for her and cut her some slack, about 10 mins later it seems like everyone left and we had the restaurant to ourselves.

Little hole-in-the-wall places that have been doing their thing for decades. Long list of omelets with silly names and unapologetically dated d√©cor with knotty pine walls. Not far from the glitz of the Strip, we found people of all ages from bikers to college kids tucking into piles of food. It felt like a glimpse of the real Vegas.

Their standard 'O-Boy Omelets' are made with SIX EGGS! Totally insane. We ordered 'Baby Omelets' made with three eggs for a little bit less money since there is no point having leftovers when you're on vacation. For choice of bread, my favorite was the pumpkin bread served piping hot. The thinly sliced side of potatoes were on the verge of being potato chips and just as addictive.

I enjoyed The Guac, but had plate envy after I tasted Mr. K's Cowboy Special (chili, cheese and onions) and kept going back for more.

3920264,2014-04-09,1,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"I could condense my review into four simple words, to be honest -

Get. The. Pumpkin. Bread.

I'm ashamed to say that I can't even remember what I'd had here.  (The pictures tell me chicken fried steak and eggs.  Not bad, now that I remember.  Pretty good, actually.)  The fries stood out because they were sort of almost like potato chips (not necessarily a bad thing) - but otherwise, it was decent, good breakfast food with nothing else that was truly a standout.

Except for that pumpkin bread.  Oh...em... effing.... GEE.  That pumpkin bread was hot, steaming, with butter slathered on the top... I can't even use any word in the English language to describe the utter deliciousness.  If I'd had my choice, I could have simply eaten that alone for breakfast and I would have been just fine with that.  Completely fine with that.  

My husband had the banana nut bread and he said that it was just as good as the pumpkin - maybe even better.  When we come back here, I'll make sure to find out and report back, heh.

If you get Julie as your server, you'll be completely and totally happy.  She was the sweetest lady with a heart of gold.  Totally deserved that extra tip we laid down.  

The decor was very countrified, paneled walls, dark and ""homey"".  No complaints here - I thought it was charming and suited the place very well.

No wait, but we came sort of late in the day (after 11:00am).

One star off, though, for the coffee.  The coffee was... in a word... abominable.  But that pumpkin bread completely makes up for it.  

I think that we could have been served warm cat excrement and had a server straight out of Dick's Last Resort on the Strip and it wouldn't have mattered, as long as I could have that pumpkin bread.

Did I mention the pumpkin bread was AWESOME?  Oh, I did, then.  

Not a bad spot to stop in for breakfast.  It's not the absolute #1 choice (you want Mr. Mama's or Kailyn's Kitchen for that)... but it's worthy.  Especially for that....oh, well, you know.  :)",aB867JHc0gxKujKuLeIxNQ,2,2,4,W3eImKiWZsBSKvNi7eTYqQ

I'm a vegetarian so i looked at the menu prior to going,  and the selection looked good and BONUS!  At the bottom of their online menu it said that you get a free entree on your birthday,  and it was my birthday (I.D.in hand in case they asked) so we went!  It took a few minutes of us standing at the door to be acknowledged or sat.  However, the gentleman that  ended up seating us was very friendly and likeable. That's about the only positive thing i have to say. 

Our server greeted us relatively quickly and seemed sweet. We ordered water and when she asked us to order we informed her we had never been there a needed just another couple of minutes to make our final selections. At least 15 minutes passed and she still hadn't come back.  As i was getting ready to go to the ladie's room,  she popped out of nowhere and we ordered. Appetizer: we ordered fried zucchini with cheese dipping sauce and ranch. Took a while for it to come out,  but tasted pretty good. I had a veggie omelet and my mom had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were HUGE,  and were decent at best. Nothing to write home about.  They were served with what looked and tasted like undercooked,  homemade potato chips. Still kind of raw, very greasy, and tasteless. The waitress dropped the bill and i politely mentioned again the it was my birthday and inquired about the free birthday entree. She said,  ""oh, we don't do that anymore,  our  website isn't up-to-date"". She even mentioned that it still had old (cheaper) pricing on the items and a lady came in with not enough money to pay her bill because she looked at it, too. She then told me that she would go ask the manager. 10 minutes later she came back and said ""I'm sorry,  he said no"". Are you freaking kidding me?! Aside from not honoring something they are still advertising,  he didn't even have the decency to come to the table and tell us no, himself? He made the waitress do it?! She then informed me that her dad is one of the owners and that she told him what was going on and he said he will take it off the menu asap.

Omelet House here is ol' skool cool.  Not to mention it's by the historic neighborhood of old Las Vegas, right near Alta where all the celebrities used to live back in the day!  If these walls could talk!  Just imagine the stories!

Located in an older strip mall just off of Charleston, Omelet House is ready to mix up a serving of nostalgia for you.  I mean, the place just oozes the past!  Kitschy items all throughout, down to the smell of days past!  Thankfully, the food is great!

I work near here and never really been in the restaurant until my wife took me one day.  She and her co-workers often frequent here for staff meetings or get-togethers.  The food here?  Some excellent, stick-to-your-ribs, no frills, no apologies...hearty EATS!  If you leave Omelet House hungry that is your own fault.  I'm a big dude and I didn't finish all my breakfast!  Cold leftovers for later, lovin' it.  Wifey and I ordered:

*Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs
*""The Sparticus"" omelet - dubbed the Kirk Douglas special, has asparagus, mushrooms, cheddar cheese & special cheese sauce on the side

Each breakfast plate is served with Spuds (kinda like potato chips but thicker), and your choice of toast, English muffin, tortillas, Homemade Pumpkin Nut Bread or Banana Nut Bread.  We chose one of each - Pumpkin Nut Bread and Banana Nut Bread.

Food didn't take too long to come from the kitchen, maybe about 20 minutes.  Big portions!  Food was warm, and more importantly - TASTY.  Those dang spuds were delightfully addictive.  Yummy with a splash of hot sauce and a dip of ketchup!  Wifey's Chicken Fried Steak was cooked well and smothered with some delicious gravy!  So so so rich.  The Sparticus omelet was great too, full of fresh asparagus and mushrooms & lots of cheddar cheese.  The side of special cheese sauce was totally unnecessary so I didn't much bother with it except to dip my spuds!  

The Pumpkin Nut Bread and the Banana Nut Bread were good but on the dry side, my only other complaint was that they tasted somewhat similar.  I love banana bread so I was hoping for more of a banana taste.

The coffee is good & strong and just kept coming.  The service was excellent as well.

Ambiance is outdated, but kind of goes with the old school feel.  Warn carpet, marinated fake leather booths, bad wood paneling about, convention sale like metal chairs, chachkies and trinkets kind of collecting dust all over the walls and for sale in their front entrance display case.

There is an extensive menu of omelets and surely something for everyone's omelet tastes.  Omelets are large and I would said simply OK.  Maybe a touch greasy.  They are served with ""homemade chips"" or you can substitute another side (some at an upcharge).   You also get a bread option with your breakfast.

Omelet House is a local chain with this since-1979 spot near UMC serving as its flagship. After seeing the line when I arrived and the longer out-the-door line when I left, I was thankful that my friends had arrived early to grab a table. Also, the layout is a bit clunky and labyrinthine but I suppose that's part of the old-school charm (along with the framed art and whatnot). I was fortunate that a server noticed my confused wandering and directed me to the rear dining room, where I found the table fairly easily.

Having last been to Omelet House a few years back (around the time during which I penned what would become one of my ROTDs), I forgot just how huge the portions are. Even the baby omelets look hefty, but I got a full-sized #39 Chicken Fried Steak omelet ($11.79) and ended up taking over half of it to-go. The omelet gets a bit dry toward the outside, but jack cheese and sausage gravy more than make up for this. I was a bit confused by my difficulty in locating chicken fried steak and decided that they'd either pounded it unnaturally thin or else used a corned beef paste (a la hash) instead, but the flavors were great overall, with no additional seasoning needed.

Out of the included-with-breakfast-entree sides, pumpkin bread was an easy choice because it had the most seasonal appeal. I did find it a little dry and had to use the vegetable oil spread (no butter, really?), and I think I would've been better served to listen to my old review and order the banana nut bread instead. Also, thick potato chips came with the entree, but they were mostly not crispy enough for my liking. I don't need them as crispy as the mass-produced packaged stuff, but most of the pieces were soft if not soggy

I also had a few pieces of Fried Zucchini ($8.89 full portion) thanks to Christie L. I could've used a more crispy texture on the batter, but I liked the juicy slices of zucchini inside. They weren't overly salty or greasy, and they went well with the dipping sauces (ranch or nacho cheese).

Considering that I did enjoy my overall meal quite a bit, I still have to give a stamp of approval to this location of Omelet House. It's a good value for simple, comforting breakfast.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,8,4,BF6CZNYUbGD3guaY9tJb1Q

I confronted the hostess who took the unfinished potatoes and showed the cook. She advised the waitress later bc she wasn't around and she advised me that was is the way their biscuits are made and she also explained she didn't know what happen to the potatoes which are usually crispy.

Given there were so many of us I called ahead to make a reservation. Well, it turns out they don't take reservations. I was told to call back about an hour before we wanted to eat so they would have a heads up. No problem.

We showed up about 11:45 and were led back to an area of the restaurant where tables could be put together for the nine of us. We were led back quite a long way too. It turns out the Omlete House is massive. There must be three or four dining areas. The hallways and corridors wind through like a labyrinth through dozens of antique decorations adorning the walls. Paintings, copper art, knick knacks Coke signs. Some of it is for sale. Some of it is not. It gives a lot to look at while waiting for your food.

The food was good. Some of my co-workers ordered omletes as that is the specialty here. Me personally, I don't care for breakfast so I ordered a pastrami sandwich on marble rye. The pastrami was sliced thick and stacked not super high but high enough to be pleasing. The rye bread was too toasted for my liking and tore up my mouth. But it tasted good enough that it didn't really matter. On the side was the ""famous"" potatoes that I don't actually like. They are almost like chips but not as thin and not as crisp. Potatoes that don't know what they want to be. Not that it made any difference. I ate most of them anyway. What really stood out was the fried zuchinni we ordered for the group. Batter fried rather than breaded and seasoned too. It was delicious. And it came with two dipping sauces. Ranch dressing and cheese sauce. I ate my pieces plain. Still good. I also was given a co-workers pumpkin bread. That might have been my favorite part of lunch. It was moist and loaded with pumpkin spice and topped with walnuts. Fantastic.

Service is very, very prompt. Portions are beyond huge. Spuds are to die for. Best we've ever had.

First of all the inside is Kitsch- it's like Grandma's house, basically. Prices are reasonable- about $10.00 per person. We've been come here for breakfast and lunch- open 7 am to 3 pm daily. The best thing for breakfast is the Eggs Benedict Lobster for $9.89- two  eggs, avocado, chunks of lobster, hollandaise sauce on top of an english muffin. It's heaven! We've had the other omelets but if we come for breakfast,  we always order the Eggs Benedict Lobster- we love it. Lunch is usually burgers (my husband gets the mushroom burger for $7.69- mushrooms, american cheese, lettuce, tomato & 1000 island dressing) or sandwiches- like the Cajun Joe- cajun seasoned chicken, mayo, lettuce and tomato for $7.99  (but there are other things on the menu like salads & chili). Both breakfast and lunch is served with their signature potato, spuds, which is really good (unless you have them soggy, which happened once). 

Service is usually very good. This location is like  a tee-pee. Especially crowded on sunday mornings. Local celebs eat here. This is one place I would really recommend to out-of-towners and other locals alike.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,5,rkhP6bCXH4grrEmAzAhPVA

The gravy had a lot of bits of ground sausage, so that was a plus.  More sausage than other places I tried here in Vegas.

Today I had the scramble, eggs with large ham chunks and onions, very tasty.  The others had omelets and are stuffed with all the goodies they like (although I don't think I would ever like an omelet with asparagus and mushrooms but that's just me). 

Each plate comes with their home potatoes which are thinly sliced like homemade potato chips but not fried to a crisp.  If your throwing caution to the wind, ask for a side of cheese sauce, it is a wonderful combination.

They have homemade soups so we ordered the ham and bean soup to go.  That will be our post night out gimme something to eat food.  I cant wait.

The mile high omellete I ordered was a little dry. Everyone elses food came out ok. The Belgian waffles are huge and so are their waffles. Most of their dishes come with spuds and we all enjoy them extra crispy. We ended up ordering an extra order coz it was that good.
The only issue I have with them is that their drinks are overpriced. Regular coffee, tea, or soda is 2.75. Their pancakes have a hint of baking soda that we could tell. Overall the service is what makes them shine. They do take good care of you. It's that at home feel that makes this place a gem that we sometimes miss being around big business. I know they will stand the test of time since they have been here a long time. Whenever in Vegas this is one of our stops for breakfast.",2bGFRUV6U06p3GxpzuHaUQ,1,0,4,XFo50ndQwet9XB2t6axgBA

4500022,2012-04-21,0,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"From the outside, you might think it's not all that appealing. It's been there since 1978 and they haven't done that much to ""update"" (which I rather love). But, Omelet House is the exact right combination of kitsch and comfort. 

The interior is like a time machine. It's got a very 70's breakfast diner vibe, kind of like a Cracker Barrel, though not as countrified and not manufactured. It feels authentic and their knick-knacks feel curated and not just cookie cutter. It's got a lot of character and charm. It feels like going to breakfast with your grandparents.  In that good way.

The staff was so warm and genuinely enthusiastic about the food. When I asked two different servers what their favorites were, they were more than happy to share. They also pointed out that their omelets are SIX eggs and the options we had when ordering: we could get it baby-sized (3 eggs) for .89 cents less. Or we could split the full-size for .95 cents more and they'll give you extra potatoes. So that's pretty cool.

The prices were on par with other breakfast spots like Cracked Egg and Babystacks. Maybe a tiny bit higher, but there are six eggs in those omelets. SIX. So you're getting a lot for your money.  Each omelet was in the $9-10 range and they are served with toast (or homemade pumpkin or banana bread) and thin-sliced breakfast potatoes (almost crispy!).  

There are maybe 15or 20 kinds of omelets to choose from. I had a baby-sized ""green chile omelet"", which had pork, chile verde and jack cheese. Even baby-sized, I could only eat half and barely made a dent in the potatoes, which were delicious. Everything was delicious, actually.

The look/texture of the chile verde was a little different than I expected. It's not *pretty*, per say, but it was *tasty*. Food around the room all looked delicious, I think it's just the nature of that particular style of sauce.  I'd eat it if offered, but don't know that I'd *order* it with so many other options.

Had a bite or two of the blueberry waffle, which was amazing, as well. Light, fluffy with the blueberry compote not overly sweet. Definitely a win when so many Belgian waffles tend to be too heavy or tough.

Two breakfasts with one orange juice was $24.65.  A little more than say, Denny's or IHOP, but much, much better.  And we brought home the leftovers to make into breakfast tacos for dinner.  

Looking forward to going again... maybe next weekend...",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,1,1,4,XFMQ4cAdOkG1K0Ww1DEYRw
4501511,2013-03-30,1,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"LOVE THIS PLACE! My family and I came here on a whim, they wanted to go to IHOP, I thought that was a lame idea, so I yelped breakfast and found this place. I've been here at least 5-6 times now and every time it is amazing and consistent. I've NEVER needed a reservation, and they are ALWAYS super busy, even late in the afternoon on a weekday. 
There are over 40 variations of omelets, and each omelet comes with a choice of bread, and a pile of sliced & fried potatoes. While there is a choice of bread, the only REAL choice is the banana nut bread. A square of it comes to you before your meal, hot with a side of butter to smother on it. My favorite omelet is The Californian, it comes with sausage, avocado and jack cheese. 
BE WARNED, come extra HUNGRY, the omelets are a whopping 6 egg omelet, and I believe the average omelet is 9.99. If you have people to share with, order the fried zucchini which is on the lunch menu. You have the option of a 1/2 order or full order, both sizable orders. They have the choice of ranch or cheese dipping sauce, I always get both.  : ) You have the option of getting a smaller 3 egg omelet, but it is only .89 cheaper, so I say it just makes sense to get the regular one and do as much damage as you can. 
The service is always great, some of the older waitress' seem like they're going to be rude, simply because they sometimes don't smile often, but they are always attentive and get your orders right and out quick. Again, this place is always busy, but the staff helps each other out, making the experience great, and turn around time efficient. I've brought my family here, including super picky younger brother and sister, and my in-laws, and everyone has loved it here. My in-laws loved the coffee FYI. My husband and I will continue to come here for as long as we live in Las Vegas, Thank you Omelet House!!",2C35gD-_d4qgN2EkBo7e0w,3,1,5,oUDnSYLN3ZlttWKqtfVNzQ

4530008,2014-10-30,1,Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA,"Experience:  I brought some out of town friends who asked me for breakfast at a local spot that wasn't touristy. I have been here about 3 to 4 times in the past and always enjoy it. This time was no different.  

Food: we started out with some of their Zuchinni Sticks, because they are so good. We got half an order, which was plenty for 3 of us. 
   They ordered omelettes, but I went to an old safety...their homemade Hash and eggs. It is so good!!!   There are big chunks of corned beef and fried with potatoes. It comes with two eggs, their delicious breakfast hash browns, which are more like yummy chips, and your choice of bread. And here's the best part...besides the normal toast, muffin choices, they have homemade Pumpkin or Banana Bread.  
Since I got my eggs over easy, I needed toast to sop it up, so I always order some Banana Bread in the side Togo. 
   The portions are huge, so there will be a Togo box, unless you downsize to half omelettes. 

Service: the service is typical of a very busy breakfast place.  Not rude or slow, but not friendly or fast. But the food is good, so I don't care. 

Facility:  this is a divey kinda place, but with an eclectic flare.  They have memorabilia from all things Vegas and old school. A lot of the items are for sale too.

After waiting an egregious amount of time to place our order we flagged down a waitress. She replied she would send someone over.

But at least that server was cute. I ordered the chicken and broccoli omelet. The food came out surprisingly quick, and he split our checks. 

Two hours later I experienced some type of demonic, food poisoning episode. I threw up, felt severe stomach cramps, and a headache. I think my head did 360 spins.

Normally on our lunch hour we go in here and I am always going to get the California omelette it has avocado sausage and cheese. I really can't think of anything better. I always get the baby omelette it only takes off about $.95 but I'm telling you you won't notice that it's baby because it's huge plus you get these fries which are more like chips and they have this crazy salty peppery chivey deliciousness on top of them. You also get your choice of bread and believe me people always rave about the pumpkin bread and people always rave about the banana bread I don't eat bananas and all of the breads have walnuts which I also don't eat so I just get a side of sourdough toast which is great. So yesterday my friend convinces me to try the chicken fingers and oh my gosh. So generally they ask you if you want ranch with them but read the menu closely because you get to choose between ranch and cheese sauce. That's right cheese sauce how evil genius is that??

FOOD: I ordered the eggs Benedict (my usual go-to at bfast joints). The order (according to the menu) came with Spuds and ""your choice of toast, English muffin, homemade pumpkin nut bread, banana bread, or tortillas"". I went with the Spuds and banana bread. The Spuds are basically potato chips with seasoning. They tasted soft and old. The banana bread was pretty good. It came out nice and warm. I wasn't blown away by the Benedict. Instead of Canadian ham, they layered it with a stack of deli ham. And there was just too much sauce. 

PRICES: ~$10/dish. According to the menu, I thought the banana bread was included but apparently it wasn't. I had to pay an extra $2.50. Coffee was $2.50 as well, includes refills. 

SERVICE: My waitress checked on me a few times and refilled my cup whenever needed. She was nice and friendly. 

Overall, I wouldn't come back here. I paid $20 total for one person. I don't mind paying that price but I've been to better bfast spots that also offer better combos and deals.",zKCAyo1rdFKu8xQGivJeUw,4,0,3,zBGSdFUVx7A_0iP60ITnPw

The food is tasty, the ideal hearty breakfast that you need to get you fueled for the day. Portion-sizes are not for the weak either, or a box might be in order, we definitely all needed one.

Since eggs are the best thing you can eat for a hangover (they soak up the toxins of alcohol) I was thoroughly satisfied with the ginormous omelet they gave me. I believe I had the chili verde omelet. You can order a small one if you can't handle the savage sized ones (only $10). 
Everyone raves about this pumpkin bread and the verdict: it's pretty good. Not anything to say OMG about but definitely should get it since it's an option other than toast.

So we decided to go out to the Las Vegas Premium outlets and found this place just a few blocks away.  It wasn't too hard to find as there was a huge sign out front and the decor gave it a real local's feel.  When we walked in the host was very friendly, asking us if we were from out of town and joking with us as he showed us to our table.  The coffee was good but the real kicker was the Banana Bread.  It came out piping hot and the texture was melt in your mouth.  And what is even more awesome as you can have it as a side if you order an Omelet!  

As a main dish I had ordered the Cowboy Omelet which was all chili.  I decided to order this as there was a rodeo and the American Country Awards going on at the same time so I felt like getting into the festivities.  My girlfriend had ordered the Lox Benedict so that we can sample two of the top recommended dishes.  Both our orders came with a hefty side of home made potato chips that were delicious.  The Omelet wasn't heavy (as i thought it was going to be) and the chili portion was perfect to the size of the dish.  It wasn't too spicy but it was definitely satisfying.  The Lox was soft and the bread underneath wasn't soaking in the egg as it kept its fluffiness.  

All in all it was a great little place to eat at if you are on the way to the outlets for a great meal and I definitely want to try the rest of the dishes there.",uQo6NDy7akFhFDWS9dpipg,2,1,5,P5MNokOhtTd5SvfIMrj2mQ

Cute and fulfilling breakfast/brunch restaurant. Portions were big. To compare, they are a bit larger than an omelet at IHOP.  I had the Cowboy Special. I would not order it again. It was tasty but chili was not to my liking. My favorite was the potato chip/fries! Loved those! My bf had the Californian and I liked that one much better. The avocado was fresh. I enjoyed that they weren't stingy with it; the omelet had plenty in it! My sister had the waffle, which I loved! It was fluffy and sweet, they consistency was perfect. I appreciated that it wasn't soggy or thin. The pumpkin bread I did not find as flavorful as I thought it would be after reading all the reviews. I found it to be bland. 

Service wasn't anything out of the ordinary, if anything, the hostess walked by us twice before saying a word to us, which is quite rude. Acknowledge your customers. The waitress was more attentive. 

I would go back to try a few other items on the menu!

They don't take reservations, its first come first serve. There was a crowd of 10 ahead of our party of two. I thought about backing out but the pictures of the old celebrities charmed me back in. 

The wood paneling and retro carpet kept my head on swivel and eyes dancing around the place. Curio cabinets, dishes, trinkets, grandmas house decor multiplied by a thousand! The heavy set patron sitting at the bench was equally attired for the place and when I asked her about the food, she rolled her eyes and said, ""please"".

She raved about how good her sandwich was and you get a generous amount of portions of each! I wasn't extremely hungry so I stuck to the oatmeal with bananas and strawberries. I know it seems so simple but this was also quite delicious! Normally when I get oatmeal it's incredibly dry....thank goodness for this place! It was absolutely delicious and again you get a generous portion. 

Service: Our server and service was okay in the beginning we were greeted with a different server who was peppy, but she politely asked the other server if that was her table. We wanted the other girl back. Other than that everyone worked well together and I was surely surprised about how packed it was!

She recommended the pumpkin muffin that came with my husband's omelette meal, and she even cut it in half so we could share. Valerie also let me know my waffle had come out a little burnt so she had them make me a new one and brought out my eggs and sausage while I waited. 

I got the waffle special and it was so delicious! Very big portions so we also have yummy leftovers for our drive back home.

We have approximately 72441675267 Omelet House locations in Vegas and I've never been to one before so I was excited for the Yelp review opportunity.  

When I parked, I was a little sketched out.  It's in a very interesting strip mall in the back corner.  When I walked in, I noticed a very outdated, old place.  Stain carpets all over the place, light wood all over the place.  In the front area, there are benches to sit on and next to it, you have a glass case with miss matched items for sale.  The place is seriously outdated and the perfect opportunity for a modern makeover.  I was expecting a staff that was older, who probably worked there since they opened back in 1954 (date is incorrect and placed there only for joking purposes).  What I got instead, was a variety of older and super young hip looking servers.  Our server was a tall, skinny guy, good looking and younger.  He was seriously an awesome server.  Super attentive to his tables, super nice and when our food came out, he took the time to review his notes and give us our plates, without yelling the order out to the table.  As a previous server myself, I really appreciated that.  He didn't have a name tag, so I can't call his name out in this review.  It didn't stop there.  The other supporting servers around, took part in helping each other out.  Refilling our coffees, checking to see if we need anything throughout our meals.  I loved the service!!  

For my meal, I teamed up with a coworker and got the following (Don't judge):  The Californian omelet and added onions and mushrooms for $9.99, the Eggs Benedict Florentine for $9.79 and a Full Stack Buttermilk Pancakes for $6.39.  Let's start with the omelet.  It was HUGE!!  Sausage, avocado and jack cheese with onions and mushrooms.  What a beautiful omelet.  You literally can save a half for later.  Jack cheese is the best cheese for this type of omelet. So savory, so good!  The Eggs Benedict has two medium eggs, with spinach and mushrooms and topped with their light Hollandaise sauce.  I love me a good Benedict and this one was no exception.  Although the Hollandaise sauce is light, they did pack on.  It was super flavorful, but maybe just a little too much.  The spinach and mushrooms took the Benedict to a whole new level, I was loving it!!!  Then you have their pancakes.  Three large cakes, super fluffy and moist.  Their syrup seems store bought, but it came to our table warm so it really made the cakes amazing!  Highly recommend these dishes!

The moral of the story, don't ever judge a book by it's cover.  This place is a gem.  When you're in the area, hang a right into the parking lot, grab a table and check them out.  You will not be disappointed!!!  I wasn't :)  Thanks guys!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,1,4,vpX0_4Y5HEdGhkwZ6-_4uA

 I got the lobster egg benedict and the BF got a Joes Special- which the menu lists with ""ground beef, spinach, garlic, onion & jack cheese and secret seasonings"" .

It was decent benedict, very homey, diner benny with a solid hollandaise.  I like that their potatoes are a cross between potato chips and griddle scalloped potatoes. 

BF couldnt finish his omelet. It was a hefty portion though I see now you can order a ""baby"" size which still is quite a portion. His omelet was pretty tasty from the bites I tried. It has fluffy egg which is my big schtick with many places who make it so well done it just gets too dense.

Best part is they have something for everyone with their extensive menu. It took us quite a while to decide and probably will each time. Now that we at least tried the breakfasts, I will try to order a lunch entree next time.

They do not have hash browns but they have spuds, which are just as good but ask for them well-done as they served me soggy, greasy ones last time, even though I asked for them to be well-done. 

The burgers here are really good, too. Medium-rare burger actually comes out pink in the middle. It's huge, juicy and thick. Our first time here, we ordered burgers because the woman next to our table was eating one and we were jealous. 

Everyone's food that passes by makes me jealous but I always love what I end up with! Except for those greasy, soggy and cold spuds, I've never had a bad experience here. They were too busy today so we opted for Jimmy John's, instead.",LxJSS9zX2nMEtjaBHNvfFg,0,0,4,n6wT-RzuX7HY8diLD-oOaw

Everyone here cares that you have THE very best experience possible.  You NEVER have to ask for something twice, NEVER have to wait for someone to clear things off your table...NEVER ask for a refill on coffee or water.  

The staff is warm, friendly & funny!   I haven't even gotten started on the food.  There will NEVER be a time when I visit Vegas and don't come to Omelet House!  

Thank you Owner Kevin and everyone here.  You guys all truly have a special place in my heart...and in my stomach!! The lobster omelet IS fantastic! The house made banana bread is to die for.

This is a true family owned and operated spot, with the whole family working here.  You will see regulars/family in here hugging and talking to the staff all the time.  It has a real down to earth feel and family owned vibe.

But you want food!  So is the food that good??  Happy to say it is!

We have come here multiple times...tried quite a bit of the menu.  Where they really shine is...you guessed it...the omelets!

We have tried multiple omelets, but my favorites by far are the LOBSTER omelet and the CHORIZO omelet!  The lobster is made with real chunks of lobster, and it is so light and fluffy, it goes down too easy and doesn't hold you down like a heavy meat and bacon omelet.  Super satisfying and awesome flavor though!  The chorizo is the opposite...super heavy and oily like chorizo should be...so much flavor and delicious going on in every bite.

By the way, the servings here are huge...we always order ""baby omelets"" which are 3 instead of 6 eggs, and we still always have leftovers.  Prices are very fair especially considering the quality and serving sizes.

The potatoes are great and everything is fresh!   And the banana and pumpkin bread are crazy good!  In the mornings, they come out piping hot!

My family and I decided to escape from the touristy buffet scenes on the strip and wanted to find where the locals go to get their grub. It was around brunch time and found the Omelet House on my Yelp app, sounds good!

The ambiance had the homey feeling, with the picture frames and figurines on the wall. The chairs were sort of janky, but I didn't care. For the food, they have a large selection of entrees, especially for the omelettes. My parents ordered off the omelette menu and my brother had the $5.99 breakfast special. They also have other breakfast options if you're not an omelette fan like me. I ordered the huevos rancheros.

The food came out and wow, the omelettes my parents ordered were GINORMOUS! How many eggs do they use to make a serving? Looked like half a dozen. It also came along with potatoes that are sliced into coin shapes, such an interesting take on homefries. However, my brother $5.99 breakfast special looked so small, which my parents donated some of their omelette for him. My huevos rancheros was perfectly portioned and loved it. the tortilla chips were a great addition to scoop up the refried beans, salsa and runny egg yolk on the plate. My parents couldn't finish their omelettes even though they gave a portion to my brother. 

Overall, great hole-in-a-wall joint. Definitely recommend those who are bulking up on protein or just simply love eggs.",Ve0z84iZ-lZYkxG4KnhxJQ,0,0,4,-Wq-bs7biq28dCBxqdIE1A

Coffee was so-so, but I'm not rating the coffee...
Wife took a bite of her ""potatoes"" (basically homemade potato chips...  Breakfast is SO much better than potato chips, homemade or not) and warned me they were extremely salty.
They were, but I enjoyed them for a few bites, then I was over them.  I love a good chorizo, so I ordered the chorizo omelette with flour tortillas.  Maybe the cook was being heavy-handed with the salt today, maybe it's always this way, I don't know, but all I can say is that we will not return.  Chorizo is salty anyway, but this was terribly salty.  And the tortillas?  I'd swear they were purchased from a supermarket, taken out of the wrapper, put on a plate and microwaved.
My wife ordered sausage and eggs.  She felt the sausage was from the freezer aisle from the same supermarket.

Omelets come with homemade chips (YUM) and choice of bread. Choose the pumpkin bread!! So good!

Omelets are about $10-$12... But are HUGE and shareable. 

KITCHEN SINK: omelet with basically everything besides the premium items (seafood, avocado, etc). This was really really good!!! And even included chilli which made everything better. GET THIS. 

LOBSTER FEST: omelet with lobster, cheese, and avocado. The lobster was really good and they are definitely generous with the lobster. However, I wouldn't order this again. Lobster is a pretty bland flavor in general, so is egg.... Making the omelet uninteresting. The individual components of this omelet were good, but all together, it didn't fit well.

Omelet arrived before I finished my pumpkin bread - kitchen definitely runs like clockwork here.  The omelet was HUGE and good, but a little heavy on the (raw) onions for my taste.  Nice chili.  The eggs were a little firmer then I like, but that's just me (my perfect omelet is Peppermill).  Was still tasty though.

I found out about this place, after my friend told me all the locals go here not far from the strip. I admit the place looked questionable from the outside, you'd never know it was a great restaurant. And when you enter, your taken back by all the novelties decorated on the walls, but I must stay the food and service is great. I had the country fried steak and eggs, and it was the best Ive ever had. The second time I went with my boyfriend and we had the pleasure of the owner actually serving us. He and his staff always showed some of the best service we ever received. Next time you visit Las Vegas, save your money from one of those high priced  hotel buffets and go here.

I had Blueberry stuffed french toast with eggs and the most perfect bacon I've ever had. The ONLY downside (and this is simply a preference and not an actual con) is the spuds. I love me some hashbrowns or country potatoes but they serve more like a roasted potato almost like a chip but softer? It was good, just not what I preferred.

This place is entirely too crowded and loud to expect actually enjoying a meal. I ordered an omelet and hashbrowns. I directly stated HASHBROWNS, but they brought me....potato chips... and they were covered in the most disgusting moldy herb mixture that unfortunately, it seems the kitchen covers everything with, it was dumped all over my omelet as well. The one, and I mean ONE saving grace of this place was the side of bread. I got the pumpkin bread and another of my party got the banana nut bread. Both were amazingly moist and flavorful. I would highly recommend here only to get a piece of bread to-go. I had one final awful experience, the waitress dropped off our check and disappeared, it took flagging down a table busser to grab my payment for it, even a man who I assume was the manager walked around personally seating people, but was equally as useless after departing.

I lived in America before Starbucks and this is still the worst. It tastes weak and burnt at the same time. Quite an achievement. No excuses for a hash house charging all the money. I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs. I did not receive poached eggs. I got something called ""steam basted"" eggs. They looked like fried eggs without the frying. Unappetizing. Finally I'm not sure what they are thinking with their potatoes. They are potato chips cut just a hair too thick to cook up crispy so most arrive just full of oil, soggy and stuck together. The single worst potato dish I have ever been served in a restaurant. That's 'two worst ever served' for this joint. English Muffin was the cheapest store brand variety.

The hostess seated us right away and led us to our table in the back area to the right past the restrooms. I was surprised on how huge the restaurant was!

When we got seated, the hostess handed us menus that were huge also! It took me awhile to decide, but I knew I was getting banana bread as my friends had highly recommended.
I ended up getting the Country Club with no tomatoes. And wow, it was delicious!! They are very generous in the content of the omelette and loved how cheesy it was. The chips it came with were so good too!! Also really big portion, so I didn't finish mine. Probably next time, I'll do the smaller portion or share with someone.

Since I was very specific about bacon, I was surprised to see the chicken. I think that perhaps my order was mixed up with someone Else's, or the server didn't hear me correctly. 

It wasn't that bad, but it was a disappointment that I didn't get my bacon. Since my husband and I often watch our carbs, (we try to go pretty strict) we both got sliced tomato's instead of potatoes.

OK now down to the nitty-gritty of the review. First off let me say that we had a large party and they quickly accommodated all of us we waited about 10 minutes to get seated. Our servers were always coming to our tables asking us if we needed anything, not to mention they had a packed out house. Inside disestablishment is like a blast to the past I took so many pictures of little Nick Nack's and pictures that were hanging on the wall because they were things that I had seen in my moms house or my grandmas house. I really enjoy the ambience of this restaurant very homey feeling and the food was really good. I ordered the Chile Verde omelette and I must say it was delicious, if you're not a big eater this is probably something you could split with another adult I only ate half of mine and I was stuffed. With every plate they give you a side of homemade potato chips let me just say bomb!
When they ask you if you want toast English muffin pumpkin or banana nut bread make sure you get the Punkin bread it was to die for and it was a huge serving once again I split it with one of the kids.

Was it all it was cracked up to be??? I'm sure you guessed by my 5 star review...YES!!!
We 1st went on a Saturday morning...the parking lot was FULL. The line to get in was long. The people leaving looked incredibly happy and overheard many say...God I am so full. 
Now, if you are looking for a swanky Las Vegas restaurant...don't come here. If you want one of the BEST breakfasts you have ever had, served by friendly staff...COME HERE!  
The owner sat us, we thought the wait would be really long...but this place is deceiving from the outside. It is HUGE inside. A maze of rooms, each in an old country theme. 
They are of course known for their omelettesso we had to try. I had the Californian. Sausage, avocado, cheese. Now mind you, this isn't an ordinary omelette...it is a 6 egg omelette, with a TON of ingredients. Normally they say avocado...it's topped with 3 little slices, not here....packed full! The sausage was yummy and the cheese was just the right amount. 
Now for the man's order...he is not a huge fan of omelettes...he loves chicken fried steak, potatoes and biscuits and gravy.  They just happen to have a chicken fried steak omelette so he gave it a try. He said it was great...but for him...the gravy is a huge deal. He said and I quote "" It is the best gravy I have ever had in a restaurant!"" The biscuits were cut in half, grilled, buttered and then covered with sausage gravy!!! 
I say customer service is a lost art...but you can tell the owner makes this a priority...the staff was so nice and we never had an empty cup. The food was served fast...and when we left they gave us a to go cup for the road! 
We have been back, on a Thursday and it was just as busy, just as tasty and friendly. We will be making this our go to place for breakfast and will be taking all of our visitors here to enjoy as well!

I tried this place on a whim, and was NOT disappointed.

It's larger than you expect.  It's tucked away in some tiny mall, out of the way, and completely unassuming.  Inside, the place is surprisingly HUGE, and very homey.  You can tell the place has been there for a while.

For starters, we got hooked up with a nice slice of pumpkin bread.  It's not overly sweet, but it has a nice amount of spice to make it incredibly tasty.  Then the meal came.  The missus got chicken fried steak, and it was delicious.  I got lobster eggs benedict.  Honestly, I was expecting something lame and wimpy, as every restaurant thinks a few little sprinkles of shredded lobster here and there suffices in any related meal.

What I got was CHUNKS.  Big, wonderful chunks of tasty sweet lobster on both parts, and the entire experience was just awesome.  I more than got what I paid for.

Prices are great, service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the wait time to be seated was surprisingly short.  It was nice to eat in  place that had a little personality, and you could tell they've been around for a while.  After eating breakfast there, I could see why.

This weekend, ""whims"" paid off, and I have a new place to frequent.  It's nice to know that I can still find ""new"" things in the neighborhood.

The banana bread was SO GOOD. Our daughter had a yummy pancake. The drink server was always on hand preemptively offering coffee refills. The good came out hot and fast.

The service that we had was 5-star and the food taste and portion size was 5-star.

We had a great incredible waitress--Amanda, but I did notice that another woman that came to our table at the end of the meal to help out was a lot less friendly and sourpussed so I am glad that we were not stuck with her otherwise this may have been a very different review.

I had the egg white omelet, veggies, add chicken with the banana nut bread and potatoes.

The Omelet was a 6 on a 1 to 5 scale.   Off the scale!  It was approx. 14.00 before tip.

The included banana nut bread was a 4 of 5--excellent taste but unhealthy.

The potatoes were a 2 of 5--really could not eat too many they were so greasy and oily and tasted from oil. Yuk!

Would definitely return for the Omelet again and try to substitute the potatoes for something else.

Restroom Side note:  The men's restroom here was a nose holder.  It was dirty, urine smell, and you had to hold your nose and get out quickly.  They probably can't clean properly because the wall tiles and floor tiles look like splattered urine so you can't know if you cleaned it.  It's not like solid white where you know immediately if you missed a spot.   My partner was unable to use the woman's restroom it was so dirty.",oAKrvdtdHsDzV2a0FRut4A,2,0,5,HHYCMhtngCU2xSYjZNExuw

Aside from all the amazing offerings here, hands down I must say that I was hooked on the Lobster Benedict from the first time I had it.  It has been hard to try anything else, especially since I don't normally frequent this place unless I need a fix.  

Although, the lobster chunk sizes has been varying, I understand that there are many factors that affect this such as, season, the economy and even natural disasters...yes i get deep when it comes to food yall.  Please believe me...budabyebye....

I have yet to ask if it is genuine lobster meat, it would shatter me to learn otherwise, but if yall get a chance to ask, let me know the verdict.  The OJ tastes like pasteurized and from concentrate, not fresh squeezed, but not why I am there.  Someone can verify this as well. #PassingTheBuck

Although, my favorite breakfast place is still Cinnamon's back in Honolulu (half and half lox with kalua pork benedict), this place goes an extra step with the exquisite nobleman offering of the king of shell fishes.  Baby Stacks attempts to give Cinnamon's some rubs, and aside from convenience, does a decent job with their own kalua pork benedict.

Location. Near the back. Kinda hard to spot from the street.

Menu. Lotta stuff to choose from. I have a decent menu pic so zoom in to scope out the gazillion options.

Foods. Basic. Nothing fancy nothing crappy some chiles or hot sauce cant fix.
The portions are epic. This make any fatty happy v(^^)v

I only got ommletes here. The liberty aka philly cheeseteak ommie was delish. Not too saturated with beef with plenty of shrooms and peppers.

The sad part is no hash browns. I dont know what its officially called but they give u potato chips. Super salty and oily. I didnt touch em. 

The homemade breads, banana or pumpkin is a must. Do not get standard wheat or sourdough. These homemade puppies are badass. I think the pumpkin bread tasted better. They are nice, fresh and hot out the oven (or microwave). Check the pics, im pretty sure i took a shot of the steam but there was poor lighting even with flash so dont quote me on it.

Blueberry pancakes were ehhhh. Very little blueberries considering the flapjack appeared to boast a 10"" diameter. For you dummies, that just means its a big ole pancake like texas sized chicks :P

Sarcasm aside, the service was top notch. Everyone was polite, it seemed like all the staff is from the South cause thats what i got. Contrary to fake news cnn, the south (think alabama or trump voters regions) have amazing hospitality. Southern hospitality is no joke!

We came here on a Monday around 11:30 AM and the place was busy. When we walked in,  there was a dining room to the left and more seating area straight ahead.  We were seated at neither location but we were led to the right and to a huge, hidden dining area. This place was pretty big!!

Like the restaurant, The menu was just as big, as we were given tabloid size laminated menu with one side with omelettes and breakfast items, and on the other side lunch items.I had to take a video of the menu because I wasn't sure my phone could capture the whole thing.  It's took us about 10 minutes to figure out what we want it, and ironically, not one of us ordered the omelet.  

We were at the Henderson location 2 years ago and Stephen ordered the house corned beef hash and eggs.   He liked it so much, he decided to order it again here.  Karen had the country scrambler, and I had the ham and eggs. 

Stephen's corned beef hash took up almost half the plate along with his to sunny-side eggs. There were chunks of beef, and you could see it definitely was made from scratch.  

Karen also had a very generous helping of eggs with chunks of ham and loads of melted cheese. My ham steak was about a half inch thick and took up the entire plate as well.  They had to serve my egg and spuds on a separate plate. 

All of the breakfast orders came with their version of spuds, which was a cross between slices of potatoes grilled almost to chip consistency. The breakfast also came with bread, which included their pumpkin or banana nut bread. 

Service was a little spotty, as it took a while to get things we asked for. We asked for Splenda, and it took a while, and I never got my refill of my Diet Coke. However, coffee cups were refilled regularly and frequently.

The painted cinderblock exterior is plain, somewhat dirty, and the sign doesn't indicate that things get any better inside. Once you walk in, your initial thoughts are confirmed, and you are blasted in the face with decor that is a mash up of country western ""goodness"" from the 1940s (i.e. probably John Wayne's living room) to the 1970's brown and orange color palette and stained glass craze. 

Yet, inside the establishment, your doubts peak, then fall. You begin to appreciate this restaurant. The service is good, friendly, and honestly, the decor grows on you. Though I was not entirely comfortable in the generic restaurant seats with their metal frames and paltry cushions, I looked around in awe. Of course, my vision was not without constant reminders that I was indeed in Las Vegas, but this is true of most establishments in this tourist hotspot.

I ordered an omelette with shrimp and cheddar cheese, though the official name escapes me; it was decent. Furthermore, the shrimp was cooked sufficiently, and I wasn't left with the feeling that the shrimp was left in a tepid pool of water to thaw. In addition to the omelette, I received potatoes. These were quite good as well. It was A LOT of food, and the prices were not exorbitant either.

All in all, I am indeed a fan. A big fan, actually. If you can get past the looks of the interior and exterior, you'll have experienced a gem in Las Vegas.",HojvptIiuuUjB40TwCptaw,1,0,4,mIp9_cH3D7uihJu6TCqWxw

You can tell it's kept with a lot of TLC. I ordered the waffle with bananas, walnuts and whip. He ordered ham and eggs. While we waited the sweet waitress Jennifer brought us a slice of banana nut bread with butter. That certainly did the trick to wake up my taste buds. They were screaming: More!  More!

I decided on the ""Mile High City"" which is basically a Denver Omelet, ham, onions and bell pepper and it was delicious. The side I ordered that came with my meal was the fresh baked walnut banana cake, mmmm so hot and flavorful! I like that they have other choices than the typical option for toast.

My boyfriend got the ""Bugsy Siegel"" which was very tasty, generous chunks of moist roast beef, Italian red sauce, sour cream and jack cheese! The Omelets are huge to say the least, I think the Server said 7 eggs? I took a bite of his Omelet not really sure if I would like that combination however it blew my mind it was so damn good!

The portions are generous, the prices reasonable for what you get! They even have a coupon in the Entertainment book for $7.00 off. We love to eat out and save money so that was a nice added bonus, I am just shocked they have a discount coupon with how big their portions are! It did the job it got us to try a new breakfast place that really delighted our taste buds! We will be back for sure!

My only dislike is that they pair their Omelets with homemade thin potato chips instead of hashed browns or Country style potatoes. The homemade chips I might like better paired with a sandwich for lunch rather than a breakfast omelet. That was just the opinion of my boyfriend and I. We will ask next time if there is a substitution option available instead of the chips.

The omelets are large in portion and the chips are the best chips I've ever had. The pumpkin bread is so amazing I forgo calorie counting when dining here. Sounds like a 5 star worthy rating right? 

Wrong, and here's why. 

The restaurant closes at 3pm. I visited the restaurant this past Saturday and Sunday, with a group of 6, both days arriving near closing.  On Saturday our food wss great with extra to take home,  however several in our group noticed a ""rushed"" tone and energy from our server. As always, we went back Sunday and I ordered the exact same omelet. An egg white omelet with added lobster and additional veggies. Our food came and I had no lobster in my omelet.  Now, due to many food restrictions and intolerances, I suggested coming here as I know the lobster omelet was satisfying and filling. However, when i told the waitress there was no lobster, she said it was in there because she told her chefs to add it, and she rushed off. I dug more through my omelet looking for lobster, and still no lobster! I told the waitress again and she pointed to egg white and said ""theres the lobster. Its shredded"". The lobster is not shredded. I just had the omelet the day before. I pointed to my friend next to me and said look at her lobster omelet,  it's not shredded. She said, well i told them to put it in there. She then went to confirm with the cooks and they said they put it in there. And offered to take off the $5 upcharge for added lobster.

Herein lies the problem:

Typically when a restaurant gets your order wrong, they can remake or fix your meal.  Because they close at 3, I was informed that my food could not be fixed because the chefs have now left! I dug through my omelet until it was scrambled eggs on a plate and there was no lobster. I told the waitress that i specifically came here and ordered this for the lobster. She took my plate to the back to the managee and it was then it was determined, yes in fact there was NO lobster in my omelet! Yes, the waitress removed the omelet from my bill,  however I left hungry, disappointed and frustrated with the service.

My suggestion to the restaurant:

The waitress takes immediate action if a plate is cooked incorrectly, especially before closing.  The cooks should not leave until the waitress verifies that all plates are prepared as ordered. 
Be mindful of your tone, you're still on the clock. 
The manager should address an issue with the customer directly. It makes for better customer service

My suggestion to patrons:

Dont visit just before closing. Or be prepared for subpar service.

I do not know if I'll be visiting here again after this experience.",Wy6PtgzAfiPAl91AlMqm4g,1,0,3,jnS6c46Nw-HUF2f3z6UfOg

Please see what the ""Owner"" posted to my initial review of his establishment.  

3/9/2016 * I think you have the wrong Omelet House. 1.We always have 5 hosts and one owner working the door on Sundays. 2.We do not have a counter or hostess station. 3. All of our 25+ floor staff are trained to make eye contact with anyone waiting to be seated and, if they are unable to seat the customer, they say something to the effect ""Someone will be with you right away.""  We are located at Charleston and Rancho. Read less 

So, first off?  I was at the establishment listed in the ""Owners"" response.  And I have no idea where his 25+ floor staff were or his hosts for that matter.  Never saw a single one of them helping of addressing anyone at the entry.  No one ever made eye contact, no one ever even recognized we were there.  Secondly, there is a sign when you enter that states ""Pease wait to be seated"".  Thirdly, the ""owner"" states he or she has no ""hostess station but they have 5 hosts! Where do these hosts work out of? What do they do? The ""owner"" needs to accept and own an honest review of his business like it or not. But saying that, what I and my party experienced in his establishment, didn't happen because he says so? Is just a sad and weak retort.  The ""owner"" can post whatever he or she wants.  The truth will be in the service they deliver.  Personally I am insulted by the ""owners"" response, for all intensive purposes, he or she is calling me a liar.

Shared the omelette but we Didn't and we Had more Than enough. I would recommend this place.",63SQ6OP3jWM_zKnPVB2qZQ,0,0,5,mvacxAOSLBOO6qTZGR8rEQ

Its cost effective and you get the most bang for your buck. I enjoy that they clean their condiments tops everynight. Making it feel like home. The only thing is they do it while your eating, reaching over you. Also, when its not busy they talk more to eachother then take your order. Other than that, food is great!",Jjga9AND-zblUeWSQfWirg,0,0,4,lB7TPVxbU5nVVgJ4PaqUJw

Do yourself a favor and drive off the strip once and a while and get yourself some good old fashioned breakfast. 
Great Omelette's and all other breakfast goodies. 

DEFINITELY GET THE BANANA BREAD!",Gq0mE84v-bHU8ShHs8mJgQ,0,0,4,6vEBd413L1FLaEc_8EwG2Q

Their homemade pumpkin bread is the best.  I highly recommend the Flatlanders Special for your breakfast!,Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,5,EWjiR41NttKUB0ZxLzbuzw

I can easily be described as a food snob. I care about presentation, service, taste, quality of ingredients.... I want it all. I'll pay a high price for great food. Fortunately, that wasn't necessary, here. The portions were enormous, the quality was impeccable, service was on-point, and the price was completely fair. 
There were 3 of us, so we ordered a variety and shared. Pancakes.... I never order these. They're just flat cake...why waste the calories? Psh, I'll tell you why... Bc the pancakes at this place are perfectly cooked with a slightly crisp exterior and soft, fluffy inside. I'm better for having eaten them. Corned beef hash....we ordered the side dish. Holy cow.... It was a heaping portion of homemade hash with both small and large pieces of corned beef that they obviously roasted. Hands down the best corned beef hash I've ever had. Turkey Benedict....they obviously roast and slice their own bird. Thick, moist, fresh turkey slices with a sliced roasted tomato, avocado, and homemade hollandaise. The traditional Eggs Benedict doesn't hold a candle to this gem. I think my eyes rolled back in my head after the first bite. Side of potatoes.... These looked like chips. Nope! They are thicker and have a more meaty, potato center. Crisp edges with a perfectly soft center. Whatever they put on these sealed the deal for them bring the best potatoes for breakfast imaginable. Oatmeal.... Call me crazy, but I order oatmeal, often. I love to top my oatmeal with sliced banana, salt, bacon pieces and cream. As the base, the oatmeal is so important and rarely am I blown away by it. The consistency, temperature, and texture was ideal. I don't know if it's this perfect every time, but I suspect so. I don't believe that hitting the bulls eye on every single dish was an accident. These people know food. 
Atmosphere..... Okay, so it's in a shopping center and it looks like you're at your grandmother's house. And? Did you come for interior decorating advice? Neither did I. It's clean, the service was fantastic and the food was better than many fine dining establishments. 
Go here. You will be glad you did. 

Darn.... Only thing I'd change is the coffee. Weak, with a dirty water flavor. With food this good, they need a rich, dark, robust coffee. If I'd had that, my head may have exploded from the experience.",Q4V3w72fEGTnZ41ACOqAeQ,0,0,5,mkIuUR1lELMxw4b0ozq0og
