WHAT the hell did I eat? A slice of pizza? 
Seriously?  You are a huge franchise operation and this doughy tomatoe paste slab of crap is what you proudly serve?

I spent 7 hours on my feet walking the convention floor...we had two choices for food... Sbarro or Nathans Hot dogs..  we chose Sbarro... I'm a Pizza connoisseur.... yes some people say the water is the cause for bad crust...but this ...this wasn't even crust.... you can see the frozen pre-made, cooked  round ""crust"" stacked on the counter in back... it's really not hard to make a palatable pizza.... good pizza sauce ...oregano,  garlic,  good quality mozzarella cheese.   That's all...  this was the most disgusting slice of pizza I have ever tasted.... I could cook up a better slice on a Betty crocker light bulb oven...at least the cheese would have been melted.

  How dare you even label your restaurant ""fresh Italian eatery""?  I am offended that you even label this Italian food.  Honestly, my Grandfather would have spat this food on the floor at your feet with just a single bite.  

Sbarro, you are the poster child of corporate greed.  Charging $8.00 for a slice of faux?   Absolutely no regard to the taste buds of your customers....you should be ashamed of yourselves.  

I'm surprised Pepsi doesn't pull out from your stores. 

UNLESS YOURE A FAN OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS, HAVE PLENTY OF ASS-GASKETS FOR THE TOILET AND  YOU VALUE THE HEALTH OF YOUR BOWELS, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  DISGUSTING.",q7fb0n95Hda5o-LvQdFHsg,0,1,1,mFYnCE05sZx9R0Etp0uKaw

And it was super dry and face like crap. 
Plus i asked for water and they refused to give me some. Don ever never get pizza here. Never ever.",GKX_k7n6dxycrri69qvM7A,0,0,1,vUbjNyNkqzm5M_YWKgQM8w

In addition there was just absolutely no flavor at all to the pizza. If stuck in the convention center all day again I would choose to not eat and save my $5 or $6 bucks. Very disappointing pizza. 

Now I know why Sbarro is only in malls, airports and convention centers.",BYigkRhnOFLj4oNigY27qQ,0,0,1,8CZEFVpvao1yxdVUnM7JsQ
