26421,2015-09-22,0,fx7HMO3eIoopvrteM-dtSw,We used to go to the Cathay House and loved it.  We were in town and thought we would check out the new ownership.  IT WAS AWFUL!  We went for the dim sum and the women pushing the carts kept passing our table without stopping.  When we finally got some food it was very tasteless.  The only good thing was we had hat tea the whole time as that was all they cared about.  We told all of our friends in the area not to go back...Its a shame as we used to send them a lot of business.  We left and we were hungry so we went somewhere else for lunch where they enjoyed giving us food,t9RcHj3E4voPUST2NtLANQ,0,0,1,GWLQKYxUR7OBd54ekydqFg

Decided to stop here after picking them up from their vacation. Apparently, it's so new, didn't even have a yelp yet ! XD so i made one while seated at a table. 

Came here on a Tuesday afternoon, around 3pm. So still ""lunch"" time. They have a lunch menu with selections that ranges in price from $4.95, $5.95, and $6.95. On top of the various selection of dishes, each dish comes with a free drink. At the time of this review (Nov 19, 2013), COLD drinks are no charge. HOT drinks have an small extra charge. (Do believe this will be reversed when the temps rise up again). According to the waiter, apparently they ran out of milk tea, but in the process of making it (wait what? its 3pm and you already out? wow...) 

So a party of 4, we had ordered 4 dishes. Curry Beef Rice, Chicken and Salted Fish Fried Rice, Singapore Style Rice Noodles (pictured with flat, describe more later), and Pan Fried Flat Noodles with Chicken.

Curry Beef Rice. Flavor was not bad. The veggies (peppers and onions) were a bit toward the raw side. Could eat one or two pieces but most was left on the plate. Was the ""smallest"" of the 4 dishes

Singapore Style Rice Noodles. Originally, this was ordered with rice noodles, like how its usually done, but apparently they ran out of rice noodles, so used flat noodles instead. (Another, uhm its 3pm, and you are out of ingredients already...? kind of thing...). Flavor wise, pretty good ! Little spicy, as you would expect from this dish. They used a lot of bean sprouts. 

Chicken and Salted Fish Fried Rice. This was done pretty well too. Good wok flavor. Not too much salted fish (sometimes can be a little overpowering when you have too much). Pretty good size too for the money. 

Pan Fried Flat Noodles. Flavor pretty good as well. Color is nice. Lots of bean sprouts as well. Think they used white chicken meat though. A lot of places would use dark meat, i think? 

Their restaurant has a more contemporary feel to it versus the usual chinese design. Fairly open-style kitchen as well? My uncle had noted that their hood/exhaust system in the kitchen was pretty strong. Something that he could notice upon entry to the restaurant. Nice point for customers to NOT smell like what they ate afterwards. 

Overall, pretty good deal for lunch. Everything was done pretty well. Size was decent. Combo'ed with a drink. Good value !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,5,2,4,-QorSZy2PFs4onf1ILLWrw

As other reviewer mentioned about the drinks which are included with the lunch meals makes these very good deals.  

They also have some packaged meals for dinner.  They come along with soup, rice and dessert.  You get to choose entrees from hot deli, Cantonese and Szechuan selections.  

Staff is friendly friendly, food is good and you can get a great value. 

Plenty of parking as well.",ZQV0YH7oIgeoMbhv8kFaCw,0,0,4,-4Ll6Sh0GQJdS-EgZhtFFQ
