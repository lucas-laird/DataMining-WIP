I was super disappointed because i drove off and went to get a sip of my drink it tasted like if it was watered down with faucet water. I dont know if they dont use filtered water for their ice or what it could have been but it was disgusting. I asked for extra toast instead of coleslaw but when i opened my box it had coleslaw and barely any fries. 
I was very dissatisfied with my order and the girl at the drive thru was not very pleasant either. Ive never experienced this lack of service at other locations!",U3_-wh6FIWwgzsXBKhfLow,0,0,2,RvDY84nuXS9ru0DVj1CT-A

However, my order got mixed up and I ended up waiting more than 15 minutes for my take out order.  When I inquired about my order to Kyle S. he went into action and had them prepare my order immediately. Kyle apologized and went over to tell his manager what  happened.   
Well, the manager on duty, not sure of his name NEVER even bothered to apologize for the mix up.  Never bothered to offer me a drink or something for sitting there all that time, he never said a word to me.  Like I just don't count.   I came back today and decided to eat in because I was taking a wonderful person out to lunch for her birthday, Ms. Anna Maria.  The food was WONDERFUL and she really enjoyed it.  When I asked to speak with the manager Mikey Anderson came over to our table, I explained the prior service and he asked for a minute to check something out..well he came back with a 5 employees and they sang Ms. Anna Maria, Happy Birthday!  I was so happy and pleased that Mikey cared enough about the customer to do this and that he  wanted us to know that Raising Cane's is not some fly by night organization.  They appreciate our business and our loyalty. This was a wonderful experience all around and I am very pleased.  Just wanted to thank Mikey for his dedication to the customer and his efforts are much appreciated.  We will be back again.

The fries were perfectly crispy with no signs of sogginess and the Texas toast was the best my wife has had. The strips themselves were luscious. Crispy. Juicy. Not greasy. We will be back for more.

The special sauce was good, but diminishing marginal utility quickly set in.  I was looking for something spicier or different.

Pros - chunks of tender  chicken pieces with a nice crisp. Service was great! The chicken sauce dip thing is yummy.

Cons - can't think of any.

I mean come on people you're going here specifically to get chicken tenders, so they must be judged according to their service of you and getting you chicken tenders.
I came to the drive-through what about four people in my car and we all have separate orders. We made that clear to the person on the other end of the drive through water thing and they said that would be fine. They took each person's orders and asked us if they had our order correctly. They also asked us if we wanted any additional sauces for our meals. They made the payment process easy when we approach the payment and pick up window and we were very pleased and able to leave quickly. That's what fast food should be like.

Got my order and food was warm however the french fries did seem to be old but not as bad as they should. The chicken tenders looked yummy, fresh, and golden brown but......There wasn't much seasoning on them at all.  It's not like I needed the salt anyway but I wanted a little flavor.  The lemondade was to die for!!!!  It was a hit so I was definitely satisfied and will come back anyway if I am in the area and close.

1614894,2017-01-02,2,9CNObWIk7w8poCo5IAtgmw,"FINALLY!  I finally satisfied my craving for Raising Cane's after 7 long, grueling years!  Let me tell you, it was every bit worth the wait!  I trudged through the cold and rain to get here!

I ordered the box:  4 tenders, cole slaw, fries, Texas toast, and a drink.  MMmmmmmm...they're every bit as good as I remembered!  I opted to take full advantage of my experience at eat alone inside the restaurant (I normally don't dine solo - I would rather get it to-go).  The interior was very nice and clean, the staff was friendly.  It didn't take very long to get my food, which was  a plus.  I had just taken the red-eye from Honolulu the night before and hadn't eaten a thing since the day before and it was almost 4pm so needless to say, I was pretty famished.

This may be blasphemy, but I know Cane's is known for its Cane sauce.  But just as I had expected, I really am not a fan of the Cane sauce.  Plus, to me, the tenders are delicious enough by themselves (and I am a condiment-holic, be it Ranch or mayonnaise).  I did get some mayo for my fries, though.  Funny thing, the only fries on this earth that I eat without dipping them into anything are McDonald's.

Back to Cane's....great food, great service.  SO glad I was able to make it down to Cane's during one of my many weekend trips to Vegas.  Hoping I can stop in again the next time I'm in town!",YSPwb5_9D96yNaB68psHYg,3,3,4,08CzBtH-wZ2WiPsoq47rfA

But I gave it a try since we don't have Raising Cane's where I'm from on the East Coast. After just the first bite, I immediately understood why people love this place! The chicken was super moist and I believe they are cooked fresh? Which is great because you know you aren't eating chicken that has been sitting under a heat lamp for however long. And the sauce was AMAZING. I'm not sure how they make their sauce so good. It's definitely unique but seemed super simple and just so good.  

The only downside is that I feel like it is a little pricey for what I would consider fast food. But you are paying for what you get and what you get is definitely worth it!",NJ92D4w6Nc02SYnGjTwBGg,1,0,5,im6T2fNT0aTbp85Nne-35g

2071862,2015-11-25,3,9CNObWIk7w8poCo5IAtgmw,"I love Cane's. This is a brand spankin new location that just opened up on Tropicana and Valley View. I always get the box combo, it comes with 4 fingers, crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, slaw, and a drink. I always get the sweet tea, it is delicious. I personally don't like their coleslaw, so I sub the slaw for extra fries. Or you could sub for extra toast. Or get no toast extra slaw, or no fries extra slaw. You get the idea. 

So normally when you think chicken fingers you think of dipping them in ranch, right? Well I do, but Cane's doesn't serve ranch! At first I was disappointed. A chicken finger without ranch is like a girl without high heels, or something like that. But they make up for that with their Cane's sauce, AKA crack sauce. That stuff is addicting. It's like a peppery ketchup but I think it's made with mayo. The box combo comes with 2 sauces but I always get more. They also have honey mustard sauce as well if you're into that.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,3,4,_4oWFKkMp3nfVrFHH2Lzpg

I highlight the bathrooms because if you've ever traveled on Tropicana near the 95, you always see the filth in that area.

First the Chicken; it was not crispy it was not juicy it was not dry either it was soft and tender to eat and only slightly warm.

The dipping sauce is like thousand Island dressing without the minced pickles similar to the In and Out sauce packet. 

I can say with all honesty, I prefer KFC original chicken it's much tastier in my opinion.

The Fries were soft and limp, the coleslaw was a Little creamier than the KFC version, the Texas Toast was the best part of the meal and the lemonade was okay.

I'm a carb lover so it only makes sense for me to order extra toast every single time. Each slice costs $1 each. The toast is made to perfection--crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and warm! The chicken tenders paired with the dipping sauce is also another must try if you've never tried Raising Canes. If you decide to opt for the meal options, you'll get crinkle cut fries along with your choice of beverage. Cole slaw is another side option. Their menu is limited, but I rather much prefer it that way because the larger the menu, the longer it takes for indecisive people to make up their mind (like me!).

Everything is made to order and comes out piping hot. Their coleslaw helps balance out all the fried goodness. It's a little bland but has a good crunch to it.  I love getting the kids meal for a cheap snack on the go. Their lemonade has the perfect balance between tart and sweet but ask for less ice otherwise you'll get a cupful of ice with a few gulps of lemonade. Fresh ingredients equals great tasting food.

Ordered the 3 finger combo with a sweet tea.
It's pretty good, but the cane sauce is where it's at! The sauce itself is pretty magical, that with the Texas toast is perfect for those late night munchies.

It's pretty convenient that it's late night, and they have have a drive thru!


The sweet tea is good, but like 90% of it is ice so I would probably opt out of getting a drink.

One thing for sure, Canes sauce is off the hook. Would it be okay for me to lick those containers clean, because seriously I want to. No better yet just hook up an IV of that sauce and pump it into my body.

On the other side of the speaker in the drive thru was the most cheerful employee who busted out a Rhyme. She apologized for the wait as I was paying. Ummmm....5 minutes is not a long wait. 

They offer two classic items here. Chicken Fingers and Chicken  sammies in a box with crinkle fries, cold slaw and some tastey Texas toast.  Sizes can fullfill any appetite. We ordered the 4 piece and the 6 piece box. They also sell fingers in large quantities. For chicken fingers these are pretty good. Lightly breaded and super moist. Crinkle fries were just okay. Kind of too soggy for me.  Between the two of us, we couldn't finish the food. Its okay, because we finished it later, cold and all.  Both meals came with a Coca-Cola product, lemonade or tea with the most perfect little ice cubes.

Located away from The Strip off Tropicana near Valley View in a shiny new building, with easy access to the 15 freeway. Plenty of parking. Easy drive thru experience. 

I am a fan. A huge fan!!

It's a simple menu- a 3 piece, 4 piece, or 6 piece combo, each comes with a drink, coleslaw, (OMG so good and consistent, creamy, chilled to perfection, and beats KFC coleslaw every time!) Texas toast, (buttery, fluffy, light, and delicious) crinkle-cut fries, (manages to stay crisp & the perfect compliment to the strips) and you CAN'T forget the sauce (the best dipping sauce of all time)!! The limited menu only allows for a consistent, quality meal every time, and Cane's has quickly become my favorite fast food meal of all time.
