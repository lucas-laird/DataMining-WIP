67565,2011-03-08,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I have been coming to S&W for Wine Week (10 wines for $10) for about 2 years (once every six months). It is one of my favorite restaurants. The atmosphere is awesome, service is homey, & the food is prepared simply and delicious. Don't expect modern skimpy food, expect generous tried & true food. I used to think this was an expensive restaurant, but now I believe that prices have caught up to S&W instead of vise versa. 
This last visit I learned 2 thing new about steak at S&W...always order the fillet, and never order the rib eye (lol). 
This visit the wine week wine selection was amazing, the highlight was the Jordan Cab. Sav.
The food ordered was:
Apps:
Scallops-delicious-3 huge pieces w/fresh & tasty produce. Good peanut sauce. 4.5/5
Flat bread w/shrimp and avocado-pretty solid app. It had a welcome amount of spice and beautiful tomatoes & avocados. 3.5/5 
Main course:
Fillet Au Poivre-perfectly cooked, well made sauce, good texture. 5/5
Cajun marinated rib eye- it came bone-in (a plus), and was cooked as ordered, med rare. However, this had way too much fat + grizzle. I know the cut of meat I ordered is supposed to have fat, but this was way too much fat. The Cajun marinade was too peppery and over powering what little meat was on the bone. 2/5
Sides:
Mashed potatoes-good, solid. 4/5
Asparagus- big, fresh, & tasty. Served w/a nice sauce to boot. I cant help but feel that I am eating health as an added bonus. 5/5
Dessert:
Coconut cake: this is one of my wife's favorite desserts anywhere. It is simply put...Amazing! Moist, fresh, not too sweet,  served w/ berries & fresh coconut, and generously served. 
The service is 4/5. 
I am not going to do the math...this is a solid 4 star restaurant. Next time when I order the fillet it will be 4.5/5 (let's hope).  I dont believe this restaurant is trying to be anything more than a good stand by type of place.
More on the rib eye/fillet deal:
The best fillets I have had came from S&W. The previous time I visited S&W, back in October 2010, I ordered a bone-in rib eye and did not care for it. This time I ordered a Cajun rib eye and it came bone-in and did not care for it. One of my favorite steak memories hands down: bone-in Cajun seasoned rib eye from n9ne. I don't care for that place, but the steak on it's own was the absolute best piece of meat I ever had-nothing else about that place was mentionable. 
More about the service:
You get one server, that's it. He/she takes your order, fills your beverage, & serves your food. In my experience the servers have always been cordial, I have seen other servers being more friendly towards other patrons, but have never received poor service.",3UpoMVDPytHKsOCAsFBUcg,1,0,4,hirjen_XG68IF8nP6lqtHQ

I had the tomahawk cut which was by far the best looking piece of meat I ever laid my eyes on.  Everyone else had the filet to each their own.

79258,2013-03-12,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I've been to this Smith & Wollensky in the past & I would've rated them 5 stars for a family style dinner I had with a group of about 20 people a few years back. But on this occasion it was Thanksgiving Dinner date. Smith & Wollensky did not disappoint. 5 stars (or circles) again

They had a nice little Prix Fixe spread for $50 per person. Worth every penny! Soup & salad, deliciously juicy turkey slices (both white & dark meat) with all the fixings (carrots, potatoes, stuffing, etc...) and choice of desert. Far too much food for me & my girlfriend to finish, though we really did try. 

The service was top notch. You would think on Thanksgiving that people who had to work would have a bit of a chip on their shoulder, but no. Everyone had a smile on their face & was more than accommodating. I think about 3 or 4 different people came to check in to see if we were doing all right. And respectfully in between courses so I didn't have to answer with a full mouth for once.

In the past, the steak here has been tender & juicy. This time around the turkey was more of the same. At $50 per person, if they have a holiday prix fixe menu, I would undoubtedly recommend it. For just their regular dinner menu, on the whole it leans slightly towards the pricey side. But the bottom line is you're getting a great meal.

Steaks were dry and seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time.  The presentation is horrible, really just a hunk of charred meat on a stark white plate.

I had the cajun ribeye.  The rub was dry, the steak was dry and it was overly charred.  Friends had the filet, with similar results.

Dessert wasn't worth it. The waiter was terrible. Didn't take drink orders. Repeatedly had to go into the kitchen looking for the waiter. We were concerned about the service and the restaurant being staffed for a party of 15. Our fears came true. One waiter for 15 people is unacceptable.

Have dined four times at S&W Las Vegas (once at the Chef's Table) with the most recent on Christmas Eve and Christmas night '16.  They were all great food & service experiences!  Have dined at other steak houses in Las Vegas, but something about the dry aged flavor of the 24 oz. rib eye at S&W makes it unique and very flavorful.  Rooted vegetables sautéed in duck fat and the wild mushrooms w/ porcini butter are always great sides.  And w/ my Crown Royal!  In Hawaii we comment with ""ono, ono and broke da mouth""!  More importantly, the sincere warm hospitality of the entire staff led by Scott Nesjan made all the difference.  He's da man!  And with Ronan at the bar, what a fantastic evening.

I love a burger, a good, solid, meaty delicious burger.  and I have eaten as many as I have found in las vegas.  Here are some comparison burgers that are all great, but not as good as the one at Smith and Wolensky:

Holstein's Gold Standard
Burger Bar's
PUB's Amsterdam
Olive's balsamic onion and truffle cheese

What made S&W's burger stand out is just a very well tasting meat aspect  It is a large meaty burger, and the flavor of the meat is what made it the best burger I've eaten in las vegas.

If you are hungry, add in the truffle mac n cheese as a side dish, it is fantastic.  We ate at the bar and enjoyed some very generous pours of wine and while it is not an inexpensive lunch if you are drinking alcohol, the great tasting food and fantastic service makes it a solid 4 stars.",GFPx32mip-47kDOGYeJzog,0,0,4,rxr57azALD3F9cQrmliyPA

I had the Marinated Cajun Ribeye, which was pretty good but disgustingly huge! lol.  I hardly did any damage to it!

I have a healthy appetite and dont like to waste food but this was totally ridiculous. My husband couldnt finish his meal either and that almost never happens!

The way they serve their sides is that they are double portions so my husband & I ordered fries & creamed spinach which each looked like they were for 4 people at least!  

The service was fine - not overly friendly but efficient and pleasant. It wasnt very busy when we were there so the atmosphere felt a little flat but I think that was becuase it was a Tuesday and was fairly late at night.

The service was very disappointing. It was confused (3 different people serving) and as a result we felt the waiters didn't care about us. Near the end of the meal one waiter asked if we were ready for desert.  My wife said we wanted to finish our wine (2nd bottle). A few minutes later another waiter dropped off a piece of cheese cake that we hadn't ordered.  We all looked at each other - What was going on? Then a few minutes later the leading waiter said it was for our daughter's birthday. That's OK but four people on one piece of cheese cake was not what we were planning on. We were hoping to order crème brulee and I wanted an Irish coffee and the ladies wanted cappuccino of decafs.. Within 3 or 4 minutes another waiter drops off the bill to be paid. What was going on? 
Well to make a long story short I told the lead waiter it was the first time I have ever been at a steak house that didn't even ask me if I wanted a cup of coffee. He acted as if we were finished, which was not the case and he had no idea because neither he nor anyone else ever asked us if we wanted anything after my wife asked for a few minutes to finish the wine.
I will never go back to ANY SMITH & WOLLENSKY again (either personally or for business). What was a really nice evening turned into a very lousy ending as a result of uncoordinated uncaring wait service.

It was nothing fancy, but it allowed us to have a clear view of the kitchen and it was nice to watch the chefs at work.  This stand alone restaurant is located on the strip and is unassuming.  I highly recommend the bone in filet.  You have a choice of steak preparations and we chose the au poivre style where they put a thin layer of coarsely ground pepper on the steak and sear it to perfection.  Our steak was perfectly cooked and leaving the bone in definitely makes a difference. I've had this style of steak at many other places and this is one of the best I've had.  It was just the perfect amount of seasoning and flavor without overpowering the integrity of the steak itself.  It tasted even better with a side of sautéed mushrooms we ordered with each bite of your steak.  
The truffled Mac and cheese was creamy and tasty, but I am never a fan of this dish at any establishment. I find that most places use truffle oil which I don't particularly like.  This may come off a little pretentious, but I only like freshly sliced truffles with my food.  If you want great truffle Mac and cheese, you must go to the Waverly Inn located in NYC. They actually shave a generous portion of fresh truffles on top of your Mac and cheese at tableside.

The food was amazing. The Truffle Macaroni and Cheese as well as the Cajun steaks were some of the best we had ever had. Our server, Heidi, was absolutely abysmal. She was rude, condescending and one of the worst servers I have ever been in contact with. She told us it would take hours to separate alcoholic drinks from the rest of the bill. We were assured several times that two servers would be serving the party, but we never saw anyone but her. When this concern was expressed, she of course was rude and quick to say it was under control.

The low point of our experience was three people in our party missing their meals. The server was so awful that she didn't even realize this, and when it was brought up she made sure to say it wasn't her fault. After a 30 minute wait, the other people finally got their food (by now everyone was finished).

Heidi then took her server pad and threw it down, consequently breaking a plate.

By this time, I had had enough. I promptly went to the manager and expressed my concern. The management was wonderful and understanding. They really made the night better and without such great staff (with the obvious exception of Heidi), this night would have been forfeit completely.",L721D9afHL5yRcqZWMCifA,0,0,3,dqVaww_d_53jXnog20T5mA

776613,2011-04-22,3,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Smith and Wolls baby...when I hear those words I am quickly bombarded of thoughts of me and my boys in Vegas about to have a great night filled with classy women, soberness and average steaks! Ok I am exaggerating on all fronts here but the bottom line is Smith and Wollensky is what we thought they were--an outstanding steakhouse. If you read there tagline, ""It's a place to end all arguments"" and after one visit, you will quickly learn why! Matter a fact if she can't get over the fact you were texting a random on behalf of your friend who lost his cell phone *wink wink* then run my friend, run. Because if she can't forgive you after wolving down a $50 steak, your SOL and she can go eat at the Olive Garden with the next chump she meets! Good riddance sista..ok back to the food. 

I'm a creature of habit so I order pretty much the same thing every time..if it aint broke, don't fix it right? First off you have to wet the palate! Beefeater straight up with Olives Sir (throw a little bass in your voice too). 

Next up, the Wedge salad! Um..excuse me waiter, can you tell the chef don't be tight with the Blue Cheese! He will usually laugh and wa-la you got extra complimentary Blue Cheese! Fuckin A!!  

Next Order the cajun ribeye if you like a little kick to your steak and you won't be disappointed. And don't be that guy that orders it Well Done, act like you've been there before and calmly say, medium rare thanks...I'll usually go with this cut and it takes up the entire plate. Also at this time I will order a glass of Pinot or Cab and tell them you want it delivered simultaneously with the steak!

As for sides there Mac and Cheese is without question the best Mac and Cheese on the planet. Other sides that are worth trying, the sauteed mushrooms, grilled asparagus and of course the twiced baked potatoe. Also there seafood tower is legit although I don't reccommend it if your palate is set on beef because it's overkill with all the food and you might of walked in looking like Vin Diesel, but after indulging you might leave looking like Tony Soprano, so be forewarned. (This happened to me once, was on a date and somehow the fuckin shirt shrunk during dinner and when I left, I couldn't breathe! dohhh)

As for cocktails, the mixologists here do a great job here on whipping up that concoction that you enjoy. Extensive wine list and a great selection of wines by the glass. On the side bar, I believe they still sell cigars although I am not sure where you can fire up at. There scotch selection is great and I reccommend going with an 18 year Glenlivet single malt to wash down that great meal. 

Look let's face it, you're in Vegas, your going to drop $200 easy gambling, at the club or at the strippy...SO do yourself a favor and call your concierge at your hotel and tell that cocksucker you need a reservation at Smith and Wolls baby!

828029,2015-02-15,1,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Valentine's Day dinner 2K15. I'll remember this one because there's a story to tell.

Got a reservation for 2 at Smith & Wollensky. I drive by the restaurant every so often and always say I've got to try that place. So we did. Besides trying to make a right into the driveway off of Las Vegas Blvd (tons and tons of walkers crossing the driveway), once you make it over, they've got a nice valet waiting for you. You literally get out of your car and you walk right into the restaurant.

We walk in and the first thing that grabs my attention is a wedding party enjoying their reception dinner. I thought, that's cool. So we check in and the host escorts us to a cozy table adjacent to the wedding party. After sitting down for a couple minutes, one of the guests from the wedding party is heard having a good time, ranting/raving about stuff...we figure he's feelin' good, no worries. But as the minutes go by, we hear him raising his voice, ranting across the table to the bride or groom, using profanities. I take a little peak (as my back was facing him), and this dude is totally faded and wearing a Yankee ball cap and jeans. I look around and everyone else is either suited n booted or in business casual, including myself. 

So after the waiter greeted us and went over the menu, we (and others around us in this part of the dining room) were subjected to not only this inebriated ghetto knucklehead, but the bride AND groom got in on the action about how slow service was and that they were going to leave and go to IN N OUT. 

I inconspicuously made my way over to the host and told her what was going on and requested to move. (Honestly i was thinking chances were zero of moving b/c it was Valentine's Day and the place was booked). But Gina, the host, immediately apologized on the restaurant's behalf and found us a table upstairs with no hesitation.

Here's the kicker: as we got up to move and had to walk right past the wedding party, many people from the party started taunting us. It was weird b/c all of a sudden me and my wife were the center of attention while we were leaving. We didn't make eye contact nor engage with those crazy people.

We got upstairs and sat in a beautiful table overlooking the Strip. The night turned from ""Oh my God"" to what we had expected...a nice quiet Valentines Dinner. This incident and the way in which the staff handled it prompted me to give them 5-stars. They were extremely polite, professional, and apologetic. I felt for them in dealing with that nasty wedding party, especially in an establishment like this, but oh well...it happens from time to time.

To finish my review and not to diminish the other parts of this dining experience, I'll keep it short and sweet:
Service: impeccable...some of the best customer service I've ever had
Food: as expected...excellent filet mignon and wild mushrooms
Ambiance: perfect (upstairs, of course)
Price: once again, as expected. This is fine dining with fine dining prices. Oh, and I think our waiter didn't charge us for the $20 martini maybe b/c of the initial incident. 
Thank you Smith & Wollensky. It was a memorable night.",okRZtLfI7tlfGqQxUo53fg,6,0,5,z8RSQV1DnM2qUHKtGBxLzw

If dining indoors, the decor is has a hint of western influence, as it is slightly saloon-like. We dined outdoors on the patio located parallel to the strip's pedestrian traffic. This made for a bit of natural entertainment throughout our meal.

The food was tasty and moderately priced. I had a steak with a side of mushrooms while my friend enjoyed lobster tail. This restaurant provided one of the better dining experiences I had in my short visit to the city. 

The service was great. Our waiter was friendly and attentive..... and somewhat psychic. He gave us a generous birthday dessert at the end of the meal. It was my friend's birthday, but I didn't inform him of this and neither did my friend. Hmmm....

We paid our bill in full, THEN approached the Manager - who said ""well nobody else ever complains"" - I mean WTF is that?????  I have never heard a response like this at any fine establishment, and I have been to Peter Luegeres, Charlie Palmers, Ruths Chris, Mortons, Nick and Stefs, Mastros, Flemings, etc.........

She hands us a business card....and kind of blows it off. 

Well guess what.....I will be sure to tell every person I can about this experience.  

The waitress was a sweetheart and did a great job overall. 

Too Bad we will never see her again! Paying $80 for a steak better deliver perfect results!!! period!",ryaEZAY-SynlLoR5tGUCfw,12,3,1,xMF_5zEMu1f2tthlt70-jA

Date: May 24, 2009 @ 11:38 PM

Occasion:  Weekend Getaway with Boyfriend and My Whole Family
                     
Venue:  Vegas, Baby! Smith and Wollensky is a steak/lobster restaurant on the strip across from Monte Carlo.

Ambiance/Decor: Americana. Could be used as a venue for Gangster Movies in the 30's. Rustic Wood Tables.  Real clothtowels in the bathroom instead of papertowels. 

Social Scene: Loud and rowdy group of friends at one table dressed to the nines. Two couples (including me and boyfriend) trying to have a quiet dinner in Vegas.

Service:  Excellent! 

What we ordered:
Salud!:  A glass of Smith and Wollensky Napa Reserve $18
               Iced Tea    $ 4.75
Food:  2 Whole Lobsters and 10 oz Steak for me and BF $59 each
            4 pcs Oysters on Half-Shell $16

Total: $193.90 including tax and tip

Overall:
1.  Being with my Asian family who loves buffets, BF and I wanted to have a nice quiet dinner by ourselves that will not include stuffing ourselves with 40 dishes.  So, we sneaked out!

2.  Believe it or not, the restaurants on the strip were closed at 11PM except the bars and clubs. Smith and Wollensky was the only place that was open  until midnight.  That's how we ended here by accident.

3.  The dinner was disappointing considering how expensive it was.  The steak was burnt (no,not charbroiled) dry and bland that BF and I ended up dipping the steak in the sauce that came for the lobster.    The small lobster came with a rich sauce and hot melted butter on the side. It was rubbery. BF said maybe because we were the last customers for the evening. Not good enough excuse for a $200 dinner!

4.  If you are in Vegas, skip this place. There are so many fine dining available out there!

I'll keep this review short and sweet since WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN VEGAS.   One thing's for sure though, Boyfriend and I had a memorable and  romantic weekend in Las Vegas! ;)",g6TmwkyUY4tquHreLluC2Q,5,5,2,eAqpAHVYrVoB5jW9exsdLA

I'm kind of glad because if I saw what we see on the shows I would not have enjoyed my meal.  

I ordered the signature bone in NY cut sirloin, medium rare--it was perfectly medium rare and perfectly seasoned.  I wish that I could have finished it, but I just couldn't--the portions were huge!  I can't remember what my husband ordered, but it was a giant rib that hung way off the plate!  It obviously was delicious because he pretty much finished it.  Even if you are not a steak eater, you will find something on the menu that will satisfy you.  My daughter said that her salmon was fit for a 5 star seafood restaurant. 

Our waiter was very helpful in making suggestions.  He was also good at reading people because when he asked if we wanted more bread, there was a bit of silence, so he just put some on the table, taking our split second of hesitation as a ""yes"".  

This is one of the few places where I will eat the steak tartare--loved it.  We also got the usual sides--mushrooms, asparagus, baked potatoes--passed on the truffle mac and cheese this time which is amazing, too.  The one thing that I am sad about is that they've removed the pork shank from the menu.  My mother-in-law said they brought it back as a special once, so I was praying and praying that it would be on the menu as a special again . . . no such luck.

There are much better high-end steak houses in Vegas,  went with a large party and the food was just average at five star prices.  Three people in our party steaks where undercooked and they argued with us like we wanted something for free.  This chain has struggled for years and it is not hard to see why;  the steak should be of prime quality and you should know how to cook at the proper temps.   My guess is they think the it is the economy is making for tough times for this chain and not that they don't know how to run a good steak house.  Got a tip for upper management, go to Gibson's in Chicago and eat there and get your pointers from them and you will see what sets them apart from your chain.  Gibson's has lines out the door and people waiting to eat at a huge restaurant.  It seems as though your company is following Texas Road House but charging five star prices.  We had a group of 10 and the price was over $2,000 which we are happy to pay...we only want the experience that should go along with that price tag!

Update on how they treat people 1/26/13:
An Italian tourist forgot his wallet and landed in jail. Ok, he actually forgot his wallet after ordering $208 worth of food at high-end New York steakhouse, Smith & Wollensky. When he realized his mistake, Graziano Graziussi offered to leave his iPhone as collateral. Then he asked a busboy to accompany him to his hotel to get the money. However, the Steakhouse still called the cops. Probably, yelling something like ""...if you wanted compromise you should have eaten at Applebees!""
This article is real and posted to support that this company really needs better leadership as they think the customer is the enemy that is somehow trying to get something for free!

The beau and I wasn't all that hungry, so we decided to get 1 appetizer and main course to share. Always a good idea to share when you are not all that hungry. We don't want any good steak to go to waste. 

For appetizer we had Truffles Mac and Cheese, OMG! It was delicious! Thank you fellow Yelper for the awesome suggestion! None of it went to waste, every little bit of it was taken care of by my tummy.

As for the main course, we shared Wollensky Steak. Very YUM! It came with 6 pieces of thickly sliced steak with a little sauce on the side. Crab (big pieces of crab meat) salad served on a sea shell. And some steam veggies lined up in the center. Very yum! And just enough for 2 people who are not so hungry to share.

Customer service was a plus, very nice and knowledgeable staff. Had a lot of suggestions for us, since it was our first time there. 

For those who ate steak during the meal, they actually bring out a different type of knife for you to use. It was nice and shiny, and for sure very sharp. I need one of those at home. Ha ha.

If you want shocking service, be totally ignored but have a well cooked steak - this is the place to go. Just don't expect a first class customer experience. For the price - I expected far more.",kRg4a1oPQ2ZXDpMSAQJ9Nw,0,0,2,dPpE29POqk41ghCZkUncVA

I ate here on Friday, and it is  now Tuesday, and I am still afraid to check my credit card statement.  Whatever.  This place is fantastic.  I have never in my life seen a seafood platter as stacked as this one.  I stuck with a seafood theme all night and rocked some calamari and then scallops for dinner.

When we arrived, we were told that there were no tables available and that the hostess just wanted us to come and wait. Fortunately, there were tables outside available after a few minutes wait.

Our waiter, who didn't come to our table for 5 minutes or so, gave us our menus and walked away. When he came back again, he said, ""Did you guys already order drinks?"" We hadn't. Isn't it his job to ask for our drink orders? So we order drinks. He forgets two of them. It takes him another 10 minutes, roughly, to get back to our table and take our order. Basically, the entire night, our waiter paid us very little attention. 

Our food was mediocre. When you are paying $50 per entree with everything else a la carte, your food better be effing spectacular. It wasn't. I got the filet, oscar style, which was $51, plus two sides, which were another $25.  My steak was overdone to the degree that I couldn't chew some of it. The mashed potatoes were good, but a small portion for $12. The asparagus was also good, but again, it was $12 for a two person portion.

The reviews from the other six guys were very similar. The food was fine, but nothing special at those prices. For the seven of us, the bill came to $575. I wouldn't go back. It is WAY overpriced for the quality and service we got that night.",8rpUyNaiP2gE6p0Zqd1HgA,1,0,1,QX3Ix5HzEzve8nrlh6UkZg

I wasn't super impressed with the sides, I felt they lacked some seasoning/flavor. The rib eye was on point though, cooked to a juicy perfection.

The beef would have been great even without the Gorgonzola.  Somebody at the table ordered the Rib-eye.  He was in heaven as well.  One person ordered a lesser steak (sirloin).  He was not satisfied, but knowing this person, I attribute this to bad taste buds and not the restaurant's fault. Steaks were about $35-$45 each.
Most of the side dishes were very good.  The creamed spinach was excellent.  The asparagus was also very good (and enough to feed a small country).  I was very disappointed with the mashed potatoes.  I expected them to be better.  Somebody at my table ordered french fries.  They were pretty good.  WARNING: each side dish feeds at least 2 people, so don't order too many (like we did).  Side dishes were about $12 each.
We also ordered creme brulee for dessert.  Not a big fan of creme brulee.  It was ok.
Total bill for 6 people = over $350; my share (2 people) = $165 (tip included).  So make sure you don't spend all of your money at the casinos beforehand.

This place I've been to twice. Each time I've been very happy with what I received. The first time we had a bachelor party 7 guys dressed in suits. We wanted to start our Vegas trip off right. We each had a fillet minion and 1 guy got the prime rib. We also included 2 bottles of wine. The selection was good according to our wine guy, We got Asparagus spears, mashed potatoes, and truffle encrusted macaroni and cheese. The mac was the best I've every had. Mashed potatoes were mediocre at best. The Asparagus was cooked perfectly. The steaks were cooked perfectly. The peppercorn sauce or simply grilled are the way to go. I enjoyed the Cajun style mixed with the peppercorn sauce but I'm not a minimalist when it comes to steaks, I like saucing it up a little.

The second time I came I got the prime rib bail out special. For $49 bucks you get an app, main course and a dessert. What a spectacular deal. The prime rib was perfect. The warm salad was terrific as a start and the dessert was incredible. As a word of warning the desserts are a little large and you may need help finishing it off.

Well, considering it was 105 degree heat outside, we didn't want to venture too far from our hotel. We ended up stumbling into Smith and Wollensky. We were going to try a different steak house but it was snugged away in a suspicious looking alley way.

Anyhow, upon arriving we were seated. There weren't too many other people in the restaurant and we started to think this wasn't the best choice of restaurant. We got our water from a waiter, and then was left to flag someone down when we were ready to order. No one came by to check up on us (and for the rest of the lunch for that matter). One of the reasons is that all the servers are guys, and a baseball game was on. I understand that sports draws your attention, but if you have hungry people at a table anxiously waiting to order, take a break!

We didn't touch any of the seafood items because we would be heading to a seafood buffet that night. We ordered a bone-in ribeye steak, and a sirloin. To accompany the meal, we picked out the truffle macaroni and cheese.

20 minutes later, we receive our meal (which was preceded by a bread bowl which was hardly that... think of Wetzel's Pretzels). Thankfully, our food came out pretty decent. The meats were both tender, and cooked almost perfectly. Mine was a bit on the charred side. The true star was the mac and cheese. With the savory flavor of the truffle oil, it was the stand out... that doesn't sit well for a place that claims they are a good steakhouse.

All in all, the service is lackluster and while the food tasted good, it really doesn't match up for the pricing this place is asking for. Considering we came all this way for some good steak, it just doesn't seem all that worth it.",bW6VMyB5r05Yze44Ora0pA,1,1,2,DFTQeq2YcFCZQZosPBQlNA

I also enjoy cooking steaks myself and have geeked out on the details on cuts and cooking techniques.  I know steaks.  And I know a prime filet mignon shouldn't leave you spitting out chunks of jello-like, crunching, unchewable gristle.  Heck, an Outback Steakhouse filet shouldn't do that - it's a filet!

I wasn't going to say anything at first since I was enjoying my meal with my (very drunk) friend (I was sober).  But then I got some backbone and realized I'm paying real money for this and should give them the chance to give me a good experience.  

The waiter, then the manager, were condescending pr*cks.  ""Sir, you don't understand what a fine steak is like.  A better steak has fat inside it that provides flavor ..."".  Marbling is Steak 101 - if THEY knew what a fine steak is like they'd know marbling is thin streaks of fat that dissolve during cooking, and that a filet has very low fat anyways.  Seeing my drunk friend, he obviously assumed I was also drunk and made me feel like we were lowlifes doing a once-in-a-lifetime splurge and not understanding steaks; or making it up as a form of dine-and-dash (despite the chunks of fat in my napkin).

We were a party of four, celebrating a birthday in a top end restaurant.  And too their credit, the mac and cheese side was about the best I have ever tried.  We also had a fillet and lobster combo which is highly recommended for those who like the ultimate surf and turf.

I had the dry aged sirloin.  It was flavorful, but, about as tough as a steak could be, plenty of gristle, and not what I expected.   I ordered medium, and got it somewhere between rare and mid rare, not the end of the world, but, when you shell out $400 bucks plus for dinner for 4, one might have higher expectations.

The server was very friendly, however, didn't appear to have time deal with us.  His insight and suggestions were helpful, but, the service was very slow.  We sat at 6:30 thinking we would be done by 8, and and left about 9:15.

They did provide a complimentary chocolate cake for the birthday.  We only ate a bite or two while waiting 20 minutes or more for the other dessert to arrive.  When the other dessert arrived, the barely eaten chocolate cake was snatched away from us before we even noticed what happened.

As far as the food goes, I thought my steak (beef filet) was actually decent.  It was cooked properly at medium rare.  The only problem was that it was a little on the salty side.  The a la carte sides were nothing special.  I did have a crab cake to start and that was mediocre.

For dessert, they talked up the pecan pie.  I ordered that, and it was nothing special though the large man next to me who took some bites from it seemed like he was in love.

The chocolate cake dessert is huge...the 3 of us couldn't finish it.  But we were all full.  Although Im not a huge cake fan...I loved the cake...it was a dark chocolate cake...therefore not too sweet...oh yummmmm (i love bitter things cuz im bitter LOL)

The Cajun ribeye was recommended and all 3 of us ordered that.  The Cajun was good, but not like out of this world or anything.  I'd probably order the regular ribeye next time if I went again.

For our sides we ordered the mac cheese, french fries and asparagus.  Asparagus was hardly touched, french fries were pretty good but the Mac Cheese was the winner of the night.  This is the best mac cheese I have ever had.  I wanted to order another order.  

My friend and I had a bottle of Syrah which was pretty good at ($58)..but i've had better.  My other friend had like 5 cocktails of jack on the rocks.  (that's a lot then he had 3 doubles at a bar after dinner!)

The bread that came out was very good to start.

For appetizers we ordered:  Crab, Lobster, Shrimp.  This was very good.  (forgot the price).  I'd order this again though.

Service was good considering we were being kind of obnoxious.  We had two servers helping us...both named Scott.

The burger was huge with bacon and cheese of your choice. It was so juicy I got a drip on my lap so lean over when you bite.

Smith & Wollensky was the decided restaurant for dinner for a friend's bachelorette party before a night out of club crawling. I mentioned to the host that we needed to be somewhere by 9:30pm.

BOTTOM LINE IS: The service was absolutely phenomenal. Every wait staff was very friendly, our bill was split with no questions asked, the waiter offered to take a group picture of us, politely reminded us that we should order soon so we get out of their in time, water was filled regularly, as well as being checked up on regularly, AND we received free shots for the party.

We then shared the prime rib (with bone), with a side of cajun shrimp and crab legs; mac and cheese, spinach, and the wollensky salad. Everything was delicious -- the prime rib was juicy, the crab legs had a delicious lemon butter sauce, and shrimp was not overcooked.

1767481,2014-11-01,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I have been to this Smith & Wollensky location at least 5 times previously. At one time it was What Smith & Wollensky should be; A great steak house. Sadly, no more. 

This is a long overdue correction and amplification of the review below. The manager contacted me. He was gracious and apologized...and refunded what we spent, which I did not expect. My comments below still stand, but I'll have to believe that our waiter that night was an anomaly and not the norm. I usually love Smith & Wollensky and will go back to this location in Las Vegas and have been to several other locations after this review. It's about time I corrected what's below. I also went from one star to 4 stars because of the locations terrific general manager.  

 I've been to at least 7 or 8 other Smith & Wollensky properties around the US. This meal, in a word, sucked. It wasn't so much that the food was so bad (it was not even good though), it was that the waiter lied. Flat out lied.

There were only 3 of us. Two ordered a filet and I ordered the aged rib steak. My steak was not an aged piece of meat. I know aged meat. It was fatty with a kind of fat that is not the texture seen in aged beef. It didn't have the rich beefy flavor that aged steak attains. It was also a bit overcooked...to about medium. Additionally, it shrank too much to be aged. When the food was delivered to the table, one of the filets was missing. The waiter said he put the order in. He didn't. We saw him put it into the computer. He had forgotten to put it in. I told him to take the two steaks back to the kitchen to re-fire and he said the one that was left in the kitchen would be out in a minute. It wasn't. It took 7 minutes. We timed it. By the time the third steak came out...neither of us wanted to eat without the other steak on the table...my $50 rib was cold and when our third guest finally cut into her filet, it was not medium rare...it was medium raw. Totally raw and cold in the middle. First, the waiter tried to say it was correct. It was blue, which is rarer than rare. He reluctantly took the steak back to the kitchen and it came back medium, not medium rare. We gave up. The manager sent over one of the massive desserts, which was nice but really didn't change the overall tenor of the meal.

The wine I ordered came with a different vintage. I really don't appreciate that. And it's beneath a restaurant wine list that's supposed to be the 'caliber' of S & W's wine list. Just because this S& W is on the Las Vegas strip doesn't mean the service, the wine list and the management suck. But they do. S&W here probably thinks that everyone is a tourist and will never darken their door again. Well, for sure i won't darken their door and I'm in Las Vegas at least 3 times a year and used to eat at S&W almost every time along with recommending this restaurant. No more.

Bad table waiting, bad management, bad food all around.

It was prix fixe with the usual choices: Steak, Chicken and Fish.

They bring great warm bread to the table.

I decided on going with the Pan Seared Salmon dish with mushroom risotto in a tomato sauce. The salmon was cooked okay but the risotto was great.

They also serve the sides family style so we got the truffled mac and cheese along with the roasted asparagus.

And of course their steaks are just AMAZING! The Portherhouse for Two (which is on their dinner menu but also available for lunch if you ask nicely), is enough food for two guys or three girls. It also comes with yummy vegetables that were sauteed in the drippings from the steak. All of their steaks are dry aged which provides a beautiful meaty flavor and because they know how to sear the steaks well each bite is a beautiful little treasure of meaty goodness.

The Cajun Rib Eye was also really nicely done. The seasoning provides a gentle kick and and was nicely seared on the outside, providing you with that savory crust that good steaks have.

Last night, while in town, I hit it again, and it was perfect again.

Beware, the portions are huge, even the appetizers.  Everything is al la carte so it's easy to order way too much by ordering appetizers and sides.

As for appetizers, nothing beats the macaroni and cheese.  It tastes nothing like you'd expect, and like nothing you've ever tasted.  Do not miss it.

Their signature cut is the bone in rib eye and that's what I always order.  It is simply the best steak you'll ever have.

Another buddy, Adrian, showed up late after disappearing (no, not for a good reason) because he had just spent 24 straight hours on a poker roller coaster.

The valet attendant was prompt in taking my car in & directed us to the entrance. As my Father & I walked in, we were greeted instantly by two friendly hostesses & sat us right away to a nice booth as requested.

Now here is where things went downhill. Our server, an older Caucasian male seem to be taking care of the back section of the room, came over & handed us our menus. We ordered a Acqua Panna bottle & when he came back with it.. I asked him about the baked potato side dish if it was served for one or two guests.. he told me that's only for one person. I told him we're here for Restaurant Week & we're ready to order. At that exact moment of saying those words, we became nonexistence to him. Service went from 100 to zero in a split second. He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about & then said.. Oh the Restaurant Week menu.. I'll go get that.. I guess you won't be needing these & took the regular menus with him. When he came back with the RW menus, he took off when I was half way letting him know we were ready to order. WOW really?! He passed by not once, but eight times without even acknowledging us. I finally waved my hand as he was passing by & said we're ready to order & he puts his index finger in the air, noting to me to wait. We watched this rude server walk back & forth taking his time to other tables, probably not participating in RW, giving them the kind of service we never received. My blood began to boil, because this wasn't an ordinary outing. My only day off & I took my Father here to celebrate a belated Father's Day. I would think I chose a great place to make him feel special in this nice steakhouse that's been here forever, but I was completely wrong. WE felt like nobodys after I said we're here for Restaurant Week. If you're a participant for this wonderful program of giving back to our community that needs it more than anything, why are you not wanting to share it with your guests or even supporting a great cause?! In return, we were treated like a peasant for wanting to give back & share a good meal together. At that very moment, I had enough. As soon as I saw the next staff member, I told him I want to talk to your manager right now. The rude server that was in the next room probably heard me, since he came over after I said that & acted all nonchalant with.. so you ready to order? My look at his face.. I wish someone was there to take a picture. I told him.. Actually no, I'm going to talk to your manager first. And look who's behind him.. the manager. I explained to the manager what happened and told him straightforwardly.. I want a different server immediately. As soon as those words came out of my mouth, the manager unhesitatingly took care of this matter and like a shot.. here came Jinho. There's the one star comeback. His service was 100x better. Like night and day compared to the rude server we had. So welcoming & attentive.. he read our minds with what we wanted to ask for without even having to ask! Now that's the kind of service every restaurant should provide, especially being a well known steakhouse here in Las Vegas. When he asked if we would like any side dishes, I mentioned the baked potato and on the double he goes.. that's a good choice.. it's a big portion that both of you can share. Rude, greedy server of ""no that's only for one person"" to this server letting me know we can share it. It was more of a self serve kind of place, poured my Father some more water as well as myself. Or maybe that's just for RW guests.

Appetizer of Tomato Carpaccio with Burrata was decent. Nothing spectacular. Food runner dropped off a few Ribeyes and sides that were for the table in front of us. I told the runner, this isn't our order. He looked at it, then looked at the table in front of us and flat-out took everything back to the cariton. The table in front of us saw what happened and we, both shared a laugh. Then a few seconds later our food came out and the runner goes.. let's try this again, it's like a deja vu. My filet mignon on one side was completely burnt to a black crisp. I had to cut it off and discard it. The baked potato was simply what it was, but good toppings of butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese. NY Cheesecake was light and soft. The star of the night.. Chocolate Cake was DELICIOUS! We took it home. My Mother ate a few bites and said.. this is the best tasting cake I ever had. I have to agree.. I couldn't stop eating it!!!

One star for the valet that had my car parked and ready for me when I came out, another star for the prompt action of the manager in getting me another server, and our server, Jinho for making up for the lack of another.

I was excited to come here, my parents spoke highly of it and people really seemed to like the Mac and Cheese here. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with the food I got. 
First off, skip the world famous split pea soup.. there is nothing great about it. I got the filet minon with the Gorgonzola cheese on top. It sounded good, however I found it was over powering and I ended up scraping it off. I should of just gone with it grilled normally. The Mac and Cheese was o.k.... still many levels below the Mac and Cheese you get at Del Friscos.
My wife got the Bone in rib eye which I enjoyed much more than my filet, however we both agreed it was  a bit over charred and seasoned with a heavy hand. 
The lone good thing was that they had a lighter portion menu of pretty much everything on the normal menu. Its a nice option.

I have to say the S&W's steaks are far superior than Flemings. I ordered the Dry Aged Prime Rib-Eye at both places and I could instantly tell the S&W Rib-Eye was much better. It was more tender and perfectly cooked. The 28 day dry aging added the perfect flavor. The side dishes are also much larger portions at S&W. It's enough for two people to share compared to Flemings. And the Truffled Mac & Cheese is to die for. If you have the option of choosing, its hands down Smith & Wollenskys. Trust me!",qZtd5SDe6xoQQ8DEhHANvw,0,0,5,ewxCOJeuarz5fHp_suZJGA

This place was a nightmare to get into, not one person crossing the driveway would let me through, so when I finally got through I was happy they had valet. This was my first time eating here, so I had no expectations, only thing I knew about this place was the Beef Wellington they're known for. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was the wainscoting had old food particles all over it. Disgusting. It appeared no one has wiped down the area in years. I had to scoot away because I didn't want someone else's food from last year on my arm. 

For dinner, I started out with the Wollensky Salad, this was soaked in salad dressing, there was a pile of it at the bottom of the dish, I love a good salad and this was nothing special. I tried the Deconstructed Beef Wellington, I ordered it medium well and it came out tartare, it was bright red in the middle, all the way through. I have a huge fear of returning food, so I tried my best to eat this but just could not get it down. It was smothered in foie gras & mushrooms. So overwhelming. Ended it with the coconut cake, I took 2 bites and was done. It tasted old like it had been made days before. This was by far the most disappointing Restaurant Week meal I had.

Whenever I come here, I always get the rib eye, as that is typically my favorite cut. I have tried some of the other cuts but my go to meat it the rib eye. I like it medium rare, and at Smith & Wollensky, it always comes out perfectly cooked. 

One time I came here, there was a red piece of plastic in my meat. I told the server about it, and he took the plate away immediately. Brought me another plate, took the price off the bill and even gave my dessert on the house. Talk about amazing service and hospitality. This is what I would expect from any great steakhouse. I was very impressed with the service I received here on that day. 

The sides, here are very good. A lot comes out so it's good to share with your group. 

The bread here is money. Try not eating to much of it or it'll really be hard eating all your steak. Even if you don't eat the bread, it's hard to eat the whole steak. It's a good size here. 

The location is awesome. I usually walk here from MGM or where ever I'm staying at. Definitely my go to steakhouse in the area.",ry3y7Rtk1sFc9ak6iVb4Fg,2,0,5,QjlTZTmmlejrYQvNLHhvRg

I went all out and got the bone marrow and harissa tomahawk rib eye. The steak itself was cooked well, but the marrow topping, and harissa didn't do much for it. I would have been just as happy without it.

Reluctantly they agreed to prepare another one for me and 5 mins later, give me a fresh (and I mean fresh) piece of certifiable rare.

I ended up having them cook it for me a bit more and at that point, all the excitement I have in enjoying the piece of steak is gone.

To be honest, I cannot give a complete fair assessment of Smith and Wollensky because I was not hungry when we went to dinner--ate @ Bellagio Buffet 5 hrs earlier.  However, I will make an attempt ...

Whole Free-Range Lemon Pepper Chicken ($22.50)- I personally think the chicken at Ralphs is better with a better price tag ($7)--free-range THIS!!  I ate the 1 leg, 1 thigh, and a small portion of the left breast ... and I was done.  The legs and thigh were pretty moist and tender, however, the breast was a little dry.  When I am at my prime, I would devour this whole chicken without a second thought.  I took this back to the hotel and nobody ate it as well.  I'm crying inside that food went to waste.

Other courses:

Tomato and Bufala Mozzarella salad ($12.50) - Tomatoes were good, but the mozzarella didn't stand out ... no punch of delicious taste.  

Bone-In Rib Eye ($46.50) - This piece of meat was pretty damn big--fit pretty much the whole plate.  My friend gave me a slice and it was pretty damn tasty--perfect pink inside.

Crab Macaroni & cheese ($11.50) - All I can say is ... can you see my O-face?!!  This is a must get if you come here.  HELLO ... it's mac and cheese with crab!!!!

Lobster - the lobster was pretty spectacular in presentation.  The size of the claws was insane--juiced up lobsters.  I thought it would be tight to use the claw as a shot glass so the bachelor did as that--see pictures.  I told everyone that I'm saving the claw for the next bachelor--I'm a gangsta trendsetter.

Way too much sinew around the bone - I like my steak to be mouth melty, vs. getting that bubble gum crackle of gristle between the teeth.  I do wish I had more of an opportunity to give feedback at the table especially after leaving a third of the cut on my plate, but admittedly my party members were too busy enthusing to the waiter so it would have been hard to sneak that in. Since we hosted the dinner, I'm very happy that the rest of my party had a great S&W experience and I will chalk up my decision as the wrong one for me, can't win them all, can't ever go home again kind of happenstance.

Good Times!

The Setting:
This place is FUN!  It's a nice steakhouse that is NOT pretentious. 
It's good, honest food and service.... it's not fancy... Upscale Casual Steakhouse is how I describe it to friends. .... you don't need to get dressed up to go here.... but don't show up all tattered or slutty either.

Remember.. You're in Vegas... so expect it to be pricey.  Great place for a Power Lunch or Group Dining.

There's a 'Kitchen Table' that you can reserve if you have like 8-10 people.

They start you off with their Pretzel bread wtih mustard butter... be careful not to fill up on this.  It's easy to do because it is so freakin' good.

Anyways....Steak is definitely their specialty.....

I thoroughly enjoyed the Tenderloin and Spinach salad... good and filling... Steak was perfect... Medium just the way I ordered it... and tender  The spinach was fresh and it came with chopped eggs, blue cheese and bacon.  So Good!  

But if you don't want Steak....

The Calamari appetizer... The Best Calamari app I've had in a long time.... The calamari is Tender and Meaty and enough to share for 5 women.... Not Rubber-eeeee like other places.  And the dipping sauce... oh man.... it's like an aioli spice.... hard to describe but I ended up dipping everything in it ... it was so good.

The Lobster BLTA... wow!  Rich and filling and it is served with homemade chips which are crispy but not oily or greasy... Perfect.

Their Scallops are melt in your mouth ... OMG!

The Ahi Tuna salad looked really good and the gal in our party who got it said it was one of the best she's ever had.

And then there's Dessert.... definitely save room for dessert.... we had the chocolate cake with fresh homemade whip cream.  YEA BABY!  Rich... Decadent... and You don't need more than a couple bites to satisfy your sweet tooth or your chocolate tooth.

Smith & Wollensky.  This steakhouse epitomizes an old-school, clubby atmosphere where one discusses the latest issue of the New Yorker.  Their Las Vegas outpost is an amazing respite from the invasion of over priced, modern fancy steak joints that have become omnipresent on the strip.  

Where to start on what makes Smith & Wollensky great?  Ive already touched on the amazing vibe they've created, but the food is just as good.  The meat is Prime and cooked expertly.  I love that they dont drown their cuts in butter like some other top-end places and they make the meat the real star.  Ive had the Bone-In Ribyeye twice now and I can say its nothing short of breathtaking.  My associate swears by the Filet Oscar style (how great is it that they still do an Oscar style?  Old school, I told you) and judging by the bites I had I concur.  The sides are bold yet traditional and complimentary with the rest of the menu.  If you're only ordering one, it MUST be the truffle mac & cheese.  Thumbs up also to the creamed spinach, hash browns & lobster mashed potatoes.  As for starters, I always get their crisp iceberg wedge salad which is the best of any restaurant not named Gibson's in Chicago.  Ive never had the deserts there because with all the other food, who can?  Judging from the rest of the dining room, it looks like that is a popular sentiment.  

The service is attentive yet unobtrusive.  Our waiter Michael knows the menu inside out and was helpful with the wine menu as well.  What a treat to have a waiter who treats the food as a passion instead of job.  Im sure they other staff our amazing too, but if you can Michael will make your dinner very special in that you wont even realize he made it special.  See how that works?

With all these nice touches comes a hefty price tag, but S & W delivers.  Expect that each person will be about $100 bucks with some alcohol.

My second memorable meal was two weeks ago. I went with business associates so we were a little more liberal in our ordering. I had an Old Fashioned to start that was perfect. Then we ordered the seafood appetizer - remarkable. It had huge tasty shrimp, ridiculously large lump crabmeat, and lobster. Wonderful. Then the spinach salad which was unique, and incredibly tasteful, finished off with a filet and a couple of sides.

We started with a salad wedge, tuna tartar, and carpitchio. Every bite was fantastic. They could sell the bacon in their salad as a stand alone appetizer. 
I had the Filet Mignon. One of the best steaks I have ever had. Tender, juicy, and very flavorful. The aging gives it a nice deep finish. 
The wife had the bone in rib eye and my sample of it was also amazing. 
Our guests had various cuts which they all seemed to enjoy. 
We ordered corn, mushrooms, onion, and whipped potatoes as sides. All were great tasting. 

The service is top notch with the team of Gino and Juice. Eddie, who was not our server, came in and gave my little one a tour of the kitchen. He then drew a picture of her on the glass. She loved the special attention.

If you are going to do this place right, then you need to start with the seafood bouquet. Lobster, Oysters, Shrimp, Mussels, Clams, and Colossal Lump Crabmeat. I've died and gone to Atlantis! If you even think about stopping there, you are gambling your taste buds away. Suck it up and chow down on a Wollensky salad. If Lady Luck blesses you, you'll still have room for the bone-in rib-eye. I spent many mornings gnawing on my leftovers in the hotel room. Sides I would go with include the creamed spinach.

The portions were absolutely GINORMOUS, so don't worry about there not being enough food if you decide to do something similar.

If you do do a private dining experience like I did, ask them if you can play your own music. Listening to Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber isn't my ideal situation for a reception, but I forgot to ask about music options in advance.

I've been to so many steakhouses and a lot of them just don't get it right even when they charge you an arm and a leg. Well, Smith and Wollensky has it right. From the friendly hostesses at the front door, the assistant helping clean the table, the super friendly waitstaff to the delicious steak. I mean wow! I'm impressed. 

First we started with a wedge salad. We didn't want to eat too much and ruin our appetite so me and my hubby split it. They were kind enough to split it for us. Perfect portions, super fresh greens and yummy blue cheese dressing. Next came the filet Oscar steak and truffle mac and cheese. I requested medium rare and it was just that. Perfect flavor, juicy, covered with delicious lump crab meat and asparagus. Yum! The Truffle Mac and cheese was to die for. Melt in your mouth cheesy wonderfulness. I also tried my hubby's filet au poivre and the sauce was simply sinful. Nothing short of perfect. 

To top it all off the staff was super friendly. We were Christmas Day diners and they gave us each a $25 bonus card for dining with them on the holiday. The card can be used between January thru end of February. What a pleasant surprise and gift. Our waiter was also just phenomenal. Big shout out to John from Jersey. Attentive, helpful, knowledgeable and kind.

This location should not share the same name as the midwest counterpart.

Two years I had one of the best meals of my life at S&W Chicago.  I tried a little of everything our group ordered.  The mac & cheese was amazing, great steak and a seared tuna that was out of this world.

Well--fast forward a year.  I'm in Vegas with the same group working on a project.  We see S&W.  

Lightning DOESN'T strike twice I am afraid.  The atmosphere in here sucked.  The mac & cheese was like microwaved crap.  The tuna was cold in the center!  I mean--this meal was not OK--it was horrible.  We talked to the manager and they were NOT helpful--offering to ""recook"" our bad food.  We paid in disgust even though I thought we should have walked out in protest..........

Never going back S&W.............

AVOID.

If you want to spend a lot of money in Vegas and you are considering tossing it out here--turn away NOW,  put it all in a slot machine and eat at MCDonald's--trust me--you'll  be happier...",WIhrdYTVpkVmkW3Ltr-fVA,3,4,1,9-ZrxwrhSyW9bhQ3Tl9H7Q

The service was amazing, our waiter was quite attentive and the servers w/ the hors d'uvres were friendly. The hors d'uvres were awesome, bite sized but not invisible specks of food. We had mini cheese burgers, chickeny pizza, tomato basil pizza, and shrimp. The chicken pizza was teh best, it was a mix of flavors-chicken, parmesan, garlic with a light crisp dough. It makes me salivate just thinking about it. 
The girls were served filet mignon & chicken medallions. The chicken was not dry, stuffed with sun dried tomatoes. The filet mignon (I am told) was medium rare, juicy, and tender. I had a plate of roasted veggies. They also served their bread rolls, which come covered in garlic butter in a pan. Yum! Alongside the entrees were small pots of sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were heavenly, slathered in a stick of butter, they were light and fluffy. The sauteed mushrooms were YUMYUMYUM, so tasty!
Overall, we had an amazing time and this place is such a great place for a party!

I was with a large group of co wokers 11 total.  Smith allocated one full time waiter and one that helped plus a bus boy.  

The first clue of what I was in for is when the seafood appitizers came out.  Two huge platters of shrimp, lobster, oysters, crab.  The food was fantastic and was perfection personified.  At this point I knew I would not be able to eat my salad.  I asked the waiter if it was possible to cancel the salad.  He did with no problems.  Mrs K. ordered and kept her salad.  She had a wedge salad.  It was typical ingredients of a wedge blue cheese bacon and other stuff.  What makes this notable was the bacon.  True huge chunks of bacon a size I have never seen before.  While Mrs. K was gone from the table I tasted the bacon.  wow!  

For the meal I ordered no sides but others around me did.  All sides are enough for 2 people easy.  What caught my eye was the Truffe Mac and Cheese.  Looked great but alas no taste for me. My steak was something I normally do not get which is a fillet.  It just seemed to be the right size for the meal we were having and it had a topping of gargonzola cheese.  Each bite was just a slice of heaven.  Cooked per my request and served while still hot.  Good Job!!

While I did not have any dessert I did see their version of a slice of chocolate cake.  Slice is not a proper term.  It was more like 1/4 of a cake.  All people who had the desert loved it.  funny how everyone says they are so full and cannot eat another bite but all the dessert was gone.",BnBQ0UU9uSiI_0cbCZ4lsw,4,3,5,EBBXVUMxsXDh-ONlpT6-1g

3701188,2008-08-03,4,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I don't think so.

I came here with a friend who wanted a steak dinner and, since Blackstone's at the Monte Carlo was by then defunct, this was the most convenient option. We had to catch up with the rest of our group later that evening, and this was right across the street.

So...I got a nice big filet, ""simply grilled, au poivre."" The sauce was pretty good. I had higher expectations for the beef. I mean, HOW COULD A RESTAURANT OF THEIR SUPPOSED REPUTE RUIN A 28-DAY DRY-AGED TENDERLOIN STEAK? Easy. By not cooking it right. ""Medium"" does not mean ""charred extra well."" It means cooked through, but with a juicy pinkness starting, oh, about a third of the depth into the cut of the meat. Did they electrocute it on the MGM's marquee? Just not good at all.

I got a side order of asparagus. It was overdone too. Maybe the chef was also our waiter, because (ok, the guy seemed to be an amiable dude) he seemed to be held hostage by an obnoxious party of bogans sitting next to us who were trying to pick up on some Dutch chicks sitting in our proximity. You do not pick up on Dutch chicks by speaking bad German because that isn't their language. Germans might think it's OK, but that's another story, for another place and another time...

So, all the while this was happening, our food was getting BURNT!

The steak that my buddy got was equally horrendous, by his report. So it wasn't just me.

Now that we'd filled our bellies with some atrociously mutilated animal flesh, it was time to get the check.

Time...ticking away...Helllooooo Maytag repairman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And those goons next to us were still trying to hit on those Dutch chicks using bad German pick-up lines, holding our waiter hostage (maybe they were really just trying to impress him?).

All I could think was, ""Jullie hebben de dommekloote rukkeren, shut the F--- up and let me get the waiter's attention so I could get my check."" I may even have said that out loud while flailing about trying to get said waiter's attention.

I took matters into my own hands, went inside, and asked the host to get me the check. No problem.

Time...flies...when...you're...having...fun...

At this point, we were tempted just to leave without paying. And just as we were about to do so, the check came, oh, about 38 minutes after it was first solicited.

Not good. In fact, that made some bad food taste even worse. The price was on par with what one would expect to pay at a restaurant of the caliber one would get the impression of this being, not having actually dined there. Expensive doesn't necessarily mean high-class.

Oh, yeah, and I guess they thought those pretzel bites with honey mustard in lieu of some good crusty French bread were cute. No. I'm at a steakhouse. Not 7-11.",p2YMr7hHcOlJBqBVybqbow,4,3,1,VAjNsQnrzZ9o_Mzl2sca0g

Unfortunately the experience we all had was not the same.  Although our waiter was very friendly, he repeatedly made mistakes on our orders.  One of our guests never did get her food.  Every time there was a mistake the waiter blamed the bus boy. (Not sure how a bus boy could be at fault for the server writing the order down wrong.)

The menu is limited, we had kids with us that took one look at the menu and found nothing that peaked their interest but plain mac n cheese.  Which ended up being disgusting.  3 people ended up not eating their order because it tasted so bad.

When the meals that were correct (maybe 6 out of 19) finally were served, the food was seriously bland.. We were all commenting that the steaks at Black Angus tasted better.  Definitely not worth the over inflated cost.

All of these locations are pretty much mirror images of each other as far as building appearance, and similar in size.  I guess that's how a chain or mini-chain, in this case, operates.

This place was similar in food as well although I think I've had better food before elsewhere.  I had the prime rib which to me was not worth the price.  The cut was fattier than most, and wasn't bone-in which I've seen and had at the other locations. 

I was here Memorial day weekend at lunch as a walk-in.  They asked if I had a reservation even though the restaurant was fairly empty looking to me.  Service was good, the food was good.  They recommended the house mac and cheese which I thought was excellent.  Baked potatoes were huge and served with all the fixings you could want on the side, so you can build it the way you want it.  I gave their own Smith & W wine brand a try and thought it was very tasty.  My buddy got the cajun rib-eye which he found excellent and even said he liked the steak here better than Ruth Chris's.

To me, I've had better deals.  This place is good and I would go back, but the main reason we came here was because most of the Vegas steakhouses don't open until 5pm, and when you want steak you want it NOW.

3946257,2010-06-04,3,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Q:  Why come here?  
A:  For the creamed spinach.

No, seriously, I have yet to find anywhere that makes better creamed spinach than S&W.  And believe you me, I have tried.  For some reason S&W has the perfect balance of creamy richness and gooey cheesy texture, yet is feels light enough to eat the entire serving - or at least get sick trying.  Most places it's too runny or too thick, too rich or not tasty enough.  S&W just gets it right, every single time.

I have been coming here for years and I recommend this place to anyone wanting a great steak (yes, they do serve steak with the creamed spinach on occasion).  I honestly never order anything besides the bone-in rib eye.  Why?  Because it's that damn good people.  In all my experiences, I have never had a bad steak.  Never.  It always comes out a perfect medium rare with a nice tasty char on the outside.

On my most recent visit, I noticed the changed the bread basket and no longer had the mustard butter.  I was pretty saddened and almost had to walk out of there.  Yeah, right, who am I kidding?  Seriously, though, the new stuff just isn't as good as before, but it is still ok.  

For appetizers, I recommend you don't eat any.  The first time I did, many years ago, I paid the price and couldn't finish my steak.  In case you were wondering, I had ordered the caprese, which was, in and of itself, pretty darn big.  Now when I go, I just skip the apps and head straight for the beef and sides.

For sides, my staples are: creamed spinach (duh!), sauteed mushrooms and mac & cheese.  Honestly, all the sides are pretty standard fare, but to me, the creamed spinach is outstanding.

Worth mentioning is that S&W does not charge a corkage for bottles of wine you bring in, as long as it's not on the list and your group is 4 or less.  No corkage!  If you live in Vegas, like I do, that is like money in your pocket.  Most places charge $35, so if you bring two bottles (the limit here), you just saved $70 on corkage!  That's a meal here!  Go ahead and order an extra desert (if you're not totally stuffed).

Um, speaking of deserts, I can't really say much.  I have never had a single desert here through my numerous visits.  I'm always stuffed to gills from eating the fantastic meat.

If you want A5 Kobe or some jazzed-up, marinated or sauced beef, this is the wrong place.  You come here for a damn fine slab of prime, dry-aged American cow cooked to absolute perfection.

If you want a quiet, romantic or posh eatery, where you can people watch this ain't it.  The decor is stark and simple, the service spot on and the repeat clientele come for the beef, not the meat.  Well, I come for the spinach, but hey, we all have our own quirks, right?",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,3,2,4,pqCZqAHyKdJeu1v3l2StQg

3968310,2012-04-02,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"My wife brought me here for my 40th birthday dinner, and... it was really, really, good.  I've been to a fair amount of steakhouses, and Smith & Wollensky is about as good as it gets.  I'd been here once before, but it was quite as excellent the second time.

Our server, Mark, was exactly as attentive as he should have been - which is a lot harder than it sounds.  It means he was there when we needed something, but he also wasn't hovering over us while we were eating, asking ""is everything okay?""

I also have to give him credit for suggesting the truffled mac and cheese, which is incredible and almost certainly a lot better than the whipped potatoes I'd been planning to order as a side.  I can see why, as Mark noted, people come back just for this dish.  I could certainly see just sitting at the bar with a dish of that mac and cheese and a martini and then going home happy and fulfilled.

But of course where the rubber meets the road with steakhouses is whether the steak is good or not.  And the answer at Smith & Wollensky is:  Heck yeah.  If you don't like them grilled at blazing heat to produce a dark sear on the outside, you won't like it, but if you do, if you like that char, then you definitely will like this place.  The meat itself is obviously high quality, at least as high as you would get at any other high-end steakhouse.",pRpn51cjyZYwmtBwJriFnA,2,1,5,fUbW0FOiuIKLXoWZrraoaw

Overall, our food was not worth the price tag. We asked our waiter for recommendations on wine, appetizers/salads, steaks, etc. His knowledge of the menu didn't seem to be what I was expecting and it seemed like he didn't know what the popular items at the restaurant were. 

Our salads were nothing over the top that we couldn't do ourselves. Honestly, every steakhouse I've had a salad or soup at is always one of a kind. Take it from someone who ate her fair share of steaks in the South! All of our steaks were overcooked from the temperature we asked for. Our wine was more dry and not as sweet as we had expected. I felt that our dessert might have been the only good part to our meal, which wasn't recommended by him, but we read through popular reviews. 

It was very disappointing to have the level of service that we did and I had hoped it would have been more accommodating to someone who was a vegetarian. I know what you're thinking, why would a vegetarian show up to a steakhouse. However, you'd be surprised how accommodating many are willing to be for someone who would like a little more than just a side dish. While I don't expect chefs to create a new meal, to make an added effort/detail to a side dish would have been nice. It also didn't help that our waiter seemed like he was rushing to close up our bill rather than having us enjoy a nice meal. 

Overall our experience, was a complete bust. We've experience better steakhouses in Vegas that have been much more accommodating and notable for their service and food. I definitely wouldn't recommend this steakhouse to people in the future.

I felt the reason they should get one more star is for extra effort in the complimentary glass of prosecco they served us for our anniversaries and taking picture of us from my iphone.",J9kJCqMx0JWvHthaM6i-lg,5,0,2,pb5llPmlNbSasFMajv-88w

They got their name by picking the two names out of a phone book . The chain was founded by the founders of TGI Fridays, and there in lies the problem.

In New York, if an establishment turns out a mediocre product, they are done. Not so in Las Vegas, where tourists are too excited to notice they are paying top dollar for sub par food and service,and this place is a good example. 

I've eaten here three times, and three strikes and you're out!

One time I hosted a business function with 20 people. Some were from New York, and were truly disappointed. Two other times were intimate social occasions, and both times I was disappointed.

On the last occasion, I ordered a rib eye. It was 95% fat. I told the waiter my steak had too much fat, he just said ""Yes"", and did nothing. 

When I complained to the manager, he offered to buy desert and drinks, but ""the damage was done"".

I was so disappointed as I am a steak fanatic who has embraced all sorts of steak ranging from the low-pro diner set-up to the high-end, formal-attire establishments in the most pretentious nooks and crannies of both coasts and beyond. Smith and Wollensky, however, failed miserably and has no place in my steak-consuming repertoire. I went to some sketchy hotel diner the next morning with the rest of my hungover constituents and my $13 steak and eggs dwarfed Smith and Wollensky in terms of edibility and taste. 

Service-wise, the staff was top-notch and being that we were a rough and tumble bachelor party, the host graciously placed us in the VIP room in which we were consistently and diligently pampered. I can't justify dropping fifty bucks on a shit steak, but the service evened it out.

The triple-baked mac and cheese was a little too salty and overpowering. Come to think of it, everything was too salty. I had three greyhounds and I didn't feel the urge to shred my carcass any harder than if I'd had a glass of warm milk. 

A bad steak makes for a very unhappy Stephie.

The steak is the main reason why we came here, and sadly, it was only 3 stars worthy.",6HYmy9AWEdp-rfTtCKZUVw,2,0,3,D6_imUP4pchaiJ_uHh5qvQ
4451479,2013-03-14,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"My first stop of Restaurant Week 2013 and my one out of two, unfortunately. *clown tear*

Well my friends and I had reservations for 6 PM, which must be right before S&W gets all their reservations typically because when I walked in expecting to see a bustling restaurant crickets were chirping instead. However, when we walked out around 8:15 PM, the place was packed. 

The interior is old-school steakhouse, dim lighting, etc. It's like 1910 elegance, you know, before the stock market crashed and people stood in line for a piece of bread. The plush, cushy chairs are perfect for sitting back and stuffing your face with indulgent food and delicious steaks.

Our server was cordial and had a light sense of humor. I have a feeling since we were a group of young ladies his demeanor was a tad different from what he would have presented had we been three businessmen. Of course, that's not a problem for the waitstaff to be versatile. 

Food - I ordered off the RW menu, a fixed price of $40 (and some change). I received the Wollensky Salad - a salad with crisp romaine lettuce, served with warm, large chunks of bacon and mushrooms. Also - tomatoes.. um, two tomatoes to be exact. Is there a problem with tomatoes lately? Seems as though they appear sparser and sparser in my salads at restaurants. The salad was good, and filling. 

Deconstructed Beef Wellington with Foie Gras. (Originally $42). This meal comes out very simplistic on a large white plate. Along with the meat you receive three slender carrots and three slender asparagus. The meat is cooked medium-rare, which I said yes to because I have never had beef wellington so I decided to go with the recommendation. The ""deconstruction"" part is the fact that the beef wellington is served differently than normal, but with all the elements still there. The meat is cut up, the foie gras is not wrapped around all of the meat, and the puff pastry is on the bottom of the meat, more like a platter than a wrapper, which is what is normal. Overall I enjoyed the dish, the meat was simply divine and I did not have a chewy bit. I did run into a few bits of overcooked foie gras, being that it was a bit crunchy. Typically I do not eat my meat medium rare and I found the fact that the meal came out much cooler than I'm used to a bit strange at first, but perhaps something I can stomach when eating a beef wellington in the future.

Chocolate cake - chocolate meh. I wasn't impressed. I've had much better cake elsewhere, but obviously desserts is not their forte. Skip dessert, go somewhere else after your meal. Or just have another cocktail instead.

Cocktails - I had two of the same, something called  French martini. Very girly and pink. Swirly, swirly! I liked it, no complaints.

Sides (not included on RW Menu) - We decided to get two sides to share between the three of us. We went for the truffled mac n cheese and the mushrooms. Mushrooms to me were all right. But since I had had mushrooms on my salad and I had mushrooms with the beef wellington I only had a spoonful of them. The mac and cheese though - heaven! Perfectly creamy, just enough of a breading on top for a crunch, and just straight up gooey goodness that is sooo bad for you, but it's soooo good. 

For the RW 2013 S&W gets a 4-star rating. Now, would I return to pay full price? Yes, I think I would. I also like that they have a lunch menu, something I would love to explore. Also, currently when you check-in with Yelp you can receive a deal, so that is always a plus for us Yelpers!

Good job S&W and thank you for a fabulous meal.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,4,JT7XXX8M4gR3bXjG1OBFjQ

I really wanted to eat a steak for my birthday and watch a early 7:00 pm show . The majority of the Steak houses in Vegas are open at 5:30 pm which wouldn't have worked for me but luckily Smith & Wollensky opens at 11am. 

My husband and I started off with drinks to enjoy before the meal. I ordered a Skinny Mint . It tastes like Chocolate Mint candy but it was a little strong for me. The waiter was nice enough to ask me if I liked my drink because it looked like it hasn't been touched. He was willing to get me another one but I just explained that I did like it it's just that I am a sipper. My husband helped me finish it towards the end of the meal because I couldn't do it by myself. I was already feeling warm and making up my own phrases...I was a little tipsy. The drinks were $14.95 so my husband made sure we finished most of it. 

I had the Rib Eye Steak with Truffled Mac and Cheese. I really wanted their Lobster Mashed Potatoes but they stopped serving it because it's a seasonal item. I wasn't sure how I'd feel eating Mac and Cheese with my steak but it was melt in your mouth delicious! The steak was nice and juicy which I love because there is nothing worse then a dry, tough steak. We also had the Wollensky salad that had a type of Dijon dressing, real bacon and potato croutons. That was also really good. 

We ended the meal with coffee, tea and my complimentary Birthday dessert . The presentation was cute and it consisted of a chocolate walnut brownie which is one of my favorites. Who am I kidding anything chocolate is my favorite!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,2,1,4,1O52IRiP2fMJ6maToi7Q3A

4544841,2014-03-13,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"So maybe I'm the last person in the world who has not been to Smith and Wollensky. I will admit part of me wanted to go because it was in the devil wears Prada. But seriously this is a great steakhouse. First of all it's restaurant week in Vegas my favorite two weeks in the year.  So for 40 bucks I got their split pea soup, a filet Oscar that's actually 10 bucks more and their famous coconut cake.  Let's start with the split pea soup. First of all I hate peas. So you would think that's an odd choice for a starter. But they're famous for it and I had to try it. Our waiter said it tasted more like pork to him then peas and he was right. They bring it in a silver container and they pour it into a bowl while at the same time pour fresh croutons on top of the soup.  It was great. Then the filet Oscar obviously comes with crab on top with hollandaise sauce and asparagus it was fantastic.  We ordered some sides and they were the truffle mac & cheese and the onion rings. When they say sides for two they mean sides for 2 to 4. Seriously these sides were humongous really nothing like the modern-day steakhouses which don't tend to give you as much.  This is like old school when it says since 1977 I'm willing to bet not a lot has changed but this is actually a good thing. The dishes are Kinda retro the portions are kinda retro and the food is kind of retro but it's all really comforting and good.   I was also additionally lucky that for four days they were doing a wine flight for 20 bucks that benefited the Cleveland clinic. Three fantastic wines for 20 bucks a French Rose a California Pinot Noir and a California cab.  Really one of the best deals in town but otherwise their wine list is pricey.   The coconut cake really is the star.  First the waiter tells us that it was on the best thing I ever ate on food network. It is really that good. Creamy and delicious.

It was tough and lacking flavor. Something you would expect from an Outback; but at 3 times the cost. We were hungry and in a rush and thus we ate it. The bartender (yes, we were seated at the bar for convenience) was great and attentive. To his credit he did ask us how the meal was. I expect he would have had taken it back and off the bill had we asked. It's just hard to understand how an aged piece of meat costing nearly $70 could be so categorically bad. It was in fact cooked to a perfect medium rare with a good Pittsburg char. It means the steak itself was of very poor quality.

Steak tartare was good. Carpaccio was good. Clams were acceptable. Basically it's a good restaurant, unless you're looking for good steak. There far better options within walking distance in this town.",gtVx0wYZ0z0iozzst7Gm5A,0,0,2,Yt7Mag7oozr5jrbek0l3RA

S&W's steaks are brilliant. The aging process they use imparts a medium earthiness and creates a bite through the meat that is perfect. Not tough but actually requires you to chew lightly to savor the flavor. I recommend the bleu cheese encrusted filet and the porterhouse.

The bar is VERY EXTENSIVE to which I was extremely grateful. I am an avid absinteur and enjoyed that they had four different types of absinthe/pastis NOT SERVED ELSEWHERE in Las Vegas. I recommend ordering a Ricard with a rocks glass of ice water.

Also the sides are awesome, the truffled mac and cheese is great but I preferred it without the truffle oil,  baked potatoes are huge, and the sauteed mushrooms were served in a butter wine reduction that was superb.

Lastly, we had 3 different desserts: creme brulee, fresh fruit marinated in liqueur, and a chocolate souffle. All were excellent.

The service and hours are wonderful. Open til 1-2am and the servers pointed us in the right direction when it came to food. The prices were sizable (4 people, $355+$80 tip) but VEEEEERY worth it.

Seafood

Whole Maine Lobster - Super fresh and insanely huge...

Steaks

Cajun Ribeye - Full flavor and massive with just a hint to cajun kick, and my top pick.
Filet Rosini - Foie Gra is nice and rich and complements well
Filet Oscar - Crab has a nice flavor with the sauce
Coffee & Cocoa Rubbed Filet - Also incredibly good with a hit of spice

Sides

Truffle Mac - Flavor is fantastic, mac can sometimes be a bit softer than al dente which could be better.
Shellfish Bouquet - Just order it, and go straight to the crab meat.  Side sauces are fantastic and all the pieces are fresh
Wild Mushroom- a must have for any steak dinner
Duck Fat Roasted Vegetable - Pretty good, but the flavor didn't shine too particularly for me.
Creamed Spinach - A solid classic

****Dessert****
The Chocolate Cake here is outrageous, the best I've ever eaten.  Closest thing I've found was in Dallas.  Not too sweet, nice and dense and full of flavor with a side of fresh cream..  This is a must.

Yes it's a high end steak house. Been eating at the ones in Los Angeles, NYC and Chicago since I'm like 17. My father loved the NYC location most. 

Great wine selection to sit at the bar and pick at the sides.

I have to admit it has been hit and miss on the restaurant side, but my last two visits to the B and G side were spot on. 
This place is perfect for a casual business dinner or for a couple guys hanging out for a meal. 
I had the wedge, scallops and truffle mac and cheese and of course the creamed spinach. As you can see not too adventurous. The scallops did have a little steakhouse flair, which was good. 
Just love the place, location, ambiance, service, wine selection and the food.

First we are in the bar 8 of us having a drink and their is some sort of odor through the restaurant we are told it's raw sewage from a pipe.. since they are closing in a few weeks... they aren't fixing it. We should have left then... They sit us in a room that has a glass wall where you can see directly into the kitchen and Fredo is our server. 

Wine list provided and we have to go through 8 different wine choices as they don't have anything we want.. Its a joke completely unacceptable.. we finally get a couple bottles  and some drinks while no bread is provided for 30 minutes from time we sit down till time its provided not to mention our appetizers and salads arrived before the bottle of wine is even poured. 

Keep it simple.. 
Salads good, shrimp cocktail good Alaskan Crab legs good... 

8 Steaks ALL garbage I won't even bother explaining each as it's not worth the effort... 65.00 each or up per entree really A JOKE.  Not to mention they didn't have several cuts Porterhouse NO etc...   

Sides Mushrooms tasteless.
Hash Browns burnt on top potatoes underneath RAW
French Fries OK
Sautéed Spinach Terrible. 
Onion Rings Great..

Manager kind enough to take off a few appetizers and Salads but bottom line 1400.00  for 8 People for the worst meal I've ever had in Las Vegas.. Smith & Wo's ownership / Management Should embarrassed CLOSE NOW DON'T WAIT!...",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,7,1,1,A10i09FihC18qWltWaqbQw
4778551,2016-08-09,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Haven't been here since it first opened.  Not much as changed.  I still remember the oversize white butcher coats that make those poor waiters wear in the desert.  Lots of good steak places to try in Vegas...this is surely one of them.  Exceptional service from every staff member we encountered in this restaurant.  They made you feel welcome and well taken care of.

Started with the Wedge salad.  Have to say, one of the best wedge salads I have ever had anywhere.  Just enough to make you want more.  The blue cheese dressing is made in-house and the lardons (think big bacon chunks) are spectacular.
They are known for BONE IN steaks, so I usually get a filet, but bone in it was.  I did the Cajun Rib Eye 24 oz.  I do not need to eat again until Labor Day, but it was soooo good.  Cooked just right.  When you want to eat the fat, you know it's cooked right.  The Cajun spice was marinated into the meet for 24 hours, so really flavorful and if you like spice, this one's for you.  My partner had the Au Povoir style, in red wine reduction and LOTS OF PEPPER.  He didn't care for the way his medium steak came out, and didn't say anything until we left.  You pay a lot for these steaks, and they did ask several times how the steak was.  If mine was overcooked, I would have let them know.  He did not...so, guess I have to take off a star for his meal.  We shared the corn side dish - very fresh, they shave that corn right off the cob in a funky sauce that is a little spicy, but with my meal, it was a nice compliment.  Also shared a loaded baked potato and I couldn't eat all of that as the steak took precedence for me.

Had a nice Russian River Pinot with dinner that was recommended and an excellent choice if you are a fan of this type of wine.

Would consider it again, after I make my way through all the other steakhouse in town.  An old favorite that if you have a special night out, I think you'll like it.",IDcYXJpo3B62HS40bEXCpw,2,1,4,swqZvsYY-TxOdqA2xXamoQ

4795324,2010-08-16,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Ate here Saturday, August 14, 2010 for my brothers bachelor party.  I made the reservation about 2 1/2 months before arriving.  

I hate opening up with a complaint, but it sticks out the most.  Maybe others give it high stars but not every customer is satisfied the same.

We checked in and were seated at a round table for six in a corner near the front door/bar. I asked for the vacant longer table for six; round tables are hard to do with 3 BIG guys. I was told it was already reserved; when I called a week before I was told you couldn't reserve a specific table...odd. I asked for something else but were told that's all that was avaialble; this was at 7:30pm; reasturants in Las Vegas usually don't get crazy until 830/930pm, as they did in this case. There was no luck, even after kindly asking several times and expressing that we were there first (by at least 25/30mins). No dice, and the host wasn't even considerate, borderline rude about it. This is a large place, it's bullsh*t that he couldn't help us out.  Again, there were 3 big guys at the table in a corner with a lot of food on the table...not fun.  We tried to make the best of it.

Besides the the two parties of about 10 or more, the ambiance was bright and loud.  Maybe that's typical of seating next to the kitchen, front door and bar.

Our server was friendly, and very helpful. We had a lot of questions and he was a pro.  Steaks were tasty; I had the Oscar style filet which had crap meat on it in a very rich and heavy sauce.  Sides for two come in small pots right off the grill; mashed potatos were watery and had no flavor...I mentioned this but was told simply ""sorry about that."" Creamed spinish and mushrooms are great, very happy with those; I'm not all complaints and complimented that and the steak. 

It's not really business casual when people are wearing t-shirts and shorts.  We had on nice jeans and collars shirts...and weren't nearly as loud and obnoxious as the idiots next to us.  Hard to really enjoy the dinner with them; I didn't expect anyone to say anything to them either. Prices are somewhat typical...$49 for a small fillet (looks like little food but its filling especially with a salad and sides).

This S & W is a bit of a novelty (maybe because it's in Las Vegas).  I've been to many steak houses around the country and this one seems to be the least exciting.  I prefer dim light and class compared to this bright, fast passed mess hall sounding place.  Next time I'll try somewhere else and not recommend this.",VTbFgB_ME4lNQeFQEH7jcg,0,0,2,lJNStTVSsUPZ4I-DFqZk7g

DURING WINE WEEK.

NOTE: THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN UPDATED WITH THE LAST 3 DAYS OF DINING.

The DOs and DON'Ts of lunches @ Smith & Wollensky.

DO's
- Lobster bisque. Lovely sherry flavor, lots of bits of lobster, very nice.
- Mussels. Wonderful.
- Wedge salad. Classic.
- Wollensky salad. This was a surprise. Quite good, altho lettuce could be a better choice. The bacon lardons and potato ""croutons"" were nice.
- Foie gras burger.
- Lobster BLT, altho not the best priced item to order ($25).
- Steak sandwich. Split this and the Lobster BLT with spouse, we both thought this sandwich was a better deal than the Lobster.
- Swordfish in cracked pepper crust w/ veal jus. This was interesting. The fish is a little overwhelmed by the massive amounts of pepper used in this dish, however, unbelievably a bit of this with the Chardonnay they served that day during Wine Week (one of the few that wasn't simply an oak bomb) was heavenly.
- Salmon w/ risotto & smoked tomato sauce. This worked wonderfully. My fave main dish of the week.
- Deconstructed Beef Wellington, ONLY offered on the Restaurant Week lunch menu. Even tho it came looking rather unattractive (lots of brown!), and it had the foie gras and mushroom duxelles in separate ""patties"", it tasted great. BUT MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY TEMPERATURE, THEY WON'T ASK! Luckily it was medium rare, I prefer rare, but medium rare is fine for me, too.
- Truffle mac & cheese. Perhaps the best side item on the entire menu. NOW, REGARDING THE CONTROVERSY RE: TRUFFLE OIL. Yes, I know, truffle oil is not truffles, it's chemically induced. BUT added to a cheese item such as this, and a price point easily accessible by the ""rest of us"" (ie dwindling middle class), I'm not going to complain. It went beautifully with the Pinot Noirs during wine week, I'm happy. And who can afford true black and especially white truffles these days? So if you're monied enough to complain about lack of real truffles, eat elsewhere.
- Haricot verts w/ spiced cashews & mild gorgonzola cheese. After a week of hearty, rich dishes, this was a breath of fresh air. Lightest dish in the sides, I'd order this again. So refreshing.
- Chocolate cake. Last time I had this, 6+ months ago, I wasn't as impressed. This time, it was really good, but you MUST share, it's the size of a small boat.
- Coconut cake.
- Carrot cake.

DON'Ts
- Club soda. $4 for a tiny bottle brought to the table. Not even poured for you!
- Buffalo mozzerela & tomato salad. This was good, but I've made better myself with ingredients at the Downtown Las Vegas Farmers' Market.
- Split pea soup. Thin, weak, sad.
- Dry aged prime t-bone steak. I hate to put this on the DON'Ts, but I must. I ordered it rare, it didn't have much flavor, and was rather tough. I'm glad I didn't pay full price ($40+), I got it for a deal (basically $20 during the Restaurant Week, a one-day-only offer). Perhaps they were trying to get rid of them?
- DON'T order ANY dish that has lovely, large looks-like-diver scallops. The kitchen will always send them out so overcooked it will break your heart. Even that ""scallop & sliced prime beef"" dish you see at the top right of the menu. It had an interesting blue cheese fondue, and some of that beef, scallop & sauce combined worked well (strange as that might sound), but the 8 or more large scallops had the consistency of rocks. Very sad.

PS Service can be spotty. First day this week, rather blase'. Rest of the week, good to great service.",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,1,1,3,7E9n6fc_hiC6Vf1b9Dh_Fw
4827705,2009-04-03,1,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Client dinner, in vegas, on expense account - let's do the guys steak night thing.

Smith & Wollensky is obviously a well-known name in the world of steaks, so I was happy to be there

I think this place probably suffered from Vegas-itis too (like other Vegas restaurants I've been to lately).  You take a well-known restaurant from somewhere else or a well-known chef, drop it/he/she in Vegas, don't get it 100% right, and end up with some bastardized version of the original.

Three bottles of Pinot Noir for the table is always a good way to start, so that's what we did.  Appetizers were good, but nothing special.  Your usual mix of caesar salads, iceberg lettuce wedges with bleu cheese and a tomato bisque type soup.

Biggest let down was their signature steak.  I had never been there so I asked the waiter what is the thing they are best known for and he said the ""Cajun Spice Rib Eye"".  The spice is rubbed in and then left to rest for 24 hours, blah, blah, blah.  I think they also told it that it had a nice personality so it would have high self-esteem.  They don't trim the steak so that the extra fat adds more flavor.  The problem was that every other bite had something that was undigestible because it was either fat or sinew.  I think I would have traded the ""flavor"" for just being edible.  Last thing about the steak - never tasted the cajun spice (insert Seinfeld voice - ""called a cajun steak...but wasn't cooked by a cajun and never tasted the spice...what is the deal with that?).  They must have known it was lacking flavor or something because they put their S&W steak sauce out on the table.  I'll be honest, I've never heard of a big-time steak house offering steak sauce.  I wanted to check if they had A-1 while he was at it.

Highlight was actually dessert.  Coconut Layer Cake was awesome.  We also ordered the chocolate mousse, but they mistakenly brought out their ""Gigantic Chocolate Cake"" - no joke, that's what it's called on the menu.  This five layer monstrosity is the size of Fat Bastard's head and as tall as two phone books.  We passed it around the table and still had half of it left.  It was super moist, but it all stayed together when you cut it.  Phenomenal with a little coffee or espresso at the end.

Overall, a pretty mediocre steak night (food-wise) with the fellas, but hey, you're in Vegas, so you let it slide.",1MvdBIcPSzREkAgSYFXpzA,1,1,2,RKyE42yTxapo93huKjBa6w

4857173,2015-02-09,1,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"The last meal of our Work required event, and we were brought over to Smith and Wollensky. It was a sight to behold as over 200 people traipsed from our hotel, down the side walk, through the cross walk and up the other side of the street to the Eatery. People were stopping and staring and I couldn't help but giggle some. 

The location is directly across the street from the Monte Carlo Hotel, and it's a lovely 3 story building, white and gray, it appears spartan on the outside, but on the inside its decorated with dark woods, nautical decor and photographs.  

We were taken to a holding area on the 2nd floor, where drinks and apps were passed. Since I was squeezed into a small corner, I didn't get to try everything, but what I did try - the crab cake - was absolutely decadent, and by now, you know how I feel about sea food. I also got a Rum & Diet, and it appears they only were using top shelf. (ooh la la - so didn't want to see the bill for liquor.. sheesh)

We were then brought into our room and seated, long tables where everyone was seated into different group. Friends sat with friends if they got in early enough, or if you were like my husband and myself, you sat where you could. We ended up at a table where he knew a few people and I made a few new friends, including the Estonian support group. 

The food was delicious. We started with red or white wine, and bread was offered to the table, they were decadent little rolls topped with garlic butter, served in what I can only describe as Monkey bread style. Then our salads came around, crisp ceasar salads topped with almost literal sheets of parmigan cheese and a crustini that had an olive tepanade on it - this was delicious. 

The mains were a choice of a Fillet Mignon, a Stuffed Chicken breast or Pasta Alfredo. My own personal choice was the fillet, served Medium, with a side of mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  It was decadent, you could totally cut the steak with your butter knife, and the meat was - I don't know the spice blend but lordy, it was melt in your mouth amazing.  The sides were so good as well. 

Dessert was New York style cheesecake, though for me, I didn't find that it was exactly New York style, it was lighter, fluffier... It would have been made better with either caramel or chocolate.. otherwise it was a tasty end to the meal, when paired with rich Lavasa Coffee.

4884697,2010-09-25,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Smith & Wollensky's is one of the best steaks you can get in Las Vegas, and that's saying something considering the large amount of great steakhouses we have in town.  The steaks are huge, the service is top notch, and, best of all, there is no corkage fee!  For any of you wine lovers out there this should be a big deal to you.  You can open that First-Growth Bordeaux, or Napa Cabernet Sauvignon with a great steak and not have to pay $35 just to get it opened and poured for you!  I don't know about you, but this is a big deal for me!  The only other place on the strip that has free corkage is Pinot Brasserie at the Venetian (all of Splichal's restaurants do).  

I suggest one steak because it's what I get at every steakhouse: Bone-in Ribeye.  It's like two meals in one.  The juicy steak, and the flavorful bone!  The sides did not impress me too much, but the steak, service, and free corkage bring it up far enough to make it a 5 stars!

4895814,2013-03-17,1,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"This place is awesome! My uncle and I went here this week for Las Vegas 2013 Restaurant Week. We had reservations for 8pm but had to wait about ten minutes for a table. During this time we went to the bar and got a drink. He got a jack and coke and I got pink moscato-very good. We sat in the back of the restaurant-I didn't realize how big the restaurant is! From the outside it looks smaller. 

Once we sat down we received our menus. I feel that this deal for restaurant week is the best. For $40.13 you get three courses ($10 more if you order the filet for the second course) You also get this amazing bread! It is cooked inside a pan and is fresh. For the first course I got the Wollensky salad. I really liked it. It came with potato croutons and bacon which really made the salad. For my second course I got the deconstructed Beef Wellington. It was sooo good! It doesn't look like your normal beef Wellington which made it unique. My Uncle got the coffee and cocoa rubbed filet which I tried as well. Even though it sounds like a weird combo it wasn't at all. It tasted delicious. If you are to get a filet here I would recommend that one. Then for dessert I got the Coconut Cake with the passion fruit sauce and my uncle got the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and we split both of them. Both were great because dessert is always good in my book but my favorite was the Coconut Cake. The passion fruit sauce made it so fruity and tasty. I would definitely want to come back here another time.

I had never been to a two story steakhouse let alone a three story steakhouse.  We huffed it up the stairs and built up our appetites for what was to come.

Crab Cake Appetizer:  Decently sized shredded crab meat, deep fried crusty outer with a juicy delicious center.  Nicely done!

Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing and Blue Cheese Crumbles.  This also was quite tasty.  Almost too tasty as you want to finish the whole thing, and yet also save room for the later courses.

Filet Mignon:  A nice 2+"" cut, cooked to a perfect medium rare.  A few of the orders on our table got mixed up, but mine's was done right.  The meat was tasty, but I'm not a big fan of the Bernaise Sauce that accompanied it.

Macaroni & Cheese with Truffle Oil:  Delicious, but also quite rich and heavy.  If you're suffering from insomnia, this dish will definitely put you down for the count.

Steamed Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce:  A classic side dish which is almost impossible to mess up.

Mashed Potatoes:  Their take on this included finely chopped chives.  It was quite smooth and went well with the meat.

4916401,2008-05-29,1,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I give it a 3.5.

LooUud NOisES!!! This is Vegas peoples and the restaurant is on the strip, so if you want a quiet romantic dinner spot, then I think room service is the best bet. Note that this steak restaurant is not in California, so if you are a Californian steak lover, Vegas is the closest S&W.

I came here with a bachelor party and once inside, we were placed in a table near the restaurant entrance.  The table would have been fitting except for the fact that I was rubbing elbows with the couple next to us (I was on the end part of the table). So for where we were, the table space was itty bitty too tight!

If youre a meat eater, then definitely get the Cajun Marinated Bone-In Rib Eye.  The slab is a pretty hearty size and is their signature steak.  I tried my friends regular Bone-In Rib Eye and it was decent but tasted a bit dry. I would say that the steak is comparable to the ruth chris and mortons of the world. That said, the food item that REALLY caught my eye was the mac and cheese w/ truffle oil. You food lovers know what im talking about - truffle oil makes anything brilliant. The mac and cheese was excellent and was the first dish that was licked clean by our group. On top of this, we ordered the asparagus and fries. Both were nothing special as the asparagus was just lightly salted and the fries were delivered hot and soggy. 

Our server was a big jolly wrestling looking fellow who had a hilarious persona.  The service was legit as we were never without a full glass of water, wine or a drink.  Most impressively, we all (group of 10) received our steaks at the same time, which is a must in my book!

I got the T-bone which was good, fairly average and nothing too special.  The T-bone was pretty big and that put a smile on my face.  Again the taste was average and nothing really struck me as being extraordinary.  Even the sides and appetizers were mediocre in flavor.

4958038,2013-01-16,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"We've been eating at S&W since before we moved to Vegas.  I always get the bone-in ribeye, which is dry aged, my preferred method for aging steaks.  It always has a nice char to it, and is cooked perfectly.  Never had to consider sending a steak back at S&W.  

The crabcakes to start are solid, but not overwhelming.  My wife is a fan of the heirloom tomatoes.  We always get the truffled mac n cheese as a side.  The truffle flavor comes through but doesn't overwhelm the cheese.  Everyone I've spoken to who has had this dish loved it.  The wild mushrooms and onion rings have also been successful side dishes in dinners past.
 
They have several ways you can order a filet, which is not something a lot of other places offer.  Take advantage.

The bar is fantastic, a great classic bar with excellent service.  Good wine list, not the best on the strip but certainly not the worst.  Do yourself a favor and arrive early to enjoy the bar.

The place was dead!  We tried to make a reservation at 4 other places and they were all booked up.  This place was half empty.  I understand that not everyone wants to pay $50 for a steak, but it was New Years Eve.  

The drinks were made perfectly.  The Caesar salad and oysters Rockefeller were great.  We both ordered the Coffee and Cocoa rubbed filet.  This was possibly the best steak I have ever had.

shrimp cocktail the size of my palm.  good cocktail sauce with a good amount of horseradish.

the crab cake is one pc. and has a crispy flakey outside with big chunks of crab meat inside.  

the veggies looked boring (asparagus & broccoli) so i didn't touch those.  the mac n cheese was good (creamy) but nothing mind blowing.
the mushrooms were not bad but nothing great.

they told us that they were known for 4 steaks.  i usually get the filet m. but that one was not part of the 4 so i decided to get their porterhouse for one. ($48), medium rare.

I felt like my steak was not medium rare but somewhere between medium rare and medium.  it had a huge chunk of fat, the size of the crab cake maybe.  the meat was very chewy and did not melt in my mouth.  i was really disappointed.

i tried someone's filet, maybe like a third of it, and it tasted gamey. I also tried to rib eye and though it was the best out of the three that i tried.

I used to go to one on 49th St. for business dinners, because I wouldn't have to pick up the tab.
And, of course, I don't pay when I eat at this one.
It's your usual upscale, pricey, steak house.
Service is always great, the food is great, the atmosphere is great.
The one here is a bit brighter, and a little more cramped downstairs, and a little too romantic upstairs.
It always seems strange that this place takes their classic facade, and drops it smack down in the middle of the strip.
I've been with people who, from a distance, think that it's some sort of museum, because the architecture is so different from everything around them.
Anyway, whenever I walk in, I am transported back to New York.
My favorite thing on the menu is their fried onions.
I could eat those all day (though my wife might take issue with that).

Initially we were at the Bellagio trying unsuccessfully to get a steak at ""Prime"" among other places.  (Travel tip - don't expect to get a nice meal at the Bellagio if you're wearing jeans and a sweater that costs under $1,500)  Thank goodness one of my travel partners lives in L.A. and has the type of connections it seems everyone in L.A. has.  He whips out the trusty iPhone and connects with a corporate party planner who knows the good spots in Vegas like it was her second home.  She tells us to hit Smith & Wollensky which is ""just right across the street"".  Little did we know it was in fact across the street......and about a mile down the road next to MGM.  It didn't help that we were in Vegas during a bout of both cold AND wet so we walked swiftly in the cold misty rain with all of the grace of someone holding in a 3 day dump.

We finally walk into this joint and were transported from the neon glitz of the strip to a corner steak joint somewhere in old town USA.  The decor is basic with decades old sports memorabilia and such on the walls.  We were greeted by an exuberant maitre d' who I'll praise because he noticed our size (6'7"", 6'6"", and 6'3"") and took the time to clear us a table in a spot where we would have plenty of room.

Our server was fantastic.  She was very upbeat and playful and besides the great service she jumped right into our often bawdy and uncensored banter.  We started with manhattans but at the suggestion of our server followed with a round of another house specialty and ended up putting away about a bakers dozen of them between the 3 of us.

When it came time for dinner I ordered their largest bone in prime rib mainly because I caught a whiff of the horseradish when I came in the place and my choice was set pretty much right then and there.  I'm not really exaggerating here when I tell you that this was the prettiest cut of meat I ever had set in front of me.  It tasted as good as it looked....aged to perfection and tender enough to melt in your mouth.  One of my buddies got the smaller cut without the bone and he raved about his as I did of mine and his was similarly picture quality.  Our other friend got the bone in NY strip and it looked amazing and by all accounts it was top notch.  The sides come family style and we got the creamed spinach and hashed browns which both complemented the meal nicely.

We left this place laughing, tipsy, and full to capacity.  You really can't ask for more.  Smith & Wollensky goes on my list next to Craftsteak in MGM of places I'll send people in Vegas when they want a steak they'll think about the other 364 days of the year.",9QE0xWu1FDmgb-ZND9XneA,0,0,5,c_nPWtK1z7ysvvMC1Nwg1g

Place: seemed to have an old school steakhouse vibe. Classic designs and we got our own private room. We had a huge group of 18 people and they didn't charge extra for the room or have any minimum purchase per person like other steakhouses did. They even accommodated moving our reservation back 30 minutes and us arriving about 10 minutes late after that (some of us may have been tired from some Vegas activities...) One complaint was that the music was a little loud, we asked them to turn it down and they gladly did.

Service: awesome! 5 stars. Both the waiters were very personable and helpful. The main waiter took time to explain the whole menu. They joined in on some conversation and made it a great experience. They were very quick to seat us, zero complaints here.

Food: 3 stars. I have a thing for trying ribeyes at different steakhouses and this lands somewhere in the middle. It is a huge portion but I think it seemed a little bland and dry. I didn't get any rubs, just the steak. I would probably opt for an enhancement or cajun next time. We pretty much got all the sides on the menu and those were great. I really liked the lobster mac & cheese (if you like it creamy) and mushrooms (great companion to the steaks). They also gave complimentary bread that was in a caprese style which was delicious. 

Also you can't beat the location of this place, right on the strip and you don't have to walk through a hotel to get there.

The service was past top notch.  I saw one reviewer saying that S&W is not as good as Flemings or Ruth Chris...I wouldn't even put them in the same category.  First off I am a rib eye man and Ruth Chris is a Filet place IMHO.  So I stayed true to my liking and did the Cajun ribeye. Flemings is just mediocre from my times there.  Back to the Ribeye, this steak just simply melted in your mouth. Yes there was a lot of fat, but that is to be expected on a Prime Aged ribeye. I carefully cut around all of it while the guy who was sitting next to me (this was a coporate party of 12 people) eat every last drop of that fat.  If you don't like that type of cut the some nice NY strips and nice Filet's as well.

Overall the creamed spinach is top notch, I had not ever had the mac and cheese with lobster, it was great and the asparagus were very good.

I would take this over Morton's, Flemings, RC, or just about any other chain. To do better you need to go with the one-off steak house, Peter Luger's comes to mind. There are just not many better.

Did I mention the CAJUN Ribeye? If you like some spice, this is a no brainer. If your not afraid to look like a gluton order the tomahawk one, of course it would help if you do not have to pay the bill as that is a spendy cut.",LlqQQhm0FFfbEoj66Sf1cQ,1,0,5,WSZsMPLn7uvDWDyJo6F7hA

It's a small private room, with one wall that's all glass, looking directly into the kitchen.

We ordered steaks--I don't remember what they were called.  It's a steakhouse--order steaks--they will be good.  Order drinks, because everything tastes better when you're drinking.  My review is not to recommend a particular cut of steak or impress you with my encyclopedic knowledge of mixed drinks--I'm sure there's plenty of yelp reviews for that.

Here are my points:
1) For a special occasion, request the Chef's Table.  You get to see inside the bustling kitchen, and you can shut the door, so people can't eavesdrop on your fascinating conversations.  I'm actually not sure how this reservation works since someone else booked it--I was just there to join in on the good times!!!

2) Request Eddie as your server :)  Eddie was very warm and friendly, and he made us feel right at home.  He went the extra mile to make sure the Bachelorette's glass was always at least 1/2 full.  It's actually kind of magical that Eddie would just show up and refill all of our drinks :)  I think that's probably the most important thing when partying in Vegas, esp a Bachelorette--the drinks shall over-floweth.  Eddie was also very knowledgeable about the menu--the creamed spinach and lobster truffle Mac and cheese were ah-mazing!!!!!

Day 4: 

This is a staple steakhouse across the US. I did not know that it comes from the same creator of T.G.I.Friday's. The straight forward menu and service is classic and practical. Not much on the menu is extremely innovative, but it is solid.

The drinks menu is dominated by items made with ginger beer. I got a Lima Mule and it was light and refreshing. It uses Cachaça, a liquor fermented from sugarcane. I wished more places carry it because it tastes so much better than rum.

Our first course was a caprese salad. The heirloom tomatoes were vibrant, but had little flavor to them. The mozzarella cheese was the integral aspect of the whole dish. It was fresh, creamy and slightly sweet. I could have just eaten a plate full of that and basil alone. 

As for our entrees we decided to upgrade to the 10oz filet for an additional $10. It was worth getting. They offer all prime meats and the steaks were grilled well. I got mine topped with the foie gras mushroom ragout. I did not get much of the foie flavor, but it was a tasty sauce. True to most steakhouses, no sides came with it. We ordered the truffle mac and cheese and it was spot on when it came to flavor. The only down side was the texture of the pasta. It was cooked for too long and lost the necessary bite. The butternut squash gorgonzola dish was decent. The cheese just over powered everything else. 

The chocolate cake was shockingly light. I was stuffed by the end of the entree, but I kept eating the cake.

We made reservations for 9pm. It was quiet in there on a Monday nite. We liked the decor of the place. Very homey with hardwood floors and a classic steakhouse appeal. It had a sense of country diner with a hint of uppity restaurant. 

Mama fell in love with her bleu cheese stuffed olive Martini. She says they made it very well. The bread they provide as an appetizer is not too shabby. I didn't eat much just so I can save room in the belly for the cow i was going to consume. 

By the way, they dont' offer the promotional Summer menu at the table. You have to ask for it. No big deal. I felt we should be rewarded for doing our homework. Our waiter did inform us that the promo portions are slightly less grandiose than the traditional menu portions. We kind of figured that to be the case. 

I ordered the Cajun Marinated Ribeye and mama had the Salmon with lump crabmeat and fingerlings. We were hoping that the portions would be sufficient enough to keep us from going back to Denny's later in the evening. 

I guess the non-promotional Ribeye is 22oz. My Summer portion came out to ""only"" 18oz. 18 OUNCES!?!?!?!?! Are you effing kidding me? That thing was huge! The cajun marinade gave a great crust to the outer shell all the while keeping the middle medium and juicy. Mama had already relegated, especially after the watier reiterated, that the ""lump"" crab meat would be sparse. Then it came out. Holy mother of crab. The salmon was pretty much sitting on a bed of Crab Meat. A BED OF CRAB MEAT! I think the chef confused the crab meat for the fingerling potatoes and filled that plate with crab instead of potato. 

My ribeye was absolutely magnificent. Cooked perfectly. Crusty seasoning encased the mouth watering tenderness that was my medium steak. I can't say enough about it without going out to the store right now to buy some red meat.

What more can be said about mama's Salmon? I mean, the Salmon was actually the secondary part of that dish. The Crab meat with mushrooms and fingerlings were the star of that plate. Don't get me wrong, the Salmon was delicious, but, the Crab was the star. Absolutley magnificent. 

Here are the reasons why no 5star... When we first got seated, there was butter on the seat. Luckily, mama missed sitting on it. The host was very nice about it, wiping it up and asking mama if she wanted to move. Mama declined since she liked our seat. Unfortunately, when I picked up the wine menu, there was butter on that thing too! WTF? I mean, those 2 things dont' kill the night, but, I had higher expectations for restaurant quality. Oh, and because I had told them earlier about mama's birthday, they brought a little cupcake out with a candle. It was very sweet of them, but, it was dryer than the vegas desert.

Still, one of the best dinners we've had in Vegas.",R12GCq7XczBpP99KzenLAQ,1,0,4,B3SCECQBKta_eN7oB3WqMg

We brought our own special magnum of bubbly from our home collection, and the server had it in a silver ice bucket with a napkin swaddling the top within seconds.  Our party of 3 started with a half dozen oysters, and each of us received individual oyster dressing plates complete with red wine vinegar, tartar, cocktail sauces, and half a lemon covered in mesh netting to catch any seeds.  

The Baby Heirloom Tomato, Mozzarella, and Arugula Salad was light and bursting with flavor.  For the main course I had their Deconstructed Beef Wellington topped with Foie Gras & Wild Mushrooms with roasted vegetables.  This dish was rich and decadently meaty with a light puff pastry under the steak.  My friends who both opted for the Filet Mignon were both jealous over this dish.

We were doing the Spring Restaurant Week, so dessert was included.  Dessert was a choice of coconut or chocolate cake.  They call it a slice of cake, but it is one more hunka chunka cake.

5549893,2011-03-22,1,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Came to Smith and Wollensky for an early dinner the week we were at the MGM for a staycation, mainly because husband wanted steak and we do not like CraftSteak.   We specifically wanted someplace we had never been to before that we could walk to, so we wanted to try this legendary steakhouse chain.

This is a decent, reliable place to get a steak, but I wouldn't rate it in the top steakhouses I have been to in Las Vegas.  I ordered the surf and turf, which was a half maine lobster and a petite fillet.  I thought both were okay, nothing I have not have better in other places.  The prices were not outrageous, as I don't remember what we paid.  If it was too expensive, I would have remembered.  My biggest complaint was that the fillet was bland and it tasted as if there was no seasoning whatsoever.  My husband had the bone-in fillet which was more flavorful, but he said it did not hold a candle to his favorite fillet from Vic and Anthony's in the Golden Nugget.

Normally I would give a place like this three stars, because it was okay.  But I had seen that the coconut cake that is served here was highlighted in a food network show and other food shows.  I don't normally partake in dessert at all, ever, but I had to try it.  It was ""holy shit,"" good, and is probably the best dessert I have ever tasted.  Here's a picture of it from a famous food blog that I frequently read:

http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sugar-rush-smith-wollenskys-coconut-cake-dessert-nyc.html

This is like coconut heaven, if there is such a place.  I could have eaten a troth of this cake, but they would take me away in a coma.  My husband, who does not like coconut, even tried it and said it was pretty damn good (he'll never admit he loved it though).

I would come here again just to eat coconut cake.  Thank god it is on the strip in an area that is a pain in the ass to get to, or I might do that too much.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,1,4,OnBznmGeu8Ogbfn7dNiE2g

5597310,2016-11-13,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Another multinational chain and another one supposing itself to be high end, though they didn't seem to really bother with this place. It feels more like a fish house than a steak house, actually. Lots of white trim, but also lots of white paint...maybe even more like a boat than a restaurant. It also is in a peculiar location on the Strip, with the door in a little alleyway off to the side, perhaps that and the nondescript exterior paint to keep the Vegas wildlife on the Strip more at bay.  Before I get much further into this, seriously nothing will expose the conceit of pretension as far as high end as handing someone a paper menu and a stained one at that, which is what I got here. For the menu prices, they can definitely afford better...and a lot more sanitary.

To the meal, the majority of sides could have used work. Steak Tartare was a disaster. Beef bacon was also a near total miss. Rib Eye Carpaccio was the best of the lot but also required more work than an appetizer should. The potatoes, both varieties that were there and the mac and cheese as well, were offensively bad. Dessert was acceptable, but a chocolate layer cake is hardly challenging, though the cake itself was slightly dry.

As to the steak, they had a t-bone and given the choice, I have a hard time passing up either that or porterhouse. This one was probably closer to the latter rather than the former, but fine by me. The cut was solid, the cook was near flawless. Flavoring was not something I would put near the top of what I've had, but no real complaints, either. Service was also exemplary, easily among the best I've experienced in Vegas and were the other food items and the paper menu itself less disgusting, they probably would have earned the bump all by themselves.",orHVoIN1Oj_rK3KDqcGBIQ,0,1,3,ISB7yecCo6QLGJiv5qH-3g

FOOD: Salad was ok, nothing special except the real yummy bacon in it. Had a side of creamed spinach. My bench mark for that is from IZZY's in San Francisco. This creamed spinach tasted like frozen chopped spinach with some bland cream. Seltzer water was a small bottle of Canada dry. Low class for this sort of eatery. My rib steak came out over cooked. I sent it back and got a new one and it was perfect! Loved it!

SERVICE: Service was very good. Pleasant waiters who were knowledgeable, prompt and friendly. When my steak came out over, they took it away no bantering. Even brought out more spinach. Would have been great if the spinach was good. Good creamed spinach always tastes like more, after all!

ROOM: Shoddy. Yes, worn and drab and old. Woodwork was not polished. Bar seemed like an old pub bar. This kinda money means a well appointed room. BIG FAIL here. Morton's, Lawry's both got them beat hands down. So does Gallagher's at New York New York and Hugo's at the Four Queen's. SOOOO many good steak houses in Vegas that you do not have to settle for this kind of room and food.",5mkRo6VhwdYQ0X2qbBFE_Q,2,0,3,WCshly8iLgPFJpTbDLexQw

Bottle of Cakebread Cabernet was $47 less expensive than another steakhouse we considered.... Bonus!!!,bIz_Fo4RJUFhtmpWi0dlQw,0,0,5,S-QXGUvVggAeZ9A4cPPZ5Q
5865368,2017-01-29,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I was fairly disappointed with the food.  The steak came out on the cool side and really lacked the great flavor of a dry aged rib eye.  The crab cocktail was good and the wedge salad was good as well, minus never enough dressing.  The lobster mac and cheese was ok, I have had much better.  Overall as a local, there are many other choices st this point I would take.",91qLUJP_nljeOi8G4uQzWw,0,0,3,kjF7_TW9yT-MPw31ybExYg

This place is ginormous, and this was my first time here. 
The space for our event was great, and there were multiple buffet tables- cheese station, Caesar salad station, mac n cheese station, carving station and even dessert. And, lots of passed appetizers!
I was so impressed with the selection. 
The beverage selection was also great- they even had Sam Adams & Lagunitas reps handing out beers and schwag. Love the beer bottle sweater and the mason jar glasses!
That was a neat perk. I also had a Moscow mule, which was frankly underwhelming. I suspect that they hadn't intended to serve those for the party, but the sign on the bar did advertise the mule as the featured drink. We could also get whiskey and/or wine from a table near the buffets. Very nice!
The decor was pretty standard upscale steakhouse, and the view from the event area was right onto the Strip and the Monte Carlo. If I were a wealthy woman I would probably come here more than once in 9 years!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,4,nsEtkHzSYXDmUYiq9JkyLg

5904726,2016-06-30,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"Truthfully I've never known this place was here, had it not been for Yelp I probably would have been missing out on one of the best steakhouses I've ever eaten at.  What really pulled me in was the different ""enhancements"" you could get with your steak and after seeing that on their menu this place needed to happen.  

The wife and I went on a Tuesday so there wasn't a lot of people around and I didn't really look around to much to see if there was any additional seating besides the main area.  I've always hated going to restaurants that don't seat you right away and instead turn you to the bar area even though there's plenty of seating available...sorry but i came here to eat steak not socialize at the bar.  This place didn't do that +1!  The host was very professional as well at the wait staff.  They were always coming around checking up on us, which was pretty nice.

So we decided to order the Filet Mignon with blue cheese on the side as well as Truffled Mac and Cheese.  After a while the food came out and we started to dig in.  I gotta say, hand down one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The Truffle Mac and Cheese was just right, not too overpowering but really spot on for taste.  The blue cheese side with the steak made it even better...I was even trying to mix the left over cheese from the mac with my steak, just as good as the blue cheese. 

Overall this place blew my mind.  I figured this place was going to be good, I didn't expect it to top my list of steakhouses.  If I have one bad thing to so about this place it would be why do you have to be so far from San Francisco!",VxvFf0NeKk5lT-4Wdp9qkw,0,0,5,XAC8JkZ-6Upzdp5nfqVkbQ
5940853,2012-10-09,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I love this place. The Wife and I have eaten here the last few times we've been to Vegas. This last time we ate there twice in two days. The experience is always the same: top notch.

Steaks are great, they know their way around a cow. Bone-in filet is stunning.

Don't leave without sharing the mac and cheese. I didn't know what truffle oil tasted like until I had this mac and cheese. You'll have dreams about this mac and cheese after you go to bed the night (morning?) after eating it.

Service is always astounding. Being Vegas, there are a fair amount of tourists coming in and out of any restaurant on the strip. My wife and I show up for lunch in our tourist rags, sweaty, probably looking like hell. But the service always is the same. Classy, respectful, attentive and amiable. The staff here are true professionals.",UdGows31OnUBz_7yDlvNJA,2,0,5,6SeYybJIyciLDRJDTOxqPA
5947872,2017-04-28,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"I hate to say it, but I think I'm done with this place. The service has been just awful the last couple of times. And to charge these astronomical prices, everything has to be spot on. 

The final straw: we sat down and waited for a good ten minutes before the barkeep took our drink order. We were starving, but he didn't drop menus or bother to ask us if we were hungry. Then he takes off before we can ask for menus. Our glasses are now empty. But nothing. Our empty glasses just sit on the bar. By the time the guy comes back to ask if we want more drinks, we had already researched a steakhouse that might actually want our business. (Hint -- BRAND STEAKHOUSE right across the street, where we had an amazing experience.) 

I guess all good things come to an end.",zxmIKyEX89aY0QLC1JJksA,0,0,2,H1Df-21V5-Q9zE_4BeM8zw

How can my review differ so much from fellow yelpers?

No ambiamce, the menu tries too hard......and I still can't get over the fact that we paid 200.00 for it.   Instead I could have cooked a mean 10x better for less then half the price.    And yes I can cook duck, root vegies, beef, my grilled asparagus actually has a crisp to it.....I could go on........ugh!!!!",qdnFbywyGNoULuOkz5WvXQ,0,0,1,gRgetbTmh6U3WFiRPKgeig
5985035,2017-02-01,0,NmOBomyz63TP9Nn2q4Z1rg,"My husband and I had NYE dinner here and it was quite a treat! Nice upscale ambience, but could be a little more romantic.

Perfectly cooked 8oz. Filet Mignon and 24 oz. Ribeye steaks. Ordered warm bluecheese on the side which I couldn't help but eat like soup, the sharpness of the cheese paired well with the savory steak. We ordered a side of mushrooms (could have been more flavorful) plus a side of mac & cheese, which was so comforting and delicious.  

We also ordered the shellfish tower which consisted of Lobster, Alaskan King Crab, Jumbo Shrimp, Oysters & Clams paired with Classic Cocktail Sauce, Cognac Mustard Sauce, Ginger Sauce & Sherry Mignonette. I love when I have so many options for dipping sauces! Great presentation too. 

The bread basket was delicious too - definitely asked for more. 

Because it was our first New Year as a married couple, they presented us with a cheesecake on the house, complete with a candle for making a wish. Thanks, S&W!

Cons: it is on the pricy side, shellfish tower was $68 and that was just an appetizer, but can be expected for a nice steak house. Also, they were out of two of the bottles of wines we chose which was annoying and I felt like they should've given us a discount on the bottle we did end up ordering because of the inconvenience.",cfHtC48QrqMNJFReloMOEQ,1,1,4,uOHoOUOnABg6ScOeT3ObwA
