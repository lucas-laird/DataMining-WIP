We ordered Three Pastas, Antipasto Salad and Garlic Bread. All of the pasta was dried out, with little to no sauce and no flavor. The Meatballs tasted like Chef Boyardee out of the can, The Steak on one of the dishes had no seasoning and was dried out. The salad was just OK,  Bread sticks tasted like they were a couple of days old.  The place looks cool nice idea but poor exaction.  The whole setup looks wrong. The cashier has to walk through the hot line to get in and out of the station. The cooks are passing everything down to the end of the line to be served.",yGiY4a4xYBgjyhmAst3M2g,0,0,1,YR_dlVBis1HekfLEUTmmTQ

Sides that were tried:

Cauliflower grati: kinda mushy and couldn't really taste the cheese in the sauce. 

gnocchi: Sauce chosen to go with this was the broccoli pesto. I wanted to try something different and have never had a broccoli pesto before. I didn't like it. It as blank the gnocchi was over cooke because again it was mushy. Might have been pre-prepared because the tops of the dumplings were dry. 

Pasta dishes that we ordered:
broccoli pesto: bland and not satisfying. Had to add salt and some other ingredients to make it through the meal 

farm house

the bottle service pasta: probably the best one that we tried out of the three. Still bland and not quite as flavorful as described in their description. 

You go in your order they give you a number and the food is  brought to you. 

a great idea but needs work in the flavor department. Checked in on yelp and got a coupon for free breadsticks. Those also were not amazing. Olive garden beats their breadsticks.",zm5ZxCeFYT4GD8u4v60D-Q,0,0,2,NwCht8-QbeaQ_A6upHuqNg

I ordered the Broccoli Pesto with angel hair pasta. Absolutely disgusting. It tasted like I was just taking bites out of raw garlic cloves. The garlic was so strong, it literally made my eyes water. 

The pasta was cooked fine and the chicken was okay, if only I was able to actually taste the broccoli pesto, and not just clumps of garlic.

This hasn't been my first time here. I've order a few other times, and everything else that I've ordered in the past has always been bland, dry, and tasteless.

I got the lunch special that came with a stale cold breadstick, cold and salty soup (corn chowder), and a ""create-your-own"" pasta. The soup was terrible, the breadstick was terrible, and the pasta was so so.

This was the first time trying it and I will never go again.  I'm wondering how people could eat this food.  I have been sick, so I was looking for a nice chicken noodle soup - but delivered because I'm sick.  I wouldn't even call this soup.  It was a mixture of half cooked carrots, celery, and peas along with hard stringy dry chicken pieces.  There was about a tablespoon of broth that had the flavor of water.  No salt, no pepper, no flavor at all.  My son who was not sick, agreed.  I figured macaroni and cheese would be the best ever since it is what they say they do.  Nope.  Flavorless and no seasoning.  How do they actually serve this crap and call it Mac and cheese?  
Also ordered baked rigatoni - had some flavor, but mushy and below average for sure.

My friend enjoyed the Farm, and he mentioned the peas were really tasty.

Everything was clean, and some rockin' 60's music gave it a comfortable atmosphere. They even have rice pasta, for the gluten challenged Yelpers.

They had lots of add-ins, and I think that if you get the ""pre-mades"", you're slacking in your creativity. The real genius of this place is using a comfort dish while allowing you to be adventurous, with their wide selection of  pastas, cheese and ingredients.

I wanted to use the Yelp check-in special, as I am pulling it up on my phone I order my 2 main meals. Still trying to pull it up on my phone, Robert the GM just stands and stares at me. A pop up said yelp couldn't be loaded and to try again later. I handed my phone to him and asked if I can still get the drink even though yelp was down and couldn't check in. He said no, he needed to see that I checked in. Okay whatever, a drink costs 2 bucks. I will pay for the drink. Good customer service especially coming from a General Manager should of just honored it. My total was about 20 bucks, paid him the money, sat down and waited for my order. Both dishes came cold. I went back up to tell him and he asks for my receipt so he can give me my money back. I told him that he didn't give me a receipt. He says he can't give me my money back without one. Hello I was just up there 5 minutes ago why can't you give me my money back? He finally gives in and gives me 6 dollars back!!!!!!! 6 dollars???!!!!  I told him each one of my dishes were 7 dollars. He says yes, but I gave you a 20% discount for meatless Monday. Um ok that still doesn't equal 6 dollars. After I explain this to him he tells me ""oh well you don't have your receipt to prove how much you paid for anything.""

What a joke. How is this guy a General Manager???  I was so mad I left without getting my money back. I will not be back here until he is gone. If you do go, check out his name badge.

449102,2012-01-17,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"I like the concept of make your own pasta dish from fresh, organic and healthy products but man can the price add up if you decide to make your own or add extra ingredients. Personally I enjoy the pepper jack mac with chicken. The flavor of pepper jack just explodes in your mouth and adds a nice little zing to every bite. The good thing is that portion size makes up for the price you pay so as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. 

Word of advice - use the Yelp check-in and you receive a regular drink and free garlic bread sticks, totally worth it or else you're paying $13-$15 for a bowl of mac & cheese.

I've come into Mac Shack at different times and one of the negative things is that the quality of the food is never consistent. My last trip here was fantastic which was during the day! The pasta actually had sauce on it where my previous visit (at night) my poor noodles were dry. It would be great if there was a little more cooking consistency.

I had the ""Philly Cheese Steak Mac"" ($10/$13) and pureed corn chowder ($4). Total bill came to $40 for two large pasta dishes, two soups, and two large soft drinks. The soup was out of this world, maybe consider serving this or other soups cold (as I write this it's 110 F degrees in Las Vegas). The mac and cheese was well seasoned, the amount of beef was underwhelming. 

Although the atmosphere is light and airy, we were beset by houseflies, having to swat them away the entire time. I've lived in Las Vegas for three years and I've never seen a housefly here, anywhere. I swear this place had flies like the outhouse at Grandpa's farm.

For about half the price of my pasta I could have ordered a pasta dish at the Macaroni Grill with about 3 times as much food.

The salads didn't find their way to our table until a few minutes after our pasta. They had a strong fishy flavor and lacked the salty garlic taste I expect in a Caesar salad. The mac and cheese had a strange sweetness to it, possibly from the barbecue sauce they put in it. If you order this dish ask them to leave it out. Better yet, don't order it. There was very little smoky flavor other than in the bacon itself. Some red pepper flake (in a shaker on the table) helped a bit, but I didn't finish more than a few bites.

The rigatoni was OK but the meat sauce was a bit short on meat. And again, basic seasoning was lacking.

What they call garlic bread is actually breadsticks. Honestly, Olive Garden does them better. I get an order free on my next visit thanks to my Yelp check-in, but I don't think there will be a next visit.",1d3a13DqVbqIsa6lqD7WEg,0,0,2,WUKK9ePPny8wCYxIDUrnEQ

The broccoli pesto is served over penne with chicken and sauteed garlic. It was dreadful. The pasta was underdone and overdone, depending on the bite. It was bad news. The chicken was so dry I could have easily mistaken them for breadcrumbs. The pesto was overpowered by garlic only a slight bitterness shined through.

The pepperjack mac also has monterey jack and asiago cheeses.  It was better than the broccoli pesto. The noodles were cooked evenly and it had a little kick.

Pepperjack Mac
Asiago/Blue Mac
Pea Soup
Caesar salad
Pasta with pesto , sundried tomato, mushroom and shrimp ( but shrimp was left off ) 
angel hair with garlic/olive oil shrimp ( yeah ! they inlcuded the shrimp this time )

The big winner was the angel hair with the garlic /olive oil - great flavor
the Mac n Cheese - decent flavor but i'm a baked m&c kinda guy - at least prep the m&c in the pan, then put some bread crumbs/cheese on top and put it under a broiler for a minute or so - just a personal preference.

soup - ok - bacon was a nice touch.

salad - in dire need of more dressing - ok

The variety of options you get for your pasta, sauce, and toppings are great.  In addition to all of that, are a few salads, some breadsticks, and they have wine as well.

I'm already drooling..Not even going to get started about how addicted I am. I love the little coupons they have and punch cards along with Check-In offer via Yelp, of course. Here's the real after burner. Save your receipt form Mac Shack and bring it next door for a 20% discount from Golden Spoon Frozen Yogurt. And the best part is that the offer works both ways/vice-versa, if you're a desserts before dinner kind of person.  The pricing may seem a little bit high, but you do get what you paid for in noodles. oodles and oodles of it. Haaah, I can barely finish my bowl and I eat like a maniac. But overall, Mac Shack was a incredible experience for me. The friendly staff to the great food. Awesome.

But lately I have been getting the chicken noodle soup (which is pretty good) and the grilled mac and cheese (seriously amazing!!).  My boyfriend took a bite of it and was extremely jealous.

My boyfriend gets the crazy alfredo (chicken, sausage, shimp, red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, jalapenos, alfredo sauce) and absolutely loves it.  We also get the garlic bread, which in all honestly needs a little salt and should be cooked longer.

We've been curious for sometime and today was the day.

People have short attentions spans so I'll keep this review brief.

Upon entering there was no line and we went straight to the register at 2:05pm on a Saturday afternoon. Our cashier later turned out to be the ""manager"" We told him this was our first visit and asked for a walk through. He pointed to the menu and explained ""I guess they call these the pastas"" he made no mention of their $7.99 lunch special, or their rewards program. -first time visitor-fail!

$27 for two people eager to try out the goods. I ordered the philly Mac ($9.95) and added mushrooms for .65. See the photos for details, all proteins here are portioned out to 2.5 ounces. I paid $10 for the philly, and only received a drizzle of meat. What a joke.

The staff was busier singing along to Justin Beiber and playing with the stereo system than cleaning. The benches are torn and there's trash all over the floor. As I write this review 38 minutes after walking in the door they are finally making a half attempt to sweep.

***training tip*** the worker who is sweeping also delivers orders to waiting tables. Please train her to keep her thumbs out of pasta and soup bowls. A minute ago she was sweeping trash, and now she's got her thumbs inside of food bowls. There was no hand washing in between, I watched!

It's an interesting concept, and the food wasn't awful, but the portions sizes are a joke (tons of Mac, a dribble of anything else) the staff is young and inexperienced and the facility is quickly going downhill.

Next time I'll save my $27 and go elsewhere.",wJHWpXEoo4B_A6iaQ1-Z8Q,5,1,2,A9Jgutd_KQP4UvItftivXQ

It's a pretty reasonable price compared to their regular menu, which I don't really care for. I find the regular menu to be too expensive. 

Mac Shack is convenient for me since it's right across from work. Besides that, I probably wouldn't visit. Just because pasta is something I can always whip up at home, but if I'm in a pasta kinda mood during my lunch break at work, I would head over here.

I've done pretty much any combo you could imagine in their lunch special. My pasta has always been al-dente for the most part & I seriously have eaten here over 20+ times for the past few years I've worked at my workplace. I particularly like their meat sauce. Sometimes I add bacon or sausage for an add'l fee. Don't really care for their Tomato Soup but I do order it if I don't feel like eating a salad with my pasta. And about that salad, they're not consistent with it. Sometimes I'd get too much dressing or lack it. Too much croutons or I'd be lucky to have at least 4 in there.

And the bread.. A year ago, I loved the garlic bread. Probably my favorite part of my meal. I'm not sure what they're doing now but they've changed it a couple times, perhaps experimenting which one would be the best type of bread. Honestly, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

All in all, I suggest coming here for lunch for their lunch special. Good price for a complete meal. But if you can just cook your own pasta at home, I suggest just doing that.",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,3,1,3,yjC0NN0TlyZ4_xETSdasBg

I filled out the info for them to deliver and realized they were about to close for the evening. I called them and they took my order for pickup, which wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it beat going out to eat.

I ordered a custom pasta with whole wheat noodles, Alfredo sauce, broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus, jalape√±os and sun dried tomatoes. I wanted a salad to go with it so the guy recommended a Green Machine side salad.  $12.97 including tax, not bad for a large custom pasta order + salad. 

I arrived a few minutes before they closed and forgot I had transferred my credit card to my gym bag, so all I had was a bunch of change at the bottom of my purse. Uh oh. I walked in and scraped together 1's and all of the coins in my purse and i had just enough!  Phew!  The guy was really nice and patient while I was annoyingly scraping up my change for him. Lol.

I brought my pasta home and opened my pasta...smells so good!  It was delicious!  The jalape√±os were cut perfectly so even if I are one in a bite, it didn't overwhelm the flavors of everything else.

1434854,2013-07-01,3,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"This is a place for when you're in the mood to order ""fast food"" pasta.  

I've been here three times now and have officially written it off.  It's like this place is where decent pasta goes to die.  Each time I go, I hope for the best, but am always let down.  

I've respectively given this place two stars for their service, convenience of being able to order online and the fact that I didn't get food poisoning.  

I understand that this is a place to grab quick pasta.  So, expecting the cr√®me de la cr√®me is asking for a wee bit too much.  However, most of the plates average about $9.00 - $10.00 a piece, and that's usually for the smaller plates.  I can spend $10.00 for a way better pasta plate at any legit Italian joint.   I always try to order the healthier stuff.  Gluten free noodles and I build my own pasta so that I can ensure what exactly will go into the plate.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of times my plates are missing certain ingredients that I clearly paid for, and it's like you make up for the missing ingredients with lots-o-oil.  Sucks.

Anywho, the customer service is great here!  The people working are always friendly and quick.  You also get free garlic bread and a drink upon check in.  However, the garlic bread has always been kind of stale and flavorless.  The pasta is always super oily.  I understand how to make good pasta and oil is an active ingredient, however, there's always a ton of oil and grease leftover.  It's just too much.  After finishing a plate, I always feel like I just ate six orders of super-sized french fries at Micky D's.   I also feel the need to wash my face due to the overuse of oil.  It's that bad.  You just feel all-around crappy.  

Lastly, their Mac 'n' Cheese kind of sucks, too.  Almost as if it's doused in the worst cheese money can offer and a ton of oil.  It just doesn't work for me.  Like the pasta, I'm always left feeling AWFUL due to all the oil thrown into their dishes.  

Don't waste your money.  Either, get a decent, quick plate at Noodles and Co. or make your own.  You'd be better off getting jarred marinara sauce and 99 cent noodles at the market.

Owners/Staff:  Maybe using less oil in your dishes?  Or finding a way to funnel out some of the oil so that we're not left with a bowl full of oil.  It's similar to eating lucky charms and being left with the pink and sweet flavored milk.  Only difference being that the pink milk tastes good.  Also, when people build their own pasta...  Ensuring all ingredients are in said pasta and plenty of it as you charge 50 cents for each ingredient.  50 cents for basil?  Two words:  Rip-off.",0uo7LHVMFaDf1PkcGZprNg,6,1,2,6kTY55obdet0GAs_hq88Rg

This is a beautifully designed restaurant housing macaroni containers and beautiful scenic artwork on the walls. The restaurant was very clean. However, it was empty when I walked in and the cashier acted as though he did me the favor of taking my order. The cashier Patrick had no personality, but robotically said ""sure,"" and ""no problem"" several times with little or nothing more to say. 

This was a to-go order. Overall, the Pepper Jack dish $8.65 with added sausage (6 small slices) for an additional $1.95 was nothing special. The sausage was flavorless. I honestly wondered if it was colored tofu. 

The Spinach Artichoke Mac was reportedly good from a teenage standpoint - but he just got braces and was thankful to have something he could eat! My thought - $9.50 for a small bowl of cheesy macaroni is ludicrous. I could make a huge pot of goulash or macaroni with sausage for less - and I wouldn't have to hear ""no problem"" in the process.

Mac Shack has three salads and two soups to choose from and a build your own pasta option that all combine to meet the demands of even the pickiest of eaters.

I opted for the Spinach Salad that comes with walnuts, thinly sliced red onions and pears, not the greatest for your breath but certainly the right blend of crisp and crunchy.  It even comes with a mini-muffin that was both soft and buttery.  As for my pasta I went with the Red Rigatoni that was topped off with meatballs, sausage, and roasted red peppers.  I did enjoy the meatballs and sausage where were more than I expected with such an affordable dish.

Like many Las Vegans, I used my groupon. I actually had two. So, when I came in with my Mom, the cashier told me that I can't use two groupons for two people (per the fine print). BUT, he did say that if we ordered separately, then it would work.

I love it when the staff is friendly enough to bend the policy to suit the customers needs without causing any harm to the venue. This is good customer service.

I ordered the Pepper Jack Mac and it was divine. Mac and Cheese with PepperJack. Phenom. Also, topped off with FRESH (not canned) jalapenos. Also ordered the basic salad. Also fantastic.

My food came out rather quick. It was hot. Tasty. And everything I come to expect from the Mac Shack.

One thing I'd love to see (not a criticism) is ""dish of the month"" or newer pasta combinations. These can help inspire customers to create their own pastas from the menu.

1751484,2010-09-29,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"This place rocks. I was a bit apprehensive about coming here. Many places say they have gluten free choices, but when you're actually at the restaurant many servers and employees look at you like you're speaking another language. I was so relieved when coming to the Mac Shack. The manager, Robert, was so knowledgeable about food allergies/sensitivities that I was able to enjoy my food without worrying about having a reaction. 

This restaurant is pretty big and has a open feel. It felt like I was getting a gourmet meal without having to get dolled up, parking etc. Place your order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Perfect. Done. You choose your pasta, sauce and toppings. All orders are cooked to order, which helps decrease the chances of cross contamination. They also have salads and their own creations available. 

I ordered the gluten free pasta with garlic-oil sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, porcini mushrooms and cheese. It was heaven and a great combination. Pasta was cooked perfectly, which is an art with gluten free pasta. My friends tasted it and they loved my combination and said they would have never known it was gluten free pasta. In fact, they had to help me finish my food because the portion was fairly large for me. They did not hesitate. 

One of my friends had the asiago mac n cheese and the other made her own combination w/meatballs. They both loved their dishes too. 

This is now one of my favorite restaurants off of the strip and will return when loading up on carbs for the Vegas 1/2 in December.",Y2jaBiziIx5nd6xnzLZOUg,2,1,5,bMnzMfrpTM2KGkLYXYdNlA

When I told them that I'd just find somewhere else to eat (and I did), NEITHER of them made any effort to retain my business.

One night me and the BF were looking for salad for our resolution diet. We've been passing by Mac Shack and finally decide to try it. It was around 820pm and mind you they close at 9pm. So, I was worried they'd deny us of service. But the moment we walked in.. First things first they greeted us. In other words, the didn't mind at all to serve us for their last remaining minutes.

Cool thing was the menu was pretty ""self-explanatory"". They had a section of create-your-own pasta and a section of creations of their own.

I created my own. Bow tie pasta with spicy red sauce. The spice was perfect. I added ricotta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and zucchini. Cool thing is, if you're not sure what any of those ingredients look like.. They have physical samples right underneath a glass, which is conveniently the cash register table. It's great for the visual learners :). I'm not a big wine fan but they do serve it. And afterwards they have tootsie pops on your way out.

The seating is plenty. There's even outdoor seating, although it's been too cold lately, I'd love to sit next to the orange tree. But the inside art work is gunna do for now. Parking is also plenty.

I used to Love coming here. I love the concept,  it's quick, it's easy, and afordable. 

However, the past few times the sauces have been bland and pasta has been very over cooked.  I think it's safe to assume they've changed Ingredients.  Orders have been wrong and service is lackluster at best.

Today went in and 2 girls were chatting behind the counter.  I was greeted when I walked in, but stood there waiting to order. I don't think I could have been much more obvious.. then a man (I assume manager) starts talking to them about someone who will be calling for him all while I'm standing there waiting to order.

I got my order in literally 2 minutes. However,  while waiting I overhead the manager speaking to someone he just hired that he just hired about how his employees go out partying all night, etc. This wasn't like I was being nosy. I was sitting at the counter waiting for takeout 2 seats down. Very unprofessional. 

On a prior visit, I had my work shirt on. The cook asked for help with his phone. I helped fix it. He asked for my number if he has additional questions. .. ummm no. Go to your carrier and ask. ( I work for a phone manufacturer. ) 

Long story short. I don't really care about poor service for takeout pasta. Food is decent, but if I was the business owner... I'd be upset my guests were experiencing this.",a6zYLlLKQBwugqMNZidb8g,3,1,3,FPcKhUmIxrTKK-DngGoLEg

We've been back a few times to Mac Shack since that underwhelming first try, and each time we've been treated with extreme courtesy, and each time the food has been delicious. 

The protein and other chunky ""add-ons"" (like mushrooms) are now plentiful and easy to find in the bowl, unlike the first trip. The bread is hot, soft, and delicious - which I only know because it's free with a Yelp app check-in, along with a soda. I have to respect how savvy Mac Shack is to offer this to their (presumably) more opinionated customers. (And now my smartphone-less husband will be ordering his own on future visits and trying some of mine. Way to get us hooked!)

I also appreciate that the company offers a discount if you order a meatless dish on a Monday. As a vegetarian living in 2011 (as opposed to the less enlightened days of endless baked potatoes and cheese pizza), it boggles my mind that people still ask, ""But-but-but, what do you EAT?"" Mac Shack is challenging its value-minded meat-eating customers to get creative while saving some money. (With a bonus of rewarding vegetarians plus getting more people to save some resources, but - shhh - no preaching.)

Our return visits have been so satisfying that I'm tempted to give Mac Shack five stars. Only one thing - okay, two things - prevents this. First, and this is a total nitpick issue that I expect any sensible person to ignore, they've started selling really expensive (and not particularly impressive) cupcakes from a certain popular local bakery. Didn't I just mention that it's 2011? Why are they trying to jump on the Hipster Cupcake Wagon *now*? (And why with a subpar, overhyped product?)

The second thing, and this is the real reason I'm docking a star, is that you can't go half-n-half on the sauces at Mac Shack. If you want, say, alfredo and spicy red mixed together, you have to pay the full price for EACH sauce, even though you're only getting half of each. For a place that's all about designing your own pasta dish, this seems like a strange rule. (And one I don't encounter at live pasta stations at buffets, which work under a similar philosophy of choosing your own ingredients.) I'd understand if they were just trying to prevent a bad mix, but you *can* mix the sauces, you just have to pay twice as much. It's, like, a creativity tax, you could say. (Something you wouldn't expect from a place selling cupcakes topped in the emperor's new icing.)

But overall, I'm really pleased we gave Mac Shack another go. Solid fare, plenty of variety, and a pleasant, casual atmosphere.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,6,4,4,BQ7zJR72U5tUB7qphuhK3g

If you are interested in fresh ingredients (of your choosing), delicious flavor AND the benefits of eating off of echo friendly plateware..TRY THE MAC SHACK! 

It's a little out of the way but definitely worth the drive. From fresh veggies, to homemade sauces, the Mac Shack has taken the ""create your own entree"" to a whole new level. 

I created a traditional ""Kim"" style pasta dish with the following ingredients: 

Chicken, vodka sauce, mozzarella and ricotta cheese, rigatoni pasta, and..oooh I don't know sheer deliciousness! 

TRY IT, and if it sucks (in your opinion) you've created your own dish and it's all your fault for improper use of ingredient combinations ;)",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,3,1,5,0OC2VxbO80VubWZerbhB0g

My husband took me again a week ago and I ordered the same thing..The shrimp scampe.  This time there was less shrimp, it was way watered down and the lemon garlic flavor just wasnt there.

I normally abscond from heavy carb loading if I'm not competing in a tennis tournament, but, I have to say that I have the biggest weakness for Mac and cheese! Needless to say, I was excited to give this place a shot. With this said it was very difficult for me to keep my hunger pangs at bay, as soon as I entered the establishment! I'm met with the aroma of what I can only call...HEAVENLY...Based on my pleasant experience with the dashing and unusually handsome staff, this place served it up and boy do they know how to do it with quantity in those well proportioned bowls! (^_^) Portions placed on the side however, Mac Shack's  scrumptious menu selection offerings does fall a little more on the bland side. Maybe making their sauces cheesier or flavorful might help because based on what I had, the Philly mac and cheese, I often found myself wishing that I had stowed away some cheese slices from home before walking into mac shack and adding it inconspicuously to my bowl for more cheesy goodness. No one plans for these things and I could've easily asked for more sauce but I had an epiphany. AHA!!! I don't know if it's for health reasons, but perhaps adding less sauce gives you that option of ""having your cake and eating it too"". Overall, the Mac Shack manages to fulfill pasta cravings and then some. If you can look past the bland tastes and less cheesier iterations of your comfort food, you will certainly keep coming back for more of this guilty pleasure. But then again keep in mind that maybe they skimp out on over cheesing so as to offer comfort food in a way that doesn't make you the legendary lake mead beached walrus!",adu8EjLJ4UAVwZVHnXJzpA,0,0,4,fq7gXYiJ8sAYc8cOOLhC5w
2519247,2011-04-04,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"This concept is the wet dream of almost every girl I've ever known. A restaurant based around mac n cheese and pasta. (Plus they serve wine & beer.)

It's solid gold for a simple dinner date with a picky eater.

Basically the idea is that there are numerous varieties of pastas including several alternative diet choices such as farro, wheat and gluten free pastas, and in a variety of styles from linguine and angel hair to bow tie and wagon wheel.
You choose your pasta type then you choose from 8-10 different sauces, then you can add items to it such as meats, veggies, or cheese.

Then there's the Mac choices. They have several types of ""gourmet"" mac n cheese. My favorite is the pepper jack mac which is macaroni topped with monterey jack, pepper jack, and asiago cheeses and jalapenos.
The macs run from $6.95-$7.95 then I add Sausage ($1.50) and fresh tomatoes (.50c) and fresh spinach (.50c). 
My date ordered the fettuccine noodles with alfredo sauce ($7) then added a double order of shrimp ($1.75 x 2)....yea...so everybody else has said it so I'll say it too. An order of shrimp is 2 shrimp! They are by no means small, but if feel like 3 would be a little more substantial.

The portions for both the pastas and the mac's are filling for me and I have a big appetite. She could only finish half the pasta.
Our total was roughly $23 without drinks. 
So the main problem here being that the 2 of us can go to olive garden and get something comparable to the above mentioned and also get salad and breadsticks for the same price, and feel just as satisfied, OR during lunch I can go to Maggiano's and get pasta, but lunch portion and it will be far better and as filling for less. 

I like the inside, but it basically screams ""I'm a yuppy!"" and ""Please Franchise Me!"" There's more hot soccer mom's ignoring their kids than an episode of The Real Housewives. 
Although I have to say both myself and my date loved the 3 large Peter Lik prints on the wall, and the deck is a nice little break in the spring and fall because there is almost nowhere in the Southwest to dine outside. 

The Good:
If you have kids they will probably love it and they can find something to eat no matter what kind of insane diet you have them on.
Nice deck and dining area.
The Quality of the ingredients
The staff is very helpful and polite, and you can tell they truly want to answer any questions you have.

The not so Good:
Price
They are a perfect 7 for 7 on screwing up my order.(But to be fare I am throwing them a bit of a curve.)
Portions of add ons could be a little more. you have to add several items to get any additional substance.
If you don't have kids you still might end up sitting by a party of the little cheese covered lunatics.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,0,0,3,ubLC7ary3FMuBd_vFLftzQ

The food is decent, but not great.  The employees are well trained and seem to have had ""If you can lean, you can clean"" ingrained into them.

The one thing I definately don't like:  this is not BK ... and you can't have it your way.  The lunch special is a pretty good deal but when I specifically said I didn't want soup or salad I was told I HAD to take it.  What kind of restaurant forces you to take something you don't want?  I suggested another breadstick instead and was told no.   I guess they wanted to see a full bowl of soup (its 105* out .. I don't want soup) get thrown in the garbage instead.

I was told this is Franks rule.  I think that was the owners name ...

Food came out really quickly and hot. I ordered the broccoli pesto pasta and my boyfriend got the create your own pasta with bow tie pasta, fettuccine sauce, chicken and peas. The cool thing is, you can create your own pasta from a variety of pastas, add ons and sauce. The starting price is $7.95 and I think each additional add in is $1.99. Breadsticks aren't included but they are pretty crispy and delicious with a hit of garlic. Breadsticks are sold in a pair for $1.98.

Once I got the fork and tried my food, I was so disappointed with all of it. Got the Asiago Blue Mac, with port mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, chicken and caramelized onions. The cheese sauce tasted nothing like asiago or blue cheese. It was very bland and watery. Portion was small. The chicken was tough, the onions not caramelized and the mushrooms tasted old.

Located on the northwest corner of Warm Springs and Durango, it was easy to find. Mac Shack is actually located in the same strip mall as SkinnyFats, which is another place I have had bookmarked for a while.

For my first go round I ordered the Cheddar Mac ($7.75) and the Philly Cheese Mac ($9.95).  The portion sizes don't look like all that much, but they were actually quite filling. I guess my biggest complaint with this place is the consistency of the actual mac and cheese. It is very watery and almost feels like badly made blue box mac and cheese. I think of good mac and cheese, I think of thick, creamy, cheesy, gooey mac and cheese! What I got yesterday was nowhere close to that. After taxes, for almost $20 for 2 portions of mac and cheese, I better be impressed....and I just wasn't.

The place was very clean and service was fast and friendly, so certainly no complaints as far as all that goes.

Lucky we had an amazing cashier who let us try some the sauces just to give us a better idea of what we were getting. One of the sauces I tried was the pesto, which they had cold... So i was to imagine it warm.. I'm just gonna come back and try it. We decided to get the chicken alfredo and the cheddar mac sammich. Also while paying I realized I hadn't checked in yet. So, I checked in and received free bread sticks!! YUMM. We were gonna order a side anyways so it's nice that it was free. They gave us our numbers and we grab drinks and sat down. I was excited they have blue powerade. Most places just have the standar coke sprite and stuff. They have tables and chairs or booths. I wanted the booth side and made my friend take the chair side. HAHA, cushion for my butt!! After waiting maybe 10 minutes or so all of our food was out. I got right to it with a fork full of alfredo and chicken. The alfredo sauce was delicious, however I'm wasn't the hugest fan of the chicken slices. They were a little bland. I added some crushed peppers to spice it up, and we were back in action. We then move to the cheddar mac and cheese sammich. It was great. Nice toasted bread with cheddar mac.. Oh, ill be back for another round and hopefully soon. Cool part is when you clean your own plate you can grab a tootie pop at the door, mine are still sitting the in the car but it was a nice gesture. :)",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,8,8,4,uezAtXjYWvQ3hEoeOT9iMw

The staff is always exceptionally friendly and PATIENT...trying to make your own creation can take a second. 

The dining area is always clean even on their busiest days and I enjoy the ability of being able to watch them bring my creation to life.

I had the Crazy Alfredo. It had one jumbo shrimp, chicken, bell peppers, mushrooms and jalapenos. I opted to add roasted garlic for 50 cents more.

The kitchen is open for all to see whet the cook is doing.
My main gripe and the reason for only 3 stars is the cost to portion ratio. I could have eaten 2 meals but I really didn't want to take out a loan for it. The total bill for two people with two drinks was like 25 bucks. I never understood why pasta places charge so much for so little.

Walked into this place because I always saw it & wanted to try it & after so many visits to skinnyfats I wanted to add something else to try as well. 

It was lunch time & the parking lot was jammed pack! The inside of Mac Shack seems very spacious & lots of seats along with outside seating. The kitchen is open so you could see the cooks that are cooking your pasta & I always like open kitchens because you could see the cleanliness of the BOH where the food is being cooked. 

The resteraunt was EMPTY & the only people sitting down eating seemed to be the employees. I was greeted right away & they were waiting for me to place my order. It took me a minute but came to the decision & ended up ordering 2 dishes. You could also build your own pasta as well.

BAKED RIGATONI $8.75 - this was pretty good but a little bland on the marinara red sauce but eat it with the ricotta cheese backed on top & it is perfect goodness.

MAKE TRUFFLE MAC & CHZ $10.25 - it is mac & cheese created for the adult kid that still loves mac & cheese but they made it suffisticated by adding truffle with some crunchy breaded crumbs on top! Every bite was cheesy goodness.

I thought the portion amount was good for the price & it wasn't bad even taking it togo. They were fast & they came in a tin pasta container which kept it pretty hot till I got home.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,4,3,4,_OHEDGIvVw9bvUdMqg7kWw

3248199,2011-05-16,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"Several months ago, after our first visit to Mac Shack, I wasn't sure how to write a review. The food was OK, but I suspected some of the issues I had were more to do with me ordering poorly for my tastes as well as being the result of some miscommunications as a result of differing accents.

We've just returned from our third go at Mac Shack and I think I've got my order ""down"" enough to write a review and decide I really do like the place.  I think it's neat the way you can customise your own pasta dishes, as well as order from a set list of creations. It's sort of like Cold Stone Creamery meets The Olive Garden. The bread sticks are fresh and tasty and the restaurant is really low pressure without feeling like something you'd find in a food court.  Something else I appreciated greatly was the absence of loud, blasting music, that has become a fact of life in so many dining establishments - here it's pleasantly muted.

One think I feel could really improve the options here would be the ability to mix sauces. I like the roasted pepper sauce, particularly as I enjoy a creamy sauce, but it's a little bland and mixing it with a dash of the spicy read sauce would really make it a winner for me - alas, you can't mix sauces without paying the full price for a second sauce, even though you'd only be using half as much of each. This seems a bit silly to me.

Overall, the food here is very good for the price. I love the casual atmosphere and the options. A little more ability to configure my dishes to my own taste would really make this a winner.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,0,0,4,QFhyGjBB9jLVl9Jl28pTIA

As other reviews have stated, its solid as a ""Chipotle for Pasta"" type experience, but its nothing to write home about.  They do continue to stiff you on whatever protein you order with your pasta.  Don't expect any more than two pieces of chicken, shrimp, etc. when you order.  But those complaints have never been enough to keep me from going.  

Here's what is...

Robert, I don't know if you're the manager or owner or just a shift manager or something but your customer service is awful.  Awful enough to make me write a Yelp review.  You are aloof and rude every single time I've had the displeasure of dealing with you.  You have screwed up my order on three separate occasions.  I come in for to-go orders on a regular basis.  On one evening you stood next to the girl on the register while the line continued to build.  Having food management experience myself, I assumed you were training her.  But after a 15 minute wait, I finally got to the front of the line and it became clear that no, this was an experienced employee and you were just...well, what exactly WERE you doing?  You then decided to inform me that I ""should know better"" that I don't have to wait for to-go orders.  Here's an idea, get on the other register and get the line moving faster and it wouldn't have mattered.  Today, I came in around noon with no one in front of me, but I had to wait for you to finish your conversation with a staff member before I was greeted and allowed to place my order; an order that I discovered you ONCE AGAIN screwed up because you were clearly more interested in whatever your conversation was than giving me, the customer, your attention.  

The food and the environment were good enough, not great, but good enough to make me a regular in the past, but I think my days of visiting the Mac Shack are over thanks to one employee.  So thank you Robert.

Update:  After writing the above review I was contact by both Robert and one of the owners.  They apologized for the poor service and expressed a desire to do better if I gave them another chance.  

I appreciated their effort and their desire to make things right.  I do not know if I'll ever be in a mood to visit the Mac Shack again, but if I do and their service standards change, I will update the review again.",rGtV1OpILsrYtHFWmUM7BQ,6,0,1,vekIAhoNbKT2WeZSu36xUw

The boy got one of their suggested pasta mixtures with a cream sauce and he enjoyed it alot.  I think I had a penne with their red pepper sauce, spinach and sausage.  The ingredients are always fresh and service is quick.  We came when they were about to shut down and made us feel welcome to get a to go order.  The one criticism I had about flavors was my red pepper sauce was really a cream sauce with a light red pepper flavor.  I definitely wish it had been a little heavier on the red pepper.  

I will say that after my last review I received a long letter from the owner saying he had tried the pasta I had and realized I was right and fixed the problem with the pesto.  I have extreme respect for owners who care so much about their business that they are willing to actually listen to reviews.  You would be amazed how rare this is.

Not sure if they changed management or ownership but the last few months it has really been disappointing. 

I was a huge fan of their vodka sauce. Well it does not taste the same. It appears they changed their product.  

I also don't like how there portions are inconsistent. One day it's a lot of pasta and on other days its a small portion.

Such a great concept. a quick order restaurant with everything pasta has to offer. I always get the build your own with angel hair, vodka sauce, spinach, basil, sun dried tomatoes, shrimp/or chicken. It is absolutely delish! 
My brother got the Mac & Cheese with cut up hot dogs and ruffles potato chips in it. Sounds odd but its surprisingly amazing. 
They have an awesome selection of different pastas such as bow tie, rigatoni, and fettuccine. Also an array of toppings. Oh yea and you cant forget their side salad, it has a great house dressing.
Mac Shack also has the cutest decor and an amazing staff. Very friendly. Only bad experience Ive ever had is with a heavy accented manager. He was very rude and unaccommodating when the wrong order showed up via delivery.

3459556,2011-06-30,2,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"It's an interesting concept. Pastas with your choice of toppings. And for the less creative or lazy soul, they've concocted some creations for you. The prices are not too steep....$8-$10 should get you a large portion with decent mix-ins and they give you a 20% discount for Meatless Mondays. Quite progressive for Las Vegas if I should say so. There is also ""Baby Bowls"" catered towards children but really, there's more than enough pasta in one for a full-grown human. 

The pasta dishes I've had really haven't blown me away. I can make better pasta at home. With fresher ingredients. BUT....sometimes out of sheer lethargy and a massive carb craving, Mac Shack will do the trick. If I didn't work close to this restaurant I probably wouldn't bother with it. 

Summary: Palatable pastas, not-so-fresh ingredients, bordering on stinginess on quantities of toppings and decent service.

It's doable but do I really want to ""settle"" so often?",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,3,2,3,I3myWnYJDl6z_vsOgaEjFg

I went in with two friends for lunch and the place already seemed busy which is a good sign. The staff was very friendly and eager to explain the concept which is a pleasant surprise for fast food. I agree with Misti that it seems like a Chiptole style fast food joint that serves pasta.

The funny part about my order was that I stole it from one of the pre-made ""Mac favorites"" and saved myself a quarter. I got penne with the broccoli pesto and roasted garlic. My friends both ordered overloaded pasta with lots of toppings but both settled on more traditional sauces. Their dishes were both delicious but I ended up not enjoying my dish as much as I had hoped. The flavor was incredible but my pasta looked to be swimming. It appears the chef didn't realize I ordered pasta and not soup. If they had toned down the amount of sauce or added more pasta I think the result would've been a 4 star lunch.

Like I mentioned above the jury is still out on this place until I can try a lot more combos. The fact that I enjoyed 2 out of 3 dishes and the 3rd could be saved with a bit of tweaking makes me think I'll be visiting this place semi-frequently. I'm glad I pestered my friends until they accompanied me. Hopefully I'll be able to bump the rating to 4 stars on my next visit. Mmm....Alfredo!",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,1,0,3,J6QpoI2oiRxtu9h4pzJVsg

For a Saturday night, the business was quite slow.  I didn't have to wait to order and the food was made fresh within 5-10 mins. This time I think the portion size was very generous.  We got the normal sized pasta, but for $3 more you get the larger size with quite a bit more pasta and sauce.  I really like the concept of pick your pasta and sauce and picking what other toppings to mixed with pasta.  We ordered the linguini meat sauce with zucchini and mushrooms and also the broccoli pesto penne with chicken.  Both dishes didn't have enough sauce, so the pasta was on the dry side.  There was however plenty of meat in the meat sauce.  The flavour of both dishes also needs some improvement.  This place is okay, for a quick pasta fix when you don't feel like cooking.

3505118,2015-04-16,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"After three visits, I'm confident in recommending this place. The selection is great. There are a couple dozen dishes with several side options. If you're creative, you have the option of creating your own dish. Choose your pasta type, choose you're sauce, and then choose all the other goodies you want to add and create your, one of a kind, pasta creation. 
My average cost for my meals, including two main dishes, one side, and two drinks (not wine) was about $25. A little on the high side for pasta, but worth it for the quality. 
I did notice many business type adults with young children. I guess being able to get a great tasting pasta dish and still allow your child to get their Mac-n-Cheese is pretty appealing. 
My only reasons for a 4 star instead of a 5:
1. All three times, my breadsticks were hard and stale. 
2. Most employees were very nice and professional. A few (female) were less than pleasant. 
3. The climate was that of the Nordic. It was SO cold. We asked an employee about it and he said only the manager had the ""code"" to change the temperature. Bring a coat.

3652388,2015-09-11,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"I probably would have eaten here months ago if I hadn't assumed it was an unauthorized Apple retailer. Silly me, I guess.  But uninspired name aside, I thought this place was pretty good.

You get a sense of the hip, bistro vibe a lot of places go for these days, with the walls reminding you in giant letters that their food is locally sourced and sustainable. The crew was all young, but friendly enough and seemed to know what they were doing. 

The menu was large, but I think the macaroni dishes were too few and simple for a place with Mac in the title, but that may not be such a bad thing. There were also traditional Italian pasta selections, as well as some interesting creations that seemed worth trying out.

The create-your-own pasta feature is a great idea but it seems kinda broken. It's 7.25 for your choice of pasta and sauce to start, 1.95 for a meat choice, and .65 for each additional toppings (from a list of enticing toppings of which you will want many). By the time you've set up a basic dish with only one meat and one topping it's an almost $10 pasta. Meanwhile, the most expensive plates on the menu, with multiple meats and toppings included are only around $11.  This is all a long way of saying that it's a much better value just to pick regular menu item and substitute any toppings you don't like for ones you do.

I got the crazy Alfredo (10.50) : fettuccini pasta with chicken breast, shrimp, Italian sausage, roasted peppers, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and jalape√±os.  The sauce was a little light on flavor and the shrimp were small and not the best quality, but the dish was very large, the ingredients fresh, and overall, quite enjoyable. For the price, I can definitely recommend it.

My wife got pepper jack Mac and cheese and added bacon. I was kind of jealous. It was a generous portion of elbow pasta, cheese, jalape√±os, and flavorful bacon. I will probably stick to their Mac dishes from now on.

Mac Shack is a great place if you feel like eating Italian food, but don't want to spend a lot of money or tip. They have a diverse menu that should offer something for everyone, and service is quick.

One great part of their menu was that their mac and cheese. It was pretty delish. Cheesy and crispy (from the baked topping). 
I wish wish WISH they served garlic bread/toast/something with the pasta. Instead was some sweet roll. WEIRD.

Other than the menu, the ambiance was nice. Pretty classy with great panoramic pictures of farms (ala wheat ala pasta).

He was also very funny and helped my mom come up with a choice (in the end she went with the kids meal which was the mac and meatball even though she cooked us spaghetti the night before) I would suggest the shrimp scampi which is my favorite! Enough shrimp and just right scamp in scampi! If you love cheese try the asiago blue Mac. It's loaded with cheese! It has asiago blue cheese, Romano, and blue cheese crumbles on top. I had it with chicken which Balances the meal with the cheeses. It's not too tangy or thick in texture to make you feel easily filled. I had that smokehouse BBQ one also and the pesto one. Those are just as good too! Definitely have to try the BBQ at least once. It's life changing.

The decor is fabulous and especially since they feature Peter lik artwork! So the artwork changes it's time of day depending on the lighting!!!

The Mac N Cheese was still cheesy good but the Angel Hair pasta with veggies and pesto sauce was lacking flavor alot- I mean like no flavor at all..
When I told the waitress she just suggested that I add salt- Ugh, I don't pay at a restrauant to flavor my food- The waitress then asked me to get up and talk to the chef - so even though I thought the Chef should come to me - I went to him and he was willing to add some cream and salt - After the fact my pasta was still OK - I just remember really liking it before on a previous visit....

The BF's Spicy Red Sauce with Penne Pasta was OK once we got an extra side of sauce cause initially the pasta was pretty dry.

The salad and the garlic bread were pretty standard - nothing special.
I still like the inside of this place- always clean and the free tootsie roll lollipops are cute. The wall decor is enjoyable to look at and the Mac Shack sign on  the wall is Very Veags.... 

Funny thing about the free tootsie roll lollipops - I suggested to my daughter to take a picture of the tootsie rolls to post on her instagram cause it was cute and colorful. Well, as we were taking the picture the guy behind the counter yelled "" Don't steal my idea""  WTF was that about???

Well, it says you get a fruit roll-up on the menu. But I have yet to receive one with my meal. I believe it's meant for children, but dammit it says it's included.

I didn't say anything in an attempt to bluff her, she turned around and walked away with my fruit rollup. WHY!??!!

4632053,2011-05-30,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"Last visit I was in a hurry to get home and was not in the mood to make something myself. I was trying to maintain a gluten free diet at the time and read online they had a gluten free pasta. Could be good I thought.

Just because a restaurant, especially a chain restaurant, offers a gluten free selection does not mean anyone on the staff knows a thing about gluten sensitivity. Such was the case on this visit. 

I put in my order and requested the gluten free pasta for my mac and cheese order. I was immediately asked if I wanted the (gluten laden) garlic bread with that. You can imagine the stunned look I had. The guy said ""I guess not"" and we wisely moved on. 

While waiting I was able to watch as they went into the back to retrieve the pre-cooked gluten free pasta from the fridge. Okay so far. Then proceeded to put the pasta in the same reheating water they had spent all day reheating wheat pasta in; water so cloudy from wheat pasta, even across the counter some 15 feet away I could see it. My gluten free pasta was now being drenched in gluten. 

Now I am only slightly sensitive to gluten, and ate it for decades in fact unaware, but I was really disappointed for anyone who was affected by coeliac disease and had a loved one who innocently brought home what they thought was a meal for their loved one ""gluten free"".

Now as to the food itself: The mac and cheese is nothing spectacular. To get that really cheesy taste we Americans have come to expect will never be found here. 

You need to lay that cheese on in tremendous amounts, and with the minor, measured amounts used by this chain, do not expect more than the merest hint of cheese taste (yes, even with blue cheese) with the mostly bland pasta. This is most likely due to their being averse to using salt in any quantity either in the making of their pasta, the cooking of the same pasta, or in the cheese sauce to cover the pasta. 

This is a prime reason why mac and cheese is not to be considered a healthy staple, and much more of an occasional sinful indulgence like full fat ice cream. As such, this restaurant should NOT be afraid to ""do it up right"" and go for the gusto. Too bad this will never be the case.",8s3TOsVG2zBbvxn6_06jaw,1,0,2,5mIH240vhofMhFYCfPP6MA

Before going to any restaurant,  I ""Yelp"" it  and also look up the restaurant website.  Because of their connection with Nora's Cuisine on Jones/Flamingo, we decided to give Mac Shack a try.
You order at the counter, take a number, get your own drink and sit at a table.  All the tables were not cleaned or wiped or they had the last patron's empty cups still sitting on the table.  We took the table with the empty cups, (there goes a star)
We ordered a Caesar's Salad to share with their homemade dressing.  The romaine lettuce insides were mostly used, (not the leafy middle sections), croutons were not crispy at all and the dressing was too mayonaisey...(bye bye to a star and a half...)  The roll was very good but no butter...
Hubby ordered the lasagna which was just okay...he didn't finish it... Hubby says, it's kind of mall  Food court food or fast food....(tata to another star and a half..)  His iced tea was very good.
Now...on the other hand, my veggie pasta plus garlic was very good - pasta was not overcooked and the veggies were yummy! (brought a star back)
This was an okay place....hubby won't come back but I most likely will for carbo loading before my cycling or tri events.  In fact, they should advertise it to the sporting events around town.
They had some empty walls that should be used for at least 4 flat screens.  One guy looked so bored sitting there.
If we ordered the ""make your own"", dishes,  I don't know if the price would have been more expensive.  If it was, then it's probably over priced.
Customer service was so so....they didn't notice the empty cups until we told them to clear it off.

Cheddar Mac ($5.95) Wisconsin cheddar, aged white cheddar, and monterey jack cheese once again in a creamy sauce over GF pasta. This was great too!

5016502,2011-04-28,0,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"When a friend of ours finally revealed to us that Mac Shack was not a trendy place to have creepy computer networking parties while enjoying overpriced coffee, my wife and I decided that a mac and cheese based restaurant sounded cool. After we discovered that Mac Shack was being brought to us by the genius culinary artists of Nora's, we couldn't wait to try it out. Spoiler alert...this place makes food that Nora was making in an Easy Bake Oven 45 years ago, and I recommend that if you want a similar quality of food for over half the price, go up the street to Fazoli's. 
 
So, my first indication that Mac Shack was a terrible experience was the typo on the door sign. If you are going to throw obscene amounts of money into your pursuit of being the next Chipotle, learn how to use apostrophes (i.e. ""pasta's).

The menu was put together nicely. I was a little weirded out by the TV on the side showing off-menu items and specials. It felt a little too-cool-for-school to use a TV to show off specials, but maybe I am old school in that way. I like the blackboard and chalk approach way more. Anyhow, we settled on some tasty sounding menu items. I ordered the Pepper Jack Mac, my wife got the Red Rigatoni, and we ordered the Baby Mac and Cheese for our son. We also ordered a house side salad, a Caesar side salad, and bread sticks. I kind of freaked out when our bill was 40 dollars. Were we at Nora's or a place called Mac Shack? We should have gone to Nora's. 

The food took a while to come out, but it wasn't too bad of a wait. The food came, and it was hot enough to fry an egg on top of our pastas. Literally, steam was racing off the top of my son's ""Baby Mac and Cheese."" He waited 20 minutes to eat. This is always a pleasant experience with a 3-year-old who loves mac and cheese.

So we ate bread sticks and salad. I think the bread they serve here may come from a bag. They were chewy and the crust wasn't crispy, warm, or buttery. If they are homemade, I am solidifying my theory that they are using easybake ovens in the kitchen. 

The house salad was really good. I can say that the best thing we had was the garden salad. Dressing was good and the greens were fresh and interesting. The Caesar was really bad. The dressing tasted like i was shoving anchovy paste in my mouth. It was too much fish. It could work in some restaurants, but really not a good idea for Chipotle gone pasta. 

Once the food cooled down, it was very boring. By the end of the meal, we were thinking how we could make all this at home for a quarter of the price. We discovered that this place makes a great meatball (The meatball and house salad are the only reason I would rate this place two stars), but everything else was just mediocre. The serving sizes don't jive with the prices, and they were not exciting presentations. The Pepper Jack Mac comes with ""fried jalepenos"" but when it came, it had 3 razor thin slices of raw jalepenos. Not very exciting. The red rigatoni was saved by the meatball, but everything else about it was sad. The sauce was bland, the chicken sausage had little flavor and the pasta was overcooked. My son's pasta was a step up from Kraft. Except I would never bring pasta that hot to a kid. 

At the end of the meal, my son had a Fruit Roll-Up to look forward to. I am just thinking here....and if I were developing a cool, trendy pasta place with innovative and exciting dishes that I was trying to market to foodies....I would probably serve kids meals with Fruit Roll-Ups. This was the perfect end to a perfectly disastrous meal. I don't like giving my kid Fruit Roll-ups, and I have to wonder about a restaurant that does. McDonalds even has fresh fruit these days. But they could have even done a cookie or ice cream. Why on earth would they serve something that you could buy prepackaged at Smiths? 

In closing, this place has all of their attention focused on making this a franchise-worthy experiment. But you cannot be the next Chipotle when you have ordinary food. I don't even think they should try to be the next Chipotle, but it is clear that is their main goal with Mac Shack. In the end, I don't even think the first restaurant will succeed if they cannot figure out how to make better food at a more appropriate price. But based on some of the yuppies giving this place 5 stars, maybe I have no idea what good food is. 

Next time we are looking for good ""pasta's"" we will not dine at Mac Shack. Hopefully nobody that reads this review will make the same mistake we did.",pgDM0E9HCId1X_i3jwUylw,2,0,2,eXyW6zK8ppf7XuwtGAbaHA

Basically, it's a quick order place for pasta that have specialties or you make your own. It's an answer to Chipotle for pasta. 

The BF and I shared - 

FarmHouse - this was OK. I liked the sauce, but I could have honestly done without the toppings as the ham was salty for me and the peas were fine. There was no egg, though it says on the menu there is. 

Bottle service - I liked their vodka sauce and mushrooms, but it was skimpy on beef. It didn't really need it. 

Portions I think were good as we were both pretty full sharing and had a few bites we couldn't finish. 

I did a checkin for a free order of breadsticks (2pc). It was standard, but good. 

It seems the way to go here really is meat free. I feel like once the meat is added its slightly much for order up food and it didn't really add much to the dish. I will make my own and stick to veggies. They do a pretty decent lunch special for $6.99, but I did not catch the timeframe it runs and if it is daily. 

I will probably be back, but it's not a spot I would be running back to. For a quick bite though, I would definitely order something with the vodka sauce again.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,4,3,0HHPiFOJqGRsJ0XSFDlxtQ

I love pasta so much, and this spot totally caters to all my pasta needs. There are a few options on what to order here. You can choose a dish that is already put together from the menu, pasta-less items, or you can make your own pasta! I decided to go with the make your own pasta option because I felt like having some fun that day.

I decided to order the wagon wheel pasta with a spicy red sauce topped with olives, onions, and basil. All together my order remained under $10, and I received a free breadstick and drink just for checking in on yelp for my very first time! I shared the pasta with my boyfriend, and we were still pretty full! The spicy red sauce wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but it still had a little kick. The basil was chopped into small pieces and complemented the sauce nicely. 

Overall, I would have to say the pasta here is pretty good, but it isn't the most amazing pasta I have had in my life (sadly I'm still searching for that..). Would I come here again? Yeah probably.

*Atmosphere: Cute, clean, fresh. I would liken it to Create (atmosphere-wise).
*Cost: 2 pasta dishes + 2 drinks set us back $18 with tax . I feel like this isn't a bad value, others may disagree.
*They have COKE ZERO. Hell yes. My favorite soft drink EVER
*They don't have rotini. WTF they have 3 types of tube pasta and even wagon wheels but no F-ing spiral pasta. Disappointed by that as a spiral pasta fan. 
*Service was fine. They forgot to put our rolls on the plate at first, but when I complained and made a sad face rolls were brought out immediately. They were delicious and worth complaining for, btw
*Those that complain about the portion sizes are a bit too gluttonous. Sorry, it had to be said. These portions are more than enough for any reasonable sized appetite. My husband and I came VERY hungry and only finished about 3/4 of our food.

So onto the food!

*Cheddar Mac and cheese with sirloin added. So I MUCH prefer baked mac and cheeses but I can understand why a sauce based approach would have to be used at this sort of establishment. The sirloin wasn't chopped up as much as we liked either (we asked them to cut it up for us). That being said it was quite delicious! Just not ""best mac and cheese in las vegas"" material. 

*The Farm. Ordered as described on menu (ham, proscuitto, peas, bowtie pasta, egg, white sauce). YUM! It was a cabonera inspired masterpiece and something that we will be ordering every time. SO freaking good and I did prefer this to the mac and cheese. 

Bottom line: If you're searching for the best mac and cheese in Vegas, look elsewhere. If you're searching for an affordable pasta joint with tons of options this place is perfect.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,4,3,4,ZfA9BW_WvPn1C8Cw5NnfLg
5237198,2010-04-10,2,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"Protein portion size is a deal-breaker for me.

Just got takeout for lunch. Ordered a Spinach Salad with add-on shrimp. Discovered the policy for an add-on protein is ONE LARGE SHRIMP. Very disappointed. The manager told me their shrimp costs about $1.10 each. EACH. (That seems to be pretty high-priced shrimp, especially for a one-dollar-sign restaurant on Yelp.) The manager offered, if i returned, to ""give me another shrimp"", as that, evidently, is a non-add-on portion of shrimp. Still disappointed.

The manager was nice, the service was pleasant, the food was fairly good and quick. (I found the shrimp to be nicely cooked, a little under-seasoned. The spinach salad was nothing to write home about, and the balsamic vinaigrette was not very punchy. My fiance loved his baked wheat pasta with meat sauce, which was well-seasoned and rich) 

More info from the manager. Add-on portion of chicken is 3 oz (6 for entree). Add-on for meatballs is 2 balls. So I guess when you order the create-you-own pasta dish, you get less protein than when you order one of their ""classics"".

Being a new restaurant, I was told ""they are still working out the kinks"". Well, this is a HUGE kink for me, and I imagine it will be a kink for others. I hope that the policy changes, because the food is good, and I wish the company success (I would love to have quick/cheap Nora's around the corner when I want pasta!)

UPDATE: I also went to their website and submitted a complaint. I received an email the same day from the founder/owner saying ""Thank you so much for your interest in us and I assure you the shrimp policy will be changed first thing in the morning!! I'm sure you know that this was only our second day being open, and we are trying really hard to offer a top quality quick serve pasta concept.""

So they get another star from me, for being cool and understanding. I WILL go back now to see if that really happened, and if so, then they may get another star!

My roomie was craving mac & cheese and we stumbled across the Mac Shack. She ordered the Philly mac & cheese. It definitely smelled like a Philly steak. She liked it but said she would have made it better herself. 

That's how I felt about my mac and cheddar cheese. It wasn't terrible, but my mom's mac and cheese would bury this one. This struck me as cooked pasta with grated cheddar, placed in an oven and lightly seasoned (if at all). I prefer more of a cheese sauce that coats all of the pasta rather than grated pieces that clump together.

I tried the meatballs (shame on me!). You get two medium-large meatballs with sauce. I really liked the tomato sauce! It tasted as if it had been cooked down over time, which allowed for a more intense flavor.

IMO there's a lack of places to grab a quick bite to eat in the SW area by Rhodes Ranch. I don't do fast food so that limits the scope. 

I always get the 'Bottle Service' which is pasta in a vodka cream sauce with grilled steak, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. I would give this dish 3 stars alone but the other items I've tried are 2 stars or lower. Baked ziti is meh and their alfredo has so much stuff in it, it takes away from the dish. I want to say it has chicken, shrimp, sausage and about 3 other veggies mixed with a very watery alfredo. Dishes have also been pretty inconsistent and I've only gone a few times here.

On the plus side, their prices are reasonable and decent portions enough for a 2nd meal. I like that they carry The Cupcakery cupcakes if you're hankering for a nice dessert and the complimentary lollipops are a nice touch for the kiddos. And the place is always super clean and inviting.",Tw3_-eahwaTZJjEsos1gpg,0,0,3,gnAe7G0CAyrdeQrMqbyxYQ

You got me mackin' over some pasta =) If you're a pasta lover like myself, you will appreciate this place. I love that it's located right around the corner from my place.

Anyways, my review will be based solely on my to-go experience and the shrimp scampi I ordered. I am not one to discriminate against pastas; I love and adore all equally, but have recently grown an obsession for shrimp scampi. I've made it myself before, but on days when I want pasta and don't feel like putting the minimum effort in cooking I will invest in to-go pasta. I truly believe the shrimp scampi is for pasta lovers that do NOT like creamy pasta sauces. The wine sauce is a good amount for this dish and they are giving with the shrimp and pasta. I must say that the garlic bread isn't that great which can explain the 4 stars. It just wasn't ""garlic-y"" enough and not soft enough for my liking.

The place itself is very spacious and has a warm light to it. The cashier counter have a nice display of ""fake"" pasta and dishes they make. I enjoyed the staff as well since they were very friendly. 

I will be back to a dine-in experience, so my review will be updated.. HOWEVER, for now I say I am a Mac Shack fan!",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,1,0,4,RMrk3dMPwPPpbYsSAHAs9A

It was a busy Friday but the line moved quickly and the smell was incredible. My friend described it pretty accurately as a pasta version of chipotle - just meaning that its quick, reasonable and customizable. 
I decided on a special made up of mac and cheese made w Gouda, big pieces of bacon, a touch of tangy bbq sauce and I added chicken. I was a little hesitant about the bbq sauce but it was just like a bbq chicken pizza but in pasta form! Can't go wrong with that. 
It was a huge portion for about $10 and they have a lot of great options to customize your pasta. Its not really a full service restaurant - you take a number and they bring your food when it's ready. Because of that, I was surprised that they had very good service. The manager (who was also the one who took my order) walked around making sure everyone was happy with their food. He brought me a to go box, cleared our dishes promptly. 
Mac shack was a winning combo of good food, low prices and unexpectedly great customer service.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,5,DsofOJbneB-nljAN_vT_rg
5783153,2010-04-16,1,YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ,"Lets be honest with a name like Mac Shack is there anyway this place this could live up to our overblown childhood expectations gone amok? To define Mac Shack, its a new and extremely well done pasta driven italian style restaurant.  I won't call it fast food but, from the time I ordered the food it was on my table within a few minutes and I was in and out of the place in about 45 min.

The menu varies from their combinations of food or you can get very adventurous and create your own meal.  When ordering there is a glass case with all the optional items for you to see and drool over.  The place even has descent selection of wine and beer.

I ordered the asiago-blue mac and cheese and it was delicious.  You could taste the real cheese in every bite and the pasta was slightly al dente like I prefer. I went with a friend and he had the ""farm house"" which he described as tasty and well rounded.  I snuck a bite and will be ordering it next time.  

I highly recommend this place just keep the inner child at bay, as its impossible to keep that little bugger happy!",MjA21jK_XRHJvMjtvvnxow,1,1,4,O4khVSEpTQr3lCGz8qsH6w

When he saw my review he personal stepped up to make things right. and that is service. it is nice to see an owner care about his customers. he even came to my home to aplogize and gave me a gift card to come back and try them again and I sooo will. I love the food there and I now can say the service is way better too. thank you Frank.

One girl sitting on the counter, another gentleman talking to her, and the second gentleman that actually acknowledged us when we came in and took our order. We ordered, got our drinks and went to look for a table. There were 5 tables that still had dishes and trash sitting on them and a few more that the tops were dirty. The floor was dirty too. You would think since the people at the front had time to sit around and talk they could've cleaned their dining room. Not to appealing to sit around a bunch of dirty tables. The woman that brought our food finally came and cleaned all of it. The food was good and I would go back for take out but dine in probably not. Unless they pay better attention to the dining room and actually greet your customers with happy joyful attitudes.

Found out that they also offer ""kids eat free"" on Sundays, so we will definately be headed to the ""Shack"" again soon!!  I felt that the prices were reasonable for the portion sizes.  Definately a better option than fast food if you aren't looking to spend $50 for a meal.  Our total was $30 for 4 meals and 4 drinks, not bad and about the same price as Schlotzsky's, Jersey Mikes, Rubios, Smash Burger or Baja Fresh- which are all better than ""standard"" fast food joints.

I ordered their philly cheese steak bowl and it had alright flavor and was a healthy portion size but didn't have enough meat or vegetables to really be considered a ""philly"" The Daughter ordered the crazy Alfredo and all I could get her to say about it was ""it tastes alright but its nothing special""

I guess that is really the best line to sum up our entire experience. It tastes alright but its nothing special. Not sure what I was expecting but I wanted some cheesy, gooey, max and cheese that would bind me up for a few days.
