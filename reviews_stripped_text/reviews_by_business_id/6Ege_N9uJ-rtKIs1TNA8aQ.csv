972077,2015-12-03,1,6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ,The worst place I have been. The food was okay.. getting jumped outside hit with a crowbar was the worst part. Not one person inside would help they gave me a phone that was not working to call the police. The mother of one guy works inside is why they didn't help I will be suing I do not recommend going to this jack in the box.,-LdgrLq7ObdBvo0EMPIFug,1,0,1,8z5JWnWcfJw5DQ3GgzC58w

Unfortunately, I was looking for quick food, and It took more than ten minutes to get my meal even though there was no one else in line. 

When I got it, the fries were hot, but the sandwich was stale and crusty. Must have been waiting on the fries, I guess. 

Two stars for being reasonably  clean and friendly.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,1,2,m6DHVmYhj7kpox6ey5lk_w

I live around the corner from this location so I have given it a try a few different times. On 2/3 occasions I was missing something. The final time I only ordered a strawberry shake and it literally took 13 mins. 

Now I drive to the one on sunset behind the sunset station.",ANDPTpXhzmz5TKnuoNLLFQ,1,0,1,vQOZNRCOovbJUGgsMElaDg

I order Jumbo Jack without lettuce and received one with lettuce I could see the female putting hamburger together was mad she make Six burgers before she make mine like I order it.

2518426,2013-01-11,0,6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ,"Maybe because it was NYE but workers were friendly. It's connected to a convenience store that also has a few slots and a gas station too. There's a lot of cars going in and out of the parking lot.

In general I think Jack In The Box is decent but this location was slightly disappointing because the fries were not warm and soft when I received it...they were room temperature and kind of crunchy.",HiYPfYJD4VN_jvXwxs6H8w,0,0,3,MCMJdYpMv1_udQRmm35LAA

That's why I'm putting him on blast. No one answered the phone for two hours after I left so I turned to yelp. Either do things ethically or don't and pay the dues. That's how it works. If Miguel or whatever his name is doesn't want to play the game then I'm gonna tell the manager that he's cheating his numbers. The food was exceptionally bad plus I backed my car up so it looked like he was doing a good job timing wise. He did a poor job. That's it. 

This was at 2am 6/8/14.",z-NR0CFGz6XiO3ajwUNGAw,0,0,1,4U5D0Fu47hJ3z0-AFsq47w
2883123,2017-08-27,0,6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ,"Brisa and Maria are by far the best managers they have on staff at this location. (I have yet to meet the GM) When they are on duty, their team is constantly working and performing tasks when they have downtime. They run a tight ship and I couldn't be more thankful for that. The entire staff is great and 100% helpful and very attentive. 

I wish I could give this location and staff 10 stars for their performance they give us every single time we are inside this specific location. We have the opportunity to go to quite a few different locations, but because of the friendliness of the staff and the way the food is always on point (not to mention, they keep the restaurant CLEAN AT ALL TIMES), we keep coming back to this one and will continue to do so. 

Thank you to everyone on staff for all of your hard work and dedication, you deserve to be noticed for this. I hope my review will get you guys a little closer to being noticed by upper management. See you all soon!

Ruby, valetine, and whoever makes the food in the kitchen is great. I see bad reviews on here but maybe because im there for lunch the night crew is different? The location is in a bad area but that should reflect the store itself because they do a great job. The employees are friendly and the food is good.",CfLm-3UhQAbgkp8jQNvpjQ,0,0,5,MtMIXIHqdooYshrntocIDA
4186728,2015-09-12,2,6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ,"Ok, we came here just because we had a 2 for $5 coupon for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. It looked tempting. 

We picked it up in the drive-thru along with some curly fries. Cannot pass up curly fries since they are hard to come by. Jesus took our order and helped us at the window. Very professional and polite. 

Got home and the food was super hot, and looked great. So many times you order fast food, only to bring it home and it looks nothing like the photos they advertise. Not this time. Lettuce and tomatoes looked great. Big piece of breaded, spicy chicken. As for spicy, it was fairly mild. I added their buttermilk ranch dressing, and it was great. Curly fries were hot, crunchy and wonderful. 

Awesome!",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,1,2,4,87DfcSKcjbCr-qYaHhGNAw
4450792,2016-03-21,0,6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ,Horrible service. There was a hair in my food and all the manager said was it was probably from people at my table cause of the wind. Right cause there is wind inside.  Never again.,FK5S8auKhTnc0znGE5_f6w,0,0,1,H6UrjhtOgRn25NmhSNWn6Q
4879103,2017-10-06,0,6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ,"So this is a chain in a gas station location.

Taking that into consideration the service was decent and the place smelled freshly mopped, with bleach.

Got the sausage breakfast burrito and it left me sad and wantingso much more in the flavour department.

They need to bring back the bacon jalape√±o burrito.

Very clean for a Jack in the Box though and the counter person was nice and actually didn't cut me off to take the drive through order, which really ticks me off. they deserve half a star more for that :)",MopyJvrcBSgQYfyA4wyP7w,0,0,3,Zwn25XVafyR5nj8cXGt2Hg

Oh and then you call them to fix it and they don't pickup the phone.  Their excuse is the company hasn't bought them a new $9 phone.
