1168553,2015-09-01,0,JJzAOl3kQLfhOzB_vjf3FQ,"I've been looking for Chinese crepes ??????for a long time in the states and this is the first place that has it. The sauce is light so make sure to ask for extra. 

Tofu Jelly is also impressively authentic, another fantastic offering in addition to the Taiwanese breakfast fares offered in Las Vegas. Wait is a little slow as I get the sense that the wait staff is still getting used to everything, but are very polite. 

I had a great experience here.",oA0vRJAzSOyy1c7f-xTEaA,1,0,5,cdc3jTDTKOLscDCqUP69Vg

The owner gave my group plum juice to try. It's very mild but totally refreshing. It's not very sweet and it's like a fruity version of the house tea in most Chinese restaurants. 

The free appetizer is excellent! I've never had shredded potatoes before! It seems like it was raw potato in a sesame oil and soy based sauce, mixed with dry chilies and cilantro. We are so going to try recreating this at home!

The beef pie order is two large pieces. They taste like Japanese gyoza, but instead of just steamed, the pies are lightly fried. One word of warning, the oil from the meat pools inside the pies. The first bite might have a squirt of oil, but it's easy enough to drain the oil out. 

The hand pulled noodles are delicious, with a toothsome bite. The bowl is large enough to serve two if you split the meat pies too. The broth has a slight flavor of lamb. The taste is a bit bland for me personally but easy enough to add soy sauce and chili sauce to make it even spicier. 

A slight hiccup is that the chef forgot our order of lamb noodle soup. Good thing I asked and they brought it out as promptly as they could. 

I loved the soup though. Very flavorful without being overpowering. A word of warning: the meat is a mix of lamb pieces and organ meat. Delicious but not for the squeamish. 

The best thing is that while published time states that they close at 10pm, we got here at 1130pm and they were still open, with several tables still full. There are other Asian restaurants in the complex but this one called out to us. A really good decision because it was good food at really good prices.",NpYsxh7ow9pfUy9LuWbIuA,2,1,5,qrZ0OHR1_TO-uJLdV6kp_w

Now that that's out of the way...
Went in to grab takeout, was the only customer for dinner at 7PM on a weekday. Small order took literally half an hour to come out and the food was mediocre.

Ordered the steamed dumplings and lamb pancake. Dumplings were mushy, overcooked, and bland. Taste and appearance were identical to what you'd get frozen in a bag at the grocery store and boiling yourself. Pancake contained a small portion of flavorful lamb- too bad it was overshadowed by all the grease. Opened the takeout box to a puddle of oil. picked up the pancake and had it all over my hands, bit in and got a mouthful of it too. Gross!

Service was dismal at best. As the only customer, the wait time was unacceptable and no excuse or apology was given. I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business. Server barely spoke to me, not even when dropping off or picking up my bill.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,6,2,XGi1pgYOya5D1LLPV9aUNQ
1935623,2016-01-31,0,JJzAOl3kQLfhOzB_vjf3FQ,"A previous yelper called this a hidden gem, I think he/ she had a mis-type. Must have meant a ""hopeless"" eatery.

The interior decor is actually quite nice. But the food must have targeted the native Chinese where their taste buds are different.

I came here on a Saturday morning with my wife for breakfast. We had hot soy milk, beef pancake, a bowl of beef Lamchow noodle soup, salt and pepper peanuts.
The bill came up to $20 which I considered high, given the portion of food they serve you, by about 20%. 

But the bill wasn't the issue. The noodle soup was strange. The daikon was not well cooked. Cilantro and green onions must be relatively inexpensive - they were lots of them. The noodle was not a home made noodle but from a pre-packaged supplier. Really not impressed.

I believe the soy milk was home made. Need tons of sweetener though.

Again beef pancake was filled with cilantro and green onions. The chef must have thought cilantros and green onions are the main stay for this dish. You actually need a magnifying class to find those tiny beef pieces.

The salt and pepper peanuts were very acceptable. The issue is that the portion is very small.

I would give this a 2.5 star. But I can't - so I round it of to a three star eatery. But I won't recommend this.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,0,0,3,zUkqxiTHb-ydIuW1dyrErg

The hubs and I headed in after the hubby had a hankering for soup noodles. We ordered a plate of marinated cucumbers, a vegetable/leek pie, Lanzhou hand-pulled beef noodle soup and the chicken and mushroom noodle soup.

Service was prompt (we were the only ones there during a weekday lunch).

The plate of marinated cucumbers were definitely bland and needed to be marinated in more vinegar and garlic. Pass on this dish.

The leek and vegetable pie filling was okay. The main problem was the dough was not fried long enough - leaving a more soggy texture. It definitely needed to be more crispy on the outside. 

The Lanzhou hand pulled noodle dish was kind of a let down. First of all, given the uniformity of the noodles in the dish - these were not hand pulled noodles. Secondly, the noodles were overcooked and were a bit too mushy for my tastes. The soup was rather lacking in beef flavor. The only redeeming factor was the sliced beef was delicious and melted in your mouth. Other than that though, I would not order this dish again.

The chicken and mushroom noodle soup suffered the same issues with regards to the lack of intensity of the soup base and the texture of the noodles.

Overall, there are other places in Vegas that do the same thing better and at the same reasonable prices. 2.5 stars.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,2,6Pdg9mSpRcM-kIMcND_JNQ
2381809,2015-09-07,0,JJzAOl3kQLfhOzB_vjf3FQ,"This is the perfect fix for those hankering for a hot bowl of noodle soup after a long day walking the Strip in Vegas, but skipping the exorbitant Strip prices.

This place is a short way off the Strip in Chinatown. But it's open late at night (or at least it stayed open late when we were there, they officially close at 10pm I think...). Their food is not the usual Chinese fare, it's Northern Chinese and is a bit milder in flavor. But it's also very good!

We had beef pies, and the lamb noodle soup. The beef pie reminds me of Japanese gyoza but larger, and meatier, and with a thicker crust. Very tasty and you get two pieces with one order. The lamb soup had great lamb flavor in the broth (it has a few lamb innards too like liver just so you know, if you're not into that).

All in all this is a good choice for those in Vegas. The folks running the place were very friendly and accommodating too.

Go try it out, guys!",pFxMrHB6wYNXpXQ-BYbS6g,2,1,5,Zw7q0KlIEmXEBuYA2eM9nQ

I was contemplating on going to the ER but some Amodium helped a bit.  At one point I that my appendix burst.  What ever was in my plate was still moving as well.  I guess it wasn't cooked enough or possibly didn't belong there.  After such a joyful experience, I certainly will recommend that my ex go there.",idxdnn_cRg1sOk_Lpcv7kA,0,0,1,hCGdDqxT0VkEAG1KrMq3Tw

They didn't have rice and asked us to wait for them to cook. (What kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't have rice ready?) The server didn't even know if they serve the item we ordered. I can taste the lamb gamy favor on my pork and leek dumplings. I am not sure if this is their unique taste or they share the same boiling water to cook all the dumplings. But the leek pancakes are good, and i may come back just to order it on the go.",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,5,7,3,SQBgdbuSaQaDOiJvRszo8g
