3184,2017-11-24,0,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,wow I was just craving for spicy noodle then I found this Korean Chinese restraunt! we ordered Jajangmyun and seafood Jambbong. They could be little spicy if you couldn't usually have spicy things. But they were really good for me cuz they tasted like grilled somethings right before the fire.,Bm-ybn_5ibNaYGn8cjaQkw,0,0,4,uS_0qETniDQC1RS_cB6ubA

392372,2017-08-23,0,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,My Korean husband was very happy and excited to find an authentic Korean jajangmyeon restaurant. We have been going there at least once a week for a couple of months now for family lunch/ dinners. We went there for a late lunch and we were very disappointed. The jajangmyeon was very watered down almost like a soup .. WT? The taste was nothing like it was when we first started coming here. The food took a long time to come out and it was not even that busy. The jjampong had so much onions in it. The waitress was very nice and apologized for the wait which is not her fault. I really don't know what happened to this place that had such great food. Will most likely not come back or tell family and friends about this place.

Avoid the pick hours.
Two of us had Jjajang myun and Jjamppong.
For Jjajang myun, the sauce seemed ok but the noodle... it is obvious they reheated on hot water.
Which also made the sauce watery...
I think the noodle is the basic. I would understand on pick hours but it was the slowest time of a day.
There were only two tables other than us.
The service was good. The server, a skinny girl, was very friendly.

Food: 
Jaengban Bokkeum Jjamppong (5 stars) comes with jumbo shrimp, squid and other assorted seafood along with noodles. Broth is fairly spicy even though they ask if you if you'd like it extra spicy, I think the regular spice way spicy enough. Good flavor and quite large size. You could probably get 5-6 small bowls out of this dish.

Jaengban Jjajang- (5 stars) I would especially recommend this dish. We got the extra large size and there was quite a bit. This dish is made with some seafood, pork, veggies and black bean. Sauce with noodles were absolutely delicious!! Favorite dish of the night.

Steamed dumplings (4 stars) - nothing special but good dish nonetheless. I believe this dumpling is made with pork and vegetables. 

Baby bokchoy (5 stars)- good dish and very good portion. The thing I look for when I eat this dish is that it the bokchoy is very clean and does not have any sort of dirt near the stem. Looked at the pieces I ate and they looked pretty good! (You can tell I eat a lot of Asian veggies) 

Tang su yuk (5 stars)- very good fry on this dish!!you could tell the oil was very fresh and the fry on the breading was done right. Highly recommend this di

On this last visit their a/c was down and ... it was not pleasant considering it was over 100 degrees outside. Regardless food was still good, despite sweating and eating.

Tried this place twice and it was a polar opposite experience between the two trips. 
Both times I ordered the jjajangmyuen, the classic, nothing added. 

First time it was absolutely amazing. I was shocked I haven't discovered this place sooner. It was the closest to the authentic korean kind you'd get from the homeland. The noodles were fresh, the sauce wasn't pasty, it did take some time for them to bring the food out, but well worth the wait. 

The second time it was the exact opposite...maybe it was because I ordered a large rather than the small...? But that shouldn't hinder the quality. This time around, the jjajang sauce was not runny at all. It was thick AF. 
The kind of thick you'd expect it to be seeing it in the fridge as leftovers a couple days after. Not pleasant at all :(  they didn't even have kimchi as a banchan either. 

They say third time is the charm, but I'm pretty remorseful after that second trip....

Long noods for long life, yo! The service was very attentive and it's a good value (huge portion sizes!) but the food itself didn't do it for me.

Jjajangmyeon is their specialty (black bean noodle with pork) and the sauce was bland and one note, I've have had better elsewhere. They brought scissors to cut the noodles, but that was unnecessary as they kept breaking off and were short. No cool noodle lift photos for us.

The Samseong Jjamppong (spicy seafood and vegetables) was a bit better, but the table was in agreement that the spicy sauce just tasted spicy without a developed flavor. Same issue with the noodles, broke easily and just weren't very chewy. Prefered this soup for the seafood.

Maybe they have consistency issues, or maybe I'm just not a fan of their food. Would come back if a friend suggested it, but would try other dishes. These didn't live up to the hype.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,10,3,4EiJw6LBVpY5tFltwq7X3w

1899178,2017-03-29,1,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"I've been looking for a Korean/Chinese restaurant since the restaurant that I went to in Chinatown closed. So I was super duper excited to see what this place had opened up!!  But I was a little disappointed. :(

The service was not quite up to par... Don't get me wrong the service was what you would get in Korea... Where you had to flag down your server by yelling across the dining room... But in the US... That doesn't really fly.... You know? The server was nice and answered all the questions I had but I had to crane my neck the entire time I was there and try to make eye contact multiple times just to get the check. But to his credit.... It looked like he was the only one taking orders????? There were 2 other ladies there but they just seem to refill water and bring out food. :/ They might need to rethink this. 1 server for that dining area is not enough.  (2/5)

Ambiance... Whoa! This place is definitely bigger then I expected when I walked in. It was huge! I didn't get the see the private rooms or the dining area in the back of the room... But it is definitely bigger then expected! The entrance way was a little dark but the rest of the dining room was very bright. Most of the dining area was painted white with the left side of the dining area being a bright red. It was very clean and the space was very open. Ambiance definitely 5/5

Food... And drink....I asked for barley tea and was told that they only had Jasmine tea... It was served in a cute little pot with a tiny glass... Tea was decent but I really would've liked barley tea. The side dishes or banchan were ok. It was Kim chi made with American cabbage instead of Napa cabbage... This was actually really good and had a great texture. The other dish was raw onions and the traditional yellow pickled daikon served with the black bean sauce who happens to be one of my favs. :) But that was it. Maybe in the future they will have more??? I ordered the deep fried dumplings and that was good. The skin was crispy and the filling was meaty and juicy. And they have vinegar, soy sauce and fine ground chili flakes on the table to make your own sauce for the dumplings. I just wished they had the black vinegar as I think it tastes better then the normal white vinegar for these types of dumplings. 4/5 

I also ordered the jja-jang-myun. The price was decent... It was only $6.95 for the small. This was done more the Korean way instead of the Chinese way which is what I was expecting since most of the pictures they had displayed the Chinese version. The flavor was ok. It was tad sweet for me and I didn't get the porky flavor that I was expecting as well. The noodles were also over cooked as they were very very soft and had no mouth feel. They also need to tighten up the sauce a little as after I was done picking out all the noodles, the sauce was completely soupy which it definitely should not be. 2/5

Overall, I think based off of the dishes that I ordered today that they lean more towards the Korean way of cooking things then the Chinese which was a little disappointing. But since I normally drive all the way to Island Style to get my jja-jang-myun fix...I most likely will be back as this place is only 5 minutes from the house. I'm hoping that they fix the service and fix the jja-jang-myun. Next time I come, I definitely will try something different.

***Tip... Pour extra vinegar onto the daikon and the onions and dip it into the black bean sauce and enjoy!  :)",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,12,6,3,0kh1TOFxcO7SQJxIHo-X4g

The place is very nicely decorated, clean, and is spacious, lots of tables. We came in around 12:30, were immediately seated...everything went downhill from there. We sat there for about 15 minutes, no one else greeted us or even brought us water. Then the waitress came by and took our order...then they brought out kimchi and pickled veggies and we still didn't get water. 

My brother got seafood fried rice which he thought was ok, I thought it was too wet, only a few  baby shrimps and two pieces of muscles and its considered ""seafood"" fried rice. My sister got the rice with pork and vegetables which was pretty good. We ordered dumplings as appetizers which came out after the fried rice and the rice bowl. I got the black bean noodles with pork which never came out! I waited and waited, then asked for it and the guy told me they ""forgot to make it."" So I cancelled it. I will say that the fried rice and the rice bowl came out super quick...the food that we did get didn't take long to come out at all. 

I don't think they have bad service in the sense that the staff were lazy or incompetent, I think they are extremely understaffed. They only had three people working and had a pretty decent number of tables, so I can see that they are working hard. I hate to give them only two stars but for a place that is new they should have more staff and give the best service so people will spread the word. 

For this particular experience I was extremely disappointed. We were not given good service, waited quite a while for our order to be taken, waited a long while for water and water was not re-filled, they forgot my order, and the rest of the food was not impressive. 

I might go back in a few months when they have been open for a while and operation should be more smooth because I really want to try the black bean noodles, but nothing else draws me back to this place.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,1,2,KcJOM5eyETKyifDMYztvLQ
1993986,2017-03-27,1,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"Not a terrible experience, but not outstanding either. I'm a fan of Korean and Chinese food, so we were excited to give YuXiang a try. Unfortunately, the food and service only deserve 3 stars. 

The japchae was slightly mushy and literally had an entire onion in it. I don't mind onion, but this was way too much. There was a tiny amount of other veggies. The flavor was okay, but not anything like traditional japchae.

The Mongolian beef was good. Tender and cooked well. The chicken fried rice was also pretty good. But neither were memorable.

The jajangmyun was a little soupy, flavor was okay, but again, nothing special. 

We also ordered mandoo (which didn't have any sauce). Our total came to $57.

We sat down soon after arriving and a server brought us complimentary hot tea and ice water. They don't offer free refills on soda/iced tea (served in cans) which is a pet peeve of mine. Overall service was okay, not great but not awful. 

Parking is also an issue here. There are 3 restaurants, a Dairy Queen and a few other businesses all sharing a small parking lot. 

In my opinion, when you consider the price, quality of both food and service, along with the inconvenient parking situation, I don't see myself coming back.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,6,3,3,yyyzbAuA9iVKQwMWCimG9g

2468737,2018-03-22,16,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"Easily the best Jjajangs and Jjamppongs in town, YuXiang offers these and other classic Korean Chinese dishes in a lovely setting! If you already like Jjajangs and Jjamppongs, then suffice it to say, you NEED to make your way to YuXiang, if you haven't already, for the best Korean Chinese food in town.

I first had Jajangmyen at an elevated Korean fusion restaurant several years ago and have loved it ever since.  Prior to this experience, I didn't know that Korean Chinese Cuisine was even a thing, but in the same way that we have bastardized Chinese food in America (or should I say it has been bastardized here) based on available ingredients, and the pallets of the nationals, the same divergence happened long ago in Korea. There are only a few places in town that specialize in Korean Chinese Cuisine, and YuXiang is not only the tastiest, but also provides the best atmosphere by a long way.

If you haven't had the opportunity to taste Korean Chinese dishes there are a couple of gateway dishes that are highly reminiscent of American Chinese options: Tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork or beef) and Kkanpunggi (spicy garlic fried chicken)...we shared both of these as appetizers on separate occasions with friends or family we came with. 

The real standouts for me are the previously mentioned classics though: Jjajang and Jjamppong. I usually get the Samseon Gan Jjajang without the pork, because I love seafood, but try to limit my pork intake. The dish is $11 and it hits the spot! I love the thick rich taste of the black bean sauce. Highly recomended. My love likes it spicy and orders one of the Jjampongs, typically the extra spicy Bull Jjamppong or the seafood Samseon Jjamppong. The extra spicy is just that...extra spicy, while the Samseon Jjamppong is a great way to enjoy some seafood in a more approachable spicy broth. While a little more adventurous, Jjamppong is certainly worth trying for all but those with the narrowest pallets.

There are even some American Chinese dishes available if you aren't down with broadening your horizons, but these are not the dishes I make the drive across town to enjoy.

In the end, YuXiang is the absolute best in town...so I could be inclined to pass out 5 stars, but i don't want to get your expectations any higher than they need to be. If you aren't looking specifically for Korean Chinese food, then YuXiang is a very solid 4 stars...and if you are specifically looking for Korean Chinese food, then YuXiang is the beginning and end of the story in Vegas.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,31,26,4,mcyanQAItfSfgn_YymtyOA

Located at Rainbow and Robindale, the mecca of Vegas' new Little China Town, It's certainly appropriate to have a Korean-Chinese restaurant...especially when you consider that this is the best on a short list of Korean-Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. I grew up in Korea, but I've been a resident of Las Vegas for almost two decades now and YuXiang has instantly become my one and only spot for Jjamppong and Jjajangmeon, for me since they opened.

If you are not sure about what to order, they will give you great suggestions....but the menu is well manufactured with pictures of the dishes, so it's easy to make a decision. If you like it a little spicier, chef Lim will do that for you...if you like more seafood, no pork, chef Lim will do that for you. Chef often comes out to say hello, so if you see him don't forget to say hi back.

Let's talk about Jjamppong. The broth is packed with flavor, the noodles are cooked to perfection...chewy, thick, and long....they don't break like many others. I normally get Seafood Jjamppong...tons of seafood, just the way I like.

If you need more noodle or sauce, just ask them...the friendly staff will accommodate your likings. 

There is hot tea, Soju, and even Chinese liquor available if you want to cool down your tongue. 

If you haven't been yet, then make it a point to come down and try this well decorated and well staffed delicious Korean-Chinese option!

I tried to eat Hot Zzam-bbong  to burn streses today. If u like super spicy noodle, just try. It will burn ur all stresses and some minds... Anyway, nice hot. And they have  rooms too. Sometimes, u want to be drunken just with little friends in silence. Without people's eyes. It will certainly isolate you from the world. Good foods, good friends or good someones, Chinese alcohols.

3215544,2017-08-24,1,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"Pro tip: Come hungry, portions are huge!!

Ordered a samseon jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and a samseon gan jjajang (seafood pork and veggies in black bean sauce).  The jjampong broth was delicious!!  The bowl was humungous as well.  The samseon gan jjajang was equally delicous.  So much seafood piled into my bowl.  The food was very good, definitely as good as what you'll find in k-town LA!!  I dined with my mom, and she loved both dishes as well.  When a Korean mom says it's good, you know it's good.  Can't argue with mom!!

The service was really good.  The waitress greeted us as we came in and was very courteous.  Without us asking, she brought 2 extra small bowls because she knew we were going to share.  Also, it seems like the staff is bilingual in Korean and English.  I'm unsure if anyone spoke any Chinese dialect.  

I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I hate the tables and chairs.  I found the chairs to be too high in relation to the height of the table.  Around the bottom of the tables is a decorative piece that I kept bumping my legs into.  I found this to be very annoying.  

Overall, I loved the food and found the prices to be very cheap.  Most likely I'll get a to-go order on my next visit so I don't have to deal with the tables and chairs.  But other than that, a very welcome addition to the Southwest area of town.

3250810,2018-04-08,4,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"I wouldn't say that I'm a Korean-Chinese cuisine connoisseur per se, but I've had a lot of jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) in my days where I can distinguish the good ones from the bad ones. The good ones probably use a lot of MSG tho.

When I first heard about YuXiang, I was so excited that there was going to be a legit Korean-Chinese restaurant here in Vegas, and when I tried YuXiang for the first time, I was pretty impressed with their food. Their jjambbong and jjajangmyun were solid (generous portions of noodles, vegetables, and seafood and flavorful jjambbong broth) along with their tangsuyuk (sweet and sour crispy pork) and kkanppong saewoo (sweet and spicy deep fried shrimp). 

However, I returned a couple times after that, and the food was wildly inconsistent. Once, the jjambbong soup had no flavor and hardly any seafood in it. Another time, the tangsuyuk was way overcooked, and the batter to meat ratio was all batter, hardly any meat. I also feel like the quality of their food has dropped significantly since their debut. Not sure if they changed chefs or not but please try to keep the food consistent!

Service has always been good tho so props to all the servers.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,13,4,3,A7rtIpULSb_9zWX5ewPmAw

At Yu XIang, though, the portion size is very generous so this is a steal and a meal for the next day.  I opted for the jajangmyeon small portion.  I was easily full for about $7.50.  Couple this with a few banchan of radish and cabbage and onion, and the meal was great.  The entree was a little plain with just paste and noodle and small portions of meat and greens, but tasty nonetheless.  All in all, the meal was really good and service was quick and no nonsense.  The tables aren't the best for tall people though as they drop pretty low.    Yu Xiang offers soju and other drinks so it can be a family meal or a late night destination.

3373456,2017-03-28,2,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"We tried to come in on Sunday night. However, after waiting a good amount of time to even be greeted, they told us their kitchen was backed up. That's completely fine since it was newly opened but I don't like waiting in an area looking like a dummy and being ignored just because you had bad news to give me. I know they saw us but didn't bother to acknowledge we were there to just say hold a moment. Just ignored us until they told us they had a 40 minute wait. Anyways, came in on Monday for lunch. 

We got the mapo tofu, pork fried rice, jajangmyeon, and the fried dumplings. Mopo tofu was disappointing. Mapo tofu is known for that numbing spiciness. It didn't have any sign of that. Meh. 

The jajangmyeon was the best of what we ordered and it was the cheapest thing we ordered. It is a bit on the sweeter side. But it was weirdly inconsistent. My friend got the same thing and his sauce was thick while mine ended up watery. I'm not sure if its just because I eat slower or not. 

Fried rice was supposed to have pork in it but somehow there was no pork? I'm not really sure what happened to that dish there. 

Fried dumplings were yummy so I can't really complain about these. I don't think you can really go wrong with those anyways. However, dumplings cost more than the noodles. I don't really quite understand that.

Anyways, I would come back but only to try the other Korean dishes and give them another shot because I REALLY want to like them. But I'll wait till they get things more organized.",XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,3,1,2,frsDjvjrjIrw808yTufuzA

3756224,2018-06-01,4,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"My dad was in the mood for Korean Chinese food, and my trusty yelp app pulled through 

What I ate
- Jjampong: OMG, that broth, so clean, so good, so perfect. It was rich, without being too oily or greasy. You could definitely taste the wok fire flavor in the seafood. Perfect hangover food
- Jja jjang myun: I rarely eat jja jjang myun unless I'm in korea. This was close to korea as I can remember. It was really well made. I was tempted to ask for a bowl of rice so I could finish the rest of the sauce that was leftover. The noodles had a nice bite to them 
- Dumplings: These were just a-ok, nothing special. The filling was tasty, but the dumpling skin was a bit too thick
- Egg drop soup: Being slightly hungover, I just wanted something warm and simple to drink, and this fit the bill. But, nothing overly amazing to write home about

Pros:
- That menu was really beautiful and easy to read for both Korean and Americans. Plenty of beautiful pictures. I also liked that they had a nice variety of options to order from. They had multiple types of jjam pong and jja jjang myun
- Staff was super friendly and checked in on us regularly
- Decor was really cute
- Plenty of seats/tables for small and large parties
- Bathroom was really clean
- Parking was not too bad on a weekday for dinner

Cons:
- They didn't have the traditional chinese soup spoons, just metal spoons. I'm so used to using those chinese soup spoons, that it felt kind of wrong using a metal spoon to eat the soup
- While the decor was cute and super Chinese/Asian, those wooden chairs were SOOOOOO uncomfortable to sit in. Super straight back, no cushion. It was kind of torture!
- I wish they offered a bowl/cup of the jjampong soup. The server was nice enough to offer me one, but I opted for something milder and ordered the egg drop soup instead. I think a small cup of the soup would be a great way to end the meal if you had rice and other dishes
- Sadly, they were very empty. The food and service was so great. I hope they are more on the busy side on the weekends. I was a bit nervous when I first walked in because they were completely empty, but I tried to rationalize it by saying it was a Monday night, kind of on the early side for dinner
- This is such a strange gripe, but I kind of hated the black/dark mirror in the female bathroom. It was really cool to look at, but really difficult to see if I had any red pepper flakes stuck in my teeth after I ate LOL

So I can't believe I waited this long to try this place as it is so close to my house! Wish I got our servers name because she was pleasant and attentive the entire time. 

Was in time for happy hour which is daily from 9PM-1AM (closing time). Nice selection for happy hour and prices are not bad. $5 for appetizers and $8 for entrees. And definitely come hungry because the portions of everything were generous!

My favorites:
-Fried Dumplings - good starter food, very crunchy
-Gan Jjajang - the black bean sauce was salty but when mixed into the noodles it was just right. So much flavor!
-Stir Fried Mushroom - Again so much flavor in these sauces. Rice is a separate charge but definitely order a bowl if you order this because it is a very wet dish.
-Buchu Jap Chae - comes with 3 buns to eat the pork and veggies with, ugh I'm craving it as I type!

My friends ordered a lot more items but sadly the food coma hit me so early I could not go on lol. But everything I was able to try was seriously delicious. Probably one of the best Asian places I've had in Vegas, and there really isn't that many that stand out for me but I was impressed with this one.

 I love good jajiang mein and jampong.  I was so excited about coming here.  This place is disappointingly average.

We ordered jajiang mein, jampong and Gan Peng Ji.

Jajiang mein..sauce average.  Noodle was in one big klump, which means it was sitting there for a while before they brought it out.  In my opinion these noodles should be al dente (as the Italians would say) or QQ ( as the taiwanese would day) or chewy and springy (as Mike K) would say.  You guessed it...these noodles are not. 

Jam Pong.  I got the non spicey since my stomach has betrayed me and I can't eat spicey now.  But even with no spice this broth was excellent.  But the noodles....just like the jajiang mein..has no body or chew.

Gan Peng Ji.  I don't understand all these places that make it with a tomato paste.  It's supposed to be a soy garlic sauce. Here they make it with tomato paste.  Not only is it not good..but really over priced.  Normally korean restaurants give you a big portion of this even if it's not good..but here..small for $14.99.

I was brought iced tea quickly and the server took my order, Jjajangmyeon, a Korean dish of long length noodles with a sauce of black beans and pork.  Before the noodles came, I was brought sides of onion, kimchi, daikon, and a small dish of bean paste.  I was surprised at the mild spice of the kimchi.  Normally, there's more red pepper but this was quite tame.  I added some ground, red pepper to spice it up.

After the noodles came, the server brought me large shears to cut the noodles.  I think this was to help this caucasian eat his noodles easier, much like a mom cuts spaghetti for her youngster.  None of the Asians  in the restaurant were brought such shears.  They worked well and it was easier to eat the noodles so I appreciate her thoughtfulness.  The flavor of the bean sauce with the small pork cubes was very good and it made for a nice change.

Service is about a 1 star 

I was soooooooooooo excited to try this place after seeing all of these noodle pulls on Instagram. I showed my husband and he knows that my love for noodles is ridiculous. So we decided to order to go...they have an online system but it's hard to customize such as no onions and such so we decided to just call. We were able to order with our specifications and the outcome was delish. There's a lot of protein and plenty of noodles when we got it. I would def recommend dining in though just because the seafood does get over cooked when you get it to go unless you live 2 min away. I was excited that I found a noodle place that wasn't the same. 

We came back another time and I had ordered to go on our way there. They told me 30 minutes so by the time we got there we still had 10 minutes left. My husband went inside and he texted me saying that a to go order was ready! That was fast thinking that was ours. Well it turns out that the lady working there said it was NOT our order. He texted me 10 min later saying that he was still waiting. I asked him if we could cancel and he said he already paid since that was the 30 minutes that they had told us. He waited another 10min and that order that was ready when he got there? Yea that was ours! The lady didn't even apologize for making us wait another 20 minutes for food that was all ready ready. Not cool! This experience has left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and I think I'll be skipping this place from now on.

We got our food and it tasted great.  My personal selection was quite limited since I don't like seafood (it is in many of their entrees).  Still the seafood-free noodle dish I ordered was delicious as was my husbands fried chicken dish. 

This restaurant is a. Chinese/Korean place so the style and spice level of the food would probably be more familiar to people unfamiliar with Korean cuisine.  This would make it ideal for bringing my less adventurous friends to introduce them to Korean fare for the first or second time.

My husband liked it, where for me, I'd definitely like to try the soup with heat. I was surprised that I really liked this soup. The noodles were delicious and the broth had a miso color to it since there were no peppers. The seafood was cooked perfectly. 
We weren't offered tea but had to wait a bit when we did ask for it. I believe the hot water machine that boiled the water wasn't working or something so they had to boil the water some other way. When they brought the tea out, the little kettle that they gave us leaked when we poured the tea so we got water all over the table. 
We were never asked if we wanted anything else, instead the male server automatically asked if we wanted the check so my husband just said yes. I guess we're just used to other restaurants where they ask if you'd be interested in dessert.

Alejandro B. and myself took a drive all the way from the north side of town for some YuXiang.

The interior is very new and clean with fancy designed booths for extra privacy. Luckily, we had the privilege to sit in them since it was a little slow.

Our server was very nice... and pretty;) We were given suggestions for our orders to make sure we were completely satisfied. Too bad she didn't have a name tag or I would be able to express my creepy gratitude a little more Lol. Alex took one for the team and got their Jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) while I played it safe with the Samseon Gan Jjajang (seafood pork vegetables with black bean sauce). Both had it's own unique flavor being sweet or spicy. We balanced out all the carbs with some crisp Spicy Wings that weren't very hot, but packed great flavor.

Mapo Tofu was weird, like a cornstarch-thickened sweet tomato soup, lightly spicy, with almost nonexistent meat.  I like the Mapo Tofu at Grand Sign Kitchen nearby a lot more, they use bigger shreds of pork than any of my dishes here had, bigger tofu, less and different sauce.  

Could barely tell the difference between the $11 Japchaebap and $19 Gochu Japchae, the more expensive one was in a different container but the portion looked pretty much the same.  The pork is cut tissue-thin.  For the amount of cost, every entree should come with side dishes, not just 1 set of tiny tubs for the whole order.  The flavoring on everything was very mild (which may be to your taste).  On the plus side, everything tasted fresh and light, no 'old oil' taste.  Every dish we ordered has lots of onions to make the portions look bigger and one of the side dishes is onions.  Perhaps I would enjoy one of the fried pork dishes more, or soup.

Being korean, I was craving for some good korean chinese food. Found this place and thought I'd give it a try. Korean chinese foods most popular dishes are jjajangmyun, jjampong, and tangsuyuk.

I ordered their lunch special which had all 3 of the dishes I listed above. And it only costs $23.95..which ia a pretty good deal for all the food you get...but the food was a major disappointment. 

First tangsuyuk came out. It was crispy on the outside, meaty on the inside. However, i don't think they seasoned the meat prior to cooking. The tangsuyuk sauce was given on the side (which is to help the meat be crispier). Sauce was not good. It was a bit watery than the usually ones I've had else where and it had a strange taste to it. Also a bit bland. Usually the sauce should be a little thick than watery. 

Second the jjajangmyun. Consists of noodles with a black bean sauce poured on top. You mix it all together and eat. Sauce was wayy too overly sweet for me and also watery. Sauce should also be somewhat thick but it wasn't. 

Third item is the jjampong. It's a spicy seafood noodles. This had a kick of spiciness which i loved. Noodles were cooked well, but the soup could have used a bit more flavor. 

Overall i was not blown away. Everything was just too bland for me. I probably won't ever return.",3LNCN_aMHo97xvEFR4PhDw,3,1,1,tqtmJPi3lJd2AbX_4EddaQ

We started off with a pair of chicken eggrolls that were very light and flavorful. We also were served a couple of banchan's that were not particularly noteworthy.  My wife ordered Jjangmyeon noodles (noodles topped with a thick sauce made of Korean black bean paste ((Chunjang)), diced pork and vegetables).  It proved to bountiful and initially tasted wonderful, but it became a bit of a one note and probably should have been shared by 2-3 people.

My parents are Chinese born in Korea and my dad makes the best jjajang but I have to say, even him and my mom enjoyed this place. 

We got a few dishes - such as the mixed vegetables, meat, seafood, on top of noodles and mustard sauce ($27 - can't remember the name) but very delicious. My mom felt like her craving for it was satisfied. We also enjoyed the 6 seafood combo with rice ($15) and the seafood gan jjajang ($11). I thought the gan jjajang was just short of how salty I like it though but it still satisfied my cravings! 

The place was well decorated and not too big or small. It was clean - the servers were sweet and the food came out at a very adequate and appropriate speed. 

Next time, I will get the champong and definitely tangsuyuk (sweet & sour pork)! I really enjoyed the gan jjajang and had some left over that I will be enjoying over rice. I also bet their traditional jjajangmyun is delicious (prob a better option for take out or delivery since gan jjajang is meant to be enjoyed fresh in the restaurant).

The black bean noodle was good. It's not too salty and the flavor is mild. The tong Siu yuk was really good. The quality of the meat was much better than anywhere I've had it.

Well okay..? It is free so I will take it. The server was Stephen I think. While we were ordering, we asked him to see if we can get some jjambbong soup by itself as a complimentary. Stephen told us he won't be able to guarantee us that he is able to give us jjambbong soup, but he will try best, and gave us an alternatives egg soups instead, if it is in that case.

Arriving here their were a few tables occupied. No one greeted us at the door until after a couple of minutes. A young man pointed us to a booth and left. We waited a little over 5 minutes for the same man who I come and check on us and realized we didn't have menus. The menu is separated by categories which was easy to read and understand. Before arriving I knew I wanted to try their black bean noodles and sweet and sour pork. Luckily it was on their lunch special. We got the second to the last lunch special because it included the sweet and sour pork, black bean noodle and their spicy seafood soup with noodles. 
The first dish was the sweet sour pork. They brought it out with the sauce on the side. Which I prefer because I like my pork to be and stay crispy. The sauce and vegetables was good. It's not the typical red or pink sauce that most places will have. All in all I would rate I a 7/10. 
The black bean noodles was the second dish I tried. Honestly, this flavor was underwhelming. I felt that the noodles were over cooked and the sauce needed more flavor. I would rather eat the ones from Greenland market's food court noodles. 5/10
Spicy seafood noodle soup was spicy. I wish I knew to ask for a mild one. I did like it. Never had it before so didn't know what to compare it to. The only downside was the seafood was a little overcooked.",Wcrrm-Epfj3ntWv4GX6fog,0,0,3,EiiMsaU3_IsDq8XQ4rxgmg

I came with my mom. She ordered the jjajamyun. The servings were very big so it was perfect for us to share and have a taste of both dishes. They were both very flavorful! The jjambbong has about 10 crawfish in it and the jjajamyun had a good amount of seafood and pork in it as well. Very good amount of food for a very good price.

5340751,2017-09-12,1,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"I come here because it's one of the only Korean Chinese restaurant south of the 215. One dish I especially enjoy is the black bean noodle aka jjajjangmyun. My husband always gets the spicy seafood noodles or jjamppong. One thing that's really good is the fried pork dish or tangsooyuk. It's fairly big and it can be shared among 3-4 people! It's not too sweet and the pork is fried to a crisp which is great because if it was soggy it would suck.

This place also delivers but if you get the noodles it may not be a good idea because the noodles get hard and rubber like. 

The side dishes are plain with kimchi, yellow radish, and raw onion with black bean sauce. The side dishes could use an improvement. I mainly order Togo and eat at home since I have better tasting side dishes hehe!

5507923,2018-06-26,0,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"Probably deserves 3.5 stars. THe restaurant is located in a typical strip mall. Inside the decor is really impressive with a larger industrial space containg Chinese decor and sectioned off rooms. Each room reminds me of the ancient Chinese bedrooms with tables for groups of up to 6. 

Service was pretty good. No complaints. Attentive and very quick service. 

THe food was incredibly mediocre. The bonchons were a fraction of what I have received at a real Korean place, however, even the ones we got were sad. A lot of pickled onions...that tastes as good as it sounds. 
The Gan Jjajang was sad sad in the sauce was mostly onions and very little any other vegetables. Essentially, the noodles were tasteless and even when mixed it was the sauce it was so mediocre. 
The Jjampong was pretty good. THere was a good variety of seafood and overall very light and tasted reasonable.  
Fried rice no complaints but nothing spectacular. 
I did not enjoy the fried dumplings. Usually dumplings are seared to give it a slight crunch, but the complete frying of them did not taste good and again below average.",tNQnQtCR5OrwGOgyVLMOjA,0,0,3,HAWkki6800GjGitJ_wjxxA
5529536,2018-01-08,62,qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ,"I had no idea that Korean/Chinese cuisine even existed prior to YuXiang opening last year.  From my initial taste to several visits since then, I find the menu to be a whole different kind of comfort food that's chock-full of warmth, spice and carbs.  If you enjoy both Korean and Chinese, I am pretty certain you'd dig this and if you don't like either, please unfriend me immediately.

When it comes to starters, fried is my friend and I rotate between a few.  The ""Crispy Spicy Wings"" have a nice crunch and are the type of wings I eat until there's nothing but bone.  I am also not opposed to ordering the entrees as appetizers, which should definitely be considered.  The pork ""Tangsuyuk"", the K-version of sweet and sour, always seem to have a magnetic attraction to my chopsticks.  I also enjoy ""Kkanpung Saewoo"", spicy, sweet and sour shrimp, which goes great mixed with some white rice (said every Asian ever).

But the real attraction is the noodles, which are longer than some marriages.  I ain't gonna hate going basic with the ""Jjajangmyeon"", but I prefer the ""Samseon Gan Jjajang"", served in separate bowls to be combined soon after its arrival (the noodles will stick together if you wait too long...ah hem...Instagram, cough cough), the addition of seafood and freshly stir-fried sauce to the pork and vegetables make for a much more satisfying meal.  I am also very down with the ""Jjamppong"", which has solid spice and a ton of squid. 

The dining area is surprisingly nice and the K-pop jams sound even better after a bottle or two of soju.   Yu bet I'll be back again.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,97,84,4,rUH9c27A6UFHX-IJXz8jRg

The inconsistency in the food quality is actually impressive - some nights, the jjajangmyun is deserving of a five star review, but on others, we're left questioning if the head chef had changed. Today, I wasn't sure if there was even a chef back there - I don't think I've ever tasted a jjajangmyun so bland and oily. The onions tasted old, and the tang-soo-yuek was absolutely covered with pepper, as if to cover up its actual taste.

Tee decor and cleanliness, however, was really pretty and everything was spotless. Service was also on point as the employees would always come to check up on us, gave us nice friendly smiles, and even offered to help us pick some yummy things that we might like. We ended up going for this clear noodle dish with lots of good toppings on top (I honestly can't remember the name). It was a giant dish for 2 people (or 3 petite tummies), though I probably could've shared that and another dish since I was a hungry hippo. Food was done nicely and there were plenty of toppings (we mixed the noodles with mustard!) I wish I got to try the jajjangmyeon, but alas, we didn't have enough people. Price-wise, this joint is on the higher end, though maybe it's because this is Vegas? (I live in LA and you can find a lot of good-but-cheap(er) Korean/Chinese restaurants). 

Overall, as much as I think the price could be a wee bit lower, this place still deserves a 5 star for excellent service, cleanliness, and well made food. Give it a try!",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,5,6,5,JkwT3XwrT67Vcm25Hd43iQ

This place got good reviews, so we decided to order some food to go. The girl who helped us was very nice and friendly. She took the time to explain the different menu items, because if you don't speak Korean and aren't familiar with Korean food names, you won't know what the items are. 

We always get two things and share. My boyfriend ordered shrimp fried rice, and it was...shrimp fried rice. It's kind of hard to either mess it up or make it a stand-out item. It was good. I ordered the gan jjajang, which the girl described as having pork and vegetables in a black bean sauce. The sauce was tasty, but I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that 3/4 of the dish was onions. There were a few pieces of zucchini and a few pieces of pork. It really should be advertised as an onion dish. Unfortunately, my boyfriend doesn't like onions. Normally, he can pick them out and it isn't a problem, but if you pick the onions out of the dish, there is nothing left but maybe two bites of pork and zucchini. 

After several days in a part of the country with terrible food, we were so excited to get back home to our many amazing food options. Unfortunately, we won't be adding this to our local repertoire.",u5r53zerLzYfDymhtmZlUA,1,0,2,ZIaPMwoF3pOcR8WFlarNCA
