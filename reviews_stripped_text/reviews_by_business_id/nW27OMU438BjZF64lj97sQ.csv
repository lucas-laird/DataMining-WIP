34146,2017-05-25,0,nW27OMU438BjZF64lj97sQ,Best pho I have had anywhere. If you are in Vegas make your way over to this little restaurant in Chinatown.  I would've liked a couple more visits to explore the menu.  I had the spring rolls which were great.  Also they have a dish with a pork chop marinated for 24 (or 48 I don't remember the exact time frame) hours and served in rice that is excellent! But the Pho is the real star in this place.  There are SO many Pho places in Vegas to choose from- I was glad I ended up in this one.,ekQ7di10r35rJr6DAwGyCA,5,0,5,_cghsu0GwhEG3xZe9kX2EQ

Last month I was a little disappointed with their sandwich it didn't taste the same and the service was exceptionally slow but I let that pass. But my trip yesterday was something else. The sandwich was so dry. To top it all off the server was so rude this lady with long black hair need la to go back and take  a 101 customer service class. We came in didn't acknowledge us then it took her 10 minutes to give the menu even if there were a few people only. Another 15 minutes to bring the water. When she came I said we were ready to order she just said ""ok"" goes back to register drinks water goes to the bathroom then back to the register then the kitchen. When we ready to pay my husband goes to the register to pay she says the same thing ""ok"" but then instead of getting our money. She gets a straw brings it another table goes back walks around. Goes to the kitchen gets stuff and after several times going back and forth for another 15 minutes she calls another girl in the kitchen to get out payment because she can't touch the register.",mHmnD5V__-T9HfSSfPFyAA,0,0,2,w7bncgYTa2MOd20V9Gy7PA

i ordered my food and drink, and while waiting, was served jasmine tea. maybe a minute or two after i got the tea my order was in front of me. the chicken pho was... alright. The broth was a bit too salty for me and the chicken wasn't tender or very flavorful. however, doctor it up with some lime and hoisin (among other condiments) and things started to come together. they didn't have boba at the time, so i opted for the jelly with banana smoothie. it tastes like bananas you buy from the store, not the artificial flavoring like from runts candy, and has just the right consistency between icy and creamy. 

i left satisfied with the experience, but not running to tell all my friends about this spot. maybe it's just the chicken pho- the bahn mi i saw while closing out looked fantastic and the seafood pho is appealing, so I'll consider returning for those some day.",k6nBgyLw6dIDnawUPiVg6w,0,0,4,vpBfvFmh99SxMJ8MYyY0sw

DRINK: They have a really big drink menu offering sodas, tea, coffee, smoothies, and authentic Vietnamese desserts.

FOOD: The food here tastes different than other Vietnamese restaurants. I mean that in good way! All their dishes are freshly made and you can taste it. A lot of Vietnamese restaurants are known for processed foods and msg in their dishes, but Pho 90 is not one of those restaurants which I really appreciate. Their Chicken Pho was absolutely delicious. Some recommendations: I think they can add more green onions on top to add color to the presentation of the food, they should offer white or dark meat for the Chicken Pho because I prefer dark meat, and they should offer larger or small bowls because the size they gave me was way too big for me. Their Spring Rolls were delicious, only critique is that some of the veggies they put into the roll was getting brown so they should sort their veggies better. I will definitely be back to try more food here!

ATMOSPHERE: I've gone to every restaurant that has been in this place before Pho 90 opened and it seems that every owner keep the same tables and decor.

Anyway service is as expected from a Vietnamese mom and pop joint but what can you do? The Pho is tasty and legit here. My only other critique they should use bigger fried egg roll shells, make them bigger and they'll probably sell more egg rolls. Overall decent pho, decent prices and good mom and pop joint.

You can really taste the beef in the soup like your supposed too and the meat inside the pho looks fresh and very tender. The bowl are huge for a cheap price. The spring rolls are also very good. You can tell they make it as it's order cause the shrimp and pork inside is always warm.

My mom ordered pho bo nam ve gau, which was missing gau, the ve was so thinly sliced that it wasn't crunchy, and the nam had not the slight piece of fat on it so it was beyond dry (it also tasted like it had been frozen - adding to the dryness). We also asked for a plate of pickled onions (hanh ngam dam) and they really skimped on it and only gave us a plate of 12 onion rings. My friend ordered the goi ga and the chicken was definitely frozen and microwaved to DEATH! It was the driest chicken we had ever eaten and tasted like tough cardboard. It was also all breast meat, where goi ga usually comes with chicken thighs with bone. It was inedible. And I ordered bun thit nuong, which was the best of the three dishes. The pork tasted like it was really charcoal grilled, which was really fragrant. In conclusion, as Vietnamese people coming from Orange County, California (Vietnamese central), we believe the high reviews  for this restaurant were written mostly by white people.

I've never added shrimp paste to my broth but it was included so I tried and it really added lots of flavor to the broth. I also added some chili oil because the broth wasn't spicy enough.

Only thing I didn't like was the pork hock because it tasted too gamey and had a strong porky smell, think it needed to be cleaned better and maybe cooked a little bit longer.

The pho broth was flavorful without being overly salty. It could use a longer simmering in beef bones or just more beef bones to have a beefier flavor. It also lacked the aroma of pho spices that I am used to. But it came out hotter than most places I have tried in Las Vegas and that is a bonus. I finished my pho before my sandwich came which was pretty bad.

The sandwich was pretry good compared to most of the places in Vegas which use the overly sweet pork in theirs. So cudos for the best pork banh mi in Vegas so far.

Service is a bit lacking. There was one young lady running the entire front during lunch and she was constantly hustling and helping custoners the whole time I was there. They need to hire another person up front and this place would get 5 stars if service improves. No fault of the person currently running everything herself. The place is just not organized.

Bottom line is if the food is good I will return. Which I will. They had some good reviews for a few of my other favorite Vietnamese dishes so I'll be checking those put soon. 

Being relatively new to Las Vegas it is always challenging having to find good Vietnamese food because its a dime a dozen in populated places. Everyone thinks they can make a good broth, which is the core of all Vietnamese soups.",-R_hd3xKlnUIi_m-IZsY9Q,0,0,4,A1wBiri2Wv4XHVeI7yfpZg

When the hurried owner/server was told we had questions, he answered them well enough but actually discouraged certain food as though it were nasty (thanks!) HOWEVER, I don't know why they just didn't say, ""All we have left is Pho"" because everything we tried to ordered wasn't available or the machine to cook wasn't working -- personally I think they were already cleaned and didn't want to bother, understandable but again, just serve Pho,  after a certain time. (At least I think he was the owner, as he was training the hostess/new waitress)

The pho broth is definitely oilier than I had hoped, it has a good taste but all the oil ruins it. We got the P13 - Rare Steak & noodles... the meat wasn't excellent but not horrible, definitely needed extra Hoisin Sauce! But again, we've been eating Pho for awhile now -- the amount of oil in the broth made me a little nauseous, I didn't eat as much as I had hoped...

& the place is called Pho90, but it should be called Pho9

Very little chance we will give this place another shot since there are DOZENS of Pho restaurants even within walking distance (we almost went to the one across the street on accident, kind of wish we would have made the mistake!)",IefVUTqnZEmMjqW5LCkUPg,1,0,2,rCvllBp9QBDjcGRG1lSqHg

Environment: it's a pretty causal place for dine out, the waitress was very friendly. She answered my question patiently and gave me good advices.

Appetizer:
Chicken salad: the waitress recommended chicken salad for me, I ordered it and I love it. They seasoned it well and the chicken tasted tender. It's little sweet!

Pho:
Beef stew pho: the soup was life. I literally drink all of it. The beef stew was the part I'm not happy about, it tasted so chewy and rubbery, and it so dry and it stuck between my teeth. 

Overall: I would come back again for chicken salad. If they could make their beef stew better, I would order again, since the soup was amazing.",R494UCWNG5FSg_yhndq1hw,1,0,4,-Fx8pMYvuhnzZ8CjD79c1w

Last night, after 4 hours of driving home from SoCal, my friends and I decided to check out this new place because another place we had originally gone to was packed. To my surprise, this place turned out to be amazing! 

When it comes to their Pho, I didn't find it to be all that exciting. But who cares? I'm not the one who ordered it. As far as I can tell, my bf inhaled it so it must be good. I'm just not a Pho person.

Their B1 Vermicelli hit the spot! In most places, their noodle to veggie ration seems a little off. This place gave me an even ratio or a little more noodles! I'm thankful for that since I'm ordering a noodle dish, not a veggie dish! Their sauce is a little different, tastier with a kick of spicy. Though I'm not a fan of spicy, I definitely didn't mind it. 

The server, Eric, was really comfortable around us. He didn't act like a robot server which I kind of understand if you do the same thing over and over again. I liked that he was simple about how he checked on us. Not over excessive. Just peaks over and makes eye contact in case we needed something with an occasional ""that's the sound of good eating. Anything else I can get for you at the moment?"" question. 

What I like the most about this place is how each and every table has plugs. It's almost like an invitation for you to work here while you eat. I'm not sure if that's what they were going for or if people even do that at Pho places but I like that they give me the option.

Normally I'll go to Vietnamese places for pho, but ever since I had a brisket banh mi back in Anaheim I've been looking for one here in Vegas! I saw this place carried a beef version, which is great because normally most places only have pork variety. And I don't eat pork (aside from spam musubi and BBQ pulled pork sandwiches, sorry, can't resist). 

Back to the restaurant - it's not too big, they have booths along the sides and a couple of tables in the middle. There was only one guy serving every table so service was slow. I'd rate it a 3/5. 

For the banh mi I'd give the bread alone 5/5! Soft on the inside and has a nice crunch once you bite into it. Inside the sandwich you'll find a few shreds of carrot and pickled radish, some cucumbers, beef, and cilantro. The sandwich as a whole was not bad, once I added some fish sauce and sriracha it was way better. However one thing I don't prefer is that they use lard instead of mayo to spread on the bread, and maybe this is normal but I'm just not a fan of the fatty mouthfeel so I ate around that part. Maybe I'll try to order it without that spread next time. Overall this place will be my go to whenever I crave banh mi.",exrhmN7te3DWgay2m6fZBw,0,0,4,-3yIfn7hjt5JtAuthP0vBg

Unfortunately this place gave us the impression that they cannot handle a big load of customers, which is sad because this place is rather small. Getting in, we inquired about the smoothies. They told us right off the bat that we could order it but would take them a really really long time to get it to us because they were backed up. We had to ask for limes 3 times in a span of 15 min. Water refills were nonexistent during our stay. The sandwich came out about 15 to 20 min after we got our Pho. All of this and not even a full house, about 2-3 tables empty.

I ordered Pho Tai (P13) and my boyfriend had a Combination Pho (P1) and we really enjoyed the broth. It did not taste watered down. We were super hungry and ordered a large but I could have been good with a small. They offer small, large, and x-large bowl size.

Dining solo today, I ordered their fresh spring rolls as an appetizer and the P1) Pho dac biet as my main.  I tried to order cooked dishes to-go to bring home to my wife but apparently their stoves weren't working.  Pretty much half the menu was not an option today.  Though they apologized, this was a disappointing way to start a dining experience.

The spring rolls came first and I was impressed.   The portion size was large and their take on a peanut dipping sauce was fantastic.  The ingredients seemed fresh enough and I would definitely order these again on a follow-up visit.

Their pho was equally great.  The clear broth had a nice clean taste and the bowl was stacked to the brim with various cuts of meat.  If you're new to pho, the pho dac biet comes with well-done and rare flank steak, beef balls, tripe, tendon along with a hefty portion of thin rice noodles.   Accompanying the bowl is a side dish filled with bean sprouts, peppers, basil leaves, and limes.  First try the savory broth, then add to your heart and stomach's desire.

Overall a nice option for those late night cravings for pho.   I'll be returning to try their non-soup options in the future and hopefully add the 5th star to this review.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,4,1,4,qyXHO7mA5u6nTopRUSapvw

I have'nt had pho for a while. This place is in Chinatown and the small parking lot is always packed on the weekends, but I swooped by pretty early today and found a spot.  

Everything looked great on the menu and the noodle dishes also comes in ""XL size.""

For takeout, I ordered-
P11: Tai Gan - rare steak, tendon, and rice noodle. 

B4: Bbq Pork with Vermicelli and

Golden Egg rolls which was delightfully crispy.

Broth is tasty and just the perfect amount of star anise and seasoning , with generous chunks of bbq pork, tendons, and sides.  The rare slices of beef flank were packed separately on the side.  I like to throw those in the broth once it comes out but luckily they weren't well done. The Bbq pork was well seasoned.

Quality and quantity.  Best of both worlds.  Overall a statisfying bowl of pho.  Next time it will be Banh Mi sandwiches and Smoothies.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,1,0,4,4JGwCck0TE6OOf5MEW68Dg

We ordered a Thai tea, spring rolls, pho and a combination bahn mi

The Thai tea is phenomenal,  I almost finished it before we got our appetizers. 

It was very dead when we came in. It was us and one other lady who already had her food. So after we had been there 10 minutes and our server came up to tell me they were all out of combination bahn mi, I was a little confused. But it's a bahn mi. They don't take long to make, so I ordered the BBQ pork bahn mi. 

At this point we got the spring rolls. Very fresh and not over cooked. Which was great. We are still wondering why it took 10 minutes to tell us about them being sold out of an item. 

5 minutes after we finished our spring rolls my bf gets his pho. And I wait. And wait. And wait. When my bf is just about done with his pho, she comes back and asks me if I want my bahn mi spicy or not spicy.... okay.... once again... couldn't this have been asked when I ordered my food? 

And finally... 5 minutes later. My bf is done with his pho and I get my bahn mi! Yay!.... but not really. Because as soon as I am about to take a bite of it. I find a hair inside my sandwich. 

Let's make this clear. If I had the bahn mi earlier and it had a hair. I wouldn't have made a big deal about it. But I had been sitting there for 20 minutes without an apology, and my bf is done eating. And I get a sandwich that will probably take another 20 minutes, and her response it to remake it.... but would I like another Thai tea? Or something else that's faster? 

I just wanted to get out of there. I was starving and didn't want to wait any longer for food, so we left. And I got tacos across the street

On a plus side... My bf said he loved the pho and that the pho in my side of town is better than his. 

I really want to give this place a second try. It's only 2 blocks from my house, and the reviews make it seem like this place is good. But I really don't think I will because of how this entire situation was handled, and everything that happened. Sorry Pho 90...

I do blame myself a bit for what happened as I didn't pay much to the reviews in the last month which has shown that this place has REALLY gone downhill. Even if a place has more than 4 stars. Check the reviews",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,0,0,2,YiZdsxdans5yVfy3aQ3G1w

It was not too oily at all, a very light broth with a light amount of natural fat.  That little bit of oil is FLAVOR, it's a good thing, and fat is very healthy for you.  But this is nothing like ramen broth, so if you hate heavy broth, don't worry.  It is a good level of salty, too, so remember to drink lots of water for the rest of the day.

Way more meat than I expected, too, very happy about that.  I was actually unable to finish my bowl, the size is huge.  My husband couldn't finish either.  I was full for hours.  By the way, a pot of tea is complimentary.  Service is fast and friendly.

I had high expectations of this place but when our bowls came out, there was a layer of greasy hanging on the top of the bowls. The flavor was ooookkk but the grease lined up lips as I was eating and that's just super gross. The noodles had a hard time separating (they were probably either old noodles or cooked way too early and just sat there). 

I had P10 which was the rare state and flank or brisket and the meat was nothing out of the ordinary but was slightly more chewy than usual. The size was average for a medium bowl but I wasn't sure I wanted more with all that grease haha. 

Go to Pho Kim Long... I know sorta overplayed and potentially getting worse from when it was really good back in the day but you won't regret it. I also sorta like how Pho Kim Long has better decor and makes me still think im in a vegas hotel.",N9zSfJ3vUJcUTV4cflBvVg,1,1,2,NX_-X_WLx6AhEAmmjYvhYw

4990651,2017-06-24,7,nW27OMU438BjZF64lj97sQ,"Why the pho does this place have 4.5 stars average? I was brought here under that pretense. Maybe my taste buds have been damaged by the desert heat. I mean, there's nothing majorly wrong with this place, but several small things added up dropped this down to a 3 star max.

Came in on a weeknight, and only a few tables were taken. As we entered, a young lady pointed us to a table in the back, when the owner walked by and pointed at another table and said ""sit there!"" We complied. We decided on some grilled meat dishes, but was warned that it would take longer, about 15 minutes. Being hungry, we changed one of our orders to pho hoping to get some food in our mouths sooner. Immediately, the owner looked impatient as he said ""OK, what number do you want?"" We ended up ordering a shrimp pho and a grilled pork w vermicelli.

I also wanted a smoothie, when the owner said "" You know what's better? water. It cools you down and has no sugar.""  Uh ... what? This is the first time ever a business tried to talk me out of ordering something extra. So I got water. 

Out of curiosity, I timed our orders (since he warned us of the delay) The pho, which usually takes about 5 minutes at every other pho place I've been to, took almost 15 min. and the pork & vermicelli came out shortly after. So ... they're both delayed, no difference. Perhaps he should have said, "" we're slow here so watch our endless Bruno Mars videos that we're streaming off YouTube."" They didn't even have the decency to skip the ads. The few other tables there already got their food, so we weren't sure what would cause the delay. 

The flavor of both were so average, nothing stood out. The best parts of the experience, we were no longer hungry and the owner saved me a few bucks by talking me out of ordering a smoothie. Only when we're about to leave did the owner smiled a bit and spoke a few extra words to us. Nope ... not planning on coming back. This place is a 2.5

4994971,2017-02-16,8,nW27OMU438BjZF64lj97sQ,"After few days of really bad eating and drinking on vacation in Sin City, who doesn't need pho?!  Comfort food, miss home, need pho badly fix! I always need one, me & my other half. 

After gambling later than usual in Downtown Las Vegas, I wanted to go back to my go to pho place but they closed at 9 pm. Thank you to Yelp search, this business popped up with a 4 star ratings. After looking at photos and reading a few reviews- I made up my mind and its Pho 90 for sure. 

Located in Las Vegas' beautiful Chinatown, on Spring Mountain Rd. It wasn't hard to find at 11 pm at night. They are located in the corner of this complex with many other shops. There are lots of parking for everyone. The restaurant is very new, clean, and welcoming!! I love the feel of this place. Pho 90 just opened ending of December and I am happy to see such high ratings for this place. 

The waiter dropped off our menu, I looked thru the menu and everything sounds good. I had to get my pho and I want to try everything else on the menu. It took me awhile to decide until I finally made my decision and place my order with the waiter. I had to decide on what to get for my other half. Our orders: 1 large chicken pho, 1 large beef ball pho, grilled pork banh mi, & a pot of hot jasmine tea.

Note: it is 2.00 for pot of tea. The waiter dropped off water and tea, I like the cute little tea pot and tea cups, and a basket filled with our utensils. ( what a cute idea) Our vegetables came out with my steamed bean sprouts per request. Then our piping hot bowls of pho comes out. I can see the steam, smell the nice aroma of pho, the broth looks nice and clear. I am loving it!! We both sample our soup and wow, the soup is just perfect. It was very flavorful and light. The portions are huge. We put in our veggies, lime, spices, and made out sauces ready. I gave some of my chicken to my other half and he gave me some of his beef balls. We made our own chicken and meatball pho combo. We are ready to eat! 
Oh my...... this is some good pho and it really hit the spot. The chicken is very tender and fresh.
The beef ball are home made, not packaged meat balls. We are very impressed!! We really enjoyed our pho and only 8.50 for a large bowl of pho, can't beat that price back in Honolulu. 

As we were enjoying our Pho, our grilled pork banh mi came out later. I shared this with my other half. The banh mi is huge and they sure filled up the banh mi with lots of grilled pork and veggies. I love how the veggie is cut so fancy. The French bread is toasted to perfection and wow, I really loved everything about it. It sure did come out spicy, I recall the nice aunty asked if I wanted our banh mi spicy. I was already full but I really loved my pho and banh mi, I just wanted to finish it up. 

As we were dining the couple next to us, discovered this place on Yelp as well. They mentioned that they enjoyed their food. I also had the opportunity to talk to the owner. Aunty came out and we started a conversation. She is so sweet. One question, I asked her, ""what is the meaning of Pho 90""?  A favorite number and its a tradition for restaurant owners to do this.  

Another thing great about this place, they open early and close later, midnight on weekdays and 2:00 am on weekends. Perfect for very late dining. 

I remember Aunty said her son's name is Kevin but he wasn't there that day. I read about his excellent customer service skills in a few reviews. 

Come check out Pho 90!! 
We will be back for sure on my next visit to Sin City!!

The portion was a bit small compared to what they charged for the BBQ pork place. Instead of an egg omelet they have a eggs over ex on top of the rice dish. The spring rolls were good. 

Next time I'll try the pho and the Bahn mi.",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,0,0,4,U22hIjgIJzLkn0_3NWgdSw

FOOD: MEDIOCRE 
SERVICE: UTTERLY HORRIBLE

Whoever is running this establishment knows NOTHING about about customer service.

My group arrived at 10:30, was seated at 11 (the wait for a table was understandable) and waited for someone to tend to our table for 15 minuets... we did not even get waters... after a waiter finally came to take our order, we noticed groups that arrived after us were getting their food while all we had were empty water cups. 

FINALLY at 11:57 (an entire hour after we were seated) after every other group in the restaurant received their food, we asked to cancel two of our orders because two people out of our group could not eat meat on Sunday (aka in 3 minutes) and the staff said they were unable to substitute any meat for tofu. After those two people in our party left because they were unable to eat ANYTHING, the last 4 of us waited ANOTHER 15 minutes for our pho to come out (which was not even hot btw???). We did not even receive the 1 pork banh mi we ordered until we asked where it was, and even then they gave us the wrong order and served us a BEFF banh mi!!!!! 

The staff did not even know how to apologize properly, or even provide better service. They just kept trying to blame everything on the kitchen staff. At least refill the empty water cups!

At the very least those two kids working the front of the house need to be fired or trained properly because I have NEVER been to an establishment this unprofessional/confused before. Everything mentioned in this review was LESS THAN HALF of the horrible service we experienced. 

NEVER COME TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE TO STARVE AND GET SERVED COLD FOOD AND THE WRONG ORDERS",zhN3XE8YoTxEf7QQKzaHag,1,0,1,q6K5tnaGBjQAXkK-PQJWoA

I tried the combination pho. It wasn't anything extraordinary to me but it didn't lack flavor. I also tried the BBQ pork bahn mi & it was amazing! It took awhile for the sandwich to come out but it was well worth it. The bread was toasty but not too crunchy that it cuts the roof of your mouth (like other bahn mi's I've tried) it literally melted in my mouth! Thinking about it right now is making me crave for this sandwich. I'll come again for the sandwich!!",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,1,2,4,5Sa2x5FjZI64mTe-BHRL-A

Every time I've been here they've always been welcoming and helpful. Very attentive and fast service. They bring everything to your table once you order so you don't ask for much. They're a smaller spot so it does get full pretty fast. 

The prices are reasonable and the portions even better. Flavor of the pho broth is delicious (usually get pho tai) and the grilled meat with the cold noodle (bun-tuc-nun, idk the spelling) is the best I've ever had in town. The way they cook it is on a certain fire grill and it's seriously sooo good like you just cooked it straight from the backyard BBQ.

There have been a couple times where I've ordered on the phone for pick up. There was one time in specific where I ordered ahead, picked it up, went to work, and had realized they had given me the order. Because I didn't have time to do anything about it I just figured I'd eat what I had. They ended up calling me back and apologized, they wanted to bring me the right order because they knew I was going to work, I told them that it was okay and they insisted on coming by, and even let me keep the wrong order... seriously no one does that and I don't think places would ever do that, but they did. They truly exceed my expectations every time and deserve all the amazing reviews they receive.

Also ordered Bun Bo Hue and this is the only place in Vegas that ive seen that includes pigs blood ( a normal item traditionally found in bun bo hue) in theirs.  

The place was very clean with simple decor.  Nice and cozy.  

The service was on point. The server (i believe his name is Kevin was very courteous and knowledgeable about the menu.  He was nice enough to bring some different sauces for us to try.  He was awesome and informed us that they will be adding more things on the menu in the near future.
