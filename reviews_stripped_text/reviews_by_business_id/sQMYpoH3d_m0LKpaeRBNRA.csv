Staff very attentive and price point is reasonable for the Strip.

Really enjoyed my experience and will definitely return. :)",300SiXcYhq_Cp2dRMYpX5A,0,0,5,iABb-B9jVwkbiGU-_e0dSw

This cafe closed at 6pm for a very long time and recently changed their hours to close at 5pm. Unfortunately, we did not realize this until our last visit. We arrived at 4:40pm hoping to have a quick bite to eat and a couple drinks. We had to ask if they were still open as we were not greeted (other people were at tables eating so the place was not empty). We were seated and could tell that we were not necessarily welcome due to the time we arrived. We were hungry so we stayed and I made a point to tell them we would be eating quickly and not keeping them much later than their 5pm closing time. Big mistake in staying! We asked for water with our cocktails, when we had a sip of our water it was VERY CLEAR that there was a mold/mildew situation going on due to the taste and we noticed our lemon had black stuff on it (will post a pic). Absolutely disgusted we returned our waters and ordered bottled water. We ordered the burger and grilled cheese w soup for lunch which we thought tasted decent. Soon after our food arrived the music was turned off. I asked the manager(?) to please turn it back on as it's incredibly rude and we were eating quickly. Also, who likes to eat to the sound of dishes being done? We finished our meal, paid and tipped (above 20% due to the fact that we came 20 min before closing) and left. Later that evening we felt sick and spent more time than we should have in the restroom. Lovely! So, to say we were upset is an understatement. This experience was just terrible. I understand we came in 20 min before closing but geez. Our tip was generous, we were quick and polite, and we were sick all evening. Not happy at all.",RdrvkrzDbXEXhxPxSp9GDA,9,6,1,73JewaY95dEptPpC2eSwgA

Even if I'm not shopping here I'll go just to eat here. I recommend it at any of there locations. Everything is always amazing and service is always great!",oNK13OqQtsJ1eKM0fKMqhQ,1,0,5,WcFhJHpM1TQiAPYgCczxug

Wow, it's facing the the strip at the corner of one of the best picture spots if you need a restful way to eat, relax and snap some photos of the strip. They have outdoor seating if you happen to be visiting on a day that's less than 100Â° it might be nice to sit out there. The food is pricey, but it really is gosh darn good. I have the chicken schnitzel sandwich, with a side of fries. My lunch date had the salmon tacos. Good portion for lunch. Service is excellent. Parking underground is covered and free. Hardly ever a wait.",mMK3y_QlUlneZmh9belgCA,3,2,5,iUDd7h6ZD3pa82EehW-LNw

Service was great and so was my chicken sandwich! So good!",kXZDwLc-oKsJMzY_MMVxRQ,0,0,4,QDCL5AbJLUMiwD6f7_Xb3A

I immediately noticed the ""Happy Hour"" menu sign which piqued my curiosity.  I arrived at the Mall at 11:30 am, so I had only 30 minutes before HH service started.  When I walked inside, I requested outdoor seating and the hostess sat me immediately.  It was such a beautiful day, so this made my visit an even more enjoyable experience.  I ordered the ""Happy Hour"" Kale Cesar Salad ($5), which was an ample size serving and a Pomegranate Martini ($) which was well made with top shelf vodka. I was also served a warm and flaky roll with a cream spread and a tasty chicken consomme, with compliments.  My server was warm, courteous and was happy to assist me. The outdoor patio overlooks Wynn Hotel and you algo get views of the Palazzo.  They also accept all major credit cards as well as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman cards.  This is a great place for lunch, dessert, or cocktails.",_z7VFgGA7hJQ_KUaq0ERzA,1,0,5,W4Zksl0Z3pb9pilgf-SyAw

I had the trout special last time and it was delicious.  They have daily specials, e.g., salmon tacos, which are the best deals.  Nice quiet atmosphere where you can talk, do business or get a reprieve from the Fashion Show Mall.",WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,0,0,5,1Sp3LLtnCsCfggWWPY1ryQ

They make the best ice tea in town and serve a hot popover straight from the oven, yum! That popover inspired me to find my popover pan and make some for my honey at home. He was so impressed and so was I, ha ha. I ordered the salmon tacos and he had the trout special both were delicious. Quality food, classy cafe and a bit expensive too.",PqKT6qOR1s5wolJUSqPl2Q,2,0,5,X-QmWFiXQqLXkO-BXSeRfg
