They gave the wrong food to the wrong person, took it back, and tried to deliver it to right customer. That person, rightfully, wanted nothing to do with a bowl of soup that may or may not have been eaten out of by the prior customer. 

Disaster averted; I placed my order for kalbi ribs....easiest order in the world right? Guess not, as it took exactly 38 minutes before they nonchalantly called my numbert. As I sat starving in those 38 minutes waiting for a damn plate of kalbi ribs, I took inventory of every customer after me. In that time 2 more groups of customers came with fairly large orders. All three groups of customers got their food within 5 minutes of my order coming out of the kitchen. I'm guessing the cook in the back decided to take her smoke break for the first 25 minutes of my 38 minute wait. And....this might be petty....but the girl in the front delivered the other customer's food to their table, while I had to walk up to the counter and pick up my own. Hey whatever....I don't mind walking 20 feet, but it just adds to the feeling that they couldn't give a crap about my order. 

The ribs were OK. I'm burping up a wierd after taste 3 hours later. I think the meat was marinated in something funky, but overall it wasn't bad tasting. I've certainly had larger portions of meat for $18. And the banchan situation here was ridiculously bad. 3 small side dishes of kimchee, fermented cucumber, and bean sprouts. Again for $18 bucks and 8 ounce of meat, I'd expect a little more. 

I really waffled on giving this place a 2 star, but this recent ""nasty burps"" situation is leading me to believe that a ""nasty bathroom"" situation is in the future. Please avoid if you value your time or your gastrointestinal health.",zUv5N7oEA2ivMu1FC6lf9w,0,0,1,w3UFWUDspzG56KCtoflSCw

Had the dolsot bibimbap which was great, even though it had less vegetables than I usually see but the taste was great.  Eating area is food court style which wasn't packed and was clean.  Prefect for a quick bite.",AbaO6D183QuKbdFn_VDqCA,0,0,4,UzUETrKVC_91_QSJoKHHqQ

Asked for some traditional Korean dishes and was told that because the business next door to them offered it, they were not allowed.  Strange, it is offered in three other places in the same market ... just kimchi soup.  

The side dishes tasted like they came from a container and not ""home made"". 

Just not impressed.

On the plus side, she gave us an extra rice - no charge.",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,0,0,2,Ic-Cwd1cs7HjUCzMAL_IRA
1783553,2016-01-03,0,hB52ZG3dkHKfz1D9aYu19g,Had the kalbi tang here and it was 14 dollars. Little on the pricey side but had big chunks of meat. Unfortunately the soup had no flavor and the meat was very tough to chew. The sul Lang tang was pretty flavorless too. Too bad maybe ill try something else here next time.,2DrccQBiV3VIxqOSZHW7vw,0,0,2,FxzHXR-Vj99KcP2UVB-wvA

3852558,2016-08-28,1,hB52ZG3dkHKfz1D9aYu19g,"I was visiting Greenland and decided to grab lunch to bring home. Of course, being at a Korean supermarket, I just had to get Korean food for lunch. 

To my surprise, they had meat jun on the menu! If you're from Hawaii, you know and love meat jun. What's not to love?? For those not in the know yet, meat jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is fried in an egg batter into meaty goodness. Considering how rare meat jun is to find in Vegas, I knew I had to try it. 

I am sorry to report back that it just didn't do anything for me. The meat was a little tough and chewy. And there wasn't enough flavor in the dish for me. I really wanted to like it but that combined with a pretty steep price (~$11), no thank you. The order came with rice and two small portions of kim chee/side dishes. 

So the search for that Vegas meat jun is still on for me. I doubt anything will ever come close to what Hawaii has to offer but I'm still up for the challenge to try!",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,4,3,2,7SKVqL4Gja0BhVr5Ie_05g

Decent bibimbop that was a tad skimpy on the meat but overall satisfying especially with the hot sauce and I added kimchi that took it up a notch. The bulgogi serving was huge, and pollack soup had a nice mild flavor. Banchan consisted of only kinchi, pickled radish and sprouts, so they could do better there, but overall a good meal in the cafeteria. Family was happy with everything.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,4,Ern8ctdd-BtVtABTJ5nluA
