I work a few buildings down and will usually stop by to grab lunch. The veggie sandwich is my go-to and I'm not even vegetarian! I have yet to explore the menu. The food is great and so is the service. They are very welcoming and will go above and beyond to satisfy your tummy.

My first impression when walk in was interior has lasting impact in five star way. The outside thinking about more like industrial area vibe shopping center cause not lot of food spots in it. The minute you walk in the door feel the owners put lot of work or the details came to making you feel relax dine in atmosphere. They have fire place not sure if real working one or not. Basically like one see in real house chilling in the living room. On one wall you see all these phrases on different plaques spread across. I like that personality very much! Each one very different. The napkins holders got personality. This tiny coffee cup that holds the napkins down. They have outdoor patio area. Just great atmosphere chill over book with good cup of coffee.

I ordered a Bagel Sandwich with turkey, swiss and added fried egg (extra charge). The Bagel itself was good not going rave about it cause not fresh. Deli slice of turkey tasted very much fresh, tasty, and get decent portion. Fried egg. Nothing better in any sandwich or for me then fried egg. You get some of that egg yolk action all over. lol! The FRESH fruit comes with the sandwich. Something that five star shout out. Nine times out of ten for my experience. Side of fruit or get sliced of fruit with dish. Never look FRESH more less taste it. Tipps Cafe it was on point. Strawberry, blueberry, and orange slices. 

The menu have nice diversity also salads besides sandwiches. They also have whole section for smoothies. I need try some of those next visit. They have a stamp card program that covers both drinks and sandwiches. Buy 10 get one free.

My drink ordered Caramel Macchiato Frappucino. Delicious! It was not over sweet just right. It had nice balance.

Bacon, provolone, egg croissant. Here's why the 5 star.  The egg. 
I'm a total egg snob. I like'em the way I like'em and that's about it. And the way I like'em is what I call the 'jammy' yolk. I want that yolk firm on the edge and jammy molten middle. Not runny. Jammy. At this point I don't even bother trying to get them that way cause it never seems to pan out.  Low and behold the 'jammiest' of eggs come proudly in that buttery croissant, flanked by proper bacon, not that greasy stuff, and a warm loving blanket of provolone. Dear god. 
Super fresh fruit on the side and some legit coffee and Boom! Epic breakfast.

I was driving down the street and curiosity struck. I pulled in and walked inside for the first time. The atmosphere brings on an illusion of comfort, for it closely resembles the lobby of a retirement home, and not a coffee shop.

Luckily, I planned on getting something on the go. And so I ordered a latte, which I believe has the best distribution of espresso and milk. (A coffee snob can argue about this at another time.)

I finally get my delicious latte... And it tasted AWFUL! Closely resembling soap. Oh but of course I forgot to add sugar, silly me!

Well, let me tell you, no amount of sugar, not even 10 of those little packets, could rectify this beverage. At this point, the latte tasted of soap sweetened with an excessive amount of sugar. To compare, a beverage at Starbucks would ultimately be liquid gold compared to this pile of junk!

The only conclusion that I can come up with is that the beans were stale, though actually, I'm not quite sure if that's a right assessment either. Stale coffee tastes better than the abomination I had!

1. Having kids, and I mean like 8 and 10, being the face of your restaurant not smart. Walking in I had to ask if I sit or order at the counter...kid said whatever.. Ok I ordered, kid didn't write anything down..then the mom I guess came over and started writing stuff. I get your a family establishment..just make sure the kids are trained and know things.
2. Menu is so small. Like 6 items. Had a bagel sandwich. No choice of bagel. No choice how the egg is done..and if there was it wasent voiced or on the menu. Btw the sandwich was good but runny yoke on my egg..gross.
3. Portion sizes small. I got a side of potatoes with my sandwich and there were hardly any. And the side of fruit was one strawberry sliced, two half slices of orange and 2 half slices of apple...could you spare the fruit?
4. Place is small. 4 tables and some counter seating that's it..there are tables outside with no form of shade. Noon it was 95 degrees out. Don't want to sit out there.
5. Everything is disposable. Paper plates. Plastic silverware in take out packs, plastic cups. Go to IKEA and get some real dishes and real silverware.

The good tasted good but could use some bigger portions and some plating work.
The inside is cute but the spent all the money on fancy signs.

We had the Strawberry Banana smoothie, Thai Iced Coffee, Veggie Omelette, and Waffles & Berries. Everything was fresh and delightful. 

Whether you're looking for a quick cup of coffee, or a place to sit and eat for breakfast- this is the perfect joint.",lwW00JSczonqKyVCwIEFeQ,0,0,5,C0gY6xBdv6nPaq70V_lB3g

I don't think the lady working around 12pm on a tues morning even knows anything about customer service. Let alone treat another with respect. Sigh.... Plus the coffee was just flat out disgusting.,5eAYHVbAnXxhZTYM4x7UKw,0,0,1,HZLRzCpmJZ-rsjkyjRZ1IA

The owner was the one who greeted me and assisted me and I'm thankful for her dealing with my indecisiveness. Although it was a short and sweet visit, she made me feel valued by giving suggestions on what to order and making sure I liked the way my Caramel Macchiato was made. It did the job and helped me get through the night! So kudos for that.

The place was so clean, with cute Christmas decor. She suggested I'd come back to try their food items and I'm going to make that happen in the near future since everyone who did post food pics is making me salivate.",0Md3sO3sRR3GE4eQLtqZbw,0,0,5,-sjANLi3aXEcXnfVL8D3fQ

5631872,2017-12-29,0,H1ZlF8EkvE5PW_-1BP0nTg,First time here and immediately get the 'mom&pop' vibe. The staff definitely compliments this feeling. Ordered the spicy tuna sandwich. Sandwich came with a pickle and bag of chips. Delicious! The place was mostly empty at noon on a Friday but enjoyed the solitude. The location is surprisingly nice. It sits at an inside corner of an office complex and has a beautiful outside patio. I foresee coming here often to get work done in a peaceful and quiet manner :),-6NXlgvPnRQHTCYub3yVgA,0,0,5,-0Va6sIkzIuw6M8PyHfORA

The breakfast menu consists of omelette, waffle, bagels and croissant sandwiches, all small portions so this is not a place to pig out and stuff yourself with huge plates of fried bacon and sausages. The lattes were really good and the server was very friendly and had lots of patience with all our questions and special requests.",4STalMGbC_YDqaiEz2p9Cg,0,0,5,fIHdsfMAGg4myaO3UL1qQA
