We went in there about 8pm on a slooow night.  There were a handful of tables, and our table of 3.  We were seated promptly and drink orders taken right away, thus the 1 star.  From there, it all fell apart.  My mother and sister split fish and chips, and I got a sandwich and fries.  We ordered our food and sat chatting for a bit.  Then we realized, it had been 25 minutes since we ordered.  Then 30 mins.  Then 35 mins.  Then 40 minutes.  Did you have to find a river to pull the fish out?  Did you have to drive to the farm to get the potatoes for my fries?  Our waitress was no where to be found.  People who arrived after us were getting their food.  Finally our waitress made an appearance, but not at our table.  I saw her look over with an ""oh crap"" look on her face.  Then another 10 minutes later, our food came out.  I think she forgot our order, and rather than come tell us, she avoided us and then brought our food out later.  

The food was mediocre at best, and definitely NOT worth the 45-50 minute wait for it after ordering.  Our waitress never came back to refill our drinks either.  Not once.

The pasta was tasty, though could have had more garlic (I always want more garlic), and the surf and turf looked like a big juicy hunk of meat with some stuffed shrimp.  I didn't get a look at the chicken/warbird.

They had an open bar, including all the weird Trek-themed cocktails, so there were a lot of fishbowls filled with booze and dry ice wandering around.  The drinks were tasty, and entertaining on their own.

The room we were in for the reception was sort of Trek-themed like the downstairs, but not as over the top, unfortunately, but the occasional visits from a Ferengi and the appearance of a female Klingon warrior (who was apparently hunting the Ferengi) set the mood.

The addition of people who dress up as the characters really makes the experience worth trekking out to Las Vegas for.  They really get into character.

While I'm not a huge Trekkie, I did love Deep Space Nine and enjoyed Voyager quite a bit.  I even watched Enterprise when it came out, though mostly because Scott Bakula was in it.

We happened to be in Vegas the weekend of the Star Trek convention, so coming to Quark's was even more of an experience since, in addition to the people that worked there being dressed in Trekkie outfits, most of the patrons were too.

We ordered the Holy Rings of Betazed to split amongst the table and they were delicious.  After that, the trip is a little bit fuzzy since I started drinking their yummy Acturian Fizzes (Lemon Rum, 151 Rum, lemonade and strawberry puree) and drank them steadily for the next five or six hours.

Being pretty geeky myself, a large part of the reason I came here was for my Hot Nerd Quest.  I remember telling one of the actors that came to our table dressed as a Romulan about this.  When she asked if I was armed for my quest, I pointed to my substantial cleavage in a low cut shirt, and she cocked her eyebrow and said, ""Indeed.""

A friend that was with me and well past the tipsy point, was fascinated with the Borg and kept asking him if he was anatomically correct, to which he replied, ""Interface would be successful.""

It's also a plus that this place is located on the monorail, making it easy to get to, especially if you've been drinking steadily.

Between the characters in costume, the bar that looked just like Quark's in Deep Space Nine, and the tasty onion rings and even tastier drinks, I will definitely be coming here every time that I'm in Vegas, especially if the Star Trek convention is in town.

Back in the 90's I used to visit Quark's Bar during the COMDEX convention, which was timed during my birthday.  And during each visit, I'd order up a ""Liquid Latinum"" (beverage) as well as a ""HamBORGer with Cheese"".  Yes, those are the real names.  

The Liquid Latinum was delicious and I often ordered as many as 3 (and subsequently called it a day) but I often couldn't finish the whole HamBORGer which was triangular in shape and rather large and bun-laden.

""WARP CORE BREACH"" = LEGENDARY
The real highlight of the bar was the infamous Warp Core Breach, a MASSIVE multi-person drink involving dry ice and whoknowswhatelse.  When it was purchased for $29, it was always brought out to great fan fare, in the same way waitresses at Rehab bring out a Magnum of Vodka like it's a trophy to behold.

BAD NEWS:  Sadly, the Star Trek Experience has closed.  Once, one of the ONLY REASONS to go to the Las Vegas Hilton, it has now been shuttered.  They will undoubtedly lose the CES traffic that they once enjoyed during January but perhaps find a better use for the space.

Smart move on Downtown Las Vegas' part.  I'll probably go down to Downtown more often just for the memories.  Until I'd heard this, there wasn't much reason for me to go downtown other than to hit the looser tables... especially now that Andre's Downtown has closed up shop.

The themed menu was annoying, as one can only read bad puns for so long before getting disgusted. Prices were so-so, beer being cheaper than hard liquor, as expected. Took a ""Cardassian"" shot which was tasty but not too potent, since it seemed to be only a small sampling of a drink.

When the check finally came (which we requested separate b/c one person was on an expense account) the bill was together, We sighed and asked him to split it and gave him our cards. 15 minutes later we got the bills- one was 1/3 the bill and one was 2/3 the bill- unless I'm missing something, that is not splitting the bill in 1/2. And my bill was higher- who give the female the larger amount- esp when the other person is on the expense account?!?!?!?! 

Decor and the actors who were milling around, awesome
The food? mediocre.
service? The worst I've ever had- EVER (and I go out a lot and live in Baltimore)

I will never go back to this place.  It took us over 1.5hrs to get a ""quick"" lunch when the restaurant was 1/2 empty.

There were Klingons and Ferengi but I was seated and served by a bunch of mouth breathers.",dVJBtRkxFU67Vu0Ky-Vpww,1,1,1,rPjuJTXaSu0Wq_dwO7AUeg

Also, it's in the Hilton, so you can go upstairs before and/or after your fishbowl and play some $2 blackjack.  

The food is just meh, the onion rings are good, but it's really the drinks I always go for.  We stopped here for a bachelorette party once and the bartender made us all these really fun shots (complete with bartender Flair) and bought us a few rounds, too.

Minus one star for the extremely in-character Star Trek actors who always either sneak up on me and scare the crap out of my drunk ass, or hit on me (what is the name of the pervy Star Trek character with big ears??), scaring the crap out of my drunk ass.",F-S1CDwgxbGhuAffp8wX5A,5,4,4,DwVqO-Qp-8-Evu6HAjs6UQ

Romulan Ale is just blue beer. I'd hoped they'd come up with an interesting flavor. Given that the characters in the show defy the law to drink it, you'd think it must taste pretty amazing, but no, it tastes like popular cheap brand name beer you can buy anywhere.

The decor isn't pleasant. I'm not sure why anyone would want to sit around with a bunch of lumenglasses everywhere, in a darkish, noisy environment. And it's not like there's a big party all the time either.

I personally found the guys wandering around in alien costumes pretending to be real aliens to be cheezy.",MX91AkrDauRlm7t5wsGqEg,1,1,2,uT3WVgFUhyJAUhYzQKRBKA

Okay this is an odd one cause well I am not a Trekkie at all but hey I was staying at the Hilton and there was this bar so we had to drink at the home base.  Anyway, the first time we went we needed to stop and rest and grab a bite to eat.  After we played a little black jack at the $10 tables.   I know I am building up the suspense but honestly I never thought I could have so much fun in a Trekkie bar.  We met some really nice people along with the staff. We even met a few weird characters from the show.  Who by the way freaked me out, intrigued me and made me almost pee my pants!  They never break character!  Trust me we tried!  We got some apps and had a Borg Spear. I highly recommend this potent drink.  I am not sure if it is the booze or the dry ice that had me at hello.  These drinks we very yummy and put all of us right on our ass.  The next time we left the Bellagio and take a cab over to this spot just to sip on a Borg Spear.  If I could I would give this spot one of those sweet Trekki na noo na noo hand singles 5X over.",qKnH3qnjXn2qI6ktQwZc7A,1,0,5,FEr7bnZGiCmoFM-mougt_g

The Hilton is way off the strip, and the Star Trek Experience is really quite dated.  The service was not that great - the food wasn't anything special.  I ordered a ""Sulu Toss"" with chicken and shrimp - granted it was a lot of food, and looked interesting - a dome of rice with two huge breadsticks sticking out of it, and the stirfry in a moat around it, while my friend Mary ordered the Hamborger - which was just ok.

The drinks looked interesting - they had a huge shark-bowl like drink that had 10 shots worth of alcohol in it.  I ordered myself one of their non alcoholic drinks (wit Strawberry, Banana, and Pina Colada) and asked them to put some rum in it.  It was ok.

The only draw is the Klingon that walks around and mocks you and your dead food.  He definitely seemed bored with his job (possible Elvis impersonator reject?) but nonetheless, you can get your picture taken with him.",pH3TbCQDl7m7EAThzJ5MkQ,0,0,3,PxvN1ZqaH7tLKNBjqY8YBQ

During our short vacation we went to Quark's twice!  Both times we sat at the bar, enjoying the company of the other patrons (fellow geeks), the continual feed of Next Generation episodes on the flat-screen and the delicious, potent drinks.

I gotta say, I was impressed with how detailed the place was. Between the decor and the roaming characters from the show, it was pretty immersive. Our group shared the Warp Core Breach, one of the $30 drinks. If I was alone, I wouldn't pay it, but split between six people, it was reasonable and delicious! I had the prime rib & I had a taste of the flaming ribs thing, both were very good. I also tried the pasta dish & chicken dish, both were lacking & not worth the price. I reccomend splurging at this place if you want your money's worth. The beer is also good, they have mostly microbrews on tap & they're $5 each. I guess eating off the strip has its rewards ;)

Despite my hesitation, this place was well worth it. I only took a star off because of the location and prices of meals.  As other yelpers have said: whether you're a trekkie or not, you'll like this place.",L7gJwgcFiMgGx1tF2r_BRg,5,3,4,3SLB433WNi4bR0Ude3WkYw
