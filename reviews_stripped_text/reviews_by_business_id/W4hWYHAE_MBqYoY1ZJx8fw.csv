She told us we couldn't sit at a table where NO ONE WAS AT. She then moved us to a table in a corner Gave us a burnt hookah with 2 coals and a broken half a coal. Wait..., isn't this a hookah lounge ?? When we moved to another table (that other people who didn't have a bottle or anything left), she told us oh u moved ok you're going to have to deal with the with the lady when she gets here. Literally the worst place to come and it's dead anyways. AVOID MEMO LOUNGE",YsL6vAU_COmCnP0iZk0PGA,0,0,1,paT6HEVP6okf-4GEDLCXkA

For his birthday, I decided to reserve a table for his closest friends. I booked 2 tables for $300- 10 days before the event. I even came in early to show my face the night of the event , confirm the 2 tables I booked, & request which bottle was to come out first. After I revealed the surprise to my boyfriend & we enjoyed ourselves for a few hours I got the bill. The bill reflected the 2 tables I ALREADY PURCHASED  Next I cleared that up by showing the money withdrawn from my account 10 days ago. But that wasn't enough stupidity shown by them; 3 separate waitresses/waiters asked me about 5 times if I would let other people use my 2nd second table. I said sure; IF I get my money back for that table since I bought it & we are still here enjoying ourselves using it. They obviously said ""Nevermind"". I thought the service was the ABSOLUTE WORST & I'm extremely disappointed that I made plans ahead of time for a special night & the staff treated us so poorly. When I booked the tables the guy was soooo nice even stating he'd give us complimentary champagne bottles for purchasing the 2 tables in advance. Guess what? I had TO BEG FOR 1 damn bottle, I didn't bother to ask for the 2nd. I STILL GAVE A $100 tip and they continued to ask me to give up my table FOR FREE; trying to make extra sales. This is a wonderful place to come after hours, kick it, drink and leave. Not to have an event or something special planned for. The organization of this place is TRASH and I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SERIOUSLY PUT TIME INTO; they'll act like they don't know what you're talking about with their nasty attitudes.",0YIPDF96YxkKiHUOxZkvEQ,0,0,1,O3eQHiBmES8OXsOkA21G2A

5635018,2017-12-20,0,W4hWYHAE_MBqYoY1ZJx8fw,Food was good but I was over charged on my bill.  When I pointed out the overcharge I was told they haven't update the menu yet.  After refusing to pay and a bit of arguing the bill was corrected but the bait and switch tactic did not sit well with me.  Also service was very slow.,jPgcs5srQUsMWMiw-7e42A,0,0,2,YqMO6O6Wh4-Zi-vOo_-QQg

Some advice for managers. You dont have to ""turn down""the music and/or dj. Just roll off the frequencies from 1k and up. Espicially around 4k. Makes the music easier to talk over and more pleasant to listen to. Again. Would love to come back since its relatively close, open late and has a bar.",GnoMwCbQ0Dsxag7c0vP5ag,3,0,3,3zM8fbtBDYlsqq5VOzMzOg
