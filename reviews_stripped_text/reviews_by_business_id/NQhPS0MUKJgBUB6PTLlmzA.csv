Especially the gentleman who was helping me name Mo . So i was on a bit of a time crunch so i decided to call ahead for a togo order . Was inform it would be ready in 15-20 just enough time for it to be ready when i arrive. But unfortunately when i came. The order got mix up and wasnt put in. As i stood waiting . Mo must have realize how much of a rush i was in. So he very professionally came to me. Said he would take care of my meal and continues to apologize for the mix up.....now that is what i call customer service. Especially for a vietnamese resturant where most ive been to ,the service have been lack lust at best . To think about it. This was not the first time ive recieve such amazing service here. I order for take out a lot. And sometime i would order for others as well. Come to think of it. Everytime when i have a lot to carry to the car. Mo would gladly even during busy hour. Help me take my food out to the car. I can see why he is so close to a lot of the customers that comes through. Overall the staff here is wonderful whether you are dinning in. Or just taking out.

Although located off of the always bustling Spring Mountain Rd., Pho Bosa is on the cusp of what is deemed as China Town, in a section that feels more industrial than most typical restaurant goers might be accustomed to when looking for a place to dine -- but don't let that stop you from venturing into this little hole-in-the wall gem!

Inside is small and utilitarian; with just a handful of booths and a few tables -- each table having a variety of sauces to spice things up.  The wait staff is prompt, friendly, and also quite helpful. 

* Important Note:  The men's and women's restrooms are located outside of the establishment itself, in a hallway immediately outside of the back exit. -- I admit, at night it can be a bit spooky. So, if you're a big wuss like me...have a friend tag along! 

My friend and I both ordered vermicelli bowls -- one a combination of grilled pork, shrimp cake, fried rolls, and a side order of grilled shrimp -- the other bowl had chicken and short ribs.  And for starters, an order of Fresh Spring Rolls.

In all fairness and truth, let me just say, I've never met a vermicelli bowl that I didn't like! :) 

And, Pho Bosa did not disappoint! The bowls are large, the salad crisp, and all of the meats were flavorful and grilled to perfection.  Also, the shrimp cake is quite fantastic -- beautiful color, taste, and texture; a nice add-on to any meal.

Spring Rolls: They're okay. I can't say that they're particularly special, they don't have much going on in terms of flavor -- but I will say that I do enjoy the crunchy texture that the fried wrapper adds. 

I'll Be Back!!! :)",V94FH6txigqE3ouUHBJJLA,1,1,4,nCp5RVMmKTi9Zi0uCstdGQ

So my party got split, but that doesn't change the fact that it still took half an hour to get our food even though we ordered right away. It should not take more than 10min to bring out a bowl of pho. We were never checked on again.

Restaurant is in a sketchy neighborhood.

Came back today. Overall price is high and the food quality is low. It is not clean.
1. Food quality - 1*. I ordered shrimp eggroll. The shrimp vein was not removed. As far as I considered,  this is equivalent to shrimp shit (see photos). Not acceptable. The shrimp cake inside color was not oink. It means that it was mixed with lot of fish paste. It lacked the firmness of real shrimp cake (see photos). There was almost no meat in the meat loaf (see photo).
There was no ""thinh"" in the porkskin/shreddedpork. This is not acceptable.
2. Cleanlines - 1*. The 2 out of 3 servers worn disposable kitchen aprons. They also worked in the kitchen. The aprons were dirty and they kept wearing them (see photo). 
3. Price is high - 1*. I ended up paying 24 dollars for side if meatbsll, 2 pieces of eggroll and a rice dish. 
4. Pho broth was terrible. From the smell, it stinks of beef bones instead flavor full from the brisket. It means that they substitute meat for stinking bones. 

They charged everything that is supposed to be free in an authentic Pho restaurant such as sliced onion or a small amount of extra soup.

Place was pretty simple, we wanted to eat fresh spring rolls which you can find at any Vietnamese restaurant but they didn't have those, they had their own version of a spring roll which was OK, but there's no reason why they can't offer regular spring rolls. Anyways, we ordered pho and it arrived after about 10-15 minutes, and honesty, it was just OK. After reading the reviews, we expected much better. I've had better pho in Boston, Orlando and New York.  Our server was kind, but we won't be back.",Gq2HNHxp8ISK62f3scAL8A,0,0,2,k_i7xYOOq7LF--I-1vWDsw

The soup was excellent,  not too salty and very tasty. The noodles were in good proportion as well as the meat. Definitely get the pork sausage rolls though.  The sauce they make for is tops it off!

If you use Apple maps, it will get you in the vicinity but you have to a bit harder to find this little establishment.  
Three of us ordered Pho and two ordered Bun Bo Hue. Three of us agreed that the soup in pho was lacking the depth in flavor that we would normally find in Little Saigon.  The other two who ordered Bun Bo Hue had favorable comments - highly recommended.  Therefore, the next time we go here will be for the BBH.

Water - Please add reverse osmosis filter.  The water was awful!

We crave pho sometimes and this is the only place we love.

We usually start with the crispy vegetable rolls and they come with a vegetarian sauce on the side. The order comes with five crispy fried vegetable rolls. On the big plate it has large leaf lettuce, cilantro, mint, pickled shredded veg, and sliced cucumber.
(I wanted a side of peanut sauce but she said ""oh no that sauce has chicken in it""....pass :( 

We get the vegetarian pho and its is verrrry yummy. It is a surprisingly full flavored broth and the large bowl comes loaded with noodles, broccoli, fried tofu, green onions, and bok choy.

We also sometimes get the Noodle Salad Bowl it comes with your choice of meat so we get the fried tofu. The bowl  has noodles, shredded lettuce, pickled shredded veg, cucumber, dark purple Thai basil, fried tofu, and whole peanuts. I usually add the fresh mint and cilantro to the bowl. Sometimes I ask for a side of the vegetarian sauce and put a little on it.

Between the vegan pho and the vegan noodle salad bowl it's always a hard choice between the two because they are both good!

Their food is fresh and full of flavor. The vegetables are clean and snappy fresh and the service is always quick and pleasant always with a smile.

1375830,2013-07-09,2,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,"Last year, a sad day had fallen upon the Las Vegas community when word of Bosa 1, the amazing Vietnamese restaurant, would be closing its doors. To many peoples, including myself, this restaurant opened my eyes to the ""other"" world of Vietnamese cuisine... one which did not include pho. Here was the first time I had tried broken rice, bbq, and stir fried noodle dishes, that I have since tried at many other restaurants, but have not seen executed to the same high standard. What I missed most about Bosa 1 was that they did make, without a doubt, the best Bun Bo Hue in the Valley.

I was ecstatic to hear that the owner's were opening a new restaurant in Las Vegas called Pho Bosa, which would carry all of the items that Bosa 1 carried, as well as pho. Having procrastinated enough (they have been open for several months), I decided to check out the new location.

Pho Bosa is located on the intersection of Spring Mountain and Polaris. It is right next door to the 702 bar (for now anyways.. that bar has also been the Bikini Bar, and previously before that, the Sand Dollar Blues Lounge) There is plenty of parking, and you really can't miss the sign. After coming in, I was seated immediately by the hospitable host/server. After quickly looking over the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted. It was the dish I was missing the most.. Bun. Bo. Hue. I got a fried egg roll for an extra 1.50. After receiving my water and little side dish of thai basil, bean sprouts, and lime for my soup, my spring roll and soup was brought to me shortly thereafter. 

Egg Roll - crispy wonton shell with pork and veggies on the inside. The flavors tasted really well balanced and the shell wasn't too greasy. A little bit small, but tasted good.

Bun Bo Hue - For many of you who have never eaten anything but pho, and really want to try some of the other dishes of Vietnam (and have a liking for spicy foods), I really urge you to try Bun Bo Hue. At Pho Bosa, they make it really well. You can taste the ginger, lemongrass and shrimp in the broth. The chili oil that is mixed in the broth gives it a nice kick! The noodles are more thicker and rounder than ones you see in pho. The beef was tender, and so were the pig's knuckles. Don't be too put off by the congealed pigs blood. It doesn't have a metallic taste you find in beef blood, and IMO, the flavor was very neutral, almost like a tofu. One knock, I wish the broth could have been saltier (but maybe that's because i've been eating a lot ramen in the past year.. it has increased my sodium resistance).

Can't wait to come back and try their broken rice, and grilled specialties. I'm also curious to try their pho, and see how it stacks up against other pho places. The service here was also good.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,13,7,4,o00dPxMtDZwhBjVLlAEB3A

The good news is that the two dishes above are awesome. Rolls (#1, $5.50) have a great mix of meaty pork patty plus crunchy fried onion and fresh lettuce for a medley of flavors and textures. Bun Rieu (#79, $9) is a crab and tomato soup (with plentiful portions of both!), plus noodles, fried tofu pieces, and cilantro and fried onion for garnish. It is so dang good, hearty but not heavy, my new go-to dish here.. and I'll be on the lookout for it elsewhere now, too.

But they're primarily a pho restaurant, and the #70 we ordered (their basic house specialty?) was pretty plain with a light broth that needed the extra condiments and fresh herbs. Soup portions are enormous, with huge bowls of broth and more meat and noodles than many other places. Regulars seem to find very specific dishes to get here rather than recommending everything offered. 

TIPS: Closed Mon and Tues, $25 card minimum (dang!), and no split checks. Despite those inconveniences and the sketchy location, I will keep coming back.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,11,4,nEopCfUzQsGG7kDxzdOK5g

Pho Bosa boasts a pretty decent menu, I stuck with large (one size) Pho dac biet- the combo with meatballs, fatty brisket, flank, tripe and tendon usually. This version lacked the tripe but that's ok, everyone has their own way of making it. Broth was pretty good- not the best I have had but hit the spot for the craving we both had that day. It'll do the trick for hangovers, hints of a cold, late night food, and much more. It's a comfort food for many Asians and Americans so I know they'll do just fine with business being so close in proximity to the strip (you'll still need a car or taxi though). We also ordered the Nem Nuong (spring roll) which is another of my favorites. Brisk service and quick food-to-table. The only weird part was paying for our meal. They brought an ipad to the table to run the card and then straight up asked what we wanted to leave for tip. Very strange and kind of rude! I like the privacy of deciding myself and selecting it.

This involved a weird detour-ladden walk (~2.5 miles!) that included walking across a highway. It was cold, treacherous, and totally worth it. 

But take my advice: don't walk. Just take a cab. Seriously. Unless you're also ridiculous, in which case, hi!! :) :) :)

The service was awesome, though I think our waiter isn't one of the full-time ones. He asked if we had been there before, and when we told him we hadn't, he explained all the dishes to us and gave us his recommendations!

We got the #11 broken rice combo with grilled pork, which was absolutely delicious. I haven't had ""shrimp cake"" before, but it was oh-so-good in all the right ways.

We also got the Bun Bo Hue, which was very flavorful and delicious. (I did my research and tried this at another restaurant before posting this review, and while the other restaurant's food was yummy, the Bun Bo Hue here was the winner!) The waiter described this to us as ""spicy soup"".

Bun Rieu was also very good (waiter just called this ""crab soup"").

[[The waiter kept checking on us at this point to ask if we needed a box, since we were a party of 2 and had ordered 3 entrees. We finished them. Cuz we're awesome. I think he was confused.]]

The waitress that was working that night processed our bill on an iPad. We asked about which taxis were good, but I think she got confused because she just left without responding. The waiter that had been helping us came back later to refill our waters and offered to call us a cab when he figured out that we didn't have a car.

Pros: The pho broth, which is the most important element to a pho dish, was correctly stewed with beef bones and spices. It was well-balanced and aromatic.  The bun bo hue also had all of the correct ingredients--blood cubes and all. 

Cons: Lemon instead of lime was served with the pho, likely due to increased lime costs. However, the lime is irreplaceable. Also, most of the bun bo hue I've eaten in my day is several levels hotter. This one was only mild-medium spicy; not nose running spicy as I've experienced before.

Forgive me for not having proper combo names;
Pork Summer Rolls: really good, fresh tasting. The veggies were crumchy and the sausage was flavorful. The peanut sauce was a nice touch as well. Not a thick thai-satay style sauce, but thin with a touch of vinegar. 
Grilled Chicken platter with shrimp cake and egg roll: AMAZING. Can chicken really taste this good? I wasn't sure that I'd like the shrimp cake at first, but the taste was amazing- not at all mushy like I had expected. The egg roll left much to be desired, but I overlooked that.
Combination Pho: Brisket, raw thin sliced beef, tendon, and beef balls. The soup was really nice and light- perfect if you like your soup plain or gives you plenty of room for ""improvement"" if you like mixing your soup to taste. 

The service was what really put this place over the top.

Left out from my previous review but dont feel like editing it. 
Number 15 on the drinks. Sua Dau Nanh La Dua (soy bean milk with pandan leaf)
It's been a long time since i've had soy bean milk and the kind with pandan leaf is a rare treat. So i was expecting a can of Yeo brand soya milk with pandan leaf that comes from Singapore i think. When they released this flavor i used to not drink a can but inhale a can. Anyway what i was brought out was in a togo container. Punching the straw through and taking a sip i realized that holy shit this is home made soy bean with pandan extract added. Nice!! not overly sweet but not bland either. Could have used more pandan leaf extract but i'm just weird like that.

Alright back to today. Well if i'm gonna order something with the intent to review it i might as well order it big:
Number 11. Tau Hu Ky, Bi Cha with number 16 Thit Nuong
(shrimp cake, shredded pork loin, pork quiche with additional grilled pork)

The portion size is pretty big and the meal itself was quite tasty and impressive. The grilled pork was the tastiest on the plate. Marinated quite well and the thin cuts absorbed enough seasonings to be both tasty but not dry and rubbery and doesn't get in those hard to reach places in your teeth.

Service was good, very polite staff, water and tea came out quickly. And I liked that their tea was dark, stronger than other places, some places very you very light tea, like... just yellow water. 

Some cons:
-waited 30 minutes for our food 
-they do not split checks - the table next to us wanted to split and the waitress simply said ""no"" lol

At the behest and strong recommendation of a fellow foodie/yelper, we made time during a recent Vegas trip to try out more places off the strip.  Thankfully, Pho Bosa ended up on our list as the visit and meal was truly memorable.

LOCATION:  In a fairly nondescript shopping complex not too far from the strip.  Since it was SOCLOSE, we decided to venture to the restaurant without the aide of a navigation app or device.  Long story of a short drive:  We arrived without incident at our destination 10 minutes prior to opening.

SETTING/AMBIANCE:  The restaurant is quite cozy, and has a very home-like feel to it.  Very casual.  A mix of tables and booths make up the seating area.

FOOD:  Since it was my first time, I chose to let my friend take the lead in ordering.  And speaking the of food, the menu is massive.  Many selections of drinks, appetizers, food combos (chicken, pork, sausage, etc.), and pho.  We shared the springs rolls and we each ordered the Bun Bo Hue pho.  

The pork sausage spring rolls were quite good and were the perfect start to our meal.  As for the pho, though the Bun Bo Hue is served spicy, I admit I was a coward and requested a mild broth. And sans the infused pork blood as well.  I wasn't sure how my stomach would handle such a thing.  The entire bowl seemed massive to me when the server dropped it off the food at our table.  But, I saw, I ate, and I conquered my pho.  The rice noodles, beef shank, pork, onions, herbs, and lime in the lemongrass beef broth was simply delicious.

SERVICE:  Decent service.  Not bad but not fantastic.  The server checked on us throughout the meal and readily provided water refills.

CAFFEINE:  This was also my first time trying Vietnamese coffee.  All I can say is that I was WIDE AWAKE after the meal.  

BOTTOM LINE:  It was pretty good, and I'm sure it will be good pho others too.  I shall return!",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,11,10,4,6qqH-R7WvqQl5F5y4_q_4Q

Entering as a party of 6, there was one party inside of the restaurant.. meaning a lot of tables were available. First, they had seated us in a tight, claustrophobic corner. As we asked to be seated elsewhere, the owner's husband had placed our menus then rudely pointed out that we could sit at this 8 seater table, BUT said ""you all have to move when people come in.""  

???????

My parents are people who do not complain if they were to receive a wrong order. However, after this experience, it's unfortunate that Pho Bosa had lost a solid set of loyal customers. 

It is solid if you have delicious, presentable food, but if your customer service does not compensate, it's unfortunate. :-(",96xXuvVkvyt8IoQES21-GQ,6,0,1,l0czvp0SBtUzsq6JLyUw1g

The size is really a medium  (it's a large bowl with 3/4 full).  
Service was great, friendly and attentive.  The waiter checked in on me twice.  I don't need much attention.

Second time here, and this time with the family so tried more dishes than last time. Bf's pho tai bo vien literally had three slices of tai in it. The broth was just ok. I had the bun bo hue again, but this time it was less spicy, with less noodles (that were too soft), and no pork blood cubes. Also the beef slices were too hard, but the tendon and pork hock was nice and tender.

We also got two com dishes. The egg rolls are very thin and hardly any filling. The egg quiche is dry and bland. Huge mound of rice though!

I also got my favorite drink, the salted lemonade, but they didn't make it salty. Too sweet. It was $3 for a small foam cup mostly filled with ice.

So for $75 for 6 people and small portions. Also consider that two of the people were 6 and 11 yrs old that hardly eat. The adults ate all the food the kiddos didn't bc there wasn't enough on our dishes to satisfy; even grandma who barely eats was eating off of the kiddo's plate.

Overall, they don't offer anything that I can't make better at home. But this place is def better than Viet Bistro.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,5,3,2,8bSkOWggBHw9AeXJ-Sf29w

I got the scaled down version by one item I believe but the highlight or thing most looking forward too besides the Short RIbs (Kalbi) was the quiche. Now it been while since I had any kind of quiche. Vietnamese restaurant? Who would have thought be without question best little piece of quiche ever had in Vegas. There also was the spring rolls that was not only cooked too perfection, nice crispy on outside till golden brown, and filling hot moist and again delicious on the inside. Not even talking about shredded pork along with couple sliced cucumbers and kind of carrot salad. Soo much going on with all these components on any of the broken rice plates. All that is going on what truly stands OUT is each part could see having whole plate of just by itself!!!!! Talk about filling any one of these broken rice plates sure getting  money worth. I not able too finish all my rice because really the whole bottom of the plate or just about had rice. Me growing up on rice loving every scoop of it!  The Kalbi might not be as meaty as other more local style restaurants but smaller ones feel so much more flavor packed in it. The marinade they do is fabulous! Not too sweet but just the right amount of balance. Broken rice plates see lot more in my future.

The service yet again on top of it. They were even helpful came too my first time ordering broken rice dish explaining too me use the fish sauce over the rice and the shredded pork. I would have never thought of if they never suggested it! It small place but think started up right now never bad time too go. So if never been too Pho Bosa you should give it try.

Just yesterday I had a nice portion of Gà Nuóng(Grilled chicken), along with some egg rolls, rice and vermicelli noodles.Amazing food, you can clearly differentiate the strong flavors, the portion are very big and the staff is very polite and helpful.The inside decor it's quite raw, but as I realized, many of their customers are coming for the Pho, the perfect remedy for hangovers after a long drinking night, so the surrounding won't be a problem.What I don't like is that the drinks are coming in transparent plastic cups instead of real glass ones, but this minor issue won't make me give them less than 5 stars.

The pho is Pho-Kim-Long-priced ($10) and just mediocre. After a few spoonfuls I was regretting not choosing to go to a ramen place instead. A pretty bad situation, considering I was actually in the mood for pho when I got here, and their pho convinced me otherwise. And there I was sitting in front of a big bowl of boring pho.

I have to note that the bathroom is in an outside hallway of the adjoining strip mall / office complex. Weird and probably not the safest scenario at night, considering the low-rent industrial area this restaurant is in, just near West of the Las Vegas strip. Think Commercial Center (on Sahara) where Lotus of Siam is, and then imagine having to go outside to use the bathroom. Weird, right?

I have to say that I was genuinely impressed. I will definitely be coming back very soon, probably tonight :) 

On to the other things, prices are reasonable considering how many viet establishments are on spring mountain.

Usually service in these types of asian restaurants I have found to be horrible or subpar in my past experiences, definitely a plus for me. Restaurant is very clean, which is good.

First thing that I want to emphasize is the staff! Immediately when I walked in I was greeted with some excitement and appreciation from a lady and gentleman. I'm assuming this is a family owned business as they seem to be running the show. As I sat and looked through the menu I could hear them greet their repeated guest. Always with a smile and excited to be able to serve them again. This is when I realized I'm going to immediately enjoy my experience. When owners genuinely appreciates a new comer the same way they appreciate their regular customers gives me a sense of happiness. This let's me know the business is more than just a building it's a place to build long lasting relationship and memories.

Now let's get down to business! Let's talk about what we came here for which is the Pho! This place provides a huge bowl of Pho! One of the biggest servings here in Las Vegas so if your hungry this will definitely fill your empty stomach! I ordered the Oxtail Pho and boy was my tummy happy! The Oxtail was nice and soft! It was so soft it was falling of the bone! The broth was outstanding! It definitely stood out and differentiated itself from other Pho's I have tried in the valley! 

They serve specialty drinks here such as the cococane which is sugar cane with coconut. This drinks was so good! It was very refreshing and had such an addicting factor that makes you want to keep drinking. It felt like my body was getting all the nutrition needed to get rehydrated! This drink is a must in my opinion. Only place I know that serves it.

Service wasn't great. When my party of 5 arrived, no one greeted us. When we were escorted to our table, the chairs were all dirty so we had to ask them to clean them before we sat down. It took them a while to come over and clean the chairs before my parents and sister could sit down. 

A local sitting nearby told us the pho wasn't great and that the best thing on the menu was the com tam (broken rice plates). I was feeling bun bo hue, but was told they were out for the holidays. (Highly disappointed because that was the only reason I chose this place!) My sister and I were reduced to ordering $8.50 bun rieu bowls and my hubby and parents ordered $10.99  com tam bowls. We waited 15 minutes for the bun rieu. The bun rieu was super bland, so I asked for shrimp paste. The owner totally ignored my request and we had to ask another waitress to bring it over for us. The com tam didn't appear until another 15 minutes after the bun rieu. However, the local was right. The com tam was pretty good. (Almost comparable with Com Tam Thanh in Santa Ana/Orange County, CA). However, the com tam was missing the bowl of soup that usually comes with this meal.

2595408,2016-07-06,28,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,"Pho Bosa's newer, larger & even better restaurant! Congrats on the new location!

Come here for authentic Vietnamese comfort food. Everything is fresh, made from scratch & most importantly made with love! There isn't anything that I don't like here; but if I have to give suggestions, here are my favorites:

I am obsessed with their Bun Rieu (Vietnamese crab, tofu & tomato noodle soup) it tastes just like how my mom makes it at home. Hooked up with lots of goodies in a balanced savory broth! I refuse to eat this dish anywhere else (except home.) Noone else compares (except for momma.) Flavor rating: 5/5

You will not eat a better bowl of Bun Bo Hue  (Vietnamese style spicy beef noodle soup) anywhere else in Vegas. Trust me, I've tried several places and keep coming right back (multiple times a week.) It's as authentic as you'll taste at a restaurant. All of the meat in the Bun Bo Hue soup is super tender; they have lots of buttery brisket, huge chunks of flavorful ham hock, even the coagulated pig blood tastes flavorful and fresh (which I don't even typically like to eat, kind of freaks me out at times), and they also include very yummy pork roll sausage loaf too - just to name a few goodies. But that's just the tip of the iceberg; the rich broth is flavored with just the right amount of spiciness, saltiness, sweetness, definitely umami. Oh and the fresh lemongrass stalks infused into the broth just knocks it out of the park! You can really tell someone in the kitchen cares about their cuisine and tastes everything, multiple times. Flavor rating: 5/5

Other items that we can't get enough of are the Nem Nuong Cuon (pork patty spring rolls) - the dipping sauce is key and they have perfected it; it's slightly thick, perfectly sweet, extremely flavorful and addictive. Also the fried egg roll wrapper inside of the spring roll is always a nice surprise and adds such an incredible texture and crunch. You can certainly compare these spring rolls with the world famous Brodard in Orange Country, CA - they are on the same level. Flavor rating: 5/5

I also love their Com Tam (broken rice) dishes - we normally get the combo: Com Tam, Bi, Cha, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio (broken rice, shredded pork skin, pork egg quiche, grilled pork, and egg rolls) they also bring out some hot and comforting soup broth to sip with the rice dish. So good!!! We go to town on the plate as everything is so flavorful and freshly prepared. Its more than enough food for us to share, but we get greedy, so we always order something else (Bun Bo Hue) so we can have the best of both worlds. This is the best place that I've had Com Tam in Vegas so far and I've lived here for over half a year now and tried many places. Flavor rating: 5/5

What keeps us coming back - The food! Also the cook/owner Vanessa is so sweet and humble. We love complimenting her often on her food. She is originally from California (Orange County) so she knows what the food scene in ""Bolsa""/Little Saigon tastes like and the fierce competition out there. She brings her love for food and ""A"" game to Vegas and we are so thankful she did!!

PRO TIP: I also love requesting for their spicy sate sauce and always add a spoonful into all of my food. It kicks everything up few notches in the heat and flavor department and I love a good kick in the pants.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,37,39,5,GfmOPBJtjY9nGO7lbjtONg
2596894,2018-06-21,0,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,Hole in the wall but the oxtail soup was fantastic. Huge oxtail portions were perfectly tender. Took the meat off the bone with a plastic spoon.

I came here with my girls for a bowl of yummy noodles, or at least I thought that's what I was coming here for. Sigh another one of the few times that yelp has failed me.. TERRIBLY. I want to tell you that it pains me to write this review.  I hate leaving bad reviews for little hole in the wall Asian places, but damn the food here was REALLY really bad.. I should have known a 4 star Vietnamese place would have really been a unicorn (they don't exist).  Most 3.5 star Vietnamese places have BOMB ass good food, and its just the service that sucks. But when you want a fast noodle fix, who cares about service? I don't! Give me a good hot bowl of soup and i'm happy as a clam.

The service was decent, and they were kind enough to let us know a table for our party of 7 would be a few minutes. But They also charged us for gratuity for a party of 7 without letting us know first. You don't even have your own bathroom inside the restaurant, we need to walk outside to use the community bathroom and the door is so ghetto my girlfriend got stuck inside because you need to lift the door to escape that dungeon of a bathroom. Even McDonald's has their own bathrooms inside the restaurant, and they sure don't charge gratuity. Mcdonalds over Pho Bosa? Just something to think about. 

We ordered the pork egg rolls, shrimp rolls and nem rolls. All three appetizers were eh, nem rolls were pretty disappointing but still edible.. on yelp people were ranting and raving about the Bun Bo Hue and the ""home made"" hotsauce so 5/7 of us ordered the Bun Bo hue, One ordered the Bun Rieu, and One Vermicelli noodles.

When the noodles came I was pretty excited. It looked like it had flavor and it would taste good. First sip without adding any sauce. The broth was DISGUSTING!!!! The red color that would give the appearance of flavor and depth in the broth was a SCAM. The red color was achieved by using a CHEATING method. The soup tasted like PAPRIKA and had an under cooked tomato paste sour tangy taste !!! The authentic soup base does not even call for Paprika, OR Tomato paste . Your cooks decided to cut the corners instead of cooking the anatto seed down with oil and shallots and garlic to extract the color and flavors. You want to question me? I cook everything home made, so I sure do know what its supposed to taste like and the actual ingredients in Bun Bo Hue. I sipped one sip of my friends Bun Rieu and same thing, lacking flavor and depth but at least that one was edible. The soup looked so grey and colorless, again, did someone forget anatto seeds? Flavorless soup would have given you no review at all, but when your soup tastes like dry powder, no depth and was so gross, I left the entire bowl there after 3 bites, you have a serious problem on your hands. I DO NOT WASTE FOOD PERIOD. 

""home made"" hot sauce? HA that's another joke. Bun Bo Hue is supposed to be served with Lemon grass hot sauce , and also have lemon grass in the broth. There was no lemongrass flavor to be found anywhere. Yes I make my own hot sauces at home as well.

Mam ruoc (shrimp paste) was also just room temperature and sitting out on the table. It was stinky as it should be, but the stank came more from it being spoiled and left out too long

Fish sauce - very watered down, no flavor, wheres the garlic and chili peppers that should have been infused with it?

We were winding down our weekend in Vegas, and we didn't want to bother or wait for replacement food. The bill came up to $139, $20 per person including 15% gratuity. Not worth the precious real estate in my tummy, or even a penny.

I never NEVER thought I would say this, but I would rather eat at Pho Kim Long than here. And that place is pretty garbage too lol. The #1 worst viet food in LV goes to Pho Bosa!  Congratulations!

About $5 gets you two springs rolls with seemingly the perfect ratio of the pork sausage, greens, and the rest of the filling inside.  Each bite had a nice crisp crunch to it followed by the savoriness of the pork.  I would get this again and again.  

The pho was fine, albeit, there was a desire for more.  I did not notice 'more meat' than other places as some reviews have claimed.  The slices of rare steak  that came in my particular bowl of pho actually over cooked itself by the time it was placed in front of me.  Still not a bad bowl of pho.

The actual restaurant is quite small with only a few tables so I can see it being busy and packed on a weekend.  We arrived early for lunch on a weekday and there was only 2 other customers there.  Sweet!  The service was fine and we never really had to worry about our waters being refilled or flagging the server for the check.

2748063,2013-03-04,0,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,"I don't understand why we didn't make this our first stop when we drove into Vegas.  Pulling into the place, it really does not look like it's a restaurant and it's surprising it's still around.  But when you walk in, rest assured that this is the most authentic Vietnamese food you can get in Vegas.  We had our first Vietnamese meal in one of the hotels on the strip and were sorely disappointed (I'll review their butts later when I remember what it was called).  The Vegas hotel/casino had Filipino fish sauce, unmixed, for the pork chop.  The pork chop was poorly seasoned, and the bean sprouts were BROWN.  WTF.  

But Bosa, omG.  Having driven 10 hours from San Jose, CA to get here, it was a blessing to have it before we went back onto the road to come back.  The food here is as authentic as the Bay Area if not better.  We had pho, bun rieu, and com suon.  The smell, texture, everything was right.  I was jumping for joy because the mints and bean sprouts were FRESH, CRISP.  And we sat there thinking, where the hell do you grow this kind of thing in the middle of a desert?  Beautifully hefty portions of top round, tendon, beef stomach, *drool ....* And they had all the mints - all of them!  Where do you get that here?????

Service is fast, it comes out piping hot, and the coffee is Vietnamese style to the last drop.  And even in Vegas, this place is cheaper than some places in the Bay Area, gladly takes credit card (most hardcore Asian places here don't).  3 of us plus coffee was like $30 after tip - BEAUTIFUL.  Next time we go, we're going here first.  We're picky because we are spoiled from having easy access to good Vietnamese food here.  

I saw a couple of negative reviews about this place - you guys are smoking crack.  This place is authentic, really.  This is coming from a guy who eats in Little Saigon in the Bay and in SoCal.",XUV0MeZewKrsU6N7oBJN0Q,1,0,5,vGQeXjsvj8guDUIHLOFX1w

Went on a Sunday just before noon and the place was packed. It is a tiny spot and they have signs warning it's not a fast food kind of place meaning don't expect in and out quickly, just in case you're in a rush.  We waited for about 25 minutes so you might as well grab a menu and figure out what you want to order, which is what I did and just chatted up with the staff to figure out how it worked. The broken rice and bun section may seem a little confusing but the staff was able to explain it to me.

 I believe the owner took our order and we were impressed she was able to remember our appetizers, drinks and entrees without writing it down. I ordered pork spring rolls and egg rolls to share. Their spring rolls are very similar to the Brodards with the sauce but was expecting 4 whole rolls not 2 rolls cut into 4 pieces. They were decent though prefer Brodards since Brodards I feel has more ingredients and there's more rolls. The egg rolls were also decent though I would have preferred more herbs and the egg rolls I've had at other places I feel have more meat (due note my standard is Orange County Vietnamese food so it's a bit biased).   

One of my friends got pho, which was huge portion and the other 2 both got different broken rice dishes, which all were big portions and all looked yummy, while I got bun #45, which was also huge and that one comes with grilled pork and egg rolls.  The grilled pork was solid though their style bun seem to have more of a lemon grass flavor to it. Dishes aren't served at the same time and I was the last to receive mines, so the food is hot when you receive so I insisted my friends eat first.

The pho at this restaurant is so cheap, big portions, and super authentic. My friend and I shared a large pho with rare steak and beef balls. I wasn't super hungry so it was just the right size for both of us. The broth was super good and not too oily. I also really liked the beef balls and thought that they had really good flavor. The rare steak was okay, but I don't really order that normally anyway. 

They also had a bunch of flavored teas that looked really good - passionfruit mango with chia seeds, etc. The yelp deal is only good for weekdays so if you come on the weekends it will be regular price! My friend got the number 9 - the flavor was good but a bit too sweet for me.

2837536,2012-12-05,3,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,"Pho Bosa is definitely a local treasure when it comes to home-style Vietnamese grub.  I reviewed this humble eatery based on the merits of their Bun Bo Hue back in their old location (Bosa 1) and since their move have had the opportunity to sample additional selections including Bun Rieu and their broken rice plates, and have never been disappointed.  

Bun Bo Hue- rustic and spicy lemongrass beef broth with chewy round bucatini-like rice noodles and a complex assortment of flavors and textures from the plethora of meat components (beef shank, pork knuckle, beef tendon, ginger infused pork blood cake) topped with an array of crunchy shredded cabbage and fresh herbs), no mouthful is the same from start to finish.  Definitely the best rendition in town.   

Bun Rieu- an umami tsunami of chicken broth with thin rice vermicelli, fried tofu, fresh tomato, and a mixture of crabmeat /egg topped with crispy shallots, green onion.  Served piping hot, this is an optimal winter dish with a lot of minimally ""masticatory"" (for lack of a better made-up word) components meant to be swirled together on the tongue with interplay of sweet, savory, and even floral (there is some mystery herb in this soup that is reminiscent of shiso leaf).

Broken rice plates- It may sound like the aftermath of a Greek wedding, but these are the Vietnamese cousins of the American meat and 3 sides.  The rice are fractured grains broken during the cleaning/harvesting of the rice, originally considered peasant food, but now having a wave of popularity due to its unique texture and flavor evoking the nuttiness of basmati and the butteriness of arborio in a solid risotto.   Accompanying the rice is a savory shrimp cake wrapped in impossibly crispy tofu skin, a delicate egg quiche, shredded pork loin, some pickled veggies and your protein of choice (I recommend the Korean beef short ribs or the grilled pork chop).  Drizzle all the above with their fish sauce made in house, and you will not want to stop eating until the last grain of rice is scooped off the plate.

When we were ready to pay the bill, we were going to pay with both cash and credit card. She said they don't ""split checks"" and so we couldn't pay that way. We told her we weren't asking for split checks and we understood that they charge for gratuity for large parties. But she just said NO. Right before leaving, my friend asks for a bag and she drops it on the counter. My friend (by this time,she's had enough of this lady's rudeness) asked if she was ok. Asian lady said she was tired and so my friend said she should go home as she thinks it's not good that she's putting it on customers who are there to eat.

Food here isn't bad by any means.. it just missed the mark by a little bit for everything.

Pho Dac Biet comes in one size- large. I can't eat a large, and I've never been to a legit Vietnamese place that doesn't give you the option. Pho Dac Biet also does not have tripe in it, and their actual pho menu is quite small.

Speaking of me being salty already, the broth was so salty that I couldn't convince myself to continue eating my pho since it was borderline unenjoyable. I told the older gentleman working, and like all great chefs, he didn't seem very appreciative of my criticism. If you are trapped in the same situation, make sure you ask for a side of hot water to go with it.

Fried egg rolls were good but nothing spectacular. Their filling includes a lot of vegetable, and I like meat and Asian mushroom fillings for my Vietnamese egg rolls.

I've been to Vietnam and it has my favorite food anywhere in the world, and prices about 1/20th of what you'll pay at any hole in the wall in the US, so it's hard for me to give anywhere 5 stars.

3316049,2015-06-24,0,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,"Im shocked at how many positive reviews this place has received. If I could give 0 stars, I really, really would, Before you decide to come here based of the good reviews this place has received take a moment to read this one. I've been to many pho places and I have never been more disappointed by pho than I was here. Since it is in Las Vegas, I didn't expect the pho to be extraordinary, but I also didn't think it would be a complete bust. Sadly, it was the latter. Save yourself some time and do not come here. 

First off, the food itself. it takes ""10-20 minutes"" for your pho to come out ( I ordered #70 combination) according to a lengthy sign that gives a sad excuse for their slow service. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, believing that the time was lengthy to ensure quality. When the food arrived, I was horrified. The bowl looked plain and and somewhat incomplete. Here was the breakdown of what I got: 

The broth - decent, hardly any flavor
Noodles- tasted as though they just came out of an instant packet. They were not chewy and tasted stale. 
Meat- unlike most places, Bosa gives you suspicious looking meat that tastes as though it has been sitting in the pot for a little too long. There also wasn't much meat either.
Onions- you want more of it? Here's an extra $1 charge. No thank you. 


Next complaint is the service. Our waitress came to our table with little professionalism and an irritated look on her face. She took 10 minutes to bring out our water and forgets the soda. One of my friends notices that the sriracha looked a little off color so she checks the bottle. It had expired in APRIL, and we were eating end of June. She took it to the front desk and the man merely apologizes and adds that all the sriracha comes from the same box. I'm baffled by this statement, as if it was supposed to make us feel any better. Not only was out sriracha expired, everyone else's in the restaurant was too. If this restaurant believes it is okay to be cutty about its regulations and attempt to serve customers expired sauce, your best bet is they they are doing some other shady things in the kitchen. 

Lastly, some other important things I've noticed:

1. Bowls only come in one size, which they consider a 'large' but really comes out with regular sized potions.
2. You cannot split the bill.
3. Automatic gratuity for larger parties. I know many places do this, but my guess is they do this to squeeze every last drop out of you.
4. The lengthy sign about not being a 'fast food' restaurant. Sorry, but slapping a nonsensical sign on the wall as an excuse for slow service doesn't cut it. Pho is always fast, and if it isn't, it better wow my taste buds. The sign also notes that your wait time could DOUBLE if the restaurant is busy. That's 20-40 minutes waiting in a small cramped restaurant with no more than 10 tables. What a sad excuse to avoid hungry impatient customers. 

I hope that my lengthy and detailed review has convinced you to search elsewhere to satisfy your pho cravings. Don't be disappointed the way I was. If you love pho as much as I do, STAY CLEAR!!",Z0u0tt-bg3yqtzSaSZQ-lA,2,0,1,K-JZDPTCaYGczJZYHuS7UA

We walked in and was greeted immediately by a gentleman, smiling and showing us to our seats. He brought out the menu and asked for our drink orders right way. He recommended the Vietnamese iced Coffee but we passed on it. 

The pho broth is probably the better if not the best in the Las Vegas area but then again, I've only had pho at 4 other places in LV. Plenty of meat and veggies. I didn't have to use a lot of condiments. 

Our waitor gave us a sample of the iced coffee and my, my, it IS the best Vietnamese iced coffee I've ever had. I ordered one for my Mom and I. She said it was too bitter but changed her mind later after she mixed it and it got a bit watered down.

Spring rolls were on point. The dumplings were amazing. They only had another couple in the establishment so we only waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. Our waitor was attentive and super friendly. There were plenty of seating and they were playing ""Kung Fu Panda"", awesome!

A little daunting from the outside. All of the windows are covered with a black cloth and they have a flashing light that makes you wary it might be a strip club. However, the food is mostly delicious. 

PHO
The bowls of pho are huge and well flavored. Though $9 a bowl, there's more than enough meat to make up for the price. I counted 6-7 pieces of tendon on top of 10-12 slices of rare beef. The first day we came, we ordered 1 bowl each. We died. Too much food. The second time we ordered two to a bowl and we were more than stuffed. 

Spring Rolls
The pork spring rolls were hot and fresh when we ordered it. The pork wasn't as well flavored as it could've been. The spring roll itself is comparable to brodards. However, the dipping sauce is comparable to summer rolls in Rosemead (bomb). 

Drinks
The coconut was fresh, cold, and delicious. The Vietnamese coffee was a bit disappointing. It tasted like powdered.

We walked in there and it wasn't busy so they said to pick a table.  No one came to take our drink orders.  It was 10 minutes before we asked if we can order drinks.  The servers where nice.

One of our friends that ate with us was her first time trying Pho.  Whatever she had ordered she enjoyed.  Another friend ordered the sausage roll and I think she liked it. She ate it all.

I ordered their Oxtail Pho and one egg roll.  I enjoyed it. Flavor of the broth was just right for my liking and not salty.  The reviews I read about this soup was the reason I tried it and they were spot on.  I had several tender pieces of oxtail in my soup and it was good.  I was going to take half of my soup home but it was so good that I just kept eating it all up.  The one egg roll I tried was just okay for me.  Some places give you all the trimmings with the pork egg roll and I thought I get a small something of trimmings but no, just one egg roll.  

I didn't get to try it but this place also serves boba and Vietnamese sandwiches.

I did read prior to coming that you can't split payment on multiple cards so I would recommend prior to ringing up the bill if they could just split the checks.  Or if it's going to be on one bill per table and least have the name of the items listed on the receipt next to the price so the customers aren't guessing what price their orders were.

The Bun bo Hue (""BBH"") here is outstanding.  I opt for no blood cubes.  What sets this bowl apart, aside from the outstanding broth, is the quality of the meat in the bowl--every piece tastes fantastic and is fall-apart-in-your-mouth tender, which you don't experience often with BBH.  I have had more than my share of frightening bowls of chewy mystery meats...

Don't let the location/building fool you.  It looks like the kind of place you might never work up the nerve to actually try, but inside it's nice and clean, and the food is fresh and really, really good.

3438531,2017-08-07,0,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,"This was the most disappointing pho restaurant I have ever been to. To make it easier, I will bullet point everything:
* the menu selection is extremely small. This restaurant did not offer any brisket, which is strange. The server told me that they did not offer any pho with brisket but my friend next to me got a bowl full of brisket in her combo pho. Not that it matters considering the brisket was DRY AND UNCHEWABLE
* no fish sauce was offered with the egg rolls we ordered. The server seemed annoyed when we asked for fish sauce and then continued to tell us that we had to make our own sweet/sour fish sauce. I have NEVER been to a Vietnamese restaurant where they didn't have fish sauce served with the egg rolls. In the end, it didn't matter because the spring rolls were not that great; however, they were better than the pho 
*the next point is that the pho is very bland. We had to add a lot of lime and sauce for it to be somewhat good. We were so surprised because this place has such good reviews on yelp. 

It's sad that this place has such bad food, along with bad service. We are Vietnamese and they talked to us as if we couldn't understand anything.

I liked the fact that they gave some noodles and cucumbers with it so you could make your own fried spring roll concoction. 

Merhherh ordered the Pho and I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Both were bland in flavor :| Just tasted watered down to me. I would say, maybe since it was at the end of the night so the food was lacking as they were about to close? But no, shouldn't it be even more flavorful cause the broth would be absorbing the flavor of the ingredients all day? Either way, just not my cup of tea, or rather bowl of pho.

Another thing I wasn't very fond of was that they just provide a bottle of fish sauce by the table. Not homemade?! Fish sauce in a bottle was not pleasing with my egg rolls :(

I was attracted to this place due to the fact that they have nem nuong on the menu, but came to soothe my hang over with some soup. We ordered the bun bo hue, bun rieu, nem nuong, and egg rolls. First off let me say, this vietnamese joint has the best I mean the best service any vietnamese restaurant has to offer. Our waitress was nice, attentive, and didn't have his thumb in my soup when he dropped it off. We actually got our waters filled without having to wave someone down. The fact that he treated us with such great service and knowing that we are not regulars made me become more of a fan. The nem nuong was rolled freshly when we ordered and came out quickly. It was very good. The dipping sauce was on point. The egg rolls came with noodles, lettuce and vietnamese herbs to roll and dip. They gave us individual sauce bowls so there will be no double dipping. I got the bun bo hue and my soup came out super hot which I loved. The broth was amazing, just the right amount spice, good meat to noodles ratio. I usually have to add so much to my broth to make it the way I want it. But not with this place, all I had to do was add my herbs and veggies and eat. I tasted my hubs bun rieu and that too was amazing. I'm really glad I found out about this place, this will be our new to go to place when we're in Vegas. Btw everything is made fresh to order so there might be a wait for your food.

After a long night of partying, a big bowl of pho sounded great for all of my hungover friends and I, but we definitely chose the wrong place to eat at. The pho broth had an off flavor, that's what ruined it for me. Even if there was superb meat (which there wasn't), broth is the main flavor component for pho so it was bad from the start. I mostly ate the meat drenched in sauce and left the rest.

One of the workers recommended the bun rieu to my friend; she said it was even better than the pho, but my friend thought otherwise. He said it was really salty and wasn't spicy whatsoever.

what i ate:
- chinese sausage spring rolls: om nom nom. Growing up with many Chinese friends, I have a total soft spot for Chinese sausages. These spring rolls were so delicious! The flavors and textures were all there! The rolls had this crunchy deep fried roll behind the sausage, giving this a great crunch. The house peanut sauce was delicious!
- combo: egg rolls, shrimp cake, grilled pork sausage (#25): the egg rolls were crispy, the shrimp cake nice and crispy, the sausage nice and meaty. This made me so happy while I was eating it, even if my friend was sadly struggling to eat her pho across the table from me

Pros:
- food! I can't speak for the pho, but the rolls and rice dish I had was delicious! 
- service: they were surprisingly busy for a late Monday morning, but they tried their best, which I appreciated. They were also very tech savvy taking payment with their iPad.
- price is decent

Pho Bosa was about a ten minute drive from The Strip and they had plenty of parking which was great. I visited the restaurant on Sunday at 12pm and it was packed! My group of four had to wait a few minutes for a table, which wasn't bad as we got to see and smell all the delicious food coming out of the kitchen. There were some larger groups who were waiting for what seemed to be ages. One downside to the interior of the restaurant us that I don't think they have central AC so it was pretty hot in the restaurant despite the fans they had blowing.

As an appetizer, we all shared the chicken spring rolls which I haven't seen on a lot of Vietnamese restaurant menus. I thought they were delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh. I thought the Pho Ga I ordered was some of the best I've ever had. The broth was well-seasoned and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The chicken was on the drier side but that's pretty standard for the dish. My boyfriend ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien and he said, ""It was good, but not great."" He also tried the Suong Nuong platter that our friends ordered and he said the pork chop was amazing. When they ordered it, the waitress asked if they liked pork skin but her accent made it sound like, ""Do you like foreskin?"" It took a while to figure out what she meant but it gave us a laugh.

My favorite item on the menu was the fresh young coconut that they crack open and serve with a straw and spoon. It makes you never want to drink Zico or any other packaged coconut water ever again!

Drove to Pho Bosa as it was only a mile away from our hotel on the strip. We came around 2:30pm and had to wait for about 10 minutes for a table for 2. The restaurant is tight, stuffy, and busy. The service is really good though. Our food came out quickly. The man who seated us and brought our waters was very friendly and jolly and kept cracking jokes.

Pho was $8-10 per bowl, which is expensive in my opinion, but hey, if you're craving something in Vegas, be prepared to pay for it. My man ordered pho with rare beef and beef balls. I ordered the pho in spicy lemongrass soup with pork, beef brisket, etc. I didn't like the noodles in either dish. The beef pho noodles were stale, dry, and thin. The noodles in my soup were just a cheaper version of udon.

I will say this: the quality of the meat is fantastic here. The brisket fell apart and had the perfect balance of tender meat and flavorful fat. We also ordered the pork sausage spring rolls for our appetizer, which were pretty good (although the best can only be found at Brodard in Garden Grove, CA).

Later when our food comes out this couple walk in and she seated them in the opposite side (side with apparently no heater.) We then ask to be seated in two different tables because the restaurant was literally empty and they said no & that they will separate the bill. So we ended up sitting in a big table after hearing that the bill will be separated. After they took our order the rude gray hair lady mumble in front of our face and said ""even if you're sitting together or not you're be still paying gratuity"" in such a disrespectful tone. According to the menu a party of five and up they changed gratuity for you but we come in wanting to sit in four.

My friends got the beef pho and I got the chicken. They did not have many options for beef, i only recall seeing rare fillet, beef balls, and a couple more items. For the chicken pho, they only give chicken breast, no dark meat.

Both of the broths were very well seasoned, but lacking in spices overall. They almost just tasted like beef noodle soup and chicken noodle soup instead of the traditional pho flavors. 

Also, they added fried garlic in my chicken pho, which changes the flavor greatly. I believe that pho should not contain garlic because the star ingredients are the spices like cloves and star anise etc. 

Their pho bowls only come in size large, so do consider sharing if you are a small eater. We were the first and only table when we placed the order, but the food took about 15 minutes to arrive.

We had a group of 9 people, which incurs a 15% service fee in the check. I don't recall seeing this note on the menu, but I was running low on energy so perhaps i might have missed it. They also won't split the check, but will take cards for payment, which is great.

My friend from out of town was with me and even said ""Where are you taking me?!"" This place had great reviews which includes some yelpers I know and my brother. There was maybe 2 or 3 parties already there when we were seated and as we waited to order the place started to get pretty packed. As most pho places in Vegas on a Sunday, most of the patrons were hung over youngsters who were at the club from the previous night. I really wanted spring rolls and saw something on the menu that was shrimp egg rolls, but unfortunately it was not the spring rolls I was expecting. It was shrimp wrapped and  deep fried and came with large pieces of lettuce on the side. It was good, but a little greasy. I ordered thin sliced beef, that came with egg rolls, a shrimp cake, and broken rice. I've never had broken rice before and it reminds me of the rice at the bottom of the rice cooker that's been there after awhile and becomes crispy. The beef and egg rolls were good, but I think I would enjoyed this meal more if I had the vermicelli with it instead of the broken rice. This was also my first time trying a shrimp cake and it looked like a piece of spam with batter, but made shrimp instead. Mine was on the greasy side because shiny oil on top was visible. Unlike my friend's shrimp cake his looked less greasier than mine. The service was pretty good because they were attentive throughout our entire meal. I even recognized one of the servers from another Pho place I used to eat at regularly. The inside its self looks like a make-shift restaurant, kind of odd but works?

I ended up just getting the basic Pho Dat Biet and even though I've had it so many times at home it was still good because of the weather.

BIGGEST COMPLAINT: 

The bill they give you is vague and primitive. There are NO item descriptions, just prices. Also, if you are in a party of 5 or more, there is a 15% service fee (which is just manually calculated and scribbled in there). 

If eating in large parties with many orders, be SURE to double check all prices very carefully. Considering many people are in Vegas are tourists, you may be drunk/ hungover and not notice that you were charged extra for something you did not order.

They were so generous with their crab meatballs and there was way more crab/shrimp than there was meat, which for me personally, is what I'm looking for in a great bun rieu - quality ingredients. The noodles they put in the bun rieu were a bit too hard for my liking. They were almost crunchy? I think if they were just cooked a bit longer they would have been fine. 

I can't really speak for anything else here besides the bun rieu. My friends got different varieties of pho, and they all said it was ok. My vietnamese friend said that the broth for the regular phos were weak/lacking depth of flavor, but then again he said that he was spoiled by the pho his parents spent hours making at home. The one thing we all agreed on though was that that was the longest we've ever waited for an order of pho to come out. We came in around 12 for lunch and ordered by 12:10pm. Our pho and spring rolls did not come out for almost 35-40 minutes. But, if I'm ever back in Vegas, I'll be sure to come back here after a long night out for a good bowl of bun rieu.

- Long wait for food so be prepared if you're starving

- Noodles were a little under cooked

The portions are generous, the ingredients fresh and of superb quality. You can taste the homemade goodness in everything -- from the perfectly-cooked broken rice to the moist egg quiche to the amazing lemongrass bun bo hue broth.

I used to eat at the old location at least 2-3 times a week. And during their several-month hiatus/relocation, I was like a druggie on withdrawal. I *craved* a good rice plate, and I must've visited every single Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas to get my fix. But alas, I was met with disappointment EVERY SINGLE TIME. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when Pho Bosa reopened; it was like my dealer had teased me so I would want more, and I've definitely been back many times to reclaim that euphoria.

I work as a VIP concierge at a large upscale resort/casino on the Strip, and I'm often asked where to get pho/Vietnamese food. You can be sure I never send them to the TI(t)!! Every guest that had taken my advice has come back raving about the wonderful food, service and prices.

Bosa 1/Pho Bosa is the best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas, hands down! But don't just take my word for it; check out what these other local media outlets have to say:

http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2009/jul/09/bosa-truly-no-1/

With their new location comes extended open hours, credit card payments and a slightly larger dining area. The staff is still just as friendly and accommodating. Do note that they are closed on Wednesdays. If you're a lucky local or just a Vegas visitor, do not miss the chance to enjoy the great offerings at this humble but wonderful restaurant.

How about you check out their nearly-100 high-ranked reviews there before making yourself look like an idiot.

4220278,2012-10-26,0,NQhPS0MUKJgBUB6PTLlmzA,"Came here last weekend when we were in Vegas. The first time I feel sort of duped by the Yelp reviews but I guess my bad for not double checking how many reviews there are really and that it's not enough for a good statistics, but we tried, and we failed. 

Bf and I go to San Gabriel a lot and their Viet food and selection are not bad, and Westminster area definitely is better every time we go. But I really can't see how this place is 5 stars, the only thing could be there's just not much Pho restaurants nearby to begin with and so there is not much to compare?

This place has got some bad service, rude. Seating you down and doesnt take your order for another 10 minutes. After ordering food took over 30 minutes to come out. And you know what is the most infuriating part? People that came in after us and ordered the same thing (the most common pho order) got their food first! That is seriously one of my biggest pet peeve. Some of us tried to order for the meat to come on the side instead of in the broth, and the server has the nerve to say they can't do it because their too busy, which obviously must be truth since the food seems like it was coming out in snail pace. I couldn't even enjoy the food I was in such a bad mood. The taste was okay, didn't see what the 5-star hype was about. Oh and in the end while we try to pay the bill, they used the iPad to sign for the credit card transactions and server/ manager was rude/strange? He said. ""You can use any fingers to sign, any at all. Just no nails"". Last I know from anatomy class, finger does not equal nail. What?!

As I re-read this, it sounds so harsh compared to the other glowing reviews. But I always call it for what it's worth, and it's not worth 5 stars at all. :(",r8sFUBlTp0-o1YOvlBNo6Q,2,0,1,AEWZyOsk_1gP_KZ50pal0Q

So we searched Yelp for suggestions and found Pho Bosa. We were exploring town so it was close to where we were, in the Rio area, found several places but Yelp gave the place a good review so we went in. We were early for dinner but was surprised that it was empty, but they had several people waiting for their to go items.

We were immediately seated, asked if we had any questions, both staff - the owners we found out, were very friendly and made the right recommendations, which we took them up on. 

There were four of us so we had a good variety and tasted each other's food. Everything was awesome!! The meat was tender and tasty - had both beef and pork. The rice was flaky, a little sticky, just right. We also had the noodles. Love the fact we can make our own sauce and as much as we wanted. All our dishes had the eggroll. We were going to go for desert but we were too full. The plates were very generous. They were very attentive and friendly. We will definitely come back again the next time we're in town, which is August of this year.

Prices were very reasonable. Let's just say, for the cost of one person's buffet dinner meal, we paid for the entire meal here. And to top it off, we were very satisfied whereas the last two day's worth of meals at the casino were not the greatest. We are definitely keeping this place in mind because I can't eat a week's worth of casino meals especially knowing that just off the strip are home cooked meals.",4gXsT1FJiAsMO2q3Mk_n4g,0,0,5,W0Q7rWk2ci7cQQtGZgxRaA

I was wrong; the food was just excellent.  The server was so kind and gave us tips on transportation from the resto, and we ordered their classic pho.  Texture was great and flavour was deliciously present, but the winner of the day was probably the iced Vietnamese coffee.

We also ordered the beef and pork toppings with rice served with pickles which was good for our sweet and spicy taste buds.

Service was a little better than most Vietnamese places as well.  Some folks mention the location as being a bit sketchy but I didn't see anything wrong with it.

Yes, this is based on my one lunch visit today whereby I ordered the Bun Rieu and promptly proceeded to inhale it. Yes, their interior and exterior leave a ton to be desired. Yes, it's strange that you have to go outside to access the restrooms. Yes, they... actually that's all I can think of.

So we got Bo Bun Hue, Nem Nuong Cuon and the Korean ribs combo that came with broken rice and egg rolls. I didn't really try the Bo Bun Hue. It was supposedly mad spicy. Stayed away from it. I had the Korean ribs which I thought were a bit mediocre and the egg rolls wasn't anything I would rave about. 

Why the four stars then? I loved loved loved loved loved their Nem Nuong Cuon. It's basically a spring roll with Vietnamese prom sausage. It was soooooo good. I can eat this all day errrday.

Service:
The service was OUTSTANDING!  We were three white people not familiar with Pho and our server went out of his way to really explain the purpose of all the flavors, the differences between Pho and the dish I ordered (Bun Bo Hue).  Plus, one of my friends was Vegetarian and one was allergic to seafood, so he went further out of his way to make sure all the ingredients fit with their situations.  

Food:
First I ordered the fried pork egg rolls.  They super delicious!  The server again mixed the sauces together for me (fish sauce & chili sauce) for dipping.  Then I realized half-way through eating the egg rolls was that I was eating them wrong.  I was eating them like a typical white person instead of realizing that the lettuce, herbs and veggies on the plate were meant to be used to wrap the egg rolls in.   At first we just thought it was really nice garnishes lol

Next I had the Bun Bo Hue.  One of the best broths I've ever tasted maybe ever.  I loved all the ingredients:  Brisket, Pork Sausage, Noodles, Cabbage and this Pork Blood thing.

this place gives you the biggest bang for your buck, especially in vegas. it's located off the strip, (and it's a little difficult to find) so prices are so much better than if you were to eat closer to town. i paid $9 for a large (they only offer one size) and i didn't even finish my food. you're definitely not going to find that on the strip.

their cococane is a combination of sugarcane and coconut juice, two drinks that vietnamese people are known for, and it definitely didn't disappoint. it's $9, but they give you this huge cup with so many coconut shavings! it's great for the ride home, until you have to use the bathroom cuz you were drinking so much of it (LOL)!

I ordered the pho tai with meat on the side. My companions ordered the bun bo hue and the bun huen. One of my companions wanted their sprouts cooked and there was a slight language barrier because the short lady can barely speak understandable English; that's fine.

I checked in with yelp and was offered the $2.99 three color drink. I asked my companion if they wanted the same, and the lady, I kid you not, scowled that it's for one person only! Ok, ok... 

My pho tai arrived after about five minutes, with the meat on the side. Then my companion got theirs. I knew right away it was gonna be less bang for my buck. It was a big bowl of soup and very little noodle. The beef was not the best cut. The broth was nothing special; I really don't know what is so special about this place. 

My companions agreed their portions are significantly smaller than other restaurants and their prices are significantly higher. 

As we were presented the check, we noticed a $1 charge. We asked the lady what it was for and she said it was for the extra dish bc the pho tai was requested with the meat on the side. WHAT??!  I told her nowhere on the menu did it mention the surcharge and she said nothing about it when I ordered. 

I am not cheap but she could at least be a little nicer and explain the surcharge without scowling at us again! And I know it's not because of the language barrier. I have communicated with Thai in Thailand who spoke absolutely no English and I can tell their nicety through facial expressions and gestures.

HOWEVER, once you tried their specialty ""Bun Bo Hue"", you will want to come back for more. I've lived in Vegas for 9 years and this place (on the average) still has the best Bun Bo Hue in town. Their other specialty is broken rice dishes (com tam), which is good but not exceptional. Their Pho is okay too, not bad.

Lately, I noticed food came out much faster than before. I believe they might have more staff in the kitchen and therefore reduced the time it takes for food to come out.

Order summer roll with nem noung was bomb just like broddards in OC.  It even comes with a similar sauce.

Passed through Vegas on a road trip, so we decided to have some nice hot broth to keep us going on the long drive. It wasn't too busy, and we were seated and ordered pretty quickly. Once we stopped giggling at the posters advertising ""cococane"" juice, of course.

We all ordered the same thing: the combination pho. The meatballs and tendon were okay, but the brisket and steak tasted like liquid smoke, which was kind of off-putting. The smoke flavor leached into the broth, which wasn't great. The noodles were fine. The best part, though, was that the bowl was massive, and probably enough to feed two people. Good deal.

Service was fine. We were in and out pretty quickly, which was nice for us. Seems that the popular items here are the rice plates and sandwiches, which might explain why the pho wasn't all that great.

 reincarnated Pho Bosa. Apparently, they moved to be closer to the strip and included pho to please customers top 2 requests. 

Plates have always been the star for both the BF and me. They changed the way the plates are so there is more customization on the items you have in your combo whereas it used to be set items aside from the main meat dish. We both got plates with shrimp cake and eggrolls and I picked grilled pork sausages and the BF got BBQ pork. Everything good, as expected. It's the best broken rice plate you're going to get in Vegas. I wish they bottled their seasoned fish sauce! It is clean and balanced and I want to douse it on everything. They're doing a free soda with a Yelp check-in and that was oddly the only bump in the visit. It was flat and odd tasting according to the BF who ordered a coke.

Service is just as friendly and attentive which I have come to expect when you go to eat at Bosa. It's one of the few Asian establishments that have amazing service. 

It's easily missed when driving by it. If you see the Bikini Bar it is next to it and the Zombie Apocalypse store is across the street on Polaris.

""Yeah, you smell like an Asian; 'lemongrassy'."" he continues and laughs.

""You can get out and walk you know"".  OK so it was true that I just finished one of Pho Bosa's  delicious specialties, Bun Bo Hue, a spicy bowl of collagen laced, beef, lemongrass noodle soup with ginger infused pork blood cake, melting beef tendons, well braised shank, topped with  raw onions, unusual herbs, and the zing of lime.  The perfect balance of sweet, sour, savory, spicy.

Not to be overshadowed, the Bun Rieu (Shrimp and crab soup with vermicelli rice noodles).  Complex flavors from fermented fish sauce, a concentrated chicken broth and shrimp stock,  acidic kick of tomatoes, vibrancy from cilantro, bitterness of green onions and fried tofu for body.  It's just good eats.

Com Tam (broken rice) plates are interesting.  Remember, this is Southeast Asian cooking, everything is overcooked by American standards.  Choose the sides (good egg roll, rubbery quiche and shrimp cake) and a meat (deeply marinated Korean style short ribs, dry pork chop, thin slices of soft beef, flavorful grilled chicken).  Done.  The rice itself is different texturally thanks to smaller grains cooking faster than unbroken grains and starch being released throughout.  Definitely worth a try.

Finally the pho.  A powerhouse of heavily extracted beef flavor and spices.  Heavy mouth feel.  Excellent.

Taking the most flavorful Pho broth and trying to better something that ""isn't broken,"" I'm glad to say that the ""smokey broth"" options here have ruined my desire to eat ""plain"" pho ever again lol.

They have a few variants, but the Smoked Oxtail Pho is highly recommended!  Literal smoked broth, highly peppery with just the right amount of oil!  The Oxtail itself full of flavor, well peppered and tender.  The cartilage and fat rendered to remind one of a glorious bone marrow, highly edible and decadent.

It was close to where we were staying, it was absolutely delicious, and we got lots of food for a relatively low price. Also, Vanessa and Moe are very friendly and we love coming by to say hi to them. They were the first nice locals we met in Las Vegas.

I ate a lot of pho during the hottest months of the summer, which is another testament to how good the food is. If it's over a hundred degrees outside and I'm still ordering hot soup, it has to be pretty exceptional! 
We live further away from Chinatown now and don't have Vietnamese food nearly as often, but once I tasted it here, I couldn't bring myself to go anywhere else. I really want to explore the menu and I have branched out from time to time, nothing has ever disappointed me. 

What keeps me coming back is Vanessa's pho broth! I have never in my life tasted a more amazing pho broth. It is the perfect comfort food. When I am sick and craving my mom's food, I get some of their spicy pho and it always helps me feel better. I could drink a whole bowl of it with nothing added in, but it only gets better with more ingredients. They put a generous amount of meat and noodles and broth in there each time, I feel like they've got the ratio just right. I never feel like they skimp on anything.

 I always get my pho with rare sliced beef, and with egg rolls in the fish sauce. The egg rolls are the perfect compliment to the savory broth. All the vegetables are fresh, and so is the meat. I'm really picky about the meat I eat, especially red meat, but I love all the different meats they serve here (I've had beef and pork).

Make sure you get the taxi companies number so you can get a ride back because flagging down a taxi is quite difficult in the area. It's a fairly small location, so if you have a big party, be prepared.

Luckily we didn't have to wait. They have a huge selection for you, whether it's pho or rice plates, as well as a lot of different drinks. I always go for the coconut juice since it's helps a lot after a long night. You get the drink in a REAL coconut, and you can eat the insides when you're done. The first time, I ordered the BBH (Bun Bo Hue), it was alright. It taste a little different from what I'm use to but overall it tasted good. You get pork blood and the knuckle along with everyone else that's suppose to be in BBH. Other time, I got the pho dac biet, combination pho.

The parking was pitch black, no light poles in the parking lot. The restaurant itself was all covered up so no light from the inside would bleed out. So, I thought it was closed! My family and I kicked my brother out of the car to check if it was open, and when he opened the door and light bled out of the restaurant, we knew it was open. After being seated by kind employees, I ordered a Pho Tai.

Pho should always be judged on three things-- broth, noodles, meat.
Broth was 5/5, meat was 4/5 because there weren't enough meat with the noodle ratio (I had like a solid 6 piece of pho Tai mean pieces) but the tenderness of the meat was nice. The only small issue I had with the noodles was that it was slightly harder than other pho noodles I've encountered. Portion is HUGE. Thus, 4/5.

I'm always the type of person to try a place even though it has a couple of OK reviews, just for my own opinion.

Presentation: Small little mom and pop joint. Not the nicest place but, this is what I imagine what mom and pop stops look like.

Wait: We were seated immediately. It took us about 5-10 minutes to look at the menu before we ordered.

Customer Service: The customer service deserves a 5 Star. The waiter was fast with water refills, persistent, and did his job well. 

Food: I was a little disappointed in their Pho Dac Biet. Which is the original pho that comes with tendon, brisket, meatballs, meat etc., you know.. the usual. The meat was tough, and the texture was over cooked, the broth was.. just not good. The best part of it was the meatballs. My husband ordered one as well with some spring rolls and let me tell you, those were DELICIOUS. I'll definitely come back for those, and probably try something new!

We got a #74 pho tai, a #76 bun bo hue and a side of grilled pork. The tea here tastes much better than the other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Their noodle soup bowls here are huuuuge. Just like any other place, you get a plate of bean sprouts, lime wedges, basil and jalapeno

Pho Tai:
Rice noodle (vermicelli) soup with rare steak. I like to put Hoisin sauce, 2 slices of jalapeno and juice from a lime wedge on my pho. The broth was tasty and LOTS of meat. I love it! 5/5

Bun Bo Hue:
Spicy beef noodle soup with beef shank, cubes of cooked pork blood with ginger, pork, lemon grass broth. Think Tom Yum soup from a Thai restaurant but way spicier.  I've had this many years ago but the pork blood and spiciness of this soup scared the heck out of me. Their version tastes better and ""cleaner"" although I'm still scared of pork blood. This is actually a very good soup. My friend loves spicy food and even he thinks this was real spicy. 5/5

I can't complain about the service. The servers were very attentive and they're always asking ""you guy do ok?"" OK!

The restaurant even addresses the issue of their long wait with signs on the wall that say 'our food is made fresh and may take 10-20 minutes to come out. Wait time may be doubled if busy""

Trust me they're not kidding. Our food took about 35 minutes. For two bowls of pho and spring rolls? .. really? I yelped this place while I was in Vegas because I suspected phoking long would have a really long line so I decided to go somewhere else. If I knew I would be waiting 40 minutes for a bowl of pho I might as well just have gone to phoking long -_- 

Spring rolls are good. Large pho doesn't have that much noodles in it.

I suppose I'm supposed to give them credit for posting a disclaimer but they don't post it on the door of the entrance, you can't see it until you actually sit down. And who expects a bowl of pho to take THAT LONG! 

Oh on top of that they forgot my order of spring rolls. The restaurant really isn't big at all probably just 15 tables and they have 2-3 servers.

Even though the interior is dark, dreary, run-down, surprisingly the scary restroom located outside the restaurant was uber clean. Haha!

I ordered a nice big bowl of Bun Rieu cuz I wasn't in the mood for pho. Have to admit, one of the best damn bowls of Bun Rieu I've had at a Vietnamese restaurant. The SBBF ordered himself some pho and thoroughly enjoyed his meal.

For a total of 5 visits they were closed for 3 of them with a sign on the door stating they've ran out of food. That is however the only negative thing I have to say about this place. 

Bosa is definitely a hidden gem, has all the appearance qualities of a hole in the wall joint. The pho here is actually not great but all the rice dishes and other soup dishes are hands down the best in the area. 

For starters the pork egg rolls are my go to, they're very similar to the famous broddards in LA with a little less crunch. 

I typically order the bun bo hue and/or the pork/rice dish with Chinese sausage. The broth in the bun bo hue is extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spice and the thick noodles are cooked to a good texture. Also a small but important part of the experience that bosa does well is the quality of their side condiments like the cilantro and limes. They are very fresh and the limes aren't dried out like a lot of places.

Food: My favorite thing here is their spring rolls. The ratio of meat to veggie to wrap is perfect and the flavor of the meat is right on point. The sauce is also delicious. I always add a little chili to it and keep it as a dipping sauce for the meat from my pho. The pho is good quality. The broth is well seasoned and really soothing to your stomach. I always get the combination which comes with tendons that are perfectly tender and a few different kinds of meat. They have big portions. I can never finish my $8 bowl.
They also have really good Vietnamese coffee. The one with condensed milk is like a dessert, sweet and rich. I always get the black coffee which has sugar but is not as heavy.
Service: The servers always look friendly and the food comes decently fast. Even though there was a line when we got there around noon it went fairly quickly and we were seated after just a 15-20min wait.

I was in vegas for our family trip and my family always insists on getting Vietnamese food, despite all the other food to choose from in vegas.  We yelped a pho place, but it was closed down so we found ourselves at Pho Bosa.

When we entered the restaurant we were rudely greeted and said we would have to wait for a seat in their small and dirty restaurant.  When we were seated the waitress was also rude to us as well.  To make things worse, they have these signs on their walls that basically states you are not in a fast food restaurant so be patient for your food.  Obviously, if you are at a restaurant there will be a wait and it's pretty unnecessary for them to post that sign.

I ordered bun bo hue which was decent for vegas.  

The gentleman that came to bus our tables after we ate and he asked me if I like my bun bo hue with a native tone and it confused me for a bit because he didn't look Vietnamese.

It's a given! Pho is a great hangover remedy, my friends and I visited pho bosa cause per Yelp, it was new and had great ratings. We had a large party and was immediately greeted by:

""You guys CANT sit together at one table but I still have to charge you the gratuity""

I was already agitated by their welcoming greeting, and after I politely asked why, the waiter forced me to speak to the owner, I'm fine with that. However, the owner was the one who went overboard. 

He exclaimed his frustration about my disagreement to pay the group gratuity even though we sat separately. Usually when you have big groups, you want them on separate checks to speed up the service. The disgruntled owner had the balls to say: ""You don't want to seem like an asshole to your friends to get your food first and have them wait for a 'long' time, would you?""

I couldnt believe how unprofessional and unamicable the owner was. He tried explaining a bunch of other useless chatter, but I just decided to take the business to another pho restaurant down the street.  I can't understand why the owner pushes a gratuity charge on large parties when this place IS NOT BIG ENOUGH to seat parties of 4 or more!!! 

Pho Bosa didn't have much of a crowd there and its built in a sketchy industrial area, probably isn't safe there anyway. We also chose this place cause we wanted to give them some business. I'm a firm supporter of small business owners as I am one myself.  But I guess this was decided otherwise. 

One thing I also found really bizarre was that the owner was non-Asian, I don't know, but I think Asian owned pho joints will taste much better. LOL. Just and observation. By the way, most of the other reviews on here are bogus.",mCP03vu3BF-K8njw3qYwXQ,0,0,1,hIeNvFJCWhu6-sKNUCTDCA

I am a huge fan of their peanut sauce that they make and serve warm with their fresh spring rolls. They offer both pork and chicken sausage and the flavor in the sausage is mild. But that dipping sauce makes up for any flavor lost.

The pho here is decent, good, and solid. My noodles were a bit soft in my bowl. And if you have read my other pho reviews, you know that I keep an eye out for any silver or green tinge of coloring on my meats and I didn't see any until my last few pieces of meat. And one piece had a really funky taste to it, which I spit out immediately but other than this - I liked their pho.

The bun bo hue is a winner for me here too. I asked for extra spicy and was delivered just that. The ingredients were fresh and good. The meat however was too big in portion and it would have been a better experience for me if it had been sliced smaller.
