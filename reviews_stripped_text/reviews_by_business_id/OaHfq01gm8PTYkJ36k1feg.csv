Found this place on Groupon and many times Groupon = a desperate attempt to sell crappy food and service for a place that needs customers. NOT HERE!!!

The food quality was perfect, the steak was cooked to a textbook medium rare temp (which many places screw up), and the cheesecake is simply the best! The La Terre cab was very tasty!

Ordered off the appetizer menu which took close to 45 minutes to get our food but we figured soft open maybe they just working The Kinks out so we gave him a second chance. Same thing this time  close to 25 minutes for a Jack and Coke, rum and coke and to mojitos. appetizers came out in about 15 minutes which in all fairness the appetizers were good. I ordered the bone in ribeye which came without any sides for $35 which I have gladly paid in the past at higher-end steakhouses for an excellent cut of meat cooked perfectly. This was not the case here ordered medium rare after an hour the steak came out basically raw in the middle slightly warmed through. The cut of meat itself wasn't Prime wasn't Choice barely select full of Gristle horribly tough piece of meat definitely not worth the money or the wait. My daughter ordered the prime flat iron cooked well ,which evidently she got my medium rare when she eventually got her knife through this piece of shoe leather blood ran out onto her plate which ruined her appetite of course she sent it back. The owner eventually came over and apologized said they'd only been open a week which has I said we were there a month ago. Told her yeah it was a little ridiculous to wait over an hour for our meal which realistically couldn't have taken over 20 minutes to prepare considering there was only six other tables occupied in the restaurant at the time. She told me that she looked at the ticket and it only been put in a half an hour ago basically calling me a liar.

The location did not have a wait time, however they did have large party tables already seated. We walked in at 8:21pm  and 10 minutes later the waiter finally walked over and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned he left the drinks and said he would be back to take our food order. We continued to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to return and take our food order, but we were able to see he continued to attend a table of 7. After waiting for over 30 minutes and still not able to place our order we decided to leave. 

The girl at the entrance informed the manager or owner of our situation and as we walked out the manager said she could take our order. We were just done at this point and did not want to continue to wait even longer for our food to come out. The waiter we had hopefully becomes more aware of his guest and provides better service and hopefully this is an isolated incident.

2305622,2017-12-17,0,OaHfq01gm8PTYkJ36k1feg,"I stopped by and ordered the filet, medium rare. The steak was cooked properly, but had almost no flavor. There was no pepper rub or anything to give the steak any ""kick."" I realize that a filet has a very mild flavor, but this was beyond ""mild"" and more ""bland."" A small ramekin was served along with the steak, and I thought ""Oh, maybe this will be a nice chimichurri to add some tastiness to the steak"". I was disappointed to learn that the sauce served was A1. Perhaps I am a bit too discriminating about steaks, but I think of A1 as nothing more than overrated ketchup. Normally, when a server asks if I need any steak sauce I think to myself ""If it needs steak sauce, then I'm sending it back."" I was so surprised to see A1 served with a filet. The service was top notch, all of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Their excellent service, however, could not make up for the mediocre steak. Seriously, Outback Steakhouse has a better filet, and for the same ~$30 price Outback at least includes sides. Michael T's steaks are served a la carte, so a traditional steak dinner will cost about $50 per person. The price is not overly expensive, but again, the quality of the food is not commensurate with its cost.

2350980,2018-03-06,1,OaHfq01gm8PTYkJ36k1feg,"This place is good. But it's confusing..  And hopefully I'll explain why. We had a groupon, so we decided to check it out this evening. The groupon was for two steak dinners, with a house salad to share, grilled veggies, loaded baked potatoes, bottle of white or red, and a slice of cheesecake to share. 

Being the foodies we are, we decided to also try an appetizer, and a tapas. We chose the fried pickles, and bacon wrapped dates. The fried pickles were less than satisfying. They were whole spears, with a very pancake-y batter, that had little flavor, and seemed a bit undercooked. Either way, not terrible.. but I would pass on them next time. The bacon wrapped dates however were fantastic!  Absolutely give these a try!  Next came the salad, which was very good..  Spring mix, with wedge tomatoes, beets, and a house vinaigrette. The vinaigrette could have been tossed with the salad a little better, as the majority of it was lost at the bottom. However, like I said.. We quite enjoyed it. 

The main course came, and let me tell you.. the steaks were perfect!  We both ordered mid rare, and they did not disappoint one bit. Great flavor, great charring, just honestly great overall. The accompanying sides were fantastic as well.

The slice of cheesecake was next. It was a generous size, and very good. I could have done without the cloying strawberry sauce however. But the nice sliced strawberries, and light fresh whipped cream was welcomed. 

Now on to the ambiance. It was... confusing. This is a brand new place, so I'll forgive it as I know growing pains. Anyway, we just weren't sure what this place was trying to be. A formal steakhouse, a nice upscale restaurant, or a bar and grill. The service was exceptional, as the wine was presented to us, and opened table side. The waiter was very attentive, and took care of our needs quickly and efficiently. Now what made this confusing was... Our water glasses were plastic, coca-cola glasses. Which is perfectly fine, but confusing as the service didn't really suggest that this was a casual dining experience. Also the choice of music in the restaurant, again.. it didn't scream of upscale, more casual dining. I guess it's possible that the waiter just took his job VERY seriously, and wanted to give us the best possible experience, which he certainly did. 

Overall, this wouldn't be my first choice for a bite to eat, as we live clear across town. But I would love to try some other things on the menu, I'd also love to be there when the dueling pianos are playing.. I'm sure that's a fun time. 

We did stop into the bar for a quick $10 on keno, and poker.. but didn't order any drinks. It was completely closed off from the restaurant, as smoking is allowed in there. 

I wish this place the best, I think they have the recipe for success if I'm basing it on the food, and service. Even if they have some minor identity problems.",1oV4mY3GnNOZmGq8IYYL1w,6,1,4,HTigQXybY1wszIr-yaKgtQ

2962257,2018-07-01,0,OaHfq01gm8PTYkJ36k1feg,"My new favorite spot for loose slots, delicious food and crazy fun entertainment! I came to Michael T's after hearing about the dueling pianos on Saturday nights. My entire family came (a party of 9)and while the dining room was busy we were smart enough to make a reservation. A definite must if you plan on coming for dueling pianos cause the place fills up and it was easy to see why. 
We were immediately seated by a friendly hostess and our drink order was taken right away. We had a couple stragglers in our party who arrived a bit late but the hostess and server didn't miss a beat and got their drinks ordered right away. 
We treated ourselves to some specialty drinks and they didn't disappoint. Generously poured and delicious, they even come with seriously the cutest twist on a boring old cocktail umbrella. You gotta order a drink to see it. 
We got an appetizer-chips with guacamole and salsa. They give a pretty large portion of guacamole and it was good but the salsa tastes homemade and was excellent. I wish there had been a few more chips but it was a great start to our meal. 
So it was 2 for 1 in prime rib tonight and our entire party opted on this for the entree. I feel like I've never had a better prime rib anywhere-it even puts Lawry's to shame-I kid you not. It was cooked perfectly-just the right amount of pink and so incredibly flavorful. It had this heavenly edge that tastes so good-salty and crunchy and it worked so perfectly with the tenderness of the meat. The fat content was minimal so the cut was mostly meat and I appreciated the fact that I didn't have to cut around and through a ton of fat to get to the meat. The creamy horseradish was heavenly. It was served with some cooked-just-right asparagus as well as a really cool take on a baked potato. It was half of a large potato that seemed to have been baked with cheese and bacon on top and then drizzled with sour cream. It was moist and flavorful. The portions were very large and they left plenty to take home for tomorrow (or possibly, in my case, a late night snack cause I'm still thinking about that prime rib...). 
We decided to grab some dessert to share as a table and chose the creme brûlée cheesecake and the flourless chocolate cake. Both were incredible but I was a little more partial to the cheesecake. 
Our server was excellent-knowledgeable, attentive, professional and very kind and patient with our large party. The restaurant itself is gorgeous-a lower level that surrounds the pianos and a slightly elevated level with booths and tables. It's very tastefully decorated and has this sort of upscale vibe but it's anything but stuffy. 
We were so stoked about the dueling pianos and they were so fun and entertaining. Both performers sang an array of music-from oldies to rock to more current hip hop. It was great to see such a great variety of music and everyone in the restaurant sang together for some of the more popular songs. There's just something about a place that makes you feel like you know everyone there. 
There's a gaming area off to the right of the restaurant that has some really cool wall murals and although we didn't spend a lot of time in there, my husband dropped a $10 in one of the machines and walked out with plenty more than he came in with! Some other patrons commented that they've had some pretty consistent luck there. 
Michael T's is a place that has a little something for everyone-gaming, food, entertainment and plenty of TV's around for viewing sporting events. I'm already planning my next visit-we hear they do live music on Friday nights. Do yourself a favor and put this place at the top of your must go list.

The bar is nice and clean. Doesn't smell funky or have that spilled beer smell that some other places have. There are a lot of screens to watch sports.

We didn't gamble, but we will be back with friends to check that out after Mom goes back home.  
Janda made my Mom a Margarita, not from a mix but a real Margartia, she loved it! We ended up meeting Julie the other bartender and she was friendly and welcoming also.

Half off all food items on their tapas and appetizer menus and $2 off on beers and well drinks. Love their mango habanero chicken wings and bacon wrapped dates. The steak chimichurri was just ok to me. Good flavor, but the steak was a bit chewy. The shrimp ceviche plate was quite bland, so I'd pass this one.

The second time, I tried their steak special for 2. For $59, you get a bottle of la terre wine (choose between cab, merlot, chardonnay, and white zin. We chose the cab and it was decent. We actually got another bottle as we were thirsty lol. They charged $21 for a $7 bottle of wine, but I guess still cheaper than most places.), a house salad (really good dressing), 2 New York steaks with baked potatoes and sauteed veggies (the steak was flavorful. Asked for a medium rare, but it came out more on the medium side, but still tasted good. Baked potatoes was loaded and delicious. Veggies had good flavor), and a house made New York cheesecake for dessert (I don't even like cheesecake, but this was good!) They happened to have a live singer (Chase Brown and he was great) when we had dinner there, so that was a bonus. 

Service was great. Had Virgil and Kara who were very friendly. Overall, I had good experiences both times I went there. Looking forward to frequenting this place more often.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,5,0,4,-4LL4mGlMdzngvjw95saAA

We got her the NY.  It was under cooked.  We ordered Med well and it was right at Med and some places a little under.  Obviously they mixed up the temps.  She left a lot of steak between fat and blood.  I tried to help eat it.

Chicken chipotle empanadas were tasty but didn't have too much chicken in the filling.  I didn't personally care for the wrap that was used for the empanada.  They top them with crema, lettuce and tomatoes.
The sliced flat iron steak was covered in an amazing chimichurri sauce.  We had sausages and peppers and it was obvious to me that they make all their own sausages because they were excellent.     My buddy thought the meatballs were ""meh"" but I enjoyed them.  They added a marinara sauce and shaved Parmesan atop the meatballs.  He makes his own meatballs using 3 different meats so that could affect his opinion.  We ordered sliders but they were very basic but didn't taste bad.  Just not amazing but you do get 4 of them.  We also enjoyed the happy hour wings with a honey sriracha sauce.  After dinner we had the flourless chocolate cake with some vanilla ice cream.  They drizzle chocolate and raspberry sauce all over the plate which seriously enhances the meal.

The Mac and cheese with shrimp and bacon was a taste bud surprise! Yum. The buffalo wings were dripping in sauce and had a nice flavor to them.

The main course was where a was let down. I ordered a Mushroom Jalapeño Swiss. I asked for it medium rare. When the burger came it was covered in onions.

The lady that greeted us and got our waters was extremely unfriendly. I've noticed this a lot lately with customer service. It's kind of gone downhill everywhere I'm not sure why. Anyway, the man that served us was friendly, he told us he was new there which is totally fine and I don't think that this had anything to do with him but for some reason we were waiting forever to eat we were about to just cancel it and leave but we felt bad. 

Came here for a Super Bowl party before it was Michael Ts and this place was great. I don't think I'll try this place again.",Il2l0zODB-QDOynyDjor-A,2,0,2,WtMC1XMoAkidn4Kirqp8pQ

4831737,2018-01-24,0,OaHfq01gm8PTYkJ36k1feg,"New bar to check it out! We decided to come here to check out their happy hour menu. Half off on appetizers and tapas and also on beer and wine! This place is a local bar located on warm springs and tenaya. We've tried different appetizers and tapas and they all tasted great! I'm impressed with the food as most bar food I've tried before were just ok to me. My favorite out of all was the chimicurri with steak. That was delicious. 

They currently have s special for 2 that comes with 2 steaks, 1 bottle of wine, share salad, and dessert. I will definitely will give it a try next time I come back. 

I wish the cocktails are also happy hours though since I enjoy cocktails more..",9efCzgW1smpgjdjzCxG-Ig,2,2,4,X9SfGL-IZPXR5PsQm2WKPw

At first glance upon entering it may appear to be another local bar (AHEM let me not mention the one which is what, every two miles and begins with a 'P') -- bur this spot has many creative approaches.  The lovely active bar area with gaming is on the right and is enclosed (smoking)! Gander inside though, chic out the mural on the wall of the three lovely gentlemen;)
The left side is a richly wood toned restaurant WITH dueling pianos!  Michael T's brings warmth and refinement to the neighborhood's area cookie cutter chain bars.
Yes, they have a fantastic selection of appetizers for happy hours.  That's right, plural TWO happy hours.  I'm suggesting all, the grilled artichoke and bacon wrapped dates are my favorites.  Clever twists on the Food, seasonal and fresh ingredients resonate throughout all items on the menu. 
Now, desserts...
The chef's creative whims on the creme brûlée cheesecake is something magical.",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,2,1,5,VRMfdYlhDjnupXfRNNgqJA

I liked the atmosphere as they had the sports bar area and restaurant are separated by a glass wall. We sat in the restaurant area and was seated very quickly and our server was very friendly. I tried the jambalaya per her recommendation and my friend tried the lamb chops. The jambalaya was outstanding and my friend enjoyed the lamb choos. After our meal the chef came out to our table and talked to us about our meals and asked what we liked about them and what could be better. I thought that was a good move as it shows that he's really concerned about his customers. I will definitely come back here again during lunch to try their lunch specials.,ttDT3NFJdDXgcXulENTnMA,0,0,4,ffPzZsHmYb4f5dZLU7-Y2Q

Don't pass up the chance to get the stuffed mushroom appetizer, it's unbelievably good.
