I have been twice so far this week. Some folks may want a few more choices on entries, but I found it nicely balanced. You may not find your favorite cut of meet, but you will  find quality.
Food and service were excellent on both my visits. I enjoyed each of my selections.

We were warmly greeted by the manager, Shaun. After settling in and looking over the menu, we decided to do the chef's tasting and it was amazing. Chef Steve came out and asked us about preferences and allergies. Our waiter, Bobby, and supporting staff were attentive to every detail.
 
We started the meal with two salads and beef tartare. The heirloom tomato salad was amazing. The burrata cheese and avocado played off the white balsamic marinated tomatoes perfectly. The baby beets salad was great and the pistachios added a nice twist. Now for my favorite dish, the wagyu beef tartare was perfection. Yes, perfection. It melted in your mouth and the caviar added a pleasant pop with each bite. Seriously, don't skip this. Our next course was the seared scallop. It was cooked on point and the chorizo topping added a nice different change from other seared scallop dishes that I've had.  For the main course, our steaks were prepared to our requested preferences. The side of short rib mac and cheese was incredible. It was very cheesy and had a good amount for meat. The pickled jalapeno added a nice touch of heat. For dessert, we had the crème brulee and raspberry cheesecake. The crème brulee was tabled flaming which always adds a nice presentation touch. Working in NYC, I've had a plenty of cheesecake and this one was phenomenal. Hats off to the pastry chef as they crushed it with this. The cake wasn't too heavy and the crust wasn't too crispy. The best part was the raspberry sauce and the freshness of the raspberries themselves. The berries tasted as if they were freshly picked before coming to the table. The sauce wasn't too sweet and had a nice tart. It was the perfect end to the meal.
 
Again if you want a top notch meal, come to Edge. The modern décor, comfortable atmosphere, attentive staff, and amazing food, you will not be disappointed. We can't wait to return during our next visit in Vegas.",h2m5cCbkUYab00b3p829TQ,1,1,5,6zgEH2ne8CoDPnLEBH83XQ

I usually don't venture out too much while travelling on business alone and opt for room service. I decided I would try the Edge Steakhouse, what a great Decision, This place is amazing and I probably had the best night Ever while travelling on business !!
I sat at the Bar and from the get go, was made to feel So comfortable with the Bartender Mike. A real Old School kind of barman that you really don't find much anymore, anywhere! Its almost as if he sensed I may have been a little uncomfortable as he asked me "" where's the rest of the gang"" I said I was alone to which he replied in his New Yawk accent "" I got your back"" and introduced himself. Mike made me feel so comfortable that I stayed almost until closing. His personality just shines and yes, he is a very handsome man, maybe that helped a little too :) 
I had a delicious 7 oz petit filet with a side of mushrooms, both delicious and just melts in your mouth, best steak Ive ever had !! I asked Mike what his recommendation would be for a nice dry red to accompany my meal. He suggested a Chianti. Perfect Again !
I will definitely be venturing out alone more as a single business Woman, at least, to The Edge Steakhouse Bar. Highly Recommend!!",Duv5S-fZBn9dhgNvtRZsIQ,0,0,5,THZbo7H_MlGXVpGe-kTnnQ

I visit Vegas at least four times a year, stay at Venetian or Aria, and generally build more loyalty points by eating than I do by gambling. I had fairly low expectations when my friends invited me to join them at Edge Steakhouse in the Westgate resort. Certainly it couldn't match the quality of Carnevino or John-Georges...could it?  Well, I'm not ready to say it's better, but it is definitely on par. 
Our group was treated to a small private dining room and a chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. Service was excellent. Starters were the stars. Cauliflower soup, a seared scallop, and sweet prawns raised my expectations for the meal. And they were never let back down. Two types of steak and a lamb roast served family style were stellar. Every side dish was delicious. Special shout out for two types of pureed potatoes. The deserts, although very standard in selection (cheesecake, chocolate cake and creme brulee), we among the best preparations of each that I've tasted. 
Like desert, the wine pairings were delicious, if not inspiring. The chardonnay and the soup brought out each other's hidden nuances.
Best of all, compared to the above mentioned steakhouses at the big-boy resorts, the prices are exceedingly reasonable. 
Bottom line: even though I can't get there on foot, and even though it won't contribute to my loyalty programs, I'll be adding Edge to my list of regular dining spots. It's that good.",o4XV5LbZefMVN8v-LTQRjA,5,1,5,HzTOBT1elZ4cMnzO2iZssA

Ambience: this would best be described has old school Vegas classy. The tables are very nicely spaced, the chairs very comfortable. You know you are in an upscale place as soon as you sit down.
Service: Angel, our server, was that our table almost immediately after we sat. He was not familiar with the Travelzoo offer so he got his manager to come to the table to explain how things would work. Both of them couldn't be nicer. Throughout the evening, Angel, the bus boy, and the food runners, were extremely attentive without being intrusive. The service was near-perfect. In fact, we had a minor problem with the order. Angel assured us that he would make it right and he did. And when he heard that couple was celebrating a major anniversary, he brought us complimentary desserts. Truly five star service throughout
Food: my wife and I each decided to start the meal with a shrimp cocktail appetizer. Gorgeous presentation and delicious food. Nice way to start the meal. I chose the flat iron steak and my wife chose petite filet as our entrees. It was cooked to perfection. I preferred the filet to my flat iron steak. But both were excellent dishes. As a side dish I got the Corn Trio. Is consisted of a portion of cream corn, chili lime corn on the cob and jalapeno cornbread. Delish! We finished with a flaming creme brulee and the huge piece of chocolate layer cake. The presentation on the crème brûlée was spectacular to say the least. And it tasted equally good.
Value: the Travelzoo voucher for approximately $45 a head for a meal like this is a terrific value - what a great way to celebrate an anniversary.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,5,1,5,kLQ7NPk3UBOY_TU6zv8ntg

We had the Edge salad....very good, too much dressing though so the waiters assistant graciously got me another  with dressing on the side.

Well, they weren't  so the manager brought me new ones and waited to watch me try one...he wanted to see my face...they were indeed hot...perfect. We asked that the wine come at the same time as dinner, well, it came a bit after we started eating. We were told fresh bread was baking...it never came. 
When we made the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything tonight , we said our anniversary. At seating we were asked again...why?  Not sure. We thought maybe a little dessert. Nothing...so why ask!

2065007,2017-07-13,0,rN3gHTjqx5sOnoUpJ-6jyg,"For those with little patience (which I completely understand having just wasted three hours of my life at Edge Steakhouse): 
Don't eat here! the steak is great, as you would EXPECT for any $70+ steak, most everything else is good but not mind blowing. The service was horrendous and for the price I was left having the least satisfying dining experience of my whole life. I've had food poisoning I enjoyed more than eating here. 

The longer:

I was at a convention, me and my colleagues were very hungry after a long day and already at the Westgate, we decided to eat at Edge vs more than a dozen other good steakhouses in Vegas, purely for convenience. 

After being seated our party of five looked at the menu and figured at those prices we were at least going to have the best dinner of our trip. Nope. 

Our appetizers took forever, I will say that the bone marrow flatbread was delicious. Really it was the only stand out dish of the night. The waiter even apologized about how long it was all taking and bought us a round of drinks. 

They did have a few other large parties come in, but they were not full, and this is frickin vegas. And you're in a casino. If you can't handle it when it's busy literally stay out of the kitchen, and the dining room too. Every course came out painfully slow. Salad was fine, Panera makes better (and has a drive through). Steak as stated was good. How hard is that to mess up really? Truffle fries weren't as good as the ones I had two days ago at Umami Burger. Dessert (7layer chocolate cake) was good, no more. 

3 hours people. Maybe a hair over. It took 20 minutes to get our bills!! My water glass didn't get refilled for the last 50 minutes I sat there!!!  

My waiter, Mark, must have been ecstatic when we asked for split tickets (business trip remember) because turns out in parties that size (5) they include a whopping 20% gratuity when you split the ticket. Of course, he didn't tell us that until he brought the bills. He made out because I felt he deserved a kick to the groin instead. 

My bill was just under 200 all together, that's right, for that much you can eat at Ruth's Chris, Morton's and probably 174 independent steakhouses in the US and have killer service. I only kept my mouth shut to not cause a scene with business associates. In retrospect I wish I'd left after the appetizers and gone for fast food.",7RDC-pm_mQe1zS7PKGnw7w,0,0,1,A0HUzYKyge6qnGfTSGZ8Cg

We were seated at a gorgeous and comfortable booth right in the dining area. It was wonderful because it seemed as if we were in our own little dining room with the privacy the booth gave us. Then we were greeted by Bobby our server, so incredibly kind, knowledgeable and fun. He explained about the restaurant and how we came at the perfect time as the extraordinary (my words not his, LOL) Chef Steve had just created a new Spring menu.

I love getting all the information I can about the food on the menu so before each portion of the meal we were told what was in each aspect of the dish. For appetizers we had Beet Salad, Bone Marrow Pizza, and my absolute favorite the Beef Tartar with Caviar. It was everyone's first time trying caviar and we are all now HUGE fans. I would HIGHLY suggest ordering any and all of those when you go visit.

Next course was the English Pea Soup with Morel Mushrooms, mind you I am not a fan of mushrooms but I had to try it, and was I surprised as to how amazing it was! All of the ingredients and flavors in the soup mixed together perfectly.

After that it was the main course, I had the 7 oz Filet, which was melt in your mouth perfection. It was paired along with the Whipped potatoes and Lobster Mac & Cheese, I know my potatoes and these were whipped so finely that it was like butter in your mouth, so creamy and delicious. The Lobster Mac & Cheese had the right amount of cheese and lobster, not too much of either, so yummy!!!

My boyfriend has the John Dory, a fish I have never tried before, but was it absolutely delicious!!!! Each bite had more flavor than the next, I think everyone at the table was worried about me for a moment as I was making the weirdest faces but it was that GOOD!!!! A must have!

We wrapped up the meal with the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulle, which I have never really been a fan of at other restaurants, Chef Steve has officially changed my mind on that, at least at The Edge Steakhouse anyways!

I have travelled alot and have been fortunate to have amazing meals but The Edge Steakhouse and Chef Steve's masterful culinary mind and insane talents have proven that I knew nothing before, this, by far is the best meal I have had to date. If you make your way to Vegas you HAVE to come to The Edge Steakhouse, otherwise you are missing out on an amazing experience.

***SUMMER UPDATE***
Can you tell I love it here?! I'm getting hungry again just looking at my most recent pictures! My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we tried the Summer tasting menu that was released the day before we visited! The meal started off with a sort of asiago bread while we were waiting on our drinks. Which by the way were yummy! I got the Moscow mule which was absolutely refreshing!!! Then we had a tasting of three of the appetizers, beef tartar (my favorite), spicy shrimp that has a kick at the end, and a heirloom tomato salad with avocado. All light and not filling so you could enjoy the rest of the meal. Next up gazpacho with king crab, now I'm not much a fan of gazpacho but WOW! Then we had the Beef Wellington with Foie Gras, vegetables and a side of the garlic, whipped potatoes. I am spoiled now, between the perfection of the temperature of the meat and the Foie Gras paired with the Wellington I will not be able to enjoy it anywhere else!!! The meal was finished off with a yummy birthday vanilla bean, raspberry topped cheesecake!!! DELISH!!

It is impressive as hell when almost everybody that is working the room will come by and check on your table. Not in an annoying fashion, but in a wonderful service fashion.  You just really don't get that anymore. Aside from the fabulous service, the food was excellent. We enjoyed a spicy shrimp and a pea ravioli stuffed with prosciutto and cheese to start. We split their classic steakhouse chopped salad.  We enjoyed the Harris Ranch filet and bone in ribeye. Our side dishes included the heavenly truffle mac & cheese and some sautéed mushrooms.   We finished with a piece of chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream on the side. The wine by the glass is reasonably priced and has a great variety to choose from.

2952496,2017-08-19,0,rN3gHTjqx5sOnoUpJ-6jyg,"TL;DR: restaurant served a lower grade of meat for the steak than what was ordered (received USDA choice, ordered Wagyu). Everything else was pretty nice. 

Was down in Vegas for one of the big pool tournaments and stayed at the Westgate. Decided to try the Edge steakhouse as it had so many positive reviews. They were running a special for the pool players so I took advantage (3 course meal for $40). 

I ordered a locally brewed pale ale and it was tasty (although my 2nd glass of it came with a fruit fly drowning in it).
I ordered spicy shrimp for the appetizer and it was also good.
No choice for dessert, got the creme brulee and it was just perfect.

I went out of order because I want to focus on the entree, I ordered a Wagyu top sirloin cap. Now, I'm not an expert but, I've taken a few BBQ and cooking classes and my favorite thing to cook is steak. I've cooked all kinds of steak and all kinds of grades (select, mostly choice as that's what the grocery stores have around here but I do manage to get prime from Costco from time to time). What I received was NOT Wagyu grade beef. It was regular, run of the mill USDA choice (if even that). It was cooked to a medium rare (how I ordered it) and for all intents and purposes it was seasoned well and done to my liking. It was also VERY chewy and that's how I know it wasn't Wagyu. A perfectly cooked, medium rare Wagyu steak should fall apart in your mouth it should be so tender. I've cooked my USDA prime steaks to medium and they are just amazingly juicy and tender. The steak I got from Edge was not that. 

Finally, the ambience was very nice and the service excellent. That's the only reason why I'm giving more than one star. I detest being cheated by restaurants that think they are pulling the wool over the customers eyes. 

Beware the quality of steak you get here. Everything else is pretty nice but, for the regular prices they're charging, I won't come back.",i5g8IoXL-JvW5DMOvickBQ,4,0,2,gFCEnZaqs3QqMIHJKOKrTg

Food was good! I ordered the lemon and herb chicken dish. It was good. The sauce it came with was very good. It was a dark sauce. My dish came in plated nice with mini onions, vegetables and chicken placed over creamy mashed potatoes with their sauce.
Good side dish.  One of the bigger ones. 
I would go there again for that dish.

I heard the spicy shrimp appetizer was good and there cheese cake pops were good.

We did have the private room which held 13 of us. The room had a long table and the wall was clear glass holding hundreds of wine bottles. 

For the petite steak with garlic mash potatoes and lemon and herb chicken and a beer and specialty drink our total was about $130.

Cocktails were about $16 & beers $6-10
Wine by the glass and by the bottle. If you want more than two glasses price was by the bottle.

Side dishes included items such as a lobster risotto, truffle mac and cheese. Wedge salads, shrimp. 

Mojitos were made well and they made drinks such as Moscow mule. Look it up.

3400228,2015-08-28,2,rN3gHTjqx5sOnoUpJ-6jyg,"If I had rated this after my first visit, it would have been a five. And if I were rating only the service and the meat (most important thing in a steakhouse, after all), it would still be a five.

Our first trip was the week it opened. They had transformed the gone-but-not-lamented Bistro Burger by partitioning off most of it (soon to be an Italian joint), and creating a very intimate, relaxing space.  Service was a little reminscent of the Keystone Cops, as a team of them scrambled over one another to wait on everyone, but at least they were erring on the side of overkill. In their enthusiasm, someone forgot to put in the order for my friend's rack of lamb, so they brought her out a complimentary assortment of cold seafood to tide her over while we started eating. They won my loyalty right there. 

As for the food that did arrive: thumbs up to the Edge salad, French onion soup, and I guess to the foie gras, which came on brioche French toast with chopped apples and maple reduction. A nice preparation, but it helps if you like foie gras, which I have decided I don't. (No fault of theirs). The crab cakes are actually made of detectable amounts of lump crab, and come with a tangy,remoulade with just the right amount of citrus.

The chicken and lamb were also both very good, but the star here is the steak. (What kind of a Communist orders chicken anway)? The cheapest beef here is prime grade. A couple of us got the American Wagyu rib cap (divine) and, since we wanted a bite, forced my poor brother-in-law to order the Japanese Wagyu at almost $90 for a small steak and nothin' else - not even a sprig of parsley. 

Normally, I would be having a heart attack just typing that bit of info, but instead, that memory makes me smile. It was literally like buttah - just melted in your mouth. I tried to encourage Babygirl to get one when we returned together, but she loves her filet, so she ordered from the lowly left column (prime grade - $65 for a 12 oz portion), and announced that not only was a knife unnecessary, she barely needed a fork. I know a spoon or a popsicle stick would have served just fine for my 48 hour buffalo short ribs: two hefty chunks of perfectly tender meat on a bed of whipped potatoes with delicious gravy and roasted vegetables (we'll get back to those in a minute).

Most beloved side dishes included the wasabi mashed potatoes (they come in a trio of flavors, you'll just have to man up and eat 'em all), asparagus with burrata and balsamic, cauliflower gratin, baked in I-don't-know-what sauce but it was creamy and cheesy and delicious, and the mushrooms, cooked in wine and topped with what must have been goat cheese because it was too good to have been anything else. 

Dessert, you ask? Well, let me enlighten you. Due to the faux pas with the lamb, our table was delivered an assortment of complimentary desserts, so I happen to have a wealth of information. Creme brulee' was well received, as were the trio of parfaits (I remember chocolate and red velvet. Maybe lemon?). Who cares? The real butt kickers were the cheesecake pops. They come in order of six, two of each flavor, all wonderful. The best is the peanut butter kind- it will put hearts in your cheeks like you've never had. Hint: it's the kind with the sprinkles on the outside, so if you have to share, make sure you hog those. Practice your innocent look.

Service seemed a lot more organized on our return trip; and, the hostess is a sweetheart, the bartender and the manager (maitre d' maybe?) seemed to be in a contest to out charm each other. They both won. All the waiters were pleasant and service was fine. 

So why the missing star? Well, I wish I could give them 4 1/2, and maybe I should have rounded up, BUT, the lobster bisque was disappointing - very thin and watery and not very flavorful. The ""roasted"" vegetables were cut into very small chunks, but didn't show evidence of having gone anywhere near an oven. They were not ""al dente"", they were practically raw.
And nobody liked the tiramisu. 

Now that we know what land mines to avoid, our next trip should be great. But there shouldn't be any land mines.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,3,4,AJd4RB9kV1zaxJ1ywTMZig

I had a reservation for 5 PM and was seated immediately after they opened.  My server, Mark, was excellent and his assistant, Max, was good, too!

I had studied the menu online and I ended with the following order--wild mushroom soup for a starter, the 10 ounce Manhattan sirloin (asked for it done blue), and for a side I got the lobster risotto.

Shortly after getting my iced tea, I was brought a Gruyere cheese popover in lieu of bread and a cup of soft butter.  The popover was excellent.  (Eat the popover while it's hot--it loses the popover fluffiness if you let it cool).

The mushroom soup was good although it wasn't the most appealing looking dish there could be.  When it was time for the main course, I heard a runner behind me ask ""black and blue"" and I knew he was delivering my steak.  The problem here is I didn't order it black and blue--just blue.  The char was good but to get it the steak was overcooked.  If I want it black and blue that's the way I'll order it.  The lobster risotto was OK.  There were some nice pieces of lobster but I'd recommend a different side.  I regretted not getting the truffle fries.

For dessert, I got the quad small cups of the following--S'mores Edge, red velvet cake, key lime pie, and cheesecake coulis.  The key lime was excellent and the s'mores was good.  The other two were just OK.  They almost looked like the servings that buffets are doing now.

Service was excellent as I stated.  Iced tea was refilled without needing to ask and Mark checked on my progress regularly.

The prices are high and are in line with some of the better steakhouses on the Strip which doesn't make sense.  They're Las Vegas Hilton prices in a Westgate world.

I'm so glad we did! We accepted a table in the bar and for that they comped our drinks. The waitstaff was fun, interesting, and took time to chat with us. Our food was amazing!!! Steaks flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had the brussels sprouts side and he had the truffle fries. Perfect. Dessert choices were cheesecake or creme broule.  We both chose the broule-  arrived flaming. Creamy underneath and gorgeously crisp on top. Would highly recommend Edge!",0oRPcXNnK0oEF1qnwUiYXw,0,0,5,_kguXIRNI8Yd4EgVZaqL4w

There entire team is top notch! The greeters, our waiter, the water guys, and the bartender were all incredibly kind and accommodating. Our waiter was very impressive, his knowledge of the menu was boundless, and it made our great meal even better. 

As for the food I picked Edge based on reputation and a desire to try some new things. When we sat down we were given these very tasty popovers. Then we got started with a cheese board, wagyu beef tartare, and the bone marrow flat bread.

I love cheese/meat boards but they are often hit/miss, this one was a hit! Three varieties of cheese (goat cheese and two other), preschutto, chorizo, apricots, pecans, crustini, and honey. The combinations of texture were fun to explore and all of it was absolutely delicious. 

The bone marrow flat bread was very different but in a good way I can't quite describe. Overall very enjoyable.

The beef tartare was made from Japanese A5 beef which I believe is essentially Kobe. It was molded together with a sort of citrus/mayo, topped with caviar, and served with crackers. The medley of textures and flavors was absolutely fantastic.

Along the way I also enjoyed a manhattan and a Vegas dream cocktail. Both were incredible. The Vegas dream was a orange vodka, champagne concoction that really hit the spot. 

For my entree I got the 10 oz wagyu sirloin with a side of whipped Yukon gold potatoes. Great piece of meat, perfectly cooked, overall a fantastic finish to the meal. 

5 star from the atmosphere, to the staff, and the food. Literally my only disappointment was that the salmon belly crudo was not on the menu at the moment (I really wanted to try it ha)",4SQcgKAPYV9RUWdzNO8D8g,0,0,5,o-H61NaKD3lzfao_Qmui8A

Thank you, Alex (Chang K) and Liman, for the greatest service! You guys were very personable and attentive. Ask for either one of them to wait on your table. You won't regret it.

The food was amazing! Great flavors and perfect preparation and presentation. The $150 3-course Tomahawk and Lobster for two was a great deal. The lobster is a little bland, but pair the meat with roasted mushrooms and garlic potatoes, you're all set. Don't forget the dessert!

I have been several times with my girlfriend and my parents and time after time we are amazed by the staff and the delicious food that is prepared.
Each season there is a few items that are specific for the season, the most recent visit we enjoyed a plethora of items from the menu. 
We started off with the Parisian gnocchi with morel mushrooms, my father is like a kid in a candy store when this starter comes out! He used to pick fresh morel's back in Iowa and they are as amazingly fresh in the gnocchi as they were when he picked them back at home. We continued on with a few more starters, Beef tartare, a family favorite and the spicy shrimp which has a kick to it but even my girlfriend who cannot eat spicy food enjoys it!
My father continued on with the Cream of cauliflower soup, to say he enjoyed it is an understatement, each bite he had to express how delicious it was.
The hospitality continued with the beef Wellington (melt in your mouth good) with the lobster tail, seasoned and cooked perfectly. 
This restaurant is perfect for every occasion, birthdays, anniversaries, work dinners, etc. From the hostesses, to the bartenders, wait staff and chef Steve we feel right at home every time we step into Edge Steakhouse. A MUST visit!",rXggvaSuQXLKyLGJm3OuUg,0,0,5,Pq3e5GfQz55KMLa6pnp62Q

But I truly cannot compliment chef Steve Young enough!!! The food was so amazing we asked to meet the chef and even took a picture with him. Overall the entire expierence was amazing.

The hostess, Cheryl was amazing in accomadating us. She is a true professional and made us feel at home from the get go. For starters we shared the Steak Sashimi and the Seared Foie Gras. Amazing!! Both the presentation and the taste were top shelf. I had the 10 oz Manhattan Sirloin with a side of Brussels sprouts, melted in my mouth, I believe they added some kind of Thai Chili to the Brussels Sprouts which gave it such a mouth watering little kick! My Wife had the 48 hour Buffalo Short Ribs. They just melted in your mouth like butter, and the portion was so generous! Mike came from behind the Bar to take care of us. He is a Real Charmer! He made us feel So Comfortable and we shared a few good laughs together. They have some great wines by the glass, I like my Old Fashions though. Mike made it ""The Way It Should Be Made""!!

For a high end steakhouse it wasn't as expensive or crowded as others I've been to in Vegas. I suppose being in a value hotel/casino like The Westgate hurts some of it cache, but make no mistake it's as good as any steakhouse anywhere.

The service was exceptional and our waiter Bobby was informative and made sure we had a great meal and time. Our steaks were perfect and the sides were awesome. I'd highly recommend trying the bone marrow flat bread and the lava cake dessert.",MOVWIxCVT-WcWnOAxpAXKA,0,0,5,Trq1zrBop9Sil44Q_eUCUQ

The beef was just how it should be, fatty from the heavy marbling and an intense buttery flavor.  It's rich and melts in your mouth.  The outside was seared perfectly with a nice crunch to compliment the juicy center.  It's a small piece of meat with a ton of flavor.  I would choose this over one of the larger options.

Rib eye, the king of steaks. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with a salt and pepper rub. I also ordered a side of Mac and cheese. If you like cheese, do it! It has a veal reduction in it which makes it good. Filet mignon 7 ounce, Perfectly bloody, and yummy....moo!!!. Lobster risotto, yummy but they used a bit of tarragon, not my favorite but good aside form hat personal preference.

5837887,2016-08-25,12,rN3gHTjqx5sOnoUpJ-6jyg,"It was high time that I tried Westgate's new upscale dining venue, Edge Steakhouse, that I had been eyeing for awhile.  And, once I had worked my way through 6 extensive courses, along with Diane and two friends, I was quite impressed with what I encountered, including a capacious contemporary dining room and a spacious elongated booth.  

A Prawn Cocktail offered at the dizzying price of $36.00 was actually worth the freight: sweet and meaty.  I was told that seafood is flown in fresh here daily, and I believe it!  A bowl of French Onion Soup served in a classic ceramic, lion-headed white crock was one of the best I have ever enjoyed, with a gooey mixture of Gruyere and Swiss Cheese rolling over the top.  A savory Chopped Salad was a large starter featuring big chunks of bacon.  Well-made Iced Tea was served in a tall glass beside a filled carafe conveniently left on the table.  I just was not that into the complimentary baked puffs of dough that served as a bread product and resembled Yorkshire Pudding . 

As a tasty interlude, Silk Road Spicy Shrimp, a special of the house, sported plump shrimp graced by smears of spiciness; and a platter of fragile slices of Pepper Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that were tender and mouth watering.  Then came our main: a nicely seasoned and buttery medium-rare Petite Filet accompanied by excellent Bearnaise Sauce, top-grade Peppercorn Sauce, and a sweet lobster tail split in half for me and my spouse, which tasted great dipped in Buerre Blanc.  Mysteriously the menu indicated that the Petite Filet was 7 oz. in size, but the check said 6 oz.  If it was 6 oz., my Filet was a large 6.

Sides were no less inviting: a magnificent Truffle Mac N Cheese graced by Demi Glace, a large array of assorted varieties of Sauteed Mushrooms, and a large Baked Potato adorned with butter, chives, and bacon.  The only service errors of the night was our server initially forgetting to provide my ordered Baked Potato, and then the bacon and chives when it was fairly quickly produced.  The spud was large and the skin well rubbed with salt.  A delicious repast!

But a meal of this magnitude would not be complete without a memorable dessert!  So we all opted to share a large slice of 7-Layer Chocolate Cake and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  Paired up, the mixture was simply divine.  And there was cake to spare.  Chef de Cuisine Steve Young came by to see if we were enjoying our meal.  Very much, thank you!  Hostess, manager, and waitstaff were all friendly and helpful.  And all food was top shelf and delicious.

I will surely be back for more of the same!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,25,24,5,tWSsk-KDXntPfnQ1PEQinw
