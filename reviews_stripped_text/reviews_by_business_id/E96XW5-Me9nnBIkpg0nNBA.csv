Definitely for the party crowd (everyone dressed up to eye candy level while they took me in with w sweats on) but that's just the entire hotel atmosphere.

1591129,2017-06-10,0,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,"What a great spot! I had dinner here and it was delicious! With a very modern saloon style atmosphere, Blue Ribbon offers an eclectic menu of steaks, oyster bar, fried chicken, fish, soups and salads, and much more. They had this neat veil that came across the middle of the restaurant to separate the bar from the dining room for private parties which was really different.

Our bartender Shea was great! He was friendly, he knew just what to suggest, and he was funny. We had the house cabernet which was Bench 2015 and it is now my favorite cabernet. I even went out to buy some from the liquor store yesterday.

For an appetizer my friend and I had the shrimp and lobster cocktail. They were both chilled and succulent. Next we had the endive salad. The blue cheese, arugula, and beets were put together well, however I wasn't a huge fan of the endives. None the less still satisfying.

For entrees we had the 12oz NY Strip prepared medium with a red wine reduction sauce that was perfect! The steak was cooked properly, the meat was tender, and the sauce was scrumptious!

The fried chicken was our second entrée and it had to be the best fried chicken I've ever had!! Definitely recommend! It was crispy, salty, a little spicy, and the meat was moist. So good oh my goodness! I could rave about this all night. The only thing I wasn't too much a fan of was the gravy on the mash, it was a bit sweet like honey. 

Overall, this restaurant was great! The service was excellent and so was the food!",i6YHXZfcdtDzZSeEF9Wo3w,4,1,5,95UDppUCze7nbvFG5vB9kQ
1673995,2018-05-11,0,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,"Excellent cannot even describe the delicate fresh food blue ribbon served. The filet was medium rare with truffle butter. Perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth--barely a need to chew. The baby squid was sautéed perfectly and the texture was unbelievable! So tender with just enough of the chew one longs for in squid. The oysters were fresh and tasted like the ocean. The mignonette was classic and they also offered a fresh pico which was also a delight. 

A highlight of sauce was the habenero carrot sauce. This is so spicy but flavorful with a bit of sweet at the end. I'm a hot sauce snob and this sauce left me wanting more. I ate the bread with it and almost finished the bottle. 

Highly recommend blue ribbon.",jNx2yH68BKhgxlsROOdtew,1,0,5,wV8l2bDKyOfMZlQ5G4F14Q

She also loved the sides that came with it and thought her fish was so-so.

We ordered the ""Bucket"" of wings for our appetizer and it was amazing you could literally see the seasoning, it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The wasabi honey sauce that came with it was okay.

I ordered the salmon and my husband got the hanger steak. My salmon came with two sides but our server neglected to tell us this information. The steak did not come with a side so my we ordered mash potatoes because we were told that the entrees didn't come with a side. The portion of steak was very small but it tasted good.

2079557,2018-06-29,0,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,"Recently went to dine at Blue Ribbon Brasserie at the Cosmopolitan before attending a show there. Was looking for something not too fine dining, casual and fun and this place was spot on! The menu is what I would consider more 'American' with emphasis on seafood including a seafood 'raw' bar. Oddly enough, we tried their version of a Chinese classic - the 'Pu Pu Platter'! LOL So their version included: a BBQ Chicken Wing, Pork Spare Rib, Sesame Shrimps, Fried Oyster, Chicken Skewer and a Duck Egg Roll. Now it is $20 per person but as you can see a good sampling of different items - the bbq chicken wing is more 'lollipop' style and the sesame shrimp and spare rib were amongst the favorites. We also had the Fried Catfish sandwich and it was good portion sized - nice and crispy outside and juicy on the inside. We also had one of their signature deserts: Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding featuring Vanilla Ice Cream & Hot Fudge - ideal for sharing. A good music mix was playing and the restaurant had a nice energy - and we enjoyed great and consistent service from Ken. Would highly recommend as a fun, casual option or a place to hang out with friends and enjoy appetizers, raw bar and cocktails. Hope to visit again soon.

2124781,2017-07-31,0,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,"There are so many dining experiences to choose from while staying at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. My fiancé and I remember Blue Ribbon when it was strictly a sushi restaurant. A few months ago when we were in Vegas we wanted to go there for sushi and realized it no longer existed. It ended up going through a restructuring of its menu and now it's serves American fare. When Adam saw that menu, he wanted to dine there the first night. Since I was really craving sushi, we decided on Zuma for the first night (review posted below.) The second night, I knew he had his heart on Blue Ribbon so we dined there. We went to at about 6 PM on a Sunday night and were able to be seated right away. It was not very busy at all since we showed up early so we didn't need a reservation. I would recommend making one if you're planning to eat later in the evening. We were approached right away by our server, Mark. He did a wonderful job in explaining the menu's most popular items, the size of the servings, and checked up on us  just the right amount. Not so much that it was annoying, but often enough that if we needed something he was right there. We decided to get all dressed up and treat ourselves to some fancy Las Vegas food. I love the atmosphere. As soon as you walk in, it looks like swanky and hip meets classy and sophisticated. It is apparent that they worked very hard to revamp this place. I always loved it when I was a sushi restaurant, too. The only thing that seems familiar about the venue is the bathroom. Once we sat down, took our photos, breathed in the ambience of the place, and studied the menu - we realized that we were both starving. A full day at the pool with very little to eat made us want to order almost everything on the menu. We decided to start out with the wedge salad. It was absolutely delicious. They also bring out bread with the most delicious tasting better. I highly recommend splurging on that. Adam ordered the PuPu platter which was a mix of wings, shrimp, ribs, and a few other delicious items. I got the salmon served with mashed potatoes, veggies, topped with potato crisps. All photographed below. Because we were starving, we shared everything and it was the perfect amount of food. We were full and knew we were not going to get dessert, but I asked for the menu anyway. We didn't order anything so I don't know how it tasted, but I wasn't really impressed with the dessert menu. Overall, this is a perfect Las Vegas dining experience. Complete with excellent service, a good variety of food items, and a great atmosphere. Enjoy!.",hA2X9akTxboda17YqbF20g,2,2,4,kKJPwYYn9WRy8Tc_k7kj-w
2207933,2017-08-27,1,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,"Service 4/5, Food 3/5, and ambiance 4/5

I guess if I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would, however the food just didn't cut it for me to give them 4 stars. I came here with my family as we usually stay at the Cosmopolitan a few times a year. In November of 2016, I came to the old Blue Ribbon sushi and grill restaurant and was blown away by their omakase course. Everything was fabulous.....so when we found out that Blue Ribbon reopened, we were super excited. 

But.....this place is completely different. It's not a Japanese restaurant...there is no sushi. I think that they were going for a fusion thing, but adding some yellowtail sashimi, oshibori (wet towels), and chopsticks to eat with, doesn't really make this Japanese. This place gives off a funky upbeat steak and seafood vibe that caters toward wine and cocktail drinkers. 

[The restaurant] 
Ambiance is nice and dimly lit with a classy feel. 
The music is a mix of funky upbeat 80s vibe , but the music was way too loud. It made it hard to hear the waiters and the other people in our party. 

[The food] 
-Drink // A Letter to Rio // 13.00 // cacheca, prosecco, honey, and lime juice was decent but is on a stronger side and isn't sweet at all. So if you like sweet drinks you may want to opt for the sangria. 

-complimentary // bread // delicious! Probably one of my favorite things here beside the fois gras. 

-appetizer // the platter // 81.00 // mix of raw oysters, raw clams, shrimp cocktail, rock crab claws, lobster tail, and jumbo sweet shrimp. This platter was decent, but it lacked flavor. The butter aioli tasted bland and was too thick. I would have just preferred melted butter and lemon. My oyster was a bit slimy (but I just think I'm not much of an oyster fan). My brother said that his had sand in it. 

-appetizer // fois gras // 26.00. // very rich and served with toast. This was tasty. The candied apples added a nice sweetness to it. 

-appetizer // yellowtail jalapeño sashimi // 22.00 // it was too spicy with that jalapeño with all the seeds still in it. Thin pieces seemed too pricey for what you can get elsewhere. 

-entree // shrimp Provençal // 28.00 // this was one of the recommended items by our waiter. It was meh. In my opinion, the cream sauce was too salty and didn't have any flavor to it. I liked the noodles though and they gave 6 prices of shrimp! 

Overall, this place had a nice atmosphere for a date but not for a family dinner. The waitress was super nice and gave my baby sister a pen and paper to draw with. My family wasn't impressed by the steak or lamb, they thought the steak was overdone. For the price, I would probably use that money and pay a little more for one of the other delicious restaurants in the Cosmo.",N8pDUHsa29bS3_P-fWFebg,5,2,3,N1kibHbE9IwPbwRAJE5dfQ
2226489,2018-05-28,0,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,"I only tried the Fried Chicken plate which included mashed potatoes and greens.

The best part about my dining experience here was the staff - friendly and excellent in service.

The fried chicken was cooked correctly - the chicken tender and moist and the fried batter crunchy as expected. But the food lacked any discernible flavor that would have me believe this was a fried chicken worthy of the praises I read online. Perhaps some side sauces would make the chicken a better taste experience, but I like fried chicken to stand on its own merits.

The greens included with the meal were too salty for me, but the mashed potatoes were the best tasting food on the plate, which I put to good use in mixing with the fried chicken.

For me the meal did not meet the level of the price paid.

Given it was one of the few restaurants still open at 12am we figured they'd have good options for us.  Not really the case.  They had a few appetizers that were good for a small crowd but very little to choose from as far as meals unless you wanted something fussy like pigeon or duck.  Nit at midnight.  We orderrd the pupu platter which I was surprised to ser given the rest ofvthe menu.  It was okay.  Lots of fried things that I couldn't really identify though fairly tasty.  We also got a couple burgers and paella.  The bar burger was literally a piece of beef between two pieces of bread.  Nit even ketchup.  The blue ribbon burger was the other extreme.

Really liked the vibe at this restaurant, it was dark, chill, inviting, but not stuffy.  I remember walking into this restaurant and thinking ""Wow, this place must be expensive..."", but I was surprised by the reasonable prices on their menu.  Most appetizer items run for about $20, whereas the entrees are about $30-$40 range with a few exceptions.

Since I was here with a large group of people, I got to sample many of the menu items.

My favorites:
- Barbequed Duroc Pork Ribs: Served over a mini grill and glased with Sesame BBQ.  Sweet and cooked to perfection.
- Rack of Lamb: Served with Spinach, Mashed Potatoes and Thyme.  They made it just the way I liked it - medium rare.  Oh yum!

Also tried their Cheese Fondue, Hummus, Paella Basquez that evening, but unfortunately, these items did not win my heart.  Nevertheless, service was excellent and the server kept our glasses filled.

We started off at the bar, and the bartenders were so friendly and fun that we almost decided to dine there. Unfortunately, sitting side by side doesn't lend for easy conversation with a group. So we moved to a table.

The ambiance/decor is hip but comfortable.

We were greeted by every staff member we passed. Our server was friendly, professional, attentive, and uniquely polite. He would wait a few feet away when he realized we were in a serious point of our conversation instead of bulldozing over just to get what he needed done.

The menu is varied and interesting that it was difficult to decide what to order, which I love. We started with a 1/2 dozen east coast oysters and steak tartare. Both of which were absolutely delicious. I could've ordered another steak tartare as my entree. One of us had the fried chicken and two of us had the filet with truffle butter. C'MON. Perfectly cooked and every bite was well seasoned. We shared the sweet potato side, and although I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, I could've licked the bowl clean.

I ordered the John Daly to drink (three to be exact). It was very well balanced and consistent in its delicious taste all three times.

I already plan to go back with several friends for a birthday celebration. Hoping more people give this place a shot so the overall review score can be fixed!",KrQ9XPD0AoMrORH3Dc-XZA,2,1,5,SWZEwR3Z1fnR-PxSWCbzKg

The inner pyro in me was a huge fan of the blue tipped matches that they have in the matchboxes up in front.  

Appetizers:  Oysters - you can get a selection of east coast or west coast.  
Wings - Fried and seasoned to perfection.  I felt like these were better than the entree fried chicken.  There's more seasoning on these.
Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi - light and tasty but with a slight kick from the jalapeno.
Hummus - very creamy and robust in flavor

Entrees: 
Fried chicken: Similar to the wings but you're getting more of the chicken.   I like the appetizer wings better, but if you're not ordering those, definitely get this.
Skate - This time I decided to be a little more adventurous and order the skate.  At first my friends and I had no idea what it was but I figured why not try it out.  I figured at worst the potatoes, bacon, and shrimp that it comes with would be a solid consolation prize.  All of it works together very well.

Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding.  It's a smaller portion where 1 bread pudding fan could easily finish this alone.  Sorry friends, next time I'm not sharing.
Sundae.  This was amazing. It's also fairly big in size, so this is probably a better dessert that you can share.

They brought her a bowl of it which was very nice. 

I ordered the lobster. It was perfect and was served with two sides. It came with corn and a baked potato. The corn on the cob and the baked potato did not have any flavor and I did not finish them. The lobster was melt in your mouth and buttery. The large portion food and service was well worth the price tag. For the two dishes and two beers with tip we paid $137.99.

I loved Blue Ribbon over the years in NYC through their various outlets. 

Vegas - They no longer serve an extensive menu for sushi accordingly to the hostess. I'm guessing they are playing nice with Zuma across from them.

We ended up having a simple sashimi platter (good), onion soup (yum), steamed clams (yum), grilled asparagus (disappointed that they were just cooling off from ROOM TEMPERATURE. The bread basket was MEH, butter is better than the bread so they didn't think it needs to be good? Maybe?

Service was soo disappointing at Blue Ribbon Vegas that I won't be returning. We went to Giada the night before and the service was immaculate. What happened? It was 10pm, I ordered soup and sashimi right off the bat with our drinks. When the waiter came back to pour the wine, he didn't ask if we were ready to order more, he just left without eye contact. The same waiter didn't pick up finished plates. Things just piled up until the bus person picked it up. A different server ended up clearing the table when finished. He tried to wipe off crumbs and start cleaning the table, even came between me and my partner from behind only to brush off crumbs on our corner booth seat. The crumbs remained on the seat between us. He didn't wipe crumbs onto his own napkin... it was rude, ineffective, unnecessary. sigh. Just wait for us to leave couldn't you?

Not only does it have that hip vibe unlike other hotel/casinos on the strip **cough cough Bellagio** but it has a really neat lineup of restaurants. Eggslut, Milkbar, Momofuku...just to name a few. I was also really intrigued to try the Wicked Spoon buffet, but came a few minutes too late, as they closed at 9pm. I am not sure why one of the most popular buffets in Vegas closes at 9, but I decided to give Blue Ribbon a shot. 

The service was extremely friendly and I loved the vibe of the restaurant. But their famous fried chicken platter had much to be desired. The chicken was overcooked and bone dry on the inside. While the skin was super crispy, as a result, it lacked that certain ""slutiness"" I desire in a fried chicken. Honestly, I think I would have rather had Popeye's chicken. That's not a huge knock on Blue Ribbon, as I'm sure they would also acknowledge the fact that Popeye's chicken is pretty dang good, and lands at about 1/5th of the price tag. I would definitely come back next time I'm around these parts of town and try some of their other menu items.

This place definitely fell way short of that. Came here on Monday night with a group of my friends. It was an extremely slow night, but it seems like the place was definitely overstaffed. Seems like a great combo right? Nope. Our server was never to be found...wait...actually I found him just talking and with other servers with nothing else to do at the bar. Finally got his attention we decided to order some food, ordered the branzino, paella, French onion soup, and chicken sticks. I'm not quiet sure what this restaurant's theme is, but the branzino was prepared as California style with guac and corn. Paella was good and it was packed with seafood, which is obviously Spanish. Then the French Onion soup (you should know where that's from) was too sweet. Then the chicken sticks...ground up chicken fried and served with honey wasabi sauce (Southern?). Oh yea, there's also oysters, matzo ball soup, and fondue. 

Is this restaurant trying a little too hard? Yes, I would definitely say so.

Also, asked the server what the well rye whiskey was, he answered ""I'm not sure, probably Jack Daniel's."" Seriously...please train your servers of the restaurant's basics. We were the only table that's bigger than a 2 top and the manager never came over to check on us, and actually the server had difficult looking for him when he needed his manager approval at the POS.

This cocktail packs a secret punch, doesn't taste like there's even a drop of alcohol but you'll definitely feel it before knowing it! prefer drinks crafted like this! A fusion of teas infused with vodka mixed with lemonade. Those shrimp skewers were huge and their ribs were absolutely finger-lickin' good with a fun presentation. It comes with crispy strips and a mini coal fired grill to cook the ribs, perfect for someone like me who eats slow and loves her food hot! I've never tried honey mustard with ribs but this dish came with a ramekin of specially made honey mustard, and wow its an explosion of flavors in your mouth. Juicy, tangy, sweet, smokey, goodness! 

For our main entrees we had the pigeon and salmon. I ordered the pigeon to be cooked just as the chef recommends, and it came to me in tender slices. The drumsticks are my favorite part. Loved how this dish was served with farro, it's the perfect grain in substitution for rice and so much more exciting to see on your plate rather than the usual quinoa. The salmon was grilled just right, each piece flaked off effortlessly onto the fork, and served with crispy strips on top of a bed of creamy mash potatoes, livin for the texture these crispies add! We ended with creme brûlée as dessert, lined with true pure vanilla bean on the bottom of the dish, delicious! No disappointment here, although completely different concepts, I enjoyed Blue Ribbon grille in LV just as much as Blue Ribbon sushi in MIA!",0_KCK9S9j5FhlY0Duf6Lrw,4,3,5,MqWeYpNV6It4UEh0LuRETA

My husband got the fried chicken which looked like half of a chicken, fries and greens. He really enjoyed it. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. A little pricey but that was expected. Michael was our great server.",0UVB_SqSprtPoEM37bZn3Q,0,0,4,RJzaXDPLWyBovopBezkXTA

OK so my hubby and I came into the strip on Saturday night and had parked at Bally's (note: it's not free parking-we paid $7 for a few hours)

Anywhoo with no intention of going out to eat, we saw this shop on the way down the escalators and thought why not as we'd heard great thing about it from the Yelp Elite crew that went (I missed out)

And I'm so glad we did! 

We weren't starving - so I ordered the 1 wing and hubby got the thigh or was it breast... whatever it was he loved it. Thick and juicy - lol!

I love love the seasoning and my wing was perfect and moist too! 

With it I ordered the Moscato and Modelo 24oz can and we were set! 

Food was FABULOUS!
Service was SENSATIONAL!

Staff were spot on service and you weren't standing around guessing. They were all very cool! 

Thank you! We'll be back for sure!",TEYwFtIioGhcHp38LwIhsg,1,1,5,xtSEnaFky25CrkzAQQ9I7Q

Service was great and food was delicious. Most comfort food places use the cheapest ingredients to make cheap dishes... this place has traditional ""cheap"" dishes, but the ingredients are top quality and the final result is amazing. I enjoyed each visit and will for sure be back for more.",w90KNnzS6Ao3k-njRlCEeA,1,1,5,li4ZFXuWW3nh1uo3nGjqYw

But this place was our kind of restaurant.  The staff was friendly and the food was AMAZING. The oysters looked like something out of a foodie magazine. So FRESH. And the custom made sauces were perfect. No need to add extra lemon or tabasco. I ordered the lobster and my husband ordered the New York strip. Both were cooked to perfection. I will be back. So glad to finally find a good restaurant in Las Vegas. It ain't easy. When you find a good one, you're lucky.",iio854xCFAgae5ShYQdI1Q,0,0,5,gusQ_LEPjTfJT4ltXUG2fg
5929370,2017-06-28,1,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,"When checking into the hotel, we were told Blue Ribbon was the newest and really really good so figured we'd give it a try. *There is a dress code and we were in our swim wear but they let us dine in the bar area with full menu service. Perfect. 

Ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees. A burger and lamb chops. Our waiter was very nice but after asking our entrees twice, he never came back. It was about 30 mins after we finished our appetizer that I decided to go find someone to see what was going on. I told was told they would go and find out then let us know. Another waiter came to us and asked if we were informed by the previous waiter that there is a longer wait for the lamb chops. We were not informed but regardless, would it really take 40 mins from when we ordered...? I've never heard of that from any other restaurant before. He told us it would be right out and so we waited a little longer.

Finally we just decided to ask if they can pack it to-go because we didn't expect it to take so long and we had to get back up to the room. Giving a couple stars since the waiters were nice and the food was actually pretty good. I just don't think they should have people waiting around. The kitchen should probably be more prepared.",vpHYPX77WQyuObd8MRndig,1,0,2,s-2ZyodRbnwxQS3rRq9o4w
5945915,2018-02-10,0,E96XW5-Me9nnBIkpg0nNBA,Very good in summary. Service is downright superb (bar area is Blair). The food is good to very good and compared to years in past there seems to be a slight deficit. Lastly and important to me is the limited in selection and diminished quality wine list. Acknowledging this is Vegas and a substantial CA wine list is key the selection outside CA (cabs) is less than in the past. Worthy the compliment is the Spanish selection of wines. Very good quality and price points here.,RllgzwSE8otB8VSbYchNUQ,0,0,4,LGirm6bSVrWMtVHjRnCU_A

After experiencing STK the night before, we had a much better time at Blue Ribbon. Note that we are in our late 30's and early 40's. 

The ambiance in blue ribbon was very relaxing, with plenty of lighting and music at a volume where is was enjoyable but did not obstruct dinner table conversations. The table were appropriately separate so that you did not feel as if you were dinning with stranger next to you. 

Menu was fantastic, nothing was overly seasoned, spicy or to confusing. We split the pork rib starter, entrees of hanger stake & duck with a side of shoe string fires. Everything came out as expected. Desert was chocolate chip bread pudding, ice cream& fudge- delicious and easily split. 

Lastly the service was fantastic, drinks always full, warm bread, and dishes removed promptly. 

When comparing to stk, we had a much better tasting & more relaxing dinner at blue ribbon.",2G4wLWYtpJaVsaQ0dOxF0w,3,0,5,EO9o-WrQcUo4M1eeJVVbuQ
