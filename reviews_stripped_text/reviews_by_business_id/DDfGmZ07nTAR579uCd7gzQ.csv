1. I waited about 10-15 minutes for my food. I should've just went to a regular restaurant if I knew I was gonna be waiting that long.

2. AFTER they charged me for the McFlurry and after I waited 10-15 min, they told me their ice cream machine was down. I asked for a refund. They took too long with the refund so I just said screw it - give me cookies or something. So they gave me a bag of old & stale cookies.... thanks?

3. ALL of the food came cold. When I say cold .... I mean.... literally looked and tasted like it had been sitting for hours (you know that yucky McDonald's French fry taste after it was sitting for so long, so you microwave it?) that's how all of our food tasted. Even my COFFEE came cold. It tasted like it had been sitting & warmed with a microwave.

4. Not only was the food cold & stale... my Chicken tenders were so rock hard & over cooked that it's inedible!

So I just paid $20 for cold chicken, cold fries, cold coffee, all stale... all tasted like it had been microwaved..... and I waited sooo long for it to be disgusting and cold.

I have no words. I am appalled. Never again. Again, how do you fail at McDonald's?",WprLWLMfdlbstGuCQvUHJQ,0,0,1,95qlh6WgbCT7PmrO8Wi5oQ

Bad!! The floors were dirty, the customer service was nothing to talk about and the fries tasted like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long while.
FYI just because they are always busy doesn't mean they are good. McDonalds of all places!!!!",UlsZJ618qrY5W6NIcHk8pA,1,0,2,om1dZwr8gZmnvANfF-0c9A

It's not much to look at, but it was fine as far as McDonald's were concerned. I think other than not having an internal restroom they had the same offerings as a normal McDonald's, including fountain drinks. However, they did need significantly more time to prepare one of the items we bought.

The staff seemed to try too hard to be nice to us, but at least they tried to be nice.

They didn't have ordering kiosks so we ordered verbally.",Z9rSlTj3pJr2eI7eqWIlZQ,0,0,4,jc9tiADhrpwJI1IOtYuZiQ
3487433,2017-08-11,0,DDfGmZ07nTAR579uCd7gzQ,"I went with my children to this McDonalds today. So I ordered 2 kids meals and then 2 times Nr 7 medium with Dr Pepper. 
The staff of this McDonalds is absolut not capable to run this place. The girl on the register gave me 2 kids cups and then I asked where my cups are from the 2 meals? 
What meals? She asked
She put in a 10 piece chicken nugget order and not the 2 meals in medium with my drinks. 
A guy comes up and he got no clue how to fix it. Me terrible annoyed already. Then the manager comes over and I said you might want to train your Employees better to listen what your customers order. 
All I get to hear is the girl is new, she's been here for 2 weeks. Well if she doesn't know how to listen to a customer, she can't take a order. And if she has issues with taking orders, I don't know why she's still working there or why there's not someone else standing besides her helping doing the right thing. 
Needless to say, I wanted a refund and left that place.",_sPNv8mKDUlh20Pg8gVvcA,1,0,1,oDAEzRvQczUoveFr-zI3bw

This may seem like a harsh review, but standing in line with a hungry three year old and a cart full of groceries was not fun! Waited in line for about 15 minutes ... Pretty long time for fast food if you ask me!",B2h9-sbWmmVx6p3c8OJ3Lw,1,1,2,YGhX94c35abV-VFUIJ6xHA

She walked away with a shrug. 
Cashier does not smile and talk in a low tone voice. She looks sad and depressed. 

(Always smile when greeting customers) 

White caucasian man in a blue shirt dies not wear anyngloves when handling fries. He just drops everything in a to go bag without looking if it has spilled or not.

As we stepped up to her register she moved to the next. We were the only ones present at the time waiting. She hasn't greeted us yet. Her mgr. Comes up to us to tell us that girl will help us. So we stepped over to her and this girl rudely tells us wait over there where we were. We ordered the same order repeated twice and she didn't get the order. Then accused us of not ordering right. We waited over 20 mins, before cancelling our order by then over ten customers still waiting. While waiting for our change a person refused his ice cream after already handling it and this girl shook the ice cream back into the ice cream machine. I questioned her and told her that was cross contamination and she insisted they can do that!  Disgusting service!!",MGxkTz11cqu3hcKigS5-Nw,1,0,1,PFdXQhBbkqPYJKN_xbFFLA
