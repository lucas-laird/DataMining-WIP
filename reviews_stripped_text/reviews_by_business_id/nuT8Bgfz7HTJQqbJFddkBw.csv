19428,2014-11-30,1,nuT8Bgfz7HTJQqbJFddkBw,"My husband & I were staying at a resort that gave us a voucher towards dinner at Mad Onion- Hooters Casino.  Although we'd never been,we decided to go w/an open mind. Trying to find something healthy on the menu was near impossible. My husband finally settled on the crab legs & I settled on grilled fish. Unfortunately the crab legs were so skinny you couldn't get any meat out off them. The waitress came by & even she, admitted that they didn't look good & brought him a new plate that was marginally better. Then the waitress jokingly said, I suppose you don't like yours either?? Sheepishly, I said, well now that you mention it, the fish is covered w/a heavy flour  gravy w/sugar in it, which ruins the taste of the fish. Plus, a good part of the reason for ordering fish is to watch your calories. The menu didn't indicate gravy. In addition the menu said the fish came w/garlic mashed potatoes. There's nothing garlic about the potatoes, just a scoop of plain instant flavorless mashed potatoes. The waitress said that other patrons had the same complaint. Despite this, she didn't ask me if I'd like anything else instead. She just swooped my plate away w/out even asking me if it was okay & told me she would only charge me 1/2  for my entree. My husband & I looked at each other dumbfounded as I was hungry. So I spent the entire rest of the meal watching my husband eat. Luckily I had wine to sip on! Then the bill came & my husband noticed it was full price. So he gently reminded her that she said she'd take 1/2 off my meal. She told us that her manager told her she couldn't do it since I had eaten some of it. Well how would I have known it wasn't what I was expecting if I hadn't tried it? So she offered to get her manager who was a really young guy w/ 0 personality & customer relations skills. He obviously was not trained because he kept insisting he wasn't going to do anything even though the food was clearly different than what the menu described. If I was going to have to pay full price for my entree, the waitress should have left it on the table so I could have at least eaten the broccoli & tried to scrape the gross gravy stuff off & eat some of the fish. It was after all one of the more expensive things on the menu. I said I'd never heard of a restaurant that didn't offer something else if your food was bad. He said he had to do that cuz people try to take advantage of them. Well, I was very offended by that  because my husband & I are seasoned travelers & stay at all the top resorts.  I had never been to a HOOTERS & despite that I had heard of it's cheesy reputation, the woman who convinced us to go there said that the Mad Onion wasn't like a typical Hooters. She's right about that! It's worse! At least in a normal Hooters you wouldn't get all the casino smoke etc. We're not used to being treated so badly!

I was seated quickly and had a very nice server named Karen. I ordered the All American. The Home Fries were awesome. There's a lot of bad reviews on Yelp; I can imagine that comes from when the restaurant is very busy. If the Hooters restaurant is packed, then you will probably end up eating in this place.

My boyfriend took a gamble on the $9.99 12 oz prime rib and it so bad that he barely touched it and then stared at my plate until I offered some of my sandwich, which certainly wasn't the cat's meow either.  When we sat down to dinner, we hadn't eaten in over 12 hours.  The mozzarella sticks were the one item that I might order again if I were to bother coming bad, which I wouldn't.  The wait staff was friendly and I have no complaints there.  The restaurant was nice enough looking, but the bench seating was kind of low and the table seemed too wide for the spacing between the benches.  I sort of felt like the table was infringing on my personal space.  Bottom line, skip this place.

The first time I came here, I tried their Prime Rib dinner meal.  I was a bit dis-enchanted when I was told I couldn't substitute the potatoes for vegetables.  Damn, I forgot watching calorie intake in Las Vegas is not much of a priority I guess.  I must say the $10.00 Prime Rib dinner was good (for $10 that is.)  The second time was a bit annoying as I didn't even get seated.  I walked to the hostess table and I had to wait for a hostess to show up at the front desk.  I could see there was a party of 3-4 waiting in front of me.  The hostess came back and saw me waiting.  She didn't take my name down.  She went to seat the party of three that was ahead of me.  While doing that, somebody came in after me.  When the hostess came back, she proceeded to take names for the wait list.  And the guy who came in after me was placed on the list before me.  The hostess could have noticed that I was there first.  And she did see me waiting.  So I gave my name, but I walked out.  The place wasn't exactly busy either, which was puzzling.  I don't know.  This is basic ""Restaurant Hostessing 101"" stuff.  The first person a customer comes in contact should be the strongest link, not the weakest link.

It was about two years ago in 2010, when my family and my cousins family arrived in Las Vegas, looking for a bite to eat near the hotel we were staying at, and we found this place.

1st thing that sucked-We waited over an hour for our food and we were the only ones at the restaurant besides this other couple(who's food came before ours). 

2nd thing that sucked-My dad thought that they put too much dressing on his salad, so he asked if they could take the salad back, and instead of making a new salad, they added more lettuce which was ridiculous in this case.

Chicken Alfredo was flavorless with chicken that was overdone and dry. Nachos were stale with the lowest quality, congealed, canned cheese.

The special is after 12am, but I'd call ahead, and make sure. Happy hours always change in Vegas, better be sure if you're going.

The wings are bigger than standard Hooter's wings, HOWEVER, their sauces DO NOT TASTE THE SAME! We ordered an order of 911 as well as mild. Their mild was literally just breaded chicken with butter, their 911, while hot, spicy, and tasty, did not taste the same as Hooter's standard 911. I have to say, I like the Hooter's sauces better, but the wings here are bigger. So, that's the trade off.

Just like a regular Hooter's, I wouldn't order ANYTHING here, but the wings, as such, I can't vouch for anything else either.

There was also an option to get a prime rib dinner for two and a bottle of wine for $39.99 but I think we all opted for the $9.99 wineless option, which was a generous portion of prime rib, some mixed veggies which I suspect was one frozen, and your choice of mashed potatoes vs French fries. Au jus and horseradish was also plentiful on the side. I got my prime rib rare and it came out looking a but more medium rare; I noticed everyone who had gotten medium rare came out looking more medium as well.

1913419,2010-05-10,0,nuT8Bgfz7HTJQqbJFddkBw,"Hands down the worst dining experience i've ever had. Came here around 2 for the $0.25 wing deal. 
Started off by waiting about 30 mins to sit down at a table with no silverware or napkins. Our waitress shortly came over and took our order, but she clearly didn't want to be there. She looked pissed and gave short answers while mumbling mandatory offers like sauce for a dollar.
So we place our order. 10pc BBQ. 10pc med. 20pc hot. 10pc ""911"".
After 15 minutes or so. I start wondering how hard it is to dip premade wings into sauce and I notice that a party larger than us who arrived AFTER we ordered already got their food. I kindly asked the waitress to check on our food. She never returns. I flag down a manager who tells me there's 4 orders ahead of us, which obviously can't be right. 

After over 30 mins we get our wings. I decide to count them because I notice our neighbors got shorted some wings. As expected, I get 18 out of 20 wings. I ask ye waitress and she just takes my plate, brings it back and literally drops it in front of me like I did something to offend her. 

So afte all that, we're all pretty amazed by the service so far, and the wings are straight up filthy. My hot wings have little to no flavor except for the standard buttery grease. I barely see any wings under my friends mound of BBQ sauce. The medium wings look more bland than mine and the 911 wings looked painful. I ended up eating 8 out of 20 because I just felt absolutely disgusted. We had to literally go open cabinets to get napkins since none were provided. That night my friend threw up whatver he ate and we tossed our leftovers out. 
Ended up being 12.50 for 50 wings and honestly I'd never do it again.",fVviKZ7IHESYk5I7fUkAoA,3,0,1,B9GxpIPYHwvmgp7hdQZn7A

It's got a bar area with a circular bar and some high tops and booths. It's almost an area that is almost always completely empty. The main dining room reminds of a buffet dining room. It's musty, too bright, crappy tables, icky carpet, no decor, no ambiance, etc.

But never fear, it's not all bad. The kitchen area is enclosed by clear glass so you watch the cooking. And that's something I always enjoy.

The service is a tad hit or miss. Never bad. Just some servers are friendlier and more attentive than others.

The drink list is meh. And the wines by the glass are way overpriced.

But here's where it gets way way way good. Those coupons in the weeklies. BOGO prime rib is an amazing deal not to be missed. $17.99 for TWO plates of prime rib with sides. That is freakin' awesome. Who doesn't love prime rib? And it's pretty difficult to screw it up. It's a good size serving and includes veggies and a baked potato, mashed potatoes, or fries. The veggies could use some seasoning or something. The mashed potatoes are totally plain. (Hint: Get the baked potato.) But the prime rib is fantastic. Even their horseradish sauce is good. 

Don't have a coupon for BOGO prime rib? They also offer a special where you can get two prime rib dinners, a bottle of wine, and one dessert to share for $39.99. This is also a good deal. (Hint: If you've got a nice server, they'll let you combine the BOGO coupon with this deal.) Sure, the wine is a cheapie one, but it's still a bottle of wine with dinner. And the desserts aren't bad. You get to choose from key lime pie, cheesecake, etc. We opted for the martini sundae. French vanilla ice cream in a martini glass with chocolate, strawberry, and caramel syrups and cookies. It hit the spot.

All in all, this isn't the place if you're looking for some fancy, upscale food. But if you are craving some beef and desire a great deal on prime rib, this is the place. As long as they keep doing that coupon, we will keep coming back.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,2,1,3,z8MWOYfVCaUhrSFLTmZ6IA

The best part about (the reason why it even has 2 stars) is that the wings are still 25 cents. They should charge 15 cents for how small the wings shrunk!

Quick tip: Order the wings naked and ask for sauce on the side! They come out super soggy and oily beyond the BP accident out in the ocean!

Another things that destroyed what made this an awesome late night spot is the ranch swap! What gives with that?! I mean, what restaurant even carries individual ranch dressing buckets and on top of that, CHARGES you for it! Ridiculous! Whoever kidnapped Mr. Marino and placed Mr. Onion in his restaurant needs to be found and punished for this heinous abomination! I mean, COME ON! You're in a Hooters hotel for God's sake.

The short of it was that the food was good (not great), and the service was good. There's really not a whole lot to complain about. At the $10.99 price level, you are certainly getting value.

Disclaimer: I don't really know quality of prime ribs dinner.

All I can say was the prime rib dinner was pretty good. The portion size wasn't super large, but it was good size. I think it is a reasonable sized portion for someone who has an average appetite. I was able to finish the prime rib, the baked potato side, and most of the veggies. I don't like carrots or green beans so I usually don't eat those.

I would give Mad Onion 4 stars. The food was okay/good, but I didn't feel like it was amazing. The service is kind of standard.

2470348,2009-12-19,15,nuT8Bgfz7HTJQqbJFddkBw,"Wings or prime rib?  Those are probably the two most common choices at this 24 hour restaurant located at the casino level of the Hooters Casino Hotel. The prime rib special is $9.95 all day and you can order 25 cents hot wings with a minimum order of ten from midnight until 6 AM.  The restaurant used to be Dan Marino's and quotes and images of the former NFL Miami Dolphins star quarterback are still a big part of the restaurant's décor.  Apparently, the recent name change to Mad Onion Fine Foods and Spirits occurred just before Thanksgiving 2009.  

From a distance both specials looked decent, but I made a middle-of-the-night mistake by ordering their half pound Classic Mad Onion Burger.  The unique thing about the Mad Onion burger is having your choice of onions put on your burger.  I chose ""carmalized"" onions among the list which also included raw onions, sauteed onions, BBQ onions and chipotle onions.  The burger comes with fries also.

At least the fries were hot in temperature because the burger was not.  The food took an excruciating amount of time to come out of the kitchen and when it finally did not only was the burger just warm but the carmalized onions were ice cold.  The half pound sirloin burger did not taste like fresh beef either.  It was a bit too ground up in texture and had a peculiar taste.  I think I made the right decision by tossing most of my food and making a run up to a 24 hour Wendy's at a nearby food court instead.

2876605,2014-12-26,1,nuT8Bgfz7HTJQqbJFddkBw,"Holllllly shit. I don't know where to begin. I am so shocked at the quality of the food here that I feel as if I'm going to be sick just writing about it. I'm an individual that has an extremely high tolerance for imperfections in the food industry, especially considering that I worked for a well-respected restaurant for 9 years. However, the lack of care in the preparation of my food tonight at this restaurant has compelled me to write about it for my fellow Yelpers to save them the heartache AND potential stomachache... 

To begin, I was extremely excited to eat here since it's called the Mad Onion - and if there's one thing I love it's onions. Well, we received a voucher for a free prime rib dinner by signing up for the rewards program, so we decided to use it since we had already spent a good chunk of money in fine dining earlier in the day and the previous day as well. Of course, I wasn't expecting a Michelin star meal, but from a restaurant at a hotel in Vegas (however second-rate it may be) should still prepare quality food for its customers. And, yes, I realize that it was a free meal, but considering that this meal normally goes for $11 on their menu, I think an honest review is still warranted. I'm not sure if this is their regular quality or if the server told the kitchen that our meal was free, but what came out could be compared only to what comes out of a TV dinner. 

The steak looked to be about 12 oz, but the only part of it that was edible was roughly half of that - meaning 6 oz of unrendered fat. The ""baked"" potato was cooked 80% through, meaning that the last couple bites were raw potato, not a pleasant texture or taste in my opinion. Lastly, the vegetable side was a pile of corn that tasted as if it came straight out of the can as was merely heated up and tossed on the plate. I LOVE corn, but this was a marginal attempt at a food item that is truly impossible to screw up when it comes to cooking it. It seemed to be drenched in oil, which made it very difficult to eat.

Granted, as I mentioned before, this meal was free so I shouldn't be one to complain, but considering that it is a menu item that they charge an average price for, I would be verrrrry weary of ordering anything else off of their menu. Just spend the extra menu and go to a real restaurant because this was just not very appetizing, and as I said, this is coming from a person who is very generous when it comes to reviewing restaurants.

Had it not been for the billboard sign along I15 en route to Vegas, I would have never come across this nearly on the strip deal.  The billboard advertised a free steak dinner for out of state people.  Me - Californian - out of state - Yes!

To redeem this great offer, I had to become an Owl Rewards Club member.  The process took no more than 2 minutes.  I was issued a voucher for the free meal (with purchase of $2.50 drink) that could be redeemed between 11am and 11pm.  It was a June 2012 promotion so the certificate expired at the end of the month.  Check their website for other monthly promotions - they seem to have these all the time.

Once seated at the Mad Onion (well, I had to go back the next day, because I couldn't get a table within reasonable time the night I wanted to redeem the voucher), there was no problem redeeming the voucher.  The waiter knew exactly what I was there for.  

The free meal included a 10oz steak with baked potato and bottomless texas toast.  For $1.50 you could add either:
- side salad
- baked potato toppings
- vegetables
- dessert

I chose to add a side salad and the baked potato toppings.  So, in the end I ended up paying $6.00 for a very complete dinner.  Not bad.

But, if you don't want to be an Owl Rewards member, this same meal could be had for $6.00 - not bad at all!",Gpztz4quXP_Eybx9gkLTSQ,2,0,4,BCQUGQCXnQIWEwgcJaEHrQ

And the wait staff was super nice and accommodating, even when my bill was under $5 -- which it was every single time I ate here.

Perhaps I'm a bit biased because I had 3 FREE dine in only breakfast vouchers for their all american breakfast which my sister and I were surprisingly pleased with. It came with toast, eggs, potatoes and choice of bacon or sausage. We also they got 25 cents wings between midnight and 4 am on another visit which were also tasty with bbq.  Arriving at 4 am is not ideal because of obnoxious folk but overall this place is surprisingly pleasant during the day.   

Best part about the free breakfast is that is was available 24/7 -- so we never actually ate it during breakfast time but during brunch, lunch and dinner.  I would come back here again for the wings -- yeah it took a while after midnight and they charged an extra $1 for ranch dipping sauce and to order you have to have an Owl Rewards card and buy at least 10 wings but it was all worth it!   

One meal cost us $1.62 because the 2 breakfasts were free and the budlight ordered was $1.50 before tax.   If I have free coupon vouchers or want $1.50 budlight or want 25 cents wings, I will surely come back here!

I tried the beef brisket, jalapeno corn muffin, mashed potato, and bbq salad. The corn muffin was awesome. It comes with a slightly sweetened butter, and the muffin itself has chunks of real corn throughout. It was probably the best corn muffin I've ever had. 

The bbq salad was a little hit-or-miss. I ordered it on two occasions, and once the avocado was came sliced and once it came chopped (there was very little of it). Also, my salad was missing the crunchy onion toppings the second time. I didn't miss the onion crunchies because I don't particularly like them, but I expect to receive the same dish when I order it on two separate occasions. 

The mashed potatoes tasted garlicky once, and more plain the second time. The brisket bbq was really good: moist and full of bbq flavor. Everyone goes for the prime rib special ($9.95), but nobody mentions the other dishes that are also $9.95: the bbq brisket and brisket & chicken combo.

although the restaurant is in the hooters casino, it's not the wings you'd get at a hooters restaurant. there's too much breading! i swear the breading to chicken ratio is 2:1. sometimes they come out kinda warm or cold. i always get the hottest flavor. it really burns but it's a good burn!

whether you're drunk or sober, it's two different experiences. if you're drunk, you probably wouldn't mind if the wings are overbreaded and warm. i know i didn't. but once i went when i was sober, and i couldn't believe i loved the wings there previously.

- If you want ALL drums, it's $1.00 more per order of 10.  I think I'm going to spend the extra 10 cents per and do this route next time.

- Our server offered us choices of Mild, Med, Hot or BBQ.  I did 10 hot and 10 BBQ.  The hot was more like medium and the BBQ was more like ""I'll take some chicken with my BBQ sauce"".  If you love your sauce, then get these.  It was too much for me though.

It has long been a point of sadness for me that the whole food-service world has transition to an on-the-side mentality. When I order a salad with dressing, I want the dressing tossed in with the greens, not in a little plastic cup.  Well this restaurant takes ""on-the-side"" to a whole new level.   Everything that can come on the side does, including the butter and fixins for baked potatoes.  I requested butter, bacon and cheddar cheese.  All three came on the side. So I dumped them all on the potato and asked them to heat the potato up until the cheese melted, which they did do but their initial response was ""we don't do that"".

This restaurant has the ""feel"" of a romantic dinner destination but because of their ""cafeteria-service"" mentality, it will never be more than mediocre.  

As for the food itself, my steak was tender and tasty and cooked properly. The baked potato was a little under-cooked but acceptable after I had the re-heat it with toppings. The fish n chips was also good enough to not be disappointed but was certainly not something you would rave about and look forward to on your next trip to Vegas.

 Like the hotel this restaurant sits in, this Mad Onion is not bad, but is certainly not very good.  We are unlikely to eat here again.",W8zauC9YPUURGeBU3dyxSA,0,1,2,rYu9OFBMnTZlmkKoyM4Y8g

Im not going to say the food was terrible but why would it take about hour to get 20wings and a garden salad?

First of all as I went to get a card in order to receive the wing for .25cent the greeter forgot to put my name on the waiting list so after the 30 min wait and by the time I noticed a 3rd who arrived after us, party of 2, be seated I asked where was I on the list. As they added my name they said I would be next.

As we were seated they took there time before a waiter came to our table and for the most part he was friendly. They brought us our drinks in a timely fashion but by the time I finished my beer I realized that some time had passed. I had to flag down the bus boy so our waiter could be found. When he came over I informed him that when we arrived the party behind was just leaving and now there was a new party of 6 that have been sat and served before we got our food. He tried to pull his ticket to see when were we sat and I had to stop him and tell him, in a calm but firm manner, I don't care what your ticket say I know we were sat and we order prior to the people at the other table ever taking a seat. Within 2minutes our food came out.

So then the food arrives. Why with a small garden salad I am given about 6oz of dressing but with the wings I am informed after the fact that I need to purchase my single serving, 2oz, prepackaged ranch for a dollar? I didn't mind paying the dollar but when have you ever ordered wings and had to purchase the dressing on the side?

I don't care how drunk I am I will never go there again. And not the waiter didn't get a tip.",q2QzEb-ZVs_O_bNIKY8eYw,0,0,1,6e5XTA4l3TTVueulBKQhWQ

But my man was really, really excited about both AND this place is open 24 hours.  When you are coming in from an outing of gambling and drinking, you are going to want to eat.

We were staying at this hotel, so this was convenient.  I think we got in about 1:30 a.m. and there was a hell of wait.  But it turns out that the hostess was slammed with taking room service calls, ringing up bills, AND the occasional bussing of tables, so she was busting some serious ass in order to keep up.  I do not blame her for the wait at all.  When she did get to the parties that were waiting, we got seated right away.

The waitress took some time to get to us.  Granted, she was busy too.  I ordered a Newcastle to drink and she had to go out to the casino bar to get it, if that says anything.  He ordered the plain wings (from midnight to 6:00 a.m., wings are $0.25 each, but you must order a minimum of 10) and the $9.99 prime rib.  I ordered the club sandwich.

My sandwich was tasty and done well.  The bacon was cooked through, the fries were seasoned a little.  I have no complaints, except that you could tell that the turkey was from the packet of cheapest cold cuts you can buy.

But the prime rib and the wings was not a hit with my man.  He hated them both.  He said the wings were greasy and tasteless and the meat was horrible.  Fatty, bad tasting...and this was all after a night of drinking when the taste buds are destroyed.  I noticed that the meat was turning grey too.  Blech.

It took forever to get the bill when we were done with dinner.  

All in all, play it safe here and get some traditional greasy spoon fare.  You should be fine.  Don't fall for the specials.

The place gets pretty busy after midnight because of the deal, so you could be waiting anywhere from ten minutes to an hour for a seat.  For my experience, I really just wanted to tackle these wings that I've heard so much about.

When you order the wings, you need to buy them in sets of ten (so $2.50 per batch), and you select a style of flavoring.  The mild flavored were pretty disgusting because they were so buttery, and really upsets your stomach if you are wasted beyond belief.  My friends and I ordered the BBQ and Spicy wings.  Be warned that these wings are different from other Hooters restaurants.  The wings themselves weren't that great, and really greasy.  And if you add too much hot sauce on these wings, they will really mess you up if you are drunk.

We tried to enter the restaurant, but the waitstaff told us we could not enter - had to go down to the hostess stand at the other restaurant.  So we walked down there, waited around for 10 minutes and then we were lead through that restaurant and back to a table about 10 feet from the hooters entrance we were not allowed to go into.

We sat for a while - guess they were surprised the hostess sat us in that section.  I flagged someone down.

To start - the fries were cold and soggy  - so they stayed on the plate;  the rest was so bad, we never go back to them. 

My wife ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger.  When it came, the guy put it down and poof - was gone - before we had a chance to even look to see if it was ok - did anyone ask us if it was ok ?  nope,  did the waitress come back  to check- nope. Burger was raw, did not have mushrooms on it - It was not right.  After about 10 minutes of looking around for staff, I actually got up with her plate walked across to the pass (no one stopped me to ask why I was walking around with her meal)  and handed them to the person at the pass and told her is was just wrong.  She got mad at me for being there, not that fact, could not get any help or it was so bad.  So they supposedly brought her a new one - it was same burger, recooked, still no mushrooms: the manager came over and told us ""sorry, they were out"".  Think someone should have said something a little earlier.  My wife gave up and ate the re fired patty less the the cold dry bun.  I grabbed some mustard off another table for her so it was not so dry :).

I ordered the ""buffalo chicken sandwich"" - poor excuse - they forgot the sauce and the blue cheese. so it was a fried dry chicken patty on another cold bun. 

We gave up eating;  waved across room at wait staff (think they did seat us in a closed section which was part of issue).  When they brought the bill (yes they tried to charge me for the disaster meal).  Told the person, was not paying for one of the worse meals ever had.  Ten later the same manager came over and did comp the meal - but if I would have refused, sure we would have had to pay.

5294892,2010-01-12,0,nuT8Bgfz7HTJQqbJFddkBw,"25 cent Hooters wings from 12 midnight until 6 am.  I give it 3 stars for that.  

FYI, this is the former ""Dan Marino's"" but it's still the same restaurant with the same food.  

I've only been here after midnight so I can't judge what it's like at other times.  Of the times I've been here, there's always a wait, generally, about 5 min to 45 min, depending on the time of the night (post-clubbing hours, etc...).  Once you do get in, you have to try very hard to get your waiter's attention, just because they're so understaffed and busy servicing the masses who are there just for the 25 cent wings.  Once we did get ahold of our waitress, she was excellent. She came by 2 or 3 times to fill our water, gave us stacks of napkins, came by again to ask if we wanted to order anything else, and then came by to give us our check. 

Warning: wings are 25 cents (12 am to 6 am), but dressing is $1 each and they come in a container roughly the size of the sauce for chicken nuggets at Mcdonald's.  Also, unlike a regular Hooters, the Mad Onion/Dan Marino's doesn't have much variety in seasoning its wings.  Actually, back when it was Dan Marino's, you could still choose cajun wings.  Now, your options are limited to mild, medium, spicy, 911, or bbq wings.  

Between me and my friend, our meal cost $222.  $22 for our 30 wings, green salad, and bleu cheese and ranch dressing, and then $200 for blackjack during our 25 minute wait.",hUsqkZTLutJNrShq6mKx5g,1,0,3,YKopXC9OFcWreHvfvgTF6Q

I asked for a rare steak and it was cooked exactly how I wanted it, a huge plus! My friend ordered the Burger & Fries which was also very large portions. We all shared the Wings & Fries as an appetizer, which was also very good.

Anyways, we came back later that night after clubbing and got the $3 breakfast. It wasn't amazing once again, but its $3, and when your tired and all danced out, it tastes pretty good.

Ate here multiple times since we were staying at Hooters. 

My favorite thing there?

The Custard French Toast. I couldn't get enough of it. Its a really great French toast. Its a little more richly flavored that a normal french toast. I recommend it highly. 

The Chicken Parmesan Sandwich was also really good. Very flavorful and the chicken was cooked right. It wasn't dry or chewy. Awesome dish. 

And if you re getting breakfast, get the home style potatoes. My girlfriend and I had an order everyday we were there. It may seem weird to be praising home style  breakfast potatoes, but they were good. 

Had a burger here, It was a burger. I really wasn't feeling all that hungry at the time and knew I needed to eat. 

Service was good every time we ate, and the prices weren't bad. Didn't get around to trying their famous $9.99 Prime rib, I might the next time we go back to Vegas.

They had the same 25c per wing deal late at night but there were too many unwritten rules we had to deal with to get the deal. First is you must order minimum of 10 wings per person. Second is every person eating wings must order a dink. Third is you can only get the 25c per wing if you are dining in. Fourth is you must pay $1.50 per box if you have any left overs that you want to take home. This might be ok if you already planned on getting a drink and ordering 10 wings to eat by yourself. However, it makes it much more difficult for larger groups who want to share because they will charge you drinks per person and require at least 10 wings per person regardless how much the person actually wants to eat. They would not budge on these rule regardless of how much business you give them.... It was ridiculous! I haven't even tried the food yet but all of my friends and I already want to just leave...

Pork Chops weren't cooked all the way.  The HUGE portion of mashed potatoes for the side wasn't bad, but they didn't give us any gravy for them.  The cajun prime rib was way over seasoned and salty.
