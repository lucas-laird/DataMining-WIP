What really stood out were the monkfish liver (which I never thought I'd like), the scallop sashimi, the aburi salmon sashimi, and the chutoro nigiri. Even dessert was great, with homemade creme brûlée, peanut mochi and cookie. 

Service was really good, everyone was super friendly and helpful, and both chef hiroyoshi and Aaron served delicious food.

244860,2017-10-04,0,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"I can't begin to describe how fantastic this restaurant was, but I'll give it a try anyways. I dined here for lunch on a Thursday in September, a few hours before my flight home. The restaurant was somewhat slow for that day, but I didn't mind as I was looking for a relaxed lunch.

The waitress kindly explained the menu to me, indicating how their focus is primarily on omakase ($100/pp). Being somewhat short on time I just ordered items a la carte. I started off with the toro tartar, a nice portion of fatty tuna with house-made soy, a quail egg and crispy wontons on the side. I really loved this dish, and the price of $8.

This restaurant of course specializes in authentic edo mae style sushi, which the chef has worked with certain fish purveyors to ensure he's consistently getting premium product. The fresh variety of fish is clearly evidenced in  the ""toku-jo"". This sushi dish includes 12 of the best sushi offerings that day, all nigiri style and served with tamago two ways. The waitress carefully took the time to explain each piece of fish to me, even jotting down the names of some of the unfamiliar fish so that I would remember them. I've never had sushi this fresh, so incredibly delicate where the subtleties of each fish shines. It was absolutely fantastic.

The sushi was so good that I still just wanted more so I proceeded to also order the toro taku roll, a perfect taste and textural combination of fatty tuna, scallion and pickled daikon radish. The waitress also recommended I would like their version of black cod, prepared with house-made miso and slowly grilled over embers. The result is just the most buttery texture and delicious rendering of black cod I've ever had. My meal finally concluded with the house green tea, the perfect palette cleanser after a phenomenal dining experience (the tea was excellent too btw). 

Some other quick notes, the waitress who helped me that day could not have been more pleasant. We discussed everything from world travel to where the chef sources his fish. She made sure I was taken care of throughout the meal. Further, the prices here are an absolute bargain as far as I'm concerned given the quality of the fish and just overall authenticity. I will most certainly be back for the omakase the next time I'm in Vegas!",lL4sVOfmnrrwUDYW9lAilw,1,0,5,BuXsCCGkyBAfshoe8aCIQQ

Highly recommend the Toku-jo sushi of 15 pieces (chef's choice omakase) and the ""truth serum"" sake.  You can't lie after having it, so this review must be honest...At least that's what Austin told me.

The sushi is AMAZING and very reasonable for what you get!!!! My wife and I love sushi and we always get the Toku-jo sushi (15 piece). This has to be one of the best sushi places we have been to (outside of Japan). 

The Toku-jo sushi comes with 15 pieces of sushi (chef's choice). I'm not a huge fan of uni but the uni here is REALLY good, ESPECIALLY the hokkaido uni. Last time we went, chef gave us spotted shrimp- it was the first time I've ever had spotted shrimp- and I must say I enjoyed that a lot more than sweet shrimp (and I actually really like sweet shrimp).

851184,2016-05-25,2,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"I consider myself a sushi afficionado.  While Las Vegas has many sushi options. Hiroyoshi has to be on top of the list in terms of food quality/freshness and service. .  Location is off strip in a strip mall, okay neighborhood, plenty of parking.  This restaurant is under a year old and a first venture by Hiro and his wife, both very gracious and humble hosts.   Hiro had been a sushi chef at Blue Ribbon sushi in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. 

Found Sushi Hiroyoshi on Yelp last weekend and decided to give it a try. Restaurant decor is classic and very simple.  The food is the showcase. Super fresh fish, artfully prepared. This is not AYCE or your rock and roll sushi bar but quiet elegance where one can enjoy a meal with friend(s) and have good conversation.  Prices are higher than an AYCE or other similar quality sushi bar but not as high as on strip restaurants.  Fish portions are a bit smaller than some places but quality and variety more than makes up for it.

Arrived with my husband last weekend around 8pm. They close near 9 or 9:30pm so things appeared to be winding down early or they are still building their business.  Folks around us seem to really enjoy their meal too.   I ordered the Omikase (Chef's special) for $85.00 and my husband ordered ala carte various dishes.  Omikase was a bargain for the amount and variety of multi courses with plenty to satisfy.  Ala carte items are priced within market (except All You Can Eat places where freshness isn't always there.) 

Beautiful fish flown in from Japan that wasn't standard sushi bar fare with melt in your mouth goodness.   Husband had 2 orders of sashimi among other dishes - super fresh and beautiful assortment. 

You can tell Hiro and his wife work very hard - super delightful couple. It's hard to find wonderfully fresh sushi in the desert. Sushi has gone up a notch in Las Vegas.   I hope Hiro and wife's business makes it!  I plan to visit again soon.

The 4 stars vs 5 is only because decor isn't as elegant as a strip restaurant. But it's lean and serviceable for the team to meet and convene.",fL1pyN5aDrbINRe-DTrduA,4,1,4,HDWns_3NFXIgJuRn48SFFg

The service was friendly and attentive, but the food was overated from appretizer to main course. We tried alittle bit of everything, so I am writing an hornest review. They offer something you don't usually find in a regular japanese restaurant in Vegas. 
- The abalone was excellent, I would recommand this. 

Cons,  
- The sesame tofu is not tofu and did not taste good. 
- Hokaido Uni was below average, the color of the Uni was dark yellow and the taste was dull, the freash one are suppose to be in brighter color and the fresh tasting.  (If you want a good piece of Hokkaido Uni, I suggest Morimoto at MGM.

Very small but extremely clean, and streamlined in its decorating. 
This is not an AYCE place, so you can spend a lot if you want to try a lot. My hub is a sashimi nagiri guy so it adds up quickly. He said it was very fresh.

 The hostess was very attentive , but we figured because we were the only ones there.  Nope. They were equally attentive and genuine to everyone that came in after us.         
  
 Chef was very nice, even chatted, and joked with us while creating our items. We ordered the Flash roll, which quickly became my favorite.
 Husband was treated to chef's favorite (blue fin tuna). It was amazing! When we were done and requested the check, they brought out a complimentary slice of mango cheesecake (definitely a must get if you go!) and sang happy birthday. 
Amazing place, Amazing service and Amazing sushi! So that gives ut a AAA rating from us! Will definitely be back!",pNMK2gAxOPVWYLHLpSRaJQ,2,1,5,piPTeHbO5_NkgsWfLyA3gg
1375836,2017-06-20,11,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"This is probably one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town. A bookmark that I had wanted to go to for a long time. The time is now (or then).

I've always loved omakase's. You're basically telling the chef, ""You do what you want, and I'll take it"". Take it, I shall. After my first omakase experience at Kabuto, I was dying to try some others. Hearing from fellow reviewers, I was intrigued about this spot. When the opportunity came, I embraced it. 

This place is located in an interesting position in Vegas. It's kinda like between Summerlin and Chinatown. The interior is splendid. It's cool, yet modern.

Onto the food. First, I gotta say. They use the top shelf ingredients you can buy. From the fish, to the rice, to the everything else, it was superb. Not only do they have top quality ingredients, but they have top quality chefs working on them. Expertly cooked foods, and precise techniques of cutting... it was spectacular. What I liked was watching the chefs in action, because unlike most other sushi restaurants in town, Chef Hiroyoshi is doing a lot of interesting and unique stuff when it comes to preparing and serving dishes, it's not just rolls and nigiri, the chefs are doing lots of cool,different stuff.

Our server was fantastic and I couldn't ask for anything better. If you are looking to try an omakase in Vegas, or if you want to try a sushi place that takes things to a different level, I would highly recommend Sushi Hiroyoshi. It's a great place that is making tasty, interesting, and more modern types of sushi that you will enjoy.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,20,19,5,mWyWWr0nKGwzekcoM-wTcw

1503489,2015-11-04,10,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"Get yourself to Sushi Hiroyoshi post-haste! This space has undergone a complete transformation since it's days as Sushi Yamaguchi- the formerly messy, cave-like space is now clean, open, and modern. Quality and service are stellar, and I place them on par with a lower-priced Kabuto. 

APPETIZER TRIO: Chef's choice of three different featured apps for the day. Ours were a tofu-uni dish, a seared tuna, and a cucumber-jellyfish salad, all of which were delicious. This first dish really set the tone for the beautiful presentation and careful balance of flavors we would experience throughout our meal.
RED MISO: A comforting alternative to the usual (white) miso soup, with tofu and mushrooms.
SCOTTISH SALMON TARTARE: Fresh fish, avocado, salmon roe, and spicy miso sauce, again with nice presentation. It may be helpful to ask for a spoon for this dish.
NIGIRI: Super fresh. Go with any recommendations you receive. Had great masu, Hamachi, akami, ika, and (an especially amazing) hotate on our first visit. Everything was of great quality, and large thick pieces with lightly-vinegared perfectly-formed rice. 
TORO TAKU: Maki-style roll with fatty tuna, scallions, pickled daikon, and bonito flakes. Possibly our favorite item tried on our first visit. Simple but wonderful.
UNA KYU: Maki-style roll with golden eel and cucumber. Savory and enjoyable.
FLASH ROLL: One of the few somewhat-Americanized rolls on the menu, in five large pieces with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado, and masago in soy paper. BF really enjoyed this.

I can't fully express what a gem this place is. Space is small, seating a maximum of 30. Service is attentive and personable, even if seats at the bar aren't available. Fish freshness and quality was much higher than location led me to expect, with generous cuts and proper rice ratio. Dishes and quality were comparable to what we received on a recent trip to Kabuto, at half the price (though none of the grilled dishes). I live dangerously close to this spot and it will be hard to try new places with this spot right outside my backdoor.

1910488,2016-03-30,0,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"Highly recommended.

It's great to discover places for locals. It's also wonderful to see how sushi has progressed in the desert, a sign of cultural change as well as the efficiency of modern distribution networks. This is a high end Japanese restaurant in a strip mall. The ingredients are fresh; the preparation is expert with just enough creativity (perhaps due to the chef hailing from Sapporo rather than Tokyo); and the service could not be more attentive and polite without being embarrassingly deferential.

I had chirashi, presented in two lacquer boxes. The tamago, which is how a traditionalist judges, was perfect. I also ordered an item off the menu (meaning not on the menu; ""off the menu"" is a bad phrase, since it communicate two meanings, opposite one another), ikura oroshi, which the chef happily made. He uphold me on fresh oysters, but they were good and not too expensive. The dessert was elaborate, a green tea creme brûlée.

For sushi experts (which I do not claim to be), my assessment is the class of raw fish and its freshness are, as might be expected, not quite Los Angeles or Los Angeles levels, but on par with any other major American city (say, Chicago). The preparation was faultless. The flavors probably were toned down a bit.

To reiterate: highly recommended. I plan to stop in Sushi Hiroyoshi whenever I am in Las Vegas.",CgY1aawHOqe49qW8sfNAAg,0,0,5,njcRtHipExl0iMNArVjSWw

There is a lot of refinement for the price in Sushi Hiroyoshi's Omakase offerings! This is a very strong 4.5 stars.

We first came in over a year ago and ordered several al-a-carte items. We were impressed and wanted to come back, but it was our most recent visit, when my love and I decided to do Omakase, where the true beauty of Sushi Hiroyoshi really shined through--dishes were grounded in their ingredients, but Chef Hiro artfully expanded from there with touches of finesse that were rightfully celebrated with our eyes and mouths. 

Hiroyoshi offers two omakase options: $85 & $100. The omakase is most similar to spots like Nobu and Tokyo Boys. It is Nigiri-heavy, but includes other savory items, like Teriyaki Foie Gras, Grilled Shrimp with egg yolk and uni butter, and Uni Tempura. Sushi Hiroyoshi is vastly better than Nobu, and while we were not quite presented with as large of a volume of high-quality items at Hiroyoshi as we were at Tokyo Boys, there was a little more attention to detail and technique evident when we came to Hiroyoshi...case in point, the Teriyaki Foie Gras was one of the better versions of Foie Gras I've had in Vegas. Additionally, the Nigiri Course was dominated by premium selections that included: Shima Aji, Golden Eye Snapper, Chutoro, Otoro, Abalone, and even included a couple of sushi selections that you won't find at most omakase's...It was my first time trying Hakkaku/Sailfin Poacher.

In fact, while you drive there and pass Sushi Roku you can feel comfortable to make obscene gestures as you pass.  Sushi Hirotoshi is a quaint little spot in a strip mall.  However, the service you receive is amazing.  The chef sent over a complimentary appetizer.  The sushi was fresh and amazing.  I asked him to surprise me with a roll and created something out of this world with tuna tar tar.  The staff then provided us complimentary dessert tasting platter.

The head chef/owner shows a high level of care in every plate he presents.  My wife and I usually choose to have their sashimi plate which differs in quantity and selection depending on the price (in $20 increments).  They also have two different sushi plates which has 12 to 15 different pieces of nigiri to sample and enjoy.  They also have an omakase offering for $100 which is absolutely wonderful in terms of freshness and quality.  Finally, they also offer a variety of izakaya-style plates which we like to choose from to supplement our sashimi/sushi selections.  They also have a decent offering of different sakes and they have Sapporo on draft - the best!

The owners (head chef and his wife) are super nice and welcoming.  Their wait staff are great as well - friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.

The main chef is from northern Japan where is notoriously famous for good seafood. So all the seafood they had were fresh and perfect in the terms of fattiness that fish contains in its body. The sushi pieces price ranges from $4-10ish which were very reasonable for the quality of them. Not only the sushi itself but detail of presentation as well as ease of eating were very well executed. 

Bottles of sake are also reasonable. It's just perfect to enjoy with fresh fish or delicate Japanese dishes.

The service was just excellent. They made sure that we were enjoying the dinner and the experience. 

This became one of my favorite sushi bar. I wish I lived near there but, for sure, I will go back when I visit Las Vegas.

I couldn't find anything that caught my attention (I've been to several fine Japanese/sushi restaurants on the strips, including Nobu and Yellowtail), until I browsed off-strip and came across Sushi Hiroyoshi.

Their presentations are art on a plate and I really appreciate their raw fish (sashimi/nigiri) selections. Sure beats the heck out of the typical salmon, tuna, and yellow tail that being widely praised at the other high-end restaurants. I want authentic sushi dang it and when I saw ""grunt fish"" and ""orange clams"" on their menu I also fainted from excitement! Hells yeah! I live for exotic foods!

Although their foods are exquisite and exceptional in quality, taste, and presentation, their pricing is actually fairly decent! If I were to have the same dishes at a different restaurant elsewhere, I know I'd be charged a much higher price than here. But shhh... don't tell them this otherwise they might raise their price.

It was unanimous at our table of 7 that EVERYONE loved the food! Even the non-sushi eaters were praising about their dishes. One of them requested that I tag him in the food pictures on IG, which was... interesting... LOL! I guess he really liked the food!

A big shout out to Winnie, our waitress! I have told her then and I will say it again... we should be best friends!!! Winnie is hands down the most awesome waitstaff I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. She's incredibly witty and hilarious! She didn't skip a beat when jokes and comments were thrown her way, even when it's not directed at her she'd have something clever to add, making our night that much more fun and entertaining! Her retorts were some of the best I've heard. Her interactions with us made my friends and I feel very comfortable and at ease. Lucky for her I don't live in LV, otherwise I'd probably stalk her every day until she caves and becomes my best friend :)",fy4vOa5DPVKhwyyqW6BiPw,1,1,5,DG78BdNBwwdMeWil0x537A

Las Vegas does not have great sushi, ok maybe, but not great; not even on the strip. This establishment was just Meh.  Owner, wife, and staff very friendly, they get 5 stars.

I had practically everything on the menu, Nigiri only.  they baste every nigiri with some kind of sauce, and that's ok, but everyone?  I had to tell the chef to not do that anymore, and use lemon and salt or with shiso leaf, etc etc. these sauces like ponzu, and others mask the taste of the fish.  That's when you know the fish may be substandard.

This is some of the fish I had cant remember them all

yellowtail belly-good
chu toro- ok
o-toro - ok
salmon- good
snapper- ok
golden eye snapper- ok
yellowtail- meh
spicy tuna roll(very spicy) ok
scallop- ok
amberjack- ok

So, Iike I said nothing stood out except the yellowtail belly,  plus the cuts were very small, tasted more of the rice than anything else.  Considering that we went on a thursday and our group of (6) were the only ones there,  they should have catered to us a little better as far as the portion size.

I probably wont be back.

This was by far the best dining experience I ever had in a Japanese restaurant. Forget the glamorous tourist-trap places from the strip and come to this restaurant right now!

Food: 5/5. Fresh, authentic, delicate, delicious. If you sit on the sushi bar, you'll get the chance to see the care and technique that is put in preparing the food. The chefs are really masters of their craft.

Service: 5/5. Best service I every had. When you get inside the restaurant you are greeted like a friend and have the chance to talk and learn from the chefs and staff. Most importantly, everything feels genuine. At one point, we were curious about a dish somebody else next to us was having and the chefs gave us a sample for free! Also, the chefs kept working almost exclusively for us until after 11pm. Most places I know would say something like ""order in the next x minutes because the kitchen is closing"". Not here.

Price: 5/5. I've never eaten so much high quality sushi in one night. The bill for a couple was around $200 for 40~50 pieces, + sake, + dessert. What a deal!! I wonder how much I would have paid in Nobu for the same orders...

As a note, I'd like to mention that I was saddened to see the place empty on a Friday night. This place deserves to have more people in. I understand the location doesn't help, specially for tourists that don't want to get off the strip. However, if you have a car and love Japanese food, please come to this place.

Went there for dinner last week and have to say that being a true sushi lover I had high expectations based off of reviews and word of mouth.

I have to say that I was not disappointed in the least. 

The decor is very minimalistic but that's because the sushi is the star of this place.

We began with the toro tartar. A little more than a mouthful but each bite melted like butter. Perfect presentation on the part of the chef. It's definitely a must have... Although they did forget the quail egg on the 2 orders we had. 

They do feature an omakase selection but we chose to order from the menu. The plates that were set up for the omakase were elegantly and artistically put together. 

We had several orders of sushi. The Amber jack was especially fresh. They had a great variety of the basic fish. Never had to order anything twice because there was so much to choose from.

We did have the tiger roll and soft shell crab roll as well... Good rolls but not as magnificent as the sushi.

This is quickly becoming one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas. I highly recommend coming to this restaurant whenever you're in the area.

I had nigiri set. Which consist of six omakase nigiri and a maki, miso soup. 
The sushi was, just, so good! Fresh, carefully crafted, and they were in perfect bite size. Presentation was on pointe.
The egg sponge thing, that was on the side of those bite size maki, that was very different. It was so fluffy, so it's not an omelet. It's like a sponge cake, yet not too airy, and the density makes those little pieces of treat so satisfying. Very unique and so pleasant!

- Grilled Shrimp w/ egg yolk & Uni butter, Marinated Tuna w/ Wasabi and Uni Tempura w/ Mushroom & Green tea salt
- Sashimi Course

- Golden eye Snapper 
- Chutoro
- Otoro
- Abalone 
- Santa Barbara & Hokkaido Uni

Desesert Course:

The short version: Hiroyoshi is good, but Kabuto is still my favorite; they are completely different.  Hiroyoshi is basically like a much better version of a regular sushi place (better fish, better staff) while Kabuto is an experience.

The longer version: When you walk in, the atmosphere is already miles apart; Hiroyoshi has Green Day playing on the speakers, which you would never hear at Kabuto.  Hiroyoshi doesn't require reservations either (yet, anyways), which is nice if you want good sushi but don't want to have to make reservations.  The staff are all very polite and professional.  

I think Hiroyoshi had about 3 different cuts of bluefin tuna whereas Kabuto has about 5 or 6 (including my favorite, wakaremi).  All the nigiri sushi at Hiroyoshi comes with two pieces per order compared to Kabuto's one piece per order.  Everything thing I ordered was of very good quality, but I prefer the rice at Kabuto.

Toro tartar was good too.

Got the three different side dish set. Nice texture on the jellyfish. Nice flavor. 

Something different I forgot to mention too! That uni tempura!!! Loved it. It's different. And the uni was fresh n sweet. Had that mini crunch cuz of the tempura and the matcha salt was a nice touch!

3501508,2017-03-30,0,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"Nothing like the typical AYCE sushi. Eating here wiped my sushi memory slate, CLEAN.

Now before I start, they use Hokkaido uni.
Their green tea is from the matcha powder, not the canned green tea.
They use fresh wasabi, scrubbed off of shark skin, which is on the plating. 
Plating! They do put a lot of effort into their plating, which is great if you're a picture taker.
They had Ikezo Peach (jelly sake). You're literally drinking jelly.

Great service! Dish explanation was a given, but what caught me was that they provide clean wash towels in between the courses, for your hands. (Omakase)

I tried the Omakase and I conclude that it was worth the price. It did suck the life out of my wallet, to be totally honest with you.

You can brief through all these reviews as much as you'd like, but you really won't know till you try (highly recommended).",2-O8qKuyQ63M_qWujFQ0Lw,0,1,5,rWZWYJcN4XO--_3IFmZe2w

I'm surprised this place isn't busier, as really great sushi is being made here.

Great service and quality ingredients are what you'll experience here. We met up with fellow San Diego Yelper Debbie S. and her friend to have dinner before they flew out, and Debbie suggested Hiroyoshi, and I've had it bookmarked for awhile, so that was our plan. 

My suggestion to you? Order the Omakase, sit right up in front of Chef Hiro, and enjoy the show, as well as his creations as he assembles course after course. You can customize your omakase, but the $85, all-inclusive package is the way to go. It includes an assortment of appetizers, a few cooked items, an assorted sashimi platter, great nigiri assortment, and a dessert trio to finish. My pictures do not lie, but pictures also don't do justice... you gotta experience it live!

HOT TIP: If you don't see a certain item on the menu, don't be afraid to ask...I LOVE Uni and ankimo, so I inquired about it...Our waitress was surprised that I liked Monkfish Liver, and I was also happy to know that they had Hokkaido Uni from Japan, which both made an appearace in my omakase experience. Definitely a must when dining in Vegas!  ALOHA!!!

As long as you're not a picky eater and are willing to try something new, then Omakase is the way to go. The chef selects your entire meal selection which is so much fun. You never know what you're going to get and everything compliments each other to perfection. Plus it takes away the stress of having to choose what to eat. You just get to sit back and enjoy the amazing food.

The sashimi was super fresh and reminded me of eating in Japan. This place has the flavor I've been looking for in Vegas. I'm so happy and excited that I found this place (thanks to my Yelp friends and their reviews).

When I came in early evening on a Monday, it was empty and they greeted me the Japanese way. Almost all the staff speak Japanese! I sat at the bar and was taken care of by Mayuka. 

When I got the craving for better Japanese I had Yelped this place, tried unsuccessfully to see their menu on the website, then decided to go in anyway. 

The chef at the bar made conversation, I ordered edamame for ~$3 and which was the perfect portion for one though a tad too salty but still great, then chose the platter of one tuna sushi roll, and seven other nigiri sushi which were the chef's pick for $16. I don't eat too much at one sitting but I finished all my food and was thoroughly satisfied! My craving was settled. 

The rolls were expertly made with care and had the perfect ratio of rice. The fish was clearly fresh and was allowed to shine rather than being smothered in sauce or overwhelmed by sushi rice or seasoning. The salmon nigiri was my favorite. I am definitely getting that next time! Or, will try the sushi platter that costs $18. 

My waitress and chef hovered around me and made fun conversation as I was alone and it was great. Will definitely return for more as often as I can! 

Also, just had to acknowledge how great my experience was, I almost never give a place 5 stars and here it was well-earned!",j8bhSD379qzoVa15RSCBUw,1,0,5,5XKw10K6DjL-LQp3qy6r2A

We ordered the top tier omakase set (I think $88/pp) + edamame and miso soup. The appetizer portion of the omakase just did not fly with me. Some things were a little too fishy and others just did not compliment the dish. I was like huh? The sashimi came on this huge, beautiful platter with generous amounts of fish. Honestly, I can see why people like this place because the sashimi was some of the best I've ever had -- extremely fresh!! The sushi portion is what threw me off... while everything was decent, nothing was mind-blowing. I want to be mind-blown during an omakase experience, damnit! Fish was too traditional and nothing was exciting. 4-5 stars for quality, though.

Service was out of this world. They were very Japanese-y in their polite mannerisms. We were checked on frequently and was told thank you for everything. A+!!!

We made 9pm reservations but due to rental car complications, we didn't get there until nearly 9:30pm (half an hour before closing) to get their omakase. I know, I know.. we were one of THOSE people who come in right before closing. I felt so bad, but they were so friendly and welcomed us in! Chef Hiroyoshi and his wife were so personable and made the experience all the more worthwhile. For about $90pp, the meal consisted of 16 dishes, including sashimi and sushi:

1) Sesame tofu with shrimp and uni
2) Amuse bouche: shigoku oyster, monkfish liver, seared tuna, eel, and baby squid (my favorite of the 5)
3) Sashimi platter for two: blue fin tuna, seared salmon belly, needle fish, white fish, yellowtail belly, and clam. The seared salmon belly was amazing, melted like BUTTAH.
4) Scallops and mushrooms: although I love the different mushrooms and the scallops had a natural sweetness, the overall dish was just too salty for me.
5) Baby seabream
6) Golden snapper
7) Amber jack & striped jack: I liked the amber jack more
8) 4-day dry-aged fatty tuna & regular fatty tuna: the 4-day dry-aged was amazing, melt-in-your mouth feel and had a distinct but so delicious taste. You can taste the difference between the two. And this was definitely a first, never knew you could dry age fish.
9) O-toro: SO good.
10) Mackerel: not usually a fan of mackerel but this one has made me a believer.
11) Spotted prawn: sweet and had an interesting texture, almost soft and creamy
12) Gizzard shad fish: probably my least favorite of the night
13) Alaskan snow crab with ikura and sturgeon caviar, Santa Barbara Uni, Hokkaido uni: this dish was my favorite of the night. To be able to taste the difference between the two uni, sweet and creamy from the Santa Barbara, while the Hokkaido was a lot firmer, not as creamy but definitely sweeter. The snow crab was sweet against the saltiness of the fish roe.
14) Toro hand roll
15) Tamago: interesting and cakelike
16) Crème brulee, mochi, and Japanese donut with red bean: beautifully presented.

The experience was a delight and the presentation of all the dishes were so carefully thought out and beautifully arranged. My boyfriend had a great time conversing with Chef Hiroyoshi and his wife.

Different types of amberjack, salmon, yellowtail, 3 different types of toro, etc.... which was all fresh! I loved pretty much everything and the presentation was unbelievable.

4265695,2016-02-18,1,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"I will start off by saying, this is probably the best food I've ever had.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would, as I've rated other restaurants 5 stars that, compared to this, are C grade.  That said...

4.99 Stars - Ambiance.  Let's start with the basics, it's clean, has a maximum occupancy of 30, tasteful, and personal.  I took off .01 star because, even though the music volume was perfect, they were playing American Pop music instead of Japanese.  

5 Stars - Service.  We were greeted with genuine smiles when we entered and seated promptly.  The staff were all pleasant, helpful, and offered great suggestions, though honestly any suggestion here is great, this is seriously superb food.  After the appetizer (the chef's selection), we ended up just asking the staff to bring us whatever the chef feels like preparing, and they tried to narrow down our focus, asking polite questions, and so we excluded eel (which I don't like).  Basically though we asked them to feel free to be creative and really show off.  The staff were great, partially due I think to the small size of the restaurant, because they were always at hand whenever we wanted something, and unobtrusive when they were refilling or hot tea (which we never had to ask for, they timed it perfectly).  At the end of the meal, they were happy to chat with us about Japan and themselves, so it was quite nice.

5++++ Stars - Food.  I can't even begin to describe this food and give it justice.  Everything, literally EVERYTHING, was delectable.  I can't use delicious because that word simply doesn't do it justice.  Quite honestly this was the best sushi I've had, anywhere, including in Japan, South Korea, Seattle, L.A., Torrance, and San Francisco.  Nothing was overly flavored, but everything was pleasure for the taste buds.  Everything was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and (add every positive thing you can say about food here).  It was so good, that after the meal I called a friend in Australia to make a date to come here to eat, and after 25 minutes of raving about the food, my friend mentioned that it must be good because I'd talked about it for 25 minutes straight, long distance, when I'm not really a phone person.  See the pictures I've attached, it's ALL GOOD.

5 Stars - Drinks.  Not a huge selection, but they have some sort of Peach Jelly Sake, that I could easily see myself becoming an alcoholic for ~ it tasted like real peaches, not the artificial flavors you might get in peach schnapps or whatnot.  The green tea was excellent, mild and not too bitter, with a very light scent of the sea to it.  Honestly I don't know if 5 stars is fair here, but really, I was too busy devouring the food to stop and consider it more than that little bit I mentioned.

There is a reason I don't see any negative reviews for this place, and that's because there's nothing I can criticize about it.  The price was high, but worth every single penny spent, and then some.  Do yourself a favor, if you're considering this place, don't bother second guessing, just go, you're taste buds will thank you for it.",HFMNedGJjPTo162-YSwqwQ,3,4,5,6cJ_cXBRWB1hHgfCrTjxFg

I took in-laws here for dinner on our last night boozing, gambling, and streaking. We always end up gravitating towards Japanese, but I definitely didn't want to pay Strip prices. The reviews for this place was spot on. This a hidden gem of Las Vegas! It's super far off the strip, but well worth the trip to check this place out. 

Recap:
1. Parking - Easy. The restaurant is located in a small strip mall with ample parking. 

2. Décor/Atmosphere - Clean, zen. No cheesy decorations or bright, distracting colors. 

3. Food - effin' amazing. The thing is, when you first look at the menu, it'll seem like a typical, sushi joint. No thanks. Order off-menu. Request Chef Hiroyoshi to make you an omakese (chef choice). For $65 bucks, I actually felt like I was ripping him off. We had a 7-8 course tasting that ranged from homemade tofu & uni appetizer, toro sashami w/ caviar and fresh oyster , miso black cod, large assortment of sashimi/sushi, etc. We also ordered a side of shrimp tempura, which my toddler threw down. He also loved the toro sashimi and uni/tofu appitizer. The chef said next time we come by, he'll make him a special ""kids omakese"". 

4. Service - AWESOME. I can't say enough nice things about the staff. We were very well taken care of and they took the time out explain each cut of fish, chef's background, different types of sake, and flirted with my toddler. 

5. Bathroom - Standard restaurant bathroom. Clean. 

6. Price - very, very fair.

The owners, the Chef Hiroyoshi and his wife, were extremely hospitable, down to even giving us written travel advice for Japan. The atmosphere is classic yet modern, clean, and comfortable. And of course the food. We ordered a la carte which was a big mistake as we watched the people next to us have an amazing omakase feast. They have special Japanese fish that you don't see on most menus that you should definitely try. Best part, we seriously over ordered/over ate, with all top market fish, and beer/sake and the bill was only $150 for 2. You could easily spend half that though if you went with more typical fish.

This restaurant is definitely worth the cab ride from the strip (if you are visiting) to have world class sushi. Both the food and the hospitality were outstanding. We will definitely be back!",5wWHZpebkmx4kfNgHbW9nQ,2,0,5,fFrGVGjApy0uFOBAem3c5g

I thought I wouldn't taste any difference. Boy, was I wrong! The fish was probably the freshest I've ever tasted. We got the Toro Tartar as an appetizer. It came with some wonton chips and it was delicious! We got three rolls; the yellowtail, salmon, and the Flash roll. We also got the Toku-jo sushi (15 pieces) and that was totally worth all the money. THE UNI WAS AMAZING. I almost cried and we got down to the last bit of sushi.

It's a little bit on the pricier end, but it is 100% worth it. Probably my favorite sushi spot in Vegas and will definitely come back soon!",G-2VjGgpVbsG5QLRXu4CPw,1,2,5,dFAqxMZ5RP9kvbNTyRDUqw
4546858,2017-11-02,2,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"I came here from LA to try out this 5-star yelp reviewed sushi restaurant and I was extremely disappointed. My boss and I dined here and he was treating me out for my 26th birthday so we ordered the omakase plus extra sushi. 

I came in here around 9pm and first thing I noticed was that there were not that many fishes available for some reason and I believe this contributed to how small our sushi pieces were. I felt like the chef gave us only what he had remaining and had very few premium fish left. The quality is decent, (nothing that amazing) and the portions were extremely small. I believe the waitress was the chef's wife and she was extremely nice to us even telling the chef to give some service since it was my b-day and we came out from LA just to try this place.. Chef told her okay, but it never ended up happening. Just for my boss and I we spent close to $400 including drinks for very mediocre sushi and will definitely not return. Don't even know what to recommend because nothing really stood out.

Overall subpar sushi, decent service, low quantity, and very expensive. Not sure if it's because I just came at a bad time when the chef had no good premium fishes left, but my experience here was nothing but horrible. Not sure how this could be rated 5-stars, but I will not return to give it another shot.

Very charming and authentic Japanese restaurant. Highly recommend their omakase. We decided to skip the popular Nobu to give this place a try. There was a bit of a hiccup when we arrived, because the hostess thought that we requested a table, when we really wanted bar seating. Totally makes a difference in your omakase experience. Luckily, they were very understanding and we only waited ~10 minutes for seats to open up at the bar. 

They offer a $85 and $100/pp omakase. We were feeling bougie and went for the $100 option. We requested to go straight for the nigiri and sashimi, skipping the appetizers. Everything tasted so fresh -- from the fish to the grated wasabi with shark skin. Standouts were the chutoro, otoro and striped jack. The chefs did an excellent job crafting each of our sushi pieces and explaining where each fish came from. Before we got into dessert, the chef graciously allowed us to have a second serving of anything we tried. 

I loved how ended our meal with tomago made two ways -- traditional version and a sweet, cake-like version. My favorite was the latter.",9unlBkftcCxEuOzPliukQw,3,2,4,em-ZIN8pfkBvsnApxp3NtQ

4947964,2016-01-06,2,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"Came here after hearing about it from a friend. So my friend and I decided to meet up for lunch.

Being from Henderson this drive is a little bit far. But it was well worth the drive. Nothing better than finding a hidden gem in your city that serves great food. In this case, great sushi with the freshest cuts available.

Walking in to an empty restaurant is always questionable but once we started ordering, I am glad it was empty as we received our orders quickly. Everything was handmade by Chef Hiroyoshi. We were offered an omakase menu by declined it since we were pressed for time. 

However, I started the meal with a can of their Ikezo Sparkling Peach Sake. I took it without any complaints because the server suggested this drink, knowing I like my drinks sweet. She brought out the can and began shaking it. I was worried that it would explode all over us but she assured me that it would be alright as she was shaking the jelly loose from the bottom of the can. As she poured the contents from the can into the mini martini glass she brought for the drink, I was reminded of a very loose jelly shot. And that's what it practically was. A sake with jelly in it. Suffice it to say I really enjoyed it and got another can haha. 5/5

We were started off with an appetizer sent to the table by the chef. Thinly sliced yellowtail tuna with a Hamachi paste. It was the chef's own take on the typical Yellowtail and Jalapeño. If it was supposed to be spicy, I didn't get any hints of it. But that is overlooked by the freshness of the fish. Delicate. No bad aftertaste to really show you how fresh the fish is (you'll hate how many times I'll be using the word fresh). 4/5.

I followed this appetizer with a tuna Toro tartar. I was slightly disappointed with it since the menu specified a quail egg, instead the server apologized and said it was topped with caviar. Couldn't go wrong with that. The saltiness and the little popping crunch of the caviar accentuated the very silky smooth of the very finely chopped tuna toro. There was enough tamari on the plate to help pull all of these flavors together without it being overpowered. 5/5

Next up I ordered Hamachi Hara (Fatty Yellowtail) Nigiri and Yakima Harasu (Seared Fatty Salmon) Sashimi (yes, today was a fatty and fresh day haha). I appreciate sushi places that do not try to stuff the guest with larger portions of rice to fish ration and the chef didn't disappoint. When the Nigiri came I was delighted that the fish was the main highlight and not the rice. Very little Wasabi to detract from the dish. And the sashimi looked larger than I have ever gotten from any other sushi restaurants. All of these were  washed down a second can of sparkling jelly sake. 5/5.

With all of this talk of Hamachi, I proceeded to ask the server, if by chance, they had any kama left. She checked with the chef and came back with the news that they do have it available. So. As you all know Kama is the collar of the fish. One of the most tender meat of the fish not including the fat of the belly. This for me was the best kama I've had so far. The chef was very meticulous at removing all of the scales. In the past as I dived in to eat the skin on other Kamas, there was plenty of scales left that were overlooked by the prep cooks. Not this one. The right amount of glaze was on the fish when grilled made everything stand out about the fish. The Filipino side came out and by the time the server took the plate away, there was no meat or fat left on that collar.  5/5

To end the meal as my friend needed to go back to work, I ordered a Natto Roll (Fermented Soy Bean Roll) which was not on the menu. I like my Natto very wet, but the flavor was there. Texture was soft as it should be. Nothing worse than a fermented soy bean that still has a crunch to it. 4.5/5.

All in all, the meal was wonderful. And just to reiterate, this place is definitely worth the drive!",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,5,4,5,3FLoCCyk13lasJU8RHH0JA

She told me this place is really good and I have to trust her because her sushi palate is very refined. This really cute and cozy restaurant is tucked into an odd corner of the city. There's not really much going on around here. However, if you do make it here, you're in for a treat. 

The space is very simple, clean and elegant. The sushi bar takes up most of the restaurant but we sat at a table because we didn't want to limit conversation by sitting in a horizontal line at the bar. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered only sake nigiri and a spicy tuna roll. My friends however ordered the churtoro, hamachi, fatty hamachi, grilled black cod, Masago nigiri, seared salmon nirgiri, white miso soup and other sushi I can't remember. What I had was really fresh and simple. The quality of the fish is top notch. Definitely melts in your mouth. The black cod is small but flavorful and extremely juicy. It was cooked perfectly. I didn't get a chance to try but my friends highly recommend the chutoro and said its the smoothest fish out of everything they had. 

I definitely want to come back here again as a treat.  The menu ranges in price.. Some things are really reasonable (spicy tuna roll is only 5.50) but other higher quality fish are more expensive ( 2 pieces of chutoro nigiri is 9 bucks).

The starter of housemade tofu, sweet shrimp and uni was clean, refreshing flavors together. 

We had a appetizer trio of a tuna tartare which was very well prepared, a jellyfish and cucumber salad which I actually really liked the crunch of. 

Miso grilled cod was next and this piece of fish was delicious. Very nicely grilled and seasoned. 

The sashimi set was solid. Very nice quality of fish. There was one that now I am sad I cannot remember the name of, that wasn't a ""typical"" fish, but it was the star. It was salty in its own way that was superb. 

The nigiri was solid, very fresh and the rice was nicely made. There wasn't anything really unusual in our set though, so that was the only disappointment for me. I like that they have a special soy for their fish, something a bit lighter. If only all places could have that. 

The reason why this was just a 3 star / A-OK is the fact the experience wasn't there. It was busy and only chef making everything and 1 person seem to be grilling/frying in the back. He was very nice, but everything was hurried as he had so much to do. I do admire his work came out quick, but precise though. I don't know how some folks were having things served one by one than a plate of nigiri, but perhaps during a less busy time. I would have preferred if it could have been that way seeing as there was only 2 of us at the sushi bar doing a omakase set. The servers were tied up at the tables and I had no drinks for a good part of this experience. At one point I had to apologize to chef and ask if there was any way I can get a beverage. They were friendly enough and were apologetic once it was brought to their attention that I've been trying to get their attention. 

Quality is there, but I might try all our quality sushi places before I come back here. Next time hopefully for dinner we can have a less hurried experience.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,2,3,DzzrhsiwNdmSOxo0-1hHfw

5094707,2016-07-19,22,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"Bridging the gap between the classic Edomae sushi giants (Yui, Kame, Kabuto) and everything else.  Hiroyoshi fills a niche, offering Japanese sushi experience to those more experienced while discretely offering other, less intimidating choices to the uninitiated.

Tip:  Discretion requires assumptions.  If you're Japanese, you will get the full experience with no ingredients held back.  Not Japanese, rolls and less challenging ingredients (no uni, fish sperm, monk fish liver, etc) will make up your omakase.  That said, begin a dialogue with the chef if you want something in a different ""category"".

Note:  This is not an Edomae experience.  Fish and seafood isn't brought to temp ahead of service rather the more common, ""everything chilled"" service.

Straight to it, the rice, excellent short grained rice, gently seasoned with a pleasing salinity, very few broken grains, lightly compacted.  The seafood, uber fresh and well sourced.  As it should be, seafood is sourced from where the product is the best at the time.  Understand that highly seasonal fish will come and go.  Fish too rice ratio perfect (no need to open your throat and swallow as only half fits in your mouth).

Ala carte and omakase both offered.  It's fun to constantly converse with the chef, ask what's fresh, and different, and be willing to splurge and experience anything.  Omakase is however the way to go for first time visitors.  

Eat all sushi as served.  Each is seasoned or sauced as the chef feels best showcases the fish.  Do NOT be that guy who dunks everything in soy sauce.

Highlights on a recent visit, live East Coast scallop sashimi cleaned and served in shell, candy of the sea.  A firm and gently oceanic sayori (needle fish) as sashimi and unctuous hamachi hara (yellowtail belly) as nigiri whose fat melts on the tongue and releases the best characteristics of the fish.  Live Santa Barbra abalone as nigiri has great texture and ""crush"" with a clean sweetness.  Shima aji as nigiri, huge fat content but so fresh there is no hint of fishiness, firm texture turning creamy on the palate.  Uni tempura dusted with matcha salt, very good.  As delicate crisp exterior and warm, creamy interior whose richness is tempered by the bitterness of the tea.  Needless to say, the cold water Hokkaido uni is outstanding, fresh, and creamy; the otoro properly graded and perfect with the lightly aged soy.  

Sushi bar typical service.

Yes. I'm giving Hiroyoshi a TWO-STAR rating because I left the restaurant disappointed and unsatisfied. 

My disappointment:
- It was over-priced for what I got. When the cost of dinner for two starts to creep upwards to the $200-mark, my expectations are just as high. Before I go on, I much emphasize that I LOVE omakase menus because I am (most of the time) very pleased with what the chef presents. I will not specify what was served in the omakase menu because I respect the chefs and will leave future patrons that surprise. However, I was not pleased with the quality of the ingredients and the taste. Food textures were not complimented, flavors weren't emphasized enough.
- The price. I'm no stranger to expensive meals. I'm not stranger to sushi or Japanese cuisine. At the end of our dinner, the tab was $205 and I still tipped just shy of 20%. Why? Because the service was really good...a little too good.
- The pace. The best part about omakase experiences is that I would get to enjoy the hard work and mind of the chef. However, in order to do that, one must need the time. The courses came out in speedy fashion. Hardly giving us the time to contemplate the previous serving. It was RUSHED. PRESSURED. CHEAPENED. The servers were VERY nice and observative.

Unsatisfied:
- The Omakase menu was upsetting as far as taste and quality. Again, the textures were troubling, the flavors were bland, and the quality was sub-par.
- I expected a bit more food when the server came to our table and said, ""okay that was the last course. Dessert is next."" I asked to order a hand roll because...well... I was still hungry.
The best things about my experience: The employees (even though they performed like an F1 pit crew when moving on to the next course) 10/10. The presentation of the courses 9/10. There is definitely hard work and effort in the presentations.

Final thoughts: Go to and eat at Hiroyoshi. Give it a try. Hopefully you will enjoy yourself and have a pleasant time. I will not go eat there again.",mhHHgIC1HCAIq8tkGvtisg,5,0,2,YfawArBPdQjQT386MqFzPg

5529221,2016-07-12,80,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"Never would I have thought a restaurant like this would exist in a relatively dead area of West Charleston (yeah, that nail salon next door looked decent), and never did I expect them to deliver what was easily one of the best sushi dinners I've had in Vegas.  

The $85 omakase (chef's choice) was a no brainer since I wanted to try as much as possible.  Chef Hiro and his staff were first class from beginning to end.  It was easy to appreciate the pride he took in his craft, and the effort to obtain the best ingredients possible to execute an excellent course dinner that was already 5 stars only four plates into dinner.  The servers were incredibly attentive as well and earned every bit of gratuity. 

Highlights:

Saba:  Even though it was just one piece, not only did the freshness of this (holy) mackerel stand out, but what Hiro put on top of the nigiri really knocked it out of the park.  Ginger, scallion, flavored oil, garlic, and what I can only presume was fairy dust really made this one of the most memorable bites of the evening.    

Tuna:  Whether it was seared, fatty, or served as sashimi, every appearance of my favorite fish shined brightly.  The nigiri duo of chutoro and otoro, otherwise known as my BFF's, had my eyeballs rolling upon first bite.  Minimal chewing was required as it basically melted in my mouth.  As wrong as it was to do, I actually ate the otoro piece upside down to fully enjoy the tenderness and oily fish flavor.  Forget about adding any soy sauce or wasabi and take in these delicious babies as delivered.  

Hiro also threw in a piece of ""special chutoro"", which did not feature the signature white streaks of fat.  A very different taste compared to the pieces earlier, it was a stupendous way to end the meal.  From marinated jellyfish to scallop to miso cod to fresh water eel to expertly made tamago, the chef created a wonderfully well rounded meal that could be totally different each day based on the fresh catch.  

I do like that they're flexible with the omakase and can customize it.  The gentleman that sat next to me from San Francisco on his third visit in less than a month opted for a 27 piece nigiri course dinner, which included Maine lobster, the prettiest piece of kanpachi I'd ever seen, and a bunch of other delicious items that I desperately want to try on my next visit.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,134,111,5,zEoDwiWlvK0y-kK35TncEg

Let me first start by saying that this was the best ""true"" Nihon sushi restaurants you will experience outside of Japan.  I'm not a professional food critic, but have experienced many of the best sushi restaurants from Osaka to Otaru.  If you understand me you know what I'm attempting to convey.  Hiro-San and his wife are highly trained and experienced in the profession.  From protocols to hospitality I was most certainly amazed.  This couple and their staff made me feel as if I was back in Hokkaido; superb quality ingredients, service, and deep respect for tradition.

It would be a waste of time for me to write anything more.  However, it would be a waste of time for you expect anything more for any other sushi restaurant on the strip.....Uber yourself and friends for an superb and top of quality experience.  

Greatest fear of this incredible restaurant.....not being able to get a table In the next six months.  Suuuuugoiiiii!",OYc5iqy4fURDiyhV5WFtkw,1,2,5,uWd3nH0MNsAqTh7kvP1smg

I definitely recommend this place as a last-minute alternative to other establishment joints out there. Especially if scheduling an appointment is two weeks away!!

We'd made advanced reservations for the sushi bar a couple weeks ahead.  They do seem to want you to pick an omakase ahead of time so we went with the $100 one.  (""We have omakase, $85 and $100.""  Me: ""Ok"" ... awkward pause .. ""Um, which one would you like?"")

We arrived slightly early but our spots were already waiting for us.  They didn't seem too busy, anyway (Saturday night).  They confirmed our selection of the $100 omakase and took our drink orders and then we waited for the eating to commence.

Based on the photos I've seen on Yelp, they stick to a script with their omakase.  I liked almost everything but it was a script nonetheless. They didn't really ask us about preferences (I would have said no mackerel) but other than that, I was down for everything put in front of us.

Presentation is stunning as you can see in the photos.  Fish was fresh and well seasoned.  I poured only a couple drops of soy sauce at once point for the sashimi.  

Service was great and they presented us with beautiful desserts afterwards.  We were quizzed on where we were from and how we found out about them.  They weren't so surprised to hear that I had Yelped them but were very thankful we made the time to go.  There was one server who talked our ear off - very very nice but I could tell the sushi chefs were trying to will her back to her spot in the corner lol.

Definitely a great experience and if I lived in the neighborhood, this would undoubtedly be our regular sushi place.  I hope they stick around for a long time.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,1,4,5,tGMExKCdzi3ncECKQjrtig
5660224,2016-05-02,1,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"First I just want to state that the reason that I gave this restaurant 4 stars not because there's anything wrong with the restaurant but because in my book Kabuto is truly a 5 stars sushi restaurant.  But keep in mind that Kabuto is way more expensive that Hiroyoshi, so it's difficult to compare them. With that said I love this place. 
Things I love about this place:
Sushi is fantastic, loved every single pieces that I had. All the fish were great and the rice is excellent.
Tempura uni is a must try. My wife doesn't like uni but she loved this dish as well. The batter was thin and crispy and very light, not greasy at all. One of the best tempura I have had in a long time.
They also allowed us to order their omakase dessert a la carte which was a perfect way to end our meal. My favorite was the creme brûlée, so creamy!
Only thing I wasn't  totally satisfied was the Hiro Tamago. It doesn't really taste like eggs omelet, it tasted and feel more like a cake. Not bad but just not my thing.
Overall it's a wonderful sushi place that I enjoyed very much without costing me an arm and a leg.

5763743,2016-09-23,1,vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA,"So there were 6 of us as a group, and we all had different expectations and experiences with authentic Japanese cuisine. One of us have never tried Omakase before, and then there's me who only order Omakase (Chef Choice) with every opportunity I get from Japanese restaurants, our feedback to this restaurant is clear:

Sushi Hiroyoshi is not one of the best, but THE BEST Japanese dining experience ALL SIX OF US have ever had!!!

From the artistic display and unforgettable flavor of each course to the impeccable service and meticulous wizardry of the staff, we were completely blown away at the entire dining experience. It's the best $100 I have ever spent on anything, period.

You know Chef Hiroyoshi is hardcore about his food when each course is almost too pretty to eat. But when you actually savor each course, it brings you to food heaven. You don't have to be addicted to Nigiri Sushi to appreciate the quality and creativity to each piece of perfection. When he prepared the Santa Barbara Uni and Hokkaido Uni Nigiri side by side for us (since we are Uni lovers and we told Chef ahead of time) and told us to compare the difference, we were ecstatic. The Hokkaido Uni nigiri in a spoon was like the feeling of love at first sight, the flavor just exploded inside your mouth like the butterflies you get when you are deeply infatuated. Then the Santa Barbara Uni nigiri was like the feeling of getting married, the sweetness of it just lasted in your mouth for a very long time, just like when you knew you were going to make your partner happy for the rest of her life.

And after 20 courses or so, just when we all thought the meal couldn't get any better, Chef calmly told us to save some space for desserts. We were all full at that point, but who can refuse free dessert? Therefore we got the vanilla creme brûlée and the mange cheesecake, and when I had the first bite of each I looked at my friends, we all stood up in unison with a disbelief in our eyes, how in the world can a Japanese restaurant make the BEST WESTERN desserts that we have ever had? How could the creme brûlée tasted this perfect? Sure, the sake might have helped a bit with our taste buds, but we all unmistakably knew it was the best damn creme brûlée and mange cheesecake we have ever had.

Please save up some money and go on a mini vacation to Sushi Hiroyoshi! Chef, I hope you are reading this, because our visit to your restaurant was the highlight of my Bachelor Party!!!",LBaPOIboPeDhlE5cH-15tQ,2,1,5,SMEVluIi2J6aR9i78nplHg

We ended up going back two consecutive nights for dinner and would have gone back a third, but that was the night they were closed for the week. 
The sashimi was delicious, fresh and so artfully arranged. We tried a varied and wide array of both sushi and shasimi and EVERYTHING was a treat!! 
Kei waited on us much of the time we were there, and Austin and a few other wonderful staff were very present and helpful throughout, everyone was kind and very, very quick and efficient. Kei's knowledgeable information about the various types of saki we were trying was extremely valuable and allowed us to make choices that we were very happy with.

This is truly an incredible Japanese sushi restaurant. Top quality ingredients, great service, and so much attention to detail. It's literally a little mom-and-pop type of shop, and the sushi chef, Hiro, is magnificent. I came here on a quiet Wednesday evening with a group of friends, and we had a wonderful dining experience.

First off, THE FISH IS SO GOOD!!!!  I ordered the 3 small appetizers (1. Uni w/ steamed tofu - so creamy and not fishy at all, 2. Steamed spinach and mushrooms - a little bland but fresh, and 3. pickled jellyfish/cucumbers - fresh and light), an order of Salmon nigiri - not the best I've ever had but very good quality, an order of Chutoro nigiri - OMG, MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH GOOD, and Hiro's Tomago egg - tastes like a fresh egg cake :)  Would also highly recommend the Miso Cod which is flaky and buttery and cooked with great flavor!

What really brings it over the top is the attention to detail. The plating is beautifully thought out, and you can tell all the dishes were made with care. Our waitress explained every dish she placed on front of us, and she was very friendly :) I ordered the miso cod and a crab roll to go, and she made sure there was ice packing for my to-go sushi order! She also easily split all our checks with no issues. A+ service!

Decor is simple and clean. It's a small restaurant, and for now, it's not very busy, so it's perfect.... (I'm sure that will change soon once word gets out about how awesome this place is).
