You have 1 bartender working when you know Sunday nights can be busy due to hockey league so they should staff better. 

What really pisses me off is we got here at 8:45pm and I had to go look for someone at 9pm to get our order. I was looking forward to ordering from their menu and then the waitress said the kitchen was closed. I asked when the kitchen closed and she said 9pm. Well if they would've seen us at 8:45-9pm we could've had a chance to eat a decent dinner. 

They really need to learn how to staff better. Only reason why I gave them a extra star is because the cost of the food. Other than that, the service sucks.",oljGa48aGXWwlq8ltcxAMQ,1,1,2,ntER7QxihvM5_UJP-oKCuw

Tacos, pulled pork sliders, fried avocado, queso dip and chips, fries with chorizo and cheese.  All part of the Uno Dos Tres menu.  Cheap bear and frozen margarittas.  Sit me down with a handful of $1 tacos and a cold Dos XX Amber and I was set for a good evening.  But now that they don't have that special menu anymore, it is just another bar with average drink specials.  I've lost my will to live in the Fiesta Rancho and Blue Agave.  Maybe they'll bring it back.  Wink Wink Nudge Nudge, management.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,S4OLjiGLIa0DUs4jC7cfsw

We stopped coming because of the service we felt like we would get ignored. That was not the case today at all. Junette was a shining star. She constantly checked on us. Had our drinks filled the whole time. Coming back more often just for junette!!!!!,IrqrLFfMczz8WEjeqFBRCg,1,0,5,Sclwi_JVTIHAkQWKDmt_yQ

I was really surprised to find such a great bar in this part of town.  I'll be back for sure!!!,JQlzHruOqwMuueStY_9_DA,0,0,5,es5vNlgoZ1oWIL2I_Ly0zA
