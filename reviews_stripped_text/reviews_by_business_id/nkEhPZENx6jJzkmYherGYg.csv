At first, I was going to write ""not much on atmosphere"" - but that's not exactly true. The restaurant is not heavily decorated, but during my visit,  the place was humming with native Ethiopians speaking several different languages. There was a soccer game on the TV, and the (mostly male) clientele were happily cheering on their teams while drinking delicious and crazy-strong coffee.

[Side note: Ethiopia is where the coffee bean originated, and they've got the preparation and presentation nailed. Not for the meek, but a joy for coffee lovers! ]

There is a traditional dining area with small, low tables and chairs - great for conversation and sharing food. There are also many Western tables, and a small outdoor seating area. 

I had the vegetarian sampler plate, and it was fantastic! Several different preparations of legumes ranging from very mild to deliciously spicy, a savory greens dish, and a rich potato-and-cabbage stew were all served together on a bed of injera - the soft sourdough flatbread that is somewhere between a pancake and a tortilla. 

As in most Ethiopian restaurants, the food is eaten by ripping off a piece of the injera, using it to pick up some food, and popping it into your mouth. No utensils. It's easy and fun. Just be aware.

An excellent choice, both for the seasoned diner and the novice.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,4,1,5,mW9Wy2WL1fZjsTpNIH-8vg

We had kitfo and beef tibs. Food was good would definitely go back next time I'm down in the area.",UyKDOVGcGMpjwC8_8PCnRw,0,0,4,sySIX7bYM3NLy1sp35MA_A

Tibs are my favorite, meat with onion in oily delicious Sauce.
Family managed and the owner does his best to take care of you
If it's crowded and you had to wait for food, we were hungry, just be patient.. it's worth it
Ambience was good as there was a soccer game on TV 
Be prepared to eat with your hands, you can ask for a spoon as well
Try it it's good",-82rXMO7VKl65KIrAnl0AQ,0,0,5,Qio2WRwwT7_KELw_ojmh9Q

No menu, full of locals, fresh food, traditionally prepared, and tastes delicious.

The owner is super helpful and nice, just tell him what meat you want (or veg option) and he will set you up with a massive platter of various dishes served on top of DELICIOUS injera (traditional Ethiopian flat bread).",OwtAig8-OxHkQCS9Xrrz-Q,2,3,5,YZDD61nCxB7rE7dMO0PINQ
3300679,2014-08-24,0,nkEhPZENx6jJzkmYherGYg,"My friend & I both had the vegetarian combo, which I thought was just fabulous. This was only my second time eating Ethiopian, and while I was not enamored of the food at the other place, here I became hooked. My friend adores Ethiopian food, but apparently she thinks it is all delicious, so it is hard to get a comparison from her. :) 

I wish I knew more about the food so I could tell you more about the veggie combo. There was a portion of lentils in a yellow ""sauce"", lentils in a red ""sauce"", some kind of lentil biscuit? in a barbecue sauce, string beans & carrots, turnip greens (pretty sure they were turnip greens), and salad. I loved them all. Well, I wasn't crazy about the lentil-biscuit-thing, but the barbecue sauce it was in was delicious. I was going to take pictures of the food, but I got distracted by trying to add this place as a new restaurant in Yelp, sorry about that.

The platter was $10 plus tax, and it was enough for lunch and a massive midnight snack. Plus when she packed up my food, she gave me an extra piece of injera bread, which I used the next morning to eat my breakfast & sop up my over-easy eggs. Yum!

This is also a ""market,"" but again, the place is so small. There were a variety of dried beans for sale, and a few items for which I was not sure of the use, but I think they were kitchen items. The best part (to me) is that they sell packages of injera bread, although the packages seem very big! I don't know if I would be able to use a whole package in a few days, but I am so glad that I know where I can get some injera, because it turns out I love that stuff. There is also a counter area, with a sign indicating the meats and the special meats they sell. (I don't know what special meats are.)

So.. the breakdown: The pluses are that the food was fabulous & cheap. The lady was very nice. They sell injera bread. They are open from 4am to 1am. What?? Yes, it's true. There is a postcard-sized flyer that says 4pm - 1am, but the lady said that was a misprint, they open early for breakfast.

The neutral: This is a tiny place, capable of seating 9 (3 tables of 3 chairs each). The tables & chairs are very nice, but the overall decor is ok.

The bad: there was a faint odor that I didn't care for, I think it's because of the meat market section. I don't know if it would bother anyone else, but it made me uncomfortable when I walked in. I got used to it after a little while. I wanted to try Ethiopian coffee, but they were out. They didn't have menus. (Huh?) And they lady didn't speak much English, so it was hard to know what the food options were. Best I could figure was that I had the choice of the vegetarian combo or the lamb. However, the postcard indicates they offer a large breakfast selection. I think if you were Ethiopian, and knew what you wanted already and how to order it, then this would be the perfect little place to get some delicious food. But for me, I don't know the food very well, so the lack of a menu or the means to communicate is a difficulty.

If this wasn't the first review, I would probably have given 3 stars as an overall rating. But the food was very good, the service very friendly, and the prices very reasonable, and I think more people should come & check this place out.",OdexeMpufpv2H4yZt2dIZg,3,1,4,w8CITZ004azeivyOo-5PnA
3575608,2016-06-21,5,nkEhPZENx6jJzkmYherGYg,"Really, Yelp?! You fooled me again with all the five star reviews... 95% of the time you are right and I appreciate it, but 5% of the time you are wrong. This place was the 5%.

I had a bad morning today. I was planning to have late breakfast at Flock & Fowl for their famous chicken rice but they closed down on me because the health inspector was there and they couldn't serve me anything until she leave. Waited 15 min and I left. I did a Yelp research and found out about this place. 6 solid five star reviews. I like Ethiopian food, so I decided to try this place.

This place is located right next to AT&T store. When I was parking my car, I noticed two heroin addict bums (come on, you know what they look like) hanging in front of the store. Well, as long as the food is good, it doesn't stop me. As soon as I walked in, I thought I was gonna pass out from the over kill smell of incense. It was so strong I got dizzy a little. What is this place a smoke shop???!!! I saw three Ethiopian (Maybe not?) people sitting down. OMG. They were staring at me like they never saw an Asian person in their lives!! How rude!! I should have left at this point but I didn't. I thought I had to order something. How stupid. So I ordered a cup of coffee. The lady didn't understand me, so I pointed the Folgers coffee container, then she finally understood. I noticed they sold some spices I have never seen before.

I literally ran out of the store. I was scared. Got in the car and sipped the coffee. Sour old coffee, of course. I will never recommend this place to anybody. If you are from Ethiopia, maybe you'll enjoy the smell of the store and the spices they sold there.",RpLeX_kRHbrW5v5YH-R0nQ,4,3,1,QtRTdZ_wsDmJ8mwnMF1dXQ

4374222,2017-02-01,3,nkEhPZENx6jJzkmYherGYg,"Like the other reviews have said, it is a pretty sketchy place. I probably wouldn't go on my own at night. Although it is also a market, their products are limited. They have a variety of beans, grains, and spices. A deli counter was there, but it was empty at 8pm.
There is only one menu available if you ask for it and no prices are listed. My boyfriend and I just asked for a veggie platter, which we didn't see listed. The veggie platter was really great. There were some different things in it that we'd never tried before, and all of it was flavorful. Delicious and fed us both for $10. Lots of food and we were given extra injera as well. Water is available bottled.
Come for the food but don't expect much else. Seemed like an authentic experience.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,5,7,4,6RntxNBD-9hjq9gGIBAeUw
5847297,2015-06-25,1,nkEhPZENx6jJzkmYherGYg,"Please note that the Yelp map location is NOT in the right place!  I ended up in the backyard of some home in North Las Vegas when I followed the Yelp directions.  The correct address is near the crossroads of Decatur and Flamingo.

Came here based on the Yelp reviews.  I wanted to find a low key local Ethiopian place.  This place is very basic, but the people were extremely friendly.  They asked if we wanted meat or vegetarian, we said both, so they just made us a platter of assorted items.  All very tasty!  And two portions (that fed 3) only came to $20!  

If you don't mind really basic decor, this is a great place!",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,4,2,5,KSB1bAeZ8oBhQIsJw1oxZw
