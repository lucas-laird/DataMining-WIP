The bread was excellent. The croissants and few other breakfast pastries were out of this world, I would come by every day for them if I could.
They have a nice selection of chocolates, but when I asked some questions about the cashier about some of the ingredients( my wife is lactose intolerante) , she told she didn't know because they buy them and would have to check . Not a big deal, nothing wrong with purchasing some of your items, but when you pay that much for chocolates and you go to a french pastry shop, It is  expect from them to make them from scratch , if not I would find some on the internet....too bad I was ready to buy 2 dozens...
The fresh pastries were OK, but nothing exciting about them . Their macaron were good, but they were all piled on top of each other , most of them either cracked or broken. but from looking at pictures posted by other yelpers, it just seems like I was there on a bad day.

I made an initial payment to do cake samplers, they shortly there after called me and informed me in the two weeks I needed a cake done it was impossible to get sample flavors done so ""I would have to just trust them with my wedding cake"" so foolish! They f**ked it up so bad!! 
They appeared nice enough every time I gave them more money even though it seemed to keep no official record of my visit or inquires because I would get continuous voicemails for more money after the initial payment and every time I went in to pay they had to re-design my cake multiple times. I wanted a simple 8 person cake, white with red roses seemed simple enough. I did want different flavored cakes THAT THEY OFFERED and different flavored frostings. On my wedding day I ended up catching a cold and pushed back the ceremony an hour, they could not hold the cake, they WOULD NOT hold the cake a minute longer so we decided fine we'd pick it up & I was devastated. For as much money as we paid and as many people we told exactly what we wanted, for them to completely ignore everything and give me a plain vanilla cake with flowers that were literally in the box they gave it in ALREADY COMPLETELY FALLEN OFF.

It is layers of slivered almonds, fresh strawberries, whipped cream and dense white sponge. Three to two stars for everything else. The thing that baffles me about this patisserie is that they sell the classic french goods, but everything is so messy in its execution. The macarons are thick and haphazard. The palmiers are the same. The croissants are dense. The baguettes are almost sweet in flavor and have a crispy, crackly exterior and spongy interior. Where's the chew? We have tried every pastry and always resort back to the good old frasier. They recently increased the prices, but 5.25 for a huge slice is still extremely fair. We love their quiches in the cafe, but the french onion soup lacks that deep beefy, rich caramelized onion, salty flavor. The nicoise salad utilizes canned green beans, and I would expect some sort of rich oil-cured tuna. They could use a little polish, refinement, in their execution, and I often wonder the turn around on their product, because their cases are always fully stocked.",ep4aZPMzVKiraXaReA-S1A,0,0,3,SAYRTqcoQ-dceCO4alLp-A

Fresh pumpkin is great, but some can be bitter or watery and lack flavor. The chef did nothing to compensate, no salt even.

AWESOME place, but I could do without the ""trendier than thou"" French patrons at a French bakery...  that's a joke. Seriously this place is so legit French people are patrons of  the establishment!!!

I've been on and off the strip in search of the BEST French Bakery and it is my opinion that one does not need to look any further than this place. Their food and baked goods are fabulous and I highly recommend a visit to this bakery. Since discovering this place, I have encountered stories from people as far away as Henderson that know of this bakery and make the 30 minute journey just for Patisserie Manon. 

My first stop here was because it was close to the house and I was in search of breakfast pastry or two. Once there I noticed that they also had mini quiches so I purchased two to take home for my wife and all I can say is WOW (taste was great). Since that time, I have had the pleasure of having had and fallen in love with the following menu items:

From the Bakery:
Baguettes - Crunchy or Soft and oh, so light and wonderful.
Viennoiserie - my favorite is the Pain au Chocolate
Macarons - As they should be with a crisp shell and soft airy goodness inside 
Individual Cakes - Fraisier is my favorite followed by the Foret Noir

From the Bistro: 
Quiches - various flavors but my favorite is still the spinach and goat cheese 
Ham or Turkey Croissant
Croq Monsieur - yum, yum - I like a fried egg on top of mine

There are more items on the menu that i have yet to get around to sampling, but the ones listed above are what I have tried.

lets see, what else; the place is family owned, the service is great and the people are personable. 

The only CON:
Lattes are a bit of a disappointment, it is my understanding that they just have a premix or something like that, which is fine since it is a Patisserie and not a Cafe. They do have regular coffee which is fine - also the premixed Lattes aren't bad or anything, I like the Mocha myself, I would just prefer the ability to order up a fresh made latte or an espresso sometimes. 

...after writing this updated review, I now feel the urge to go pay them a visit; damn them for being so close to my house.",cxwHGWYjuRB31XubACJNjQ,0,1,5,HW967D1456VoCwiZfY34uw

The lady working behind the counter was friendly and greeted us right away.  We started to take a look at all the baked goods, there were all kinds of cakes, croissants and macarons in a rainbow of colors and flavors.  We decided to get one of each of the macarons, a coffee flavored eclair and a very rich and decadent chocolate cake (I forget the name of it) and two croissants, one regular and one with sausage (my boyfriend was disappointed it was a hot dog wiener not sausage) in the croissant.

We took our goods to go and when we got home dug into the cookies and cake.  The croissant was huge though, probably the largest I've ever seen or eaten!  And I would say the ginger macaron was not to my liking at all.

I also had an apple pastry with almond/pear spread beneath on a flaky crust that was to die for. I think that was about $4.00. 

The chocolate croissants are small and a bit more chewy/hard than I'd like, but still good. There are two different kinds depending on if you want more or less chocolate, and each of those are about $2.25.

The prices are reasonable (approximately $4.50 for a gigantic slice of cake) and the portion size, at least of pastry is huge.  I have been here about three times now, the most recent being yesterday where I finally tried the La Parisian (brie, ham and pickles on a baguette), the lunch special including a small bowl of soup and a small salad and a drink was about $10. The sandwich was what was to be expected although I would have preferred them to have melted the brie. My friend said that they have melted it before when she went there.  We also split a quiche Lorraine. The quiche was phenomenal, a very light and custardy texture, not overcooked or dense with great flavor. The best quiche I have had thus far. 

As for the pastries, where do I start? My favorite so far has been the coffee eclair, and I am not a big eclair person but it was perfectly baked and the coffee filling was not too sweet. Also had the chocolate cake which was great too. The chocolate croissant (my standard for any bakery) was authentic and reminiscent of the other french bakery I like The Baguette Cafe (although Patisserie Manon is much larger with much more variety, The Baguette Cafe is more of a lunch spot than a bakery). They have a varied selection of macaroon and for a macaroon they are quite good although I will admit I am not a huge macaroon fan. 

My mom came before and bought the flan, she was quite happy with it, granted she doesn't eat much so wherein I would have inhaled it in a night she took a week to eat it - which I guess goes to show how big their portions are. 

The cashier recommended a cake, which for some reason I can't remember the name of but it had a toblerone filling (I think it was called the Tobey but I am not sure) - I simply must try that one that next time I can justify going here!",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,3,1,5,vKLNNgNAmLzpxyzIPLdRPg

First problem, after waiting until my lunch ended I called to cancel the order and was told the order already left so I could not cancel the order.
 
Second problem, the food came an hour after their delivery time stated. 

Third problem, the food came missing the coconut flan and the spinach and cream cheese soup.

At this point I was fed up and told the driver I will not accept this order, it's late and missing items. I want to cancel it and have my money refunded. The driver David stated because of the delay and missing items I could get my refund, but he'd leave the food anyway. I told him I did not want the food so he decided to leave it with security and I went back to work leaving the food with security.

Fourth problem, your employee Cynthia has the audacity to say that there was only one missing item and that they'll refund the soup, but the flan is in the order and I'll have to pay for the rest. So per Cynthia I am to pay full price for an order that was an hour late and also pay for one item I never even got.

I informed the Eat 24 rep that the entire building is wired for audio and video and that security was willing to sign a statement on my behalf. I had to threatened to claim the charge as fraud and file a complaint with the BBB to get refunded.

826409,2017-02-27,3,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"This review is only based on the MACARONS.

I happened to be on this side of town and have been hankering for some macarons for a few days to find myself at this place, with a little bit of research. 

The pastry case is brimming with desserts which is makes this fat kid excited (points to self). Even more exciting is that they pretty much have the first top shelf dedicated to macarons. I was happy to see that they are only 1.25 a piece, so I got quite a bit. 

I picked out 16 macarons to go and left. 

They weren't pretty to look at; just fat gobs of baked almond batter sandwiched between a filling; but didn't really mind if they were going to be mind-blowing with flavor. To my disappointment, they weren't. To be fair, the consistency of the filling ( some were ganache, a sugary frosting and/or jelly) were pretty legit and tasted amazing. The macaron shells were getting crumbly dry. It seemed like they were one day way from absolutely falling apart when you touch them. 

To provide a little better understanding of macarons, they typically have a shelf life of two days; three is really pushing it. Any time after that, might as well lick cardboard. They lose flavor and crumble in your hands. They can be baked and frozen (let it goooooo!) till you are ready to eat them. All you would necessarily do, it let them thaw for 10-15 mins and they are ready for consumption. Or you can be an animal and eat them frozen (I have done this).
 The thing is is, you can't refreeze them. It dries it out quicker. 

I was disappointed that 13 out of the 16 were past its due date. 
Yes, it seems like they make their desserts in-house but not made every day. That probably means that they leave the macarons in the fridge (overnight) then bring them back out to sell what they can sell, then put them back in the fridge.. and who knows how long the process goes. 

This one was a bust, on to the next macaron quest.",qBcGvF_yAkxqZTrDzAjnaA,8,1,2,_HoQqc9zEn7oNAI1hJ6kIw

It's too bad that the price was the only good thing about it. It literally had no flavor whatsoever. The strawberries on the cake weren't bad, but if I wanted strawberries I would have paid less than $4.50 for what amounted to maybe 3 whole strawberries.

I also noticed that there were several people ringing customers up and they let some guy cut me in line.

    Nowhere on their sign is the name of this place and when I asked the owner. He said he didn't have time to replace the old sign       The owner/baker is not fluent in English. The inside looks disorganized and temporary as if someone just threw some tables and chairs arbitrarily into a space.  The display counters were messy and the pastries were packed in Styrofoam that you would get with cheap Chinese take-out food. 
Considering there were people in this place, by all measures, this place HAD to have great food!!!  Therein lies my disappointment.  The food was average.  The peach tart was without flavor and the raspberry white chocolate cake, which looks over the top delicious was heavy and once again lacked flavor!

Disorganization results in a 2 Star review.  Also very expensive for what you get.  Almost $15 for a soup, sandwich and drink combo.   The Tomato Soup was not good while the sandwich was mostly cheese for a ""Ham or Turkey""  Croissant.  

The croissants themselves are delicious and as mentioned here before, the drink situation is complex.  It doesn't have to be.  Buy a fountain drink dispenser.  Just coffee and one cold tea container are not cutting it.  

It took a while for my food to come
Out and then even longer for the extra Croissant.  See, the Croissants are in the front of the building while sandwiches are made in back.  So the server forgot to bring a Croissant.

I walked in for a relaxing Sunday lunch to find a good number of patrons, smiling staff, and the sugary/buttery aromas you'd hope to find in a good bakery.  The display cases are illuminated with a plethora of divinely colorful cakes and pastries; it really does feel like being a little kid again.  You might want to wear sunglasses, to hide the fact that your pupils are dialated like the people in Soundgarden's ""Black Hole Sun"" video.  (Is 90's Grunge fair to reference anymore?)

I came in with a book, and appetite, and high expectations.  The only thing that didn't get accomplished was the book part, since I was too involved with my food, and you can't eat a book.  Here are the specifics of my order:

Cup of Tomato Soup - Light and flavorful, served with two pieces of fresh baked French bread, perfect for dipping.  I enjoyed this soup, which wasn't as garlicy and basily as some Italian versions would be, but still contained subtle nuances of herbs alongside the tomato goodness. 

Bacon and Spinach Quiche - My favorite part of a quiche is the flaky, yet crispy crust on the outside.  This quiche was incredibly light and fluffy, which is exactly what many quiche lovers look forward to experiencing.  I found it too light, and lacking texture.  The flavor was nice, with the rich bacon coming through in every bite, but I wouldn't order it again. 

Macarons :
Salt Caramel and Butter - Rich, lovely, and perfectly divine.  I must say this is one of the best tasting macarons you'll find.  

Lemon - Also quite good, the lemon curd in the middle was bright and refreshing.

Pistachio - Very good as well, however the Salt Caramel and Butter stole the show here.  I would highly recommend having at least two of those. 


No pretense here, just well baked food for everyone, regardless of whether you call them ""Macaroons,"" or ""Macarons.""

 I've given high praise to La Terre's Croque Madam and finally opted to try Manon's to see how they compare.  I was pleased that they prepared it slightly different than LT.  it was triple layer - top layer, bread and over easy egg;  layer 2 - swiss cheese, ham and béchamel;  layer 3 - bread cheddar cheese ham and I believe some more béchamel.  Loved it !  As with La Terre, the bread is amazing - I give a slight nod to Manon for the two cheeses but the sammie needed some mustard to cut thru some of the heaviness.

Another first - ordered an actual cake - my daughter was in town this weekend so knowing her and her boyfriend, they love peanut butter and chocolate, I opted for a chocolate cake with peanut butter cream and whipped cream.  $20 for a cake that easily feed 8 people is great value - especially for the quality of this cake.

I have to ding them one star for the service - at times, the staff gives the impression they are doing you a favor in waiting on you.

We cut the cake up for 4 people and one of the macarons had mold on it. Yes, mold! I couldn't believe it myself as I know they make their cakes fresh daily. 

Well there goes $32. So I called them first to see if they could make it right. I talked to the manager, Gabriel and he said to send him a picture in which I did. Then he replied and went as far to accuse me that that wasn't the same cake they sold me that I sent in the picture. They also wanted me to bring the cake back to the bakery!!! Are they kidding me?! First of all, I live in Centennial and I drove to Boca Park just for the cake and took it work at a hospital in Henderson. So they want me to go back to work and pick out from the trash and then bring it back to them?! They're really crazy!

SERIOUSLY?! So not only did your cake have mold on it, now you are accusing the customer of making it up and there's no way at all that it could happen?! 

Well let me tell you it did have mold and I have the picture to prove it. It's right on top of the macaron topping that's clearly made distinctly at their bakery because theirs are uniquely plump! 

I have to say I am super let down that they didn't have any customer service skills to at least be sympathetic with the customer regardless if they believed it to be true or not. The owner flat out told me that never has it happened in 35 years and that he just doesn't believe me!!! WOW-all I can say is WOW!

The atmosphere is very nice and relaxing. The store and tables are always clean. The service is great. And all of the workers wear little red hats, super cute.

At first I was drawn here because of their delicious french macarons. They are by FAR the best macarons I've had in town. They aren't overpriced, they are $1 each and well worth it. 
I recommend the salted caramel peanut macaron!

Their quiches are really good and they are only $5 so they aren't ripping you off there either. Most of the their meals and sandwiches are decently priced. 

Their coffee is NOT good and definitely needs work in that department. For a french bakery, they shouldn't just have coffee sittin in a pot. 

They don't have selection of flavors and they use the Torani syrups. When I've gone, ""sometimes"" they have iced lattes sometimes they don't. That department is definitely lacking. 

I was happy to go there before Thanksgiving to grab some treats and I saw that they took orders for pies. A 16"" pie only cost $12 whereas a 12"" was only $9.  

 I ordered their cinnamon apple pie and it was BOMB. I took it to my parents house and EVERYONE loved it and it was really good with vanilla bean ice cream. 

The crust on the pie was like a flaky crust much like the crosses that were on the pie (it's kind of hard to explain w/o a picture) and the glaze wasn't overbearingly sweet. It was the perfect amount of sweet. 

Anyways, I highly recommend this place. Not ripping you off and good quality.

The interior here is definitely not going to win any awards, but the food is reliably tasty, for the most part. Also want to say that the service here is somewhat better than the Rainbow Rd. drive-thru location- loved how the front cashier called me ""dahlink.""

Planned to come in just for some late-night macarons, but snagged a single peanut butter and then opted for the aforementioned snail-toast. The portion is quite large- pictured a halved garlic bread loaf, topped with about seven or eight escargot and a liberal blanket of cheese, broiled to order. Overall taste could use a smidge more seasoning- salt or pepper, maybe, would perk it up a tiny bit more. Taste was just a tiny bit unbalanced, but quite tasty.

I was again a bit put off by a male employee- this one was in the rear of the store, and I ordered my escargot from him. It was in the case next to him, and I read the order title off of the signage in the window. In front of him.
His first reaction was a grimace, and then, ""Let me check and see if we have that."" Then he crouched down and pulled out the tray, eyeing them apprehensively.

Had my craving for escargot not been overwhelming, I likely would have cancelled my order and left. As it is, the order was tasty and I feel just fine. And I'll probably eat it again.

1597346,2012-06-16,1,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"It does not get better than this place, seriously.

Patisserie Manon is located downstairs on the far left side of the building behind Flemings at Charleston and Ft. Apache. 

The location is a bit diabolical as it is situated just beneath a few personal training studios - confronting someone with the option of delicious, beautiful French pastries right after an exhausting hour long workout just is NOT playing fair. 

That said, it is equally delicious when you are not famished. It is set up in two parts, really. The front register is for the bakery case - there are a number of different pastries in the case - eclaires, macarons, slices of cake, croissants, tarts, and more. They are pretty reasonably priced (around $4 each) and perfect for a sweet treat to enjoy there or to go. 

You can also purchase cakes at the front - their cake cooler is always worth a peek as they really do a gorgeous job with decorating. Lots of great colors and flourishes. These cakes are AH-mazing. My favorite is the Tobli cake. I bought it by accident once because it was the least expensive chocolate flavored cake in the case and I didn't want to spend the money on the more expensive truffle cake. It is called ""Tobli"" because it incorporates elements from the Toblerone Candy Bar - so chocolate and peanuts. There are crispy nougatey layers alternated with generous dollops of to die for chocolate cream filling, and dusted with more chocolate cream and peanuts.

I've since bought this cake a few times for various occasions and everyone absolutely loves it. Additionally, I purchased two of their Bouches de Noel (Christmas Logs) which are ""rolled"" sponge cake filled with frosting and decorated really cutely with a ""log"" exterior and little woodland animals. Super cute and a perfect hostess gift for the holidays.

The back section of the restaurant is focused on the savory yumminess - breakfast is nice - they serve a few different egg dishes with their amazingly flaky and buttery croissants, along with delicious quiches (the salmon and vegetable quiche special I had once was surprisingly amazing) Their soups are also quite good and my husband always ordered the ""French Hotdog"", which was a hot dog sliced and served on baguette with bechamel sauce - super yummy. Warning: the hot dog itself is not very high quality, but the rest of the dish is good enough, and novel enough, that it is still okay. If you're having both a meal and dessert, you usually order your meal and your dessert from the separate areas, not all on one tab. 

The staff are typically very nice - there are some who don't always come across as super friendly and there are occasionally waits, but I've honestly never had a bad experience there and anytime there is a wait, I can understand why (they have a lot of diners, or few employees, etc) 

The drink selection is the one downfall - for example, they don't currently carry any orange juice (or a selection of other juices), which is a bit odd for a place that is open for breakfast. 

Price: The pastries and savory food are a deal - very reasonable. The cakes are pretty expensive, but worth it in my opinion as they are unique, fresh, and delicious - your guests will talk about a cake from Manon for weeks. 

Cake Tip: The ""servings"" listed on the cakes are pretty generous - a ""4 serving"" cake serves at least 6, a 6 serving cake probably serves 8-10 slices, etc. 

In conclusion, if you have not been here, please go, it is great!",ZYdPYCi5UP75TrcGZV1FjA,2,2,5,ocq01J__87Ll_sgPFB_RJQ

----

I have an unhealthy obsession with French macarons. Whenever I come here, I order typically 10-20 at a time...just for me. They are just THAT good. Eating the macarons here just cheers me up and instantly makes my day better. 

One macaron is $1.25 I believe, and each one is made in house. The macarons here are large in size and have the perfect amount of cookie crunch balanced with flavorful, creamy filling/meringue. Every other bakery or café in town has generic, standard macarons (I'm looking at you, Sambalatte) that don't have that special homemade touch. 

They also have an incredible assortment of macaron flavors here as well. I have tried every flavor and my favorites are:

1. Pistachio (light, flavorful, and the pistachio meringue is divine)
2. Mango (perfectly crisp cookie with a melt-in-your-mouth mango fruit filling)
3. Rose (pink, girly, floral goodness)
4. Salted Caramel (it's salted caramel --trust me, it's good)
5. Everything else

Beyond the macarons, the other offerings this bakery has are lovely as well. My boyfriend loves their chocolate beignets and likes their eclairs as well. Their assortment of pastries differs slightly day to day here.

We had to ask for knives for the bread and butter, only one steak knife was provided.  The server was not courteous and it appeared that we were an uncomfortable distraction to her.   She ran away from the table before we could get a word out on the other concerns.  This will likely be our last visit to Manon for sit down or take out food.

""Where are you, my little object of art? I am here to collect you.  But madame! I have overstoked the furnace, yes? Madame! Your conduct is unseemly! Control yourself! Madame! ""

Oh the temptations abound in this gallery of delights.  So far all we have been able to sample in just two visits are the quiches we had for breakfast, mushroom and bacon and salmon.  I realize my quiches at home come no where close to Manon's fluffiness, lightness, textures and flavors.  We tried the cinnamon raisin danish, almond paste pastries, macaroons, apple struedels, pear tortes, almond/pear/almond paste tortes, oh and the coffee.  

Today we tried several flavors of macarons: salted carmel, chocolate pistachio and cafe.  Each one was delectable and the textures varied on each.  The salted carmel was light and fluffy with the salted caramel creme in between.  The chocolate pistachio was light but more brownie like with the pistachio creme in the middle.

I am stunned with reviewers who turn their noses up and say Meh, it isn't like in France.  That's like saying you cannot go into an art gallery in the States and appreciate the art there because it is not The Musée du Louvre.  Come on.

I appreciate the love, the care that goes into this bakery/cafe from the many different types of pastires, the beautiful and creative cakes, the artwork on the walls, the quiches, Coq au Vin, the Pate Plate, baked lasagne, etc.  

I want to encourage the owners to continue baking and amazing us.  It takes a lot of care, skill, experience and love to create these delicacies every day.  Merci beaucoup.

Their macarons are mishmashed together and piled high (which should have been the first clue), but I optimistically anticipated that what was lacking in beauty would be made up for in flavor.  Didn't happen.  *Sigh*  These were heavy, doughy cookie sandwiches with creme middles that were too sugary and very sadly flavored.  A chewy disappointing lesson learned at $1.10 each.  Even if I had no knowledge of what a true macaron should look and taste like, their version would still not pass for a Parisien delicacy.  Fortunately, service was pleasant, the decor a bit eclectic (which I like), and the bistro had some nice lunch offerings.  The French onion soup was okay--served steaming hot, with a stringy gruyere cheese topping, sweet caramelized onions and came with generous slices of baguette.

Mushroom Goat Cheese Quiche (3.5 stars): Pretty good, nothing near a quiche you get at Bouchon at the Venetian. The outside was too soft for me, but the inside was soft. 

Chocolate Almond Croissant (3.5 stars): By the time I got home it was soft, so maybe it tastes better when you eat it right away. Needed more chocolate.

Things I have eaten so far
-Croque Madame- its a ham and cheese sandwich with more cheese and a cheese sauce and a fried egg. Take that clean arteries. 
-Quiches- real men don't eat quiches, but luckily I am a fancy boy so I do. Spinach and goat cheese is respectable, as is mushroom and bacon but the quiche Loraine takes it IMO.
-Omelettes- If you know 3 things about the french its that they surrender, they are snobs, and they love omelettes. The last 2 really work in your favor here as the omelette is top notch.and you can get a large swath of ingredients added to it- Brie is a great one as they put two huge slices of it right on top. 
-Baguettes- I know, how good can bread be? Pretty good. Hot bread with butter is one of the simplest and most delicious things in the world and this place knows their way around the oven.
-Croissant- pretty damn good. Extremely flaky and buttery, the opposite of how I like my women.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,5,5,5,TtVW1u-2G-Cdc3PNB3b2lg

Although I've never been to France, I tried to envision myself in a Paris cafe with a cup of coffee and French pastry enjoying the food and scenery.  Alas, I just had to contend, for the moment, with my wonderful experience at Patisserie Manon as a substitute.  Ah well, c'est la vie!

A friend and I decided to venture to this location, which is located quite a trek from the Las Vegas strip.  And though we did take a wrong turn here and there, we finally made it to this French bakery in the middle of the desert.

The pastry showcase is just a plethora of sweetness.  Glucose levels will rise surely just by the mere stare of the variety of pastries and macarons on display.  I admit I wanted mostly everything that morning, but I figured I had to settle for just one thing as there were many places yet to visit on this recent Vegas foodie adventure.

After finally making a decision, I chose the strawberry cream pie.  Now of course, this does NOT resemble any version of American ""pie.""  Sandwiched between two flaky layers of croissant-like texture are sliced strawberries and whip cream, while the entire pie is finished off with powered sugar, MORE whip cream, and a whole strawberry.  The entire pastry was simply divine.  The BEST way to start the morning paired with a cup of coffee.   I was reminded of that cafe scene in ""Inglorious Basterds"" where Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent are having coffee and pastries.  More so for the pastry they ordered, with the topping of whip cream, and the flaky crust of the pastry itself.  

Before leaving we took an assortment of macarons to go.  My favorite was the salted caramel.  There were any flavors, but truly that was the most memorable.....and the blueberry, of course.

- Opera cake - for some reason it just tasted refrigerated and stale. 

- Mille feuille - the custard in this dessert was so eggy, it reminded me of an egg tart (where it all starts to gelatinize) rather than be a creamy custard.

- Fruit tart - the fruit was good but the custard was also the same weird eggyness as what was in the mille fuille. 

- Baguettes - THE SAVING GRACE. Delicious, but the size was definitely more American (bigger) rather than the traditionally thinner baguettes with flattened ends.

I made an attempt years ago to visit Patisserie Manon, but it wasn't meant to be. When I arrived that day, I was disappointed to find a sign on the door explaining that the business was ""on vacation"". I finally had a chance to stop by last night. We had dinner plans leading into a night at Myron's Cabaret Jazz. With dinner ending earlier than planned, we stopped at Manon on the way to the Smith Center for coffee and dessert. 

There's a mannequin at the door that made me do a double take while both coming and going. Just a word of warning for anyone who might be a bit jumpy. Like... me. 

The venue is massive and a bit misleading. It looks and feels like two restaurants - a bakery and then a sandwich/quiche/hot food spot - all under one roof, but it's really all the same venue. We ordered our coffee and dessert at the first part of the bakery. 

Man, oh man. When we first entered, my in-laws audibly gasped; both were in awe at the wonder of cases upon cases of beautiful pastries. Even with a lighter than usual selection due to Easter, I still found myself frozen for a second trying to decide what to order. 

My husband and I settled for macarons and an exotica cake. 

Here's the thing with the macarons. I love almond paste, chocolate, and pistachios. I also love Levain cookies. The chocolate-pistachio macaron, to me, is the Levain cookie of macarons. I'm in love. I equally loved the pistachio macaron. 

The exotica cake hit that hard to reach mark; most but dense, sweet but not too sweet, rich but light, flavorful but balanced. 

All of the dessert was well enjoyed with cappuccinos.  

The service was so attentive and warm that it was confusing for a second. This is to say that it far exceeded my expectations. 

I ordered a peach tart to enjoy with coffee the next morning. Despite being stored in the fridge overnight, it was still amazing.

It was a very slow Saturday afternoon at the bakery yet no employee looked up or greeted me when I walked through the door.  After standing in front of the display case or a couple of minutes without any offer of help, I turned around to walk out.  THAT was when an employee (with a very un-friendly expression on her face) asked if I needed any help.  Tempted to just leave, I took the higher road instead and gave them another chance.

I ordered four different pastries to take home.  Yes, this was a small order but I am not going to go crazy at a new untested place.

I will not return and will definitely tell EVERYONE about my horrible experience.

I never could find it though because it doesn't actually have signage that indicates this is Patisserie Manon. When you walk up it actually says Manon on the door, but from the street or parking lot it says French Bakery-Pastry-Bistro. We walked in at 8:30pm, and although they closed at 9 and the cashier looked tired, she was still very friendly. 

So the other day I was watching a Food Network baking challenge and the item they were making was macarons. I learned how they are made, and that the little crust underneath each one is actually called ""feet."" FYI it's not a good macaron if it doesn't have feet. Ever since then I have had an intense craving for these bite size treats. Manon had a variety of flavors to chose from-with feet, at $1.25 a pop. I chose salted caramel, chocolate, pistachio, mango, peanut butter, and strawberry. The salted caramel was amazing, followed by the strawberry. They were all good, but those were my favorite. 

I couldn't stop eyeing the delicious cakes and danishes that were on display. The cakes looked really amazing. They also have savory items as well; fresh bread, quiche, and croque monsieur to name a few. French onion soup looks divine and I plan on coming back to try that and some other items, definitely a little earlier next time.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,2,4,g61v7BUc2xSRjVeNBRkDtQ

 The only thing that made this less than a perfect bakery experience was that while the service was friendly and sweet (haha), it was a little on the slow side.

It honestly just tasted like chocolate cake to me and wasn't anything out of this world. 

I hope to come back and try other pastries and the sandwiches as well. 

The biggest point, I would say, is the decoration and branding. There is definitely some renovation to be done here.

Man, their quiches are so damn good. I get so angry at them every time I eat one of their quiches because mine just never quite measure up. i don't know how they get them so perfect every time. From the crust to the filling, everything is just so damn tasty. I will say though, the only one I've tried that I haven't been a big fan of is their chili one. I didn't quite like the how the quiche was kind of liquidy because o the chili. They do have a quiche special, where you get a quiche, soup or salad, and drink for only $8.95.

Cassoulet & Beef bourbignon are also two things that should be checked out. The cassoulet [ i do hope I'm spelling that right], is mainly pork, with sausage, bacon, and white beans served with a couple pieces of bread. The beef bourbignon consists of beef [duh] , carrots, onions, and pasta also served with a couple pieces of bread. You get this cute little pot full, all for 9.95 ! 

they have so many pastries there, it's ridiculous. I've only tried a handful of things myself, but most of it was pretty good. I was a little disappointed by their eclairs, but that was no biggie.

I chose a baguette with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, olives & swiss cheese. It came out to around $7, when I got my order I had four half slices of sandwiches, which is ALOT. The bread was perfect, they bake it fresh in the back and the sandwich was light and good. I would say its well worth the $7, you could even share it with someone.  After wards I moved onto the bakery, I was overwhelmed by the selections of pastries & cake! They have several types of macaroons, meringues, eclairs,  tartelette, slices of cake & chocolate croissants. I tried a slice of the strawberry cake which was delicious!

I also tried the cake made out of touberlone chocolate bar, at first bite it was extremely chocolatey and didn't think I could eat it.

The ham and cheese croissant:pure pleasure for my taste buds!Amazing!
But(there are couple of them ""buts""), the coffee was burned.Not the milk, but the coffee beans, so my latte was bitter.First impression with the vanilla eclair?Nice textures but way too sweet!I realize we're living in US, but the amount of sugar  overwhelmed the flavor of vanilla filling and the chocolate topping.
The chocolate croissant was very fluffy but again, the amount of sugar in the chocolate was way over the limit!
And then, to release all the flavors from the pastry, the croissant should be warmed, unless the customer says different, when on the table.

Manon came highly suggested for a sampling of their $1.10 French macarons, of course I couldn't pass that up, especially since I was just a half mile away. I took a quick look through their displays and discovered they had some pastries with apple, and some filled with crème, a few with raspberries, and chocolate too. If there is a dessert filled with Apple, you can rest assured I'm going to order it, and Manon had two. I chose to the French apple tart this time, I'll save the other for my next time through.

The macarons were amazing, but the surprise winner here was the raspberry gourmandise. Rest assured I'll be back for that one when I visit again. If you've not been to Manon yet, I would strongly urge you to check your reservations and come by for some of the best pastries I've ever had.

Happy Yelping!",8SgjU2fID9VqKQooFt1DIQ,10,6,5,GMj3-1FvaBKr2BhgT-1r0g

So far, I've had macaroons  (orange, rose, pistachio, vanilla) and a chocolate eclair.  Their macaroons are perfect- the cookie is perfectly chewy and flavorful with creamy, delicious filling. MMM! I thought there would be vanilla custard inside of the chocolate eclair, but it was chocolate custard! Game changer! The pastry was fluffy and had the right amount of icing on top and the custard.... well I haven't ever met a custard that I didn't like, but this custard was the bomb.com! So creamy and chocolaty!

My wife got a French hot dog and split pea and bacon soup. Both were quite good. I'm not big into hot dog's but who can resist when it's layered with cheese and served on French bread.

My mom got a croque monsieur which she said was just okay. My dad got a bowl of the split pea and bacon soup. My parents split a flan which everyone agreed was just okay.

My wife got a layer cake with peaches. It was decent.

Today's Pastry was purchased at 2:30 pm and eaten at 6 and it was kept refrigerated the whole time. Not sure what's going on. I told the lady at checkout about the stale cookie and she responded that I should have returned it. Really?

The silver lining was that I was pushed out of my comfort zone and forced to find new things. One of those things was Patisserie Manon, a French bakery close to SunCoast. 

I wasn't sure what to expect but we were greeted by giant display cases jammed with every kind of pastry known to man. Rainbows of macarons, custard filled eclairs, fruit tarts, lemon cremes, pies, cakes, cookies. It's a sugar addict's dream in there. 

The bistro is in back, an order counter where they'll pile a plate with a giant croque madame or some goat cheese quiche or a big salad. The soups need some help but then, when it's 115 degrees outside, soups aren't a big priority. Our service there was great (it's order window) and they've got a cute kids table for your little ones.

Lunch is very do-able here. A sandwich/panini/croissant/quiche paired with a soup or salad and a coffee drink for under $10! After gobbing your face with french delights, please make a beeline towards the highlight of all my experiences: the ginger macaron. Even if you're not a fan of the strong flavor of its root, you will be, please believe me. It's a beautiful medley of a spicy and sweet bite. It warms you up in all the right places.

I wanted French food one day and was guided here by all of the positive reviews but now I have NO idea what these others are talking about - it was disgusting. I'm now almost positive those people must be friends with the owners or something because, I'm sorry to say (and hear me out first!), there's NO way someone with a tongue and a mouth would like their food. I've had real French food (I'm not even referring to the expensive fancy kind) and this food wasn't even close to that. No pride in the quality or preparation and especially not in the taste. I wasted over $40 on food I couldn't eat, but to be absolutely sure - I tried at least a few bites of everything I purchased. I bought a sandwich, a quiche, the Niçoise salad, and a pain au chocolat and the only thing decent was the pastry. Maybe they do those better, but the actual ""French"" food was vile. Niçoise was cheap canned tuna that hadn't even been drained, canned green beans that hadn't been drained either, dry days old egg, canned olives, canned everything, and brown lettuce and all the other ingredients were poor and seemed filthy and definitely smelly. The quiche was soggy and looked/tasted like it hadn't been cooked thoroughly, had a soggy crust, and was virtually tasteless other than the soggy wet egg taste. The mushrooms were somehow hard and barely chopped. Service was poor and took a long time. The sandwich was awful as well. I can't remember the name but it was ham Brie butter and pickles - a favorite of French ""street food"" - and was awful. The Brie was the cheapest hardest Brie (normally a very soft delicate cheese) I've ever tasted in my life. The pickles were fine, the ham however was slimy deli meat you get out of a grocery store package - but worse. No idea where it was purchased, but Absolutely disgusting. Not at all edible. The only redeeming quality of the entire experience was the baguette used for the sandwich and the pastry. I scraped out the contents and made my own sandwich from it, but that was it. And I'm not even sure if they made the bread in house or bought it elsewhere. I'm sure I sound like a snob, and believe me normally I don't complain about food or write any reviews, but this was SO bad and such a poor excuse for food that I felt compelled to review because I wasted soo much money on food I was so excited to eat and it was absolutely terrible and inedible. Much to my dismay, I threw most of it out, so I'm hoping to warn others not to waste their time OR money. Maybe their pastries are good, and they focus on that, but I have no idea, and I certainly won't be going back to find out. If pastries are their specialty, they should stick to that and remove the restaurant part all-together. I feel bad for reviewing so harshly but Im shocked a restaurant of such poor quality exists and even more so that it had SUCH good reviews. Hopefully they will improve their quality over time and take pride in their food and its preparation/ingredients/taste because Vegas needs more French food.",CtNbtQKfkKXC_I71hgWpWQ,2,0,1,VZOmg-FLnkznRdHQKYNCwg

Bakery is in shoppes in back) for more than a year now...time to share the not-so-secret news of their fabulosity. Being in the same strip mall as my Physical Therapy (now Pllates & massage) center has been both a blessing (I found them!!) and a curse (their yumminess can find my hips if I don't reign in my nom nom desire...)

Truly is a bustling bakery with ample seating and cases of confections to tempt any taste. At one point or another myself or guests have probably tasted everything in the case (oink) in my defense: frequently I'll buy assorted pastries/slices of cake in lieu of a whole cake to allow for entertaining variety. Standouts here have been: chocolate tart (approved by my chocoholic Mom) Tropizienne, Napoleon, French Brest, lemon tart, the Noel Cake at Christmas & a special order Croque en Bouche I had made for a friend visiting from Paris for his birthday. And those divine Macarons: I'm torn because they had discontinued my favorite ginger and I fell in love with salted caramel in the interim: since ginger is back, guess I'll have to alternate. They are reminiscent of Lauderee and beyond reasonable at $1 each. I like to put a sleeve in a cellophane bag as a hostess gift, colorful and unique and many have never had a macaron before. Though not a coffee drinker, I'm told they pour a mean cuppa. Their brioche is spot on (and by far, at any bakery my go- to, so this is saying a lot) and their other breads and croissants win yummy labels often from all who take a nibble. 

The husband and wife team of Jean-Claude and Rachel are friendly, obviously dedicated to quality and it shows as you savor their savory offerings in the bistro in back of the store. Soups, a variety of yummy sandwiches, some on their oh-so-light-flaky-buttery croissants, Croque Monsieur (my friend raved) the veggie quiche is delicate and delicious(I hear great things about their many quiche varieties) Nice place to meet some friends and catch up in a reasonably priced family owned business that continually delivers great taste, great service and inspires great willpower in me as I go to & from Pilates 2x weekly.

I was so focused on my sweets that I didn't even realize it until I got home and noticed I had an unexplained extra box. So, to the couple before me, I am so sorry!! I didn't return them because I figured you'd be gone and wouldn't want food from my trunk anyway. 
As for the pastries... mostly very yummy. I ordered the rose, salted caramel, and pistachio macaroons. They were okay. I've had better. I've had worse. The rose was my favorite, but then again, it always is.
     The slice of strawberry cream cake was huge! Super sweet and a ton of almonds on it. I'm a person who can pretty much eat sugar by the spoon and this cake was a bit much. I recommend it, but make sure you either split it with someone or cut it up to have over a few days. 
     As for my unintentionally ill gotten goods. Yeah, this thing is awesome! I don't know what it's called but it's chocolate cream between kind of a blonde brownie/streusel. Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes! Maybe next time I'm there, or their newly opening location on Rainbow, I'll pay it forward and buy something for someone.
     Which brings me to price. The macaroons are a dollar something. That's about average, though they are a bit smaller than one usually finds. The pastries are generally $4-5, which, in a time of $6 lattes is actually not bad.

2597765,2011-08-20,0,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"Now that macarons are all the rage, I thought I'd check out the macarons scene while in Vegas. Bouchon Bakery was the obvious place, but thanks to my Yelp app I also found Patisserie Manon tucked away in a strip mall.

There's much to like about this bakery: a huge assortment of classic French goodies, a section to sit down and eat savory items, and the flavor of the macarons. But the overall ambience of this bakery cafe is so stark that it doesn't have that cozy French feel that would make me want to return and hang out.

Other reviewers had raved about the $1 macarons, so I thought, What a deal! Disappointingly enough, these macarons are also much smaller than at, say, Paulette's (Chantal G.). Think between quarter and half-dollar-sized. The texture of the macarons was perfect though: crisp shell and tender interior with good buttercream fillings. But the color choices put me off. I want my raspberry macaron to be light red or pink, not an odd adobe red color. Why was the vanilla macaron baby blue? Sure, if I close my eyes, the taste is great--but eating involves all the senses, and I make my food choices by sight.

The croissants were quite good--very flaky and buttery. Our half-baguette-long sandwiches (ham and Swiss cheese for me) were even bigger than anticipated and enough for two to share, at $8-something. And I was impressed that they had house-made pates for sale.

We also ordered coffees to go, and again the amenities dulled the experience. When we asked for sugar and cream, not seeing the customary station, we were directed to packets of sugar and half-and-half type individual creamers on the tables, which is where we also picked up our napkins--industrial style paper towels. :(

Go for the food, but get it to go unless you don't care about a cozy atmosphere. The food is close to 4 stars, but the ambience is a 2.",BI43zsVnKZHtMI_4GBStng,1,1,3,oXPjl10QfB6l-QGOJplwNw

2639387,2012-06-07,7,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"A few years ago on my birthday, my family for some strange, bizarre reason forgot about getting a birthday cake for me. Soooo on the night of my birthday, they all realized nobody bought one for me. OUCH... major ouch indeed. To play it off, my Father previously bought a loaf of chestnut bread and stuck a candle in it and yes.. That was my birthday cake. My Father goes.. What?!!?? What's wrong with this.. It's good.. something different this year. I go.. yeah right that's Not a birthday cake, it's a loaf of bread. You guys forgot about my birthday cake?!??!! They couldn't even look at me.. I gave my Family the look of ""how could you?!"" After that experience, it's a tradition now that I get my own cake and everybody is happy! :)

That being said, a fellow yelper, Leos L. raved about this new French Bakery Pastry Bistro. So the curious georgette that I am, I looked up this place on Yelp and read the reviews on what's good here. One picture struck my interest of this marvelous, playful looking cake. I was sold in my birthday cake hunt. Nestled in the back of Roy's Restaurant on  W. Charleston Blvd. you'll find where this hidden treasure is located. This place is more than just sweets, they also serve lunch and chocolate candies too! 

The cake of choice is called The Fraisier. And what a cake it is... Consisting of fresh whipped cream and sliced strawberries as the filling... stacked up taller than the usual birthday cakes, this beauty came with colorful, glowing purple and red macarons with ginormous strawberries side by side each other and toasted sliced almonds all over the top of the cake! All around the sides even had sliced strawberries as part of the crust. Looked quite artsy and creative! Just looking at this cake, it reminds me of Disneyland. Makes you feel so darn good inside, maybe a little giddy perhaps, but it's one of those sights you see that just brightens you up and brings excitement in your eyes. After staring at this cake, my first bite made my taste buds Scream for joy!!! The richness in taste wasn't so empowering, but very much so inviting. Everything just melts in your mouth and the fresh whipped cream with sliced strawberries literally made such an impact, I didn't speak a word until I finished my delicious slice of heaven. Savor the moment?!! I savored each bite! So fresh and moist, this was seriously a luscious cake. They wrote Happy Birthday Suki on a separate.. what looks like the same texture as a macaron bun. Everything almost looked 3-D-ish.

It was also my first time being introduced to macarons!!! I'm familiar with macaroons with the sweetened, shredded coconuts, but not this type of pastry. It looks like a mini tiny Tiny solid color hamburger. The buns almost having a egg shell like feel, but more delicate than that. With an airy crunch density as you first bite into it, while the inside is creamy, yet soft. The filling flavor can be practically anything you want to create. That's the fun part in trying a macaron or making it. It's made well if both buns have a ruffled skirt. I would try to describe it in another way, but that's inappropriate. Use your imagination and maybe you can figure that out :P Weighs and reminds me of a toasted marshmallow, but with tons of more pizazz!!! Great addition to put on cakes, it completely transforms it to a tantalizing playground of fun!

This is one of my favorite cakes to buy for any occasion and I'll definitely go back to try more pastries especially the Tiramisu and Camille. If you don't want the full commitment in getting a cake, try a slice of the Fraisier. It might even make you say.... Oh la la! Bon Appetit :D",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,7,7,5,Q2Cx7ouFLMz8ncOJhkaHeA
2640811,2012-01-16,2,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"My daughter and I ended up in this shopping center since we got her first haircut two doors down. I knew I just had to come here after reading the review my girl Nik O. had just left for it. I came in feeling a little intimidated since I'm not a French foodie and I didn't know too much about French desserts but the helpful (and dare I say handsome) French man (and possibly owner?) was happy to answer my 30 questions about every type of pastry and bag them all up for me. When I inquired about the macaroons, he asked if I've ever had one, and when I said no, he happily handed me a chocolate one to try. 

The standouts from my order included the layered cake with fresh strawberries and almonds as well as the flan. My kids like sweets, but often more along the candy spectrum because they're kids. I have never seen them fight over a piece of cake as much as the one with strawberries, (hey, at least they're eating fruit) I thought Fight Club 2 was going to break out in my dining room. The flan is like the Mexican flan I'm used to, but inside of a pastry crust so it's smooth but also has a great crunchy texture. It was also bigger than a slice of pizza for under $5 (I think) and may have ruined all other flan for us. 

While going to the after Christmas sales, I told my husband I wanted to go to French Connection and he retorted I want French flan. Patisserie Manon, we will be back.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,0,5,GHXgiZIkjH7mjv6ddxv7zQ

There were lots of choices of quiche, one of my favorite lunches.. I went with the spinach & goat cheese. I also asked for a cup of split pea soup. 
The quiche was light and fluffy, and great taste of spinach. As for the goat cheese, instead of mixed in there was just a large piece on top. 
As for the split pea, I guess they have never heard the expression ""Thick as pea soup""
It was a thin broth with tiny bits of ham.

This place is open Tuesdays-Sundays (which I feel most restos should do!) from 7am til dinnertime, how many bakeries do that?  It greets you with a long display of colorful pastries and savory goodies you can't help but feel all fuzzy inside.  

It's the first time we went on a weekend, post lunch-rush (1pm) and still the place was PACKED.  As I was placing my order a lady was complaining about her quiche taking 20mins long, so in anticipation of the wait, we decided to start off with dessert :).  

Unfortunately, they had just run out of Chocolate Truffle and Frazier Cake, so hubby decides to go for Black Forrest (Forest Noir) (he likey, I never cared for it) and I, the Opera Cake... coffee-liquor-soaked cake layers in between ganache and pastry cream.  YUMMO!  Every time I go here I want to order everything. 

Our lunch arrives. Service is awesome. The lasagna looks fabulous, but somehow misses the mark.  To me, it lacks meat, meaty flavor and seasoning.  There were also noodles that were hard or crunchy either from lack of cooking or too much broiling. (I wonder if the bowl vessel affected its cooking evenly).  

But the PORK CASSOULET oh my lordy!!!  It was love at first bite.  Pork a-whut-ah?  That's just fancy for casserole or stew, and this had pork shoulder, sausage and beans.  It was hankering on the salty side, but eaten with the bread and beans it was divine.  The sauce was rich but not heavy and the pork was so tender and comforting.  I could not stop eating it!

2772069,2011-08-28,1,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"Since the last review, I have discovered vanilla macaroons. Never thought they would be colored blue and never thought to ask for them. I assumed since I did not see the pale white yumminess that is vanilla, they were always out every time I went (I usually get there late in the afternoon.) Now it is a half dozen every single visit. They are light and creamy but at the same time have a delicate crunch. I'm salivating thinking about them.

Also, I never did update about the brioche and apple chaussons. The brioche was pretty standard for a French bakery. The apple chaussons are excellent. These are also a must buy every visit. The pastry is firm, buttery and glazed with a perfect sugar crust. The apples are not too sweet and have a pleasant texture. Not cooked down too much but not too firm either. 

My mom liked the chocolate eclair I got for her, but she said it was a bit too sweet. Since then I have also gotten her a strawberry tart which she said was fabulous, but I think the winner was the apple tart. Upon tasting it, she said, ""Anytime you go back you can get me another one of these."" I got a blueberry tart for my bf (which he shared) and I have to say it was delightful. The fruit was soft but not squishy and the pastry was buttery and flaky with not a single bit of sogginess.

Now I love chocolate, but the chocolate truffle cake is definitely for chocolate fanatics or very patient people who can stand to eat something a couple bites at a time. It was very rich, very chocolaty and very hard to finish. The Black Forest was far tastier in my opinion. Just the right amount of chocolate and a nice cherry flavor. However, the fraiser cake is still my favorite.

Still haven't tried any of the savory selections except for the quiche. I will have to remedy that soon as the ham and cheese croissant in one of the other Yelpers pictures keeps beckoning to me.",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,1,1,5,ZhK0Hk2OEqvchOqBGrRNkg

Don't get me wrong, the texture of the minis are completely awesome.  But I don't really care for candied anything, and the little bit of flavor in the middle just kinda goes bleh to me.  However, in the heart of trying it, I did try a few of their flavors and thought the pistachio was pretty great.

It could have been the day and time that I arrived, but I didn't see anything like Mille-feuille (Napoleons), even though that's one of the favorites when it comes to French delicacies.  Might have sold out at that point.

I also was amazed at the size.  The eating area stretched all the way back and was very spacious.

Definitely, next time, I need to partake in the not-so-sweet, and work on those sandwiches.  I know at some point, I'll catch one of those mille-feuille in the wild... and then... look out! nom nom nom nom nom....",cviyGIyg_hAa8_BZ9FIFRw,1,0,5,mJ-wQF-qIZh8spMb1NeiHw

The way they make macarons are so unique as they are presented in a cute, chubby, and colorful manner. Each of them are $1.10 a piece which is EXTREMELY rare with macarons! A box of 10 were only about $11.00 for me!

It was the tiramisu cake - and was a little disappointed that the cake to cream ratio was off.  Too much cream - we threw away most of it since it was mostly cream and shaved chocolate. The flavor was delicate but would not order it again.  I happened to notice they had fresh baked bread when I picked up the cake - and THAT was outstanding!  LOVE the bread - what a total win by accident for my group.  Coming from the NYC city area and used to high priced items - I was surprised at the price of macarons - 1.50+$ each and the size of a quarter.  I decided not to try one out of principle alone.  They are too far out of the way to get that kind of money for such a tiny pastry.  Overall very pricey in my opinion.,5lO9haepG2kQuJKdFgqGXA,1,0,3,JUs_ah86YdIImHELJF2ahw

I only got macarons, but the pear tart was looking mighty fine.

About their macarons - they were just a DOLLAR each when I went last year - looks like the price has gone up a bit. They are NOT the best macarons ever, far from it actually - but they are just a dollar, so what can I say? 

Rose - Weird tasting. Avoid.
Lavender - Better than Rose, slightly fruity.
Raspberry - Overly sugary. Weak flavor.
Salted Caramel - Easily the best of their macarons. I'd definitely get this again.
Pistachio - Overly sugary again. Flavor was ok.

And there were probably more, but only the salted caramel was memorable at all in my opinion. 

Just a note, but don't go here on rainy days. I went on a rainy day, and unfortunately, humidity matters a lot when making macarons, so almost all of mine were lacking the crisp texture and slightly crunch  you expect from a fine mac (I don't think this bakery has proper conditioning).

Coming here hit the stress eating on the head yesterday.  A much needed splurge :-P. Was gonna have dessert first for dinner, then quiche for dessert.  It's okay if you do that too.  I'll like you more ; )

Salmon and mushroom quiche: served hot with a tiny side salad. Salmon and mushroom had their own flavor.  Outside crust was just right crispy.  Center part was okay maybe soggy if I compare to other quiche I've eaten elsewhere.  Possibly due to quiches being premade.  Overall it wasn't over salted.  It was good - I finished it.

Grilled chicken pesto panini: added brie cheese.  Made this panini super flavorful it beat the taste test of the quiche.  Plus it came with spinach soup.  Sip the soup alone or try dipping the panini in it; either way is perfect.  Also served with a tiny salad.

Dessert bakery section is where restaurant entrance opens to, with a separate section at the back for meal type food.  Drip coffee is served at the front; fancy latte type espresso is prepared at the back.  Tabs for the meals can be combined with dessert purchases- not necessary to pay separately.

Selections are plentiful.  Everything in the dessert area is eye catching, colorful, beautifully decorated, slurpalicious worthy.  Definitely a place to trigger a diabetic reaction (for those just be careful and conscious).  Everything offered so far in the meal section is appetizing; you might want everything if you're starving.

They have a variety of flavors such as Chocolate, Chocolate mint, Lemon, Blueberry, Pistachio (my fav), Raspberry,  Ginger, and a few others that I can't name at the moment. The macaroons are nice and moist with a small crunch and boy is it a burst of flavor in your mouth. I had to go back again and my parents loved it and they're not into sweets as much as I am ! Oh and they accept credit cards so that's always good. The staff seemed nice but she looked like she didn't want to be there.

  Had a tuna pan bagnat, which was not exactly like the one you get in the south of France, which has chunks of tuna, green beans, potatoes etc., in oil on a crusty round bread, but the roll was round and delicious, and the tuna salad was really good, albeit American style, and did include sliced boiled eggs and tomatoes as a sort-of salute to Nicoise. The ham and cheese on their really good croissant was also tasty- best thing hands down was the Croque Madame- crispy, creamy, cheesy, salty, literally good to the last bite. It was also basically self-serve, but the counter people were helpful, friendly and prompt.

  Now to dessert. Were we just not hungry enough? We scoped the case on the way in and didn't know how we would ever narrow our choices. The pastries on display were both huge and beautiful. We finally settled on the lemon flan,strawberry tart, and mille-feuille.  They were huge and beautiful. Too bad they didn't taste better. Of the three, the mille-feuille was the best. It was layers of light, crispy pastry with whipped cream filling and strawberries. Sounds great. Looked great. The lady at the counter said it traditionally comes with a chocolate coating. Put it back. It needs the flavor. The tart was OK- crust was nice and it's hard to mess up strawberries, but the layer of pastry cream was just yucky. Same as the lemon flan. It was a huge portion, but we were expecting something smooth, light and creamy, like Mexican flan. It was heavy, chalky, and grainy. Even our resident human garbage disposal couldn't finish it. Or didn't want to. Who knew Mexicans were superior to the French as pastry chefs? 

To add insult to injury,my niece reported that the counterperson at the bakery was less than gracious; Ok, rude. Not to be deterred, we decided to order a few things to go, so I was prepped to be nasty right back, but she decided to behave with me and no blood was shed.

 We had a lot better luck with the product, too. Salted caramel macarons were so tasty, as was the crispy coconut macaroon,and  the croissants (plain and almond). Will definitely go back, but will approach the pastry counter with caution.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,2,4,fnFUl5_bBjL--UQlwFIWgQ

The lemon tastes like lemon. The strawberry tastes like strawberry. The schn...well, you get the point. Whenever I've tried macarons I've always been slightly dissatisfied because the flavors are subtle. I've never traveled to France and eaten a real French macaron before, so I'm unsure if the flavors are supposed to be light, but if I buy one that claims its raspberry flavored, well, it better taste like a raspberry.

GETTIN' MY MAC ON
I purchased 10 macarons, two of each of the following: cherry, raspberry, caramel sea salt, strawberry, and lemon. The cherry, strawberry, and the lemon are my favorites and the most flavorful. The raspberry and the caramel sea salt had lighter flavors, and I was expecting the caramel to be saltier. Just a bit more salt would've created a pleasant sweet and salty flavor. 

OVERALL
$1 a macaron beats paying over $3.00 for one at Bouchon. There are also plenty of flavors.

So I came here wanting some macaroons and a nice cup of coffee. I arrived late in the day so I wasn't completely surprised that they were out of a lot of breads and such. No biggie since it wasn't what I came for. There were several macaroons to choose from but not the vast variety I would have expected. Also, they didnt put any care into arranging them. It's a french bakery, that's how the french do it. *sigh*
You order your macaroons in the front and bring them to the back to order your coffee. It would have been nice since I was eating inside to put them on a plate. Instead, they put them in a wax paper bag. *sigh* I gotta say, it's the little things that places do that really set them apart from others. This place certainly wants to blend in, not stand out. The have cute ""murials"" on the wall and that was a nice touch. 
So, I go to the back and order my coffee, a small french roast. The cream and sugar are on the tables so you can make your coffee how you like it. As I scanned the tables, I noticed that most of them were dirty. It wasn't busy, so someone could have wiped down the tables and cleared the dirty dishes from previous diners. I didn't like sitting down to a table with crumbs everywhere. Gross.
I was talking to a friend prior to going and she said that the fruit macaroons were better than the others (peanut butter, chocolate, etc). So I took her advice, for the most part, and only got 2. A strawberry one and a mint chocolate one. The strawberry one was nice. Nice flavor, nice texture. A OK to me. The mint chocolate one was crumbly and lame. Crumbly? A macaroon, crumbly? WTF? 
I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that on a Saturday morning, when all their products are out, that this place is better. My experience yesterday was definitely 2 star, but I'm hopeful it down to the time I came in. Had it been cleaner, and more stocked, I feel a 3 star would be more appropriate. 
Pro for the macaroons only being $1. And a nice size small coffee being $1.75!!! In a town that loves ripping people off, I was happy about this.

That saved me time and probably quite a few trips up and down Charleston to find this gem of a shop.

When you walk in you'll probably be sucked in by their display of sweet treats. Yeah, they all look delicious. But once you get past that, you'll see a counter and display of some of their savory options. I opted for a simple ham and swiss on a baguette (about 7 bucks). It's made to order and is quite large -- at least a foot if not more. For the price and size, I think it's a good lunch time bargain. The only negative is that the bread was a little too hard for my tastes. Instead of it being crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it was just hard all around.

On my way out I just couldn't resist the macarons ($1 each). My mind was saying no, but my stomach was saying, ""hell yes!"" I figured a little treat couldn't hurt so I got six of them (pistachio, chocolate, lemon, chocolate mint, blueberry, vanilla). All were delicious with a light and crunchy shell and soft, creamy center. But, the standouts were the pistachio and chocolate mint.

I'll be back to try more of their savory dishes, but I'm sure I'll walk out with a few more macarons or pastries as well.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,5,4,GlywvnaF7t4R39HNwXWqpw

The rise on the macaroon was too high and you can tell they used more flour than almond flour.

I come here for a pick me up.  I come here for celebration treats.  I come here for that taste of Europe I miss so much.  If you've ever visited or lived in a European city, you may understand my love for the smell of fresh bread when entering a store.  This place has it!!!

I used to come just for the macarons.  They're a bit more edgy in attitude compared to the classic and elegant shape we all know of.  Also, they look so great bunched together and boxed up for gifts.  Best of all, the taste and texture is perfect - just like the rest of the pastries they offer.

Now, I come for the dough.  I pick up fresh bread in the mornings and could not be happier with the similar taste of my former home abroad.  Don't forget about the croissants!  Whenever I have visitors in town, I pick up both chocolate and almond croissants for breakfast or tea/coffee time.  The plain is great too, but the almond is one not to leave behind - trust me.  

Cakes.  I am so impressed with the price point for these cakes, considering their light and smooth satisfying taste as well as beautiful presentation.  If you're not looking for a cake-based celebration cake, and more of a mousse or something fruity... these are just right!  The tiramisu one is pretty delightful too.  They even have some available for you to just pick up and add a chocolate happy birthday sign if you're looking for something last minute.

Clearly, I love this place, and I'm sure you will too.

I have been a big fan of Rachel and Jean-Paul since day 1....(one of the first 5 Yelp reviews, only three workers plus the owners, and I remember the bistro area still under construction!) Fast forward a  few years later, and they've become a favorite local hotspot, and the staff has been beefed up, especially for the mornings. 

Originally, our plan was to grab our usual favorites-Tart Tropizienne and Salted Caramel Macarons, but as I made my way toward the Bistro section, we decided to stay for a bite to eat. I spied some Escargot and also a nice slab of Foie Gras, but it was a little too early in the morning, so that's another excuse to return. We shared a small Hachis Parmentier, which is Manon's version of Shepard's Pie, a Croque Madame, and a cup of Zucchini-Cream Cheese Soup as suggested by our waiter.

 Sounded like a wierd combination, but the soup was actually quite good.
The Parmentier was also very well seasoned and flavorful without being very greasy, but our favorite was the Croque Madame. Just enough ham, cheese, and bechamel between each layer of crusty batard slices, one of many types of breads baked daily by Jean-Paul and not out of a bag, top that bad boy, or shall I say girl(with the addition of the egg, this dish becomes feminine....no comment....ask the French!) with an egg and you got yourself a French style breakfast of champions!

On our way out, we grabbed some Salted Caramel Macarons, and a nice crusty baguette to enjoy at home with some queso and vino....ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,6,7,4,asmRbkjiBMQMl3tTr71Bug
3602307,2017-12-19,6,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"""Meh, I've experienced better"" is the right take on this place. Yes, it's true that they have a plethora of tasty pastries. But it is presented in a way that is not supremely appetizing or accessible. And they have ILL-TEMPERED employees. They had some muffins wrapped in plastic, which were covered with plastic on the counter near the register. I went to uncover the plastic OVER the plastic, and was sharply remonstrated with by a little hood rat who worked there--""Don't touch!"" But how can I tell what the muffin even is, or if it is fresh without getting a better look at it? She retorted, ""It's FRESH!"" Like I should take her word for it rather than my own eyes. I am sure it was fresh. The issue is that you can be polite about it. Instead of helping the situation, the more experienced employee (""Becky,"") kind of confirmed the bad behavior saying, ""Well, we have to be careful because we have the Health Department breathing down our necks.""

My gosh, why is that?

Here's how this exchange should have gone:

Me: (Removing the plastic over the plastic-covered muffin by the cash register).

Employee 1: Oh, excuse me, unfortunately, we cannot allow you to take a look under the plastic, but I'd be happy to show it to you, if you'd like.  Do you have any questions about our products?

Me: Oh sure, I was wondering what kind of muffin that is, and if it is baked today?

Employee 1 (could have said): Oh, yes! We made the muffin today, and it is chocolate.

Employee 2 (could have said): Oh, definitely ma'am.  We are very proud of our baked goods which are always made fresh...[or something like this--NOT ""WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE HEALTH DEPT""  Who says that???]

I came in to order a Buche de Noel (a Yule log cake) for approximately $50. They lost my business. I did purchase a small pastry, a chocolate and almond filled croissant in order to do a review of the food. It was nice. Not unbelievable, mind you. But very nice.

Still, NOT nice enough to put up with the impudence of one guttersnipe and a clueless accomplice.

If you want DELICIOUS, in-house baked French food (including fresh bread and pastries), check out ""BAGUETTE CAFE."" See their reviews here on Yelp.  It's 5 STARS******all the way! I have been going there for the last 6 years. They never chastise you for inquiring about anything, nor for touching anything that they have left out on a counter. (Which they don't do in the first place...if you're worried about the Health Dept, then you keep the food behind a glass, as with all such shops).  Even if you did mistakenly do something, they would not jump all over you like you were a leper who had the plague. 

It's funny. I lived in France and never had an issue with French people. But these people work in a French shop and have more of a snobby ""French"" attitude than the French stereotype! C'est la vie!",NrpzAH3EoNhWUR8OysUhBQ,3,1,2,VIR63IhiIFlV4aiTDYYoNQ

I would easily pay more for these pastries. I plan to go back for lunch or dinner one day soon and try their quiche. 

The only negative is I do wish they came in bakery boxes rather then styrofoam containers. The lack of presentation would deter me from bringing these pastries to someone's home",rTydTPQKKXoysaVPC0CLxw,2,2,4,4aej9xn1CDmE6gtK5-QQvg

Okay, honestly I don't remember that far back to my first experience in a candy story but I imagine it was a lot like when I first walked into Patisserie Manon. 

They are smart cookies I tell you, they place all their sweets by the door so that you're more likely to not skip out on dessert. Eclairs, to creme brulees, to their famous strawberry cake and Black Forest cake, to my most favorite part.. THEIR MACAROONS. Seriously the BEST macaroons I have tasted! Perfect amount of crisp 'poof' to the outside shells and just amount of creamy center, with a variety of flavors to choose from -- favorites are salted caramel and butter salted caramel. They sell them at $1 each and allow you to sample one flavor for free. I've also purchased their strawberry cake from them and definitely something I'll be getting for any upcoming birthdays, including my own. I have yet to try their Black Forest and white chocolate Black Forest since I've been told is another top seller. 

I've also dined in for lunch, but their food selection didn't excite me as much as the bakery and pastries part of the restaurant did. I went with the creamy spinach soup and it was just OK.

Every time I come, I try something different because every dish is just begging for it.  The past two trips I've tried the turkey and cheese croissant and the bacon onion pizza and they were both amazing!  Before hand they might have been too hot or too cold but now they seem to have the heating time at the just the right amount.  The cheese is all nice and gooey without burning my tongue!  Of course these aren't the reason anyone should come down here though. . .

Of course that was a lead in to the pastries!  Those wonderful wonderful pastries!  I also have to try something different everytime!  The eclairs, the fruit tarts, and of course the macaroons are all great here.  Heck, I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to even try a macaroon.  At 1 dollar they aren't cheap, but it's always worth to try one with your order.  So far Cherry and Peanut Butter are my faves!  My overall favorite pastry so far though has to be the Paris Brest!  Aside from the all the jokes you can make with the name (I'm immature I know) the way the creme and the bread taste together is amazing.

Welp, my roomie and I were off of work one day and decided to drive alllllllllllllllllllllllll the way there as I've never had them before.

Since we had come after working out, he suggested we eat breakfast before the macaroons. (Crazy idea, right?!)

He got the breakfast with over easy eggs, bacon, and a croissant.
I got a baguette sandwich with turkey, pickles, and brie. AND escargot. Yep, I felt a little adventurous at 11am.
Another friend of mines got and egg white omelette with bacon, onions, and swiss cheese.

Roomies croissant was delicious. I've never had something that buttery yet, flaky. Went DELICIOUSLY with the bacon and egg put in there. That runny yoke was to-die-for.

My sandwich was ok. I mean, I loved the brie (main reason I ordered it) and pickles but, not so much on the turkey. More so just because I don't like turkey.... Leave it to me to order a turkey sandwich based on the cheese in it! LOL
My escargot was pesto-y, garlic-y, and olive oil-y HEAVEN!!!!!!!!! I've only had escargot (snails) the Filipino way when it's either in soups or steamed (I think); and this was sooooo much more better than that! I could've just ate the sauce and bread allll day.

My other friend's egg white omelette was amazing. I don't normally like egg white omelettes but the bacon was so....idk, it just tasted different...more savory??!! Everything just went so well.
I'd love to have my own egg white omelette next time.

Let me elaborate...  I get my hair done 2 doors down and had been running non stop all day until about 3pn right before my appointment .   Blood sugar was getting low and I had to go for groceries after hair and had 5 minutes.   The food in back was sll to much to eat and too slow    I opted for bakery and selected a lemon tart which was also too much.   I only needed a couple bites of something to hold me over do I asked the blonde woman with shortish hide is she could cut it in quarters   '""NO"".  No explanation just no.   When I explained I was going to be sitting in a salon chair for a couple hours and only and cracked a joke about temptation of editing the whole thing if I could just take one piece and put the red away I was faced with a condescending ""maybe you should try some self control""

Let's forget for a minute this person sells Food and self control is the enemy of her business ...   She just insulted me because I like to eat and it shows.    Of course she had no way of knowing I've lost well over 100lbs Nd work like a dog to lose weight and have a very little treat now and then....   But really?  

It was one if those situations where the best response popped into my head after I left.

If I had it to do again I will say "" you know, you are right"".  And hit the door

In recounting this story to several other people who have visited this business the first question was ""what did she look like?""   Follow by  ""oh that's the owner.   She!'s awful.    I don't go there any more""

I had lots of difficult request but they made it happened. I got to pay for the cake through the phone and had the cake write 'Joyeux Anniversaire' rather the usual 'Happy Birthday'.

What I REALLY loved was the price of their macarons, $1.10 each! When I was still staying in Cali, macarons were like $2+ and sometimes tasted like cardboard. Not this place though. They are cheap and delicious. The texture was perfect - slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and moist when you bite into it. Delicious. My friend also ordered a croissant and I have never any croissant prepared like how they do. It reminded me of a savory crepe. That too, was delicious. 

The only thing I wish was that there was one by my side of town :( Definitely coming back here.",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,0,0,5,ol7SQOuPqDUvbJ8KWmf7ZQ
3783773,2013-02-03,0,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,My much anticipated trip to this bakery ended with total disappointment. Based on the yelp reviews I thought this place would be a frequent place to enjoy good pastry. I was very deceived by the crowded store and wide array of items. How could all these people have such bad pallettes? I should have walked away after the girl behind the counter had such a big attitude as if I was bothering her. I wasn't even taking a long time to order. She obviously has her bun on her head too tight and it is causing rude behavior. Ugh!  Guess I am glad that the pastries suck because based on the service alone I wouldn't come back. Ok now on to the food. The macaroons taste of pure sugar no flavor just sweet. The almond danish was so hard I could have cracked a tooth. The peanut butter chocolate cake was very moist but again no flavor. I've had better tasting cake from Costco. I got a few other items and didn't even try them. Not worth the calories or disappointment. Thank goodness Chef Flemming's was still open for some redemption from this debacle.,ehwJcmxImGT80py4D2eJsg,3,0,1,V4Y3wHcdMXwn8rRvmhpRDA
3790289,2016-12-30,0,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"The cakes here are super delicious! I would have given this place a 5 star however I came across problems. I came to this place twice for the panache(?) but each time it didn't have it. So the last time I came I figured I'm here anyways so I might as well try a few new things. So anyways , on this last visit this is what I found....

1- if you order the macaroons, do not eat it right away. as soon as I got in my car I took a bite out of one and it tasted like ""refrigerator"". I'm guessing from it being too close from the vent in the showcase of the store. When I ate it about 24 hrs later, the refrigerator taste was gone. Which made it ok.  
2- the girls in the bakery are friendly however the girl with the dreads made a comment to me to buy her one aswell (I'm assuming because I spent $60 on this one transaction) .. girl, your making this customer feel uncomfortable. You work here so go feed yourself a slice of cake on ur break. Whether it be a joke or not, you have a job , go buy your own... 
3- the girl with the green hair.. I saw her put on gloves to pick up the fallen macaroons in the display showcase. She took off the gloves and I guess missed one macaroon so I guess she was lazy to put a new pair on and I saw her grab it with her bare hands and place it back on top of the other macaroons in the showcase. Kind of nasty.

Cleanliness are this bakery isn't so great and the customer service is a little too friendly? I guess u can say. The cakes here are super delicious and regardless of me seeing an employee touching the food with their bare hands, maybe I'll come back again? Not so sure. But hopefully management reads this and betters their associates.",XkcOIRETlMCmEV7SUtwACw,0,0,3,yVCQitSDLOG3iCf9cQnOiA

The fruit tarts were also very delicious as the fruit tasted sweet (and not preserved). The tart bottom was sooo sweet as well. The eclairs and custard were not my favorite as they were not as flavorful as I expected them to be. Maybe that is the French way to make them, I am not sure and I probably prefer things on the sweeter side.

I typically bought mine at SambaLatte and went for the almond, but Patisserie Manon's are not only more than double the size, but are lower in price and way more tasty! While they didn't have almond, they had pistachio which blew Samba's almond out of the water. The almond flour used really came through and I felt like it was a perfect blend.

Then, I ventured to the back of the shop... oh, no!  There is a separate cash register for the savory goods: soups, sandwiches, lasagna, French Hot Dog, croissants, and QUICHE!

If your not a native (like me), getting to this place is a journey but with rich rewards at the end. It's way off the strip, but that's OK because like I said, I will travel for food.

So I came here for macarons and if you've had the one's from the places on the strip, then you know this place is way better than those. Although I do like JP, but this place makes the everyday, so they're fresh and not in a package box and certainly don't cost $16 for 8!

The macarons here are $1 and they have 12 different kinds!! If you're looking for macarons come here because even though they look 'small', believe me 2-3 will fill you up! I got 6 flavors and let me tell you, had I known they were that good, I would have gotten 1 of each :o

I visited here with my boyfriend's family for Mother's Day. As soon as I walked in, I was taken aback by the beautiful array of desserts. So many to choose from, and they were gorgeous! After making my way through to the back, we ordered breakfast platters and omelets (which is served all day long, don't let the blackboard fool you!).  Personally, their breakfast menu is very similar to a breakfast platter with eggs and meat and a side of toast at any other restaurant that serves breakfast. However, I do have to say that their croissant is freshly baked and yummy AND their bacon is pretty damn good, too. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to explore the rest of their large variety of other food options so I'll have to go back.

I must say that the only reason for this 4 star review is because we had to wait a long while in order for everyone to even receive the drinks. My party also received our orders in different times so there was a small chaos brewing in the beginning of our breakfast. 

The desserts on the other hand was AMAZING. I had the salted caramel and vanilla macarons and they were delicious! I ended up buying one of each flavor for my best friend to try and she loved them all. I also had the profiteroles and they were by far the best I've tasted. It was filled with custard and topped with chocolate and whipped cream. I'll be going back every week to pick up one of those for me. :) Other people in my party had more fruity pastries and they did mention that they had too much fruit in them but I think it may be the French or Manon style of baking so... to each his own.

We usually utilize their bakery section. Patisserie Manon has an impressive selection of pastries, breads, cookies, and cakes. Their macarons are not the prettiest, but after you have one you won't care how they look when posted to social media, because they're delicious. These are some of the best tasting macarons that I've had in the city. The flavors are not crazy or too fancy, but they have a bunch of really delicious flavors. It would be fun for return customers if they tried new flavors every once in a while, but they seem to be doing what they know how to do very well.

My husband and I have tried a wide variety of their baked goods: tarts, flan, macarons, croissants, cake, etc. We have yet to be disappointed. The baked goods are on the pricier side, but they are really delicious.

We've also tried their little cafe in the back. Their sandwiches are also pricier (and you're not going to get ridiculous portion sizes) but are seriously good. Their coffee is not bad!

The only downside to this place is that the decor inside seems kind of weird and disjointed, it doesn't have the greatest atmosphere. There are lots of coolers near the eating area for the bakery and there can be a lot of white noise.

I ordered the spinach soup and tuna Niçoise salad. The tuna was delightful and the salad was hearty. If I was more hungry, I would have definitely gone for the croque Monsieur or croque Madame. 

 Upon finishing up, we could not deny ourselves French sweets to take home. I was instantly drawn to the macaroon display. For $1 a piece, I ordered chocolate, peanut butter, salted caramel and coffee. All were extremely delicious. I noticed a few patrons eating very large portions of cake that looked extremely delicious.

My continued mission to find the best French macarons in Las Vegas!
This place has better macarons then Payard in the Ceasa'r's palace and they are only $1.00 a piece!  Better than the $30 my boyfriend had to pay for a box of 12 at Payard! Ha!

One star = For not just being a bakery.  They have a a wide variety of desserts, cakes, macarons, pastries, quiches, breads, and even chocolate.  They have FIFTEEN French macaron flavors; FIFTEEN!

2 stars = They also have a large eating area inside, and a small one outside.  So it is definitely a place to hang out, have some french dessert, and talk with friends over a nice cup of coffee.

3 stars = For their vanilla macarons.

4 stars= For their peanut butter macarons.

The 2 flavors listed above are my favorite.  My friends like the Rasberry one; which I like too, but not my fave.  Do NOT eat the chocolate mint!  It tastes like chocolate and toothpaste put together.  Yuck!  The chocolate pistachio one is pretty good.  The coffee one is too sweet, not enought bitter sweet to it like I would prefer.  The blueberry one is pretty cakey.  I'm all about texture when it comes to macarons.  I like the chewy, fudgy, light crisp, and brownie type textures.

Lacks the 5th star due to the wierd smell when you walk in.  It doesn't smell nice in there like a regular bakery.  Makes you wonder if anything tastes good.  Luckily it does!  If you love French macarons, you MUST go this bakery!  It's awesome!",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,1,0,4,mPOLu9dKpLWy47pa2rK2Vw

I had been dying to try this place out and finally got a chance to on a Sunday afternoon.  They get 5-stars for quality and taste of the pastries but I had to only give them four for lack of friendly service and lack of signage once inside the bakery-which is ironic since they hired a guy just to get you in!  Maybe by the time you read this review, they will have made a few improvements.

You walk in you'll see one counter with pastries and cookies and some tables but  I wasn't sure if someone seats you, or if you can just sit wherever? 
 
Then towards the back, there's another counter (savory treats are here...sandwiches, soups, etc.) with another cash register, but you can't see the counter as you walk in. You have to walk all the way to the back while asking yourself, ""can I go back here""?  Where's the sign? Can I sit anywhere?  etc. so very confusing for the customer. People just cut in line too, so if you're trying to read the menu, they just get right in front of you so stand next to the counter so they can't get passed you, regulars have radar for rookies.

The array of pastries seemed limited but it was late in the day so I'm sure they had already sold many? Macaroons looked homemade-not like they were made at a factory and they were so delightful just a rainbow of colors. 

The cakes in the fridge are absolutely gorgeous!! I've never seen a cake like it before, decorated with gorgeous macaroons and strawberries, my hubby was nice enough to buy me one of these cakes for my birthday and -OMG DELICIOUS & BEAUTIFUL!

Where to start? When you walk in all you see is cake and pastries and you have to resist ordering one of everything. I had to stay the path of eating actual food first and not just sugar(although I do love sugar as a food group). My friend and I walked to the back to where the ""real food"" counter was to order breakfast. Note: there are two counters. One for sweets and bakery stuff up front and then the food counter in the back. 

All of the yummy looking food is displayed in glass cases and there are chalkboards with specials and the menu above the counter area. I felt a bit overwhelmed with delight and finally decided on a turkey and cheese croissant and a cappuccino. My friend ordered the french onion soup(yes, this can be a breakfast food), a mushroom and cheese quiche, and a coffee. The counter woman was nice and quickly rang us up and gave us a number for our table.

Coffees were out quick, followed shortly by the food. Everything was really good. Croissant with turkey and cheese....so good! Buttery, savory, cheesy, crusty. It's everything you want in your mouth(yeah, yeah). It came with a side salad and I ate it. Nothing special but I ate it because I was hungry. Cappuccino was done well and I consumed it all. Love me some caffeine. I tried my friends french onion soup. Really tasty! I am such a huge french onion soup fan and this was definitely high ranking. I would order it for myself in the future. Quiche was also tasty(I was stealing my friends food. No shame). Mushrooms cooked down to be deliciously soft among the cheese, nice buttery and flakey crust. Noms!!

After we ate, it was time for my attack on the pastry counter up front. I got an apple tart to go and macaroons! Who doesn't love macaroons? If you don't, there is something wrong with you. All very tasty(I got a variety). Apple tart is being saved for later. Bakery counter woman also very helpful and nice.

Both are delicious.

It's clean and well staffed. I had one occasion when one of the employees got a little disgruntled during a macaron rush by customers which was very off putting. You can't expect the customers to know your ordering process. We aren't employees like you who are trained on the steps to help a customer. Good training in customer service would help the staff better assist the customers and have those customers want to return and purchase more product. 

Aside from that it's a lovely local place. Can't wait to try the savory food options.

That was my first thought when I first walked into Patisserie Manon for their macarons.  I remember being out on the golf course in Palm Springs a few years back.  I remember seeing a bunch of mini-birds running across the fairway.  I asked my friend, what the heck is that?  He stated, those are what you call a Road Runner. Funny, that was my first time to ever see a Road Runner in real life and never expected them to be so small.  Yes, I was one of those that thought a Road Runner was the height of an ostrich.  I guess I watched too many cartoons as a child.  

Now fast forward to my first macaron.  The only thing I ever knew about a macaron was what I've seen in pictures or what I've seen on Yelp.  I honestly expected a macaron to be the size of a burger slider.  You can now see why I thought of ""Meep Meep"" when I first walked into Patisserie Manon.  I didn't expect a macaron to be so small, like a Road Runner.

Small, but huge on taste.  These little road runners tasted so good and I don't even have a sweet tooth. Tried their Orange, Lemon, Cherry, Blueberry, Cafe, Vanilla, and Caramel.  All were good and would have to say that Caramel had to be my favorite.  These little treats are served cold and if not kept cool, will begin to break apart.  Because they are bite size and so tasty, it was easy to finish the box.  Sorry Honey, Daddy still left you a few.  You snooze, you lose litte girl!!

Service was great and the ambiance reminds me of a cafe.  But not like one of those fast paced cafes ala Starbucks, but one where you can kick it and enjoy your macaron.  The macarons have a certain bite or kick to them.  You will notice it a few seconds after your first gobble.  Their other desserts also looked good, but I didn't try them. Maybe on my next visit.  

Thanks Yelpers...you guys got me here.  You guys helped me realize that I actually have a sweet tooth.  Now looking forward for my next Road Runner, I mean Macaron. And of course, I recommend.

The macarons here run $1 a piece, and Patisserie Manon has a plethora of flavors to choose from. A very helpful employee recommended some of her personal favorites as well as the most commonly bought flavors. 

I got a pretty good assortment of flavors, my favorites were the peanut butter, salted caramel, and strawberry. I was advised to store any I didn't eat in the freezer, and sure enough a couple days later they were still chewy and moist deliciousness.

My palette is quite bad, I taste things that no one else tastes and I can't taste what everyone tastes lol, but when they say blueberry, you blueberry.

We tried four flavors of macaroons: salted caramel, pistachio, chocolate mint, and lemon.  I liked the salted caramel the best.  We also shared a chocolate croissant, which was pretty good.  My wife loved it.  I thought is was just okay, but I like rich desserts and the chocolate croissant is not meant to be rich.  They had so many other great looking pastries that we did not try: flan, cake, eclairs, etc.  The regular food items were okay, but not great.  We shared a bowl of French onion soup.  Flavor was good, but I prefer loads of cheese and they added very little.  We tasted our friend's spinach and goat cheese quiche.  I think it was under cooked because it was runny.  Perhaps I just don't know French food.  Another friend had a lamb sausage sandwich. The portions were huge.  I thought it was two sandwiches.  The smothered the sandwiches with Frend fries.  (Do the French call them French fries, or just fried potatoes?)  The sausages were tiny.  I'd guess the width of my pinky finger.

I've also tasted all 15 flavors of the macarons. My favorites are pistachio, ginger, french vanilla, and coffee flavors. I've yet tasted their savory menu like their soups and sandwiches. And I don't have much interest in the candies/chocolates they also offer, but I bet you they're also bomb. Everything I've tried all tasted so heavenly, so delicious, I could imagine Marie Antoinette eating her cake right there beside me. I would say the whole setting of the place is a bit awkward though. They need some serious feng shui to fix their flow. It's nice to see that some of their employees are actually French. It adds a nice touch of authenticity to the place.

The bakery is broken up into two areas-- a point/choose pastry/dessert area boasting eclairs, cakes, palmiers, croissants, and every French dessert you can think of.. the other area is where you can order savory meals such as quiche, croque madames, etc. The bistro is great for enjoying a cafe au lait with a fresh, crispy croissant while enjoying the day's paper. I've seen many people spend their afternoons here reading or studying. 

I came in to order two celebration cakes for work and expected to take home two frozen cakes. However, I was told I could put in an order for two fresh cakes (to be picked up about 12 hours later) that would be ready in time for the next morning. Apparently their bakers and pastry chefs come in around 2-3AM and get going on all the fresh items including cakes. I was able to come in and pick up my 2 eight inch Strawberry Truffle (custom) and black forest cakes at 8am the day after I ordered. They don't box and write on your cake until you get there so it's ready without sitting out. The greeting comes written on a piece of meringue to place on the cakes. Both cakes (to serve about 20-25 people) cost $64. They're gorgeous and they taste beautiful as well. 

My coworkers LOVE the Framboisier.. it is very light and the raspberries cut through the sweetness perfectly. We have all had our fair life experiences with Vegas cakes and they all agreed that this was the best cake they have had in their lives. The truffle was great also.. definitely more rich so a slice can last you a whole afternoon.

- chocolate: It was like a soft chocolate brownie. 
- peanut butter: I actually took a bite of this and also the chocolate at the same time they should make a peanut butter chocolate flavored macaroon. 
- vanilla: I really liked the Vanilla the buttery filling was very light almost like whip cream like very delicious not too sweet.

I was not in the mood to eat, but I am sure the place has some good food based off the quality of the macaroons. Next time I go for my treatments at the spa I am going to make a mental note not to eat and instead eat here!

Fraisier cake- strawberries, almonds, whipped cream, and white cake. My fall back fave!! I literally dream about this cake! 

Cocunut cake- yuuuuuum this cake is great it's not super sweet and has a nice light coconut flavor. 

Coffee cake- as in coffee flavored cake, not the coffee crumb cake you might think of. The coffee flavor is really good, it comes through with being bitter or too sweet for that matter. 

Tiramisu- my hubbies favorite all time dessert, a clear miss here at manon. It was rather bland and didn't have the in depth espresso flavor or exceptionally creamy mascarpone layer you look for in a delish tiramisu. Hubby ate it but will never order it again. 

Lemon cake- I thought I would love this!! I'm a lemon lover, but there was something off about the flavor of this cake. I wanna say it was almost a fake lemon flavor :( if it had been a tart lemon curd instead of the bitter fake lemon cream stuff it would have probably been awesome.

Chocolate raspberry- okay I am NOT a fan of their chocolate cake. It's no where near the perfect texture of their white cake!! It also needed more raspberries IMO.

Macarons- I've tried most of the flavors the clear stand outs are the pistachio, salted butter caramel, and ginger. The ginger one has a crystallized ginger filling that has just the right spice! 

I see a lot of reviews on here claiming the service is not great. But as many times as I've been in here I can't understand why?? I've NEVER had a problem and I've gone at almost closing time. If anything the girls always swoon over my son and daughter! One time they didn't have the salted butter caramel macaron up front so she went in the back to search for them for me, all for 5 macarons! My star deduction is for those few cakes I didn't care for. They were just not for me, they obviously sell the hell out of them so it's a question of taste for sure :)

Since I had reason to trek to Boca Park, I decided I better listen to my yelpfriends and check this patisserie out!  Little did I know that it would be hard to find, and that I would do several u-turns on Charleston until I gave up and called, then learned where to find this gem - behind Roy's in the center back from the street.

If people had more macarons, they would think French people are nicer.  Frenchies get a bad rep.  The lady helping me had moved to Vegas from Paris just 3 months prior, and her English is very good.  I saw things I would eat in one of those virtual reality machines - napoleons, croissants, tarts....and was certainly impressed with the sheer size of the place - it was huge in the back and served savory goods too!

Yet the mission was for macarons, and I could not believe the endless flavors and colors available.  Miss Parisienne seemed amused that I did not want chocolate or peanut butter, but I got lemon and vanilla for myself, and a blueberry for the boy.  I told her that my mom and grandma are also Parisienne, that I got screwed as a child and was not taught French because it is their secret language, and shared with her the names of my uncles - all very French, though they grew up in Omaha.

Needless to say, when I got to my car, I ate the lemon one, and some of me went to pastry-heaven, so I ate the vanilla one.  I traveled carefully back to the SE side so Eric could have a little taste of France too, and he definitely was pleased with the results.

I sent a picture to my Frenchie mom, and even though she could make them and definitely find them in her city, she wants me to bring some of Manon's when I visit next.

For one, the croissant is still simply the best croissant I have ever had, and if that is as good as a croissant gets then I have no reason to complain, either. This is definitely a croissant you'd want to try on its own first, to appreciate how wonderful and flaky and buttery it really is. It feels like a work of art... the croissant that haunts my dreams when I go too long without it and must subsist, reluctantly, on the doughy-hard-chewy pseudo-croissants from the groceries.

And after you've tried The Croissant On Its Own, it's also worth trying the croissant sandwiches, for a different take. They're another class, but they're so good... I always deeply appreciate a sandwich that doesn't sink miserably into the excess cheese, and the ratios they use here make such a good, basic croissant sandwich...

For two, the other pastries are still excellent, especially for the price point. It really is difficult to beat the pricing of these compared to value; they're such great pieces that could easily demand a higher price. Thank goodness they don't; the one-dollar macaron is just so appealing. I think the clear best is the salted caramel, by the way.

For three, the staff is just so personable and friendly. They have excellent in-house communication, which is critical since they have different stations for different foods, and there's a lot of dine-in and take-out distinctions. But they're all very, very good, and they take the time to give you some fun and useful information too, like recommendations, and how the patisserie closes in July for Bastille Day celebrations back home in France.

This is a really fun place to go see all the wonderful treats available. It's hard to choose, that's the biggest dilemma.",TUFzqkWN8R6-Xx4kp8NXow,0,0,5,akrEIUCleFLMcy1VA3jYTQ

Yes, you can believe all the hype surrounding the macarons is true! 

Tonight, one of my really good galpals and I had dinner here right after classes ended at 6pm. Not too long after we parked and got off the car, she commented that she could already smell all the goodness seeping through the front door. 

This neat bakery is hard to miss at night. Located across the boca park complex, the bakery flashes 'pastry. bakery. bistro' in bright neon red, visible along Charleston. Parking is plenty and location is pretty much around the center of the town and highly accessible. 

We caught sight of the desserts early (who could overlook the colorful macarons?) on but walked over to the menu first thing to 'build our own sandwich', say baguette, turkey, lettuce, tomato, pesto and swiss cheese. The staff were really nice and even handed us a piece of 'prosciutto' when we asked what it was. While that was being made, we headed to get our sweet treats. Per Christina W.'s suggestion, I got the ginger macarons, and getting curious herself, my friend got one too along with chocolate pistachio & coffee. To my delight, they were all très délicieux! Fluffy and chewy! Seeing as we came from a long day at school, we treated ourselves to some meringues too - vanilla and coffee to be precise. The sandwich costed us about $9, but was enough for 4 people. We had so much left over that to-go was our only option. 

At the end of the night, we thought that perhaps trying some new restaurants for our next hang out would be a good idea, but an even better one would be to stay in touch with sambalatte and manon so that we could go over their whole menu one day!",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,1,0,4,FPWokh69i25F4c6j3lH1AA

Service was slow, there was a person ahead of us who apparently had been waiting quite awhile and was asking if her food was ever going to come out, and there was an older Asian woman at the register that seemed confused and disorganized (maybe it was her first day?), we had to repeat our order twice, and then I saw she had to come back over to one of the tables after us to go over their order again.  Lots of unbussed tables that were still dirty when we left.

I think the real star here is the desserts and pastries.  The cakes are HUGE and inexpensive.  The $1.10 macarons are wow good.  Just like any other macaron place, some flavors are better than others and I really loved the Caramel and Pistachio flavors.  These are twice the size of normal macarons, too.

For cakes, they have a good Black Forest cake and Tiramisu that are good.  The chocolate peanut butter cookie is also a pleasant surprise.  They also have a good mini chocolate croissant.

First off, their cake slices are hugeee. It probably takes me a few days just to finish a slice. All the slices I've tried aren't too sweet. It has just the right amount of sweetness in the cakes for my taste. The cake is moist in every bite, with their fresh whipped cream covering the sides. I can't remember which ones I've tried but I loved each and every one of them.

They also have a cafe part that sells sandwiches and things. I have never tried the cafe. Just the bakery part. They do sell whole cakes as well as slices. Oh and can't forget the macaroons! 

Word of advice though..come early. The earlier you come in, the more choices of cake slices you can choose from. I came once in the mid afternoon once and there was only like 3-4 different types of cake slices to choose from.

For my birthday, I wanted something different from my usual trip to Freed's Bakery and realized that instead of being constrained to cake, I could indulge in one of my favorite desserts: Tiramisu! I've had good (and bad) tiramisu at various restaurants, but I had to do a little research for an establishment offering a complete dessert rather than single servings. I discovered that Patisserie Manon offered a tiramisu cake via search, so it was decided!

I called to ensure that there were whole cakes available on Tuesday evening. Not only did they have the tiramisu cakes available, there are different sizes! That day, there were three (3) sizes available, noted in terms of how many people it serves: 4, 5, or 6. Prices start at $24 and increase in $6 increments to $36 for the largest. I opted for the ""6-person"" cake for $36 and requested a 'Happy Birthday' greeting. The individual assisting me via phone was very helpful and assured me about reserving the cake and having a chocolate birthday piece to place on top of the cake. Fabulous!

I arrived at the bakery approximately 10 minutes later and they were very busy (it was around 5pm)! We had to wait in line with everyone else for the pick-up, but that gave me a chance to check out all the other delectable pastries, cakes, and cookies. The tiramisu cake is beautiful with large dollops of fresh whipped cream and a pile of broken chocolate pieces in the center. I love the dainty 'Happy Birthday' chocolate piece they included!

The ""6-person"" cake can easily serve 8 big slices and even stretch to 10 smaller ones! I cut the cake to create eight slices and they were still HUGE! I can't imagine anyone eating a slice if it were cut into just six! I still have almost half the cake left. I could have probably gotten away with the ""4-person"" cake and not have leftovers. Either way, it was very delicious! I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I found myself munching and really enjoying the chocolate pieces (it's a bit excessive; definitely for decoration purposes).

it was also very good.  It was rich without being cloyingly sweet, and at $4.35 per gigantic slice, which is enough for 4 easily, it wasn't a bad value.  

I had to take a star off for one issue.  We noticed that on the bakery section, the employees didn't have hair nets or hats or anything to hold their hair back, and the employees had long, fluffy hair.

We enjoyed this pastry because it was mildly sweet and not packed with sugar like American pastries. The bread was fabulous with a thick tasty crust.

Now the not-so-good: sausage croissant. In France it's ""sausage,"" but in America it's a HOT DOG.  Our jaws dropped when we cut into this croissant and discovered a HOT DOG staring at us.  We ate the croissant and fed the hot dog to our appreciative Great Dane.  

Overall, we really liked this bakery and will return to try more of their items. Bonjour!",KQrxa3RFlpFEYZEqmI9ySA,2,0,4,dBzvf2vAH6tJcjkIpVG1Aw

The macarons used to be $1 each but now I believe they increased the prices, but they are still cheaper than the typical cafes that sell them for $2 each. In terms of the look of the macarons, they aren't as pretty and smooth as other places, but it still tastes delicious. The bistro menu has things like croque monsieurs, quiches, croissant sandwiches, etc, all of which are all really good and decadent and around $6-8 in price. I have not tried their other pastries but I hear very good things about them, so in the future, I will definitely have to try it out.",wi0d3o8tU6ahnUllJ3332w,1,1,5,dkWW55tPgfIJmfuQgirNWQ

This morning the doctor I was working with was really craving some sweets so I went to go pick us up some goodies from PM.. When you walk in you are hit with a delicious aroma and a bunch of beautiful pastries.. Towards the back they have their little bistro for sandwiches and hot dishes with booths to sit at (definitely coming back for lunch with the bf... he loved the movie Ratatouille LOL..)

The girl who helped me was patient & helpful while I checked out some stuff and she actually picked out the macaron flavors for me.. We got chocolate, vanilla, pistachio and salted caramel.. We also got an almond chocolate croissant.. The total came to $7.25 before tip.. NICE~!!!

When I got back to the office.. I was debating on if I should try them or not because I'm watching what I eat..  But I just had to have at least one little bite of everything haha.. OMG Everyone who has ever told me that macarons are over rated is WRONG!!! They taste like chewy cookies with a nice little crunch and gooey center... yummmmm All of them were good but Chocolate and Salted Caramel stood out.. I will be back just for the SALTED CARAMEL!!! Perfect balance of flavors. WOW.. and I'm not going to lie I actually had TWO little bites of just the salted caramel LOL... I also love the fact that the macarons come in mini sizes.. The almond chocolate croissant was good too. Really moist and buttery in the middle. 

Any who, too bad I'm trying to be healthier otherwise I would be coming here A LOT!!! Boooooo but hey.. we're all allowed to have cheat days every now and then right??? haha

I paid with cash, eat 24 said the business had to refund or credit me because it was a cash transaction. I called the business and the girl didn't know how to offer a credit and asked I call eat 24, again. Eat 24 then said its the responsibility of the business to call the customer ahead of time and let the customer know something isn't available, adjust the total and that they would not do anything because it was a cash transaction.

I don't understand why it has such high reviews except that they give gigantic portions.  The philosophy must be: The food isn't good but you get lots of it so it must be great!  Woohoo!

First of all, the place is as French as the France portion of EPCOT center.  I mean look at the red berets the poor wait staff has to wear.  The food has french names but the execution is way too ham fisted.  Everything is American super size.  There is no finesse.  The staff were very nice and attentive though.

We ate the savory food first.  The rillette was store bought.  It was all right.  I can buy better at Whole Foods.  The french onion soup was good though and we had to bring some home because guess what?  The portion was gigantic.  The beef bourgouignon was inedible.  It came in a nice pot though and looked promising.  It was sour because they used bad wine.  They didn't cook the beef right and it was stringy and tough.  I did like the quiche.  The quiche was light and fluffy and we got to take some home.   

The black forest cake that we got was very pedestrian.  I can make it at home with store bought stuff.  But one slice was bigger than my kid's head.  :)",Vh3XdOLujwPsUWygXQNO_w,4,3,3,zcHarebOF9lQrdHx4Flaow

I hear they have a nice selection of actual food items toward the rear of the bakery. I've never made it that far, but I will eventually. But the cakes, the macarons, the croissants- oh my gosh!

Croissants are around $2 per, but worth it. I've personally cleaned them out of stock at least once, so if you ever go in and there aren't any left, well, blame me. I'll probably die an early death, with my stomach and arteries full of buttery, flaky goodness. 

They offer a splendid selection of cakes and pastries. I've tried the chocolate mint cake (not my personal fave, but I'm not a chocolate person) which is reminiscent of a girl scout cookie on steroids. The fraiser is my personal addiction and comes in slices- large for $4.xx and a smaller, more human-sized portion for $3.xx. My husband bought me a whole frasier for my birthday ($36, if I remember correctly) and it was extra special- garnished with colorful macarons and enormous, fresh whole strawberries. A work of art. Their mimosa cake is a good pick as well.The latest cake I've sampled is their ""white"" chocolate forest cake. Covered in white slivers and filled with maraschino cherries, this is a no-brainer. 

The one and only negative might be their coffee- not very good and from a carafe. No thanks, but easily forgiven in the wake of everything else they do perfectly.

I tend to always go back to the fraiser-why mess with perfection-but I vow to venture out and try new treats, and soon.

We all ordered what we wanted most, but shared bites.

Ham&cheese croissant- I am picky about them since sometimes it isn't balanced. I get disappointed when the ham is way too smoky or cheese is overpowering or the croissant isn't a nice consistency. This is one of the best I've had with a great balance of flavors. Yum! 

Pate Friand- I love pate and this was pretty good. Only complain was the middle of the ball was a little bit cold, but still good that way. I just tend to favor a piping hot friand. 

Sausage Friand- pretty good..I think a little mustard to dip it would make it better. I think I like the pate one slightly better. 

Spinach,garlic,cream soup- it was good homemade soup. It tasted like a spanakopita soup specially if you dip some flaky pastry into it. I dipped parts of the friands into it. 

Beef Bourguignon- this was a generous portion of hearty food. They put noodles on the bottom and it went really well all together. Beef was very tender and fell apart. 

Potato Salad- grandma wanted a side for her croissant. This is one for those who don't like the tangy styles of potato.

We also got to-go fruit tarts (Pear for us, Peach for mom&grandma). They were large and a good deal for the price. I thought it would be all fruit but love that it was part eggy custard. I also go a feuillte-  yummy chocolate mousse, hazelnut creme and crisp layers. Taste like a Ferrero Rocher candy but I much rather have this.

The staff is also very nice both occasions we've been in.

I stumbled upon it through a top 100 list of Vegas online a couple of years ago.  Anyway, I have been frequenting Patisserie Manon every 2-3 weeks since then, as it is located in the Summerlin, Boca Park area.  I have been on the hunt for a bakery that can rival this  place; but alas, I have failed countless times. 

Now to the food.  Of course, their macarons are just schlamazing! My favorite is the salted caramel!  One of the cakes I enjoy most is the Frazier, which is this white cake, covered in thin, roasted slices of almond on it's perimeter, and has slices of strawberries between the three layers of delicious fluff.  Yum!  Most of the dessert items have one thing in common: having the right amount of sweetness.  It could be that this is something intended in French cooking.  Regardless, it's good and you can bet that the pastry chef know what he or she is doing. 

I've also ventured a bit deeper into the bakery, where their hot foods are made to order.  The quiche lorraine is my favorite.  I believe it has bacon and cheese (it's been a while since I've ordered it).  Their boeuf bourguignon is scrumptious.  The slabs of beef and slices of carrot are so tender.  The soup is so delicious. It's also served with a baguette, because this dish wouldn't be complete without you dipping it into the sauce with the trace of bergundy wine all up in there.  I'm hungry now.

What originally attracted me here years ago was my fervent hunt for macarons. What's not to like about macarons? They are cute, colorful, and sweet! I was a little skeptical when I first saw the macarons here because...well they looked awkward. They were chubby and lop-sided, but you know what? That saying ""It's what's inside that counts"" couldn't be more true. 

When you first walk in, you instantly see the case of macarons, tarts, eclairs and other delectable sweets screaming eat me! Next, are the full sized cakes. Further along, are baked goods like croissants and breads. Even further back, you can order more savory items like quiches and sandwiches. 

After multiple cake orders, dozens and dozens of macarons later, baby showers, birthday parties, girls nights out, and even just because moments...Patisserie manon has never ceased to amaze me. Their cakes are show stoppers and people can't stop popping these macarons in their mouth. Every party, someone will ask ""Oh, where is this from?"" 

Some of my favorite items:
Macarons:
- Caramel w/ salted butter
- Coffee
- Chocolate 

Cake:
- Frazier/fraisier (sp?) (white cake w/ fresh strawberries and topped with macarons) 

Desserts:
- All eclairs (vanilla, chocolate, and coffee) 

Personally, I think everything is priced well. Macarons are $1...maybe a few cents more and cakes run $30-50. Customer service has always been decent and never had any problems with any orders.

The ""cookies"" exude freshness with their thin, crisp shell surrounding a just moist center.  The gentle caress of almond accentuates every flavor of not too sweet filling.  The nut flavors are outstanding but for $1 each, indulge in them all!

True Parisian style breads (great crust, great chew).  Tearing lustfully into a baguette with your bare hands, smelling it then enjoying its flavor with a glass of wine is hard to beat.

Outstanding croissants.  Flaky, not to buttery, with the perfect kiss of sweetness and saltiness.  Eating them naked is the only way to go. (You guys know what I mean - plain croissants).

Great looking shop.  Friendly and passionate service.

Over the years, French bakeries on the Strip have become less enticing where flavor has fallen flat. Manon is privately-owned where the food is the star and not the name on the store-front. Chef Jean-Paul and his wife Rachel are the owners of Manon which they named after one of their daughters. And I consider this place to be one of the best French pâtisseries outside of France.

MACARONS: At the heart of every French bakery lies a macaron. As soon as you enter the store, you're greeted by a case filled with mountains of colorful confectioneries. No matter what flavors you choose, each macaron will be identical in size with a flawless finish. And no complaints here on cookie:filling ratio. At $1 a pop, they're a steal! A fraction of the cost of Ladurée, more accessible, and equal in taste. 

SAVORY: You can keep it under $10! If I worked in the area, I'd probably be here everyday for lunch. There's a sweet lunch combo: soup, sandwich, drink all for $9. But offering to buy me me a spinach or escargot quiche (yeah, I said snails) would be an easy way to get me on a date.

Delicious sweets ranging from eclairs, tarts, cakes, macaroons and dessert pastries of all shapes and colors.
I don't know of any other bakery of this type that pales in comparison to Manon based on the the vast selection alone. 
I recommend going in the morning and noon times if you want to try some of there most popular items. 
The macaroons are the best I've tasted, they are soft and have a good balance of sweetness. I order them along with any dessert I get.

They do a great job complementing the desserts by making awesome coffee.
I love Cafe Mocha, they make it taste better than most of the places I've been too.
They also make fresh breads, sandwiches, and quiche. 
The staff is super friendly and helpful. 

Just an all around great to enjoy!!!

We tried a bunch of things, but the truffle choco cake was probably my favorite.  I tried the macaroons, and they were good too...kinda fluffy and not overly sweet.  I also liked the profiteroles, so I would recommend any of those!

The tiramisu wasn't the best I've had, but it was good.  I prob would skip it next time though.

For my first day back in town, my brother and I stopped by after a dinner nearby. Considering I had been obsessing over macarons for the past six months, it was evident we must get as many as possible to justify our journey across town. We picked up Ginger, Raspberry, Peanut Butter and Blueberry at a dollar apiece. Also, my brother had heard about the Tropezienne cake from a few of his Yelp friends, so that was clearly a necessity. 

The macarons. Oh god, I thought I found perfection in Seattle...but I was wrong. So wrong. These are the epitome of what a macaron should be - airlike but with crunch; chewy yet fluffy. These blew the ones I picked up in Seattle out of the water - the Ginger flavor being the clear standout.

As for the Tropizienne, I had never heard about it before. But after one bite, I sure as hell know what it is now. Layers of brioche soaked in a simple syrup with butter cream and peaches in between - seriously, how could you not love it? This mentality was clearly adopted between David S. and myself as we barehandedly devoured half of it in the parking lot - quite a barbaric sight if I'd ever seen one. The best part? A large (think the size of your head) piece was only $4.35.

We explained but he wouldn't listen that we'd already paid for these items. He was insanely rude.

All were chewy on the outside, creamy on the inside and bursting with intense, fresh flavors. Although I love them all, try the salted caramel macarons, they are magical. Until Manon, I always went all the way from my home in North Las Vegas, to Bouchon in the Venetian for my pastries.

One day for lunch, I had Manon's special, which for me was the French onion soup and the goat cheese quiche. The soup was delicious and the quiche was delicate and tender. I bought an almond croissant to take home. It was one of the best I'd ever tasted. I've been to Paris and I must say that these flavors took me there again.

I think this place is going a bit downhill, or cleanliness standards or other standard operating procedure is going by the way side. My soup and quiche were warm but not hot when served to me, I should have sent it back but didn't. But this isn't what the real issue was. This is a family run business, and two teenage girls kept going from the real kitchen in back to the sandwich/quiche ordering/prep area. One was redoing her pony tail (while chatting with the gals that work that area) where the food was being prepared. That's unacceptable. I get that this is their family's restaurant but that's totally unsanitary-she did it at least 2 different times when I was eating my food which was literally prepared inches away. I also noticed that they cut food on the prep boards, but placed others commercial items (as they needed to use them) on the same board (box of food wrap, and a salad spinner), these are not sanitary, or considered clean, and raw food like lettuce and tomatoes were being cut there. And the lettuce was put in spinner, but tomatoes just placed on directly on customers plates for serving (surplus placed in bin).

Two last things that made me think I can no longer patronize this place. A young girl (customer there with her mom) returned a carry out container and asked for a smaller one (her mom said that's too big, get a smaller one). She was touching the inside of the container (I mean she's a kid). The girls took it back, placed it with the other ""clean/unused"" ones. Yikes, that's not right, just throw it out, and give her the smaller container.

Lastly, there was a young man working for Patisserie Manon. He was on break, just had lunch, finished, and walked to back kitchen (for a min to probably clock back in) and went to front counter to help customers. No hand washing, just ate his sandwich, etc with his hands and starting touching carry out items/helping customers. Another yikes!

Ironically serving as a sharp contrast to the experience at Honey Salt a later day stop at Patisserie Manon would present pleasant and competent service despite entirely sub-par French pastry - the seemingly well regarded shop perhaps overrun with holiday orders but unable to impress with a single item; the macarons gummy (albeit quite nicely flavored,) the mille-feuille mushy, and the Buche Noel ornately decorated but tilted far adrift in the frosting to cake ratio making it somewhat akin to spooning frosting from a can directly into your mouth.  Good, although certainly not great, the almond croissant was one saving grace for the lot and I'd gladly return to enjoy one fresh/warm/fluffy at a later date to better assess as the shell was appropriately crisp, the frangipane thin and not overly sweet, and butter tones ample...but at the same time, why travel so far off strip when both Bouchon and Payard are more than capable of delivering a superlative croissant without leaving the hotel?",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,0,2,hc_QGK_pOBdJ0ytb0GQWQg

- Greatest macarons I've tasted yet! true to the flavor. My favorites are the chocolate mint, vanilla, and pistachio. least would be the blueberry surprisingly. Most of the macarons are very thick and chewy, which i love. I don't like the airy ones with a light crisp, which is probably how they are supposed to be made. There's is still crispy despite the chew.
Presentation of macaron is unique. very soothe surface, but seem to still be individualized since the shapes vary. I like how they put bits of pistachio and how the the purple macaron is actually cherry. haha. they use a lot of dye.   
- Cheapest macaroons! I've been to a lot of macaroon places in the OC and LA, and I think that this place tops them all. I say that bc pricing drives most of my decisions. lol. it's really cheap. Macaroons in socal are range from 2 to 3 -ish.

The peach tarte tasted of canned peaches and nothing more. The croissant was stale. There are so many better options.,tf8JV2Ucc_R_r5Gf5WKGeg,0,0,2,cFlE0JB3FoBKqb9sbkTfSg

I had the quiche lorraine and by far, it was the BEST quiche I've ever had, so I seriously recommend that choice for a lunch option.  It comes with a small salad on the side.  I finished the meal with one of their huge slices of Frasier cake, sort of a strawberry shortcake but more elegant, and so large it can easily be split between two people.  My previous reviews haven't been the most positive, but I am willing  to give this bakery a few more chances, and I will definitely be back for another quiche, which I hope they maintain at the excellent quality that I experienced.

They have a wide selection of macaroons which is a total plus. AND they were $1.10 each! Possibly the cheapest I've seen for a macaroon yet .. 

But, I'm not really a macaroon person. I've tried a good amount prior and they're all pretty sugared. And the ones here weren't any better. They didn't really taste like .. anything besides sugar. I had gotten a Rose one and a Raspberry one. Neither of them tasted of anything but sugary goodness. Kinda disappointed .. but their macaroons have interesting colors ..

Their mint chocolate macaroon was blue and their blueberry macaroons look like coal HAHA!

 I think the best place was Bouchon in Venetian for macaroons tbh. Their flavors were a bit more prominent in their macaroons.

However, I simply LOVE their Fraiser. It was delicious. It was light but dense at the same time -- if that made any sense. The cake wasn't fluffy compared to some of the other ones I've had elsewhere. But their toppings weren't heavy cream or anything like that. They used whip cream and the piece of cake was covered in almonds, which gave it a wonderful flavor. It had a thin chocolate bottom as well. The piece of cake was huge and it was only like $4.50? It was enough for 4 of us. I definitely want to go back and see if I can get a whole Fraiser cake (for birthday/event)!! 


Overall, no to their macaroons.
Yes to their Fraiser.

It has only been on my must try list for six months. If I had know it was this good, I would have trekked out here sooner.

I put my foot down after seeing Jade W. almost picked a fight with Sylvia and Nelson Q. because she found out that they were the other people who was ordering her favorite dessert. Any pastry that could insight a riot is something I must have in my life even if I have made a new enemy. I wish I knew how to pronounce or spell it.

The large obtuse triangle cake, on the right, is the way to go. It is a spongy cake soaked in a light simple syrup with a layer of butter cream, peaches, more spongy cake, a caramelized shell like topping, with granules of sugar on top. My sister and I got that and five Macarons for less then $10. That monster of a cake was only $4 and change. We had no fork and lost our dignity as we tore into this cake while parked outside. If self respect means eating with utensils, you can keep it, because I want my cake now. That was not even the end of our sugar trip. We had got two Ginger, one Raspberry, one Peanut Butter, and a Blueberry Macaron. We could not resist trying the ginger. Crispy outside shell, soft and chewy inside with a nice lingering taste of this medicinal root had me on cloud nine.

5383751,2015-02-20,7,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"Seriously. Top-notch quality macarons for $1.10 each? Patisserie Manon's macarons were definitely worth my visit here! While there are lots of other pastries, baked goods, and delectable looking cakes in the front of the store, my eyes were set on the colorful macarons behind the glass display that greets you the moment you walk into the store. These macarons are a little differently shaped than the ones I am used to (more flat and cookie like) - these are strange puffed up shells making them longer and less wide than I am  used to. The color of the shells also look a little artificial because they are so bright. BUT, they were amazing. 

I bought eight macarons, trying to test all the different flavors. Overall, I felt that the macarons had a really puffy texture upon first bite, but then became chewy afterwards, making the perfect combination of shell and filling to give you that great macaron enjoyment. 

My favorite flavors were: 
Rose - not too heavy. It contained the perfect flowery taste to delight my tastebuds. And the shells were pink and white! 

Salted Caramel - I loved the flavor of the caramel! Not too sticky, but had a good consistency that worked really well with the shells.

I also really liked lemon and strawberry. They didn't taste extraordinary, but they had very good taste. The strawberry even had bits of real strawberry inside of the filling. 

Flavors that were a-ok: 
Ginger - Interesting flavor, but not my cup of tea. I love ginger candy, but I thought the taste was a little weird for a macaron. It was also really sticky. 

Mango - It was interesting, but a bit too artificial for my liking. 

Pistachio - I thought the pistachio had good almond flavor in the shell, and the filling was also decent. I'm not a big fan of pistachio macarons, but these were okay. 

Mocha - It wasn't too strong on the mocha taste, but I liked it. Not memorable, but something I would try again!

When I was buying the macarons, they informed me that they had salted caramel and mango in the back. I don't know if they would have told me this if I hadn't asked them about the flavors, but as I am a big salted caramel macaron fan, I would definitely have been bummed out if I missed out on this flavor! 

If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely be coming by a few times a month to pick up macarons! And their cakes! They were gorgeous and very elaborate (but expensive!)! 

Patisserie Manon is located in a quiet plaza next to the Whole Foods market plaza. We weren't sure at first where it was, but we saw a man standing outside with a sign. I also saw another location for this place down the street. I guess they have two storefronts? They have lots of seating inside the restaurant, and I believe a café where you can order drinks and sandwiches further inside the store. 

I definitely will be coming back when I'm in Vegas!",t3cu9DxXtGyaPIWNvPOXxA,12,16,5,2sK3p-XmQZKqJzsRljDGvw

Some of the downers were the ice tea was horrible, the service was marginal at best and there was a family eating next to us the parents did nothing to control their children from running around and disturbing the tables around them.

The macarons are puffy, have a crisp shell, soft/chewy inside, & pretty good fillings. I prefer macarons to be chewy rather than being overly soft with weird crumbly textures. Favorite flavors are vanilla, salted caramel, mango, rose, & pistachio. Other desserts that I've tried (eclairs, cakes, etc.) & quiches are also great! Only negative is I've encountered rude employees a couple of times. Last time I went there, an unhappy-looking girl rung me up.

It's a 5 minute drive from work, which may not be a good thing for my diet. My first visit was with my mom, who happened to be in town. We decided to split a small ham and cheese croissant and a dutch apple tart. We ordered 2 coffees as well. When i took the first bite of that croissant I was taken aback at how many different buttery layers of crusty goodness it contained. It was literally perfection on a plate. It had a mild melted cheese balanced with a sweet savory ham and it took my breath away. We both looked at each other marveling at the taste. I couldn't believe how good this little $2.95 sandwich could be and neither could she. It was THAT GOOD! So simple, yet insanely rich and flavorful. The tart was delicious as well and made the perfect ending to the breakfast. The coffee was refilled constantly while we stayed to chat well after the food was finished. This kind of establishment is part of the reason I love this city. You can go to an authentic French bakery and bask in the splendor of feeling like you're in another time and place, then pack up and head back to reality a five minute drive away.

If I was just dealing with the front of the store and talking about baguettes and croissants I would probably give it 4 stars but the other day I ventured into the back  where they serve coffee soups sandwiches and quiche. I was so very disappointed
I ordered a croque monseur and a spinach and goat cheese quiche. What a letdown.  Since the word croque actually means crunch in french you would not expect the soggy mess I was served. The sandwich was three pieces of limp bread with a very small amount of flavorless ham and unmelted cheddar.  Why there was cheddar in a sandwich traditionally made with gruyere I have no idea. The top was covered in a bland bechamel sauce and gruyere. It was barely warmed through and the whole sandwich was soggy.  A total disappointment.
Next on to the quiche. Under seasoned, watery with a limp crust. It seemed as if someone forgot to drain the spinach before It went into the custard. The pastry was pale and anemic with very little texture. I truly have had supermarket a products that were better.

I don't find myself out in Summertucky too often, so when I found myself staring this mouth-watering French bakery in the face, I submitted to temptation immediately. Best decision of my day.

I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but when I do indulge, I go balls to the wall. I'll visit Payard or Jean-Phillipe or Chocolate & Spice or Crown Bakery.

And holy crap. This place slays every single one of them dead. It looks as good as any patisserie I walked into on the streets of Paris and probably tastes a little better too. I can't believe I just said that but this place out-Frances France.

As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a case full of buche du noel, the traditional rich, complex, decadent French Christmas pastry - only in flavors well beyond the traditional chocolate, to include Grand Marnier, pistachio, vanilla and coffee. I've had Payard's legendary buche, and the versions served here are simply a cut above. Sorry, François.

The rest of the dessert case contains similarly irresistible treats - my focus was drawn by the amazing selection of cakes, which may well be the very best desserts anywhere in Las Vegas. And for like $4.30 per slice. Something like this on the Strip would cost you double and not be nearly this good.

Also of note is their baguette. They offer a crispy variety and a soft variant. I opted for the crispy on my visit and discovered a flavor that was less comparable to bread and more akin to the very best New York style pizza crust I've ever had.

Everything looks great here.  I swear we're looking at the choices for a solid ten minutes everytime as the lunch crowd continues to ask us ""Umm..are you in line or just looking?"".  Then we do the same thing for dessert.

The quiches are great- very creamy and flavorful. Obviously the loraine is the best because the bacon is clutch.

Croissants super flakey and buttery as they should be- even ones Gordon could be proud of from his days getting tooled training in Paris.

FYI: I came here to buy a last minute birthday cake, just know that all the premade cakes are in the FREEZER! and apparently need two hours to defrost. So allow time for that!

Fraiser caker 
2.5/5 sweetness
This cake is delicious.  The cream is fluffy and leaves a nice aroma in your mouth.  The texture of the cake is just firm enough to sink your sweet tooth in it.  The strawberry is always fresh.  The almond crust adds a good savory balance to the sweetness.  This is a lovely choice if you are craving for a berry cake.  Its not a heavy cake.  This dish goes very well with any flower flavor or white tea such as rose tea, jasmine or light green tea.   

Lemon Tart/Mixed Berry Tart/Strawberry Tart//Blueberry Tart
 3/5 sweetness
The fruit tart has a fruity aroma with moose-like creamy texture to it. The lemon tart does not have tangy sour after taste.  It is balance just right between the sweet and the sourness.  The mixed berry tart occasionally can have a little sourness, the sugar glaze compliment very well with that berry sourness.   If you don't enjoy sour fragrance in tarts.  Blueberry tart is a good choice.  The shortbread cookie crust brings a very good balance to all fruit base tart.  Compares to the sweetness, the tarts is a sweeter than the strawberry cake.  It is a very refreshing dish and goes very well with dark tea such Earl grey or english breakfast tea.  

Chocolate Tart 
4/5 sweetness
Any one who loves dark chocolate and shortbread cookie should try this dish.   The rich creamy dark chocolate custard rest smoothly on top of the shortbread cookie tartshell.  It screams chocolate all over.  My recommendation of the drink would be coffee preferably black.",DNxBV9OfvwNkNWZwLCyDkg,1,0,5,BBfpNUvdRvM-WbzM-7Dt5g

 I give them props for two things- I think for what you get their prices are very reasonable and, the other is their cakes and macaroons are not overly sweet, something that's a huge turn off for me. 
 Same reason, however, my family didn't love it- they found the taste to be meh. 
 The appearance of the store is haphazard. You walk into one small unmanned counter on one side and three on the opposite. The main counters are run by staff, that presumably roams all three counters (?) but I was a bit confused. Baskets of lemon, orange and vanilla merengue, covered in plastic wrap, were sitting everywhere and it made me wonder if I had to have a store employee follow me around and bag items I wanted?...
 We settled on two GIANT slices of cake- chocolate and strawberry, at $4.75/slice that seemed a bargain. Quirky macaroons in colors of rainbow are priced at $1.25/piece. They aren't exactly small as some reviews mentioned. They are smallish in diameter, but very plump. We got chocolate mint, pistachio, vanilla and peanut butter. My 12 YO said vanilla was her favorite. Even just smelling the chocolate mint made me suspect the flavor would have been overbearing. 
 I took a pistachio one for myself, flavor was very good and again, not too sweet, but it didn't seem super fresh. Like a ""sat in the fridge for a while"" aftertaste to it. 
 Baguette was sort of an obligatory add on, it was ok, nothing to write home about.
 There is a deli sort of eatery towards the back, but we didn't venture. 
 Another thing I didn't quite get was a sign that said boxes are $1 extra. So what does that mean- you can have your cake bagged? I didn't think to save a receipt for reference, but seems odd. 
 Two ladies working the counter were helpful and a girl waiting on us was sweet.

Other pastry = 3 stars, nothing terribly special

I came here with a friend on our way out of Vegas. I was waffling on getting macarons, but I am so glad I did because they were excellent. I think they were everything a macaron should be and so different from others I have had other places that made me feel that I didn't like this pastry. I had the salted caramel (so freakin good) and the coffee (another excellent choice). 

The other pastries I got - an apple turnover thing (kind of dry, not a lot of flavor) and a slice of the chocolate strawberry cake. Let me say that the cake slice was huge. Beyond huge. I ate this for 3 days and still ended up throwing half the slice away because it got too old. My box probably weighed 4 lbs or something. Anyway, the actual flavor of the cake was good, but nothing terribly special. The strawberries were fresh, but the chocolate wasn't very decadent.

5643823,2016-09-25,5,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"I've definitely experienced better. Not to ish on this place too much, but looking at the stars they could use a reality check. 

First, this place is far from the Strip, so no, not convenient for many visitors like myself. 

Second, the set-up can only be described as bizarre. Inefficient and unorganized, without any indication that the goods are fresh. Nor any faith that this place is concerned about cleanliness. Just my observation. They literally have several display cases that are randomly placed near the entrance. The back of the business is a sandwich/restaurant. They have an industrial, kitchen work counter on which they have placed a majority of assorted meringues. They have this rogue display case with coffee and chocolate eclairs. They have some French condiments on the right hand wall. They have a candy abstract tree on the wall in-between the bakery and restaurant. They have two creepy mannequins, maybe they are for Halloween. 

Third, the macarons were crap. I've dabbled, and my meager attempts shamed this self-proclaimed French bakery. One of the macarons I was given had feet on only one side. The consistent problem with all the macarons was they were hollow, thus made improperly. Macarons are a difficult dessert, and I did not feel any of the macarons I received nor viewed were fit for basic bakery standards. I ordered a Salted Caramel, Rose, Strawberry, and White Chocolate Coconut. They were not good macarons, by a long stretch. Hugely disappointed. I only ordered 4 (at $1.25 each) because I could tell by looking at them that they were unlikely to be up to my standards.

Fourth, the Mille Feuille was awful. It was neither fresh, nor packaged well. Plus it is $4.75, what a rip.

On the only positive note I can comment on, besides the decent (if painfully slow) service, was the Fraiser (strawberry, toasted almond, white cream cake), which was delectable. But, considering this was an item I only ordered because nothing else looked very appetizing, this is not enough to even warrant 3*s. Plus, I wish it tasted fresher.

Yeah, probably not willing to come back.",fsKOJJAKMgv1KygGrm_X7w,8,2,2,dG-eXYFu1HR1NQ_dOs32UA

I wish I could have brought back a few hundred chocolate croissants and Croque Monsieurs. I immediately began to look up french bakeries and patisseries on Yelp and found quite a few. There were some I had already been to and I had been to this bakery before but really didn't appreciate it.

I went one morning and decided to try their chocolate croissants and to my surprise they tasted very closely to the ones I had been eating in Paris. The filling was creamy and light, and of course chocolate. The croissant was light, airy and crumbly which surprised me since our water is so hard here in the valley. The baker is a master at this establishment! We also purchased a couple of macaroons as well which I found to be very tasty.

I came back a couple of weeks later to have lunch and ordered the Croque Monsieur. It tasted completely different than the ones I had been eating but still had lots of interesting texture and was filling.  Of course the bread didn't have the same consistency or moisture but I have to realize that I am living in the desert and not on the banks of the Seine.

Their pastries are large and not too fancy and I appreciate the utilitarian approach they are using.  The lady behind the counter was warm and inviting and the restrooms were clean.  I especially liked their toilet...it's a weird one....you have to pull up on this little pin to flush it.  Novelty!

When asked if the truffle pastry could be cut in half, serve half at the bakery, half to take home, we were met with such resistance and astonishment that we just ended up giving in and having it served in its entirety, only to throw away the uneaten half.  Honestly, it's enough for 3 servings, and would be better enjoyed in small doses because it is too rich for such a large portion.

Our second choice was a puff pastry filled with a custard, again supersized, but not as rich, therefore more manageable to the palate in one sitting.  It was quite delicious, the puff pastry fluffy and buttery, and the custard was creamy and perfectly sweet without being overbearing.

The cappucinos, were weak in flavor, if frothy.  It almost tasted as if made of a regular roast coffee bean.  No self respecting coffee lover would call this a cappucino.

The actual location is large, but feels cold and sterile.  Bright blue formica tables and chairs more fitting for a hospital commissary and enough super bright flourescent lighting to perform microsurgery on an ant doesn't add to the ambiance, which is non-existent.  The layout is confusing and unwelcoming.

There's a lot of potential, both for the space and the menu, but it is a far cry from the warm, burnished familiarity of a neighborhood bistro.  In the land of faux finishes, they could certainly do with some mood lighting, cafe curtains, and bakery smells or the scent of broiled cheese on a Croque Monsieur (a French bistro staple not on the menu), not the ding of a microwave.  Even a surly French waiter would be welcome in place of the two perfectly coiffed and manicured suburban housewives looking down their noses when asked to cut what basically was a piece of chocolate cake in half.

So my excitement lasted all of 5 minutes after walking in, alas I am not destined to have a convenient patisserie at my disposal.  My search continues...",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,5,2,2,25lVvhF2ps60OpLilh79yQ

I didnt blame him they were out of alot of breads but noticed a lot of their food is pre made and they just throw it in a toaster to melt the cheese not sure how I feel about that doesnt seem very fresh but maybe its a french thing. Desserts are phenomenal I would come back if I was really craving some fruit tarts or something sweet, prices are great but will probably pass on the bistro.",Urq54Q9SWt1w0PiHMGb4Iw,1,1,3,QFTWSono_8pjhfn_zBb_kg

It was a rainy day so why not enjoy some treats from the patisserie? We both had the croque madame which came with a small side salad. The sandwich was made to perfection! From the perfectly fried egg, thick ham, and the crispy but tender bites of bread...we were in heaven. 

We ended up getting a slice of raspberry white chocolate cake and eating half of the slice while still there. The cake was moist and not too dense or too sweet. The cream filling was perfect texture and light flavor that paired beautifully with the white chocolate and the raspberries. 

They have a large array of desserts and fresh baked baguette. I was sad there were no palmiers, but maybe another time. My only real issue would be the awkward set up of tables to ordering area. It can get a little busy and cramped! However, I would come here again and again to try all the different varieties of foods and treats!",iMDnsKqcixMnYwH85L8Nqg,1,1,4,APwSXZyngdlE0cPKFtTkMw

Kind of weird that they have the daily specials outside the door but not at the counter. And the girl didn't know prices when I asked. They have soup and sandwiches, but also several French comfort food options - pork cassoulet, beef bourguignon, coq au von and escargot. Sorry I'm sure I butchered those names. I went with the bourguignon and escargot just to try and although the escargot was underwhelming (think they use unsalted butter?) the beef was exceptional. It was perfect for a cold November afternoon - a huge amount of tender beef braised in a super rich red wine sauce with carrots over a little penne pasta for a mere $10. Portion is def enough for 2 to share. 

Also picked up some things from the bakery - ginger macaroons were delish. Cake and even fillings were really light, my friend said it was the best coconut cake he's ever had. Service was friendly, but not great - girl at food counter didn't know pricing for specials, girls at pastry counter saw me standing there for a few min but just kept talking to each other on the side. You don't need to help me right away but pls at least acknowledge that I'm there.  Regardless ill still be back for the food and their whole cakes are also beautiful - not just your typical options of chocolate or yellow.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,1,0,5,6MLsbBFhJAjp5drz5GWkpg

5810533,2011-11-22,2,A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g,"beautiful. delicious. authentic. amazing. 

lets start with the pastries. 
they are nothing shy of perfection. they have everything from sweet, delicate berries to their incredible, rich chocolate cakes and last but not least the extraordinarily dense hazel nut treats. 
It is roughly $5 for a slice of their scrumptious cakes or for a hardy piece of a delectable pastry. This may seem pricey but it is well worth it in the end. 
And let's not forget the macaroons! 
(now these are not the nasty american coconut macaroons you are probably thinking of. these are French and authentic and delicious).
For only $1 each you can enjoy a variety of amazing flavors like vanilla, coffee, raspberry, strawberry, cherry, chocolate, lemon, and there's more hahaha. 

Now if you are watching your figure (or you have gone here many times before an simply indulged on all of these sinful treats) you can try and force yourself past the pastry counter into the back where they have their incredible breads and soups. 

Today I had their Mushroom and goat cheese quiche. It was quite possibly the most amazing quiche I have ever consumed in my life. The crust was so lift and delicate and the egg mixed with the goat cheese was the perfect consistency!
My fiancé had the beef bourguignon and I must say, I have been trying to be a vegetarian and this dish blew it for me! 
The beef was so tender and just melted in your mouth and the sauce was to DIE for! Never have I tasted anything like it before! 
Included in our lovely lunch/dinner was complimentary raspberry and/or lemon water. We ended this fantastic meal with two raspberry macaroons. 

Now if I were you I would go sooner rather than later. Because other people have realized how amazing this bakery is the food goes fast. And once it's gone it is gone until they bake it fresh the next day. 
so go go go!!

It may look ordinary, but when you take a bite; all the flavors meld together in your mouth. Definitely recommend the coffee as well..I rate it better than Starbucks! The cappuccino was also delightful. I've found it hard to come across a decent tasting one.
Let me sit here and enjoy the rest of my breakfast and coffee. It's so great I had to stop everything to write this. Wish there was one back home...

Edit: the macaroons are so good! I remember family bringing them from France. I have to say some of them really do taste like it. I'm more traditional on the flavors, so pistachio and coffee were my faves. Salted caramel is great too!",e9aFuyHXGeZKW9JZ3QsvPg,0,0,5,CWGYRyI0G3lmZY9Bm0sYHg

The top tier in my list is strawberry shortcake (Fraiser) and the coffee cake.

I had my mother in law and family members come from Europe and I wanted to give a good impression and serve a delicious cake I asked the girl witch one will be the best cake and she told me to buy the one with raspberry  to leave out for 2- 3 hours and then put it back in the fridge I did as I was told and when I went to cut it it was still frozen but it had been out for 3 hours and if I left it out longer the fruit was getting Very mushi.
I spoke to Gabriel the Manager which was very nice and told me he will talk to the owner and will call me back to see if I could exchange for something else which I told him that I don't mined to pay Extra Money for that.
After he talk to the owner he called back to tell me the owner said NO because I had cut a piece which how would I know that the cake is still frozen and the fruit was getting bad if I didn't cut it ?!?!?!?!?!
If I could give 00000 stars I would customer service from the owner is HORRIBLE!!!!!!

Everything we tried was as mouth-watering as they looked. Delicious French Apple Tart. Tasty and colorful French Macarons ($1.10 each). I tried the ginger and raspberry. Both were great! The Macarons had a smooth, crisp shell with a chewy, moist and flavor-packed interior. The apple square strudel-looking pastry was very good, which we enjoyed at the house, poolside, beer in hand.

But since that is quite a drive, I did a quick yelp search, found Patisserie Manon, read some reviews, perused the photos, bookmarked it, then dreamt about the delicious pillow sandwich cookies.

And I am happy to say, that Patisserie Manon lived up to my expectation.  I actually also came in to have lunch but stopped at the bakery counter first to satisfy this craving.  One cherry and one coffee.  The crackly shell and chewy inside was perfect melt in your mouth deliciousness.  I ordered one of each of the 10 flavors to take home, as well. 

Although I originally searched this place out for the macarons, I'm glad I stumbled upon it, because lunch was delicious too.  I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese quiche.  Put 2 of my favorite ingredients in a perfect puff pastry, and I am a fan for life.  I ordered the ham and cheese croissant for my toddler, and although it was a good sized sandwich- she practically finished the entire thing by herself.

Patisserie Manon is exactly what I have been missing about my old neighborhood.  That mom and pop feel where the prices and descriptions are hand written on fluorescent sheets of paper in the display.  But, more importantly, that homemade flavor.   There are so many items that I want to try- the pate, the escargot, the beef bourgignon. Not to mention, the other fabulous looking desserts.
