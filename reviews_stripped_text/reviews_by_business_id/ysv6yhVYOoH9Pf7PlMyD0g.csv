I was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant close to the Bally's casino just beside the Starbucks in the Grand Bazzaar shops.

We ordered the Our burger, the bbq bacon burger and tator tots. We also had a strawberry mule and a pint of Guinness. Everything we had was amazing. Our drinks were prompt, our food came out quickly and the service was superb. The bar manager, Paul, stopped by to check on us and really made us feel at home. I loved the way the fresh jalape√±os gave the bbq bacon burger a zing. Our tator tots were perfectly crisp and the our burger I should have taken a picture of because I would love to try and recreate that at home. The atmosphere was electric. Great buzz about the place. Constant traffic of people in and out. This is a great addition to the area. Really raises the bar for Bally's and the Grand Bazaar shops. We will certainly be back.

First of all, it was 45 min to be seated, then another 10 min to get our order taken, and another 25 min to get our food. All totaled, 80 min before I took my first bite.

As for the food, we ordered the Thanksgiving Sandwich, ""Our Burger"", and Onion Strings.  The Thanksgiving was very dry, and I'm sure this was due to the ground turkey patty.  Not even the cranberry sauce inside helped with how dry it was.  ""Our Burger"" wasn't bad, but it tasted like something anyone could make at home.  At nearly $12, it should be more exceptional.  The Onion Strings were undercooked.  Lastly, though minor, there was no ice in my soda.  I didn't really get a chance to ask the young man as he seemed very rushed and busy.  

In the end, I can now say I tried Wahlburgers.  I will only go back if I am ever in Boston, as I would like to try the food at the original restaurant.

745204,2016-09-27,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"I recommended this restaurant to an out of town VIP client that wanted a 'great burger'. They wanted to try something the Bay Area did not have; Five Guys and In 'N Out was out of the question. They also were not looking for a foie gras with gold flakes rendition of a burger. They just wanted a 'great burger'. I normally only recommend to my friends and clients places that I personally have made a cameo before, but somehow I don't know why I said ""Wahlburgers"". So off they go!  The next day, I see my clients and they asked why I had sent them there!  I will spare all of you the details my clients gave me, but I needed to try this for myself. So I decided to go the next day as soon as they opened around 11 a.m. so I could avoid the tourist lines.  Although there was no wait at around 11:30ish, there was a good deal of patrons already sitting inside the restaurant including the bar.  I decided to take a seat at the outside bar stool which was probably my biggest mistake. They air ducts pushing air out to keep bugs from coming in to the restaurant were at full blast!  I felt I was Donna Summers in concert when she sings in front of an air blower to push her wild hair all over the place!  I could have easily moved, but there truly was no other place to sit at the bar at this point.  I ordered a Blue Moon while the bartender brought me a menu.  As I took my first sip, I scanned the location of this property and it immediately gave me a flashback of when I was in Bangkok eating by the public markets watching a cobra being tamed! At least in Bangkok there was some great views...This location is containers converted to shops, and very loud. There is construction everywhere.  If you think you will have location of the Strip, think again....this is not the place for you.  But alas....I am here to review the food.  The burger was decent, nothing great.  I asked the bartender to substitute the raw onions for grilled, they decided to charge me the additional $1 for it even though it was a substitute.  Of course, when I got my burger, there was no onions at all.  I decided not to wait for the onions and told the bartender to 86 the onions from my bill. She didn't apologize, but just said she would take it off my bill.  

Overall, the food is okay.....the burger was good; cooked to my temperature, tater tots were nothing to brag about; you could find these at your local elementary school during mystery meat Friday's. The service.... not the best. They need to work on it.  Bartender was confused and truly didn't care whether or not the order was correct. You could tell she was just clocking in and clocking out to get base salary and tips.  

I can see why my clients from San Francisco lectured me on my choice of restaurant.  The two stars is for the ice cold Blue Moon I had and they were able to get my burger patty medium rare. Love the Wahlberg family; great actors and singers, but stick to your Calvin Klein panties and leave the restaurant industry to those who get it.

Drinks
Adult Frappes- Fluffanuttahh and Mud Pie (to thick to drink out of their tiny straws and I doubt there is even any alcohol in there)

Food
The Melt and a Double Decker (bland, the wahl sauce didn't add anything special and the bun got soggy quickly)
Yukon Fries (tasted just like every other restaurant fry)
Onion Rings (best thing we ate)

Total cost $72.00!!!!

I could have got a real dinner for that price and it probably would have been memorable. 

I was also surprised at the bad restaurant arrangement. You don't realize until you sit down that you can order food from the counter to go and their isn't much sitting room. The room is super loud at 4pm. 

Other surprise- the lack of branding and cheap feel of the location. All drinks were served out of plastic and paper cups with no branding. Ketchup was a no-name brand. One wall mural, 1 family picture and a bunch of blank walls where something should be. 

Lastly the location is horrible. Behind all the weird little shops that feel like a flea market. I figured it would be open to the city and you're surround by walls. You'd think they have the money to choose a prime spot. 

Wasn't the experience I was hoping for and I wouldn't go back.

My boyfriend and I had just flown out to Vegas 4th of July weekend which we so happened to stumble upon a sign that said Wahlburger  on the strip and in both our thoughts we were like okay we are definitely going to try this place while we are here. So we made it upon our selfs Friday to walk there to eat when we got the the place it definitely looked packed which it was the wait time was 45 minutes and we definitely did not want to wait that long so we just decided to go the next day (we didn't realize that it has just opened up)So Saturday we go there and it even looked busier then the last day which it was because the wait time now was 1 hour and 45minutes. Definitely was disappointed but we told our selfs that Monday we have to go there since it would be our last full day in Vegas because we were heading back home Tuesday evening. So Monday morning came and we got up early got ready and headed down to see when they opened (9am is when we went there) we found out that they opened at 11am we wanted a burger there so bad and to try it out that we waited all the time so we could be the first people inline. At about 10am the manager peeked his head out to just reassure to us that we knew they opened at 11 and then i responded to him assuring him that we new but we wanted to try the place so bad we didn't mind waiting because the last two days we had tried to come the the restaurant to eat but it was such a long wait. So finally it was 11 and sure enough we were the first people that got to be seated because around 10:20-10:30 a line started forming. Anyways the burger I got was the O.F.D my boyfriend got the double decker we also got sides of sweet potato tots and thin crispy onion rings and two drinks. We got our food so fast after we ordered everything the service I'm giving a 5 star because even when we were eating people who weren't even our server kept walking up to us asking if we needed anything or how everything was. We could not believe how amazing and good of quality the food was, the burgers were cooked so perfect and I highly recommend to anyone that you need to order the thin crispy onion rings they are seriously so goooooood!! And the most amazing part of the experience is that when we asked for our check the waitress told us that the manager wanted us to have it on the house because we waited all the time till they opened. So good service, great food and I liked the atmosphere also everyone must go!

Not at all as one would expect.

Arrived to a 50 minute wait for a table.  Fine, if the food was to die for...but sadly the food was like a truck stop diner on the I-15. 

Waitress was a doll.  Loved her.  My husband and I looked at the menu and were puzzled.  Where are all of the specialty burgers?  Where's all of the pizzaz???  I asked the waitress, ""Stupid question, but, is this the full menu?  I thought there were specialty burgers?""

Sadly, our waitress notified us that this IS the full menu..all 6 or so burgers.  Nothing to write home about (except that they use ""government"" cheese and some Wahl sauce which on one seems to know what it is).

Ordered the BBQ burger with avocado.  Yuck!!! The edges had very clearly been pulled from a pre-cooked 6 pack of buns.  There were tell tale signs of the leftover bread tag from the other buns.  I grabbed it, and, the whole bottom was cold.  Yes, cold.  The burger patty was maybe 1/8 inch thick, crusty and bent, hanging over the smooshed bun.  There was maybe one slice of avocado on the whole burger and even less BBQ sauce.

The fries were old and dry.  The sweet potato tater tots were definitely pre-cooked and frozen.

What we got was two orders of the double decker, and by ""two 3 ounce burgers"" they actually mean two 3 ounce patties so we ended up with twice as much food as we meant to order. When we told our server, he didn't seem to understand the confusion and didn't offer a solution.

Along with what I feel is confusing menu language and a lack of customer service, the mac and cheese was watery and flavorless and the fries were average.

I'm a little shy about trying a celebrity joint because it can be ""overrated"" however I will give it a try when it's recommended by a friend.  

There was a short line, hostess said our wait will be 20 minutes or a table for 3.  Well, we got a text within 5 minutes saying our table was ready.  That was quick.

The menu is pretty basic, burgers, fries, tots, pasta and salad.  They have items that they co-created with other celebrities like P-Diddy (Aqua Hydrate).  I ordered that and it taste like water!

We all ordered the same burger - The ""Our Burger"" with the fixings that we wanted and we all agreed that it was really good and exceeded our expectation.  Hubby ordered regulars fries and he said it was ok, I got the tots extra crispy and I liked it, our friend onion strings and she really liked it but it taste better when it first comes out hot.  

Your burger is cooked to order so sit there and have a good ole' conversation with your peeps and make some memories with selfies while you are there waiting for your food.

I liked that the fountain drinks came with a take home cup with free refills.  They also have desserts but we were stuffed to sample any.

So we finish eating and our bill comes up to be almost $80 for 2 burgers and a kids meal. And we saw they charges $15 for fries. My husband asked to speak with a manager and all she said was that Fries are an extra charge and doesn't come with our $13 burger. We refused to pay for the fries and she had to get her manager and he said the same. No apologies no nothing. We were there for about 20 min going back and fourth about the charge for the fries and they end up taking 1 Fries charge off. Still refusing to pay the manager comes back with SECURITY and a new bill with all Fries off our bill. There was no need for security when he didn't show us the last bill before he called security. The management sucked the waiter was extremely nice but could have let us know side orders are extra. Overall everything on the strip is overpriced period. But my burger was pink when I asked for medium well and they are overpriced. My Fries were cold and tasted as they've been sitting out for a while. Fries are overpriced for a small container.

I was initially put off when our waitress at the bar was so dismissive and super unfriendly.  Being our first visit, when we asked questions, she was very short and only gave yes no answers, didn't make recommendations or offer up anything. All the time were speaking to her, she was looking around and doing other things totally seemed uninterested in providing us any type of service.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger with BBQ sauce on the side, fries and a drink. My friend ordered The Our Burger with bbq sauce and Tater Tots, specifically asked for lettuce and tomato. She took our order and immediately walked away. She didn't ask if that completed our order or anything, when in fact my friend wanted a drink. While we were waiting on our order another nicer friendlier waitress came along and asked if we wanted a drink or water while we waited. 

Our order comes and my BBQ Bacon burger was a bun, with patty and 2 jalapenos. The burger was supposed to have bacon, cheese, avocado spread and bbq sauce. I sent it back. It came back with more jalapenos only. I sent it back again and told them to completely do it over. 

My friend's burger came out with meat, bun and signature wahl sauce. It WAS supposed to have lettuce, tomato (I mentioned earlier that she specifically requested lettuce and tomato), ""government"" cheese and housemade pickles. She also sent her burger back. She got the burger back, still no BBQ. She asked for BBQ and the 1st waitress brought her clearly what was ketchup in a cup. When we told her that is ketchup, she proceed to argue with us and tell us that ""this is ketchup (pointing to the bottle), we don't have ketchup in the cup only bbq sauce!"" We sat the ketchup she gave us and the BBQ sauce that came with my burger side by side to show her the differences that one could clearly. This waitress had the never to say, we make it homemade, so it a bit sweeter today. Seriously! As this conversation is going on I see what appears to be a manager and tell him about the service and the ketchup issue, he apologizes and keeps it pushing. What has happened to customer service?

A gentleman sitting near us ordered the sloppy joe with no onion strings...his sandwich came piled so high with onion strings it was incredible. He was so disgusted and kept shaking his head the entire time he pulled all those onion strings off. They offered to make him another one, he said never mind because it had taken so long to receive the messed up one. 

Once we finally got our burgers right, they were very good, but the service left us unimpressed and not wanting to return or recommend. Just think this place has only been open for 6 weeks. This type of service usually doesn't happen this early in the game. I told my friend, the Walhbergs need to do a drop in on this place as the staff here is ruining the brand.",5WxB8TeJ17GDQ57T7wh1dQ,0,0,2,uBBeZjq9ZTrgoAJEAEEInw

One of my companions ordered the macaroni and cheese and it made me wish I had ordered some for myself, despite the fact that I'm pretty picky about mac and cheese. This was definitely a winner. My companion also have the sloppy joe and said it was very good.

And the place was not even busy - paul please just call me.    773-398-8417

Alma's Mac salad was ok but would t kill you to add salt pepper and maybe just a little garlic? 

The fries were cold and hard and when I asked for some fresh hot ones he came by Lickety split with a fresh batch of cold hard fries in styrofoam cup.    Booooo again boooo I say!!!!!!!

Oh dear walburgers, please come to my backyard and see what really should be on your menu.

We love taking our kids out to new restaurants, but kids in the heat on the strip is really iffy, so you have to choose a restaurant wisely. When we heard that Wahlburgers  was finally open of course we wanted to go down and check it out. They have only been open for 3 days so we called ahead of time and nobody answered the phone, so we just assumed they were busy and that we would just wait and walk around a little bit. Well we get down there 45 minute wait after we just drove 35 minutes to get there. So we're tad bit upset, but there's little shops to go to so it is what it is. The lady at the front who looks so confused by the way tells me to give them my phone number and they'll text me when they're ready. She tells me again it's a 45 minutes wait I don't get a text until an hour and 45 minutes later now at this point I have already gave my kids all their snacks and all 36ozs of water each. So we go inside notice tons of open tablesWe order and wait 25 plus minutes for a kids hamburger, cheese burger sweet potato tots Paul's favorite and the mushroom one with onion strings and fries. The sweet potato tots or disgusting my kids didn't even eat them also my kids hamburgers were burnt my mushroom burger was burnt when I asked for medium and Paul's favorite was crap.

The food itself was good, but I can't say it was the best I ever had especially for the price of the burger/sandwich or whatever you want to call it.  We both tried The Melt (2 @ $12.95,ordered one fry-$4.95, and one strawberry frappe-$7.95. The total was $40! 

I enjoyed the homemade pickles very much and the strawberry frappe was pretty good. 

I say the establishment is snobby because they made us wait 5 minutes to order to-go outside in the cold when the restaurant was at what looked to me like 80% capacity at 8pm on a Tuesday. The bar wasn't full, and a couple tables were clearing up. Then it took another 15 minutes for our to-go food to actually be ready. Other customers also had to wait outside in 40¬∞ for about 15-30 minutes because that's how long the wait to dine in was. 

I didn't anticipate the prices being so high. Menus online showed lower pricing and after wasting time waiting to order I felt obligated to just pay it since my husband and I had been walking the strip for a while looking for something to it.

Service is what I'd expect for where the location is. Which is not terrible but also not friendly or attentive.
Prices are ridiculous and really not worth what you get. For 4 people we paid $85 because each burger is 11-15 dollars AND THAT'S JUST THE BURGER. $5 for friends (and any other side) is just ridiculous. Especially because the fries come out cold and soggy. Really unreasonable and over priced for the low quality tastelessness.
I got a melt with my friend and it was perfect. I have no complaints and neither did she. Cooked perfectly. Seasoned beautifully. Just the taste and the juiciness, so awesome. I would splurge just to get that again (with no side)
However the other two guests I was with hated their burgers. They weren't as juicy and it was comparable to a fast food burger. I don't remember the exact title but one of them got a BBQ burger that had Bleu cheese sauce. And one got some Latin inspired one with heat and spice. I tried both and I wasn't impressed. When we gave them a taste of our melts, they were envious! We also had sweet potato tots which were very awkward and tastless.
Overall, the melt is the only thing I enjoyed. I can't get over how much the sides are. You'd think with $12 burgers they would come with fries. Nope!",xTimtxT3p1zKrtfP9JRuZA,1,0,2,bkaFhXAR506nM7hwX2Ewew

The Mac and Cheese taste like a cup of plain penne noodles with some chunks of bacon on top.  It had absolutely zero flavor.  For reference, I have a bland palate, so for me to think something has no flavor is pretty bad.

Drinks we just ok, but at least we could consume those.

Server never asked us how the food was or asked if we wanted boxes for the food we hardly touched.

Detroit actually *just* got a Wahlburgers recently, but we were in line for Burgr (Gordon Ramsay restaurant at Planet Hollywood) and were quoted an hour, so we decided to check this out - I went with a Yelper who now lives in Vegas, and his girlfriend.

There are really only 3 burger choices which surprised me ... okay, maybe 4 - the plain burger, the regular burger (essentially the plain burger but with cheese), the double burger, and the triple. I got the plain burger and added tomatoes and pickles, plus mushrooms ($1 upcharge). We ordered the onion strings (yes, strings) and the sweet potato tots too to split.

My burger was overall fine, nothing special but that Wahlburgers sauce is really good. Almost reminded me of In-N-Out's sauce, actually. The onion strings were good but the sweet potato tots were fantastic, so I'd get those next time. The burger will cost you about $9.99-$10.99 and sides are $4.99.

We were walking the strip and I insisted coming here for lunch, as I never seem to make it to the newly opened one in Detroit and heard good things about it. There was a wait, but we were able to sit at the bar and not have to wait for the table. Bartenders ignored us for practically 15 minutes then played it off like they thought we were still looking at the menu and said ""are you ready to order?"". Really? Our menus were put down on the bar 10 minutes ago. To be fair, after that, service was much better.

We split the double burger and tater tots and ordered 2 beers. On the menu, the double burger sounded like it was big enough to split. That was not the case. For like $11 you get a burger smaller than a Big Mac. Flavor was OK, but the bottom bun fell apart making it really messy to eat. Tater tots were lukewarm and tasted previously frozen with no salt. Would not get again.

What's weird is 1) there's no bathroom inside 2) they have photographers who come around snapping pictures of couples, printing it out and bringing it over hoping you pay the million dollars for it.

Way too much going on... music blasting so loud that you can't even hear the person next to you talking. Is this a restaurant or a nightclub/bar?? I paid way too much tonight just to have a mediocre burger and fries. 

I mean the burger had nothing special about it. I had 2 pickle rounds on it, which is something McDonald's does to me. A $10 burger should have a decent amount of pickles or a side pickle at least?  The bun was really soft and it tasted good but just nothing special about it. DEFINITELY not a $10 burger. 

Everything is just rushed.

I'm especially upset about the Caesar salad - I REPEAT, DO NOT GET THE CAESAR SALAD. It's very hard to mess up a salad but boy that was the most watered down Caesar dressing I ever had! It's like they had regular Caesar dressing, then some bimbo decided to add another cup of water to it and drizzle that over the salad. 

As for the service - our girl was okay. Nothing special. Gave me a weird vibe the whole time like she knew me and didn't like me, but smiled anyways. We still tipped her well. She checked up on us a lot. 

The only thing that really ticked me off was that I asked if they did ""SIDE SALADS"" she said yes. But she apparently misinterpreted what I had said and got me a regular full size salad - again, probably because the music was so loud we have to scream at each other. So I paid $7 for the shittiest Caesar salad that I ever put into my mouth (and I didn't even want that much of it, I was expecting a small 1/2 cup of lettuce, not a full plate.... that's what SIDE salad means) 

Also, the food runner girl didn't give us all of our food when she came out. She said ""okay, anything else I can do for you folks?"" Uhhh yeah ma'am you forgot all of our sauces that we ordered, and fries, and we ordered pickles on the side and you didn't bring any of that. 

So long story short, we won't be back and will not be recommending this place to anyone. Maybe if I paid a decent lower price I'd be more easy going on the review.... but hell no. If I'm paying $50 for a couple burger & fries, it better be a damn good burger and fry.",WprLWLMfdlbstGuCQvUHJQ,3,0,2,ocyx2rWh_tQbmB2Ndpu7MQ

Get seated and it's noisy. Hard to hear the misses who's seated less than 2 feet in front of me. Waiter came up, took drink order. I ordered the Arnold Palmer, please whatever you do watch out, the lemonade is a home brew and very bitter. It made my son made the bitter face. So I  ordered a regular iced tea. It's on ice but, it is butt warm. You'd think you order something that is supposed to be could would be cold not warm. Is the beer cold? 

Ordered our food and we had it faster than we were seated. Can someone answer that? 

Received our food and it was very good. I think for the price of the single sandwiches things like fries or onion rings should be included. 

After our food came we never saw our waiter or our server during our visit. 

Overall my / our experience is below average. I know it's  Vegas and it's for the tourists and its, for some a once in a lifetime chance to eat at Wahlburgers I think they should offer a discount of some sort for us Vegas locals.

We got seated and were served by a waitress who seemed annoyed with life. Fine - we all have bad days. The food was awful. Even my kids - 9 and 3 years old - complained about it. Cold bread that looks like it's from a pack that you buy in a ""warehouse"" store. Cold, tasteless meat that tasted pre-cooked. Yuck. Portions are small, and we paid $13-$15 only for each burger. Fries, onion rings, etc. are extra. I had the BBQ Bacon burger. Less than average. Finished in four bites, and I wouldn't have eaten it if I wasn't starving. My husband had what I think was called the ""fiesta"" burger, but I literally can't remember since the only introduction to it (when we asked for something spicy) was when the waitress brought over a napkin holder from another table and held it up to us so we could read the burger's description. Spice level was ok, but again, small and cold. The cheese in both burgers was cold and strangely chunky... Like nacho cheese dip that had sat out too long. We ordered onion rings and fries. They were average at best. I was genuinely sad that it sucked so bad. I'm shocked that it is so packed. I could only imagine it is for the name. Really, I'd be humiliated if my family name was on this restaurant. If the family really cares about the quality of the food and the satisfaction of their customers, they need to regroup. Oh, and our waitress couldn't care less about our disappointment. The only joy we had was when we took photos of the family on the wall and put snapchat filters on them.

For side, the onion ring was very good. Instead of big  thick rings, they were small strands of battered onion almost looking like calamari. Love it!

But despite ordering a wide swath of the menu, most dishes had execution issues: the thin-cut onion rings were arguably the best dish we tried, but were served cold. The patty melt we ordered featured unmelted ""government"" cheese and an overcooked patty, not sure how the kitchen managed that unless the patties are precooked. The house-made pickles and Wahl sauce were tasty, but not enough to save that burger. Added on Alma's Famous Macaroni per raves from other reviews, belatedly realizing this was a pasta salad. It was fresh with lots of chopped vegetables but seemed to be missing something in the unbalanced flavors. Tried to end our meal on a high note with a spiked milkshake, but the Fluffanuttah didn't look or taste at all like the menu description.

We went on Tuesday night around 930pm. We sat to the left of the hostess stand where there are 6 tables. Two were empty and two were sat the other looked like they were leaving, and us. I like to review places that ive visited honestly and completely. 
We sat for 12 minutes when a girl came and said, are you ready to order. Just that. I was already mad that no one said one word to us at all after she sat us.  So we ordered, and to make a long story short, it wasnt a good experience. We waited, and waited then the burgers came, no sides. Burgers were cold for sure. 5 mins later the two sides came but we were just about done. It seemed like they kept changing servers.???... 
no one came back over, not once for 22 minutes when the guy took my dish and left the check. 
Again, trying to be fair, I did leave 10 tip on 47 bill. It hurt to do that VERY VERY much. The whole time they sat another table, that table ate and left, and I finally waved down the check. 
I expected SO much more from them. My son, who thinks im overly critical of everywhere, was so pissed off at the whole experience. 
I may go back again to see if that was s fluke or not. The only thing that was hot was the onion rings and we never got the sauce, mayo or a drink refill, which my son usually has a couple.  Im sad by this experience because I feel like Paul would feel terrible with the way the meal went. I cant imagine his quality, for his food, is what we received. I know chefs, doesnt matter how big you are, your food and the reproductions of it, come from the heart and any bad one is like a knife to the heart.

The Beast is appropriately named as it is stacks multiple patties with pulled pork. For those wondering, The Beast is 1 burger, not 2, as the menu could confuse you to believe. But yea The Beast has got my mouth watering just thinking about it....super flavorful and juicy...it's straight up dripping with the appropriate amount of tender fatty goodness. As for the onion strings, I'm just a fan of onion strings in general so when fried up right, I'm a happy camper. The Ranch and Wahlburger sauce aren't that good though...they have a strange flavor that don't complement the onion strings or fries...I'm sticking with the Heinz ketchup. Everything else on the menu might as well not exist since The Beast and onion strings are all I need. Enjoy!",hKhtmwXxBbUtM53HwJir0A,2,1,4,rEiFupoXz6cz3b8j5S1eLw

Surprisingly, my only favorite thing served at this celebrity-owned burger joint is.... the delicious homemade chili. The chili is super-flavorful and packed with the thickness of ground meat and saaaaauce. 

Don't get me wrong, we tried one of the basic burgers, which was nicely presented- almost like a ""fake tv commercial burger"" that looks too good to be true. The burger was okay. I will give major props in the fact that the bun stayed intact throughout and up until my last bite. Nothing grinds my tires like when I am on my second to my last bite on a delicious burger and the burger bun starts falling apart. How rude? Anyone else hates when this happens. The buns served here at Wahlburgers are pretty legit; nice and spongey. 

Let's not forget that I also tried the Cobb Salad. Holy shnikey's! This salad can feed four and any of their best friends. This ensalada is HUGE, and very plentiful.

Okay food, so much okay that I'm not running back for seconds when there's a shake shack down the street.",8drMKNHWavs2g6uf0pLtvg,25,23,3,kz4VmQmHPPcN9PeZ1wioQw

Went in around 1230am & it wasn't too busy. The wait to sit down was around 15-30 mins so we opted for the takeout order and sat outside at Starbucks. 

We ordered the: 
Our burger- it was nothing spectacular, it was a basic cheeseburger with LTO, pickles & their special wahl sauce. We've had better burgers for a cheaper price ( In-N-Out or Red Robin). It honestly lacked in the flavor part. I did like that they use FRESH lettuce and it was shredded. I hate when I get burgers with wilted/warm lettuce and the freshness of it made a difference. 

French Fries- regular fries, there was a light seasoning on it and I wish they had a little more on it because it probably would've gave the fries more flavor and taste more than just a regular frozen fries from a bag.

Onion Rings- thin strings of battered onions fried and seasoned. It was a very generous portion but nothing phenomenal about it. It was kind of soft and which I think of onion rings, I don't imagine it being soft. Read all these reviews of it being the best ever and it didn't live up to the hype. I wish it came with a sauce of some sort to dip it in, it probably would make a difference. 

Overall, it was an alright experience but I do think it was overpriced for what we got. I had such high hopes for this place because I love their tv show & always heard good things of this place. 
Maybe we came on a bad night??

2232969,2017-10-04,4,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Before I start this review, a small disclaimer.  This is a review for the restaurant just after it opened and this is for the smaller Las Vegas location outside of Bally's.

I want to like this place.  Hell, I want to love it!  I am originally from the Boston area, I have watched the show from the beginning and I love the concept of the Wahlberg family starting their own burger chain.  That being said, we didn't have a great experience here even though we were really excited to try it out.  When we got there, it was fairly late so there was only one couple walking in, in front of us.  We thought, great...   no line when we were expecting one.  We sat at the bar area.  There were people walking here and there doing behind-the-bar things and saw us sitting there, but they literally chose to ignore us.  I don't know if it was the timing of our visit or they had had a long day or what, but I always give servers and/or bartenders the benefit of the doubt.

We had to have been sitting there for 15 mins. or more before we stood up and had to find a copy of their menu that was sitting down the bar.   This prompted one of them to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered a couple of beers and thought that would be the start of good service.  Nope.  We sat waiting until we finished our beers (another 15 mins. or more) before anyone came back over to ask if we wanted food.  We finally were able to order and our burgers did come out pretty fast.  Too fast it seems, as our burgers were both very rare although we ordered medium.  We were too hungry at this point - and frankly a little scared to complain - to send them back for more firing.

Again, I want to love this place and I am a very easy-going, benefit-of-the-doubt, Elite Yelper who doesn't like to complain but this type of service was really bad.  I am sure this restaurant wouldn't hire employees who simply didn't care or didn't know how to cook so I have to chalk this one up to bad time, or employees at the end of their shift who have had a long, tiring day.


The Good:

Cool restaurant design
Wahlberg name
Okay beer selection
Great food presentation


The Bad:

Wait time
Customer service
Food not cooked to order

The Ugly:

Location (among cheap shops in front of Bally's casino)
Rare burger meat when asked for Medium",4uJXindoZlYPawRRJp4LZQ,14,7,3,95IDNhrGNnTPnOL9c9Pu1w

My husband and I had never been so we wanted to look over the drink menu. The moment our butts hit the seat the bartender asked what we wanted to drink. We asked her for a moment, a minute barely passed and she was back. So we both rush and just order not wanting to keep being rushed. This was the first annoying thing. We wanted to see all the cool drinks they might have but she didn't give us a chance to read the menu. 

Once we order the drinks we turn our attention to the food menu. Again, wanting to look over all the specialty burgers and such. Barely getting threw 3 burgers she asks if we are ready to order. We ask her for a few more minutes. She comes back with our drinks and waters and asks again. Again a minute pasted... maybe. So we just ordered the first thing we saw. 

This was disappointing. We were being rushed, from the moment we sat down to the moment we officially ordered it had been maybe 4 minutes and this is with turning her down a few times. 

The food came and it was pretty good. The bartender checked up on us and asked about refills. When we finished we got the check and was shocked at the prices. The beer was so expensive and apparently fries don't come with your $14 burger. The food was good but the experience was bad and the price was way to high for the food quality. I don't plan on ever going back.

We arrived at about 12:45 p.m.  they had a hostess outside taking names on their iPad.  Our wait was about 5-10 minutes for a party of two.  They are located in front of Bally's casino.  They have bar, indoor and outdoor seating.  When submitting our name for the waitlist, they ask what your seating preference is.  We asked for first available.  Our seat was outside next to the railing.  Downfall of this is people waiting for a seat lean on the railing overlooking the table.  Not cool while you are eating and conversing with your company.  It was a lil chilly too.  They had heaters outside, but those seated on the railing didn't get any heat.  That aside I ordered the Paul Fav burger.  Which is called the ""our burger"" on the menu.  The burger is very good.  They make their own pickles and I liked the flavor of them on the burger.   The cheese is ""government"" cheese which is what they grew up eating.  If you don't know what that  is, well that just means you weren't poor growing up.  I, on the other hand, knew exactly what kind of cheese they put on their burgers.  Burgers automatically have cheese and if you don't want to pay the extra price then you have to specify ""no cheese"" otherwise you'll get cheese.  Paul's special sauce is delicious.  The burger is well put together and fresh!  Everything is al a carte so you'll have to pay for fries, tots, onion rings, etc.  burger was $10.99 each and one order of fries was $4 ish.  We shared an ordered and it was plenty for sharing.  Fries were ok, nothing to write home about, but still good and not greasy.

My son and daughter both had chicken tenders they were dry and the waiter offered nothing but ketchup to put on them it also tasted like the fryer grease has not been cleaned since they opened. It leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth.
We ordered drinks too and had them gone immediately but we were never offered any refills. The menu said they had a burger of the day but when I inquired about it the waiter said the restaurant didn't do specials and was rather snippy about it.

I would not drive to the strip and deal with parking just to eat here, but if I were already on the strip, and Bobby's Burger Palace and Holstein's were both closed, and there was zero wait, I would come eat here again. 

The Our Burger tasted like what a I remember a Big Mac to taste like, the bun was very soggy and it pretty much fell apart. Also, we asked for something to cut the burgers in half, but never for a knife so we used a  plastic spoon to half it, which probably didn't help. 

The Thanksgiving burger was okay. It was a little bland, needed more acidity in the cranberry sauce maybe? Wouldn't order again. 

Best part of the Mac and cheese was the bacon; otherwise it was on the watery side and also a little bland. Definitely not worth $8.95",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,11,4,3,lyEZSTiyQa9L3_cxr7sv0Q

The food, however, was a disappointment.  The impossible burger was something that I could've skipped especially at around $19.  It was a bit off on flavor and doesn't live up to the hype.

This was before fries, which we did order and had to send back because they were cold and we asked for fresh ones.  With a drink everything came out to around $35.

Way overpriced. All burgers come with nothing. Most were about $13. However the veggie burger was $19!  Sides were $5 & were not as big as you would think for the price.  Soda is $5.

All drinks are served in disposable looking cups. I can't imagine all the garbage being created.

Only thing i would say is they definitely should try seasoning the patties,  but they were definitely still good, just needed some seasoning and it would be that final touch. 

Definitely cant wait to come back and eat here. They give u your soda drinks in a souvounier  cup for 4.95 but hey that was cool. It looks like u can ask for it in a regular  disposable cup if u wanted to but really why would u want that? I love my cup. 

This lady came to our table and took me and my husbands picture for something. Im guessing a board or something. Not sure but we didnt see her after that. She was going table to table so must of been something for the wall or something.

We sat at the bar and were greeted right away by the bartender who gave us excellent service the whole time. They have several big TV's around the bar, ideal for watching sports.

They have a signature ""Wahlbrewski"" beer on tap, so obviously we each had to try that. It was a  light brown ale, crisp & a touch of sweetness. Easy to drink, goes well with burgers.

My husband got the ""Our Burger"" (Paul's favorite) - a classic cheeseburger and I got the portobello sandwich as a chopped salad bowl (you can get any of their burgers/sandwiches chopped up and tossed with mixed greens for no extra cost - I love having this option!). All of the toppings on both of our orders were fresh and plentiful. We also got a side of the thin crispy onion rings - so thin & yummy! We both really enjoyed our meals!

It's like going to Five Guys but waiting to be seated, with a bar. The decor is very casual, which is why i was perplexed at the necessity of a host. But, given that there were a lot of people i do understand the need to control traffic. I sat at the bar and didn't have to wait. But if i needed a table it was a 15 minute wait. The curiosity of going to a celebrity's restaurant lured most people in. The desire for me to eat something quick and new was what lured me in. It was when i got there that i learned of the Wahlberg Family. I do recommend trying it but be warned that portion sizes don't match their prices.

I ordered ""The Our Burger"" (when in Rome, am I right) and my boyfriend ordered the O.F.D. with a side of tater tots to share. let me make note, i do not like American aka ""government"" cheese so I wasn't really sure how i would like my burger but we were both blown away. He went dead silent from the moment he took a bite and when he finally came up for air all he could say was, ""wow"". Mine was also amazing - juicy, flavorful, perfectly cooked. and the tots were the perfect amount of crispy! 

Driving the the strip is such a pain but i'll definitely be returning!",yfiCKqdrk_i9Pa7ochyWtg,3,1,5,mSQncjoAAfp0umG4uQEDCg

My portabello burger was sloppy and I even requested the extra sauteed mushrooms on the side. The carmelized onions were way too sweet.
The sweet potato tots also werent cooked enough and so were soft and soggy as well.

The cashier, girls prepping food and manager were all so sweet, but we waited almost 20 minutes to get our food. It honestly was not THAAAT crowded, they kept mixing up the to-go orders with the sitdown orders. It seemed like the servers in the sit down area were annoyed with the crowd waiting in the to-go section,there was no where to wait really so we were in their way.

As far a cleanliness, they could sure step it up. There was trash on the floor and the condiments section was a mess. The servers would leave their cups and water bottles around where guests can see - I know it was the servers because I saw them put them down and take them once they headed to the back.

Thank goodness this place wasn't too packed, well at least in the bar area. We sat directly because we didn't want to wait for most around 20-25 minutes just for burgers & fries. 

We waited until a bartender asked if we already being help. I ordered the chicken fingers with fries, with a coke and my husband ordered the salad bowl with burgers on top. 

The chicken fingers was just ordinary taste, fried perfect, but the fries was way too overcooked and the inside was empty so pretty kinda hard bite. 
The salad bowl was okay, nothing special about it. 

Inside of the restaurant was pretty hot, it'd be nice if they turn the AC higher or put a fan near the bar area.

After viewing the menu I realized there weren't any turkey burgers served. I wasn't in the mood for a portobello mushroom burger, so I tried the Mac&cheese and an order of fries. It sounded appealing on the menu with multiple cheese's throughout it. And you can't go wrong with French fries. Boyyyyyy I was so wrong. The fries were cold and oily which was disappointing. So, I dove into the Mac& cheese all for it to be completely cold. For it to have four different cheese's in it I couldn't tell at all. I made the waitress aware of my displeasure about my order. She brought me back a different cup of m&c that was drier then the first order. I was done after that as I usually don't send my food back to the kitchen. Paulie was right when he said the quality of the food might suffer if they opened to many chains. $13 bucks for fries and four bites of m&c.

2811913,2017-01-29,10,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Ummm no. Just no. The Wahlberg brothers need to rethink this business investment. Let me preface this by saying that I didnt look at any reviews before deciding to eat here although I did notice the 3 star average when I checked in. I always form my own opinion after checking the place out regardless of Yelp ratings.

Located in the Grand Bazaar shops outside of Bally's Hotel Casino, the place looked packed when we came in on a saturday night around 8 pm. We were told that our party of four was a 15 to 30 minute wait. I gave the hostess my cell number so that she could text or call me when a table opened up. We walked around looking at some of the stores. Got a text 10 mins later so off we went.

Was sat down in a booth pretty much right in front of the counter where all the food was placed when done cooking. I got the Bbq Bacon Burger, my son got the Jenn's Chicken Sandwich, and my friend got the Double Decker. We decided to get Tots, Sweet Potato Tots, and Thin Crispy Onion Rings to share.

The Bbq Bacon Burger ($12.95), has a 1/3 pound beef patty, white cheddar, bacon, fresh jalapenos, house made bbq sauce and avocado spread. The waiter asked me how I wanted it cooked so I said medium rare. Burger was decent and was actually cooked how I wanted it. Didnt really wow me at any given point. Hardly any jalapenos and the bbq sauce was just ok. 

My son opted to have the Jenn's Chicken Sandwich ($11.95) as a salad for you have the option of making any sandwich or burger a salad with no price difference. The grilled chicken was cut up into small chunks, was tossed with mixed greens, carmelized onions, crisp onions, and house made honey garlic mayo. My son was not wowed either by the salad. I took a couple of bites and I agreed with him. It was no better than a basic caesar salad with grilled chicken.

The Double Decker (12.95) has two 3 ounce beef patties, lettuce, tomato, onion, ""government cheese"", Paul's signature Wahl sauce, and housemade pickles. It was basically a slider with two beef patties. My  friend finished it quick for it wasnt really all that big to begin with. She said that it tasted kind of like a White Castle burger. Thats not a compliment by the way.

The Yukon Gold Fries, Sweet Potato Tater Tots, and Thin Crispy Onion Rings ($4.95 each) were all very disappointing. All were lukewarm. Tots and fries were almost to the point of being soggy. Needless to say we only only ate about a quarter of the all 3 sides before realizing that it just wasnt all that appetizing. Just remember nothing on the menu comes as a combo meaning you dont  get a side and a drink with your burger. That blows. It only means that you are spending even more for a la carte items.

Service was just ok. Took awhile before our server would come around to ask if we needed anything. Not sure if he was pre occupied with so many other tables but I noticed plenty of servers walking around everywhere.

In closing, I dont think the 65 bucks I spent for mediocre burgers and lukewarm bland sides was worth it. Oh, did I mention that the soda I got was $3.95? How is a soda almost as much as an appetizer? The one thing that really bothered me was that I noticed that they already have the sides cooked ahead of time and are placed under heat lamps. This was in plain sight from where we sat. No wonder they were lukewarm and almost to the point of being soggy. I usually take home any leftover items so as not to waste any food but this rare occasion, we didnt want to take any of the sides home. Lastly, Bally's is in the process of putting up parking meters in their parking structure. Yay, more expenses before you even step foot out your car. Im putting this place in my ""One and Done"" portfolio. Not coming back and I dont recommend you even trying it for yourself. Go somewhere else that is worthy of their burgers and sides.

It is a casual dining place which is kind of nice - ""to go"" type cups with a top and a straw, and food served in baskets. Definitely a fast place to go in and out. 

I got the BBQ bacon burger and sweet potato tots which were tasty. I'm not going to say it was the best burger I've ever had in my life or anything life changing, but it was pretty good. The avocado spread on the burger added good flavor, especially with the white cheddar and balanced out the jalapenos on it.

Our server Dakota was super friendly and efficient. Very good service. I'm not sure why people are complaining that it's expensive here-- $12.00 for a burger in Vegas is pretty cheap to me!",506keshsLa102eajCtaZ_A,0,1,4,b6QJGbFpKz6m6PAis2mSJw

A few trips back, we got 1/2 our drink order, with the shakes missing.  The shakes came about 10 min after the sodas came and they were pretty melted like they had been sitting.  The food came shortly after.  We got the BBQ burger (Donnie's fav), ""our burger"", kids hot dog, and kids cheeseburger.  My burger wasn't really hot and the cheese looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp for a long time.  The BBQ sauce was really good though.  Other than that, I wish we would have gone somewhere else.  It's not worth the price and the service was just meh.  You live and you learn.

My husband and I went in on a Saturday night around 6:30 and to our surprise got seated in less than 5 minutes. However, it took about 10 minutes for a server to come and take our order. Since we had waited so long, we knew exactly what we wanted and placed the order along with our drinks. Drinks came out in about 5 minutes but the food took over 25 minutes. We actually thought the server forgot about us. 

Once the food came out, my husband noticed they did not grill the onions like he had asked. And the meat on our hamburgers were quite pink. The server never asked how we wanted the meat cooked, so we assumed it was going to be cooked all the way thru. We still ate the burgers, and did like it, however I would've preferred the patty be cooked a little bit more. The tater tots were pretty good, crispy and well seasoned.

I'm only giving a 4 star because I was not impressed with the price. The basic burgers were overpriced at $9.95 and add ons were $1.00 more each (cheese, grilled onions). And they did not come with a side. Sides were $4.95. I also ordered a root beer and that was $4.95. Totally ridiculous! I wasn't eating at a gourmet restaurant, it was more like a sit down fast food restaurant. So the pricing was a bit too much.

Needless to say, we won't be returning anytime soon unless they include a side with the burgers. I could easily go to another burger place and order a cheeseburger and fries for less than $10.",Y1V1Kf5iRensrsToUxvTUg,0,0,4,2fSv4sFuFPi47mlVziRkSg

Once inside it was clear that was not correct as a mother staff member sent us to the hostess who was inside chatting with 3 other employees. Once seated things didn't get much better the waiter failed to let us know about the new burgers (we discovered them on a sign after ordering, my friend is a vegetarian so we quickly asked to change her salad to the impossible burger). While waiting for our food staff seemed to be doing nothing but standing around chatting. When our food arrived the burgers were delish but my tots were a soggy mess and my friend's fries had zero seasoning to them.

The burger is pedestrian at best, and worth no more than $6; Ol' Marky Marky and his funky burger bunch'll charge you nearly double anyway. There's not enough salt, not enough decadence, and the burger is too dense. This ""government cheese"" motif got carried away with itself, and now your payin' Hollywood prices for ""government meat"" too; do we ever know what's in our burgers? I know what they all say, but who knows?

I'll tell you something though - I don't know how these goofballs did it, but their sweet-potato tots are a stroke of fuckin' genius! Give me a bucket of those, a handgun, and a masters collection of Wahlberg movies, and I'll show you a Saturday night proper!

$15 in on a burger and tots, and immediately I forgot the burger. Those tots will haunt you though. Why didn't I think of that!?! Oh well. They're building one in Kansas City this summer, so I'll keep you updated on whether they're price-gouging Vegas tourists, or if they're in-fact across-the-country delusional. Fat Burger down the street does it better for less money, if that's the sort of thing you're into. In-N-Out's customer service and flavor simplicity decimates Whalburgers - and against Whataburger's flavor and value, it's not even a contender.

Kansas City is already oversaturated with great burger options, so we'll see how quick they shutdown; if they bring that same nonsense I wasted my stomach on in Vegas to KC, It'll be swift and uneventful. I stopped in Alabama for my first Whalburgers, and they told me it would be an hour and a half wait!?! What? Not for a burger. No sir. Freddy's KC makes a spectacular steakburger, Chicago dog, custard shake, and a basket of fries in 5 minutes - In-N-Out does that in half the time.

Maybe they should go back to basics of making a great burger instead of trying to be in every market or the world.

Insult to injury, just got our bill.  Was told the manager gave us a discount; but they dont have managers which is what the supervisor told me.  Our discount was a generic mall employee discount and then an employee discount.

My wife ordered a salad with grilled chicken she gave me the thumbs up (she's hard to please) so this is a good sign.

I would recommend Wahlburgers to anyone wanting an above average burger experience. 

Did I mention they have a full bar?",oX4qeKApLJh3syRpOw9DOg,0,1,5,4-DzB8Aok-7GKBY57nWEEg

The burgers are surprisingly delicious and filling. It's crowded every time I've come but I can usually always find a spot at the bar right away. The prices are high but the burgers make up for it, so does the staff. The bartenders are very attentive, especially Courtney who has waited on me numerous times.

I just got their basic burger on a gluten free bun. The bun was a little big for just one burger, but it still was delicious. Good quality meat, and I really enjoyed that after I ate their burger I didn't feel like I ate a pile of grease. The tots were fine - they weren't anything exciting, but that's OK. 

By husband got the OFD burger and enjoyed it. It may had bacon and lots of toppings, but he really liked it and would definitely get it again. 

We got their grilled cheese sandwich for our son and it was a perfect size with plenty of cheese - he was definitely pleased with all the cheese!

It was good. I will definitely go back again and try one of their signature burgers instead of just their basic burger. They also have gluten free buns, bread and croutons, so I think a patty melt is in order! And they have the classic MA lobster roll buns browned on the flat top with some butter on it, so if you want a hot dog, I'm sure it is great!",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,1,0,3,5_zzfNUL08HD4mh7l8rA-w

My dreams were shot down during my visit. We were told the wait would be about 35 minutes but it was actually only about 15, score right? Well that was the only good thing. We were seated and greeted about 3 minutes later by a super nice waiter, we asked for ice tea only to be told they didn't have any today. BUMMER. We ordered 2 waters and a cherry coke. 2 of us ordered ""the our burger"" one with french fries and one with tater tots, my mom got the ""dads basic burger"" with a side of thin crispy onion straws. Our wait for the food was about 20 minutes which isn't to bad except it was all ice cold and everything we wanted off or on our burgers was incorrect, the internal temperatures were also wrong. On try two, 2 of the burgers toppings were correct but one was still wrong and my burger was still raw and not well done so it went back a third time, when it came back it was all of the sudden a double cheeseburger with everything on it. I kindly asked for a takeout box to take it to my husband because i wasn't trying it a 4th time. I understand that they have been open for under two weeks but I refuse to believe it's this hard to get hamburgers correct, I mean it's a small menu and I refuse to believe that the kitchen is still working out the kinks. The manager did take my burger off the bill and then cut the remaining bill in half and it was still $23. The real total would have been over $60 for 3 burgers and 3 sides and one soda.

Located outside Balley's Wahlburger has a togo stand close to the strip sidewalk and a sit down full service bar farther back in front of Balley's.   We went to the sit down full service spot cuz at 106 degrees outside we were seeking shelter from the Vegas heat.  I was expecting a cafeteria style setup but found out it was full service with servers waiting on you and bringing your food to the table.

The menu consisted of sides, salads, burgers and some sammies.  I tried the Sloppy joe which was soft open faced bread covered in a sweet meaty joe sauce and topped with cheese sauce and crispy onion strings.  The joe was delicious and fairly filling at $11.95.  We also had a order of onion strings which were crispy sweet red onion perfection at $4.95.  Wifey had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger  with avocado and jalepeno $12.95.  My wife was underwhelmed by the 1/3 pound burger and probably should have ordered a larger burger.  Soft drinks are $4.95 but come in a hard plastic collectible cup, which makes for a nice free souvenir.  A photo person also comes around and takes a free photo in the hopes of up selling you a souvenir photo.

Atmosphere: Modern and appealing!
The decor is modern with green accents. Definitely engaging with the modern-imagery. Nothing overwhelming, but many nice imagery and banners to look at in the restaurant.

Service: Nothing to complain about
We were served in a timely manner and our server was polite.

Food: Very nice!
Had the burger, onions rings, and macaroni and cheese. Everything was served warm, too! The burger was fresh and juicy. The onion rings, although not traditional, were still seasoned nicely and had their own type of soft yet definite crisp to them. The mac'n cheese was nice as well: seasoned and cheesy!

As for parking.  We parked at Ballys and the rates were 0 to 60 minutes: Free, 1 to 4 Hours: $7.  It was a short walk through the casino to get there.

We had 2 burgers, tots, onion rings and 2 drinks.  Bill was $50.

The food was decent, but nothing to write home about.  For half the price, we could have eaten at Shake Shack or In-N-Out and have been just as happy with equally or better food.

I have now eaten here once and would only go again if it were the one in Massachusetts.

First off, these are the most attentive bartenders I have ever seen. They are on top of everyone's drinks and ensure the bar is clean, something I always look at behind a bar. 

I ordered the BBQ Bacon and it was pretty good, but the jalapeno's were raw, which was strange. Grilled jalapenos would have provided a much better flavor. The bread was good and the meat cooked perfectly.

The onion rings were so bland. Even after adding a lot of salt, they were so bland and definitely not worth the additional $5. The bartender noticed that I did not even touch them...I thought he was going to take it off the ticket, but he didn't.

The Cucumber Lemonade was perfect. Very flavorful, but I don't know if it was worth $13. If it cost $8-9, I probably would have ordered another one. The Sam Adams was a tad on the flat side.

This place is WAY too expensive for what you get, especially considering how it is hidden from the strip. With a strip view, I could totally see paying these high prices, but not in this small, tucked in a corner location. For a burger, onion rings, 2 drinks, and tip it cost me $44.

For a Saturday, we didn't have to wait very long for our table. We sat at a table under a big umbrella and sipped our adult beverages from the bar while we waited. They text  the person who's name the party is under when a table is ready.  It was about 40 minutes, but we knew they may have a wait so we  laughed and caught up  with each other while we waited. 
   
The  staff was very friendly, like meeting old friends. They took our orders and got everything right. The atmosphere is homey and fun,  like getting a  picnic table with friends  at a big party.  There are photos of the family everywhere . Lots of homages to each of the Wahlberg brothers and the rest of their family.  I especially enjoyed that they were playing 80s music inside. That was fun!

 The food was really good. I am one to enjoy an occasional greasy burger. I love it!  It made the flavor just burst in my mouth. Nothing was dry. It was just right. The cheese was right on time. We each ordered a side so we can taste a little of everything. The chilli was  on point. I loved the onion straws too. I really    I also had an adult smoothie. Get the S'MORES one! It's like the best chocolate milk ever! Smooth, delicious and  you can't taste the liquor.  

  We took lots of photos and had a really nice time.. 

It's so good, that I am going again tonight with out of town friends who are visiting. This is going to be the hot spot to meet friends and have fun when they visit!  You can also check out the merchandise store a  short walk away closer to the strip.  T-shirts, mugs, key chains, that sort of thing. I guess I know what everyone's getting this holiday season.

I gotta say though, if a server asks ME if medium is ok for my burger, it BETTER come out medium. Cuz if that's what the kitchen is trained to do, so much so that the server says ""that's how we prepare them"", I consider it complete bs to get a well-done burger. At a BURGER place. Oh, and the Our Burger is the owner's favorite according to the menu so that's what I wanted to try. It's small...and $13. I think it's about the size of a famous star from Carls. Much better tasting, but definitely tiny for $13 a-la-carte burger. And did I mention it came out well-done? 

I'm a big fan of the show and respect the Wahlbergs for building a dynasty, but I think Paul would have been disappointed had he been sitting with me.

So I decided, why not I had a couple hours before launching out of town, so I stopped in. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes but that was mainly due to it being a busy Sunday.

I had the Original Burger, added Bacon, and ordereed the Onion Rings. The food came out quick and at first glance looked really tasty. The Burger was cooked exactly how I like it, the bacon was crispy, not over done, and all the vegetables (lettuce tomato, pickles,) looked fresh and healthy. The onion rings came out in a separate Basket which is large enough to share with probably two other people. 

The Burger was great. Cooked correctly, had lots of flavor and was close to something I would make at home on a grill. I had no complaints. The onion rings, were not as good as I expected. They were crisp, but really salty. I could not even taste the onion. The batter they use was light but so salty that is all you tasted was salted batter. Hence the loss of a star. 

I would really rate this place a 3 and 1/2 stars. The service was a little light. I do understand the place was busy but my server disappeared after my order arrives and really did not check to see if I could use more water or anything else. I mentioned the salty rings and he just agreed, but in a way of like, ""awesome right."" Not how I was thinking. 

The real question, would I try again. Heck yeah. It was a cool place. I liked the Burger, the atmosphere and the vibe. It was really busy when I was there, so I can say light on service was understandable. The onion rings need tweaking, I hope that that is not how they are all the time.",C0W3zDoJqC5dQQ0ZUeeDkw,3,0,3,WBVa_fwph39jATqdGKz9mg

This sounded good as they have gluten free buns and from what I read, Bobby Flay's place didn't. When we got there, I noticed the floors weren't clean and I felt like my mom when I saw that!!!! They want to get you in and out quickly but I wasn't ready to order yet. I ended up with their famous 1/3 lb burger on a gluten free bun. My bun was too thick and maybe they are afraid of cross contamination but it wasn't toasted or grilled which may have made it better. They have it down to a science because when I told the waiter I forgot to order to order cooked onions, the burgers were being set down on the table. He did bring the onions on the side. They make their own pickles which are quite mellow. I don't know how they do it but the burgers come really fast. Maybe they have the buns ready to go but we were so surprised. We wonder if the burgers are partially cooked but they use fresh meat and you can have it cooked your way! The meat was very good. My husband ordered sweet tater tots and they were too squishy to me. We ate at The Habit a couple of days before. I ordered a Char combo with cheese and Chris was going to do Chicken but tried the Burger Santa Barbara style which is on grilled sourdough and has grilled avocado and he had a drink. We shared my fries and the bill was under $18. At Wahlburgers everything is ala carte. The drinks are $4.95....not for a shake but a regular fountain drink but you get to keep the glass!!!! The bill came to $43.10 . Too much to me..I didn't need the cup!!!  Chris said his bun was good but I'd rather go to the Habit! We can't compare it to The Burger Bar as we had Foie Gras burgers the time we ate there and though we had a bad waitress, the food was great and the manager sent
 us a dessert when we said the waitress never came back and didn't have anyone else cover our table. Gordon Ramsey's didn't have gluten free buns and that would have been better but the truffle parm fries were incredible..we tried them last visit. They have Shake Shacks and Steak and Shakes. I overheard a man tell the valet where we were staying that Shake Shack was greasy and back to In & Out for him!!!!",_RHN3o1Sq572hBokfdKs8w,1,0,2,vqPpQaAa3E50Hcp9zTiWjw

Honestly, I think boxed macaroni and cheese has more flavor.  I think they used cheese sauce, instead of cheese, and it had absolutely no flavor - at all, whatsoever.  The only thing that gave it any flavor at all were the breadcrumbs - But even then, not much. I left half of it, and I love macaroni and cheese.  Made me very sad.

We had great service from our waitress- but near the end of our meal, she left and was replaced.

Some were on it, and others were hurried.

In terms of the food, I had the seasonal offering and it wasn't bad- I had to add lettuce and I would've opt'd for a lettuce bun. They have artisinal buns, but it didn't stand out to me (but it wasn't terrible by any means). Had a side of hash to share- fresh, but nothing special either.

I ordered the ""Our Burger"" with bacon and jalapenos added with a side of onion rings.  The food was subpar.  The burger came in a fairly reasonable amount of time, but the meat was lukewarm.  The burger was excessively greasy and left large pools of grease on the paper liner of the serving basket.  The flavor of the burger overall was bland.  You should get a much higher quality product at a similar price at one of the many burger bars on the strip.

The onion rings were not rings at all.  They were effectively frizzled onions that you would see atop of a barbeque burger.  The onion rings were soggy with oil and were WAY over salted.  The amount of salt  made the onion rings inedible to me.

I think that Wahlburgers appeals to those who watch the TV show and caters to the Las Vegas strip crowd that is so drunk when they eat that they can't tell that they're being fed bad food.

Stopped in for a late lunch and there was an hour wait. Luckily two spots opened at the bar so we sat within minutes. We briefly waited to order drinks and the food and it was out in a short period of time. The Beast, two 5oz patties, lettuce, tomato, pulled pork, BBQ sauce pickles and a blue cheese sauce. You would think with all those ingredients it would be flavorful and enjoyable, just the opposite! The burger patties had absolutely no flavoring, how bout a little salt or pepper, just greasy meat taste. The salt found its way to the pulled pork and with abundance. It wasn't very shredded more of a cubed pork, poorly constructed for sure. The only decent flavor was from the blue cheese sauce.
With how big the place is you would think they would be better prepared for a crowd of people. One enterance/exit and they have The guests and hostess standing in the doorway, not very organized.

We asked for suggestions from the menu and he kindly offered a few items. ( we didn't order any of them) 

I chose the thanksgiving sandwich. I was expecting a Capriottis Bobby squished into a hamburger bun. When the sandwich arrived it didn't look like much ( so I didn't bother taking a picture). The first bite instantly let you know that you were dealing with fresh products. The flavors just stood out. It doesn't have nay overwhelming sauces or any other flare that makes it stand out but it sure as shit did taste like thanksgiving. There was a hint of cranberry beneath the stuffing which I appreciated. I also ordered the sweet potatoe tots. some places screw these things up with terrible oils or by over cooking them. These had a little crunch to them but were soft on the inside. I was pleased for sure. The server then offered us some of their Wahlburg sauce (I know it sounds funny). Its basically some type of mayo, ketchup, siracha mix. Not sure what else was in. Great for dipping fries or tots. 

Overall I though it was nice. It was a little on the pricey side for simple burgers and such, but then again it is located on the strip.

Located in an area with fairly high foot traffic outside of Ballys Wahlburgers is the designated burger joint for the outdoor shopping area. 

ATMOSPHERE: 

A kind of bright neon green is the theme color for Wahlburgers, so its hard to miss and also a nice size with indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at around 7PM and the place was busy, the hostess was somewhat awkward insisting that we sit at the bar but we wanted a table, when she realized we weren't budging they IMMEDIATELY sat us at a table. Not sure why she was so insistent. But nonetheless, we sat and were still excited. 

FOOD:
I must say the full bar at Wahlburgers is the best thing they've got going. However I wouldn't recommend ordering a margarita (which is frozen and premade) it's very sweet. I actually asked for on the rocks but the place was somewhat busy so I didn't want to make my waitor do extra work. 
I got the double decker burger and added  mushrooms with onion strings. 
Other than my burger being cooked medium well which I asked the burger itself didn't taste like it was worth $14 at all. The onion strings
 definitely looked better than they tasted, they weren't awful but I'd probably get fries instead. 

Overall I'd definitely say just go to FIVE GUYS if you want to shell out a few bucks on a burger and if you want to go on the strip go to Burger Bar at Mandalay.

She also found something in her salad, and I think we settled on it being some thread from an apron. I had the O.F.D.. It was good, but I would get something else next time. We got the fries. Nothing special at all. 

The table next to us ordered the mac'n cheese and returned it. No clue why, but how can you screw up mac'n cheese. 

As of today, it appeared they were not ready to open, but wanted to open for the summer crowd. They did not even have the proper paper products (soda cups, containers for sides, etc.) They were using styrofoam, and generic paper cups instead of the paper products with the Wahlburgers logo.

We are going back to Vegas in December, and may return to give it another try. If we make it back, I will update this review. I hope it gets better.",CoY-roGXfUEOJky6oBNpvw,2,0,2,Cqm7um2EmEHG9o8YGgSHcQ

I was really looking forward to trying this place because I love watching the show! But we had a terrible terrible experience!!

Before we walked in, there was a family already walking out complaining about the rude service.  We just brushed it off. Then the lady with the check in machine said we couldn't go in a until we told her our name and how many people in our party. We gave her the info and walked in, but before we put one foot in the door she said we couldn't go in because we didn't get a text saying our table was ready. We had to wait outside which was about 54 degrees. 

When I finally got a text, we were greeted by the host. He didn't say hi or hello or welcome to Wahlburgers! He said, ""I can't let you in until you finish your outside drink."" So he just stood at his podium while I chugged my rockstar. He took the can from me and threw it in the garbage! Hey man! Have you heard of recycling? 

The we were greeted by a nice gentleman. I think his name was something like Sicota. I am so sorry if I butchered his name. But he was so nice! 

I ordered the ""Our burger"" first bite you already know the bread was frozen. It was not yet done thawing and they still served a burger on a cold bun. The fries had no flavor!

As we enjoyed our time in Vegas low and behold we see on it the Wahlburger joints right of the strip. As this was my sons birthday trip we asked him as a burger lover if he would like to try this place out, his eye kit up and was eager to get his hands on a Wahlburger. 

We make our way up and are greeted by a personable host who guides us to our table. So far so good, we enjoy the ambiance having two kids with us it was not terribly overly loud. 

Our server introduces herself, but there is a vibe which was not as inviting from this particular server. Non the less she takes our order, which were three Our Burgers. All three had the ""government cheese"" and some special requests. Unfortunately the special request part was not conveyed by the server to the kitchen staff so the orders were not necessarily correct, not biggy, the person who'd brought the food ""not the server"" took back one of the orders for a correction. It was simply no pickles on one, mine was missing the wahlsauce, which i was looking forward to try. I didn't ask for mine to be corrected, and went for it. The buns were soft and perfectly warm, the cold stuff ( lettuce, tomatoes) were fresh and crisp, and the burger itself was cooked to order, mine medium. It was one of the best burgers I've had!
My son had his order adjusted ( minus pickles) and he cannot stop raving about it being the best burger he's ever had. Very nice!! My wife thoroughly enjoyed her burger, and said the pickles were perfect. 

Overall this place is worth it and if I had a local Wahlburger in Murrieta/Temecula it would be our to go place.

Now for the missing star, this is for the waitress, with zero personality, and treated the night like just another job. I get that we all work, I'm a business owner and understand that the key to repeat business is your staff, the team that represents your brand. I would seriously make sure that whoever overseas this region should talk to their employees and understand a bit more what would make their days/nights shifts better in order to ensure the customers are satisfied all around. 

I'll give it up to the Wahlburgs and say they have hit the nail on the head and to keep on pushing the brand. Just be sure the overall experience is one that would make your customer come back to continue and enjoy your burgers.",WJ3zVAquKfM-mooNVKwK-w,1,0,4,9lZfIM2T97p5mc8GIAVdag

But I didn't want to walk all the way back White Castle or McDonald's.  So thank goodness for Wahlburgers being nearby (actually across the street at Bally's where I was staying at) and open till 4am!

I had the Double Decker and opted for Yukon Gold Fries.

The Double Decker w/ caramelized onions (+$1)  -- http://bit.ly/2iqrH43
Two 3 oz. burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, ""Government"" cheese, Paul's signature Wahl sauce & housemade pickles.
The burger was huge!  Definitely satisfied my craving for the night.  Though I thought the burger was somewhat lacking in flavor due to all those veggies.  I probably would've been better off ordering the Dad's Basic Burger which excludes the veggies.

It really was a mistake for me to order the Yukon Gold Fries.  Of all the types of fries, in my opinion, steak fries are an abomination and that's what these were.  So while it's not completely their fault they sell these fries, I wish they had a thinner cut instead.  They're just too thick and starchy for me.  I should've opted for Tater Tots.  Oh well.  At least my waiter hooked me up with extra Wahl Sauce to dip the fries in.

Overall, my experience at Wahlburgers was okay.  I liked the convenience how they were at Bally's and I had a cool waiter so no problems with service.  It's a great late night burger option, though more on the pricier side since I paid around $28 after tax and tip for a burger combo meal.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,22,18,3,U5ilEcD8pwDrZx8B_SeiKg

It's didn't take extremely long for the food to come out and once it did, I was not disappointed. I took one bite of my barbecue bacon burger and fell in deep lust. (Can't use the word love since it was only our first date) lol. The burger was cooked perfectly and I ordered a side of onion rings which I ended up putting inside my burger which took it to the next level!

It was the plain ole burger with pickles lettuce and tomato. The burger was great. I got sweet potato tots on the side. They have sugar added as noted on the menu. I ordered them but they were a bit too sweet for me. Liked the idea of a souvenir photo while at the restaurant but not while we're sitting down to eat. Felt trapped into taking and purchasing a photo. I didn't come here for a photo. I get up selling for cash flow but maybe before the party is seated in a designated area and then approached about purchase at point of paying for the bill instead.

3823191,2018-04-16,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"It was my friend's birthday so we reserved our table ahead of time for a party of 13 via telephone. Place was very busy considering it's located on the Strip in front of Bally's. So it was a good thing reservations were available to us. Our party didn't have to wait when we got there and was immediately seated to our table right next a mural of the Wahlburg Family lol. 

FYI, it's so much easier and faster to just valet your car at Bally's because Wahlburgers is located just on the other side this a short walking distance. The only catch is that you have to pay $15 for Valet. This sure beats parking at the garage which is takes up way more time to get there. 

On to the menu! It was very detailed and of course had their favorite item selections printed in bold for the curious first timers to share what the Wahlburgs like personally.  If you have young ones with you, they also carry Kids meals (Smahlburgs) with fries. And let's not forget about the Vegans as well. I recommend their ""Portabello Sandwich"" loaded with mushrooms and other veggies. ($10.95)  Most of the menu selections are pretty healthy choices considering most of them are burgers or sandwiches. 

I went with their famous housemade ""Mom's Sloppy Joe!"" ($11.95)   Of course I had to respect Momma Wahlburg and experience her recipe because that's what a momma's boy should do. Lol I also recommend selecting the thin cut onion rings as the side dish. Did I forget to mention that when you order a burger, the side of fries comes as a meal. 

Personally I did not like their ""Mac 'n Cheese with Smoked Bacon"" because it was lacking mostly the cheese. Don't get me wrong, all the ingredients put into this was delish but it's just not the same without the motherload of cheese needed. ($7.95)

To top it all off, I was still hungry for some dessert, so I ordered ""IBC Rootbeer and Creamsicle Floats"" all around the table. ($7.95 each) 

I can't forget to mention that all our orders came out quick!! Our server and the cook behind the grill served up some hot plates so fast and accurate, I was very pleased! 

Also, if you want your picture taken, there's a photographer going around table to table giving out small complementary photos for free and bigger photos for sale. don't tell anyone I told you this, but it's just better to whip out your own phones and have someone take it for you for free",lUGiHH2La_BuHoBrR1aGlg,1,0,5,9qP3vMmPPQQWeBolfPLFig

First, the hostess was a little annoyed that we did not have cell phones so they could text us when our table was ready.  She told us to stand by her so she didn't forget us, then said it would be about 45 minutes.  This was her best solution to people (rare as it is) who do not take their cell phones everywhere.  Anyway, went in, saw the menu and first thing I thought way ...Geez Wahlberg brothers;  you don't make enough money so you have to charge Ala carte for fries with a sandwich.  I realize this is on the strip and rent must be high, but seriously????  I will say thank you for making the plain burger a dollar less then the cheeseburger...more places need to do this. We waited about half hour for our food to come out.  The burgers were good, nothing special.   My husband had ordered the pulled pork on his burger and had to drain half a cup of oil off the pork before he could eat it.  Truly, the entire bottom of his basket was dripping as was the burger.  He called the server over and told her and her reply was ""Yes, it is oily"" then brought him napkins to wipe up the oil that was now on the table. The family ""special"" sauce tasted just like thousand island dressing without the relish.  While we were waiting a lady came and asked if we wanted a free picture postcard;  we said no.  She replied ""but it is free"".  We said no again.  Again she said it is free, you don't have to buy anything (I understand the concept of free lady)Really, I am hanging out with my husband and you are bothering me????  when we received our bill there was a $4.95 charge for the pulled pork but the menu said this add on item was $1.  when I questioned the server she said ""Sorry, sometimes the kitchen gets confused"".  Not sure what that is all about as she rang up our bill, but he removed it.  The place is VERY noisy!  but it was nice looking at the pictures.",DYSOsZcrShjLjF46QwBI4A,0,0,3,QP6g-FGzIfy4sWwWRGMyqQ

We ended up going back before we ended our trip! This place is a must. Big THANK YOU to the Wahlberg family for creating the most accommodating restaurant for people who cannot eat wheat gluten that I've ever eaten at.

But salt and pepper makes a burger tasty.  Also don't buy any cocktails it's just really watered down.

3867501,2016-10-12,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Being a faithful viewer of the TV show, I knew I had to go to this place while in Vegas over the weekend. What a joke. I have to give this 1 star to post this review but I wouldn't have given them any. After waiting 40 minutes to get in, my family and I were seated in a corner to fend for ourselves. Waiting for 10 minutes, we finally waved a waiter down to bring us menus and water. The menu only had a few options and the prices were ridiculous. We ordered the $13.00 bugers and $4.95 fries. Our food came and 2 employees argued with each other right in front of us over whose order was whose. Onto the food. The fries and tater tots were cold. They made 2 of the burgers wrong and mine was so salty I couldn't even eat it. We again got the attention of our waiter and he made no attempt to make it right. We then asked to speak to the Manager. After another 15 minutes, she came over and we shared our experience with her. She offered new burgers but after everything else that already happened, we were over it. She did take 1 burger off of our bill however; this overall experience was terrible. It's too pricey for burgers you can't even eat. My sister lives in Vegas and told us not to go. We should have listened and would have been better off at McDonalds. Totally disappointed. I watched an episode of Whalburgers were Paul was hand  picking employees for this location.

3875330,2016-08-24,9,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"If there is one thing Vegas isn't lacking in, it's burger joints.  From lowbrow to high-end, we almost have them all.  Wahlburgers apparently felt that there was room for one more overpriced chain in our market, so of course I had to check it out.  

Unfortunately, we chose a hot weekend day to visit and the wait was an over an hour long (waiting is outside).  They do use the texting system, so at least we could peruse the lackluster Grand Bizarre shops while we waited (I still don't get these shops).  We were texted that our table was ready about 65 min later and seated.

I question the layout of this space.  1. Because I'm not sure how anyone would know that they have a takeout counter in the back of the restaurant if you just want to pick up food and leave.  They don't even let you in the door to get on the wait list.  It's done outside.   2. We were seated at a booth with an I-beam at the edge of our table.  Horrible view, to say the least.  They should have been able to plan the seating better.

It took some time for our server to come over, so we were fully prepared to order when he arrived.  We got the Our Burger $10.95, the OFD $12.95, mac n' cheese $7.95, and an order of tots for $4.95, plus 2 fountain drinks $3.95 ea.  The food itself was pretty good; if I were at a quick service restaurant and the bill was $25, not $50 (plus tip) for paper cups and plastic ware.  The burgers at The Habit are as good, if not better, for a 1/3 of the price.

I think it will do well with tourists, but for locals it's probably a one and done kind of place IMO.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,18,12,3,vzQPTpnE_8sAgH967McYzg

However, for the price this place is decent. I was excited to try this place because I'd heard so many great things about it. But, I didn't want to go right away because I knew it would be busy and the restaurant needed some time to get a seasoned staff in place. 

This is a new location located in the Bazaar plaza outside of Bally's. It's a bit of walk to get to from the parking garage, but it was nice to explore the casino since I hadn't been there in so long! The restaurant was packed when we got there on a Thursday night. It was a 15-20 minute wait so we walked around. 

FOOD: Once we were seated, we ordered the Mom's Sloppy Joe and The Our Burger. The burger was good. It's a simple one with 1/3 lb of meat with lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese with Wahl sauce and pickles on the side. The burger itself is good, but I prefer adding the Wahl sauce in it! The meat was tender and juicy. I think I should've gotten a larger burger so the meat to bread ratio would've been better. 

The Mom's Sloppy Joe was okay. I think the food may have been waiting at the window too long because by the time we got it the bread was a little mushy. It's an open-faced sandwich so you can't really eat it with your hands, you'll need a fork. The Sloppy Joe tasted good with the crispy onions. However, I didn't eat it with the bread since it was so mushy. I think had it came out right when it was made, then that the dish would've been good. 

PRICE for each was about $11-$13. So the meal with one drink was about $30 with tip. 

SERVICE was decent for how busy it was. I recommend not coming here during peak hours. Expect to wait if you come on the weekends. 

Overall, the meal was good. I wouldn't come back though. I think I would rather go to Shake Shack instead at New York New York.

The Service:  It was pretty prompt. The only ""eh"" I have was that 1, we were seated in the back, closest to what I am assuming is the part of the kitchen. The garbage passed by our table a few times. Not a good aroma when you're eating blue cheese. #NoBueno
Oh, and 2, our server just gave us water. Not ""can I get you anything to drink?"" It was just ""here, you need water"", as if he knew that we had been in a drunken stupor just hours prior to coming here. LOL

Verdict: WE WILL BE BACK. The ambiance was fun, and everyone was upbeat. The food was delicious (and I dont even like to eat burgers in a restaurant). The only thing that would've been better wouldve been to have Paul  make the food himself. LOL (Or a glimps of Donnie or/and Mark) lol. #WishfulThinking

3992972,2017-02-10,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,So growing up in the 90s I totally loved new kids on the block specially Donnie Wahlberg so when Wahlburgers opened you know I definitely have to check it out. They were supposed open earlier in Vegas but I guess it got delayed so it finally opened last year and I just got a chance to check it out a couple weeks ago. Watching them on TV got me so excited to try all the food they have there and to see exactly how the restaurant was. so  as I was saying I was totally hyped about getting here. Now my five stars that I listed is strictly for the food and not the customer service that's another story. But first  let's talk about the food. Sweet potato tots definitely a must if you go there I would totally love that I have the Jenny chicken burger which was so delicious I love the thin sliced onion rings they had something different than what you usually see at a burger joint we also had their government cheese sandwich which was also a good mother mixed drinks was OK it was kind of pricey $14 for one drink but oh well it was our first time there so we got that to him again food was excellent I would love to try their mac & cheese when I go back to Vegas again. I so wish they would open one here in Hawaii that would be awesome. I like the layout of the restaurant though from the outside it looked like it was a two-story building but it wasn't. I was very surprised that they didn't sell like their merchandise in the restaurant you actually have to go outside to another chaos and buy all the merchandise. When I've been to brand but it was really cold when we're in Vegas like 30¬∞ cold. Now let's talk about the customer service which was horrible and disappointing. Again from watching a show and reading some reviews it seem like it was a great place great atmosphere but our server John only came to our table to set us and to give us our drinks and then we didn't see him again until he came back to the table to give us our bill which I thought was odd. There are other servers that did bring out our food but it wasn't like they're excited to be there anything there was no Like  how's it going how's the food nothing they just drop the food and left and I can understand if it was busy but we were there at like 130 in the morning so it wasn't too busy. No one came to check on us if we needed more water or anything it was just really weird. I noticed that the employees would much rather stand to talk story with each other instead of making sure that the customers were OK. I also did inform John our server that it was our first time there and that we were excited and that we did come only from Hawaii but obviously that didn't make any difference to his level of customer service I was going to give us which is zero. There's anything that could be changed here I would say would be to train the staff better and interacting with customers. Again my five star rating is just strictly on the food and that's it if I had to read the customer service I will probably give them negative stars. But if you're in Vegas and you want to have a good burger definitely check out wall burgers they have a great selection of burgers and also some other dishes and some great makes drinks. I hope our next visit out there is better especially since were flying all the way from Hawaii to experience the wall burgers. And I just like to say that I did journey out to the kiosk outside on the strip and I bought items there to bring back to Hawaii for my friends and the gentleman working in that kiosk Francisco he was awesome he did great customer service gave me a free Blinky cup with some kind of strawberry slush in it once I told him I was from Hawaii and I was like one of their biggest fans like I said excellent customer service I would definitely go back. They need to have more Francisco's working in whalburgers just my opinion.,VbXsJajvC8FykoqpNGXhrA,0,1,5,uYSPTA04iue7ivkrDxvcrA

4023502,2016-07-11,4,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"wow...just, WOW. and not in a good way!!

i guess since you can't do no-star or negative-star reviews, i'm just going to refer this ONE star to the waitress/server that we had. because she was actually really really cool, and truth be told i felt bad for the girl. because no one that nice should have to deal with the VERY OBVIOUS bullsh-t going on at this place.

my gentleman friend and i stopped in to try this place while we were in vegas for my last weekend here. (i'm originally from massachusetts and i like everything about the wahlburgs'...at least, as much as an average person like myself should know based on mark and donny's acting in movies etc. im not a rabid fan, but theyve done some good work)

...so i'm also not wanting the douche-baggery that we witnessed to be a reflection on them. but they should know whats up. 
 
the ""kitchen manager"" at the vegas strip location, could use a few lessons. the least of which being in the following categories:

1) having and using decorum, in general
2) the service industry, in general
3) how to NOT behave like an unprofessional, attitude-having, no-manners jackass...in general 

because that there fella clearly needs some help. 

when a customer orders the ""double-dog"", and just wants 2 plain dogs, with nothing on them...you'd think that's a pretty simple thing to NOT mess up. 

one ""dad's"" burger, cooked medium, plain, and the ""double-dog"", PLAIN. yes, plain. there is nothing difficult about that. 

especially when your cool server goes out of her way to verify ""nothing?...just 2 plain hot dogs?"" and you say ""yes"", and everyone's happy and folksy and things are going just as they should.....until some other waitstaff brings your order and the 2 hot dogs have EVERY FREAKING CONDIMENT slopped on them. 

gentleman friend and i kind of exchanged looks, like...youre kidding, right? had to be the wrong table. nope there are your ""plain"" dogs. 

okay....so no big deal, whatever, they go back. 

and a wrong order, courtesy of the a-hole managing the kitchen, turns into a freaking debacle of jackassery, the likes of which i just could. not. believe.

he--from the kitchen, in plain view of us--VISIBLY denied getting the order wrong, gave both the innocent girl who just brought the order to our table AND our server (who took the order), a rash of sh*t, made it so beyond painfully obvious he was INSISTING that ""we"" had ordered it the way it was served, and then took his sweet a$$ time, correcting the order. 

and clearly, with a grudge...as one of the two plain hot dogs that were eventually brought to the table WASNT EVEN F-CKING COOKED!!! one was obviously grilled/cooked. the other one, cold and weirdly grayish-brown.

honest to cripes, i was just looking at it like.....no. 
there is NO f-cking way this just happened. but it soooo did. i was shaking my head not knowing if it was really funny or more than mildly psychotic.  i still dont know. 

what i do know is this:

if your job is managing the kitchen in a restaurant on the STRIP OF LAS VEGAS, and cant even muster an above-junior-high-school level of maturity...forget professionalism at all or just behaving like a capable, balanced person...you need to be f-cking fired. 

just straight fired. find something else, which doesn't involve human interaction. 

""kitchen manager's"" display was just so beyond inappropriate, that by the time our poor beleaguered server told us it had been taken off our total, i was just relieved that there wouldnt be a further scene. 

we just thanked her for being cool, left a good tip, wished her a good night and got the hell out of there. 

take it off our check, thanks. 

that definitely makes up for you acting like a blatant jackass in front of your staff and customers. what a sack of sh-t. the burger was kind of gross, too. ordered it medium, came back practically mooing and just tasting bad.

i decided to not further test the patience of that behavioral-issue-plagued mental case and thought to myself leave it alone... i couldnt even imagine what would have come back. 

$25 for a sh*tty burger and an obnoxious display. i left there cursing my own self for even suggesting we try the place and wishing we had just gone to mcdonalds instead.",5fntUbgK3d55Q1MpqprtAg,3,0,1,qxX_kweuos-eKapYqbmYrA

Wahlburgers is the new kid on the block when it comes to burgers in Las Vegas.  Unlike other Yelpers or The Other Guys that tried this place, I thought that my burger was pretty good. I didn't order straight from the menu because nothing really appealed to me.  I had this Sixth Sense that I wasn't going to be impressed.  So, I opted to build my own burger, which consisted of a 1/2 lb burger patty, one 5 oz grilled chicken breast, and a fried egg.  Yes, I did.  This is The Happening. This burger was huge and big enough to feed a King, maybe even Three Kings.  Taste wise, I was not disappointed.  The chicken was tender, the meat was flavorful not greasy, and the egg gave it that Midas touch.  Combining all three of my favorite protein sources together made for a Perfect Storm.  Although I enjoyed my burger, the food at Wahlburgers is not Invincible.  I also tried their Bacon Mac N' Cheese and the Tater Tots.  The bacon mac was just okay and the tater tots needed a little more work in the deep fryer. We obviously didn't finish the tots and left a couple of Lone Survivors.  Terri R. and Ty W. got their standard 1/3 lb burger while Lore D. got a delicious looking patty melt.  I could tell that everyone in our group was satisfied with their burgers.  I could feel the Good Vibrations. 

The wait can be an issue, especially since Wahlburgers is located off the strip. We waited outside for close to 30 minutes for our table in 110 degree weather.  I wish that the restaurant had a Transformer outside so that they could at least plug in a cool zone for us.  Yes, it was hot and seemed even warmer inside because the restaurant is one big green house.  Price is one of the biggest drawbacks.  The cost for a burger is around $8 and my creation was over $12. 

Besides the wait and the prices, the service was great.  Our server was very attentive and Management even checked on us a few times.  Free Refills?  Yes!  Free stickers for the younglings? Double Yes!!  We decided against dessert and Departed after we paid our bill.  

Bottom Line...I originally came here expecting the worse, but left satisfied with both the burgers and the service. Peace!!!

4074572,2017-02-28,4,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"I'm a burger fanatic but this joint is just okay. It's loud, crowded and overpriced, and the food is just so/so. When you eat here, you're paying for the novelty of the name and owners. (Now, if they decide to have Mark and Donny start serving burgers shirtless, I may reconsider my star rating)!

I was surprised at how difficult it was to find the restaurant, it's AT Bally's but it's not IN Bally's -- you have to go outside and down several escalators to get there. Once you arrive, expect a wait. The restaurant thankfully has a system where you can give them your cell number and they'll text you when your table is ready. It's nice enough, but there's nothing to do around the area while you wait, just some lame shops and the casino. 

While I appreciated the gimmick of ""government cheese,"" I really hate fake cheese so that just grossed me out. I was happy they had Swiss cheese too, but I think it may have been Swiss-flavored processed cheese food. 

The fried onions were mediocre (they were red onions too, which meant they were far too pungent for the light batter). I ordered a triple cheeseburger because I was starving, and I'm glad I did because the portion size was really small for the price. My burger was cooked as ordered and well seasoned. The pickle chips were INCREDIBLY delicious, but the chili was the absolute star of the meal. Yes, the chili has beans (boo!), but they are minimal.

4089609,2017-05-24,1,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Came by here during my first visit to Las Vegas as this was the first burger place I saw when I entered on on the strip. I knew about Wahlburgers due to the celebrity connection and ownership by the Wahlberg brothers (Mark and Donnie) so I thought I would give it a try just like I gave Transformers: Age of Extinction a try (Starring Mark Wahlberg).  

The menu consists of traditional American food items like sandwiches, burgers, fries, tater tots, and even a few salad options for you vegans out there who also enjoy the cinematic/musical works of The Wahlberg brothers.  This location also has a bar and patio area. Staff were courteous, attentive, and provided a fun atmosphere.  Just to confirm, none of the employees are dressed in costumes based off Mark Wahlberg's cinematic characters  as I hoped there would be.  Just imagine a server dressed as Dirk Diggler.  But no, this is not a theme restaurant as I hoped but that's fine.  All the staff members wore a signature black t-shirt and pants combo similar to the fashion of Starbucks' employees.  

I had the ""Our Burger"" with a side of crispy tater tots (as recommended by Paul Wahlberg's note on the menu, who is also the actual chef of the family).  It was absolutely delicious in every way.  It was surprisingly so good that I laid back in the dining booth for a moment holding my stomach just like Bruce Willis did after he got shot by Donnie Wahlberg's creepy character in The Sixth Sense.

I highly recommend this place.  I'm going to go watch their A & E show now.",TOexoXiiTWyhJ76UfJ1J5w,0,0,4,Bozt8ag9JLMQaF8RDTqQuw

The manager Julio ended up taking off 20% from the check. So, the food was actually pretty good. I ordered the beast. Bacon bbq burger could use some more sauce. The homemade ranch tasted terrible.

4154850,2016-07-07,2,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Wahlburgers Las Vegas 

Let me start by saying I'm a die hard Wahlberg fan. I grew up being a block head and I watch every Mark Wahlberg movie. Growing up, I may have stalked Donnie & Mark's family home in Braintree, Massachusetts when MTV was filming a show about them. 
My husband & I visited Wahlburgers Las Vegas on July 4, 2016 around 3:45 pm. The location is ideal - in the new Bazaar shops near Bally's. It's a really cute location with small shops and Wahlburgers is tucked away in the back. When we found our way, the gentleman at the door said it would be about a 45 minute wait and asked my husband for his cell phone number. They text us when the table was ready which was cool cuz we could continue gambling or shop in that little area. 
So, we get the text and show up about 2 minutes later and it was about 45 minutes we had to wait but when we got inside, there were a few tables open which was odd. The waiter comes over and we order waters. The ambiance is like the other location in Hingham, Ma so I've seen on TV. Lime green chairs and Wahlberg pictures on the walls and on the ceilings are the titles of movies Donnie & Mark have starred in. Cute!
The waiter takes our order - we split the bacon Mac n cheese and I got the  Thanksgiving Day Sandwich and the hubs got Jenn's chicken sandwich. The waiter asked ""what would you like for a side""? We both got the tater tots. We didn't have to wait that long, plus I was taking a bunch of pictures and taking it all in. 
Initially, the bacon Mac n cheese didn't have the bacon or breadcrumbs on it but the waiter gave us a new cup - I assume he didn't just ask for bacon & breadcrumbs. 
My sandwich was good. A turkey burger with stuffing and butternut squash pur√©e with a little bit of mayo. A bit dry. I would have liked a cranberry jam on it or maybe more mayo, but it was good. Jenn's chicken sandwich was ok also but the bun was too small for the chicken breast and the Caramelized onions made the bun excessively soggy. Also, it had shredded lettuce which I thought would be better suited not being shredded.  
The waiter came and asked if we had room for dessert. We didn't. We were full enough but not over full. The bill all together was $45.15. I was shocked that a lunch meal at a burger joint could be that expensive. 
All in all, I would give Wahlburgers Las Vegas a score of 6.5 if we were saying 1 was bad and 10 was great. The things I liked were the way they text you telling you your table was ready. Very 2016 and a great idea instead of handing out those huge beepers. I also felt like my teenage self again being all boy band crazy. The main thing I did not like was the waiter asking what side we wanted as it implied the side came with the meal. Had we known roughly 15 tater tots each would be $4.95, we would have split one or not gotten them at all. They are straight up tater tots - no special seasoning on them or anything. My advice to this particular location is to either lower the prices or be sure the customer knows they have to pay for their side. Had we been a larger group like a family of 4, the bill would be close to $100. For a turkey burger and chicken sandwich?! In all fairness, they had only been open 4-5 days. But if they'd like to stay open 4-5 months, I recommend decreasing their prices. Still love Donnie & Mark but will never eat there again...certainly not the ""right stuff"" for those over inflated prices.",7DK8sZXFi0M7AI90t7uflg,2,0,3,PjybeZvFc-sHR8XvLHJP-A

Not sure what her hustle is, but I'm guessing the whole goal was to get people to sit down, drink and order more, in addition to getting tips for the staff. Nice hustle. So I'm waiting, and this bar manager, Irish guy, winks at me!!! What in the world??? I'm not like that, men don't do that to other men where I'm from. I go off on the guy about what is going on and demand my order to go. I had enough and called them out about what was going on. I got my order, paid what was owed and kept the 20% tip I was going to give.

I was going to go to the Coney Island location in NYC a week ago, but decided not to because of the location, bad yelp reviews about service and other things. Come to Las Vegas, I've gotten bad service here too. The burger was alright, but honestly, there's so much competition, I won't ever go to a Wahlburger's in Vegas, NYC or Detroit.

Very unorganized in getting seated and 3 tables seated after us got drinks and food long before us. FYI no restrooms in building you have to go out to shops next door and their nasty. Then try getting back in. You are at the end of the line and host wants to reseat you. Way over priced. 2 people     2 burgers 2 sodas. $56.

4306824,2016-09-24,2,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Our group of 4 decided to go here for lunch just because of the Wahlberg's name/TV show/etc. We parked at Bally's and got to the restaurant around noon (on a Wednesday). It was a nice day so I asked the hostess if we could be seated on the (empty) patio. She said they don't serve food on the patio unless you take it to go, and they weren't yet doing to go orders. She said a 15 minute wait to be seated inside, but it was less than 5. 

Inside it's a cool place. The whole service is very strange though -- mix between a Smashburger/ In-N-Out/ Shake Shack and a sit down burger place. Our waiter was attentive and took our drink order (4 waters) and promptly filled 4 paper cups at the exposed Coke machine (which I later saw patrons using themselves). Three of us ordered the classic Wahlburger (one with bacon, one super well done, and one with some pink), an order of fries, an order of onion rings, and a Caesar salad. The waiter then took the order to a person working the computer at the counter. I saw several customers go up to this same individual to place to go orders. 

While we waited, a woman in a Wahlburgers tshirt approached us and said they were taking free photos as part of a promotion at the restaurant. She took a group photo and presented it to us about 15 minutes later. The photo was horrible and THEN she tried to sell us copies for a ""good price"". I told her we weren't interested and she just stared at me. She finally said ""you don't like pictures?"" and I told her no, we don't like the picture. She left us the free one and then stomped away. 

The food did not take too long to come out. The medium well and super well done burgers were mixed up, but everything came out okay. Everything (aside from the salad) was served in plastic baskets or paper cups. The onion rings are more like fresh made crunchy onions you put on green bean casserole, so ask for a fork. The fries were nothing special and definitely not worth the price. The burger was alright, but nothing to write home about.


Overall, at $16-20+ per person, I was expecting a burger of high quality, but it seemed no higher quality than a burger from In-N-Out. I still can't believe the burger doesn't come with fries like at a normal sit-down place. Save your money.",yH_-PiEeQKXewvSjxCLosQ,3,0,2,0yuEE54MdRFCIL95eCO3DA

Since it is new to the strip there was a bit of a wait ... 30 minutes.  We arrived at 7:30p and were sat at 8:00pm on a Friday night.    

The set up is casual with the dining room  wood, steel, and black/white overhangs that have word references to the Wahlbergs.  There is also an indoor/outdoor bar.  

Service was good, nothing spectacular.  While we waited we had a postcard photo taken that is complimentary.  Of course nothing is really free ... so we ended up getting two larger photos for a total of $25.00.  The picture person only takes cash, btw. 

When it came to ordering, I had the OFD (I just wanted to say Dorchestah) and it sounded right up my alley even though Jenn's Chicken Sandwich sounded delicious.  My friend did order Jenn's Chicken Sandwich, though.  My burger was served medium rare and was quite juicy however that made my bun soggy. :(  Overall, I found the burger quite tasty. I left it as is and did not have any special requests.  My friend loved her chicken sandwich.  It was a flavorful piece grilled chicken according to her. 

Sides are a la carte.  We both went with french fries ...nothing to right home about. Thin and crispy.  

I wanted to end the dining experience with a dessert.  It was not meant to be, the Crispy Apple Empanadas were sold out or maybe no longer available?  The two remaining cupcakes looked sad and I don't do fluffanuttas.

I ordered a Fiesta Burger. Honestly I'd have to say that the patty was really nothing special, which in turn just made this an ok burger.  I actually probably prefer Fuddruckers over it. 

I ordered the shoestring onion rings as well. This was an incredibly large portion. They really just need to offer a small size at a reasonable price. Having a $6 basket the size of my face is really unnecessary for a party of 1.

I have to admit that we came in here because of the name and because my friends are huge NKOTB fans. :)

The burgers itself are just ok.  We came at 11pm so were not that hungry, and we were able to order the smalhburger, which is - as you would expect - a small/kids size burger. A great deal for $7.95 which also comes with a side!  The burger was just 'ok'; nothing that special in my mind.  Between my friends and I, we had 3 different sides - onion rings (more like, fried onion strings), sweet potato taters, and regular tater tots.  All three were pretty luke-warm (maybe it was sitting under the warmer for the while b/c it was late?)

4402140,2017-12-10,8,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"I stopped into the Las Vegas outpost of Wahlburger to have the double-decker burger, which was surprisingly not shitty. This was my first experience at any Wahlburger, and I expected to be writing this review with a vituperative bent but I have nothing but good things to say about this burger: beefy, well-seasoned, well-flavored, lovely melty cheese -- and an outer char on both 3-ounce patties that was delicious and texturally nice. Thick crispy pickle slices were mild and pleasant, obviously made in house instead of being jarred or canned. The ""Wahl"" sauce, the so-called family secret, tasted like Thousand Island dressing mixed with Sriracha Sauce. It served the burger well. 

I'm from the Boston area originally, which is not a burger-y part of the country, so it's not like Wahlburger is representing a cuisine or is ""serious food."" Indeed, there's no regional yardstick to measure Wahlburger's ""authenticity"" against -- although the Las Vegas service staff is undoubtedly more attractive than you would find in Massachusetts. Beyond that, this really is its own thing. I don't watch the show, nor do I care to. Judging the product by what was served to me, I was very pleased -- my only big quibble being that $13 feels like the wrong price on the Vegas strip, where good, cheap burgers are plentiful.

The walk from the Aria was about 0.6 miles but takes like an hour due to the up down left right pedestrian bridges as you can't just walk straight down Las Vegas Boulevard.  Oh well, part of the adventure and a surefire way to exceed your daily step goal.

Since I was alone, I was able to get a spot at the bar.  Placed my order and the drink came quickly but the food was a bit on the slow side.  Definitely built up the anticipation.  When it came, I had to get my pictures then started diving right in.  The cocktail was Hibiscus Boo and it was delicious but a little weak.  The bacon mac and cheese was a little lacking in cheese as others have mentioned.  I just stirred it up as most of the cheese mixture dripped to the bottom and this helped mix up the bread crumbs as I almost choked on my first bite.  Decent but not all that.  I got the Our Burger and it was pretty awesome.  Cooked a perfect medium, juicy and flavorful.  No regrets that I skipped out on tots/onion rings/fries in order to overindulge on the items I did get.  Let me tell you, I recently started a diet and lost about 5 lbs, but it all went down the tubes, I ate every single bite!

I just happened to walk by this time and saw it was open. So I gave it a shot.  It's in a weird spot. It is accessible from the side walk on the strip or from Bally's Casino. From the casino just head towards the escalators leading to Las Vegas Blvd and it's at the bottom. Make a left.  From Bellaggio fountains cross the street towards Bally's and it's at that corner. If you are at Cesar's Palace or Bellagio Casino walk towards the walkway bridge. From their you can see the Green W and sign. However, it looks closed or not open yet from this angle.  Cross over the walkway, go down escalators and make a left. Pass all the small kiosk type shops. Then tucked in the back of this corridor on the right is Wahlburgers. 
     I had zero wait time. Walked straight in and had a seat at the bar. It's tight spacing and a bit crammed. The bar has huge garage style windows that open up so you can sit outside. It's November.  60 degrees with 40 mph wind. The nice bar gal and I were were cold. She was smart to have a hoodie.  
     Ambiance is very loud. Flat screens, loud music and the ice cream place across from them had loud reggae blaring. It's an open kitchen so that noise mixed in makes for a very loud dining experience. It's got a sports bar type of feel. 
     The menu is 100% Bostonian humor with a touch of their Boston accent. The menu is marked to show each of their favorite burgers including their moms.  They ran out of Empanada :( so that means I will return to try it. I went with The O.F.D Burger, Thin Crispy Onion Rings and Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  It's all Ala Carte and a lot of the menu sides are House Made.  The artisan bun is buttered, toasted and ready for a 1/2 lb burger patty. Add some bacon, saute'ed mushrooms, house made tomato sauce and slow melted Swiss cheese. Quality burger cooked to your liking. Good burger.
     The Thin Crispy Onion Rings are a nice change up to having fries. It's got a light tempura type batter and well seasoned. These can become very addicting. The movies should offer this at their concession stand. One order probably last the entire movie. The sweet potato tater tots is also a good choice to pair with your Wahlburger. I could only finish half of my meal. It was a lot of food.  I also tried the Wahlburger Beer. It's spicey and hoppy. 
    My bartender gal was awesome and I wish the family more success. If you're in Vegas check out the New Kids on the Culinary Block on the Strip. Cheers my Yelp Funky Bunch :)",TeHp5f1KY_7Mh-swUWSjuA,8,7,3,XqkYAVthyRky9rneLz7Whg

Located in that shopping/dining area outside of Bally's, it was pretty easy to find. It has a nice bar connected to it in front and I imagine, if there was any particular sporting event you'd want to watch, this would be a good place to see it. Me, I just wanted to eat.

My waitress came, was super friendly and we chatted briefly about Drake, which was great, then took my order.

I started with their smoked bacon mac n cheese. Good Lord was this amazing. Penne pasta, smoked bacon, ""government"" cheese (per the menu) a mix of other cheeses, with house made parmesan panko breadcrumbs. I should have just stopped here, because this was really all I needed. So delicious and satisfying, but of course I had more because, why not?

My burger was their O.F.D. which is a  1/2 pound burger, Swiss cheese, bacon, saut√©ed mushrooms and their tomato jam and a side of tator tots. The burgers come cooked medium unless otherwise asked, which I'm totally okay with a medium burger. The burger was huge. Much bigger than I anticipated even though I knew it was 1/2 pound. I couldn't finish it! It felt slightly undercooked for a medium, but it was still tasty.

The service got a little spotty. Other waitresses kept checking on me, refilling my cup and such. Getting my check was kind of a pain.

Overall things were good here. I'd come back and would recommend Wahlburger's to any burger fan.

I went there on their second day open at around 10pm and the wait was only 20 minutes (but took only 10 minutes). Each and every staff member was super friendly and helpful. They all went out of their way to make my daughter and I feel cared for (even the manager, Edgar). He personally came to speak to me to offer us each a complimentary frappe b/c they were out of Fluffanuttah ingredients. OMG, the frappes were so yummy. My daughter had vanilla and I had chocolate. She gave me some of hers... so I mixed the two together and viola... a party in my mouth!

It was late, so we shared Donnie's Fave (aka the BBQ Bacon burger) and the onion rings. Oh my jeezus... the flavor of the onion rings (more like onion strings with red onion) was super yummy, that they made my mouth water. The housemade BBQ sauce on the burger was filled with delicious spices (I LOVED it). The beef patty tasted like they used a higher quality of meat. The bun was slightly toasted and buttery. 

Overall, the service, the atmosphere, and the food were superb. I loved it so much that I'm trying to figure out how I can eat there once a week! J/K

Not sure why, but they stop you at the front door. There was a few people talking with the guy at the door. Mostly not about eating or getting a table, so we walked on in.

We were greeted by a less than happy hostess, she sat us right away and turned out to be our server. She took our order, never smiled, never said hello. Just ""what can I get you""

The burgers came out fast and hot. They were about a 3 out of 5. Good flavor, but a soggy bun. The American cheese was ok, but a bit overwhelming. 

We also got the skinny onion rings. I'm sure when they are hot, they are good. But ours were Luke warm. 

$4 for a paper cup of Sprite...Ouch. I know it's the strip, but still...ouch.

I do have to say their thin sliced onion rings were worth their price- they were quite awesome and the portion size was much larger that the other 2 sides we all split.

If you don't mind paying $20 for a good burger and cold fries, this is the place for you.  If you don't mind eating without utensils and drinking from paper or plastic (even an overpriced beer) this is the place for you.

The name brings you in.  The quality of the food is decent; the quantity of food delivered degenerates the value.  The total experience keeps you from returning.  Wahlburgers, sadly, must depend exclusively on uninformed tourists.

As a local, I recommend many other outstanding burger-available restaurants on or near the Strip:   In-N-Out, Smash Burger, Five Guys, Holstein's, The Peppermill, Marilyn's Cafe-Tuscany

You can turn any of the burgers or sandwiches into a salad so I did that with their chicken salad. Instead of salad dressing they put the weird mayo all over the salad. That's pretty vile.

I thought the menu is slightly different between the East and West Coast but they still have the Wahlbergs' family favorites ie: Mom's Sloppy Joe, the Our Burger and the single, double and triple burgers. Tried almost each type of the burgers and they're all pretty consistently good! Juicy and tender! I just wish they're a little bigger on the size.

Service for the LV location was excellent! Super friendly and very attentive staff. Being it's a tourists destination, they offers guests to have their picture taken and put it in a souvenir frame. But I think it's a third party that take the pictures since the pictures are not free. But feeling tourist-like, we bought the picture.

Ohhhh, when you're there, do NOT miss their thin crispy onion rings!!! It will be a sin if you don't get this crazy-good thin crispy onion rings! It's not the ordinary onion rings. I think they should be called onion strings instead of rings. They are thinly sliced strings tangled and fried all together in a delicious batter. Did I say you have to get the onion rings? 
Hahahaha it's definitely one of major factors why I had to find a Wahlburgers back home.

WHAT: Dying to get out of the 104 degrees of the Vegas Strip.

WHEN: This past Saturday!

WHY: Because I had a massive crush on Marky Mark as a kid. DUH!

Over the weekend, the hubs and I decided to try the famous ""Wahlburgers "", as we were both in need of a meal after walking the strip and day drinking. Upon walking in, we were greeted by a young face and lead to a booth close to the bar. We dove into the extensive menu before deciding on sharing ""The Our Burger"" which was loaded with a 1/3 lb of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion, american ""government"" cheese, Paul's signature Wahl sauce with housemade pickles! Ben likes his burgers plain and simple, where I like to make mine all fancy and loaded up with all the fixin's - so opted for onion rings on the side....which were pretty much onion strings! Everything tasted a little blah - and wasn't outstanding by any means The meat was pretty dry and literally was nothing to write home about. Service was decent and pricing wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.

The chicken sandwich, which I had a bite of, had a awkward texture and mouthfeel about it. Almost as if it had a 20%+  water-solution pumped into it. The condiments on the sandwich were decent but he chicken itself just was well below standard. Next, the hot dogs... the worst part of the meal.

4935201,2018-02-26,1,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Came here specifically for the Impossible Burger, a newish vegan burger.  It's not on the regular menu yet, but it's on the napkin dispenser display. 
It's not cheap - $19, and comes with no sides, and I got a Diet Coke which was $5 (with a plastic souvenir cup), plus tax and tip, so my whole meal was $30.  Not cheap, but it's Vegas, and I was willing to pay a little more to try the new vegan burger. 
The display shows that the burger comes with special sauce (with mayo - not vegan), and cheese, and sauteed onions (not sure what they are sauteed in and forgot to ask).  So I asked for the burger vegan style, so they took off the sauce and the cheese, BUT the bun came with butter on it!  Also, not sure if the bun is vegan, and not sure if the onions are cooked in butter or oil, and not sure if they are cooked on the same grill as all the meat patties.  I ended up scraping off the buttered part of the bun with my fingers, and removing the onions, and adding some ketchup and mustard, and the burger was very tasty after that! 
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that they are offering the Impossible burger and want them to keep doing that, but, please be aware that vegans may come to this restaurant to try it, and they will want the rest of the burger to be vegan as well - bun, toppings, sauteed onions, etc...  So it'd be great to educate the staff about these customers and make it so you can offer a true vegan burger, and include the details on the menu about it, from the top of the bun to the bottom.  The waiter did tell me that the burger is cooked on a separate grill, which I love.  Now you just have to offer the option to make the rest of the meal totally plant-based.

The sides don't come with the burger, everything is pretty much separate & aren't meal combos. We thought our burgers were great! We had the chance to really taste the meat since we opted out of adding any toppings to our burgers.

The onion rings were oddly dry and perhaps overcooked but we liked the thin cut style. Fries were generic but hot and crispy. We also tried the cupcakes which are very home-made tasting but in our case were very dry as well. 

Our only real complaint was the service and the pricing. We have been trained here in LV to expect and accept both bad service and high prices so maybe that was just par for the course.  We would return if we wanted a quick bite before a show. It is too bad that you have to pass so many naked people and crazies on the way there along the strip so if you are taking kids especially at night and walking there be aware of that issue.",08JfqZfqfYKI-y_JOHVjCQ,1,0,4,ydqpSq66DpfG0KSF5vCNPw

Had a very expensive Bloody Mary. Good not great. 
Wahlburgers special brew  was very good but for price average. 
We both had burgers. Some of the best burgers we have had.  Buns were fresh, burgers cooked perfectly, condiments on them were spot on. Fiesta burger was excellent, hearty and not too spicy. Loved it. The basic burger my wife had was also very good.  
Fries were hot and fresh and a
Nothing special. 
For the price we paid for all of that....well over $50....it's seemed expensive. Vegas burger places are just that.....expensive. I would give a 4 - 5 star based on burgers but overall it's a 3+. Would return again.",eLs2_UyrbuSGrb9YIoqqIw,0,0,3,bftCq-IuHE7oUbCncIaItg
5012227,2017-04-26,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"This is a tough review to write.  I feel so conflicted by Wahlburgers.  First off, I keep seeing reviews about the prices.  Given the location; the prices are quite reasonable.  You can go to almost any fast food place on that block and pay just as much, sometimes more.  So with that being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the prices.

Some of my findings:
Fiesta burger - absolutely amazing
Tater tots - good
Wahl sauce - outstanding 
Sweet potato tots - soggy


While I found most of the food to be really good, the service was a bit shaky.  I ordered a milk shake with my meal, but it didn't come.  Another issue we had was that my mother, who's a vegetarian; ordered a salad sans meat.  We explained that she's a vegetarian and need her salad minus the meat, but it came with meat.  They then had to remake it and we sat for about 20 minutes before the food arrived. I was in the rest room (out the door and around the corner) when the food came, so I missed the waiter.  When he came back again our meal was almost finished and I had to remind him about the milkshake.  He was very sincere and apologetic, but I still waited probably 40 minutes for a milkshake.   That being said; these things can be chalked up to human error. Accidents happen, and while it was two; I wasn't too mad about it.

One thing I did find to be a bit out of line was the photographers.  At one point while we were waiting for our food someone came up and offered us to take a picture for a complimentary postcard.  We agreed, who would say no?  Later on, while I had my face stuffed with food, a woman came by and hovered over me with a book of pictures asking for money.  I felt that that was just intrusive and a bit tacky.  I eventually just had to shake my head no, because she didn't give me a chance to swallow my burger before she walked away seeming agitated.  I would definitely recommend that this practice be re-evaluated by management, as it just kind of came off rude.  

All in all, I liked Wahlburger's.  The food was good enough and I work nearby.  I would consider going back, and with a smoother experience I could see myself giving this place a 4 or 5 star rating.",x7tsmp5lbgWXQ72pkwEWPg,0,0,3,TV0a0NY9x8HnIK9wmJGmYw

5069315,2018-05-10,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Greetings! This review is more or less geared to Chicagoans as we're about to get our first Wahlburgers-- albeit in St. Charles, Illinois (Source: Kane County Chronicle, May 9, 2018), where no doubt people won't mind paying $10 for a basic Wahlburger and a soft drink. It was only that I happened to be in Las Vegas this week that I discovered the famous family's burger joint. 

Located at the Grand Bazaar Shops on the Bally's property, you can't miss the old school diner-inspired git-up. Especially if you're staying at Bally's or any one of the nearby hotel/casinos such as Flamingo or Paris, I think it's a must-try. 

The burger is very good, no doubt about it. Service here was also quite friendly and helpful considering the place was packed and super-busy. So much so that I opted to grab a seat at the counter; something I don't normally do. Have to say I was anxious to try my first Wahlburger. Obviously because I jumped in with both feet ordering the Double Decker. Good choice if you're really hungry and your tastebud receptors are craving quality meat, cheese and toppings.

The Double Decker consists of two 3oz burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, ""government cheese"" (haha-- American), signature sauce and pickles. Price: $12.95

Yes, regarding ""government cheese"" I can confirm via Wahlburgers Twitter account they describe it as like ""American cheese, only better."" I just find it kind of funny, or maybe just a fun thing to talk about with your server after your initial perusal of the menu. 

Anyhow, my first burger experience at Wahlburgers was I'd say approaching top-notch on food quality and pushing perfection on the whole. The only minor issue was perhaps the slightly longer than average wait for the food to arrive, but I'm certainly not complaining. 

I give Wahlburgers 4.9 out of 5 on my own burger scale! I can hardly wait till they build their first location in Chicagoland. Meantime, looking forward to my next Vegas trip and another visit to Wahlburgers near Bally's.",zV61buUZiax-P1J8p4v-2Q,0,0,4,kRcGFvdkk7ZCaRZC7BAeqQ

We came here during the day and there is a massive wait to dine here so one of us left our number with the hostess so they would text us that a table is open and ready for us while we stroll around nearby. I recommend grabbing some drinks at the Sin City Brewery which is around the corner about 500 feet away.

This time I got the SuperMelt which is pretty much the grilled cheese and a burger combined into one. This would be something I would recommend anyone stopping here to try.

If you're looking for some spiked milkshake, they have a menu for that as well I think you may need to request if they don't give it to you with the regular food menu. I got the Mud Pie which they put vodka, Kahlua, and chocolate liqueur and coffee cream in with vanilla frosting and Oreo cookie pieces. Very satisfying while getting some alcohol into your system.

I had my mind set to eat at this place and I wanted to try something other than In N Out, Five Guys, and Shake Shack. I ordered the Our Burger and I believe it was Paul's favorite according to the menu. Just like all those other ""gourmet"" burger joints, this is a $11+ burger that only comes with the burger. All the sides are extra. I sat at the bar since it wasn't too busy and it actually didn't take long for my burger to come in. The only problem was it took a while for a waiter to come around so I can ask for more sauce since the burger was a little bit dry. After getting the sauce, man did that burger taste pretty good. Surprisingly, I finished it within minutes but I really wished it came with some fries or something. This is definitely a place to at least try but I might just stick with my Cheeseburger with grilled onions and some fries with some spread and that comes with a drink. Yep, you know what I'm talking about. It's what a hamburger's all about.",JabMon5MD5LfG4G7GzUzgw,0,0,3,1GDnHtWhNTD2HF8L-8GMIA

Get the Macaroni and cheese. It will change your life. No really. Don't forget to top with the bacon!

I came in last week with a friend while in Vegas for a work trip. We shared the sloppy Joe's, macaroni and cheese, sweet potato tots, and a burger. The sloppy Joe was tasty. I liked the crispy onions on top but like my sauce a bit more zesty. The sweet potato tots were the disappointment of the meal. They weren't crispy. With a nice crisp and yummy sauce they could be a winner.

We were there as part of a night out prior to a wedding with the rest of our friends.  The service was terrible, most of our orders were wrong in that we were served incorrect items or things weren't customized as ordered (you know, no tomato, cooked medium) etc.  I ordered the onion rings because they are supposed to be really great.  They were terrible.  They were cold and had no flavor.  I mentioned to the server that the onion rings were cold and she brought new ones.  They were hot but still had no flavor.  The fries were pretty good. 

The person running food out, instead of looking at the ticket would just yell and ask whose food it was.  The problem is that English was a 2nd language for him and nobody could understand.  It was also very loud because it's Vegas.  For the cost I would have expected him to be able to properly run food and look at seat numbers.  Maybe if I went to a different Wahlburgers in a different state it would be better.   Maybe because it's Vegas they take for granted that they can just act the way they did because they'll never see you again.

From begaining to end it was a horrible experience. My option take your name off the building its an embarresent to your name.

Not too busy for a late 2pm lunch. 30 minutes till a waiter showed up. All the works will completely ignore you as though you don't exist and the moment you order you no longer exist until it's time to pay up. We ordered our food my wife ordered a drink that never showed up during the 45 minute wait for food or the following 30 minutes to get the bill BUT IT SURE DID GET CHARGED THEY DID NOT MISS THAT! Massive fight to get it removed. We were called lists until the bartender looked it up and Nopeshe never got the order. Burgers are great. Only had water since our waiter never got my Dr Pepper or my wife's drink. The extremely disappointing thing that you can watch from the kitchen is all the sides ypu pay $5 eachfor. I would say 20 of each to include the Chile sitting under a heat lamp going stale and cold. That's what you get. Nothing freshly cooked. We tried to complain of the rock hard cold fries and onion slices but the workers MUST be trained  to fully ignore the customer. The family behind us asked at least 10 different workers for water refills for their children. We watched as the workers looked at them and completely ignored them. The father of the group went up and had to get water for his kids himself. At which point the staff suddenly noticed him doing their job. The staff are just plain nasty people to all of us customers. 

My suggestion Take cash only. Your not going to feel the need to tip anyone. The service is truly that bad. I would not trust them not to tip themselves. That's the feeling you get from this place. Shady and ripped off. $40 plus for 2 good burgers, 2 old stale cold sides, 2 waters. No manager as far as we could see only one guy who did not at all who we think was the manager.

 A suggestion for the business. Don't do your money counting out in the open its sad watching a guy count out his tips cut it in half and keep his half as the guy we guessed was the manager and head waiter split the other half. 

Massive disappointment and extremely bad place to eat at. I have to good friends from Boston who go all the time to the original store. They love it. Told them about this place and they were shocked.",4nODHRwfJf558IZ-PBuj3A,8,0,1,dFnsvZtDcw9bpSnhctNG2Q

After we were seated they took our drink orders right away. And when they came back with the drinks we placed our entr√©e orders.

5218288,2016-07-02,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"People. Give it a few months to complain about the service/attentiveness of this new franchise. -

This review will be about the food.

Been here twice. Spent $33 each day. Once on the soft opening on thursday and returned the next day friday.

On thursday order-
Ordered 'Our' burger: 1/3lb burger, lettuce, onion, ""goverment"" cheese (white cheese?), paul's signature wahl sauce (tasted like thousand island mixed with another foreign condiment?), housemade pickles. 

Thanksgiving day sandwich: fresh ground turkey burger (a 1/4 size of a 1/3lb meat patty. In otherwords- thin), stuffing, mayo, housemade orange-cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash (um, no it wasn't. It was basically mashed butternut squash.)

Yukon french fries,

Malted mint chocolate frappe.

The buns are airy and very squishy. They give their buns a nice char on the grill though. But dull on flavor overall by itself. Frankly its just a bun. Nothing special. Cooked medium well, a smidgeon of pink visible in the first bite.

My thoughts? Its ok. If you have a knack to eat at franchise fast food joints... You may find this burger to be inferior to the likes of in and out or to that of shake shack.

I didn't detect much seasoning to the patty. That's ok, right? You wanted to taste the meat. Cheap. Run of the mill ground meat from the grocer.

Sadly I couldn't identify what the cheese tasted like due to the 'wahl' sauce. If it is a 'goverment' cheese... Well the joke is that it has no flavor and was not exactly an enjoyable food source.

I did finish the patty, some pickles and onions. Discarded the half chewed bun.

Onto the french fries. Modest portion. I found mine to be unsalted or miniscule grains existed on my batch. Since I got this to go, they didn't offer or decide to put in any condiments. O-k. By themselves- not that enjoyable. It being crunchy is the only save these get.

Onwards onto the turkey sandwich. This was actually the better of the order. But!!! Exaggerated exclamations! The most defiling topping in this burger was the 'roasted' (it was mashed) butternut squash. In my mind, If I had to deconstruct this sandwich to relativity: its bread roll, sliced turkey, cran sauce, mashed vegetable, stuffing. Except its a sandwich. But a sandwich on a bun? O-k.

Since the bun is squishy, it simply worked out for the thin patty and its toppings. But, ugh. That squash mash was not enjoyable. Imagine this bland mush with this hint of butternut somewhere in there. It kind of throws off the sandwich. Textures count. Stuffing is standard. No alarms there.

However, even these minute concerns- this was probably the better items you might enjoy there.

The shake leaves little to be desired. Asked to be malted and the server said they would do it, but it didnt taste malty and it certainly wasn't thick like a malt should be. I feel the ice cream product they use doesn't possess a high enough fat count as flavor of itself felt weak and thin. (Thin as in watered. So skim milk thin.)

Without knowing what brand of ice cream they use; definitively it would be hard to say whether it had artificial flavoring for its chocolate/mint. But, to me, it was just generic as it gets. So I'd assume it would be artificial flavorings.

It was soft opening. There are kinks, mishaps, errors that will need to be ironed out. In Las Vegas.. Franchises that come out here don't come packaged with the employees your familiar with either from the state your from or the pseudo celebrity food channel that makes these businesses appear flawless or the memory of an affair you had with said establishment.

Thats setting the expectations to a very low standard. If you work hospitality in this city... I am hoping you have a greater ability of discernable tastes. Or atleast be knowledgable to quality to quantity.

On friday's order:

Ordered Two Grilled banana fluffanutters: peanut butter, fresh banana, fluff (marshmellow) & nutella

Black & white malted shake
Coffee malted shake

Thin crispy onion rings.

So.. There was an issue with the fluffanutters. After signing my check and leaving the tip in the cup. About 25 minutes pass by.

Im thinking like.. Ok. None of my items really require this much time in preparation. At some point, the waittress tells me that they didn't make the fluffanutters cause they stopped serving the desserts by 1am.

Hmm. O-k. Didn't respond back with any sarcastic remark or anything. Just frowned and said ok. However! She said she would ask them make new fresh batch. ""Oh! Cool!"" I thought in my mind. ""You just made up for my time almost wasted!"" An additional disgruntled thought processed through.

4 minutes pass by. They just set the shakes down in a togo carrier. (But didnt label which shake was what. ) Along with the box of onion rings and ketchup! (Oddly, not for the french fries for yesterday.. Hah!)

5 minutes pass by. This order was to go. Strangely, they brought out two dine in trays to bar. - yelp says im at my txt review - whatever",OS3nZ9vndnVyNwy-SFil_Q,1,0,4,az1N8HArneO9V2w9z3iJHQ

My wife and and I decided to get an early start to the day and get in line at about 10:45am since they open at 11am.  At 11 sharp they opened the doors and we were seated immediately.  I ordered a Mud Pie which is something like a mudslide on steroids and my wife went with the spiked lemonade.  Both drinks were delicious. 

For the burgers I went with the BBQ burger and the wife did the melt.  We also got some tots.  Despite some negative reviews, the burgers were cooked to order, hot, quick and very delish.  Zero issues with the burgers.  The tots were average and nothing special.  The server was quick, polite and knew the menu items well and could answer all our questions.  

So, I was leaning to 5 stars but what's holding me back is the pricing.  Two drinks and burgers were about $75.00 with tip so it's easy to say the food and drinks are ""not cheap"".  For us it was something to experience, but for that price you won't want to eat lunch here daily.

Yes this place is overpriced and food was just okay. Quite honestly if Donny was there, I would've given it 5 stars given the same food. Good thing service here was okay. Then again, this place isn't that big to start off with. There's a gift shop at the beginning of this little plaza. At least if you buy a soda, you get to keep the Wahlburgers plastic green cup. 

Kid's meals here are $7 and your choices are a small burger, mac and cheese, or chicken tenders and can come with fries or tater tots and some other choices. No, it doesn't come with a drink. 

BTW, the coke products tastes a bit off here. So if you don't have to buy a soda, don't buy one. Afterall, you can just buy a ice cream float for $8 and that also comes with a green cup you can take home. If you ask nicely, you can just tell your server to get you a new one instead of rinsing your ice cream float cup.

Granted it's not much to look at but every single item ordered at our table was amazing!!! The staff wasn't overly friendly but I'd probably not be so nice serving food to drunk tourists in 106 degree weather. I love that a complimentary photo was taken and give as well as a keepsake plastic cup! If Donnie and Jenny decide on opening one here in Texas you can almost bet $ I'll be one of their very first customers cause I'm still craving that burger and onion rings!!!

Once I got to a part of my burger that didn't have any sauce or pickles, I enjoyed my burger more.  Sides are extra - I ended up getting their fries which were just okay.

The reason why I put it as a 3 instead of a 2 would be the server...he was cool as hell..however when you paying $20 for a fries and a burger that In N Out still destroys then I'm sorry but this place ain't worth it.

On a side note I don't understand why all these East Coast chains think they can open up a burger spot and charge double even triple of what it would cost for a MEAL at In N Out and still can't live up to the quality.

We had:

BBQ Bacon Burger - Had decent flavor but the quality of everything was on par to something any of the casinos Employee Dining Rooms have with a $13 price tag...

The Melt - Basically a grilled cheese burger in which again they have decent flavor but the quality of the food for that price point was dissapointing.

Yukon Gold Fries - Pretty good but again the quantity for that price is horrible.

All in all I can't reccomend this place because of the pricepoint vs. quality of food. If they lowered their burgers to $6-7 then it mayyyybeee warrants an ok but a $11-15 burger and it doesn't have the same quality as Holstein's...fahget about it....",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,10,1,3,466Gb9CExd-khF3YLM4JFw

I've never seen their show and I thought it ranks somewhere in the In & Out, Shake Shack or Five Guys level of burger joints.",wrMuU1zyKV4dD46iK5PWQA,0,2,4,3aGZwwpD_ebF7OPrdU4e9g

Overall it had more of a fast food feel than I was expecting. That being said, sometimes you don't want the production of a big sit down meal. It was nice to have a quicker meal, but the experience was a bit underwhelming. I'm glad we went, but probably won't go again. 

Pros: 
-Food was pretty fast
-Servers were nice
-Food wasn't bad
-Shoestring onion rings were awesome. 

Cons:
-They seemed to be having trouble turning tables. We checked in and we're told a 15 minute wait, but we could see empty tables. 
-We're not actually sure who our server was. I don't think we saw the same person more than once. And it took them quite a while to come to our table. 
-The Mac and Cheese was OK. It was enough food, but it came in a paper cup, so you felt like you ordered a side. I actually re-checked the menu, and yep, it was supposedly an entree. If it was played better I might have felt better about it. 
-Sides don't come with the meal and have to be ordered separately.",4Z_u4X9myqKU5UNIF8MRtA,3,0,3,R2esS150mQkMbZ2SNa_zcg

There was no cover so depending on where you sit in the restaurant you will have complete cover or no cover at all. Bring your shades just in case.
My brother had the our burger, my mom had a chicken sandwich, and I had the patty melt
I thought the menu was pricey overall with each meal costing around 11-13 each and everything was a la carte.
My soft drink was $4, the side of fries and shoe string onion rings were $5 each and the portions were small
The melt wasn't very good overall. The cheese was barely melted and the mustard in my opinion ruined the sandwich. My mom woke up in the middle of the night to throw up. She blamed the carmelized onions from her chicken sandwich. My brother said his burger was okay overall but nothing special.

They were so on point even as I looked around to the other areas where they interacted with customers. That was impressive enough to earn a 5 Star. 
We got the bacon burger and fiesta burger. Not as medium as we'd like but it was all delicious. Fries were great, too! For the price, the fries should come with the burger, but it's all good. 

Atmosphere is open and casual. The pop of lime green colors makes the place stand out. Little chilly in the evening for the bar area, but luckily it wasn't too windy in Vegas.

We sat at one of their outdoor tables to wait. The outdoor tables do not have table service. While waiting two seats opened at the bar, which we quickly snatched. 

Once seated at the bar, staff walked by and didn't even acknowledge our existence. After the 7 to 10 minute mark, we employed a technique that has worked in the past. My wife calls the restaurant and speaks with a member of management. She explained that we had been seated at the bar for some time with no service. We were approached a short time later by the manager who apologized for the lack of service. The bar staff apologized several times as well.

I ordered their grilled chicken sandwich. Be mindful that the sides are extra, not included with your sandwich. Our food arrived in a 5 to 7 minute time period. As I was looking over my sandwich, I noticed a small patch of mold on the bun. When the waitress returned I asked politely if I could get a different sandwich. They were very nice about getting me a second sandwich. The chicken sandwich was very tasty, with it's buttery toasted bun and well seasoned chicken.

When it came time for the bill, they removed my sandwich and our two drinks from the bill. I thought this was a fair resolution to the issues we experienced.

We came to eat around 7pm where their was a wait for a table, but we were lucky enough to snatch four seats at the bar.  Service was great.  Our bartender was very attentive with our drinks and food. He gave us great recommendations of what is good for our dietary restrictions.  Burgers were fantastic.  One of my girlfriends who is a vegetarian tried their non-meat burger and she said it was the best burger she ever tasted.  When she looked at the table, her eyes shot out of sockets and didn't realize she paid 18 bucks for it. BUT she said she would go back and pay for it again b/c it was that good.  I must say, if you are a Wahlberg fan and have watched the show, there was an episode where they were trying to better their fries.  They still need to. Not up to par compared to other restaurant chains. I'm a big burger fan and fries play a key part of the experience of a good burger.  Fries where not crispy and lacked flavor.  Complete opposite of the burger.  Bun, meat and the extras were great. Had to knock a star on that piece.  Sorry, I'm a french fry nut!

My mom and I were super excited to finally try this place out as she's a huge fan of the show and I like trying new things. We sat at the bar and all of the hostesses and bar staff were great and super accommodating. We got our drinks and then each ordered the ""Our Burger,"" mine well done and my mother's extra extra well done (basically we don't like pink in our burgers). Once we received our food we were astounded with how big they were and asked for a knife to cut them in half to better eat them, but once we both cut into them we both realized neither were anywhere near well done. We talked to the bar staff and they felt bad about it and immediately sent the burgers back to be cooked properly. They even said it was explicitly written on our order of the well done requests. They apologized as it was their fault and that's fine, mistakes happen. But then finally we got our burgers back and what we expected was beyond ridiculous. They took the meat off the burgers and placed them back on the grill and tried to cook them to their version of well done then put them back together with the buns and condiments that we had already cut into. Their female manager on duty (unsure of her name) proceeded to bring back our burgers, that were a hot mess, and never once asked if everything looked alright or anything. She just placed them with an attitude and left. We decided to just deal with it and try the burgers to end up taking a few bites and still encounter a lot of pink so by this time we were done. I asked a hostess for a different manager and she was kind and attentive and said she'd get him to come out. He never did (pretty sure his name was Miguel). He let his bar manager take care of it and didn't make an appearance himself when it had to deal with his kitchen staff and not his bar staff. The bar manager, Vinnie, was great and took the burgers and a round of drinks off our tab but the main manager should have made an appearance to fix the issue instead of it being erased like that. I will never return to this establishment with the treatment we encountered. The only good thing was the bar staff and their drinks, but even that couldn't get me to raise this one star rating because of how awful their main management is.",O10J7xYuvkmj80qk9oupww,0,0,1,RnGlqs0MG1yngosldotgFA

I love the show and have been super excited for the brothers and their success of taking Wahlburgers worldwide but sometimes you have to make sure you don't stretch yourself thin.  We were there to celebrate our friends wedding and chose Wahlburgers as the place to eat the night before.  We were crammed into a table against the wall and everyone was a bit uncomfortable.  The server was nice but I do not believe he got a single order correct.  Burgers weren't cooked correctly, some people got things on their burger they didn't order and some items were simply left off.  My biggest pet peeve was they ""sold"" the meals when they brought them to the table.  They yelled ""who had the _____"" which left us looking at each other because several of us ordered the same thing.  If it's done properly the server should ring the order in by seat and the food runner should put the food on the tray in the order of the seats therefore eliminating confusion.  My other issue was the price... holy lord.  $13 for JUST THE BURGER??? I had to check to see if I was eating at a Michelin Star Chef's restaurant with that price!  Sides were extra.  We ordered a side of onion rings and they came out ice cold.  I asked for a new order and the server seemed very annoyed that cold onion rings were served.  Since we were there to celebrate the whole mood was brought down with lackluster service and sub par food.

I didn't expect a Kobe patty dusted with gold flakes, but I was hoping for something a little more than what I was served.  Blah flavor.  Blah toppings.  The best part of the menu was the FluffahNuttah adult shake.  Next time, I'll just order that as my meal.  The plus side - service was wonderful from initial greetings to final payout and departure.  Friendly, prompt, and attentive.  Step it up, Wahlbergs.

Finally I thought my dreams came true when the one in Las Vegas opened off the strip. I recently took a trip this past weekend, I told my fianc√© the ONLY thing I wanted to do was have a creation built by Paul. So Saturday night after a long day of gambling we finally built up an appetite to grab some grub. I checked the hours, they close at 4:00 it was 1:30. Perfect!!! I finally can have my chance to stuff my face with burgers and fries. This was also the last weekend I gave myself to pig out before I began dieting for my wedding. So for sure I was ready to go all in with the BIGGEST juiciest burger they had.... here's where my story gets ugly, we show up I notice the chairs upside down on the tables outside. My heart sinks. There's ppl inside eating, someone even ordering at the chadors inside but all the doors were locked. I wanted to cry. Desperate and about to cry I walk away and remember they have a pop up closer to the sidewalk. I get there, it's just merch but when I ask those employees when the restaurant closes they said they were still suppose to be open?! I explain what happened even they were in disbelief and one guy walks over to the restaurant to check it out for us. Sure enough, closed. I wish I could give 5 stars, I wish I could write this review about a poor hamburger experience but I didn't even have a chance to taste one ): I'm just disappointed. I'm a fan of this family of their show and I wanted to say their good but I was let down. Please don't advertise on your website that you're open later than you are. I mean it's Las Vegas you should be open later than 1:30?!!??? That's still a half hour left to buy alcohol in California. I just don't get it ):",l03PfJCS0ZcARe9IrVaJ8Q,0,0,1,sxzAZKlLPUDl1DjTFj9mfw

We arrived at the restaurant around 2:30p, and we were immediately seated. Our waiter quickly took drink orders while we took a look at the menu. 

I ordered ""The Our Burger"" which is a 1/3lb burger, lettuce, tomato, cheese and the signature Whal sauce, and our group was up for us to order all the sides and share so that we could try all of them. So we ordered the crispy yukon french fries, thin crispy onion rings, tater tots and the sweet potato tater tots. I then finished my order with a housemade vanilla frappe. 

With all of the hype surrounding the ""Whalburgers"" restaurant, I have to admit that I was expecting to be a bit underwhelmed with the food. Needless to say... I was pleasantly proven wrong! My burger was excellent, the bun was super soft and the burger was cooked perfect and served hot. For the side dishes I would have to say my favorite was the tater tots and my least favorite was the thin crispy onion rings (they more so seemed like they should be in the burger rather that a side). And my housemade frappe was sooooo yummy! Must have!

I was super sad. SUPER sad walking out of this place. Not just one thing happened but multiple! And I can't even comprehend how one thing just came after another. 

Babe knew I really wanted to come eat here so he drove out of his way AND we paid $7 to park at the Bally's parking garage. It's a little bit of a walk to get to the actual restaurant. Upon arriving it looked pretty busy and I was so happy and excited to eat knowing it was an actual sit down restaurant with servers. I thought it was going to be something like a you order and sit down so I was wrong... and got giddy. There were a few spots open but looked like two parties ahead of us. Host thought we were party for ""Harris"" but nope we just wanted to put our name down. She said it'd be a 15 minute wait so she took our number and said they'd text us when it's ready. 

We walked around the area as there are shops and bars nearby, however everything was closed at that time so we just walked and took pictures. They were pretty on point with timing. Sent us a text and even called my phone. When we were entering there was a party of three guys who were arguing with the lady asking her why they couldn't sit down in the booth to the left.. I was thinking in my head, if she lets them sit down before us and that's our table I would be so mad. She let them sit down and I was like hmmmm. She took us to a table. Ugh, that booth probably would have been for us. But I'm not picky so we just sat down.

The interior is pretty nice. Green, black, and silver is the theme. Wahlbergs everywhere. Movies and pictures. Pretty cool. Service was eh though.

I'm not mean so I'm not gonna put her name in here even though I know it... but she took our orders, and as for specific happenings... I asked for the sweet potato tots to be extra crispy because I know that sweet potatoes are never crispy when they are fried wherever you order them, and she said ""oh they're pretty crispy."" So what do we do? Trust her. My friend asked for some sauces on the side. What do we do? Hope she brings them to us.

Our food came out in a decent manner. But the tots -- not crispy. And the sauce -- nowhere to be found. My friend asked the food runner for bbq and ranch and he brought a bunch! Thanks man! Once we started eating our server comes by out of nowhere and put my friend on blast saying  ""oh you coulda told me about your sauces why didn't you ask me"" and we were like... uhhhhhhhhhh (it was awkward the way she said it...) she did ask you.... *cricket* *cricket* Much awkwardness...

The awkwardness didn't help the fact that the food wasn't that great. And her vibe not great either. We paid for the check and she grabbed the check while we were still eating... didn't want to wait til we left to see your tip?

Anyway, food was nothing special. Service, or lack thereof, was nothing special. Maybe if the Wahlbergs show up then it'll be special. I am so disappointed!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,13,0,1,PbZCZqfuaML9p82W-RlNNQ

This is the first time that I've eaten at Iceburgers.  I'm a big burger fan.  I love good burgers.  Sadly, the quality of the food matches the quality of Mark's movies.  Less than mediocre.

They offered to cook up new burgers.  Too late.  You only have one change to make a first impression.  I lost confidence and didn't want to waste more time.  I was offered half off the bill and I accepted but a discount wasn't the goal.  I left feeling hungry and ripped-off by Fakeburger.

Las Vegas is a world class destination.  It's surrounded by the Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, the Flamingo, and Planet Hollywood.  We're not talking some trailer park outpost in the middle of the desert.  And yet they want customers to leave their taste buds at the door when entering.

Should have gone to Walgreens and bought a packaged sandwich from their fridge.  That would have been warmer.  

Never again.  

One and done.

5974435,2018-04-26,0,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"Loved the burgers. Our waitress on the other hand left much to be desired. I've worked in the food industry for years and was management at several places. I know how dealing with customers all day can be draining and you can forget things. No biggie. EXCEPT it was 3 in the afternoon and the waitress had no other tables. There were a few things I let slide. As she was leaving our table with our burger orders, she asked if we wanted any sides. I asked my husband if he wanted fries and he replied ""yes"" while nodding and looking at the waitress. I re-iterated the order and said, ""Fries please."" She said okay and walked away. Burgers came. No fries. I just assumed she forgot. When she came back around after we completely finished our burgers and wanted to know if we wanted anything else. My husband said, ""oh... I believe we had also ordered some fries as well."" Totally nice tone, as always. She looks at him and said in a super-snotty tone, ""uh, no you didn't.""  I believe she saw the shock on our faces and then asked if we wanted to place an order for fries. No, no we didn't. That moment passed when she was rude.",Mr9TAke9yrZJr5se9cKJ6g,0,0,3,9OT2bRdghf-Y5VDTVhbHXg

The flavor of the meat was different from your average burger, so good. The burger was juicy, the sauce was also great-- all the components of this OFD burger-- Swiss cheese, mushrooms went very well together. I also ordered the tots-- two thumbs up!!

5983282,2016-12-04,9,ysv6yhVYOoH9Pf7PlMyD0g,"If I could give this place a zero, I would. The hostess was not only rude to our party but as well lied to our faces and to her boss. She told us 30-40 min wait. We waited more than an hour. 

I WOULD NOT GO BACK AGAIN AND TELLING EVERYONE I KNOW ABOUT MY POOR EXPERIENCE.

The rude hostess at the front had blond-ish short wavy hair. 
They told us her name was TONI.
I have her picture posted in the pictures section in case they were lying to us about the rude waitress' name.

Two parties were seated before us (party of 7 and party of 9). She told us the tables outside were for our party. And then she gave it away to a party of 9. On top of that, she told us we were next to be seated when she gave away the other party after us our seats. Talk about terrible service to begin with. 

I would like to think if a hostess messes up and then lies to customers and her boss with differing explanations of what she told us versus what she told her boss she would apologize. But she didn't  apologize and just shook her head at us while staring us down. 

We came in on Sunday, December 4th at 1:39pm

Our dining experience:
One person in our party ordered the OFD. They gave him the bacon BBQ burger saying it was the OFD even though we asked to make sure it was the OFD. We sent it back. They gave us a 2nd burger telling us it was fixed and it was the OFD for sure. They gave us the wrong order with the BBQ bacon burger AGAIN. So by the time he got his THIRD burger our party was already done eating. 

Because of the problem with the hostess earlier,  what looked like person in charge told us he would take care of us because of it and do something to make up for it. They didn't really do anything to make up for it. Initially we were offered no comp or discount until we had to ask. In which case, by that time we were just over eating here. 

The food here was pretty good. However, for the hassle we went through and the poor service that was provided, that's what makes up the bulk of my review.",Y0MzRiIzdvj-wlMEUt4C_Q,11,2,1,a8HFW0cVFbklA5YTXLA7Xw

From the gatekeeper at the front who can't seem to seat people at tables that are empty once cleaned to the waitstaff who can't get orders right or even ask how you want your burger cooked to the cooks who can't cook a burger right (almost so raw it can't even be called rare when they never asked how you want your burger!!!). There for the soft opening after waiting more than a year and all I can say is that it's not worth returning without a major change... Or closing the doors forever. 

This place makes a Chinese fire drill look like a choreographed ballet!!!  Perhaps this place needs to be closed and a Mickey D's put in its place... They at least have their act together!!!!",WtYP4xSdi_4XmYHlnYRvag,4,1,1,ukOxlcFZlYCvsGVjKdq8Zw

You would expect a burger place to ASK you how you would want your burger cooked when you order, but not this place. So when your burger arrives at your table completely pink and you ask to have it cooked longer, they tell you that you MUST wait for all the orders before yours now (why can't they just throw it on the huge grill???)!!! Oh and by the way, pink all the way through in their book is medium.....no it's NOT, that is medium RARE!",63wjzjEBzkd1dHPxUTWfdQ,0,0,2,naaD158yBl038HlIiFFgXw
