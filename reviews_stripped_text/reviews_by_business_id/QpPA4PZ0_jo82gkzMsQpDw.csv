I also witnessed some guests walk out because they were not waited on and it wasn't busy enough not to help them. You may have changed your name but service is still bad.

We had already given up on the buffet which has slowly gone downhill, and decided to give the cafe another try after not being there for so long. Fifteen minutes to be greeted only about 15 tables in the restaurant. Ordered the buffalo chicken sandwhich asked for the ranch on the side and ordered a salad as my side. Had ranch on the sandwhich and on the side , and got french fries. They brought my salad out so I guess I got free Fries. The bread in my sandwhich was extra thick and extra dry. I did not like it but I had a coupon for buy one get one free entree so I did not complain. Not like Server Jerry never checked on us anyways. Watched him get triple sat and greet them all at the same time, after we had waited for so long to be greeted, seeing him and not knowing who our server was at tables next to us. We are an interacial couple and i feel like we get treated differently because of that. But guess what, we are both servers and know how to tip and he definately earned his $0 tip! Had to ask bussers for refills the check and a box. They brought us the wrong check. When we paid, the girl asked if we enjoyed everything. Told her no and start saying why and watched the manager walk off. She said ""i don't know what's going on with our staff today"". I told her it's not just today we've been coming for years when they were still called terribles. They've always had bad service but the food was decent and cheap. Now the food sucks and prices have gone up. After we got out discount and paid I watched the manager come back to the front and they were laughing.

Good price. eggs were good . hash browns were crunchy and soft, which is great. N.Y. steak is a thin cut. it was blandish...lower quality...but A1 did the trick....I am a steak NUT...i should own my own Steak House...I have NEVER used sauce for steak...this one needed it. A steak should be seared and caramelized on each side and hot red in the middle, or VERY  pink...However, thin cuts can't achieve that without being over cooked. So i got an ok steak that wasn't seared or seasoned as well as i like...

But for $6, after 11pm, ($10 before 11pm) i can't complain...just letting you know that the thin cut N.Y. steak tastes like USDA Select, but its passable, with A1 and/or horsh raddish.

So the above is 2 Stars of taste, and 4 Stars of value, so 3 stars average, but food ratings is priority, so leave it at 2 Stars...

The second day, I got the 10 oz. of Prime Rib for $12. I have to say my Cut, that day, at that time, was GREAT...the salad was good. The vegetables were ok. The Au Jus sauce was good, maybe too salty. The mashed potatoes were average and gravy was average.

So, I've been hitting this place a few times a year since back when it was Terrible's Casino, and my experience is always the same: as Yelp describes 2-stars ""Meh. I've experienced better.""

It starts off with the physical plant, which is a low-ceiling, windowless, dim affair to the right of the buffet.  Silver Sevens didn't design the building, and must make do with what they've got, but it's just not that inviting.

So the hostess seats you, and tells you the name of your server, and tells you that s/he will be by soon.  And then you wait.  And wait.  

Fortunately, the bus boy stops by and takes your non-alcoholic drink order, and delivers it promptly, because s/he is on the ball.  

Later the same day, the waiter comes by.  You've had loads of time to contemplate what you want, and you place the order.  

A longer-than-it-seems-like-it-should-be period of time later, your food arrives.  (The busboy has replaced your drink in the interim).  The food is somewhat overdone, and generally flavorless, but you wolf it down anyway because if you weren't hungry before, you are now, and whatever --it's good enough.  The fries are satisfactory.  The waiter comes by on his Halley's Comet-like orbit (once every 76 years, like clockwork), and drops off the bill, unasked for.  You use this opportunity to request items you've been wanting for a while: another drink and a fresh napkin.  He procures them quickly.  

Sterling Spoon is a ""pay at the register""-type place, so you go stand awkwardly near the front, not sure which line is for what (the register handles the lines for both the buffet and the cafe), and eventually pay up.  If you use you player's card, you get a decent discount, and if you use your credit card, you don't have to double-back to the table to leave a tip.

I recognize that Silver Sevens' management has the unenviable task of providing decent food and service on a low-margin client base, and that finding good waiters in Vegas can be challenging, but I can't give them a better rating.  It is adequate food in a pinch, but not worth going out of your way for.  

If the busboy and the waiter exchanged jobs, I would probably bump it up to 3 stars.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,0,0,2,vm4dJdkTXXyOwo7E_3F5xA

Maybe they're leaving the butter on the pan all day and just throwing it back on. I ate the eggs-- toast with butter-- and hash browns-- didn't eat the bacon. The staff there was very nice... But I feel like a lot of laziness is happening in the kitchen. This food poisoning was awful. Be careful...",r7LI2-Ic0zrqJ7w_U6HLuQ,0,0,1,m2Qds6x8YoamdP1KCkPjNQ

We noticed the special deal they had for 99 cents breakfast.  Came in for a quick meal with a graveyard special of course.  

We were seated quite fast.  Server came by right off to get our drinks.  But then there were confusions as to who was serving us.  We had one too many... Another gentlemen approached and asked for our drinks as well.  We browsed what was offered for graveyard.  I got ambiguous and got the steak and eggs with an order of the 99 cent special bacon, eggs, and toast.  Roommate got the breakfast special with biscuit gravy.  

A little later, our meal(s) came out.. Portion? Not bad.. Quite a load.  Of course I had to ask for my tabasco sauce.  Tabasco on everything!  NY steak was quite delicious for the price.  Medium rare of course, so it will cook itself to medium.  I can't complain too much since it was a deal.  Eggs are eggs (from a carton).. But I did enjoy the biscuit and gravy my roommate got.  I dipped my toast in his gravy.  Now that I think of it, I should have just poured that gravy onto my steak..  

Service? What service? On a serious note, the service was quite lacking.  My water never gotten refilled.  I started to chew on the ice for some water.  Also, the server lost our check.  What made it more awkward was the fact that the cashier could have easily asked what we had, but the server stood right beside to see if it was correct like we would lie.

The menu is a shadow of its former self, with the Chinese and Mexican food options gone. The Deuces Wild breakfast special is $1 more and is only available 12 hours a day instead of 24. The half-pound hamburger special also went up a buck. The place always changed menus during the day, so that's not a problem. The menu now has fewer options: that's a problem. My half-pound burger was kind of flavorless and there were two patties to beef it up to a half pound. My son's fried shrimp dinner had four fried shrimp. My wife's fish & chips had a soggy crust. The fries were uniformly good, I'll give them that.  

Service at Sterling Spoon has always been call-it-deliberate, maybe there's a crap game in the back, I don't judge. It was good enough. Food was served hot and drinks were refilled promptly.

They switched management and the current manager moved from the Harley Davidson Cafe to here. 

After the kitchen overcooked our steak three times in a row, the manager completely comped us and asked for another chance. 

Today we were surprised. 
The menu? Focused on America's style food. No more Mexican or Chinese. 

What's there is better quality though, and we realized they nailed our food perfectly this time. 

Cheryl Coleman was great too and made sure the steak was done correctly as well as checking on us several times.

Definition of sterling (n)
Bing Dictionary
British currency: the currency in pounds and pence used in the United Kingdom
of sterling silver: made of sterling silver
admirable: admirable or valuable

Just wanted to make sure the definition I know did not change. They sure as hell dont do British currency. Unlike the definition, this place is not admirable or valuable. Yes they have certain meal deals that are good and cheap but the service or lack there of completely cancels out any specials they might have. I havnt even mentioned what I ended up getting and it was not good at all.

So I get my player card downstairs and proceed to go up the escalator towards the cafe. Wait time to sit down was about 10 minutes which was not bad at all.

Unfortunately everything went downhill from there. 

After getting our drinks from the drink person, we all knew what we wanted to get already without even having to look at the menu. After about 15 minutes, our server finally got around to taking our order. Originally  I wanted to get the Half Rack of Ribs and 10 Hot Wings for $7.77 deal with player card but the lady said that was over and it was now Steak n Eggs for 9.99. That's stupid because just earlier one of my friends said that they saw the 7.77 deal advertisement on one of the cabs. Even still she would not honor it and acted like we were wasting her time. It was obvious that she did not like her job. The bad vibes I was getting from her almost made me want to get up and leave. 

So I ordered the Prime Rib special for 9.99 since I saw somebody receive their order earlier. From that point on it seemed forever for our orders to come out. When I got my order, it looked decent to begin with but when I took my first bite the meat was bland and luke warm like it had been sitting out. Dipping it in the au jus that came with it helped a little. The onion rings that came with it were already soggy. How does that happen when she just brought it out? The mashed potatoes tasted like card board. Fail.

Besides the bad service and bad food, the main thing that really bothered me was the smoke factor. The whole time we were there in the cafe, all we smelled was cigarette smoke like a whole group of people were sitting next to us smoking one cigarette after another.

In closing, to reiterate my experience in a nut shell, bad food, bad service, bad ventilation, and just overall failure in ambience. I am definitely not coming back here no matter what food deals they have for getting treated poorly and the possiblility of getting lung cancer.

The (red) quinoa salad comes with a citrus vinaigrette dressing that is already tossed into the salad.
 My advice is to ask for the dressing on the side because it has a very strong and overwhelming taste that will make you not want to eat it. I sent my first salad back and they gave me a new one with the dressing on the side but I ended up using oil & vinegar instead. It was super delicious!

I witnessed two different tables on different visits get accosted simply for being upset over their food and service received. Their security officers are not only loud and abusive, they will threaten you right out the door!
6) It's truly a shame that such an originally fun and tasty restaurant; has now become center stage for providing SUB-STANDARD service & food.
7) BEWARE of the newer manager during days, as he will talk about customers behind their backs.
8) If you are looking for a good dining experience with fantastic food and value, head over to Marilyn's Cafe at the Tuscany Hotel or Ellis Island Cafe; as they are both just a short walk away from this DUMP!

Note to Silver Seven's Management: If you want this restaurant to ever come to back to it's former glory. I suggest that you look back to when it was the ""Bougainvillea Cafe"" under Terribles management. At that glorious time, this restaurant was always FULL of customers, had fantastic food, service & value along with a HUGE menu. It also had great Chinese & Mexican food menus with extensive options. The ONLY way you will succeed moving forward is to go back to your ROOTS! Otherwise, you may wish to consider simply CLOSING your doors and making your entire upstairs one GIANT LOW VALUE BUFFET instead. ALL of your REGULARS are officially now GONE & will NOT be back! Good luck with that!",rGjpP9NYkBiEHGB9oJJafw,0,0,1,JaI2qirEAL8aBCOmC12n5A

When we told the server his response was "" oh today is cleaning day"". I guess this cockroach is acceptable then.  Then this fearless SOB crawled up my leg causing me to do a jig in the middle of the restaurant.  

The prime rib which was advertised by the waiter as ""fresh"" was completely over cooked, past well done, and had less flavor than a piece of leather.  The baked potato was so cold that after 5 minutes of letting the butter sit on it, the butter was actually harder than when I put it on the potato.  

This place is a joke.  I've never been more disappointed in a meal decision in my life. None of the employees here care which now makes sense as to why the food tastes like $h't.

This restaurant was located inside Terrible's Casino but I think is now called Silver Sevens Hotel & Casino. Our visit was in late May this year and we strolled in pretty late looking for the buffet but was closed so we happen to drop in this place instead called Bougainvillea Café (now called The Sterling Spoon Café). We were seated right away and given a menu. Wasn't much on the menu but we were able to order from their 'Dine After Dark Graveyard Specials' This menu is served daily from midnight to 6:00a. Menu included Biscuits & gravy, French toast, New York steak & eggs and others I can't remember. I had the pork chops with two eggs cooked over easy and hashbrown (see my photo). It was unexpectedly delicious and tasty and the meal was very cheap! I think it was around $4.99. Our full bill came out to $10.79 or something like that. It wasn't the best restaurant  in town but it was okay for the price. Staff was friendly and always made sure our glasses of waters were always full.

The desert selection was great and even had a root beer float section. The sea food was not the best but for the price it is understandable. There was no line for the buffet and this may be due to the fact that this casino is not on the strip and the buffet is upstairs.

4085518,2015-06-13,2,QpPA4PZ0_jo82gkzMsQpDw,"I've had years of experience with this place. Don't let two stars fool you, I love this place. I don't love the place because it has amazing food or great customer service. It's because every time I come here, it's an experience. There are a ton of wack jobs that come here. I have to give it two stars because it's not a good restaurant, but it's a fun experience.

I was used to this place when it was the Bougainvillea (sp?) cafe when the casino was still Terrible's. The main draw to the restaurant back then and still to this day are the midnight special. You can get NY steak and eggs for $6. You can't beat that. You really can't. One of the few places that are still doing consistently cheap dinner and late night food. The NY steak is decent, was cooked medium rare like I had asked. Needed some seasoning, but for six bucks, I added some A1. Their eggs and toast were adequate. The hash browns were soggy, so you can pass on that.

The customer service is abysmal here but it's not due to the restaurant being understaffed. There are 20 people running around at all times. There's no rhyme or reason as to who waits which table. We were seated and it took about five minutes for anyone to ever greet us. We put in our drink orders and then a minute later, we had another woman try to take our drink orders. The food came out in a decent time and the service got slightly better throughout the night, but it's really sub-par.

Plus, there's just a ton of characters there. There was a guy drinking a pitcher of mountain dew by himself who had to shout to get someone's attention. In the past, I've seen people choking on food, fights almost break out, waiters spill food all over customers. The place just has that juju about it.

If you need cheap eats after midnight and want an impromptu show with your dinner, you should check this place out. Not for those who don't enjoy weird stuff to happen around them while they eat.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,1,0,2,guYEJvXPGdpB121uf7qw1A
4145028,2013-10-05,0,QpPA4PZ0_jo82gkzMsQpDw,"This review is for their ""steakhouse "" which is only open on fri and sat , the food was good , but just fancier versions of their regular fare , most items are the same but with a special sauce or different presentation , which that being said is not necessarily a good thing ! Because the price doubles ! The French onion soup is good , but hard to eat in the bowl they serve it in , bread service was a nice touch , when asked about the difference of the prime rib from the ""steakhouse"" to the reg menu , the server said it's a better cut of meat ! , which makes u wonder what is regularly served ? The prime rib was juicy and tender , but really no different than their reg menu , although the veggies were wonderful! a nice mix of asparagus , spinach and zucchini ! The stand out of the meal ! Dessert was a chocolate mousse with fresh berries , served in the same soup bowl ! Lol but none of strawberries were stemmed which kind of defeats the purpose having a fancy presentation , when u have to spit out the stems , Becuz no knife was presented with dessert ! As for service most servers are from the regular restaurant and definetly seem lost in the higher end environment , and most seem clueless about the menu or presentations of the special dishes ! And they do have bussers  a who were for the most part vigilant and kept tables clean and water filled , but really clueless on higher end service and when asked a question said server would be here soon ! Maybe give them the job of wiping wine glasses , as my first one had lipstick or a water stain or both ? But it was a nice pour for the price 7$ ? All in all it was a slightly above average experience , but definetly not worth the doubling of price , as the food is prepared in the same kitchen and servers from the regular restaurant walk in/out thru the service doors and as usual most don't look like they like working there ! Maybe in the future when menu Items are a definite departure from their regular fare , and their service is fine tuned , it will be a nice alternative to the hotel !

4203288,2014-10-24,0,QpPA4PZ0_jo82gkzMsQpDw,"WORST SERVICE EVER! To start, let me just say this was NOT a busy night there. We got seated at a table, a nice lady took our drink orders and said the waiter would be over shortly. 20-30 mins later, no waiter. We stop and ask someone to grab him. He comes over takes our order, I order a veggie burger with cheese, then he goes total ghost on us. Didn't see him on the floor at all. 60 mins go by, no waiter no food. Luckily the manager stops by our table to say hi and we ask if he can check on our food. Few moments later our waiter appears with our food and literally drops the plates on the table and walks away with out saying anything. I start to cut the burger in half and notice my veggie burger has BACON on it. Really? bacon on a veggie burger? Normally I'd just pick off the bacon but it's melted in the cheese.10-15 mins pass and still don't see the waiter anywhere. The manager stops by again and I tell him about my burger. He apologizes, says he'll have them make a new one, and takes the burger back. 15 mins later our waiter comes out with a ""new"" veggie burger and drops the food than dashes again. Same bun same patty (I know because it's already cut in half). All they did was peel the cheese and bacon off it, put another piece of cheese on and threw it back on the grill. After being cooked twice now, the patty is hard as a brick. At this point I'm done, I just want the check so I can get the hell out of there. So we wait for the waiter... And wait... And wait... And wait. Finally he shows up from outside the restaurant drops off the check with out saying anything and leaves. If the name on the receipt is his, than OMAR you are the worst waiter ever!

The service was great, our server was awesome, prompt and friendly, he even spoke Spanish (he didn't look Latino). Sadly I do not remember his name.

Finally got to order the prime rib (medium rare) with coleslaw and onion rings accompanied with aus jus which was so rich and dark. The prime rib was thick cut, at least 1 inch thick, it was huge. I can only imagine the 14 oz! I started to cut the prime rib it was so tender and when I took a bite it was like butter. So tender and tasty. The best I've ever had! The coleslaw was missing something which I can't pinpoint but was a bit tart, hinting some sort of horseradish taste. The onion rings were delicious, crispy, but juicy at the same time. Props to the cook who made the plate of heaven! 

And let's not forget the price, $12.99! You will not find that in L.A. sadly, totally recommend it and the t-bone steak and hamburgers. You will not be disappointed.

4656888,2015-12-05,0,QpPA4PZ0_jo82gkzMsQpDw,"My wife and I go to this cafe fairly often despite our first visit was rather a distasteful visit. I'll start by saying the positive, the food and prices are worth the visit. At the price yo pay you get a great meal that is cooked to order. Very good. 

But overall the wife and I stared noticing a common factor to our visits there and we have the bad experiences. The manager on duty. When he's on duty the staff working that shift seems like they have no training or procedure. 

Tonight the wife and I went there and the hostess was nice and friendly but moves like a snail and takes her time when setting the tables and coming back to seat the next customer. It took long enough I was not sure if I wanted to stay and wait. And when you do get seated and order your drinks don't count on seeing the drinks for about 5+ mins. When the bus girl came out with the drinks she obviously did not know her table numbers or short term memory may be a factor. She came to us and asked if we ordered drinks yet. I said yes, we're waiting on two pepsi. She replied, oh, these are yours then. No biggie, we thanked her and left it alone. 

After that we noticed that the 3 girls that were seated and ordered after us got their food first....well at least 2 of 3 plates. The third girl had to wait....quite a long time cause it was after we got our food and was a 1/4 ways into our meal. Doesn't seem efficient and rather not good service. I think people go out to eat together, not separately. Now our burgers come with endless orders of their really good fries. But when I ordered my next round the table behind us got them even though the lady asked the bus lady why was she getting another order. Again, they did not know the table numbers. 

Finally I asked the waiter where the fries were and asked for the manager. He came back with the fries and walked off like everything was fixed, so I reminded him again, where's the manager. Not gonna lie, I did use the f word when having to ask again, my bad on that one. Finally the manager came as I was paying the bill and my wife told him I asked for him and I was paying the bill, she said he walked off mumbling. Unprofessional. When he did approach me he was very defensive. So I told him all I need is his name and the server's name. He asked why and I told him every time he's on duty we have bad experiences. I then again said I just needed his name. He ignored it and diverted again rebutting with his defensive side say, ""Oh, so like that? Don't give me the opportunity to correct something, just straight to corporate?"". I said yup. ***Note: You want to correct the customer's experience, answer his question the first time to give the customer a sense that you are capable of listening first.*** 

He still did not give me his name. Once he realized that I was not willing to talk to him he asked if I would like to speak with anyone else, perhaps security. Now keep in mind besides my low key quiet and calm voice using just one abusive word the whole time I was calm and quiet about everything, now he threatens security? I'm trying to figure out on what grounds did he feel that was justified. In either case they were not called when I replied, ""And for what reason do you fell I need to speak with security for..."" I paused, looked at his name badge and called him by his name then looked into his eyes awaiting for his answer. That was a wrap on him. He left. I still went and left a $2 tip, the minimum I feel anyone should get even on bad service. And I left. But I went back to get the cashier's name since she witnessed his pathetic attempt to be intimidating. As I approached the manager was talking to her. Now instead of making a second attempt to correcting his mistake, he walked off before I made it to the counter. Sad. 

In conclusion, the food and prices are great. On days this manager is not on duty the staff and service is a good 9. Worth a visit, just don't expect the service to be what it should be. Sorry, but I do not mention names as this is not personal nor would I directly attack someone and they are not present to defend themselves or tell their side of the story.",98T20mbVid1ndCV345vJHw,0,0,3,iWJckDvSfiSL40BAjjI32w

Had items that were pretty good and some that weren't. I can appreciate both high-end dining as well as hole-in-the wall fare. Most items are standard and what you'd expect to be. Many comfort foods to choose from. The deals and daily specials are good choices if you can't decide.

Service was hit-or-miss with this place, depending on the time of day I would think. A couple times the service was really slow, seemed like one server had too many table to cover. The other times were ok and attentive. The hosts were friendly and seated us promptly. 


--- continue, if you'd like to read more ---

Here's a quick break down of some items my friends and I ordered.

The $12.99 steak and lobster was ok. Portions were on the small size, but satisfied a hungry appetite. Adding a few starters helped fill the belly.

Prime Rib entree was average, still satisfied the appetite. Cooked med. rare that way I like it. 

Pork Ribs (my friend let me try some) - was good, bbq sauce had a nice tanginess and kick to it. Tender and came off the bone easy.

-- Starters --
Fried shrimp - very tasty (my favorite appetizer) panko breaded
Spinach Artichoke dip w/ chip - kinda bland, texture was off for me and one of my friends. My other friend said it was ""so good!""
Hot wings - had a good spice and flavor. average but satisfying.
Crab Rangoon - a fried wonton with a crab filling. pretty tasty with the sweet and sour dip",P_GF0rCpPysW5Mskj1L16Q,1,1,3,75Q1AW6b0raAjnDhge8gZA

My only experience with the Sterling Spoon Cafe is after arriving in Vegas on a plane that was deboarded, rebounded and 6 hours late. My only goal was hotel, food and bed, with the hubs and our 3 year old. We finally arrive at our hotel at 11:30 p.m. and we see a huge sign on Silver Sevens Casino advertising 99 cent breakfast specials at midnight. Hey, we only have 30 minutes to wait.

First of all you have to walk through the smoke filled first floor which reminds you why 2nd hand smoke is a bad thing. The cafe is on the 2nd floor and is kind of dark and a bit older to be nice. Our server was great. My biscuits and gravy, not so much. I did like the chicken fried steak which was surprisingly not too greasy and the breading was awesome. 

At midnight you'd figure this place wouldn't be too busy but there were a lot of other toddlers there. I guess they were hungry like ours or maybe they took the same bad flight we did. I'd possibly come back again only because the breakfast is soooo damn cheap. The hubs had the steak and eggs for $5.

I order a surf and turd with veggies and fries all was ok except my steak was over cooked but my son ordered a Prime Rib Steak. Can I just say OMG!

I dare you to find a soup/salad deal under $8 as good and as large as this one. I wish I had taken pictures (I will next time), but a really good bowl of French Onion Soup and a HUGE Half Caesar Salad was $8.

I ate at this place plenty when it was owned by Terrible's and the portions and food tastes were good then. This is even better.

I've also tried some of the Chinese menu, once again, big portions and a more than fair price.

They also have player card specials like a Burger & Endless Fries for $5.50. There are joints on the strip where Fries alone are more than that.",DR6dNFhKppNrSyRZn1CWLg,0,0,5,hVpqFiYmEsEAB3F4hXl0Pg

Service = 0/5 
Coming here on a weekday there were hardly any customers but service was still slow. We were seated quickly, but the time it took before we ordered was about 10min, and there were only two other tables, with only parties of 2. After they took our orders, we than sat at our tables for 30 minutes only to have a waiter come out and us one of the items we ordered is ""out of stock."" I understand that you can run out of items, but it takes you 30 minutes to relay that message to us??? Whether or not it was a miscommunication between the waiters and the chefs, that's elementary basic bull**** that shouldn't happen at all. Not only that, we had the grace of watching other parties come in and get their food served to them as we continued to wait. 

Now after waiting one hour nothing  has come out, and there's not even update on our food? Yah, I'm done with this place. You can take your ""finished food"" for however good it tastes and give it to your God damn shitty waiters and chefs. No diner or patron should ever have to experience a wait that long for some basic diner food. 

From reading the other reviews here on yelp, it seems like the manager is trying to ""help""  well, I hope that manager is actually doing something because as far as I know, that manager is doing a horrible job if service is mentioned several times in other reviews and it's only saving grace is the cheap food for when people are hung over. 

Save your money, go elsewhere, unless you're here for cheap hung over food because it seems like that's the only reason to go to this place.

5332961,2013-10-10,0,QpPA4PZ0_jo82gkzMsQpDw,"Located in the Silver Seven hotel and casino.  Formerly Terrible's.  Last year our cabbie said they had cheap and plenty food and that locals ate there.  We made a mental note but never got a chance.  

This year we decided to give it a try at lunch but couldn't find it. Come to realize there was a name change to Silver Seven.  We drove over.   Parked in the garage.  

The cafe is located on the second floor.  Same entrance for the buffet.  Buffet to the left and cafe to the right.  

We were seated and asked immediately what we wanted to drink.  We looked over the menu.  I ordered the prime rib dip sandwich.  How do you want it?   First time I've ever been asked how I want my prime rib on a sandwich.  I said medium rare.  It came that way.  It was a huge sandwich.  Melted Swiss cheese and grilled onions.  The best prime rib dip sandwich I've ever had.  

Hubby had breakfast.  Pancakes, eggs, etc. He said it was good too.   Carafe of coffee. 

Con - it seemed like it was a long wait for our food.  It came to the table the same time another couple who arrived much later than us.  

If you're allergic to cigarette smoke, this casino is like a huge cigarette butt. We were here less than two hours but my hair and clothes smelled very smokey.

Used the BOGO coupon for a free entree up to $9.99 here. We got the steak sandwich and the prime rib. Steak sandwich was $9.99, came with a side. Steak was so tender. Didn't need a knife to cut it. Topped with caramelized onions, tomatoes, and avocado. Side was cole slaw, very creamy and had some kind of kick to it, like horseradish?

Prime rib was $11.99 and came with two sides. Got soup (clam chowder on Fridays), and mashed potatoes. Prime rib was a generous portion, but a bit salty, but very tender, the jus had nice flavor. Mashed potatoes pretty much what you expect. Clam chowder was a bit thin, but full of clams and not too much potato. Unfortunately, one of the last bites had a shell fragment.

We didn't experience the long (2 hour?!) wait times others have posted. We did have to wait a few mins for be seated, and another few to order. Once we ordered, the food did take a while to come out, but a lot of people came all at once.  We also didn't have any problem with the drink person. She brought us out more waters without us having to ask. Keep in mind there is only ONE waiter, ONE drink person, and ONE busser and they are taking care of the whole cafe. 

After coupon the total was about $12 for the both of us, and we left stuffed. Definitely bring a coupon from The Sunday to eat here. Make sure you already have a players card.",ub5yA93d2pWc0VMPE8Dn1A,2,1,4,pqLZI9sMxJ3l7lUOPpn2kw

We have literally stood in line where servers and cashiers kept working and never said a word to anyone waiting in line to be seated that they would be with us. And waited a good 10-15 min before someone will seat you.

We have made complaints to the manager or person in charge yet it is still the same way every time we have gone in, We are done going here, The people that work here are in another world.
We have even sat awhile before getting food to the table and it seems like they always forget something.

The outside corner has huge, large font advertising for half a rack of ribs with 12 chicken wings and fries for $7.77.  WOW! That's a deal!  So intriguing! We were in a different hotel, were we had no restaurant. We did have complimentary breakfast that finishes at 9:00am. Ummm, I'm sorry, did we forget this is Vegas? Who wakes up at 9:00 in the morning? 

Location of the restaurant was upstairs on the 2nd floor.  We got up there, and there were dividers, where there could have been three different lines going. BUT, not certain, it was just so unorganized. Unable to tell, what's what?  I approached the cashier to ask, and she explained one line is for the restaurant, the other line is for the buffet line. The middle was for people to pass. We had a decision to make; the buffet or restaurant.  My son and dad went to see the food in the buffet line; came back in line and said ""we are going for the deal"".

As soon as we were seated, I noticed the dirty silverware. It was washed, and rolled in napkins, but, still dirty.  I looked around and noticed there was trash on the floors, here and there.  It needed desperate vacuuming.  I'm not complaining, just observing. I can understand, the guests previous to us there must have made the mess. I just feel like, if you are cleaning the table and getting it ready for the next guest, pick up the trash on the floors too. 

After ordering our food, our waitress explained that the only way we can get $7.77  deal is IF we have a players card.  Each players card was good for three orders of the deal. How misleading! My son, (age 22 went and got a players card so we can take advantage of the deal. It was $3.00 of each plate.  Needless to say, the wait was torture; It was approx 45 minutes long.  

Some of us liked our food, and others did not. 1st of all, if you are trying to cut back on salt, do no order the French Onion soup.  It was like eating spoonful of salt.  When the waitress asked ""how's everything"".. I opened my big mouth and told her about the soup being super salty.  Her mouth was bigger than mine and her respond was ""It's French onion soup with cheese, of course it's going to be salty"".   Yes, maybe so, but I've had that soup before, this one surpasses all ""salty foods"".  Beside that soup, my other order was delicious. Can't complain. The special was a-okay.
