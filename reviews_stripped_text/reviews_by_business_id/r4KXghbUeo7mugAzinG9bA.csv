90422,2012-12-26,0,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"With the winter weather that chills to the bone, sundubu jjigae is some major comfort food that'll warm you right up.

To start you off, there's the banchan, which comes standard with the usual kimchi, some pickled vegetables, a seafood pancake, and more. I like the variety they serve up along with how their pancake has a crispy exterior and filled with squid and veggies.

If your stomach isn't filled yet, you still have your boiling hot tofu stew in a stone pot with a bowl of rice to look forward to. I ordered the combination sundubu, which has some beef and seafood (e.g. mussel, shrimp, squid), and pork immersed with your tofu in a spicy soup. They cater to your comfort level of spiciness with a range from 1 to 10, but do yourself a favor and put some kick into it. My only issue is the varying temperatures of our sundubu, since the four of us had soups that were either barely bubbling to just boiling enough.

Definitely willing to give them another shot though! Their banchan and sundubu really hit the spot and will thaw you from the inside out. I look forward to trying their other sundubus and combos, especially their BBQ.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,3,1,3,kcem4Ek7hw_UiM56L5SoPQ

I would say you get a lot of food for the price since korean food always seems to be overpriced.  The side dishes were great, but i would have to say the tofu soup was on the bland side.  Beef and chicken were decent, but nothing to rave about.  I must praise again on the service.  Drinks were constantly refilled and side dish refills were offered (I always have to ask at other places, but in this case the waitress actually ask 3-4 times if we wanted more of the side dishes).

When you walk in, it may not be the nicest atmosphere, but the food and hospitality will compensate for that. The place is small, but cozy. 

Food

They give you a free seafood pancake with your order, although much smaller and less seafoody, but you can't go wrong with free. You also get a the typical korean side dishes (ban chan) as well. We normally order the spicy pork + pork kimchi tofu soup combo, hot stone rice (bibimbap), and kim chi fried rice. Other tofu soup recommendations are the seafood and curry.

This is our go to place when we can't think of anywhere else to go to for dinner. The service is quick and courteous. The mom and pop here are so friendly it feels like you're at home with them.",IegXTpaLReHvm2PSH7sGZw,0,0,5,cpuusNm3yDE58FOks1jP8g

As you can see from my photo, I'm a white dude, but growing up around lots of Korean friends and culture, I definitely know my way around a few H.O.T. albums and jars of kimchi in the garage.  The food at Mashisoyo is homey and authentic in the best way.


The owners greeted me with sincere smiles as I walked in for dinner on a Thursday evening with a friend.  We sat down in front of a TV playing some K-pop stuff, which is still entertaining, even if your Korean isn't so good.  

We ordered the Seafood Soon Dobu (tofu soup), and the Haemul Paejun (scallion and seafood pancake).  The Pancake was HUGE, and full of lots of tasty shrimp, calamari, and octopus.  I like my Paejan crispy, and because of the size of this one, some parts could have been cooked a little longer, but it was still very tasty.  The soon dobu was delicious, and had more seafood than Finding Nemo. Lots of mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari made this eat more like a stew than a soup.  It was hearty and spicy and wonderful. 

Mashisoyo is hidden in a small shopping center across the street from Walmart and next to a Tropical Smoothie place on Ft. Apache.

1409445,2012-10-28,0,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"A fairly new korean place near my side of town (west) located on Ft Apache, near Tropicana. Small place at the end of the plaza with decent amount of parking. 

Kind of looks like a take out place but its not. Small amount of tables (maybe 6-8?). 

Restaurant was not that busy when i had came here but the staff was really nice. I was waiting for a friend to come eat dinner with me later, but some friends happened to go a little earlier. They offered me a chair and gave me their special korean corn tea water too. 

Decent size menu with a variety of tofu soups at around $8.95/ea, combo selections at around $14.95/ea, and different sides (seafood + green onion pancake, etc). They also have bibimbap but i didnt see anyone get it. But im lookin forward to trying that in the future. I think it was like $8.95 as well. Oh! almost forgot... i think they have some ramens too 

This visit, i had tried the beef tofu soup + spicy bbq pork. I had ordered the tofu soup to be medium, but the funny thing was, when it came and i tried it... the spicy pork was more spicy. oh well ! The taste was good, maybe a little on the salty side. I was hoping medium spicy level would have been kind of spicy but it wasnt that spicy (to me... lol) maybe ill try a higher level next time. 

The staff was observant enough to see people sweating, or it being a little warmer, so they turned the a/c higher. Felt a little better after that but still hot (hot soup, spicy soup, and i kind of naturally sweat when eating anyway lol) 

Each order comes with a small seafood and green onion pancake that i believe they make themselves in the kitchen (varying sizes and shapes in comparison to other peoples). For one person, you get a small one, but depending on how many orders there are, they can make it bigger. The one in my picture shows the size for 2 orders. 

Along side of the main order, korean restaurants are popular for their many side dishes. this visit, they gave us 8 different side dishes. 

Overall, the place was pretty good. Clean. Friendly staff. Food decently priced and super close to home. Would love to try other variations of the tofu soup and other items too in the future",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,4,vsyJkdJaGv7gHBZat_Dc_Q

After voicing my complaint to her and showing her the evidence... she proceeded to move said bug around in my bowl with my chopsticks. Then, without saying a word, she whisked the bowl away to the kitchen and within 2 mins....came back to our table to say that she threw out the culprit (how convenient!)

In retrospect, I should've totally taken a picture but how was I to know that this seemingly sweet, older lady would suddenly turn all shady & sh*t!

Service was...a bit confused. Our table kept getting stuff that belonged to the table next to us which was closer to the front and the door. At one time someone came to bring us scissors when we only had soon tofu bowls and the free seafood pancake. before that one of our soon tofus and the uncracked eggs when to the other table. To top it off the other table were two women and 3 kids eating family style where as my table were two guys and soon tofus.

Aside from that the food was...decent at best. No where close to Mr. Tofu which currently holds the number one rank in soon tofu in a restaurant. 

I just thought the seafood pancake was more pancake then seafood and could have been a lot crispier. The soon tofu was VERY bland for my taste to the point where i threw in salt just to liven it up a bit. 

A good note is Mashisoyo is located right next to Perfect Scoop and with summer coming up Perfect Scoop is the Perfect solution to anything.

Here it's all about the food, and the food is divine. You could close your eyes and be transported to another country and a simpler time.  The fragrant aromas swirled and the spices were tart, savory, spicy and sweet all at the same time. Truly the recipes were complex and you could tell that each dish was made with love. I'm sure they were family recipes passed down. 

There was one other customer in the restaurant besides myself.  There were two big screen TVs where a soccer game played. Everything looked pedestrian enough. It seemed like so many Chinese restaurants I've dined in before except without the year of the rat, ox, dragon, etc... placemats. There was a colorful stack of newspapers, but they were all written in Korean. I decided to play with my phone. The big sign out front drew me in. It said ""Tofu"". I thought the whole menu would be tofu based on that giant sign. There were about five tofu dishes. I ordered the seafood tofu soup spiced medium. ""Is that all you want?"" Yes- that was all I wanted, and boy, was I hungry.  

The woman who took my order appeared to be the owner and I imagine the fellow was her husband. They appeared to be in their mid to late 60's.

The sauce tasted like a mild teriyaki and did not make the crepe soggy at all. It was a lovely addition and really hit the spot. I was regretting that I didn't order something crunchy to go with the soup.  

Not long after I finished my vegetable pancake, the gentleman came out with a platter full of little bowls. He put them all down in front of me. I had already said I'd not been there before, so he gladly sat down each of the little bowls on the table and excitedly explained what they were. He was truly passionate about his creations. I started with the roasted crispy seaweed snack. I munch on the spicy version at work sometimes, and felt that was a fun little treat. Next I tried the homemade pickle slices. I haven't ate pickles like that since I canned them back in Michigan from fresh cucumbers. Lovely! There was a little hot bowl that was covered. I figured that must be my soup. Nope. I uncovered it to find rice.  Hmmm.... none of these things appeared to be soup, but I didn't question it. Next up was a light and flavorful rice noodle with a distinct brown sauce. So good. I ended up picking up the little bowl and eating from it despite myself. When the gentleman walked past I put it back down quickly and told him how amazing everything was. He smiled and walked on.  

Next I learned the purpose of the rice. Wow- it cooled down my mouth for the spicy kimchi that I shoveled in next.  It was so flavorful and burned to the back of my nose at the same time. I vowed smaller bites ended up eating about half of the rice and a bunch of water. Wooooooooo! That was spicy!  I didn't learn, apparently, because I ate the whole thing and then moved to an even spicier triangular vegetable. Right then the gentleman brought out my soup. So this was in addition to the soup? I just thought maybe they had an odd definition of what soup was and that I was already eating the main course.  

Yes, what they brought out was definitely soup. The large shrimp in the shell and mussel in the shell floated at the top with nice large chunks of tofu and and squid, crab, clams and oysters at the bottom. There was also an egg in the boiling mixture.  When I broke it open it was soft boiled and possibly the best tasting egg I've ever had. I once read a book about this destitute girl from the jungles of Vietnam who became very well to do and moved to the states. One line of the book really impacted me: she spoke of how wasteful we are when Americans cook. How we throw away useful meat, fat and bones and how bland our food was as a result. It was interesting to think about, but it never really clicked until now. I was transported to a little Asian village where I was the guest of honor and was showered a feast upon.  This is how I felt in this tiny pedestrian restaurant. I had been transported to a different era. It made me melancholy in a way and my eyes began to well. I was impacted by how genuine this couple was and how I felt as though I were a special visitor in their home. I told them this and they said ""No... we treat you like family.""",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,2,0,5,44_doTnFzAWa9gtEziWpYw

(I guess it was my fault since i was talking to my friend instead of looking over the menu. She came over twice and asked us if we were ready, so I ended up picking something I couldn't go wrong with, their Combination Tofu""

Both my friend and i ordered a Tofu from the menu, but we ended up only getting one set of sides? I'd have expected two, but oh well. It also said free seafood pancake on the menu, but our 'seafood' pancake definitely had no seafood in it. But hey, can't complain about free stuff, right? The pancake itself was actually pretty good. Nice and crispy on the edges, and the middle was nice and soft. =]

Onto the combination tofu. I'm not really an expert in tofu soup, since I haven't really tried a lot. I have, however, had a few bad ones. And to start off the tofu soup review, I will say Mashisoyo's tofu soup is FAR from being bad. The tofu inside the tofu soup were not overcooked at all. PERFECT soft tofu that slides right down your throat (be careful not to burn your tongue!)  The amount of seafood in the soup was meager at best. One mussel, one clam, I believe I had two small pieces of squid, and I don't recall any shrimp in my soup.  However, they had a few pieces of fatty pork in the soup, which REALLY enhanced the soup overall. I love fatty pork! And finally, there was a huge amount of beef pieces that were perfectly cooked as well. Nothing too chewy or rough. All in all, I really did enjoy my tofu soup.

I will definitely be back to try more flavors of their soup. Keep up the great cooking! =]",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,4,2,5,tKNa4sWMkTIipJWkYs6Zqw

I gave it another shot for lunch this past week and although their service is good and the family that owns it is super sweet, the flavors just weren't there for me in terms of that savoriness you expect from Korean food. I had their bibimbap which was just okay - the meat was tender but lacked flavor and the veggies weren't as bright and didn't really add to the dish.

From the minute we walked in, it was as if we were visiting our Korean aunt who showered us with food and love.  

We ordered the #10 Combo which came with BBQ beef bulgogi and selected the Combo Tofu Sundubu which was amazing.  A little advice -  I believe they may dummy down and tailor the spice since they're not in Spring Mtn so if you like it a little hotter, be sure to ask.  We got a 5 and it was probably a 1-2 on the thai scale so next time we'll ask for a 7 or 8.  Also the portions as outlined in other reviews are ridiculous.....it can easily feed 2.  

The tofu was extra smooth and silky.  Ban-chan was plentiful and their seafood pancakes has the perfect crispness which must be dipped in their crack-like sauce.  You can pour the sauce on a shoe and I'd like it up.   Think i'm kidding....well i'm not.

To round out the meal, we had 2 milk teas and for the price, i felt like i was robbing these sweet korean people.

It is a rather small resturant with maybe 8 tables that seat 4 people each. It hasn't been that busy each time I've came here so it's not too bad. The staff is very friendly and don't really constantly check up on you. I however, kind of need someone to check up frequently because I tend to drink a lot of water and rather fast too (maybe I'll ask them to leave the pitcher next time). 

Came here a few times to eat, the tofu soups are about $8.95 each and the combos I believe are around $15 (I haven't gotten any of them yet). The tofu soup along with the appetizers fill me up every time so I'm afraid to try something bigger unless I end up sharing with someone. They have some variety in their menu, but I come mainly for the tofu soup. 

I've tried the beef tofu soup, ham and sausage (would not recommend this one, because it's slices of ham and hot dogs), and dumpling ones so far. There's a lot of meat in each of them which is good, but I would rather have more soup since I don't eat a lot of meat. I fill up rather fast with the soups + rice and then the appetizers and generally have leftovers too. I tried the tofu soups each time as spicy and to me they're not spicy at all (though extremely hot).

I sat for a few minutes while I waited for my takeout.  I could see them packing 5 small containers with banchan and then the chef came out with the larger container of curry sundubu.  He asked me if I liked it spicy wiht almost a 'good luck' kind of sound to his voice.

It is strange inside.  It is somewhere in between counter service and waiter service.  The soda machine and ice tea don't work.  There is a bucket of iced cans of soda if you want a drink.  Strange.  In the future I would likely get my food to go.

It was just the right amount of food for two people, but really, I can eat for two so it was just the right amount of food for me.

I got the spicy pork BBQ, it came out on a sizzling plate and was nice and spicy and not too salty. For the tofu soup, I picked kimchi- that came out bubbling.  I asked for them to make it extra spicy and it was definitely that!  The kimchi jigae was actually pretty good, spicy, sour, salty- the flavors were all there and tasted great with the rice. Not sure if I was supposed to get an egg to break into it, but I didn't get one...maybe I need to ask next time?

The banchans were a fish jun, japchae, cucumber kimchi and regular kimchi and seaweed.  All pretty basic, but still satisfied my craving for Korean food.

It's in the back of a little strip mall so can be hard to find, but I love little hole in the walls like this where the owners are actually there and in the kitchen cooking.

Hopefully that helps.

So this place is small. I personally counted a max of 25 seats. The lady who is always there is extremely friendly and gives superb service.  I have a sick obsession with hot Korean soups that remain sizzling in your face when it's delivered to the table.  For the most part, this restaurant specializes in just that: soup!  They have other dishes like seafood pancakes and new ramen dishes I just saw added to the menu.  But DO NOT miss out on their soups!

I'm a creature of habit and I like the simpleness of the beef tofu; however, the quality has been downgraded. The seafood pancake that comes with this meal hasn't had seafood in it the last couple of times I've ordered...the first time I thought ok maybe I got the end of the batter and there was no seafood.  Anyways, this has happened probably the past 3-4 times now.  I know thy premake the batter as I had asked for no onions and they said they couldn't do that. I ended up with no pancake that time.

Now I know Korean food is supposed to be spicy, but I've always ordered the not spicy version since before I popped out this baby of mine. It was always tasty and flavorful but lately it's been blah. The beef is red in color instead of brown and they've been stingy on the beef as well although the beef is so tough it's like beef jerky.

I'm slowly making my way through their sundubu offerings. I started with the combination a few weeks ago. I won't say it's better than Mr Tofu, but any differences are negligible, especially with it being a shorter drive from my house. Tonight, I tried the curry flavor. What a brilliant idea. All the goodness of the soft tofu, but with a nice curry broth instead.

Here's a tip. If one of you wants sundubu and the other wants a BBQ item, order one of the combinations. You get the BBQ item, an ever-so-slightly smaller bowl of sundubu, and some sort of dessert (tonight it was some fruit and a French coffee). The extra bowl of rice will cost you a dollar, but this combo worked out perfectly for Jieun L and me.

On my rotation of places I must eat at in LV is Mashisoyo. This Korean haven offers the BEST tofu soup bowls for $8.99 and other delish Korean homemade dishes. They've expanded their menu throughout the years because when I originally ventured to this hotspot with a gf of mine, all they offered was the tofu soups. I am not mad with the new options, but I will not be getting anything other than a tofu soup when I'm there. 

The tofu soup is bombdotcom. No joke. It comes out piping hot so make sure you enjoy their banchans first while you let your soup cool. Their free banchans (or extra sides that every good Korean restaurant offers) are all my faves: kimchee, aburage, cucumber kimchee, sprouts, chop chae, and, my all-time fave, the seafood pancake. (They even add a bit of pepper to the sprouts and chop chae for a more peppered taste - I love it!) As for the soup, I always get the seafood soup which is full of seafood - #lovethis! And I usually get my spiciness at a 5 - you can choose from 1-10 how spicy you want it. 

I can't say enough about the OMG Tofu Soup at Mashisoyo - it's definitely one of my favorite dishes of all time. So, as you pull up a chair in the restaurant, just keep saying: tofu soup, tofu soup, tofu soup, tofu soup, tofu soup, tofu soup, tofu soup, tofu soup.

5071074,2012-05-06,1,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"I found this place listed on yelp nearby as a new place, and I love trying new places.  So I walked in and I was greeted SOOO nicely, I was told I could sit anywhere (it's a small place, approx 8 tables) Their menu is on their placemat and their logo/address/info is also on their chopsticks and napkins (I actually liked that) A young guy came out asking if I've ever had korean food before and I told him I definitely have. 

I ordered their combination seafood pot that comes with shrimp,clams and oyster.  A few minutes later I get a variety of side dishes and he tells me I can have refills on anything, just let him know.  Now I don't always know what each side dish is by name but I have had a few of the ones they offered before at other places.  It was SOOOOO good, and he was reallly nice too.  While I was tasting my side dishes, an older gentlemen was setting a table and asked if I liked the kimchi. I told him it was really good and I liked that it wasn't overly spicy. (My personal taste is I like spicy as long as it it balanced with flavor, not just simply spicy to burn the hell out of someone's mouth) He told me he and his wife makes that kimchi at home and they ferment it for many months (I forgot how long he told me)  He offered me more and well how could I turn him down I mean he and his wife worked for a long time on their home made kimchi.  :-)

Then all of a sudden to my surprise I get an appetizer of their green onion and seafood pancake (which I was not expecting). It was the size of a mini pizza approx 3-4 inches in diameter. It was delicious.  

Then my combination seafood tofu pot came and it looked exactly how it should have.  They cracked an egg into it for me and every bite I took it was SOO delicious and my server was really nice, always asking me how I enjoyed it and if I wanted more side dishes or anything at all.  

My ONLY comment is this... The pot I ordered said on the menu shrimp,clams and oyster.  NONE of this was in my pot.  Instead I had mussels and calamari.  Now don't get me wrong.. I enjoyed every single bite, but I had picked that pot for a reason and I'm not a big fan of mussells.   Otherwise I'd have gotten the tofu and dumpling pot.  

I don't know if everyone who worked there is all family related or not, but I truly felt like I was having dinner at someone's home.  

My bill was $9 yes $9 for all that food and I tipped him $5 (plus he was reallllly cute lol)  

This place is just up the street from me and I would ABSOLUTELY go back again

- beef bibimbap
- pork ribs - major yumz.  The sauce is really tasty and the pork is very soft.  Sometimes few ribs, and sometimes more.

The spot is super casual with only about 12 tables, and you are greeted warmly and promptly when you arrive. The menu is very simple, which I appreciate. We opted for one combo that comes with soon, bbq of your choice and dessert. (They used to have a red bean dessert until someone complained. They take their reviews seriously! So for what it's worth: bring back red beans!) The soon dubu is all $8.75, even for the seafood option. 

We sampled the seafood pancake as well. Both my husband and I have never loved the Korean seafood pancake, but this one was delicious! It came out perfectly crispy, loaded with the right amount of seafood and seasoned well. 

The soon is a solid contender. The tofu is very soft, and the flavor is good. If you like spice, I think you could definitely order the hot, as my medium was no problem. The flavor could have ben stronger. I am not an expert in cooking (I am more of a taster!), but perhaps more paste would add a slightly deeper flavor. Regardless, I still enjoyed my stew, and I especially enjoyed the spicy pork we selected as our BBQ option. 

The dry seaweed was the tastiest of the banchan. I didn't ask for seconds of any of the side dishes. They are probably not my favorite in town, but that's a minor detail for most. I was also hoping for brewed barley tea (bori cha), but I think they only have it in tea bags. Again, both of these things are minor.

It was my first time here, and I will admit my first time having Korean food that was not in a Korean Barbeque restaurant.  I am not a true expert on this kind of food like some of the reviewers here.  We stumbled upon this place while out running errands and wanting to try a new place.  I had something that I think was called a hot rice bowl, which I chose to have with beef.  It was this dark, heavy bowl that was, predictably, really hot.  It had rice and beef, and an egg on top that was basically sizzling/cooking when it arrived to the table.  I mixed it all together, added a little hot sauce, and it was really delicious.  The sides that came with the meals were also really good.  My husband had a spicy tofu soup, which I tried and also enjoyed, and I wouldn't say I love tofu.  (I am tofu-neutral - when cooked with something tasty, I like it.  If not, it can be a little yucky.  So here, I liked the tofu!)   I say if you are looking for something different, this place is definitely worth a try.  I have been craving this food ever since we went here the first time about a month ago.  I think maybe they didn't have alcohol, from my memory.  (I probably would have had a drink if they had it, and I remembered ordering a Sprite.)  Atmosphere is very casual, a little more like a fast food/carry out place.  But the service was excellent.  I would definitely dine-in or carry out again.

My spicy tofu soup was served piping hot!  They ask about the egg, so you can add it if you want, and I went for it.  The soup was bubbling and it took only a few seconds for the egg to cook through, and added a nice flavor to the pot.

I was so excited when this place opened up because there are no Korean places out here near Russell and Fort Apache. The food is amazing and the prices are soooooo cheap for Korean food! For just 15 bucks you can get a tofu soup, choice of meat, and all Korean side dishes including the pancake. It's more than enough to feed my fiancé and I. The two owners are the nicest people and they give the best service possible!! Definitely can't say enough good things about them. GO CHECK IT OUT!!!!",ZpVkd0ZI5iEq3C9ndawuZw,1,0,5,Mmivk95MAzFMbKfRGS4O7w
5431657,2014-01-27,4,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"The GF and I have a bit of a routine, where I ask ""so what should we have for dinner tonight?"" and she responds ""something tasty!""  This last time while I was visiting in Vegas, I was perusing Yelp for Korean food, and this place caught my eye.  Mashisoyo literally translates to ""it's delicious!""  She begrudgingly went along (we had been visiting my parents the week before, so she was a little Korean fooded out).

In any case, this strip mall Korean seemed like a a family owned  BCD Tofu House.  I ended up getting the spicy tofu soup (seafood) and bulgogi combo, while the GF got the bulgogi entree.  I'd definitely recommend the combos, as the price was only a few dollars more and I got probably 2/3 the bulgogi she did.

The Korean woman who was running the front of the house was very surprised when I asked for things by their Korean names, but was excited when she realized I was Korean.  Kinda cute, and definitely that family owned feel.  

The bulgogi was fine.  The tofu soup seemed a little thin and watery to me, like they hadn't really simmered long enough to absorb the various flavors that make tofu soup one of my favorite dishes.

The space is small enough that I wouldn't be surprised to see some old school Korean guys in there yelling out ""ah-jee-mah"" to get the servers attention, just like they would have in Korea.  I'm Westernized to the degree that I feel awkward doing this . . .",fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,2,0,4,y9183uc2zs9sfYSI-3jsSw
5492514,2013-06-06,0,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"Good prices and portions, but the food was just average in my opinion.  I didn't really notice anything stand out.  We ordered the BBQ beef and the stone pot beef bibimbap.  For some reason, the rice didn't crisp up at the the bottom of our pot either....and that's what I like the most about bibimbap.  The BBQ beef was tasty but a tad bit salty.  There was enough banchan on the table to make a meal...so that's a bonus.  Also there is an advertised free seafood pancake...it really should just say vegetable pancake...since there is absolutely no seafood in it whatsoever.  The service was fast and friendly.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,1,0,3,Gaw9ABNcbwA-TBwQEtkdtw
5514517,2013-09-13,1,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"Great service. As soon as you walk in the door they greet you with a great smile and are really nice. Then when you order they bring you a complimentary small seafood pancake which was nice and crispy. Then when the came out the portion was so big we ordered the tonkatsu plate. It seemed like they put three portions on one!!! I love the variety of different tofu soup we for the seafood one. It had great chunks of mussels, shrimp and scallops that hit the spot. Also just like every other Korean restaurant they bring 5 side dishes with refills!! Definitely will go again and great price for two entree we spent $24 and of course we had a lot of left overs to take home!!!",RVBhvRfflhkasj1lE3NLWw,3,2,5,7fPzBGd9ehgCtEojzDEUEA
5659613,2014-01-14,1,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"Mashisoyo definitely has a homey feel to it. The owners are friendly and cute while providing fast service. I've been there a few times and the quality remains consistent. The lower price tag for tofu soup and dolsot bibimbap is also a plus.

The side dishes are standard. What I really like is the crispy Korean pancake they serve with the soy sauce-based dip.

There's nothing bad about Mashisoyo, but definitely not anything that stands out when it comes to the food. I only go there if I'm in the area or if my usual place is closed.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,0,0,4,wTwUJ_sSEGGQt3ROwOe6Ig
5735008,2012-10-27,0,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"So far, I really like this place. Aside from the service that might need an improvement, everything was superb enough for me. It wasn't busy when we came in but shortly after, it got busy. There were only two of them so they were pretty much running around nonstop so I can understand the service part this time. Plus, I didn't have any complaints since it's rare to be left in peace sometimes :b. There's a bad and a good side to this.

ORDERED:
I got the beef tofu soup (still watching what I can eat post-oral surgery for my wisdom teeth) and the mini seafood pancake. The ""mini"" ($4.95) seafood pancake was the size of a plate. Imagine how ginormous a $14.95 regular sized seafood pancake would be. GEEZ. Maybe one day I'll grab a couple of friends to order that, haha :0).
-- UPDATE: the mini seafood pancakes come with your order but if there are 3 orders in your party, they combine the pancake to make it into a bigger piece

Also ordered the PORK KIMCHI tofu soup. It will definitely be spicy (can't get non-spicy) and if you like kimchi, it's for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it :b.

It came with about 5 side dishes (included in my picture - but they're nothing special and you probably won't care for refills on them) and a bowl of rice. They also gave me an egg that I could crack open and throw into my soup. That was new for me, but then I don't usually eat tofu soup or soup overall. Just been on a temporary soup diet due to surgery.

I'll definitely be back SOON and it's in my favorite side of town. Aside from their busy service moment, the guy that helped me check out and everything was extremely polite and nice. 5 stars all around for now! I'll be sure to update if there are any major changes.

Oh yeah, the inside is somewhat small but everything looks pretty nice :). This place should definitely make it on your to-try list especially since winter is just right around the corner! ^^V",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,0,5,-cE3ZkRK0M9L5W_udBcSGg

5786388,2012-07-15,2,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"I don't understand how people can rate this place so high. The food is just average, nothing special. The pros are the staff is very friendly and the place is clean. 

The negatives are that most of the food is just bland. There is no flavor to any of there dishes. The Sundubu has zero taste to it. Even the banchan is lacking flavor. Just because they give you a lot of it, doesn't mean it is good. 

Even though I live close to this place I would still drive 15 minutes to Island Style to get Korean food that actually has flavor.",mHFUAWOCBQEjJ-Mlpe4U7A,3,2,2,e8k7VVI7ZhGZTjzAXMznOQ
5836789,2013-03-02,0,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"Good food and decent service, but way too expensive for galbi and meat! They also have menus, new and old, that say certain dishes include dessert, but at the end when we asked for them they said that it wasn't being offered anymore. Um, okay, can you let us know before we order and/or update the menus please? I hate surprises like that when eating out when it's been spelled out. That alone knocks off a star or two. 

This place would also be better to eat at alone or with two people for better value, because they give you the same amount of side dishes and seafood pancake no matter how many are at your table.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,2,YWDelUJA5vHjf20MsfhMrw
5918753,2015-06-12,3,r4KXghbUeo7mugAzinG9bA,"Cozy Korean BBQ & Tofu Stew restaurant operated by a friendly elderly Korean couple.  Mashisoyo serves up KBBQ entrees and soondubu (Korean Tofu Stew) in the SW of Las Vegas, which is great if you have a craving for K-grubs but just not in the mood for the trek to Chinatown.

I ended up here recently after meeting a friend to discuss some business ideas.  We were talking about food, restaurants, etc and next thing you know it was late afternoon and we completely missed lunch.  So we headed across the street to check out Mashisoyo (which I thought sounded Japanese), which has been on my bookmark on Yelp for at least a year.

Their menu is fairly simple. You have your choice of typical KBBQ selections that are served with sides. Food tastes good, okay portion, just a tad pricy.  But it is located away from Koreatown plaza and Chinatown, so direct competition is obviously more sparse.  If I am in the area, living or working, and don't feel like driving 15-20 minutes, it would totally be adequate for addressing my spontaneous KBBQ cravings.

The owners, elderly Korean couple, are totally nice and friendly too. I know I said that at the beginning, but that is always a plus when interacting with anyone in person, especially in the service industry.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,4,4,WjGqqGTG5zcvk4RuXsrJNg
