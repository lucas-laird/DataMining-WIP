79822,2012-09-06,0,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"First time actually tasting ""nongreasy"" and ""fresh"" Mexican food-you will find it here!  Sauces are good. Had the steak burrito with rice.  Best mexican rice I've tasted.  They make the food when ordered and I appreciate that. Customer service- Nice! Only one or two people working there however.  Although the burrito is a  big portion, only negative is that they don't fill the sauces to the rim or their sides.    I would expect that for a $9 plate.  Also consistency, first order of the plate there was a few pieces of  chips, 2nd time I ordered the same plate none.  There definitely is a fly problem there as I was waiting in the drive thru. But I must say, you forget that when you take the food to your own home and taste the fresh tasting, non greasy food. I wanted to taste one of their ""fresh"" drinks and twice they told me they did not have that even though plenty of them where listed on their menu.  I would imagine they would be good and fresh as the food if they had their supply.",z86GhT22JyNICps6FrMzbw,0,0,4,oYks0vEVcseg3LKpDJlZhg

345114,2013-04-17,0,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"$1 tacos, decent price burritos for the size. Love the carne asada. My husband and in-laws are mexican and I grew up in SoCal. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but there is usually only one person working, maybe two if it is a weekend. Definitely our go-to place for mexican food here!",b-7E1sgYK4FoYj1CLt0yvw,0,0,5,Ei3zRcEkrdw9w4xzbtaUQw
730602,2011-07-01,0,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"I don't get the positive reviews. Close to $7.00 with tax for a mediocre normal sized carne asada burrito. If the burrito was $4.50 it would be reasonable. It was Super in name only, only a Super fail.  Extra star for the hot sauces that I liked.",-26Qp2RKz7DQwCEKLUbxCQ,0,0,2,xs-hQHwHKXZibtkaiAhjhQ

They are not a 5 star restaurant. .but for a kick as taco shop...they deserve a 5 star review. Staff os reall friendly and keep the place very clean. It is a plesant atmosphere. ..you know how some taco shops smell almost clinical. ..not this place. Love it he..can't wait to be back!",jcNhQxZ8LbT0iEc4Z4-QRA,0,0,5,QL3m5Jaz1S1eI06l6zmuZQ
2147857,2012-02-08,0,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"OK, I know many of you may not get it, my husband doesn't , but I love this place. It might be nostalgia, I lived in No Cal and there was a Super Burrito right by my work. I went there all the time. I didn't have a lot of cash living in Cali, so I usually got the Bean and Cheese burritto.  I love the seasoning, the whole beans and the real cheese.  I can make a refried bean burrito at home. This one is unique.

Now that I can afford it, I've moved up to the carne asada Super Burrito. With their verde salsa, I can't think of much better.  PS you must have the salsas, they rock!",Rmx0SL7c-1B4PCkqub-Q3A,0,0,5,vQHTf7nkDAk0OMFYGKodSw

2664483,2012-04-18,0,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"This place is open 24 hours, not too far from the airport (though a bit of a drive from the strip--I guess I haven't really found a place that is a proper hole-in-the-wall burrito place NEAR the strip, I'd rather not eat burritos at CHIPOTLE or Treasure Island...) and it was pretty cheap.  

The salsa is AWESOME (picture above).  

They definitely need more people staffing it.  There was one guy.  ONE GUY.  I went at a weird time and there were say 6 people hanging out just waiting for him to take everyone's orders and then cook it all up himself.  

I sure hope he's not working there for all 24 hours...",ZMMOMP5kLoXWcm3keolHCA,0,0,4,z90fvNeN80ta8kfBGWOa0g
3875766,2011-08-14,1,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"GROSS!!! I threw my burrito away it was so bad!! First understand I like two things from hole in the wall mexican places; bean and cheese burritos and nachos. Yup...that's my list. I know I'm not creative with my choices but what I like is the easiest thing to make so I rarely find a bad one. My fianc√©es friend goes on about how great this place is, so when the craving for nachos hit we went here. I didn't order the nachos because they put nachos cheese on it. I want real shredded greasy cheese, not Taco Bell crap. I ordered the bean and cheese and almost spit it out!! It was whole beans!! Not refried, not slightly mashed, not nothing!! They opened a can of beans, heated them, dumped them on with a slice or two of something they wanted me to believe was cheese, and kinda grilled the tortilla. I ate three bits and after dumping hot sause on it I finally just threw it away. Next time I'll stick to what I know is good; Roberto's!!",WZ1ZmlF5SRLMPkzNrZ1d7w,1,0,1,s5N14P1_XBulLnFo2OflRw
3916618,2011-01-08,1,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"Just found out this burrito shop opened recently near my house, so I had to give them a try.  According to the manager, they've been open for about 6 months, and their thing is ""no fat"" meats.  My girlfriend and I got two chicken burritos... one super burrito (with sour cream, guac, etc.) and one regular one.  Both were very good, and definitely felt healthier than your other hole in the wall Mexican restaurants.  Unfortunately, they're only open til 9pm, so I probably won't be frequenting this place as much as I'd like to.  Definitely a nice friendly vibe here, though.

4371045,2012-06-06,0,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,"This would have got 5 stars if the last time my burrito wasn't so tasty.  Usually the $7 I pay for the Carna Asada burrito is worth it, but last time, it was off by a lot.  There was no seasoning and it tasted bland.  If they can consistantly make the burrito as good as the first 3 time I had it, it would be my favorite burrito in vegas!",SkUjCvDBA2VNnJWj8DNcdg,0,0,4,sOLKTVfq_G-jLBq878j6YQ
4652935,2013-06-01,0,kDZm3fZcLhotRwC50XE_qg,This place is absolutely amazing! I love to order the chicken quesadilla and the steak burrito which are equally as delicious as they are authentic. The male that is always working there that could also be the owner is an incredibly nice man that makes the best auga de melon! So refreshing and also made well just like everything else. I highly recommend this place to everyone and encourage everyone to try everything here as it's all delicious!!!,OpD0GjW575mCwSSTy_8FsQ,2,1,5,59mMOlChSmVg2YcLBzPQOg

Hope the location becomes a success,it could be a one stop place when you come home from out of town.Way to go super Burrito!",xFTjEM4mbMhaKirrG9wKdQ,1,0,5,XItBfsPDOc1bG071HEwoHA
