The omelet bar offers made to order omelets and eggs with a variety of filling choices, which we both opted for bacon and cheese and were cooked perfectly. There are a lot of different choices, which is great if your with a group or a picky eater, everything from pizza, Mexican to Asian cuisine and sushi.

It was a joke.... $29.99 for dinner which includes alcohol.   The salad bar had greens that looked days old and wilted.  I waited 15 minutes at the  pasta station and the chef never showed up. He was in the back. The Asian food section dishes were nearly empty and lets not even mention latin dishes. Grossssss.  No staff to clean the stations, refill dishes, you have to walk across the restaurant to serve your own drinks and are still tacked with 18% gratuity! For what??? I NEVER once had a waiter come take out plates away?? Save yourself the stomach ache on this place. Visit the Aria if you want a real buffet.

The crab legs were so tiny and cold you couldn't get the meat out even though they were cut in half. Each station had very little selection and what they did have wasn't appealing. They couldn't get wood fired pizza right. Prime rib was tough. For the 36.00 per person it wasn't even close to being worth it.

I remember the food being alright, if meh, at times.  I DO remember this, it was a bit pricey and they have gelato, and it's not too bad.  They also have AMAZING macaroons!  I ate 4 or 5 of them, and even snuck a couple out with me in my purse.  I had to, they were the best macaroons I've ever had, and I don't really like coconut.  Yeah, I'll eat a macaroon once in a blue moon, but it has to look good, and these, just looked like they'd be good (kind of like a Madeline), I'm soooo glad I went and tried one.  I'll admit I spent most of my enjoyment in the dessert section of the buffet.  I had cakes, and macaroons and gelato....

I remember feeling a bit ill afterwards, like I'd need a long trip to the bathroom, (but that didn't hit me right away), or that I was instantly 8 1/2 months pregnant.....instead, we drove home (luckily not far at all) and my friend was sending me text messages from the bathroom telling me how awesome Cravings treated her....and left her in an awkward sometimes painful experience on the loo.  

All in all, it's not the worst, and not the best, yet I've still not been able to find the ""best"" one yet.  Still looking.",ubOe7kfaEnikCGvh1R2oBQ,0,0,3,lnLfVQYn0NLAMYtzVnlUfg

Tried the Italian station first and got the pork scallopini and ravioli. Pork was so tough and ravioli is not any better from the store bought kind. Only went downhill from there with the Asian station. The pad Thai didn't taste like pad Thai. The sushi was bland.  Wish mirage would put more effort in creating tasty dishes.

My husband, a veteran of Vegas buffets, said the  buffet was lacking in the quantity of offerings (among other things). He said he assumed this would be the Vegas buffet he's come to expect so he didn't walk it beforehand. He said it was the worst buffet he's had in 40 years of going to Vegas buffets. The rest of the family, Vegas buffet newbies, thought there were plenty of offerings but the quality was sorely lacking. None of us thought the food tasted good and we tried every station.

My guess is that we went too late. Which is another point to be made?  Why do some buffets close so early? 9 pm seems to early to close, even if it is a weekday. We barely made it time, around 8. The food was cold and our whole group was left feeling less than satisfied.

Well, let me tell you about Cravings! It was honestly the best $25 dollars spent in Vegas this weekend! This place was so amazing I couldn't wait to get home so I could write a Yelp review about it. The selling point was the bottomless complementary Mimosas. 

Not only were we drinking endless amounts of Mimosas, we had the best server ever. She never let our champagne glasses reach less than half full. She was on point. While we were being loud and laughing a lot, she continued to have the biggest smile on her face as she contributed to the intoxication of our entire party. 

I'm not sure if it was my excitement of being at a buffet or if it was the mimosas, but I had the best breakfast ever. I had prime rib, mashed potatoes, sushi, shrimp cocktail, scallops, a burrito, a slice of pizza, gelato, wild rice, awesome guacamole (and I'm picky about my guac) and the list goes on. Everything at the buffet was amazing. They had an omelet station, a build your own crepe station, a sandwich and panini station, a create your own pasta dish station, Pho soup, sushi, prime rib, great deep dish pizzas and even more. The list is never ending. 

The atmosphere was nice. The decor was open and modern. The service was excellent and it was definitely worth $25 per person.

They don't have enough options of the different types of food they offer at each station. And it is now a brunch and dinner option only... which limits the good lunch options because of an extra station of breakfast foods (at 2 in the afternoon most people were not even touching the food at that station, which is a waste of food and space that they could be using for foods that people would actually eat).

Gelato red velvet cake cookies  cupcakes that are just so cute and great tasting. Great salad bar. For about 20 dollars plus tax you can enjoy all this . People please don't complain about prices you are better off eating here for about 22 dollars (they DO have military discount) than going off some food court.

We stayed at Caesars palace and asked if we had our reception at their buffet after the wedding if they could work with us on the price since I paid for 6 rooms for 3-4 days. They said no. So I visited Cravings and they were so nice and accommodating. ..and they honored a AAA 20% discount which they brought up. The managers and hostess were so nice. The food was delicious And it included unlimited beer and wine. They saved me over $400 over the buffet at Ceasars. More importantly they  were friendly. .. we will stay at the Mirage next time and visit them again.,qg8kCEagOTspu3DNq7XY9w,0,0,5,Z-H_zBFo_SD89YqP3aieOw

They excelled in many selections... the ceviches and shrimp were fresh and yummy, the smoky gouda and wine soaked cheddar and italian meats were flavorful and upscale, the asian pork buns, pot stickers, and eggrolls were fresh and spiced well. Their pizza is really good too! 

The entree selection is where it falls short. If you want prime rib, your in luck (but even then its a crap shoot, because sometimes they have a medium and a rare cut and sometimes they just have medium), but it is seasoned well and when rare is available, quite good. The other choices are mediocre and just not worth it... chicken, ribs and nothing with panache. The service can be sketchy as well. I overheard the hostess and they had only 8 servers that night so getting a drink was daunting. Desserts are dependent on the evening... sometimes spectacular (blood orange shooters and panacotta with strawberries) or sometime dull ( bread pudding and cupcakes).

My wife and I went for lunch last week. Man, was I disappointed! I read reviews that the ""live"" stations were good, but what I experienced was pretty sad for a supposed ""upper tier"" buffet.

The wait to start the buffet wasn't too bad, about 8 minutes or so. It was a Wednesday around 1:00 pm.

It's like a giant horse shoe layout with a very odd and VERY limited amount of choices. Very spread out. It started with so so pizza, a few pasta dishes I just wasn't interested in and a carving station that had prime rib and turkey, (which wasn't bad, to be fair). 

Next was the lame taco bar which really seemed out of place and again slim pickin's.  Then there were a few odd fish choices, but nothing that really looked to good. The Chinese dumplings were one of the few highlights. 

The sushi was pathetic. No actual fish to be found. Argh

There was a somewhat okay cold cut and cheese selection though with a few nice salads and the gelato was excellent. The dessert plates were pretty good.

The wait staff was attentive and did take care of the beverage needs well.

But, over all, I wouldn't spend 19.99 plus tax per person on this lunch again.

Excellent variety makes this an affordable choice for families, with lots of food that appeals to both adults and children.

Con: All food tends to be filling, and the sheer quantity does no substitute for quality. For instance, I have never, ever had such mashed potatoes that they tasted like cardboard soaked in chicken broth....with similar consistency. Or gelato that's was really just syrupy sorbets. 

However, you get what you pay for. At around ~$30/person, you still get crab legs, shrimp and sushi. The  environment is less fancy than Wynn, and the quality is a bit lower, but I feel the unlimited beer and wine make up for that. Not to mention the lower price.

The serving layout has changed since my last visit. The area at the far wall where the seafood selections were located next to the bar has been replaced with more dining tables. This means to get from one side of the serving area to the other, you must now carry your plate through the dining area and thread your way through the tables to reach the other side. That's OK unless you've had a few drinks in the casino before your meal.

Speaking of drinks, our server refused to take our drink orders for wine. So what's the purpose of placing a drink menu on the table? We didn't find out until after the meal wine and beer are included with the price of the buffet. Oops. There goes your tip.

As usual, people keep saying how good the ""King Crab"" legs are. I want to tell those here on Yelp who keep posting ""Yeah, King Crab!"" pics, those are snow crabs. You know who you are. They were sliced in half, dry and had no flavor. I've had better in California casino buffets.

Buffet foods are food made in mass so quality is always pushing mediocre to a little better than that. It is hard to keep quality high but cravings does a good job. They are bigger buffet with a larger variety out there, you are in vegas! For brunch they have an omelet bar, prime rib, snow crabs, lots of asian choices, some dim sum and the usual varieties of sushi and chinese food. They also have  salad and sandwich bar which is great. They have breakfast foods, italian, mexican...there are foods from all parts of the world.

The dessert bar has a prettt good selection. I like their bit size selection so I can take a bite out of a variety and not feel guilty. They also have a gelato bar in the far corner which is nice.

482514,2011-08-18,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Back in the day (especially when it was under the helm of Steve Wynn), the buffet at the Mirage was the nicest one in town. And even when it took a back seat to fancier, pricier, and more popular offerings from newer resorts such as Bellagio, Paris, and the Wynn, it still held its own as an excellent above average Vegas buffet. As recently as one or two years ago, Cravings offered a great dining experience. While you didn't get more upscale items like seared ahi or beef wellington, you did get a wide selection of food that was delicious and fresh. I recall prime rib that was juicy and tender, mounds of moist crab legs, and steaming entree selections. Well, not anymore.

Now things have gone noticeable downhill. The prime rib which I remembered so fondly was overcooked. My piece of medium prime rib had hardly any pink left in it and no juices running out of it when I cut into it. I can't imagine what a piece of the well done would have tasted like. The crab legs looked a bit dried out and only enough was put out throughout the evening to cover the ice underneath. A lot of the the other meats offered at various stations were also a bit overcooked. Knowing that buffets typically undercook their food slightly (since the heat from the steam trays and lamps finish the job) it suggests that the cooks were not careful with their technique or that the food was just sitting out for too long. 

Many food items were not being replenished or refreshed as often as they should have. The two bowls of ceviche I wanted to try were half empty, with much of the seafood already picked out of it. It remained this way for the entire duration of my meal. The hand rolls at the sushi station were replenished sporadically. And meager allowances of crab legs on the ice tray left me feeling like I was constantly picking through leftovers.

Service at the tables was adequate, but service at the food stations was detached and unfriendly, with hardly a smile to be found. I also had to make three trips to the gelato station before finding someone to offer me a scoop.

To be fair, none of the food at Cravings was bad enough be inedible or unpalatable. At a lesser buffet in a lesser hotel, it might have been passable. However, at $26.99 for a buffet at the Mirage (Bellagio was only a few dollars extra this weeknight) I expected more in terms of quality, freshness, and service.",jU5wjeRfBeC6aUH_dnq7dA,3,0,2,Lpa_v-lPHQ__-wRFL6wyTw

The food is still good and though it has long since been eclipsed in variety and quality by others across the Strip, what struck me today was how few of the staff bother to smile at the guests, and none more so than the staff tending the actual buffets. Indeed one whose name I noted was Bernard (an elderly chinese or other asian) was irritated that I had asked for a slice of prime rib as he was busy filling a bowl of horse radish. He made me wait until he was finished and then quickly sliced a dry piece which he flung on to my plate. Another staffer (an african american man, late forties/fifties, didn't catch his name) looking after the breakfasty items (this was their midweek brunch service) ignored a question I had and disappeared off inside. Sure the rest of the reviewers are right here - there was no line and the food was solid. But the key to hospitality is not just about product, but more importantly about making people feel at home. The Mirage has lost that quality from 20 years ago when it was fully staffed by professionals who remembered the golden era of Vegas and had been chosen by leadership because of their interpersonal skills. I question if Mirage leadership, certainly at the buffet restaurant, is being as critical now. Remember, this isn't a cheap meal at $23-24 and the Mirage is still deemed a four star brand. Not sure if Mirage leadership look at reviews like this but the staffer details are included for them - for the rest of the readership, I do suggest that there could be several reasons why some buffets have long lines and the Mirage has no line.",fjGmQnaCvELcRqNOoPz-nA,0,0,1,NIbWANL02AtjHJoY67ZOVg

So many guests with rewards kept coming in that none of the regular guests (my family and I) were getting transferred to the line to get seated. Yes there is 2 lines, 1 to actually pay, and then 1 to get seated. It was so frustrating because no one was controlling the intake of the rewards guests so they kept coming in by the herds! So unfair to everyone else. The overall decor and layout of this buffet needs to be severely updated. Nothing had that ""Wow"" effect like Vegas buffets should have. You had your usual Italian, Asian, American, Salad, etc. stations. There was a lot to choose from but the food was so bland or just down right gross. This is one of the cheaper buffets at around 30 bucks after my AAA discount and the quality of the food definitely showcased the mediocrity of the buffet.

I found it had tons more selections than any other buffet and if you have a bad server, you won't be getting drink refills without waving them down.  Stop being lazy, it is a buffet and I think self serve drinks just make perfect sense too.  I've experienced at the Wicked Spoon that my server took forever to clear plates and refill drinks.

A little thing I noticed was that certain sections they don't refill or replenish the food very well.  For example the Asian food section had a lot of empty items and did not get filled up even by the time we finished eating.  Maybe they just thought no one would get any which does make sense.

- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",8vIK6ndl8yzIdmSDnGp0tw,0,0,4,u1jQX0KfnG3AHty4ifEpFA

One thing I really liked about Mirage buffet better than other buffets at Bellagio and Mandalay bay is because for Prime rib, mirage has two choices, medium rare and medium, also the snow crab has cold and warm options, no other buffets have this choice, furthermore, I found out that the buffet include unlimited wine and beers. Also, the price is a little less expensive than Bellagio and Mandalay bay. I paid $29.95 for dinner buffet which is very reasonable.",7aOcMcj7m-AoZsoRJAZ94Q,1,1,4,Ctya6tBNOIRjGEiMDNYJlw

We stayed long enough for early dinner which starts at 3pm.  They brought out the amazing snow crabs and roast beef.   The soups are limited but are pretty good. Can't ask for a better deal with this quality of food.  The only down side is the limited selection of food for each ethnic section.

We waited in line for over an hour.  We were then seated next to the glass wall where hungry people who had been waiting for over an hour pressed their noses to the glass, watching us eat our meal.  They didn't have enough staff and the place was a mess with dishes stacked on unoccupied tables.
The snow crab legs were puny and hard to eat, and the steamed clams were all closed, meaning that they were low quality or dead when they were steamed.  The turkey was dry.  
A few of the servers behind the counters had attitudes, and our server complained about how tired she was throughout our meal.  My wine glass (alcohol was an extra charge) was dirty and that wasn't remedied until after I was done eating.  The dim sum bar was good and the sushi rolls were passable.  The gelato was good.

I did not care for the wine at all, and the only complimentary beer offered was bud light. Personally,  I don't consider the free beer and wine a perk.  You pick up your drink from the bartender, so that is a separate tip from you server...not so free since the glass of wine isn't even worth a buck.  There was nothing here at the buffet that wowed me.  My partner liked the prime rib, but as usual he says it tastes like roast beef and not prime rib.  They are too heavy with the peppercorn as a seasoning on the outside.   The chinese broccoli and asparagus looked really fresh and delicious, but looks were deceiving.  They looked fresh, but both lacked flavor, were too oily and tough.   They have someone tossing your salad for you, which is a nice idea to have one person handling all the salad items, but the reality is a long line at the salad bar.....ugh.   Why not hire someone to make fresh sushi rolls instead?   The fresh fruit was nice, but in typical Vegas buffet fashion, the desserts are more for show than for taste.

Mainly because the wait at Wynn was approximately 3.5 hours. THREE AND A HALF HOURS, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

The wait to get in here at Cravings was only about 15 minutes and totally worth it! Just try and get there before the dinner rush starts. We were in line by 6pm.

This place had a TON of food. Great variety. Prime Rib was delicious, nicely cooked, seasoned & the au jus was perfect. Questioned whether the mashed potatoes were authentic or of the instant variety, but it was so tasty, I stopped wondering & just enjoyed myself.
The personal salad bar was great. Got just the right amount with everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. The guy tossed it for you and everything. Very nice.
The sushi was sub-par but I guess that's to be expected. I tried every roll but just by the look of it, you could tell it was whatevers.
The Chinese food they had was really good too, just the basics. & Tasty sweet & sour soup!
They even had Pho! My parents had it and said it was lacking one thing - MSG. Of course.
The seafood was really good! King crab legs, sweet succulent shrimp & the best breaded shrimp ever! Sweet & well-seasoned perfection.

They had Mexican food as well as Mediterranean food. I saw hummus, pasta, bbq, etc etc. Really something for EVERYONE. Great variety! 

The dessert bar wasn't anything too special. Meringues, cake, fruit tarts, macaroons that we all swooned over. But the best part? GELATO! A nice man behind the ice cream bar who would scoop you whatever you please. Coconut, coffee, strawberry, vanilla... only thing missing was green tea. That would have cleansed the palette nicely. Oh well!

We've tried The Village at Paris, Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Buffet at Treasure Island, and Flavor at Harrah's.  We weren't too impressed at our last visit to Cravings.  It was much better this time.  The restaurant walls are all glass so you can see out and people can see in.  We got a nice table for four in the middle of everything and a nice waitress who brought drinks and cleared the table when she came by.  The first section has someone who is usually making egg dishes.  In our case, omelets.  They will sautee the onions, bacon, and mushrooms and then add it to the omelete.  They have one main guy and he has helpers.  They have a tip jar too.  
Next section along the wall was some cooked items, eggs benedict, either waffles or pancakes.  Whatever was there, a customer in front of me wanted what wasn't there. 
Then there is the meat person.  He had turkey  and prime rib.  The prime rib was well done.  There was au jus and turkey gravy in that section too.  Next was the roast chicken section, fondue and bread/crackers. The fondue didn't harden by the time I got to the table and it tasted okay. 
The next wall had mexican food, but it wasn't well organized or I was going the wrong way.  I walked by cheese, then the meat, chips, taco, and tortillas, salsa, and enchiladas.  Before I forget, the enchiladas were good.  
There was some ceviche and tiny shrimps in little glasses, shrimp on ice in the cubby holes in the walls.  I don't have a good way to describe it.  I tried the clam chowder and it needed pepper.  The texture was clam chowder and it looked good, but it wasn't really tasty.  There was a Japanese counter.  I thought the crunchy spicy tuna roll and unagi roll was too cold.  
The Chinese counter had shrimp flavored chips, yummy, but greasy. It was either a gyoza or potsticker and it was on it's own little plate with a little sauce.  It's the presentation. 
Everything was clean.  Hot and sour soup was the right texture but not enough flavor.  Chinese noodles and rice, sauteed veg and sweet and sour chicken or pork.  I didn't try it. 
The last section was dessert.  They had mini cupcakes.  I liked the chocolate and regular creme brulee cups.  There were also tiramisu in a little cup and I think it was a berry flavor panna cotta.  And the very end had a gelato section.  The tiramisu gelato was good.
There is a lot of food dishes that I'm not mentioning.  The Village was our favorite at one time, same with the others, but we go back and then we are disappointed.  The eggs benedict wasn't very good, the hollandaise sauce didn't stand out.  The presentation is usually much better at Cravings.  There's so much food that we kind of try everything and then we are full.
  
Summary - Cravings was better than our last trip.  Kids were happy, waitress was nice, no dishes were really bad, everything was clean and presentation was nice.  We'll be back and we'll also go back to the other buffets too.",jkcJ8lbgKz0-TbaNQmy98A,0,0,4,fYFUbNOMqjo4LeDPEw3WvA

So after packing five pounds to my fat ass, I proceeded to the other stations.  Prime rib was good (Hey Miss meatcarver lady - don't be so chintzy with the pieces please).  Sushi station was disappointing; everything looked dry.  Seaweed salad was delicious; that alone kept me coming back to the sushi station.

- food from different parts of the world were served in different sessions, but they were very spread out, and it almost took me a minute to walk from the Italian session to the Japanese session! 

+ the only plus was that their prime rib was actually pretty good.

Selections were so limited in those sections and the desserts' qualities were no more than just any neighborhood buffet level, which is a let down considering this is Vegas. Their best section is the Italian section! Really delicious soup selections and pasta! Don't have much to say but if you're wanting to fulfill your vegas buffet fantasies, this isnt the place, go for bellagio or caesar's palace buffets.

I didn't think the food was really that great. The food didn't really taste good to me, nor really appeal to me. A lot of the food was pretty dry and quite disappointing. But my husband did thoroughly enjoy his crab and shrimp though.

Anyways, like any other buffet in Vegas, there are plenty of food choices to choose from. There is a dessert section, an Asian section (pho is actually served but I didn't try it so don't know if it was any good or not), a Latin section, a carving section, a salad section, a seafood section, an Indian section and so on. The decor is nice and simple. Generally everything is pretty clean and our server was very friendly and chit chatty. She was really nice at suggesting places for us to go and asked how our stay was at the hotel we were staying at (Alexis Park Hotel, which is 1 mile away from the strip). She was great at clearing our dirty dishes quickly and refilling our drinks. She also was really nice in giving my husband a cup of beer to take with us when we finished our meal and were ready to walk off some of the weight we just gained on the strip. 

Oh and by the way, there are no restrooms inside the actual buffet but located right next door (so you will have to walk outside of the buffet and come on back... and you'll have to remind the people at the front).

For the discounted price we paid, the buffet was just fine at feeding the 2 of us. But if we were to pay the full price per person, I would rate the buffet even lower.

That said, I found Cravings to be a disappointment. It has about 10 different ethnic stations with each station having a handful of food options.

I was visiting Las Vegas with my parents and trying to show them why the buffets here are impressive, and after searching Yelp for the right one, I chose Cravings.  We were there at about 8pm on a Saturday night.  There was no line, which probably should have been an indication that it wasn't great, but at that point we had been looking for the ""perfect"" buffet and were just tired of searching.

They had a wide variety of categories to choose from: Italian, carved meat, Latin, Mediterranean, Seafood, Sushi, Chinese and Salad.  However, within each category was the most basic of each food.  

Italian: Pizza, pastas with either marinara or alfredo sauces. (I was hoping for fire baked crust and made-to-order pizzas, rather than old, hard cheese and meat)
Carved meat: Prime rib or Turkey (where was the sirloin steak and 
Latin: Texas chili (not Latin!), tamales, and enchiladas
Mediterranean: pita bread, babaganoush, hummous.  (that's it??)
Seafood: chilled cocktail shrimp and crab legs (they were too salty) and baked tilapia and salmon (typical)
Chinese: stir friend veggies, beef chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken (comparable to Panda Express)
Salad: romaine lettuce with your choice of dressing, and vegetable toppings (I was hoping for fruit toppings and candied nuts)

And for dessert:  only a couple of selections of pie: dutch apple, raspberry chocolate silk, lemon merengue, and sugar free cheesecakes.  Throw in a few choices of rock-hard cookies and fresh fruit.

I was expecting much more, to say the least.  I probably won't be coming back again, with or without my parents.  They weren't really impressed and we all felt that money spent on food did not match the quality.

First thing, they GOUGED us on price because it was Memorial Day weekend.  My girlfriend paid, so I didn't see the cost til it was too late.  That put a bit of a damper on things, because I was ticked from the get-go.  I don't even want to say what we paid, because it's embarrassing.  We really should have walked out and gone to STK or something, it wouldn't have been much more.

So, let's start with the ""good"": Our server was VERY nice!  She was a doll and should really be serving somewhere better.  The pot-stickers and shrimp/pork dumplings were edible.  In fact, with a little Sriracha, they were pretty good.  The chilled shrimp and crab legs, on this day, were perfect.  The legs weren't huge but they were nicely split and easy to access the meat, so it made them easy to eat.  I really should have just stopped there.  OH, actually, the prime rib was decent.  Actually, when we got some fresh out of the over, it was really tasty.  Cooked just right, amazingly enough.  There, I should have stopped there.

The ""bad"": The chinese food was crap.  Worst garlic beef, ever.  Chewy, nasty pieces of meat and the sauce was like gelatin.  The breakfast options must have been sitting out for hours.  The eggs had a crust on them 1/2"" thick.  I couldn't even force myself to get any.  The bacon had been sitting for a while too and had gotten soggy.  HOW does bacon get soggy???  And the desserts?  If it wasn't for some OK gelato, I would have gone all Hulk on this place for the crap desserts.  The chocolate cheesecake actually made me physically sad.  And then the ""key lime pie"" made me really mad.  Bah, I don't want to talk about this anymore, it's just depressing me.

My recommendation, avoid the buffets.  Unless it's at a very high end establishment and they have freshly prepared food items, it's just not worth it.

Alcoholic drinks are not complimentary (some buffets do have wine and beer inluded)....

Organized set-up for the food because it is simply a large oval & nothing in the middle besides tables. The food quality is good. 95% of everything I tried, from the pizza to dimsum, were all delicious. 

One thing I did not like was their Spicy Tomato Soup. Holy ishhhh, one slurp tasted like a whole bottle of hot sauce. I understand it had to be spicy but it didn't have to be dsfhdkjhsdfkgjfskjldSPICYYYYYY! Besides that one particular item, I liked their food.

Don't forget the extensive dessert selection, tucked in the corner. I think I ate too much of the Creme Brulee because it was SO yummy! Really cute arrangement for the sweets but ice cream flavors could definitely improve. They need more, I think.

Overall, it's a good place for a buffet. But don't expect it to be Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon-esque. Those are the big league of buffets. I consider this the minor league but consistently yummy food so I'm a fan!",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,2,1,4,bM2Co0CXhR-rcJ9tJRd1XQ
1402076,2013-02-18,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"The service  and presentation were good, for once, at a buffet. The food on the other hand was just unimpressive. It wasn't as bad as the buffet at Paris, which is a completely different review. The buffet offered lots of cheap food nicely presented and most items lacked a palatable meat component. The bowtie pasta had no meat, the hunan chicken was mostly vegetables. This is a review of the champagne brunch only so maybe they held back until dinner time.

I arrived back to my table only to notice the plate was full of low quality sausage and carbs. Where the heck was the meat? Did I miss a whole section? I don't like prime rib at a buffet, considering you can't throw a stick without hitting a steakhouse in Vegas so I came here for variety.  I can't eat shellfish so I lost 2 out of 9 whole sections there.

Cravings offers a mid-range price for middle of the road tastes and satiates a seafood fix, but otherwise I'd pass.

Lastly, I did use a TravelZoo deal and was unaware they charge you tax on top of the deal. It wasn't the fact that it was $2 extra it was partly the fact they waited til I got to the door to tell me and the cashier was useless. She immediately states ""want to speak to a manager?"" as if it's not her problem and she has no explanation. Why bother?

We have eaten at tons of buffets and the food in general tends to be just so so (with some exceptions). Some dishes are fairly decent but most just alright. What this buffet truly does more poorly than any other here in Vegas is service. We were a large party (16) and of course had to pay 18% gratuity upfront. Ok, fine. Many of the people in our group work in the service industry in restaurants so we expected the upfront tipping. We have been paying this upfront 18% all weekend and have had really great service at the restaurants we have been to. However, our ""server"", who got tipped over 100 dollars, informed us that if we want the beer, coffee, sodas, or bloody Marys that came with the meal, we had to go and get them ourselves. The bartender where you got the bloody Marys was extremely snippy making it unpleasant to go up and get a drink. Our server couldn't be anywhere to be found. We had to wait and wait (many of us waiting over 20 minutes) to get champagne (which was one of the few  things our server could actually serve us) and she rarely cleared the dirty plates. Our plates sat and sat in front of us. So she got 100 dollars but didn't have to bring food or most beverages to the table and didn't clear the dishes until we had a couple piled in front of each of us. A member in our group finally went to find her and spoke to her and she made slightly more effort but it was, all in all, a pretty bad experience. I highly suggest to spend a little more and go to the Belaggio or the Wynn where both the food and the service is so much better than here. Paying a server that much money for basically clearing a few plates is ridiculous.",lxE0S3wjYInICo_GHgRoPA,0,0,2,lFIIQdE95VUf8Ly5M7776Q

Very short or even no line (didn't really matter for us either way because we had line passes as guests of the hotel) that immediately puts Cravings a step ahead of Spice Market and Bellagio Buffet where the line waits would easily be 30-60 minutes.   Pricing for dinner was under $30 which I think puts it right on par with Spice Market and cheaper than Bellagio.

  Food quality and variety. I think Cravings actually had way more variety than any other buffet I've seen. Gyros, Wonton noodle soup, salads, soups, ice cream...whoops I mean GELATO!!!, desserts, pasta, pizza, and of course prime rib and all you can eat Alaskan king crab legs. Now how's the quality...okay I'm going to put the quality of their food somewhere between Bellagio and Spice Market Buffet. Which for the same price as Spice Market is a damn good deal.

  Service also was excellent, even considering our party of eight. Atmosphere, ambience and cleanliness also felt right on par with Bellagio. I'll admit Spice Market feels a bit dingy, but Cravings had a nice atmosphere to it.

  Anyway with all said above. Cravings is now my #1 buffet in Las Vegas. Good price, no line, excellent variety and quality of food, good service, and nice atmosphere. I mean what else could you ask for.

Even on the VIP line I waited around 10minutes as people fumbled for the right cards and ID to get their appropriate discounts. Upon entering they advised that house beer and wine were free. A very nice touch if you're consuming. 

The first station was omelettes, the second station was pizza. Breakfast, pineapple, pepperoni and grilled chicken. Worried that I may not see anything better I grabbed two small rectangles of the grilled chicken. 

The next station had eggs Benedict, French toast and condiments for it. I passed. 

Next station was prime rib and ham! Yes now we're talking. I was 3rd on line and though the first person had a slice of ham covered in gravy there was a debate as to which gravy the server in Chefs clothing had slathered atop it. He did not speak English and her questions were received with pointing and grunts. She returned the plate started again and pointed to the gravy she preferred. The second gentleman picked ham no topping and finally it was my turn. Prime rib rare please! The good news is it registered in the little English he knew, the bad is he carved me off a paper thin slice. I'm not going to keep the 3 people behind me waiting any longer so I moved to the mashed potatoes and corn, which were the height of my meal at Cravings. So good I grabbed seconds. I was able to enjoy my prime rib in one single bite. Like a slice of roast beef at the deli counter. 

Even though I would've liked more meat the carving board was 5 deep so I slithered in and grabbed a spoonful of potatoes and corn and made it to the next station of mexican dishes. Rice, chips, salsa guacamole and fried potato wedges? Pass

They had soup at the next station and I grabbed some New England Clam Chowder. It was very good. As many clams as potatoes. The next and last before the deserts was oriental that had rice, sushi, wontons and pot stickers. I had everything but the rice and enjoyed all of it. 

For $26 in Vegas it's worth it and I'm certain that as Mirage offers great comps that I'll be back. Just don't expect service at the carving station.",M6507pyL7AKEFaN6238ixw,2,0,3,vW2GQt9uV1zcgwEcuv5wow

The pizza is horrible, just horrible.  The only good thing I found was the Eggs Benedict.  You can pay and extra $5 for open bar, but watch out for the mimosas... they're awful. 

You can experience all this awfulness for the low low price of $35 per person.

Well, almost.

We stayed at the Mirage, and received two vouchers for the buffet.  At about roughly $25 per head, we were happy to get in for free.

We came in on a Sunday around 4, and the place was pretty empty.  Drinks were brought quickly and consistently to our table.

The overall look of the buffet is very modern, very clean.  Stations were spaced out and organized neatly.  There were large options, from seafood, to chinese, to italian, etc., etc.  

The food was good!  The seaweed salad was insanely delicious.  I had some veggie sushi, some shrimp, baked salmon...  Finished my meal off with bread pudding and a coconut macaroon.  My husband had and enjoyed the prime rib.

1638132,2014-01-24,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Two important contexts to this review.
First, this is only for the Cravings breakfast, and the Cravings brunch (had both).  I make no claims to the dinner service.
Second, my evaluation is done from a perspective that I am evaluating a buffet.  I don't compare and rate a buffet with fine dining restaurants.

The Mirage breakfast buffet was acceptable, but it would not have been at full price (we were comp'd both times).  The food is typical buffet quality.  Not outstanding and not original.  The options during the breakfast are surprisingly limited.  This is even true at the omelet station where there are a limited number of ingredients.  I walked away full, but felt those who paid full price would have been disappointed.

The brunch has many more options and comes with alcohol, however the price is significantly higher (again, I didn't pay it).

I'd have a hard time justifying the $20 price for the regular breakfast.  If one has transportation, Sunset Station would offer a better buffet at less than half the price.

If you're on the strip and going to pay full price, I think you'd do much better at Cosmo (Wicked Spoon) or Aria.

The one place I felt the buffet might have had a slight edge was in the desserts.  Some very good options there.

If you're comp'd, it's a fine.  If you've got a two-for-one and you're already there, it's okay.  If you're paying full price, go elsewhere.",uyqE8kvAq2LxPnm385T6NA,3,0,3,_ynSyWsYiVYKRzild5Ku9g
1642763,2015-03-16,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Went to the lunch buffet at this place and was surprised to see that the price of the buffet at lunch on the weekend is the same price as a dinner buffet at the Bellagio on a weeknight. It did come with bottomless poor quality momosas, bitter IPS beer, or bottom shelf wine. If it's crap, is it worth anything being bottomless?

The quality of the foods were more miss than hits. I couldn't eat any more because of the food and not because I was too full.

The layout was difficult since it was all on an outside ring with a tight seated middle area. I ran into many people while just trying to get some food. They only let people get food on one side of the carts instead of two sides which also added to the difficulties of the food getting logistics.

The service seemed to be having a bad day and gave off a rude anger so we really didn't want to bother her at all and said polite thank you's to her anytime she did anything. It wasn't a great experience.",CrTY-pr1BeFaxys2M7Y-tg,3,0,2,qKtbOKzG6nvRMoxL5m5_rA

Price is excellent especially using the Tix4Tonight coupon. The line wasn't very long and we were able to get seated very quick. The biggest disappointment for me is we sat near the entrance of the buffet and were exposed to the casino smoke. My scent of the food was overridden by cigarette smell. I think if I was closer into the restaurant I would've enjoyed it much more. The asian area was very limited, with only 4-5 items in the Japanese section and 4-5 items in the Chinese section. The prime rib was great and went well with the steamed crab legs. Desserts were average at best. A pie I tried tasted very stale. Nice selection of soft drinks at the soda machine; close-by were cappuccino machines and a bar that served 2 selections of draft beer and wine.

1. don't come during the weekends - yes, they serve bottomless mimosas, but if you're a weak drinker like me, you'll most probably better off with other buffets. 
2. don't listen to MLife desk - they have no clue on discounts available at the buffets - you can use AAA card for 20% discount on total bill
3. weekday buffet is better, yet if you insist on coming weekends, go to Rodizio  instead (heard great things about them and plan on going there next time)
4. I would rank Cravings after: Caesar's Palace Buffet, Planet Hollywood, Le Village, the Spice Market, and a slew of others - Cravings just was upsetting. 

The service was pretty good, but overall - one just has a higher expectation for the food availability and Cravings was not able to fulfill 1/10th of the expectations - but still, I give them credit for the dessert bar and prime roast.",m5heP-HiotiMxmbdI0CmDg,3,1,2,v7JMs2f12Y0WGfLg_6LiSA

But there is no way I can tell anyone go to this counter for this or that because it's all over the place, i.e. What would cereal be doing at the salad station? Gravy was rushed so it's gritty from the flour. Now the big problem is we paid extra for the alcoholic drinks(it was only six bucks but that's beside the point). One bartender tries to tell me my Bloody Mary already has vodka in the premix sorry but that is bull you just gave me tomato juice. The other bartender was great one of the first things he does is pour the vodka in. So let's just say I wouldn't recommend this buffet nor would I ever come back.

Regardless, if you're supplying Vegas tourists with a buffet, it should always be good, no matter what the time. 

Honestly, I only went here because we were already at the Mirage and I wanted a salad bar salad. I was NOT dissapointed with the salad bar, but I was with the fact that some lady tosses it together for you. She put a paltry amount of lettuce in the bowl but topped it with waaaay too many toppings and too much dressing. I had to ask her to add more lettuce. Good thing I did because even with the extra lettuce there was still too much everything else. Sheesh. 

The eggplant parmesan and the pesto pasta were surprisingly good. As good as I have made at home. The cab legs were scary and gross. I put it on my mans plate when he wasn't looking. 

The rest of the buffet left something to be desired. Too bad. For nearly $40 for the both of us I was hoping for more. Would I eat here again? Maybe, but I'd only go around the busy times to guarantee a fresher selection of food.

1846888,2012-12-24,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"I am very impressed about this buffet.

I first like it how it's in Mirage. I have always wanted to eat at this hotel but I was not so sure about their restaurants. However, coming to Cravings made me have no regrets about buffets. 

First off, the interior is extremely nice. You are greeted to a wide space where there are two cashiers, one in front of the other, and there you will pay for your meal. The hosts are nice as well. I like how there are more than one hostess in this buffet because they are able to organize where to sit the customers, so it won't be such a big mess when there are many parties waiting for their seat. 

The inside of the buffet is wonderful. It has a clean, functional, modern look to it and there are signs of what stations they provide. They provide typical sections such as Chinese, Italian, BBQ, and more. What was really interesting was their salad bar. Someone actually prepares the salad for you the way that you want! I thought that was nice. 

The food is pretty okay. The crab legs are a bit salty but it's enough to satisfy those seafood lovers. Their jumbo shrimp really gets the brownie points here. They're big and they're not pilled up, like how they do it at other buffets. They put out enough shrimp for you to get enough on your plate. Plus, they offer other ways of eating shrimp. Their food was not dry and I appreciate that a lot. They make sure their foods are fresh and ready to serve. Even their pizza wasn't as hard as cardboard. It tasted fresh! Their prime rib was excellent and even their Chinese food was easy to manage for someone, like me, who can't stand Chinese food as much as they want to. They have a variety of options in each section so you'll  be able to get enough food for the price you pay. One thing that bothered me as a Korean was that they put Kimchi in the Chinese section. Kimchi is an authentic Korean side dish, not Chinese. I hope they make this correction fast. 

Their plating is absolutely AMAZING! I love how they care about every aspect of the buffet from the interior of the restaurant to the plates and silverware they use. The pictures the other Yelpers provide definitely give you a great idea of how the restaurant is and what to expect. It shows that they value their customers and want everyone to feel that they are eating the best of the best in Las Vegas. 

Overall, I am a huge fan of this place. I have been to many buffets in Las Vegas and I cannot be any happier about choosing this buffet. You can come here before seeing a show or with your friends before a long night of partying with your friends at the hottest club in Vegas. If there are children part of the party,  come by for their desserts. There are a wide variety of choices from ice cream to cookies and cakes everyone can enjoy. For the parents, a nice sip of coffee will do just right after a delicious meal from many cultures. This is one good stop to go to and there won't be any regrets choosing a buffet instead of a restaurant. There is a reason why this buffet is called ""Cravings"": everything that you are craving for, you can get it here! :)

1860441,2014-06-20,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"I'm surprised that majority of the ratings are 4 stars. My guesses are depending on your palate of what you like to eat rather than quality etc. Next is depending on the day you go they may serve better things, lets say the weekend. I came here on a weekday for dinner and i didn't each much because nothing seems good to me. I go to Vegas quite often and pretty much tried 90% of all the buffets in Vegas. Not embarrassed to say, people don't call me a buffet queen for nothing you know. So I am comparing them to each other. Here is a few things in a nutshell:

The Chimichurri sauce was extremely spicy without warning. Although I guess its my fault for not catching all the chilli flakes that were in there but it would have been a nice courtesy to put that on a menu card. (minus-1/2 star) The biscuits were hard and cold as if it may injure someone if I threw it across the room. I even questioned if it was suppose to be for display only and I grabbed it by accident since they were cold. (minus-1/2 star) The presentations of the food were ok not great. For a place that big, I would have thought there were a lot of varieties but there wasn't. The seafood are not as fresh as many other buffets I have had in Vegas. The desserts were good but again not great. They had macarons which I love but they were thrown all over the place on a dish. Some fell off to the table and some were pretty broken up pieces that shouldn't be placed there anymore. (minus 1-star)

In a way, I kind of like how we can grab our own drinks at the beverage bar yet I also see it as part of a service. So you can be the judge of what floats your boat. The service was great though as the server looked at my receipt while I was getting my food first and when I returned he greeted us my our last names. Very professional. They were friendly and grabs my old plates away pretty quickly. There were ice cream but the person that scoops it was not there. I stood there for almost 5 minutes before she came out from the kitchen. First time this ever happened in Vegas. Don't they have coverage should she need to walk away for a minute?

Cost: for about $30/dinner, I have had much better and more variety of selections.  I understand maybe its because the beer and wine are unlimited but think the customer should have a choice to opt out and not pay for that portion if they don't want to drink any alcohol there. (minus-1 star)

So overall, this place is descent but seriously for the price you pay, I wouldn't eat there again as I had much better elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. See my other reviews for more reviews on other buffets.",qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,0,0,2,EALkF1QAOueqmS-ig-l7vg

First, I am active duty military and my dad is retired military.  When we went to pay before entering, we found out its about 50% off for military.  That took the ~$75 bill per person and made it much more favorable.
Second, it was unlimited wine and beer, they had Draft Beer (some type of micro-brew I don't really drink beer) and Moscato (sweet white wine that my wife and mom love) - so it was pretty awesome.  
Third, the food was amazing diverse.  Usually the seafood is old stale crab legs or some small amount of good stuff... This place had tons of fresh shrimp, crab legs, oysters, and a seafood soup that was pretty bomb.  They had both well done and medium rare prime rib, turkey, and the normal sides for a carving station.  Chinese section with your normal selections with all fresh vegetabls which was pretty amazing.  An Italian section, with a create your own pasta bar thing - which was pretty entertaining.  They also had a Japanese/Sushi area which although not the best, worked out.
The deserts were plentiful and they had crème Brule (however you spell it) which both my wife and mother love.

Price is expensive $30/adult and $23/kid but it failed our expectation for the price we paid. The king crab legs were supper dooper salty, I meant very very very salty (they intended so you can't eat)! These crab legs also had the smell of spoil food and the crab meat ( you could see since they precut in half) turned yellowish/ brownish color. I think that why they dumped in more salt in to reserve the food or to masked the taste of bad food. Their meat dumplings (dim sum) filled with undercooked meat clearly visible supper red meat inside and smell bad. I urged to throw up after a bite of it right at the table.

The place is pretty much square shaped and there's food choices surrounding each side the cube.  The place is really bright and there's plenty of seating.

I never feel like it's actually worth 25-30 bucks to eat at a buffet as the quality of the food isn't as high as some restaurants, but at the the same time the quantities are insane and unlimited.  Most of the time I find myself eating a plate or sometimes two and maybe a bit of dessert. 

I don't eat as much as some people because it's kind of disgusting.  People eating the way they do sometimes at buffets is enough to lose your appetite, so it might be a good idea to not look around so much.

1978436,2015-08-08,2,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"There were four of us dining at Cravings Buffet at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. After reading the Yelp reviews with a ""Yelp sort"", we knew we could not go wrong at Cravings.  Yelp sort is interesting.  You always seem to find higher rated reviews on top, which is the first thing a viewer sees, so when a reviewer writes that Cravings Buffet is one of the best on the strip, you can't help but put faith in the review.  Wrong thing to do.  Sort by the most recent reviews and read everything for the past few weeks. 

We arrived at Cravings Buffet and were greeted with smiles from the cashier to the hostess to employees on the floor.  Eleven food stations were filled with fresh, perfectly seasoned and delicious foods to tantalize even the most sophisticated palate. From Asian to Italian, each station duplicated authentic ethnic cooking.

The second paragraph written above is more of a fantasy and not reality.  Our experience was the exact opposite.  I have given Cravings a one-star because that is the lowest Yelp allows.  Had there been an opportunity to give a negative 1,2,3, etc, it would have been rated the absolute lowest and for good reason.  

The old saying, ""you get what you pay for"" does not apply when dining at Cravings Buffet in the beautiful Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas.  The buffet is one of the more expensive on the Las Vegas Strip, so anyone reading the Yelp reviews and other expect at least good food, if not exceptional.

We arrived at Cravings just a few minutes after 3 PM when the dinner menu began.  Prices increase considerably if you arrive at 3 PM instead of 2:58 PM or 2:59 PM.  That is the difference between their Friday brunch and Friday dinner.

First impressions are lasting ones and the cashier was not too friendly, though not nearly as rude as the seating hostess. Okay, so you only deal with those two for a few minutes before moving onto more disappointment. My husband went straight to the seafood station, while I headed for the Asian cuisine.  His crab legs and mussels were terribly overcooked and had no seasoning.  He drank one of their cheap beers from the bar before trying the crappy red and white wines.  Veronica was working the floor when she came to the table to ask if everything was okay.  My husband told her the crab legs were rubbery and she said that is the way crab is prepared at Cravings.  I grabbed some rice, chow mein, Asian dumplings, sushi, and a few other things to sample.  Of course nothing tasted good.  Everything was mushy and bland.  Sad, sad, sad.

A few tips to Cravings Buffet management at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas:

1) Train or retrain your staff in customer service.  When employees are rude to customers, they will likely not return.

2) You have a serious issue with food quality.  If your chefs are preparing the food according to the recipes, then change the recipes and purchase better quality ingredients.  If not, hire chefs with formal training.  That applies to your pastry chefs as well.  Your desserts are not worth eating.

3) Train your serving staff, especially at the carving section.  First they should be knowledgeable about the products they are attempting to carve.  The carver should know the type of cut and the difference in temperatures.  When a customer requests medium rare, and the options are medium rare or well-done, it should be served as ordered.  If your  procedures are to have both temperatures available and they are not prepared properly, then your chefs should have caught the error and corrected.  Second, when someone asks to have meat cut thin, that does not mean 3/4"" or more.  Their carving knives appeared to be capable of carving properly.

4) Even when customers have a horrible experience, a good floor manager can make things better if they tried.  Again, that wasn't the case with us.  One of the other diners in our group requested the manager come to the table.  An older frumpy woman came, along with an assistant chef to hear some of the issues.  She explained to both that the food was grossly over-cooked and was terribly bland.  Salt and pepper is cheap, so why not use to help make your food taste better.  It was one of her birthday meals and she ended up spitting out 
everything she put into her mouth.  She told the manager it was some of the most disgusting food ever attempted to eat and was truly disappointed with the experience.  

While three of the four at the table expressed to your personnel that the food was crappy, the only thing done was the manager refunded money for one person.  A good manager at a reputable restaurant would have refunded the entire amount, apologized for our unfortunate experience at Cravings Buffet, then ask us to return one day after they improve on their shortcomings and nothing less.

As with our visit to the Pantry, my mom and I visited the Cravings Buffet for dinner purely out of convenience (there was a line at the Pantry).  The Cravings Buffet is located at the Mirage Resort on the casino level near Portofino and Stack.

1.  Yes, they serve dinner!  Till 900pm.  Adult dinner pricing is $28.99.

2.  Yes, unlimited wine and beer (limited selection) are included in the dinner price.  Cheers everyone!

3.  Yes, you must now get your own drinks (we discovered that this must be a new process when we visited the Bellagio buffet the following day for lunch and found the exact same drink dispensers).  Customers may help themselves to soda, juice, and water from the multiple dispensing machines available (cups are on the side).  Visit your friendly bartender for the adult beverages at the bar in the rear.  

4.  Yes, the server was friendly and nice.  She brought over extra napkins, and hand wipes for our use during dinner.  She also offered to bring any other sauces or condiments as needed.

5.  Yes, like any good Vegas buffet, there are various food stations and cuisine.  At Cravings Bufffet, these include Italian, Fish/Seafood, Latin, American, Asian/Sushi, Salad, and Dessert, of course.  I think my favorite was the Italian station....I liked the pizza and pasta.  The most disappointing station (for me and my mom) was the desserts.  We just didn't find anything to our liking really (i.e. no cheesecake).

6.  Yes, seating is plentiful.  Like any Vegas buffet, there is a sea of tables and chairs available.  Thankfully, on the night we dined it wasn't overly crowded.

7.  Yes, its a buffet...eat till you're content, or until you don't have any room left in your stomach.

It was a satisfactory visit at the Cravings Buffet.  I liked that the wine and beer was included with the dinner pricing.",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,15,9,3,1zwaTmQhTU3Cbct2-g8o9w

Well apparently this lady thought she was on the fast track to upper management the more people she ""caught"" eating that didn't pay. So with my personal experience, my 3 year old daughter already had previously ate before we got there plus even if she was fully hungry she wouldn't have ate more than a few bites.

So i watched her find 3 other tables with ADULTS who didnt pay for one person.  And there she was... to make a huge scene where other diners are staring. So embarrassing.

""chinese"", ""sushi"", ""mexican"", ""desserts"", ""salad"", etc) so you can go for exactly what you want. 

Some food highlights:

1. The prime rib was surprisingly really good! Red, soft, and juicy. My friend asked if they had cranberry sauce, and they went to the back and brought a huge bowl out for us. So nice of them!

2. They have fried plantains!! Yessss!

3. Crab legs were cracked open in half already like at Bellagio buffet so it's easier to eat but I didn't like the way they tasted. It was pretty much frozen cold and was too salty/fishy for my taste. 

4. The eggs benedict looks really nice, but it was a little too bland in my opinion. 

5. They have sriracha sauce if you need that with your chinese food like I do!

6. They have a gelato bar hidden in the corner next to the desserts! Note: it's NOT self serve. So don't try to go back there by yourself and scoop your own.  Just wait patiently and someone will come to help you. ;)",53-0CIUo-pd5ysfvHXb2yQ,11,9,4,lZ2TVNpkEBXErm0_pD-ChA

Pros: set up is good. Staff is friendly. Plates were cleared quickly. Server even went to find my mom a cracker for her crab. Good options. Dessert was yummy. Lots of tiny portions so you can try a lot. The peach/mango trifle thing is the bees knees. Prime rib was juicy and cooked right. Not fall apart texture, which for a roast it should be, but close. Wine and beer included in fee.

Cons: bathrooms. None! They are outside in the casino. Kid almost peed her pants before we got there. Mind you, the walk is short for an adult. Potatoes had ZERO flavor. That's hard to do. Even just a little salt is ok. Mac n cheese was old and cold. Potatoes wedges were burnt. Steamed rice was old and crunchy. I waited for 10 minutes for someone at the Asian station to replace it, but it was like a ghost town. 

All in all, it's not awful food. But $40 per person is loony toons for what you get. If you aren't eating steak, lobster, or crab, save your pennies.",GhhvJFD76bFpU1zWR5MsPA,0,0,3,dax-A1ytp33Zs6eA4dGUkg

I took off two stars because I felt that they tried hard in some areas and just didn't think about the others.  The Asian noodle spot was pretty awesome.  They had Vietnamese beef pho they made right in front of you and it wasn't bad (I'm viet and had my share of good/bad pho).  It made me feel all warm and fuzzy.  They also made wonton soup!  At the same spot, they had different kinds of dimsum.  Shrimp balls (awesome) and shumai (not so awesome).  Next to the noodle bar was chicken congee (asian rice soup).  I thought they executed the Asian food quite well!  

On to the other areas.  The seafood spot was okay.  The crab legs were extremely salty for some reason :(   so I didn't eat many of them.  The dessert spot was WEAK.  There wasn't much compared to the Bellagio buffet which has a bajillion pastries.  It was like I was staring at a meager dessert spread at a chinese buffet.  The italian spot only had pizza and the sushi area was okay.  

I believe the key to having a good buffet is people standing there making delicious foods as you walk by like a sushi guru handing you a freshly made spicy tuny roll or a baker stuffing cannolis.  The Mirage buffet lacked such presence (minus the noodle bar).

Been to several of the buffets on the vegas strip over the years, got to say the way to get a 5 stars is in my book has to be with the easy items, if you visit any of the buffets here in vegas here is a quick tip for the breakfast or lunch buffets if they can't make scrabbled eggs or mashed potatoes right everything else is going to be less then stellar.

just a tip I picked up from others who frequent the buffets in vegas, for early dinners or late lunches you look for prime rib, if it is dry with no taste your probably at one of the buffets that just throws everything out there with no real prep

here at cravings they did pretty good with there eggs and there mashed potatoes their prime rib was lacking but they made up for it with the choice of shu mai, fresh made not sticky, still dripping due to the steam 

they got alot of choices Italian, Chinese, American, Fishmonger (haha), sushi, several other choices, they also got a bar on this line of options, alcohol you have to pay extra for but im sure you all know that.

there breakfast choices: eggs benedict decent, bacon standard, links standard looked dried up, waffles were perfect crisp outer shell soft chewy inside, french toast not so great, eggs better the most other buffets

for this buffet spot I would go back for brunch price is decent for brunch!

food *** ribs no happy! Eggs, fried rice, shu mai, waffles are crisp outside soft inside
price $$ it is about $28 per person folks

The were HUGE and stayed refilled. They were always warm and fresh and delicious. So so good.  So we decided to go for breakfast the next day. Seriously great spread. The breakfast burritos and chilaquiles were outstanding. I couldn't get enough of the French toast and warmed syrup with the strawberries. The pastry table had a huge selection.

Crab legs were super watery, salty and small, prime rib and corned beef wasn't great(not best cuts of meat), sushi was bland. It's good place if you want relatively cheap meal and if you can't decide what you feel like. Server was good always keep our table clean, unlimited house wine and beer (goose island ipa and bud light) which was nice cause usually one beer is $6-8 per glass anywhere. It's worth it if you like wine and Bert and don't care of brand. Desserts were good and I had quiet bit of them(they also have massive selection of sugar free stuff). Almost all food was under salted but I understand that not everyone likes salty food but salt and pepper available at the tables. Lines were long bit if you have pearl or above mlife card then you skip lines (we did yay). We also used 2 for 1 voucher from myvegas app. No problems with redeeming rewards. Just make sure you head to mlife desk so they can load it to your card. Overall if you have comps or vouchers or coupons it's definitely worth it. For under $30 for 2 people?

Of course there were some things that weren't as good as others - like the Mac N Cheese: my husband and I both thought it looked way better than it was. It just was too watered down and didn't taste like much of anything even though it looked very cheesy and yum.

Everything else was pretty fantastic that we tried-- prime rib was AMAZING. First cut we had was medium, and it was good but not what we were craving. Then they brought out a more rare cut and it was SO good. You know it's good prime rib though when even the more cooked pieces are still flavorful and easy to chew. 

The sushi was yummy as were the soups- the wonton soup was probably our favorite but the scallop chowder was great. The pizza was pretty good as well and the crab legs and shrimp were on point.

The dessert was fantastic!!! Almost didn't have room for it. The chocolate gelato was yummy as well as the creme brûlée-- I mean really all of the dessert we had as absolutely delicious.

Paid $2 each person for the coupon and went straight to Cravings around 7:45p-8pm (Saturday night).  Surprisingly, there was NO LINE! We were quickly seated by the friendly staff.  We paid $25 ea at the restaurant ($27 ea after the coupon).  

This buffet had the normal range of choices including salad, soups, sushi, pizza, carving station, snow crab legs (hot and cold), etc.  They also had the Coke Freestyle machines so you can choose what soda combination you want.  Also included in the price was unlimited beer and wine (beer selection was limited to Bud Light or Blue Moon and their own wine selection).  

To start off, I got some sushi, but was a little disappointed with the lack of selection.  There was not the usual assortment of nigiri and only had what I believe was yellowtail.  No salmon or tuna.  Taste was alright, not the greatest, but not the worse.  

My first cut of prime rib was well done and did not taste that great at all, but I ended up eating it anyway.  Gave it another shot when one of my buddies got a cut that had some red to it.  That piece was a lot better!  He gave me the smallest sliver, which I took because I was getting full, but the person behind me asked for a thick piece and was given one.  

I went back for 2-3 plates of snow crab legs, as I always do, which was good, but not at the level of Bacchanal.  The legs were smaller and didn't have as much meat in them as some strip buffets, but tasted fine.  

They had a pretty good selection of dessert ranging from cakes to ice cream/frozen yogurt which was pretty good!  Only got the froyo and got some toppings as well.

Overall, it was a decent experience.  Not the best, but definitely not the worse.  We will likely be back to give it another shot.  The price with the coupon helped make it a little more worth it!

I'm don't think it's worth $37.00/person (weekend dinner), but I used the MyVegas ""2 for 1"" discount  so it was slightly under $20.00/person. 

It includes ""all you drink"" beer  and wine (something new) so if you like to drink, it could be a deal for you, but when drinks are comped everywhere [in Vegas] it doesn't seem to be a big deal to me.

As already mentioned in other reviews, you have to go to the ""bar"" or ""drink station"" for all drinks and refills. So why would anyone leave a tip for the wait staff when you need to get your own drinks?

Wir waren in der Nebensaison beim Cravings Buffet im Mirage essen und es ist bei weitem das beste Angebot was wir finden konnten.

Man sollte aber nicht direkt beim Restaurant zahlen, sondern sich vorher einen Discount Voucher bei einem Partner holen (z.B. tix4tonight), sonst ist es wesentlich teurer.

The staff were very helpful, my mother-in-law was riding a power scooter during our visit and our hostess parked it out of the way for us, and told us that she would bring it right back to the table when we were done.  I ended up doing that myself, but it was nice to have the option.

There is free beer and wine - but not being a big drinker myself I stuck to the unlimited soda, which is served from those great ""select your own mix"" machines that I've seen in many places now.

Little did i know that this Cravings buffet was just awful. 

It was about 30 dollars per person, im not going to bitch about the price because everything in vegas is going to be expensive. I understand that majority of the buffets are about this price, so whatever right?

I especially enjoyed the won ton noodle soup and a few of their other offerings which I cannot remember anymore. I ate a lot of food that weekend, so most of it is a blur.

Dessert, I enjoyed the bread pudding. It was yummm.

2462444,2014-07-08,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"i was excited to try Cravings at the MIrage, as this was my first time going to this buffet.  I love the Mirage, overall as a resort.

We went for the brunch buffet on a Saturday  at about 12noon.  It was $35.99 per person including unlimited wine, beer, and mimosas.  

We were redeeming a Buy 1, Get 1 Free promotion through the My Vegas Mobile App Slot Promotion.  The redemption process was easy with just 1 single stop at the players club before going to the restaurant.

Once we arrived, we waited in line less than 5 minutes and were seated quickly and that process was very efficient.

We also noticed that the layout of this buffet was great, allowing for people to flow through the stations quickly.  It never really seemed crowded because of this.  

All non-alcoholic beverages were self-serve.  Wine and Beer were obtained at the bar.  Champagne was obtained by the server.

As far as the food, I was only slightly impressed.  The desserts were pretty good; however, we both agreed that per our tastes, only about half of the dishes exceeded our expectations, and the others could have been greatly improved upon.  After eating at the Palms Bistro Buffet the evening before, we thought the tastes of many entrees here lacked in comparison.  We also felt it lacked in comparison to others we have been to in the past.  

This is not to say that we did not like it; however, if we would not have been redeeming the Buy 1, Get 1, we might have even given it a 2.  

In the world of Vegas Buffets, they are also changing things up.  Maybe I will try it again in the future, after trying several more.",GkoESM9G3qJC3PTLgCif8A,4,0,3,oclZG8gYGy47SrusiRtNrQ

So the line wasn't too bad when we got here at around 6 PM. I must say though I was impressed with how it took about 20 minutes to seat us when there were clearly open tables. Maybe to ensure we'd start off towards the food at a comfortable get-the-hell-out-of-my-way pace? If so, mission accomplished Cravings Buffet.

They had an Italian station, 2 Asian stations, a carving station, a Mexican food station, a salad station, and a desert section where there's a hidden gelato station at the far right corner past the desert bar; it's not self serve though so be prepared to bug someone to get you delicious strawberry gelato.

I got 3 plates of food and finished about half of each because I was so overwhelmed. I got the prime rib which was delicious for being carved from a buffet station. It was medium rare and lovely and pink, very flavorful. The pastas were alright (al dente but the sauces were average) and the ceviche was just ok. Not enough citrus, in my opinion. The asian stations were more flavorful and the barbecue pork buns were nice and perfectly steamed. I strongly recommend getthing the chipotle mashed potatoes though.

(Note: If you want the perfect plate, get a slice of prime rib, a side of chipotle mashed potatoes with turkey gravy, a made-to-order salad from the salad bar, and some corn bread. So. Good.)

The sushi station was measly and didn't even look good enough to try though. I've seen better looking sushi at Chinese buffets. 

Oh, but the desert station! Little pies!! I'm a weirdo for mini versions of things, like some girls. They had mini Dutch Apple Pie, mini raspberry pie (filling had souffle consistency) mini pecan pie, and a mini peanut butter pie. They were all scrumptious and adorable! The passion fruit infused cake with orange and strawberry slices on top was both aesthetically pleasing and subtly sweet. The strawberry gelato was very, very bold flavored and the cookies and cream flavor was a miss. The chocolate one was probably the best.

The service was not that great. It shouldn't be a big deal for a buffet if the waiters are good or not but the tables were kind of small and the plates were huge so it was noticeable when we'd been unattended for half an hour and even the ice in my water is gone. Because I ate my ice cubes as a form of hydration. Bad bad baaaaaaad.

The setting was pretty nice, contemporary American theme going and the stations had their respective titles above them to keep from having lines and long wait times to get food.

2548894,2018-05-13,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"I visited Cravings Buffet for lunch yesterday. Save your money, don't go!! There are so many other buffets out there. I came here because I thought it would have a good variety but it didn't deliver. I haven't been to a Las Vegas buffet in a couple of years so I was looking forward to pigging out. I was extremely disappointed with the food selection and quality. I would have given it no stars but that is not an option for Yelp. The sushi was probably premade and refrigerated since the rice was hard and didn't seem freshly made --just like the store-bought kind. I only sampled food that looked appealing but most of it wasn't. Looks can be deceiving, the decent looking food wasn't very good at all either. The only item that I enjoyed was the prime rib. I had two servings since there wasn't really anything else that was any good. I could have saved money if I just went to a restaurant where I just ordered prime rib. There were fish and chips and the batter was thick without much crunch. The fries were ok but like the other food just didn't seem freshly made. 

I have a sweet tooth so I saved my stomach for dessert since there wasn't really much else to eat but the dessert left me unsatisfied as well. Cookies were overbaked; they were hard and dried out. Oatmeal and chocolate cookies are supposed to be soft and chewy but not theirs. Just wasted calories eating their desserts. The cake was dry and stale. The fruit tart didn't have much flavor and wasn't crisp. I guess it was day old dessert or something. The dessert items were so bad that I never even finished any of them. The desserts look good but they are not even worth trying.

I think the only thing going for the buffet is the free beer, wine, champagne, and mimosas when I was there. Maybe that might be the reason some people rate the buffet higher than it deserves. I didn't partake in the alcoholic beverages because I was driving home that afternoon but I would prefer good food over free alcohol.

Stay away from Cravings Buffet at the MIrage or you will regret it. It was Mother's day weekend so I ended paying a premium for that crap they called food. I really don't know how such a major hotel casino can serve food like that.",HQ4A-7gW9ZcxbcTso7Jq7w,0,0,1,oKchtGDF2EIqbP8_B8LLVg

- we dedicated the ""only meal of the day"" for a buffet lunch
- the first buffet we went to (which was located in another hotel, I forget which and its name) turned us down because we had several guys in our group who didn't have sleeved shirts on upon entrance

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE/INSIDE):
- hard to miss an open space that has nothing but food
- looks somewhat like a food court

THE WAY IT WORKS:
- go in from the entrance, where the cash registers are
- pay for your meal and indicate how many are in your party
- you are then assigned seating according to how big your party is
- unlimited beer and wine go along with your buffet meal

WHAT THEY HAVE:
- desserts
- cold items (i.e. meats and cheeses like when you drink wine; salad area)
- Asian
- Latino
- American
- Carving
- Italian
- bar
- Seafood

WHAT WE HAD:
- a little bit of everything
- the Latino portion was just sad and not authentic at all
- the Asian portion was fairly decent
- the cold items portion was only good from the meats and cheeses; the salads didn't look fresh
- the desserts were just ok
- the carving and seafood stations were on point! (I wouldn't know about the seafood personally, but a lot of the people in my group kept going back to that station)
- some of the things in the Italian section were selectively better than others (i.e. pasta)

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the register people aren't pleasant
- the seating attendants are VERY welcoming

2594538,2015-08-06,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Cravings - perhaps the name best represents your hunger pangs AFTER your meal. I was very unimpressed.

So let's begin -

The pros:

Serve-yourself drink station. They have that new-fangled Coke machine (actually, it's been out for a few years) that allows you to customize your own drinks (as long as the syrup is part of the Coke family). Milk, coffee, cappuccino (don't get too excited - we're talking about the ones you find at the gas station mart).

Complimentary wine and beer. I cannot comment on this, since I did not partake.

A wide range of stations (Asian, Latin, Italian, et al).

The cons:

Remember that cappuccino machine? I tried a Vanilla Cappuccino, and it tasted watery. Evidently someone forget to check the powder level for the mix.

The food is seriously sub-par. Prime rib was cooked medium rare, but was inexplicably tough. The Asian foods were scary ick - sushi was sub-sub par (according to my wife), the shu mai (a type of dim sum) was mushy and tasteless. My wife said that the mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste - too bad we didn't have reams of newspaper, I could have started a paper-mache project.

The dessert section deserves its own paragraph of ill repute. There is a machine that says ""gelato"" - unfortunately, it spews something more like ice milk (""something that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike gelato""). There was Boston Creme Pie, which somehow lacked the Creme portion (I guess you cannot call it ""Boston Pie""?), a concoction called ""Equator"" that left a weird brown smear that resembled the slime left by an apoplectic snail after binging on bad cabbage. And worse - no cheesecake. I mean seriously - have you ever been to a casino buffet that did not offer cheesecake? That's like going to a diner south of the Mason-Dixon Line that didn't offer grits....

The one saving grace is that our dinner had been comped. But even then we somehow felt short-changed.

Pro Tips:

Go for dishes that cannot be ruined. Pasta, white rice - this trip probably wouldn't be the best time to start that gluten-free diet.

Join M-Life (the loyalty program at the casino). I know I sound like a shill, but if you're going to play the tables and machines, you might as well earn points.

Play MyVegas. We earned the comps via the game. It's free - and you can get free stuff. You too can be Mike and Trent (let's see who caught that reference).",-OlPToA_8cwsmb2coPg5EA,1,1,2,8cINt1j6lSqOkkLdOThkjw
2594756,2007-01-17,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"For a Buffet...this place was awesome!

Actually...this place doesn't need the ""For a Buffet"" disclaimer.

It has excellent food, of superior quality to many more expensive Vegas establishments ( HELLO...EMERIL...ARE YOU LISTENING? )...and the value can't be beat.

I don't normally attempt to actually EAT all that I CAN...but this place made me want to just keep going back for more.

We did the brunch menu...and it was LOADED.  Standard American breakfast fare...build yer own Omelette bar...delicious raw-bar...Latin and Asian inspired brunch items...plus dessert at 11am was a real treat.

Oh, did I mention the all-you-can-drink champagne / mimosas to go with it?

Yeah...there's that too.  

If you're busy on the floor of the Mirage Casino, and you get the munchies, this really is the place to get your fix.

And if you plan it just right...you can kill about 2 1/2 hours like we did just drinking your weight in champagne.

In fact, it was probably my favorite decor of any restaurant I visited. It was something of a contemporary-60s-Frank-Lloyd-Wright sort of place. I really like it.
 
When it came to the food, that is what disappointed me. What appeared to be a very large buffet, was not as large as I suspected. There are very large tables spread around the perimeter. The food actually takes up a much smaller portion of the table. The tables looked nice... all about the presentation. Also, the food, representing different countries, was very authentic. This should score high-marks with many folks. I guess I like my exotic foods to me a little more Americanized. Don't get me wrong... it wasn't bad... it just wasn't my cup of tea. I would have liked it better if the food was a tad less exotic and there were more choices.
 
The dessert selection was a little stale and limited. Perhaps it was a result of bad timing. It's a gamble sometimes with a buffet.
 
I kept comparing it to a casino buffet in my hometown has has four times the selection of fresh, hot food with a less expensive price tag.

- if you don't like crab or steak forget dinner for the price
- wine and beer are included even at breakfast 
- they have those cool soda machines that let you make pretty much any kind of soda
- they have sushi 
- there are lots of gluten free options and they are all marked
- salad bar is really teeny so if you are looking for salad, look somewhere else 
- omelette bar at breakfast is the best option

I come here at least once a month, and I don't mind coming here often because this is one of the few buffets that actually changes their selection. Other buffets always have the same crap day in and day out...and they don't care because tourists don't come often enough to notice the food is always the same. I like Cravings because they sometimes have congee...and their noodle soup is decent (not as good as Rio's Buffet). Their fried plantains are also great...as well as their lobster ravioli. Cut one open...you'll find large pieces of real lobster in each one! The cioppino is generally devoid of any taste or spice, but their clam chowder is always too salty. The ribs are pretty good and meaty but not fall off the bone tender. I do wish they would put some dumpling sauce for the pot stickers...the only choices are regular soy and red vinegar.  I like how they always have some different desserts...last month they installed doors to their dessert display. Although the desserts are kept cooler now, it SUCKS when both your hands are holding desserts---I guess just leave the door open for the next glutton? Their gelato is generally too soft. And it doesn't help that they put it in a very warm bowl. So by the time you get back to your seat, you have gelato soup. Most of the time, there isn't someone manning the gelato, so you have to wait. And most of the time, you have to wait a long time. I also like how they have chocolate sauce and vanilla sauce in a pitcher so you can pour it on anything and everything.

The food itself was nothing to get very excited about.  The high point was the Andouille sausage which had a kick to it and real flavor.  Ironically, the low point was the Cajun chicken, which looked the part but had little flavor and was so dry it was barely edible (and I prefer dry poultry to juicy).  The rest of the food, as many pointed out, was pretty bland, kind of like Golden Corral with less choices.  They do have free alcohol, so if you're more interested in drinking than eating, this may be the place for you.  I don't drink, so this was little consolation for me.

Another Yelper recommended getting a discount coupon.  I had one and came at about 1:00 PM for lunch.  The coupon (from Tix 4 Tonight) listed a lunch price of $11.99.  There were three of us, so I was expecting to pay about $40.  Imagine my shock when the Cashier announced my bill was about $80.  I told her I wanted lunch and she told me they weren't serving lunch ""today.""  I went ahead and paid and immediately checked their website on my phone only to discover today meant ever.  There is no reference to lunch, only Breakfast, Brunch and Dinner.  Is the Mirage or Tix 4 Tonight to blame for the bait and switch/misrepresentation?  I guess that's a question for the Nevada Attorney General to figure out, I'll update to post any response I get from them.

The fresh fruit (grapefruit, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, & pineapple) were sinfully juicy and sweet! I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the fruit selections were not canned or candied. You could tell they were recently cut straight from the fruits. 

The French toast was soft, fresh, and full of the delicate flavor of sweet spices--either cinnamon or nutmeg. This tasted elegant when topped with cottage cheese and the delicious strawberry compote at the serving station, which was made with strawberries that had a just-picked flavor and wasn't cloyingly sweet. I didn't grab more of anything else because the combination of quality French toast, cottage cheese, and strawberry compote didn't taste cheap and it felt like I was dining at some elegant breakfast spot!

2) Shrimp - be careful, they served some shrimp that were stilll frozen.. wth.. take them prongs and give them a nice tap to see if it's still frozen
3) Macaroon cookies - surprisingly decent
4) Smoked Salmon - thank goodness they can't screw this one up
5) Crab legs - mediorce, wasn't that good, wasn't that bad

We still had choices of some breakfast stuff like bacon, sausage, eggs benedict, and they were still running omelet grill to order your own way.

There was a lot of selection with a variety of Chinese, sushi, breakfast, salad, dessert, gelato, and meats.  I avoid all sushi for the most part at buffets, and for good reason, too; my friend decided to try a couple of pieces found the rice to be stale with meager portions of fish.

The Spread - the price includes a full selection of beer and wine. If you come on Sunday you can also get all you can drink champagne up to 3 p.m. this is a really fantastic offer considering the prices of everything else in town. My personal favorite is brunch.

The Food - the food here overall is really good. And the variety is amazing. There's everything from prime rib to guacamole. My personal favorite is the dessert bar. My highest recommendations to the bread pudding and the Opera Bar.

The Service - our server was a sweet and cheerful lady. She was attentive without being overbearing. I was very happy to be sitting in her section.

Overall - this is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Las Vegas. It's a great place to have brunch or a late breakfast and that'll keep you going until a late dinner.

Crab legs (steamed and cold) were small but the best part of my meal. The tuna in from their LIMITED sushi selection looked rock hard. Their salad bar didn't have fresh veggies.

We came in at about 1:30 in the afternoon and my mom and step dad ordered a bottle of Champagne. After about 15 minutes, our waiter came by to apologize for the wait, because apparently, the buffet bar was closed; so they would have to go to rEVOLution or Japonais just to get a bottle. Ten more minutes passed by with is wondering why the Cravings bar was closed, when he came back to apologize again for the delay. My mom just said to forget it because she had specifically told the waiter she wanted it with her food.  He stood near our table virtually the whole time we were eating. Normally this would be good, but he was standing there chatting with his coworkers. We barely got refills, I'm glad my coffee came with a carafe. 

In terms of food, it wasn't anything phenomenal. I came here with my fiance last year and remembered the food being better. It seems there were some cut backs at Cravings which is sad, because it used to be one of the best buffets in Vegas.

Let me start out by pointing out what factors were NOT added into the rating.  These will be talked about at the end of the review:

Beverage service
Other diners / atmosphere
Dining room seating

~~~~~~~~~~~

Buffet is not as pricey as Bellagio, Aria, but more than Circus Circus, Excalibur.  I came for breakfast, which saw a constant flow of patrons; most likely due to this time of year being Spring Break for folks in the country, and the perfect weather to visit for those outside the country.

Food had good taste to it, and is what you expect from a self-service buffet line.  Food sits out for awhile and until mostly empty.  Some buffets will remove the dish, place a new one out, and dump the remains of the first dish onto the new one to give it more of a chance to go through.  This one places new food on top of the existing food so that the bottom of the serving plate likely has food from the start of the morning.  There is a wide selection from what you would normally expect from a breakfast, but key things I noticed was an omelette station, breakfast pizzas, and Nutella pancakes.

The serving space is relatively small and too many times while waiting my turn to a dish, some people would push past me to get further down or to another station.  Some patrons combatted this push past by waking across the dining room floor to get to another station.  Serving area was not as clean as I expected but it was not filthy either.  The only obvious point is that someone does not walk the front side of the stations and wipe spills very often.  When it comes to the ground, spills are cleaned up pretty quickly.

Drinks are self-serve, as is starting to become common with a lot of Las Vegas buffets, most recently noticed at Bellagio.

I was a bit surprised of the waitresses that roam the floors.  Normally, they would come around and refill drinks.  Since Mirage's buffet has self-serve stations, this duty was eliminated.  There was no one that came by during my experience to ask how things were going.  I did notice waitresses walk around constantly, but some are preoccupied talking to other co-workers to talk to the diners.  Also, they peer over your shoulder and keep walking.  I saw this with about 5 of the waitresses walking the dining room grounds.  None of them said a word to a diner unless they needed something, like silverware or napkins.

All in all, you get what you pay for.  The quality is better than half of the Strip's buffets, but it does have their downsides.  I do intend to visit for a dinner to see how the experience may differ.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Factors to Discuss (Not part of rating)

This buffet does have what seems to be a full service bar!  Beer, wine, cocktails, hard liquor all seen.

I was put off by one person's act of reaching in and grabbing food with her hand because she didn't see the serving spoon on the holder dish 2"" away.  I did tell a staff member, who was very quick to replace it with a fresh set of food and even a new serving spoon and holder dish.  This was a nice gesture and it makes me wonder if this always is the case both here and at other locations.

A warning:  dining room floor is fairly cramped.  Tables are put closer together with other tables that make navigating the floors a bit daunting due to the close proximity to other tables and diners.  A few times I was brushed accidentally by other diners or staff.  However, I chose not to include this in the rating because as expected, the buffets want to get as many people in and out as possible, and I can understand the logic behind this.  The tables are strategically placed in a cross-diagonal pattern instead of checkerboard so you have less of a chance to bump directly into some other diner's back when scooting your chair out.",xqu43YW0vd8txTf1FBEPcg,1,0,4,uWJGjVn8ly-4qPWqtTETzg

We came here for brunch. At $18.50 (w/o alcohol), this felt like a bargain. A few days in Las Vegas and I think $20 for brunch is a steal. Phew~ I gotta get out of here fast.

Well, this buffet actually was a pretty good deal, even though the quality of food varied widely.

The crab legs and shrimps at the raw bar were fresh and tasty. In fact, this is mostly what my husband ate. Go for the seafood and get your money's worth. :)

The sushi looked terrible, so I didn't bother grabbing any. The rice looked mushed up, dry, and stale. Gross.

Hot seafood section was alright. I had a bite of the halibut, which was ok. A bit overcooked but not too bad. 

The omelet station was fun. You pick your ingredients, and a friendly cook will prepare it before your eyes. 

The breakfast section is blah. Pancakes and french toasts were tasteless. 

The salad bar was also fun. You pick whatever you want and they mix them up for you.

They also offered 2 kinds of meats (ham and prime rib) at the carving station. I believe there were also the Chinese section where they had below average dim sum and Latin section to which I didn't pay much attention.

The highlight of my meal was the crepe. The peach crepe was heavenly. I would go back just for the crepe. So soft, creamy, sweet but not overly sweet. mmmmmmmmmmmm ~~~~~~~

I am not a doughnut fan, but i was very impressed by it. It tasted very light and fresh, nothing like a gas station doughnut.

I used to come here before this place got remodeled so I expect it must be better after remodeling.  The first thing I know is I have to get my own drink which is the other end where I sit.  No server for drink like before.  Only bus boys to take your dishes.  Be prepared if you have small children and you have to serve them drinks.  The Asian food section is more than half empty.   For over one hour I kept checking on BBQ Pork Bun and Seafood bun but they did not get refill.  The chef was very busy with his wok.  Every section has only one chef so the refill is very slow.  The wonton and noodle is ready to serve in the pot.  It used to be prepared by the chef for your order so it's very fresh.  The American food section offers like five items but no fries.  BBQ ribs is hard and dry.  The corn is very good.  I got to say the only good item I like is corn that night.  Buffalo wing is ok but very spicy.  The Carving section offers very well done prime rib so I came back later for a medium slice.  The well done part is falling apart so I hear the other guests asked if it was pull pork.  Prime rib has no taste.  I cannot taste the spices from the rub at all.  Seafood section offers crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  Salad bar and cold item have a good selection.  They also have the Latino food section.  Beside pizzas there is Chef's Kitchen for Italian food but I found no menu for you to order which dishes you want.

There are vanilla yogurt, chocolate yogurt, raspberry sorbet and peach sorbet at Gelato section.   The dessert section needs to get updated on the menu and the décor.  The watermelon is cut with dice shape so they get smashed up with the serving spoon.  The watermelon should be sliced and use tongs to serve.

3056649,2014-05-13,2,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Meh. I tried this buffet after being blown away by the buffet at Bellagio, and was mildly disappointed after visiting this one. 

The staff was friendly and attentive but we had to get our own drinks. I liked that Bellagio brought them to the table. Also, the free wine that comes with the meal is awful. The Chardonnay was bitter and super dry instead of smooth and buttery, which is what I like, personally, in a Chardonnay. I opted for Sprite Zero after a sip or two. 

The assortment of food was kind of... Off. Nothing really matches. The barbecue section had not one item with BBQ sauce and no grilled items; it consisted of hot wings, cabbage and nothing else I would see at a BBQ joint down south.  The Latin section had quail, tortilla chips and potatoes.  As I walked around it was hard to decide what to build my meal out of because it was all so random. 

The good: prime rib was juicy, shumai was scrumptious. 
The bad: The broccoli stir fry in the Chinese section was bitter and greasy. Wine selection was awful. 
The ugly: The creme brûlée was liquidy and the sugar on top was not at all crispy-- it had the consistency of flan. The pizza dough wasn't cut all the way through and it was pretty gross watching people pull it apart with their hands, leaving pieces they touched behind. 

My advice- go to Bellagio instead. So much better!!",E07RAn_iRKX-J6mFcKQYrw,3,1,3,0Ui1BzW0_ggvrJTloPZLXQ

3081051,2015-03-07,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Located in the back of the Mirage, close to Samba, this is a fairly spacious buffet. They also have a to-go option: $16 for a box.

BF wanted something fairly quick and everything else in the casino would've had a long wait. Came on a Sunday (3/1/2015) around 11AM and there was no line (that should've been our first indicator about this place).

Note: Drinks are SELF-SERVE!! So if you're going to pre-tip at the cashier, I wouldn't tip very much since they hardly stop by to clear the tables or re-fill any alcoholic beverages you may have ordered.

Beer, Wine & Mimosas included during brunch.

Waffles were soggy but the french toast was pretty good (lots of cinnamon). There's a chef station that does custom omelettes but the line was too long. There's also different pizzas next to the chef station if you want pizza for brunch.

Tried the potsticker and seafood bun. The bun was really gross and mushy, but the filling was ok. Potsticker tasted like the frozen kind. Fried wonton was mostly oil and almost no filling.

The chilled shrimp and king crab legs were decent. The cioppino was probably the tastiest thing there but the bread that supposed to go with it was very stale (avoid it). Stayed away from all the sushi and sashimi since they all looked old and rubbery.

There's a carving station where the carver kind of creeped me out. He kept staring at me while he was cutting the prime rib that I ordered -_-|| The meat was fairly tender and juicy, but not much flavor.

The desserts didn't look too appealing: very dry-looking. The creme brulee tasted boxed and the panna cotta tasted like a pudding cup. I found it very weird that the ""sorbet"" is dispensed out of a soft serve machine. The toppings are around the corner of the machine.

Service is pretty much non-existent which sucks since my BF gave a good pre-tip. Lucky we were seated at a 4 person table even though we were only a pair because we just left our dirty dishes on the empty table (which got piled high). If you want a refill on your mimosas or beer, just get up and go to the counter yourself (otherwise you'll never get another drink).

If you have a voucher or a discount to come here, try it out.. But do NOT come here if you have to pay full price. Definitely not worth it at all. Our friends had a free voucher and they thought the buffet was really bad. Imagine how we felt since we paid for ours =/",xoNpQ_DnzNuTbkFPPO0Lgw,4,1,2,e_LZw0FHpT8Bb6Ub12w6Fw

Although the buffet is huge, meaning the buffet food is all the way around the dining tables, I was less than impressed at the quality of the food.

The top sirloin was dry (I like medium rare and juicy), they did not have any hot shrimp dishes only cold, plan shrimp and some shrimp cocktails, the king crab was split in half which was nice, but it was very much 'frozen food' tasting and super salty not at all fresh tasting, and they only had 1 dim sum item (pork 'meatballs' called shumai, which were just okay). Staff was friendly. Don't go at normal eating times, as the line was really long to get in.

Keep in mind, I'm not that picky of a person. I like value more than anything, so for $20 per person, I'm not complaining much, except that I think that there are better buffets in the area for a lower price. I certainly wouldn't pay the normal $40+ that it would have cost w/out the coupon. We went to FLAVORS Buffet the next day, and I was much more impressed with the quality of the food.

""Buffet, meet Jessica.""  *buffet runs away screaming*

I can safely say that this is my favorite buffet for champagne brunch in Vegas.  I have now been here three out of the last three times I have been in Vegas and plan to make it four out of four whenever my next Vegas adventure may be.  The mimosas are truly bottomless, and the service is friendly and attentive.   I love that they're open on Saturdays as well as Sundays and especially that brunch runs until 3pm (because let's face it an ""early start"" is anytime before noon in Vegas time).

The crab legs never run out.  They have a beautifully fresh and bountiful seafood section that overflows with an abundance of various shellfish, as well as a tasty selection of hot seafood dishes.   This is what stole my heart and kept me coming back.   

I love that they have a wide variety of international cuisines to choose from, with plenty of emphasis on the Asian styles (my favorites!) including sushi, dim sum, assorted pho and ramen soups, Thai, Chinese, and the like.   I tried my first (good) Ramen here, and that is the bowl that first sold me on it as a legitimate cuisine.   There is also a selection of Mexican, Italian, Indian, Mediterranean, and so many other types of food I can't even think of them all.   They also have a nice array more common american-ish foods here including a rotisserie (serving prime rib and other meats), fried everything, any side dish I can ever remember having on my parents' dinner table, a salad bar, and all breakfast-y  foods imaginable including an omelette bar and waffle station. 

And then there's dessert.  (If you have any hidden nook in your tummy that is not stuffed full at this point.)   A decadent assortment of chocolate and baked everything.  Cue sugar coma. 

Keep in mind that it *is* a buffet so you are not going to get sushi that is equal to the best sushi restaurant you've ever eaten at or prime rib as good as the Michelin joint up the street ...  but considering how (comparatively) little you are paying the selection, sheer volume, and the fun experience make up for that in my opinion.  I don't consider this my 'fine dining' experience of the weekend... it's more of the 'lets see how many mimosas and crab legs we can shove in our faces in 2 hours then walk around Vegas all drunk-and-full-like for the next few hours' way to start your day/weekend.

My experience here was not what I expected.  After being a loyal customer at the Buffet @ Bellagio, I expected greatness after being named one of the top buffets on the strip.  What I CAN say about this place is that they have the best asian food I've tasted from international buffets such as cravings.  They had wonton soup, a beef noodle soup, and spring rolls!  I've never seen these options on a strip buffet so I was impressed.  The quality was good tho not as good as authentic asian food of course.  But their asian options by far exceeded other buffets of its kind.  The dessert selection was great.  Loved the gelato and the macaroons!!  I couldn't stop myself from getting seconds and thirds.  

The prime rib was inconsistent.  Some slices were good and others were dry and unappetizing.

I still couldn't imagine giving more than 3 stars to any buffet (unless they were just out-of-this-world-effing-fantastic) so I think this place was pretty decent as far as buffets go.  

$25 was a reasonable price for offerings of crab legs, sushi, prime rib, chicken, etc galore.  I didn't try any dishes with beef or chicken, so my review is slightly biased. 

Pros:
Attentive service
Delicious grilled orange roughy, mussels and cioppino
Wide array of different dishes, including Asian, Mediterranean, American, and Italian
Salad bar with great offerings and freshly tossed just for you
GELATO!!!  OMG delicious!

Cons:
Crab legs were a bit salty so I was disappointed that I couldn't gorge on them like I wanted to
Dessert variety was wide, but not very good

I know I've complained about buffets before, but this place was pretty a-ok.  I'm sure it's not the best and certainly not the worst offered on the Vegas strip.",SDxR6E_Eo8FmoEkUSBfnRg,1,1,3,zfpgzmNX3AiQlx4LUto26Q

I was disappointed that the price is the same with or without champagne (at Bellagio, it's a few dollars less if you're not drinking, which I wasn't since I was in a class...)
But there was NO LINE!!!! I though the selection wasn't AS huge as Bellagio but the food was all good! And it's very spacious and not crowded. 
I would recommend skipping on the sushi rolls.  The salad bar looked amazing and I wish I'd discovered just how amazing it looked before I was already stuffed. The crepe station was fantastic with plain or peach crepes and plenty of sauces for them. Prime rib was excellent. Belgian waffles with maple butter and whipped cream were simple but oh so tasty. Loved the chilaquiles and chimichurri sauce, the croissant bread pudding was wonderful, the poached apples were delicious.. oh my, I'm getting hungry :)


I had to get back to my class, but my friends told me that they sat there for 3+hours drinking champagne and received excellent service.

First off the prime rib was definitely good and I do love my prime rib  ( but I didn't see anything else like turkey or ham at the carving station for all the non prime rib fans, didn't bother me as much but just saying).  Next if you truly enjoy sushi, never eat it at a regular Vegas buffet because it just isnt that good (excluding Rio and Bellagio buffets) so I won't fault Mirage really for that.  The shrimp cocktail and crab legs were as good as most other buffets.  They're Chinese food was not very good along with alot of their sides like potato salad, mashed potatoes, and other veggies etc.  And while they do have gelato, their selection is quite small, (4 flavors of which the hazelnut was the best), the other desserts did pretty much suck. The cheesecake was incredibly gross along with a not so good apple pie.  And since we all know dessert is pretty much the best part of a meal, that definitely didn't leave the best taste in my mouth.

My baby loved the choice of bread and I liked how we could toast them right there. I do wish that they had more people manning that station though because it sucks that I had to wait for quite a while.

We didnt even get through half of it until we were totally full. I didnt go back because of the price,  its cheaper for me to go to Bouchon and get something because my husband and I eat so little.

I guess its great, if the price was lower (maybe like $10) I would be here all the time. At least the hotel should give a discount for people renting rooms there. I stayed at the Mirage for 5 days and they didnt give me anything.

I broke my personal rule of not eating Asian food at an American buffet once again, but after two nights of partying in Vegas, I was desperately craving for something Chinese.

3233000,2014-03-04,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"After a truly dreadful experience at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace last night (Voted best buffet? By whom? A bunch of drunks?), I was delighted to have just the opposite experience tonight at Cravings! Seriously...from start to finish, it was like night and day!

To begin with, the first thing we noticed as we walked in (other than the fact that we WERE able to walk right in) was that everything smelled and looked incredibly appetizing (a real contrast to Bacchanal's rancid-smelling steam tables!). A quick turn around the stations (which are organized in a neat oval, so you can easily see what's available) showed that there was plenty available for us to eat (we're vegetarians, and my husband has a seafood allergy, so we're a little pickier than a lot of buffet diners).

Most importantly, everything was beautifully fresh, clearly labeled, and nicely presented. Again, after our experience of wilted greens, dried-out rice and bread, and tasteless pizza the night before, the contrast was striking. This looked and smelled, from the get-go, like stuff we really WANTED to eat rather than something we were settling for.

Another important point: When I asked the people at the stations what was in this dish or that, they KNEW, without having to scratch their heads, mutter ""I dunno"" and go find someone else (yes, we had that experience at Bacchanal as well).

Everything I had was delicious (and it was quite a mixture...ranging from vegetable spring rolls from the Chinese station to beautiful Arab-style hummus, tabouli, and FRESH, SOFT pita from the Mediterranean station). I was especially impressed by the range of cheeses in the deli section. Sage Derby! Guinness-laced Irish Cheddar! Yum!

Just because, I sampled the pizza as well, and again, the contrast was marked. This pizza was fresh and tasty, and I would have had more if I hadn't had so many other things I wanted to sample.

I think my favorite part was the salad station. A nice selection of lovely, fresh greens, and all kinds of toppings and mix-ins...and the entertaining salad chef puts it together for you and tosses it to order for you!

I don't eat it myself, but you seafood fans will be happy to know that yes...they have unlimited king crab legs and drawn butter. Every buffet in Vegas has unlimited crab legs. It's a thing.

Oh, and did I mention the free beer and wine? That's right...you get all the beer or wine you want as part of the price of your meal (soft drinks as well, of course).

And the price? Well, this is Vegas, so it's not not cheap, but it's not bad at $26.99/person (especially when you factor in the drinks). We had a better food selection, MUCH better quality food, a knowledgeable and friendly staff, a better 
selection of drinks, and just an all-around better experience, at a fraction of the cost. From here on out, Cravings will be our FIRST pick when it comes to buffet dining in Las Vegas!",k_kX8RVJZdglSYiZ-pPEdQ,4,0,4,t-h9l6DfkI723RtozWQqkQ
3233138,2016-10-04,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Went for early dinner on a weekday around 5 pm. There was a line of about 20 people and it moved pretty slowly. Once we were seated, we were very surprised to find the restaurant almost empty. I don't understand the wait if the restaurant is barely half full. Empty tables everywhere. 

Food was mostly average, however the clam chowder, make your own tacos (especially loved the fresh guacamole), and tamales were really good. They also have a pasta cooking station which was good. They didn't have a menu or list indicating which pasta types, sauces, or other ingredients you can add to your pasta which was very unpractical. You'd have to peek into the cooking station to try and get a glimpse of what's available. I had bowtie pasta with alfredo sauce, pesto, and bacon. 

Crab legs were small and dry, prosciutto and cheeses were dry (you can tell they've been left out a while - maybe since breakfast or lunch), ribs were dry (sauce was good though, so it's a shame the meat was so dry), pizza tasted old. 

Dessert was super meh. Small selection and all of it tasted stale (pastries, cookies, and cakes were all very dry). Only decent thing were the mini cupcakes (the kind you buy in a 12-pack at the grocery store...)

Servers were good with clearing dirty plates.

The buffet is located to the right of the Mirage front entrance, right off the casino.

The buffet dinner costs about $30 per adult, and included unlimited beer and wine. Most buffets charge between $15-20 extra per person to add unlimited beer/wine, so that was a huge bonus for us! Beer and wine is served at the back bar, be sure to give your bartender a buck or two every time you go back to the bar. If you have any beer or wine left, drink it down a little and they will put the remaining amount in a plastic cup so you can take it with you.

The buffet has a huge variety of items, from a nice salad cheese/charcuterie station, soups, Asian station or two, American, Italian, and also a meat carving station. The buffet had something for everyone!

The dessert station had a lack of variety, that's the only thing I would say needed some help.

I loved that they had a little something for everyone. The coffee was YUMMY. The pizza was delish, bubbly cheese and spicy sauce right out of a brick oven. The prime rib was over cooked, but the baked ham was yummy. In the southern foods section they had the most amazing creamed corn ever. Fresh fresh FRESH jumbo shrimp w/ cocktail sauce. fantastic salad bar where they would make a personal salad for you. And absolutely kick ass kim chee.

But dessert....piece de resistance. I was so full I didn't originally even want any. But my friend said they had bread pudding, so I had to check it out. OMG. So so so good. Melt in your mouth magic. They also had a wide range of cakes, brownies, warm and gooey cookies, and homemade gelato.

What really made the whole experience though was the woman working in our section. Very attentive. Never let a plate sit on our table longer than a minute or two once we were done with it. She was fun and chatty and had great restaurant tips and show ideas. When I told her I loved the bread pudding she told us a great story about the origins of the recipe.

The shrimp made me a bit nervous to eat, so I didn't really touch the seafood area. My boyfriend ate the shrimp, and he was just fine. But, seafood makes me kinda nervous at buffets. Lol.

Whenever LV new buffets open on the strip, ala wynn, PH, bellagio, Mirage, they are the shit to begin, then go downhill fast while prices increase.
The Mirage buffet is another example.
For those that can actually taste quality and arent automatic shit-inhalers, big time crap here. After 3-4 years decided to plunk down a ridiculous $75 bucks for a sunday brunch. BIG mistake. But where else can you really eat under $50 for two except mcdonalds?

Good:
Pastami pizza (but limited selection wheres the cool veggies/pepperoni homey?
the mexican rice
Diet cokes strong like bull
salad bar (so-so limp-ass romaine lettuce but good toppings)
Deli cuts next to salad bar=its ok, I guess, but I dont pay $35 to eat mortadella cold cuts bro.
Service- fast at picking up plates and refilling. Another 15% so that makes buffet 85 bucks for two. Frightening, and it sucks.

The bad:
Crab legs-dry and tasteless, 1000% frozen. (acutally some still frozen pick fast or angry mob behind you will press)
Oysters turned into oyster shooters to mask the huge size and farm-raised taste.
Chinese station=worse than panda express. MUCH worse.
Sushi station---OMG 1/4 of a inch of fish in their prepared handrolls. Not joking. I  posted a pic;insanely claseless ripoff, 98% unchewable seaweed and rice. Wow what a fucking joke.
nachos=no melted cheese, no taco meat, but they have tortillas! Ridiculous. Yeah, I guess I'll make a salsa burrito with lettuce, LMAO
Fish on dishes, sitting and waiting for the bus...missed many buses.
Coated buffalo wings=wow gross orange coating, filthy.
Leftover breakfast items=no thanks nastee.
seafood ceviche, etc=anything at raw bar is a total joke and crap.
Dumpling/noodle section=crappy pork or chicken, or something that somewhat resembles shrimp (maybe its distant cousin from the farm-rasied sewers of bangladesh) No offense, bangladeshians.

Appetizers:
Nice selection.  Cravings claim to fame is their new sections of global cuisine.  You can have some nice appetizers to entrees from each section. 

Salads:
Very nice salad section.  They will make custom salads to your order.

Main Entree:
They have many worldly selections representing from China, Mexico, Japan, Italy and more..   Some are better than others but the variety is good and quality is above average. 

Desserts:
Since Cravings breaks everything out into their own sections, they have a decent dessert section as well.  Most are mass manufactured goods and some are custom, like the gelato.

I was torn to give them 3.5 or 4 stars, but decided to round it off to 4 stars since they deserve something better than a 3.  So if you have any ""Cravings"" for worldly cuisine, this is a good place to go.

So I'm rating Cravings with this in mind.  I sampled a little bit of everything, and it was meh...nothing special, nothing note worthy. Starting with the pasta station, the sausage was like warm and the cheese ravioli were soggy. Moving on to the carving station, roast turkey was juicy, but tasted like processed turkey breast. The mashed potatoes are clearly powdered, and the gravy had several clumps of gelatinized goop. The corn was tasty. I skipped the seafood due to an allergy. The Mexican bar provided Taco Bell quality cheese sauce and ground beef. Moving forward to the sushi station, as good as you can get for sushi on a buffet, bulk made rolls. As for the Asian station, the pork dumpling and noodle soup was bland and the noodles were undercooked which  is shocking for a buffet soup. The gyoza was dry and hard, and the wonton was stale. They did have descent desserts and included alcohol, so that was a plus.

WHAAT!?! how awesome is this???!! they made it a personal experience, made small talk and we walked out of there satisfied... in this world where everyone is so busy and into what theyre into, it really says something about someones integrity when they genuinely care!! just want to make a shout out to: chef Jose Cruz and chef Douglas Oyama!!! they are two cool mofos and w/o a doubt, will be back to their buffet!!!",xZDovqMdVGNOmjKK83VbUw,4,2,5,dj0gaEPWUQV_XrfMksUrxg

The food was pretty good & there were pretty good selections. They also had stone crab claws when we were there & I ate like 5 plates of those. They also had a pasta station where they make the pasta on the spot for you. I believe they have two different sauces & types of pastas each day that you can choose from, and then you can choose any of the toppings available to be added into the pan. It was really good.. I ended up getting both sauces & had two plates of pasta. I also ate some of the snow crab legs & a various selection of other food. Granted, I was under the influence when I came here, but I really thought that this buffet was good & that it was underrated. I don't remember much of the dessert selection but I ate mostly the ice cream for dessert.

We were given a coupon during our stay in Vegas last summer, when we dined here, for a 2 for 1 brunch buffet, any day of the week, anytime before 3pm, with No Expiration Date. It was to encourage us to return to eat here again sometime in the future. We were counting on this deal this time around, to allow us to have a good meal before our current on-a-budget stay in Vegas was over.

When we got to the buffet cashier, we were told that they wouldn't accept our coupon, because they are no longer honoring that deal. They said the coupons where being given out too much, so they stopped taking them. Well...fine, stop handing them out, but honor the ones that were already given out. It isn't our fault that you over estimated your popularity.

We talked to the Food and Beverage Manager, and he condescendingly told us he'd give us 20% off on ""good faith"" on 2 full price buffets, so $20 per person instead of $12. No.  What he SHOULD have done, what the SMART, ""good faith"" choice would've been, was to honor the deal the restaurant made with us when they issued us the coupon with No Expiration Date!  Then, he'd have 2 satisfied customers who would give them good reviews, instead of 2 pissed off ones, who will Yelp, Facebook, and just plain Tell everyone we know to choose a different dining option and never this one.  It isn't fair, or honest, and it's just bad business practice.

Not really the point, but it isn't like either of us are large enough people to cost them a lot of money anyway.  Just saying, MAYBE 1 and a half plates of food each, not even enough to add up to the $12 discount price in actual product. Well worth the cost for them to exhibit good customer care and keep us coming back when we had more to spend in the future.

Go elsewhere. Mandalay Bay has a VERY nice buffet, affordable too, with extremely nice people working for them. Choose them instead. Stay away from the uppity Mirage.",fpFrf8v3hTrVRrMCaPrvhg,1,0,1,-WNfOpXgTl3TvVx8R3452A

Most of the food was inedible. I basically ate cheese, crackers and salami, along with the stir-fry  veggies. Everything else was gross and a waste.

Today we arrived at 4:00 PM, just as dinner was starting, so it was crowded. I was using my Las Vegas Advisor 2-for-1 coupon (not a free coupon book-- I paid $37 for the book), and was hoping to also use MLife points to pay for the remainder of the meal-- but they wouldn't let me use both (even though I have over $100 in points for using my new MLife Mastercard). I was ticked, but went ahead and paid my $31.99 for dinner. I wish I wouldn't have bothered. 

We usually go for lunch, but thought that there would be more to choose from for dinner-- we were wrong. They did have crab legs, but they were so small that it took too much work to make them worthwhile. They didn't have smoked salmon, which was disappointing as that's one of my favorites and they always have it at lunchtime-- I asked and was told that they don't serve it at dinner. So basically, it was the same food for $8 more. My husband had to hunt to find enough to make a meal out of. The Asian section is really weak. The prime rib was OK. There was absolutely nothing special to justify the price of this buffet. The desserts were nothing spectacular at all-- in fact, a fairly skimpy selection once you eliminate the no-sugar-added stuff. The raspberry sorbet was pretty good, but that was about it for the dessert section. I do love the cappuccino at the end of the meal.

I never thought I would feel so negatively about the Mirage's buffet, but I doubt we'll be going back again for a long time. You have to serve yourself your own beverages, and the beverage section is in a rather inconvenient location. There is no real wait staff to bring you extra napkins or utensils,and they take forever to clear the tables off. Honestly, I haven't felt this disappointed in a buffet in a long, long time. You can go to the Fiesta Henderson and for $7.49 be treated like a king. We went to the Palms last week and had a great buffet for around $10. I know that most people are being held captive on the Strip, but it would be worth the car rental fee to have a car and drive to the outlying casinos to eat. They seem to appreciate the business, and the food is every bit as good, if not better. I have no desire to go back to the Mirage. And I was so disgusted with this whole thing that I did not stop and gamble a cent. We just walked straight out the door. Totally disappointing!!",Qe9_XZzYNCIIj_VcMxYcmg,1,0,2,QKL_T-IWOpXmrTxDMgnfdw

Service- it's 100% self serve, you get your own drinks and your plates sit on your table till you leave or until you start giving super dirty looks to all the servers around you. Also the carpet is absolutely disgusting in here!

The price is ridiculous for what mediocre food you get and especially it being completely flavorless. The prime rib wasn't even salted.

My opinion on the buffets in Vegas is you get what you pay for. That being said, we opted to try the buffet here because we didn't want to wait in a 1-2 hour line at the Wynn. 

I had been here only once before, about 6 years ago, and since then, they changed a lot.. from what I remember, anyway. We came around 7 and had to wait maybe 20 minutes to get seated. I liked how everything was spread out, so it was really easy to get what you wanted, and move on. The rice pilaf was really good, along with their meat. My friend and I thought it was awesome that they had a panini and gyro guy who would make you one to order. I immediately decided on a turkey and cheese panini. After waiting about 5 minutes for someone to come help us, a man who barely spoke english grumbled that we get what he makes us, and put together a sloppy-looking panini with ham, cheese, onion, and some pesto. After all of the hassle it took to get one, the sandwich didn't taste all that great. Their spinach-artichoke dip was also not a winner with us. Too much spinach, not enough flavor. You really do get what you pay for, so I wasn't expecting too much out of it. Can't say I was really surprised.",U1e7IE9A_358yG4pNBjmMw,1,0,3,Z4gl7i1x9XJt0JfDkbyUNw

Drinks at this buffet are all self-serve, except beer and wine, which you have to request from the bartender who pours it for you. They have the cool soft drink dispensers with the electronic screen which is neat because it offers a wide selection! I only made my way to the alcohol though. It may be cheap wine, but I didn't care since it was included with the price.
As far as the food goes, it was definitely a flop. Selection was also very limited. I had a hard time finding things I actually wanted to try.
All of their poultry offerings including the roast turkey, cajun chicken, fried chicken etc were beyond dry. I had to save it with cranberry sauce, gravy, or simply eat it with the mac and cheese. Their mac and cheese was one of the few selections which were very good.
Crabs legs were extremely salty. I got three pieces and could barely finish them. 
The pasta dishes were overcooked but it's to be expected at a buffet. Pasta is usually good fresgly prepared and eaten right away. The cheese ravioli I had here was ok. 
The asian station had bao filled with shrimp which was weird. They had a weird stir-fry, chow mein noodles and the rest were empty. The sushi were the typical grocery store selections of cali rolls and other rolls with imitation crab or cream cheese.
The tamales from the mexican section had no flavor. It was simply salty. Costco sells a pack of tamales that are so much better. How sad is that?
I was at the buffet with a friend who was enjoying his shrimp and crablegs and that was basically all he really wanted. 
I quickly got bored with dry meat and limited selection. The deserts werent even good. I simply sat and waited while filling up on endless wine.

Overall this was definitely a decent buffet for the strip. Everything was decent quality, but don't expect that to be synonymous with authentic. 

For example, the sushi. First, woo hoo, there's sushi!! But I'm not even sure how you physically pack rice so tightly. Biting into the rice of nigiri was like biting into a sausage. 

Some of the pasta from the italian station also tasted like the marina sauce came from a can. 

But beyond a couple dishes, mostly everything was in the 3.5 stars and above range. There was also a fairly large variety of dishes to choose from. 

It seems that cravings is willing to spend the money on decent food, and they include beer and wine. I think their focus should be on now improving the authenticity of cuisine and maybe even going beyond to offer drinks like thai ice tea and a wider variety of desserts like crepes or sticky rice with mango.

Other than that, it was a big pile of meh. The sushi, if you can call it that, was absolutely sad...little rolls of something that only half-resembled what you would buy at a cheapo convenience store. The asian section was blech, the pizza was ok if you prefer two inches of crust, and the rolls were hard. I used to like this buffet but it's just not the greatest.

We were staying at the Mirage and decided to go downstairs to the buffet for breakfast.  We got there around 9:30 and there was no line for a Monday morning.  The inside of Cravings felt a little stuffy as it seemed like it was in the middle of the casino floor.  The décor was definitely a no fuss but that did not matter so much to me since all I wanted to do was eat food.  There was an omelet station, which was provided ready made omelets.  The guy who was making them was fast and quick and it tasted really good.  However, I did not really enjoy anything else.  The potatoes and eggs did not taste fresh and felt that it was sitting out.  Instead of trying another food item, I just got another omelet and paired it with some fresh fruit.  

I also saw the dessert area, which was surprisingly pretty big.  I tried a cookie from there and it was pretty tasty.  Overall, I think that the buffet's food is 2 stars, but I upped one star for omelet and the dessert area.",P26CLVR2qhj2NYMz0b3IGg,1,1,3,8_mbMOttxw-yfNTimnwkfA

There are different stations with different types of cuisine and there's also a cook making omelettes to your taste.

The oriental section was good with a nice selection of sushi (that add more variety than other renowned buffets like the Bellagio).

The only disappointment was the dessert station that had a very limited choice compared to other buffets.

Definitely interesting the chance to pay a lower price for a take out option.

We were pleased with our dinner.  The design is so much more friendly than the old set up.  The only thing I thought was that the seating looked almost like diner seats but that didn't matter.

There is a wide variety of stations from which to choose.There are: Italian, carving, Rotisserie, Latin, Raw Bar, Fishmonger, Noodles, Chinese, Salad, and Desserts.  Those are the names on the lights at each of the areas.

Standouts tonight were the asparagus, lobster bisque soup--better than what I had recently at a high end Strip restaurant, the ravioli, and the desserts.  I mark them down because their prime rib that was supposed to be rare was more medium than rare even though she cut into a new piece.  I could have told her to cut in the middle, but she took from the end.

The dessert selection was nice.  I had some red velvet cake, a cookie, and the newest serving idea--a chocolate shaped mini tea/coffee cup filled with chocolate mousse and topped with whipped cream.

Service was very good.  In fact I had to stop her from refilling my iced tea so many times because I was going to a show and I didn't want to have to leave in the middle for a bathroom break.

3973579,2010-04-08,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"This place came recommended by many as the buffet with the best value food-cost wise. 25 bucks for dinner on the weekday. For my first round, I got the beef roast from the carving station, shrimps, crab legs, fish (cod and bass), sweet potato fries, and a salmon skin roll. The beef was delicious but a bit over processed or too tenderized. And you can't really choose how much it's cooked. They just slice you off a piece. And I love sweet potato fried but these were just ok. The crab was too salty for me. Next I got a bowl of pho and wonton noodle soup from the noodles station as well as some porridge/congee from the Asian station. Yeah I know I'm very Asian. They were piping hot and so tasty. The bowls are weird though so you can't put too much in there without it spilling. I couldn't eat too much after that so I went to the desserts, getting some fruit and gelato. I love that they have their own display case of gelato - about 8 different flavors worth. There's so many other stations too - pizza/Italian, Mexican, seafood, Asian, carving, salad, cold foods, noodle, and desserts. Something for everyone. 

I also came here for champagne brunch a couple years ago and it was amazing. We stayed for hours, enjoying the food and out mimosas. Also a good price for good food.",shVyD312LNnLUvQEPdzo7g,1,1,4,Nj6ShNu_CkVDY0Hym5ba2A

The food is constantly refreshed, and it's very clean.  Everything is separated into categories.  The food is labeled very clearly.  And they have many gluten free options which are also clearly labeled (a big relief to my wife).  Crab legs with the shells split and ready to eat.

The weak points are:  
The mimosas are made with the cheapest sparkling wine possible (to be expected, I guess).  
The wine I'm sure is of equal quality, but we didn't bother anyway.

4025664,2010-08-25,8,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Oh I really enjoy this buffet....

In the past I never really enjoyed the buffet at Mirage, but ever since Cravings buffet was established I've became a fan of this place...

The decor is sophisticated at it's best.. all the nice LCD TVs along the entry way showing a slow motion of an egg being dropped into a pile of flour.... awesome way to start a buffet!  (lots of other food related video clips for your enjoyment!)

Here are the typical review section for a buffet...

Pizza:  Pretty good.. probably about as on par as CPKs... so pizza lovers will enjoy.

Carving station:  Prime Rib and Ham.... decent prime rib as it was more red than how I've liked it, but the server was nice enough to carve the other side for me and was very attentive!  Definitely a plus!

Mexican food section:  Had some breakfast burrito but didn't taste that great.. pretty dry in preparation so decided to past on this section for the rest of the time there.

Cold seafood:  Had snow crab legs and shrimp cocktail for brunch!  Cool!  I didn't really eat too much of this because it seemed too early for me for crab legs but others were diggin this!

Hot seafood:  Had some paella, pesto cream mussels, and some salmon... they were all fair tasting.

Special metal room for fresh Chinese noodles!  This was my favorite!  A chef is inside this steel room cooking fresh noodles with the options of wonton soup or beef stew soup.... had some gyoza and also few dim sum servings (little shrimp wrapped in rice paper), all very tasty!  The best part was hot roast duck and BBQ pork to go along with the noodle soup!  YUM!!!  Definitely my favorite!

Chinese food section:  Not a big fan... bored of all the orange chicken that everyone is serving and beef with broccoli, I think I will past for sure..... (But the egg drop duck soup was very delicious!  Not salty yet sweet tasting!  Add some scallions and cilantros and you are definitely good to go here!)

Crepe station:  Fresh peach / peach cream crepe.... wow!  One of the best  crepes I've had in a while as the cream reminded me of Beard Papa's except is a little bit tarty..... but not overly sweet and just right...  Crepes were made to perfection so it turned out awesome!  Had to share it with everyone though.. couldn't finish this large chunk of heaven!

Salad station:  Skipped this because I was getting really full, but noticed that they had fresh made Paninis if requested.... so for those of you who like to take a little snack out of the buffet for later.. this option would be great as those sandwiches looked healthy and wonderful!  I'll give it a try next time!

Dessert station:  By this time I'm ready to faint..... but had to pull myself to take a look.... took a sugar free cheesecake and that's about it... not bad.....  Had to end the meal with ice cream though... so grapefruit gelato was on my menu to clean up my palate.....

I ate: A panini, deep dish pizza, gelato, sushi, chinese noodles, mashed potatoes, crab legs, shrimp, chilaquilas, breakfast burrito, and washed it down with 20 mimosas. Yes 20. The lady was awesome. I would take a sip after she finished pouring and she would come back and fill the little that I had drank. Then Liz didn't want hers and I aqcuired two glasses. This turned into a competition between Kelly and I, who could drink the most before she left the table. because this lady would always refill.

I love you lady. I asked you to come home with me but you wouldn't. But you ensured me to definitely come back.",u26GIke458eOK6sOy9tf8A,0,0,5,v2kXjW9xuJGWBoJ9F3QMCA

Roast beef carving station had no horseradish at all. The Chinese food was limited to beef broccoli and pepper steak. Their wonton soup was also fairly tasteless.

The buffet does offer free beer (Bud Light and Goose Island, at the time of the visit) and wine.

The soda machines are the new 100+ variety types.

The fish station had your garden variety of crab legs and one type of fish, which tasted like it'd been left out for a good while.

4067935,2016-06-07,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Even though I've been to Las Vegas close to 10 times (annual trips), I've never been to Cravings Buffet so decided to give them a try during my April 2016 vacation since I heard that it was a buffet with all you can drink beer and house wine.

Out of the 4 buffets on the Strip that I experienced during my April 2016 vacation, this buffet was one of the larger buffets. Just for comparison purposes, on this trip, I went to Bacchanal which was the largest and second most expensive, Cravings which is slightly smaller (third expensive), followed by Monte Carlo Buffet (least expensive), and Sterling Brunch (smallest but most expensive).

I can only have 3 beers during a meal so in terms of all you can drink beer, I didn't really drink much. The beer was draft beer and I think I ordered Coors or a Bud Light (I can't remember which I ordered but it was a beer brand that you can get almost anywhere). For the beer and wine, you go to the corner at the right of the buffet and ask for a draft beer or house wine.

This place (just like Monte Carlo's buffet) is self serve for soft drinks. The soft drink machine was one of the higher end ones which allowed things like cherry Coke and allowed you to mix soft drinks with certain flavours.

In terms of food, I concentrated mainly on the seafood selection and the carving station. The seafood was good as was the carving station although I found the beef to be too red for my liking. The desserts were good as well.

The servers did a good job for me of taking my plates. Most of the time when I went to get a new plate and returned to my chair, my old plate was removed.

I don't remember the price that I paid to have a late lunch at Cravings Buffet but there was a voucher at the Tix4Tonight booth that you can purchase for Cravings.

I found the buffet to be good and slightly better and more selection than Monte Carlo's buffet (and also slightly more expensive). Since I'm not a heavy beer drinker, for me, it was merely a chance to have a few beers without having to think about any extra costs.

I wouldn't have any issues returning to Cravings in my next Las Vegas trip. However with all the other buffets on the Strip that I haven't tried, nothing really stood out enough for me to say ""I HAVE to return here"".

I would probably rank them 3.5 stars which rounds up on Yelp to 4 stars since half stars aren't allowed and I don't want to shortchange them.",b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,4,0,4,1TQli66vDC4UjaiSBv0jwg

We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.

The prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away. 

The Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.

the italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold.

They had some very basic ""sushi"" rolls, none of which used raw fish. The italian food was laughable, but that's generally how it is out west. The chinese food was pretty good, but that was not enough to save them. And for the price, they needed to have a lot more going on here. It cost almost as much as the buffet at the Bellagio, which was absolutely the most elegant buffet I have ever seen. In my opinion, skip this one and go to the Bellagio.",obvm_4RP60RCWIllaFN4yQ,1,0,3,WTHnlvzNthTiid_JFyfN5Q

it's approx $26 for the buffet and champagne. when i went in i got the congee (rice porridge) and it helped me feel better instantly. i also went to the dim sum section and got some dim sum and a bowl of won ton noodle soup (which also helped my hangover). after feeling better i enjoyed all the sections around the buffet: asian, seafood, mexican, italian, etc.

It's not the newest Buffet on the Strip and it's starting to show. Most menu items don't state if they're gluten free or vegan, they don't offer individual plated items like the trendy Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal Buffet, and they'll laugh if you ask for fresh pressed juice. Most of the food here is just average, with me continuing in search to find a menu item to write home about.

With that said, they do have some amazing perks to lure Yelpers who see their 3 star review to stop by. First of all they offer unlimited wine and select beer. Yes, unlimited. It's not an additional $14 per person which is the average around the Strip, it's included in your Buffet price! Compared to the $14-$27 drinks by the pool, it's worth it to stop by Cravings beforehand for a few drinks while enjoying your DIY fruit and cheese plate. 

Is it the best buffet in Vegas? No. But compared to prices for alcohol and light snacks in the area, dropping $11 (discounted from Tix4Tonight across the street) for an AYCE buffet, its still a steal. Go in with low expectations and you'll find a few reasons to leave happy. Best of all they do offer a variety of gluten free items and are willing to make anything gluten free if you ask - even pancakes, pizza and fried chicken sliders!

We walked around the different options but found that regular breakfasts would cost the same amount, or more, as the buffet (14.99 I believe). The choice was pretty obvious.

BREAKFAST:

yummy pastries- the muffins, cookies, and donuts were delicious. The croissants not so much. 
bagels with lots of different toppings
omelette station ( I didn't try but looked good)
fresh fruits
cereal
deli meats and cheeses
good hash browns

ceviche (scallops and shrimp)
pot stickers
seafood
salad (you choose the toppings and they make it/toss it for you)

the bar!! - mimosas/champagne were not included since it was a friday. But I really wanted one! the bartender checked and it was 11.99.

We were getting hungry and so were our friends. We all decided to come here for dinner. Make sure you have your ""M life"" card, as it does help points wise.

For dinner its $26.99 per person, yes I know it is a little steep but its Vegas plus you are getting a lot of food. When we arrived, the line was pretty long at 8:00pm on a Tuesday night but the lone cashier kept the line moving. While standing in line we were laughing at the LCD TV's they have up. At random times they will have different foods flashing up but in slow motion (kind of like food sex) not going to explain anymore, you will just have to go yourself to see it!

The host who sat us was not too friendly but we were seated pretty fast, our table was close to the action so we didn't have to walk to far to get to everything. Only thing I totally hated was the bathrooms which were not located inside the buffet, you had to walk out hang a left, and there they were! 

Our waiter was nice but it seemed like her mind was somewhere else. She took our drink orders and said we could start eating whenever we would like. All four of us made a mad dash in different directions!  FOOOODDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This buffet has:

-Pho (it is freshly made at some point, but sits out)
-Wontons
-Crab legs (I was impressed that these legs had a lot of meat)
-Jumbo Shrimp
-Prime Rib
-Turkey
-Lemon herb chicken
-Various pre-made sushi and sashimi's (eeps do not touch)
-Various deli meats and slices of cheese
-Pasta
-Veggies
-Potatoes (Both mashed and wedges)
-Woodfire Pizza
-Mexican slow-roasted pork
-Greek Salad
-Chips and salsa
-Cornbread


Dessert:

-Mango or Pistachio pudding
-Chocolate Mousse
-Various cheesecakes (sugar free option too)
-Chocolate logs
-Large selection of sugar free stuff
-Macaroons (no I did not miss-spell it, it is not the French kind)
-Fruit
-Whipped topping
-Ice Cream
-Mini Pies
-Cookies


And oh so much more!


After about four plates, I was tapping out... I had to sit for about 20mins before I could start on the dessert end. 

The food was not bad unlike some of the reviews I have read. I put it this way some days are better than others, it happens everywhere you go! You just have to look and know before you decide on what you are going to grab and eat. 

Our waiter took our plates away pretty fast and our drinks were filled with a smile.

Also the squash soup, shrimp ceviche, and guacamole were delicious. Minuses were pasta dishes and Chinese noodle dishes; they had sat out so long they looked dried out.

This place honors the Military by offering 20% off the bill. That, alone was the reason they will get 5 stars. No other place we went to in the 4 days we were gave any type of discount. 

The crab legs are split in half and were easier to eat. Our Grandsons love crab and shrimp and were in heaven. The Chef makes pasta and you can offer him a tip. Again, I say that Buffets that already charge $30 per person should not expect us to tip their cooks for  cooking something that should be included in the buffet already. 

Their prime rib was delicious. I skipped the salad bar and filled up on potatoes and prime rib. It was as good as any place I've been.

The dinner selection was quite extensive but since it is divided into sections, it's more than manageable.  The crab legs are fresh and quite delicious and the Asian section was just as good.  I got a bit of everything including the turkey, pizza and pasta.  The dessert selection is also original and the gelato was spot on.  There are several cooking stations serving up ready-to-make food, so freshness is not so much an issue.

This is one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever experienced. They have the treasured smoked ham that I always seek out when I am in Vegas.  They even had portuguese sausage the first day we were there!

I really did a disservice to myself by not walking around to all the sections of the breakfast buffet before picking something to eat; finally on the third breakfast there, my boyfriend took me by the hand and we walked the entire buffet.  They have a meats and cheeses section that reminds me of a traditional european breakfast (one of my favorites!), fruit, an omelette/egg bar, cereal, breads, waffles bar, pancakes, breakfast sausage, bacon, and even featured biscuits and gravy!  The gravy for the biscuits and gravy was a bit on the sweet side for me, but you could tell it was quality and had the right consistency.  Each morning they featured something different. 

The omelettes were one of my favorites... The chef perfectly prepared the omelettes so they not only look beautiful but the cheese is perfectly melted within the omelette.

I was really surprised when the chef walked me around the entire buffet and told me exactly what I could and could not eat. The results really shocked me. 

It is expensive per person (which didn't surprise me much since literally everything in Vegas is overpriced). When we were seated, I asked to speak to the chef about my allergies and they couldn't find him. It took about 20 minutes, but while we waited the manager and host came in to check every so often to let us know they were still looking, etc and hadn't forgotten about us. When he did come, he was super nice and took us around the entire buffet to show me what I could eat with my gluten and dairy allergy. As in, he literally pointed to every single item of food in the whole place and said yes or no. There was a lot more than I thought. They actually had quite a few gluten free options. The pasta station has GF pasta and a separate pot of water so they don't cross contaminate. The Mexican station has corn tortillas upon request (just make sure you get a person that is used to working that station so they wipe down the grill before grilling them!!), at the Asian station, they can make you noodle dishes without soy sauce (they use rice noodles). They have some varieties of sushi, and he said he could make some things that weren't usually put out. They even have GF bread behind the salad station upon request. There are GF desserts, too, however, they all have dairy in them. The chef even said that if there wasn't anything that looked appetizing or to my liking, to come find him and he'd make whatever I want. He was really kind and accommodating. I ate too much, which isn't usually a thing at a buffet. 

I didn't actually eat much from the seafood section, although they did have a large variety. All of the seafood just looked kind of sad at that time. I don't think I'm daring enough to eat oysters in the desert that look like they've been sitting out all day...",f9fM8nXGuQpTBBI_25E4VQ,2,0,3,EsQilaK7e_uArJngMIs-fg

They do have prime ribs. And they have other varieties - not great...but it's alright. 

Their dessert buffet, however, is a disappointment. there's nothing that i want to really eat. THe best thing about their dessert is their gelato ice cream section. 

Cravings is nothing like the big buffets, but it is way better than other buffets such as monte carlo, circus, flamingo, etc. In my book of vegas buffet..

0/5 Service: Service could've been a lot better, In a group of 8 plates tend to stack up and our buser was no where to be found. Drinks ran low, also they were stingy on the napkins. Seriously for $29.99 I expected a lot better. 

0/5 Food: Wish I had good comments to say about the food but no. The food lacked flavor and the meat cuts has a lot of fat or they were over salted. The seafood section lacked everything. You could tell the grab legs were very thin, dry, and just tasted rubbery. They had small little shot glasses of different shrimps like, shrimp cocktail, shrimp cevice, nothing tasted $29.99.

0/5 Price: $29.99 + tax + gratuity. They must know their buffet sucks because they charge you gratuity at the door. This place is definitely NOT WORTH IT.  

2/5 Desert: The desert area was very modern and cute probably the only thing good about this place is that it had Gelato and a good amount of variety of choices.

Out of the 6 buffets I've been to on the strip I would rate Cravings as #3 MAYBE #4. Behind The Wynn & Rio and possibly tied with the MGM(only had the lunch buffet so tough to compare)",bDbNA6qnScQa453kK7UeiQ,0,0,3,AyPIeGsuFiqAKEsMZFDbfg

It is a little pricey but with the dinner service you get all you can eat crab legs (snow crab) and all of the legs are cut in half for easy and quick access to the meat.   They do have claws but they are not cut (probably due to the thickness of the shell) but every waitstaff has crackers if you ask for it.   
Drinks are self serve and are one of those machines that has every flavor and lots of different choices.   The Chinese food is not so great but maybe that is a function of me eating in the large Asian community next to las vegas and food there is so good.

The dessert bar is so good and full of choices.   They also have a pasta bar where they will make you fresh pasta exactly to your specifications.

This was a first visit to Cravings, and it was a pleasant adventure.  I like the way the food was arranged, in niches, so that a few steps brought another semi-hidden surprise.  I ordered a glass of wine and was happy to see that the prices were very reasonable.

I bypassed all the carvings and the meats; we were seated near the desserts, so by the time I made my way to those sections, I was stuffed to the gills.  (Buffets never lose money on me, even when I'm paying).  But my husband and the other couple we were with made up for my shortcomings.  One of them raved about the prime rib, and the other thought the turkey was delicious.  But I loved everything I did try, especially the buffalo chicken salad, the beet, apple and orange salad, sushi cones, and the butternut squash and jalapeno soup.  I probably would have loved more, but my stretch denims were stretched out as far as they could go.

The only thing that didn't warm my heartstrings was the gelato for dessert.  I got chocolate, and it tasted ordinary and not very chocolate-y.  In their defense, though, I did put a dab of the warm chocolate lava cake on top of it.  The cake was so over-the-top chocolate-y that it may have masked the flavor of the gelato.

He was super friendly! We get there and the staff was sooooooooo beyond amazing that we decided to only come to this buffet from now on! 
Our waitress was Diane, oh my gosh! So very sweet! She makes you feel right at home! She didn't let us get up to get our drinks she was so kind.

Took the time to walk around the whole buffet to look at foods he can eat and to tell my sister what the food was cooked in. He personally made him his own pizza and French fries and took out a new dish of bacon with clean tongs for him. He gave us his card so we can call ahead of time for him to make my nephews food which was so amazingly kind of him to do.

eggplant- super salty

dumpling in the noodle soup (my friend tried it said ok, noodle and dumpling not as mushy as we thought since it's not made to order)

seaweed salad- average
                                 
Carving station: Salmon- overcooked
                          Prime rib- overcooked and really bad quality of meat

Salad station- make your own salad

Everything is fresh and the woman worked behind the counter was really nice. However they don't have any special ingredient not even arugula. 
Dressing is pretty standard too. 

sauteed vegetables or salad from different stations were all not bad.  

Mac n cheese- super marshy  (couldn't finish it)

crackers with few different choices of cheese- standard

hummus with super cold display like pita bread- standard

Dessert station- nothing looks very appetizing. 
cream brulee- the caramelized top was such a failure. It tasted like soft syrup layer float on top of it. We normally like cream brulee but it's just bad no one want to get another one.. 
cookie- alright, your typical cookie.
As I remembered the buffet at M resort or Pala were way better for the dessert option. 

Drink station: iced tea and coffee, standard. The machine made it difficult to make iced coffee your own.

also they have unlimited beer and wine if you drink. 

Didn't try anything else. I actually forgot to try the crab legs and cocktail shrimps!

One benefit was that the extra price came with lunch options as well. We enjoyed Asian, seafood, sushi, Mexican & Italian along with the standard breakfast items.

The crab legs were just ok and the chicken fried steak was too salty but the bacon, Belgium waffle, chow mein, desserts and carving stations were crazy good. I also loved that they had non fat milk. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again if we weren't staying at the Mirage but if you're really wanting to eat and get a large selection of choices - this place is a great choice.",1JbJjfW5LHDy4_Qj0bZzNw,0,0,4,t6gtWGtyDEk1ZKgc3huUsQ

There's a juice machine as well as a full service bar. If you can think it for a drink they have it. You will leave this buffet very satisfied! I would suggest the best time to eat would be before 10am, because after that it gets crowded. Overall this is an excellent place for groups or just two people.

4609063,2014-12-30,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Somehow my family always ends up on Vegas for Christmas Eve/holidays...so I've had my fair share of buffets from The Buffet to Wicked Spoon.

Cravings is definitely not a top-tier buffet on the level of quality and ""gourmet"" like WS or TB as I mentioned above. BUT what they lack in Vegas-status-quality, they have in quantity and affordable pricing! I HIGHLY recommend visiting tix4dinner at any of their booths on The Strip, or calling them and asking about their discounted buffet prices because our family of four saved $40 by getting our discounted buffet dinner on Christmas Eve! IT'S NOT SHADY, trust me!

Anyways, for about $27/per person for our Christmas Eve dinner, we waited for only 30 minutes (we were in the early end of the line) and THUS BEGAN THE FEAST. Cravings is well known for their UNLIMITED wine and beer...but they only have Goose Island IPA, Bud Light, and a red/white/pink from Libery Creek. OPEN BAR, ANYONE?! HAHA, but seeing as it was dinner, our family kept the vino flowing all night. It wasn't bad, but it was definitely average wine. No complaints over here, as it paired really well with my favorites: pasta bar (Astes was the BEST pasta chef--and she was so easy to talk to and really kept a positive attitude during her shift), steamed crab legs, the veggie spring rolls, and OF COURSE dessert. Faves were the cheesecake (I HAD THREE!!), fruit tart, and various cupcakes. Cookies were HELLA stale (UM EW) and the gelato was so watery it melted when I walked all the way to the opposite end of the room where our table was...sad.

I would TOTALLY come back here again. I mean, I've waited for over an HOUR at Wicked Spoon for dinner a few years back...and grant it, the food was definitely over the top and I felt spoiled rotten, BUT I wouldn't pay $80/per person when I can just get FULL AND BUFFET'D at Cravings for $27/per person with the same types of foods!!

The desserts were average. Nothing really stood out other than the bread pudding, which was great.

The gf's orange juice was served in a glass with a lipstick marking on it, which was definitely not hers (she didn't even have lipstick on). That was a real bummer.

Their sushi, like most other vegas buffets, really didn't taste all that fresh or good either.  The only thing I enjoyed at this buffet was their prime rib, which was somewhat decent.  I also liked the fresh made omeletts too.

The wait wasn't too bad - maybe 15 minutes to pay and get seated - but that's because this definitely isn't one of the better buffets on the Strip. That said, having not eaten at Cravings in a while, my two biggest observations are that I love what they're doing with the drinks now, but the food has definitely gone downhill since my previous experiences here.

With tax and the alcohol option, the price was about $37 per person, and I definitely got my money's worth with the mimosas :) The prime rib was pretty good (the first round I had was great, though the second round was slightly overcooked for 'medium rare'). Unfortunately the eggs benedict were low quality (mostly due to the bland Hollandaise sauce) and the pork bun I had had been sitting out so long that I couldn't take more than one bite of it. That said, the rest of the people in my group thought that their food choices were good - nothing special, but better than low-level buffet food.

Now, they used to bring drinks to the table, but at some point since my last visit to Cravings (which was, admittedly, several years ago) they added drink machines AND a full bar, which I love. No more waiting for someone to come around to fill your drinks, and since I especially drink a LOT of water, this is, to me, a far better option than drink waiter service.

And again, the fact that there wasn't a long wait like there is for the more popular/better buffets and that the alcohol option was worth it made it a great experience.",ArvvWxALAQwZYfrD6w3lrw,0,0,3,iGUIRPCPN_yffouafz036w

They were met on the first point but not on the second. Maybe this place rates well in terms of buffets overall, and maybe I shouldn't be evaluating it on the same terms I use for rating standard made-to-order places. I thought the price was reasonable -- $17 for lunch.

I didn't mind the bright, modern decor that's apparently bothered some people. I was annoyed, though, that the hosts at the front of the restaurant wouldn't seat us right away when there were cleary open tables in the dining room, and they weren't particularly friendly about it. Our beverage waiter was great, though, ncie and attentive.

My favorite items were the andouille sausage, the steak (I can't remember the cut), the broccolini, the shrimp cocktail, and the chocolate catalan and bread pudding for dessert. I liked the fact that dim sum (primarily buns and potstickers) was offered, but it was merely adequate. And the duck in the Chinese food station was overcooked.

Food selection: 5/5. Lots of choices from American food, Latin, Asian, Salad, and desserts.

Quality of Food: 3/5. That's where it gets a little hit or miss. Food is very hot and has nice presentation! However, the sushi was disappointing. Rice was on the hard side and tasted store bought.  Pizza was okay but I could get similar pizza from Pizza Hut. Soups were great, meat from the carving was great (try the ham), and the salad bar selections were awesome. I also love how MGM properties all have self serve touch screen beverage machines! No more waiting for a server to refill your drinks. Lots of juice and coffee options too!

Pricing: 1/5. I feel really ripped off. My fiancé and I went to the buffet around 11am today February 16th 2018. Normally the brunch price is around $24 per person but we were charged 75.75 for two brunch buffets (including tax). I think that's about 37 or 38 per person due to it being a holiday. I asked the person I was paying with what holiday it was today? She said she had no idea. Seems like the company just wants an excuse to charge people more money. Presidents' Day isn't until Monday. What the heck? At least educate your employees as to WHY we're paying so much more. 

Also apparently unlimited alcoholic drinks were included as I was told by the host but the selection was poor. I opted for a mimosa and it tasted like straight up white wine with a splash of orange juice. Not really what I wanted/imagined as a mimosa. Stick to the Bellagio's unlimited drink option if you're interested in that.

Mainly because they are so much better than ordinary buffets AND you have to eat enough to make up for the price you pay to get in. As far as Cravings go, it was alright. I ate some stuff that I wish I hadn't tried, and I ate some stuff that I loved. It's always like that at a buffet. 

I loved the layout of this buffet. It was must less hectic and cramped which I appreciated. It's clean, and typically modern and each section is divided up by the type of food it offers. My sister and I had a fun time trying each section at a time and by the time we got around to every single one, we were barely eating anything we got on our plates (bad bad bad!). I think some of my favorites were the mussels, ravioli, and the shrimp cocktails. My siblings and I also gorged on the nachos we loaded up with toppings. I would pass on the sushi because the rice was just so hard. If you're like us, you will just eat the fish and hide the rice under some other dish. If you're super Korean like my parents, you will like the fact that they serve kimchi. They had a pretty huge selection on desserts. The cupcakes are GROSS so please pass on those. Actually pretty much all the desserts were kind of unappetizing. Some of the cookies were okay but that's about it. My brothers liked the gelato they served but I was too full to try it.

His happiness was short-lived two hours later when the overly buff creature held his gut  and writhed in pain at the amount of food he had consumed. Your time at Cravings Buffet at Mirage will be the most magnificent during, but just learn to pace yourself as with everything in life. 

There was quite the selection to choose from and is pretty standard for a Las Vegas buffet. What stood out the most were the crab legs that were prepared so the customers wouldn't have to doggedly dig for the meat inside. As well, the prime rib and the salmon were top notch. I am extremely picky about salmon and there's no other way to describe it as best as my roommate had: ""The salmon melts in my mouth. How is this possible?"" Other than that, the other selections of food did not really stand out. Some of my friends claimed that the desert were some of the best they have tasted. I'm not a huge fan of deserts, so I refrained from weighing on the matter. All in all, I would say for $30 it is not a bad choice to fill up on an empty stomach.",2tKfVraqmTQt3iE5HRbLJg,2,2,4,90rLdmLGQWU122UnpuBzPw

4760449,2018-05-16,2,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"This was my first time visiting The Cravings Buffet at the Mirage.  I normally stay at 1 of the many MGM resorts when I come to town and have eaten at most of them, but as I said, first time here.  I must say I was very happy with the buffet and the atmosphere.  Walking into the Casino prior to going into the buffet, the Hotel itself inside is very nice and beautifully decorated.  I know the Mirage is older, but it still holds up well.

The buffet is $29.99 for one person, Sunday-Thursday.  They offer a lot for that price and the quality is very good.  The bonus with this particular buffet, is it comes with unlimited Beer and Wine.  You could sit there for hours drinking during and after your meal if you decided to do so, what an amazing deal.

The Buffet has a carving station with Prime rib, Brisket and Turkey.  I got the prime rib and brisket, my vote is go for the brisket, so tender and flavorful, it was very, very good.  The also have a chef's kitchen for made to order items, seafood (my favorite) I loaded up on tons of crab legs as usual.  Latin, American, Asian, Sushi, Italian, salads and a desert bar.  It also comes with all you can drink self self non-alcoholic beverages.

After my 3rd trip I had to tap out and start writing this review with beer In hand.  There was not only a large selection of various types of food, everything tasted fresh and was delicious.  I would recommend checking this buffet out when you are in town, for the price, it is hard to find a better deal.

Pro tips - Park in the Treasure Island parking lot and walk over to the Mirage, the parking is free at Treasure Island, you have to pay at the Mirage unless you are an Mlife member and have at least gold status to get free parking.  

Speaking of Mlife, sign up if you have not already done so, it is the MGM resorts loyalty program.  You can get discounts on all kinds of things, shows, slot play, table play as well as comps for food, etc. worth it.  I would also suggest getting my vegas slots on your iPhone, it is Connected to your Mlife card and can get you many more rewards.  As I sit here, this Buffets was free, thanks to me using my rewards, many of which you don't even have to spend money to get from the app, which is awesome.  My rating is 5 stars here, price, quality, free alcohol and overall atmosphere is excellent.

This is a review for their Dinner which was about $30/person.

1] Everything looked better than it tasted.
2] 70% of the food was cold/stale/salty.
3] if you come here for the seafood- do yourself a favor and dont:
- the crab legs were icy and super salty
- the sushi was pathetic, most of the sashimis were turning brown, nasty!
4] they attempted to label each of the stations according to ethnic
each station was a horrid disappointment, a sad attempt at gourmet fast food. 
5] Desserts: their pineapple cobbler was sure sugar. Their cookies where stale and hard, I think you can use it as a frisbe- chuck it at someone and you can give them a mild concussion. Oh, and their gelato was the worst! it was like warm soup ice cream. Yuck!
6] to top if off, the server is super rude. I think because they are too old to be working.

On this trip, we arrived at around lunch time and included in the brunch was all you can drink beer, wine and mimosas. I must say that the all you can drink deal, made for a couple of amusing and disturbing outbursts from fans of the adult beverage, so this is not just your run of the mill humdrum establishment. You get entertainment as well!
Food quality is better than average. I like the fact that you can make your own salad. So many buffets have someone mixing all your junk in stainless bowl and spilling it on your plate. I like to have the control please. Did you notice that those salad bars got scarce after the 9/11 attacks and all the fear that we would all be poisoned at a salad bar? Well, that happened right?..uh, no?
Back to this buffet, the only thing missing is a really great desert section. Maybe real ice cream instead of the yogurt dispenser please? 
So my advice is to hit this place for your first meal at 12: 30, and sit and eat and drink for about 2 hours, and you are good to go for the rest of the day. The $37.50 will look like a bargain.

I purchased a TravelZoo coupon, entitling spouse and I to a Sat or Sun brunch for 2 w/ unlimited ""champagne"" (sparkling wine) for $26 (+$1.58 tax, paid at venue, and tip).

Why not, I thought. We've never been.

Well, there are worse buffets in Las Vegas Valley (I'm talking off-Strip), but this has to be the worst buffet on the Strip. But it's at least passable (I've been to some off-Strip that would curl your hair!), and there were some midway-to-high points in the adventure.

Cashier was efficient and accommodating. Table service was great, lovely lady, not very friendly but attentive. She poured us our ""champagne"", Wycliff (just short of being bad, but drinkable by itself, so I was happy. I ordered an orange juice, swear to god, it tasted like TANG! Childhood memory! EW!

So what did we try? A LOT, but nothing from Mexico or Italy. 

We got lots of stuff from the Asian section. 
- Edimames: already shelled, nice.
- Japanese potato salad: nice.
- A little sushi: only the octopus was good, the others were grocery store style.
- Chinese buns: spouse liked them, pork & seafood, I only had the seafood, too doughy.
- Potstickers: good. Spouse liked these quite a bit, actually.

Then on to the seafood section.
- Large shrimps: good. But the cocktail sauce was obviously from a jar. Took a little drawn butter instead back to the table, that was nice.
- Bay shrimps, various preparations: avoid.
- Ceviches: avoid.
- Crab legs: the thinnest, chewiest, worst crab legs I've ever encountered. I took only one, ate half, yuck. Never again.

Spouse had lots more. What was it? Oh, biscuits/gravy (I tasted, so-so), some kind of potatoes gratin, what else? He was OK with all of it. Me, I had read the ups and downs of the prime rib. ""Only get it rare"", some have posted here. Well, spouse came back with a small non-rare, and it was so-so, he only ate half. I went, got bloody rare, huge piece, ate nearly the entire thing, I was very happy! Not the greatest prime rib, of course, but still, it was really good, at the end of the savory foods.

If there were ever a next time, I think I'd stick to the Asian section, try some of those egg-drop soups, etc.

Desserts? Sad. ""Mirage bread pudding"" was a mishmash of runny bottom of pan with hard-ass top of portion. Not good. The creme brulee was so-so. The only recommended ones we'd say would be the raspberry bar (very fruity, probably jam, but who cares!) and the marshmallows covered in dark chocolate (which were light after a huge meal like ours). 

To sum up. I would never go there and pay full price. I'd rather spend that money at the new Bacchanal @ Caesars, Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo, Bellagio, ARIA, etc. BUT if you get comp'd or get a great coupon deal, like that TravelZoo, I'd go and make the best of it.",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,3,1,2,7MHfLKqAfWdgtJBZ4iMqxA

The Macaroni & Cheese was so cheesy & creamy, and the Mashed Potatoes were outstanding. My friends raved about the Turkey and BBQ Ribs as well.

Alright when in Vegas, you've got to hit a buffet, it's just a must. I'm not sure how we decided on mirage, but I've never been here so why not. The prime rib was definitely something to rave about, super tender and juice not like most buffets, but the second round it was dry..Whyyyy. Consistency people! Consistency is key. 

Overall, it was extremely mediocre. Like the brink of EHHHHH and mediocre. Like it barely reached the standard of OK. Well, that's a $35 dollar buffet for you when there are $40-50 ones and even $80-90 ones during holiday season like bacchanal. There wasn't a lot of options or variety. Desserts are usually something I'm attracted to at buffets, but definitely not here. don't call your froyo soft serve ice cream gelato...because it's not. Such false advertisement. It's unlimited beer and wine which is nice, but it sucks that allllll drinks are self serve and we were seated on the opposite side...it was so far :( yeah we're lazy but when in Vegas, you just expect quality places with quality service!

I felt a little guilty cutting in front of the massive line with my Mlife card.  I can't figure out why there were so many people there, unless you are going to use the unlimited Beer and Wine I don't see what the attraction is for people any more.  It was really average to bad this time around.  The last time we went there for Lunch they had a Salad Station, with someone making Salads and they were really, really great!  Now the Salad Station is just a lame Salad Bar.  The Crab Legs this time were also tiny and pathetic and so picked over when I was there for dinner.  They were also really overcooked so they were very difficult to get out of the shell. 
 The Sushi tasted old and I couldn't even eat it.  I did like the Prime Rib and they were serving some BBQ Ribs which saved the day for me.  The desserts looked better than they tasted.  I have to say the service was fantastic, our server kept clearing plates and asking us if he could get us anything.  They really need to renovate this buffet like Excalibur recently did.  Shut it down for a while and redo everything.  I do like the drink machines, it is nice not having to wait around for a refill.  I would go there if you have a comp, but that is about it.  I think people would probably rate the buffet far worse if they weren't so happy about being able to drink for free for a couple of hours.

I enjoyed the salmon a lot because it wasn't overcooked and had just enough seasoning to make it interesting. The dessert wasn't that great either because the pies were still frozen. The fried rice was all soggy which wasn't too enjoyable and the ham was too salty.

4889227,2016-07-11,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Vegas buffets are always sort of hit-and-miss for me. Either they offer cheap grub that's usually mass produced and swimming in mystery juice, or it's something akin to a fine dining experience that tantalizes the taste buds and leaves you wanting more even though you're already busting at the seams. Cravings is more of the latter.

First and foremost, yes, it is a bit pricey, but two things that help offset that. First, the quality of the food that you're getting is pretty gosh darn good. Second, you need to use myVegas rewards, if you have them. Getting a two-for-one deal or even a free meal altogether makes it so much more worth it. 

On to the food. Let's just say that nothing here disappointed me. They had plenty of hit soups available that were absolutely wonderful. Their selection of Asian cuisine was unusually good, and what I'd refer to as ""Americana"" was pretty spot on, too. What I like about buffets like Cravings is that the food comes out in smaller batches compared to other places. This means that the food is fresh and the quality tends to sit a little higher across the board.

Oh, and who can say ""no"" to unlimited booze? Yes, that's right. Included with dinner is free beer and wine. You can always pay for something a little more fancy, if you want, but why would you? Enjoy what you are being offered!",QNb1ffvoWAJIdF0hF5B5DA,1,1,5,SAv6b6pNs7aTsmB8dmVZ9w

The sushi (or their attempt at one) was hard, so it was futile to even use a fork to pick it up. Our server was inattentive and seemed annoyed when we had to ask for drink refills.

Expectations were low, which I've now convinced myself is the way to go into a buffet. Then you either get what you were expecting or in the case of Cravings, you get more than expected. The day we went in, we didn't know brunch was a special thing. We received not only the option of mimosas, but a wide selection  of beer and wine with our meal at no extra charge. We stuck with mimosas as that just seemed the perfect thing after a evening out on the town the previous night. The pastries were good, better than you get at any free breakfast with hotel stay (comparing it to other hotels we stay at when traveling, not in Vegas). The croissants were cold but were flaky and not overly buttery. Almost the best I've had in the U.S. Bacon was warm and crispy, not overly greasy like typical buffet bacon. We sampled the Asian, Mexican, and Salad areas of the buffet. We liked everything we tried. I did wish the Mexican station had tamales, but that's only because I was craving them. I'm a salad whore and felt their more upscale way of making/serving their salad (they make it for you but you get to pick what goes in it) was a bit snobbish. It's served in these little bowls. Probably good for the average person. When I want a salad, I want a huge plate of salad! Delicious house dressing, btw. While we've visited almost all of the buffets on the strip, I put this one at about #4 behind the Wynn, Bellagio, and Rio (ok, a little off strip but I feel it still counts).

The food hasn't changed much over the years, and that's OK.  You know what to expect, and there are times that's nice.  Breakfast is our favorite time to visit, especially right before lunch as you get the best of both. 

Yes, the buffet is buffet food, that means it can be sitting there a while, however the omelet station is made to order.   While a little thing, I like the cheese and cracker station.  That's almost like desert to me, although the deserts are pretty good as well.

They had a good selection of foods, sorted by the type. Asian, American, Italian, fish, etc. The food seemed to be fresh, but they had obviously cut some corners on the food. The eggs Benedict was served on a roll, not the typical kind I'm used to. The shrimp was, well shrimpy. There was a long line to wait for the carving station. When I got the roast beef back to the table, it was rather fatty- a low quality of beef. 
The desserts seemed to be leaning heavily towards the sugar free side, which blows my mind. If you're going to a Vegas buffet, I'm sure you're not terribly concerned about your waist line. 
There was a lady that came by and picked up the used plates, but there was no other service available. You had to get your own drinks like some sort of shlub. 
I was pleased to see that there were about four different types of sushi, which seemed fresh. 
But they were lacking many things that I have come to expect on a Vegas buffet. They had no crab legs. The pizza was a shade better than Little Caesar's Pizza. 
Yes, the food was plentiful, but not the high grade that I have come to expect from the Mirage on everything else.
The drinks were impressive. Free beer. But they only have Anheiser Busch products. Boo. They had one of those magical Coca-Cola machines where you can get over a hundred varieties of soda.

The clam chowder, miso soup and smoked salmon weren't bad. The sushi selection was awful.

Been there with a French friend visiting the US because we had a 50% (or 30%?) off coupon which would make the whole day buffet on a Saturday at 25$ (you can get 11$ weekday brunch with that coupon from Tix4tonight).
Not a bad deal. Especially it includes free flow of wines and beers.

First: don't go there unless you have a discount coupon. I don't think the buffet is worth over 20$ (unless you drink a lot of alcohol).
The food is OK, very standard, slightly on the cheap side.
Suchi bar? lot of rice, nothing fine nor gourmet, small selection.
Cheese? industrial, small selection.
Meat? quite oily. American buffet? on the heavy side.
crab legs? yes unlimited snow crab legs. Frozen though and not cooked very well (very salty, watery).
Dessert buffet seemed great. Too bad I don't eat sweet.

I think it's a 3 stars food-wise, for 20ish $.

OK now why 2 stars? Service.
your dirty plates can sit on your tables for 20 minutes. piling up.

I felt the best they had to offer when we went for the Sunday night dinner was the Lamb Osso Buco,  and flank steak (ONLY if medium, otherwise it'd be too dry).  The other things were a little... off.

The Lamb osso Buco was soft enough that it would just fall off the bone, and it had a good flavor to it- not really gamey.  This went along well with the sauteed buttered wild mushrooms in the italian section of the buffet.

The Flank steak goes well with the port demi (which is alongside the porkloin wrapped in bacon, which didn't taste all that great...)  

There was also the Ceviche, which was waaaayy too sour, and not enough spice.  The Cioppino was really salty and super mini-shrimped.  They also had dim sum (which was bland) and sushi (which had meat which didn't look so tasty so I didn't try it).  I don't remember much of the other things because they didn't taste good.

Hands down the best thing from this buffet was the dessert!  Their mini pecan pies and mini lemon meringue were really good.

5029158,2015-12-14,8,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Today we enter another exciting episode of Anthony vs. the Buffet. As always, I win if I emerge with a full belly and happy about the things I put in it. The buffet wins if it makes me hate myself.

Round One:
I fill my first plate with a variety of sushi and pour myself a bowl of miso soup if for no other reason than the sushi station is adjacent to the bar (bottomless beer and wine for the win!). I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rolls and the miso goes down smoothly. I mean, is it even possible to screw up miso soup? In any case, I'm very happy with my first plate and ready for further punishment. Round one goes to me.

Round Two:
A thought strikes me as I chug my third glass of wine. It's only 11am. I should get some breakfast food. I mosey on down to the omelette station and have the chef whip me up one with everything. I supplement it with way too much bacon and sit down to enjoy. Unfortunately I can't get more than halfway through it. The eggs are heavy and the toppings taste like they've been sitting out for awhile. Well, they have, so I don't know what I was expecting. I shove aside the plate. Round two goes to the buffet.

Round Three:
I have to bounce back from my slip up last round. I make my way to the Asian station for Gyoza and War Won Ton Soup hoping to repeat the success of the sushi. Little do I know the soup has been lying in wait like a sleeper cell, ready to pounce on my tastebuds in a flavor explosion. It is far and away the best thing the buffet has to offer. I sneak another bowl as a victory lap. I win round three.

Round Four:
I'm starting to feel the pressure of fullness creeping in, so I decide to take it easy this round. I slide to the salad bar for something light, grabbing a bowl and stuffing it with a generous scoop of every topping. After drizzling it with a glob of dressing, I shove this Frankenstein's monster of a salad into my face. Surprisingly it makes me super full. But it's lettuce, right? Oh well. I call this round a draw.

Round Five:
In a surprising lack of judgment I decide to finish with something very stupid. I stroll over to the carving station. ""Prime rib please."" They slap a huge slab of dead cow on my plate and I scoop a mountain of mashed potatoes on the side with green beans. I don't know why I thought this would go well. I graze my way through the salty side of beef and do my best to put the potatoes away, but it's a losing battle at this point. Stomach at the edge of bursting, I shove aside the plate and raise my white flag. You win this one, buffet.

The verdict:
Who even cares? It's $30 for all-you-can-eat (and drink of you only want beer or wine). The options aren't that great, but if you're like me and get blasted on wine first, you won't notice. 3 stars.",t8fvVCHu_Q-gdjAXMJXm3g,2,0,3,K8NUwQjTp_ls_I8eE-lDTA

The pasta was very very good. Other than that, I honestly am not a huge buffet person. Something with quality drops off when food is sold in limit-less quantities. My friend had an insatiable craving for crab, so that's what brought us to a buffet at all. She thoroughly enjoyed it, but that was pretty much all she ate. I had a few of the other offerings like the Mexican food and the Asian food, and they were both just ok. The baked deserts including cookies were just average, and all 3 of us in my party agreed to that. What I did like was the gelato and sorbet machine. At least that made my walk to the dessert area worthy.

They have a nice cheese and smorgsboard of ingredients for a picnic. 

The bad:
Tri-bean salad: no flavour tasted like mush.
Seafood buns: the dough sticks to the tongs, mushy and the meat was tough. 
Sushi: some of the worst delivery and serving spoons-tongs are a nuisance to use it was obvious by all the dropped sushi.
Cranberry juice: was watered down by some filter malfunction or the syrup was just low. 
Clam chowder was not marked with bacon or ham. Misleading for vegetarians. 
The okra was boiled to death and had no flavour. 
They do not have forks at the dessert bar. 
There are not enough tongs for the desserts so cross contamination of chocolate and nuts could occur.
Wipes after eating crab are not provided. 
The chairs and tables are hideous and uncomfortable. 

The ugly:

What I enjoyed:
 omelet station- I like being able to pick what is in my omelet.   I do suggest that they put omlete toppings somewhere visible so people know what the options are or at least put up a sign/ menubof choices.   

1/2 of my bloody Marys.    The first and last ones ordered was just from a mix and just tasted like tomato,  the others the bar tender put mix and vodka 

The seafood soup-tomoato based.   I had clams,  muscles,  squid and a nice broth.   

Oysters were good

Salad bar- cute bowls... I just suggest they work on the order of getting items.   Most people make their salads by putting lettuce,  toppings then dressing.   Having the dressings in the middle causes lots of akward bumping around.   

Chicken fried steak is good,  but the gravy needs work.   It taste like the flour hasn't been cooked through  so not so pleasant. 

The meat and cheese station had a good selection... But no bagles to go with the lox 

Nice big beverage section,  not sure if it is too big

Granted I did not eat everything

What needs work,  besides what was mentioned above

Breakfast items,  scattered all over the place.   It would be nice if they were put together more.   

Scrambled eggs looked unappealing ..i didn't get them,  but while standing in line for an omelet another lady showed her friend and it did look like tofu and were wiggly.  

Sushi rice is hard,  taste like store bought.

We were with friends who can't stand buffet's and we had to really sell them on the idea, especially at $25. We were all staying at The Mirage and have never tried their buffet, so in we went. The wife and I were excited when we saw the variety from a distance, but when we got closer, were really surprised at how little food there was. On top of that, the food was terrible! I almost broke my tooth on the stale pot stickers. The prime rib was cold and flavorless. The guy who makes your salad reminded us a lot of 'The Soup Nazi' from Seinfeld. It literally took our server 15 minutes to get a diet Roy Rogers (Diet Coke with Grenadine). I am a HUGE dessert fan and this place really was a joke. They must be spending our $25 on the dolphin exhibit, cause it isn't being spent on good food. They should fire their food prep people and get a new decorator. The booth seat I was in felt like I was leaning against a wall. We came in around 4 pm, which is between lunch and dinner, but they had just started their dinner service so shouldn't the food have been fresh and hot?",vAeQ2vhNFOIif9q4_pq2sA,0,0,1,BEzZ1d3FBZVNXNzSA-JTfg

5115228,2009-04-13,2,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"This used to be my favorite buffet in Vegas many years ago, so I decided to give it a try this past Sunday, and I was very disappointed! 

Following are the reasons why: 

1. $30 per person for brunch?!(Easter Weekend) 

2. Our hostess was arguing loudly with the front personnel all the way to our table, over the head phone. 

3. Although there were many stations(Carvings, Noodle, Raw Bar, Salad, Omelet Bar, Latin, Pasta, Dessert etc.) but nothing looked appetizing, some items even looked like they were defrosted from pre-made frozen packages. 

4. Low Quality Foods: The Crab legs were still frozen, the hand rolls weren't made to order, and looked stale. I had them made a crepe for me, and it was the worst soggy, oily, oddly shaped crepe I've ever had! The wonton noodle soup was very bland, and the wonton was way over cooked with unknown filling. They've donuts and muffins at their dessert bar....am I at Home Town Buffet? why would anyone want to spent this much money for donuts & muffins?? 

The only pleasant experience I had was our waitress, who was friendly and attentive, and the prime rib was tasty. Other than that, Cravings really need to step up in order for people wanting to crave it!!",UHhCOW58UTDbNlnpHCBmzg,2,0,2,Z0LA5ImCQfyTOZ9j6icaFg
5121671,2011-02-19,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"I was a bit hesitant at trying out Cravings after reading some of these reviews. However, our stay in Las Vegas was this time with the Mirage, so we ended up going to Cravings after all.  We went there for lunch and paid 18.50 per person, which is an ok price.  Unless you're looking to go to McDonalds or another fast food chain restaurant, that's about the price you'll end up paying per person for a decent meal anywhere around here, so it wasn't too daunting.
I ended up giving Cravings 3 stars, based on my findings below.

First of all, service was excellent.  I'd rate it 5 stars if I could separate service & food stars.  Our drinks were always filled, in fact, most of the time we'd barely emptied half our glasses before the waitress/attendant came and topped off the drink.  Also, our plates were promptly cleaned up once we were done with a course, and the waitresses/waiters & greeters were VERY friendly.  
So kudos to the staff @ Cravings, keep up the good work.

Let's move on to what we're here for.... food!  I think the easiest way to rate and comment on this would be station by station.

Mexican/Latin Foods - very disappointing.  In fact, my husband even asked if there truly was a Mexican chef there or if they'd hired a British chef to handle the Latin food.  (No offense to British chefs out there that are good at all types of cuisines.... he was just playing off stereotypes, obviously.... Gordon Ramsay probably cooks better Mexican food than any Latin chef out there ;-))
ANYWAY, the plantains - huge disappointment. I love plantains, I was very excited to see them but the taste was off.  The enchiladas were not very good either, and I didn't attempt the taco fixings but I'm assuming those were ok since theres not much to prepare in way of cooking those...

BBQ - fairly tasty! :-)  They redeem themselves some!! I had a wonderful veal brisket with a tangy BBQ sauce on the side.  The sweet potato salad w/spicy mustard was also good.   They had a cornbread ""pie"" which was awesome, very smooth, and their BBQ beans were great.  I'm definitely a fan of the BBQ section of ""Cravings"".

Carving Station - Two thumbs up!! I had the thickest, juciest slices of turkey on my plate and they were not cheap on the servings, I was a very happy camper while endulging in the delights of the carving station.

Chinese - Meh.  Middle of the road, not a big selection of good stuff, but enough to satisfy any craving for Asian foods.  Nice eggrolls.

Sushi - I'll have to rely on my husband for this review as I'm not a big fan of sushi.  He said it was great, he complemented the Sushi chefs... the sushi were just the right size and they had a good variety.

Salad bar - Awesome! Great selection of fresh cold cuts! 

Fishmonger/Raw bar - no comment, didn't visit those so I can't judge, however the selection was not very good and whatever they had there, didn't look too tempting....

Italian - Middle of the road, ok selection of pizzas.

Dessert -  Pretty tasty.  Best Napoleon Cake I've tasted in a long time! Also their chocolate mousse was fantastic, with chunks of chocolate bites in there, and the bread pudding was also very good.  Nice selection of sugar free desserts as well, and they tasted good... not ""sugar free""

All in all though, I must say you can find better buffets in Vegas for less... I probably won't be choosing Cravings in the future.",MpJfcgUY6gz7TY1yK5u7Qw,1,0,3,poHvN4cFyB6mNdVbe6SZVQ

Typically I stay at the Mirage when I Vegas and so I try to slip into the Cravings for breakfast.  I would not say anything is gourmet or jaw dropping, but you can put together almost any breakfast you can imagine reasonably enough.  

Unfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of the breakfast is the lame 80's era hotel coffee.  Mirage -- you don't have to serve Starbucks.  Go to a local Panera or Einsteins Bagels to get an idea of what you should be serving.  Something smooth with some flavor.  Not bland weak nothingness.   You should be embarrassed at this point.

I've read other reviews that indicate this buffet used to rule Las Vegas.  I'm not really convinced any buffet can rule much of anything.  I tried to over-rated Wynn buffet and the far superior Paris buffet and I'm simply not sold on the idea that any buffet can challenge a reasonably good restaurant.  But that's not why buffets are in Vegas.  They are there to offer cheap fast eats.  They are cafeterias with delusions of grandeur.

The Cravings is a decent 'cafeteria' if you will.  The sushi lacks fish, the shrimp is plump and bottomless, the coffee (again) sucks, and they'll toss you a tasty salad of your dreams.  Like I said, it's OK... for a buffet.

The Mirage has been good about updating itself and I think it's time my favorite affordable resort re-invent the buffet.  Scrap the silly name.  Pull the Studio 54 gold and mirrors out of the interior.  

I'm hearing good things about what the Cosmopolitan is doing it.  Take what works and fix what doesn't over there, bring it to the Mirage.  Charge higher prices to people walkin' in off the street but give resort guests a bold discount -- and name said discount as a benefit of the resort fee.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,1,0,3,rv1jGX3It9thJ7SgfjLxTA

Food: SO MUCH FOOD. The food wrapped around the whole room and it seemed to be endless. So many different food stations. As with all buffets, there was a crab leg section but no lame shortages here, it always seemed to be full of crab legs and no super long lines for it. When I do buffets I like to take a small bite out of every dish, and even doing this I couldn't eat everything I wanted because there was just too much food. Everything tastes fresh and delicious too. And finally there was FREE beer and wine. Not just cheap beer either, it was a house IPA, Heineken, and some other beer that I can't remember; probably because i had too many IPAs and Heinekens. 

Place: Upscale, clean, and tons of space. Plenty of room around you to eat and not feel like anyone near you is judging you.

- We came around 8pm, which was a great time for us because we didn't have to wait in line for a while. There was just 1 couple ahead of us. I thought that was pretty good for a Saturday night. It took less than 10min for us to be seated at our table. 
- I suggest starting off with the shrimp cocktails and crab legs. The line can get pretty long, but if you time it right, your meal will start off great. The shrimp cocktails are pretty big too compared to Feast Buffet. Crab legs not as meaty as Bellagio. 
- Their wanton soup was pretty good but not as good as the Rio Carnival World. 
- Prime rib was average like any other buffet like Feast, but there is no grill if you wanted it Med-well or well done like Sam's Town. 
- I did enjoy their seafood stew. It had a lot of scallop and clams in it, less small shell bits, few corn. 
- Avoid the steamed cod. It was a bit tough and flavorless. 
- Do mack on the BBQ spare ribs! It was tender and so saucy! I loved it. It was especially tasty with the creamed corn. I love corn! :D nom nom
- The sushi was filler for me so after a few, I didn't bother getting more
- Their dim sum was pretty good. I suggest that you should at least grab one of each. Don't get the Ramen though. The noodle tasted like Maruchan. meehhhhh! But I did really like the egg! 
- I don't care much for the desserts, but my girlfriend thought it was worth trying. Don't expect to find macarons here though!

       - Crab Legs - The crab legs were split and dry. The shell side was brown on most of them and it seemed like they were sitting there for way too long (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw?select=YdVxZbw2SodAIWfmfwnbRw).
       - Deserts - The dessert selection was minimal and wasn't very good.

       - I wouldn't recommend this place. Stations has a better buffet for a cheaper price. If you're going for the higher priced items, Bellagio is a way better choice.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,0,2,0gCEEOPXvmBZqUP31hBw1w

Attractive entrance and lettering going into the restaurant with not much of a queue. 

Before anything else, I must mention that the service was excellent. Really go out of your way stuff. When they asked which juice, I asked for pineapple which they got from the room service section. Twice.  Enough to make me double my usual tip to the servers to a massive $2. 
( enough people come to the buffet leaving nothing making me look like one of the last BSD's.)

The food itself is fair with special mention being made of the positive: excellent croissants, omelette station and proper pork sausages. 

Negative is having to ask for yoghurt to be served, the croissants being in a refrigerated section ( which they will heat up on asking) and a slightly weird eggs Benedict. Bacon was so so and coffee was okay, but plentiful.
Also no real obvious toast.

My friends and I came for Sunday brunch for $36/person. Not sure if there are different prices for brunch and dinner, but brunch ends at 3pm. There's also free beer/wine until 3pm. We came exactly at 3pm though so technically we missed that, but our hostess still told us that beer/wine was free, although we didn't end up having any.

There's a decent selection of food, but nothing's really great. Honestly, my friends and I thought the best thing we had were the veggies... Your $40 would be better spent at a nice restaurant instead. 

HITS: broccoli (Italian), BBQ ribs and sauteed cabbage (American), crab legs and shrimp (fishmonger), bread pudding (dessert)

Overall, meats and fish were generally dry. Sushi and Asian food was terrible.

* AMERICAN
BBQ ribs were actually pretty good as long as you found a tender piece. Otherwise, the sauce was still good but dry meat was not worth eating. Same thing with the grilled flank steak - go for the tender, medium rare if you can find a slice. Sauteed cabbage was pretty good.

* LATIN AMERICAN
I only tried the Cajun chicken here, parts of which were okay, but mostly it was pretty dry. There's also chips and guac/salsa and some other things.

* ASIAN
Noodles, stir fry, seafood bun, spring rolls, potstickers, etc. I'd skip everything in this section

* SUSHI
I'd skip the sushi too. The fish in the rolls and nigiri wasn't very fresh and the rice was hard. 

* FISHMONGER
Probably your best bet here and where you'd get your money's worth. Crab legs and shrimp were pretty fresh.

* ITALIAN
The broccoli here was unanimously the best thing my group had (sadly). The pizza wasn't bad, but I'd skip the meats and fish. 

* CARVING
There was prime rib, portuguese sausage and turkey at the carving station. The prime rib was kind of inconsistent. I got an okay slice but some people got really dry parts. The portuguese sausage wasn't bad. There was also salmon (dry) and mac and cheese (solid) and some other things like mashed potatoes that I didn't try. 

* SALAD
Very simple salad options, bread (avoid please) and Italian meats like salami and ham.

* DESSERTS
Lots of options, including some sugar-free ones: cakes, cupcakes, bars, cookies, bread pudding, fruit, soft service ice cream/sorbet, etc. The cakes/cupcakes were pretty dry, the cookies were hard as rocks (how long ago were they made??), and fruit was rather acidic. Soft serve/sorbet was decent. The only thing I really liked here was their bread pudding, but make sure you get a freshly made batch of it.

There's also the CHEF'S KITCHEN, where they make you fresh pasta, but I didn't try any because I'm not really a pasta person.",ofZzcj1oiHS64f7jbGCXxQ,6,2,2,5V77lJ8xvQ6aq9jU3et4Pg
5407953,2015-01-06,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"Here's another buffet that I've been to on a few different occasions, but I've forgotten to write a review.  The Cravings Buffet at Mirage is certainly not a fancy buffet, but it works in a pinch.  It works even better if you can get it for free, or at a discounted price.  My wife and I used a MyVegas reward and got 2 free buffets to use at Cravings.  Now, I'm thankful that the meal was free, because had I paid full price I don't really feel like it would have been worth it, at least this time.

This buffet certainly has a lot of options, it's just that a lot of the food is mediocre.  We came here for lunch, and they still had their homemade omelette station going, so I nabbed one of those.  I enjoyed the omelette, but was having a tough time finding other options that interested me.  They do have a self-service drink station now, which consists of one of those fancy new coke machines.  You can also get coffee, milk, juice, etc.  Or, you can get free beer or wine, but the selection is limited.

I feel bad for the servers at this buffet, because they are essentially glorified buss boys.  All they did was clear a few of the plates off the table once, and then we never really saw them again.  It's kind of a pain to walk all the way to the other side of the room every time you need a refill.  No service=No tip.

I guess the thing that bugged me the most was their dessert station.  It was noon and they still had several of their breakfast items out there.  Sorry, but I'm not interested in donuts that have been sitting there for a few hours for dessert.  Many of the cupcakes offered were dry, and the creme brulee was subpar at best.  Also, they took away the homemade gelato and replaced it with ice cream machines.  Seriously??  What an awful substitute!

Anyway, I don't want to be too hard on this buffet, because it was free.  That said, I'm not sure that I'll be ""craving"" this place anytime soon.",MpQ8K-NFcIB1gvNUwnAYgQ,3,2,3,kQ-QhfSe9v0hmcsWTAvvKw
5410342,2009-07-28,1,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"I enjoyed this place. It's $5 cheaper than the Bellagio lunch buffet, and it was comparable in taste. Honestly, I don't know why everyone pees all over themselves when talking about the Bellagio buffet. If you don't consider the champagne included with brunch, it's not that fabulous.

I ate too much food, I don't remember everything that I ate. The sushi wasn't inviting (but sushi at a Las Vegas buffet is usually something to be avoided anyway). The prime rib was tasty (and also the first thing I went for). The most notable thing though, was the vanilla gelato. I nearly died at first bite. They must have put a gallon of egg yolks in it, because it was DELICIOUS. I have never had vanilla gelato quite like that, and I will likely never have it anywhere else. I would seriously pay the $16 or so just to have unlimited vanilla gelato. I am quite sad I didn't know the gelato was there to begin with, otherwise I would have just eaten that for all of lunch.",aKAGlmoKsgnQ8Avh86-SOg,1,1,4,as8DL1KAmZsyyGfwvF65nA

The service here is excellent and the floor is very clean and well maintained compared to other strip buffets. My favorite part of the buffet is the seafood section because I'm such a huge fan of the big shrimp cocktail and the king crab legs!! 

Mmm mm TASTY!!...

The sushi section offers 4 different kinds of handrolls (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail and Scallops), and 3 different kinds of Japanese salad, Soybeans, cut rolls and miso soup.

Meat section offers Turkey, Roast Beef, Prime Rib, Barbeque and other stuff. Then they have the Mexican, Italian and deli areas but the section that needs some work is the dessert section because you have to squeeze in between the dessert island and the cake shelf if there are other guests grabbing dessert and it just feels so cramped. 

Another thing that bothers me is the section between the seafood and Mexican food because you'd have to walk across a small part of the dining hall to get to the other section and I think it would be better if they extended the tile connecting both stations rather then walking on the carpet. 

Like the other Yelpers said it feels like eating in a cafeteria and I do agree with them. The breakfast buffet was actually excellent but pricey (Vegas strip price) and the omelet was a hit with my eggs cooked to perfection. 

Just delicious!

I would definitely eat here again bit if you want to save some money, go to the buffet and 1 - 2 Hours before lunch or dinner starts to avoid paying the full price.

The presentation at this place is pretty cool. They have fish tanks with fishes swimming around over the raw fish section. LOTS of carving stations and make your own stuff. There is an entire selection just for salad where they will make you any salad you want! There is, of course, all the sections one would expect from a buffet: Chinese, Sushi, Fish, Italian, Mongolian, Rotisserie, Mexican... 

The most interesting thing about this place: the variety of foods. Normally when one sees an Italian section, what does one expect? Pizza, lasagna, generic pasta, right? Well, at Cravings, you get one or two generic buffet items, but then you get two or three very unique items that I have never seen at a buffet before. the Italian section had rack of lamb and garlic parmesan chicken. The Mexican section had fajitas, posole, and even some weird looking sauce / soup thing that I had never heard of before. The Chinese section did not have gross Panda Express food, it had szechuan beef, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, and a chicken dish authentic to China. How cool is that? 

The dessert selection is enormous and they have two entire shelves of sugar free items for diabetics. Thumbs up! Now I can stuff my face with food and control my blood sugar with sugar free dessert. They also had fruit, mini chocolate and banana cream pies, fresh chocolate chip cookies, and slices of every kind of pie and cake you can imagine. 

I knock off two stars for a couple of reasons. One, it is pricey ($18.95 plus tax for brunch) and two, the unique food selections force you to be adventurous. Sometimes trying new foods is not a good experience.

This is what I expect from a typical Vegas buffett.  Of the three I visited on this trip, this one offered the most variety; however the food was only average at best.  Funny enough, I find most Asian cuisine to be sub-par in most buffetts; however their Asian food was actually decent.  If you drink, then this buffett is for you with unlimited beer and wine.  They offer a huge variety of dessert, but nothing good enough to go back for seconds.  I had a food credit with my room, so it was basically free, but I am not sure I would intentionally return as there are so many buffets in Vegas.",gfR80SvOyWL45S8vPMZxNw,9,11,2,l2llI7sjERr4p0eMvkKtMg

They have a self-serve beverage station and I think I'd much rather prefer to help myself to drinks rather than having to wait around for someone to refill mine.

Unfortunately Cravings' shortcoming is their lack of selection. After my second plate, I found myself going back to what I liked the first time. Not all of the stations were attended to and some of the staff behind the different stations weren't exactly rude, but they weren't all that nice either.

If you absolutely need to finish off your meal with sweets, then you should definitely check out their desserts. I'm not a big fan of dessert especially at buffets because they're usually stale. However, I found myself eating macaroons one after another.

5541551,2010-09-08,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"""Are we really going to do this?""  LOL...this was my fiance and I at about 1:30PM on Sunday morning (well afternoon I guess, but it felt like morning).

After an incredible ""Vegas style"" Saturday night - all we knew was we were still tired, and still starving from the night before.  We also knew we had to get up eventually.  How were we going to combat this beer hangover?  How about mass quantities of food.

Let me preface by saying - we aren't the buffet types AT ALL.  If we're going to spend money on food, we go for quality over quantity. We'd find it much easier to spend $100 on a sushi dinner, or an amazing Chinese banquet, than a buffet.  But again, my yelp research had led me to Cravings.  Not because it's the best.  Not because it's the cheapest. But because of it's Asian selection.  We knew we were in Vegas.  We knew we needed a ton of food.  But we also knew we needed Asian.  And it needed to be fast.  We were in no condition to wait in a massive line.  And it needed to be on the strip.  What the heck - Cravings it is!

We got to the Mirage at about 2PM, (let me also tell you that the strip anytime on the weekends is a PARKING lot.  We did not take Las Vegas Blvd once while we were there).  We found a spot by the elevators to the Mirage and entered the tropical paradise.  I already began feeling better (it HAS to be the casino air) - and the beautiful gardens really helped brighten the mood.  But this is not a review of the Mirage.

We walked through the gardens and casino, passed the Cirque Du Soleil Revolution Theater and Lounge (looked SOO cool, if only there was more time)...passed Kokomo's Steak House...Passed Japonais...and finally, we made it to  Cravings!  It was seriously like a light shone from above on the restaurant sign.  It was at the end of the casino (really..NOT that far of a walk, just REALLY far when you're still hungover and starved).  The BEST thing EVER was seeing that, there was NO line.  Seriously - none.  I had read horror stories about two hour lines at Bellagio, and wasn't about to have it.  This was perfect for us.

Cost for Sunday brunch with Champagne with tax was only $56.10 for two!  That included bottomless mimosas/champagne and soft drinks/coffee. Okay, that may seem like a lot - but REALLY, when you consider your dining options on the strip - you can either go fast food cheap, and settle for McDonald's or Panda Express, you could go fine dining and pay $100 for lunch, or you could do a buffet - which includes champagne.  We were happy with our decision.

Service was great for us - although, I CAN see where other yelpers may have had issues with this.  We were very lucky - we started off with a subpar server, but during the brunch/dinner shift change, we were replaced with a wonderful server who always kept our glasses full (trust me - my fiance probably consumed 10 iced teas in 20 minutes) and my champagne always full.  Champagne was a nice touch (even though I had complained of a hangover only ten minutes before).

Onto the food.  REALLY - the ONLY reason you should come here is if you like Asian food.  Seriously - I don't think this buffet would appeal to customers who do not like Asian food.  There is a section called ""Noodles"" that serves shumai, steamed pork buns, and potstickers, reminiscent of dim sum.  At that same station you can order beef and meatball pho, wonton noodle soup, and many other varieties of soup and dishes.  And then next to that is a ""chinese"" section that has noodles, rice, congee, and a variety of other Chinese dishes.  And next to that is a Japanese section (with a very small variety of sushi and to be honest, not really good sushi).  But they do have miso soup which is soo soothing.

The pho is good (not the best broth ever) but it does the trick!  The wonton noodle soup was really good, and the congee as well.  We must've loaded up on all of the soups.  The shumai is okay - it just depends on when you go.  It was a bit chewy but when they put out a super fresh batch and it was fine.  

All in all a very pleasant experience.  So much so we went back for dinner the following night.  No champagne - but the same price - $56.10 for two - not bad for dinner!  And the variety was better - singapore noodles, shrimp and veggies.  And their prime rib was amazing.  Seriously soo tender.  

I would highly recommend this buffet if you like Asian food.  And their ""carving"" station is good too.  My fiance sampled the crab legs and said they seemed frozen and salty.  We only stuck to Asian, soups, and meat.  We didn't even hit dessert!

You get what you pay for - and you ARE at a buffet.  I wasn't expecting New York Chinatown or SF Chinatown quality food, but it was a wonderful variety (and yes - there were Asians cooking behind the stations!)  Haha.  If you're looking for a reasonable buffet with NO lines I'd definitely stop here.

While it was decent, we probably could have gotten a better breakfast somewhere else for the $18.99 per person we spent at Cravings.

Nice thing was it wasn't crowded.  Only two people ahead of us in line, so we got seated really quickly and off to the buffet we went.  Lots of the traditional offerings, but none of them great.  Bacon was okay, sausage was bad, hash browns pretty tasteless, eggs benedict got points for eggs with yolks that were actually runny, but points off for being otherwise bland.  Breakfast burritos tasted decent, but had been sitting out in the warmer tray way too long.  Ham carving was outstanding the first time - moist and flavorful.  So good I went back for a second piece, which this time was dry, tough, and lacking in taste.  Smoked salmon was pretty good, but with about 20 minutes to go before lunch, they had taken all the bagels away.  Scrambled eggs were disgusting - definitely powdered, and swimming in water.  The lady got an omelet and said it was good, but the line was just too long for me to make an attempt.

Beverage selection was decent, and the coffee was good.  I wasn't sure if beer and wine were included for breakfast, and wondered who would drink at breakfast anyway.  Then I saw someone from the table across from us come back with two beers and announce that they were free.  Immediately, the rest of the party gets up and comes back, each with two beers of their own.  I forgot - this is Vegas!",f4UOzbbwydfhqOic1PKYvg,4,0,2,1fREt30vkAXmX8KYPL0n2g

They have a decent variety of foods and a small selection of unlimited beer & wine (at the bar) included w/ the bill. The atmosphere is bright, and I do appreciate their presentation of the food instead of industrial size metal trays. Drinks are self serve.

PROS:
Their made to order pasta station was a standout of the night (possibly because it was actually hot), but I would ask for a smaller portion so you don't fill up on pasta. A sign with a list of ingredients would be nice so I don't have to shout over the stove to the chef. Also loved the caprese salad.

CONS:
I do not recommend their sushi (rice was hard and dry), but try it for yourself. Food can definitely be served hotter; it was cold by the time I got to my seat. I was in the mood for soup, but had a hard time finding them as they are scattered all over the restaurant. 

Come early for dinner so you don't miss out on any of the foods. Buffet stops seating at 9 PM, but start taking away the food at 9:30 PM. By the time I got to the dessert, all the selections were gone as they were no longer replenishing. Any recommendations for a buffet that opens late??

They have all the food divided into types of cuisine ( Mexican, Italian, Asian). All of the food was a half assed effort at what it should have been. The ""Mexican"" was just warmed up nacho cheese out of a can , tortilla chips and some other nonsense. The ""sushi"" just wasn't. The pizza had no flavor. The salad bar lacked the most basic toppings. The dessert section looked like they robbed a Kroger bakery for its day old goods.

Random thoughts.
- The sushi is pretty lame. It clearly comes out of a machine, gross. The temaki is OK but like all temaki it is 99% rice and 1% fish.
- Delicious prime rib. It is arguably better than the stuff at the Bellagio, which I found to be dry and flavorless. They also have actual (non-creamy) horseradish, which I appreciate deeply.
- GREAT gelato - but the guy was giving everyone the evil eye, I don't know why. I won't hold it against the place.

It's not surprising that sometimes the mediocre outnumber the quality; however, if you're lucky enough you can find those diamonds in the rough. Cravings Buffet is luckily one of them. 

WHAT? WHY?!

You might be wondering why I would choose such a poorly rated buffet as a possible diamond in Las Vegas. Well, there are several reasons for this. 

1. If you go to one of those Tix 4 Tonight kiosks you can actually get discounted pricing to eat at this buffet. Now, it might not be a huge discount but for 20% to 30% off on your dining, especially at a buffet, it's a good deal. 

2. Additionally, if you decide to take advantage of the Buffet of Buffets which is the 24 hour buffet pass for any Caesars' owned buffet this is one of those restaurants you'll want to visit.

3. If for nothing else the carving station here has some wonderful meats. I'm talking about tri tip, prime rib, and brisket. These aren't novel in any way compared to what you can find at other buffets but from my experience I noticed that the quality was much higher than many other buffets that you find of this rating and tier. For this reason alone you can sustain yourself and rationalize spending $20-$25 at this buffet.

Conclusion

People will always rave and talk about how wonderful the buffets like Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon are but when you can find true quality in the lower rated buffets, that's when you feel like you found real value. Cravings is one of those buffets found in The Mirage, a beautiful hotel and casino even to this day.

I was just happy that I didn't have to pay extra for shrimp and cocktail sauce. And I was very surprised to see dim sum at 8 pm or so at night, but hey, it was delicious! And most of everything else I had, except for a view pieces of steak that were hecka dry and a hand roll that said there was some kind of fish in it but had nothing but some rice and veggies, it was quite alright. And I was very sad that the bar cost extra...[wipes tear away] Wish there had been more desserts to choose from, I didn't even see cheesecake, cupcakes, or cookies.

Carving station had a very delicious prime rib, and a juicy turkey. Good mashed potatoes.  If you time it right, you can go to a later breakfast and catch the carving station with both breakfast & lunch dinner  meats (eg.  apple wood smoked bacon and ham, then switch to brunch/lunch meats like prime rib). 

The ""Americana"" station had crispy onion rings; pizza was also surprisingly good. 

Husband liked the hot steamed crab legs with all the trimmings. 

For those who want to know, there is an ""Asian"" themed section with soups, stir fries, sushi etc., there's a salad bar, and antipasto type area with cheeses, lunch meat, hummus etc.

The chefs station sautéed in front of you things like shrimp with Alfredo sauce; for breakfast, this becomes an omelette/eggs cooked to order station which is also delicious. 

Pancakes, French toast were great. 

Endless soda, lemonade and sparkling non alcoholic beverage options.

Cravings buffet at Mirage disappointed me. They are famous for their 11 international cooking stations, and 150+ self serving soft drinks. The stations includes carvings (prime rib); seafood (crab legs, seafood stew); chef station(fresh cooked pasta); Chinese; Japanese; Mexican; salad bar; cheese bar; dessert. The other 2, American and Latin, were closed today!!!! Each station includes roughly 5-10 dishes, not a lot of selection. Food was sub par, poor quality and slow turnover rate. The prime rib was pretty great, snow crab legs were not bad. Apart from that everything else was quite low quality. Dessert section wasn't fancy, but the bread pudding, creme brûlée, oatmeal raisin cookies were all pretty good.

July of 2016: Mirage Buffet. Our family of eight arrives at the front of the line. We were told there would be an additional fee if we were to be sat at the same table.

PRO-Tip - Ask to sit in the back near the bar this will put you in the center and you have quick access food and easy access to refills. They have some alcoholic drinks for free, wine , chardonnay  I was all about the free orange juice, it was delicious!  The cuts of meats are enormous so if you don't want your whole plat covered in meat, make sure to ask for a petite slice.   This is one of the few buffets where I can easily spend an hour just nibbling on cheese and having some breads, you are going to love this buffet if you like choice but don't get too excited about the desserts selection area, it looks nice but selection is low, but they always have the ice creams and bread puddings and warm sweet breads, I'm all about the cheese area , they have a good selection.

5835362,2010-02-22,0,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"I am a fan of Cravings.  I have been there several times before and have enjoyed my experience.  With that being said, I gave it 3 stars based on my most recent visit (2/20/10).  I don't know if it was because the last couple of times I went there I was starving or if the food really was good, but compared to my previous visits this time was a bummer.

The buffet is set up with several different stations resembling regions in cuisines.  There's Italian, Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, Fishmonger (fish), Japanese, soups, salads, sandwich, and desserts.  The Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, and Japanese are usually good.  

This trip I had Carving, Fish, Chinese and Japanese.  At the Carving station I had Prime Rib w/ Au Jus sauce, mashed potatoes, and herb-roasted potatoes.  At the Fish station I tried the grilled cod.  At the Chinese I tried their various forms of shu mai (w/ shrimp and pork), fried rice, chow mein, and sweet & sour pork.  And at the Japanese station I tried their sushi.  There were some high points and some low points...

+ = prime rib was rare and juicy (the way I like it), the shu mai (especially the shrimp) was excellent, the sweet & sour pork was tender with just the right kick of sweet and sour, the deep fried salmon hand roll was a surprise because of the crunchiness of the deep fried salmon, DESSERT STATION!

- = the fried rice was overcooked, it was hard and bland, the sushi station was kind of pathetic

Bottom Line = Like I said before, I am a fan and will most definitely try this buffet again, however, this most recent trip was not as memorable.  I think the best part of the meal/buffet was the dessert station.  I loved that they serve gelato ice cream.  Very creamy and tasty.  They also had this simple chocolate mousse between pastry layers that was also delish.",OvE3k6sH_mNJE6GLhXaV3g,0,1,3,4zNGx5QB9CeLfjaKwdoPWQ

The Bad: Quality of food that was sitting around was not great.

The Review: I remember going here awhile back and loving my experience. This time I was left very disappointed. The first thing we did after we landed on Sunday morning was eat at this buffet. I loooooove breakfast buffets so I was happy to see we made it in time for the brunch hour. The place wasn't very packed so lines weren't an issue (as they typically are for dinner). My first order of business was to get a nice omelette...it did not disappoint.  The placement of the usual side dishes you'd find with breakfast and the quality did disappoint, however. The hashbrowns were in the Latin section, the bacon was in the carving area. The hasbrowns had no taste, and felt like they've been sitting out for awhile.

Second order of business was to get a nice prime rib, this did not disappoint.

Then I finished my time at the deli section with an assortment of sliced meats, smoked salmon, and cheese and crackers. This was pretty good as well...hmm I started this review at 2 stars, but I think I just talked myself into giving it 3.

I went to the crab table a few times and they never refilled it with more. It was left with scrap of nothing. They ran out of prime rib too. My Dad spoke with the Manager to let him know that there was not enough time and food left out on the floor. He said if we're not full at the end to let him know. He will give us a discount on the next visit. My daddy was not happy with the poor response from him. Food was all cleared out in 20 mins and manager came to our table treating us like we ate for free. He told us we're closed and told us to take exit and pointed to the way for us to leave.

Cravings is a good choice when it comes to ""budget"" buffeting! It's probably a good 10-15 bucks cheaper than your Bellagio Buffets (I'm sorry I don't keep track of dough when I'm ballin' it up in Vegas ;)

Anyways, even though the buffet isn't as large as some of the other ones on the strip, it's got your basic fundamentals.

The shrimp, crab and prime rib are all there so that's really all you need!

The decor is decent.. it's got a bunch of LCDs while you're waiting in line.  The ingredients look so fresh and it makes me, oh, so hungry!

What I don't particularly like about the dining area is that it feels too meshed together... you got the buffet lining around the outside of the seating area... which kinda makes seating area efficient but boring... doesn't really scream VEGAS.

Absolutely horrendous
I had gotten the stomach operation which we had required me to only have liquids and I try to explain that to the cashier
Now I was with a big party
And they all wanted to eat here for some lame disgusting reason
I'm not a buffet person and never have been so I pull out my card that proves that I had had a bariatric surgery it was basically a medical excuse for me to be charged a child's portion
 Either way I couldn't have anything anyway I just wanted to be with my friends

So as the cashier is declining my request she calls a manager and it was this female older lady and I tell her the issue with me and my bariatric surgery so she said that even though I'm only containing liquids that that is still food and I still have to pay the adult price. 
My friends were like that is not cool at all. 
My friends had already paid to get in and were standing there waiting for me so I told them forget it it's not even worth it for me to go in or to eat here it's not a big deal
My friends felt bad and said that they would pay for the adult buffet for me which was almost $30 but I really wasn't interested in it at that point. 
I had eaten here once prior when I took another friend of mine from Florida and my son to see the animals and the dolphins. 
I didn't have a problem the first time I had gone in there
But the way that I was treated by the manager and the girl that worked there I was really disgusted. In fact it was because of that issue that I had that afternoon I never ever tell anyone to go there I always say stay away from the buffet at Mirage. 
When I had eaten there prior there was a basic variety of food there was nothing special about it at all. 
I told them that the Wynn buffet was a lot better and we should've went there so what happened was I went and walked around and found clothing stores and bought shoes and clothes while they ate. 
By the time they were done and came out my one friend Tad had said to me ""it kinda sucked, anyway""

Trust me if you're going to go do a buffet there are so many others that are so much better but the treatment that day was pretty horrendous.

The place was really dead. We came at a very off hour hoping to avoid crowds and we successfully did this. The staff was attentive and friendly and we never had to remind them for refills or to clear our plates. The line is kept very clean, which is a must when I visit buffets. They don't have a lot of selection and it's kind of difficult to find some things since everything is spread our so far apart. They take minimalist design to the max. They only have 4 or five dishes to choose from for each type of food, which is a little bit of a letdown. Buffets should be all about selection and they don't have a lot of choices. 

The food was standard. Nothing amazing, but there were a few standouts. I did enjoy the salad bar. They allow you to pick all the ingredients you want and they mix them for you. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The desserts were limited as well. I ended up with macaroons. They were very good. Warm and chewy, definitely another highlight of the evening.

The 2 stars are for one the friendly staff the other because it was pretty clean. (Then again, the food is unimpressive which leads to less customers which in turn means less mess)
My suggestion, not Cravings, I saw an In N Out across the freeway.  For such a beautiful hotel (the Mirage), this is a bad start to the evening.  I hope this doesn't affect my feelings about the show we're going see here later.
I cannot get over how let down I feel.  The Indian Casinos in San Diego are 5 stars in comparison. From decor to size to selections and food (taste in particular) this place doesn't measure up.  I know what happens in Vegas is suppose to stay in Vegas, I got robbed here so I'm telling the web.  I'm a big guy at a buffet and I only had a plate of food, like the serving size my doctor suggests i have 3 times a day, the food was so cold, stale and salty that that one plate is all I had. AT A BUFFET?!? FOR $32! ONE PLATE?? What does it tell you when the only 2nd serving I had was a soft drink? 
To recap my experience at Cravings at the Mirage: selection-Bad, food-bad, staff-friendly&helpful and the place appeared clean. 
Hope your experiences in Vegas are better than this one.",wcl8gjCzSgqXKhnErYATxQ,0,1,2,6b9Gpl7seSqRxEqgkziwrw

Perhaps the single most influential reason for us coming back so many times was Marivell the cashier who we purchased our buffet from. She was so friendly and kind. We had a number of different servers and they all had their unique characteristics but Marivell treated us with respect and kindness. One of the nicest people we interacted with during our stay in Vegas. 

The four stars is because the cost was high. I know it is not the most expensive buffet but it was pricey to say the least. The first breakfast we paid full price which was $41 (ish) before the gratuity. Dinner was almost double that. After that we were able to use myVegas points to purchase 2-for-1 coupons which made the price more reasonable. 

The quality and variety of food was great. So many options and many great tastes. Dinner has even more than breakfast but both have plenty for just about any appetite or desire. Free beer and wine are limitless and included in the price of the buffet. Though I do agree that it is 5 oclock somewhere, I was not up for beer at breakfast though a few others guests were. I did at dinner and also purchased a mixed drink which was made very well. The bartender was nice and much nicer to me since I tipped him rather than demand free beer and grab and dash with it only to return a minute later demanding more still with no tip. That is a gripe on customers not the buffet so I'll leave it at that. 

Good food and pretty spot-on service from the servers and excellent customer service from Marivell.",_9bZB3wnSO4ni2lzT_18Nw,0,0,4,-NnWSFZALy10kUXWTOf0ng

Good:

* The salad station. You mix your bowl and the friendly guy behind the counter will toss your salad. He had all these tricks and it was so fun. The salad tasted great too. Everything were fresh and the raspberry dressing is ohhh yummy.

* Cold shrimps for appetizers are delicious.

* Great selections of Asian food.

* Excellent service.


Bad:

* Cold Crab legs were still frozen. Not good at all.

* Dessert is not their expertise. They are stale and not good. Sweet tomatoes has better cookies than them. Seriously.

Overall, it's a bargain if you have free buffet passes or discount. Paying full price? Go to Wicked Spoon. It will be much better.",wkrFqNxwTEEkG3mJV88Izw,5,3,3,WRZ-WacIwtxowK-v5jo5YQ

The endless champagne, been  and wine is nice too!",snx_U74sATKE_XrZJ6Q6Hw,1,1,5,1l2-pThOHCtEzKPZG4K1Ug
5992860,2017-03-25,4,OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw,"A friend who lived in Vegas for a few years recommended Cravings as your best bang for your buck. Knowing we wanted at least one buffet experience, we decided to give it a go! Brunch buffet with alcohol was around $70 with tax for two people.

We certainly ended up stuffing ourselves. The meats - freshly carved and sausages - were the best part of the buffet. The seafood was fresh but nothing stunning. (There were unlimited crab legs, though!) The breakfast items were ok; I did like the breakfast burrito once I added some guacamole to it. The desserts we tried were good; my favorite was a pistachio mousse bite. (I'm surprised we had room in our stomachs.) Overall, it was a rich meal, though most of that was our own doing, of course.

It was kind of odd, but our bottomless mimosa was constantly filled by our waitress, but the bloody mary had to be filled at the station. Nothing wild about these brunch cocktails, but bottomless is good when you'll be sitting and eating for a long time.

There were lots of bachelor and bachelorette parties here after a night out. Overall, the crowd is great for Vegas people watching.

I'm glad we got to experience a good ol' Vegas buffet, but I wasn't really blown away by this experience. It was truly ""a-ok.""",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,8,6,3,NFUkXcAFJgiJiHBabWuj3Q
