So I told her again and she says ""okay ill have your total ready at the window"" and leaves. I had to call her back again to order a breakfast sandwich.

My fiance and I used to go to Starbucks literally EVERY DAY until their service and quality began to lack big time. We stopped going every day, but still wanted our coffee kick. One morning, my fiance decided to take a walk across the street to check out Beanz Coffee Cafe. 

He was so moved by his experience at Beanz that he called me to tell me how amazing his coffee was and that this was our new coffee place. He even got to sit down, tune their guitar, and play a few songs while enjoying the ambience. 

Their coffee beans are local from Boulder so you know you're not getting some processed crap like other places. They have a multitude of flavors to put in your drink to make every cup a unique experience. Beanz also carries almond milk and for only like 27 cents extra!! Be sure to try the Banana Split Latte... omg.

I'm not sure if he was tired or maybe just a bit socially awkward, but he did not give us satisfactory customer service nor was he friendly.

I have been back here several times and I have even had a Spiced Mocha Frape made with soy. My opinion stills stands as far as the coffee. It's a little weak even when plain black. Service is consistent. 
All visits are from the drive-thru. The Joint (my chiro) is near here so often I stop here before. OH! And they have a punch card :)




This is for a drive-thru experience. This service was a little slow but super friendly.

First time I have been here and I guarantee I will be back!

I ordered a Spiced Mocha medium. I asked if it was like a Mexi and she said they steam nutmeg and cinnamon into the milk. Good thing I asked because I almost forgot that I needed soy milk! Now that would have ruined my day :)

Anyway for about $4.50 (I guess it was no extra charge for the soy? even better :) I received a perfectly blended non fake coffee that had a fragrance of those two spices.

The coffee was a little too mild for me. This was my first trip and I usually like to try their blend plain black before getting flavors because I usually drink it black anyway.

I guess next time I'll get it plain or maybe some plain expresso.

Like I typed before, I will def be back!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,6,4,4,q0lbalpvU-8FwOkGPtPJ-A

I judge my lattes by how much (if any) sugar I have to add to make them drinkable. It should be none and that's how they make them here! Not weak, just not bitter.

Just had a Beanz Slammer which is a shot of espresso, a shot of cream and a shot of flavor served in what else, a shot glass.  Nice kick-start to your morning. The zucchini bread is really tasty too!

The interior is airy and comfortable with sofa chairs and high-top tables, a perfect environment to hang out or get a little work done outside the office. The music is an eclectic selection of the local owners. (I asked.)

They offer Belgian waffles here with extensive toppings to customize your order. They have a separate menu just for that so if you're in the mood for breakfast/dessert, this is definitely a place to check out. 

The main reason why we came here is that they have Happy Hour that consists of $2 medium drinks and $3 large drinks. It's a pretty good deal if you're consistently making daily pitstops to satisfy your caffeine cravings. 

We ordered a Pumpkin Spice latte (off the menu) with almond milk. Im finding it more common for coffee shops to carry almond milk, which I really appreciate since regular milk can be hard on my stomach and soy just gets redundant. The latte wasn't bad, but nothing amazing either. I couldn't tell if it was too sweet but it definitely tasted watered down.

First thoughts? All this seating doesn't really exist. There is so much negative space outside--why not capitalize with a few cafe tables? And there's just a big gaping space in the center where there should be tables for two; if there were a long line, I could see it making sense, but there wasn't so it made how empty this place was so much more obvious. 

First glance at the menu, this is clearly a shop for people who like some coffee with their sugar. Lots of flavor syrups and unique lattes for a sugary concoction with a small dose of java. But that's OK--different strokes for different folks--and maybe that's the ticket to a delightful coffee beverage at Beanz. 

I, on the otherhand, opted for an Americano which I thought would be a safe bet but boy was I wrong. Watery espresso with no crema--none. I can make better drip coffee at home. For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed. 

But maybe my breakfast sandwich would be better? Don't even bother. The bagels, I swear, are Thomas's from the bag. I've had better bagels from the grocery store. The eggs were microwaved (gross) and the cheese was just processed yellow Kraft Singles.

And comfy overstuffed leather chairs/beautifully-stained wooden bistro chairs and tables! And superior hand-made coffee drinks! :-) 

You might just think this is + the + best place to get a cuppa joe. They also have really good smoothies. My favorite is the mango.

Look, it's simple. This is a small family run place trying to make a go of it. They compete (effectively, in my opinion) with multi-national conglomerate chains and franchises with vastly superior cost structures and exponentially-developed corporate-class support. This is just a gal with encouragement and support from her family and help from whatever employees she can attract serving the best products they can at the best price they can.

In the end, it's a consumable product like a mango smoothie or a cafe latte...but it's the people behind the product and these people deserve support and patronage.  

This is the kind of business I like in my neighborhood: independent, entrepreneurial, jobs-creating/jobs-supporting, ExtraGoodGoodKarma producing businesses.

Located off Blue Diamond and Decatur in the Albertson's shopping center, consider choosing Beanz Coffee Cafe for your next hang out, coffee date, or caffeine fix. You'll be glad you did. I know I am.

Ask for a rewards card...and a free coffee cup (while supplies last).

Yeah, I'm totally digging this place. Only one regret: not being ""first to review"".",bP1-iaqAuy4tEoviQaxJrA,16,15,5,-0LU-eow_m_V_v958ZXHTw

That being said, I was a little disappointed in their pastries. They didn't have a huge selection but most of it seemed like mediocre bought in pieces. We had the almond croissant and a couple muffins. They were nothing special.

I was also a little disappointed that their esspresso machine is the type they use at Starbucks where the beans sit on top the machine in a canister and you just press a button and it grinds the beans and shoots out whatever you asked for. I think part of going to coffee houses that I enjoy is watching the baristas work their magic.

Better than Starbucks? Probably. Better than Peet's? No.",UyUJ2dAPVTwAELPV4dAqyw,2,1,3,Qok6YLaVv3a6zfbFsCLFgA

Not sure how someone is suppose to know what a ""sweet latte"" or ""banana split"" coffee or ""White Russian frapp"" is that they have posted on their menu with no details. And asking questions through a drive thru is no fun.

I ended up with an Irish cream soy latte. Coffee was really good, but it took them no joke 10 mins (no cars before or after me) very bizarre.",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,2,2,3,b1RyW1Abblra5dAAH_-CrA
