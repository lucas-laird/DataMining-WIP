We had to wait a considerably long time given that my friend was on a rented rascal scooter due to a fractured foot.  Aside from the long wait (almost an hour) to be seated, the service once at the table was well timed and friendly.  

The food was good - as a person who's not the most liberal when it comes to trying new things, I was satisfied with the ""gringofication"" of the food - I could have used more cheese, but again, that's really the white girl coming out in me.

My companions were wowed by their margaritas, as was I, and the nachos and steak were excellent.  I personally opted for a combo plate with a taco and tostada and both were very good.

I'd go there again if given the chance.",zzK05ZbEva9FGAjEFWlGFg,1,0,4,9969vDvelmmuQC8AxR3wAw
