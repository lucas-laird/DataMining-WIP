To preface, we had early apps and drinks at the Big Mess restaurant next door, so we weren't super hungry. Also, we arrived about 8:20 p.m. A bit late because they close at 9, but the sweet hostess assured us it was not too late and seated us right away. Not crowded at that time on a Thursday though.

Maury was our server and his personality is a boon to the establishment. My husband asked for his advice on an appetizer and he insisted on the rock shrimp without blinking. Spot on. Perfectly fried little puffs of shrimp are tossed with sautéed shisito peppers and drizzled with a creamy yummy sauce.  

When I told Maury we weren't very hungry, he told us that portions were generous so sharing a plate should be fine. Again, absolutely correct. I ordered a house salad, side of wonderful, garlicky sautéed spinach, and the 16 oz. prime rib, without the bone. It was the smallest prime rib option and tragic that we could barely finish half. 

They also had a nice wine, beer, and drink selection. My husband had a Hefeweizen draft and I had a Bloody Mary.

This was one of the nicest meals we've ever enjoyed. Service, food, prices, and ambiance were all excellent. We can't wait to return!",3MNis15KN6y14ammJ7XX4A,0,0,5,8jKGfQj4xz-eJF72o_Yi6A

The bad and ugly?  The service.  Seems like Sams town restaurant's biggest issue has always been the wait staff.  I can go into details but to put simply when you're paying mid-range pricing for dinner you'd expect plates are cleaned off the table before the main entree comes out.  Server was handling two different tables aside from ours and only came by a handful of times to check on drinksnor anything else was needed - we were here an hour. Also, a plastic bag to take my left overs???  All about the details and although the food hits the mark the service leaves a lot more to be desired.  I'd eat here again but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here to eat and I'm sure everything on the menu is excellent.

The quality is good, quantity was OK, service was fair at best and the price is rather high for the property. The restaurant the Angry Butcher replaced, Billy Bob's, was a hidden gem.

They should change the name to ""The Angry Customer"" I don't mind paying a little more for good food and good service but this place had neither. If you don't mind paying $40 for a slab of beef (prime rib or streak) and getting nothing else with it and then paying an extra $6 for a baked potato or extra $$ for any side dishes you choose . Keep in mind the steak and prime rib was no better than any other reasonably priced steakhouse, Black Angus, Claim Jumper, Outback Steakhouse for example. The service was not good, the waiter made a mistake and brought us the wrong dish and then tried to push it off on us instead of bringing what we ordered and never acknowledged his mistake or even apologized. He didn't come around to check on us or refill drinks and the restaurant wasn't busy. So if you don't mind ridiculously over priced mediocre food and sub par service then you will be fine with this place. None of the people in our group will be returning.",Dn2bVDhga3iLyjPuDroIHg,2,0,2,SLnLGCDK4pAQ1Vxi1U5U4A

I am very picky when it comes to margaritas being made well and David @ the bar made each and every one of our margaritas perfectly each and every time.  His attention to detail and consistent quality were incredible.  We probably had 15 or 16 super premium margaritas and David measured out the ratios, had fresh squeezed juice and each glass was chilled and salted perfectly; some of the best that I have had in a very long time.  I make great margaritas at home but even I am not that consistent when making numerous drinks; David was the ultimate bartender.  And not only were the drinks fantastic, he made us feel welcome and engaged us in some very nice and genuine conversation.

2753020,2016-11-19,0,PsdWWQE_9GrfmCNfz2yW4g,"So based on a recommendation from a friend we drove out to Sam's Town hotel and casino and dined at The Angry Butcher steakhouse. The staff was polite and knowledgeable.  Michael's bar suggestions were wonderful. 
Chef Charles came out to our table and gave us some backstory to some of his recipes. He also made some outstanding suggestions. 
We ordered the steaks that Chef Charles recommended and 5 different sides. The asparagus were perfectly prepared. If you are looking for a unique flavor, a must try is the white mac & cheese as well as the bourbon smashed sweet potatoes. Both were unique combinations of flavors that we all found delightful. 
Make sure you save room for dessert. We had cookies and ice cream and a bread pudding. All were heavenly. 
If you are visiting Vegas, this is a quaint restaurant that has a beautiful view of the indoor atrium. The outside patio has a soft lighting and the sounds of the waterfall drowned out most of the surrounding sounds.",GKO3A3GkAXLnaS8hzPWFHw,0,0,5,iaSU2gCFh9PuxDsxq6FEbA
2800378,2017-12-19,0,PsdWWQE_9GrfmCNfz2yW4g,"This might have been a four star review, but Angry Butcher definitely earns an extra star for its patio seating along the edge of Mystic Falls Park.  Decorated for Christmas, this Park may be the most lovely man-made space in Vegas.  And in Vegas, that's really saying something.  Even if you don't have dinner at Angry Butcher, do go see the decorations and the light show at Mystic Falls.

Even without the patio seating, this is a very nice steak house.  I was surprised by some of the low ratings on Yelp, but after reviewing them more closely I paid no attention.  Anyone who is complaining about the prices here simply has no idea what a high end steak goes for at most Las Vegas restaurants.  Prices here are about 2/3 of what you would pay at a lot of comparable steak houses.  And no, your steak doesn't come with a complementary house salad and sides included, because that's how things come at an a la carte restaurant.  This isn't Chili's.

My steak, which was a filet, was quite tasty and cooked as I had ordered it.  My wife called her shrimp and scallop saute ""quite good.""  We both started with the lobster chowder, and while it isn't the best we have had we both liked it.  Our waiter did not speak the most fluent English, but he was relatively quick with things.  He did forget to bring the Bearnaise sauce I had ordered, but that error was quickly corrected.

Odds and ends:  Our drinks were generous (I would call my scotch a double at most places) and very reasonable ($7 for mine).  We were there a little early, so I think we were getting happy hour prices.  The bread basket was fresh and quite tasty.  Although we sat on the beautiful patio, the interior of the restaurant was nicely decorated as well.  The space was neither too crowded nor too noisy, and the sound of the waterfall in the Park was very pleasant.  The Sam's Town hotel is a bit off the beaten path (especially for us, since we live on the other side of town), but the parking is convenient and free.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,5,JY-Xqz7E9tDnCLHBpcNhBA

We were sorry to see that icon close and wondered if the Angry Butcher could be as good. Our first dinner there quickly did away with all of our concerns. It was better than Billy Bob's!  We started with the cleaver salad, one of the best chopped salads I've had. The blue cheese and bacon were savory additions. We split the rib eye which was cooked to perfection, with sides of creamed corn and sautéed spinach both of which were excellent. Sides are definitely large enough to share. We finished with the chocolate espresso cake - definitely not to be missed!
We have tried most of the appetizers on subsequent visits. The onion soup and crab cakes are top notch. Short ribs are rich and tasty.

The prime rib, porterhouse steak, and chicken were beyond description. We ended our perfect meal by treating ourselves even further with the chocolate and cheescake for dessert.

I don't know if he misunderstood how we wanted our steaks cooked or if they were mistakenly over cooked by the chef. I didn't complain cause my dad treated us to dinner and we picked the restaurant not realizing it was pricier so I didn't wanna be an ass. We tried to split the bill but naturally my dad wouldn't allow for that. Anyways I'd rather go to outback for the quality if we are going to order at $30-$50 steak. Atleast it's always cooked on point for us and the seasoning is better. I'd even splurge and go to Anthony's at the M just cause they are amazing. Unfortunately for me I'm kind of a first shot hit or miss kinda girl with restaurants and this time it was a miss so we won't go back.

The Angry Butcher is a good mix between a low end chain steakhouse in a strip mall and a very high end steakhouse you'd find on the Strip. At $30 - $60, it's a good mix of good food at a reasonable price in a nice atmosphere.

Since it is still the holiday season, we sat out on the patio and enjoyed the holiday light show at Mystic Falls. This scene gives the restaurant a nice ambiance. 

Service was super by our very friendly and witty waiter Maury (hope I got that spelled right). He's been at Sam's Town for 26 years and he's fun and friendly and he obviously enjoys the job very much.

For dinner I had a nicely prepared ribeye steak and my wife had a very good piece of halibut. Both items were quite tasty and filling along with the sides of corn and a baked potato. 

We hadn't been to Sam's Town in a long time. I'm glad we took the chance and headed over for dinner at the Angry Butcher.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,1,0,4,SRDhyRXfpLTtT6pQGMNgIg
2962251,2016-10-14,0,PsdWWQE_9GrfmCNfz2yW4g,"I'm so sad cause I really, really wanted to love this place.  However, my high hopes were dashed by some seriously mediocre food.  
This is the recently renovated spot that Willie & Jose's (R.I.P., homies) used to be.  The location is fabulous and you can't beat the ambiance - it's in the atrium area of the hotel so it's nicely tucked away from all the slot machines, cigarette smoke and the general depressive state of a locals casino.  They offer a patio dining area which overlooks the waterfall feature inside the atrium but unfortunately there weren't any tables available in that area when we ate last night.  We settled on a booth in the main dining area overlooking the kitchen.  
The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  Lots and lots of white everywhere - tables and walls and pillars and the open kitchen area.  It gave it a very crisp and clean feeling.  The service was impeccable from start to finish - that's definitely not a problem here. 
The food, however?  Eh.  I'm quite certain I've had a better steak at Outback.  For half the price.  
I got a 7 oz filet Oscar style (topped with crab meat and hollandaise sauce).  Now I prefer my steak Oscar be made with bearnaise sauce so maybe this was strike 1.  On to the heart of the matter.  The steak was fair.  Not ""I'm coming back"" good but decent.  The crab was good.  Back to the ""hollandaise"" sauce.  One word comes to mind.  Weird.  Almost as soon as it was served, it seemed to separate - part of it was oil and the other part was goopy.  It didn't taste bad but it wasn't particularly good, either and the texture completely ruined it.  
My boyfriend got the 22 oz bone in rib eye.  He enjoyed it but also commented that he's had far better steaks off the bar-b-que at home.  
The sides were great - we got asparagus that was perfectly cooked and the tuscan fried potatoes were out of this world.  Really.  You can't go wrong with rosemary, olive oil and parmesan cheese.  I wish I had ordered that as my entree.  Really.  
I'd like to say that I'll be back to give them another shot.  Maybe it was just an off night.  It's a shame cause it really seemed like a promising spot.  I recommend you check it out for yourself.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,3,1,3,Yna1FxnJqf34zzdRvkSj3Q

Of the dozen steakhouses I've been to in Vegas, this is by far the worst.  The service and main part of the meal (entrees & sides) were really bad.  Hopefully it's just new restaurant jitters and they get it fixed, but I won't be back for a while",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,2,1,2,jM93UunGr_V4rNZBq_I12w

Positives:
1) Seated on the patio and got to watch the show - definitely feel as if you are in another location, not Vegas.
2) Robin, our server, very professional and did an excellent job.

4) Complementary bread was warm, buttered, and very good.
5) Both sides, the asparagus and mushrooms were quite tasty.

Negatives:
1) Entry to the restaurant is a little odd as you walk through the patio to get to the host stand, slightly confusing.
2) For a steak house - expected a little more of the entrée.  Don't get me wrong - a solid steak (I had the porterhouse while wife had filet), but was missing the wow factor.

Overall - a good value for the money and an enjoyable meal compared to some restaurants I've dined at throughout Las Vegas.  Will absolutely be back.",RxhhGRyinyMbuBXAQrmf_g,0,0,4,K2i-Jgs7S0_3gIz2o45KqQ

3968726,2017-09-01,8,PsdWWQE_9GrfmCNfz2yW4g,"I have not been to Sam's Town in several years.  I decided to use some of my Boyd slot points by having dinner at the Angry Butcher.  We used to come here for Billy Bob's steakhouse but that's no more.  The Angry Butcher took the place of a Mexican restaurant.

I made a reservation for 5:30 and got there a minute or two before.  It was a little wait to get seated because the party in front of me wanted to change tables and I had to wait for them to move.  I was seated in a booth in the second section of the interior part of the restaurant.  If you get there early enough or just at the right time, you may be able to get a table on the indoor patio watching the Mystic Falls and the people walking through the area.

I was brought iced tea very soon after I asked for it.  I had pretty much decided on what I was going to get before I went there except for the side.  I ordered the French onion soup, the 16 ounce New York Strip cooked blue, and I got a side of Tuscan fried potatoes seasoned with olive oil, rosemary, and parmesan cheese. 

In a short time, I was brought a round of bread--sections of Parker house rolls baked together and served with soft butter topped with some pink salt.  Yes, I love salted butter.  The rolls were very hot.

My onion soup was very tasty.  There was a coating of cheese on top that had been broiled, a good amount of onions in a rich beef broth, and a slice of bread and more cheese at the bottom of the bowl.  

The steak was done just the way I wanted.  Charred quickly on both sides and then taken off the grill.  I had checked with my waiter about a side.  I asked about the Tuscan potatoes and he described them well.  They're like potato wedges or logs with this wonderful seasoning.  It is large enough to share even though the cost is only $6.  There was enough that some didn't get eaten.

For dessert, I had the lemon curd tart with fresh berries.  I would prefer to have a more lemony taste--this had a very mild lemon flavor--but it was OK and a good way to end the meal.

Service was tremendous!  Ramiro checked often and one of the bussers was always bringing the iced tea pitcher to refill my glass or remove a finished plate.  I like the room.  There is a lot of space between tables and conversation would be easy.

We had a delicious prime rib that we shared it was more than enough,  we had the whipped potatoes,  the entire meal was just delicious and our waitress Debbie was on top of things and I just can't say enough good things about this place pleased as can be. We had our own bottle of wine and they only charged the $10 corkage fee. I would definitely come back to this restaurant and to Sam's Town.

The Angry Butcher had my attention with their menu which was posted next to the entrance, which by the way is tucked inside of Sam's Town's little garden oasis complete with waterfalls. I was immediately sat down and my server instantly appeared. So far, so good! The hostess, who had sat me down, had asked upon arrival for a name. I did not think too much on this, because its almost standard to take a name for a waiting list, or a reservation. So imagine my delightful suprise when the hostess walked by a little later and asked if everytthing was to my satisfaction while using MY FIRST NAME!!! I've yet to taste the food at this point, and my 'interest' had turned into a mad crush! My appetizer of Fat Oysters arrived..a cute re-interpretation of the classic oysters on a half shell. These were big, plump, deep-fried oysters resting on a nest of vinegar slaw in the shell. Beautiful on the presentation and flavor that pops. My main course of their bone in rib-eye and roasted mushrooms were next. Impressive looking steak, and lo and behold it is cooked to my exact liking. I mean precisely! Recall my earlier statement about my passion for steakhouses, and understand it is not an easy task to get that legendary 'perfect' steak. AND! the meat literally melts on your tongue! One bite and you will know that God exists and there is good in the world!! Do yourselves a favor: Head to Sam's Town, make a bee line to The Angry Butcher, but slow down just enough to enjoy the trees, the waterfall and the sounds of nature. When you get there, give the hostess a wink and a nod and let them know the secret is out. They may claim to be a steakhouse, But it's really the Garden of Eden. :)",Slfuav2SxGw2STPY4OiVrQ,0,0,5,C5tGzxN-lTdCtV5mITqz8g

The staff was awesome as always! Our servers Mark and Chelan were very professional and made sure we were taken care of. 

BIG UPGRADE from Billy Bobs and very much needed!! Great job! Priced just right for an a la carte restaurant and WELL WORTH THE $$$$$$. This will also rid of cheap specials that steakhouses just shouldn't have. Never really understood that. Go to TGIF if you want cheap food.

Tried quite a few things...I'm a chef and foodie so what do you expect :

Rock Shrimp $10 -  - Battered Rock shrimp, shishito peppers and aioli - So good that we ordered 2 the first day and then again the next day

Short Ribs $? -  1/2 - Perfectly cooked and delicious flavor but felt it was missing something, maybe green onions or fried onions or something. Thought it could be a little more appealing to the eye. 

Crab Cakes $? -  - You get 2 and these were one of the best I've had.

Fried Oysters $? -  - Im pretty sure there were 5. Perfectly crunchy and Has a little coleslaw type of mix in each shell. I could eat a bunch of these but I had to share 

Seared Tuna $? -  - 5 pieces, very fresh tasting and light 

Salt & Vinegar Chips $7 -  - fried potato chips......straight to the point. Addicting! Sauce was very yummy too. 

1/2 dozen Oysters $? -  - So cold and refreshing!!!! Love love!!!

Salad $? -  - fresh fresh fresh!!!! 

Lobster Chowder $10 -  - Delicious!!!! Finally, some nice big chunks of lobster!! Great job!!!

Filet Mignon 10oz $40 -  - Med rare to perfection! Beautiful char!! And cuts with a butter knife! 

Mushrooms side - $6 -  1/2 - Side portion pretty large. Flavor was ok, had to dip them in the red wine sauce for steak.

I know for fact other restaurants in Las Vegas use this system and would never charge for a second bottle. If it was a bottle of Panna or Peligrino which comes out of a sealed bottle I would have no problem.
I ordered rare prime rib and it came out raw. We were there around 5pm. They probably had reheats from the night before and didn't have rare so they pulled a loin out of the oven that wasn't done cooking and served it raw. Not only was it raw but it had no seasoning. I did take it home and cooked it myself.
We also ordered the roast chicken which had zero flavor. They seasoned it with a little salt and pepper and cooked it. Very plain for a fine dinning restaurant.
We ordered a side of macaroni and cheese  because the dinners are al cart which we also found didn't have any flavor for a steak house.
The manager did stop by our table to ask how things were and my girlfriend said the food wasn't good and I told him we are fine. I'm the type of person who doesn't send food back to the kitchen we just don't go back.

Angry Ranch Hand would have been a more fitting title.

Everything on the menu is outstanding.
Not much in the way of great salads though.
The entrees', soups, bisques, deserts and baked items as good as it gets.

You get what you pay for too.
We think the prices are fine.

Full menu available at the bar and that is very popular with their guests.",BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q,1,0,5,YYJnC7JvHIy0pz45LkQ1FA
