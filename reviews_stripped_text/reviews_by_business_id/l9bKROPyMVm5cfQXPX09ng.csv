240678,2016-01-21,0,l9bKROPyMVm5cfQXPX09ng,"Went to try this resto because of the stellar reviews... wasn't really wowwed by the food. It was okay. I guess... I was expecting more? 

It wasn't bad or anything but I don't think it warranted a five stars rating. I didn't really try a lot of their food but the ones I've tried were just okay. 

Their banchan only consisted of three small dishes... kimchi, veggie pancake, miso soup. The kimchi tasted very generic... not the usual fermented kimchi I get from other Korean restos. 

The chicken wasn't cooked well. It was still pinkish. The eel was very bony. The mixed veggie rice, at least, was good. However, it made me crave for some protein, like fish etc. However, almost everything in their menu is a set. If I wanted protein to eat with the mixed veggie rice... I'd have to order a complete teriyaki salmon bento set. Not very convenient.

Furthermore... It was kinda expensive... especially for what we ordered. I think it would have been better for us to go to an AYCE sushi. 

I'm surprised they don't have dolsot bibimbap in their menu. I won't come back.",HdR-lOoagkl4pQC-xvBlyQ,1,0,3,FvPEairIgygcA6pJG51deQ
255913,2010-04-04,1,l9bKROPyMVm5cfQXPX09ng,"Well Being in a Box was on a list of restaurants I was going to hit up in Las Vegas.

It is a small restaurant of ten tables full of kitschy Asian decorations- from the paper Asian lanterns to the paintings of Korean court dancers on the wall.  We were warmly greeted upon entering and waited on immediately.

My husband is generally leery of Asian restaurants because he hates that they serve a $3 cans of Coke when you always need a refill.  So when he noticed the soda fountain, he was a more willing patron.  

The location is convenient since we were staying at the Imperial Palace on the Strip.  We noticed A LOT of Korean patrons when we were there and figured that if the food can pass the litmus test of a native Korean, the food has to be good.  Another plus is the lack of loud, cheesy Korean music videos that can be found in some restaurants.  (I don't discriminate among Asian videos.  I loathe them all!  I am Chinese and I hate on the Chinese videos as well, especially since Aaron Kwok was in Vegas at the same time.  I did not appreciate the audio-visual assault of his performance on the Wynn jumbotron on my eyes and ears.)

I ordered the beef bulgogi box with all the fixins.  The radish, kimchee and the ginger that came with it was awesome.  There was also a green salad, mac salad and California rolls that came in the box.  The beef was tasty and seasoned just right.  The food surpasses in price and in quality to the other Korean food that we have had (Ginger 3 in Imperial Palace).  The food was cheap and it gave us more money to go gambling later that night!",KW4BAujQPwAihWawfd2APA,1,1,5,NkKaRYiu8ljfCCVbk--5aw

When we arrived we found out they changed the menu and no longer serve sushi. Not wanting to be rude we ordered an appetizer and drinks, planning on going somewhere else for sushi afterward. We saw this place across the parking lot but by the time we finished out appetizer at the other place and walked over they were closing up. My daughter looked sad and the chef simply opened back up and made her whatever she wanted. She had three different rolls I think. The chef came to the table to ask questions and make sure he got her exactly what she wanted for her birthday dinner. The woman working the counter was really gracious and welcoming. We have lived within walking distance of this place for over three years and had never tried it before. Now that we have, we will be regulars. What a shame we missed out for so long.

I had the tofu soup. It was not very flavorful. The broth seemed watered down and though it was spicy it lacked salt and didn't feel hearty.

My husband had the sashimi salad. The fish was OK, but not super fresh. It was mediocre.

The pancake side dish was too doughy and not as good as others I have had. The Kimchi was the best part of the meal, but seemed like it hadn't marinated long.

I was even offered a dessert which was politely declined (I was stuffed!). 

You're probably wondering how much this cost. How about $10.95! Can you believe it? I also ordered a perfect iced tea which was promptly refilled by a super server. For the life of me, I can't remember her name - but she's amazing!

The restaurant is under new ownership and it shows! The quality of food and attention to service is obvious. The portions and price only add to this.

We came here for dinner and here's what we tried
1.  Spicy seafood noodles (naeng myun) *supposed to come with free sake - Refreshing and spicy chewy cold noodles.  Just what we needed for a hot summer night.  We were slightly disappointed that we didn't get our free sake, but at the same time, we didn't bother asking, again.
2.  Bulgogi box - Unique set up in a Japanese Bento box.  It had macaroni salad, salad, california roll and white rice to accompany the bulgogi on the side on a sizzling platter.  The bulgogi was pretty tasty and I did not mind the extra peppery taste at all.
3.  Deep fried soft shell crab - crunchy and tasty with a drizzle of Japanese mayo?
4.  Pan chan - actually kind of disappointed with the quality of pan chan.  The pickled radish was too soy-sauced and tangy.  The onion/omelette triangles were bland.  The so-called kimchi was just iceberg lettuce tossed in korean chili paste (kochujang).

Conclusion:  It's a very cute hole-in-the wall for quick Korean food without having to go all the way to Chinatown.  The down side is that there are no ji gaes and the pan chan is mediocre at best.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,3,0,3,FRyYJi3PudAeXbDbX1k6Mg

CRAZY EEL ROLL- phenomenal. Giant portion, eel is perfectly cooked, ingredients all work well together. $11, good price for what you receive. Favorite of the night.
PINK ROLL- also good, tons of fresh tuna and salmon, both of which are super fresh and cut thick. Also well priced, think it was a $8-9 roll.
SPIDER ROLL- good presentation, artfully arranged on plate. The crab tasted the slightest bit off, though I blame the batter not the freshness of the fish itself. BF really enjoyed this one.
ALASKA ROLL- This is sushi comfort food to me, salmon and cream cheese are perfect together. Sad they didn't have green onions to add. Surprised they don't keep it in the kitchen for other dishes, and confused because the picture shows the roll topped with shredded onion.
LASAGNA ROLL- not for us, at all. I'm not a fan of baked rolls, but have heard others rave about this one and never tried it. Warm cream cheese is just not my thing, wish we would have just sent this back and had it taken off our check. Did not like at all.

I also ordered the Crazy Eel Roll (mis-spelled on their menu as the Carzy Eel). I believe the roll was around $10.95, and it was definitely worth it! The flavor was great, and it was a HUGE roll. Those two items definitely filled me up!

To vary my protein sources from Chicken and Beef, I tried finding a good place for raw tuna and salmon...and lo and behold, I found that place at the WBB!

Now I go every wendesday and get a plate of their fresh salmon salad and spicy tuna poke...and they are both so very fresh and tasty! About $7 bucks a piece and enough meat to satisfy my cravings. And the poke varies a bit in taste from other places I've got it...but a good varience because the flavor is awesome.

And the last time I went, they brought out my salmon salad and told me they cut me thicker slices of salmon (same amount of slabs too...just thicker) and said they did so since I like their salmon so much! Very cool

I think I found a keeper...and I love when that happens",LL6Ao1JidSt_jYCSPpzZOw,5,3,5,iu6jeEBx_xkvcd31voueaQ

I'm a sucker for bento boxes (or combination plates), cheap meals and pleasant dining experiences and this tiny joint checks all those boxes for me.  For the prices, you are getting an excellent deal with large portions.  Not mind blowing fare, but they definitely hit the spot.  Plus, service rocked.

We had the Kalbi bento box which comes with Kalbi, green salad, cucumber salad, macaroni salad, rice, 2 pc crab roll; the chicken katsu bowl; the Kamikaze roll (spicy tuna topped with eel and avocado) and the Alaskan roll (I think, it's California maki topped with salmon).  The eel was delicious and cut thicker than the salmon, but both were of good quality.  The rolls were priced between $8-10 and had 8 large pieces per order!  They also serve complimentary banchan - freshly made kimchi, potato pancakes and pickled radish.  We had serious food comas when we left.  

So next time you are hankering for cheap Korean-Japanese fare, swing by this quirky joint and see if it satisfies your cravings too!  

P.S. This place would've had 5 stars if the Chicken Katsu wasn't over-fried. In case this happens to you, I'm sure they'll be willing to redo it for you.  We were just too hungry lazy to ask. :P",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,2,0,4,QByoVXdJiMJHyMD3IfMwdw

One thing I like about this place a lot is that they mix up their lunch menu regularly. They offer some amazing deals and a whole variety of stuff, such as spaghetti shrimp with don-katsu. Whaaaa? Yeah you never know with this place, but it's definitely always good.

If you want to stick with the regulars, there's plenty to choose from on their lunch menu. I personally like the Mom's Dosirak, which is served with a variety of meat, salad, rice and soup. It's a filling deal for around $10. Also their don-katsu dish is enormous. It reminds me of some of the don-katsu I had in L.A. and it tastes great too. They also have seafood bibimbap (hwae-dup-bap) which I recommend as well.

They do take-out orders as well and the waiting time is never that long, roughly ten minutes or so. The interior is a simple contemporary look that's nothing fancy, but charming to say the least.

When we moved to the states, we were expecting to find better food out here, since the states promises better and bigger things.

We tried the great Asian restaurants in the Venetian, the Forums, and every other place you can think of.  Even the locals suggested a few asian buffets, but to our dismay the food was just ""okay"", and not the great flavors I sought.

One day, out of sheer luck, we passed by this restaurant and finally decided to stop in.  Walking in felt like home; the counter in the front, the nice, homely tables around the sides, and the music just like the stuff played over the speakers at the Chinese and Japanese restaurants where we're from.

The service, for a small restaurant, is impeccable.  Not only are they there to give you refills without asking, but the food comes out fast and extremely well plated.  Our first experience here happened to be what we've sought--great sushi.  We tried their tempura sushi and tuna, and to our amazement, we were finally home.

Their culinary delights include their fabulous tempura that, in all honesty, beats the hotel restaurants and buffets on and off the strip.  Theirs is real tempura--light, crispy batter, perfectly brown and very well seasoned.  Their bulgogi, kalbi, and barbecue chicken is a delight.  If you order anything that comes with a special box, you must eat their macaroni and regular salad.  Even their miso soup is excellent.  Compared to a five star restaurant at home, this place is up there.

I'm not exxagerating when I say that this is the best Japanese and Korean food in Vegas.  It honestly is, and if you want a taste of real Japanese and Korean food is, you MUST eat here.  

Since my discovery of this place, we eat here every day for dinner, and we will continue to because their food is the best in Vegas.  Hands down.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,9,2,5,Dq3irx-G5TASVu5dvL0hzA

what i ate:
- well being bento box: salmon, bulgogi, japchae, tempura: this was soooo worth the $15 price tag. the plate was IMMENSE! filled with food. everything on it was very tasty, and there was probably enough food for two people. my only gripe with the food is that the japchae and the bulgogi were very similar. the only difference between the two was that the bulgogi had meat, and japchae had noodles instead. my suggestion is to just keep the bulgogi to meat and onions, because the added bell peppers, while very very nice in flavor, makes the bulgogi taste exactly the same as the japchae since it's the same veggies. 

pros:
- wide assortment of food on the menu. while there is korean style japanese food, there is also straight korean food too
- reasonably priced! we ordered 5 menu items, and with tax and tip it came out to about $75?$80? and we were ALL stuffed to the brim
- server was very very sweet and patient
- clean and quiet restaurant... but, is that normal? the restaurant was very empty :( such a shame as it's yummy place
- plenty of parking in front

cons:
- not on the strip
- it's kind of in between a homey mom and pop restaurant, and a to go place. 
- small, though the server was nice to put two table together so that my family would sit together.

We walk in to this somewhat divey hole-in-the-wall around 6:30pm, eyeing the unkempt decor and overall awkwardness of the restaurant setup. Very awkward for a first-time visit. However, our waitress was very kind and incredibly quick. She was eager to help and seat us with menus, and, when you settle, the environment is pretty relaxed. 
 
The food is definitely 5/5. The downside is in the decor, as well as the fact that basically everything in their bathroom in pretty much non-functional. Other than that, the food was awesome. Everything was fresh, good on temp, and fully cooked (save the sashimi, lol). Fiance ordered the Chicken Fried Rice and the Lobster Role. I took the risk and dove straight for the Hwe Doh Bahp (Sashimi bowl with rice and greens). Wow. What as serving. A little pricey, but if you really think about what you're getting, then everything totals out.

The Chicken Fried Rice was really good. Large chunks of chicken, pan fried I assume.   Tons of veggies, crisp bean sprouts, green onion, plus some. Fried to perfection, steaming hot in the bowl, and great presentation. Not spicy, but a little warning on the heat when it first arrives. 

The Hwe Doh Bahp was amazing. I fully intend to return just to have it again. Fresh fish, perfectly cut, cold sashimi in a bed of warm rice under greens and sprouts. Flavorful enough, but a little soy sauce and Sriracha on the side should make it absolutely perfect (in my opinion). The fish is smooth, tasted exactly right, and had the beautiful texture we often look for in good sashimi. Did mention that it's gorgeous? 

The Lobster Roll was very tasty. A lot of good flavor from the fish and lobster itself. A great roll with that extra bite of shrimp to really brighten you tastebuds. Not spicy, somewhat casual, and very good. 

Overall, the experience itself was good. Food is phenomenal. I will definitely return, but the environment is just a tad bit uncomfortable. Nonetheless, the food is definitely worthwhile. That's really what matters when you share it with company.",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,3,1,5,kNJMHIoDw-HgrJ7OmZU7rg

The first time was after my dentist appointment I had the Kal-bi box to go. I was so delighted when I got home and opened the box . It had rice, salad, cucumber salad, macaroni salad and four pieces of sushi. Then a whole new box for the Kal-bi. 

The Kal- bi was nice and tender and it was a very generous portion. Once I tasted it ...instantly crave worthy ! I love the salad that comes with the meal because the dressing is very tasty. I'd love to know how they make it. I like it better than some places that make their dressing with the minced Ginger. The macaroni salad is good but different ..it has more of a buttery taste to it. The rolls that come with the meal are okay but it tastes like they've been sitting out for a bit. The box is filling and it includes veggies so you don't have to feel too guilty about all the meat you just ate! 

The second time I came with my hubby I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to find him something that he will eat and enjoy. He found Spaghetti on the menu but he was told that they discontinued it and it will not be on their new menu. Then I found the Kal-bi salad which I thought would be perfect because it has the same idea as Thai Beef Salad which he loves. This comes with the creamy dressing so it's different then a Thai Beef salad but he says he likes the Kal-bi salad better. It was good because they topped the salad with Kal-bi and more of that creamy dressing!

We ordered the Kalbi plate, spicy chicken plate, bulgogi box, edamame, and ahi poki. 
The ahi poke was $8 but was a really nicely sized portion with really good ahi. It was a really nice twist to poke since it had seaweed, cabbage, and fish roe it in with a slight spicy taste. Definitely worth getting! 
The spicy chicken plate first off comes on the biggest plate I've ever seen in my life. I personally really liked it not at all a taste you get a lot of. The perfect description of it is hot fries flavored chicken. I loved it and I'm not usually a spicy person. 
The beef bolgogi was a smaller portion than I would've liked but for $9 it's not bad. Typical bulgogi taste and not overly marinated. 
The Kalbi was extremely good very tender and perfectly cooked. 
Got an order of shrimp shumai half way through our meal. It was pretty good although I've never really had it before so I don't have any comparison.

Beef SoonDubu  (spicy tofu soup) was overpowering with black pepper and none of the usual rich broth flavors (calm jus instead of plain beef broth with black pepper).

My husband had the bibimbap sashimi rice bowl.  The server brought it and said she changed out the tuna for albacore because it is ""more better"".  When he told her that he loves tuna and would rather have that, she then says ""Oh. We are out of tuna.""  The chunks of red snapper were frozen solid (couldn't bite through).  The albacore were presliced, frozen, and was thawing in the bowl.

Appetizer dishes: 2 only, kimchi, and doughy pancakes.  Kimchi was good.

They said no menu available.  I then asked them if they have lunch specials, and all they said was ""We have rice for lunch special.""  Not to be rude, but if you can't market what you are trying to sell, I don't think I want to waste my time with you.  I blacklisted this place after that phone conversation. 

A month later, they dropped off menus at my office.  Ok, maybe things are about to change.  So my co worker and I decided to order some food for lunch.  Free delivery for orders over $25. 

I ordered two salmon hand rolls, one spicy tuna roll, macaroni salad and three orders of sushi.  I must give credit to the gal on the phone for suggesting that I shouldn't get the yellowtail sushi today - honesty works for me. 

So the order came out to be $27.81 for our order.  Here I was excited about my salmon hand rolls, thinking they are going to pretty HAND ROLLS.  They delivered the food within ten minutes, awesome.  But it was so disappointing to see my hand rolls were actually cut rolls wrapped in seaweed.  I don't care if they are Koreans, but they should know the difference between cut rolls and hand rolls...!  

The macaroni salad tasted kind of refrigerator-y.  Yuck!!  The spicy tuna roll was definitely spicy but I don't think it was because of the spicy tuna.  They just dump this spicy sauce on the rice - I couldn't even see the spicy tuna! 

The fish on the sushi was ok... nothing spectacular or that fresh... 

Overall, a quick lunch would be good for this place if you know what to order, but I definitely would not recommend anyone to eat here for an experience.

Yeah so we ended up sharing everything.

I didn't realize it came with other stuff, but she also brought us some miso soup and kimchi and even a Korean pancake to try.

The pancake was fresh and hot and delicious. It was softer than I expected. I've had it only once before at the Korean supermarket on spring mountain, but that one was old and dry. This one was fresh and awesome.

Their sushi had imitation crab, which was no surprise, but I wasn't too crazy about it. This particular batch of crab seemed a little watery and tasteless. However the unagi was really good and the salmon skin roll was just about the best thing I've ever eaten since moving to Vegas a few months ago.

It was my first time having salmon skin roll. If you've never had it, you really got to try it. It was so amazing! It's like healthy omega-3 bacon or something. Seriously you got to try it.

The lunch combo was good too. I was getting full from sushi, so I only tasted the chicken and the kalbi. Both were delicious, but that kalbi was so tender and awesome. I might end up getting that next time we go back.

Service was excellent too. The lady was very friendly. And the restaurant itself was very bright and clean, at least near the windows where we were sitting. It was a very good experience overall.

2. The waitress repeatedly asks you if you want more sake (which means that the service is amazing)! The friendliest of service, very concerned about your happiness and well-being.

My udon was good and only $6. I wish it came with a couple of pieces of tempura, but I can live without it. My wingman had a Crazy Eel roll, and he said it was great.

Unfortunately for Brad Pitt, it ended up being Gwyneth Paltrow's head (spoiler alert!) and not well-being, but close enough right?   I don't think he shoots Kevin Spacey (spoiler alert!) if the box contained Kalbi and rice.  

So I've ventured to Well Being in the Box (WBITB) a couple of times the last few weeks.  The first time was mainly to get a take out menu as I couldnt find a good representation online anywhere.  My friend and I placed an order and waited for it.   The service while waiting was incredible!  I ordered an iced green tea and they gave us two.   They also gave us a free order of a Korean Omelet since my friend had asked about it.  The woman there was welcoming of any questions and was making suggestions during our entire visit.   

I ordered a ""Sushi Plate"" lunch special, which ended up containing 8 (I think) pieces of Nigiri of differing variety.   To be honest, the quality on the fish wasn't spectacular except for the Salmon, but it wasn't bad either and I still ate the entire plate (not a surprise if you've read any of my other reviews).   One downside for doing take out was they only provided one small packet of soy sauce.   I don't think they were intentionally stingy with it, but 2-3 would have been much more sufficient.

The next time I tried the BBQ Combo Plate.  This had a nice sized portion of Chicken and Kalbi, along with some rice, salad (like Leslie Knope, ""I stand by my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things.""), and two pieces of a California Roll.   I found this meal to be much more pleasing than the sushi plate.  Both the Kalbi and Chicken were delicious with the rice, the California Roll was a California Roll, and I gave the salad to my pet rabbits.    The price was right for the full meal @ 8.95.

All in all, I'd probably give the food a 3, but the service is good enough to warrant a bump up to a 4.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,3,4,YJiboldxXGdLUW0R7zYOFg

I usually get take out here, but the few times I've dined in I've gotten the typical Korean side dishes.  I remember them being okay.  I think there was this kim chi pancake thing that was good.
