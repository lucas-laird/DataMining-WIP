Normally I can let it slide and go on with my day but to make matters worst the food was a mess as if it made in a hurry if you are in search of a carl jr. with decent taste I don't recommend this place.",6vQjtc7FEnvysTocIwxKeA,1,1,1,FFc-8ikFVGy9Br0W5WyJqg
507161,2014-08-04,0,V3G5Jxs02jjS_CDLvv-rWg,"There are few things that annoy me more than when I hit the drive through...get home starving and ready to eat.... only to discover that my order was completely messed up. This has happened almost every time I've been to this location. My fave thing on the menu is the teriyaki turkey burger. Each time I order it I stress that I do NOT want mayo. The response is always the same ""mayo doesn't come on that sandwich"". Then when I get home and unwrap my meal I find loads of mayo on it. When people say they don't want mayo.... it's because they can't stand that disgusting lard and any trace of it will completely ruin their meal! 

So make sure you check that your order was done correctly before driving home. On a good note.... A+ for cleanliness and a friendly staff.",wxESptdc3TDA-uc0NokKSg,0,0,2,nMKVjZOV9AMyIholvQHHVw

The staff is so friendly, service is FAST and really accurate, definitely exceeds expectations of a fast food joint. If you've given up hope of quick eats, check THIS location out. Whatever work ethic the management trains their employees with, it is instilled. And more times than not, that's what brings my business around. I like the food, love the people.

This location is close go work so I'll Karen swing know at lunch and pick up food for myself and my Coworker and kg keeps us going all day. A bit pricey for dash food but it's satisfying.

I called and the young lady who helped me answered and I explained my situation. Her response was ""I'm sorry I was in a hurry to close and I accidentally grabbed a spicy chicken I remember you"". She asked for my name and stated I'm not there tomorrow but come back and we'll replace it.""  She didn't tell me that I would have to have my receipt for proof. I went back tonight and was told they did not have anything that said they owed me anything. I told them to call the young lady and I insisted again that they call her the kid waiting on me said he did and she vaguely remembers me. The kid states we have a notice up front about a woman trying to get free food. I immediately said listen I make over 100,000 a year do you honestly feel I would try to steal a 5.00 meal from you. I reinforced that their customer service was in deep trouble. I have always enjoyed Hardee's/Carl Jrs but I will boycott this franchise and do what is necessary to let others know what a joke this is. I asked for franchise owners contact info and they refused to give it to me. This is the Carl Jrs located at Warm Springs and Durango Las Vegas.",D2dkJX5leiQyYX5xOR-j_g,0,0,1,hmSQKRFBvtbBcMxSF8puiQ

Came here the other night to redeem my buy one get one six dollar burger I got for checking in so many times on the Carl's Jr. App! Yes I said all lol they have an app you can download on your phone so that for every visit you get some points! Say goodbye to the old days of cutting out this coupons from the Sunday's paper and scan the barcode on your phone! Burgers are always fresh and love that charbroiled taste! Bit more pricey than the average burger joint but you get what you pay for!

5064436,2016-06-05,0,V3G5Jxs02jjS_CDLvv-rWg,"I like carls in general, but this particular one was disappointing. It might be because I came here probably before closing (10:30pm) and it looks like they don't get much customers, but the sandwiches I ordered were dry and the bottom buns were slight burnt and very chewy, they must've been sitting there on the warmer for awhile. These were the 2 for $6 and I got 1 of each: 1.famous star 2.western bacon 3.bbqchix 4.turkey burger (the best of the 4). The actual best overall though we're the fried zucchini and the crisscut fries. It's really rare that I go to typical fast food chain joints, ever since I moved here to Vegas from the bay a year ago now and it's because there's so many new things to try out, but I'm a late nighter so by the time I get out alot of places are closing or closed.
