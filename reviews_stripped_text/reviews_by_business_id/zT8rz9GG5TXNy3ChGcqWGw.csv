317342,2011-09-28,0,zT8rz9GG5TXNy3ChGcqWGw,"We just moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, and after a couple weeks of fine dining, we decided to go for one of our favorite comfort foods - Dominos pizza.

Unfortunately, what was our regular order for years and years in LA is inconceivable to the folks at our new local Dominos.  

The manager literally called us up to argue with us about our order.  That it had too many toppings, that it wouldn't cook right, that we were manipulating the system (by asking for 4 substitutions on on an Extravaganzza), and that our order was so complicated it would confuse their cooks.

I'm sorry, but if your employees can't handle 4 substitutions or cook a pizza with 8 toppings, then maybe they shouldn't be working for Dominos.

And quite frankly, neither should this manager for calling us up and arguing with us about our order instead of making sure he has his sh*t together at his store.

Piss poor customer service.  Never ordering from here again.  Probably a good thing, will save them a lot of confusion.",1i8fCfSTGfvZeWdz03-CQQ,4,0,1,Wla5jhl1OrzuCIES-OrRBg

Get out to check phone to see if maybe they had called.
Yes, and 1 min after I ordered? What???
Called the number and was told my order was canceled because it was a hotel delivery. Say what? So, you called once, a number known to Dominoes for years, and cancel my order??? Ok so I call. I think the brilliant Alihandro (or how ever it is spelled) was quite RUDE and unhelpful. The kicker is I confirm the order, then one minute later change my mind and call to dance. The phone rings and rings. Then says ""the subscriber is not available"" --- is this a real dominoes!? Where is the transfer to the phone lines when it's busy? Tried calling over 15 times from various phones and same result or the line just cutting off or a prompt of some kind. WTF?

4529996,2015-09-04,4,zT8rz9GG5TXNy3ChGcqWGw,"Experience: ordered some pasta and some soda online for delivery. It was a Wed night @ 8:30 pm. 

Service:  so the order did not take long to arrive, but when I opened the pastas, both of them were made incorrect. This blows my mind, since it was made online, so not much room for interpretation. 
When I called a lady answered, and I told her both of my pastas were made incorrectly, she asked me what I ordered, and I told her that I placed the order online, so it was in black and white, but yet they were still wrong. As I started to tell her the mistakes, she cut me off and told me she had a new person starting, and there was no call for that, and she would have them remade and sent out immediately, thank you very much...but before I could even respond to find out what had her so upset, she hung up!!!!!  
Now, I was both irritated AND offended. I couldn't believe she hung up on me. I assume this person who is new and making all the mistakes has her on edge, but I'm the customer and this shouldn't be my problem. 
Anyway, so I tried to call back to get her name, so I could call her boss the next day, but she answered the phone by saying curtly without a breath...""Ma'am, your order is on the way, and sorry for mistake, and thank you"" and then hung up again!  Wow!!! 
So, then I decided there is no way in hell, I'm eating whatever this chic is spitting in, so I called back again to try and ask for a refund, but again, she answered saying that ""ma'am your order is on the way to stop calling"", so I tried to talk over her and said ""but I want a refund, not the order"", and she said, ""He's on the way"" and hung up. 
So, I called back again, and tried to ask for her name, and make sure she was sending a refund and not more pasta.  She did not let me get in a word again, but I did hear her say the driver was returning with my money and then she hung up on me again. 
Finally the last time I called, she answered somewhat politely, and said ""yes ma'am?"" And I told her all I wanted was her name. ""She informed me I didn't need her name, and it was ridiculous how many times I called, and it was harassment, and I was being rude"" and surprise, surprise...she hung up on me again!  The funniest part was when she said I was being rude.  I'm assuming she is a manager, and it just blows my mind that she thought the way she was treating me was appropriate....even if she thinks I was being inappropriate by saying the order was in black and white. I only said this so she wouldn't think it was my miscommunication on a phone order. Also, I wouldn't have to call five times, if you would have just let me speak, even the first time. 
I sure hope they record those phone calls!!!!!  
They will be able to see how irrational she was behaving. 
I will be contacting management tomorrow, of course. 
BTW, the driver Daniel, was very professional when he returned and gave me my money back. Too bad he wasn't the manager working!  Whoever this nameless manager is, she needs to learn a little professionalism from her employees. 

Good: couldn't tell you...returned it! 

Overall:  I sure hope whomever I talk to in the chain will have a little more professionalism than this lady did. We order from this spot about once or twice a month, and the manager tomorrow will completely determine if I switch to Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, or return again only when I am sure she is not on duty though. Wouldn't ever be able to trust her with my food, when she goes off that hard over nothing. I know I was irritated, but it's not like I was abusive and called her names or cursed at her. I probably should have, then her irrational behavior might have been justified. But either way, dealing with unhappy customers is part of their job. I bet they even have training on it. She must have missed that class. 
Anyway, hope you have better luck than we did, and you don't have to deal with such outrageous behavior from someone in their customer service. 

Note...I was reading another review of this place and saw someone else had issues with this store ""hanging up on them"". Is this standard practice for this store?  If so, is this what dominoes is teaching how to deal with customers?? I sure hope not, but that will make my decision of return business pretty simple.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,0,1,zzQXylJNzeTJA-LLOVC6vw
