Store was dirty,and not to mention, I waited  about 7 mins to finnaly get my order due to a mess up on making my drink. I would probably recommend this store to younger kids who have nothing better to do with their lives..

I noticed that the soda selection did not include Vernors(key ingreadent) to what I came for, so I asked the man at the counter, who happened to also be the owner, if he had the means to make one. He was dissapointed to infprme me that he couldnt , however quickly told me all the thinkg he could make me and asked what else I would be in the mood for. As by bf joined me I was still uincertain of what I wanted at the point. Wemordered a cherry freeze, colcolate brownie blizzard and an orange julius. We sat down and when our order was ready the owner came to our table and deleivered the drinks!! We asked him a few questions about how business has been and so on, he was friendly and upbeat! We LOVED the pride and ownership that he showed, usually you find young kids running places like that but with him being there it gave the place an at hoime feel and we sat and ate our frozen treats and was nothing less then 100%b satisfied!! We will def be back ... most likely too often!!!!",WKnDQ3K1BpBuP6sR2QpLdQ,0,0,5,6Exk-S6v1lmJPVQhbEYvYQ

Saw this owner/proprietor on the local news recently during a major hankering for ice cream which doesn't come very often. to my surprise the owner took my order and took the time to chat while i waited for my sweet concoction.  I ordered chocolate chip, pecans and coconut *(i know, u either love coconut or you hate it).  he said business is good even in this flat economy (probably owing to the incessant heat) and he employs clean cut teenagers that actually want to earn a buck rather than have one handed to them for showing up (take that, Target).  The pretty teenager suggested a blizzard mix of strawberry, banana and coconut next time. i said, can you really do that? mgr must have trained her well and said we can prepare most anything you desire....whoa, have i got a list of things i desire.

That's four cakes a year, it works out to 32 cake from this place. So that makes me an expert on reviewing this store. First off when you walk in, I alway notice how clean it is. Second the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Third the cakes are very good. I like how light tasting the ice cream is and the price is reasonable.

The sign on the wall says "" Buy one blizzard at reg price and size and get another for only ,99 cents""  I did that - got charged the reg amount for two smalls 4.99 each for a total of 10.00

SO I ask the girl WHY we didn't get that deal? She says ""Because you have to ask for it""  so I reply ""So if we don't ask for something that is clearly advertised - you just rip the customer off??!""  she shrugs and says yes - so I ask again if the MGMT would agree with what she just said - she said yes and I was being rude (Apparently - if you ask why you were just BLANTANTLY RIPPED OFF to a millennial teen - they get all offended and consider YOU rude!!)  Her name is ANGELICA

And one wonders why these businesses are failing all over town!  No apology - no accountability that they are committing fraud on their customers.

MARIA is the MGR I will be contacting tomorrow to verify this claim as to not offer the deal your store is advertising and why she has a total idiot hired in the afternoon who is obnoxious and could care less about the customers.

The countless reviews below don't lie - this place is rude and will rip you off and is totally ok with it.

As I walk in I notice how outdated the place is. It looks like it's 10 years past due a remodel. Normally I go to Baskin Robbins but didn't feel like driving there. The service was good, the lady at the register was very nice and polite. What I didn't like were the prices. Considering they don't use real ice cream and it's just soft serve I didn't think their  prices would be so high. I was there so I got two blizzards. While I waited I used the restroom, that bathroom was so disgusting it made me rethink my purchase. When I came out I picked up my order and left.

Walk in and order and as we are waiting, the girl comes out and calls my mint oreo blizzard and starts to take the next order. I asked for a lid and she gives no acknowledgment as she rudely gives me the lid. Being put off by that, the other young lady gives me the other blizzard I ordered and asked for the manager. It was convenient that the manager wasn't available. I asked for the rude employees name and she said her name was GG (as nicknames are professional) and I was given a number to what I thought was the manager. Get home to call for a complaint, and to my surprise, the number that was given to me was not the number of the manager, but the number of the store. The young lady sounded embarrassed as maybe she didn't think I would call. So ""GG"" gets on the phone and very rudely says that they aren't allowed to give the managers number. I asked why they didn't tell me that in the first place instead of lying, and she started to get snappy and I have no time for any nonsense, so I hung up. To add insult to injury, both of the blizzards I ordered had absolutely no flavor. Instead of going to speak to the manager, I thought I would let people know not to visit this dump that hires talentless liars who cannot make a decent blizzard. My advice? Get a clue, be honest, don't hire lying airheads, and renovate the property. Should have walked out when I noticed the store smelled like it wasn't cleaned since the grand opening.

2649069,2010-05-15,0,EomaPrsFLVSe9TLRtpevwA,"This is a really awesome DQ. The management that runs this location is superb!

The first time I went here was to purchase ice cream & some smoothies (from the Orange Julius within the store) with coupons from my Entertainment book. Since I was using two coupons, I thought me and my boyfriend would have to purchase separately. The lady was nice enough to not make it difficult b/c the exception on the coupon did say ""only one per visit or customer"". (I forget since I don't have it anymore.)

My most recent experience was this past week. My sister wanted to order a photo ice cream cake from them for my niece's birthday. She wasn't able to go during the week, so we asked if we could e-mail them the photo with all the necessary information and they were totally fine with it. They were awesome, kept in touch, and the cake turned out great!

My family has ordered three ice cream cakes from this location within the past 6 months and they have tasted like heaven every single time. (We always order the Oreo Cookie & Cream ice cream cake.) They are consistent and I love that I can depend on that. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone ordering an ice cream cake. There is no better place for cakes. TRUST ME! I literally dream about their cakes a night and have withdrawals between my nieces/nephews birthday parties.

3602202,2012-05-22,2,EomaPrsFLVSe9TLRtpevwA,"This review is written in behalf of my boyfriend. This review is for the service, not the food.

It's Summer in Vegas and it is easily at least 90-something degrees out here in the evening. He calls Dairy Queen to ask what time they closed today (Monday) and they say 9:30pm. He was IN the store talking to a staff member at 9:28pm. And the girl in the front says they turned off all their machines (he wanted a Blizzard) following the comment with ""and my watch is fast"". HUH? If your watch says it's 9:30pm, then the doors should've been locked because the store is officially closed. From my personal experience, that is how businesses operate. Don't leave the store open and turn off your machines in an attempt to close and go home faster. 

So for this Dairy Queen, make sure you get here even earlier than their already

5 Stars Are ONLY Earned by a Business That Provides EXCELLENT SERVICE and Offers A OUTSTANDING Experience For A Customer Like Me (I can be hard to please).

I called to order a cake on Thursday and spoke to Jordyn. She was very polite when taking our custom ice cream cake order. She was extremely professional and made sure we were offered the different decoration selections (flowers, writing) and different colors that were available. Our cake was absolutely  wonderful!! :)

We picked up the cake on Saturday. I was immediately impressed that Gissella greeted us when we walked in. She was very friendly and also polite. She quickly grabbed our cake from the freezer, and asked if it was the way we wanted it? It was EXACTLY what we wanted!! :)

 The cake was white, decorated in green and blue, with reese's peanut butter ice cream which is soooo good! The message on the cake was what we requested and looked great. Candles were reasonably priced so we grabbed some blue ones there.

IceCream Cake was DELICIOUS!!!! Everyone was very happy. :)

We were extremely pleased with the service by the 2 young ladies at this location. In a day in age where service tends to be an afterthought, I am happy to say that this  Dairy Queen location clearly values their customers!!

If you have a special birthday coming up or just have a hankering for some dairy queen blizzards, or even lunch/ dinner, burgers, fries, and chicken sandwiches are offered here as well,  I definitely recommend this location! Enjoy!! :)",kl_yCsj4ESbUphmpCfVvRA,87,83,5,uiBzpiRmF-wjxukg5dV8oQ

People were standing all over the dinning room waiting for orders. When the girl gave me my Blizzard,  she literally threw it at me.  I asked for a lid and she walked away. I stood at the counter til she returned. She loudly said ""what's the matter"". I again asked her for a lid. Her response was we don't have any and then took the next order and dismissed me. I asked for a manager and was told none was available. Again being ignored. The Blizzard didn't have much flavor. After a couple of bites I threw it in the trash. Waste of $6.00.

I was told that they did so I drove over and picked out two cakes.  The guy that was working tried to charge me $28 for a cake that is advertised for $9.99 on Dairy Queen's website.  Then he said that he would sell them for $16.99 and I even pulled up the ad and showed him and he still refused.  He said that his owner said to sell them for the $16.99.  Today I got a call from the NEW owner and she told me that the price of the cake was $16.99 because she wasn't participating in the sale.  I told her that she is representing Dairy Queen and that is the way that most her business comes to her store because it is a Dairy Queen store.  I will never go to this Dairy Queen again.
