93605,2011-10-04,0,z9RSunhJggXQW5C4R36hkw,"TAKE A PASS---Buzz started off great and deteriorated.  We took out tonight and had very dry (pot roast) brisket w/out sauce.  I specifically asked about sauce and the server proudly stated it's in a container served on the side.  This is the forth time we have eaten Buzz BBQ and each time we left more and more disappointed but continue to give them the benefit of the doubt for we love BBQ and have limited offerings in LV. 

If we were dining in we would have certainly sent the brisket back, it should not have been served.  I'd love to know how long ago it left the smoker.  It was truly beyond dry.  The chicken was OK but the rib tips were also dry and I'm not sure they have anything to do with any section of the rib.  

The mac/cheese was watered down with a very spicy white pepper bite.

To make matters worse, when I called and complained I was asked if I wanted to drive back and pick up some sauce--REALLY.  I was told they would keep my name by the register and give us a free meat and side when we returned rather than credit back to my charge a portion of this bad meal. We'll use this $25 meal as a learning experience.",VnYYvov21I1J7QCKMQe2rg,0,0,1,vC-8DC7RYcGL6lltRlRqmg

And believe me I don't let anyone get away with mediocrity in my reviews and I'm somewhat of a culinary snob. It also may be that so many places in Vegas are really bad and that I've become so accustomed to this, that when someone does something decent, it seems better than it really is. However I do believe that Buzz BBQ is definitely on the right track and doing it very, very well.
This is everything one should expect from a BBQ restaurant! Meats that involve flavor steps, such as brining, marinades, spice rubs and most importantly low, slow and smoky cooking with wood and or coal. Side dishes that compliment the richness of authentic BBQ, opposed to going to war with it. These people obviously have a passion for and take pride in what they are doing. There are quite a number of places in Las Vegas that fall so short of this it's appalling. As I mention in most of my reviews, baking & or boiling meat and then putting BBQ sauce on it does not make it BBQ and anyone who does this has no business calling it such. What these guys do is fantastic. Brisket that's sliced thick, but still tender enough to cut with a fork. Ribs that are brined, flavorful and extremely tender that come close to, but do not actually fall off the bone (this is not easily achieved by most people). Chicken that even has breast meat that retains juiciness as the result of brining and not overcooking. Meat with a notable ""smoke ring"" resulting in true BBQ flavor which tells you that the people making this food, actually know what it is that defines the style. Beans, Rice, Macaroni and potato salad etc. some of which they might actually prepare, instead of opening a can, putting it in a container and charging you for doing that. Thank you Buzz BBQ for contributing to the positive side of the normally uninspired void of local food culture. Thank you for creating an experience for people, that will leave them well educated and with a proper understanding of what BBQ is, instead of robbing them of it. I should also mention, great location, great environment, friendly, knowledgeable staff, fast service and the story goes on. Three Thumbs Up!!",KuTO-HVHsR5s2nLcUp3dPQ,0,0,5,0AKhfrSyPWiD-7NP5EdxPQ
129087,2012-12-29,0,z9RSunhJggXQW5C4R36hkw,"Well I wish I had read the reviews first before dining here, it would have saved me a trip and money. This place is nothing but a low class, low quality hole in the wall. The food was nothing less of a microwaved, over dry meal. You can tell they buy low quality meats and ingredients to save a buck and you can see that they microwave their food a few times because people are definitely not eating there. Then to top it all off the owner came out before we payed our check and commented on how we barely ate anything, I didn't want to make a stink so I kept my thoughts to myself. We had a groupon because an old one of mine from Memphis BBQ expired and I had to redeem it for a new one at another restaurant, so I figured we would try Buzz BBQ. When it was time to pay the check, the server tried to write in a gratuity of 18% stating that groupon required it. I asked to see the groupon and nowhere on the paper did it say that I had to leave 18%. She argued, the owner came out and was upset with us because he pays a good amount towards groupon and they should require 18%. That's not my fault, as it is I'm stuck paying for terrible food that I barely ate and now you want 18% for a sever that was maybe average. He continued to argue with me about how great his food is which is completely unprofessional and that he was BEST OF LAS VEGAS. Well here is a little piece of advice, when you serve low quality food to the public they will not be returning.

Everything came out quickly and I dug into the sides first. I found both the mac n cheese and the baked beans to be 4-star quality. They weren't the best I've ever had but they certainly didn't deserve the low ratings others have given here in years past.

Although I'm from Tennessee and like my cole slaw to be mayo-based, I found the ice water cole slaw (vinegar based) to be very interesting. Put it on the pulled pork sandwich and enjoyed it thoroughly. The pork was tender and juicy and while it isn't exactly ""Memphis style"" the way I really prefer it, it did the job and I'll definitely order it again soon.

The apple/ice cream dish was fantastic and perhaps the highlight of the meal. Total damage was about $18.00 (I had no coupons or anything).

All in all I enjoyed myself and I'll be going back. I would suggest that reviewers that had a disappointing time give it another shot. Mike seems like the kind of guy that would do what he could to address your issues to the best of his ability.",1g2mwu8ZWcsg94VwmYGb1Q,0,0,4,HEAhgv99ql-Far38a7jNHw

I've probably smoked  about 40 or so briskets in the last 10 years and not once have I come close to what these guys do on a regular bases :( , and my brisket ain't bad at all it's just not great like buzz's .

I read some other reviews and I think its funny people give places less stars because they felt a waiter was trying to get them to order.  How about not being rude and being seated at a table for hours waiting on someone else.  I mean the poor guy is paid on tips and if his table is tied up for hours that sucks for him.  I just hope my fellow yelpers have more etiquette than to do that to people.

Anyways enough of my rant, Buzz BBQ is a small place and feels more like a old saloon to me or a picnic place.

I am just reviewing the BBQ though.  It has two different type of bbq sauces one mild one hot.  I dont think any of the sauces are hot but I like the way the mild one tastes.  I usually get the beef brisket which is my favorite its always smoked perfectly and goes great with the mild bbq sauce.  The ribs are great to even though I really dont like ribs.

Cons: Their sauce needs some help. But the meats are good without sauce (thankfully, as the sauce they give you on the side didn't really add anything to the taste experience). Both the mac & cheese and bbq beans taste like they came out of a package.

I don't understand why people go to chain BBQ places (ahem, Famous Dave's & Sonny's) when there's awesome places like this around.  I can't compare Buzz to other places in Vegas because I haven't tried many here yet, but I grew up eating TN/AL/GA BBQ, so I know what GOOD pork tastes like!

I'm not a sauce person - for me, it's all about the meat:  the tenderness, moistness, trimming of excess fat and the REAL smoky flavor (not liquid smoke!).  I either use no sauce at all or use just a dab, to add a little extra flavor & moisture, so I can't say if their sauce is good or bad - I'm just glad that they don't DRENCH the meat in sauce for me!

We decided to get the 4 meat combo for $30 and man, was it a LOT OF FOOD.  Our meats were: pulled pork (my favorite), beef brisket (2nd favorite), catfish fillets (yummy as well) and ribs (very mediocre).  

The pulled pork was perfect!  I'm a picky pulled pork person - usually, there's tons of fat, gristle and outside ""burned"" stuff mixed into the pork.  This pulled pork was soft throughout, pulled in fine shreds and was totally juicy.  

The brisket was cooked perfectly and just fell apart (I liked the regular sauce on it).  

I'm not usually a catfish fillet person (I like them with the bone), but the catfish was super tasty.  They didn't taste too fishy and the batter was nice and crispy and not super greasy.

The ribs were kind of bland.  They were cooked well and literally fell off the bone, but I felt they needed a good dry rub on them.

For sides, we got fried okra, baked beans and french fries.  The okra was probably frozen, but it was a really good frozen okra (I'm never satisfied with restaurant okra lol).  The baked beans had a tiny bit of spicy kick to them and were pretty decent.  The french fries were really good fries, even though they looked like run of the mill, frozen fries.

For dessert was peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  OMG.  So.  Good.  That stuff was a little bowl of gooey, crunchy, warm goodness.

The bun wasn't even toasted and held the same texture as the meat when bitten into. The only highlight was the andouille sausage but it was cut too thinly to accentuate it's full potential - as thick as pepperoni on a pizza.  I also had the Coleslaw which was disappointing as well. It didn't taste fresh and it's texture was soggy like it had been made a day or two prior. On a positive note, one thing Buzz did well was 'consistency', but unfortunately for them, it's was all consistently awful. I wonder how this place got so many favorable reviews because you've really got to TRY to make food as bad as the kind I had.  Barbecue Cuisine is made up of many different cuts of meat, each having their own distinct characteristics that make them special. Thus, barbecue cuisine should be presented to accentuate these characteristics not to blend them and/or make alike. I guess buzz didn't get the memo.",Y0gT_0LMBliwJbWseWN1hw,1,0,1,-n9ysoTtz3fmFTRl4VXjCw

The quality was very good as well, we had the brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips with sides and we stuffed down as much as we could before throwing in the towel and getting a to-go box.  The meat is very tender and the sauce they have on the table is a great compliment.

The service is good, although it got busy after we arrived and they may have been a little short handed, but all in all we did not have to wait too long for drinks or the check.

Me and my friends are trying to hit up every BBQ place in town, and heard good things about Buzz. We were supposed to meet around 5:30 for dinner and that was when me and my BF arrived, but my friend didn't show up til about 6:30 due to rain and traffic. But the server guy seemed very anxious and kept trying to have us order and seem to be trying to rush us. I felt kind of uncomfortable with his approach.

When we finally ordered, which we got pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and brisket (combo) . And for dessert.. Blackberry Cobbler with freshly churned ice cream. Yum. And the guy that made the dessert actually came out to make sure we liked it. 

Oh yeah, I remembered that we actually really wanted a pulled pork sandwich, but since we got the meat combo instead, we stuffed the dinner rolls with butter and the pulled pork and that was pretty good!

Overall, the service was 'okay' and the food was good, but not great. Nothing special about the ribs or pulled pork or the sides. The sauce wasn't great and the meat comes out pretty dry. There was a large party of 30 but our food still came out pretty quickly.

We did get a stamp card so there is a reason to go back. The food definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. And for the same price, I have had better.

Not only that but this place is a rip now. Everything has gone way up. It was over 100 bucks for 6 people. Thats with us getting their ""deal"" combo 2 for 20. I noticed the combo didnt come with dessert anymore or include their drink. So not such a great deal.

Seriously, it took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. i dont know about you but that too long. Im hungry i expect food to come and be warm atleast. it was luke warm. Also, everyone moves soooo slow. I expect you to hurry to bring ym food in. Hustle woman. especially with the place being empty.

The food is nasty now. The cole slaw is flavorless and over powered by mayo. the mac n cheese should be called pepper and cheese. very watery. my two year old is a mac n chees addict and wouldnt even touch it. The ribs were full of fat. only two bites of meat. Corn bread was cold, so we asked for more and THEN it was brought out warm. not cool. Only thing good was the pulled pork.

Our waitress broke a dish at our table, next to my dughters high chair and just picke up the pieces. i would have liked her to sweep since it was right under my daughter. I dont want her to get glass in her shoe or whatever.

We had sides of mac and cheese and beans. Now this is no joke, within 3 minutes our food was brought to the table! I was blown away as how in the heck could this be fresh? One taste of the mac and cheese (ICE COLD!!) told me I was in trouble. I asked the waiter for HOT AND FRESH, and about 1 1/2 minutes later I got piping hot (microwaved) mac and cheese. Ok, If it ended there I would just say it was a small bump in the road. I tasted my pulled pork and it was barley piss warm with no smoke flavor and extremely bland. Now I'm pissed and DONE eating. The waiter sees that I'm not eating anything and comes over to see what's up and I tell him I'm not happy. I explain that the food isn't even close to what I've had from this place before. Long story short he brings the owner over. I explain to him I've been in the place 2 other times and the food brought me back this time. I also tell him that the fact that it came out so quick meant to me that it wasn't fresh and it was just sitting in holders. How the heck couldn't it be when I got cold mac and cheese and pulled pork out in less than 3 minutes from ordering? His explanation was the he smokes his meat all day and to come back and see for myself( into the kitchen). I politely refuse, and told him I wasn't satisfied and couldn't eat my meal. I did pay for my ticket before he came over and he stated that he would refund my money. The owner indeed did refund my credit card and did ask that we come back and try them again.

Hey Buzz!... listen up you shouldn't have to rely on sauce to provide both flavor and moistness to the meat.  The meat should be the star with the sauce simply providing a new dimension and flavor to an all ready existing exceptional cut of meat, however with your BBQ this is simply not the case.

I spent a few years in Lawton, Oklahoma, and every winter we would stop by one of the store where a brisket vendor would be, grab a few pounds with their homemade bbq sauce and eat that for dinner almost every night.  I never get sick of it.  Since moving back home and then here to Vegas 2 years ago, I never thought that I'd find that bbq brisket with homemade bbq sauce again.

This place has great brisket and sauce.  Their rolls are great, too!  If you want a nice, quick bbq meal any time of the year, they can do that for you.  It is voted one of the best in Vegas for 2009 and I can see why.  Although southerners may not feel as positively about this place as some of us do, it's good for the money you pay and in taste.  

Their sauce is nice and has that subtle heat you want in a bbq sauce, with a sweet finish.  I am glad that they put it to the side when you order eating in or taking out.  I love ordering to take out for dinner because it's only a 10 minute wait. Their rolls come out hot, too.  I eat those with honey butter!

The meat was the most tender BBQ I have ever had, suspiciously tender, too tender.  I mean ribs so tender you could barely pick them up without them falling apart, some might love that but at a point it's too much.  The pulled pork came off as just a little mushy but had no chunks of fat like you might see elsewhere. 

I say suspiciously because meat smoked gets very tender but not fall apart tender like it's been braised or stewed and it also gets a crusty ""bark"" on the outside that rocks, it contrasts with the tender meat inside. Here the BBQ has no bark.  The meat did have an authentic almost strong smokey flavor and a smoke ring and you can also smell the smoke outside so I am not sure whats up, perhaps they smoke it for a while and then steam it or something to get it extra tender.  I ate there at 2 so it's not like it could have been sitting in a steamer tray all day but thats what it reminded me of.  

The flavor just wasn't there out side of the strong smoke.  It needed salt at a minimum, there was no rub taste I could distinguish at all.  The sauce is ok but thin and diluted and the sides were, well, sides.

The mac and cheese was shameful at best, the greens and corn were ok, but nothing special. For dessert I ordered the blackberry cobbler which, as I remembered, was VERY good! 

Overall the meal was good but nowhere worth the $30+ per meal we paid. I was shocked to see the bill after the $25 gift certificate I had, had been applied was still over $50. I had noticed that the server had taken it upon herself to add in 20% gratuity, which I thought was a bit generous considering the service we had. The server was pleasant, but not very attentive.

To start my review, the service was ""a matter of opinion"". If you like your servers aggressive, in-your-face, and meat-headed, Buzz BBQ will suit your fancy. If you DON'T like servers that are doing everything they can to suck the extra dollar out of your pocket (including conveniently not charging you for a beer then saying ""you can put it on the tip if you like""), you might want to avoid Buzz BBQ. 

But it all comes down to the food, right? Not a good thing for Buzz. The cold-water coleslaw was inedible. The macaroni and cheese was tasteless. The rib tips were WAY too smokey. Did I mention the rib tips were WAY too smokey? Yes, I did; but I can't emphasize that enough. Some people like the smoke flavor, and I don't usually mind it, but Buzz BBQ takes it to the next level. My breath smelled like wood when I was finally done chomping through the dry rib tips. Not good.

The sides were subpar. The beans were straight out of a can, and the mixed veggies were the standard green beans, corn and carrots you get from the grocery store for 99 cents a bag.

To their credit, I didn't try any desert so I can't comment on those.

3 stars just for the meat and meat alone, bring it home, slather with your own sauce and you're good to go.",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,0,0,3,o2U3-hV_jGZ9GkoFjW7tEA

A piece of Texas in Nevada!  Go for lunch if you want to avoid the Vegas strip prices!


- We found this place by luck in the middle of August at 107 degrees.
- Ron S checked in using Yelp mobile and we got the 20% discount off our entire bill.
- We were sold on the Lunch special sign: $5.99 for chopped brisket, pulled pork, one side, and drink.
- Upon entering the AC was kicking.... Thank you God!  We're from San Jose, California... so this was not our home turf weather.
- Big recommends:   Get the pulled pork and brisket two lunch combo for $12.99!    Oh so succulent and juicy... rightly smoked!  
- And also get the FRIED OKRAS!!!   Super crunchy !!!
- Yes, the smoker is in front of the restaurant.   Truly authentic Texas BBQ!
- Wanna save more money?  Order food to go and have it for later.   In this case, we all ordered the Texas Tornado (Brisket, Pork, & Sausage) for $10.50.
- Ask for extra BBQ sauce because its homemade tangy kick with bombdiggity spices!    My bad for not thinking about buying a take home bottle!  

- Will You Redo:   F**K YEAH!   I'm coming back.... with or without the crew!
- Parking:  Plentiful during our lunch visit.
- Accepts Debit:  Yes.
- Perfect Date Spot:  If she can throw down with BBQ sauce on her fingers....she's a keeper!
- How Many Miles from the Strip:  The drive is about 13.1 miles.    But so worth it for lunch!

Food - There is a ton of selections to choose from (see pics for menu).  I was going to order the Beef Brisket sandwich and the Pulled Pork sandwich, but the waitress convinced me to try the Tornado sandwich....which has Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Sausage in it.  The sandwich is huge.  I ordered Fries on the side with Blue Cheese Dressing for dip.

There are 2 sauces on the table.....Hot & Mild.  The Hot is not really that hot at all.....kind of disappointing as I like spicy BBQ sauce.  They get a -1 for that.  They also get another -1 for charging us $.50 ea for the Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing for our Fries.....I think that kind of stuff is petty....especially since our sandwiches were $11 a pop.

The Tornado sandwich was very tasty.  I can taste the flavor of each meat.  The bun was just ok though....I think they could do better than that.  Even though they didn't have a spicy sauce, I liked how they allowed you to dress your sandwich with the sauce of your choice....I hate it when places drench their sandwiches in sauce.  

Service - The service was fast and the server was friendly, +1.

Atmosphere - The restaurant is in an outdoor shopping mall....they have it decked out in Western decor, but it's not really convincing....kind of cheesy actually....but that doesn't matter to me with a restaurant of this caliber.

We had a clean table & booth and they gave us a roll of paper towels just in case....which is nice touch.

I would have given this place 4 Stars, but the lack of a true spicy sauce and the petty charge for the dressings made me drop them to 3 Stars.  I still prefer them to the Memphis chain that's in town.

Will I come back?  Sure, when I'm in the mood for BBQ.  Next time, I will bring my own sauce....lol.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,3,2,3,u9h5wiVBXzvmXnS3k16sNQ

Nice looking menu, everything from rib tips to chicken and brisket.  We were there on Sunday afternoon just after they opened (at Noon).  I got the 2 meat combo -Brisket and Ribs with Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens, Buddy got the Brisket and pulled pork.  Sides were ok, not the best; Mac and Cheese could use more cheese and the Collard green could use more flavor.  The Brisket was super tender and had a smoke ring but lacked any real smoke flavor.  The ribs were spare ribs, had a nice bark and were super tender but again no smoke flavor.  There were 2 sauces they provided along with some vinegar and hot sauce; the ""hot"" bbq sauce was no where near spicy and needed a few dashes of the hot sauce to get it going--along with a couple of dashes of the vinegar.

The seemingly pre-made bread rolls and butter at the beginning of the meal would have been better to skip. The sauce was Ok but nothing to write home about. The majority of our sides were some of the most unimpressive things I have ever had. The fried okra was almost definitely pre-done and totally flavorless, the mac and cheese was missing the ""and cheese"" and was really more like mac and a slight hint of cheese, the black eyed peas and rice were just that with no addition of flavor to speak of and the supposedly best cobbler ever was so bad that my wife sent it back. The one semi-redeeming side was the collard greens as they were pretty good. We spoke to the waitress about the quality of the sides and especially the mac & cheese and her response was ""well I know that it's homemade but I don't actually watch them make it"" There was no offer of a different side or any other remedy to the deplorable quality we were extremely disappointed by this response.. They did take the cobbler off the bill but at that point I was so disappointed by the quality of the majority of the food and the lack of trying to wow us with service that I had already made the decision not to return. I have to say that when I go out to eat I really expect not just the main food item to be above boxed our stouffers quality but the sides as well.

I pulled into Buzz for a small meal after a long day at work. Which began as I walked in & was greeted by the owner, I would assume. I was then ushered to my table by an energetic waiter who enthusiastically assured me that this would be an experience of a lifetime...

I've heard that before...On to the food! 

Since I was looking for a small meal I went and ordered the Texas Tornado! A mixture of three meats: beef brisket, pulled pork & andouille in a bun! A juicy temptation! My host recommended that since this was my first visit to jump into adding their zesty BBQ baked beans as a side & the southwest tea as my drink.

I was slightly flustered waiting for the waiter to take down my order, since it would seem he was multi-tasking too many things & unable to prioritize his tasks as fumbled around the dining area. I don't blame him...seems that he was the only person on the floor serving.

When my dish came out of the kitchen, it had a majestic appearance! All those layers of meat were awaiting my palate. My expectations immediately ended on the first bite...

The meat was DRY! Hence the smoky flavors of the meat were not at all prominent, if at best flat, flat, flat...Nothing stood out except for the andouille & my side order of beans.

What I enjoyed about Buzz:

The service was excellent. Our waiter was at once attentive, quick, and personable. For example, when I began choking on a sliver of pork rib, I used the ASL sign for water. Although he didn't know the sign, he figured it out quick enough to save me from coughing up a lung.

We endeavored into the four-meat meal-deal. We sampled: brisket, pork ribs, sausage, and catfish. Sides were slaw (vinegar-base), black-eyed peas w/ rice, and greens. We also tried the sweet tea and two cobblers, berry and peach. Every item we tried was savory and satisfying. 

My only disappointment, although not huge enough to curtail my inhaling (and choking on) the meat, was the pork ribs. They were cooked past succulent. I kept eating them in hopes for those few little nibbles that retained some juice (read: fat). Most of the rib meat was like jerky, hence the choking. [Alright, a third confession: I am a mouth-breather. I choke often.]

We went to Buzz on a Friday night at dinner time. The spot was large and we had no trouble getting a table. They have a few TVs w/ some sports playing and the accompanying beer selection (albeit a limited one). The overall vibe here was chill. One of the owners was cruising the floor to check in with all the customers thereby adding an element of ""down homeyness"" to the joint. 

So pack up your Wet Naps and head over to Buzz for some 4-star BBQ. Its worth the mess.",PEpBk6UQ67T2Vlp7-za61A,1,1,4,_X3ZpbDtwQSW2852mCnrXw

After a little looking around I found it in a little strip mall but it had just closed up at 8pm. Damn it.

Still hankering for some BBQ I recalled Buzz BBQ being somewhere of the 95 Hwy in this area and went off in search of some BBQ.

Buzz BBQ was voted #1 BBQ joint in Las Vegas 2008 and there business is proudly displaying all their new banners and even had it painted on the front doors.

It is not a small place-it actually a regualr size restaurant with lots of boothes and flat screen tv's for the sports fans. Most of the decor is Western.

The hostess was very friendly and helpful describing all the different meats and her favorites. We settled on a 3meat family meal with 2 sides & rolls. I ordered ribs(3), beef brisket and chopped pork with mac-n-cheese  & baked beans plus rolls.

We only waited 5 minutes and it was ready to go. The damage $20!

All the meats were very moist & quite smoky but not overpowering. You could not really taste any rub but it was decent meat.The ribs were large and tender but a little fatty. The chopped pork was the best thing but it had no crunchy pork skin in it. The brisket was very tender but really fatty too.  The sauce was sweet but came on the side.

 The mac-n-cheese wasnt very good and the baked beans were canned. 

Overall it was a little disappointing considering it's suppossedly the BEST.

I was pretty hyped to finally come here to try some ribs and some brisket, I have been pretty high on some Famous Daves for awhile now so I was hoping Buzz BBQ would be the same.

I was actually pretty disappointed.  I loved the decor in the store, pretty nice and warm.  The service was pretty good.  But I couldn't get by the taste.  

With the $20 special (shared with a friend) I was able to try out Ribs, Pulled Pork, and Brisket with a side of fries and a roll.  No matter what I BBQ sauce I tried, everything except the pulled pork didn't really stand out.  It was not bad food at all, but comparing to many other places it seemed like a let down.

I walk in and I'm seated, I'm the only one there besides a group of 4 or so. I ordered the 3 meat combo, picking the brisket, the pulled pork, and the ribs. (I know, my new years resolution to be a vegetarian took a dump on me) For the sides, i got the sweet potatoes and the BBQ baked beans.

First though, the waitress brought me out sweet rolls, which were warm, squishy, and awesome. Pretty surprising, seeing as it was already closing time.

Oh yeah, Yelp needs to change this page, it closes at 7 now, not 9 pm. I walked in there at 8 like the jackass I am. I awkwardly saw it was empty and asked if they were open, she said no, but they'd still serve me anyway since the other group was there and they were still waiting for people to pick up their to-go orders. Talk about service! (Calm down bleeding hearts, I left a good tip)

The lady didn't even have an attitude about serving me. I know some places you walk in an hour before closing and they act like you just ended their world or something.

The food was great. The brisket was tender, pretty lean, and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone juicyness! Pulled pork was also a winner-winner. I dug into this meal with such fervor that about 1/4 the way through it, the waitress apologized for not bringing me the BBQ sauces sooner. WHAT? Sauce? Sauce-smosh, this dead cow/pig is so good, I didn't even notice that I didn't have any, or needed it. I accepted it just to give the tasting-a-testing. The mild sauce is your typical BBQ sauce, and the hot one has a little spice to it, almost teriyaki like. I preferred the hot one.

The beans were pretty good, I did mix alittle BBQ sauce in them to get that ""BBQ backed bean"" taste, they seemed more just baked beans. The sweet potato fries were delicious, it was interesting that they seasoned it with sugar, I've never had that before. I'm used to the olive and rosemary type seasoning for sweet potatoes, but this was a pleasant surprise.

I couldn't skip on the cobbler, so I got a blackberry one to-go, and I wasn't trying to stay too long either.

But enough of that posh-posh, the whole reason I gave this place a 5 star is cause on the way out, the teenage girl at the front counter told me ""sweet dreams!"" HAHA! YES!

I said ""....you too"" and drove all the way home laughing so hard, tears were running down my face, that was the most ADORABLE thing I've ever heard in my entire life and it totally made my crappy day a +100.

I expect a ""sweet dreams"" everytime I leave this place now! ;)",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,15,13,5,2FZO9J35faJo1tdLqvMmuQ

Went w/ a part of 4..they have all these local write up's of their fantastic food, dating back to 2009... Well I think things have gone down hill..Had a brisket sandwich and side of vinager cole slaw..Sandwich was really basic.grilled bun & meat.  Meat as dry..had to slather it BBQ sauce on the table. Cole Slaw very sour....Service was okay nothing to warrent and over the top tip had to remind the server every time i needed a refill...Took a risk w/ the desert..blackberry cobbler as everyone was raving about it...big mistake served barely warm couldn't discern the taste of blackberries...but hey was late (7;30) probably scrapped from the last batch of the day..didn't even have a topping..not likely to return..I know it's a local place and should be supported..but next time I want BBQ it will be Famous Daves. Others had the meat salad..when all was said and done bill was over $65.00..pretty steep for 3 salads, 3 cobblers,brisket sandwich and an I tea..OH A/C was blasting was 65 degrees in the restaurant..had to go outside to warm up",DxQQUd-gbiMCzYznptFjog,0,0,1,5sE-A9EXUljpIi5o-qcxqQ

First thing we walked in and the sign said wait to be seated, so we waited. Nobody came up. We were looked at by everyone working there, but nobody said anything. Finally I flagged someone down and they told us to sit. The only section they were seating was next to the bathrooms. It smelled like a mixture of a porto-potty and meat. 

The servers--if you could call them that--were so confused as to what was going on with the tables. Nobody was our actual server or busboy. We were seen by four different people. They were all so helpful when we didn't need help, but when it came time to refill water, get the check or bring us the half of our meal we were waiting for nobody wouuld come by or even stop. The were semi-friendly, but not really. 

We ordered their ""special"" 2 for $20. It is not a ""special"" it is just an item on the menu. It comes with three meats, two sides and three breads (supposed to be). We asked for double pulled pork and were told it would cost an extra $5, so we went with chicken instead. Two sides were black-eyed peas and baked beans. We waited for much longer then already cooked food should take to get to us--about 20+ minutes. I mean come on the meat is already cooked or smoked, the sides are already made sitting in their pots of whatever holding device they have and their bread is from a bag they don't make that.

Finally the food came out and the meat was good. I'd go back for the meat. The sides were good, not great. The sides were decent. We waited and waited and waited for the bread. Nobody came. Two of the four servers came by but didn't even glance at us and basically ran past us. I finally stopped someone and asked where our bread was. After some huffing and puffing the server said ok fine. A few minutes later he brought back two pathetic excuses for bread. 

Food is decent. Atmosphere is smelly (like poop) and strange. Servers are rude. Food service is super slow. Portions are not big enough for what they describe. I won't be back.",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,1,0,1,G1hSRTREbovUAAan1twVGw

We last went in 2008 and apparently they've moved and expanded.

We liked the sampler and the sides. However I am always disappointed when a BBQ place does not have fries.

Not the best BBQ we've ever had, but it beats anything so far in San Diego, including Phils BBQ!",usbJqudjyAuLpjHD592l8g,0,0,4,U8l9eR8R-5nWFC4UWOdolg

They've recently moved to a new location which is much larger and open.  Food is still fantastic.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is the sauce.  It's just ok and doesn't compare with the quality of their meats.  Rudy's Sause (yes that's how it's spelled) from Texas is still my favorite BBQ sauce.  Lately I've been getting take out so I can use my bottle of Rudy's at home.  I'm going to try to bring it into the restaurant and hopefully I won't get kicked out.

Ok, the food is top notch; great catfish; the Briquette is divine; the server was a trip and is what you expect going into a old school mom and pop dive restaurant (this is by no means a dive) it's a very intimate little restaurant sitting perhaps 50 people max.

I know they spray for bugs/rodents as the exterminator came in twice during my last visit...Just a word of advice for the managers there; schedule these guys during off hours like before you open or after you close and not during the start of your early lunch crowd; I haven't been too keen on going back since I saw the man carrying his arsenal back into the kitchen and exiting with more things than he came in with. 
Your food was good but the mental image of the march of death performed by the exterminator visit was just too much for you to overcome.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,1,3,ok-c31DqtFzJD4e-WH0J7A
