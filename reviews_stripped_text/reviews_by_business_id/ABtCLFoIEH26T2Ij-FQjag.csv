Please note that for this review I need to provide a bit of background. I have lived in the United States for many years after leaving Cuba. For the bulk of these years, my family and I have lived in El Paso, Texas. One thing El Paso has is pretty great Mexican food. However, a Cuban food mecca it is not, so ready made Cuban pastries and other foods are not readily available.

By way of the internet, my husband found Roly's Bakery last Christmas. He wanted to surprise me with Cuban pastries. He is not Cuban and did not quite know what I would like, but Vanessa, Roly's manager, truly helped him with those choices over the phone.

He told me that she was the only one who was willing to work with him with the order out of the several Cuban bakeries throughout the states he had contacted. We had been married at the time for 13 years, and that box of Cuban pastries I opened Christmas morning was one of the best if not the best present I have received from him during our marriage. He was taken back as to how much it meant to me to receive these. My darling husband I am sure did not imagine the tears of happiness he caused.

Since then, we have met Vanessa in person and have visited the bakery several times this year. While there we have enjoyed their guava and coconut pastries, Cuban sandwiches, croquetas, and more. In addition, we always put an order in with Vanessa so we can bring back boxes of pastries with us whether we fly or drive; let us just say that a lot of Cuban pastries make their way to El Paso. My dad, who will be turning 86 in December, absolutely loves them. We will be back in a month for our third Vegas trip this year, and dad is definitely looking forward to the new batch of pastelitos coming his way.

Besides their delicious offerings, what really sets them apart for our family is their service. A simple phone call made from over 700 miles away was the foundation for our loyalty; customer service at its best. Roly's is a small down to earth bakery right across from UNLV. Very much a welcomed choice where one can get delicious, well priced food away from the strip. Certainly a wonderful place offering much more for those of us who left behind flavors of another place and time. Roly's can bring them back.",hFZ9IM1VjG7vSV7UPOidEg,1,0,5,bXaCBubeqeyFXl7SoxdemQ

I raved about this place to my dad and was so disappointed by the crummy service and the even worse food we received.  We waited over 30 minutes to get our breakfast when everyone that came in after us was served quickly.  The ladies wouldn't even look our way until my dad finally stared one down and she asked if we were waiting for our breakfast.  When I said yes with an attitude miraculously our breakfast came out. It was COLD!  All we ordered were two eggs over easy with ham croquettes (those things were horrible) our Cuban bread was so hard it was more of a cracker.

I had the veggie omelet and the choritzo omelet.  Both were great with fresh ingredients.  But most impressive was the coffee.  They make a classic Cuban coffee with sugar, and they also make a great cafe con leche.

Interestingly, if you search for coffee houses in Las Vegas, almost all of them are some distance away from the strip.  I guess that is because the coffee houses serve people living here, not the tourists.  So this was a great find, although it will take a car to get there.  Highly recommended.

By the way, they also run a wedding cake business from the same bakery, but you can get many of the cakes by the slice - nice!",mGmBvAOKXFvXyqAmRpqyPA,1,0,4,gXi-brQgknV52srRmsHexg

The girl behind the counter seemed very irritated that we were asking questions such as ""does the sandwich come with mayo?"" and ""can we get it with no pickles?"" (STILL got it with pickles). I know that working with the public is unpleasant a lot (if not most) of the times but when a customer is smiling and asking a question nicely, the least you could do is fake some niceness and not act as if we're inconveniencing you.

Being in Vegas for a few months now I have been missing the pastelitos, Cuban bread, and sandwich.  I expected something a bit more authentic.  It's a shame the people of Las Vegas will equate Roly's Bakery with Cuban pastries since they probably don't know anything better.  First of all the Cuban bread wasn't authentic it was like the chewy bread Wal-Mart sells.  For those of you who've never had wonderful authentic Cuban bread, it has huge air pockets, is very very light in texture, with a crust that flakes almost like paper.  The pastelitos were as far away from authentic as the bread. Again, they missed the flakiness and  the taste was mediocre.  The only thing they nailed was the cod croquettes.",OXhV6_iX7cSLEUb9ixId5w,8,0,1,1T5Y0SsBPj1_QuKxHr49EQ

1267171,2015-01-16,1,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,"Ordered a cake for my daughter's first birthday and it was terrific! 

Having recently ordered a cake for another event at another bakery and being pretty dissatisfied, I was really stressed about this cake order. Roly's came highly recommended from another Mommy friend of mine so I gave it a shot. 

The place isn't much to look at and I wouldn't describe the guy who took my cake order as super friendly but he listened to everything that I said. I had several photos of cakes from Pinterest and u was kind of combining them all to create the perfect cake for my little's perfect party. The guy was patient and took lots of notes. Then we got to flavors. They have tons to choose from and lots of fillings as well. We ordered a two tier cake (30 servings) so I got chocolate with raspberry filling for the top and Cuban cake (which he described as a very moist white cake) with Bavarian cream coconut filling. 

I braced myself for the cost: $172! This was extremely reasonable. So reasonable in fact that my neurotic brain started worrying about the quality of the cake. 

When I picked the cake up, it wasn't ready. We had about a 15 min wait which normally would not have bothered me but it was the morning of her party and I had tons to do so I was a little agitated. 

Any and all agitation immediately dissipated upon seeing the cake! It was PERFECT! Exactly what I asked for.  Driving the cake home was nerve wracking and next time I will definitely pay for delivery. 

The most important thing is this was also one of the best cakes I had ever tasted. Moist and cool with the perfect amount of evenly sweet frosting. I got several compliments from the parents and the kids devoured it!  My only regret was I didn't get to try the chocolate tier. I blinked and it was gone! 

I will absolutely be ordering again!",jOX6aVwI9sA-sQFWBZSsFw,3,2,4,KCnBCtfrYe_WyyCwOSeqKw

I found it on yelp when I was looking for breakfast places near the airport.

The bakery is in a little shopping center and unless you are actually looking for it you may miss it.

We went for breakfast and had the vegetable omelet. It was like $5 and it includes coffee or soda, toast and even a delicious pastry.

It was a super deal, delicious, very clean and the staff was super friendly.

1840587,2013-12-24,4,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,"I'm happy that my brother, a Las Vegas resident, knows all the decent bakeries in town. Since Roly's Cuban bakery is near McCarran, we often stop here before heading to my mom's when I fly into town. So if you get on Tropicana leaving the airport, turn right.  In front of UNLV is an old Strip Mall with Roly's facing campus. It's not much to look at from the outside. And it's not particularly descript on the inside until you look at the display cases full of pastries and the most beautiful cakes.

The two women working inside didn't speak much English, but I speak enough Spanish that with the menu having pictures and prices, it's no problem. Just point and pay - money speaks in all languages. My brother order a Hamburger.  The burger took about 10 minutes, and it smelled and tasted different in a good way.  There are several different types of burgers, but the regular $6.99 burger is a quarter pound patty, with a Cuban style bun.  Chorizo is blended into the meat patty, and cooked chorizo is part of the  toppings, along with mayo, and red bell peppers, I would give the burger 4 stars. It would be great with an IPA (which Roly's doesn't sell)

Pastries were kind of sparse at 5 PM but some good ones were still around. I opted to get a slice of mango cake, with sweet mango topping a white cake and mango puree topping with cream between the layers.. I also got a slice of tiramisu, my favorite thing of all we ordered.  It had a strong cocoa smell from the cocoa powder topping, with whipped cream and white cake layers.  I also enjoyed the guava cheese strudel, but it was a bit heavy and too sweet.  I liked the coconut pastry with the dried sweet coconut paste inside the pastry.  The rolito pastry, rolled yellow cake with pastry, was decent but not as good as the other stuff.

Too bad we didn't taste the cakes. The ones we saw were beautiful, and if they tasted anything like they looked they would be perfect.  We don't plan to order any cakes soon, but this would definitely be a spot to order one.  There are table and chairs for those ordering their sandwiches and relaxing.",eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,4,4,4,rshsfm757bJ8klIHIQ8xnw
2013509,2014-07-12,2,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,"I first visited Roly's Bakery two weeks ago with my husband. We stopped in for a pastry and coffee to follow up lunch at Cuba Cafe. 

Confession: We had a full meal with appetizers, sides, entrees, dessert, AND coffee at Cuba Cafe but, upon realizing Roly's was just down the street and on the way home, we decided to turn our cheat meal into a cheat life. I'm not ashamed. 

Though I was unable to eat again until the next day, I'm both glad we visited and sad we didn't know about this place sooner. 

My husband and I are recent transplants from LA where Cuban bakeries are abundant (Porto's and Cafe Tropical being two popular go-to's). I mention this because most of my experience with Roly's is best explained through comparisons from what I already know.

We ordered a guava cheese pastry, otherwise known as a pastel de guayaba con queso, and two espressos. 

The coffee: It's very easy to percolate a pot of Cuban coffee at home but it's so refreshing to have it done for you on a much cooler industrial percolator.  Based on the cups used, Gavina is the grounds of choice here. Within minutes, two steaming cups were brought to our table and we were directed to the counter for our sweeteners. My Cuban husband was disappointed to not have his coffee made with the characteristic sugar slurry but, at the same time, having the option of using non-sugar sweetener was nice (sidenote: on our second visit today, we were asked if we wanted sugar already mixed in, which my husband enthusiastically accepted).

The pastry: We were served a pastry that was still warm and crusty. It was absolutely delicious. Here's where the comparison comes in: while the price point is higher at just a bit over $1 per pastry, it was more than generously filled with guava paste and cream cheese. The ratio was just about perfect, which I cannot often say about the pastries at Porto's.

A quick scan of the cases and menu showed two things: cuban crackers and bread that we'd been missing all this time as well as breakfast served all day. The latter was what brought us back today. 

There are four combos available: 

#1: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), and coffee for about $5

#3: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), ham croquette, pastry, and coffee for about $7

#4: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), marinated steak, pastry, and coffee for about $8 

To each combo, you can add ham, sausage, and other items for $1/each .

In addition, there are four omelette selections: western, spanish, veggie, and one other that escapes me. All come with a pastry and coffee. 

I ordered the #1 with fried eggs and added bacon. Now, at $1 extra for the bacon, I expected one or two small slices. What I got was THREE crispy thick slices. The eggs were fried perfectly to my liking. The toast? Well, what's there to complain about when you're given freshly buttered toasted Cuban bread?

My husband ordered the #3 with scrambled eggs and a guava pastry. First, it's clear the eggs used are real and not bagged. Second, my husband was thrilled to find that they're seasoned lightly with Sazon, a popular Latin seasoning blend that we use in his eggs at home. Now, the most important part. My husband loves croquettes but has learned not to expect much from any place that sells them. Today, that changed. He bit into his croquette expecting the usual mediocrity and, instead, his eyes lit up and he looked toward the kitchen said, ""Oh my god, MOM? ARE YOU IN THERE?"". I took a bite and can attest to the fact that these are the best croquettes I've had from an eatery.

2235871,2012-06-11,5,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,"¡Azúcar! Is this the only Cuban bakery in Las Vegas? The sign advertises that they are ""like Porto's,"" where I've never been, but I understand is the west coast standard for Cuban bakeries. I also know that Porto's is approximately the size of the entire island of Cuba, which Roly's certainly is not. I'm from south Florida, where there's a lot more variety and competition for this style of bakery, but I can report that I'm very pleased to have Roly's here in Vegas.

My first visit (I was driving east on Tropicana and made a right turn with no notice when I saw a sign that said ""cuban coffee""), I started with my standard order: cafe con leche and a guava-cheese turnover. The turnover was good, but did not fully meet my expectations (a bit dry? not enough cream cheese?), and I was disappointed when my cuban espresso with steamed milk was served unsweetened. In Florida, it is automatically assumed that you want sugar, or they will ask, already fully prepared to pour a full cup of sugar into the hot espresso. Only in Las Vegas, and a small Cuban cafe in Tucson, has my coffee left me wondering, where's my azúcar? Sure, I can sweeten it myself, but I don't enjoy the guilty feeling of dumping loads of sugar into my coffee cup. I could continue this rant, but instead I will note that I'm glad that I selected a slice of guava cake to take home, as it tasted fresh and moist and convinced me that Roly's deserved another visit.

The selections I tried on my second trip were better. I found a slice of the guava strudel more pleasing than the turnover with cream cheese from my first visit, and was introduced to the masareal de coco, two layers of dense, cookie-like cake sandwiched with a sweet coconut filling. I also love the tocinillo de cielo, a dense, yellow flan on top of a layer of sponge cake that helps soak up the caramel syrup. In addition to desserts, Roly's does have a menu of savory options. My husband has tried the traditional pressed sandwich, and said it was OK, but he doesn't have much Cuban sandwich experience for comparison. Having never sampled Cuban pizza, I ordered a veggie, which came topped with fresh spinach, onions, green bell peppers, cheese, and a sweet tomato sauce with a hint of cumin. The crust was more like a thick round of focaccia, so it was a very bready pizza. I'm glad to have tried it once, but probably would not order it again.

Prices are very fair at Roly's: many of the desserts are under $1. Breakfast specials are cheap and worth checking out. Empanadas and papa rellena (those little fried mashed potato balls with a ground beef filling that people seem to be so obsessed with) are also available. Plus, the place is usually packed with Cubans taking multiple boxes of pastries to go. You may wait a bit for counter service, but I think that's a good sign.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,7,8,4,GkrmHhcm0L6CpEzWfy7vXw

4239427,2011-05-31,2,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,"I've driven by Roly's dozens of times. It's a small little mom-and-pop joint located across the street from UNLV. One thing that caught my eye about this place is a sign that touts that they have the best Cuban sandwiches. When someone makes that sort of claim, I don't just take their word for it. I take this matter into my own hands.

Walking in, I saw their array of baked goods right away. Some being traditional items like cheesecakes, croissants, as well as their own selection of treats of Hispanic influence. Everything looked absolutely delicious, but I had to pass since I was there looking for a meaty lunch. Those sweet treats were put there to distract me when I had a sign to challenge.

The Cuban sandwich comes to about $8 + tax. It comes with the traditional works: ham, sliced pork, some pickles, swiss cheese, and mustard served between their own baked bread. In terms of flavor, the sandwich could have had more, especially with their sliced pork. It wasn't a bad sandwich, but it left me feeling indifferent. I kinda like my Cuban sandwich a bit more greasy and toasty. Sorry Roly's, but this was not the best Cuban sandwich. It was a bit to plain for my tastes. I have to admit that the thing was gigantic though.
*3/5 stars based on the sandwich alone

I decided to bump the overall rating to 4 stars due to how delicious everything else looked. They even had chorizo pizza and empanadas, which I definitely have to come back to try. Their cakes are very extensive and have so many other baked goods that's sure to satisfy the sweet tooth. I'll keep that in mind the next time that I drop by.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,8,7,4,r4DO45pByrYHZjxjsQEiMw

4825061,2014-06-10,0,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,"I last visited Roly's a few months back, but I wanted to write a review and forgot...sorry.  Anyway, I am Dominican and I was born and raised in Miami. Many of my friends growing up are Cuban.  To this day, when I go home to Miami my dad goes to Riviera Bakery on 17th ave to get me an assortment of pastelitos. So, I consider myself an honorary Cuban pastry connoisseur.  With that said, I will say that Roly's is pretty good, for Vegas. 
I've had the pastelittos (pastries) - cheese, guava, guava with cheese and meat. All good, but not as flaky and yummy as I am used to. 
I've had the croquettes, and they are okay as well. 
I had a mango milkshake and a mamay milkshake and they were both good.  
Can't go wrong with a cafe con leche.  
So here's the deal.  If you're expecting authentic ""from back home"" stuff, then you're going to be disappointed.  But, if you just need a little fast of home to get you through the day, week or months, then you'll be okay.  They do a good job and trying to make everything truly as Cuban as possible and you have to give credit where it's due.  And if there are Cubans in there on a regular basis drinking coffee and eating sandwiches, then it's gotta have some authenticity to it. 
Give it at try!!",93B4ayOGLg7Kx2T9Oul1DA,0,0,3,14ucs86J9pxRITFVHoes9g

Very good authentic Cuban sandwiches and pastries.  Fantastic breakfast and really liked that the omelet was not greasy.  It was so tasty, filling, and budget friendly as well.  

It's hard to find Ironbeer and Materva unless you're at a Cuban place and it was so exciting to get some. Om nom nom.

Since we were driving back to LA we picked up some great pastries for the ride home.  

They do compare themselves to Portos (they even have a sign out front that says it), however they are not Portos.  Don't expect the crazy lines (yay).  The selection of pastries is not as large but they are just as good!",6Y2J09IwsafIqS5xHnw3Aw,0,2,4,rbWiFG_gUgWwTdomQrjDrA

I tried the Cuban Sandwich- very simple ham, mustard, pickle, swiss/mozzarella cheese. what stuck out was the BREAD- OMG, it was so soft. I cant tell you how it's made but it was the first time I've ever tasted bread with that sort of texture. Try it, it's good- but I warn you the sandwich is quiet large. 

If you're looking for something to wash it down with try a good ol Malta Goya! very unusual taste- but you might like it!",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,5,3,3,CYdATuh_J3p8D2Mx2Wqq_w

Guava and Cheese Turnover
Cappucinno
Flan
Pan Con Croqueta - Ground Seasoned Ham Croquettes with Swiss Cheese Served on Toasted Bread

Located on East Tropicana Avenue and as such driven past thrice weekly en route to work it was largely an effect of location and ongoing intrigue that led me to Roly's Bakery on Saturday afternoon and opting for a small selection due to otherwise substantial eating plans my experience was fine, though certainly not without flaws.  Obviously a small space, and one not particularly easily identified from the street despite large billboards located down the street, it was just prior to 2:00pm that I entered the small Cuban bakery and with several folks seated and eating I took my time to peruse the options, a middle-age woman keeping a watchful eye on me until I was ready to go, my $10 order of one savory and three seats delivered to the table with a cup of water just five minutes thereafter.  Beginning first with the pork croquette sandwich, a pair of fried sticks filled with what I can best describe as 'pig puree' proving an acquired taste beneath tomatoes and Swiss cheese, I only ate one half before satisfying my curiosity and moving onward the guava-cream cheese pocket was indulged in similarly - a nice enough flavor, though most would find bottom of the wastebasket as I'd have simply preferred it more flaky and warm.  To this point largely underwhelmed it was onward to the meal's two best selections that I moved and although the 'cappucino' was two lovely bites of sponge cake rife with simple syrup it simply could not compare to the eggy custard flan, a world-class example with a lightly browned top and pockets of raisins amidst a sea of lightly sugared eggs.

Small, cozy, and pleasant in service Roly's is one of the few places where locals are able to indulge in Cuban baked goods, but with a limited selection and too much focus on 'everything to everyone' items like crème brûlée, cupcakes, and tiramisu I'd have rather see them focus on more esoteric specialties like Porto's in Los Angeles - the lack of several items, including the tres leches, in portions smaller than a full tray was particularly disappointing.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,0,3,5azUe7LwgYSarcX1sKGU2A

A mixture between a colombian and cuban bakery, this place has some yummy breads, pastries and cakes from different regions south of the border at very reasonable prices. I purchased a toasted coconut cake, fruit pastelitos (turnovers) as well as some ground beef ones and they were all awesome. Oh yeah, and if you are in the mood for a cuban-style coffee, get ready to indulge! Their coffee is awesome. Although I did not get a chance to try their bread, it all looked very tasty.

The lady behind the counter was friendly and courteous. The owner also came out to honor a Yelp deal I received (apparently it is expired but still shows up upon checking in) and did it all with a smile!

Looking around, Roly's offer the usual goods and a full scale menu. If we did not have plans to go to a restaurant close by, I would have told him to meet me there. After the experience, I probably should have. Not wanting to completely gorge myself, I ordered a eclair. It is massive. For $2.75, this large pastry is nothing to complain about. The thin shell had a good bite and did not go soggy due to the cream custard filling. The chocolate dip was generous, but not too sweet. As I was paying, I saw large trays of tres leches for $10. I wished they had mini cups or single sized portions for sale. At least I know where I can get a party size tray for the next picnic UYE.

When you check in with Yelp this week, they offer a choice between a coconut or guava danish.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,1,4,UM3MPrZEAzuTo3xehk2ihg

The place is pretty clean. The bathrooms too! I don't  know why, but clean bathrooms, to me, are a good sign that their kitchens are also well kept. I could be wrong but whatever. The staff has all their hair in place which is also a good sign. The desserts looked extremely appetizing. I decided to buy their beef pastry, sausage pastry, senorita, meringue, and tres leches. 

The beef and sausage were okay. The senorita was good but I couldn't get myself to eat it all. The crust it had was a bit hard to get through with a fork. The filling was good but the lack of other flavors other than the vanilla made me get bored of it quickly. The meringue was good too. I don't think anyone can mess that up.  The tres leches on the other hand was awful! It was just cake and milk mush with whip cream on top. It was gross! I always though tres leches should be a little dense. Oh well. I might come here to try their Cuban sandwiches and rereview. 

One star for the nice cashier. One for the cleanliness. And one for okay pastries.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,5,3,3,kt8uqKVEV4Cpfnr_c9d3XA
