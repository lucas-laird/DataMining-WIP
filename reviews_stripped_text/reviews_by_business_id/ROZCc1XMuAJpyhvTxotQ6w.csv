Also, paying $1.00 extra to add chicken only to not get chicken on my onion & tomato salad. Disappointed to say the least.
Bacon CHEESEburger has NO CHEESE. It had 1 measly slice of sad bacon. Disappointment #2.
Philly cheese steak....I ordered with mayo & green peppers, no onions. It was just plain with cheese. The steak was so bland & definitely wasn't seasoned at all. 3 strikes, they're out!!
The only thing that they got right were the 2 cans of Coke. Even though they were warm. No condiments like I asked for. Not even any napkins. I made sure to specifically ask for some also.

I call back again and get into a pointless argument here he says had I just asked nicely he would have given me a free pizza but instead said ""go to McDonald's!""

Husband: ""I bet he got it from that pizza place right there.""
Me: ""You want to get pizza? I'm hungry.""

WELL, basically that's how it went. We entered this tiny storefront, which has two small tables, and a tiny bar area. This place is obviously mainly for pick-up or delivery. 

We ordered a medium one-topping ($5.99). They charge a .50 cent fee for running a debit or credit card by the way.

As for the pizza - it reminded me of Chuck E Cheese pizza. They use the really stringy cheese, so when you pull away from the pizza you get that seriously cartoonish looking style of eating pizza a la Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
