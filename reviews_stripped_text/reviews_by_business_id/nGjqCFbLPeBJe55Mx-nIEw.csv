We arrived at 1130pm when they close at midnight. They were cleaning and yes establishment was clean. The lady behind the counter was nice and to be honest good service. When she asked for here or to go we said here. As the food was ready in 5 minutes she said sorry we are closing and we can't allow you to stay for security purposes. So understanding they are closing and people have families to go home too I get it. But I drove to my family's house and all that device out the window when we looked at our food. I order asada tacos and a cheese enchilada plate. First off it wasn't Asada tacos they put some meat that looked like last years thanksgiving turkey. I tried one and it tasted like salt and ass. The cheese enchilada looked like a day old left over drenched in salad water. I spent $20 there and it was the worst. We were the last customers when they can shut the doors on us and not answer phones. They may have great service in the day but this literally defined there establishment work ethic and $20 I'll never get back. I'll post pics of the tacos I have no idea what that was. No I'm curious to find out what animal that was. Don't eat here at the""end of the day"" you won't get service and food quality a human being deserves.

4039894,2017-10-08,1,nGjqCFbLPeBJe55Mx-nIEw,"I have this philosophy about recipes at restaurants being uniquely their own version of dishes. I grew up on Roberto's in Las Vegas and to me that is casual Mexican food. Tacos Los Toritos is another universe for some people and I totally dig it. 

The east side of Las Vegas, to me, is anywhere east of Eastern and TLT has some of my favorite street tacos on the east side. Street tacos aka just meat, onion, cilantro, and salsa-nothing fancy. My favorites are their lengua and their tripas. They give you the option of soft or crunchy and their crunchy tripas is the way to go. 

Aside from tacos they have your traditional plate meals with rice and beans, your covered fries or nachos, and your hangover cures like menudo.

What stands out for me at this taco shop versus other places is there agua frescas. These are delicious, refreshing, and made in house. Their horchata isn't my favorite, but try any of their other offerings and you won't be disappointed. My favorite is the cucumber.

One thing people may have a love or hate opinion on is their pickled carrots and jalapeños. They are very mildy pickled and spicy which I happen to like. They aren't like the canned ones I'm used to. 

I know this place is a staple on the east side, but even if you don you live on this side of town, they're worth a trip.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,2,4,vaw1ZhPKm2orzfh5-ilNgg

-Carne Asada Tacos: Carne asada is seasoned well, making it rich and flavorful. Probably some of the best I've had in town.
-Tacos al Pastor:  While not as memorable as the carne asada, it's still a very solid taco. Good, but not awesome.
-Carne Asada burrito: I managed to get a bite of this from whom I was eating with. It's basically what you get in a taco, in burrito form (with rice, beans, etc.). Much too heavy for me, so I'd rather stick with the tacos.

All in all, a solid trip. I would eat here again, but wouldn't go out of my way for this place.  I'd call this place radius eating: If I'm in the area, then definitely I'll make an effort to stop on by for a bite.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,1,0,4,Mz1uH53u9DzS3aa0dYdj9w

Their aguas, or natural fruit waters are made in house. All their tacos are very good though. Their tortas, or sandwiches are good too and their burritos too. Their beans are very good too.

Well having to point at the menu or ordering by number because you dont speak spanish. I had the Combo #1. A Burrito with meat of your choice. A Taco. Chips Beans and Rice. About the burrito i got with Carne Asada. It was perfectly seasoned and bundled tight. It looks smaller than some burritos at other places but they pack it with more meat and less on the beans and rice. So its feeling as hell. And the green salsa isnt bland IT HAS A KICK TO IT. The kind of kick that opens up your sinuses. So i will try the red at some point and i can handle spicy. On to the Taco. It was packed with carne asada to. And was moist and delicious. They use fresh vegetables. 

The chips were perfectly fried. The beans had bits of onions in them, and the cheese was gooey and melted on top. The rice was moist and fluffy not dry and dense with some meals at other places. I wanted a Al pastor taco but they were out. Hence the 4 stars but it was 11pm when i went in.
