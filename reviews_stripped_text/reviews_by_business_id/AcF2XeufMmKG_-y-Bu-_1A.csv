Everyone is super rude, and the entire order was a mess , then when we asked nicely for it to be fixed the guy rolled his eyes.

However, like another reviewer said,  the woman who works at the drive thru is extremely cold, rude, and unwelcoming. This is the ONLY fast food place i've ever been to and had someone who worked there act like they are doing me a favor by asking for my order, and doing their job.

Also, you cannot help but wonder when people like this are working there, that if they are messing with your food if you happen to ""make them upset"" or catch them on a really bad day.. LOOK OUT!

I only go here because the food, the deals are great, and because it's close to where I live, but if I had a choice for another wienerschnitzel near by i'd avoid this one just for the attitude of the woman working at the drive thru.",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,0,0,1,Jw23o76ej-9iTA0V_Oarjw

1411065,2017-09-10,0,AcF2XeufMmKG_-y-Bu-_1A,"Wienerschnitzel ... what can I really say.  

Well, the drive-thru staff was very friendly.  5 stars on service.

Food ... well, a bratwurst with kraut, fries, Coke and a shake ... how good could it really be?  Well, the fries were good. Why yellow mustard, not brown? 2 stars.

Now, my problem on this visit ... they must have been out of napkins. However, they made up for it with hand towels (the hard white ones from a bathroom?) I was driving, mustard dripping down my face - what do I do? I wipe my face ... cool?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO - the hard ""napkin"" hit my eye and cut it! :((((( Yes, ouch!  Avoided an accident - next day to the eye doctor ... my eye was sliced!  Maybe my fault ... why? Because I should have never gone to Wienerschnitzel.

Lesson learned.",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,0,0,2,8SVFbqOy3lIl-Zcsk7rS_Q
1701356,2014-03-14,3,AcF2XeufMmKG_-y-Bu-_1A,"My hopes weren't too high- it's a hot dog chain, they have good prices, and I was in a frankfurter mood. 

Hit up the drive thru and service was quick but a bit brusque. Received my 2 mustard dogs for $2, and went on my way. As I unwrapped my first dog, it rolled out of the wrapper and splattered mustard all over my work outfit. I wasn't trying to juggle the darn thing, I wasn't multitasking, it was a disaster. Even the second one, which I was more careful with, was a gigantic mess- mustard everywhere. I don't understand what the staff is doing with the wrappers if the mustard is getting all over the place.

Also, even for $1, my expectations were a little better- when you specialize in a niche product, it should be better than what I can get for the same price at a gas station. It's not. The junkyard dog will still be my go-to, but I'll be hitting up another location to get my fix... somewhere that won't require me to do my laundry after getting a simple snack.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,0,2,EvU8ohN9WF5E3p-7iTjhZg

2409297,2014-05-31,2,AcF2XeufMmKG_-y-Bu-_1A,"OMG I have never had this before and boy was I missing out!! The customer service was great, they were so polite to my boyfriend and I and even hooked me up! I ordered the mini corndog kids meal and they let me sub the desert pear drink for the fountain drink and curly fries for the reg fries (cause they hooked me up!) and it was the best corndogs I ever had! So impressed with this fast food! My BF got the junkyard dogs and they were super filling and good, I had a taste of the chili and it was great too! Will defiantly go back...

Best thing about this place...the desert pear lemonade drink. I am always looking for non carbonated, water substitutes when I'm out, because water and lemonade get really old when that is all you drink. This was sooo good, so so so so good! I am so impressed!

And side note they have an A rating from the Health district.

And another thing! I always order kids meals, because of the small portions (I don't eat much), but the toys are an added bonus. In recent years all toys suck from kids meals...until today! It was awesome! It's a nerf rocket!! Love it!",VLo2oWFDbIB5FVJF15iyEQ,1,1,5,oprMUKNgqKfg61YrlFHe8g

I don't think they care people work and are on their lunch breaks.  Hot dogs, Corn dogs, Chili, and even burgers should not take that damn long!  Complain to management they act like its nothing or they not understanding because you're speaking English.  Well I had a friend tell them in Spanish, and they still take their time.  The cashier in the drive thru male took order then went outside pulling weeds then back in the establishment!  I immediately advised him not to touch my food.  If you like this place and can spare 12-15 min  for your order go ahead.  Mac Donald's is faster than this even when they park you!

3092519,2012-01-11,1,AcF2XeufMmKG_-y-Bu-_1A,"Let me start out my review of ""Wienerschnitzel"" by saying I resent the fact that they dropped ""Der"" from the front of the name! In my heart it will always be Der Wienerschnitzel! That being said, I have always been a fan of this little hot dog joint. The location I frequent is on Rainbow near Oakey. The store is always clean and the service inside and at the drive thru is always prompt and friendly. The buns and dogs are good but they are basically of the store bought variety, so it must be the chili. The chili is a straight forward beef laden red with a thickish texture that keeps it from running off of the dog. It has a very distinct flavor that is unmistakably Der Wienerschnitzel. My favorite item is the chili cheese dog which have a slice of melted cheddar on them. The fries are actually very good as fast food fries go. They are thin cut and cooked perfectly crisp which makes them great for sopping up the leftovers on your ""chili paper"" (the name my kids gave to the chili remaining on the hot dog wrapper after the dog has been consumed). I can't imagine anyone out there that has tried Der once in their lives, but if by chance you haven't, you should give them a try.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,4,2,4,6RI3suhxiGTX0u42vxTwlg

Pulled up about 20 minutes prior to closing and after ordering when we got to the window the cashier (a guy) using a monotone voice repeated my total and kind of snatched the card. Dude I get it.. you work at a hot dog joint and you probably hate your life but please get a new job because the attitude and just extra stuff I could've done without. ANYWAYS on to the food. I don't generally do hot dogs and if I did wouldn't be from here however my nephew said it was "" the bomb"" but next time let's hope we get some better service when I bring him back.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,1,3,tx1XDgsL2khE8-AmOByqtw

This location is always consistently good in every way. My boyfriend and I go here when we want our chili dog and corn dog fix taken care of!

It is close to our house and not a place we eat at a whole lot so when we do it is always super good!

Staff is friendly, the store is clean and the food is fresh and tasty. I just wish I could make corn dogs at home the way they do!

Their wieners and buns are really good and the chili is a perfect topping along with the cheese!

This is our go to spot to enjoy a good wiener!
