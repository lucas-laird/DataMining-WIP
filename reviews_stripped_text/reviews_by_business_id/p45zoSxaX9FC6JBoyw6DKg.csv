40008,2013-10-20,0,p45zoSxaX9FC6JBoyw6DKg,I really liked this place. We ordered burgers since they were having a Saturday game day special. The burgers were all discounted to 8 bucks. I didn't think that was too bad. The only sad thing was our beers coat more than our dinners. 23.00 for 4 beers is kinda steep. Not terrible though.

My nights here were spent in glory.  Fresh off going live with one of my evening news broadcasts at Channel 8 CBS News, this is where my team would wind up.  An average evening was spent with fellow producers, reporters and photogs.  Always, we received the most special of customer service (even when we were not donned in CBS gear) .. the pub style food is amazing, the martinis are well stirred and the table video blackjack and video poker will score you free drinks and half off on all entrees.  All the bartenders are one of a kind, and the milieu is one of extreme comfortableness.  Never were we hounded due to our news occupations by fans, patrons or workers .. which, was a nice break from the normal fan attack received by local news personalities.

Steiner's Pub is the true definition of a neighborhood pub .. where the food is always good, the bar is always social and the alcohol is always plentiful.",SLGN2kIDc4SFAxRiNsNuYw,2,3,4,3bpgL_nMuuYbxzU8bc4f-w

The female bartenders that work the evening shift are fantastic.  They are very quick with a drink and are great at predicting the need for a refill.  They are fun to talk to and I was completely impressed that they remembered me and what I drank even though it had been six months.

The clientele is mostly casual working stiffs with the occasional local drunk mixed in.  It is a great bar to hang out for a few hours and release the stress of the week.  Their selections of alcohol are adequate and I was impressed they carried the 18 year old Jameson.

I ordered the santa fe chicken sandwich. So good! the sourdough bread was delicious. I made the mistake of getting those death valley chips though. The way it was explained reminded me of criss cut fries from carls jr (which I like) but they weren't. They were more like lays potato chips, I should've got fries. My mistake.

Late night, you can't really beat their food specials, and the service is always excellent on the third shift.

During the day and at night however, this place is kind of a drag. They are total nazis about carding people (even those who are obviously 30+) and it gets really annoying. I understand that you can't serve people under 21 but seriously, develop and use some judgment and common sense, and remember your customers, instead of pretending to forget someone. In general, the servers seem intent on finding ways to avoid serving you, rather than trying to help you have a good experience. Perhaps they are so focused on gaming that they view non-gamers as a hassle, if this is the case, they have done a very good job of passively-aggressively making it clear.

First and foremost, the deals they have during football games - college and pro - are enough to make ANYONE want to stop in. Amazing app deals, great discounts on everything (including a kobe beef burger), and some damn nice giveaways. If you're in Vegas for over a weekend, and don't want to sit on the strip (which why would you these days?), hit up Steiners for a game, you won't regret it.

Onto the review! Don't want the normal bar food, look here. My cousin and I were able to make a nearly custom meal. Wasn't an option, but, I had to ask for a grilled, diced chicken omelet. No problem. Not on the menu, but, my cousin asked for a buffalo chicken sammy - bam, no problem. 

And, the ingredients, and food, very very solid for a sports bar. The omelet (diced chicken, cheddar and avocado) was fantastic. Perfectly fluffy, great amount of sharp, tasty cheese and perfectly grilled up chicken boob. Hashbrowns were killer too. Solid crunch on the outside with a great golden appearance.

Sure enough, signage at the door confirmed that Friday is prime rib night, 7-11PM. Discrepancy with the menu though, which states that dinner specials are 7-10PM. Either way, they were down to only well-done prime rib by 9PM, so I guess that's the day you're supposed to get there at 7 exactly or just cross your fingers.

Good bar for a game, plenty of beers and lots of screens. LIked the cozy booths and the variety of seating options available. Don't know if they offer more game day specials for appetizers, but the prices were a little high, IMO.

I went for the chili and side salad combo: $10; BF opted for a burger with a side of homemade chips and a beer, $10. Total came to about $25, so not bad all together, but I felt it was overpriced for what it was. BF would likely only return for late night menu pricing.

Salad was nothing to write home about, dressing was bottled and not particularly flavorful (bleu cheese). Chili was surprisingly bland despite being drenched in cheese and onions. Not sure how they managed that one. Had high hopes considering it's made with black beans and sirloin, but it seemed like it was old. Later that night I had a stomach ache, lesson learned.

BF's burger had swiss, bacon, and grilled onions, though I can't remember the name. I found it to be dry and flavorless, BF didn't think it was that bad. Though we ordered the chips, burger arrived with fries- server immediately caught the error and brought us an extra side of the chips.

Verdict was that we should have stuck with the fries, which were much better. Chips were impressive in that they were superthin and waffle-cut: no clue how that happens, and it was cool, but they were also overly greasy and lacked crunch, and weren't particularly flavorful.

Thanksgiving at Steiner's:  
1.  First of all, it was freezing.  In the restaurant.  Warmer outside.  I kept my coat on as we were seated.
2.  We were seated at a tabled, ordered, received our drinks, told we had to move to another table since our current table was reserved for people who NEVER SHOWED UP.  The manager actually told the waitress to have us move IN FRONT OF US, having the waitress be the bad guy rather than dirty her own hands.
3.  I asked if I could order the pumpkin pie separately out of the Thanksgiving deal.  I was told no.  Even asked if I could pay EXTRA.  Nope, no bueno.   I went next door and gave my money to the grocery store and ate an entire one following said meal.
4.  My sandwich was cold.  HOWEVER!  The fries were delicious, and seasoned very well.

So  I dropped by months later overnight, you know, non-Thanksgiving to try them out on a regular late night.
The bartender was cranky, when we asked if could change out potatoes for french fries, a short, ""We don't do that here"" was thrown back at us.  Unfriendly, uninspiring, average prices.  

Good fries, though.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,11,5,1,9AnlIJCuybN4X8ZPkqE72Q

Lot of good micro brews from the US and always seem like new one added when I go. The prices are very reasonable.

The food always good. I tend too get the sandwiches or burgers. Every time the sandwiches nice hot, fresh, and french fries good. My favorite is the reuben sandwich! I love the thousand island sauce. The whole combination the pastrami really could eat by itself. 

The bar area is great they have lots of televisions too watch the games on. It one if not the only place that get the NHL package. I love NHL and hockey one biggest passions in life. It refreshing too see bar naturally has other three but nice watch NHL game have venue too watch favorite team. They always tend too have some kind of giveaway each week. Also have players card that earn points towards food or beverages.

They have a decent draft list, but a much better craft beer list.  

I love that they have multiple ""bar food"" items that stand out as well.  The nachos are individual chips made into perfect bites with a little bit of everything on each chip.  They have a bratwurst in a pretzel bun that is ridiculously good.

They have a great value for breakfast as well.

That being said I am just too much of a foodie and beer snob to truly appreciate it, but when friends from work or grad classes want to meet somewhere Steiner's is a welcome choice over the myriad of usual bars around.

2965254,2015-01-18,0,p45zoSxaX9FC6JBoyw6DKg,"Been coming to this Steiner's for a couple years now, but just started on Yelp so I thought I should share my impressions. It's in a strip mall very close to Albertsons. Parking is pretty good and the atmosphere is very Nevada friendly as is the menu. Lots of dishes named after places in Nevada. Most folks don't know half the places but we folks that have lived here (came here in '78) and I appreciate the effort.

The person that greeted us at the door was very friendly and welcoming. Our waitress, Kelly, was on top of everything we needed and more as was the young lady the refreshed my wife's ice tea. They both made sure we had full drinks and that I could watch the PBR (Professional Bull Riders) on one of the screens. OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!! I normally leave after dinner but we stayed and had a few more drinks and even went to the bar to gamble a couple C's. One more thing about our waitress Kelly, when I said we would like a couple more drinks to watch the PBR she said please stay you are our guests and we welcome you to stay. HOLY CRAP!!!!!!! Bravo Kelly, give that gal a raise (just don't raise the price of the beers....) she is the only reason we stayed. So, on a rating of 0-5 I give them a 5 on atmosphere and service.

Now onto the food review...I ordered the flat iron steak, my wife ordered the special pot roast for a Saturday. I am a pretty plain sort of eater, don't like sauces and that sort of stuff...so I ordered double veggies with nothing on them and a medium rare steak. Perfection on both orders. My wife was so thrilled by the pot roast she ""forced"" me to try it even though it had gravy. OK, not a gravy guy but I could have eaten every bit of her dinner, just the best. My steak was perfect the veggies were steamed with nothing on them just the way ""I"" like them. So on a rating of 0 to 5, I give them a 5 on food.

From there we went to the bar to watch the rest of the PBR and do a little gambling. The clientele at the bar was more than inviting, one fellow even moved down a machine so we could sit. There wasn't the machine I like but there was one at the end of the bar and the fellow there said he was leaving in 10 mins and we could have it then, so we waited. While waiting we 3 had a wonderful conversation about Nevada, Las Vegas, the Rodeo and the PBR. After he left I took over his machine, played 2 C's and won back a little while getting great service from the bartender who I did not get her name, shame on me, I think her name was Christy, she was very nice. We had been in there other times when the bar staff was not as nice as she and I would love to give her credit. So on a rating of 0 to five on the gambling I have to give it a 5.

On this evening the Steiner's on Buffalo had terrific service, the food was great and the experience was one that would makes us tell others to go there, and we would definitely come back again. The décor is worth the visit alone, the staff was courteous and friendly, the food choices are diverse and the gaming is as good as any gaming is in Las Vegas.  So I ""Yelp"" this place 5 stars...thanks for a great Saturday night out.",6vBjO1c5lpOB_TFwl0wIIw,3,4,5,v8tsjBR68hBEhBg7xA0VYg

Finally I decided to just have a Coors Light on draft and he brought me a Miller Lite. This was the first mistake. We ordered our food. My friend ordered Fried Chicken and it came out still cold in the middle almost frozen.....WOW. She had to return it and waited an additional 20 minutes while everyone else had there food. My other buddy had Fish & Chips, he said it was fantastic. Then our other friend ordered the steak sandwich and she said it was ok accept she had to pick off the onions that she asked them to hold. My wife and I ordered the sampler. This was NOT impressive. The chicken wings were supposed to be plain and they were spicy. The fingers were hard and way over cooked.

Last season we watched all of the football games here on Saturday and had a section reserved for our group.  This year we changed locations because of logistics for people throughout the Valley.  

I stopped in here for old time's sake on Saturday to watch a few games and enjoy a few Blue Moon's.  The place was busy but not too packed.  I wasn't very hungry, so I passed on food and just enjoyed my Blue Moon.  However, in the past I've enjoyed their Kobe Burger and Nachos.  Those 2 dishes stand out for me.

The service was great, as usual.  It's a very casual joint, so come here in your jersey and jeans to enjoy a few drinks and some grub.

I am pretty familiar with the menu and, for the most part, hasn't changed since they opened.  In my opinion, Steiner's is the reason that bar food in Vegas has been elevated past chicken wings & burgers.

Some of my favorite items are the Death Valley Chips, Oasis Cobb Salad, Flamingo Chicken Sandwich, and the Sinful Frozen Cappuccino Pie.  There are daily lunch & dinner specials as well as great daily soups (chicken noodle is my fav!).

The beer list is long; 20 different drafts, 60 or more different bottled ales/beers/ciders.  

The staff is very friendly and service is very prompt.  Be aware, late at night, food is available, but you have to order at the bar since there is usually not waitstaff.

Seating is seat yourself with high tables, low tables, a party bar, and booths as well as gaming seating at the bar.  The decor is Nevada History Kitschy.  As with most bars when it has been busy, the smoke in the air is a little bothersome, but overall, Steiner's is my go to place for a local bar/restaurant for one excellent reason: consistency.",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,3,0,4,H8RjYrSUdUMxS-JdjorXyA

On my last trip here, I purchased 3 Coronas, and the lady ordered four of her beers. Total was around $35, which I thought was kinda high. But then again, this place isn't a PT's: the environment is slightly more uppity, as evidenced by their nicer menus.

They have an extensive beer selection that is reasonably priced. I had a 22 oz Fat Tire ($5.75) with the Kobe Burger ($13.99). My brother had the Treasure Island burger. Fries are al a carte if you want them with the burger. My burger was delicious and I was especially happy with the beef.

Three stars means ""a-ok.""  Four stars means ""Ya I'm a Fan.""  

To be honest this is just a good place to have a beer and maybe some above average bar food.  With that being said I just can't say --- ""Ya I'm a Fan.""  So, I guess I can say it is ""A-ok.""  Comparatively speaking though it is better than other bars that get 3 star ratings and as good as a bar that gets 4 star ratings...  This is a dilema for me.

I guess what keeps this place from being 4 or even 5 stars are 2 things.  First, I was there with 2 buddies, we had 2 apps and some beers.  The tab was $120.  No shots or excessive drinking were talking some draught beer.  Maybe that is just the going rate these days but It rubs my rhubarb the wrong way.

Steiner's is, as my three stars indicates, A-OK.  Not fabulous, but not bad, either.  This time we had Chicken Piccata and a Flat Iron Ranch Steak.  Hubby's been ordering the Chicken Piccata ever since they took the ""other"" chicken dish off the menu, which used to come with terrific criss-cross potato crisps under the chicken and stuck into the mashed potatoes.  He misses those, though his gut and Dr. Oz are happier.  But he likes the Piccata, which comes with fresh veggies and mashed.

My steak was good, cooked a tad more medium than the medium-rare I'd requested, but not enough for me to send it back.  It came with the same sides.
