I ordered a chicken sandwich with Swiss  cheese and insead of cheese they put a lot of mayo and tried making me believe it was cheese when I tried it and it was nothing but mayo and they laughed in my face and took out the mayo and put a slice of cheese, smh people need to be serious about their job",r1j9BIf7_eV_BypbrqofpQ,0,0,1,Y36E5h2gsW-01quskgA-Ww
3572786,2016-10-19,0,Ik4el2F6w2QFUCnx72W3OQ,This was the poorest hamburger display ever! I ordered the western bacon cheeseburger and 2 happy meals.....hamburgers were cold. My hamburger was also dry becauase there was barley any bbq sauce on the burger and the kids happy meals burger was super tiny with more bun than anything and to top it off the buns were stale and chewy.  My 8 yr old son said his hamburger bun looked burnt and smashed and that was before I even said anything.,BjNJgAQcEYoKP7EVrn3Pjw,0,0,1,9jqtyfDl2MPhT2qniUZAxw

What I especially like about this burger provider is the fact that the menu regularly changes throughout the year - year after year. 

Their television commercials have become somewhat less outlandish than they used to be, but are still quite enjoyable.

Unlike Burger King or McDonald's with their ever-present and no longer very innovative Whoppers and Big Macs, Carl's never stops  introducing a new burger with a twist of one sort or another. The current novelty at the time of this review is the Memphis barbecue burger and the one that I stopped by to try.

Carl's also regularly has two-for-one coupons and other money saving offers available to one and all in the advertising inserts that accompany the Las Vegas Review-Journal. You  can even sign up online to get their email offers. 

Burger King issues coupons at a lesser frequency, McDonald's hardly has coupons at all anymore and I can't remember when Wendy's last had any coupons available - pretty much never. It must be against Wendy's policy to do so.

In any case if you need a quick burger or chicken sandwich fix, Carl's definitely will not disappoint while simultaneously keeping that coupon clipper inside you quite content as you save a few bucks.",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,5,yxrGFwhzlYgPxLRCJhOtRg
