I don't know what they do but their orange chicken is ridiculously good. I just can't say no and it's the only orange chicken my toddler will touch. That says something, considering she's a super picky eater. 

Love the green beans but I wish there was less chicken and more green beans. Give up the veggies you whores! J/k 

Glad they've added more seafood options, aka shrimp.. they're delicious. Never fishy, more sweet, salty tangy fatty goodness. I've always believed they have a secret ingredient. Favorites being crispy shrimp, and orange shrimp. Boom baby, the sauces are the key. I've boughten the sauces and cooked it in my shrimp or chicken at home and it's just as good as panda. Especially if your looking for a cheap or healthier alternative then eating Panda Express a lot. 

Love the veggies egg rolls. Mine never come out like that at home, so I have to buy them. They practically throw them in my face and scream at them to bite them.

The decor is cute, the panda is adorable, and I love seeing all those fresh ingredients chopped up and in plain view next to the kitchen Near the glass slider. No secrets.

4014351,2010-10-20,5,wNya6ItPXXde2ulzm_tNQw,"1st to review, baby!  Although this Panda Express I believe has been here for quite a long time.  It has been anyway since I moved into the neighborhood several years back.  This particular Panda Express is the one I usually hit up when I have that guilty craving of Americanized 'Chinese' food.  It hits a pretty good spot.  And how can you resist that cute A$$ panda bear??  Marketing at it's finest I tell you.  No longer do I think pandas and bamboo...I see a panda, I think ORANGE CHICKEN!  Sick, so sick.  I guarantee you kids now a days will grow up thinking that all pandas eat at Panda Express, and will be sadly let down when they find out pandas eat fiber.  All day long.  What's next?  Penguins that have happy feet?  Hmm...sounds oddly familiar.

This place is usually very clean, and most of the time the food is pretty fresh from the wok.  I usually try to hit this place right around lunchtime because almost everything is just coming out piping hot instead of sitting under warmers.  I know most of you have been here before so I won't bore you of how it works with the line or your ordering options.  

My go-to Panda meal (always in a to-go box because I firmly believe you get just a tiny bit more food) - 1/2 fried rice, 1/2 chow mein, beef & broccoli or string beans with chicken, sweetfire chicken or sweet & sour pork, and always (ALWAYS) orange chicken in a separate container.  I like it in a separate container because I don't like it to mix with the rest of my food!  Plus, if they put it in the same container with your other choices I notice you get a little less.  Funny, I don't remember a time when I've been to a Panda Express and never got the orange chicken.  Lately I've been on a Kobari Beef kick with them, one of their new dishes.  Marinated beef with wok-seared peppers, mushrooms, and leeks, all tossed in a sweet, smoky, spicy sauce.  Not too shabby!  I would make this at home if I had a burner that could reach the BTUs Panda Express has.  It's so good! 

Of course you always have the option of their other popular items like mandarin chicken, mushroom chicken, kung pao chicken, Beijing beef, Mongolian beef, as well as their shrimp dishes, crab rangoon (so easy to make it's ridiculous), potstickers, and soups.

For a 3 entree meal with a drink for under $10 it's a pretty good deal if you're in a hurry.  I stop here a lot when my lady and I can't decide where to eat for cheap.  I come to this particular Panda Express because literally 3 doors down (ha ha) is a Subway.  I love me some Subway $5 foot longs!  So my lady and I usually will end up sharing a 3 entree meal from Panda and a foot long from Subway.  When I say share, I mean I eat half the foot long ALONG with sharing the 3 entree meal.  Gotta get my veggies in somehow!  It's funny how a meatball marinara sub goes so well with greasy chow mein.  Match made in culinary heaven!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,1,3,SEnqrrlswndJaNA8wJw-kg

The Mushroom Chicken, String Bean Chicken and Black Pepper Chicken are all great. I like that there are a decent amount of veggies in each and all under 270 calories!

I love this location because it is conveniently located a few miles from my house. I love to go when they are most busy such as a Friday, Saturday night, or 2 hours before they close. I like going during their busiest time because they're always cooking fresh food and the food is always good. I went one time before when they weren't busy and the employees were happy for cook me a fresh serving of whatever I was ordering.

I like how you are able to sample different things while you order your food. It reminds me of the Chinese places in the mall without the shouting lol. I also like if their is a menu item that you want and you don't see it out or low, you can simply ask the employees to cook you a fresher serving of it. Of course you have to wait for it but they kindly offer you a courtesy cup of anything from the drink area. Also, if you complete the brief survey on the back of your receipt you get a free item.

My favorite is the the plate combo with half chow mien and half fried rice. I order the delicious honey walnut shrimp and yummy orange chicken with a side of fresh cream cheese rangoon.

I always get the same old orange chicken, Beijing beef, or Kung pao chicken. I always sample before I order, because some days they have that crispy orange chicken, and on others, it's soggy. 


This location has consistently had soggy orange chicken on my last 4 visits, so I have defaulted to Beijing beef, which has somehow managed to be cooked to a nice crisp.

There was another girl taking my order as well, but she was quite slow. But I believe the other one was a new worker because other workers were quick on their feet. Luckily, Angela came out of nowhere and quickly finished my order with that amazing aura of hers.",CAmzAFiAnO_FSpGL6HqV1A,0,0,5,php38eUkLXWCV--VhewtfQ

5589126,2018-02-18,0,wNya6ItPXXde2ulzm_tNQw,"I know that Panda Express is probably not any healthier for you than any other fast food restaurant. However when I'm eating noodles or rice it just feels like a better choice than french fries and burgers. I love the orange chicken in fact I usually get that every time I come. I find that it is highly satisfying although I seem to be hungry quickly after I eat here. Still find myself coming back a couple of times a week, because the food is so great. Everyone here seems to be in a good mood too so they must like their jobs.",438fkPBiQ2-AmAeisdT-Ww,0,0,5,X1A1yGvHwEZdXC5npYX42w

5840693,2015-06-28,0,wNya6ItPXXde2ulzm_tNQw,This location is right around the corner from my house so been my go to location for panda for more than a few years now. Always friendly staff who offer samples right away. Sometimes if a dish is running low they will offer me the fresh one coming up instead of the old stuff that's been sitting there for awhile. Always good service.,BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig,0,0,4,DUpaiI3w1YTTH_hMk2wVfQ

The service was a little off today. Please make sure if you order double anything, they actually give you 2 servings. Just a tip. If you are going to order 2 or more entrees, please have them only put one on your plate. Have them package your other entrees separately.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,3,1,4,ptMK0kHgwsrByVsqtYZKTQ
