Hubby had fat fries.  Chocolate milkshake was ok.  It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup.

So, it's looks are deceiving. It looks closed due to the lack of customers whenever I pass by. But they are open! We visit this place about once a month, as a treat. The staff is always super nice and chill. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and put together neatly with the fixins! I usually order the small fat with skinny fries. I have tried the onion rings, and they were delicious, but it started to be too much to eat after I finish a delicious fatburger. 

I learned that this chain is in each Station casino, minus Boulder Station. I haven't visited those locations. I'm really glad this location isn't too far from our apt. :) They have a frequent visitor card thing. You get a stamp for each fatburger you purchase, and it's double stamps on Tuesdays. Fill up a card and you get a free Fatburger! I haven't read the fine print, but I'm saving our full cards for a lazy day :)",Gvv5hQR8BYj5f-APtKwImQ,1,0,4,w81kxMy4CXr1Ys-PVfplRA

It was about 2pm and maybe that had something to do with it. There were two people working there and both were very friendly. I ordered the Large Combo. That is 1/2 pound of meat. It did not take very long to get my food at all. As a matter of fact it was brought to my table.

The burger was flavorful and tender, and had the right amount of crust around the edge. It was also very juicy and cooked just right. Each and every fry was golden brown and had a nice crunch to them. I just hate under cooked fries and these were not. These were wonderful. I did love the food here, but I left off one star because of the decor. It is just another fast food restaurant as far as that goes.

1444920,2015-10-15,0,5n2dA_QqO4c_7pSK0Of6AQ,"This Fatburger STEALS FROM CUSTOMERS!! I've never had such a bad experience getting fast food let alone from a Fatburger. When we got our food which was made unusually fast (when Fatburger makes everything fresh) we noticed the burgers were actually cold. So we parked, went inside and asked if everything could be made over since the fries would be cold by the time the new burgers were made. The shift leader then grabs their phone and walks in the back and has us waiting for about 10 minutes. We asked another employee what the hold up was and she tells us that they need to get approval from the owner. WHAT?? We hadn't touched the food at all. I've never seen or heard anything like this. But what happened next is really strange. He comes back and says they can remake the burgers, but not the fries. 

At this point I say I want a refund. I give him my card which he has for about 15 minutes. Once he comes back, he has a receipt for me to sign so the refund can go back on my card. The amount he has for the refund WAS LESS than the amount they debited. THIS FATBURGER FRANCHISE ARE THIEVES. 

This FATBURGER was dirty inside, they weren't even using Fatburger brown logo'd bags for the food and they seem to really lack franchisee health and quality standards. Also, to clarify they kept the money they owed me (A LITTLE OVER $8) with no concern or available recourse for me as a customer. 

I've contacted Fatburger corporate to inform them that this Fatburger rips-off customers and they're ruining the Fatburger name and should be terminated as a franchisee.",OxPD_8rZ-igPjzGW3W5KHw,3,0,1,hfuhxkof3HN1qtFDVKOyOg

2910362,2014-07-06,2,5n2dA_QqO4c_7pSK0Of6AQ,"Good, overpriced burger joint on Nellis and Vegas Valley. This is not a $ IMHO; it should be $$ since you are paying near $10/burger. It's not a good neighborhood so get your burger to go. Get you drinks at the McDonald's across the street since they're going for $1 these days...

My bottom line? If taste means that much and you cannot possibly go 1 extra  mile north up Nellis to get to an equally flavorful contender at In-N-Out, then knock yourself out spending that discretionary gas money on a Fatburger special. Otherwise, move on down the road in either direction (In-N-Out to the north, Original Tommy's to the south) and get a competitive burger with gas money in tact.

2962304,2017-10-10,0,5n2dA_QqO4c_7pSK0Of6AQ,"Food?  Top notch. Service? A lot to be desired.  I came here around 8pm on a Tuesday night and there was nary a soul to be found except for the two guys working behind the counter.  Like really, not a single customer in the entire restaurant.  
The guy taking our order seemed like we were putting him out and acted annoyed that egads!  actual customers had walked into the restaurant and shocking! wanted to eat.  He was so incredibly non-friendly that it was uncomfortable.  My husband (bless his heart *eyeroll*) has a knack for taking a long time to order.  This guy was not having it.  As my husband was checking out the menu, this dude had the nerve to ask not once, but twice, ""Are you ready?""  I mean - I could understand if they were busy and other people were waiting but like I said, we were the ONLY customers there.  Obviously if we're still looking over the menu, we aint ready, Poindexter.
If you can overlook Mr. Personality behind the counter and just come for the food, you're in luck.  The cheeseburgers are classically good.  Quality meat cooked perfectly, tasty cheese, fresh buns and ALL the condiments you might want.  (In fact, while we're on the condiments, if you're not a pickle lover, beware that they put pickles AND relish on their burgers so it might be overkill).  The steak fries might be my favorite part of Fatburger.  They're fat and golden and hot and perfect.  The onion rings are my second favorite thing.  The breading is just the right amount and so you get a good onion flavor plus they're not overly greasy.  
The place was clean (as it should be with no customers in sight) and other than the less than enthusiastic employees there (I mean - I yelled ""Thank you!"" to them as we were walking out and didn't hear a peep back.

I arrived about 10:30am and ordered the smallest of burgers (a fatburger) an order of fries and a small coke.  While waiting for my order they were playing oldies on the speakers and I listened to an Old Freddie Fender song amoung other oldies which I enjoyed.  My order with tax was $11.56 !!!  The burger was fresh and tasty but in a city like Las Vegas where you can eat at a Buffet for $9.99 I thought the burger was way overpriced.  I did think  the fries were nothing special and had a refill on my Coke.  The ketchup dispenser was empty and had to notify the staff so I could have some with my fries. The only way I would eat at this chain again would be if they offered 1/2 off their burgers.

The drive-through menu board is cracked, missing parts, menu items covered up with paper and other parts being held together with tape.

Customer service was terrible, the guy in front didn't show any kind of smile or sympathy I heard one girl call him Jorge so I'm sure that's his name. He should really work on how he speaks to customers.",gg2ufuXRaB-DGWx10KHHmw,0,0,3,IwXzY0ZXKmE4edkZooE5vA

Everyone seemed to like what they ordered and I stuck to an Iced Tea.  I stay away from carbs on most days but, I came close to ordering the skinny fries and a burger as they looked so good.  I can tell you that everyone was happy with their order.  They liked it so much they decided to bring a burger home to have for later.

Maybe on my one day I can eat the carbs, I'll return and mow down a burger or two.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,3,2,4,-0R4l1xrtsONl03pQ8BIzA

They messed up out order and put mayo on both burgers instead of ketchup and when I went to address the problem there was no apology, just an eye roll. I wasn't rude so I'm not really sure what caused this reaction. When she gave us our new burgers she still never apologized for the inconvenience and they were burnt. 

Won't be coming here again. I don't want to feel like I'm burdening everyone by even coming in to their establishment.",v4QDVhlrbVu_Y2texQY-tQ,2,0,1,RrFIDg670PPjgOgqlEEG3Q

5868905,2012-07-24,0,5n2dA_QqO4c_7pSK0Of6AQ,Burgers are ok but they are a little overpriced and can really vary in taste depending on who's on the grill. They also take a while to make and if it's busy you might have to wait about 25 minutes for your order. You could probably get the same burger at Ihop or Denny's for the same price at 2am.,82Q9vX7KBbovF4IP4NYT6w,1,1,3,HRdrljN8NABWP3p-27_Fig

My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up.",8fpiTkK4MO5jJIXHFV4t5Q,3,1,1,DmlGGWLHPAQl2v9qM5noyQ

Food was way over priced for a burger and some grezzy fries was $13.50.
I could have done better staying at home and eating out of a can!",F2av57ztcbYiPADtT-YpdA,0,0,1,-PuUWa0Cw63R_Uh3WxPXzQ
