I typically love Einsteins Bagels...fast, delicious, not too unhealthy and usually the staff is very friendly and competent. NOT THIS LOCATION. I went in a couple weeks ago and ordered a bagel with shmear for myself,and a bagel sandwich for my boyfriend. We were correctly rung up, a little over $10. Our order came up and we left, made it home and we had only a bagel sandwich in the bag...with the shmear for my regular bagel on my boyfriends bagel sandwich. I am not one to pay for food and not receive/eat it, especially when I'm hungry, so I drove all the way back there, and even called ahead to make sure it would be ready since I was now late for work. Upon re-arrival I was met with smug remarks and the incompetent fool behind the counter essentially telling me it was MY fault he rang up our order correctly and somehow confused himself in the ""bagel making process"" which I'm sure is not rocket science, having successfully prepared my own bagels at home for years. I left with my bagel and not so much as a ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or anything. Usually after going to a place with such obvious incompetence I refuse to go there, since it's my local Einsteins I tried again the following week. WHAT A MISTAKE. Not only was the same little dipshit behind the counter, he had the nerve to comment to his co-worker that ""I was the person he was just talking about"" GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT. I do not like to be made to feel uncomfortable when I am simply trying to get a bagel!

1734056,2012-04-19,0,G9-OvE0PBQtDZmnGEB3HEQ,"I've been on a sesame bagel kick these days. I went into this location yesterday, very busy morning crowd. Waited to order, waited to pay, but expected that seeing how busy it was. There was one woman who needed help out with her order which took up five big paper bags. So even though my order was as simple as could be, which was one sesame bagel sliced, not even toasted, to go, I forgave the long wait and decided to try them again. Because their bagels are awesome.

I went there this morning. Yes, I wanted another one! Decided to see if the service was any better. It was later in the day, so when I walked in, there was only one customer at register to order, only one waiting for their food. I ordered two bagels this time (preparing for tomorrow's craving), only sliced to go. I was excited that a batch of them just came out of the oven, fresh and warm! There was four employees behind the counter, yet it just seem like they were moving, yet not being efficient. One of them acknowledged me, said they'd be right with me, then I waited about 5 minutes. Hmmmm. I paid, and my bagels were handed to me almost immediately.

As I was opening my bag of bagels when i returned home, I was thinking that experience was much better. However, as I looked down at my bagels, which did smell toasty and fresh, I saw that they must have manually sliced them, instead of using that automatic bagel-slicer thing-a-ma-jiggy that cuts it almost perfectly. Not sure if it was because it was fresh, but my bagels were flat as the wall. It could've been the bagel thins they were selling. Not cool...

I'm only giving it 2 stars because they taste so good. As flat as they had become. Not sure if it's just this location, but I'll definitely be trying a different one. If that...",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,1,0,2,YAhEWAFyGZ5G5eqr9Wh0gQ

This was a nice place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of being on the strip for most of the week during my time at a conference. Bagels are absolutely delicious and quite cheap. The different spreads (known as schmears) they have for their bagels are also very varied, and delicious.

Unfortunately, for most of the conference I was very sick and was constantly hacking a lung. So I reached for a strawberry lemonade to help wake me up and soothe my throat, not knowing how much it was, and expecting to pay quite a bit. But nope! About $2, which is even cheaper than back home.

Also customer service was very friendly, even though there was a bit of a misunderstanding.

My husband and I stopped by to try the bagels. We've never been here before. We ordered our bagels and they were delicious. The bagel came sliced and toasted Covered with a lot of cream cheese. It was so good. 

2nd visit

My husband and I decided to come back because it was so good last time. We ordered the exact same thing as last time. Our bagels were cold, barely any cream cheese (most of the bagel was plain). My husband took his back in to ask for more cream cheese and to be toasted more. There was a lady with long blond hair in a ponytail. She gave him attitude and argued with him that his bagel was toasted. She toasted the bagel and again gave him barely any cream cheese.

The line was fairly long today, since it seems that everyone wants their delicious bagels. The line moved very fast and smooth. Both registers were open and the line flow never failed. I ordered the Applewood Bacon and Cheddar sandwich on a cinnamon and sugar bagel. This is combo of the cinnamon and sugar and egg and cheese is sweet but sharp. And in the end is just right!

This Einstein's location is larger than most with a complete dining room and outdoor Arizona type room. No one was sitting outside since it is over 100 degrees today. Not good patio sitting weather. The tea I ordered was a rose flavor and was the right balance that I needed with the egg. With the store being so busy even as I sit and write this the lobby continues to stay full of satisfied customers. The lobby was impressively clean and so the the restroom.

4655506,2012-11-01,1,G9-OvE0PBQtDZmnGEB3HEQ,"On my way to Springs Preserve, I was about to stop off at Starbuck's for my caffeine fix. When I saw the sign for Einstein Bagels, I passed over Starbuck's.

  The fact that I passed over Starbuck's for Einstein Bagels is testimony that their coffee and value is better. For $2 more than Starbuck's, I brought bottomless coffee and a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Let me say that Einstein Bagel's Coffee is underrated. If I was to come up with a list of underrated places, Einstein Bagel's coffee would be on it. There were four blends of coffee, including Autumn Blend, Neighborhood blend, and decaf. I know that the  coffee is good when I pass over mixing in flavored syrup to add flavor to it. Regardless they fall short of the goodness of New York bagels, they come close. By the way, I recommend the toasted blueberry bagel.

    Whereas Einstein Bagels is a great value when you order a bagel with coffee, the value factor decreases when you order higher priced items. My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which I addressed in previous reviews, is not including a side item such as potato chips or potato salad with the sandwich. I believe that their customer base would grow if they included a side item.

   I have a mixed opinion as far as service. The employees were friendly at  the same time that it seemed understaffed. One employee juggling the order line and register line resulted in an extended line. Eventually the manager would help out at the order line. If I had an important place to be, it is strong possibility I would've walked over to Starbuck's.

   Because the lobby is large with lots of tables and windows, it is an inviting place to relax with a coffee and bagel. The noise level is average.

  I am not loyal to one bagel establishment. My mood will determine if I return to this location if I am in the vicinity of Decatur at Sahara.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,2,1,3,ZZWG-ogIcCFWlA2P0_M_VA

They need to have more employees or at least a manager who monitors the flow and who is willing to lend a hand when things get overwhelming. It took about 20 minutes to get my two bagels.

Which kind of sucked honestly because I had a drive back to San Diego and I stopped there thinking I'll just grab a quick bagel it will only take a couple minutes.
