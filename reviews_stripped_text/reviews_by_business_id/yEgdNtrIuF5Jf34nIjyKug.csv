I've yet to try this Pink's location.  Historically, I've been unimpressed with Pink's - I like the topping options but for me, the hot dog itself is average at best so if the dog ain't a star, who cares about the toppings ?

I went with a make your own - dog with mustard, grilled onions and relish.  Again, the dog is average at best - it tasted like a soggy farmer john dodger dog.  Also, a slight ding for too much relish.

I also ordered a three dog night to share with the gf later - 3 dogs, 3 strips of bacon, chili, cheese and onions.  Wolfed it down a few hours ago and the onion taste lingers !! I liked the chili, sadly - soggy dog x3; 

not sure i'll return.

2332106,2013-01-03,2,yEgdNtrIuF5Jf34nIjyKug,"Pinks is what I consider an overrated supposed legendary Los Angeles hot dog stand.  I don't like it much nor see what people see in it in Los Angeles, and most certainly wouldn't go ga-ga over it in Las Vegas, be it locals, visiting tourists or nostalgic LA folks.

I'd rate Carney's in LA way better, as well as Cantor's Deli (there's one in Treasure Island (TI) in Vegas as having better hot dogs, both char grilled.

The hot dog's at Pinks seems to be steamed or boiled, and the casing ends up looking a bit like a condom on a long lean phallic hot dog that lacks girth and is a bit pale and sickly in color.  Not so appetizing, 'tho seeing hot girls eat 'em can make 'em a bit more appealing visually...

I had the $2 Chili Dog, a Sunday Football Special they run for the Chili Dog that usually sells for shy of $5.  I'll say this... they should seriously consider selling the chili as a chili bowl separate.  The chili is tasty and good.  The hot dog or Chili Dog didn't do anything for me.  I'll disclaim, I'm not a huge fan to begin with of the ""mixed meats"" like Hot Dogs, Sausages, Bologna, Spam, etc. - - so, maybe this review is coming from a non-connoisseur of the ""tube steak""

I think this place does the job for the local sports book crowd 'tho, and I'd probably try their hamburgers, french fries and non-Hot Dog menu items.

Everything was just really blehhhhh.. And the service sucked. What made it more unappealing was the fact that their freezer they put the onion rings in was right behind the cash register, so when I saw him take the giant, possibly 20 pound bag of onion rings and drop some into the fryer, they were unappetizing from the start.

Hot dogs can easily be made at home.. it's just a bunch of toppings on a regular-nothing special- tasting hot dog in a nothing special tasting bun.

First off the polish was a nice size and very juicy but the toppings.. the toppings...  too much mushroom, onions and cheese. Waaaay way too much.  It was an interesting combination, but I will never get it again..

Located next to the race and sports book you will find Pink's. I always have to get a famous chili dog when at Pink's and something new. The something new was Chili Cheese Fries. Y-U-M!  I really like shoe-string fries so these are a real treat.

Don't expect to find the names of your favorite hot dog from the Hollywood location. A majority of the hot dogs have a Vegas themed name. So, check what comes on the hot dog because it might be your favorite but with a different name.

They have a variety of menu options and toppings. If hot dogs aren't your thing they have other super tasty options.

I have to admit, The prices are much cheaper at the Hollywood location so I have a hard time paying almost $5 for just a single chili dog. Since it is my treat and night to not think about calories though it is worth it. Right now with the current promotion during football, on Sundays you can get original chili dogs for just $2! Now that is a great deal. They have a nice *snap* when you first bite into them! 

They have different sizes of frozen drinks! I love that I can get a margarita! 

This is going to be a weekly spot for us. The food is good, the service is good and the place is very clean. The view of the big screen while you grub on completely appropriate sports food is awesome!

It didn't wow me since I have been to other places where they serve my fave hot dogs so I had high expectations to meet up to.  The dog was pretty loaded though - had enough chili, cheese, bacon strips, onions, and tomatoes but the taste was just average.  Difficult to eat without using a fork and knife since I couldn't fit my mouth around all the ""stuff"" loaded in the dog.  Just wondering if the Pink specialties would be better???

4014383,2013-12-31,1,yEgdNtrIuF5Jf34nIjyKug,"After a holiday stay at the Red Rock Hotel & Casino this past week, I finally got to try Pink's.  Nope, this place is not as close to Pink's of CA but I do appreciate them trying to expand their brand.  I'm giving it a 4-star rating because I thoroughly enjoyed their $2 Classic Chili Dog special during ALL football games.  How can it get much better?  Here's how to do it right:

1) Sit by a slot machine and get a $1 beer of your choice when the hostess comes around (I don't drink much...but when I do, I prefer Heineken LOL)

2) Take yourself to Pink's and get 2 $2 Classic Chili Dogs (I don't eat chili dogs much...but when I do, I prefer mustard and onions)

3) Enjoy yourself at a table while watching the game on the screens in the sports book right next door!

For just over $5 you've given yourself a meal that will tide you over the entire game.  Then you can drown your sorrows afterward with the money you saved but lost when you did that silly parlay of yours.  Hey, not my fault you chose them for the under.

I know a lot of folks give Pink's a 2 or 3-star but for me and for this special, I think a 4 is deserved.  My chili dogs were good:  soft bun, quality hot dog with lots of snap, chili with lots of flavor, and topped with mustard and raw chopped onions like I like it.
Pricing was great for $2 each, and service was friendly and fast.  I was in and out back to the game in less than 10 minutes.  

Yes, I lost my bet (damn you Philly) but at least I wasn't left hungry!  Just poor.  Damn poor.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,1,4,jucVCSsBjCy1tKOnPhZh_w
4052531,2013-01-13,1,yEgdNtrIuF5Jf34nIjyKug,"Let me start by stating that I enjoy an occasional hot dog every once in awhile. Maybe it's just me, but never understood all the hype with Pink's.  Whether it's Pinks in LA or PH, when it comes to their dogs they are just okay.  Minus all the toppings and all you really get a skimpy hot dog.  Keep in mind, I don't even think a Dodger Dog is any better.  In my opinion, 7-Eleven has better dogs at the fraction of the price.  There, I said it. 

All is not lost though.  The Non-Dog Menu is pretty good.  From their breakfast burritos to their burgers, all are priced just about right for what you get.  They even have a decent chicken sandwich.  Ironic, that they're known for their hot dogs, but I think they're overpriced junk.  But the other stuff on the menu is worth it.  By the way, their breakfast burrito is my favorite.  It's a pretty big serving with eggs, bacon, and potato wrapped in tortilla.  

As for the restaurant, it's located between the Sports Book and Poker Room. Located conveniently where you will find me when I am at Red Rock.  The restaurant is clean and really only gets crowded when a good game is going on (i.e 49ers playing).  You get a great shot of the big screen.  

I will still recommend Pink's if you haven't had it before.  You be the judge.  But if you been here before, try something other than their dogs.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,1,3,-qMCF6_0Oam7koeLi0HJAA

But recently the newest Pink's opened up at Red Rock Casino and it is getting favorable reviews. And I can see why. The quality is there. The menu is large. There is a lot missing from it when compared to LA but it does have a strong showing. They do have my favorite dog allbeit with a different name.  I like what they call a Red Rock Dog.

He was letting his hungry stomach guide him to making a stupid lunch choice. As I stood there and ordered that overly priced Chicago style combo meal I thought of the Pace salsa commercials. You know the ones where they ask where the other salsa was from and they said New York City. New York City? Yeah, you know the rest of that story. So as I sat down with my Pinks Chicago dog I'm thinking of the real deal I've enjoyed on many a day in downtown Chicago. My mind was recalling something wonderful, but the cheer from someone betting on the horses at the Sportsbook quickly snapped me back to reality and I took a bite of what was in front of me. And I quickly realized that yeah, the daydream of past experiences was so much better than what I had just shelled out $10 for! My combo was the LA version of a classic and it just sucked. Tough, chewy, bland, bleech! The toppings along with some passable fries and knowing if I didn't eat it would be awhile before I could again are the only things that kept me eating so my stomach would shut up.
