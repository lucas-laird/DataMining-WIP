The sauces that accompanied were a pleasant surprise though -- great steak doesn't need sauce, but when it does need it, it's nice to have a good selection. 

One thing to keep in mind, if you've ever been tempted to take up a restaurant staff's offer of taking a picture of you and your date over dinner.... don't do it here. It's standard practice to conveniently refrain from quoting a price until after they've already made the prints and put them in a nice folder, but brace yourself for JG. 70 bucks? Yeah, I'll pass on that one.",wmlsfi9DZ4KKGjL2RppusQ,2,0,3,XnmB3p-HH7e0eAwj5V3NGw

When we arrived we were sat quickly for a party of 8. 

Our waiter was kinda blah but he and his team did a great job keeping up with a table of 8. Drinks came out quick as they started us off with bread and butter. 

I won't speak for the other people at our table but I order the 12 oz. NY strip medium well. The steak was more like medium rare. I was steak did not have much flavor to it, however the sauces they provided were amazing. The sauces added lots of character to the steak. The steak come out warm to cool. I am used to a piping hot steak in Texas.

The table shared sides, the spinach was really good, lobster mash potatoes were amazing but there were only 4 small pieces of lobster in the potatoes, the macaroni truffle was amazing.

The ambience was really nice, dim lighting, good music, and classy.

We were not impressed with the dessert they provided for the Birthday's. I hate complaining when something is free but if that is the best they can do then they missed the mark.

Over all is was a good experience but when I am dropping that kind of money I expect a better steak and sides but I understand it is Vegas. I have had better at STK, Craft steak house, and Vic and Anthony's.",kR0o4TX0XI3HjsEbERlrqA,8,8,3,DPub5hhXz_-7aiX0aEdqkw

As for the food, the way their rice cracker crusted tuna was prepared was perfect!  I could taste the citrus without it overpowering the rest of the seasonings.  Dinner was served with a small plate of a variety of breads.  Each piece was a taste all on its own.  I found their chilean sea bass to be average, however.  The dish was supposed to be prepared with miso-yuzu glaze and it did taste like it but seemed a bit dry.  I've had better miso-yuzu glazed fish from Trader Joe's. So, paying $39 for it as opposed to a bigger, much tastier $8 prepared dinner from TJ's made the dining experience under par.

35447,2011-06-09,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"I read the reviews before coming here for a nice evening out with the boy. I was excited for some bomb ass steak and prepared for some less than stellar service. 

Minus one star for the front staff. It's a 5 pm on a Friday and the place is practically empty. Attitude AND 10 minutes to be seated? Give me a break.

We skipped appetizers and went straight for entrees. I got the NY Strip and the truffle fritters. The boy got filet minion and mashed potatoes. 

My boyfriend loved his filet minion. He said it was one of the top five steaks he's had in his life. For him, it was cooked to perfection. Also, I think he was more in love with his mashed potatoes than me, if only during dinner. I kid, he loves me way more than mashed potatoes! I admit, they were great: creamy and not too salty. 

My 16 ounce NY strip was a behemoth. I had it cooked medium and it was a great steak, but not top 5 for me. The truffle fritters were yummy, but a bit on the strong side. Then in a stroke of genius, I combined a piece of steak and a fritter and KABOOM. Perfection. Too bad I was going into a food coma at that point and only had about 3 bites left in me. 

We were also given a plate of the 4 dipping sauces and the steak come with a salsa verde. It's on the minty side, which I enjoyed. Of the 4 sauces I liked the hot sauce best (it's yellow). 

No dessert. Too full. 

Besides the food: we were seating along the edge of the restaurant along the wall, close to the bar...Nothing kills the mood like a blaring hockey game and bad hits from 2005. Really? 
Then about 10 minutes later, another couple was seated right next to us...awkward, considering there were at least 3 tables on either side of us that were empty. However, I did note that this is how they were seating everyone. Awkward times for everyone! 
Thankfully we were close to the end of our meal when a party of 4 were seated near us. They were the 55 year old versions of Jersey Shore. Loud. Obnoxious. Not even funny! At least entertain me if you are going to be that annoying. 

Ending on a happy note, our waiter was the bomb! John? Jim? Jake? Jeff? Jared? Jacob?...Steve? I feel bad for not remembering but he was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, etc. The best service I've had in a while. He's what really saved the day and this rating.",n2xGqfJOdUXuzGqY1tCUGQ,1,0,4,vVmnuclkbHMDumnY8VVNSg
39553,2016-09-18,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"A lot of choices in Vegas for upscale steak houses. A lot of good ones, and some that are overrated. Getting a good bang for the buck is really hard, not the town for that. My favorite is Jean George. Very cool interior with the black, red and gold, bathrooms are the best in LV. Vibe is totally vegas and great energy. Place is always rocking in-spite having of one of the most un-desirable locations inside of a major casino. Second floor? Who designs these floor plans. 

The bar is circular with some great HD screen sports action, very few places serves this high quality of food with the game on. I had event in the private dinning room, it was very nice and we had great privacy and service. The shell fish platters were a hit. I like to order some of the off-menu items like the Tomahawk Steak, Chateaubriand and Asian Ginger Lobster. The jalapeno garlic  mushroom are Jean George V at his best. Mix the hot sauce and soy miso better sauce, its awesome.

Reggie does a great job with the wine as the som and will find some hidden gems. Mike and Darren are great at service at the bar with cocktails/menu and Gary also knows his wine and the menu cold.

Big (-)...The music blasts.  This is a very nice dining room that has music piped in that might be appropraite in the bar in front, but not in the dining room.  It then causes the guests to have to raise their voices over the music to be able to cave a conversation at their table, all of it making for a very noisy dining room.

My uncle also got the Grilled Maine Lobster, which he shared a little with me. Both were superb! We both had steak the night before which is why we got seafood. For sides, we ordered the sautéed spinach and truffle mash potatoes. Both were good, but I think we will try new sides next time.

The only comment I have on the seafood was there was no bowl or spare plate for the crab and lobster shells. Please consider adding these so we have more room on our plates!

145601,2012-04-15,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Jean Georges, I have been waiting to try you and finally got my chance last night. We had a 7 pm reservation for Saturday evening and were running a little bit late. My husband called to let them know and they were very accomodating. 

We arrived and were seated right away. Our first waiter came out with the menus and the wine/cocktail list. I started out with a twist on a lemon drop and husband started out with a glass of scotch. 

They brought out a selection of bread but I only really tried the pretzel bread because it my absolute favorite. It was delicious and nice and soft.

We decided to go with two appetizers, the tuna tartare and the crab crostini. The crab crostini was to die for. Two crostinis loaded with dungeness crab mixture with a light dill flavor. The tuna tartare was a classic take and was very good. 

For the main entree we ordered the tomahawk chop which was a waygu/kobe beef hybrid. We also ordered the fritters, the mashed potatoes and the bone marrow and toast. 

The fritters were so good. They were perfectly fried, and nice and creamy in the middle with a spicy goodness from the jalapeano and cheese combo.

The bone marrow was really good! I had always wanted to try it and I liked it although on one of them, I couldnt get the marrow out, so that was a little disappointing. 

The mashed potatoes were nice and creamy with a good flavor. But had a little bit of a sticky texture. 

Now to the main reason JG's is getting four-stars instead of five. The tomahawk chop. This steak was 26 oz for $95 bucks. Hubby and I decided to share it. 
As soon as it came out I was wishing we had choosen something else. First of all, a lot of the 26 oz came from the huge bone. Ok, I can get over that. The waitress described the cut as very flavorful because it is marbled with fat. I didn't get that. I got huge pieces of fat on the end and the meat didnt seem too marbled. It was good but it was not great for $100. I was glad they served it with sauces cause honestly it was not overly flavorful. The people at the table next to us had the porterhouse and the filet and I was jealous. 

My husband has another glass of scotch and I had a glass of shiraz. 

The atmosphere was great and modern but the music was a little too loud. There was a photographer walking around and he took some really good pictures of us. I was kicking myself for not getting one this morning but I never asked how much they were cause he came back during a bad time during our meal. 

Overall our meal was really good, the atmosphere was nice and romantic, the cocktails were good and the service was excellent. 

I would like to come back again and try a few more things on the menu but it will have to be after we have tried some of the other steakhouses in Vegas.",rONMYLVdSph8OQBb27wDKQ,0,1,4,6HknYm4PyWEF58crVBoMBw

I eat out a great deal (I'm well into my quest to eat at every restaurant in Pasadena) but I actually don't write many reviews.

After my experience at Jean George Steakhouse this past weekend I knew I had to write something, so congratulations to them for getting my first negative review.

The service was on the low end of acceptable, but that is something I can live with if the food is good. Sadly, it wasn't. Except for the tomato soup: that was fantastic.

The bacon wrapped shrimp was too salty and greasy. The mashed potatoes were salty and very runny. The medium rare fillet showed up with a heavy char. These are very standard and simple to prepare dishes that I've had many other places and this is one of the reasons that I ordered them: they are a litmus test. If you use quality ingredients and prepare the dishes with care there's no excuse to not do them well. I mean seriously, who messes up mashed potatoes? Especially ones that cost $12.00.

I asked the waiter to bring the manager over and I described and showed him the food. I prefaced my discussion by saying that I wasn't doing this to get a discount, I wanted to let him know of some things that were going on in the kitchen and that I expected much better.  I didn't insist on new food as that really isn't my way. He thanked me and went off. He didn't return and the bill was for the entire meal. This is clearly one of the options open to him. As was offering to make me a new steak or taking the runny salty potatoes off the bill. Instead he chose the option that really prompted this review.

As I left the manager asked me to come again. Now why would I want to do that? This also showed a distinct lack of awareness or seriousness. I am telling my Vegas friends and traveling companions that we can do much better than Jean Georges Steakhouse.",UdnrF59yrL-5lb5K67j7Pw,13,0,1,nDI57hZ_mA8h9AZEBPWReg

Even the brownies were not so good.  Brio has better brownies than them.  Very Very disappointed.  We have eaten at many $$$$ restaurants and this is our least favorite.

We started with grilled octopus which had a great citrus flavor and an interesting sauce. We also had foi gras appetizer which by far was the high point of the meal. If you have never tried it and can get over the preparation, get it!!! 

Then came the steak...the one thing we were there for. The steak was just ok. Medium rare filet was slightly over cooked but I'm picky. It tasted fine though. The bone in ribeye was light on flavor. 

The one thing I found curious was the additional sauces that were served with the steaks. If your steaks stand alone or taste great with the marinade and spices they are cooked in why do you need extra sauce? 

I'm glad we went, I can say we would be back maybe only to eat the foi gras, which is a shame because this is a steak place.",kjwxPMJiWOJAp1FSxixnNQ,2,0,3,ckao6-F34__Zs1vvXtcZjg

Tuna Tartare - Avocado, Puffed Rice, Soy-Ginger Dressing 
Not really memorable.

Grilled Foie Gras, Terrine Apple-Jalapeño Marmalade, Grilled Country Bread 

Delicious. The foie gras just melts in your mouth and it is perfectly paired with the apple-jalapeno marmalade which helps cut the richness of the foie gras.

Seared Sea Scallop,Assorted Peas, Crispy Bacon, Lime  

Perfect, clean flavor. The scallops are cooked perfectly and everything is really fresh.

Wood Grilled Filet Mignon, Roasted Maitake Mushroom, Potato Butter

This was served with 3 sauces: Three Pepper Marmalade, Soy Miso Butter and Bearnaise. While the cut of meat and sauces were good I personally am not a fan of sauces with my steak. I like my steak to speak for itself. But worth trying.


Warm Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Ice Cream

291721,2014-08-10,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Old and dilapidated furniture with overpriced menu.

As I walked in the restaurant with my wife and daughter, I couldn't help noticing the wear and tear on the chairs and tables of this purportedly upscale restaurant. As soon as I sat on my chair I realized the furniture was not just old looking, it was very uncomfortable as well. The peeling wood laminate on the tables was an unexpected  cheap touch that only served as warning of the pretentious ways of this establishment.

Our appetizers were beef carpaccio, foie gras, and the bone marrow, which was the main reason for us going to JG instead of Mastro's. The foie gras was burned and insipid - without a doubt the worst tasting foie gras I have had. The carpaccio was a better appetizer but the amount of meat was below what other restaurants offer at similar price and quality of dish. My wife liked the bone marrow; since it is not something I enjoy much I will not comment on its taste.

We were debating whether to leave and go to another restaurant because at this point our expectations for our entrée, a tomahawk, were very low. Turns out we were right. The tomahawk completed the disappointment. We decided to pack the rest of the entrée and move our dinner to Mastro's, which has become a must visit every time we are in Vegas.

Btw, when I made the reservation, I told the hostess that our visit was to celebrate my wife's birthdate. The check came and went without any mention of the special occasion. 

We walked over to Mastro's  and had the escargot followed by the tomahawk, which was about $10 less than at JG. No comparison between the two restaurants. Service, comfortable seats, white new-like table cloth, beautiful decoration, and much better tasting food. We were able to compare the two tomahawks side by side. If Mastro's was a 10, JG's was a 7 at most.

When we walked in, we were asked if we were celebrating anything, I told them about the birthday occasion. After we were done with our entrée and without further direction, our waiter placed Mastro's signature dessert, the butter cake, with a happy birthday dedication on the plate - there was no charge for the butter cake.

We regretted ever setting foot on JG but were happy that we left to still enjoy dinner somewhere else. 

This review is not to recommend Mastro's, but to warn you about JG. There are restaurants that are worth spending $100 + per person where you will feel satisfied after your meal. JG is not one of them. 

I am in no way affiliated with Mastro's or any other establishment in Las Vegas.",_cbd1qZFH2fnN-l6jeSGnw,0,0,1,8CnzR4AIwpcFUgxtAqKagA
294218,2010-10-16,1,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"LOOONG overdue review as the last time I was there was in August.  

It was a last minute idea for our group of 4 to go and have some steaks before a night of hard partying.  

A friend and I decided to share the Tuna Tartare to start.  I have never tasted something so delcious!  The ingredients were combined beautifully and we devoured every last morsel.  The tartare was served with an asian prawn cracker (they call it puffed rice cracker)  and probably should've came with 2 crackers to even out the tuna to cracker ratio.  

The 3 of us opted for the 8oz Filet Mignon and our friend ordered the 18 Oz. Ribeye.  Let me tell you, I usually do not order the filet mignon but this one was to DIE for.  The meat was sooo tender and incredibly juicy.  I looooved the sauce that accompanied it (some green mint sauce).  The steaks were also served with a three pepper marmalade, soy-miso butter, bernaise, and a JG steak sauce.  I tried all sauces (I'm a saucy girl), but found myself to go back to that mysterious green sauce.  

For sides, we shared the black truffle & comte fritter, which was kinda like a lil jalapeno popper...but klassier, roasted royal trumpet mushrooms, and good ol' mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  All equally delicious, but the main star of the night were the steaks.  

My friend who ordered the 16 oz. ribeye took his leftovers home and we microwaved it and ate it the next morning.  It still tasted delish!  

We ended the night with coffee, tea and shared the warm chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake was warm and gooey in the center..kinda like a lava cake with yummy vanilla bean ice cream on the side.

Wonderful food.

Really, what more can one ask for at a steakhouse?

In a city with tons of choices, we were a bit skeptical when we visited this fairly new restaurant at Aria.  The smell of Aria is so annoying (what is that, Vanilla?) that we had to suffer through it all just to get to the restaurant.  But once inside, it's like a dark club.  The music is too loud, for sure.

But the food makes up for it.

The only reason we don't give it five stars is because a steakhouse should have a REAL Caesar Salad.  That means big chunks of Romaine, real anchovies, large slices of Parmesan, and real housemade croutons.  Here, the Caesar salad has none of these things.

The steak is seriously yummy.  We will return JUST FOR THE STEAK.  (What is it with the new trend of sending out sauces with steak?  Carnevino and CUT do this too.  We believe a great steak stands on its own, with salt and perhaps a little pepper only.  Please don't send out my seventy dollar piece of meat with balsamic something or another glaze.  And keep the soy whateveritscalled in the kitchen.  We want steak.  That's it.)",fitI0Br-NWP195YxwIcESQ,0,0,4,l3XUjJ04xMcBdWN8FgijJw

First time (when Aria just opened), our Cosmo concierge sent us there (and it was the only place that could accommodate our group on a short notice). Our first experience was great.

This year, what a different story! Let me start with the positives: décor still seems relevant, the meat is still good (though not amazing). Crab (though the tiniest of portions) tasted fresh and excellent. Tomato soup was very good.

Now the bad: the service! Water not refilled (see other reviews, all true, had to ask for it every time!). Salad and vegetable menu rather tired and uninspired. Tiniest and pricey side portions and humongous hunks of meat (even our biggest guys left at least half of their steaks on the table). My tomato salad had a loooong black hair in it (!). Disgusting.

A SEPARATE MENTION: our group consisted mostly of men, business associates, with healthy appetites. We all ordered a lot, appetizers, meats, etc. However, the waitress (a blond woman) stooped to harassment and kept pushing one of the guests, a young lady, to order something in addition to the soup she asked for. Our guest politely refused every push to order extra food, and the waitress was getting progressively more and more annoyed and showing it very clearly. She wouldn't quit pressuring the girl and almost drove her to leave. The waitress proceeded to be visibly annoyed whenever a less than the most expensive choice was made for any reason by any other guest. Only the fact that it was a company dinner and that I did not want to make a scene prevented me from contacting the management on the spot. Soon after, the waitress lost any interest in attending to our table whatsoever. She returned one more time to loudly inquire if the same young guest ""had finally changed her mind"" about getting more food (she did not). We were left to fend for ourselves and to seek help (like asking for utensils) from random busboys. No manager ever came by to check on our large group.

In short: food just OK, service a shame. We were left with the impression the restaurant couldn't care less. Spend your money elsewhere (like the superb Bazaar Meat which ended up costing us less and providing an amazing dining experience).",AwXmjZwiOtvMNQK_707b7w,6,2,2,z2usfo7X6pV0IcDIQdo3cg

The decor is novel yet stately, with a cute graphic of a cow's nose emblazoned all around, and the bar has a really cool vibe.

Bf and I arrived on thier second day of being open, in very casual clothing (think hoodies and jeans) and were told that there were no tables available (entirely booked, completely understandable), but we asked if we could get food at the bar, and the friendly hostesses said we could get the full menu there, so we went for it.

We were the only people in the restaurant in casual clothes (we looked really out of place) but the bartender treated us just as well as the businessmen in Armani suits. Our bartender was friendly and professional, and carried on just the right amount of conversation with us. It may have helped that we're locals who work in the industry, but my instinct is that the service is just very good. They had three beers on tap, Boddington's was one of them, I believe, but I was very thrilled to see that Delerium Tremens was also on tap (an exquisite beer from Belgium) so ordered a glass. Our bartender provided us with small dishes of cashews and buttery rosemary popcorn with fluer de sel on the side to munch on, a great touch. A server also brought around a basket of home-made breads, all of which were good, but the brioche made my day!

We split the roasted sweetbreads with chestnuts ($22) from the appetizer section, it came out presented nicely and had an intoxicating aroma, but was a very small portion (as can be expected). It was my boyfriend's first time trying sweetbreads, and he was pleasantly suprised by how good they were. The dish was small, but nicely executed, crisp on the outside, tender inside, buttery, nutty, with some shaved black truffles and either a bit of potato, or more probably some fresh water chestnut to play off of the other components.

We ordered a carmelized banana cake off of the dessert menu (I think $14 but I could be wrong) and it was sublime. The light, fluffy cake was topped with thinly sliced, carmelized bananas, and came with a quenelle of caramel ice cream (my mouth is watering thinking back to it), a tuille cookie, and something crunchy and addictive underneath (I think it was chocolate flavored puffed rice, but I could be wrong) bf practically licked the plate.

The other was a guy with a great sense of humor who would make quips as he left the room. I'd come back here just for that kind of awesome service.
The steaks were good. We all got filet mignon or ribeyes. Cooked really well and had a great flavor. It took the addition of some amazing sauces that were included to really kick it up to an interesting taste profile. The sides of truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus were equally as good. It was all really good - not exceptional though as other steakhouses in Vegas have been for me. The desert of the molten volcano cake (which was supposed to be a chef Georges original creation) was well prepared and an excellent cap to a good meal.
Anywhere in Vegas that employees servers of this degree deserves recognition. It makes the experience worthwhile and I'd go back to try some more there just to support them.

The Chairman of the Board provides the soundtrack.  I felt like I was over at the Wynn or the Bellagio with the music.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

My steak was ice cold when it arrived at the table.  After waiting for almost an hour and a half for our entrees to arrive, that sad slab of NY strip was just intolerable.  

Similarly disappointing: the quality of the ingredients they serve - they list their steaks as ""prime"" on the menu, but they're  wet-aged (not dry aged), a fact that is only revealed if you hound your waiter to admit it.  The lobster is rock lobster from Australia.  Hello?  We have perfectly amazing lobster in the States - it comes from Maine and it's far superior.  Last but not least:  Australian ""Wagyu"" (or ""wayygoo,"" as our waitress kept misstating) is not, in fact, the real McCoy.  These days you have to travel to Japan and/or have some serious import connections to find actual Kobe beef.

528009,2010-05-19,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Two of my coworkers and I visited Jean-Georges Steakhouse last week since we had resort credit at Aria that was setting our pockets en fuego.  We knew it would be pricey and expected the food to be delectable.  Both assumptions were proven to be accurate.

Decor is posh.  Lots of abstract cow faces all about the room (once you arrive, you'll see what I mean).  Also enhancing the decor is the group of constant gawkers standing in front of the restaurant who look at the menu and gaze inside, hoping to see a celebrity or otherwise rich person.

My meal was fantastic.  An uncannily delicious Caesar salad started my evening.  Lemony, light, and topped with fresh, mouthwatering Romano.  Maybe my favorite Caesar of recent years.  The freebie breads were also tasty, adding a nice bit of peripheral value to the high prices of the dishes.  Next came the main course - 12 oz. filet, cooked rare-med rare, with creamed spinach and some shared asparagus.  The steak was lovely - seared on the outside, warm and red middle, flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable.  My 12 ouncer was more like a solid pound of filet, thus keeping the enjoyment alive for a few more savory minutes.  The sides were both excellently prepared, with the asparagus being a wonderful surprise.  Simultaneously, I enjoyed a Hitachino Nest White Ale, a beer I'd never before tried.  This added another bit of happiness to an already memorable meal.

My only ""Eh, Not so Sure About This"" at Jean-Georges was the service.  Our primary server was attentive as is to be expected at both a high-end steakhouse and at a restaurant with only 4 other customers present (we went early).  On the other hand, the server's assistants were quite clumsy and made several fumbles during our meal.  For example, one assistant acted as though the thought of a split check was the Grand Unified Theory of particle physics and I'm fairly sure a tear came to his eye when I asked that unforgivable inquiry.  Additionally, one assistant poured a colleague's bottled beverage into the cups of the other people at our table who weren't enjoying this beverage, effectively mixing two things that did not mix and wasting my colleague's investment.

On the whole, I provide a strong recommendation for this restaurant.  I suggest going around 6:30; that way you beat the rush but can enjoy the show.  Viva!",kXwDkqmUfnDNePu8zfvxXA,1,0,4,LGxmzQt99tcLq4Y5v_4oVA

Though at $56 for an 8-oz. piece of beef (not even organic, mind you) one would expect side dishes to accompany. Not so. Cough up another $14 each for yummy truffled mashed potatoes or creamed spinach. The Caesar salad was the most uninspired I've ever had outside of an airport, with croutons that were clearly bulk packaged. A true embarrassment to the menu. The only redeeming factor was that the salad was cold - a nice counterpoint to the rest of my meal (and the only compliment I could come up with).

Now let me say that the food was really really awesomely good.  All 6 of us loved the appetizers, entrees and sides.  The service left something to be desired.  Our waiter and sommelier were great but the lag time between appetizers and entrees was over an HOUR.  The excuse we were given was that there was a wedding party that were served in front of us.  That is not an excuse for the kitchen to be slow in my opinion.  You are a high end restaurant, charging high end prices and we had a reservation.  You can't cook for two parties at once?  So after complaining to the manager, they were very nice and comped our bottle of wine and all cocktails consumed.  Which, my friends, was a pretty penny.  Now on to the delicious deets.

Appetizers-Crab cake and bacon wrapped shrimp.  One of the girls said this was the best crab cake EVER and practically licked the bowl.  I thought it was really good.  It's definitely not your typical crab cake.  The cake was all crab and it had a gingery broth underneath.  Very Nice.  Bacon wrapped shrimp was ""da bomb"" according to the men and it was very well cooked.  The bacon was crisp and shrimp not overdone.   Two in our party got the cobb salad and said it was excellent as well.

Entrees-Two of us had the rib-eye, which was super good and fatty.  My husband got the filet, which came out overcooked, but the new one was out within 3 minutes.  One got the veal, one got the sea bass (not a beef eater), and one got the special NY strip.  Each steak came with a chimichurri sauce, but they also served 4 sauces on the side with the entrees and the habanero sauce was super spicy but so goooood.  The sides we ordered were asparagus, sauted mushrooms and artichokes, creamed corn and mashed potatoes.  Everything was cooked perfectly and yummy yummy.  

No time for desert!  :(  We were already late due to the slow service.  Definitely someplace I'd eat again.",1xyBGpGp2jIn-OoB8kXRbQ,1,0,4,LCctOfNn_UT4Uv4Eq49AfA

I'm writing this review while going on 45min. waiting for the food to arrive, after ordering. Considering the price and level of the restaurant, the service and speed leaves a lot to be desired. 

Hold on, after convincing the waiter we deserved and expected to eat in under an hour, our order has finally arrived! Now about the food: Overall, very, very good. We started with the Caesar Salad which was excellent with a tangy Dijon/Caeser dressing. I had the ""slow cooked"" Salmon with a side of fries that I would definitely recommend. A note about the fries: The fries alone were very good, light and crispy. However they were served with plain old Heinz ketchup. Not a good move for a restaurant of this level. There seemed to be special sauces for pretty much everything, why leave out the fries? My wife had the Fillet Mignon. She had asked for it to be cooked medium well. After the waiter used the excuse that the order was taking a long time because the steak was ordered medium well, it showed up medium rare. Go figure... either way the steak was excellent as was the salt and pepper crusted baked potato. The steak came with a really interesting side sauce made from cilantro, mint, lemon grass and several other tasty ingredients. It was very good on the steak and I might add, really nice with my french fries. 

So when we return to Vegas which we do regularly, would we also return to Jean Georges Steak House? Nope. Nice atmosphere, good food but the service just isn't worth the price. By the way, after the waiter used an innocent steak as an excuse for slow service I decided to head back to the kitchen myself to check on our order, and maybe see if they could use some help to speed things up. My wife had the rare urge to restrain me so kept me from hunting down our dinner. My bet is that if the level of service continues as it is, some one Else's husband or wife will seek to encourage rather than restrain.",S5wUYv0edCp1jN47i1n-kQ,0,0,4,j6zw9nq1SfqIHEt4ip2C-Q

For the price of the meal (this place was not cheap by any means), I was extremely disappointed.   The steaks were cooked to the requested temperature, but something was lacking in taste of the meat.  On an upside, they do provide a basil-butter sauce on the side (that was really good) and really allowed each bite to be more memorable.  

Two side notes on side dishes:

1) We had to send back the cream of spinach.  We had 3 orders and all the orders were excessively salty, to the point it was unbearable. They had no problem remaking the cream of spinach, but when it came back it seemed like the cream of spinach was slightly running/watery. Did they remake it or just dilute it out????

2)  The single highlight of this restaurant was the side order of the truffle balls (don't know what it was exactly called).  It was ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN beyond delicious.

   We arrived for a 9:45P reservation on Friday night (New Years Day), had a round of Caipirinhas, which were excellent (and potent), then were promptly escorted to a corner table for our party of 5. The decor was modern and warm, but not wow-ing. 
   We ordered the following appetizers:
1) Fresh Oysters: Decent oysters, not off the San Francisco peer or anything, but good nonetheless. Garlic/vinegar sauce was nice to go with.
2) Sweet Breads: My first time trying these, therefore no real comparison on quality. I enjoyed this dish.

Entrees: Steaks (of course)
Porterhouse Steak: Probably one of the best cuts I've had in a long time. A generous portion of fillet, to go along with a good looking New York strip, this porterhouse was only simply seasoned and cooked perfectly. The porterhouse was a 24 oz. cut/$60. I would highly recommend this dish.

Rib-Eye:
   Others in my group had bone-in rib-eye steaks which they thoroughly enjoyed (as revealed through the shiny bone left on the plate when finished), also simply seasoned. As a further note, instead of traditional market steakhouses, freshly made in-house sauces were prepared. Each was interesting and added to the experience, however, nothing really added more than enjoying the steak as is, simply seasoned. 
   The downside of the experience at this restaurant came with the side dishes. The portion per side dish sparingly served two people and was extremely pricey for the quality of the side dish. For example, I believe 7 pieces of asparagus with a bit of garlic and lemon cost $14 per plate. Servings of mashed potatoes were small as well. The side dish of mushrooms was excellent, but also quite small. Honestly, I was expecting the restaurant to be less stingy with these dishes. 
    As for dessert, we had a run of the mill chocolate lava cake and a really interesting, delicious japanese citrus and white chocolate sorbet. This dessert was a nice combination of sour and sweet and was unlike any sorbet I've had before. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the fruit that was used.

Where do I begin.
Well, after reading some reviews on yelp, and considering that we are guests at Aria, we decided to try out their steakhouse Jean Georges.
Sigh.
Where do I start?
The overall meal was horrid.  We were seated next to a few ladies, one of which was talking very loudly of how she had gone on a date with an ex-football player of the Cleveland Browns?  She was talking about how he wasn't the smartest/sharpest tool in the box.
So annoying.  Unnecessary and annoying.
Like what do I write here?
Should I write about how salty the steaks were?  SALTY.  We were flabbergasted but tried to eat it as much as we could. 
Ugh.
40-50 dollars a steak which was inedible due to the enormous amount of salt.
My fiances steak was very rare when she had asked for medium.
The thing that was most upsetting was when we decided to complain to our server she said she would talk to the chef and we figured something might have been done.  Free desert, no charge for the rare steak,etc., but absolutely nothing was done.
She came back to the table, asked if we would like dessert as if nothing was wrong.  We were clearly upset and said no and just asked for the check which she gave at that time.

I opened the check and saw that nothing was done and that..  ..The CHECK was as is.

Shaking head. I asked to speak to the manager, and thankfully, she took out the filet mignon.  We were just upset, because our server could have spoken to the manager to alleviate the situation, but we had to take the matter into our own hands. 

Overall, The STEAKS were very salty.  They might as well pack the steak in salt and serve it to you.
The STEAKS were cooked poorly.  Red rare for a medium steak.
The server could have made us less mad had she done something about the CHECK before bringing it back to the table.
We'll never be back and we don't recommend you waste your money here. There are plenty of other great steak houses in Vegas.",9quOxCGzE6YMqp1fNoxkvw,2,1,2,Ev57CwL09kMf6VSnTJkLBA

This first course was so delicious, we ordered another round.  For the main course, I ordered the 18 oz ribeye and my wife the 10 oz filet.

These sides were amazing!  The sides actually out performed the steaks.

The only thing keeping me from giving Jean Georges Steakhouse 5 stars is my personal preference for broiled steaks over wood-fired steaks which are served at Jean Georges.    I highly recommend Jean Georges Steakhouse.",Ti9EviGWLeDKu34SEdxZjg,1,0,4,q9GfuxYQj82GRqj5oa3NWw

Next cocktail moscow mule...hmmm they used a ginger syrup instead of ginger beer. Hollerrrr!!! Love love love!! Great service at the  bar....they weren't very busy at the bar but the rest of the restaurant seemed a bit full. I decided to go with the burger with brie and fries and a side of mayo.  I decided not to go with the filet because I thought it would be too much food. So I think the burger was $25 or $26 and it came with truffle fries and some kind of truffle mayo I believe and the burger had brie and yuzu pickles on it. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare. They brought my side of mayo and had gone to the restaurant next door to get it which I thought was nice. The fries came in a small black iron dish with truffles on top...not impressed. I ate around them. I just wanted fries...normal fries. These fries were short and small. I could barely dip them in my mayo and ketchup....ugghhh.  The burger....I am a huge fan of pickles...nice kosher pickles...maybe a little spice to them. These were awful. Didn't taste anything like a pickle. The brie...I love brie...love love love brie, but not on this burger. The meat was dry. I think it was medium rare...looked kinda medium. The place was kinda dark so I couldn't really tell.  Overall, very disappointed with my $25 burger and fries.

Most dishes dishes were ""good"" with the exception of our Wagyu tenderloin & dessert.  Although the steaks were cooked to order (medium-warm pink) we thought the seasoning was overly salty.  The beef itself was dry/tasteless, not juicy at all -Perhaps this accounts for the over done salt.  I'll have a much better steak at Fleming's or Ruth Chris.  I expected something "" more"" here with the Wagyu tenderloin.
The Sommelier was spot on with the wine pairings.  My only complaint is that there is too much wine per ""tasting"".  It was at least a 4oz pour with the wine -times four -including Champagne & Madeira. We had to ask the server to slow it down as they were bringing the glasses for the next tasting before we could finish the last wine.  This was our second wine pairing dinner and I think it will be our last as it is too rushed for the quantity of wine.  The dessert of chocolate mousse & mint ice cream was a ""Fail"".  The mousse was dense & dry.  Ice cream was tasteless/icy & ""crumbly"". Chocolate wafers, chocolate cookie crumbs, and crunchy chocolate pearls-way too much.

From the moment you walk in you notice the muted colors and glowing walls. We had made a reservation and were seated promptly. (Some reviews mentioned don't even bother walking in without one!)
The service was generally good and helpful. We ordered the JG burger and ribeye steak along with a bottle of wine, black truffle comte fritters and lobster mash potatoes.
Overall, this was a very good burger but it lacked the ""wow"" I was expecting given the price and the fame of the chef. It was prepared just as I requested and arrived nice and neatly presented. The meat was flavorful, juicy and glowed with that wonderful medium rare pinkness. The bun was nice and fresh, but perhaps fewer sesame seeds could be better (there were a lot!).
The burger came with delicious fries and for once I didn't even have to ask for ketchup! In short, the burger was quite satisfying, definitely one of the better ones I had, but once again, it didn't quite amaze me which I had hoped for. Even so, paired with wine and the other sides we ordered, the burger made a very good dinner.
The ribeye was similar, well prepared, delicious and savory but short of amazing. The sides were perhaps the best part of the meal and the most savory. The restaurant certainly lives up to its $$$$ rating so be prepared to spend.

As per the reviews, the restaurant decor and ambience was great and because it's expo week the place was filled with people. 

There are a lot of steak places in Vegas and I've visited a couple. Like I said I was apprehensive based on all the reviews but for a steakhouse it really just boils down to the steak for me. 

I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye and it was done to my preferred medium rare perfectly. Great cut and texture with good marbling. I think the spiced up butter served with the steak was pretty good and they've alone provided an array of sauces for you to try. I'd stick to the butter as everything else seems to over power the meat. 

Ordered the Lobster Mash Potato and the Truffle Mac&Cheese as sides. To be honest they're ok, if I could reorder I think I'd stick an honest baked potato or hand cut fries. Lobster Mash was a touch salty for me and the truffle Mac and cheese was basically what the name describes.

The filet was good, for a filet. It was cooked properly. The grilled mushroom that came with it was pretty good. The desert item was one of those chocolate lava cakes w/ ice cream.

The ingredient was excellent. Certified Kobe beef was delicate and juicy, the dried age steak as good meat flavor, the prime filet was tender, lobster was fresh. However, the preparation failed the ingredient.

Overall, the food was too salty, taking away the flavor of the meat. Kobe and other good cut of beet only need light seasoning to bring out the meat flavor, but instead the salt over powered all other senses. Part of the steak was also unevenly charred.

In addition to steaks, I also ordered the miso Sea Bass. The fish was overcooked, over salted, and edge of one side was charred. 

Ironically, the best feature of the night was the Tristan Lobster tail. Normally at a steak establishment, ordering seafood comes with some risk. This ""steak addition"" however became the saving grace of the dinner.

Unfortunately as the evening marched on, I learned that it was not going to happen.  Our food was sub-par.  The foie gras was okay.  The bread was heavily buttered.  My plate was very greasy the moment I laid the bread piece down.  Unfortunately, this made the already rich course even denser.  The lobster caesar (a special request) was plain, but decent.  My girlfriend and I ordered the New York and filet mignon respectively as our main courses.  They were perfectly cooked, but UNBEARABLY SALTY to the point that they were inedible.  When I complained about the entree to the waiter (slightly over-weight, 30-ish, and bald), he said, ""I am sorry you feel that way"" and walked away.  I could have raised a storm and complained even further, but I decided it was not kosher to cause a scene. 

After drinks and dessert, my tab was ~$330 for 2 people.  Now ask yourself this... would you pay that much for a watered-down version of a Jean Georges restaurant with poor food and service?  If you crave for a Vongerichten restaurant, treat yourself to a flight to NY and eat there.

==== UPDATE ====

I received a message from a dummy account -- which might have been from an employee or someone related to the restaurant -- attempting to shoot down my review.  Here's what he/she wrote:

""The consistency of this review is totally inacurate. JG had never had a lobster caesar, and hostes don't present dinner menus either, the server does."" -- Ramon L.

I responded...

""Before you claim a review is inaccurate, note that your experiences and opinions may be different from mine.  In my case, the hostess planted our menus on our plate.  Our waiter was not even prepared to greet us until a couple of minutes later as he was fussing with two other staff members near the back cashier.  Even if the hostess was not trained to hand us our menus properly, this does not excuse her unprofessional demeanor during the entire greeting process.

Also, the lobster caesar was a request -- it did the job, but it was not special or elevated.  I edited the review to make a note of the 'special request' to avoid further confusion.  Also, if you are questioning the validity of my review, I have photos on my cellphone ([two] of which are uploaded on Yelp!) and a credit card bill. ;)""",_8IVQIPsF5te1_JNFmGtSQ,75,56,1,B4YcCewfZMS8GwH7lJOHgA

I had the signature tasting menu with the wine pairings, which went a little something like this....

Course 1: Caviar in an Israeli lemon peel with creme fraiche, paired with Varnier-Fanniere Grand Cru, Cote des Blanc Champagne.
Course 2: Tuna tartare with avocado and radish, a sesame dressing and a rice cracker, paired with a 2004 Jo Pithon Chenin Blanc.
Course 3: Creamy burrata salad with a honey crisp apple, concord grape and pomegranate, herbs, a sesame and sunflower seed cracker with an ice wine vinaigrette, paired with a riesling from Mosel, Germany
Course 4: Diver scallop with baby bok choy, trumpet mushroom, micro basil with an aromatic butternut squash reduction poured tableside over it, paired with a Darioush, Voigner, Signature Napa Valley Chardonnay
Course 5: 6oz Australian Wagyu beef filet with a soy marinade, japanese radish and a crispy kale chip with a lavender mustard, paired with a 2011 Quintessa Cabernet Sauvignon from the Napa Valley.
Course 6: Chocolate and peanut butter cup sundae with a concord grape sorbet, topped with whipped cream, paired with a 1989 Kopke Port

My favorite was the Wagyu, it was so melt in your mouth amazing!!!  Everything was absolutely delicious though!

1187410,2014-03-01,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Went to Jean Georges while staying at Aria for the Microsoft Lync conference. This was a truly great experience. We had a party of 8 without reservations, and as with all high end places, had to go through the rigmarole of them checking to see if they could fit us in, even though once we were sat there were empty seats everywhere. It's on the very high end price-wise, so I'm sure this drives away a lot of folks.

The atmosphere inside is very chill - very low lighting, dark woods, and some cool art features on the walls. There is an impressive wall of wine at the back of the restaurant. So after a short wait, we were seated and a host of different servers started attending to us. For their drink menu, they use a custom iPad app to allow you to scroll through the various drink menus and wine list. Cool concept, but since you can't view everything at once like you would normally on a menu, you have to use a filter/search function which was not built well. A regular menu would probably save a lot of time. With that said, we eventually found a couple bottles to our liking.
 
Their specialty is steak, and this is what everyone in our party ordered. They have some really over-the-top options as you would expect. The special of the night was a wagyu steak at $209 - no one touched this one. On the menu itself, the most expensive was the porterhouse at $109. I ended up going with the 16 oz dry aged ribeye at $66. One of the guys had the standard 18 oz ribeye at $62 which I sampled for comparison. If I ever go again, I'll opt for this one instead of the dry aged. Though the dry aged is bit more tender from the grass-fed beef and contained less marbling, it just wasn't as juicy and flavorful as the standard one from what I tasted. Sides were also very good. I like frites with my steak, and theirs were great. 

They did brutalize one of the guy's steaks. He had ordered it mid-rare and it was quite well done. That seemed very unusual - we assumed the server grabbed someone else's plate as everyone else's were spot on with the temperature.
What put the meal over the top in my opinion was the accompaniment of sauces. Each steak comes with a salsa verde sauce which was phenomenal. Then our server also brought out all of the other 4 sauces you can order from the menu. This is the way to go - try them all - very unique and adds some great flavoring to the steak.",fn_ZJaLBTeKzh92_3LEfrA,1,1,5,D3DSvspLQI5m8zu9UQkbIQ

1231356,2017-12-20,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"I really wanted to write an exceptional review for this steakhouse, but unfortunately cannot. The expectations were high upon entering.  Darker environment typical of a fine steakhouse.  Wonderful selection of wines, great attentive staff.  

Started with a nice cold seafood platter appetizer, then a great salad.  Then it was on to pick what should be the star of the show in a steakhouse, a steak.  With selections ranging from grass-fed filet to a Wagyu tomahawk for two or even grade A5 Kobe beef there should be something for everyone.  Turned out that both myself and my friend settled on a dry-aged bone-in New York.  Added a side of asparagus and a starch and we were all set.  Upon arrival the star of the evening looked great.  Appeared well cooked and ready to enjoy.  That's where it went bad. 

Upon cutting into the steak it was immediately evident that this wasn't going to be good.  The first (difficult) cuts were into large sections of fiber and fat.  Okay, fine.  Fat adds flavor after all. As I continued I found the steak to be incredibly difficult to cut, let alone chew. There was also a distinct lack of flavor which seemed very odd. My friend decided to not say anything and while I wanted to, I couldn't help myself.  I explained the situation and was told that ""maybe it was the dry-aging process that's different and I simply wasn't used to it.  The process sets out the meat and can make it tougher.""   Hmm. I responded that I've had many dry aged steaks and the explanation was exactly opposite of what it should do.  The process concentrates flavor and tenderizes the meat.   We reached a point where they decided it was maybe a bad cut...let's try another. Okay. 

Round two;  second steak arrives and looks nice as well.  It's a cleaner cut and initial impressions are positive.  Until I start (trying) to cut into it.  I soon reached the same conclusion. Inedible.  I left 90% of an expensive steak on the plate and was done.  :( Could barely cut into the thing let alone chew it. 

The gentleman clearing the plates was surprised and wanted to bring a box.  I told the server and she had little to say except for the dry-age explanation which is not right.  Manager came over offering apologies and the same reasoning.  Disappointing for sure. 

Now maybe, just maybe I'm wrong about the aging process.  It I have been fortunate to enjoy many dry-aged cuts and this was the worst experience ever.  My friend who decided not to say anything because he is a super nice guy, wishes he would.  It was not just my steak. 

And here is a small snippet from one of the many easily available descriptions of dry-aging. ""The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture.""

What a shame.  I only gave it several hundred dollar meal two stars for the staff and the starters.  We should have stayed with our first stop at Herringbones, but the only table available was right next to a large and loud private party.  Oh well. 

I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere. Many great choices very close by.",3hUNibsE0S0o72oETe_EwA,2,0,2,ESrg1QqMT0PUkS9ibwvjEg

I didn't want to embarrass my gf so I just bit my tongue and let it go. As a consequence of this establishment I sat the next day and night in my room hating life.

Our waiter was not good. Don't know how else to say it. The lowlights included us having to ask for him to come to the table to get drink orders as he never greeted us. Him forgetting drink orders throughout the meal requiring us to remind him. Asking for him again to come take our orders. Having to ask for bread 35 mins after being sat. Etc, etc, etc. Just an overall lack of being a quality waiter. Our meal took 2.5 hrs and that was not because of us. And not that I mind as I understand it's policy at many places, but the restaurant put the auto 18% gratuity on top of it for the crappy service.  We are at Lavo (great dining, service and atmosphere) and when we told our waiter there about our JG experience, he said that the dining room service is known to be bad at JG. Could have used that advice the day before. So now you have it, there are too many great steak houses to waste your time here. 

As for the food, half our table was very happy with their meals. Those with the filets thought they were great. Those with seafood likes their meals. The ones with the ribeyes were extremely disappointed. Tough, very fatty just poor quality. Honestly I had trouble cutting my ribeye with the steak knife. That should not happen. I buy ribeyes from my local grocery store and they are way better than what this place served. It's hard to F up a ribeye, but somehow this steakhouse did. 

So there you have it. Find another steakhouse and avoid this place. You might get good food, you might not. But the service is probably going to be poor and that's just not acceptable for premium dining when there are so many Vegas options.",cEUbxvWQ8irpHUzBGn_dlA,3,0,2,vfTr27NNtA_F2iCrdC86Iw

About the side dishes. The sautéed corn, trumpet mushrooms, truffle mac and cheese were all delicious and beautifully seasoned - every bite was a ""wow"" moment.

We also could have done without the lobster mashed potatoes (which was really just creamy potatoes with 3 small lumps of lobster).

I've eaten at the Jean-Georges in NYC for lunch several years ago and remembered having a great experience.  So I thought we give this place a try since it's new.  Although, we already know how hard it is to find any steak place better than Mastros or Cut.  But I'm still waiting to find something that I can is better...which Jean-Georges Steakhouse did not even come close.

It's a really nice place.  I love the decor.  From the moment we spotted the restaurant outside with the amazing decor at the entrance until we were seated at our table, I was truly impressed with the design.  However, I didn't really like the way the tables were set-up.  Considering it was V-day, we were seated right next to two other tables and really didn't get much privacy.

For appetizers, we shared calamari and bone marrow.  This was literally the best calamari I've ever tasted.  The batter was very light and crisp and it was accompanied by a tasty mayo-like dipping sauce.  The bone marrow was decent, but I have to say Cut and Charlie Palmer prepares this dish much better.  The toast that came with the bone marrow was good though.

We shared an 18 oz rib-eye and selected the bernaise and soy-butter miso sauce on the side.  The steak was cooked to perfection...I really haven't seen a medium rare steak cooked that way before.  It was very juicy and tender, but it lacked the flavors found at our fav steakhouse - Mastros.  Each steak comes with their house special sauce...which tasted somewhat like salsa verde.  

The drinks were good and strong.  After two cocktails, we were both feeling quite tipsy. :)

Nonetheless, I am still a fan of Jean-Georges and will continue trying his other restaurants.  However, I'm not sure if I really care to return to his Las Vegas location.

We were so full after the apps we all had leftovers and I forgot to take pictures! Based on my party they loved the steak, the salads, I believe they also had bone marrow. All the sides were good as well. For my entree I have 4 King crab legs and was already full from the seafood tower. Yum",RMFjlkFYl_u529nP6FoQBw,1,1,5,lr6ujCONFpl2cxavn0gLRw

Everything we ordered was delicious!  I ordered the NY steak and had a plethora of sides to choose from: spinach, tare tare, black truffle fritter, lobster mash AND ROASTED BONE MARROW (worth EVERY ARTERY CLOGGING BITE).

As a local, it is my overall favorite property. I love the bars, I love their casino floor and I always eat at Bardot (another place I love). This past Saturday Night, I ventured to Jean Georges for the first time, a place I usually stare at when I eat at Bardot. From the second I walked in, I was greeted by a hostess with a big, warm, sincere, engaging smile, welcomed by their Manager ""Pano"". Pano walked me to my table (beautiful spot) and oversaw evey step of phenomenal service. He introduced me to their server Ramon who was and is outstanding (there was another server whose name I forgot and I wish I hadn't because he was just as outstanding and attentive as Ramon). Pano, big as a tree and whose personality and warmth equal his stature introduced me to their Som, Reggie, who guided me thru an extensive and I mean EXTENSIVE wine list (I only drink French). The food? The porterhouse, the Sea Bass and the Calamari (which was the best calamari I have ever eaten and Im from the guinea capital NYC) were amazing.  I have been in hospitality my entire life and I am a local small business owner (I own a restaurant/bar with gambling) was this: I ordered an appetizer, am amazing seafood platter so to speak that was mounted, a server was walking  by my table right near closing (that is relevant after someone just worked a full shift), he had nothing to do with my table and from the corner of his eye he saw that the ice melted and the water was rising and he didn't want the water to spill on my table? Ladies and Gentlemen, THAT IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL. You cannot teach this. Im jaded in this city. In 3.5 years, the food in this city is great however the service is atrocious. Jean Georges? Arguably one of the best meals, one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in my life.

Several folks here have commented on the music...I think they need to have a different selection.  I am not sure what 17 yr old emo kid programmed their songs, but change it up.

The atmosphere is luxurious, intimate and dim. We had a reservation at 7pm for a group of 9 girls on a Saturday evening. There really wasn't a need for a reservation as the restaurant wasn't packed, but better safe than sorry. Some people tend to dine there before a show. Our waiter was kind to ask if we were in a time crunch for a show. We were not, but if you are, they can notify the chefs to expedite your meal to catch your show. 

Anyway, everything was above my means, but when in Vegas, I must dine well. I opted for filet mignon, but there are two options with a $2 difference - 1) 8 oz filet mignon 2) Paso Prime Grass Fed Beef 10 oz filet mignon.

I don't know the difference so I went for the cheaper option - 10 oz. It had a nice char on the outside and it was a nice medium rare. However, the exterior was very salty and a bit tougher than I expected. I was a bit disappointed by that. 

SIDES ARE NOT INCLUDED

The sides are small, but very rich and creamy. It's best to share if you can. We went with Truffle Mac n Cheese ($18) and Truffle Mashed Potatoes ($20). 

Would I come back here again? Most likely not. With the sides shared, a $50 a-ok steak and a cup of coffee to cap my meal, I nearly dropped a bill on myself.

Appetizers:
Shrimp Wrapped in Bacon was good. Nothing to really write about good.

The Raw Oysters were fantastic, but for the repetitive broken shell fragments. Has 6 and 5 had this problem. The schucker needs to take property time and this would not have been a problem.

Main Courses.

12 once NY Strip perfectly cooked. Nice Steak. Nothing to state that it was the most amazing, because it wasn't. It was good. Good at 54 dollars? No.

Veal Maleness - good although to me the Veal wasn't the best cut.  

Sides were:
Mushrooms, excellent but for the hot peppers which overwhelmed the taste of the mushroom. 
Creamed Spinach - Bland
Mashed Potatoes - Very good

Deserts were good.

Service excellent

Again and again, the Aria fails in the culinary area. Beautiful property, but the restaurants. The Aria needs to examine top side down where the property is obviously failing. I would first shake up the top three in charge of the culinary leadership. Then, hire the right leaders as the restaurants just fail at the Aria all too often.

Yes this is a strong 3 star, but really a 3 star is a failure.

Their cuts, their food, their wine list: all notable. I would have given them a 5 star review even if the service was average.

The ambiance is sexy, modern, unique, mysterious... very pleasing to the eye.  And the menu has enough to tantalize even the pickiest of palates.

Their crispy sushi plate was pretty amazing. Salmon, Tuna, and i think yellowtail...  so good with a crunchy texture underneath.  Pretty delicious. 

The truffle mac and cheese was to die for.  the steaks were moist and delicious.

That tomahawk steak (australian wagyu hybrid) soooooooooooooooooooooo amazing and juicy.  And huge.  Definitely share able.

Anyways... the servers treated us like they never close. Not at any point did I feel rushed. And every request was handled quickly and with gravity.

We stayed in Aria SS for like 2 nights while our parents somewhere in the jungle of cards.

Checked in for dinner. We all dressed very casual, meaning shorts and t-shirts. I heard that this place has Wagyu Kobe Beef. We came here for that purpose only.

Here it is.

1. Calamari = It was decent calamari. This is the kind of calamari appetizer I would like to find in other places. Crispy, crunchy, and chewy.
2. Tuna Rice *something* = It was probably one of the best appetizer that I have ever got in my life
3. Maine Lobster Tail = It was one of the entree we chose. It was very light. I didn't expect the lobster to be cooked so well and perfect. The sauce was perfect. I found that there was a hint of coriander in the sauce. The sauce was light too.
4. NY Strip Wagyu Kobe Beef - It MELTED in my mouth. One of the best meat I've ever eaten. We ordered 4 oz which costed $19 per oz. It was worth it. The flavor in meat was not overpowering the texture of the Wagyu beef.
5. Filet Mignon Wagyu Kobe Beef- THIS IS AN ORGASM! The three of us sample this delicacy, and we all agreed that this was the BEST FOOD ORGASM ever. The meat melted in your mouth. It was so juicy, tender, and you name it all. It was ORGASMIC
6. Filet Mignon Steak - Okay, after having that orgasm in your mouth, this meat tasted like rubber? The flavor was well thought of. I like the flavor. 
7. Dessert, Coconut Ice *something* ANOTHER ORGASM!!!!!
8. Side Items .Grilled Asparagus, The best ASPARAGUS GRILLED EVER!!! It was $12 for 6 sticks of asparagus. 

The service 

This what makes me take off one star from Jean-Georges Steakhouse. The waiter did not take us seriously at first when we order 9 oz worth of Wagyu Beef.  The waitress wasn't that attentive with us.

We arrived about 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, where the hostess checked us in and informed us that they were seating at scheduled times and invited us to sit at the bar or in the area outside.  We didn't mind and returned about 5 minutes beforehand where the three hostesses just smiled and looked at us and went on talking to themselves.  We finally had to interrupt them and ask when we would be seated as it was past our reservation time.  Surprisingly, the hostess said ""oh, why didn't you check in...we were wondering to ourselves why you were standing there and why hadn't we checked in"". I kindly reminded her that we had checked in 20 minutes before...we received some lame excuse about the system being reset.  Neither she nor the other 2 hostesses could be bothered enough to ask whether we needed anything and let us stand there for almost 10 minutes.

Our experience did improve a bit after being seated in a fairly empty restaurant and our server was very friendly, although the time between courses was fairly long.

I will say my husband's short rib dish was excellent and did not disappoint.  My sea bass, while cooked well, was drowning in the soy-yuzu glaze and could have been any piece of fish at that point.

A $70+ steak should be cooked correctly. It was a shame because the next night we had to go somewhere else to make up for the poor experience at what we thought would be a high caliber meal.

People on yelp are NOT joking or being rude saying that the customer service is terrible, because it is.  I was in a party of 8, one big table in the corner with a great view, and we had 2 servers.

For this price I don't believe it is unreasonable to want choice or better. Also the sides are priced too high for the portion or quality ($10-$16). Finally the salad or soup is also priced beyond what other comparable restaurants charge, $18 for a side Caeser.

Definitely situated in one of the best places at Aria.  This place definitely looks very hip and sheik  and the food is definitely off the hook. 

Bridget our server.... How can I tell you this without sounding rude, I have gotten better service at Denny's.  

One of the reason's why I didn't rate this higher is for the simple details:
 
When ordering the 5 main course option, make sure you get #2 to the right table not the couple next to us.  

Next check in, when we pay for these 95 dollar plates we want a smile and the ever so cheesy ""how was your tartare?"" It just makes us feel warm and fuzzy that you pretend to care.  

Lastly how about you swap out the silver ware throughout the course so my fork isn't tasting like avocado when I am eating my scallop's. Foul! 

Oh yeah then there's the pictures guy, really? Who the hell is this gypsy selling pictures and trying to up sell you pictures when you are trying to enjoy a great dish... Really?

Outside of these slightly foul balls, I would definitely give this place another shot and will probably ask for another server.

This is NOT your typical run of the mill steakhouse that serves the same old chops, mac n cheese, wedge salads, and shrimp cocktail. This is MUCH more!
As you would expect, the steaks are fantastic. The kobe is to die for, but can put a major dent in the wallet. I suggest splitting a few ounces amongst the table for the experience alone, you can cut it with a spoon and it melts in your mouth. The accompanying sauces with the steaks are ridiculous. Sure a steak should speak for itself (and they certainly do here), but you are missing out if you haven't tried the soy-rice wine sauce. All in all, the food here exemplifies culinary mastery in terms of creativity, balance, depth, and quality choices of ingredients. From the oysters, to the hamachi, to the salads, to the steaks, to the dessert, you will not be let down. They also have a pretty impressive wine list. Eating here makes Mastros, Mortons, the Palm, and all your tired cookiecutter steakhouses look like a big waste of time, money and calories.

The restaurant was not decorated in the normal steakhouse design. They have cool images of a cow's nose running throughout the place. It was cool and dark with a modern edge. 

The service started out stellar and continued that way. We had two servers for our table of two. They were very knowledgeable and quick to respond to our needs. They provided great recommendations for food. The sommelier was good. I felt she got a good feel for what we were looking for and provided a good bottle. 

We started out with drinks and I heard no complaints. I had the cucumber-gin drink. A little sweet, but still really good. 

We got 3 starters to share; grilled foie gras, rice cracker tuna and a mozzarella dish. 

The foie gras was good. I can see why people like it. butter and rich with a smokey flavor, thanks to the grill. 

The mozzarella dish was nice and simple. The cheese was amazing. It was a Caprese salad with out being one. 

The tuna was a hit. Crispy outside and perfectly rare in the middle. My wife is not a huge seafood fan and really enjoyed it. The sriracha mayo with it was perfect. They serve jalapeno crackers with the bread dish. We all tried it with the tuna and it was better than what it was served with. We told the waiter and he said he had been telling the chef the same thing. 

I had the lamb chops. Perfectly cooked medium rare and seasoned well. The green peppery sauce was a great accompaniment. 

My wife and her friend split the chicken dish. The really liked it and I got a taste. It was pretty damn good for a simple chicken dish. 

Our other friend got a fish plate, I think it was the sea bass. I shared my lamb, which was a hard thing to do, for some fish. Not as good as the lamb, but good. 

We also had the broccoli rapini and the mashed blue cheese potatoes. I can't speak for everyone on the rapini, but I like it. The potatoes on the other hand, we fought over who got to lick the cast iron dish it can in! They were, to me, the best thing on the table.

Drinks - I had the Ginger Pear cocktail! Very different & unique. Never tasted such before. I requested a lighter touch of the ginger taste, very refreshing and light sweet! I don't like over sweet, so it was perfect! Wine of coz is excellent!

Dessert- we were so full, but still! Killed the chocolate lava cake (it's so different- the best I had!- just got told by the manager Jean Philip is actually the ""inventer""!!!) & their special Churro tossed w/ caramelized bananas & vanilla icecream & peanuts! 

Service- beyond excellent! For me, service is the ""most"" important quality as fulfilling customers' satisfaction. Food servers explained politely & warmly in details of plates, ingredient, purposes of different sauces that come w/ the steak. Love the manager Jack who gave great history and background of the restaurant! We customers do love food and do love to know more about the restaurant.

I find it important to note that Aria, the hotel the restaurant is in, just opened its doors on Wed 12/16 and from what I was told Fri 12/18 was the first night the restaurant was open to the public. The price point was higher; we spent around $100 per person, with drinks appetizers and salads, main courses and sides (this is excluding the 2 bottles of wine). The food was excellent and what we would expect from this type of restaurant, and though the flow of the meal was a bit on the slow side, as I said they had just opened so we expected there to be kinks for them to work out. The wait staff was nothing but friendly and helpful, other than the sommelier which left some to be desired. He didn't really know the wines, and just didn't seem like he wanted to be there given his comments. I think the only thing that was a standout negative was the napkins. I think because they are new, they have a lot of lint coming off of them, so every time someone would get up to use the restroom and the wait staff would fix the napkins, the lint would fly in the air and get in the glasses. As I said, they were new so, though it was a bit unappetizing, it was understandable. We told the hostess about it as we were leaving and they seemed aware by that point.

We ordered 3 appetizers (crab cake, pork belly egg rolls, and bone marrow side dish as an app).  I was bummed to find out they took foie gras off the menu, due to its unpopularity.  On a promising note, the waiter and sommelier were attentive and the waiter did double check to see if there just happened to be any foie gras  ""available"" in the kitchen; sadly there was not.  Appetizers filled the 3 of us, but our entrees included sea bass, tomahawk steak special, and a burrata tomato salad and tuna tartare salad.  Sea bass was the best out of the three.

Caesar salad - Didn't taste like a fresh made Caesar.  Lettuce seemed a bit weak va crunchy crisp.  Dressing was unremarkable.  To be blunt, their salad was not even as good as Black Angus' and that's sad for a $15 salad. 

Calamari - unusual presentation with a little cup of dipping sauce way disproportionate to the amount of calamari received.  I appreciate receiving the sauce.  But the calamari was dare I say ... too strong a ""fishy taste""?  I mean I've certainly had both frozen and fresh calamari, but this one the texture and taste was just a little off.  Tasted like a box of frozen bait squid was left to thaw, and they managed to fry it into something resembling calamari.  About $18?  I'd give them the eve for of the doubt on this one and just rack it up to chef's style of preparation.  

18 oz bone in ribeye.  Steak was pretty good. But they served their house sauce in a cheesy looking plastic bone marrow looking serving container.  Either give real bone marrow as a treat. Or find something classier. 

Diver scallops - 4 out of 5.  No complaints. 

Creamed spinach - average.  Nothing to write home about
Truffles mash potatoes - same comment as above. 

If you want to taste something truly like truffles- and have a great steak.  I'd recommend SW steak at the Wynn and get their truffled corn.  Marginally more expensive, but a lot more memorable for the right reasons.",gT95gl8aW69A_76ayn_YDA,5,2,2,Wpt5dvQzzs0VoZsOcZvvkQ

Jean Georges made the same mistake everyone makes, lots of crust and almost no apples, and the apple filling itself  was subpar. If you're one of those who removes the crust and eats only the apples, you'll be done in three bites. We need to have a pie cook off every year in Vegas, focusing on a different pie each year.  Would someone please get this going!?",4HP-uiYbt3zPFc8qHUbDmg,0,0,3,AnNjQvgFfcwkuzK-FHrYMA

She handed us the menu and walked away. She didn't ask us if we wanted a wine menu, or if we perfect bottle or tap water. When she finally come back 10min later to take our order. I had to ask for a wine menu! She had a sour look the whole time. I had to ask for the check even though she walk right passed us 5times without even coming to our table. When we did receive the bill my mother informed her she was paying, the girl ignored my mother and handed me the bill. For a $400 meal I honestly don't understand how someone can not be respectful. Have you ever heard the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" We honestly wanted to walk out and give $0 for a tip because that's what she deserved.
Really sad on her part she could have got a $100 tip if she had any ounce of common decency.

1752702,2017-10-01,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Really wanted to like this place, but we left feeling underwhelmed by the experience.  Our table all had the tasting menu.  For the steep price, it more resembled a tapas plate than an actual meal--very tiny portions of food, barely more than a few bites of each.  I'll give them credit for attractive plating, but these courses were not groundbreaking, nor were their flavors especially memorable.  At times, they were simply confusing: the fruit course, for example, was a tangle of sour and savory, with barely a hint of sweetness, and the dessert course was inedible.  The tuna tartare was decent enough, and the main attraction--their wagyu beef tenderloin--was excellent, but I certainly wouldn't rank it above any other filet mignon I've had at an ordinary steakhouse.  

The wait staff was certainly friendly and attentive, and the ambiance was great.  Overall, our party did have a terrific evening, but we would have enjoyed ourselves just as much at the Aria's buffet.  It's not that this restaurant didn't serve good food; it just didn't serve memorable food.  When you're paying the staggering prices this place is asking, you have every right to expect a stunning meal, and we were left wanting so much more than it delivered.

1762863,2014-12-03,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"There are a plethora of steakhouses in Vegas. I was staying at Aria and my stay included a resort credit that i opted to use at Jean Georges. If someone is looking for a truly romantic spot for dining, this is truly the place. First off, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It's dimly lit and illuminated by candlelight for a fully romantic effect. Now, like most Vegas casino steakhouses, one must be prepared to pay a premium. Since i was using my resort credit i didn't have to worry about that. Now to the meal. 

Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp. Absolutely delicious, but ridiculously priced for such a small portion. I know it's an appetizer, but damn! Lol!

Main Course:  New York strip. I only eat medium rare steak, with an emphasis on rare. But when i got my steak and cut near the tip, it just didn't have nearly the pink that it should have had. I flagged the waiter down and he suggested i cut more away from the tip. Sure enough it was cooked perfectly the rest of the way. However, i was disappointed that it wasn't pink all the way through. I didn't voice my concern to the waiter and was fully prepared to enjoy the steak. Here's what seperates great service from mediocre service: Apparently he had observed my look of disappointment after i cut into the meat, because lo and behold, a few moments later the manager came over and profusely apologized and offered to totally redo it. Wow! talk about service!! I was sooooo impressed. i informed her that that wasn't necessary and that the steak was really welled seasoned and very juicy. And it was. They brought out several types of steak sauces, but none were required because the flavoring of the steak was really good by itself.

I definitely recommend this restaurant, especially if you are already staying at Aria. Really no need to venture out elsewhere.",n0XUraqJ6mbc0_AJMgEd0Q,0,0,4,E6ntO4t6istzJh4ZSeCDKg
1767482,2012-10-30,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"I love great steak. I'm a big steakhouse fan. This is about the worst steakhouse I've ever been to. It's not because the food is so-so, but the service was worse than abysmal. This is a restaurant in serious need of training from the top down. The top here may or may not be Jean Georges, but there is some serious attitude training needed. The obvious aim was to be pretentious, which is never a good thing. But if you're going to be pretentious, then you'd better be able to back it up with stellar service. They didn't and couldn't. First the food.

The steak was so-so. My dining partner and I were going to split the small rib-eye, which was listed as an 18 oz. portion of prime beef. It came to the table a little small for its purported weight, which wasn't the problem. It was an OK rib-eye, but lacked flavor for a $45+ piece of steak. We also had a Caesar salad, which was good, but not great. Nice preparation with delicious anchovies on top. Couldn't fault that. We also ordered some Brussels sprouts, which were nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It came with walnuts and avocado, an unusual preparation, but delicious. 

The wine list was inaccurate as well. A shiraz from Barossa (I'd been to the winery) was listed as being from New Zealand! About 3,000 miles away from South Australia and Barossa. It was kind of, but not very, cool that the wine list came on an iPad, but they would have been better served by using paper. I understand the concept, but not the execution.
 
No. While the food and wine was OK, even if way overpriced, the waitstaff and manager were the problem. And the problem was huge. First the waiter. There are ways a waiter can suss out what kind of knowledge the diner has about a product being presented. In this case, since I owned a restaurant once, I was very knowledgeable about beef. The waiter approached us as noobs who knew nothing. The meal came all divided up, but not well. The dishes were cleared away in such a manner that it appeared that they couldn't wait for us to leave. Plates and utensils were snapped up. As we finished our meal, the bus person came by and started clearing the table with a lot of clanking and jerked the place mat from under a drinking glass like a magician. It made a loud noise and seemed very rude. He ignored us when I told him to stop. Then I was angry.

The manager came by and asked if there was a problem, then proceeded to be a automaton, ""Yes sir."" ""Yes sir."" ""Yes sir."" ""Yes sir."" ""Yes sir."" ""Yes sir."" without hearing a word I said. Of course this was even more upsetting and condescending to us as diners who were paying a great deal of money for a mediocre meal. This man as a manager is in serious need of training or another profession.

At the end of the day, we left a very small tip. The waiter was OK. The manager was not. The only thing he did well was come to the table.

If you want a really good steak and good service that doesn't condescend, go across the street to Smith & Wollensky. Don't let your shadow fall on this place. I realize that this little diatribe won't make much difference because Jean Georges is located in the Aria hotel, so they get a huge captive audience, but I will be in Vegas again and I will go somewhere else.

Had a $100 resort credit,  so decided to use it towards a nice dinner. We were a group of five and shared the porterhouse, the rib eye, the chicken, black truffle Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. The rib eye was delicious with just the right amount of fat. The porterhouse was somewhat chewy on the new York strip side. Interestingly, the chicken was super delicious with a crispy outside and a tender inside. The chicken came with this spicy buttery sauce that was just perfect. They serve their meats with a variety of sauces but the chimichurri was my fav. The sides were small but good. My fav was the truffle Mac and cheese.

1814027,2016-08-21,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"This is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the country. I was super excited to eat here, but it is nothing special.

I've eaten at every famous steakhouse you can name. SW, STK, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Mark Joseph, Del Frisco's, Porterhouse, Michael Jordan's, BLT, Wolfgang, 212, Striphouse, Uncle Jack's, BLT Prime, Bobby Van, Frankie & Johnnie's, Smith & Wollensky, Charlie Palmer, Palm, Capitol Grill, N9NE, Echo & Rig... and these are all better than JG.

I don't eat meat anymore, so I ordered shrimp cocktail, burrata salad, and the diver scallops.

I have high expectations of service here, and most were met, but it can be the little things that make it less than fabulous.

Our front waiter was a nice, experienced girl who was well versed in the menu and restaurant but has no idea when to stop, as in she doesn't shut up. She over sells. She can't read people. And she comes across as totally like a robot.

Her job is over once she takes your order.  Then the food expediters and back waiter take over.

My shrimp cocktail came with two sauces. The cocktail sauce was watery and ordinary and not even enough to consume the 4 large shrimp. I have no idea what the other sauce was but it was not appealing. I was dipping my shrimp in the cocktail sauce and was already down two shrimp when the back waiter showed up with my spoons to use on the sauce.  Bring me what I need to enjoy the food BEFORE the food shows up, so that was a strike against the type of service I expect from a restaurant of this caliber.

Then my Burrata salad arrived and it was only mediocre.  The tomatoes were so cold, which tomatoes are not supposed to be, they lose their flavor, and the homemade burrata had a great texture but no flavor.  I think this salad was not freshly made but was premade and sat in a cooler because  the tomatoes were just under frozen.

Then the scallops arrived.  They were topped with bread crumbs and laid on a very spicy sauce, and I love spice but this one was just not a good one. It was spice with dill, which I don't think is a good combination. I only at half before I was sick of the sauce.  I expect scallops to be crispy on the outside and tender inside. These were tender through out and just uneventful.

One guest had a filet mignon. It came perfectly cooked as he requested medium. What I don't understand is the mint sauce they include with every sauce. I like the presentation, that the sauce arrives in a marrow bone with a tiny spoon.  However, they then bring four more sauces, one is bearnaise, and the rest I didn't pay close enough attention.  I have never been to a steakhouse of this caliber that offers this many sauces, and we all thought it was overkill to bring five. Why is one on the plate and then four on the side. It's odd. I think if a steak needs a sauce, it either sucks or the diner has a very amateur palette.

Other guest got salmon & shrimp and she enjoyed that.

We got the lobster mashed potatoes, which are really puree, like baby food. I don't care for that. It's nearly a soup. It tasted good but was too runny to get on your fork.

We also ordered the creamed corn, which isn't creamed corn at all.  It's fancy corn.  It tasted good, but wasn't what we expected.  They removed the corn from the husk and throw spices on it.  It's not creamy at all.

And we had fries, which tasted good, but I didn't feel at all they were freshly cut fries which was shocking. They were too perfect shaped and in their consistency, like they were mass produced and from a frozen bag and air fried.",1JW3rbxP2WpnXYOeMyKEWg,2,0,2,n-cJNiDHfGwLa1phiWqBbw

1870931,2014-01-27,2,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"I'll start with a brief description of the food, but then retell the story of the worst service I think I have ever received and how they tried to scam us out of $200.

The appetizers and sides were pretty good, we got a variety of what they had on offer. Some of the sides, the carrots and potato options were very good actually. The salads were ok at best.
I was at Jean Georges with a work group, maybe about 8 of us. We all had steaks which were overcooked. It wasn't enough to send it back for anyone, but they were all overcooked (I actually don't mind a medium steak being a bit overdone anyway). Food wise, I would say it was ok, but there are better options, especially at that price range.

The reason Jean Georges gets ONE STAR is because of the service/scam they tried to pull. We asked for a bottle of a dessert wine which was listed on the menu at about $60 which is the normal price for this wine. There was some confusion about the exact year/quality being ordered because the menu did not give the quality (these wines scored 3-7 by sweetness) but eventually the waitress found the wine and we confirmed it was what we expected. When the bill came, they tried to charge $250 for the wine, an OUTRAGEOUS price. 

We told the waitress she made a mistake, she brought the menu back and made some story about how the wine we ordered was different from what was listed which was 1) entirely false and 2) we were never told that they thought it was a different wine. If a restaurant is under the impression they're serving a wine that's different from what's ordered, how can you serve that without telling anyone?! The waitress refused to be reasonable so we asked to talk to the manager. After a great deal of arguing, the manager seemed to imply the menu was wrong and insisted on the $250 price. Eventually the manager simply gave up and charged us the correct $60 price, but, firstly, you should be comping a $60 dessert wine on an 8 person meal over $1,000 anyway! And after such an ordeal, good service says to comp the wine then!

The scallops were tasty, but slightly salty for our tastes... lime wedges are a must to cut down their intensity.  The filet mignon main course was mixed-bag: the sesame seed sauce was delicious, but the meat was over-seasoned, extremely salty.  In addition, the chef-de-cuisine's choice of ending the menu with a classic lava cake was disappointingly dull.  It lacked any of the NY restaurant's Iuzzini's flair.  Overall, I had a better than average meal.

Service-wise, the restaurant falters, hindered mostly by a robotic waiter who just recited the course and a pair of hostile front hostesses who were unable to soldier a smile or pretend to be happy to see us even though the restaurant was nearly empty during dinner hours.  I suspect the qualification to work here is to hate all life and happy things, especially puppies.

If you are in the area with a steak crave, I'd recommend Gallagher's over at New York, New York.  If you want a tasting menu, Joel Robuchon's 4-course or 6-course meal is a far superior experience.",7oGXFkWr-pRm8KwUmH24Hg,19,13,1,ZstSmk9_m9dUOjWTzTqfMQ

Ambiance and decor wise is to personal taste... ymmv.

After reading about some of the service issues from other reviews, i believe my wife and i got lucky because our waiter was just the nicest nicest guy ever and the other servers never let my water glass sit at less than half empty. So 5 stars for service from me.

The non red meat food.... 4-5 stars

Started with Soup du Jour... escapes my memory what it was exactly but something with lobster. Lobster bisque has been en vogue for a while now but i remember actually enjoying this version.

Peekytoe Crabcake... on the regular menu and very very good. All crab meat cake without much else. The grapefuit and ginger sauce went well with the crab while the avacado smoothed the overall texture.

Maine Lobster... also off the regular menu. Almost like an Asian stir-fry. My wife very much enjoyed it and the brussel sprouts were done to perfection. Brussel sprouts not done correctly can kill a dish.

The beef... 3 stars

24oz Porterhouse... ordered it medium rare. came out more on the rare side but i can enjoy some bloody meat so it was fine. But overall a bit chewy all around. The filet side was not overcooked but felt the quality of meat a bit frustrating for the supposed level of the steakhouse.

In Vegas, better can be had at Delmonico's or even Joe's Seafood at Caesar's Palace.

Quite a letdown... only salvaged but its other offerings and service.",ImDpq4iUDzZ6gFkCuW77iQ,1,0,3,onkFGRfpnDRlEp_ck23WeQ

 - Romaine And Arugula Salad | Avocado And Spicy Corn Vinaigrette
Small serving size was my first impression of this appetizer, but then at a steak house you dont really go for the salads. 

Not a lot of Avocado, i recall noticing about two or three chunks. A little more avocado would have been nice but with the serving size one extra chunk would have done it but three chunks would have been too much avocado. 

The vinaigrette had a pronounced spicy kick to it. I had forgotten it was even suppose to be spicy as i was interested in this only because i'm a huge fan of arugula. In the end it complemented the salad quite nicely as the sweetness of heirloom cherry sized tomatoes balanced it out quite nicely. 


- Grass Fed Paso Prime New York Strip | Smokey Tomato Compote, Herbal Spinach And Crunchy Potato
The smokey tomato compote was excellent, just truly excellent. What ever it touched it gave off a sweet yet smokey tomato flavor; with the steak: totally awesome! with the crunchy potato: hey you got adult fries and ketchup! with the spinach very nice indeed. I'd love to have a jar of this stuff so i can eat it with anything.

To be honest, i didnt taste anything herbal about the herbal spinach at all. It was just a hair on the salty side and tasted like any cooked spinach side with just a bit of garlic to it. Nothing special but nothing holding it back either. 

The NY Strip was a very uniformed cut and didnt look like any traditional NY Strip i commonly see. There was no strip of tendon and fat on the sides which was unfortunate for me as i do enjoy the tendon, gives it a chewy texture which is nice when the cuts are on the large or thick side. The quality of the steak was superb as well as the requested temperature, which was medium rare btw. Overall seasonings could have been improved. There was nothing about this steak that impressed me or made the dining experience worth it other than it being of a much higher upscale restaurant grade cut. 


- Warm Chocolate Cake | Vanilla Ice Cream
Nothing really stood out from this dessert. It's basically your average chocolate cake that's still runny in the middle served with ice cream. Nothing special, nothing just jumps up and wows you. 


I see restaurant week as an opportunity as a local to try out restaurants i normally dont even consider going to. If you're a tourist or not a Las Vegas local reading this review then i urge you to ignore everything i typed and go here, you'll have a great time. In my prospective, the only item that was served that truely wowed me was the smokey tomato compote. Everything else i give credit to the establishment for having quality ingredients and talented staff but the bang to buck ratio did not meet my expectations.

Got there at 10 and was seated promptly. We were starved and quickly made up our mind. However, we had a smartass of a waiter who decided to lag it for 30 minutes before we ordered. While he was listing off the specials he gave everyone really weird eye contact, actually he did that throughout the night. 

I ordered the Australian F1 Tomahawk Bone in Rib eye, which the waiter said was a wagyu and prime crossbreed. It was a special that day at $95. I got the bone marrow side and foie grais appetizer. My lady got 8 or 10 oz filet with black truffle fritter as a side. My buddies got a 28oz porterhouse, and the miso seabass. I forgot what else they ordered. But from what I remember, the miso seabass was overly saucey.

Anyways... My steak came horribly charred on the outside. Every bite was like sinking my teeth into a piece of charcoal. The waiter came by and asked if he could do anything about the steak. All i was thinking was ""what are you gona shave off all the charcoal on the outside?"" I said forget it and just dealt with it. It was all getting comped by Aria anyways. All the sides were good though. The foie had a great apple jalapeno spread on the side. 

Overall the food was decent. I liked craftsteak better (plus they serve real kobe). The ambiance was nice. Trendy little cowfaces everywhere. I would say our waiter ruined my experience though.

Butternut squash soup , I could get this at Soup Freaks for a quarter of the price. No creativity , very bland and wouldn't order it again. 

Miso glazed Chilean sea bass , four stars for the entree , however the mushroom side for me, it was a distraction of flavor from the sea bass . Definitely change the side dish.

If you're looking for some good eats at the Aria and want to venture off in some of the fine dining they have to offer, Jean Georges is definitely one of those places that delivers.

The Place -
Jean Georges is located inside of the Aria Casino on the Promenade Level (2nd Level) across from The Buffet in this, sort of, horseshoe next to a few of the other restaurants. While Yelp describes the place as needing ""dressy"" attire, you can definitely enter the place with a ""business casual"" type of a dress code. If you enter the place with a t-shirt or shorts, you will definitely feel out of place. The restaurant itself is fairly dark and intimate, which is expected with any type of fine dining experience and the furniture and decor is very modern. The bar is a fairly decent size; however, the seats at the bar are spread out spaciously so that you don't feel like you're sitting in someone else's lap when you're enjoying your beverage or eating your meal. At the bar, you're treated with two flat panel TVs mounted back to back to take care of both sides of the countertop. The restaurant itself has a fairly big footprint and can definitely accommodate for any party size. Very cool place, Jean Georges!
*****5/5 Stars*****

The Service -
I was in town for a conference and the last session ended at 5:15pm. Jean Georges's only service is during dinner with doors opening at 5:00pm. Immediately, after my last session, I went straight to Jean Georges in hopes of being able to just sit at the bar as a walk-in. I checked out their digital menu that is mounted on the wall right outside of the restaurant and after a few brief minutes, I approached the door where I was greeted by several hostesses. I asked if Jean Georges is reservation only or if I could walk-in to the bar and they politely let me know that the bar was open seating, offering the full dinner menu, and that I was more than welcome to have a seat. Hostess interaction is really important to me as it's usually the first impression that you get of the restaurant and Jean Georges delivered flawlessly. I sat myself at the bar where I was then promptly greeted by the bartender, Thomas. He asked if I was staying to eat and gave me a menu to glance over. After that, he gave me the drink menu, gave me a few minutes, and took the initiative of getting me a water in the meantime. I came during Game 1 of the World Series and they had the game on the TVs and the bartenders and patrons were participating in general conversation regarding the game and were all really down to earth. The excellent service continued throughout constantly checking up on me making sure that I was ok. The service in a restaurant is just as important as the food they serve and Jean Georges definitely delivered. Thanks, guys!
*****5/5 Stars*****

The Food -
Goodness gracious, where do I begin? As I was looking through the menu attempting to figure out what I wanted, the bartender(not Thomas) came around and gave us popcorn (See Picture) to snack on. Now, some of you probably just snickered at the mention of ""popcorn"" at a fine dining restaurant, but trust me, this is popcorn you DEFINITELY wanna try. The popcorn, in addition to it being buttered, is also dusted with Cayenne Pepper and Rosemary giving it a savory kick to your tastebuds. The taste is absolutely addicting and wouldn't mind if they made it available for the public to buy and have it shipped to their house haha. For my main dish, I ordered the Soy Glazed Short Ribs (See Picture) and the Truffle Mac & Cheese (See Picture). The Truffle Mac & Cheese is nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. It's very creamy and cheesy and the truffle is present throughout each bite. The Soy Glazed Short Ribs were nothing short of amazing. The short ribs were perfectly cooked not needing a knife, only your fork, to cut it. The accompanying apple-jalepeno puree was a sweet and savory accent that matched perfectly with the apple slaw that was served on top of the short ribs, which I could've ate just by itself all day haha. The Soy Glaze on the short ribs was absolutely delicious and is definitely what made these short ribs some of the best I've ever tasted and I've tasted A LOT! Haha. The glaze was sweet, tangy, and did not overpower the rest of the dish. It was well-balanced and I HIGHLY recommend it if you're in the mood for some delicious short ribs! Tres bien, Jean Georges.....tres, tres bien!
*****5/5 Stars*****

Overall -
I'm glad I was in vicinity of this restaurant. There are many places to choose from in Vegas when it comes to a steakhouse. In fact, I believe each major casino on The Strip has their own steakhouse so it makes it hard to choose. If you're in the Aria as a visitor or a guest of the hotel, I would HIGHLY recommend checking out Jean Georges!

The food was lovely. Pricey but reflects the quality that it delivers. For the appetizer, my boyfriend and I shared the wagyu beef carpaccio with black truffle fritter and we couldn't stop raving about it. Each bite was like a bit of heaven. I was sad when we finished it. I only wish there was more! But good things come in small packages.

Onto the entree. I had the filet mignon cooked medium rare. It was delicious and extremely tender. I'm drooling as I think about it. The sauces it came with were good. There's one for every mood. I especially enjoyed the soy-miso butter. It complimented the steak well. I love putting sauces in my food, but at times i omitted the sauce and enjoyed the cut the way it was. 

My boyfriend had the bone-in ribeye cooked medium rare. He enjoyed it but thought the filet mignon was betterafter he had a bite of mine! 

Sides: We ordered a side of truffle mashed potatoes and truffle fries (the special that night). We should've gotten something different because two potato sides proved to be too much to finish. We were stuffed!! Next time, I would get the bone marrow or the brussel sprouts!

Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything we ordered. They have a huge wine selection too which is nice. I don't have much to say about this except i liked what I ordered. I would have more appreciation for the extensive wine list if I knew more about wine. 

As for dessert - didn't get any. Too full. I left happy and satisifed :) 

I would give it 4.5 stars, because the food was really good. Service was good, but servers weren't very personable. Perhaps that's not what they're going for anyway. Also, the tables were very close to each other, so at times i felt like I was forced to listen to another couple's conversation. And that can get a little awkward!

So, most steakhouses seem to hate me because I just really like steak medium-well meat.  I swear other places seriously punish me for ordering steak that way.  Not here.  I ordered the NY Strip streak and it was the.most.perfect rendition of medium-well ever.  Just how I like it.  The cut was wonderful.  Our waiter also had some nice sauce recommendations that enhanced the taste.  

Brussels sprouts were great, and the wedge salad had a little kick to it in the dressing.

I'm a self confessed foodie and I cook and bake gourmet food as well.
So when I go to nicer restaurant I have high expectations.

It was my first time to dine in this restaurant and I wanted to see what the hype was all about.

The Black Truffle Comte Fritters were to die for. 
I wish I just ordered 4 servings of those for my whole meal.

I love Lamb Chops cooked and seasoned right.
Their Colorado Lamb Chops had Olives on them which I was not a fan of so I opted for their chargrilled version to play it safe.

I don't know if the server was just not a great one but when I asked what the chef would recommend in terms of temperature whether rare or medium rare-the server replied that "" it was my preference and he could not give any recommendations.""
He also failed to tell me that the lamb chops did not come seasoned at all.

When my rare lamb chops came, not only did it taste a bit gamey, it had NO TASTE! I compensated with their dips which were a bit spicy for my taste.

Call me crazy but the server did not ask us how our meal was during or after we dined.

Being on vacation, I was too tired to bring this to their attention and didn't want to ruin the good vibe our group had.

I hope this restaurant find better servers who can inform you of the chef's recommendations and let you know that the chargrilled meats do not come seasoned at all.

1. The ambiance is wonderful, upscale, dark lit, elegant, sensual, mysterious.
2. The music - outstanding eclectic (Snoop Doggs Sensual Seduction, Hot Chips Ready for the Floor are the only two I can remember)
3. Service - we had a funky gal named Dorris serve us.  She was sweet with a dash of fiery.  I would go back to see her.
For food, I got the seared Fois Gras (priced at $34).  The piece was larger than most places.  The outside seemed a bit hard at first look but as soon as I cut into the livery goodness, it was just right.  The fig and mushrooms just added to the spectacular appetizer dish. 
I also got the pear/apple endive salad ($20) and it was also just perfect.  They didn't go crazy on the blue cheese (thank god).
My friend got the cheese crusted chicken ($30).  It was cooked perfectly.  He preferred the white meat cutlet over the dark meat which was fine for me since I got to have the dark meat! HA!  The cheese was light and not overbearing at all.  It was just crusted on one side of the cutlets so if you decided you didn't really want the cheese crusts, you could easily bypass and just eat the meat.
Friend also got the butter nut squash soup which he said was tasty though he felt was very rich in cream. ($15)

2168589,2016-05-24,7,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"A beautiful restaurant, initially striking the right balance in atmosphere, neither stuffy steakhouse nor nightclub party with a side of meat, Jean George's is a prime example of unrealized potential. The night was full of slight missteps.

For example, over half of the seats at the bar were marked as ""reserved""- resulting in those waiting for their tables not being able to have a cocktail without sitting on the couches in the ""lounge"" (with nowhere to sit your drinks). 

We brought our own wine, but it took awhile before the sommelier asked if we'd like it opened and decanted. Small thing.

We were very excited about the menu, because there were some really delicious offerings, and the accompaniments- wow! This definitely could be the start of an amazing marriage of surf and turf!

Appetizers started off pretty well. The crab cake took the prize- the marriage between the sweet citrus, the avocado, the crab- light, sweet, and close to perfect. The bacon wrapped shrimp, while good, didn't ""wow"" me. This time, the old adage ""everything's better with bacon"" didn't quite hold true.

Now, the meat!! Prime ribeye, medium (being sure to clarify that it would be a warm, red center), and Australian filet,  medium plus , were on the docket. I also ordered the scallop accompaniment and the lobster mashed potatoes.

Let's start with the positive.. The scallops were pretty close to perfect. Three meaty, tender, and large scallops arrived with my steak. Delicious.
However, the steak itself was pretty average.
The center was closer to pink than red, and while seasoned nicely, the steak itself was not very tender. I remember remarking that I'd made better steaks at home on my cast iron skillet. Not bad, but certainly fell short of expectations.

The filet was even worse- a significant portion of it was gristle, hard to cut into and almost impossible to eat. This one was cooked medium rather than medium plus with the red, warm center, and was also seasoned well, but when 1/2-2/3 of it is inedible... Yeah.

The lobster mashed potatoes were tasty, but save for one large chunk, there wasn't much actual lobster in there, although it did have good lobster flavor. Are you sensing a trend here? 

Ok, maybe dessert will salvage things! The server spoke very highly about the apple pie, and that was the only thing that interested me, so why not! 
Again.. Just ok. Nothing to write home over, but not bad. 

So, all in all... Just an okay experience here. Pity too.. Lots of potential, but execution was lacking.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,13,7,3,hrRhbIPQm2NmEj806tkiZQ

You walk into a dimly lit dining area that reminds me of a cave. There are interesting decorations around but I suppose the lighting can be described as intimate. They have a huge wall of wine near the bar area that is pretty impressive. There is ample seating and it doesn't feel like you are crammed together. 

The food was alright but nothing overly spectacular. There were some interesting flavors in what we ordered. My boyfriend and I both ordered the same thing but had different experiences. 

We had the JG Cheeseburger - Truffle mayonnaise, Brie cheese, Yuzu Pickles and Truffle fries.  We both ordered the burgers Medium but mine came medium rare and the other was medium well. So the texture of the burger was a bit off for both of us.  The truffle mayonnaise was interesting but kinda lost its flavor after a few seconds. The Brie was very nice on my burger but then again I LOVE Brie.  The Yuzu pickles kinda had a sharp flavor to them so I felt like it took away from the flavor of the meat and cheese so I ate them on the side. Now if any of you have read my other posts then you would know that I'm a fry snob and I'll say that I didn't eat many of my truffle fries. The fries were crispy which was nice but the truffle was just kinda garnished over the fries and was a bit hard to eat. 

We also ordered a side of the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. This was tasty with shaved black truffle on the top and bread crumbs. I think this was the best part of the meal to be honest but still lacked a certain something. 
The burgers are $26 bucks a piece and the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese is $18 bucks. 

Over all, it wasn't bad but I wasn't really in a WOW stage by the time I left. I might go back but I don't have a burning desire to do so.

The bartender seemed confused as to why we were there, asking if we were waiting for a table (the place was empty).  When we told him we just wanted drinks and snacks, he didn't say anything but just handed us a cocktail menu and food menu.  I ordered my drink, a ginger margarita, and the bartender ran off to make it without asking my husband what he wanted, which was odd.  But then he delivered the drink and took my husband's drink order.  Different kind of system I guess.

I grabbed the free popcorn at the bar and started chowing down.  Nothing was getting me down today.  My ginger margarita ($14) was excellent - to the point where I had to hold myself back from chugging it.  My husband's lychee bellini ($14) looked pretty but I didn't try it.  He enjoyed it.

By the way, the coasters are apparently supposed to depict a cow.  I had to stare at it a while to see it.  Look at my pics, imagine some eyes, and you'll see it.  The design is all over the restaurant.  At first I thought it was supposed to depict a fork on LSD.

We decided to order the steak tartare ($20), which interestingly enough comes with basil (not parsley), quail egg, and lime juice.  Extremely yummy! It comes with the best french fries ever! 

We also got the truffle fritters ($12) and, OMG, these were the best!  Just the right about of truffle, nice and cheesy inside.  So good.  And the right portion size at 8 fritters.

Even though we were only ordering appetizers and drinks, the bartender brought by bread.  We got pretzel bread and cherry pecan.  The bread was really, really good.  I love pretzel bread and he gave us three pieces.  I almost ate too much, which would have ruined me for the next two restaurants in the foodie crawl so I limited myself to one piece.

The bartender was super friendly - I think he was just feeling us out in the beginning.  He started chatting us up and we got some info from him on why so many restaurants were closed in Aria that night (American Fish, Bar Masa, Sirio, Sage) with NFR and the marathon in town.  He said that Aria is an occupancy based property and they were only at 30% occupancy so when that happens some of the restaurants close to keep costs down.  People don't really walk in off the street.  Bummer.

Towards the end of the meal, some guy who was getting comped sat down next to us and was being a real prick.  So that probably explains why the bartender was standoffish at the beginning.

The bar is really cozy and the bartender was very accommodating as he didn't get my drink right and took the initiative to try again until getting it right!  When we sat at the table the service was quick with waters and menus. We ordered 2 bottles of pricey wines (hard to find anything decent under &100) and apps and dinner. Squash soup was very good, Tuna tartare was good but certainly not the best I'd tasted. My table all ordered steak which was average tasting for a high end steak house. I ordered the sea bass with a side dish of mushrooms. Sea bass was not great. It was dry, came with no sauce.  The sea bass with miso at the Yard House is better - at least it has a nice broth and some bok Choy. When it arrived it actually already came with a little bunch of mushrooms.  The waiter didn't mention it already came with mushrooms while taking my side order of mushrooms.  When I pointed out that if I had known it came with mushrooms I wouldn't have ordered a side of mushrooms his response was ""well it says on the menu that it comes with mushrooms"". We were all very taken aback as when you are paying the prices we paid I would have expected the waiter to say ""what other side can I bring you""?  Instead they said they would take them off the bill but we're also going to take them away without offering any other option. This was just bad bad service for such a high restaurant. We were all shocked by the way two waiters reacted that it really left a bad taste in our mouths.

Service and wine selection were very good, but the food was nothing special.  My medium rare filet came out medium.  The bone marrow (usually a favorite dish) was disappointing - it was gelatinous and didn't have that spreadable, butter-like quality you would expect.  Lobster mashed potatoes and truffle mac were enjoyable, but not earth shattering (pretty much anything with lobster and/or truffle is going to taste good).  I did like that the creamed spinach was not too heavy, and that you could see the stems on the spinach leaves, indicating they used fresh spinach.  One final complaint - they wouldn't split the bill on more than (I think) 4 credit cards, which was kind of a pain with that large a group (10 ppl) (one would think they'd be more accommodating given the number of bachelor/bachelorette parties and guys/girls' weekends that are likely to be there).

Waiters are helpful in directing you AWAY from the dry aged rib eye; which is a poor Choice cut (REALLY??); to the slightly less insipid prime rib eye; a butter-soaked disaster of a steak. The Wagyu fares no better; with poorly sourced meat sadly charred on a plate with a quaint plastic marrow bone holding a faux asian sauce to mask the taste of a cheaply procured; poorly cooked piece of meat. The creamed spinach is a bowl of rancid cream with spinach fragments - inedible.

Save your time and money and go to Serrano, the only restaurant in the Aria that gives a damn. This is insulting and pathetic - the only redeeming factor was the strong martini that kept me happy enough to suffer through this sorry excuse of a meal.

2344623,2016-11-13,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Husband and I originally had reservations for Craft Steak but our concierge convinced us to try Jean George's since we were staying at Aria. 

It was very easy to get a reservation. We checked in at 8pm and they were able to secure us a 9:30 reservation on a Saturday evening. We walked in and were greeted by name and immediate shown to our seats. Dimly lit dining area. Intimate ambience. So far so good. 

Our waitstaff was super attentive from then on. They recommended excellent choices and our glasses were never empty and they kept asking if we needed anything every 10 min or so. 

We ordered the wagyu carpaccio to start, 2 filet mignons medium rare, bone marrow, mushroom side and truffle Mac and cheese. Well, let me just say... I almost cried. Their carpaccio was easily one of the BEST things I've ever eaten. Perfectly rare with a truffle crunch in the middle and truffle shavings on top. I'd order that every day for the rest of my life. 

Our main courses arrived soon after. The bone marrow and toast. Ugh. Also amazing. With the success of the earlier two dishes, my mouth was watering as I cut into my filet. The char seemed a little too dark, but I trusted they knew what they were doing. I cut into in knowing already that it wasn't medium rare because of how sturdy the meat was..and it was gray. No pink. I asked my husband if his was the same, but his was perfect. Ahhh killjoy. Now, I had already scooped truffle Mac and mushrooms onto my plate to enjoy together, so I was really hesitant about saying anything, but my husband insisted and motioned for our server. I asked him if it was cooked right and he agreed it looked more medium/ medium well. Another server came by and confirmed. I felt so bad about asking for a new piece but our waiter was completely understanding and said, ""no this should be perfect for you."" He literally came back with a new steak 5 minutes later and it was everything I expected. Perfectly juicy and perfectly cooked. The manager checked in and apologized and I appreciated it.

Sigh...I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for that meat issue, and would have let it go if it was for a side dish. But they specialize in Steak. And you can only have that first bite once. They made up for it with the complimentary dessert and excellent service and then lost a star again with the pushy photographers who were a little aggressive about a $200 photo package while we were eating dessert. I expected that they would do it on the way out, not table side. That just kind of cheapened the experience and made it feel more cruise ship. But you could tell they were outside vendors because they didn't have the same delicacy and finesse as the restaurant staff.

Overall, I would still highly recommend Jean George's to anyone looking for a great date night with excellent food.",D1Lhl98-Dix4T2LystJQAg,1,0,4,c-yKsrqaDrNETfQpplbAUg

Service *
The sommelier (wine steward?) was very knowledgeable. He gave us two recommendations based on our preferences and the rib-eye we ordered. He was also very attentive. 
However, our server was not very attentive. For the tasting menu we ordered, he didn't even introduce any dish when he served them. This is the first time that I had tasting menu at a nice restaurant without servers introducing the dishes. It was a little bit disappointing. On top of that, the three sides we ordered didn't come with our entrees. We waited for extra 15 to 20 minutes for the side dishes to come. My in-law had to eat his rib-eye slowly for 20 minutes, waiting for the mashed potato, mushrooms, and asparagus. Very unprofessional. 
Food ***
The food was fine, considering how it's priced, I think it can be a little bit better. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu. The TUNA TARTARE doesn't taste any different from any regular restaurant. The THREE GRAIN SALAD (Beets, Goat Cheese & Herbs) tasted the same as the one at the Cheesecake Factory (One of my favorite salad there). The scallop dish came with sugar snap peas and vines didn't amaze us, either. 
I would recommend the salmon and the WAGYU TENDERLOIN. The wagyu tenderloin was tender, juicy and full of flavors. The salmon dish was well-presented and it was delicious. It was actually the best salmon I have ever had. Not just the way it was cooked, but also the quality of the fish itself.

2390270,2016-11-21,1,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Dining on Las Vegas Boulevard can be a different kind of gamble than most patrons are used to experiencing. Do you hedge your bets and save money by going to the buffet that was last cleared by the health inspector in 1973, or do you spend massive amounts of money on fine dining that is so snooty they charge you to use the bathroom while never making eye contact with you? It's a risky venture but if there is one place on The Strip that is a guaranteed jackpot visit for you and your dining party, it has to be Jean Georges Steakhouse. The reasons are many, but if you are the kind of Las Vegas visitor who wants the quick-and-easy soundbites for your adventures, trust me when I say this is worth the time and asking price.

For the rest of us still reading, I'll recap my visit whilst wiping the drool from my mouth as I fondly reminisce about some of these dishes.

My folks and I were looking for a nice steakhouse to close out our last night in town. And being that this was downstairs from our rooms in the ARIA, it was an easy reservation to make. But even without the convenience of proximity, Jean Georges is more than worthy of visiting. When we walked in, the duo of hostesses at the front desk greeted us and escorted us through the dining room to a banquette seat along the back wall. Along the way, we passed through a classy bar area, as well as a couple of dining rooms flanked with booths, tables and the most inviting atmosphere of any upscale dining I have seen in Vegas.

Almost seconds after being seated, Jason came by and welcomed us. Much like the hostesses, Jason was professional, engaging and fully committed to making sure each guest had their expectations exceeded. Since this was our first visit, and I tend to get confused by concepts like revolving doors, we appreciated the overview of the menu Jason provided. I especially was relieved to find out the sigils lining the walls are cow noses - you can totally see that when someone points it out to you. (I spent the first 20 minutes here thinking they were an abstract interpretation of Monument Valley.)

With generously poured cocktails in hand, we set our sights on the food. Mom opted for the butternut squash soup and soy-glazed short rib, Dad chowed down on the caesar salad and wagyu filet, and I decided to attempt cardiac arrest with the bacon-wrapped shrimp and 18-oz. ribeye. In most reviews, I would take the time to itemize each item and give the pros and/or cons, stretching the total word count to somewhere around the 600,000 word total. But everything here was impossibly wonderful. Truthfully, it started with the complimentary basket of breads, stuffed with everything from pretzel rolls to something I forgot the name of from Morocco that engulfed my taste buds in flavor and fire. Even the side orders of asparagus and fries met with our voracious appetites.

(And special note must be made for the quartet of steak sauces brought out - while two were better than the others, the fact that there was so much variety to choose from made for a nice addition. However, that green minty sauce that came in its own silo may be the closest thing to a transcendental moment I have experienced - I think the first bite sent me back in time, though that may have been the second house ""mule"" providing the foundation for this out-of-body experience.)

Unfortunately, with food this good, you are going to want to eat as much as possible. Why is this a bad thing? Well, in our case, due to the aftermath of our gorging, none of us had room for dessert. If tradition holds up, though, I'm sure the desserts are awesome.

Other random observations: the bathrooms are kind of cool, in that there are free-standing sinks atop columns in the middle of the floor. There is a photographer wandering the premises to capture your visit, but she was not obtrusive, at all. And whoever picked the soundtrack gets all the points in my book - until coming here, I never realized how cool life could be until I was eating a steak while the Pet Shop Boys' ""West End Girls"" was playing. (Seriously, the mix of current and classic new wave/synth pop music was excellent.)

I have one slight concern to mention, and it's one I typically harp on like a broken record: no manager came by to our table. I'm not even sure if a manager was walking the floor - my back was to the dining room. I'm sure one was making the rounds, though. In a high class steakhouse, I put a lot of value in a managerial presence speaking with the guests, even if it is just to thank them for coming in. It's a slight hiccup, and it's certainly not going to stop me from recommending this place, but it's just a suggestion to the powers that be to maybe have a bit more visibility in the dining room.

Again, though, that's a minor bump in the road compared to the overall visit we had the pleasure of enjoying. Sure, the pricing may deter some, but Jean Georges Steakhouse is proof you get what you pay for - it is a masterful dining experience.",6MizZ9yqvVMfnlgpbaVeVw,3,1,5,vzZJscxwwu_sFTp_C5HjUA

However, this Vegas Steakhouse is fantastic and I would go here over the other Vegas Steakhouses any day.

I started off with my standard Caesar salad.   Hard to screw up (though some places manage to!) but there are various ways to make it notable (see my Strip House review).  Many places use big, thin fresh cuts of parmesan but Jean Georges takes a different tack.  The parmesan is grated so small and light that it literally seems fluffy and melts immediately on the tongue.  NICE.

Next was the sweetbreads.  If a chef is willing to serve this, he knows his stuff, and these were cooked in an extremely (and mercifully) light sesame truffle sauce.  Very good, and a nice change from typical steakhouse fare.

Normally I like to go for the filet, but when I see a soy-glazed short rib, I have to have it.  It's literally a compulsion.  I can get a great filet any time in NYC, and I'm glad I went with the short rib because it was amazing.  I think even better than the short rib at BLT prime because of the soy glaze.

We made our reservation ahead of time so we were promptly seated. The hostess and manager who showed us to our seats were very friendly. I didn't care much for the decor as it was a little too avant-garde for a steakhouse. Our server greeted us immediately and told us about the specials, she recited them super fast so we didn't hear half of the things she said. I felt had she slowed her pace a little and gave us a chance to interact, she probably would've sold all of us on the specials.

We started with the Crispy Shrimp. It was tasty but very small portion to be an appetizer (only 3 shrimp); for our dinner, we ordered the New York strip, the Filet and the Rib-eye. My strip was cooked exactly the way I wanted. Meat was very tender and flavorful, I almost didn't need the miso butter sauce (which was good, a bit salty). My friends seemed to enjoyed their steak as well. We shared some lobster mash (basic mash starts at $10 and prices go up for different kinds of mash - garlic, lobster, etc etc), which was actually the highlight of the meal for me; creamed spinach and grilled Asparagus.

Overall, our food was tasty and our service was great. However, for a five star Vegas establishment I felt the experience was nothing special. I would still recommend this place for people looking for a great steak.",YBa116q7RFrXZq6a0yVlCQ,0,0,3,yo5uHieHBKBObTokiyx2RA

The decor of the restuarant is soooo sexy...........the low-dimmed lights, comfortable seats, hip-hop music and all the hot babes walking in their 5 inch heels........I could just sit here and hang out all night and not eat a thing.

I started off the meal with the cream of tomato soup.  It was the best tomato soup that I have ever had.....just enough cream to make it rich and creamy......it came with a tasty chedder cheese garlic toast.

The bread basket was also very tasty.....pretzel bread, sour dough, parmesean cheese flat bread  and a cherry pecan bread that made the basket super delicious.

For dinner, I had the rib-eye steak and a side of their famous black truffled comte cheese fritter.

My bone-in rib eye steak came out perfect..........tender, full of flavor and just the right amount of fat.

The side of the comte fritter was awesome....it came with 4 dipping sauces and really made the flavor of the steak come out.....think a deep fried cheese ball.

For desert, I had the baba rum cake....it came with pineapples and caramel ice cream.  The rum cake was warm.....it tasted delicious with the pineapple slices and caramel flavored ice cream.

Overall....it a great dining experience.  The food, hot, high heeled babes and the sexy atmosphere made the meal wonderful........I came again in my pants...sooooo satisfying.",SIpBqzGhRM7T5cDFiuIryg,44,49,5,SBfht0JQT-FfbnV6XpJisA

Food:
I had the tasting menu and was disappointed with the menu. The only two good items on the menu was the steak, which literally melted in my mouth, and the dessert, which was served at its most perfect state. 

Wine:
The waiters were very helpful in picking out a nice wine for the table. When in doubt, just ask the waiter on job recommendation of a nice pairing for the wine.

Ambiance:
The restaurant is really quiet and a great place for an executive dinner or date. There is also a bar in the front of the restaurant and the decor is beautiful. The bar is also a good place to watch a game while enjoying a cup of beer.

Price: 
Given that it is a hotel restaurant by a 3 star Michelin chef, it's not expensive. Given that it is after all a steak house, I'm not disappointed with the quality of the steak. I would probably only go back if I was craving a real quality steak.

I started with the wedge which was bland. Needed salt and more blue cheese. Then came my ""rare"" dry aged strip steak. The waiter was thoroughly disinterested in us to begin with and did not ask us to cut into our steaks. Although there was a small line of rare meat in the middle, the rest was gray. We could not get our waiter's attention, but another waiter came over and explained that we just don't know what dry aged beef is supposed to look like. Oh really? My mild mannered husband had reached his limit and asked for the manager. She did bring us 2 new steaks. Same thing. The middle had zero flavor. And the outside was not charred, but more like a charcoal briquette - bitter and burned. Their steaks are accompanied by 4 disgusting sauces. Our friend's sea bass was dry.

Appetizer calamari. The squid was decadently tender and just melted in your mouth. I regret to say that it was a bit on the salty side but we weren't unhappy enough to send it back, but Boris gave us another pelligrino on the house for it. The siracha mayo has this lemon tang to it. Super delicious. I just don't understand why they gave you a whole bowl of the sauce. You really don't even use 1/30th of it. Lol.

Shared the prime rib special with my brother, and it was really good. First of all, this dish was meant to be shared so it was massive. I can't remember how many ounces it was but we had trouble finishing it. It had a breaded crust that packed on some great flavor and there were so many sauces to use if you aren't too fond of the cilantro thyme herb (Boris listed all the ingredients, but I just remember a lot of greens) butter that it comes with. Everyone else's steaks were cooked to perfection as we'll. be warned! That tomahawk rib eye is huge, and you should consider sharing it if you plan on getting sides like we did. 

Lobster mashed potatoes were not so great because it was served like a purée, which is definitely not what I'd look for in mashed potatoes. The black truffle Mac and cheese is soooo good. I'd get an order to share! The mushrooms were also a nice side and I would order again if I ever came back. 

Would I come back? Yeah if I won money gambling. Haha! It was definitely not light on the pocket. Overall, I want to give this place 3.5 since the food stood out but there were some issues with the food as mentioned above, but for Boris I'll round up!",2rcsjlkUKJHetytXh8PRdw,0,0,4,Lzk5uwMgWOVQFx441rd0Og

Atmospherewise, the music is weird and I think kind of emo.  Which, also, believe me, I would totally have ignored if the food blew me away.

But it just didn't!  I was so excited to try all of the sauces offered for the steak... I am a bearnaise man through and through, and was so excited to try that and the hot sauce, and everything!  However, 5 sauces on my rib eye, and none of them were amazing.  - Also at $60+ for an 18 oz. ribeye is crazy expensive... other places offer a way bigger cut for that much- were just not wowing me.  

I will say this, the salted caramel ice cream--- AMAZINGLY GOOD.  Almost pushes this review to 4 stars.

I don't really have anything bad to say about Jean Georges.  The experience should be one that wows me at their price point, but sadly Jean Georges didn't wow.  First up was a sushi sampler.  Extremely small, tasty morsels of three types of fish on a deep fried rice cake with a spicy mayo.  Not bad, fish slices could have been more generous, but not wow.  Some soy sauce with that maybe?  The main was the Australian NY Steak.  It comes with four sauces; a house made habanero butter sauce, a soy miso sauce, a flat bernaise sauce and some ketchupy kinda thing.  Can you tell how I felt about the last two sauces?  There was also a bone marrow shaped container of a salsa verde that was very nice.  Did I really need five sauces with the steak?  Nothing offensive about it, just sometimes less is more maybe?  The mashed potatoes were quite buttery, very nice.

We were staying at the Aria for our wedding on Saturday night and wanted to make sure that the entire weekend was top-notch. Jean George Steakhouse came recommended as one of the best dining experiences at our hotel.

Our concierge made reservations for us at nine and we were seated after a very short wait. It looks small from the entrance, but don't be deceived, this restaurant is huge! The decor was generally very posh, but as you enter the restaurant, you walk past a circular bar. 

The bar is gorgeous ( a cool black lace type of pattern), but the effect is ruined by the TV's behind the bar. Although upscale, there is no sort of dress code and there were many people at the bar in jeans and scruffy tee-shirts. Although I generally dress this way, it was a bit of a let-down to see it at such a nice restaurant, especially on a Friday night.

The waitstaff was generally very friendly and personable. We joked around with them and it gave the place a but of a casual air. It was comfortable. They were also very professional and attentive, with our course coming out at a good pace and our drinks always full. It felt like we had a team of servers, as we interacted with many different people. 

We went with the five course tasting menu with wine pairing. Each course was beautifully and artistically arranged. I wanted to take pictures, but it just didn't seem appropriate! It was often too pretty to eat! 

The first course was Caviar served in a lemon and on a bed of a lemon jelly. It was delicious. The second course was tomato based. I can't remember exactly what was on it, but it was very good. The third was scallops- my favorite course! I can't recall the fourth course, but the final was an amazing cut of steak. We added the truffle mashed potatoes, which are a must-do! For dessert, we had a chocolate mouse. Everything was outstanding.

A piece of advice- If you do the wine pairing (and you should) skip having a pre-dinner drink. I actually got fairly drunk and couldn't finish or properly enjoy my meal. It's a big undertaking, go in on an empty stomach!

Also, be prepared to spend more on pictures. They had a photographer going around to the tables and our pictures were so good, that we bought all of them. We spent about 150.00 on the pictures alone. They were great though!

Jean George Steakhouse is a decadent meal. The food is upscale, but the vibe is relaxed. I'm glad that we went here, but it isn't a good pick for a ""romantic"" restaurant, which is what I was hoping for on my wedding weekend. It's loud and busting. Fun and vibrant.

We were warmly greeted by the hostess and brought to our table at the back of the recently renovated room (No more cow noses on the walls).
The decor is warm and inviting but for us, the tables were a bit too close. The conversation next to us completely dominated anything we tried to say to each other... and I may reference those diners during this review just for comedic value.

Our party of two was celebrating a birthday and the staff absolutely pampered us! Two glasses of Prosecco were brought out, much to my surprise and delight!

An Amuse Bouche of Truffle Fritter was brought to us and it was beyond delicious. (see photo) Just one bite but it prepared me for the feast yet to be delivered.

Another Amuse Bouche soon followed. A smaller version of their Tomato Salad- with avocado, hearts of palm and Coconut Vinaigrette. Very flavorful! (see photo)

Bread was brought to us on a wood block. Warm, fluffy, a bit sweet, a bit salty on top and 100% addictive. If the bread was this delicious, I couldn't wait for the main courses!

And then the table of 4 conventioneers sat next to us, loudly bragging about their expense account. Well, so much for our quiet, intimate dinner.

But there was no way I would let others ruin our evening...

We ordered a 18oz prime bone-in dry-aged ribeye and 12oz prime New York strip and sides of the crispy potatoes. 

The steaks arrived cooked to perfection (medium rare) and with side sauces- House Steak, Miso Soy, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet Butter and Bearnaise. I tried each one, loving the experience and how each sauce added something different to the meat itself.

Meanwhile, on my left, the table of four ordered 4 portions of the 3oz Kobe, once again loudly boasting of how ""it wasn't them paying for it.""

Our crispy potatoes were served in a small, cast iron pan with Chili Yogurt, Jalapenos and Dill. Yum!

This was truly more than just a meal, this was an entire experience!

And then the Kobe steaks arrived next to us. The fella to my left got up to go somewhere, leaving that tender little Kobe sitting all alone on its plate. The girl across immediately picked up her little vessel of green sauce and DUMPED IT all over her Kobe, earning an audible gasp from me. Seriously??? Okay, not fair of me to judge but why would one cover Kobe completely in sauce before they even tasted it? Oh, that's right... they weren't paying for it.

The one 3oz Kobe continued to sit neglected. I finally offered to reach over and snatch it off the plate and pop it in my mouth if someone didn't tend to it soon... I think they heard me, they finally began to settle down a bit.

Back to us- I truly savored each bite of my strip, letting each piece melt in my mouth. Just so perfect! My husband enjoyed his ribeye but also said he would try a different cut next time we dined there. 

We shared one warm Valrhona chocolate cake with in-house made vanilla ice cream for dessert. 

With full, happy tummies we enjoyed the rest of our evening together, giving full credit to the staff for starting our night with an amazing meal and amazing experience.

As for the conventioneers, I hope they appreciated all the work that went into their meal. I know we sure did with ours!

PS- probably not necessary to include comments about other diners in my review but it was part of our evening so there you have it.",1N6jrRkNvnbthfLN07Yn4A,0,0,5,N8laaINA31fTM2uaApsDKQ

We got a nice table that was in a half circle which made for great sound. The menu is a silhouette of a cow, which made the cute bone marrow-looking dip holders interesting.

Skipped appetizer but had the lychee bellinni. refreshing but wimpy in terms of alcohol, which i like

meal: got the 8-oz Filet Mignon. Fantastic! the meat was well done (they butterflied it for me) but very moist and juicy. 

my side was the Black Truffle & Comte Fritter. these delectable balls of goodness melted in your mouth. the truffle taste was perfect. i wish they gave more but there were about 8 or so on the plate. so i got my fill

i tried the hubby's salt and pepper baked potato. interesting. the entire skin is encrusted with S&P. i might try this at home

no one ordered the broiled bone marrow, but i have tasted bone marrow before and i am sure it was probably good there.

i love the sauces they gave and i slathered mine in the soy-miso butter. i recommend that sauce. the miso on the filet was excellent.

dessert: the group shared the lava cake. always good. but who can go wrong with souffle?

Ambience- very dark and loud, like you're eating dinner in the middle of a club. 
Service- just okay, nothing exceptional, once I declined wine list I was never offered any other type of beverage. So what if I'm not a big wine drinker? I could've easily ordered 10 cocktails instead! 
Food- also just okay. Steak was cooked to order, but served lukewarm. Also served with multiple sauces. Sauces for my steak? Really? Isn't the flavor of the steak supposed to be amazing enough on its own that it wouldn't need a sauce? Well one of the 4 sauces was tasty, the other 3 just had no place being on the table. Asparagus was flimsy, no snap or crunch. 
Definitely, not what I expected for how much I spent. I will say though that the brioche bread served in the beginning was very delicious, and the guy that kept refilling my water (cause that was the only drink offered) was on point! Water glass was never half empty. So for those two reasons, I give the 2 stars.

I was in Vegas for a conference and had the chance for expense account dining (always the best). I was staying at the Mandarin and had planned to go to Ruth's Chris, but wanted something new and found this place. I tried to find a menu, or just some ideas on the prices, but didn't, but went anyway, alone.

My reservation was for 6 p.m. and I had my ribeye at 6:30 (and out the door at 7:15). Great service. I had the 18-ounce ribeye ($68), a wedge salad, and an apple pie dessert. Plus Pellegrino. The salad and dessert were fine, the ribeye was sublime. I used to cook ""professionally"" (okay, it was Golden Corral) and have been a steak connoisseur for many years. Trust me, this ribeye was extraordinary. 

I love ribeye but hate having a small pile of fat left over. That wasn't the case with this cut. MAYBE I actually consumed more fat than I usually would (my table wasn't exceptionally well lit), but it didn't seem like it. It had a perfect partial sear for that semi-crusty exterior and it was a perfect medium. So flavorful. I almost never put anything on my steaks, but the salsa verde that came with it was a revelation. There were four other sauces and they were fine. I ate probably 1/3 of the meat without anything. 

Two nights before this meal I dined at Smith and Wollensky, where I also had a large ribeye. It was much better at Jean Georges.

We had bacon enrobed shrimp with a spicy peach chutney (winner), beef carpaccio (winner) and a palm heart salad which was different but addictive nonetheless. 
The New York strip had a nice char and flavor on it, but I found the accompanying sauces unnecessary. 
Possibly only serve them on request since purist meat eaters like their steak unadorned. 
I found the flavor and tenderness of the New York strip  won over the dray aged version I had prior.
Once again I had the mac n cheese...cheese bomb delicious!

To start off the meal, they had the standard bread basket with several different varieties of bread.

We didn't try any of their desserts since Jean Phillipe's patisserie was right downstairs and i was dying to try their deserts....

The service was great, and the waiters were incredibly friendly and the atmosphere wasn't as stuffy as you'd imagine. OH and their pineapple mojitos. I noticed that their wine collection was pretty extensive, but the prices seemed to be a little higher than other places on the strip....which is understandable, it is Aria after all.

Bacon Wrapped Shrimp w/ papaya Mustard, Cilantro
Butternut Squash Soup w/Ginger and Basil
Baby Iceberg Lettuce w/Blue Cheese Dressing Crispy Bacon
Salt and Pepper Maine Lobster w/ Ginger and Scallions Buttery Cabbage
Soy-Glazed Short Rib w/Apple-Jalapeño Purée & Rosemary Crumbs
Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae w/Peanuts, Popcorn & Chocolate Sauce

The only downside: the soup and salad were too big!!!  (a rare complaint for fine dining)  We were trying to save room for desert, and had to take some of the entrees back to the hotel.  (the desert was WELL WORTH IT) 
Also there's a gentleman who goes around offering to take table-side photos for quite a high price (we heard the couple at the table next to us.  one large photo and two small for $75!! )  I've never been a fan of being disturbed during dinner- though to be fair, he asked once and then left us alone after we declined.

Atmosphere: Mood is EVERYTHING here. Dark, gorgeous, and sexy. Perfect especially for a date night. Electronic chill music leaves things low key and calm while also keeping the energy flowing.

Customer Service: World class from start to finish and probably what sets JG apart from other steakhouses I've dined at on the strip. With sincerity, the customer service here surpasses many Michelin star restaurants I've visited. Hostesses are warm, food servers are friendly and genuine, and managers with a calm presence graciously came by to check on us during our meal. Every dish was explained along the way. 

Food:
Bread- Four options with a salted butter. Perfect for those like me who revel in the bread basket just as much as they do the actual dishes.

Caesar salad- the kitchen split our salad for us, and it was plenty to share between two as a starter. Nice lemony touch and chopped to small bites, which is much appreciated. 

Bone marrow- the GM generously shared a few bonuses with us, to include this one. Presentation has a solid ""wow"" factor! Of note: bone marrow portion itself is quite small and enough to enjoy on two pieces of toast with a very tasty, vibrant gremolata.

Steak- NY strip was cooked to perfection and served with several sauces, which were all explained by the great staff.

Sides- We had the creamed kale, truffle mac and cheese, and asparagus. Absolutely LOVED the creamed kale and asparagus. Truffle mac and cheese was enjoyable but less exciting than I imagined it to be. Be careful when ordering the first two though- they were pretty heavy on the salt.

Dessert- We had the cheesecake and chocolate cake! Beautiful presentations with multiple creative components. Best when paired with a coffee. :) 

Dining on the strip tends to be inflated, but when you are deciding on where to eat, I can suggest JG as a cut above the rest because of the service; while the food is delicious and great quality, the five-star staff makes this place more of an experience and not just a meal!",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,12,12,5,LUtaP1gjNYWlkbUn3GkcIA

Our reservations was at 9PM, we were seated at 9:20PM. We didn't get our water for about another 20 minutes. By the time we flagged down the waiter, we were ready to order. We asked for the cocktail list and that also took forever. Appetizers came out in a timely manner. Dinner came out 40 minutes after we were done with the appetizers. The couple sitting next to our table received their meal in a timely manner and before us even though they came in about 30 minutes after us. We ordered tea and coffee after dinner and had to cancel it because we didn't receive it after 20 minutes. The service here is ridiculous. I thought it was because they were super busy but we still didn't receive our entrees after 2/3 of the restaurant cleared out. 

We complained to the manager and we found him up front chatting with the hostess instead of managing his servers/staff. He was so surprised when we complaint that we figured no one even made him aware of the situation. What a joke. Note to Jean George: hire a manager that takes a more active role in making sure the restaurant flows smoothly.

3001063,2013-08-14,2,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"my boyfriend had made reservations for our four year anniversary here as a surprise. i never really been to a high end steakhouse before so it was def. a great experience and change.

our reservations were at 7pm on august 9th, my bf planned it that way so that we would be in time for our 9:30PM showing at Zarkana. were about 10 mins late to our reservations since the tram and foot traffic during that time took awhile. i was a bit worried they wouldnt take us in but luckily they were nice about it. 

my first impression on the decor and ambience was def that ""oohh this mighty fancy smancyyy!"" it def gave off that romantic feel and since the lights and decor was on the darker side..it gave it more sexy appeal to it...like mhmm youre getting some you know what after tonights dinner ;) HAHAHA! dont lie, you guys know its true! 

anywho, i am beyond surprised, grateful, and amazed by the staff especially our waitors, doris and boris (i know it rhymes...we were wondering if they were paired up together on purpose lol). they were both amazingly nice, funny, courteous, and all around great! im always a bit hesistant to come into fine establishments like this because even if we do have money to spend..most places tend to age discriminate us because of our age and assumption that we cannot afford it. so i am def. am grateful they didnt do that to us.

service again from doris and boris to the servers were definitely personable and incredibly nice. it was a bit weird they every server that came by came to keep refilling our waters constantly haha. i mean its nice but it was almost every sip we took lol. doris and boris suggested a good amount of plates..and we decided on getting the 12 oz ribeye for my bf, the 8oz filet migon for myself, shared the tomatoe/mozarella salad, and mac cheese/truffle side plate.

everything we ordered was amazingly except the salad since it wasnt even a salad..it was more of a 2 slices of tomatoes and some cheese...like not a leaf or greens ..i wouldnt even called it a salad honestly lol. so just skip that if youre thinking about it...but everything from the meats to the mac/truffle side plate..was YUMMY! our fave sauce was the green pesto that came with our meats and the miso butter sauce.

just when we were waiting for our check or for either doris or boris to come by after we finished our meals..a server came by and dropped off a dessert plate in front of us...i thought he had sent it to the wrong table b/c we didnt order any lol. The plate had ice cream with a candied caramel decoration and a warm chocolate molten lava cake...with a handwritten ""happy anniversary"" in chocolate..it was a TOTAL SURPRISE to my boyfriend and i. i even asked my bf if he had told them to that but he didnt..he just mentioned that it was our anniversary on the reservation though. i think my bf was lying haha ;) 

overall, i would def go here again. i think a lot of people have their own strong opinions of places so if youre thinking about taking a risk..then you should def do it with jean georges! service is impeccable, food was delicious and they def treat you like a king and queen. i am so thankful they made our night even more special with that surprise dessert. i give it a thumbs up!",GDeoUHALgyqK13ewN92Jnw,3,4,4,U61QldwaVMMMGlWgQUMXdw

That afternoon, we glanced at the video menu in the hallway area and decided to make reservations there the same day.  No problem, got right in. 

Seated immediately, and our server arrived for drink orders.  She was great--wish I knew her name.

My husband had the Porterhouse Ribeye, and we added the truffle mac and cheese.  Everything was delicious.  The mac and cheese was good, but nothing to scream about.

I was lucky enough getting top notch dinners for free here at Jean Georges Steakhouse two nights in a row. I definitely can't complain about anything as the foods were simply superb and on top of it, it didn't cost me anything. Thank you my awesome business partners! 

The first dinner, we had tons of food. We started with Nueske's bacon wrapped shrimps, calamari, and heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad. You may recall I hate overzealous servers who always boast everything they serve to be the best. This guy did exactly that. He told us it would be the best and lightest calamari we ever tasted. He also said the buffalo mozzarella was bar none and just the most incredible mozzarella ever. Surprisingly, he didn't lie. Holy shit, those calamari and mozzarella were amazing! AMAZING! I didn't mind him so much after I knew he was just telling the truth. 

My filet was perfect, accompanied by half a lobster tail, creamed spinach, mushroom, truffle mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. Everything was anything you could expect from Jean Georges Vongerichten. 

The next day...though I was less enthused eating at the same exact place, I quickly forgot about it when I sat down and started drinking the house mule cocktail. Whoa! It was so strong and just pure alcohol but it was really good after several days of ass kicking meetings. 

Now, I looked forward to the calamari and the bacon wrapped shrimps again. They also ordered the ahi tuna tartare that hit the spot for me. I started to get sick of red meat at this point and decided to share a bone in rib eye with our host. We had most of the same sides as last night plus truffle fries. Mind you.. This truffle fries weren't like any truffle fries you ever had with a douse of icky truffle oil. This one had shavings of real black truffle on top. The mushroom was also a favorite of mine. It was mixture of various kinds of mushroom sautéed with jalapeño so it had a little kick to it. I ate the peppers and it burned as it went down my throat. Yum!!

The rib eye and the filet were both premium for steak. They also offered a $270 6 oz of Kobe filet. Hahaha...insane!! 

Both dinners were ultra pricy and I was just grateful that I could enjoy these gorgeous delicious food without breaking my bank. It was also great to spend quality times with people I work with every day. 

Our server on the second night, Boris, was awesome. He was probably the best server ever and was on top of everything. He catered to our host so much and to all of us in the most courteous manner and at the end, after our host signed the whopping check and handed it to Boris, he shook our host's hand. It was so classy.

First off, the service is fantastic. We had two servers dedicated to us. When you see the bill below, you'll be amazed that she remembered all of it without writing anything down.
We started with the sushi sampler, hamachi, tuna tartare, and a Caesar salad. The sushi had two pieces each of salmon, tuna, and yellow tail (I think) on crispy rice. It was very good but surprisingly thin at $24. The hamachi was also very good though not amazing. Tuna tartare was very good as well. I know it's odd, but I was craving the salad. It was actually quite good, but laughable at $16. It must have cost them 75 cents to make it.
For our entrees, my cousin had a tomahawk chop rib eye and an 8 oz lobster tail. His ribeye was amazing! I had an 8 oz filet and 8 oz lobster tail as well. Both were quite good. I really enjoyed the sauce selections as well. We mashed potatoes that were excellent. Had to be at least 50% butter.
For dessert, he had a warm chocolate cake (with the molten center) and ice cream. I had an apple pie with bourbon ice cream. It was fantastic.
This was one of the best meals I've had in Vegas...and I've been to most steakhouses. I admit that I've never been to Gordon Ramsey's place. I highly recommend it. It put Bardot to shame.",zvf4U6LJdNGOEogmmCOsLA,2,1,5,V2bE2B3piW963PFoC0QbpQ

The caesar was average at best. The filet mignon was very good especially with the array of sauces provided (complementary). The chocolate cake was nothing special.

When they brought it to the table and cut it tableside, there were literally 3 slices of edible steak and the rest was pure fat (not marbled meat). We called the manager over, who was very nice and he agreed and ordered us two more steaks of our choice. We ordered a filet and a strip.  These came out and they were tasteless. They were not rested and apparently cooked cold.

First off, the waiter and servers were very accommodating. They were very sweet and even congratulated us on our anniversary. They gave us so much time to make our minds up on the menu and to talk to one another. I really wasn't used to that.

We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and I ordered the salmon while he ordered the filet mignon. 

The calamari was way better than I expected. It was not greasy and the sauce was to die for. It had the texture of tartar sauce, but with a chipotle spicy taste. I was not expecting that at all. It was so good. Drool!

I was very happy with my salmon. It was lightly seasoned on a bed of mashed potatoes. Something about mashed potatoes at a fancy restaurant. They always seem to taste better than the kind at KFC. hehe The vegetables were crisps and nicely salted. Let's just say I was very stuffed at the end of the meal.

Our group of 9 really enjoyed our food. We shared some sides and the truffle mashed potatoes were so good that when everyone was done I licked the spoon and plate clean.. okay, well maybe just the spoon. My friends might have pulled the plate away from me.

The nigiri sushi stacked on crispy rice was a stand out pairing with the steaks. My husband and I arrived late from out of town so our friends ordered us a rib eye and the sushi to create a ""surf and turf"" experience and we were very happy! The sushi was simple but the fish was fresh and the crispy rice provided a nice texture to offset the delicate tender sushi pieces of hamachi, maguro, and sake (salmon) - so a modern touch to classic nigiri staples. 

The ambiance of the restaurant - dark, mysterious, and chic. Lots of artistic touches around the restaurant to gander at while waiting for food and catching up with old friends or also great for romantical dins.

Since we came late, I'm not sure how crazy my friends had been before we arrived, but our waiters did not seem pleased with us being there. I felt like it was a hassle that I ordered food and there was rushed feeling when I ordered my drink. I had the Boulevardier and had trouble pronouncing it so the waiter corrected me but in a tone that brought me back to grade school in English class when my teacher would correct my pronunciations. I still have trouble pronouncing Boulevardier now but geez! I realize that it must be hard dealing with people that are drunk all the time... I mean we are in Vegas... but I had a good excuse, I was just tired from the long drive to Vegas. I was hungry and was not drunk, so I apologize for being an inconvenience. I apologize for my friends enjoying too many cocktails and ordering so much food at the restaurant that we took 3 hours there. 

In summary, the food and decor was super memorable! The front hostesses were super friendly. The guys who cleared are table were quick to clean and efficient.

COCKTAIL: The Ginger Pear

It was a very interesting drink.  I love the taste of pear, and definitely want to pick up a pear vodka so I can make drinks at home.  The ginger syrup was spicy and gave the drink that addictive little kick.

Made with garlic aioli, lemon and dill
Perfect little start to a glorious meal.  Very generous on the crab.  It wasn't a warm dish, and it might've been even better warm.  It was tasty, but out of the whole, it was our least favorite thing.

I asked for this medium well, which I know is not the ideal temp for a piece of meat like this.  But I prefer it, and it was cooked perfectly.  So juicy, tender and extremely flavorful.  My husband's Tomahawk steak was a wagyu hybrid, and his was cooked perfectly as well.  Both steaks came with four sauce selections: soy-miso butter, homemade steak sauce, bearnaise, and a super hot (too hot for me) sauce.  Our favorite was the soy-miso butter.

SIDE:  Roasted Brussel Sprouts
Topped with avocado and pecan
I love roasted brussel sprouts.  This was a very interesting take with the addition of the avocado.  I probably could have done without it, unless you just like bites with several textures.  The brussel sprouts themselves were charred nicely and had good flavor.

SIDE: Broiled Bone Marrow
Served with a side of parsley lemon gremolata and toast points
The creepiest, most carniverous thing they could sit at the table ended up being one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Who knew?  Putting the marrow on toast and topping it with a bit of the gremolata was just an amazing bite.  The richest most intense beef flavor you can imagine.  I would eat this again in a heartbeat.

DESSERT: Salted Caramel Sundae
Vanilla ice cream topped with fudge sauce, candied peanuts and popcorn
This was a cute little dessert, but nothing spectacular about it.  We enjoyed it, it was satisfying, but it certainly wasn't a culinary wonder.  I will say their dessert menu didn't really have anything that interesting on it beside your staple cheesecake, chocolate cake, and apple crisp.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just an FYI.

Our server was excellent.  Was extremely knowlegable, friendly, and expeditious.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience at Jean Georges.  I would recommend this restaurant with two very enthusiastic thumbs up.",5n-q5h4xYeJVSNk1TKMMeQ,1,1,5,RzFjIXOhRUgkFZZDCseaKw

3192933,2016-04-20,1,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Dined here on a Monday night, when the casino and restaurant were not a busy.  Made a reservation in advance, showed up on time and were seated right away.  The restaurant is a little on the dark side (lighting) but still easy to read the menu.  

The server approached quickly and took drink orders and reviewed the menu and answered questions.  The restaurant quickly filled up but the noise level was reasonable.  The menu has the usual steakhouse offerings with some additional modern twists on salads, appetizers, entrees and sides.  Nicely thought out menu with literally something for everyone.  

I had what was called the organic crunchy chicken and my dining companion had the New York strip.  I had their version of pea soup and my companion had the wedge salad.  My soup was delicious and nicely prepared.  The wedge salad was nicely done with not too much dressing.

Steak and chicken came out soon after salads, Timing was good and we weren't rushed.  Both dishes were prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  Our server came over several times during the meal to check on things but was not intrusive.

A great dining experience.

The only odd thing was that during dinner, a light bulb or fixture exploded over our heads and a large (about 6 or 7 inches) metal rod came down from the ceiling and hit my dining companion.  A bit startling and a little disturbing.  The general manager eventually came over to apologize but not much else.  Had it been over about another 2 inches, it would have struck my friend in the head, but instead struck him in the shoulder.  Not sure what was happening there but it was somewhat dangerous.  

Other than the exploding light fixture, the dinner was amazing.",o3xQeIqci2iQB2xAK_sTkw,2,1,4,OOZVEFKbdaoTuADfFm9i9Q

3207908,2013-05-26,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"First off, world, there are so many people with nut allergies out there - why would you serve bread with nuts without saying something about it?! Especially when it has  GROUND walnuts that were not visible nor tasted by anyone in the group! No wonder our friend had a near anaphylactic reaction! Luckily her allergy is not extremely severe or there would be a major problem going on. She did not want a commotion to be made, so I discretely went to the hostess to ask what is in the bread - since all servers were no where to be found. She informed me that it was walnuts and that someone should have told us. Since we were dressed up my friend did not have her EpiPen on her so I asked where the nearest medical station was to get some Benadryl (everyone in our group is in the medical profession so we felt comfortable not calling an ambulance). She got hasty with me and said ""Probably the CVS down the street"" - HELLO! You have a medical situation going on - I'm fairly certain the Aria has a medic or at least your restaurant has access to some Benadryl! I checked back in with my group before going on a mile long adventure and my friend told me she would be OK as long as we were all mindful of her situation. The manager never came out to see how she was doing, no one checked in on us until the end when the server said ""Probably should have told you about the nuts, huh?"" That's it. 

The service was majorly lacking. We felt that because we are quite young (early twenties) we were of last priority, apparently our money was not as good as the older couples in the restaurant. At every high end restaurant we have ever been to (and many day-to-day 'regular' restaurants) allergies are of high concern and we have been asked by nearly every server prior to the beginning of the meal. My friend is very aware of her allergy and waits until her husband tries breads or other high concern foods before she does. It passed all of our ""sniff tests"" because it was hidden with other flavors and was ground. Not excusable. Where in the world was management - clearly the server knew that he didn't say anything about the nuts and the hostess knew we weren't told of it. My friend was not comped even in the slightest. Unheard of.

The rest of the meal was uneventful, food was great. We did the prix fixe meal and was quite good. We were all happy with the rest of our food, despite our general feeling about the restaurant itself.",PIcxwnQUeWHJ67tG5pkWxg,0,0,2,IqDUSXR5v85gxgZQv8E6zA

It was in between a 4x6 and a 5x7 postcard and was about 1"" thick.

3229617,2014-08-29,1,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"This establishment was participating in Las Vegas' restaurant week and they had an interesting menu, so I decided to dine here.  I had eaten here before and had a positive experience the last time around, but it was even better today.

There were four courses provided with a choice for three of them.  The meal started out with the tomato gazpacho which was pretty tasty.  I appreciated the cool temperature of the soup, especially on such a hot day in Vegas.  

The heirloom tomato panzanella salad came next and was pretty darn good.  All of the ingredients were fresh and the star of the dish, the tomatoes, were sweet and juicy and there were a good amount of them in the dish.  The only issue I had with the dish was that the dried bread chunks were a bit too big and should have been cut a little smaller since it was kind of a pain to cut them into bite sized pieces with the butter knife.

I opted for the medium-rare cooked filet mignon which was accompanied with mustard greens and topped with some fine curly, string onions.  There was a cherry mustard sauce which packed an nice punch.  I could have done without the onions and the steak was the weakest link of the meal, but it was still pretty good.

I opted for the bone marrow sides which was very interesting.  Three half bones cut lengthwise exposed the marrow, and a spoon was used to scoop out the marrow to apply on a small slab of toasted bread and parsley lemon gremolata was added to top it off.  The bone marrow itself didn't do much for me - it was kind of tasteless to me and the purpose seemed to be to just leave an oily residue on the bread to make it a little soggy but the gremolata was pretty delicious and made the dish work.

For the dessert, I opted for the white chocolate pavlova which was a real winner.  The crust had a nice delicate texture that melted in my mouth.  I typically go for sweet desserts but the meringue was nice and delicate and overall it was a very interesting dish.  

Service was great and my server Eddie was knowledgeable and friendly.  The bill totalled ~ $100 but it was well worth it.",hkSTeVnKsPM_dQeD5GWsTQ,3,1,5,UP5QbmoPgOEza0oZMPVFRA

Also we was new to eating marrow and the wait or actually set us up our first piece of brioche to show us how it's done!

The room is sexy and dimly lit, but not completely dark where you have to pull out your phone flashlight to see the menu.

We started off with a few negronis and progressed onto wine afterwords. Jessica suggested the beef carpaccio and it definitely didn't disappoint as the aged balsamic completely balances out all of the flavors and cuts through the cheese. Their bread & butter service has to be the greatest in town-- a challah-type bread with French butter and herbs was TO DIE FOR. I had two by myself. 

For the main course we ordered the poppyseed crusted salmon with root vegetables and the scallop dish with bok choy and potatoes. The dishes were presented beautifully and the kitchen does a extraordinary job of presenting an aesthetically gorgeous plate. 

Of course there was room for dessert. The apple pie was recommended by Jessica, and it definitely didn't disappoint.

The positives:

Atmosphere is really cool. Love the design and the layout. It is dark, but I think all good steakhouses should be a little dark.
 
Service was very good. Not exceptional and will explain that in a moment. The hostess was very kind and efficient. We checked in and waited at the bar for the other member of our party to arrive. When he did the hostess lead him to us at the bar and we were seated immediately. 
Our servers (there were two) we very knowledgeable about the menu and were extremely pleasant. However the one server would always interrupt our conversation. After the third time it got annoying. Please wait until at least we finish a sentence before you start to ask questions! If it wasn't for that the service would have been 5 stars. Also, two of us wanted to do the tasting menu, but they refused saying that everyone at the table has to do the tasting menu. Our server informed us that the chef refuses to allow any exeptions to this because it is 5 courses and it ruins the experience if it is not enjoyed by everyone. Really? I find that hard to believe. Everyone ordered an app and 3 of us got dessert an 2 people got salad. That was hard to believe and kind of aggravated us from the start. 

The food was very good, but not really worth the price. We had caesar salad and foie gras to start.  Both were good, but the foie gras (at $28) wasn't worth the price.  However, I had the special which was a 300 day dry aged Australian porterhouse. That was probably the most flavorful steak I've ever had. Everyone else's meal was very good, but each agreed that they have had a better meal. For sides we had sautéed spinach (they originally brought out creamed spinach and had to correct it, but they did this very quickly). We also had mashed potatoes (awesome), lobster mashed potatoes (even more awesome, but that side cost $21- ouch), and a bone marrow app that was very good. 
We had dessert which was good, but not incredible. And after such a rich meal just couldn't finish it. We had the apple crisp with cinnamon ice cream (the ice cream was amazing) and a warm chocolate cake. The cake was good, but so rich we could hardly eat it, even splitting between 2 people. 

Price was pretty expensive. Our dinner was $400 before tip and we did not have any alcohol at all. And one person in our party only had chicken as an entree because they do not eat red meat. 
I think for these prices everything you order should be spot on. And I can say that out of everything we ordered only a few things stood out as exceptional - Bone marrow side dish, lobster mashed potatoes (but very pricey), and my 300 day dry aged porterhouse. Oh, and the cinnamon ice cream. 
I can think of a few other steakhouses in Vegas that I would rather go than this place again. BOA is good, and I still love Capital Grill and Morton's is probably my favorite. 
Overall good, I don't regret going there, but I don't think I want to visit this place again given all the other choices in Vegas.",jqUtxANpCIKOgJz6zdpz5g,0,0,4,eaGLSu8omzTRXKxfv25Kfw

It came with a delicate rice paper chip of sorts that was crispy and dissolved almost instantly once it hit my tongue - pretty neat and well paired with the tuna. 
We both had the aged NY Strip (Waygu beef I think) and it was delicious, well seasoned & probably the best steak I've ever had. The sauces that accompanied the steaks were wonderful and I had a hard time selecting a favorite.  They were all delicious.
The sleek cast iron plates and dishes were really interesting and made the steak look like a piece of art when it was presented. Very dramatic. The Lalique knives were beautiful and well balanced, I was very impressed with them.

Everything we ate was fantastic - steak that melted in our mouths, scrumptious lobster, perfectly cooked asparagus.  

One star off due to an issue over the price of the wine we ordered.  There was a miscommunication between us and the waiter resulting in a few hundred dollar error - something we were not about to pay.  It took quite a bit of dignified squabbling for it be sorted out.  In total, our bill for three people, with the correct bottle of wine, salads, entrees, two sides, pre- and post-dinner drinks, and a dessert: $450 including tip.

The menu had been preselected with one table-wide appetizer, and three to five choices of soup/salad, entree and dessert.  All of the choices appear on the regular menu. 

The table started with the chilled seafood platter, with an awesome selection of oysters, shrimp, crab claws and crab legs. There were multiple cocktail and other sauces - I'm sure this appetizer cost a fortune, but it was truly extraordinary. 

I chose the Burrata Mozzarella (salad), with tomato, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish. 

How disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.

My dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent. 

Two comments on the service. While it was fantastic overall (they were cool when we lingered after closing time), it was annoying when the staff kept asking whether I was having flat or sparkling water, and then when one didn't ask somebody topped off my flat water with sparkling water - not cool.

Atmosphere was dim and romantic with a trendy edge. The wait staff was super helpful with the menu and helped us pick out delish items to try. 

We had the seafood platter to start and it was fresh and alive with the flavor of the sea! I chose lobster for my entree. It was HUGE and cooked perfectly. My husband went for a entire cow (24oz porterhouse) and every bite was succulent, tasty, and tender. The bone marrow side dish tasted just like butter! And finally the lobster mash was delectable and had actual pieces of lobster in it! 

To top it off...the hotel...and I do not how- found out it was our one year anniversary and gave us a warm chocolate molten cake on the house for the special occasion.

As one walks in, it is almost like dining in those underground cave taverns of Europe. A room divider is comprised entirely of hundreds of encased wine bottles on display. The chef's table private room is expansive.

My warm spinach salad with lardons and chevre vinaigrette was tasty. So was the stellar bread basket. No exaggeration: the croustillante and moelleux from their baguette made me devour another basket of just that variety: perfect bread! Loved most the sourdough; great ratios.

Next came my  12-oz NY strip, ordered medium. Done and prepped with a SW inspired dry rub, complemented with a salsa verde concocted sauce. Almost like a chimichurri. Asked for medium...cooked perfectly. But waay tougher than I had expected.

Glasses of bubbly are reasonably priced.

The cheesecake with the sour cherry compote and cream inside of a tuille stole the entire show. A sucker for cheesecake, this plate was stunning, in presentation, form, and taste. Quite good.

The service is great. They use a team system that always leaves someone near by to get you that extra glass of wine or additional bread and butter.

Soft, warm bread that comes with soft, warm, herb butter! KILLERRRR!!! For apps, we ordered calamari and wagyu carpaccio. The calamari was cooked just right and very crunchy. It came with a side sauce which was like a spicy mayo. The Carpaccio was different because it was a thicker cut and different presentation with a yummy flavor. Not gamy at all. I personally ordered the 8 oz fillet with a blue cheese crust, cooked medium. IT WAS AMAZING!!! Soft and juicy and absolutely perfect! For the sides: mashed potatoes which was more like whipped potatoes. Very soft and creamy and perfect with my steak. DO NOT ORDER THE CREAMED SPINACH!!! Worst part of the meal! Flavorless and ""earthy."" I gave my feedback to our waiter who was kind enough to remove the creamed spinach from our bill so that got a ""star"" back for the review.

The watermelon gazpacho was light and refreshing. The pickled peach and goat cheese salad for the first course was delicious. Loved the depth in flavors and textures with the pistachio and crystallized wasabi.

The NY strip had some good-looking grill marks and was nicely charred for a medium-rare steak. But it was a bit chewy for my tastes. The crunchy potato and tomato compote that accompanied it were amazing. My wife's soy glazed short rib was one of the best short ribs we've had (second to Fleur de Lys, back in the day).

She also got the chocolate cake for desert. The one bite I had (that's all she would let me have) was pretty damn good. My key lime pie was fabulous. I loved the pop rocks on top. It was a whimsical addition that added plenty to their modern take on this classic dish.

Even with the RW prices ($50.11 per person) it was pricey after drinks, tax and tip. But that's to be expected from any steakhouse on the Strip. The rest of their menu looked good, so I'll be back to try other dishes.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,3,4,JmI0vWL_TxE0f4jzSsCfrg

After having a bad experience at Lemongrass our first night in, I was needing a reset. This was perfectly that. We were greeted by very kind hosts for an early dinner. Ben and Roberto were our waiters and they were superb!!! Very attentive and genuine. Ben was able to give me recommendations about which steaks and what stood out for each one. I asked so many questions. I got the waygu filet and foie gras over it in the end.

It was amazing... seasoning was perfect for me. I want to taste the beef, not the crazy amount of seasoning or salt. It was great balance that really enhanced the steak. The foi gras was cooked excellent. It was fluffy in the center but perfectly seared outside. Very rich and full of flavor. Also, Ben taught me to order a rare plus which would be a cross of medium and rare. Perfect blend for me. I want the cow to still moo a bit. Dinner were brought out in very timely manner. Our drinks refilled quickly. 

I also tried my friends Kobe beef which is their specialty steak. Rich, heavenly marbelized beef that was so succulent. Definitely recommend!!! Bone marrow was also very delicious and rich!!

1) The atmosphere is very sexy, dark lighting, and not fit for casual attire.  So to you Las vegas tourists: DO NOT go to this place in your half-wrapped towel, flip-flops, and swim attire after you've left the party pools (haha).  Ladies and Gents, don't be afraid to put on that nice sheath dress/or that tailored suit you've been wanting to wear; but have been saving for a special night.  It'll work out just fine here!
2) The cocktail menu is a decent size with unique and interesting specialties, and the beer selection isn't bad either.  I ordered The Diablo cocktail (I like a little spice), and I had no complaints.  The wine list is quite impressive as you can imagine as well. On to the food:

We ordered the Jumbo shrimp cocktail (which is hard to mess up in fine-dining), and oysters on the half-shell (which I look for anywhere I go). Both dishes were fresh, and I had to stop myself from ordering more oysters (haha). For dinner I ordered the Wagyu filet, and the table ordered sides of mushrooms, brussel sprouts, and the truffle mac and cheese.  No complaints with anything, and the filet was like BUTTER!

The fixed price menu posted on the website was not actual. The new menu was $20.00 higher and not even close to what some guest may be expecting.  $20.00 isn't the point; it is the inaccurate information on the site.

For example,  I noticed a fleck of cork when I was testing our wine bottle's first pour; I didn't make a big fuss, but nevertheless, he quickly changed out my glass and later brought me a complementary glass of another label. Also, they gave us a complementary chocolate cake and ice cream with ""Happy Anniversary"" hand-written in chocolate on the plate (something I didn't even request). A+ for service.

As for the food, it was wonderful. My wife had the rib eye and I had the filet; both were excellent. I highly recommend the soy miso sauce, one of the four sauces they bring to the table. I tasted great on my steak, and I'm sure it would make an excellent pairing with any seafood dish as well. The green jalapeno sauce was my second favorite. Would recommend the black truffle cheese fritters as a side dish too, they were delicious. A for food

I noticed a few reviews that complained about the music. I honestly did not feel that it was too loud, although the choice of songs at times seemed a bit mis-matched with the overall look of the place.

I had party of seven and it was pretty make a reservation, but it was most likely because it was on a Monday night. Our server was very nice, and the place looked very nice in my opinion.

I ordered the rib eye steak and my girlfriend ordered the filet minon. Our steak was just okay, it wasn't anything special. My steak was very bland and it came with four different sauces on the side which I did not really care for. My side order was the bone marrow but that was also very bland... 

I wouldn't go back to this place especially if I am looking to have good steak, I would say going to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is probably a better choice.",nhfjacp8y9DkRtBnLusuwQ,1,1,3,Jqx0dCG4eXVY4oTte-HW1w

It would have been nice if we were told about this when we made our reservation 6 weeks ago or even when we confirmed.. Surprise Surprise!  The portions were very small which may be expected since there were 5 courses.. At $175 per person I would expect some wine pairing.. Sea Bass was very much over salted.. I did enjoy the lamb which I chose over the tenderloin.. But I had my heart set on a real steak... not lamb or tenderloin.. I would have traded all those little portions for a fat juicy steak... While eating I kept closing my eyes wishing I was at a Morton's.. Do your customers a favor and tell them about the fixed menu in advance..

My first dining experience was almost exactly a year to the day and was a rather sub par experience.  However, this time around it could not have been a better dinner for my client and I.  

The restaurant is quite beautiful and has a great vibe.  We started with cocktails which came very fast and were quite good.  We also ordered a bottle of wine and had the Sommelier decant it.  Upon opening the bottle and pouring a tasting amount in the glass, he quickly took it away and stated it was not up to standard for that wine.  We had not even tasted it when he took it and brought a new bottle of the same wine and vintage.  We did end up tasting both and while the bottle he took away was not bad, it was not up to the same level as the replacement bottle. Major kudos for that! 

I ordered the burrata cheese and tomato appetizer, which was delicious and my client ordred the Caesar salad.  For our main entrees, I ordered the Dry Aged bone-in  NY and my client ordered the Wagyu Filet.  We decided to share them family style and neither disappointed.   The Dry aged NY was outstanding but did not shine as well as the Wagyu - not a complete surprise considering it was Wagyu.  Our side dish was french fries with truffle and parmesan - also quite good.  

The service was excellent.  All staff working our table were very polite and friendly and very attentive.  Never had to make a single request!  Overall, this was a fantastic dining experience.

The Wedge Salad was a perfectly sized portion and full of flavor.  The Iceberg Lettuce was crisp and juicy....the thick slices of Bacon added a ton of flavor to it....yum!

The Better Half enjoyed the Shrimp Cocktail.  She almost got full off the Jumbo Shrimp.

I had the Filet, which was heavenly.  Juicy, charred just right, and full of flavor.  It comes with a choice of sauce and I always get the JG Steak Sauce.  The sauce compliments the Steak and doesn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the Beef.

The Black Truffle Mac n Cheese is spectacular as well.  Very rich and creamy.

The prices at this joint are not for the budget-minded diner.  Don't fool yourself....if you don't want to spend the money, don't dine here...you'll be disappointed.  However, if you want a great meal in a chic restaurant with awesome service, then this place is for you.

--Lobster tail: To compliment the lobster they gave us lemon, margarine, and a minty pesto sauce. Surprisingly loved the hint of minty flavor!! 
--Bone in rib eye: Cooked to perfection. Very juicy. Loved the 4 sauces Jean George provides to pair with.

To be honest, JG's restaurants are my #1, always.

Everything is just perfect from the very beginning to end. I'm a very picky person especially when it comes to my food taste and at JG's restaurants I find the best cuisine and service.

When my party and I arrived we've been nicely greeted at the door, confirmed our reservation, asked us if there were any allergies in our group. After that we've been escorted to the table. In literally 30 seconds our server touched our table, greeted us and offered some drinks. We've ordered a bottle of Merlot. That night we ordered the Pork Rib, Filet Mignon, Foie gras, 2 Wedge Salads and 1 Truffle Risotto. Oh boy was it delicious.

My other big gripe is the availability of cuts on the menu. There were 12 cuts of steak offered on the menu but they were out of 7 of them! If you're stocking such low levels of certain cuts, make them specials instead of putting them on the menu - or at least tell us you're out before you hand out the menus, so we don't pick 3 cuts and get told each time that you've run out.

The bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.

Coure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gelée with some crème fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gelée filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gelée,

Coure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  

Course 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  

Course 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.

Course 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.

Comments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.

I did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.

The staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.

I liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.

It's a huge pet peeve of mine when host staff seats us in a quiet restaurant next to the only other table in the restaurant thats occupied. I understand keeping people in the server's sections but the place was EMPTY. I requested to be moved and the hostess acted put off and bitchy. Very rude and snotty about it. I graciously blamed it on my father's tendency to tell loud stories after he's had a few glasses of wine--but really there is no excuse for this.

4076302,2012-09-11,2,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"The thing about Vegas is that there are tons of great food places, so I'm always blown away by the food.  The ambiance and the service was excellent here, but the food was only okay.  I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Here are my thoughts:

Service: 4 stars
We had a great waiter and I wanted to become best friends with one of the staff members.  Because we had to wait so long for some food to come out, he gave us some complimentary wedge salads.  We also got asked a bunch of trivia questions and if we got them right we got free molten lava cake desserts.  Probably because they had extras (our desserts said Congratulations! on them yet we were celebrating nothing) - but hey, a free delicious dessert is a free delicious dessert.  My one complaint was that we didn't eat THAT much food, but our meal lasted over 3 hours long.

Ambiance: 5 stars
Loved the decor - confused a bit about the lit walls and what that design is (it's on the menus too).  Not too dimly lit like some restaurants.  I was happy I could still see my friends I was dining with.

Food: 3 stars
We got a bunch of food.  Like a lot.
+ I forget what wine we got but we got a Malbec for $42 that was decent.
+ Oysters - excellent.  Half a dozen for $20 is about standard. 
+ Tuna tartare ($20) - not bad, but I've definitely had better. 
- Pork belly spring rolls ($20) - not great.  The sauce was overpowering, and two tiny egg rolls essentially (fried - so not spring rolls like advertised), and the pork belly was just okay.  Not really worth my stomach filling up for.
+ Spinach salad ($14) - I'm in love with goat cheese (which was the dressing) and bacon - big fan
+ Wedge salads (free for us) - I usually dislike bleu cheese, but this dressing was mild enough for me to enjoy.
- Porterhouse steak $60) - ordered it medium rare - I think the order must have messed up because it took quite some time to come out (hence the free salads maybe?).  My portion was a bit charred and underwhelming.  Not great tasting to be honest.
+ Chilean sea bass ($42) - small portion for the price.  Came with a bunch of sauces though and I must say the miso-butter sauce complemented this really well.  The shiitake mushrooms were roasted pretty darn good too.
- Black truffle and comte fritter ($12) - underwhelming.  Cheese wasn't gooey enough and truffle taste wasn't as strong as expected.  Waiter said it comes with 7 balls - we got 8.  Score?
+ Bone marrow ($16) - pretty darn good.  Wish there was more.
Molten lava cake (free for us) - amazing.  Rich, perfectly balanced with the homemade vanilla bean ice cream.

Some of the food was decent, but I would say I have had better and that for the price we paid, it wasn't extraordinary.  I happened to see Michael Phelps here during our meal and have talked more about that then the actual food.  Granted, he could be yummy in his own sense I suppose :D",C0kGy1QWXvOd5gLDp3mMlw,3,1,3,aHlSi4pZIMJDrGWj9mwytw

Our bartender whipped up perfect cocktails and we enjoyed the atmosphere and a couple chats. The atmosphere is dim, romantic, and the art compliments the restaurant.

I had a choice of fried calamari which was cooked to perfection and came out HOT (a pet peeve when tempura comes out cold) with a mayo based sauce to accompany it which was absolutely fantastic, The boyfriend had foie gras and everything on the dish complimented one another.

While this is from the same Celebrity Chef as the Bellagio's Prime Steak House; there is little comparison in food between the two.  This was a MAJOR disappointment.  A party of 3; two of us started with cocktails.  Apple Martini tasted like a Virgin Martini.  Had to send it back for Vodka.  Espresso Martini tasted like it was made with burnt coffee.  

Appetizers:  Lobster Bisque - the WORST I have ever tasted.  Campbell's Soup would have been more welcome.  (so would Safeway brand).  Sent it back & got the Foi Gras with Apple Jalapeno Jelly.  Was more like Jalapeno Jalapeno Jelly.  Could not taste any fruit.  Nothing fruity or acidic to cut the richness of the fat that is inherent with Foi Gras.  Simple balsamic Vinegar would have made this far more enjoyable.  At $32.00 for an appetizer it was quite displeasing.  Other appetizers at the table were a Wedge Salad; which came with only a tiny drizzle of Blue Cheese dressing.  It took several requests to get more.  A beet salad was OK, but nothing exciting.

Entree's - Two New York Strips and one of the evening's specials, a 16 oz Bon-in Fillet.  One Strip was ordered Med-Well, came to the table Med-Rare.  The other was cooked properly (Med) but full of Gristle.  The Fillet was the only saving grace of the evening.  Cooked Rare as ordered and cut like butter.  Truly delicious.  All came with the House Verde Sauce on the side (Jalapeno based) which did not compliment the flavor of the meat.  We ordered Béarnaise on the side, which went much better.  

For sides, we ordered the Black Truffle Fritters which were listed as being made with a cheese ( I don't recall the exact variety).  They were a house specialty, or so we were told.  Once again, all we could taste was Jalapeno.  I could have sworn that there was even a hint of Jalapeno in the Asparagus.

After the main course, we had enough of the very pricy and mostly palate displeasing offerings.  For desert, we went down to the Casino level for delicious offerings at Jean Philippe Patisserie.  

My advice is to stay far away from here.  If you want a good steak, there are plenty of fantastic options available in Vegas, Including Jean-Georges good offering - the Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  His named offering is simply awful!

4132231,2011-09-10,4,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Jean George's Steakhouse is a favorite of a good buddy of mine, so when he hits up Vegas, we often drop in for dinner and and drinks. I have been a few times and really like the style of the room and quality of the steaks. 

We started our most recent trip at the bar with a couple of martinis. Very well made and very friendly service from the bartender. We had mentioned that we were having dinner inside and he offered to have our bill transferred, but we paid the man, as we didn't want him to lose out on the tip. We only waited about 5 minutes and our table was ready. 

It seems every time we dine at Jean George's, the tasting menu is where we go for our food selections. It's a great price around $80 for 4 courses, and has a jalapeno-relish foie gras course that I really dig. We often add to this menu with an additional side item or appetizer, but I find it to be a lot of what I like about the restaurant. The food is great, and t he steaks for the main course are always prepared just the way we ask with exceptional flavor. 

I have to say that over the past few times I have ben there - service has not been consistent. The service staff that handles the food always seems a bit 'ho-hum' with their service style. It's not about the casual nature or a friendly demeanor, both things which I appreciate about a server.. but just a kind of a lack of interest maybe? Could be they are amongst the busiest places at the ARIA Hotel, so maybe there is just no time for personal service? It never leaves me impressed, but that's just me. 

I will say that the Sommelier's and bar staff are always extremely friendly and attentive with service.  Every bottle of wine is attended to properly and  never has my glass been empty or even less than plenty :) To add to that, the dining room is situated that I don't feel i have ever had a undesirable table. The most recent trip had us sitting up against the glass room that held the wall of wine for the restaurant. really nice space.

I would most-definitly go back to Jean Georges again, as it is very good food, and I do like the atmosphere. I say start in the bar with a good stiff drink and have a great bottle of wine with your steaks! Happiest Eating!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,12,11,3,m0BTHfWpfqUuNRVtZ9nbIA

I would HIGHLY recommend the tuna tartare, the squash soup, and the Chilean sea bass (portion about the size of my palm but LOADED with flavor). The ""hand cut fries"" were definitely not handcut (frozen), idk why they serve them there.

Having a business dinner with my husband's clients, he decided Jean Georges Steakhouse in Aria would be the locale. Having eaten there twice previously, I was pleased it was here due to the positive food experience. 
We arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday and stood by the bar, cocktails ordered and in hand, awaiting for the last couple to join our party. Once arrived we were seated in the back room formally called the Board Room. 
Our server and two additional servers arrive, more cocktails and wine is ordered, appetizer orders placed. We ordered a variable bevy of appetizers from the menu, a mixture of cold and hot. A couple iced towers of raw seafood, giant prawns, mussels, crab legs, very firm and delicious. A couple platters of sushi and calamari and then a couple salads (I ordered a Caesar with avocado- not bad, but the dressing was quite bland and extremely creamy). 
Loads of different meals ordered, I had the ginger-miso sea bass which was huge in size and flavor, quite scrumptious. My husband ordered the rib eye steak and a side of asparagus. He commented it was good. Our dinner mates ordered the same rib eye, but someone else ordered Kobe streak, salmon, wagyu carpaccio, and I believe someone just got a salad with salmon. Other sides were the Mac n cheese which I personally didn't try, but it was noted as good, creamed spinach (yuck), French fries, Brussel sprouts, and baked potato. 
Desserts were fine, nothing striking. We ordered the apple pie skillet( dry and not very tantalizing), chocolate lava cake (tiny, also dry and a bit bland and boring), a couple scoops cherry sorbet and a yummy cranberry sorbet, the best thing (and I don't really love sweets) was the vanilla ice cream with hot fudge poured over. 
Service in my opinion was attentive and fast, although one person commented the server should have known more about the different cuts of meat. Boo boo. 
Ambience is very dark, sleek and sexy, would be good for date night or trying to impress clients. 
Dinner for 10 people, plus a couple bottles of wine, a few cocktails and 4 glasses of grappa (like a foul smelling, foul tasting grape lighter fluid digestif), was I believe about $1600, tip included. Common price for an establishment such as Jean Georges.

4178748,2011-11-25,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"After have a ""taste"" at Sage, we continued our journey to Julian Serrano for part two of our tasting tour of Aria. We had to stand around and wait for a hostess at Julian Serrano that never came. In a resort casino with plenty of other high-end restaurants willing to take our money, we left and wandered upstairs to try Jean George (located on the second floor above the casino next to Sirio and Michael Mina) which promptly assisted us.

Obviously, we skipped appetizers and went straight into the main course which was a $90 steak special - the Wagyu-like Australian tomahawk chop (think bone-in rib eye with the dark fatty outer cap trimmed). It was an embarrassing piece of meat. The steak lacked everything you'd expect in a cut of beef. It missed flavor, fattiness, and tenderness.

Then there were the steak sauces. I'm a purist who believes a steak sauce needed for bad, flavorless steaks. A really good steak is perfection on its own. Even though the tomahawk was heavily seasoned and charred to create flavor, five different steak sauces were served. This isn't McDonald's or Chik-Fil-A where customers have a choice of dipping sauces for the chicken nuggets. The chef should make a decision and pick one sauce that fits the flavor profile of their cuisine. Instead, it was a colorful Benetton nation of sauces with an airy French hollandaise, a bright and refreshing Mexican salsa verde, an overly sweet BBQ sauce, a super-hot southwestern scotchbonnet, and a mellow Asian tamarind. Aside from the BBQ sauce, they were all expertly executed, but none were good matches with the steak.

The sides were thankfully small and a decent-sized for one person. We tried two sides. The Brussels sprouts with pear and bacon had a forceful zing. By itself, the sprouts were dry and not very exciting, but the acidity helped contract the fattiness of beef. The mushrooms with goat cheese polenta were a disaster. This was the second greasy and overcooked polenta I had that night. The mushrooms were sadly dried-out and tough.

The Mollydooker South Australian Shiraz by the glass was a very nice wine and well suited for the evening.

For dessert, we had a glass of Moscati di Asti that was a fine match with the cinnamon crème brulee with cocoa nibs and figs on the bottom. The use of cinnamon in a brulee is a very smart decision. I can't believe other chefs haven't done this. It seems like a completely obvious combination, but I guess when something is that obvious, it's easy not to think of it.",yz0s55qwi_WqVjmbyZ9ICw,3,0,3,Cl9iNd6YLlsPI91gx6AC4A

We made a reservation and showed up on time, took about 3-5 minutes before they seated us. My first thought was that it was very dark, as most high end restaurants are, your eyes adjust quickly.

Appetizers: A variety if bread was brought out quickly which I liked. We started with a crispy sushi sampler with chipotle mayonnaise and tempura calamari. The sampler came with 6 pieces of nigiri, 2 salmon, 2 tuna, and 2 hamachi, with crispy rice. The calamari was easily in my top 3 favorite calamari I've ever had, it was fried perfectly, light and crispy. The whipped chili sauce was by far the best calamari sauce I've ever had. 

Entree: we decided to split a 8 oz. Filet mignon, which was cooked very well, peppered and crispy on the outside yet pinkish on the inside. Four separate dipping sauces were brought out with the filet homemade hot sauce, soy-miso butter, béarnaise, and JG steak sauce, my favorite being the béarnaise. 4 oz. was actually a good size, but my girlfriend not finishing her own gave me another 2. With the filet we got a lobster mashed potatoes which were fabulous, small bites of lobster with creamy mashed potatoes. 

Desert: We were actually too full to order desert, so we passed, but the people next to us ordered the honey crisp apple pie with bourbon ice cream and boy did it look good. We did get some coffee as dessert I guess.

Now onto the food. I ordered the 8oz. Filet MIgnon and couldn't even finish it! Granted, we did order a buttload of sides, but the steak was cooked just to perfection and served with a tantalizing green sauce (I wish I remembered what was in it!). For sides, we ordered a bunch so all 11 of us could share. We got french fries (came with lots of dipping sauces), truffle mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus, and a shitake and artichoke side. The truffle mashed potatoes was hands down my favorite side dish, they were absolutely to die for!!

4241285,2017-05-07,13,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"When it comes to Vegas steakhouses, they're all pretty much the same -- hi-quality cuts of meat and obscenely overpriced sides, everything a la carte to drain your retirement funds as quickly as possible. Ambiance is the only variation, so I'll address that first.

This place is dark and cavernous, with an aesthetic somewhere between modern douche and old-school clubby swank. There was nothing really standout about the atmosphere that would make me recommend this place over any other steakhouse in Vegas -- not nostalgic enough to be kitschy or fun; not edgy enough to be hipster. Service was good and all staff was attractive, well-groomed and marriageable. Nothing spoils a pricey meal like ugly staff!

The meal itself was good enough for being so hubristically priced; I understand paying a premium for top-quality cuts of meat, but for reals, guys....how can you with a straight face charge $14 for a POTATO? All you did was rub salt on it and throw it in the oven. Get over it!

Aside from my hi-class potato and petite filet, which was fine and came with some kind of spicy chimichurri-type sauce, I also had the truffle mac and cheese (SUPER rich, almost too rich to enjoy) and the spring greens salad, which was so totally blanketed in cheese that I barely tasted the subtle deliciousness of the crunchy greens. Why go thru all the trouble of sourcing organic/sustainable/whatever greens when you're just doing to dump so much cheese on it that it masks the flavor? Weird. Everything was so over-the-top rich that I ended up stuffed after only a couple bites of my steak...so my dog is enjoying the rest. (He said 5 stars, but he doesn't get out much.)

Overall, it was just fine. Moderately less pretentious than other swanky steakhouses in town....but certainly nothing exciting. I would come here again, but only if someone else was paying.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,15,9,3,grJ44PpBixB-yg027kJJzw

Lots of places to go in Vegas for Steakhouses. I did a fair amount of asking around, and I was staying at Aria so I wanted to check out Jean Georges. I was a single diner and sat at the bar. Gary was great at the bar. Enjoyed his company throughout dinner, and he provided great service. 

Plenty of comments about the ambiance on here...dark decor, classic steakhouse feel. Full disclosure - I never left the bar area (which did have a TV for watching games). 

On to food and drink reviews. Cocktail menu...I didn't look any further when I saw a Boulevardier on the menu, I'm a sucker for it. One of my favorite cocktails. It was good. Personal preference is Campari over the Aperol. Also prefer to be served neat/up instead of on the rocks. 

I also hadn't eaten much that day so went for the tasting menu. First course was caviar dish served over a lemon gelatin. This one didn't really do it for me. Never fair to compare anyone to French Laundry, but I found myself longing for the ""Oysters and Pearls"" caviar dish from French Laundry. Next dish was the tuna tartare. Presentation was great on this one with the tall rice. Really enjoyed this one. Next was the burrata and fruits. I love burrata! Delicious. Could have done without so many apples and more burrata, but I also enjoyed this. Next up was the seared diver scallop. I don't eat scallops as often. Was good but wasn't out of this world. 3.5-4 stars out of 5. The dish I was most interested in trying was the Wagyu beef tenderloin. The steak was cooked perfectly (Medium-rare), so I appreciated that. I could tell the flavor was there. Where I left feeling disappointed in this one was the asian glaze, sauce that was distracting me from the great cut of beef sitting in front of me. I found myself trying to get the steak out of the sauce on the plate to not overpower what should be shining here. Found myself wishing I may have just gone with the large bone in ribeye instead. Lastly, the dessert was also delicious with a peanut butter brownie sundae. Very rich - couldn't finish it all at this point in the meal. 

In conclusion, I'd come back here again, but I would be sure to pay attention to how they were preparing and serving the steak. I want it to be simple but delicious rather than distracting. Appreciate the great service!",Fb9W3Lj1rpANWYv61iFtDg,2,1,4,Ln_coOm15nfXkzGiFBd6Wg

4491293,2014-10-12,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"I crave a steak every once in a while. Jean Georges makes a succulent one! It was cooked perfect to my tastes with a little pink inside. It is a good size but when my aunt couldn't finish hers and offered It to me I didn't turn it down. ( I usually decline offers like that but it would have been a sin to say , ""no"". ) The waiters came by and dropped off the sauces. They both said the Miso was their favorite I tried it but I'm sticking with the Bernaise for my personal choice.

 I also had a side of lobster mashed potatoes. I've got to say they are not the best that I've had. They were runny and just too salty. It was the color of a drab pumpkin. There were only a couple of pieces on the top and that was it. I was expecting chunks of lobster mixed into regular mashed potatoes or even better some garlic mash. It was hard to eat it all. 

We finished dinner with the cheesecake and glazed cherries. I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I saved that for my husband and ate the glazed cherries.

My sister, who wasn't planning on coming decided to come with her 4 month old.  We told them we needed 1 more seat.  No problem there.  When they saw my sister walk in with her son, they said they don't allow children under 5.  Not 10 seconds after she says that, as my brother is talking to hostess, a family walks out with 3 kids.  The oldest couldn't have been 6 yet, and the youngest was still an infant.  I walked to the host station and showed her my platinum mLife card and she went and talked to the manager.  He came over, shook my hand, and offered a bottle of wine on the house, and obviously allowed my nephew to join us.  My nephew didn't make a peep all through dinner.  
Onto the dining experience.   We were seated at one of the large round booths.  Very comfortable and was easy to see and hear everyone.  We got some form of enormous seafood platter as an appetizer for the table.  Alaskan king crab legs, lobster tails, oysters, clams, and prawns.  Everything was delicious!  They server told us about the specials.  One was a Kobe filet for $210.  Wow.  There was a half Kobe half Wagyu bone in rib-eye that they aptly dubbed ""The Tomahawk.""  Check the pictures, I will upload one.  This thing was big and tasty.  It came with a green sauce on the side that was good, but I prefer my steaks with no sauce.  The server picked out a good bottle of wine, for free remember!  It went great with the steak.  
For dessert, my girlfriend and I shared a Crème Brulee.  I have yet to have a bad Crème Brulee....

The waiter was unable to recommend which meat is the best for ordering it medium well and which wine would go nicely. Food took forever, and our time was limited so the mood went a bit down. The steaks were good, but not best I had in Vegas. However, I loved both truffle mashed potatoes and cream corn. Delicious!

Our server was very helpful and strongly recommended all the items on the menu marked with an MP for market price. Of course they are. We decided to pass on the $270 6oz Kobe filet but appreciated the recommendation for a steak that runs $720 per lb. 

We ordered the truffle Mac and cheese and the creamed corn as our sides. Mac and cheese was delicious, creamed corn was meh. Wouldn't get that again. 

I'd give this place 4 stars if our team of servers didn't disappear when it was check time. I think I waited 30 minutes for my check to be delivered.

4579837,2015-01-08,2,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"I am a big fan of Jean Georges. I have been to their steakhouse in Scottsdale a few times but this was the first visit to the one in Aria. The menu was pretty similar but they décor and atmosphere were very different. Oddly enough, the one in Scottsdale seems much more vibrant and fun. This one was a bit dark and stodgy. But maybe I just felt that way because it was pretty empty (we were there right when they opened at 5pm) and also our waitress was a bit stiff. It was fun to see the modern art interpretation of the cows face on the wall and udders over the bar.

I was happy to see online that they had a pre-theater early bird special tasting menu for only $69 which included soup or salad, choice of 3 entrees, and a dessert. The waitress didn't offer this up as a choice so be sure to ask for that menu if you interested. She also kind of downplayed the value saying that it wouldn't be enough food unless you ordered additional sides anyway. In the end we decided to order off the regular menu. Hubby got a porterhouse with a Caesar salad as his starter and mashed potatoes as his side (everything is a la carte here). He absolutely loved his steak and potatoes but the Caesar was one of the worst we've ever seen. Hunks of lettuce, gobs of bland dressing and then parmesan shreds that looked like they had been grated hours if not days before. For $16 you would just expect better. That is a pretty high price for an appetizer sized salad. As for me, I started with the butternut squash soup and that did not disappoint. They do the bit where they bring you the bowl and then pour the soup in tableside. That seems to be a thing at high end restaurants nowadays. For my entrée I ordered the short rib and let me tell you that definitely the best value on the menu. Even though it was only one rib, it had a decent amount of meat on it... probably 6 oz at least. And it was well seasoned with a caramelized sauce and a good char on the outside. Very delicious. And it came with some pieces of fried polenta that were delicious as well. Crispy on the outside and rich and creamy on the inside. I wish I would have realized that this would be so much food because I also ordered a side dish, the Brussels sprouts which I didn't really have room for. These were pretty bland and boring so no loss there, except the $12 I paid for them.

After our meal we agreed that we didn't have any major complaints about the food (other than the high prices) but the service was a little intrusive. Our waitress kind of hovered over us. She also kept pressuring us to order more drinks. When we received the bill we were shocked to see that we were charged $4.50 for each diet coke my husband drank. I guess there are no refills, which I understand some restaurants do, but $4.50 for a small glass of fountain soda with no alcohol in it is just ridiculous. For this reason alone we will likely not return. I also saw that my wine was $18 a glass even though I am fairly certain that on the menu it was listed as $11 a glass (I ordered the Malbec). By this time we didn't have time to argue because needed to get to our show (we had tickets to see Zarkana). Also since it was our anniversary we didn't want to get into a negative confrontation with the waitress who seemed like a real odd bird anyway. I will say it was nice that she brought out a small dessert for free for our anniversary but it was not really welcome since we had already said that we were too full for dessert and in a hurry to go.",Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,3,2,2,u_c7qg5MYA9Bz2cYfhb-aw

4629512,2011-08-30,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"We came here as part of a package deal we received with Aria.  

Let's start with the service.  It was decent and somewhat attentive, but for this type of an establishment, I would have expected a little more.  There were a few times where our water glasses stayed empty for a while, but w/e.

We started with the Tuna Tartare, which was the highlight of the evening.  Just a perfect blend of shitake mushrooms, tuna, turnip, and other stuff.  I wish it was served with something other than the ""unfinished"" eggroll wrapper for crackers, but it was still delicious.  Definately a must have.

For dinner, the wife and I shared the 26 oz Tomahawk steak (granted 8oz was just the bone) and the 8oz Australian lobster.  For the sides we had the Bone Marrow and the Sauteed spinach.  

The steak was really well cooked and the sauces they served with it were ok.  Of the 5 sauces, the habenero dill was my favorite.  The others weren't really worth mentioning.

The lobster is something I would steer clear of next time.  It was a little overcooked and rubbery, and the taste just didn't cut it.

The bone marrow was excellent, if you like gelatenous gooey goodness.  The parsley-lemon gremolta they serve with it was awesome, wish they gave more of it.

Spinach was so-so.

For desert, we had the warm chocolate cake.  We proabably should have just passed on this, because it wasn't very good.  Kind of like a chocolate suffle but without the deliciousness of a suffle.

Also worth mentioning was the Cherry Yuzu soda.  This was so good, but at $8 per glass, you might want to take it slow.

Overall the experience was great.  The bill ended up being ~$300 for everything, which isn't bad.  However, if I were in Vegas in the mood for steak, I would definately go to Craftsteak and have the Kobe Wagyu pre-fix.  Its about the same in price, but much better tasting food, with a greater variety.

I think if it wasn't part of the Aria package, and technically free, I would probably be more upset at dining at Jean Georges.",Wnq2IPWfp9_BpELf7bj5Zw,0,1,3,-kaj5zJ9DRq1VY7RCiKTsg

The bone in rib-eye was cooked perfectly and very high quality beef, could stack up with any other steakhouse in Vegas.  Slightly disappointed in the truffled mac cheese, very weak truffle flavor.

We enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer, but we left the pear and horseradish sauce on the plate, it was a rough combination. The shrimp appetizer is 3 pieces for $24, and the waiter offered to add a fourth piece for $7 more, but we declined. Around the same time as the Appetizer, the waiter brought us an assortment of fresh breads; pretzels, raisin, sourdough, and a crisp cheese crusted flatbread. They were good, as any fresh hot bread should be. 

For our entrees, my husband chose the crispy short rib with polenta fries, and the truffle mac n cheese for his side. The short rib and the glaze on it was melt in your mouth delicious, the meat was falling off the bone, so good. The truffle mac n cheese was awesome, the pasta was so tender, the sauce was creamy and perfect, and the crumbs on top gave it the perfect little crunch. Grown up mac and cheese at its finest.

I ordered the crispy organic chicken with spinach, and the brussel sprouts for my side. Before my food arrived, i was expecting it to be a chicken breast half pan seared and roasted to make it crispy, what i was actually served was large whole chicken breast cooked to perfection, then coated and fried in a batter that sort of reminded me of a tempura batter, but better. The batter was light and did not stick to the chicken so i was able to enjoy both separately and together. It was not greasy or overly seasoned at all. The chicken was served on a bed of sauteed Spinach and a cheese sauce. It was deciduous putting all those flavors together. The side of Brussels were good, not amazing, it was about average of what you would find at other restaurants but appearance was beautiful. They were roasted and served with thick chucks of bacon and thin slices of pear(?). I wish the brussels had been roasted a bit longer so they had a bit more tenderness, still i enjoyed the dish anyway.

We asked for the dessert menu and instead were served a plate of their warm chocolate cake (chocolate lava) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to share in celebration of our anniversary. It was a sweet gesture (no pun intended), and it was the desert my husband was planning to order, so he was in heaven. I am not a fan of chocolate cake, but it was good, maybe things taste better when they are free lol. The ice cream was amazing. Creamy and smooth, served on a be of sweet vanilla powder with a piece of caramelized sugar laid on top. It was the best ice cream ive had in a long time.

Price wise the meal came out to much less than we expected, having been to other steak houses I  the strip, i believe it was appropriate for the quality. I give this restaurant 4 stars for the service and food. But i was tempted to give less because of the photo service they provide in the restaurant. We had a photographer come to the table and take a few pictures. We reviewed the prints and selected two, expecting that they would be pricy, as in $40 range for the pictures. I almost choked when she came back with my receipt for $70. Definitely only something i would purchase on an occasion like this, but for that price?! Wow. We would never accept that again. It didn't ruin our night, just a bit of sticker shock before we headed over to the cosmo to enjoy the rest of our night.",-ny1Bf-sGl2w1RGMmTOzYw,1,0,4,UJ0QIUd6ItdP_sV9yk2Miw

We've been to quite a few high end steak houses and pretty much know what to expect when they say good meat.
The food was definitely below average.... actually to be blunt the filet mignon's were terrible. Nothing we've had or would expect. Side dishes were a joke... Side dishes are small to begin with but their's was funny. No wonder the waiter told us that it would be best to probably order a ""few"" of each side order.. A ""few"" of each side order ??? Really.. But we understood why when we got them. It looked like the toys my 5 year old plays with in her miniature kitchen. The taste on the side orders and the appetizers were NOTHING to brag about. Baked potato soaked in salt and this is supposed to be gourmet.. Overall the food was a complete disappointment, service lacked horribly and the interior was nothing impressive either. After experiencing the food and ambiance of the SW at Wynn, Jean Georges is miles away.
There were 8 of us and we couldn't wait to leave the place.
Oh, they were more expensive on every single dish than most of the really high end steak houses !! It's ok to charge, but you must deliver accordingly.",7-SKlfKZY7OUsok8hoyrMA,1,0,2,Vn93lD7nkC4Qy1ygDGl_kA

They have a great bar area with a nice view... We were taken to our table where our server Brad took very good care of us.. 
As for food, I had my signature bone in ribeye and Brad did ask the chef to cook it the right way... I was surprised that it was charred on one side only... Chef, next time you owe me both sides, maybe he was worried on not getting it ""rare"", anyways, the steak was great, very good flavor and the right amount of fat for the ribeye...
We also had the bone marrow...  ""Flinstone"" type of bone in your table... For my taste, chef, you should send it with some thick salt on top, it will give it this extra kick... The toast you sent is maybe too thick for such a delicate taste, maybe go to the drawing board on that one... 
Brussel sprouts were nice and crisp... My partner had the petite fillet with the foi gras on top... He was very much pleased by flavor and tase, so again, high five there... 
We also had a couple of bottles of Darioush, I would hope this place would keep wine at the correct temp... They were both over the serving standard.... Glasses were fine...
The place was clean.

4958355,2018-04-10,4,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Huge bummer of a dinner at Jean Georges, which I was highly anticipating.  We had a reservation at 8.  We arrived right on time and were seated about 8:05, which is not a huge deal at a big time steakhouse on a Saturday night in Vegas.  When we sat we were immediately approached by one of our servers.  We were told that we would be having 2 servers for the evening, but the second server basically took our order and brought the check.  The other guy did all the work, but neither one of them were very attentive.  We had more than one occasion where at least one water glass was empty.  Further, a buddy of mine ordered a Captain and Coke and the empty glass sat on the table for quite some time.  Way too long for a place of Jean Georges' caliber.  The service was a major issue.

To eat, I went with the wedge salad, the bone-in ribeye, crab legs, and the table split black truffle mac and cheese and lobster mashed potatoes.  The gratis bread arrived hot and is served with sea salt on top and an herbed butter.  It was very good, I only had 2 pieces which was a minor miracle.

The somm was fantastic, really the only bright spot in the meal service-wise.  He was very knowledgeable and had a nice offering for me in my price range, which was on the MUCH lower end of JG's wine list.  This place is expensive for wine, even considering it is located in the Aria on the Las Vegas Strip.  So, unless you spend your summers in the South of France or own several homes, you'll probably be in for some sticker shock.  That said, the bottle that was recommended was excellent.

My wedge salad was good, it is a little more compact than other wedges I have had, but the blue cheese dressing and bacon were both good quality.  I would order this salad again.

The food was served hot but this is where the meal broke down.  My ribeye was overcooked well beyond medium rare.  I ate some of it (less than half) because getting the server's attention was difficult, and like I said earlier, they did not come to the table often.  So, rather than wait for another steak and have the rest of the food get cold, I placed it on another plate and ate my crab legs only.  The server noticed when they came to clear the table and I showed him the interior of the steak and he agreed it was overcooked.  He asked if I wanted another one and I said no, I did not want to wait.  They did remove this steak from the bill, so I will give JG that.  Overall, the steak was not seasoned properly and did not have a good char on the exterior.  So, this $70+ ribeye was a complete miss.

The sides were very underwhelming as well.  The black truffle mac and cheese was perhaps the worst mac and cheese I have had at a fancy steakhouse.  The breadcrumbs were not so much toasted as just put on top.  The truffle flavor was there, but the cheese was not.  Very weak sauce and another bummer.  The lobster mashed were better, but still nothing to write home about.

The crab legs were phenomenal, cooked properly and tasted great.  These and my salad were the bright spots in the meal.

As I said, very disappointing dinner that I was highly anticipating.  I may return to JG in the future since it does have a very good reputation.  It is possible I ate there on an off night, but with so much being subpar, that seems unlikely.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,6,3,2,BcG7EcenmxD9zW1L2v7rJg

I forgot to rate this grade-D, worse than Shoneys steakhouse. Maybe Jean Georges intended this restaurant to be of high quality. I will give him the benefit of doubt since I don't even know who he is. But the clowns that work here and especially those responsible for selecting and cooking the cuts of meat need to go back and start from scratch. 

A NY strip steak had the appearance, texture and taste of a sirloin you would get from the meat department right before its expiration date. Side dishes were sadly the highlight, which isn't saying much. Damn, I wish I remembered the other aspects of this horrible meal but its probably a good thing I don't. 

I will rejoice when I hear this place has closed down and Jean Georges has decided to retire from the restaurant biz.",FbZ0aJU5saPyHYDHI-nXKg,1,2,1,YEu16WbTzgzPzwRykDPHRA
5022941,2012-08-06,4,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"The girlfriend and I chose Jean Georges Steakhouse for dinner for our first day in Vegas.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 7:45 reservations.  The hostess informed us that our table would be available at our reservation time, but we could wait in the bar.  So we did, but decided against ordering any pre-dinner drinks.  Less than five minutes after our reservation time rolled around, the hostess tracked us down and led us to our table.  After a quick review of the menu, we opted for the Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairing. 

Our first course, Almas Ara Caviar over a Meyer Lemon Gelee with crème fraiche, and dill and served in a hollowed out lemon half, arrived at the table. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ It was beautifully presented.  More importantly, the contrasting tastes and aromatics of this successfully executed dish really kicked the meal off on an impressive note.  Unfortunately, our paired wine didn't arrive with the food, instead being delivered by our server halfway through our first course with basically no introduction beyond the appellation and varietal.  Our second course, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro was well executed and nicely presented as well, but the dish wasn't all that original in concept and didn't provide the ""wow"" of the first course.  Sadly, like our first course, our paired wine again didn't arrive with the food and again it arrived without much of an explanation mid-course by a different server than the first.  The third course, a roasted Chilean Sea Bass topped with grilled Maitake mushrooms and a miso-yuzu glaze, sounded outstanding in its description, but was the night's biggest miss. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#GetRHNqeg8V60PcU-iEc0w The fish was cooked perfectly, but its topping was excruciatingly salty to the point of being inedible.  It was so salty that even after scraping it off of the fish, it was still salty to point that it overwhelmed the delicately flavored sea bass.   At least by this course, the wine arrived with the food (delivered by the second server), as was the case with subsequent courses.  Our fourth course, the grilled Wagyu Filet Mignon with grainy mustard and warm potato salad in textures, was a great rebound as our steaks were dead-on perfect medium rare, tender and flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#Uy27bZHUGqAet7HnHcT-pw  It was paired with the best wine of the night, a Cote du Rhone.  This course was the best marriage of food and wine of the night!  Our dessert course was the JG Candy Bar, which I can only describe as six deconstructed candy bars kluged together like a sweet, rich Frankenstein's monster. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#SmNL9RpX6i_VDuiZDsb_SA  It was paired with a Madera.

While the food was, for the most part, well executed, and the wine was generally enjoyable, the service side of the house seemed awkward and lacking the depth of knowledge one would expect from a fine dining establishment like this one.  The gf and I aren't really wine snobs, but we do enjoy wine with our food.  If we enjoy a particular wine that we're served in a restaurant, we often will seek it out and buy it to enjoy at home.  Therefore, it was a huge foul that the service staff wasn't more familiar with the wine that was being paired with the food since we really enjoyed the Cote du Rhone served with the filet.  In the end, I felt the Tasting Menu especially with the wine pairings was a poor value.  While we certainly never felt rushed, I got the distinct impression that Jean Georges Steakhouse was more concerned with getting diners in and out rather than providing a truly memorable dining experience.  What a shame.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,8,5,3,80nRuqKH13rrPjssj7UUVg
5033237,2011-08-03,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"This is a pricey steakhouse, and as far as their entrees, it is totally worth the pricetag. The service, however, is mediocre, at best. We had an 8:30 reservation, and arrived about 10 minutes early. We were not seated until 9:10. I assumed the restaurant was overly busy, yet that was not the case. We sat at the bar to wait, and though I did prompt the hostess about our table, she simply apologized (we were not comped with absolutely anything). 

Once we were seated, we ordered the ""sushi sampler"" as an appetizer (around $30). The waiter insisted we get salads before our entrees, but thought the ""sampler"" plus a salad, plus an entree would be too much. Little did we know that by ""sampler"", they meant four tiny pieces of crispy rice topped with raw fish. Though they were delicious (I think the chipotle mayo they use is awesome), you'd better order three or four appetizers if you're really hungry (like the crab leG...yes, singular). After our tiny appetizer, we waited about 25 minutes to get our entrees. Again, it was odd given that the restaurant was at about 30% capacity, on a Friday night. We got the Chilean Seabass with MushrooM (again, singular, in case you're wondering), for around $40, and it was absolutely delicious, flaky, and buttery. We also got the bone-in Rib-Eye steak (I think for around $60), that came with three sauces (two of which the waiter annoyingly insisted were his favorites). The miso soy butter is to die for, and it perfectly complemented both the steak and the fish. We also ordered the truffle mashed potatoes and the bone marrow as side dishes (each for about $20). The mashed potatoes were good, but nothing to rave about. As for the bone marrow (on toast), it was delicious. 

We were celebrating a birthday, and we did get a complimentary flourless chococalate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Nothing to get too excited over, but it was a nice gesture. 

Overall, it is a delicious place and we would go back, yet the service is absolutely lacking. For the pricetag you'll end up paying, you'd expect top-of-the-line service.",p6jBxxG6TA5mAD6slTQ6sQ,0,0,4,PMdaGCfINEF-9Ole0-XvHw

The hostess was not very pleasant or friendly and stated quite clearly they were not open yet. I apologized for being 4 minutes early and I thought I had made a complete mistake coming here. Well....I was wrong.

Jean George is tucked away in the Promenade level of the Aria hotel and even though I have been a guest at Aria for years, never noticed it. It is beautiful with a bar at the entrance and elegant seating within the restaurant. 

We ordered a bottle of wine from their very professional and knowledgeable Sommeliere, Jason. Our server was Jack and he treated up like VIP's. He knew everything there was to know about the restaurant and dishes he served. Jack (a different one) the GM of the restaurant also checked in with us which was a nice touch. Since we were so early we ordered from the ""Early Evening"" menu which is $69 + tax and tip. It includes a starter, main and dessert. Well worth it if you are able to dine between 5-7pm. You can also add anything A La Carte from the main menu. From the early menu I ordered the Caesar salad (good), filet mignon (one of the best I have ever had) and the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream (so good). I had to order the Truffle Mac & Cheese from the regular menu. It was not as hot as I would have liked but was awesome.

Every moment here was 5 Stars, so I had to overlook the initial non-welcome I received from the Hostesses.

Nope. Not a mistake. 3 star average is dead on.

Service was very attentive and friendly. The round of appetizers looked amazing - the table ordered a few is the seafood platters on ice. I'm not big on that stuff so skipped it, but the tuna tartare was tasty.

On to the meal - I ordered the 10oz dry aged strip, medium rare. It wasn't even close to that, it was cooked unevenly from medium to medium well, which is a crime. I never send food back, but did not hesitate to this time. Second steak has the exact same problem. Not sure how a steak place can screw up a good steak twice, but they did. At that point I ate a few bites because I was hungry.

When the waiter asked if I wanted it boxed up, I told him to take that back to the cook and tell him to learn what medium rare feels like to the touch before he ruins any more.

Coworker had the same steak, also a little over cooked. Said it was one of the more flavorless and tough steaks he's ever had. Same opinion from me. The pieces I did eat, had no flavor at all.

Should have stuck to something bone in.

Stay away from the typical Steakhouse starters and you will be rewarded.  Classic dishes evolve with the ever changing seasonal ingredients and seasonal specials abound.

A beautiful heirloom tomato salad topped with milky Burrata, accented with fresh blue and blackberries, slivered cucumbers and a drizzle of aged balsamic is outstanding.  Refreshing.  A fruit salad at its best.  

Feeling spendy?  The golden osetra caviar on egg toast is outstanding.  From the tasting menu, requested ala carte.  Two thin slices of gently seasoned, toasted bread, a salt / sugar cured egg yolk sandwiched between, a generous heaping of osetra caviar atop.  The yolk of the egg accentuates the yolky flavor usually associated with the glistening pearls of goodness.  Nuttiness, creaminess, and an oceanic wash coat the palate.  Heaven.  

Steaks are very well prepared.  Very well trimmed USDA prime cuts including Australian and Japanese (A5 grade) wagyu.  All with an incredible sear, made even better by the addition of rendered beef fat as the grilling process over apricot wood reaches its conclusion.  Even cooking and always to temp.  The porterhouse for two, the best of both worlds with a generous filet and NY strip all in one.  The A5 Kobe steak is the real deal.  Available in increments of 3oz, the cooking technique adds a crust usually  found only in Japan where a 2200F ""kiln"" is used to cook the beef.  The sweetness at the surface is excellent.

Something other than steak?  The Colorado rack of lamb, excellent.  Extremely meaty, the fat cap only lightly trimmed naturally basting the lamb while becoming well rendered and crisp as a crackling.  Perfect mid rare as ordered.   Not to be overshadowed, the braised soy glazed, Mishima Ranch short rib, excellent.  Perfectly cooked (not stringy), tender, extremely moist and beefy as expected.  The finishing soy glaze incorporates fermented black bean paste giving the beef the umami finish usually reserved for dry aged steaks.  

Very good wine list with some vintage depth.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

All told, an improvement in the quality of starters, beautiful playing and use of modernist techniques has elevated this Steakhouse to contemporary fine dining.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,31,28,5,or6KnCFzrQlFFhW7dq_Zog

On Saturday night, we asked for the last possible reservation which was 10:45 pm. When in Vegas, I like to do everything late :) Maybe the somewhat loud music was also because it was later in the evening? 

A lot of different servers came to our table which was a little confusing but maybe they were just trying to move us out more quickly? We started with a yummy bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and the tuna tartar and lobster bisque as appetizers. These, along with the bread selection including ""pretzel bread"" were a great start to a great meal. 

We ended up choosing the salmon with truffle vinegarette to share as a main dish. The salmon was almost sashimi-rare and was delicious especially with the truffle vinegarette on top. This dish also came with chopped up brussel sprouts which I loved and special mashed potatoes that I'm pretty sure also had truffles in them. Have I mentioned that I love truffles and feel so spoiled every time I eat them?! The bone marrow was also very good and so salty. We had to ask for advice on how to eat it...

This restaurant wins the award for the most exceedingly surprising meal of the year as I saved this for my last review of 2013! The average yelp rating does not do this place justice and based on my overall experience with their service + signature tasting menu, I ended my recent Vegas trip on a very high resounding 'pitch perfect' note!

Signature tasting menu:
1. caviar w/ creme fraiche and lemon gelee (the lemon gelee was more for decoration but the caviar and creme fraiche tasted good together)
2. tomato salad (many components to this dish - large tomato with smaller heirloom tomatoes + avocado + other things i can't remember, wish i took a picture but components were lovely, very good flavors)
3. scallops (wished i had more, no complaints)
4. soy glazed short rib (probably the star of the meal, came with an apple hash that went amazing with the short ribs, which by the way were mouth-watering tender)
5. wagyu filet (brussels sprouts which reminded me of kale - four different dipping sauces that were fun although the flavor of the steak was great on its own, cooked medium rare plus)
6. chocolate mousse w/ mint gelato (mint flavor was not overpowering and i loved the chocolate candy dots on top, added a fun crunch)

A common theme throughout each course is that there are many well thought out components to each dish. Sometimes simple is better but when the elements taste so harmoniously together, it's hard to complain. Also the turnover time between courses was impressive and on point. One of the truly satisfying and complete tasting menus that I've experienced in Vegas (which is quite a brick ton) and would highly recommend for your current/next visit!

Counting down to 2014:
9 - Nine o'clock and kitchen was still open!
8 - the number of meals (including late nights) I had on this recent trip
7 - the number of meals I wished I had (earl's sandwich at 3 am is a scary line lol)
6 - the amount of courses in the tasting menu
5 - five stars for service without a doubt
4 - for sure it was a memorable time
3 - three winter nights (including ice skating fun!) culminating in this final meal
2 - two people who left with big smiles on their faces
1 - one month until I'll be back
0 - zero reasons not to come to Jean Georges Steakhouse!

They charge $4.50 per soda, and push refills agressively without telling you it is not free refills.  Even after finishing my entire meal, the waitress asked again and luckily I said no.  My advice is order a coke, but ask for just two ice cubes, they fill a glass with ice and you get almost no soda.

Super classy decor which is fitting with the Aria look. Our server Ramon was warm and accommodating as he explained the dishes to us.

For apps, we ordered Wagyu Carpaccio and
Tomato Salad with Hearts of Palm and Coconut. The Tomato Salad was just alright, but the Wagyu Carpaccio was outstanding. Melt in your mouth texture. The truffle combined with the sauce just completed the entire flavor experience. Highly recommend!

Next up we got 12 oz NY Strip and the Soy Glazed Shortrib with Granny Apple & Jalapeño. 

For the NY strip, we were provided five steak sauces to enhance the flavor of the meat. Gave them all a try and each had its unique taste! My fave was the soy miso butter sauce. Steak was perfectly cooked to medium - one of the best I've ever had!

Now for the short rib - it was absolutely amazing as well. It sucks that it got a bit cold as I spent too long devouring each bite, but regardless it was great. Super tender (slow roasted forever it seems) and it came with an apple salad that was quite refreshing and nicely balanced the spices in the dish. No wonder this dish won some award recently (Dish For Fall - Soy Glazed Short Rib, 2016 Dining Awards (2016) - Vegas Seven).

For dessert we got the molten lava cake (which was apparently invented by Jean-Georges). The cake was okay but the ice cream was bomb.

The other items we sampled were the oysters, iceberge wedge salad, and lobster mashed potatoes. These were not very notable, in my opinion.

We booked in for a Saturday night meal for 8 of us to celebrate my hubbys Birthday and I am so glad we chose this spot. It was fun, upscale yet comfortable. Not too loud that we couldn't have a conversation as a table. The wait staff works as a team to make sure you are well taken care of. We never had to reach for the bottle of wine, our glass was always being topped up, and when the bottle was near empty, another was there to replace it. The bread to start is very good - I am picky and loooove good bread!. Then the meal, wow. Mouth watering good. I opted for the seafood platter while most went for steak and my Father-in-law went with the sea bass. Not a single complaint... well, we did all think that the side dishes of asparagus, brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and mac n cheese were all a bit small. For $16 a side, they should be a bit more significant. All though if it's a meal for two, I guess they would be fine. 

They had a photographer that came out to take pictures, and a lava cake on the house with Happy Birthday written on it. All in all, it was just a wonderful evening and I am so thankful we chose it. I would 100% go back.",G3h8pIclwUbuu3itJqF7ug,5,4,5,LhxBIRXIKcw032rlSebdFQ

5279315,2018-03-27,3,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"At this time the most popular Restaurant request amongst out-of-town guests, even those infrequently dining on Red Meat compelled to visit by a wide range of Appetizers, Salads, Entrees and Sides, it was as a party of eight that dinner was enjoyed at Jean Georges Steakhouse on Friday evening, a five course meal large enough to feed twelve once again leaving several diners speechless and the rest already planning a return visit. 

Still the longest tenured Restaurant on Aria's star-studded second floor, Chef Vongerichten occasionally  paying a visit but the menu and day-to-day cooking left to the talented Sean Griffin, it was just prior to a 6:30pm reservation that guests were  seated in a rounded booth where Beverages and Bread were served quickly, the Prix-Fixe Menu beginning with eight signature Wagyu and Truffle Gougeres plus a fully loaded Shellfish Tower featuring plump Gulf Shrimp and Lobster Tails plus Crab Legs as thick as some adult women's  forearms.

Not yet turning the page from Winter to Spring, though subtle changes and seasonal Produce have persistently allowed  Chef Griffin to customize a menu even for a table of Vegans, it was with the last few Oysters and Clams slurped from their Shells that a trio of Salads next landed  in duplicate,  Jean-Georges signature Heirloom Tomatoes with Hearts of Palm not losing a bit of its freshness during colder months while the chopped Wedge and the new Spring Salad with Peas and Avocado shined thanks to its various textures and herbaceous Green Goddess.

Matching high prices with larger than average portions, the $15 Bone Marrow always a jaw-dropper as it is served whole with Parsley Salad a la St. John, course three additionally presented two plates of Crunchy Organic Chicken that remains unparalleled even in Restaurants that specialize in fried Bird, the Tempura Batter standing at least a quarter inch off the Skin and delicious on its own but even better when paired bite-for-bite with sautéed Spinach soaked in Butter and Hot Sauce. 
 
Certainly not forgetting the Beef, everything from USDA Prime to certified A5 Wagyu available at a price, it was on a large tableside cart that Wagyu Brisket and a 42oz Tomahawk were sliced and served along with a sizable Dry-Aged Strip Steak, each prized by a different part of the table with a former ""well-done"" Midwesterner  particularly praiseful of the Medium-Rare Meat from Mishima Ranch while others marveled at the full flavored Strip and Brisket that was not merely fork, but spoon tender.
 
Complimenting Beef with Sides, the Steakhouse's signature Crunchy Potatoes and buttery pureed Spuds with Black Truffles both as good as usual, those looking for something more seasonal may wish to turn their attention to simple Grilled Asparagus or elegant Pea and Carrot dishes while those who simply cannot get enough Meat are invited to dress up their Steaks with seared Foie Gras, grilled Salt Water Prawns or Scallops currently offered atop Polenta with Bok Choy, Peppers and Bacon.

Rounding out the evening with a platter featuring all five of the Restaurant's current Desserts, none new but all novel to seven first-timers, suspicions were confirmed that those who enjoy Passionfruit were particularly taken by the Gold Bar while the Market Apple Pie, Cheesecake and Salted Caramel Sundae all had their fans with not one bit of any returning to the kitchen despite many saying they were ""too full"" for Dessert before the wooden board's arrival.

FIVE STARS:  Although some may wish to argue the merits of Luger's or Bern's nationally and Carnevino or CUT locally there is really no comparing any American Steakhouse to what Sean Griffin and his team at Jean Georges Steakhouse have been rolling out since last year's renovation, everything from the service pieces to Meats and Produce upgraded from an already fine baseline to a level that defines world-class.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,8,5,ognhyB6ZfYmLnLIbbOPZXA

Looks fancy from the outside but inside it looks no better than a basic pub with very dim lights. Not very luxurious for a restaurant of this caliber. Cold tables with no tablecloths, and they don't enforce a proper dress code, so if you prefer to look nice, theres people nearby with tshirts and shorts. I ordered a Filet mignon and for an entre, the portion looked like an appetizer at best, and all you get is the meat, nothin else on the plate. I asked the manager why it took a full hour for the entres to arrive and he said that per health dept, all meat is from the freezer and takes longer than normal to fully cook. They weren't busy at all and there were like 10 waiters hovering around, but the service was terrible as it took 30+ min to get the salad, which was far from restaurant quality.

What more can I say? It's Las Vegas, Everything is ridiculously overpriced. Was the price worth the hype ? Hell No. 

Jean George has made a name for itself nationwide for having best and highest quality of food. I guess when opening the Jean Georges steakhouse in Las Vegas, it became all about the decor and not the quality of the food.

When you walk into Jean Georges, just by looking at the beautiful and extravagant decor, you know you're not walking into a budget friendly environment.  We chose this place because the Jean Georges in New York has amazing quality of food so we expected the same here.

We ordered the steak, it was pretty good. It just lacks that ""wowwwwwww"" factor. When it's a $$$$ type of restaurant, you're expecting to leave with that taste of satisfaction that the price of the meal isn't even relevant.

The service was impeccable. The waiter attended to us the entire night. With me being picky, we had a hard time picking the right bottle of wine, so we sampled and purchased many glasses of wine before picking the right one. And thanks to the expertise of our waiter,  we found the perfect bottle of wine for us.

I personally wouldn't return here again, this is nothing like the other Jean Georges owned restaurants. It's all about decor, service and mediocre food here just like many of the other Las Vegas restaurants.",n1rMwb2jUPg_EiyhA-JYgA,3,1,3,P-b_zhHYVn_46qR8zKGKOg

They jump up into my top steakhouse tier that now only includes 3 spots.  I went with my personal classic steakhouse choices since this was my first visit:

Appetizer/salad:  None

Bread:  Pretzel.  This was a perfect way to start the meal.  I'm happy to see that pretzel bread has become a norm at steakhouses.

Entree:  Australian Wagyu 6 oz Filet Mignon.  This was the hero of the meal and it delivered.  That was the sole factor in propelling Jean Georges in my mind.  I had it cooked medium rare, and the taste was amazing!  Perfectly tender.  They offer an array of sauces that were great, but the steak stands alone (how I prefer it).  I'd love these sauces when I'm eating something that NEEDS sauce, but this steak does not.

Sides:  Truffle Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Corn.  Both were excellent choices and would repeat.

5368090,2018-05-04,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"I went to JGSH on a business dinner with 7 business associates. I'm a local and dine there once a year. I was told the restaurant recently had a makeover even though some of the table surfaces are apparently still on the to-do list. My group was seated on the upper level on a big round table tucked away in a mini alcove. It was a great table but difficult for the service staff to reach. I guess whoever designed these tables never worked in the restaurant trenches. We had drinks at the bar. Gary and Jason took fine care of us. Joe, one of the managers, took us to our table, and was kind enough to carry the drinks for a few of my guests. 

Seated at our table, we had a service team of at least six looking after us. The two captains were James and Jack, Elizabeth was the server assistant, Reggie was the sommelier, and Julio, David, and Matthew helping to serve the food. Jack told the specials with eloquence, detail, and yet brevity. Most impressive. James obtained the cocktail order, but there was an issue. My accountant loves Blanton's, but they were sold out. Yet somehow James not only found some Blanton's somewhere in Aria, but managed to get my guest the coveted iron pony topper. He was very pleased, especially ahead of the Kentucky Derby. 

The food was served in perfect order, all delicious, yet for one flaw. My associate's New York sirloin was supposedly overcooked, though it looked textbook rare to me. Just then, the GM appeared, Joon Choi, and asked if our meal was to our liking. My guest confessed he thought the steak was overcooked, and in less than 45 seconds Joon appeared with another New York, cooked rare, as if he had one close by. Incredible. 

Other highlights: We didn't have to ask Reggie to decant our wine, he just did it. He suggested the Isosceles, and he was right. One of our guests has a few severe allergies, and Jack helped him navigate the menu through them all. Elizabeth was extremely attentive. We had been golfing all day were drinking water like mad. Elizabeth was on top of it, and must have refilled our water glasses at least a dozen times. We asked her why such a powerful steak house has such small capacity water glasses. She just smiled and said it was her pleasure to keep them filled. 

Lowlights: Aside from no Blanton's (unless being served by James), they took the applewood smoked bacon wrapped shrimp off the menu. Its replacement, the peppered shrimp, does not compare. The sea bass is awesome but that Maitke mushroom it's served with needs to go. The music is an odd mix, but way too much Frank Sinatra and Barry White.

I heard a lot of good things about the Jean George in New York and was hoping that this would be a similar experience. The ambiance was great, a typical steakhouse, a little more elegant than StripSteak in Vegas but nothing over the top.

we decided on the 6 course prefixe for 125.00 pp. so we can get a little-of-this-and-a-little-of-that. I never done a prefix at a steakhouse b/c i'm usually just dialed in which 'cut' i want more and maybe a side of lobster mac'n'cheese so this was a good deviation. 

* OSETRA CAVIAR - soooo good, i wanted another round of this..a bit of tart w/ salty goodness
* TUNA TARTARE - pretty standard tartare - does the job
* AUTUMN FRUITS - burrata cheese - not a fan
* SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS - really good, had a small hint of asian flavors like the viet fish sauce
* GRILLED WAGYU FILET MIGNON - amazing, i didnt expect that the tasting menu's steak would be so tender. had another touch of asian marinade flavors..loved this
* PEANUT BUTTER BROWNIE SUNDAE - wayyyyyyyyyy toooo sweet and i love dessert and peanut butter but i felt a small heart clog with this...

well done Jean George!!!

until next time space cowboy....",QTXeJ0TmEoeb2nRUemWpZA,13,12,4,GvcxNwF3ao6TQpYNO6Y0-Q

I came in for my birthday with some friends from out of town. We came in for a late dinner and was taken care of with meticulous hospitality. 

To start we ordered the oysters rockafeller and the crab cake. The portion sizes are not large. It is just a taste. Both were sensational. They were running a special on an Australian bone in 30 ounce ribeye which is raised similar to wagyu. We got one of those and their regular ribeye off the menu to compare. The marbling and tenderness of the Australian definitely stood out. It warranted the price as well. The sides were a letdown though. The mushrooms in goat cheese and bone marrow were not outstanding. The latter was underwhelming in the fact that it was so sparse. There was hardly anything to scoop up. The garlic spread that accompany it was the highlight. The pairing was intended to cut the rich fattiness of the bone marrow. Instead I used it for the ribeyes with the same intention.

Now this is where it got crazy. As the servers heard my friends wish me a happy birthday John G. prepared for a tour of the restaurant. After that we had to try some desserts. We got the churros with three different dipping sauces; strawberry, chocolate, and dulce de leche. It was good on its own or with the last sauce. The lava cake is JG's specialty. Apparently he came up with this signature dessert. It was the perfect portion. I could not see eating anything bigger. The strawberry rhubarb cobbler with pistachio ice cream is out of this world. The lattice work on top is gorgeous and every component meshed together well. Then there was the caramel sundae with the best caramel corn. The popcorn is served warm and it contrasts so well to the cold ice cream. I was on a sugar high and loving it.

What caused me to rate this restaurant two stars is the hostesses standing at the entrance. Before I am even seated, I am put in a sour mood by them. And I'm not saying it was once or that it is just one person. I have returned to this restaurant several times and every time, I am greeted by a rude glammed up woman who speaks as if she owns the restaurant. I have been refused a table for two different reservations before, being told that the restaurant is fully booked for the evening, then after speaking to someone of higher authority, given an empty table and witnessing a not even half full dining area. You may think, maybe the restaurant will fill up. Wrong. During the duration of an approximately 2 hour long meal, the restaurant is still barely filled 50%.

Ordered:

bone marrow - this was delicious...served on toast and some secret slaw salsa concoction...we finished two of these.
seared foie gras - this was good but a bit on the bitter side...thinking the reduction sauce was completed on time so it left a bit to be desired but the foie was perfect and the figs balanced it well.
calimari - was one of the best i've had...soft and the batter was seasoned to perfection...you almost didn't need a dip.  that good.
black truffle mash - only had a couple spoon fulls of this as I could feel the butter clogging my arteries just smelling it.  it was very good though and nice compliment to the steaks.
porterhouse - aged and cooked with TLC.  couldn't ask for more here.

NOW for the main event!  The server suggested this Wagyu / Angus cross bred cow called the Australian tomahawk chop (think bone-in rib eye with the dark fatty outer cap trimmed)...another yelper said theirs wasn't that good, however, ours was insanely flavorful and was awesome.

5531114,2018-05-13,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Let me start out with what we (my wife and I) did enjoy. The bread was amazing, warm and moist. We ordered the calamari to start with and that was just out of this world melt in your mouth. Definitely one of the better, if not the best, we have had so far. Lastly, the bone marrow exceeded expectations as well, the fact that it was a menu item already had scored points. But it was prepared quite nicely and paired nicely with the sauce that it came with spread on the small slices of toasted bread they provided. But from a food standpoint, this is where the good times ended for us.

Our entrees were a major disappointment from the high expectations that JGS was supposed to command. My wife had the sea bass and I had the Waygu tomahawk ribeye that wasn't on the menu as it was a special. Both of our entrees were on the very salty side which seems to have been pronounced by the way the meat was grilled. Having a great cut of beef or sea bass ruined by saltiness is such a disappointment and an unpleasant taste that's hard to get rid of.  Luckily the steaks come with some creative sauces that when applied enough can help counter the saltiness. But I also like to just enjoy a juicy and tender steak with just the natural taste of the fat on the meat. This wasn't the case here. Had to eat every bite with the sauce. While I finished my steak (I wasn't going to let a great cut of beef go to waste esp. for the price), my wife could only get through a little over half of her sea bass.

The lobster truffle Mac and the creamy spinach were quite ordinary. My wife felt the Mac and cheese was a bit salty, while I felt it just lacked any inspiring or memorable taste. But the entrees were still the bigger disappointment.

On the upside, service was great. We were always attended to and recommendations were proactively given. When I didn't like the taste of one of the cocktails, it was quickly replaced with another.

The photographer was pleasant as well. She even made conversation with us and asked if we were celebrating anything.
I only bring this up b/c my wife made dinner reservations for JGS over the phone about 3 weeks before we ate here. We had dinner here on the evening of 5/10 as my wife wanted to take me to a place to enjoy an amazing stake to celebrate my 40th birthday. She made sure to mention this when she made the reservation as this was how she wanted to kick off our stay on Vegas to celebrate my birthday weekend. Disappointedly, the restaurant didn't make a note and she was anxiously waiting throughout the dinner for it to be acknowledged, but unfortunately it wasn't. So this just added to her overall disappointing experience.

Net..net ... for us JGS will be a memorable experience for the wrong reasons, and we will share our experience honestly to those that ask, but I'm a firm believer that everyone should always try something once and make their own judgements from their own experience. But for us, will be hard to convince ourselves to come back here again.",2zO5cj9f3AGp1sr5BZF2xA,0,0,2,HwXYyZpGkA331SUKJvqT2g

Let's start with the good:
1. Calamari was cooked perfectly
2. The sauces for the steaks were delicious. My fave were the habenero better and bearnaise

Intolerable (please noted I have high expectations, when I'm paying $130+ per person)
1. Service was horrible. Our busser/runner (Boris) was much attentive tha. Our server. 
2. Our server removed my husband empty soda, without asking if he wanted another one. It took us 15 minutes, to track him down to find out what happened. When we did, his response was that he took it away becausw it was empty and they don't offer refills. (Let sit on that a minute. Why wouldn't you ask your guest if they'd like another one?! Did you assumed that they wouldn't be able to afford another $4.50 soda, even thought they are paying $130 per person. Or was it because they didn't order alcohol? We don't drink so why would we order alcohol?! 
3. Our steaks were over cooked. My husband ordered medium rare and for medium. I ordered medium well and got well done and burnt. Normally I'm fine with that but the steak was tough and not what I expected from a premium steak house
4. We all had more they half our meal left and the servicer did ask if we'd like to pack it to go. (Every restaurant ask this but they guy just didn't care)

Overall, I will never come here again. Gordon Ramsey is well above the bar, that it makes this place looks like a cheap road side cafe. Gordon Ramsey is always booked but worth the wait. They are attentive and your drink is never empty.

My husband and I took my mom to celebrate her 60th birthday. She seldom gets to go to nice restaurants so this was supposed to be a treat. It was some of the most terrible service we have ever received at a fine dining restaurant. Definitely not what we expect of a Jean Georges establishment.

My mom eats a bit slower than us. Our plates were frequently cleared before she was finished with her course during the tasting menu. This made everything feel very rushed. There was one course where she still had fork in hand and was chewing and they tried to clear her plate. I had to actually reach out and grab it and let them know she wasn't done. There was clearly still food remaining.

We frequently didn't have our next course of wine poured until the course had already been served. We also asked for some additional details regarding one of the courses and the server had no idea. He gave us some ingredients which were clearly what we had eaten in the last course.

Everyone was friendly, but they tried their best to rush us through. Honestly, the service was equivalent to what we would get at a big chain restaurant. It was incredibly disappointing.

My friend wanted to come here for her birthday dinner. I am always down for a good steakhouse and was a little turned off by the low rating, but decided to go along with it anyway.

We made reservations for 7pm Saturday night. We walked in and were seated right away. The decor is amazing. I loved the dark lighting, furniture and the whole vibe was just on point. They have the bar located right at the enterence so you can get a drink while waiting for a table. We were seated at a booth and it was cozy and felt very private. They have a wall lined with bottles  of wine running across the restaurant. It is an upscale place, so make sure to dress up.

Now the important part... the food. To start with, I wanted a good glass of wine. They have an extensive wine list. If you are fan of red, I recommend going with with their Malbec, bitter red and went very well with my steak. We started with the calamari and wagyu carpaccio appetizers. The carpaccio was to die for. Four pieces of fatty meat sitting on top of a creamy vinaigrette dressing. Totally mouthwatering and delicious. Probably the best part of our meal. The calamari was alright. Nothing to rave about, but then again suites us right getting seafood at a steakhouse. I would say skip the calamari and go with another appetizer. For my main entree I went with the 8 ounce Filet Mignon; to die for! It was cooked to medium perfection; was very tender. They brought several dipping sauces to the table. I would recommend their bearnaise sauce, however, the steak did taste better on its own. We got the truffle mac n cheese and mushrooms as our sides. Both were phenomenal. We ended the meal with the chocolate lava cake, with a side of the vanilla ice cream... loved it!

Our whole experience was great. Our waiter, Jason was so attentive, kind and very knowledgable about the menu. They answered all our questions and made sure we got everything the way we like it.",0cD3qzBX-jPynTHzg9oc3g,5,4,5,pJAgJuuW-PCaC8K65zn8KA

I thought that would be the perfect time to enjoy a nice steak dinner. While the rest of the town is focused on the fight, we will be enjoying our USDA Prime... We've been staying at City Center hotels steadily (once every 2-3 months) the last 3 years so this location is perfect for us.

We were seated immediately by the hostess upon arriving at a table in the main dining room. The restaurant didnt seem too busy at the time so it was curious why we were seated next to a table that was already occupied. The space was nice, modern, dimly lit and fit right in inside Aria IMO. Our waitress took our drink order then within a few minutes came back to take our food order. We started off with the gulf shrimp cocktail appetizer ($26) which came with cocktail sauce and lemon. They were big sized shrimp and tasted good & fresh. They were great with the lemon and cocktail sauce for dipping. We also ordered the tomato salad ($18) which came with hearts of palm and coconut. The tomato salad was plated beautifully and tasted pretty good. I just had a bite or 2... The complimentary bread loaf and whipped garlic butter provided at the table was very good. The loaf looked great and tasted even better. It was soft and buttery and the spread on it was perfectly matched.

For our entree, we ordered to share the 36oz prime porterhouse steak ($139) out of Greeley, CO. I like how they listed the source of each cut of steak. All the steaks at Jean Georges are cooked over apricott wood and finished with rendered beef fat, sea salt & cracked pepper. The porterhouse was delicious. It was cooked to a perfect medium. Just a nice pink at the center. I really enjoyed this steak and would order it again without hesitation. It was perfect for sharing between 2 people.

For our sides we went with the trumpet mushrooms ($18) and lobster mashed potatoes ($20). The mushrooms were great as they were cooked  in garlic, jalapeno and lemon. It was a great addition to our steak dinner. The lobster mash was good too. There were big lobster pieces in it and was a rich, creamy mash. 

Overall, a great dinner at Jean Georges. Nice, quiet atmosphere, good friendly service and delicious chophouse fare. I recommend it if you are around the City Center. We were staying at Vdara so it was perfect.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,6,3,4,Q2ElR1kBHV1u20i5BVpQ8Q

I understand that it is pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for and then some. I've been in the kitchen, and everything is crafted to perfection. 

We started off with the steak and tuna tar tare, and the roasted bone marrow. Wow. the bone marrow with the toast was simply delightful. Simply eating a piece of toast with a layer of fat is amazing. The steak tar tare was served with fries. It was savory, and refreshing to the palate. The same goes for the tuna tar tare. 

Main dish was NY strip steak, lamb chops, and lobster. Everything was either seared or broiled to perfection. It was literally the best NY strip steak that I've ever had. 

Topped of the night with the chocolate cake, and espresso. 

You will have a great time! 

Definitely go and check it out!",jnc4Zcn_F_9iZQFnL0QmkA,1,0,5,Z3zcIROEbSQRTiN4ZTuojA

          Located in the promenade of the Aria Hotel. I've followed chef Robert Moore since his day at Prime, Bellagio. My parents also celebrated their anniversary at Prime when Chef Moore was there. This anniversary, my parents wanted to come here after seeing countless of my yummy pictures.

          My broski family also joined us. We got lucky with a gorgeous booth in the back, separated from the rest of the adult crowd, so my nieces & I could be loud! (OK, so just me that was loud!)

          Another sommelier Jeff was there to help me with my wine pairing, after a quick talk, he was at many restos that I'd been too, how cool is that? Our server Timothy was also wonderful & the rest of the servers were so patiently with my lil nieces.

WINES: I'm the only one that drank!

- Domaine de la Cadette Bourgogne Vezelay la Chatelaine - A Chardonnay Dry White Table wine from Chablis, Burgundy, France - a younger wine, but fantastic.

- 2005 Maculan Torcolato - Italy, Veneto, Breganze - a perfect pairing for the Foie Gras Terrine!

- 2006 Shafer One Point Five Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, this is one good bottle!

- Oremus Tokaji Aszu, 5 Puttonyos was my dessert!

AMUSE BOUCHE:
- Lobster bisque with brandy cream, tarragon & herbs, crouton - heard that the chef cooked that bisque for a few hours. This was so creamy, tasty & even my 7 years old niece loved it!

SALAD:
- Baby iceberg lettuce bacon - my dad always goes for salad because he's a super healthy man, so those crispy bacons, were for my nieces & i ;-)

SIMPLY RAW:
- Kussi & Nantucket Oysters with cocktail sauce & Mignonette sauce - I had it here last month, and I had it again!  Just perfect pairing with the Domaine de la Cadette Bourgogne Vezelay la Chatelaine white Burgundy!

- Tuna tartare avocado soy-ginger dressing, cracker - this was just perfect.

APPETIZERS:
- Tempura calamari peashoots & chili dip - my parents & my broski family, all loved this one! 

- Peekytoe crab cake - mom's dish, & she didn't let me try it & it was gone!

- Crusted tuna citrus sriracha emulsion - love the sauce!

- Grilled Foie Gras Terrine Apple-Jalepano Marmalade, Grilled Country Bread - I had this dish every single time I'm here!!! Perfectly pairing with the Sauternes, or 2005 Maculan Torcolato - Italy, Veneto, Breganze!

- Bacon wrapped shrimp papaya mustard cilantro - what a lovely combination, you can't go wrong with this! My nieces 11 & 7 enjoyed this a lot or anything with bacon in it ;-)

ENTRÉES:
- Soy-glazed short rib apple-jalapeno puree rosemary crumbs - since my sister in law loved everything that cooked well, nothing better than this 8 hours cooked short rib!

- Australian lobster tail - special on the menu, my dad went for it.

- Kobe cheeseburger miso russian dressing yuzu pickles - my broksi dish - got to see see the cheese melted on the beef, so juicy. I got a bite of it oh my Kobe!

- Filet Mignon - Mom went for it & it was perfectly cooked to her liking. 
4 choices of steak sauces for you to choose!

- 300 days corn fed Australian steak - off the menu, you have to ask the chef for this special cut! Oh my Buddha, was that steak something!  I must have STEAKgasm! This is why MY FAVORITE PET IS STEAK!

SIDE DISHES:
- Caramelized brussel sprout - special menu, this was so good & perfect for Thanksgiving weekend dish!

- Roasted Royal Trumpet Mushrooms garlic & olive oil - delish as always, a MUST HAVE DISH here!

- French Fries for my nieces.

- Black truffles & comte fritter with French Brie cheese - these little balls got much texture, aromatic, crispy on the outside, cheezzzee inside, taste so heavenly to me. This dish is second the the Royal Trumpet Mushrooms dish!

DESSERTS:
- New York Cheesecake cherry compote sour cherry - the cheesecake was so delicious & I don't eat sweet!
- Salted caramel ice cream sundae - my broski & sister in law licked the plate good.
- Grand manier soufflé mandarin sorbet - My dad enjoyed it a lot!

            My nieces got the honor to meet chef Robert Moore & other chefs in the kitchen, they got to see the rarely to be seen kitchen. What a nice surprise for them!

            Another night with impeccable service, on the night of my parents anniversary & my lil niece 7th BDAY celebration!  Another great night with great wines, food, & family in Las Vegas.  Life is as good as it gets!

Thank you for knowing what guest service truly means.  Management is present and every time I have been there I have watched them make sure they are interacting with the guests.

The food!  I have now had the short ribs twice, and they were the same both times, fantastic.  My wife, fillet all three times.  Boring, you might say, but it was perfect all 3 times.  Which again I say consistency matters!  Pork spring roll, simple and tasty.  Spinach and bacon salad is balanced and doesn't overwhelm before the meal.

So rich that one of our party was literally sleeping tableside at meals end. (Although that may be due to his busy Vegas schedule more than the food and great service here.)

Bring a fat expense account and an appetite along, particularly if you order the brontosaurus-sized bone marrow or the incredibly rich foie gras appetizer. A massive porterhouse is great for sharing, and the ribeye is as good as it gets. Crispy potatoes stood out as a side dish, and crab dumplings are a great starter.

There are some other, extremely expensive Kobe steak and lobster options on menu, too. We stuck to the good stuff--prime meat.

Went on a Sunday night around 5pm. Didn't have a reservation but it was fairly empty so we were seated right away. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance - dim lighting to set the mood, quiet and elegant atmosphere. Perfect especially for a date night. 

Ordered:
A glass of Pinot
Tuna tartare 
Jumbo Shrimp cocktail
18oz bone in rib eye 
6oz wagyu filet mignon 
Lobster Mash potatoes
Black Truffle Mac&Cheese 

Must try : 
Medium rare bone in rib eye, wagyu filet, Black truffle Mac & Cheese and Lobster Mash potatoes 

They give you a variety of complimentary bread. For starters we had Tuna tartare and jumbo shrimp cocktail. The tuna tartare was pretty good and flavorful. It comes with a big piece of rice chip. Reminds me of the shrimp chips at the asian markets. Our medium rare steaks were cooked to perfection and seasoned well. They were also very juicy and tender. They give you 4 sauces to pair with your steak. Omg the wagyu filet was very tasty and tender !! Very well executed! Perfect with a glass of wine ! The steaks do not come with sides. The sides are enough to be shared among 2-3 people. For sides we ordered Lobster Mash potatoes and Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. The lobster mash potatoes kinda looks like baby food but don't let that stop you from this yummy dish. Very rich lobster flavor and a good amount of lobster bits. The Black truffle Mac & cheese was very tasty one of the best I've had!

Overall I had an amazing experience here. I liked the atmosphere. The food was soo good. The service was good as well. Our waiter explained everything in detail and was helpful with recommendations and always checked up on us. It's nice that the manager graciously came by to check up on our table. I'll definitely be back and I would like to try the crab cake, wagyu carpaccio, Tomahawk and these cocktails everyone raves about.",k8wtOxV33zMWlE5u6srceg,3,3,5,61JnS3GiiwZovyHmXRqJuA

We talked about sending it back in finally did in the restaurant was attentive and bring us two additional sticks complementary and a fillet and New York. The problem was those steaks were also overcooked dry and grainy. I appreciated the restaurant trying to work with us but when it came down to it the steaks were just not very good and not cooked very well.

The restaurant appeared to be a nice steakhouse.  Prices were more on the expensive side, we didn't mind as we wanted a great steak!

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food did NOT live up to the price and the quality was poor.  We started with a shrimp cocktail appetizer- the shrimp tasted old and fishy and the cocktail sauces were over salted.

We also ordered a salad, the $62 ribeye and asparagus. The salad was mediocre and the asparagus was under cooked.

The steak was horrible.  The cut of meat was poor, it was over cooked and was over seasoned. 

Lastly, why would a restaurant of this category feel the need to charge for a refill on a Soda?

5822918,2010-02-23,2,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"A Vegas trip is never quite complete unless it involves a visit to one of the city's premiere steakhouses.  This time around, we found our way to the newest kid on the block:  Jean Georges Steakhouse (conveniently located inside the Aria hotel where we happened to be staying at the time).

First, I must comment on the beautiful and stylish decor  inside the restaurant.  The design was immaculate and very chic ... right down to the ""island sinks"" inside the bathroom.  Service was on point including our friendly and very knowledgeable waitress.

As for the food, well, we started out with the grilled foie gras terrine (what a surprise right? I'm almost positive that I'm addicted to this stuff).  Grilled / terrine? Doesn't quite make sense right? Apparently, thanks to our waitress, the foie is at first grilled then prepared in terrine form - so don't expect it to be seared.  I still am not 100% convinced that I truly liked this preparation - I've certainly had better ... but it certainly was not bad by anyone's standard.  As for the main course, my girlfriend and I decided to split the 28oz bone in rib-eye.  As much as I wanted to like it ... I found the meat a bit uneven when it came to its flavor.  It was at times a bit too salty depending on which area of the steak I was eating ... perhaps this is not unusual ... but this is certainly the first time I've taken notice.  For the sides, we had the truffled mash potatoes and the grilled bone marrow.  The truffled mash was excellent ... one of the best, if not thee best,  preparation of this dish I've ever had.  You can certainly taste the truffle flavor all over this excellent dish.  As for the bone marrow, well, it is INSANE!!!  Never have I had a side dish that consisted of this much bone marrow grilled to perfection.  I actually physically felt my cholesterol jump a few hundred points as I delicately scooped the marrow into my mouth.  It accompanied the rib-eye perfectly along with the gremolata that it was served with. Be warned that this is a huge portion ... so please don't forget to prophylax yourself with your cholesterol lowering drug of choice (mine would be Lipitor). Fearing a massive coronary ... we opted not to have dessert.

Overall, I would give Jean Georges a 3.5 stars - the decor, ambience and service would definitely be a 4-4.5 stars.  As great as the side dishes were, I felt that the ribe-eye wasn't quite up to par (especially compared to the side dishes) and therefore I would have to rate it a 3. Harsh, I realize, but then again this is the land of Carnevino, Cut, SW steakhouse, Craftsteak, Delmonico, Smith & Wollensky among others.  With that much competition within a 10mile radius ... 3 stars is actually not that bad. As great as the setting, ambience and service were ...  in the end,  I felt that Jean Georges, dare I say it, failed to deliver.",MVuOcL85pX0IrFDuX1_LvQ,3,3,3,oVvgLbvyr2BnQSHy7mX_aA

Jean-Georges Steakhouse was a overall remarkable experience. Entertaining some business associates and being that its a new hotel and the restaurant received favorable reviews, Jean-Georges Steakhouse was the place to be and did not disappoint!

Service:
The Hostess was extremely friendly with a wonderful smile.
The bartender was friendly and made drinks to order.
Waiters was attentive and his service was second to none.

Meal:
Order the Cesar Salad and it was very good. For an entre' had to go with the New York Steak and my gosh it was... for lack of better word... indescribable. Meating and savory taste. Complimented the steak with french fries... original right?

Dessert:
Please get the warm chocolate cake with ice cream. It is brilliant!

Decor:
It's dark, It's bold, it's mysterious, it's beautiful.

A definite must and would recommend it, I would go back once my pockets recover a bit though. (lol).",fLoEHCnnwpcr8km58jpfIg,1,0,4,SsXKU2F6dcsoYunkEBSMrg

We do love a steak that can stand on its own--we don't care much for sauces. Jean Gorges' ""thing"" is the sauces. Your steak is served with five different sauces to choose from. 

If you like a steak with its own flavor, this is not your steakhouse.
If you like a steak with sauce, this is definitely your place to dine. 

Plain mashed potatoes were quite poor. They were the consistency of paste and only tasted okay. Asparagus was delish.

Finally, I have to say that of the four steaks we ordered, not one came cooked to our specifications. The medium-wells were far too rare. The medium-rares were far too over-cooked. Hmm...

Would we visit here again? Maybe with a side of ""probably not.""",vWPKgy-c5yVyg9TyfCBX3g,0,0,3,_9FSpkQ8feKHyLz05OqSyQ
5904152,2016-02-05,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"Very disappointing overall.  First off - it's a beautiful room.  The staff in reception was terrific.  Drinks were good - we had Their version of a Moscow Mule and a pomegranate fizz.  Bread also good - as were salads.  I was thinking this place was great.  But when my $87 Australian bone in strip steak arrived - it was extremely rare and was really lacking in flavor.  No one checked on us.  The sides were below average - truffle Mac and Cheese was tasteless and creamed spinach was flavorless and so non-creamy I suspected it was sautéed.  Finally had to ask a busboy to get our server (on a slow Thursday) to send back my steak.  Came back closer to medium (pink) - but steak was still less flavorful that any high end Vegas steakhouse (Smith and Wollensky, Mesa Grill, Cut, Craftsteak, Joe's, Old Homestead) I've tried.  Plus it took too long.  Desert was good, and the modest Cote de Rhone we had was decent.  Still at $420 with tip for 2 -I expect excellence.  This wasn't close.",VcXoDsl5Vwk_hOZr9_zPqQ,0,0,2,A3WXVy7c9W9FBxVw6XpgDQ

The steaks were good.  I got a 6 oz wagyu filet mignon cook medium. I suggest that you ask for medium rare and lightly salted and peppered. My side was with truffle mash potatoes.  Yummy!!! I highly recommend it. My husband got a 18 oz rib eye that was awesome. So ask for med/rare and light salt/pepper.",yxULGlPw5vf6XAhvkHPNrw,1,0,5,6jUEgyg6dl5KoGGn3KlZOg

5929851,2010-03-22,1,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"The food was fine, but my problem was with the service.  
Our waiter was hard to catch, and I ended up having to get help from the sommelier twice because he was the only one who checked on us.  
The sauce that came with my steak had cilantro in it, which I dislike.  I asked if they could make it without the cilantro, and the waiter was pretty rude and told me that they don't make the sauce fresh, so they can't make it without any ingredients.  I would think an expensive restaurant like this would make their sauces fresh and would accommodate patrons.
I agree with everyone else-- the music was too loud.  I couldn't carry on a conversation with my guests at all.  
If you're looking for a good steakhouse, try the one at Circus Circus.  If you want to spend a bunch of money on a mediocre dinner so you can brag to your friends, try Jean-Georges.",4U6ERqlxOzo7AGCLHfymtQ,3,3,2,NpYucPTfobPYJpycLfiNpw
5940942,2013-05-01,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"For the food, I'd give it 4 stars. It's great, you definitely won't be disappointed by the quality. 

Atmosphere is excellent, very modern, flashy, serious, romantic, it's a classy place.

For the service (for the hefty price tag you pay here), I'd give it 3 or 2.5 stars. They could be a bit more personable and welcoming. We're here in Vegas, dressed up fancy, at 4-5star hotel, to eat steak at 'Jean-Georges'...you've goT to step up the service. Diners coming to eat this restaurant aren't just looking for great cow meat. We want to be pampered, and I shouldn't have to reach out for my waiter throughout the night. Do smile to customers.  

My last tip for diners; if the waiter asks you if you want to try 'the special', make sure to check the price. My friend went with it without asking and ended up with a surprising $300+ bill for a plate of steak samplers. 

Overall, if they pump up the service, the restaurant would be a true 4+ star restaurant.",QnjuuDF4Em5XE3TuX91FzQ,0,0,3,ABIa7L6cz9dQQw3j96pzmA

I got it to go --but it was packed incorrectly, so the cardboard congealed to the burger, making it inedible the next day. (this pregnant lady cried!). my beautiful burger ended up stinking up my hotel room trash. Sigh. All that disappointment for $100.",8bHxoff717zmbO2Ss7EKTw,2,1,1,7kXdU_1_WFZMSfzQyM14OQ
5959928,2011-09-13,2,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"This is a review for the Restaurant Week menu. 

On the final day of Restaurant Week we decided to check out Jean Georges. I have been really interested in try it for a while. I came with my fella, two fellow Yelpers and another friend.

While waiting for our party my fella and I sampled some of their cocktails at the bar. I ordered the pineapple mojito and my fella ordered a very fruity looking strawberry champagne drink. I wasn't entirely impressed with these offerings and probably wouldn't try them again.

We all started with with the watermelon gazpacho. It had some interesting flavors, but I didn't feel it was a great palate starter. The ladies all chose the peach salad with goat cheese to begin and the men got the panzanella salad. I was lucky enough to be able to try them both and they were great. I preferred my peach salad, but they both had great flavors and textures. We all chose the NY Strip for our main course. Since it was a steakhouse we just couldn't resist. I don't typically order a NY Strip when at a steakhouse, but it was extremely tasty, well cooked and seasoned. The tomato compote went excellently with the steak. Flavorful and delicious. Everyone but my fella chose the key lime pie to end the meal, while my fella chose chocolate cake. The key lime pie was extremely tart and delicious. The addition of pop rocks to the top was incredibly interesting. Tasty at first, but got tiring as you continue eating it. The molten chocolate cake was pretty good, but absolutely typical and not extremely exciting. 

Overall, I was extremely happy with the conclusion to Restaurant Week 2011. My entire party was incredibly full and happy from our night out.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,4,xOWh9ZqH3hqkleEjFLMcoQ

I don't mind paying higher prices for good food, but it has to be justified. Here it was not!",MQb4_RgMz2nvEM_P8p1NrA,1,0,4,ZXNnv-_DZTAsDYh8tIjbGA
5996886,2010-02-04,0,qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ,"My friend and I were about an hour late, but we were accommodated. The whole staff was friendly. We started with two flutes of champagne and a seafood platter that had oysters, clams, lobster, shrimp, and the biggest crab leg I've honestly ever seen. The three sauces that accompanied the seafood platter were all divine. We were served different types of breads with butter, a soft mini pretzel roll, spicy, large fancy cracker, and a chewy raisin type. I just couldn't get enough of these! The different textures were a delight. Then came the expensive bottle of  Riesling which i practically finished myself before the Entree was even ordered. I asked for the label. But, I guess they forgot. I regret this. It was the best Reisling I've ever had. I ordered the smallest portion of filet mignon and a side order of roasted bone marrow. I never would've thought that bone marrow would be that tasty. a woman stopped by the table and took some photos. It was then that I realized, I took too long noshing on bread and guzzling  sumptuous wine. I looked at that picture perfect, untouched filet mignon. I was full when it came time to dive into the magical creation that was the reason for coming. It ended up in a doggie bag. Shameful I know. I never got to try it. The pictures were nice. The prices I'm sure were way out of my economic league. I bet the bill would've been a car payment. But, thanks to my well-to-do friend, who $$$$splurged on me, I got to experience this epicurean adventure.
Would I return. Doubtful. But, splendid experience.",nyrKpx9xOwEcCi_fLO3kVw,0,0,3,aEAoxZn2h21E_OFjqQcm8g
