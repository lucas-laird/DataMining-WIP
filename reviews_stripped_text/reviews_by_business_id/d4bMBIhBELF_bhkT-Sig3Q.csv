1568675,2015-02-12,8,d4bMBIhBELF_bhkT-Sig3Q,"I live up at the west end of Cheyenne, by 215; I worked all day, finally got done and coming down the 95 so I can stop at the Target up the street and I'm dying for a beer and burger. Mind you, I know I'm gonna be passing the whole crowd: Steiner's, Putters, Timbers - never seen a town with so many ""chain"" bar establishments and I'm kinda partial to small locals joints so I've never been to any of the aforementioned despite living here the past few years. 
Anyway: I decide to stop at Timbers, and this location ruined it for the entire bunch. 
They have some booths and tables, but I'm a single guy and I like making it easy on everybody and just sitting at the bar, so: I avoid all the empty video slot seats that have a thoughtfully placed plastic placard over the screen reminding me to not even bother sitting in the stool to buy food and drink from the bar (because that's just small change) if I'm not gonna pour money into the game, and steer for a non-gaming commoner seat. I pull the bar stool away from the bar and climb on - I'm excited: hungry, thirsty, let's DO this. Blonde chick bartender walks over right away, says ""can I get ya something to drink?"" and I reply with ""got a menu?"" - ""sure!"", and she turns to the bar, grabs one and puts it in front of me. She waits, expectantly, and man - I knew I wanted a burger but I open the menu anyway cuz maybe they got some good shiznit in here, amiright? So after it becomes obvious I'm browsing, she's out with ""take your time, can I get you a drink while you look at the menu?""
Well hell yes. I ain't here for the huntin'. I say ""yeah - whattya got on tap?""
""You sure about that?"" she says. 
-blank stare from me -
""I just made a pot of coffee, it's fresh and hot. You were kinda staggering when you came in here.""
What. The. #%$&. 
Did you just say what I think you said? You think I'm drunk? Obviously you don't know I just got off work. You don't know I'm recovering from what the doctor said was the worst ankle injury he'd ever seen in his career. And you clearly don't know how to spot intoxicated patrons, because that evaluation is based on multiple criteria. Was my speech slurring? No, because I'm not retarded or a stroke victim. Or drunk. Was my hand-eye coordination off? I seemed to grab the menu and thumb it okay, I could read, after I removed my glasses and DIDNT drop them. Did I walk funny? Yeah, I'm #%$&ing disabled, maybe you could go check my license plates or something. 
I explained that I just got off work, I had an injury causing a limp, thanked her for her concern, and repeated my beer request. I ordered my burger, which was overcooked and overpriced (medium doesn't mean cooked all the way through with not a trace of pink in any menu I've seen) and was mostly served by the laid-back dude bartender after that, probably because I was such a painful customer to deal with. Despite the MULTIPLE loud-mouthed, OBVIOUSLY-drunken pool players, I'm sure I was the biggest pain-in-the-butt to serve last night because coming in with a big pocketful of American money to buy a burger and a beer makes me a potential new customer and apparently that might threaten someone's comfortable little kingdom. Way to not know jack about customer service, boneheads. You probably think I'm an @$$hole for writing this, and believe me the feeling is reciprocated after paying you to serve me dinner. If it's any comfort, I've already learned my lesson and picked up some ground beef on the way home - damn good juicy bacon cheeseburger sitting on my plate as I write this, at least one Michelin star better than yours - we'll have to agree to go our own ways: I'll keep my money and you can keep your stanky smoke-stained prima-donna saloon.",JVYy-uy66NyQ5eBKzoTVXQ,3,2,1,9g1e9Qh3ZXLklstOOgumjg

First, they have surprisingly good food. The menu has a great selection, and if you want something in particular done, they do their best to accommodate your request.
The staff is most attentive with drinks and refills. The drink and meal specials are definitely a great reason to visit. There are particular servers who also make the trip worth while, one in particular is, Kieli. Her smile, and energy, are unmatched by any other. She is helpful with menu selections, and drink choices, and her positive attitude is infectious.
James, the new manager is also attentive with any customer issues.

Take the time when you're in the neighborhood and stop by.... I'm certain you'll return again, and again,  just as I will.

2061205,2015-12-13,0,d4bMBIhBELF_bhkT-Sig3Q,"Timbers is always a fun place to go. When we moved to the northwest side of town we wanted a great bar to go to that would become our second home. When we walked into Timbers the bartenders automatically greeted us. Seating wasnt too hard to find and we were able to get drinks right away. I had heard about their Best of Las Vegas rating for Best Bar Food, so I figured I'd try it out.   After a few visits I realized there isnt anything on the menu that isnt good! All of their burgers and sliders are AMAZING. Mozzarella wedges are great, chips and salsa is bomb, etc :) 

The drinks are amazing, and pricing is crazy good compared to the ridiculous prices for drinks on the strip. The first time I ordered an Adios at Timbers the bartender told me that was their most expensive drink in the house.  Comparing it to Vegas drinks in my mind I figured $10-11, boy was I wrong.... $7 for an Adios!!!! Cant beat that anywhere!

Regardless of any other reviews on here for Timbers, I absolutely love it. The night crew is great, Victor, Jeannine, Tommorah, and Josh are all awesome! 

P.S. keep an eye out in the mail for Timbers coupons :) they come in handy for food purchases.",L8mOL_41Ne7UhuG15Sf0rg,5,0,5,whjWMDyYBT_ehs3lNQ_MmA

Stopped in after the gym last night for Happy Hour & Donna the bartender suggested I go for the Turkey Sliders rather than my usual turkey burger, since I cut that in half anyway & the former was on Happy Hour Specials. 

I sit at the bar at one of the few non-gaming spots. Food came up piping hot with four sliders, a chipotle sauce & avocado YUM! Ordered a pretty big side salad @ 1.95$ in lieu of fries, brought that & 2 sliders to go. Like their house balsamic. 

Was about to leave & Donna tells me 2 guys want to buy me a drink.  Since I had just ordered their chili for my Dad (his go to, Mom loves the burger) I declined & she came back with ""then they want to pick up your tab!""

Went over to say thanks & hi and they were nice guys. Tried to close my tab & they literally told her ""no way, on us"". 

I stop in here at all hours and the only downside for me is the smoke, but that is par for the course. But, you can pop in all sweaty in gym gear and some nice folks just might buy you & your Dad dinner.

1.) The service is often not great, They might ask if everything is alright several times & the disappear when you want the check. Also as seniors we , I don't like when they call us ""guys"".

4175756,2016-05-29,1,d4bMBIhBELF_bhkT-Sig3Q,"This visit started at a 1. Service here is usually average at best. This time I came after work on a Saturday night about 10:50 PM. It wasn't busy at all. Me and my boyfriend sat in the restaurant section and there was one other table. After getting us our drinks, the server came back to our table to take our order about 10- 15 minutes later.  We both ordered sandwiches with modifications. His no onions, mine no cheese. After waiting about 15 minutes for our food, both our orders were wrong without the modifications honored. I can't eat cheese because I'm lactose intolerant so this was an issue. After waiting what felt like forever for her to come check on us, she said she would have them remake the food. She blamed it on the cook but said the manager would take care of the food for us. What bothered me other than our food being wrong was the fact that she came to our table not once, but TWICE with a mouth full of food. I understand being in the middle of a shift and needing to eat but don't come to a table you're serving with a mouth full of food. The only reason this is a 3 star review, and not a 1 is that we didn't have to pay for their mistake. The manager did his/her best to correct the mistake. 

Expect sub par service when you come here and you'll be fine. I'll probably be back at some point if only for the fact that there's not much else on this side of town when it comes to good food and good service.",KXCmtFEwKWuVh1Wm_f6kPg,3,1,3,T4y6YUYyhYaU25DrYditjw

She was tending bar as well as waiting tables. The service was excellent. My wife had wings for an app. and sliders. She said the wings had an after taste like dishwater, hence the four stars, but really liked the sliders. I had a burger which was quite good. 
After eating we gave the video poker a try. At first it seemed like they were tight but we wound up leaving with more money than we showed up with.
They have quite a few TV's so I would imagine this place gets crowded during games but I'm quite OK with that.

Same this time....I order a beer and wait for my food. After about 10 minutes food comes out. Girl drops it off, I pay, waiting for another beer but never offered one. Nobody came around for another 5+ minutes as I sit there staring around waiting for another beer. So I left.

We don't usually gamble at these places, but we like that kind of atmosphere and they generally have decent, sometimes wonderful, food.  We had high hopes for Timbers, but the reality didn't meet our expectations.

It's a rare bar these days that doesn't have cider on tap, but Timbers was that rarity, so I went with my old standard glass - in this case half-glass - of wine, while hubby had a draft.  No prices on a single item on the bar menu.

Herb had a side salad before his main course.  It looked great in the pic I took, and I was going to have some, but when I brought it closer to me I noticed a bunch of dark green slimy lettuce pieces floating through it.  I picked some out and gave it back to him.  He's not as particular or squeamish as I am.  His Fish and Chips were good, but his fries were drenched in so much salt that I couldn't even brush off any of it. I had just a couple, for which he was thankful.  Again, if it's food, he'll eat it.
Update:  After posting this review, I looked at my photos.  You CAN see some of the rotten lettuce!!

I ordered the Southwest Burger, medium.  It arrived dry, beyond well-done, and charred beyond recognition.  It would have taken dental records to identify it.  While I was waiting for its replacement, it occurred to me that the food had come out awfully quickly, and so I think that it's all pre-cooked and reheated when someone orders it.  When the new burger was delivered, I had high hopes.  It was glistening on top; maybe it was cooked right?  Nah, the inside was well-done again, just not as dead as its predecessor.  I had cole slaw instead of fries, and it wasn't worthy of its title:  no mayo, no vinegar, no seasoning, just shredded cabbage.  I had asked for the chipotle mayo for my burger on the side, and when I mixed some of that in, it was good.  Kitchen, take note.

I always leave my last sip of wine, or whatever I'm drinking, for the very end, right before we leave. That's my ""one for the road."" The final straw?  Apparently, while my husband was checking over the bill and I was looking at the TV, the waitress swooped in and took both glasses away.  Neither of us saw her do it, but they were gone, along with my last gulp.  Inexcusable, IMO.  We tipped her anyway, but gifted a couple at the next table with the remaining coupon.  We'll have no use for it.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,7,2,1,-k_NCuREHn91UkZsdMd8KQ

Maybe it's because I secretly miss my life there or because I just want to listen to myself talk (or read what  I type??). Anyway, I have many fond memories at this place. Many a times I went here, just a few blocks from where I used to live, and drink myself into a drunken stupor. Me and my best friend would play kiosk bar games, drink budlight like the end of the world was coming and oogle over the bartender in a Minnesota Vikings jersey, who was unfortunately married.

Great atmosphere. Good food. Can't remember if the drinks were reasonable in price, seeing as how it has been 4 years since I have been there and the economy was in a better position, but that all remains to be seen. Maybe when I go to Vegas in July I will pay homage to this place and update you all on that.
