Upon arrival not more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and got sat promptly. After 4 minutes of server (Tara) not even stopping by to greet us, I asked the first person who walked by (happen to be the manager) if we could get a server to offer us drinks. He took our drink order and she finally rolled up right before he delivered the drinks. We were ready to order so she took our order and for as slow as it was it took 26 minutes for our food to come out. She asked if we needed anything and we said no, but after a few bites into our meal we noticed my son didn't have all the condiments that came with his fajita dish so we waited a bit, then looked around and saw one server tending to her tables and our server nowhere to be found. I asked the other server in passing if she could get our server but instead she offered to get the missing condiments. As always server came by just a little to late. After finishing our meal I was looking around at an even slower restaurant with fewer tables and our server nowhere to be found again. Went up to the cashier, paid the bill and of course as we were leaving here came the server always a minute behind. Not sure if she was doing side work, eating, taking a break or just hiding but it's sad that every time I looked around the restaurant she was almost nowhere to be seen. I guess my problem is if you're that slow there's no excuse for poor service which is exactly what I felt I received. 
To be honest this location is 3 minutes from my house, but I'd rather drive further to the Tropicana location for better service and food.",3Pv_rjPLE7p6mALjtKKyDg,1,0,1,7DkfLgbFle-3QdDcYo3NmQ

433799,2017-01-12,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"My husband and I were given a Gift Certificate to the Black Bear Diner for Christmas.   It turned out to be more than ""just a gift,""  as we absolutely loved our visit, enjoyed the food immensely and had the pleasure of meeting most of the staff while there.   It was just TERRIFIC!   We plan on returning, as the menu items intrigued us to the point of saying, ""oh, I am going to order 'THIS' the next time.""

We both had the meatloaf dinner at lunch time.  It was a very generous portion and it was delicious!  Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, veggies, soup or salad, then potato salad or cole slaw, and a homemade corn muffin.   One menu item was better than the other!    While eating, our server recommended the pot roast, and we did order a pot roast dinner to take home for that night.   Looking forward to eating that later today!

Our server was remarkable.  His name was GARY, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND him.  He was professional, yet very friendly.   He anticipated our every need before we could ask, i.e.  more napkins, more water, more salad dressing, etc.   GARY is presently working there on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, beginning at 6 a.m.   His hard work and pleasant demeanor should be recognized by management, as he was a superior server and a really nice guy.  :))

The Diner itself is very  appealing.  It is extraordinarily CLEAN, neat and provides a very pleasant environment.   Watch out for the yummy looking desserts in the case by the cashier's desk.  OMG, I felt as though I gained 5 lbs just by looking at it.

We highly recommend this location for their superior food and service, in addition to the cleanliness of the Diner.

Looking forward to seeing the employees again.

461337,2016-09-29,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"Sorry this is so late, but about a month ago, my husband and I had dinner at BBD, Sahara location. We have always loved the one on Tropicana, so were excited to have this one open closer to home. Unfortunately, there is no comparison between the two. We were greeted well and seated right away. It took a few minutes for our server to take our drink orders, iced tea for both of us. It must have been freshly brewed because what little ice there was melted rapidly. We asked for more ice when we finally found our server who was apparently hiding somewhere and was certainly not focused on her job. We had to wait about 40 minutes for our food to arrive and my hubby's  fried chicken was so overcooked, he had to send it back. I ordered the smaller portion meatloaf dinner, and small it was. One slice about the size of a deck of cards, a scoop of potatoes and green beans was on the plate, however it arrived with no gravy on the meatloaf or potatoes. Again couldn't find the server, but she rushed over with a side dish of gravy about 5 minutes later. All in all, a very disappointing dinner.

We had all been to the Tropicana location, but we wanted to try the new one. When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted, led to our table, and given menus.

Very soon after, a server took our drink order and it arrived rather quickly. All correctly, too. Our principal server, a young woman named
Saerae, took our dinner orders (this was a Sunday evening), and she 
very efficiently fielded the many extra requests we old folks are known for. Lots of extra napkins, ""Tabasco, please"",  lemons, a glass of ice,
more lemons...more bread, butter, and did I mention more lemons?

Before our meals arrived, the manager came to our table and told us 
that the mixed vegetables we ordered would have to be substituted,
and would we be OK with salads? Happily, we were all more than OK
with that. Then the meals arrived. The soups were tasty and hot, the 
salads crispy and cold, and the entrees delicious. Both Saerae and
another server returned the table to fill glasses, bring bread, etc.

Three of us ordered turkey, and it was perfect...garlic mashed REALLY
good. One ordered tri-tip and was glad he did. One ordered an omelet
and said it was ""out of this world"", and the last two ordered chicken
and said they loved it.

So, there you have it. Really good food, GREAT service, nice, simple
surroundings.  This was a good night for this new location, and for us.

1059395,2016-10-02,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"Since the staff at the original Las Vegas Black Bear (Tropicana at Jones) informed us that they will be closing for renovation/remodel in the near future, the darling Orchid and I decided to check out the newest restaurant on West Sahara at Durango.

Orchid says it looks like it used to be a Marie Callendar's by the front-door layout (and I have to agree with her).  There is counter seating (unlike Tropicana/Jones).

We were greeted promptly, acknowledged cheerfully, and seated quickly.  Orchid's concerns about her walker and personal mobility were addressed graciously.  The server, a young gent named Bernard, was personable and generally a nice guy.  He accommodated our special requests (""please leave this off of this menu item"" ... ""please substittute this for that on this menu item"" ... even ""please make the ice cream sundae in a tall tulip glass instead of the normal bowl""); service we have come to expect from the Black Bear, but it's not always provided with a gracious smile and a ""no problem, folks.""

The food was standard good ""bear food;""  since it was Friday, Orchid had the all-you-can-eat fish and chips (and didn't eat that much), and I had the parmesan sourdough cheeseburger and the bacon cheeseburger salad (and took some home).  The salad - which is pretty much chef-salad full-entree sized, seemed to be a little smaller than I am used to, but that could be a personal perception thing.  Otherwise, the same good, predictable food ... and isn't that what you want when you go someplace you've been pleased with in the past?

I doubt we'll have any problems with this location while our ""original"" place gets a remodel, but I will (of course) miss our regular complement of first-name-basis staff at Tropicana/Jones.

We had some gift certificates to use so we decided to check out this new location because it's very close to home. Needless to say, it's essentially the same bear motif, deep woods cabin decor as the Tropicana location but the carpet isn't worn and stained and the walls aren't lined with dusty stuffed bears.

Staff is attentive, and the food and menu seem identical.  Typical diner food, but most of the time we get breakfast. Servings are large, and the kids' menu has a variety. It's not terribly different from the standard breakfast establishments around time. In fact, I wonder how this place will share customers with Biscuits Cafe just next door, although I think Black Bear has better pancakes.

1540662,2016-08-27,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"My wife and I were excited to be comped two meals as a part of their opening celebration. Even tho the meals were postponed by Black Bear (an air conditioning issue), we were happy to wait for a more opportune time. After all: we had eaten many times at the Tropicana location and were happy with the food and service. 

With ticket in hand, we headed there on Wed night, 08/24/16) and were seated right off. The place was lightly populated and we discounted this as it was still early evening.

We were seated and given a couple of glasses of tea where they must have just made a batch; there was ice in it, but it was melting fast. I asked for extra ice.  The waitress was friendly enough but I was convinced her mind was elsewhere. It took quite a while and I had to ask a second time before I got the ice. The food was another story.

The waitress took our order and we were not served until 25-30 minutes later. We chalked this up to my having ordered the fried chicken. My wife ended up with the lunch-portion of meatloaf: one paltry slice. I got three pieces of WAY overcooked chicken and had to send it back. It was black-burned in a few spots and had more tanning done than George Hamilton.  It had to have been dropped into a way-too-hot grease pan as the skin was literally burned off in several spots.  Interestingly, it took a VERY short time for a new dish to arrive with about half the overcooking as the first batch. (I suspect some poor soul who was about to be served was going to get his meal later than expected.) I held my temper and dug in. The chicken that I did eat was not bad but was a bit dry. Seasoning was good and the breading light and crisp.  The baked potato was just right.

The waitress came by and asked if I wanted a to-go box for the rest of my chicken. I politely passed. She asked another question then popped the same question again! (Did I want a to-go box?) All in the span of 40 seconds.  WHAT THE ....??!!??  Yes her mind was definitely not in the game.

We took our check to the counter along with the comp ticket and was asked by the nice cashier, ""Did you enjoy your meal?""  I told her we were bitterly disappointed. She offered to comp our meal until she realized it was free anyway. She offered some other opportunity to take home some dessert or other items, or I would I like to speak to the manager.  The gent standing 3 feet away appeared to BE that manager but he stood stone-cold-faced and didn't even twitch.

At this point, all we could do was decline. We called it a bust and left.  We'll give it one more chance--much later and after they have had a chance to get their schtick together,.  Time will tell and I will definitely post another entry when that happens. I rarely EVER give a restaurant a second chance and these folks don't really deserve one. But, I LOVE those blackberry cobblers.  We didn't want to tempt fate by taking one home that night. We'll see.",2Fhn9QvBYxt_NtMIiXXwdw,0,0,1,Z6NQUJotNTq3VN7MOoJoig

As for the service and the manners of the waiter that's another story. After looking through the menu the waiter asked us ""let's do this""  
We both asked for water with lemon, that he did bring us. Never once asking if there was anything else we need or even coming back to the table. Once he brought the food out didn't ask if we needed anything else i.e. More napkins,water, etc. but he did a quick walk by and  blurted out water? I responded yes please, I had used the habanero sauce mouth was a little hot. Just then he ran out the front door to heckle some girls walking by the restaurant and even joked with another co worker about getting there phone numbers. Lunch was $22 and change. As we went to pay the cashier are server was standing by her side. We tipped him with cash and wow not even a thank you or hope you enjoyed your lunch or see you again. Absolutely nothing!! Strange thing about Vegas it's built on service,service and more service and word of mouth. I blame management for poor training and lack of supervision. I already told are family how poor the service was. We have watched a half a dozen restaurants in that location come and go this will be no different.

2071898,2016-11-21,1,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"This restaurant recently opened in my neck of the woods so we came to check it out. It was me, my boyfriend and my grandma. We arrived around 11:30 and there was a 5-10 minute wait. In reality our wait ended up being closer to 20 minutes because they had no open tables. They kept seating parties of 2 but didn't have anything for a party of 3. It was no big deal, we were patient. But by the time we were seated I was starving and ready to eat. 

Our server was a friendly dude, I don't remember his name. He introduced himself, told us the special of the day, and brought us drinks right away. We browsed the menu for a bit and then put in our order. 45 minutes later, we still had no food. I started seeing people that came in after us get their food. Our server made notice of this and went to check on our order. The kitchen has a big open window so you can see what's going on and I saw him and other employees scrambling about. I think they probably forgot our order. Now I was mad. 8 months pregnant and hungry, does not a patient diner make. Right away a manager stopped by to explain that some tickets had gotten messed up. He apologized and said he would take care of us. 5 minutes later our food came out, delivered by our server who was extremely apologetic. 

I ordered the sausage patty breakfast which came with two pork patty's, 2 eggs, hashbrowns and a biscuit. I thought the food was good, but nothing stand out or amazing. Obviously I didn't order anything special so it was standard breakfast fare.The biscuit was freaking huge, it was the size of my head! And I didn't like it. It's way too much bread and it was very bland. You can sub the biscuit for toast which is what I would do next time. My grandma ordered the Joe hobo omelet which had sausage, bacon, ham, cheese and spinach, and she said it was very good. She even had leftovers which is unusual for her. My boyfriend had the Bigfoot chicken fried steak, which was a hearty meal but just okay as well. After we were done eating, the general manager stopped by our table and apologized again for the mess up and told us our meal was on the house, as it should have been. 

I appreciated the staff for rectifying a bad situation and that has possibly swayed my opinion on this place. Not that I am in any hurry to come back, but I think I will give them another chance.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,1,3,6EZgmWUxAi4vB6d0zfO48Q

So originally was really excited to try this place. Had seen a lot of the pictures of the breakfast food and read some reviews. We were enjoying football Sunday and New Year's Day so we weren't in the mood to cook and thought it would be the perfect time to try this place.

Ordered over the phone, got a fit and focused veggie delite omelette with no mushroom. 

Husband ordered corned beef hash breakfast 

He went to pick it up, they showed him both things and the girl even read everything back and everything sounded correct, she even mentioned the no mushrooms . Husband saw no mushrooms on the omelette as well. We timed it perfectly so that husband got back right after halftime and when I went to take first bite it was filled with mushroom, tried to take them out but it was just a mess after that. 

Called them to complain , they were super busy which is understandable . I remember the manager asking if they showed it to us. Like yes but we didn't have a fork to open up the food and check inside . 

He asked what register it was rung up on and how we paid and said there might be two charges shown due to the fact that he would be doing a charge back or something for the cost of the food without the veggie omelette .  However nothing showed up. We were never comped . And the day of we didn't have them remake it because my husband didn't want to leave again during the game to go get it ... and they were so busy I don't think they wanted to remake it anyways. 

My husband and I shared his and mine was thrown away and we were both left unsatisfied. 

A manager lying and saying he will pull a receipt and refund you and not doing so, leaves a bad taste , on top of getting a simple order wrong .",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,5,0,1,lMN6puiEzr3bTyy__lkqCw

I must say I was pleasantly surprised and would liken their food to an upscale Denny's. They are a chain and seem to be going for a friendly, down-to-earth, home-cooked American vibe. They serve everything on their menu (breakfast, lunch and dinner) all day long. That said, they were out of both chicken and the steak that comes with the Steak and Eggs when I was there. The chicken was fine because I didn't want any and they subbed my steak for a nicer more expensive steak so I was happy about that. The food and atmosphere are four stars, I am a fan!

The service is the reason for the extra star on this review. While the gentleman who got us our drinks really seemed to hate his life - which is always awkward- our server and the manager made up for it. My steak was overcooked, it was medium well or medium when I asked for medium rare. I told the waitress but also insisted that it was still a great steak and I would be happy to finish it - which I was! The steak was legit I just wanted them to know it was cooked wrong in case that is something they wanted to address in the kitchen later. Anyway the manager came over shortly after and apologized and gave us some Bear Bucks and a free dessert. I refused it at first because I hate taking anything from restaurants for free- I never want anyone to think I just wanted something for free especially when most of the time its the principle that matters. We did end up taking the Bear Bucks for our next visit but did not opt for the dessert because we were so stuffed. I was impressed at their response when I was seriously hardly making a fuss.

2364030,2017-06-04,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"Last night our family went to dinner here. My wife ordered the turkey dinner. After quite a long wait everyone in our party saw how pink the turkey was that was being served to her. The turkey had a very strange pink discoloration throughout. We brought it to the attention of our server who insisted that although other customers had returned the same meal for the same reason that day that the turkey was completely safe to eat. After we continued to express our concerns to our server who wanted to drag out the discussion rather then simply taking the dinner back, she went to her manager who apparently told her the same thing she said to us, how the meat was safe and that for some reason all day the turkey dinners were being cooked for the same times but the turkeys were coming out from either white or pink all day but no one had gotten sick. We insisted that they take the dinner back and my wife ordered the bbq ribs. By this time the rest of us were almost done eating our meals. After another long wait and thinking my wife's dinner would soon be out, our server came back and said they were sold out of ribs. So then my wife found another item on the menu but by this time the rest of us finished our dinner. Finally after another very long wait, my wife was finally served her third choice meal.
In addition, while my Mom was eating her dinner salad she pulled a large round, hard and black object out. We weren't sure what it was but it did look pretty gross.
At no time did the Manager ever come to our table to apologize or to offer how to make things right. We feel that we should've received a comp for my wife's meal or a percentage off or something to make things right but they didn't seem to care about the absolutely terrible service we received.
The rest of our meals were okay but certainly not the worth anywhere close to 122.00 dinner bill.

I came here for dinner with my husband and 2 kids. I had ordered the chicken fried steak. After waiting about 20 mins, the waitress brought out my children's dishes while my husband and I waited for ours. We got our plates about 5 mins later. I absolutely don't mind waiting some time for my food. Because I know it's being cooked fresh. Mine was a little too fresh tho. 

The chicken fried steak was so raw it was still mooing. I showed the waitress and she could see it was severely undercooked. I had pretty much lost my appetite by then for any steak and just opted for chicken fingers to go because by that time everyone else at the table was just about done eating. 

The manager on duty was very accommodating with comping my plate and offering some gift cards and a free pie. Which was pretty good by the way.. and if it wasn't for that and the nice employees, I'd probably rate this place one star. But after all, it is a restaurant and I'm basing my review on the food that was given to me lol.

One reason is the fish and chips is frozen fish patties and not very good ones at that and the second reason is because the staff do not know the difference between blueberries and raspberries. My husband and I went there tonight for dinner and decided to get the cobbler. We asked the person at the counter if it was blueberry and she asked someone else who said yes and it was really good. Brought it home and not blueberry and not that great. Could use some more fruit and ditch the tough crust and make it either a pie or a real cobbler.,fnIItxznQHlG1s_HoJzEQg,0,0,3,wi6IYtGgMnCBI9TwyxjWug

Ordered the Big Bear breakfast with biscuits and gravy, two eggs over light and bacon. Wife ordered egg whites, hash browns, and rye toast. Large OJ to split. No tomato juice remember. 

Breakfast is served! First words from my wife, "" my food is cold."" Asked for the waitress. By the time she took my wife's food back I was into the middle of one of the huge biscuits, and it was cold. Manager took mine back and brought another. Asked for OJ. Forgot it.

So... food is good as expected. Food is always on point at Black Bear. 

Our waiter, Brandon, was very good, attentive, etc. 

However... we had two instances where we interacted with a woman named Andrea (it was on her name tag)... and they were very negative. 

Her attitude was so negative I'm not sure we want to go back. She was behind the counter when we first walked in and sort of scowled at us instead of being welcoming. 

Later, there was a slight error on my mom's order (they put gravy on her turkey sandwich when she had asked her not to)... no big deal, but Andrea was the one who brought it out... when the error was brought up no, ""sorry""... just a nasty look and an ""oh, we'll fix that.""

(Brandon brought the new turkey and apologized profusely). 

So... we'll probably keep coming... but with so many good places to eat here in Vegas it's a tough sell until they get rid of nasty wet blankets like this Andrea lady.",Bk6zmpCCFlFGeVXKYmkH2A,1,0,3,vuHXTU4EVkIukCxQYb8TWQ

For my Mother's Day Brunch with the Fam, you didn't disappoint! 

The food was scrumptious!! Big portions for hungry appetites and wallet friendly for a family friendly find! 

At a glance! This was a restaurant for Highway Diner Heaven, where your server is a jolly drama misfit with a messy hair do... For-real Tho! Every girl had a messy bun or pony on their head I almost thought it was a prerequisite for hire!  


But on to the good stuff! The ORANGE JUICE!! If there was anything on the menu that I thought was a lil pricey it was the OJ- until my first sip!! Ha! Fresh Pressed Juice with my breakfast- Yes Please! Smells so good when they make a fresh batch too! 

Food: I had the Cinnamon Roll French Toast and Chicken Apple Sausage with scrambled eggs!! No complaints over here! It was delicious. 

Notable mention- the cream cheese drizzle has almond extract in it so fair warning for those looking to avoid. But! Topping it with syrup tastes divine too!! 


The Hubby's meal: The ScramBowl! Very tasty especially if you like to dowse everything breakfast related in Yummy Sawmill gravy! Beware of the large sliced Jalapenos tossed inside, so if you are not a fan of heat ask to opt out. 


Service: Fast and Friendly! We ordered the little a Mini Volcano first (2 pancakes, Eggs, 1 Sausage, 1 bacon) Yes, that's was a kids meal! It came out quickly, just time for the hungry one. 

Fun Find: Their menus are newspaper... how Nostalgic is that! Nothing says country breakfast at the kitchen table than everyone looking the newspaper to decide what to eat! :)


Overall, great food, nice service and happy with our visit! We'll be back!

I think the cook tried to do shortcuts and recycled those products. We've been here a few times before and never had problems with their food until now. I called the manager in the afternoon and mentioned our disappointment- and of course he apologized.,qoLscM-ujKBBhSaXS_GAOg,1,0,2,fgf-qeDRzi_9Ag88JX5VXA
3607162,2017-07-18,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"Lack of service is a serious issue at this location. I have been to the Tropicana one many times and have never received the kind of service I did today at this location. 

A male server asked what I would like to drink promptly when I sat down. That's when the good service ended. The drink didn't come until the same server walked around again and saw I didn't have my water. 

I asked for Tabasco sauce to a female server and she never brought it to my table. After some time,  I had to flag down another female server. 

My friend asked for a cup of coffee during her meal to a female server. She came by and set the coffee down not asking if she wanted creamer since only sugar is on the table. So another female server had to be flagged down to request cream. 

No server ever came around asking if everything was okay or if we needed anything or offering refills of our beverages until my water glass was completely empty at the end of my meal.  Then the male server brought me another water. 

During our entire breakfast we interacted with 3 different servers. None of them  offered additional service unless we requested something and all of them looked miserable and clearly offered no smiles to customers. 

It's unfortunate because the food was good. However, we won't be back to this location because just having good food is only half of the dining experience!",wi0dVER4HBLYEmYHoqu-Ew,2,0,1,mc25qCWrPt4aJjlA574tXQ
3617006,2017-01-14,5,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"Thank You for Ruining Breakfast-

Had to stop after my first bite to review this place and write my experience. Let me just note that I KNOW there are people who would say to ""suck it up""; I'm sure the owners or management roll their eyes when people complain about ""little things"" but $40 for ONE Breakfast and some chicken strips is not a small thing for a middle class person. It's a LUXURY and having it ruined is absolutely unfair and very poor business practice. 

I ordered a veggie omelette withOUT peppers not because I'm a picky eater, far from it, but because bell peppers are ONE produce I do not like in my eggs! My omelette was STUFFED with bell peppers. I'm pretty sure when the check out girl opened the container to confirm no bell peppers, she saw them because she twitched but still said ""... and no peppers"" Thanks, for being deceitful and wasting my $10. I certainly did not have a fork to cut into with and see all the peppers. I'm not going to eat this. I hate the lingering smell of peppers in my eggs and they give me heartburn. GODDAMNIT!! 

I ordered a side of home fries or country potatoes or whatever. Almost completely raw. Nothing else to be said here.  

I ordered chicken strips with fries for $9. The chicken strips were extremely small, surprising even. But that's not the worst part: they were OLD. Clearly fried a while earlier and sat under a heat lamp. The batter is rock hard and completely falls off the chicken, exposing dry, yellow meat. The bits are so hard, it's almost impossible to eat. Thank you for giving me old food for my money. 

Pancakes -- decent but clearly made with packaged or pre bought liquid batter because I can taste all the fake ingredients in it. 

BACON. Yeees, I order a side of bacon. First, the check out girl opens the container to show me and then bacon rolls out on the register counter. She gasps but clearly wished I didn't see that. I asked her to put it back in and request crispy bacon plus an extra order. This one was merely seared and it still looked... alive . I waited, literally for 18 minutes for a new batch. I asked TWICE wtf is going on and can I get this precooked bacon. Finally another girl hands me a container. I look. SAME FUCKING CONTAINER WITH SAME BACON and no additional order like I paid for. I send it back and tell her I'm standing there literally WAITING for that to be fixed and remind her of the extra order. About 6 minutes later she brings it. 

I will absolutely not ever order here again. Every single experience I wanted to have today was ruined and is INEDIBLE for me. 

You're welcome to contact me and let me know how you would like to issue me my refund. 

Never. Again.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,3,0,1,R8-eMgIi7Jimpfo8MDqSwQ

4158756,2017-05-17,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"Well, Let's see. My friend and I walked into an almost empty restaurant. Plenty of tables available. There was one party of four before us. We waited a while. My friend thought perhaps we were supposed to seat ourselves. Finally a waitress told us we would be seated after the party of four was seated. Okay. Then we asked for a booth. We were taken to the far corner of the room to a table that should have been designated a children's table. I could hardly get seated between the table and the booth. We asked for another table and even though there were empty booths available, it seemed like the waitress was having a hard time with seating us. Okay again.... Then we ordered. My friend ordered trout and it was delicious. I, on the other hand ordered turkey. We were told the veggie for the day was broccoli and I am not permitted to eat it so I asked for a replacement. The waiter said he would replace it with cole slaw. Fine. The meal came with the broccoli. I told the waitress who brought the meal about my discussion with the waiter. Next thing I know, the manager is at our table asking what the problem was. We explained. Then I looked at my plate. OMG! There were three slices of turkey on my plate. Each slice was about 2 to 2 1/2 inches thick, and it was very, very pink. The last piece was the end piece and it had white stuff on the end and it was hard. The cole slaw cup was filled so high that when I entered it with my fork, the cole slaw fell all around the table causing me embarrassment. After the dinner the manager did come to the table and offer to take my dinner off of the bill, but I refused. We've been to the other Black Bear Diner on Tropicana and the turkey dinner was prepared perfectly and it was delicious. I think perhaps these young folks in this diner need a bit more practice.

Food quality is above a Denny's, Coco's,Blueberry Hill, IHOP,  and most eateries in this category. The portions are very generous, and the quality of the ingredients is very good. 

However, as the saying goes, ""You Get What You Pay For"", and in this case, they are bit pricey.

Other than ""sides"", or just having something like Coffee, you can't order almost anything on the Menu, less than $10. That includes a basic breakfast, or a meal quality sandwich. 

The servers are good, and aim to please. 

Bottom line; skip Blueberry Hill and find one of these Diners. You might spend a dollar or two more on your meal, but the portions, quality, and service, are worth the extra money. Only real drawback, is they close at 10 PM, so that excludes them from late night and early morning meals.

4863376,2017-01-07,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"It wasn't the best experience and we love Black Bear, or maybe just the one by Tropicana and Jones. We went on Monday at 2 PM, so it was a little bit over the lunch craze. The restaurant is almost empty save for a few people having a late lunch. We were seated at the booth across from the bar counter. Normally, a server would be with us even before my butt hit the chair, or the person who met us in the front would ask what beverages do we prefer, but this time it didn't happen and she told us that our server will be with shortly. After a few minutes, there was another lady server that came to us. Didn't introduce herself and promptly asked if we are ready to order. We noticed that she didn't have any pad or pen with her so I was thinking, hey she might be pretty amazing since my SO is very specific on things that he wanted on his burger. As we were telling her what we wanted, she kept on patting down herself obviously looking for something, checking her pockets and in a drone-like manner kept saying 'uhuh' when we told her our order. Now this is a red flag. 

It took them 5 minutes total to give my SO his coffee, which normally they would serve us in an instant and then forgot my hot water with lemon but instead gave me a cold water with ice. While all of this is happening, another server came, he introduced himself as Bernard and said that he is our server. Now I'm confused. Why did the first server asked us for our order and not write it down and messed up the drinks, the first part of the meal, while there is actually a person who is assigned to that area? Couldn't she have said that she's only going to get our beverages while we wait for our actual server? So we needed to repeat our order for Bernard once again. After my side salad came our food came 15 full minutes late or more that that. I'm not usually an adamant ass that times everything but I am observant. Probably there are hundreds of reasons why the food was late, maybe they were still slaughtering the cow that was to be processed for the reuben that I ordered or for my SO's burger. Or when the place is packed and really busy or feeding two huge groups of some varsity team, but this was MONDAY at 2 pm. IT WAS EMPTY.

 What really got me disappointed were two things: First, the two ladies that sat at the counter while the whole mess with the lady server and Bernard coming to us, so yeah we've been seated for quite sometime, RECEIVED their food FIRST before we did. And as I remember, theirs were sandwiches as well. The second one was really the cherry on top. When Bernard, I believe remembered that we haven't eaten yet, or saw the anger and disappointment in our faces, he reminded the cooks of our order, and the cook answered in a clear voice that we actually heard it said: ""It already went out."" Now, both my SO and I looked at them and started to listen. Bernard, with the discomfort on him said to the cook, ""No, they haven't received it yet."" and just to make sure he looked over our table again and proceeded to tell the cooks what we wanted. While they're having that discussion, we are getting more angry, hungry and disappointed. And as for Bernard, he went on serving the food for the other people that sat down LATER than us. He didn't even acknowledged the mistake or even went to our table to apologize and tell us that our food will be out shortly. THERE WAS NOTHING. 

When we finally received our food, I was just thinking to myself, hey let's just eat, pay and get out. As I said, my SO is very specific on what he wanted, and this man used to work for diners and restaurants so he would know if your food is a few hours old and just heated up. He told the two servers twice, that there shouldn't be any tomato, sauces, or mayo. Lo and behold, a tomato was dangling in the sandwich. If he has allergies towards the tomato, this would be a great LAWSUIT. So lucky, lucky us. We stumbled upon the absent minded crew of this particular branch. 

So after we ate, though my SO didn't eat half of his sandwich, I was waiting for someone to at least bring the check. So again, I looked over to the bar counter, where a man was talking to the cooks and saying hi to to employee who was about to clock in. I was trying to get his attention, while my SO was posting a review in YELP about them, and finally! made eye contact. But got ignored. He walked over the counter and then disappeared. Ok, now we decided to just leave and pay up front without the bill. When we told the girl by the register what happened, who else would come to the rescue but the manager who made eye contact but didn't even acknowledged that we might need something. I believe Corey was his name. My SO explained to Corey our disappointing experience and he promptly said, that he will take care of the bill. I will be more inclined to say Thank You for that if he didn't roll his eyes as if we're giving an excuse not to pay. All in all, NEVER AGAIN on this branch.",i6uzMh0gRkOwxb2qqeU5ig,1,0,2,_cvp0k0vZL6W6_fWw4bv_w

4999337,2018-06-22,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"This review is long over due. 

On October 1st, I had one of the longest nights of my life. After attending the music festival Route 91; experiencing one of the biggest massacres in US history, held in lockdown overnight without eating or sleeping, my night hadn't ended. 

Around 10am, after walking to the airport to find an outlet where cars could pick me up from the strip, my friend wanted to make sure I ate, and we ended up at this Black Bear Location. 

I will never forget the kindness the manager and wait staff showed me this day. I could barely eat, tears streaming from my eyes, not being able to hold down a bite. The team was extremely gracious and sincere. They comped our meals, assisted me in cutting off my Route 91 bracelet and comforted me on one of the worst days of my life. 

I will be forever grateful for the kindness they showed. I'm so sorry this review took so long to compose. The owners should be proud. I'm happy to promote this establishment and what they do for the community. They truly showed what it was to be #vegasstrong.

Black Bear Diner is a great diner for this side of the country:)  
Unfortunately, it's not Open 24 hours- COME ON!  At least consider the newest location on LV Blvd not far from Blue Diamond to eventually be open 24 hours.  Think about it, once that stadium opens... ;)
The staff at all he Black Bear locations never, ever disappoint.  They are bubbly, you can feel the warmth of their personalities and are they speedy!  I mainly frequent the Sahara/Durango location now. That outdoor waiting are with the bears does have appeal!  However, Mindy the waitress is superb. Last time I finished dining, we hugged.  Seriously, go and be seated in Mindy's area and you will know why she's who she is- wonderful!  All the staff are here, but she's my favorite. Yes, as it it everyone has favorites. 
Food is always great quality ingredients, prepared quickly and arrive in front of you piping hot. I usually order the tuna melt.  Being the NYer I am, I do alter it.  Try it: tuna melt, rye toast, no lettuce, but make sure that cheese is Swiss. I en a provolone would do.  No, step it up and make the change away from cheddar/yellow American cheese please;)
Always order a dessert, nope no favorite. WELL, I do.  Not telling, Simply try them all at once or over various visits!

5416384,2016-07-30,2,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"We've been anticipating this opening for a while now. We love Black Bear and heard they where opening a new location just up the road from us. We looked on every corner and empty building, but not until they put the sign up did we know the spot.  It's a great corner, but a little worried about parking. It's a tight spot.

We walked in at dinner time, around 530pm and were met with a wall of smiling faces, all eagerly waiting on customers to show up. The place looked empty, about five tables seated. 

We were shown to a table right away, handed a menu and asked if we'd been to a Black Bear before, 'great, the hostes said, we'll take good care of you here'. Then walked away. 

Our  server shows up and repeats the same message. She's a little awkward and forgets what she is suppose to do, I quickly give her my drink order and my husband did the same. She ran off to get them, leaving us feeling like we where in a foeign land. 

Once she returns, we're ready to order, again a little awkward moment, she takes it and leaves. We figure it's beginners jitters.

My soup arrives, claim showder, it's hot, thick white, a few diced potatoes, and a few clams. It's creamy, has good flavor seasoned. They serve a hot corn bread roll, I quickly slather it with butter, it's melting quickly and I am eager for a bite, but it's a tad bland even with the butter. 

My dinner arrives, I got the big foot chicken fried steak. Wait, it looks different, a crust that is flat, fried to a reddish brown outter shell over a thin piece of beef.  Could this be a frozen patty? Small, not what I'm used to seeing from Black Bear. Did they change their vender? It's served with twice the mashed potaoes smothered in cream gravy and green beans. 

The mashed are made from scratched, they are thick, creamy and pretty good, but the green beans were a bit of a disappointment, despite bits of bacon, they lack seasoning, are bland and without flavor.

My husband orders the big foot breakfast with hash browns, scrambled eggs, a chicken fried steak and toast. It's a good plate, but he agrees, the steak is more a patty than a steak!

Good service, a bit green, but should get better with experience? My dinner a bit bland but decent, will come back for breakfast at least, we've always enjoyed a hearty Black Bear breakfast!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,4,1,3,f3eOmSNxseE36EmbU9mOLw

That began an onslaught of people (we literally had 3 different people wait on us). I, of course, ordered fried chicken. The meal has a lot of options, soup or salad, veggies or Italian style green beans, lots of carb options & a corn muffin. The waiter did not ask about any of my options past salad. I had to remind him about the other choices. I selected Italian green beans & mashed potatoes with brown gravy. Honey ordered a western burger with Parmesan chips. When I got my salad the lettuce was freshly washed, but not dried so there was a ton of water on the plate. Nothing special, just greens, shredded carrot, 2 slices of cucumber & 2 grape tomatoes. When our meals finally came my green beans, potatoes & gravy were cold, but the plate was ""hot"" according to our runner. We had to send back the food as it was completely inedible. The manager ""graciously"" took my meal off our bill (considering I didn't eat it, I guess that's gracious of him...I don't know).

5546944,2016-08-08,1,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"There is something quite off about this restaurant and I can't put my finger on it.   In this review I will cover the hottest day in this restaurants history, and that's a fact.  

The atmosphere was mostly a mix of beautifully designed theme furniture and cute wall and chair art that will zoom you away to the open Midwestern wilderness faster than a scoop of calgon and a click of the Ruby slippers.  But none of this could possibly have been enjoyed on the fateful day my partner and I decided to dine here because the air was thick, humid and above anything else and to my dismay in hoping to escape the torturous sweltering of the Las Vegas summer, the establishment's air had gone out.  My partner and I for some reason decided we could still ""make it werq"".  Little did we know, the food of this restaurant would leave a lot to be desired especially given the reputation painted by the employees when we made our initial queries of the dishes.

We decided to get our food to go even if our waitress was wonderful (Tara or something).  When we got home we expected warm food but it was worth it given the cool 74° we keep our apartment, which is literally down the street.  

The bacon cheeseburger was quite a lot to look at, but tasted of day old McDonald's and lard.  There were plenty of fries, but even they were tasteless and underseasoned. The serving size is large to extra large but the flavor is lacking to non existent.  Too bad, because until I ate here I thought nothing with bacon could taste flavorless.  What a sad day.

The new York steak was dry but still seasoned appropriately which saved it from the trash cans wide hungry mouth.  since all the food was to go, my poor steak was shoved into little Styrofoam boxes.  The presentation therefore was as it should be.  Acceptable when taking into consideration the size of the serving.  I asked for Brown beef gravy and somehow I got white gravy.  But the waitress did offer a choice of 3 gravies.  Idk whose fault that would be.  The cooks?  Management? Waitress?

I recommend the bear claw with almonds.  The waitress heated the pastry which made it softer.  The buttery and rich taste complemented my bitter decaffeinated coffee well and the size of the pastry is definitely something to write home about.  Truly an exciting way to start or end a meal:)

I think having no air was the worst mistake in the history of restaurants and I even had to Google if Donald Trump owned this chain which has a dozen locations sprinkled in the western US(he doesnt).  If they are going for comfort food I would add more flavor.  If they are going for home style cooking, I would add more flavor.  If they want to compete with Biscuits cafe, The Egg and I, Le Belle Terre, Blue Ox, and the various lunch options in the area, they need to step up their game.  Get the order right, keep it warm or hot, and make sure it's not a humid sweltering oven inside of your establishment.  These are the basics, and I think Bob and Laurie Manley might need to go back to them.  

In conclusion the atmosphere is spot on thanks to the wood workings of Ray Schulz and the ""sweeping, colorful, bear-mottled murals"" of Steve and Gary Fitzgerald.  Tara the server is quaint and friendly and seems to take her position as a lighthearted ambassador of comestibles and libation.  The food itself is lacking.  And the AIR CONDITIONER WAS NOT WORKING:(  I might come back in a few months.  Until then I will not recommend eating here.",8BOdwgSHMx8PTACfRILyXg,3,2,2,6ThhrUKWRN2kDwPJFqgsnw

We had a party of 13 and when we got here were quoted a 35 minute wait time.  We also stated that we were fine. After waiting, for 55 mins with no air conditioning we got up to leave and told the girls that worked up front that we were leaving as they had not sat up but sat 5 parties of 6 or more instead.

It took about 10 more minutes before we were seated. Once seated we had no menus and it took another 5 minutes to get them.  I have eaten at a ton of other Black Bear's not only in Las Vegas. I am beyond disappointed and I may never come back. As of now we have not gotten our food and we are going on 1.5 hours of waiting.

Ok so besides the first several minutes everything else was great. We got two pies to go the chocolate silk and the banana ! I treated my two clients and my newest employee to some grub here and everyone was super happy!  The staff is always super sweet but that corner in the very back by the kitchen   I don't like .... never again! 

Otherwise great as usually for some good ol american grub",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,0,0,5,fSvfFB_5UP_dWWTMGlojyA

Generous service. Upon greeting, we felt the friendly reception. Thank you Jeff, our table's server,  for the attention and accurate service this Tuesday morning. The kitchen staff needs a round of applause for the fast and immediate preparation of our pancakes, bear claw, fruit bowl and Fit and Focused Scramble. 

Generous portions. Bring a friend to share these huge plates or a basket to carry the to go boxes. The children could easily share a meal as well. 

Generous  hospitality.  There was a birthday celebration with a group sing along and sundae. Our drinks were filled and refilled quickly. We were checked on and attended to. Note: fresh OJ is not a complimentary refill.

Our family was provided cheerful service and kindness. Next time, I want us to sit at the traditional diner counter. I appreciate the Tomato Ketchup with no high fructose corn syrup! There is not a Family Bathroom but the large stall in the women's restroom has a baby changing table. The soap dispenser is difficult for children to reach. Watch out for hot water from the sink tap, the faucet is not automatic. The paper towel dispenser is a No Touch system.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,1,1,4,7VrNGmmfS3ZLb9u7JIquhQ

The waitresses are very in tune with their tables and interaction with their guests.  The food is good also the portions are enough to usually feed two people. I would recommend them they have a few locations around the area.

The service here is AWFUL. We ordered and nearly 45 minutes later food comes out over cooked, dried out and cold.
Place was not busy, there is no excuse for this. 
Our ""server"" Bernard needs to find a new line of work. The service industry is not for him. He was no where to be found, so my guess is he forgot to ring in our food then when he did ring it and it was ready he forgot again and it sat in the window to die. 
Being in this business I can be patient and understanding when there is reason, there was no reason for this. We sat and watched people come in after us, Order and eat then leave before we ever got our food. 
Needless to say we didn't even stay for a remake, I refuse to waste another hour watching pure incompetence and never getting a hot fresh meal.
So my advice is to avoid this place, unless you want to waste a whole day waiting for crappy food while dealing with bad service.",TmniT8S5d1rPL_6w7U7-Sg,1,0,1,9NdXap_kC4nG3zD_Jib1pA

Not really sure what's going on here.. is it closing, suffering from terrible management.. unsolved mystery.. went in over the weekend with my family. There was way to much staff on for the emptiness of the restraint which was probably for the best seeing as they were out of A LOT!! We to order our daughter a chocolate milk and were told they were out of chocolate syrup, heard the people behind ulus try to order a turkey & avocado sandwich and hey were told they were out of avocado. Husband and i ordered burgers none of the usual fixing were served with them (no lettuce, tomato, pickles,onion, mayo, etc. super weird!!) had to bed for napkins were oven only 2 for a family of 4, agin had to beg for silverware to have a waitress disappear for 5 minutes to 'hunt some down' and when she came back with it we were pretty positive she had to go did some from another table and wash them. Asked for a box to take our daughters leftovers and were told once again they were out of to go boxes (feel sorry for anyone wanting to do a phone order..) overall service was slow given the state of the dining room and the fact there was no one in there, server wasn't terrible not really sure which was ours because we never saw the same person twice other than for silverware. Also when i took our daughter to the restroom behind the counter was a disaster and a ton of empty shelves from what usually has stuff necessary to run a restaurant and do side work (boxes, cups, silverware prep, etc). I've eaten at this place in other towns and I've been a server.. this would have never flown in either case. Maybe I'll just stick to those ones and avoid this place because yeah.. it probably just needs to close.

My mother and sister were in town visiting and we went there on a whim after we were shopping at the next door Smith's and we were all three super hungry. Let me tell you we were not disappointed! The outdoor is so cute with little wooden bear totem poles and there's like a little mini gift shop in the foyer. It felt very comfy and homey as soon as you walked in. Our hostess who I unfortunately forgot her name was very nice and could tell it was our first time so she was patient and explained things to us. Our waitress, Esther, was such a sweetheart and informed us of the weekly fish fry Friday which included all you can eat fish!! They brewed a fresh pot of coffee for us which was REALLY good. Their portions are HUGE!!!! Seriously, my sister got the big portion steak and my mom and I got the ""little less"" version of country fried steak and pork roast and honestly all three were just gigantic. My sister's was the biggest of course but my mother and I still struggled to finish ours. Each dinner comes with a soup or salad, a delicious homemade cornbread muffin, mashed potatoes, and a veggie (green beans or mixed veggies, Both were good). Everything was just so delicious and Esther had the best customer service. It was an all around great experience. I will definitely come again and recommend it to anyone who wants a diner feel with amazing prices and huge portions!",sKJPDdCvmiCqkMnIqQEhGQ,0,0,5,OwUq3sHYwOL4YVaFs8dLxg

First of all,our waitress (name might be Melissa) was trying to go to another table until I said MISS!  She came back and took our order despite being in another dimension.

My wife's giant burger was not that giant and my pancakes did not have enough syrup.

Our whole experience was sad because we have had a lot of great experiences at the Black Bear on Tropicana.

5969921,2018-02-04,0,-PGsEXB6DFTVKa1eDOlzWA,"We came here today before super bowl for some breakfast before the game. The hostess greeted and sat us at a booth.  10 minutes pass and no one acknowledges us or takes our order.  The waitress for our table passes by and asks if anyone has come over to take our drink order, we explain that no one has yet. She asks what we would like to drink and comes back shortly with our beverages. While she sets them down my husband tells her we're ready to place our food order, and she explains she will be back shortly to take our order. This is now 15 minutes after we've sat. 20 minutes goes by and I look around to see if I can find out server. Another server is 3 feet away having a full on conversation with a table and at the same time watching me look around for someone. She looks at me and I say I just want to put our food order in. She says ""sorry I'm off already, I'm just trying to make sure they're ok.""  Oh I'm sorry, maybe you should say something like let me get your server or sure let me take your order and I'll give it to your server? Maybe that would be the appropriate response. She then walks over to the table behind us to pick up their dirty dishes and says something under her breath about me. I turned around and said ""Excuse me? Did you say something?"" And she responds ""NO I DIDNT MAM."" Firstly I thought you were off? So why are you clearing another tables plates and saying something about me under your breath at their table? So rude. Finally our server comes over and takes our order and we get our food 35 minutes after we sat. Meanwhile we ordered eggs, and I know eggs don't take much time. When the food arrived my husband thought his food was tasteless, my potatoes were bland, tasted like they had been frozen, perhaps even freezer burn. This has been the worst dining experience I have ever had.  Go to the other locations their service is better, the staff is friendlier, and the food is better.
