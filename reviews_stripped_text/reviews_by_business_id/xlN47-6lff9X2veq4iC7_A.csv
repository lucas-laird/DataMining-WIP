Susan the owner is extremely rude and did nothing to correct the problem. If you work at Howard Hughes buildings, you are much better off to run to Panara Bread to grab a sandwich.

It took literally 30 minutes from the time printed on my receipt to the time we walked out with our food. There were two of us and we only ordered sandwiches, this shouldn't be rocket science. 

On a side note, they don't have it posted anywhere, but they charge you a fee to use a credit card. Not a deal breaker, but irritating when they don't tell you before they charge your card and then proceed to get pissy with you when you ask what the additional charge was for.",SwZPyIK99gQPMCBXkMXsjw,6,2,1,RhBv-a1cpphwDe4txRSCLA

They are fantastic.  However, I'm done eating here because of the owner.  She is inexcusably rude and treats you like something stuck to the bottom of her shoe.  She will walk away in the middle of taking your order, and just holds out her hand for your payment without even telling you the order amount.  Today I pointedly looked at the cash register and said aloud the total that I saw, and she glared at me.   The fun part was just a moment later AFTER she ran my card, the total on the receipt and register display was about fifty cents more.  It's not about the money, it's about the fact that I've continued to patronize the place and am essentially PAYING this woman to treat customers like crap.

I ordered a salad and soda and paid about 15 dollars for that. That's insane!! I could see around 10 dollars. They give you a small cup of dressing and charge you extra for an additional dressing. The owner woman isn't very kind either, a delivery person once told me she takes all of their tips and rounds up on your orders. I.e. If your already over priced burger comes to say 10.75 she will just up it to 11.

The cheesesteak I ordered  was $7.95 based on the menu. After taxes, delivery fee, some weird additional .50 charge AND a $1 tip, it was over $11.00. That's an absurd price for JUST a sandwich that had nothing extra added to it.

You'd never know it was there unless someone told you , as it's buried in the Hughes office park. If you walk along the right side of Coroprate Drive from Paradise for a hundred feet or so, turn right into a loading dock area and go up the stairs to find it.

The selection of sandwiches and salads is quite large. I went there twice so far - had a mushroom swiss burger with fries the first time, a blackened salmon Caesar salad the second. Both were very tasty and reasonably priced. If they are busy you may wait a while for your food, as the kitchen is small. If you know what you want, call ahead. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Two televisions were on (showing the same program) while I was there.

The Sidewalk Cafe caters primarily to the surrounding office park, but it is in easy walking distance from hotels on Paradise such as the Fairfield Inn, Emerald Suites, etc There aren't a lot of moderately priced lunch and breakfast opportunities in the neighborhood, so the Sidewalk Cafe is a good bet. Just be aware that they are closed weekends and holidays, though they were open on Columbus Day when I went..",cb8OOZaz0BAYMVnBrAp0MA,1,0,4,J9k2diJU2Al5estwrvYYlw

Salads: pretty boring - mostly iceberg lettuce.  The Greek food, gyros and falafel: mediocre.  The falafel were dry, flat patties and the gyros did not come off a rotisserie like I am used to.  I think the meat was bought premade and heated up.   Looked like that precooked bacon and tasted blah. And my breakfast burrito smelled like beef stroganoff.  How does that happen?  It was ok, but lacked flavor, which was surprising given the amount of cheese, salsa, and sausage in there.

They have pasta, grilled fish, chicken fingers, hamburgers, and other various items.  But I'm not willing to go through the whole menu.

I work in the Huges Center so I guess we pay for the convenience.  What I don't like is that the delivery persons do not carry any coin change on them so if you're paying cash and don't have correct change, they round it off to the next dollar up, which just isn't right.  I spoke with the owner and she told me to use a credit card if I don't have exact change.  NOT THE POINT!  She says it's hard for the delivery persons to carry change......................guess she's never heard of fannie packs.

Tip 1: call or walk-in before 11am to order breakfast items such as an omelet, however they are strict about not allowing a substitution for fruit instead of hash browns. 
Tip 2: the baja grilled chicken wrap is excellent and a healthy choice if you omit the cheese and request a wheat wrap (warning this wrap contains just the right amount of  jalapenos..but be sure to have something to drink close by)
A few times I've called when the delivery order was wrong (eg received the buffalo grilled wrap instead of the baja - there's a big difference in taste!) and each time I called to tell them about the mistake, there was a  skeptical ""tone"" in her voice (the owner?) and clearly not a sincere apology - the impression she gave was that they were doing us a favor by fixing or replacing it... 
But they do a good enough job for something quick and close-by, and the delivery option is a blessing in this area.

4451631,2011-06-18,1,xlN47-6lff9X2veq4iC7_A,"I spent a week temping at an office in the Wells Fargo Tower and I ate here twice. It is a little cafe that is connected to the tower and it obviously caters to all the businesses in the Howard Hughes Center business park. All the people coming here are employees from around the area. Surprisingly enough it is not super busy at Noon (lunchtime) as both times I went is was exactly Noon. However, they do appear to be a thriving take-out business. I guess most people these days just can't get out of their office, even if the place they're ordering from is just a few floors down from them.

Anyway, it's a nice enough joint with seating inside and out. They have a HUGE menu considering how small the place is. There are cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, plates (mostly Greek-origin), wraps, soups, and salads. 

On the two days I went I had a hot sandwich, the Turkey Loco, which was okay, but I just did not realize it was not going to have any veggies on it all. Guess that's my own fault. Second day I had the gyro salad. Basically gyro meat on a bed of lettuce, but it also comes with a dressing and tzatziki sauce, cucumbers, tomatos, and red and green peppers - yum!

I suggest going with the salads here because you get the most bang for your buck. The salads are generous and since you're paying so much (everything here is $6+) you might as well get the most out of it! 

Not too many people are going to just come here because they want a bite to eat, but if you find yourself working in the Howard Hughes Center this place will definitely do.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,0,3,1B3kAnf0rUX9y8enSHBguw
