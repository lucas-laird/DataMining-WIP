26418,2016-03-02,0,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"I used to bring my family here as a treat. The burgers were to.die.for! Big fat yummy, tender, juicy, seasoned ground beef, just like dad used to bbq. Today, I got a tough, tasteless, cardboard replica of a Sams club or Costco bulk frozen patty. Since when does 100% ground beef have 90 degree hard edges? The bun was soaked in grease, and it was essentially a crunchy chewy greasy blob of gunk. The saving grace were the fries and beautifully blended Coke. (Note: your $7.99 burger only comes as a burger - no fries, salad or even a pickle. Your fries are gonna set you back another three bucks on any dog, sandwich or entree.) I'm so sad. When I was craving an old fashioned thick, juicy, tasty burger on a toasted warm bun, I'd run to Great Links.

59739,2011-07-02,1,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"I've been slipping on writing some Yelp reviews lately...I write so many papers for my major that often I don't feel like writing a creative accolade for the places that I do enjoy. But for Great Links, I'll make the exception.

When I was 17, I was having the time of my life running around Philly and Brooklyn.  I was on an extended vacation (months) visiting my relatives and was bouncing between the two cities. It was my first east coast experience, and it was incredible. What I remember the most was not the sights and the sounds, but it was the food. OMG the food...how I miss it.

Great Links is able to bring me a little slice of what I remember and loved most about Brooklyn and Philly. Another reviewer said it best: The moment you step inside the doors, you don't feel like you're in Vegas anymore. Suddenly you're in a casual, intimate little retro diner where you can place your order at the front, or grab a barstool at the counter and watch the cooks prepare your food. Heck, you're so close you could even chat with them - but I try not to, because they're busy cooking 20 things at once. For the east coast, these types of joints litter every street corner. For Vegas, it's not so common. It makes it all the more special.

Everyone there is really nice. The cooks/grillmasters are awesome and very talented - I can't seem to cook more than one thing at a time without burning it all on MY stove, so how they manage to do it so well is beyond me. They chat to the customers when they can, and make sure that you're doing ok. The servers are also friendly and attentive. I've even met the owner, and he's a very personable guy. And he works hard too, because I've watched him bus tables when it gets really busy. I've never seen a owner do dirty work at any other restaurant, so he has my respect.

The menu is extensive and delicious.The portions are huge and extremely affordable. They have more than hot dogs for those not in the mood, as well as salads for those of you that are a little more health-conscious (I am not one of those people). They have a breakfast menu that I'd like to try someday - if I can ever convince myself to wake up before noon on my days off.

In addition to the food, they have the usual soft drinks, milk shakes, malt beverages, bottled beer, and even some beer on tap. Never have tried a milkshake, because I usually get filled up on my entree, but they look good, and I am tempted.

During lunch rush hour, expect to wait a little bit longer for your food. This is not a slam against the restaurant - everything is prepared fresh, and it gets seriously busy. I don't mind waiting the extra few minutes for good food. I believe you can call ahead and place a to-go order - so if you're short on time and not dining in, this might be a better way to go.

I can't say enough good things. I am a happy customer, and I'm pretty picky about where I spend my money. I appreciate a place that serves good food and brings back happy memories of a long-time-ago.",owlCjxNkDW02M3ABygGgag,4,2,5,BCXhq2vUNL5eGGUUQ28SuQ

161543,2012-11-13,5,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"I'm going to abandon my typically structured article and opening 'cliffhanger' paragraph and just skip right to it on this one: this sucked. Great Links' website claims right on the main page that they were voted the best burger in Las Vegas (!!!!). Who were they up against? This is insane! I know everyone has their own opinions, including me, but out of the 70+ burger places I've eaten at in town I'd say 95% of them are better than this. Who the hell voted? What other places was this up against? Come on!

The restaurant interior is typical strip mall fare, with the griddle and deep fryers right in the open. The menu features hot dogs, sausages, burgers, sandwiches, fish...you name it. The key words to this menu are: frozen, premade, generic, and Boar's Head. Think generic pre-packed sausages and dogs, frozen patties, frozen fries... Sitting at the counter by the griddle I witnessed them pulling their sausages out of Boar's Head packages, frozen patties thrown right on the griddle, generic frozen crinkle cut fries dumped right out of their plain grocery store bags into a measuring bowl and into the fryer. While sitting near the griddle the only 'fresh' items I noticed were the pre-cut veggies they were pulling out of the fridge to throw on the griddle.

My frozen burger patty was dropped right on the grill to be overcooked with everything else on there. The meat was very generic, not that flavorful, and definitely not the winner of any 'best of' contest I can think of. There was a huge piece of tough, thick lettuce on the burger, a small amount of mushrooms I could barely taste, well-melted swiss cheese and a couple of thin tomato slices. The bun was grilled well, but extremely plain and non-existent. Nothing about this burger stood out, other than the fact I could find it in any backyard bbq or at an overpriced crappy food stand at any sports event.

The thin, overcooked generic fries were exactly that. I can't stress how ridiculously typical this meal was; I would give it a fairly negative review just on all that, but combine it with the 'best burger' claim and it infuriates me. To top it off my meal came to $13.26, which is equal to or more than plenty of other fantastic burgers I've eaten all around town that are definitely worthy of some best burger claims in many categories. I can't recommend paying to eat anything here because you could purchase pretty much the same ingredients at any grocery store and do what they do in your backyard.

263679,2014-01-14,0,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"Wanted to try this place after seeing all of the favorable reviews here on Yelp. I was thinking a Chicago dog would be pretty awesome so I took my daughter in for lunch to give it a shot. I ordered her a kid's meal with hot dog, crinkle cut fries, and the draft root beer. (the tap handle says Death Valley Root Beer which is a phenomenal concoction but the server told me it's actually Chicago Brewing Company Root Beer they are serving, head's up on that if it matters to you) I ordered the Chi dog ala carte because I always pick at my kids' food anyway. (yah, I roll like that!)   : ) 

Her hot dog did not have the snap that mine did, obviously a different hot dog for the kid's versus the adult's, no big deal. I'm assuming it was the kosher dog which is on the menu and is denoted as having ""no snap."" That was my best Sherlock Holmes deduction.......anyway........

The crinkle cut fries were crisp, served hot, and not salted at all. Which is fine, everyone has different sodium needs so I don't think fries should come out doused in salt, it takes 2 seconds to salt to taste. 

The Chicago dog was stupendous! The poppy seed roll, those little peppers, that bright green relish, a giant slab of dill pickle across the top, it was great! Her kid's hot dog, meh, it wasn't anything to write home about but edible nonetheless.

The root beer is delicious and they serve it with no ice so they know how to serve draft root beer. It is creamy, has just enough bite, and isn't overly sweet. 

And just a note to one of the previous reviewer who was mentioning they ""saw the chef using Boar's Head meats."" WOW, you really are a Sherlock aren't you, considering they have ""Boar's Head Served Here"" signs at the entrance and all over the inside of the restaurant, great powers of deduction there, really that is quite impressive! LOL

I would give this place 5 stars if you could just walk up to the counter, order your hot dog, and sit down and eat it, but you must be served instead. I'll say this, the server was very polite, attentive, and personable, so that isn't the issue at all. It's just that to me, a hot dog joint should be on the cheaper and quicker side of eating and when you are being served, those attributes aren't really going to be that attainable unfortunately. I know you can make a take out order but sometimes I'd rather not eat in the car especially something as messy as a Chicago Dog. 

Try it, you will like it too!   : )",cLa2sB8YPB7rgeHLqw4YXg,0,0,4,GNSvRy2e7KTio5hIckAwuQ

When we where ready she took our order, Chicago dog, Louisiana link, cheese fries and house salad. $20 for it all. Seemed pricey for me. We where asked if we wanted to eat here. We really would have loved to. But it was overwhelmingly hot in there. It felt like a sauna. I know today was probably the hottest days in Vegas, (114 on 6/7/13) but when you want to be inside on a summer day, outside shouldn't be hotter. We took our food home. The Chicago dog tasted good, it was soggy, like all the juice from the toppings where Just added to it. The hot dog tasted good, them seem to have a good product, only problem was, the restaurant was hotter than my dog. The Louisiana link was good. Spicy! No complains there. The cheese fries, I would suggest not getting. They where soggy. It almost seemed like cheap frozen fries from the grocery store, microwaved and drowned with cheese. We where only able to eat half because the other half wasn't even removable from the paper wrap in the container. Salad, I couldn't tell you because the didn't include our dressing.

The brand new employee, thrown on the phone orders at dinner time, had the worst phone skills of any adult I'd ever met. It took him 10 mins to write out the following order:
1 onion ring
1 crinkle fry
1 veg ck patty with buffalo sauce, minus dairy.
1 veg patty with mushrooms, no dairy. I requested extra raw onions.
10 minutes of telling me uh hold on, while he wrote. 
P/u time 20 to 25 mins. We arrived in 15. Our food was already bagged and waiting. We took it home, the 10 mins it took to get inside and put our food on plates, the fried food had saturated the paper bags and the bottoms fell out. The burgers sucked. 
I never take pics of food for reviews, but was so pissed off to have spent 24$ on this quality of food, with 2$  as a tip. No onions at all on my burger, and at best 5 slices of mushrooms.

The previous time we ate in, roughly a month ago, they were extremely short handed and the cooks were made to serve tables. The same order above did take them 25 minutes, which is crazy long. As chefs by trade we know about being short handed in the kitchen.  This happens, but it seems like Great Links is trying to cut cost, and in turn they're going to lose business.

After all the times we have eaten here, we still haven't even scratched the surface of their menu! Everything I have tried has been absolutely amazing! So far my favorites are the NASCAR specials (I really wish they would still serve last year's special though) and their Italian fries. The prices are extremely resonable, we usually order 2 dogs (or burgers/sandwiches), 2 orders of fries, 2 soft drinks and a kids meal (includes drink and cookies for dessert) and I don't think we have ever paid more than $25.

 The quality of their food is top-notch and the food is always served piping hot and fast. The thing that really makes this place worth visiting is the service. I always see the owner there which is a true sign of pride in ownership and Michelle is one of the hardest working people I have ever met. The place is always packed with people and yet the staff manages to keep everyone happy and they do it with a smile on their face even though you know thay have got to be exhausted! 

They also keep the place very clean both in the dinning area, grill area and the restrooms. One of my biggest pet peeves is a dirty bathroom... I have been know to actually walk out of a place because of the condition of the bathroom (I'm kind of a germ-a-phobe when it comes to public toilets), I can honestly say that Great Links has one of the cleanest bathrooms I have ever seen in a restaurant.

I've heard through the grape vine that the owners are having some financial trouble recently and despite the success of Great Links may be forced to close their doors.

My husband had the hot dogs, and he said they didn't have much flavor.  He said the hot dog should have a better flavor, and anything additional should just make it taste that much better.  Our waiter never came by  to check if everything was ok, it was when we were paying for our check did another waiter asked how our experience was.",xrQQ8l7e1PGosO9E7fDe_A,0,0,2,6WALgs0Ma_B4MqAywsrq3w
432821,2014-10-31,0,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,Great find in an unsuspecting location! The menu here is kind of busy so you might have to ask someone to explain all the details to you. But after Charlie broke it down for us we decided we would need to come back at least 4 times to try everything. Great in house made root beer and great deals for beers. Great plus is their ***vegan/Vegetarian*** options with tons of add on options. Family of 7 ate for just over $70 with beers sodas and other drinks and don't forget your 10% discount if you are in the military. Only thing stopping a 5 star rating is the busy menu...

464071,2013-10-10,1,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"I would l like to say I have a good review, but unfortunately not. I really think that service is the key to great reviews and even if the food or product isn't good most would at least consider a second chance in order for one's to redeem themselves just because of great service. But in my case that service never really came.
I went to the place after work one night. After seeing it the day prior while on that side of town, I was excited to see something outside the typical here and there fast food. Plus it never hurts to see so many good reviews on yelp.  I drove out of my way that night and made it to the restaurant about 8:15. I admit I was apprehensive being out late and not familiar with the place and its operating hrs but after seeing a small group of what appeared to be customers because the waitress was serving them drinks and clearly reading the sign outside for a minute or so I proceeded in. I was happy to see a employee come hastily over to what I thought was  greet me but instead of that he rudely said that they closed at 8 and that I needed to go. I was shocked and embarrassed. He walked away never said sorry or please come again just walked away. I then left but not after reading the sign again which clearly stated 9 p.m. I also considered that the doors were still open. I sat in the parking lot and watched for a few minutes and also noted that no-one came to lock the doors which is standard procedure for most places when closing and not wanting any other patrons to make same mistakes but nothing happened. 
I watched as the waitress continued to serve the group inside. 5 minutes passed and another tray of food came out to the group. I drove away quite upset vowing never to even attempt to come again. I suggest to anyone interested not to come after 8 or you just might be wasting your time because they clearly don't want to serve anyone according to the sign in the window. And maybe if the owners read this you will change the sign so no-one else does the same thing and you don't lose more of what could be potential customers.",GjyUWgv1HetWGFjqj6HiTA,4,1,1,FBG9ZjkGU_wEo6j3HRiXWA

They have had amazing burgers, chicken tenders, and they some how improved the mozzarella sticks by offering them as half moons.  Not the cheapest place in the world (My combo meal runs me around $11) I've introduced a few people to this place as well and they all enjoy it. The place is either empty or teeming. They have great carry-out which I recommend to everyone who may not like busy places.

Buffalo cheesy fries - slightly tangy sauce with melted cheese. They weren't salty or spicy but were good.
Guacamole jalapeño burger - I devoured this. The guacamole was creamy. There were just enough jalapeños to give it a little kick without overpowering it. Yummy deliciousness. 
Pastrami burger - I took a bite. I just had to. It looked too good. The mustard had just the right kick. The pastrami complimented the burger in such the right way. 
Kraut dog - oh snap... Literally! It was so good. Just enough spicy mustard and kraut. The kraut was crisp and wasn't too sour.

It was around 2:30ish so we must have just missed the lunch crowd. As we were looking over the menu, I know I was constantly changing my mind of what I wanted. Then I saw the bratwurst and my mind was made up. Same for my husband. In fact, we decided to order two of the #3 (brat, drink, and fries). I ordered my brat with K-up, mustard, cheese, and onions (Yum!); the fries the crinklely ones and my husband ordered his with the spicy mustard only; the fries traditional.

We were not disappointed with our food at all. In fact, we both wanted another despite already been stuffed. A couple for the road maybe? As others have mentioned in their reviews, these dogs do have a ""snap"" to them when you take that first bite. It's the way a dog or a brat should be. All dogs and fries are made fresh when ordered, which you can tell. The refills on your drinks are free and automatically served in those take-out cups so you can fill up before heading out the door. 

Even though we both got the brats, we will definitely go back (Lowes stop or not) and try their other dogs. The space is kind of small but I think it addes to the atmosphere and there's counter sitting as well. This restaurant also had a warm, friendly feeling to it.

However, I ordered the southern hot dog and my wife got the Chicago dog. I also got home-style fries and she got the mozzarella sticks.  
The hot dogs were alright and tasted pretty good, nothing amazing and I found them comparable to Sonic's hot dogs. 
The mozzarella sticks probably came straight from the freezer from Costco or the like and were nothing original. 
The home-style french fries were disgusting. I think they let the potatoes set out too-long, because the fries tasted bad, were very soggy, and lacked any taste other than oil. I do not know how it is possible to have a burned soggy fry. 
The service was horrible. The owner was there when we went and it was not busy at all, but we had to wait 15 minutes to order even though our waitress was sitting directly in-front of us watching Sponge-bob Square-pants. We were clearly ready to order for at least five minutes before because we decided to fold our menus up to make it even more obvious that we were ready to go. When we left, we went through a similar situation, not sure if we should just walk up to the cash register at the front or wait for somebody to come to our table.

My husband and I live very close to Great Links and often stop in for a quick dinner when we are busy.  The little eatery is located in the Lowes parking lot so we often eat here midway through some home improvement project.
The wait staff is so friendly and helpful, offering suggestions when asked. The food is delicious.  We love their cottage fries and I always ask for them extra crisp. My husband prefers his a little underdone and the cook always obliges both of us.  We mostly go for the dogs, which are loaded with different toppings per your selection.  My husband loves the  Las Vegas Chili Dog which is loaded with chili.  I am a Chicago dog fan and almost always go for the Chicago style dog.  Last night I opted for an Oretga chili bacon burger and was not disappointed. the burger had a lot of bacon on it.  Typically when I am out and order a bacon burger it comes a slice or maybe two of thin cut bacon.  Great Links' burger had a bacon weave if you will covering the top of my burger.  
My daughter ordered chicken fingers and they were perfectly fried- crispy outside, juicy inside.
The staff is so friendly and they are proud of what they have to offer.  We enjoy the home town feeling of the place

Those were good, I wish they put a little bit more of the garlic butter, and a little less parmesan cheese.

Easily located using the technological divining rod that is the yelp app, the team rolled in after the 11:00 hour.  Parking was a breeze as was the seating despite the potential for tight quarters during a rush.

The menu boasts over 152 hot dog and sausage combinations.  Again, according to the menu, their hot dogs are custom made by Boar's Head.  Your gonna get 7 1/2 inches of natural cased beef and pork.

I set my sights on the Deluxe Chili Cheese Dog w/ chili on the side.  The contents included cheddar cheese, bacon, onions and jalapeños.

What really got the party started was the portion of the menu containing the specialty fries!  Once again, the menu states there are over forty different combinations to customize your order.  We decided to order three off the menu with only a few minor tweeks at the recommendation of our on point and truly wonderful server, Michelle.

They included the following:  Italian Fries- With Italian seasoning, parmesan cheese and a tasty garlic butter sauce on top of recommended crinkle cuts fries.  Next up was the Buffalo Cheesy Fries- Recommended tater tots tossed in a mild buffalo sauce, and topped with melted cheese. Grill Master Fries- Recommended shoestring fries smothered in cheese, grilled onions, and thousand island dressing.

As the baskets of addictive potato masterpieces came out to the table, and they allicited multiple OMG responses.  Their beauty was only matched by their taste as they dropped on my tie and on my lap of which I did not care... I was in a high starch and fat high.  Once I came to, my boss was kind enough to offer their water so I could spot clean.

My dog was good but nothing compared to fries which could have easily been meal onto it's self.

All this goodness was washed down with a 22 ounces glass of Death Vally Root Beer.  They also serve beer.  Next to the root beer a cold glass of golden nectar would be an amazing means to compliment the meal!

So, food for thought, buy a block of cheese & a cheese grater. 2) melt the shredded cheese before it is served. The look of waxy pre-shredded cold cheese on top of the delicious dog was slightly unappetizing.

I can't remember the name of this place when it first opened but I do remember falling in love the first time I walked through the door, every city in the United States should have a great hot dog & hamburger joint but alas, it is not to be.

If you go here expect a line because great food joints have lines and Great Links usually has a line, if there is a line just wait till a seat opens up, it is worth the wait.

First the staff, these guys and gals are AWESOME .............. this place is like Cheers and even if they don't know your name they will make you feel at home.

Now the food, where to start ................. EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!!!!!!

They offer two styles of hot dogs, the natural casing or as they would tell you, the casing that ""snaps"", and the skinless casing. Both are 100% beef, I am a skinless guy myself but I have had both and I would not turn down either. 

There are twenty nine, yep, 29 different hot dogs & sausage items on the menu and they are all mouth watering, remember when you were a boy, how freaking awesome is summertime delicious!!!!!

the Las Vegas Chili Dog is the bomb, the Philly Griller Dog is delectable, the Mob Boss Dog is exquisite, and the Louisiana Hot Link is Extraordinary.

I love their old school crinkle cut fries, the burgers are tasty, juicy goodness and don't even get me going about the atmosphere of the place .................. it is one of those places where you feel at home the first time you walk in the door. 

OK, I just gave a hot dog & hamburger joint a five star review after promising my fellow Yelpers that I would reserve my five star reviews for the best of the best, so in other words ...................... NAILED IT!!!!!!!

Until next time fellow Yelpers ................. Be Local, Live Local, Buy Local!!!!!",a83l3rGEdnQie3n1TauJLA,2,1,5,VWDK5Zj13dy_XsQE69zcug

Because the food is great and the service is greater!  I ordered the Mob Boss, and I shared the Vegas Chili Cheese Fries with my gf.  The Mob Boss had grilled onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, with marinara sauce and 2 mozzarella sticks on top with parmesan cheese to top it off, and of course the dog, it snapped every single bite I took. Fresh natural casing! Mmm!  And the Vegas Chili Cheese Fries were unique, it wasn't your average ground beef, onions, and beans chili, it tasted like broken down Italian sausage in it.  I didn't need ketchup or any other condiments with it because everything was THAT good!

The dine-in setting was a little small, but I had no problem with it, they had sports playing on the TV's and they also have bar seating!

1893095,2015-06-25,6,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"It's no Dog Haus*, but damn I was surprised by the dogs here! Large menu of hotdog and sausage options, along with kicked-up fries and tots, burgers, and even some chicken options. 

VEGAS CHILI DOG: Sage sausage white chili, pepper jack cheese, relish, tomatoes, cayenne sour cream, and spicy mustard. I don't think I've had white chili before, but I definitely dig it on hot dogs! This pick was loaded up and practically needed a fork to eat, great chili and good snap on the standard dog.
MOB BOSS: Grilled onions, peppers, and mushrooms, with marinara sauce, tons of parm, and two cheese sticks. Get this with hot Italian sausage for the full effect. Again, covered in toppings and filling enough to be a meal. Great flavor in the sausage, too.

Opted for standard tots as our side, and we were encouraged to try a dipping sauce- opted for the fry sauce and was not disappointed. Crisp, fresh-made tots and ample, lightly-spiced fry sauce. Good light side to balance out the heavy hotdogs.

Signage indicates that they provide table service if you dine in, but we (and other visitors during our visit) used the walk-up and order method. Guys behind the counter were friendly.

Our previous venture to Four Kegs was fun but left me eating salads for the remainder of the day.  What was I to expect here?

Well, the location was good - by a Starbucks I like and by Lowe's as well, so it had promise if it turned out to be a positive establishment.  Thankfully, it was.

The food was bar-style food done pretty well.  The service was pretty much kids who were on the ball.  On the four visits I've had, I've been pleased with the continual quality of service.  My drink was never low for long and my food arrived quickly and hot.  

It's a simple menu and exactly what it promises: Burgers, fries, Italian sandwiches with a decent sauce, and offers a nice variety of french friends.  Their combo sauce of ketchup meets mayonnaise is pleasantly addicting and I enjoy the fact that they have a channel on the History Channel - thank you for not insulting the intelligence of your customers.

And Great Links has the formula to make you feel like you're one of their own! The first time I had a Great Links signature hot dog, I tried the ""Mob Boss"" (pictured). I can't even come up with the words to describe how full of flavor (and calories) it is! Their hot dogs are tasty, the marinate sauce wasn't special, but was still good, the peppers are grilled, and the best part is the mozzarella sticks in it! YUM!

One of the treats that Great Links offers is their fresh raspberry iced tea! SO BOMB! it's taDAfor! The staff is really friendly and welcoming and the environment is really chill. If you go there, you'll see that this place has definitely made an impression on Yelp because of all the stickers all over the place. The time I came here was for a Laker game and the flat screens they have up sufficed for the entertainment and the cook (I forgot his name :x) is a HUGE Laker fan also! He made the dinner interesting with all the cheering and comments to the tv screen.

The setup of Great Links isn't like any other place here in Las Vegas and I'd have to say, aside from the great customer service, it would be the coolest part of this great Vegas spot! There aren't a lot of places set up this way so it makes it even more special! Their menu includes vegetarian dishes, beer brats cooked and marinated on the spot, a ton of different variances of their hot dog recipes! They also have sausages for the hot & spicy lovers out there. Their Italian fries are a basket OD garlic-y goodness! I highly recommend extra crisy shoestring fries! Perfect addition to any hot dog combination! I also tried their Vegas fries! This isn't for the light-hearted French fry lover; or even the heavy hearted (HIGH IN CALORIES, but good!) but if a friend orders them, grab a fork and grab a bite! Definitely worth a try!

I will have to come back to try the rest of their colorful palette of hot dogs and fries! Their great customer service bumps them up a star also! Go great with Great Links! :)",bTTZzC8RvTxTOeGMvJ5icQ,3,4,4,l05D8UNG6l6BNRbfV0SlzQ

I ordered the ball park dog, which has mustard, ketchup, relish and onions.. sounds good-hmm, and beer battered onion rings with a diet pop.  My husband ordered a kielbasa sausage, Italian fries and a diet pop.  Lets start off with the chopped onion on my hotdog!  the onion was chopped in quite large pieces and there were WAY TOO MANY PEICES ON ONE HOTDOG!! It tasted like they used the relish that has the cloves in it, so I didn't care for the relish on there, and they put soooo much mustard on it and barely any ketchup at all.. all in all, I was very disappointed with my hotdog.  The onion rings were quite tasty, light and crispy, just the way I like them.  My husbands purchase, well it came on a bun with the sausage cut into four small pieces, he took one out and it is the way they cooked it! so it kept falling apart on him, they didn't drain the sauerkraut that was put onto it so the bun got very soggy.. I don't know if anyone else likes sauerkraut juice dripping from your bun, but he sure didn't.  His Italian fries came with some kind of Italian seasoning and parm. cheese and olive oil. They put so much olive oil on his fries that when he was done eating them, there had to be at least a half a cup of oil in the bottom of his dish, they put way too much oil on them... he was very disappointed with both the sausage and the fries that he ordered... when we first got there he asked them to turn the tv down, we were really close to it, and they turned it down one... they have two tvs in there and my husband and I were the only customers in there at the time he asked them to turn it down, so that just wasn't right of them... when we first walked in and the waitress came and took our order I noticed she had gloves on, I was thinking that was good.. If I had realized that they don't change their gloves in between orders.. (they didn't that day while we were there) we would have asked them to change them.

We were scouring around town to find a great place for hot dogs and so far fell short... until Great Links.

The first time we ate here, we were literally overwhelmed by the selection here. I mean in addition to hot dogs, you have burgers, sammys, a selection various fried items smothered with a different toppings and salads. And for you vegetarians out there, they have a mighty fine selection of veggie kielbasa, bratwurst, italian sausage, hamburgers. I've never heard of veggie kielbasa, but I thought that was a pretty brilliant thing.

Personally, being of the meat eating persuasion, I ordered myself a grilled chicken salad. Yeah boring I know. But honestly, my company was instituting this whole exercise/eat right initiative and I felt obligated to participate. (I have since fallen off the bandwagon.) Really at a place like this, I wasn't really expecting much because it is a burger/hot dog joint after all. I was surprised though. Although it's romaine, it's clearly freshly chopped (note, none of that early brownish tinge you get when it's been cut a long time ago) with other veggies.They have a very simple oil and vinegar dressing that hit the spot. Plus, the chicken was plentiful and moist. For less than $7, it's far superior to many grilled chicken salad in the same price range.

The hubs couldn't help but try their artisan root beer. For us soda drinkers, it's got that real root beer-ish, herbacious flavouring (in an absolutely good way) that brought us back to the good ol' days. A must try!

Not being on a company diet, the hubs has had the rueben, their KC Masterpiece Nascar special featuring Boarshead sausage, their italian sausage and side orders of their fried zucchini, regular shoestring fries and freshly cut french fries. Their reuben was pretty great while the KC Masterpiece Nascar special was a little overwhelming with all the cheese, BBQ sauce on it - it kind of detracted from the flavours of the sausage. Regardless, their plainer renditions fare better - the casings got a nice snap to it.

The sides were a hit or miss. The fried zucchini's batter was a little too heavy and fell apart when you picked it up. Their fresh cut fries don't have quite the crispiness that I look for in a french fry. I prefer their shoestring fries which were much crispier and lighter -- FYI - their shoesting is more the size of your standard McDonald's french fries. 

Overall, given the price, I would definitely recommend this place for a good tuck in of hot dogs and root beer (4).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,7,4,5Yj1gz8D0DMs5O-s1Ir6oQ

I ordered the Kraut dog which came with mustard, onions, and sauerkraut, and then I wanted some tater tots with nacho cheese added. I like that they give you the option of liquid cheese, or shredded/melted cheese when you add them to a side. They also had a variety of fries, and sides.  The tots came out first and they were cooked good..not falling apart each time I pick one up with my fork. The dog came out just after and the snap on the hot dog was fantastic! It was loaded with sauerkraut, onions, and mustard! They don't skimp AT ALL!   I paid $3.75 or $3.95 for the dog, and around $2.95 or something for the tots.

2362731,2013-07-09,5,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"Perhaps my trip this restaurant was just a stray from the norm, or perhaps the people that review this place have never been to a quality burger and dog type place. 

I gave this restaurant a fair shot and was excited based on Yelp reviews. Yelp rarely fails me but this was one of those times where it fell short of expectations. 

Is there a good-ole-boy system at this place? All I heard the owner talking about was their award winning burgers to whom I supposed are the regulars. My wife, daughter and I were the only people under the age of 50 there, so perhaps that explains why their food was so bland and flavorless. 

I ordered the pastrami, which was cooked really well. However, there was little taste. I have tried pastrami from dozens of restaurants and this was bottom-of-the-barrell in terms of taste. 

My wife ordered grilled cheese, which is impossible to screw up unless you're 4 years old or completely inept. It was solid, but she ordered it with bacon and bacon saves everything. The bread was alright, but seemed store-bought. 

My daughter ordered chicken nuggets and she said they were disgusting. I looked at them and they appeared to be the type you buy from a frozen food section. 

We shared fries, which apparently do not come with any sort of salt or seasoning. 

To be fair, the waitresses there were super friendly and on top of their game. I hope the owner realizes this and recognizes them accordingly. 

What I found off-putting on a personal level was that the owner came out and greeted every single table, asked about their experience and bragged about their food.... except for our table. He also missed a kid run into the restaurant, grab two soda cups, fill them and leave without paying. All because he was too busy bragging about his food to the NASCAR crowd that was infesting this place. 

One of the cooks also took the time to venture into the diner and talk about the burger competition they had previously won. he oddly went out of his way to state that ""I don't think they'll want us back next year. Not that we're cheating but..."" and I didn't catch the end. 

Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this place considering the positive reviews on yelp. I will eventually give this place another chance to redeem itself and, if it isn't able to, I'll suspect that they are asking friends and family to circumvent the yelp reviews. 

Either that or they rarely get anyone who isn't an AARP member and can actually handle salt and seasoning.",hBEYo4aJRsUOGGoOScvJzw,1,1,2,52gJGyXJA4gNngvkj1ufQQ

Finally, we decided to try somewhere new and this place popped up on yelp places near us. We all met up there and I have to say, I thought this place was going to be a lot bigger and more of a sit down dining place like a Red Robins or Applesbees since it's a Brewhouse and grill. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting. There wasn't a whole lot of room in there. Just one row of seating so you want to make sure you go at a good time or you won't be able to dine in and will have to get your stuff to go. They have a wall of bottles of beer that you can choose from. I was disappointed that we came in on a Friday night and they were out of their root beer on tap which is supposed to be one of the best things to try so I wasn't even able to get any like I wanted to. The food is a hit and miss. We all got different things to share so we could try a bunch of the menu items. Some things were really good and others I didn't really care for. I did really like the fried green beans. They'd probably be the only thing out of the things we did try, that I would go back to get. I got the pastrami cheeseburger and I can't say that I was impressed with it. The burgers weren't the best thing. Others got some of the sausages and hot dogs and they thought they were good. I also got the fried pickles. I love pickles, but they fry whole spears instead of slices and I think it was too much pickle and not enough breading. The customer service was ok. He came to check on us a few times before we got our food, but not so much after. We had to get up and refill our own drinks since he wasn't coming around. Not sure if we were supposed to or not. I think the place is worth a shot. They do have some good food and good flavors, but I don't think everything is great there so just go with whatever your gut tells you to try. I think I'll go back to try the pineapple sausage that I didn't get last time, but wish I would've over the burger.",uT88e0NuTpxcqcv3cAyUKA,2,0,3,-ZNEgSRx5BW4nYK9rFwk2g

When I walked in I was planning on ordering take out, and stepped straight to the counter where the menu was.  There were two guys (cooks) there in the open kitchen behind the bar, and there was zero greeting, so I decided whatever and seated myself as the sign says.  A young lady comes out and greets me and takes my drink order.  I order a root beer (which I was not aware that it was the non-refill type), the root beer was quite good and the highlight of the meal, so I will give it that.

I look over the menu a little more and decide on the chili dog and chili cheese fries, which I figured I couldn't go wrong with.  This is where my disappointment began, now I was pretty hungry not having eaten for several hours because of traveling so again I was looking forward to this...the fries were over cooked, and the chili had little to no taste, even after adding salt and pepper.  I ate most of them because I was hungry and they cost me good money.  Next was the chili dog which I was already worried about because of the fries, the dog comes out and it is pretty plain, just chili on top and nothing too large for $4+ and so I take a bit and yep I was right nothing special, same no taste chili and the hotdog is just average (Costco has better hotdogs), the cheap bun falls apart half way through for no reason (it wasn't the chili) and so that make it even worse.  Truthfully I wanted to just get up and leave as my server (who was a nice girl) had disappeared, and the two cooks wouldn't have even noticed or cared.  But I finished most of my meal and paid and left.

I wont be going back as there is nothing to go back for, tasteless food, average service, below average atmosphere.  And inflated pricing for what you get.  This is sad for me when I had great expectations for a locally owned place.",I57fftEU2mFsDp7lY0Ed0A,0,0,2,vOWc4azK2pC1KrkMNpAs2g

I went with the Pastrami burger which was slightly over cooked with grilled onions, spicy mustard and melted provo with pastrami piled on top of a 1/3 LB meat patty.

We sat down and the waitress/cashier took our order.  5 minutes later we received our 2 orders of fries, which was ok, but the rest of our food didn't arrive for another 15 minutes.  So basically the fries were almost cold when our hotdogs arrived.  We then received the rest of our food but one order was completely wrong.  The waitress apologized and sent it back to the cook, but it was another 10-15 minute wait for them to make it again.  Fries are now ice cold at this point.  No offer to give us a discount, get us hot fries, nada.  

Went to the counter to pay and now another person emerged from the back.  He printed our receipt, I handed him my debit card, he charged it and handed it back for me to sign.  All this without saying ONE WORD to us.  No hi, thank you, how was your meal, have a nice day......nothing.  I walked out thinking ""what a jerk"".  

The waitress was very nice, but everything else was less than satisfactory.  I'll normally give a place two times before we zap them from our restaurant list.  They've been zapped......",haVz3V2Nux3V4c7jHOZ3jQ,1,0,2,4w2E5qHzYD3VbkMVQv00gA

We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said ""disgusting"". It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my ""disgusting"" game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like ¾ of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the ""natural"" fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.

Like I said I wanted to like this place, I like the décor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style. I'll continue on my personal search for a great Las Vegas burger.",-SjQXQd-IRfOdUdYYwWGOQ,4,0,2,Bj4NCP8GpFrevZanyagHIA

I was excited to see they offer veggie options and that is what I ordered: vegetarian chili and vegetarian hot dog plus a side salad. Most other items are fried, covered in cheese and sauces. I see this place as somewhere to stop by to watch the game, have a beer and eat some fried foods. 
The open kitchen with the bar next to it is very inviting to chat with the employees. There aren't very many seats other than that so maybe getting items to go is another option.
The restaurant could use a deep cleaning on the floors and such- it felt a bit grimy to me. 
Also, I saw an employee serve himself a fountain drink and drink it in the kitchen. Later the same employee scratched his head/neck while behind the counter next to the stove.
 I don't know, the heavy greasy foods and the lack of cleanliness of the place are enough for me to pass on this as a choice next time I am in the area.",YVQFzWm0H72mLUh-8gzd5w,4,2,2,qyBEymnwRESJ9ItmkuOWpg

I used to eat here for lunch on the weekends, now I wish I'd gone even more. It's a small establishment on Craig Rd near 95, reminds me of a diner. They have many other options besides hot dogs, including brats and chicken, with vegetarian selections as well. There's a decent selection of beers, mostly bottles, and root beer on tap!

I always get the veggie dogs, and I wish I knew what brand they used. They taste better and have better texture than all other vegetarian hot dogs. The Chicago dog is my fav, and I also love the NY dog with sauerkraut and mustard. I definitely recommend trying their white Vegas chili, whether it's on fries or a dog. Sausage and sage is an awesome combination and it's delicious. Also, cannot get enough of the grillmaster fries, oh my they're addictive. 

The service is always great. This place draws a local crowd, seems like many people know the owners/employees. I've had many different waiters/waitresses, eventually a few times each. Everyone is friendly and attentive.

They have many choices for hot dogs, sausages and burgers along with many other choices, I almost ordered fish and chips.They had a chili burger, normally I make sure whether it's chili the red soup stuff or chili the green pepper, reading the description it said white chili, since I had no idea what that was, I asked the server. She brought me a sample. It's made with a sage sausage, it's a lot like the country gravy I make for biscuits and gravy.

I ended up ordering a patty melt. Cheese, grilled onions, burger on grilled dark rye. It was good, not great, but good. The burger patty was lacking, it appeared to be a frozen formed patty, dry after cooking. The preparation, of the sandwich, was great, with a fresh burger patty, that was still juicy, it would have been a great sandwich.

The server, I didn't get the name, an attractive young lady at lunch time on 6/19/2014. She was friendly, helpful, attentive, everything a person in customer service should be. 

I've read all the reviews, they allude to the burgers winning awards, so my burger may have been an aberration. I would say, I will go back and try a burger again, but after reading the reviews about the snap in the dogs, I want to try one of them. Funny thing is, I saw the Great Links sign and I actual went in this place for a hot dog, got lost in the menu and ended up ordering a burger.

I believe the 1/2 lb patty melt, I had, was about $7.50, which is about the going price for this type of sandwich, so the price is reasonable.

The food was really mediocre considering it was $6.50 for a burger and $5 for a hot dog. If we were a couple of dollars cheaper I probably would have been okay with it. 

The reason I'm giving it 3 stars because I cook behind the counter never changed his gloves and was wiping his face with sweat the whole time. Luckily the meal tasted good.

Our food was hot and fresh. As soon as our food came out of the fryer it was at our table and oh it was Wonderful!! Fried mushrooms in their beer batter was just the way to start. You must try the cottage fries which are really homemade chips!! 
Being from the Chicago land area, I know a good Chicago dog and this was over the top. My daughter had the fish and chips and absolutely loved it! 
Ashley had her hands full with all her tables, but you would have never known. She made it look like a breeze and we never felt neglected! She has a great personality and seems like she really enjoys her job!
Both the cooks were nice and doing an amazing job getting food out dast, fresh and yummy!!

I opted for the Philly Griller. Covered with grilled peppers and onions, it was quite possibly the best tube steak I've ever consumed. PW got some sort of chili dog, as did IW (no relation). 

They have root beer on tap as well as draft beers. Definitely coming back for a bite and a brew. Lunch for three was just north of thirty bucks and worth much more.

The food the rest of the family had was enjoyed just as much...will definitely be back! Staff was great and place was clean.

The only thing I would recommend is that if your at a table where there is veggie and non-veggie orders being placed - order the veggie item first as there was a gap of about 10 minutes between the food coming out.

Uncle Al's uses their very own dogs and that's part of what makes this place so special. Their dogs ""snap"" when you bite in, just like a good Chicago dog should. (They have skinless for you wusses that don't understand the true nature of a good dog.)

Aside from Chicago, they have about another dozen styles of hot dogs -- all of them wrong except the Chicago. (Ketchup?? On a hot dog? Ew!) They also have a variety of other sandwiches and burgers, but if you have any sense in your head, you come here for the dogs.

Aside from the dogs, they have real french fries. They're kind of limp but for some reason, I still really like them. I've tried the coleslaw twice and regretted it twice. Stick to the dogs...and the limp fries.",KefuZdgU_o1A6GM95T39Nw,0,0,5,9BfNeeKeN0YiZdtV35NZiQ

Given the name, I had to try a hot dog the first time! Priced at $4.59 I ordered the ""Philly Griller dog"" that had grilled peppers, onion and cheese sauce. Yum! I couldn't even eat the whole thing so half went to hubby who didn't care for the char taste, but I like a good charred dog. The peppers and onions had a great flavor and there was a fair amount of cheese sauce. I also had some ""Italian Fries"" priced at $4.29 and had my choice of shoestring or crinkle-cut. I chose the shoestring and it was tossed in a garlic butter sauce and topped with parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. These were good! I asked for a side of ranch to dip them in and the ranch was good. Our server was nice and checked on us often.

It is a drive from the Strip for visitors, as well as it should be. I'm quite sure carnivores could find other glittery gimmicky ""meat in tube form"" onthe Strip; however, for me, its about the vegetarian options and supporting the local economy when visiting. And, the options were enough for a couple visits or infrequent visits. For a weekend visit to Vegas, my bro and I visited twice.

With that said, vegetarian options doesn't mean healthy. Nor do they or we profess to be healthy. The meals are ""stick to your ribs"" good tasty meals. This is a place where the carnivores and vegetarian friends can meet, share a table and watch the game. Beer, brats, and (foot/basket/base)balls.

I can't speak for my bro meals; I had the Mob Boss (grilled peppers, onions, marinara, and two mozzarella sticks) and a simple veg chili dog. Both were very tasty, wolfed them down on each occasion. Then we also shared the Grilled Master fries (similar to In-n-Out fries, animal style), buffalo cheesy fries (I liked this, could use a little more buffalo sauce), and zucchini (crispy breaded outside with well-done juicy inside) . Sides were definitely hit the spot.

Staff were friendly and helpful, but somewhat distant/nonattentive at times. Guess it was close to the holidays and they just want to have fun, too. Understandable.

This place was full at dinner time on a Friday night, and many of the customers seemed to be regulars.  I ordered the Ortega Bacon Cheese Burger (the name might be a little different, not sure) and it was great.  I did sub swiss for the pepper jack, and the result was a little less heat than I would have liked, but that's my fault. It was still delicious, with high quality ingredients.  

The shoestring fries were hot and fresh and one order is more than enough for two people.  Try it with one of their fry sauces.  I can't wait to go back and try one of their hot dogs, which they have made for them by Boar's Head.   

Two soft drinks, one order of fries, one burger and one cheesesteak cost about $19 before the tip.  The service very good, and they were prompt with refills.

Which is extremely upsetting and disappointing considering I am a frequent patron of this place. The ONE time I call to advise of an issue I get an asinine excuse for customer service. 

I placed a multiple order pickup for my office and went to pick up on my lunch. I drove there paid then got back to work. Opened the boxes to find a sandwich was missing and received an extra order of fries. I called to advise and was at first gonna ask to pickup the sandwich but was immediately shot down and was basically called a liar. I was completely stumped as all the food went to one place and looking right at it and told him it wasn't in the bag. This ""manager"",Julian, kept arguing and refused to meet me half way of either refunding only the sandwich or make another for me to pick up. His excuse? They've been gypped before so. . . Ha, wow! He wanted me to bring the entire order back to ""prove"" I didn't get the item. Seriously? For one fucking sandwich? I seriously can't believe this place will treat a regular with such little respect. I get it - you want to believe you do everything right all the time - but we are all humans and prone to error. This one time shows me where they hold their customer base. Hold on tight to that $9 - you're losing much more than that with this experience. 

Like I said, it's shocking and extremely disappointing because when I typically go - I eat in with no error. I go once during the lunch rush and complain ONCE and get treated like some hooligan trying to rob the place. I will NEVER return and trust that I will spread the word of how fucking awful you treat your patrons.

Among other things, I really enjoy Burgers & Hot Dogs....and this place has plenty of it!  There were so many things on the menu, I didn't know where to start.....

So, I went with a Pastrami Cheeseburger (Pastrami, Grilled Onions, Provolone, & Mustard on a Burger)....and a Regular Hot Dog.

Since I was dining solo, I sat at the counter behind the Grill.  I waited patiently and watched the short order cook prepare the artery choking goodness for all the patrons and myself.....that was fun.

After about 10 minutes my order was up.  I went after the Pastrami Cheeseburger first.....wow, it was tasty.  I liked the proportion of Pastrami to Cheeseburger.....some places put too much Pastrami and it overwhelms the burger....not here.  I also liked how well the Grilled Onions tasted.....they were chopped in med sized pieces which I prefer to the larger sized ones you find in some places.  It was so good, I didn't add anything to it....I ate it as it was served.

Next, I added some Mustard to the Regular Dog and bit into it.  I felt a familiar ~Snap~ as I took that first bite.....awesome!  You don't find too many snapper dogs around town, so I was pleased that I did.  Every bite was full of Hot Dog goodness.

The selection was awesome and since everything is a la carte, you aren't locked into a combo meal you don't really want. We shared a small shoestring fry and each got two dogs, a plain and a specialty. 

The hotdogs themselves are great, they pop in your mouth, are juicy and full of flavor. I chose the deluxe chili dog which is basically a standard chili dog plus bacon, onion, jalapeños and a literal fistful of shredded cheese. I'm super picky about chili, can't stand it if it's soupy or greasy or overly spicy for no reason. I wasn't disappointed, everything about it was delicous. My hunny picked the Las Vegas chili dog, and I can honestly say, it was basically a flavor explosion on a bun. 

My order was misread and delivered wrong at first, but the cook not only insisted on fixing it, did so in record time. The server was nothing but helpful, the overall service was great.  If the order had come out correctly the first time, this would be a solid five star review, as it is, I'd honestly say it's more of a 4.5 than a 4.

Mind you as long as the end result was a culinary masterpiece I am a big fan of a good, tasty sandwich I was open and excited looking forward to tasting a fantastic dog  on a toasted bun with raw onions, relish, and brown and yellow mustard. A basic sandwich hard to do wrong. But the end result was so wrong. The taste of the meat and bun was lost somewhere between the cooked onions, peppers, burgers and whatever else was cooked on the grill.

We ordered the Ortega Bacon Pepper Jack Burger, the Old West Burger and the award winning Jalapeno Guacamole Cheeseburger. WOW!

Actually, when I first walked in, I kind of fell in love. The atmosphere is relaxed and our server was super friendly, gave us time and answered any questions we had. 

We ordered the Chicago and the Las Vegas hot dog with the natural Italian fries on the side. The fries came out first and unfortunately they were just ok. Too much parmesan cheese, too salty and too fatty and they got soggy very quick. The hot dogs were ok, almost too much of everything in my opinion. 

Then, as soon as we walked out of this place, I ended up having an upset stomach that lasted all day. But this also could be due to me eating generally organic and healthy and perhaps my body doesn't like fatty food anymore. My husband was ok and he ate the same as I did, so I don't think the meat was bad. Regardless, I didn't like it enough to go back any time soon, but if I did, I think I would stay away from all the loaded hot dogs and try a simple one or get a sandwich.",akEFRm7rqlxIANKyTlaTOg,2,0,3,ECYU2Kec0IdEV0sQnDiPyw

We finally made it over to Great Links this weekend and I am kicking myself for making it out here sooner!  I have wasted many, many years of AMAZING edible delights by not coming to Great Links earlier.  At least I have seen the light and the error of my ways!

We sampled the Streets of New York Dog (yum), the Ball Park Dog (classic), and a kraut dog (tasty), as well as the über-fantastic Italian tater tots.  The dogs were all amazing!  The have a great snap when you bite in to them, which is always a sign of a quality dog.  The toppings were all on point and in a decent amount for the dogs we ordered.  I think the kraut here is some of the best I have ever had.  EVER.  

Now on to the the most fabulous tater tots I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  We tried the Italian tater tots on our server's recommendation.  We were going to do fries, but her told us the tater tots would stand up better to all of the sauce, so we went with it.  Oh my goodness, those things were tasty!  The garlic goodness was great and the Parmesan on top sent it over the moon.  We had them finished before I had finished my hot dog, so I used some of my bun to soak up the extra sauce and it was stay fantastic.  Yummmm!

I can't wait to go back and try more dogs, sausages, burgers, and everything else they had on the huge menu.  I see this place becoming a very regular place for my family.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,7,7,5,R6s7-3vE-yQkz65x2aDeSA

I saw it recently while driving around and thought ""gee, I gotta get me some of that.""  So come Saturday I was really craving a hot dog and off I went to be wrapped up in the menu like a hot dog in a bun.  It is a big menu for such a small place.  There are many different varieties of hot dogs as one might expect from a place called Great Links Hot Dogs.  But there is so much more.  There are also many types of sausage sandwiches to choose from as well.  Did I forget to mention they are famous for their burgers.  Yeah, they have won the Burger Wars burger competition two years running.  Then there are the many diffferent fried potato variations and combinations too.  Onion rings, jalapeno poppers, fried mushrooms.  The menu goes on and on.  I was so fascinated in all the offerings they have that I forgot all about my hot dog craving and went with a sausage sandwich instead.  It was a toss up between the Roasted Garlic and Mozzarela or the Spinach and Asiago Cheese.  The Spinach and Asiago is topped with mustard, mayo, tomato, pickles, relish and sport peppers not unlike a Chicago style hot dog.  It sounded damn good as a Chicago style dog is my favorite.  In the end it was the Roasted Garlic and Mushroom sausage that won my stomach and my heart.  A perfectly grilled chicken sausage stuffed with cheese and mushrooms then topped with grilled onion, bell peppers and mushrooms with the addition on marinara on top of that.  I also got an order of the stuffed jalapenos.  There were six in a basket and were served piping hot fresh out of the fryer.  The crisp coating was not oily despite being fried for about 4 minutes.  The molten cream cheese inside was nearly too much for my mouth to handle but the cooling richness of the ranch dip helped everything slide down.  Add a 22 ounce Amber Bock beer and Saturday is now the happiest day of the week.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,1,4,8lr05CMHQCLZTLDh_cYgGQ
4154902,2014-06-28,2,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"Came here tonight w my husband. I couldn't eat anything there because of how disgusted I was with some serious hygiene concerns:

1. Started off with a dirty chair - crumbs and drips of liquid- no big deal, I understand. I asked the waitress wipe it down which she happily did, yet for the fact she only wiped down half if the chair..... Oh well I am hungry, I will sit in the still wet chair with unknown liquid....

2. Saw the cook with his gloves on wipe his nose with his gloves. Like a strong finger length swipe of the nostril.  He didn't change his gloves after that. His gloves were also clearly moistened so you can tell that his hands were sweating under the gloves which makes me wonder, how long have those gloves been on? 

3. Next a different cook comes out into the dining room with gloves on again- gets himself a drink of water. I can clearly can see water drips through them. He then takes a napkin to his nose and wipes- does not change gloves. Then this guy tries to take our order, same gloves - pointing at the menu what are the featured items, giving me a closer view of the gloves to confirm, yes your hands are sweating bullets under these gloves which appear to have been on for at least 3 hours...  This guy was really nice and the food sounded awesome but the more and more I had to witness this weird Glove phenomenon.... I couldn't even order. Who wears gloves in the dining room of a restaurant????

My husband got his food to go, but I am pregnant and after viewing everyone w gloves on and wiping noses, getting personal drinks, taking orders, even flipping through a magazine, and then apparently not changing gloves - too much for me to risk a food borne illness or any other germ.

Really sucks the menu looked great too. Everyone was nice, it was just so awkward and the most disturbing thing is that these folks seemed to act like it was no big deal to not change gloves, which makes me wonder goes on behind the scenes in terms of cleanliness.

There were three guys preparing the food, and one woman who ran the register as well as the entire floor. She greeted us by asking if our order was for there or to go. Since we said 'to go', she said that she would help us in a moment. She then proceeded to take an order at one table, ring up another table, and check on one more table before returning to take our order. 
Okay, this was fine. Sort of. What ruined the visit for me was how she chewed her gum, open-mouth and all, while took our order. She didn't look at us, and didn't say anything when she presented us with our receipt to sign. No enthusiasm or care for anything, especially our business. That makes me angry. 

We both got the 'Chicago Dog'. Since the dogs are made with Boar's Head meat, they did have pretty good flavor. However, maybe we should have chosen something other than a Chicago dog, as nothing compares to the real thing.

I guess they used to use Boars Head Hot Dogs, but they are no longer able to get them from their supplier. The hot dogs they get now are okay, but an all beef hot dog, not the beef and sausage blend like the Boars Head brand.
I got the deluxe chili cheese hot dog and the deluxe chili cheese fries. The fry was the star of the show here, not the hot dog.
Still, all in all the place is nice, the service is nice, just a little disappointed in the ""Great Link"" I was hoping for.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,5,4,3,Kx5CRLpZAW4AdnGKeuMVcQ

Michelle was super cool and took wonderful care of us.  Everyone there was really friendly.  We'll definitely come back.

Expect to wait for your order as they take meticulous pride in creating your dog. 
I ordered the Chicago Dog and some tator tots that rocked. Cooked to crunchy perfection and I couldn't stop popping them in my mouth. loved em. Exactly what I was craving.

4721011,2017-08-11,1,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"I've been here a few times and this is my favorite place to get hot dogs in town. Great Links makes fantastic dogs, sausages and burgers, and everything is fresh and made to order.

One of my favorite things here is their green sage chili. There is nothing else quite like it and you just need to try it if you come here. It comes on their Vegas Dog, Vegas Burger or Vegas fries, and I always get one of these every time I come here. I've also had their normal chili, and it's very good to if you don't want to try something new, but it isn't unique like the sage chili is.

One awesome thing is that they will make any of their sausages the same way they will make any of their specialty dogs. The last time we were here my wife got the Kielbasa (the largest sausage) prepared like the Philly dog. It was smothered in sauteed onions, peppers and cheese on a special roll that has been lightly toasted. It was amazing and huge.

The hot links are also very good and this is a great place to grab a juicy burger. The only downside here, to me, is that their ""brewhouse"" in their name is a little misleading. They have just a few draft lines and some bottled beer, but nowhere near the selection as the name infers.

All in all this is just a killer place to go for big lunch or dinner. If hot dogs, burgers and sausages with lots of great toppings are your thing, check this place out.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,2,1,5,FT3Zqaxv1JY-REk37WKbqg

They use Boars Head brand hot dogs. They are the perfect start to all their hot dogs and they have tons of them anyway you can think of. They also have tons if burgers and fry options. It was very hard to pick what we wanted because everything sounded good!! We both choose the Philly dog with cheese sauce. Joel ordered the mushroom and Swiss burger. Of course we had to pick cheese fries and onion rings. I ordered a whole dill pickle, but they were out. They were super apologetic about it and instead gave me pickle spears for free! The food was excellent and messy! Be prepared to use ALL the napkins! The hot dogs had a snap to them and could totally be eaten with a fork and knife. The fries were crisp as were the onion rings. Great Links even offers fry sauce. Joel's burger was also tasty and moist. Perfectly cooked too! ( It's hard to get a perfect medium burger sometimes.) We both left so full.

My  favorites out of the hot dog is the Las Vegas chili dog or chicago dogs. I also often get the sausages, mostly hot links. Hot dogs are Boars head so they have natural casings or you can get other types without the snap, even a white hot dog/veal one. Sides wise their fried green beans with wasabi mayo is really good. To drink get Sprechers root beer off the tap! Also their raspberry ice tea isn't that regular Lipton soda fountain stuff, it's brewed so that is good too. 

Stick with that and I think you'll have a good dinner here. Cheap, good American type food.

Seeing as they won some ""best of"" burgers,  thought their burgers would be fantastic, but it isn't any different from any old greasy spoon. Also fish type stuff, is pre battered so not anything you can't do at home with some Gordon's. I feel like some stuff is offered, just to offer it. I thought the turkey burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches and tuna melt were decent though. 

My one thing about this place is that do not come at peak hours. I don't know if the owner is too cheap to hire another person but they really need more than one waitress, there's never been two waitresses I've ever seen. We went recently where it hit max capacity in this small place and she was in the weeds the whole time. It was hard to flag her down for some extra sauce, I had to wait a long time by the cash register, I just got up to serve ourselves some drinks (good thing I did not get raspberry tea that was behind the register). She already is running around like mad even when it's not a full house so they really need two people at least during the rush. It's not fair to the poor gal or to customers. I know it's not her fault, but some people were upset...and it sucks if she gets crapped on for something she cannot control at all. I'm going to stick with going only in the odd hours. I don't like going to a place and get no service. 

Overall though, I like this place.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,1,1,4,EH-vShbOW1pf0SAA-Q6WAg

They have good hotdogs here. They're fresh and you could hear the snap when you bite into one. I personally like to keep it simple and get the chili dog. Very flavorful and I don't like beans so this is perfect for me. The cheese is nice and melted. But I've also tried their Mob Boss Dog which has mozzarella sticks, peppers, onions, marinara, mushrooms and parmesan cheese.  It's a great hotdog when I'm not feeling so plain.

The main reason I like this place is their Italian fries. One of my favorite fries in Vegas. Each fry is loaded with Parmesan and Italian spices. I don't like sharing mine so get your own!

I remember John Curtas raving about their burgers but I still haven't deviated from their hotdogs.  One of these days, I'll give their burger a try...with a side of Italian fries of course!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,5,4,5EmfS1BLwDK3J4afcxtP6w

5383924,2012-12-28,4,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"I'm a woman who knows her way around a dog - both the male variety and the frankfurter type. Ok, no more man bashing! I like men, might even review them as a a group, However, decided not to resist the joke. So, no offense right? Plus, I'm about to tell you all about a great place. so forgive me, this one time.
Ok, locally owned, which I LOVE. Family has fought hard to keep the place going and has had some incredible challenges, including the wife's battle with cancer.  However, they remain committed to good food, good service, and good attitudes. I know they won a burger competition put on by Fox 5. Not much staff turnover which tells me a lot. They had a coupon in last year's Entertainment Book.  I haven't checked the new one.  Haven't seen them on Groupon or Living Social. I need to check Restaurants.com, Prices are fair without a coupon though and they have meal deals.
Before I forget, they offer some very interesting vegetarian options. I would order one to try it, but who am I kidding? I'm there for the dogs. Sometimes, I'm there for the clams. Sometimes, for the rueben, but never for the veggies. Wait, do breaded and fried mushrooms count?
Incredibly large menu, which I'm sure they do to please customers but must be hard to maintain. They even do breakfast.
My favorite is the Atlanta dog. Not to be a diva, but I special order mine and they always remember.  I like the dog in the natural casing.  They do the dog a little longer for me. They also take the cole slaw out of the fridge before they start the dog cause I don't want cold slaw to cool off the hot dog. Ok, feel free to groan. I swear I didn't mean the pun. I try to be a woman of integrity, so I'm going to leave it. 
I also like the red onion sauce - that might be the NY dog. Shame that I was born in NY and I'm not sure which is my dog.  Doesn't matter cause the dogs are described on the menu. :Plus you can order whatever you would like.
I'm not much of a fry girl, but you need to order them here.  They offer different kinds and great toppings.  They have beer, which I haven't had yet.  Well, I've had beer, just not at Great Links. They have ice cream and shakes, both of which I have had and enjoyed.

5390832,2012-11-27,1,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"Was all the way on the Northwest side of town to go play a poker game at my brother's, and somehow my friend and I ended up at Great Links.  Let's face it, Chili dogs, burgers and fries just go together with a night of drinking and poker.  I wasn't about to offer Sweet Tomatoes express as a suggestion for our pre-game snack.

Right when I walked in I noticed a big board on the counter detailing their win as the Best Burger in Las Vegas.  I remember seeing some stuff about this contest on Fox 5 and John Curtas was one of the guest judges, so I figured it had some clout behind it.  I asked the waitress about it because I wanted to order the EXACT burger that won, and she was actually very upfront about how the contest was set up, and that it did have exclusions (I don't believe my current favorite Bachi was able to be represented due to cost, same with Burger Bar)   Hmmmm, doubt already started setting in.   Turns out the burger that won that contest was the Jalapeno Guacamole burger, which turned out to be the one that I was most interested in anyhow, bonus!  Cayenne Mayo, Tomato, Grilled onions and jalapenos, pepperjack cheese, and an onion ring filled with guac.  Yeah, sign me up!   

My friend and I decided to share a side, and while I pushed for one of the actual french fry concoctions, he asked if I wanted to share the Frito Pie.  Uh, I guess.  When the food arrived (after a few beers, naturally), the burger looked impressive.  I'm all about saving the best for last though so I tackled the Frito Pie first.  Eh, tasted just like Frito Pie.  I guess I shouldn't knock it since it tasted exactly what a Frito Pie should taste like, but I was hoping for a bit of ingenuity or something that might set it apart.  After cursing my friend for twisting my arm into ordering that and not one of their fry options, I bit into the burger.  I got exactly what I expected and wanted out of it:  greasy, flavorful, and messy.  I felt like a star of a Carl's Jr commercial, except not nearly as hot.  I had also ordered the 1/2 lb version instead of 1/3, and that wasnt necessary even though I ate the entire thing.

So all in all, the burger was very tasty, even though I still prefer places like Bachi, Fuku, and maybe even In N Out.  I wouldn't recommend the Frito Pie and would imagine their fries are probably pretty damn tasty (shakes fist at friend).   The service was friendly and prices were very reasonable which bumps my total score from a mid 3 to a 4.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,UgHT8mRd8jhMOSTvaw_gqQ

5416754,2010-11-18,0,StNAnvyhVISULAFmO_Ke1Q,"As a kid growing up in home were mom didn't work, we rarely ate hot dogs. She always cook for us. When we did picnic's at the lake, or camping which we did a lot in the summer months, we'd eat hot dogs roasted over an open flame. Chili cheese dogs came later, and I didn't get to experience gourmet dogs until my adult years. 

Today we tried Great Links, and I was surprised at the different variations of hot dogs. If you want new experience try this place. I had the 
Chicago dog with fried zucchini sticks. My husband ordered the chili cheese fries with the New York hot dog. 

The bun became soggy with the liquid from the relish? And when I went to pick mine up, it kinda fell apart in my hand, and with each bite, the toppings fell off and the hot dog came through the bottom of the bun. We watched the guy make them, so we know they were not sitting for a while, but still yet, who likes a soggy bun? 

The flavors of the peppers, pickle, tomato, onions, and green relish worked well together, the hot dog itself had a little snap to it, so I assume it was close to the real thing, however, I would try a different dog next time. As for the sides, the zucchini sticks were plentiful and had good crisp to them, but the chili on the fries did seem canned. 

For a hot dog, this place was just okay. I'd try it again, just because of the variety on the menu. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was very relaxed.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,1,3,IGH3nBZ0MOaen-t48pDyGQ

Firstly this particular Great Links is not that big so it can fill up pretty fast. I like how you can sit on the bar stools and watch them prep your meal. Everyone is friendly that works here. They have some TVs up showing sports stuff. Today was nascar and they even were having some specials in celebration.

Now for what really matter the food! I try to stop by great links every time I drive by. Go for their hot dogs or sausages. My brother usually gets the burgers. Today I went for a Reuben and it was tasty! I love the rye bread they use and the cheese melted perfectly on the corned beef. As a side I got the natural cut fries.

So if you went to a fancy place you are paying for good food, but you are paying for the ""sizzle in the steak.""  You are paying for the atmosphere.

In a diner like this you are paying for good simple food done right.  No frills.

Even thought this place is not a fancy place - you are kinda paying to get a cool diner style low key joint with some good ol'fashioned diner style food.  This place does have an appeal.  A hominess.  It has a personality, and it is personable.  It is a happy place.  This really does add to the appeal.

The food.  Well, it was good.  The BLT had plenty of thick cut bacon.  The chili cheese fries were smothered and the cheese was melty.  The Italian beef had plenty of beef.  The Au Jus was good.  If you like good food off the grill... this is the place.  In the ""something different"" challenged northwest part of the valley this is a place worth a visit.

The only complaint was the Italian Beef bun was mushy... not wet... it was mushy.

It's a shame because the food it great, however I've never had such horrible service in my life! We generally always call our order in for pick-up because at lunch time this tiny space is always busy. Yesterday was no exception. We were told the food would be ready to be picked up in 10 to 15 minutes after placing our order. We walk into the shop 15 minutes after placing our order. Not a single employee, server nor cook even acknowledged our presence. After standing at the counter together for 10 minutes and having both servers come behind the counter and completely ignore us while pouring draft beers, we sat down seeing as they were quite busy. Mistake one was not welcoming customers, avoiding eye contact and essentially ignoring us. Another 10 minutes of trying to get someones attention an older gentleman came out from the back (owner?) started to ask us what we needed and then proceeded to cut off my answer as another couple walked in the door. He was much more concerned with this couple for some inexplicable reason. ""do you want to be seated/served outside, a place at the counter, wait for table?"" Wow, and this guy wouldn't even let me complete a sentence. Rude beyond belief. Mistake two was not letting your customer fishing speaking before cutting them off to address someone else.After another few minutes my boyfriend grabbed some cups so we could at least have a drink while waiting. Now more waiting, I get up to refill my tea and come back to see my boyfriend at the counter with one of the servers. Come to find out our food was bagged and sitting there THE. ENTIRE.TIME. Ice cold greasy slop in a bag. Then the server( LISA) had the nerve to act like it was our fault! Had a complete attitude as she grudgingly offered to have our food remade. After sitting there for 30+ minutes, no thanks, she then turns back to that older guy and almost whines about our unhappiness, that was the third mistake. We didn't even wait for him to say anything but walked out with our ice cold food. On arriving home and unwrapping it we found that they hadn't cut the sandwiches, did not put any napkins in the bag and neglected to give us the fry sauce we requested. I really believe we shouldn't have been charged for the food. At $26.13 for a lunch for two it's not exactly a cheap place.
