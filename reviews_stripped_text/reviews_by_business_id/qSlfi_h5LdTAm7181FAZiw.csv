The one person that seemed to be having a bad day was April. She was not very nice. But besides from that, it's a great option.",MEuoahMkqEgm4JRcxpQQIQ,0,0,4,bIImfOQ3OEMdvJVfGAiCtg

I'm not sure why they don't have a better rating but for me, 5 stars hands down",9kLNHTl6KFEAxRyG7OyVHA,1,0,5,PuWe2W4x6YG5Otn7dpV1ZQ
1576500,2016-08-08,0,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,"Disappointed  This little pizza joint has been a must eat in Las Vegas for about 15 years. It was our own little ""hidden gem"". We are here last about a year ago and it was great. Tonight? Not so much. The crust was extremely thin for hand tossed. I'm a thin crust girl, but LOVED their old hand tossed crust. This visit was not the same. The toppings were good, but overall, the pizza was very bland. I think we're going to have to find a new Las Vegas destination.",7-kaLtRa48Ors1yG8HVAkQ,0,0,3,nAaaovnAXHt1XtVk6y8c5w

This review is coming from a person who hasn't had a slice of pizza for almost three years; I don't really like pizza, but this one is good. Happy new year!",wN0c7pG9NTHYTolXLUo-iA,25,25,4,O69kIAn-QyeCQtMrL5dbXg
1872928,2018-05-27,0,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,"I visited this place three times during my stay in Vegas, and neither time did they disappoint. The food was out in a timely manner and always hot. Not only is their pizza delicious (and I'm very picky about my pizza and the way it tastes), but so are their medium (spicy) wings. The drinks are a little steep in price for such a small cup, but I guess the free refills make up for it. The atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly, and the tables are kept clean and available as often as possible. Would recommend eating here if you're staying in or around the Circus Circus hotel and are craving good pizza! They should have 5 stars. Maybe some of the bad reviews were posted a while back.",p1uYFaY9S9mctEFeVqof1A,0,0,5,oTm0TxR3DH6xkl3IBGxEFA
2112649,2013-09-29,1,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,"The only reason I gave this two stars... Is the fact it is open all night.

My husband and I arrived in Las Vegas much later than we intended (due to a dead battery!) so by the time we checked into Circus Circus we were famished. 

We were under the assumption Las Vegas was one of those 24/7 kind of towns and were shocked at how much was closed. 

We found the Pizzaria and were so relieved SOMETHING was open. The pleasure stops there. 

We ordered a 10 inch pesto pizza and it was awful. First off, the only thing pesto about it was the fact there were full pine nuts on it. Otherwise all I tasted was garlic. Everything garlic. Now I love garlic but not when it's the only flavor.

The crust wasn't too bad and tasted reasonably fresh (no frozen) but the toppings were a disaster. Take it from me, if its late... Find a McDonald's. This location was a disappointment.",h1VmuBcdVm3GBrHqyfRzQQ,5,2,2,pyFrRCoJ0bn2C1TeSE8ZKg

When my mum suggested we go gamble at circus circus I was hesitant, but when they suggest we just eat there I tried every to convince them to go else where... I clearly didn't achieve that and that's how we ended up here. THIS PLACE OS AMAZING. We just got the pizza and the price was fair. It's a good size pizza made to order its sooo yummy I seriously reccomend this to everyone.",vGENHlRRcobjqHzPwO0Z-A,0,0,5,zZs2df5hFgBRr_z2rdIoHw

We ordered this for room service and they messed up our whole order, but we were already so fed up with this hotel we took what we got and ate.....the food was ok....if you like chuck e. cheese pizza.

the salad was gross and we asked for ranch and got Italian.

My son and dad loved it....thats the only reason for 3 stars",z908ldotiE_K0-gJv0qk8Q,2,0,2,HVVLXU-x-ERN6j1DiBaLEg
4223960,2015-10-04,1,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,"Half supreme- half pepperoni. Thats all I ask for. Instead, I got 2 slices supreme and the rest pepperoni. What??? Is this a joke?  Apparently it was not. My buddies that I had to convince to come to this place made fun of me all night.  This is horrible, suicide? Maybe came across my mind at least twice. I never thought a pizza was going to ruin my night. It did, and this place will have the worst of my wishes. Yea, I wish you're oven breaks down and you can make no more pizza!!!!!!",ls74ppkL8pdOB_HOjtoChw,0,0,1,PZmkXTjBQ1mMw_amQYY0Mg
4774250,2015-01-30,0,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,"My complain is for  the sandwich . the pizza was good , lots of toppings and crust wasn't to thin or dry. Only reason I give this place a 2 is for the pizza. Now the sandwich was bad. It was suppose to be the"" big top Sandwich "", which describes it to be like the an Italian sandwich . when I didn't bother to check it until I got to my room ,  the sandwich was so plain , had ham , pepperoni , salami and shredded mozzarella  cheese with tomatoes chopped on top and that's it. No mayo no mustard no lettuce. I figured if they offered it cold u can at least warn the person its suppose to I guess be hot since the cheese is shredded not sliced. This is the worst sandwich ever. They suppose to give u a side of pasta salad. Which is just a little container where places use to put sauce in it . super little amount. It really sicked cuz it was 10 and I had no choice but just eat the meat . the bread also had a bad taste,between old and moldy . terrible sandwich, I ate the meat and cheese but clearly these were pizza toppings rather then slices . next time I'll stick to pizza if I must :(",hI7qDFxBZ-sYPBSeyniSjA,0,0,2,dG_p-zb4pQyiehU47D4Fjg

Large portions. 
Free refills. 
Good taste.
Nice variety. 
On the casino floor so don't have to go far to play after you eat. They offer to-go as well so that's cool! We will eat here again. We got in late tonight after long day at Grand Canyon and driving so was tired. This place was quick and easy so worked out.",F_W8naiZWW3wb3If4w4Kuw,0,0,3,8iLfYbTG4MqBcJy2XwSZ0A
5554110,2015-07-30,0,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,"Well, I had two stars but just changed it to one after they gave me one to-go box that clearly would not fit all my food in it.  The food is decent proportions and not great, but not disgusting.  Service was so bad! So bad. And they were cleaning the tables with dirty rags or so it smelled.  The whole place smelled like a wet rag that gets crumpled in a corner and starts to stink. But I guess that's what you get at Circus Circus.",SM2Z-BDWSO821pbBNleNoA,0,0,1,CRFkC7x18HZOQuMSCA-kvg
5778537,2014-02-09,0,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,"The BBQ chicken tasted a little too much like BBQ chicken and had me forget that I was eating a pizza. It was DRENCHED in BBQ sauce and had me regretting that me and my boyfriend ordered it. I had already ordered mild chicken wings as a appetizer and was actually wanting a pizza =(

Let me add that another couple was sitting near us and asked how the BBQ chicken pizza was and we had to tell the truth - ""order something else"".

They have a soda fountain available so you don't have to wait for your server to refill your drink for you. I guess it can be a hassle to get up to refill your drink though when it needs to be refilled so I guess it's all about how you look at it.

Our server though was skimpy on the napkins and ranch. My boyfriend asked for more ranch and she gave us just ONE MORE PACKET. I guess I'm just use to being given several servings of ranch, but that's just me.

The only good thing I can deduct from this place is that it is open 24 hours. That didn't really have an effect on me since I live in Las Vegas, but I guess it would be more convenient to anyone staying at Circus Circus wanting to get a late night bite.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,1,0,3,OGGt-XLlprQuGXPjsFmKWg
5897587,2015-07-04,0,qSlfi_h5LdTAm7181FAZiw,It took an hour from the time that we ordered until we got our pizza they put our pizza we ordered for dine in in a to go box and let it sit on the counter until we asked what was taking so long and then they went on a hunt for it and once they found that it had been sitting on the counter getting cold they rewarmed the same pizza in the oven and served it to us and when the manager brought it to us he just put it on our table and said there is your pizza no apology what so ever and once our server came back then we asked to speak to the manager again and he came back and after we complained he then said he was sorry and he couldn't do anything but say sorry for it and he tried to lie to us and back pedal and was totally dishonest on what happened until we confronted him about what we already knew and even then he had an attitude where you could tell he could care less about their poor service and very poor management skills,aQq6qcrmq8OEC-n1yHtYmw,1,0,1,dG3FG2aQW0BmWRM-K8WTcg
