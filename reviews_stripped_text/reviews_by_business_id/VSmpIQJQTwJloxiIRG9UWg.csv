The employees had League of Legends gameplay streaming on their flat screen, which is more interesting to me than sports. My sister and I ordered their potstickers, chicken teriyaki, and chicken pad thai. Everything was really good and pretty cheap. Both of the entrees were only $7.45 and the potstickers were only about $4. I would definitely come here agin!",V0iOiQuuYlj49YeIJPCYlQ,1,1,5,338kuBubmMsl5PoRpvZlfg
361730,2015-12-29,1,VSmpIQJQTwJloxiIRG9UWg,"Not a place for Authentic Thai Food aficionados. Due to its location, the place gets allot of non Asians who need to have the flavors adjusted towards the bland side, which is entirely understandable. An analogous comparison can be made with real Chinese food and Panda Express. I like Panda's orange chicken, but I don't think I'm eating real Chinese food while I'm eating it. This place is similar. I would recommend coming here for some tasty food that is cheap (I had the spicy drunken noodles with chicken lunch special for $6.95). I would return if I'm in the area and in need of a tasty reasonably priced lunch.",KqbowpYkOxkpFNuEd-rTnw,0,1,3,xukBJx0O6Cr_HXK7lCsjWg

Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is bc my chicken pad Thai tasted sour & smelled like my dogs breath, which doesn't smell great. I couldn't eat it. The smell was too overwhelming & it tasted off.

1865244,2015-11-30,6,VSmpIQJQTwJloxiIRG9UWg,"I don't understand why this spot has a separate business listing: there is one counter inside of Jackie Bee Boba Tea. I guess the signage implies that the food and the tea are provided by separate businesses, but it's one space with one counter and staff provide service for both menus. Shrug.

The location is across the street from a community college and next door to a computer gaming store, which helps to understand the target audience. I would compare the food quality to a step above a food court, with more variety than that description suggests. I've grabbed a few apps here and a $7 lunch combo before- it's Chinese/Thai fast food, with dishes like pad thai and orange chicken, and sides/apps like spam musubi, spring rolls, egg rolls, and of course, the boba.

Service is quick and generally friendly. The shared dining area is clean with new furniture and games available. The parking lot is very small, so you may want to utilize the adjacent Dennys lot and walk over.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,10,3,vrY59_WI7Hwt3EKUEig94g

Came this way for some lunch around the boyfriend's job, and decided on Thai Bistro. Now, I was confused when we went in because there were two names ""Thai Bistro,"" and ""Jackie Bee!"" I guess Jackie Bee is a smoothie/Boba tea place, either way they are combined into Thai Bistro. 

After my confusion, I looked through the menu and ordered the shrimp egg rolls, and Tom Yum Vegetable Soup! It was the bomb.com! Everything was tasty; the soup wasn't as spicy but still flavorful. The Shrimp Egg Rolls were not what I expected but still delish, I thought they would have cabbage in them, but either way I was satisfied.

Well after waiting 30min and noticed everyone that ordered after me was getting Their orders before I started to question It. I went to the cashier guy and asked him why is It taking So long?

The food is top notch quality - I just ate at Lotus of Siam (one of the highest rated Thai restaurants in town) and this place is giving them a run for their money. Especially being less than half the price over all.

A few positive notes - The flavor was ok, quantity of vegetables & meat were generous. Waiter & Staff were very kind. Have tried many thai curries  in Vegas & never seen this. Soybean is the cheapest & worst oil to use in cooking. Oily Curry?  Really? The price was cheaper than others but the huge amount of oil used was very excessive. - Caused stomach upset same day & next day!  If your looking for good curry this is NOT the place.

I came in yesterday shortly after 5:00pm. I placed an order for take out, took a seat with my number, and waited in the not busy restaurant. I watched as a few people came in after me, placed their orders, received their food and left. 40 minutes later, I finally went back up to the counter and told them I just needed a refund as I couldn't wait any longer at this point. The man at the counter looked at my receipt and seemed surprised that I hadn't received my food yet (I had ordered 2 vegetarian dishes). After grabbing someone else, they explained that they couldn't refund my credit card (or refund me in any way) because they didn't have a manager present. After a little debate, they finally just gave me my money back in cash.

5308885,2016-09-01,0,VSmpIQJQTwJloxiIRG9UWg,"Decided to stop in here with my brother for lunch. They had a very small lunch menu with only 4 items priced at 6.95. I ordered the pad see ew and my brother ordered the green curry chicken. You can upgrade your drink to a boba tea for only $1.00 or $1.50 more depending on the size. The lunch specials didn't include anything except I received one egg roll.

 The food was very underwhelming for a Thai restaurant. The pad see we was meh. It didn't have much flavor and the chicken was cut way too large for this dish. I have ate this dish at several other establishments in town and this probably ranked the lowest out of all of them. I didn't even finish it. The egg roll was soggy and full of oil. I had to ask for a sauce for it because they don't automatically give you any dipping sauce.

The green chicken curry was decent but the curry was a little on the watery side. There were more vegetables then chicken it it. The portions are not as big as other places. For the lunch special price being closer to a higher end most places at least give you soup or salad and sometimes a drink. 

The service was good. They were friendly and smiled. But at the end of the day, the food was generic and I could have probably bought a prefrozen package in the grocery store and had the same meal for less.

I wouldn't recommend and I wouldn't go back",05ieIRXQSYfgRwnU6F6nlA,0,0,2,QZ87CrTvAhAYallHwWsBkg

We were told that the lunch specials change on a weekly basis which is different. The portions were really big. We choose to share crunchy lemon chicken, stands dumplings, and two of their lunch specials which I forget what they were, but the portions were so big that we had a lot of left overs. My favorite was the rice dish. Also, this place is connected with a jobs place so if you order an entree you can add Thai tea for $1 which we all got one of our own.
