This is a food truck place and they do breakfast and bruch on their menu. You can see it because the food truck is white and it's easy to spot.,gH3B42lDH_lkwQfkZB7U4A,0,2,4,j589AZTOE-yGQ-bDrNILAQ

We got to try the chilequiles and avocado toast, and the Greek Yogurt with a homemade cookie and macaroons, all incredibly flavorful and well-plated with delicious, quality ingredients.  
Hopefully John will have his own restaurant soon because these are the kinds of menus that Las Vegas needs to keep coming up locally, especially in the Spring Valley and Summerlin areas.   Thank you StageLV for the hard work and clear passion put into your cooking.  We'll be back soon to try the egg shooters with bacon jam, foie gras benedict(for real), and honestly the entirety of that fantastic-looking line up!",1F1XNhI6XtHrfNb3hO3tNg,1,2,5,TfvpcwDzdzFX2_KcobNTwA

All beef patty, bacon, sauce, etc came with sweet potato chips, my kids had the pancake trio and french toast and they enjoyed them. Will try the softshell crab dish on my next visit, the kids are already asking for more french toast. Check Stage out",wU2hWI3PFXeI3t6-Amhjsw,0,0,5,rqDurVI_pd_QC01qduwBcQ

For a food truck they set the bar high and serve 5 star quality resort style food. Despite the burger, they provide wooden utensils and wooden containers. They are quite new but I can't wait what else they have in store because I'm definitely coming back.",AnHaeFNG7effRI5qxE5BRQ,1,2,5,v8BHsGPpHif5dyNUlStzDw
