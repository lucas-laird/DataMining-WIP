When I walked in to the restaurant, I was quickly transported back to my childhood when I visited my abuela's house. It smelled like her house and was decorated just as gaudily with knick-knacks and other various decor. Right away I could sense some authenticity.

Food was great! It did take longer than I am used to, however I do believe Cuban food that is prepared properly will inevitably take time. The waitress happily substituted the fries that came with my meal for the platanos. When I got my meal, it looked as though I was given a whole banana. Everything was cooked properly and seasoned well.

The service was good. The waitress was attentive enough. If we needed her, she was there. She was pleasant. No complaints here.

My girl ordered shrimp cocktail and the papano fajita platter (I think that was the name).  I was going to order the chimichanga dinner but the lady told us we were getting too much food so I canceled the chimi and sure enough, the shrimp cocktail and cuban fajita platter were plenty for two.  Really, really tasty.  The service wasn't great but the food and price more than made up for it.

We went twice.  On the second visit, I finally did get the chimichanga and it was perfect.  We also tried their ""old laundry"" Cuban soup (ropa vieja) which was awesome, and fried platains which were great.

The decor was a little loud for my taste, and the same Selena dvd was played three times while we were there, which got old real fast. It's also not in the best part of town, but hey, it happens. 

The food was good, I'll give them that. I ordered the ropa vieja, and enjoyed it, or would have if they'd gotten the order right. It states quite clearly on the menu that ropa vieja comes with papas fritas (french fries). My plate came with white steamed rice and a bowl of beans. When I asked the waitress politely about my fries, she told me (rudely) that my meal did not come with fries. I protested, saying it was on the menu, and she told me outright that I was wrong, and walked away. I had no menus handy or I would have showed her. Half the reason I ordered what I did was because I was craving some french fries. I don't think I've ever been told flat out that I was WRONG at a restaurant before. Not only that, but we ordered ONE pitcher of margaritas, but she brought out another over the course of the meal, which we did not drink or order. These margaritas were awful. I don't think they used real tequila. No one at our table finished a glass. Then we were told we were being charged $24 a pitcher, when we hadn't even touched the other pitcher. Um. No. 

Not only that, but we had a rather large party. I understand that this can be difficult for small restaurants. However, when we arrived, there was only one other table occupied. But people who came in after us starting receiving their food before a quarter of the people at our table received their meals. Come on! You don't serve the new orders before you've gotten the first table done! 

Other people at my table got the wrong food, too. My father-in-law can't eat cheese, and so he specifically requested NO CHEESE in the enchiladas or on the beans. He received cheese on both and had to send it back. 

The service here was AWFUL. The waitress was surly and never available except when she brought a plate of food out (which was once every ten minutes). I absolutely DO NOT recommend this place, especially if you have a group of people over four. Too bad, cause the food is good.",4u9rXg2DrN6Zq4bNHXzKVg,0,0,1,evctdWKs21ZrEKGoEjt2fA

Hoping their Cuban selections wouldn't disappoint, I ordered the Cuban-style vegetable fajitas. It is very hard to screw up veggie fajitas, but the frozen vegetable medley was mushy and lacked any pizzazz. The rice and black beans were OK, and the greasy Cuban garlic bread was good, pretty standard.

2653624,2007-12-08,5,GXdnO7m8X4tjVl7MXHgN4g,"Everyone has been raving about this place, and we couldn't wait to try it. Located off off the strip on Fremont Street across the street from the El Cortez Hotel, (We parked there!) we were surprised to find it relatively empty at 9pm. (It was a FREEZING night!) 

For this one, I'm going to go with listing the Pluses and Minuses: 

(+)
+ Easy Parking, across the street at the El Cortez
+ Roomy, good for groups
+ Cheeeep eats! Huge portions! 

(-) 
- What was the *DEAL* with them BLASTING the Eagles DVD and then after that the BRITNEY DVD on HIGH VOLUME at 9:30PM on a Monday night? I was running low on energy at that point in the evening and the volume was reaaaaaaly too high for me, cranky ol' lady. I hear they usually play salsa music, which is would have much preferred (not hatin' on the Eagles, actually.) 
- It was Freeeeezing in there- we sat near the window, perhaps that was why? Bring a sweater if you're coming here for dinner in winter-time. 
- The meals arrived ~20 minutes after we sat down, which is fine, but the plates were SUPER COLD to the touch... for those of you who know how much I love my food PIPING DANGEROUSLY HOT, this was a minus for me. 

Overall: a solid 3.75 stars, as the food was tasty tasty and it's a great deal on some Quality food. Service was friendly, and they let us sit around a few minutes after they closed, as we were just engaged in catching up.",hN2yDV75um9F1LiJnkvWJQ,7,5,4,kPqd5SEqMkAwH3Mra4Nm_w
2714030,2008-08-21,2,GXdnO7m8X4tjVl7MXHgN4g,"This was by far one of the worst Vegas restaurant experiences that I have had.  My husband and I are addicted to Mexican/Cuban food, and we finally decided to give this dirty lookin little place a try.  There were 2 bums laying on the sidewalk outside the resturant.  There were a group of mexican guys sitting in the corner with buckets of beer in front of each of them- they were watching some Mexican soccer game... a disco ball in the front window ... so far so good, lol.

We got two Negro Medolo's, a steak burrito, and a CHICKEN enchilada ala carte.  The menu said ""add an enchilada to a combo for $1.95""  the server told us that it was no longer the special, it was now 2.95 to add an enchilada.  We told her that was fine.  I can't eat a whole lot when I'm having a beer ;)  

The food didn't take too long... after she drops it off, we don't see her again till the ""bill"" comes... 

The burrito was actually really good... huge portions too.  The ""chicken"" enchilada turned out to be a cheese enchilada... so I didn't eat that.  No biggie... except the server was gone for 20 minutes.  We started to think she went home or something...  

After we set our plates to the side, the other girl working finally came over to take the plates.   We told her, that we got the wrong enchilada, no biggie, and we don't want another one.  At that point, our food and beer had settled and theres no way i could eat anymore.  She said she would tell our server...

So, our server finally comes back over with a tablet she had written our checks on (apparently, she never shows us a check) and tells us that will be $30.

LOL.  What?   $30 dollars for one burrito and two beers?  The burrito itself, was 9.95.  She continues to go over her calculations, $5.75 for the beers, $3.50 for the enchilada [[[stop!  first, we got an enchilada we didn't order - and sent it back... but do you remember she told us the enchilada was now 2.95?  She's making these prices up as she goes, i beleive]]]

We told her we got the wrong enchilada... she says ""i dunno, you eat it""  Uh.... no, we told her we didn't, we sent it back... (which she would have known if she had been back to the table even once after the food had arrived)  She stomps away, to ask the other girl ... our server stomps off to the kitchen and we see her arguing with some guy in the kitchen.   She walks back over and says ""okay, now 27 dollar""


We were so disturbed by the arguing and extremely rude service, we just wanted to leave, and didn't think about how that added up, we just gave her money and left.   If i had been paying, i would have stiffed her.  I've never in my life stiffed a server.  I worked in restaurants for 7 years, husband was a bartender for 4+yrs, we tip VERY WELL!!  

After we got back to Freemont i start thinking.  So... 9.95 for the burrito, and - 17 dollars for the two negro medelos?!?  what ?!  

Husband seems to remember her saying the beers were 5.75 a peice.  Thats 11.50... 11.50+9.95=  $22.95

So that means all the porn slappers sitting in the corner had 40 dollar bucks of beer sitting in front of each of them?  I'm sure.  Did she think we were drunk and wouldn't realize we were getting ripped off?  

Since we never got a check, and she seemed to keep changing her prices every time she came back to the table, I'm sure she pocketed a good bit of our payment.  Whata fuckin shame, I really liked the burrito.  I would NEVER step foot in this place again.  I can't imagine making your customers feel so uncomfortable.. 

If you still need to go here, check the menu for the prices, and ask for a check at the end...  Maybe she added a 5 dollar plate share fee??  that would be a high plate share fee - especially for a dirty little mexican place in the ghetto!!  Even so, I wasn't planning on eating the damn burrito- I ordered ONE enchilada, (i don't eat much at night, and theres no point in ordering food that I won't eat!) Either way, its poor buisness practice... 

 I've never felt the need to call a restaurant's manager, until this experience... but i figured what would the point be?  I don't think any of them spoke english.... and if they did, would they even care?  They don't care that they employ a theif... geez.. I was trying to not bring in a stereotype, but damn... :-x

When you walk into this dump it's like Vegas and Mexico threw up on each other or something like that, it's very interesting to say the least. 
It's right across the street from El Cortez hotel, so that alone should give you a clue of what kind of place this is going to be lol. 

I noticed this place because I was outside on the curb of El Cortez waiting in line for my Punk Rock Bowling tickets in 90 degrees at 11am, drinking some hot Jack n coke in a plastic cup. My friend and I were debating whether to eat here or the cafe, and ended up here. I think at this point I would eaten anything lol. 

Since I was in Vegas I started off with a strawberry margarita, because well, I really love margaritas. Also, it is completely acceptable to keep drinking all day, even before noon in Vegas, so why the hell not. I then ordered a chicken taco and enchilada combo plate with rice and beans. It was probably not the best Mexican food, but it really hit the spot and plus they gave me a decent amount of sour cream, so I devoured that plate, lol. 

My friend ordered a Cuban sandwich and beer, but they were out of Cuban beer, so fail right there. Also, his sandwich came on some questionable bread, so yea overall fail on the Cuban menu. The bread in the picture looked way better. Overall, my food was pretty good, but my friend's not so good. 

The service was also pretty terrible, they take forever to take your order, get your order, and if you need anything else after your meal finally arrives, forget about it!!!! They weren't even that busy until maybe the end our meal. This place is cheap and convenient though if you happen to be in Downtown Vegas.

3674992,2007-08-22,14,GXdnO7m8X4tjVl7MXHgN4g,"Once in a while, miracles happen to me. It's often while I'm traveling, which is probably because (a) you're in a more desperate, survivalist state when you don't have your bearings and therefore unexpected discoveries seem more miraculous, and (b) when I travel I visit almost exclusively the historic downtown core of any place, which is usually where everything magical resides. 

Now, I may be the only person in the world who travels to Las Vegas to visit the historic downtown core, but this is who I am and you're just going to have to learn to deal with it. Also, fuck the Strip. It's the same shitty middleamerican crowd, it's just more expensive and larger scale, which are shitty middleamerican things anyway.

Back to the historic downtown core thing, they appear to be doing some civic redevelopment stuff in the ""East Fremont Street"" area. So when LB and I were traipsing around in the 105 degree heat admiring historic neon signs and abandoned wedding chapels, and we noticed a big sign across from the El Cortez for ""MEX/CUBAN FOOD"", I knew immediately that a travel miracle was upon us. And it was. 

First of all, it is the cutest fucking place you have ever seen. From the neon signage to the bright pink and gold chairs and pleather booths to the waitresses' dresses, it makes you want to kill yourself for ever having eaten at a crappy Chevy's. It's the real deal. It also has a giant big screen TV upon which we witnessed the following: latin music videos on ""htv"" (hispanic tv? anyway, h-urbano was our favorite channel), music videos featuring booty shaking ladies and armadillos, and - this is for real - a DVD concert series of recent performances by KC & the Sunshine Band, Wild Cherry, and the Trammps. Now, if you know me, you know that disco music is the way to my heart. So Mamacita's, you had me at Play That Funky Music Whiteboy. But I'm not sure you had the large Mexican family eating at pushed-together tables, because they were not stoked when you turned off the Urbano. Also, I should add that the sound system is first rate, and I think at night it turns into a dance club. Sweet.

So, we also learned, ""Mex/Cuban"" does not mean a mishmosh of two cuisines. Apparently the owner (?) is Mexican, and her husband is Cuban, which means they have two distinct menus, one for each cuisine. Which results in more delicious choices for you, the customer. I would recommend ordering everything under ""side orders"" and a Cuban Sandwich. That's what I did. You may want to play it more on the healthy side and order the vegetarian fajitas, or the avocado salad. I know this because I ate those, too. Also, make sure to get the yuca. It comes two ways: fried, and in an oily roasted garlic sauce. I mean, you might as well get both of those, too. I'm not going to lie and say we didn't.  You can also get an entire roasted tilapia, if that's your thing. We actually didn't order that. 

Anyway, the point is that the food in Vegas is so generally shitty that when you're ready for a meal that doesn't involve processed lunch meat or $0.99 shrimp cocktail, Mamacita's is there for you, so be ready to EAT.

Also, the ladies serving you are pretty much the nicest people I've ever met, so if you are one of those assholes that is rude to cab drivers and waitstaff, please don't go in here because I will be forced to break knees.

The customer base is eclectic. A nice mix of latin families, oddly misplaced white people and the local street characters, of which there seem to be many on this part of East Fremont. On the walk back to the hotel I was asked if my ethnic heritage includes Russian by a dude smoking a doob in plain sight, and I'm pretty sure I saw Aileen Wuornos order a burrito.

I ordered a side of plantains that was enough for the whole table to share and they came with sour cream, my favorite. other people in my party ordered Mexican fare and truly enjoyed it. portions were large and reasonably priced.
The salsa and tortilla cheaps were outstanding.
Everyone agreed that this was quite possibly the best meal for the best price  in Vegas.

For those of you who know me, or at least have come to be more familiar with me as the years and reviews have wore on, you know that I greatly dislike giving one star reviews.  In my opinion, there must be some seriously egregious offense that warrants a one-star review -- typically something that extends beyond the food, beyond the service, beyond the ambience, to turn your back on any establishment.  My friends, Mamacita's aka Mamita's aka DO NOT COME HERE FOR ANY REASON, has done just that -- and definitely threatened to take a weekend's awesomeness and rough it up into a little bitch.

The tenets of good service are very plain and simple: take care of your customers.  It is more important to do this AFTER your people get their food.  Apparently Mamacita's did not get this memo.  Once you realize how badly you've been duped into hoping that you could get someone's attention after you receive your food, take a look around the restaurant.  You'll notice the same thing -- anyone who doesn't yet have their orders is being intensely doted upon, while anyone else is being virtually ignored.

We received chips and drinks almost immediately, and put in our orders for Cuban plates and appetizers -- I got a margarita, Bestie got a Coke, and we opted for plantains, croquetas, tequila chicken and fried pork platters.  Unfortunately I did not read the Yelp reviews prior to coming here -- we were just so damned excited that it was walking distance from the hotel -- so here we were.

We got our food and drinks and that was it.

I had planned to order another margarita but that desire quickly faded once I had to get up and get refills on our Coke and water myself.

I went to another table for their Tapatio bottle since they were done, sitting around and waiting for their check that never came.

Another Yelper had said she requested garlic sauce on the side because the dish was too dry?  I never got that far.

We got our plantains (which I think everyone gets anyway) and no croquetas.  No chance to ask about them either until the end.

There was a large party in at the same time we were and you could see their frustration mounting also (along with everyone else in the place).

The thing is, their food is decent.  Bestie liked her tequila chicken sauce, and granted my pork pieces were dry, they were still nicely cooked and recovered with a bit of salt and hot sauce.  Plantains were slightly too oily but still fried well, and my drink was not half bad.  My black beans were a bit underseasoned, but the soft bread that went with it was divine.

But when you simply ignore your patrons after they get their food (or at least most of it), it only goes downhill from there.  I kept looking back at their service stations and I just could NOT figure out where they kept going!

Just don't bother coming here.  I know for a fact that just down the street going back toward the Strip there are far better Mexican, Cuban, and just general food-serving establishments that deserve your business more than Mamita's does!  Playing old school Mexican or Michael Jackson songs at the top of the place's lungs doesn't compensate either.",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,4,2,1,YB-Gte7aO5j3NolHjz6-Mw

I walk in and the place is decorated with everything Vegas and Mexico. From Elvis, shot glasses to Chiuauas, etc. 

I had a side order of their chile relleno. Meh... Nothing special. It wasn't bad but I'd had WAY better at my Mexican friend's house when she makes it herself.

The highlight of the night was the huge flat screen that was playing old school R&B music videos. As a big fans of eras past, we decided to stick around a little longer just to watch the vids.

Would we return? No, not really. But if we were in the area and were craving the cuisine, we'd stop in.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,2,1,3,lqVruGSZwynQvUEq0WeQpA

But as is my luck with any Tony Hsieh supported business I had another bad experience as LeThai was closed. So I head back to the parking garage at the El Cortez hungry and wondering what to do. I step out of the elevator and see Mamacita's. Or is it Mamita's? Heck if I know, it's Mexican food, my second most favorite thing except pizza. I punch the down button, a couple steps through the casino and across Fremont has me inside waiting on someone to help me. 

Mamacita's is s-l-o-w. Like the polar ice caps will be melted by the time they get to you slow. I grabbed a seat and waited to get a menu. I waited to get salsa, which by the way they brought chips and a medium and a hot salsa, both of which were good. I waited to finally get someone to take my order. Meanwhile I'm sitting there facing Fremont St. watching ESPN on the flat screen on the wall and waiting some more. Finally I get my lunch special, a taco, enchilada, rice, and beans. They used regular beans, not dehydrated beans which was a surprise of sorts. The taco was crispy but had me relying heavily on the salsa to make it good. And everything else was just ho-hum. 

I also ordered ice tea, which was good but they brought out the sugar tray and all it had in it was artificial sweetners. I'm sorry but I only do real sugar when I'm out, or Xyla at home, I won't use anything else. So not having real sugar on the table was something I didn't like. 

I got a phone call so I had to leave and it took forever to get someone's attention and to get my check. I tried to hand my server my debit card but she ignored it, went up and printed my ticket then came back and got it. Seriously, I needed to go at that point, when I tell you to just run the damn card, run the damn card. 

If I was on Fremont Street and hungry I might come back here again. But if you're on a tight lunch hour this is NOT a place you even want to consider. They take slow to a whole other place and it's not good. Also decor wise it's kinda cool but the 80's music and other crap gets old very quickly.

i went to freemont street a couple of days ahead, but i didnt see the canopy of lights, so i went back.

well, on first impression, the place looks very authentic. but the weird smell (i have super smelling powers) kinda turned me off. two girls walked in and i asked them if they ever ate there - they said no but it was highly recommended by the robocop (he was a cop on a segway.)

the service was a bit slow  - but there was only one waitress, and i dont really blame her. the food was good. it didnt taste americanized to me, but thats my opinion. its almost close to what i have back in queens, NY.

the food here is a welcome and homey change to the food they serve at the strip by the venetian. aaaah. it felt like home. the porkchops were good.

I ordered the #5 combo, a Chile Relleno so delicious that I couldn't stop raving about the flavor in between each bite. Also included was a fried carnitas taco that was fatty & flavorful - a great combination at $10.95. 

What also set this place apart was the large LCD TV playing a video of Elvis Presley bringing down the house. Great DVD, great sound! On my second visit alone, I ordered the same dinner, plus two ice cold Coronas, while watching a DVD of the greats from the disco era.

Probably the only reason that I would stay at the El Cortez Hotel again is that the hotel is so perfectly situated to this little restaurant - check it out!",BlKCEQcc03mNdLA1pVG-XQ,10,9,4,fgZ7Nn5BmDN3tNHJISFi2Q

The service really leaves something to be desired, I think we confused the server by ordering appetizers because our entrees came out before our appetizers.  When we asked about them she seemed really confused that we actually wanted to have them before our meals.  When our meals finally arrived, my friend got her meal plus they put the appetizer in front of her but I did not get my meal.  So we just ate the appetizers.  I finally got my meal after inquiry. Also, the waitresses are quite surly.

The food leaves something to be desired as well.  The bread for the cuban sandwich was very dry and very flaky.  Very peculiar and hard to eat.

Overpriced and it is a hassle to use their bathroom.  You have to ask for a key and then walk down a sketchy outside hallway in the back of the restaurant.  My advice:  Try to hold it until the El Cortez across the street.",qba1JQlp5a6kEwRRTGxdkg,2,0,2,BzQHKVGGeKSPK8SdWssqiA

I googled Mexican eateries downtown and Mamacita's popped up. Of course I Yelped it and the reviews were generaly positive so we decided to go. It was a short walm from our hotel downtown. Even tough Mamacita's is close to the heart of Freemont St., Mamacita's is in a neighborhood filled with panhandlers. Even whe. We arrived at Mamacita's, there was a guy sleelping in a booth which the waitress called security on. I guess she had warned him about sleeping but he didn't heed her advice. However, security arrived quickly and whisked the sleepy guy away. 
The fresh salsa at Mamacita's is delicious. It has a wonderful flavor and is just the right amount of hot. They have a large menu filled with many Mexican as well as Cuban selections. The tortillas were cold and hard, but I enjoyed my meal anyway. Besides that, I was surprised by the lack of good Mexican eateries in Las Vegas.  Living in San Diego they are a dime a dozen. I guess I'm spoiled. But if you're in Vegas, hungry for Mexican (or Cuban) food, and  have a sense of adventure, Mamacita's might be the place for you!",J18ol0RI1TuyqGKFZJfh3w,0,0,4,wxVQa8wCJLpPX3TPpfx3VQ
5848456,2011-07-10,6,GXdnO7m8X4tjVl7MXHgN4g,"My friend Karen had seen this restaurant and had made mental note that she wanted to give it a shot. 

We decided this is where we would do dinner last night, before hitting up the Western for $1 shots and beers and then to Dino's for Karaoke. 

Wow where do I start? 

Waited about 15 minutes until we were finally approached for a drink order, let alone questions regarding the menu. I had never had Cuban food at a restaurant so I was a bit clueless on what certain things were. 

I asked the waitress what the house specialty is or what is ordered the most and or popular, she then points out a few things on the menu and says this is OK, um that is OK. Well you know what lady, I am looking for more than just ""OK"". 

Crappy service for starters, after finally coming to take our order it took another 15 minutes or so to get our drinks. The food took forever, and only two of four meals were brought. So I am sitting waiting until my friends food comes so I can eat. I said screw it, my fajitas are getting cold waiting so I dug in! 

After the non helpful suggestions from the waitress, I decided to play it safe and ordered the beef and chicken fajitas which came with a side plate of rice and beans. The fajitas were a large portion of dry unseasoned chicken and beef. Not much flavor at all to speak of. I have had better fajitas at El Torito's. Disappointment for me as even the rice and beans were bland, very bland! 

Friend #1 ordered a bowl of menudo, she said the flavor was not the best and she is an old school menudo eater. She asked the waitress prior if it their menudo had a red or white base, the waitress pulled the menu and pointed to the picture and said that is what it looks like. Also her plate was a sloppy mess when it arrived, menudo juice all over the plate and running down the side of the bowl, the presentation was just bad. I know they were rushing to get orders out but there is just no excuse for that slop to be dropped at anyone's table. I attached a picture, check it out.

Friend #2 got the Tequila pollo dish with a side order of chile releno. The chicken was one big slab on the plate, would have made a better eater friendly and a visually appealing meal had they sliced it. The portion was generous but did not matter as the taste once again was bland as the other dishes we tried. 

Friend #3 got some sort of beef dish that was nothing but grizzle, all she was able to eat was the white rice and the black beans she spit up. Literally had a plate of wasted meat left. She probably should have sent it back as was basically inedible. The service was slow, and not very friendly, did not seem like a good outcome if a complaint was issued, I think that is the vibe we felt. Still I would have issued my complaint as they can not improve something if they are not aware or getting the complaint. 

Service and food very disappointing. 

The tab was $80.00 for four of us for bad service and plain, unflavored food. We will NOT be back. 

Also the flat screen TV blasting the Michael Jackson videos, over and over and over and over and over was overkill. We could not hear each other so we had very little conversation between the four of us. 

A hilarious moment, the waitress walked past our table and because the music video was soooooo freakin loud the waitress did not even hear my friend calling her! We just wanted to ask if they could turn it down. Several other patrons were talking about it as well. Ok they were not talking about it as I could not hear anyone, I mean I was lip reading along with watching people point to their ears so I am assuming they were thinking the same as we were that the music was way too loud. Don't get me wrong...music is my life but when I dine I am not really down for a taped concert at the same time. It was ridiculous how loud it was.

This place sucks balls...and not the good kind! 

This place just gave reason for a bitch fest that night from my friends, and they are not even Yelpers! I never want to endure that again!

They should also train their employees on cuban food, not cool for a specialty restaurant to have staff that is clueless in regards to the menu.

Service sucks
