Not too many people inside which was nice for a Friday night, we were able to get 2 machines next to each other. The inside was nice and had a good feel too it. I would live to try the food but I don't think I'll be coming back. The bartender gave us no attention at all. I waited almost 15 minutes to get my second beer, And I was playing too! Once we decided to cash out we were still charged for all of our drinks (2 beers and 1 cocktail) we both were playing too. We also noticed another couple come in and sit at a table and nobody walked up and helped them at all for at least 10-15 minutes. Pretty much the service here is horrible. I'm a bartender and my wife is a waitress so I understand how it is sometimes but when it's not busy there is no reason why anyone should be waiting for a beer especially when we are there to spend money",xCmoFHyhcYeKxiUz6w1lWQ,0,0,1,vvaXFW4cDGSMRQqUCufK0Q

But they still charge us for our drinks.  When we discussed this with the manger, Stephanie. She changed the story multiples time with excuses of why we where being charged, including she couldn't see our play. She reluctantly agreed to take one beer off and when she came back with our check it was still on there.  Stephanie's policy is clearly that the customer is always wrong.

This place was the spot my friend and I usually go to. Service is pretty good. So I took my mom here.  We walked in. No one greeted us. So we chose a table.  Sat there for ten minutes... NOTHING.  I finally walked up to the bartender, and asked if the area we sat at was open. This douche bag then replies with.. "" uh no, there's no server and handed me two menus"" ... If that was the case, he should have said, hey ladies that area is closed.   If I didn't walk up to him and asked him, we would have just sat there..  So thank you Douchebag for ruining our visit.

I initially questioned if a sports Bar really deserved a 5 star rating, I mean it's not a gourmet restaurant or anything but... It kinda is!

Everything was unbelievably yummy down to the cole slaw on the chicken wings plate. The pizza was fantastic!

3391217,2018-05-07,1,Xy8R4AnLP3LxwFIYoPfhJg,"Recently brought a home close by and have been looking for a local sport bar for a favorite go to spot. I've been driving by this PT's Ranch for for a few months, finally stop in. This bar is very nice and unassuming, when first walking in I was amazed how nice the interior is. i would have never guessed it by the way it looks from the outside which is extremely plain. 

Walked in sat down and was served right away by Mary who is absolutely awesome, frankly Mary is why we came back the second time because she is so nice and friendly. Each time back Mary have been amazing and has become a friend, it's really nice to have a bar with people working there that you can call friends. 

The is also really good, however the quality of the drinks depend on the bartender. The blonde bartender makes the weakest drinks almost to the point of wondering if there is any alcohol in them.  Went in today around 3:00 PM and had 2 really good Tito's vodka and tonic's. Then the blonde chick showed up for work and took over bartending. Sent the first drink she made back because it didn't taste anything like the first two I just had, I thought it was made with soda instead of tonic. The drink came back tasting like there was virtually no alcohol in it. The plan was to sit there and watch the whole Las Vegas Golden Knights hockey game. After observing how this blonde bartender was treating everybody at the bar we decided to leave. 

Honestly if it wasn't for Mary we would probably never go back again. 4 drinks 2 orders of wings over 70 bucks. Thats to much money for bad drinks. Mary on the other hand is priceless! 

The blonde with the attitude needs to be fixed.

Can't say much for the salad because I didn't eat it but it looked good. The pretzel bites were terrible. The cheese tasted like it came out of a frozen packet and the pretzel bites themselves were obviously heated in a microwave. Disgusting. But let me tell you, we got the medium wings and they were INCREDIBLE! The wings were so so so good and so were the fries it came with. I will absolutely come back for the wings alone.

For me, except for some of the divey PTs Pubs I've been to, this particular location is pretty nice, new and clean - except for the mens room. Not sure if someone took the gnarliest dump ever or they have plumbing problems, I think the latter... It stunk every time I went in.
We struck up a convo with one of the bartenders, she was telling us how the PTs brand is expanding and this was a newer concept...hmmmm. Anyway, the drinks are always good and the food is pretty good to. Typical PTs style happy hour 5-7pm or 12a-2a. During football season, they have food and drink specials 10a-10p. Very generous and that puts this on my list of cheap eats and cheap drinks.

During our last visit, we had the beef sliders (very good), the chicken nuggets (excellent) and the pizza rolls (not so good). One day I'll man up and try their hangover tots: tater tots, crumbled breakfast sausage, country gravy topped with an egg. A real widow maker there!

It used to be half off most drafts and five dollars for select apps like boneless wings, basket of fries/tots, and a few others. A pretty decent deal, especially with half-price Lagunitas IPAs, Blue Moons, etc. Our crew had been going weekly for months. 

However: two weeks ago the HH appetizer offerings changed, so we tried the five dollar fried pickles. A tiny paper fry basket arrived with perhaps 15 pickle chips in it (as opposed to the large plastic basket that used to hold the fried HH goodies). Wow, a really poor value.

Then last week after our second round of Lagunitas IPA tankards is delivered our server casually mentions Hey, you guys know these aren't on HH anymore, right? Uh, no, HH goes until 7:00. No, she says, they aren't ever on HH, only domestic drafts, not ""craft"" beers. OUCH, it would have been nice to know that before we ordered four $8+ beers thinking they were half that price!

I think the chef doesnt know how to cook, when you ask for a burger cooked medium it should have some pink, makes me think all their meat is frozen, they run out of stuff, and I don't know why their regular french fries have sugar on them, It's gross.",tZZD13YvWKnCV-uS_JE5JQ,1,0,2,h8ZeqLMSUheWldatr02v6g

I just left the place and literally the worst time spent at a bar. And I enjoy going around town tryin different dive bars fancy bars casino bars whatever.our bartender, Stephanie, absolutely terrible. She sounds sweet at first takes awhile with the drinks. I asked what the comped drinks were and ordered one my friend as well. Then we ask for menus we were waiting to order far too long. Wasn't a busy time at all. Anyways after ordering our food she never asked if we needed water or a drink. Finally after finishing our nachos which I must admit were pretty tasty. I asked if we could have the check and a water. She comes back without my water hands the check and says your 2 tequilas are on there because you didn't play enough. Every local knows every bar in town u get comped drinks for $20 play on max or $1 hands. Well I put in $30 lose win lose win of course went down to $1 then last hand won $25 and cashed out. I explained that to her and she says well no the machine says u didn't even play $20. Free goin back and forth I asked if I could just speak to the manager about this. Of course she hits me with the I am the manager. OMG!! Seriously she's a manager and cares nothing about customer satisfaction. I'm positive she has lost that pts plenty of business. I've heard about her but first time getting her. Terrible!!",yTjubXSampc6lPS4j9Ah9w,0,0,1,vP_84GU6ahzRJ8k8RKk79g
5452710,2017-05-29,0,Xy8R4AnLP3LxwFIYoPfhJg,I ordered 2 moose drool beers on happy hour which is from 5 to 7. Apparently they changed their happy hour from all drinks to certain drinks. I got billed $15.00 . Waitress said ohh that's not on happy hour anymore. But she knew it wasn't when I ordered it since I told her to let me know when it was last call for happy hour. Manager wouldn't change the price even though I used to e here all the time and ordered that specific beer. Smh.,aAkzOk5P2ofIEZlT8y9uIA,0,0,1,tcivPEBUJgXR847A4d1GvA

We moved up to the bar, and sat there for another 10 more minutes before waving down the bartender (who was friendly when he came over). Overall, the service is pretty bad, maybe it's the manager who didn't schedule properly; but this being my first time coming here I can't say I will ever come back.",vaSiuLp2rL0T3qZ8vgph4g,0,0,2,Thd9eyp9s9IvAe9EqVMBog

It was Friday night about 8pm. Parking was easy and not overly crowded but there is plenty of parking. As I walked in I noticed they had an outdoor patio area but was closed because it was colder outside. As I walked in you quickly notice the many TV Screens around the bar and plenty of bar top, bench seating areas. There is an active Fireplace that separates two rooms which on room is now catering but soon to be converted to pool tables and pinball machines they say. 
The main bar hosts many poker machines as in most bars around Vegas neighborhoods but also the bar has great lighting and feels welcoming. 

The bartenders were quick for service and welcome you to have a seat. 
Ordered beers and burgers and simply was on point.

Not too smoky as well even though some people were smoking in the bar area.

I particularly like the many TV's visible from just about any sitting location as well as they had big booths for larger parties.

I'm glad I stopped in as this will certainly be a return to place!

thanks.",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,0,0,4,n7uLxlIRPmu3qa-UEO1eGA

We waited 13 minutes to get our 1st drink and that was after we started timing. I was so upset we didn't even eat dinner we left and went to another bar and had great service down the street. 
If you come here avoid her service. It's not the 1st time I've seen her. She was at Buffalo and 215 PTs and she was no better there either. 
When I wanted to complain about her service I was shocked that she was manager! Horrific! Seriously. NOPE! This use to be my favorite spot to come when it was Jalisco's and Super Mex! I recommend everyone to go to the Buffalo PTs. Way better service!",v_uaZg5IFVsgOTSGeGFPkg,7,0,1,u102SvlUT9sr4Royjody5w

There are no pool tables or games you can play here, but it's a nice, posh place to stop by, especially with their HH deals. 

I'm a consistent fan of their chicken strips (buffalo sauce hot) with the tater tots. The pizza, not so much.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,0,0,3,J1Uhc-hrfrVPlWTiZZdwYw

The manager Bobby rocks as always and the new server from Hawaii is a sweet heart! The decor is rustic and current but, most of all comfortable! They just put in a new pool table, besides gaming,  there are more new games to come like shuffle board. Great food!
