Use the services on base! They'll disappear if you don't!",uZ4z-4ftg7LbGR_blmZTow,4,2,4,RfELS8ljIEDlvxaiZk_row

The menu is non existent, I came in looking for options and three types of burritos were all that was written on the chalkboard, yet they only had 1 by he time I came in. I wondered why. To my amazement it's because they microwave wave them. Well for the price I could got to the commissary and by a pack that I could microwave myself. The mocha latte was just awful. Just tasted bland. I will not be going here unless I'm hung over and just need anything to fill my stomach",hJPxKvw7YPexQZPTrMiPhw,0,0,1,50yNCvjm6e6IsTXp-2E5fw

Sausage, bacon and specialty.  We got in at 1030 and they only had sausage left... meh.  The burritos were a decent size and we're only $3.25 but only consisted of cheese, sausage chunks and ""square"" eggs?  Tasted exactly how I imagined, nothing special.  They do offer a small Starbucks menu and i did notice a lot of people ordering Starbucks drinks, which seems like a big hit.  I'll try and come earlier next time to get a better feel for everything they offer.",fxKmm8bJQStM7ezttU3XUQ,0,0,2,MgOqoApgiTGCcgRYrnqSsw

They used to cook breakfast burritos from scratch, but now you get a microwaveable burrito for the same it used to cost you.",lspBeYNqoVfdKU8URhLYjQ,2,1,2,TxMNvwbEn_zGBbf0PmnR7A
