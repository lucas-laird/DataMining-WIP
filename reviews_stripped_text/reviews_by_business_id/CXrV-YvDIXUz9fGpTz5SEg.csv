Now that i cannot eat lunch, i called the store back and let them know that there was a mistake, and all they replied was bring it back. I do not work close to this location and the only reason i choose this location is because i knew it was lunch time and i did not want to get stuck in lunch crowds. I also will not being getting off until way later in the evening, and there was nothing she was willing to do. She again said bring it back as we cannot delivery (which is not was i excepting or asking). there was no apology nor a sense of empathy.

1606191,2018-01-08,0,CXrV-YvDIXUz9fGpTz5SEg,"I love Chipotle for two reasons: 1) The food and 2) They are usually so good about food allergy and preparation. 

Normally, I'll ask for the first employee to change their gloves because I have food allergies (I'm allergic to dairy and soy). I'll provide my allergies if they ask so I don't hold up the line. Then that one person will follow me down the whole line.

Tonight, I asked the young man to swap his gloves and he stood and looked at me as if debating on doing it. When he finally did, I thanked him and he said nothing. After putting beans on my burrito he passed it off to another girl without saying anything! I had to stop her and say ""excuse me, I'm sorry but could you swap your gloves? I have food allergies."" And I got the same facial response from her. She stared at me for so long it was like she was debating on doing it or not. She did and I thanked her too. Neither of them asked what my allergies were, no information was communicated when he passed off and the attitudes were just rude in general. 

To top it off, while I'm eating I look around and the crew is standing there doing nothing and talking to each other. There was one guy who was taller with longer hair who was working all over the place while the rest did nothing.

Normally, I don't do bad reviews. I understand that sometimes someone has had a bad day or something like that. But with food allergies, it can be life or death. Luckily for me, mine aren't that severe. But the attitudes just topped it all off. I wanted to make sure others knew in case they had allergies like myself.",JFU_qJxMzQXejQZVB-SLng,2,0,2,Ly5IP-laq1Rdcp3qs-rkGg

1. Restaurant was Dirty(tables floor etc..)
2. No one ever wiped our table off or any other table if that.
3. We where sitting down and eating our food and there was a table of Employees (All young girls)look to be off the clock and some still working, being normal with volume voices and laughing, when all of a sudden it was crazy loud and I could not even hear my wife talking to me directly in front of me, given that the place is smaller then most other locations it was very Annoying.
Asked them to pipe down that didn't work. It was rude and loud!
I can continue to rate how poor this service and place was but I won't. Will I ever eat there again NOPE!!
4. As we where getting ready to leave I asked to speak to the manager(which never came out) a line cook came from across the counter and tried to apologize to me. I was not hearing it, since when do employees get to have a Huge high school conversation in the lobby where paying customers are and trying to enjoy their meal.
This place is a fail.
5. If I was (Undercover Boss) I would have fired all of them, they didn't care people where in the lobby trying to eat.
I should call back tomorrow and really let someone know how this location is being ran, TERRIBLE. But I think I did some justice with this review.

They charged me for ""double"" chicken when they literally served me the amount I normally get without having to ask for extra. 

Also, the food has obviously been sitting there for a while because the beans were dried on top and the carnitas looked dried up and gross; not to mention that the rice appeared to be hard as a rock. 

This is disgusting and I see why the location is always empty when I go.

After you decide you then move on to what you would like inside: cilantro lime rice, or brown rice, pinto or black beans, salsa, hot or medium, cheese and sour cream, guacamole for an additional $2.05 or queso for an additional $1.25. We also got the queso and chips which was great warm and the chips are salted and lime flavor. The queso is made with cheese, jalapenos, tomatillos and spices.

Once inside it took about a minute or so before anyone even looked up to acknowledge us. Eventually a gentleman manning the grill told us someone would be with us shortly. After about 2 or so minutes a young lady came to take our order. We were ordering 3 items but I guess since she only saw two of us she assumed we were only ordering two items? My husband had to reiterate that we had a third item to make. She basically ignored us and proceeded with only the two items. We figured maybe since she started the two she was going to finish with those and make the third, which didn't make sense. I have to say that on first impression of her there was no ""hello"", no smile. The first thing she said was, ""what did you want to order?"" She seemed to be either in a really bad mood or she hates her job. The final straw was while she was trying to roll the burrito a good amount of the filling was bursting out onto the foil. What did she do after that? She kept wrapping the burrito into the wet mess. We are supposed to eat that with our hands?

I like to give this Chipotle the benefit of the doubt because we come here on a weekly basis since it's the closet one to our house, but almost EVERY time we're disappointed. Last week when I got a burrito my black beans weren't cooked all the way. And if you come to this location in the evening they will most likely be out of something. On most occasions it's the steak. Even one time they were out of ALL sauces. How can you not have mild, medium or hot sauce all at one time!? Another time out of white rice, and another time out of black beans.

3204129,2018-05-27,0,CXrV-YvDIXUz9fGpTz5SEg,"I am a longtime fan of Chipotle.  I split my time between Los Angeles and Las Vegas and go to Chipotle on average about once a week.  I've been to many Chipotle locations including Pasadena, Burbank, WeHo and, in Vegas, at the Chipotle at the Arroyo Crossing shopping center or on Blue Diamond.  I would give most Chipotle locations 5 stars. I have found Chipotle consistent in their product -- fresh, good quality, good portions.  So if I were reviewing the Chipotle at the Arroyo Crossing I would give them 5 stars.  I've been to the Blue Diamond Chipotle three times now and on all 3 visits I was disappointed.  The food is like all Chipotle locations -- tasty and good quality.  But at this particular location, the service is the worst.  I have found the staff generally unfriendly.  I went to the location at about 2 p.m. today.  There were ample staff at the location.  Despite that, the place was a mess.  It's a newer Chipotle and everything is in great shape -- nice decor, etc.  But the tables look like they hadn't been cleaned in quite a while.  Virtually EVERY table had rice and napkins and soda rings and lettuce shreds, etc.  And when I was going through the line I noticed the same thing on the serving counter -- food all over the place on the counter -- like they weren't wiping it off to keep it neat and tidy.  One woman ahead of me got some napkins, soaked one in water from the fountain, and cleaned a table (note -- at this time of the day it was not particularly busy).  I asked one of the staff who was replenishing the plastic silverware holders if someone could clean a table as they were all dirty.  She had a huge chip on her shoulder and was completely unfriendly.  She actually said ""I'll get to it"" and simply turned from me and continued replenishing the silverware, etc.  I just stood there for about 3-4 minutes and then she finally came out with a cleaning rag.  She asked me in a rude tone ""so where do you want to sit"" and proceeded to begrudgingly clean a table.  Except the seat was also littered with food so I ended up cleaning another table myself.  BTW, the whole time I was there the staff were laughing and joking behind the counter and one of them could have gone out to the dining area to clean the mess.  I would note that this is the same experience I had at this location about a month ago -- but it was even more messy the previous time.   In any event, I give this specific Chipotle location a 1 star and will never go there again.  Food is great but service is the worst.",hlSHnaH9wpMot5nNvISoUw,0,0,1,jrkROzW2h3ZUmI_52qMTaw

We were laughing the whole time we were in there. They had just starting cooking chicken when we arrived so it would have been quite a long wait, so they gave us free chips. Which we thought was AMAZING!!
A little bit goes a LONG way when it comes to service like that.

I usually go to the chipotle at Arroyo Crossing.  I went to the Blue Diamond location yesterday -- my second time at this one.  While the food was the standard high quality Chipotle fare, the service was the terrible.  I was at the chipotle around 3:30 in the afternoon. The restaurant wasn't busy. There were maybe 5 staff behind the counter hanging out.  I noticed when I went in that a couple of the tables had not been cleaned.  The guests didn't bus their stuff so there were paper bowls and drink cups etc. seemed strange that the tables hadn't been cleaned when the place wasn't busy and there were workers standing around.  The severs were not friendly.  No smile, no greeting. The woman who took my order seemed like she was in a rush even though I was the only person in line.  I was telling her my selections and she started to put a spoonful of sour cream in my bowl even though did not ask for it. I had to stop her.  The cashier was stone faced and dismissive. I saw many reviews that referred to this location as the ""worst"" Chipotle. I concur. I would give pretty much any chipotle I've been to a 4 or 5 rating. But not the Blue Diamond location.

Instead of evenly chopped steak with the pink showing slightly in the center, I had unevenly cut pieces ranging in size from an inch to the regular size.  That might be okay but the meat was tough and full of tendons.  I had half sofritas and half steak.  Of the steak I pulled out 6 pieces of unchewable pieces.  That's a lot of a half portion.  The white rice was turning hard.  That really made me sad.  Now the service was a home run.  They worked their service magic but when I got home it was downhill.  I looked for a place to comment to the company on their website but found nothing so decided to air the dirty laundry here.

When I told him I wanted half steak too he responded that it would be an extra charge. But I explained to him that I initially told him ""half steak, half chicken,"" he said sorry it was too late because he portioned an entire chicken scoop already and the only option I had was to pay for double meat if he added steak... I didn't understand how I had to pay for his mistake in not getting my meat order correct when I clearly told him ""half steak, half chicken."" My BF in line next to me heard me say it and as confused as we were my BF ended up letting him know he'll just take that chicken bowl so it doesn't go to waste. From there he made our bowls and slid it over to the cashier where he didn't smile or say thanks for coming in to us. I would've appreciated a different response or approach to the situation instead of having me to pay for his mistake in not hearing me properly and paying extra as an only option.

My daughter ate at Chipotle with friends, and assured me it was good, so I decided to give it another try. Again, it fell completely flat. The carnitas were dry, and my tacos were stone cold. I didn't like that the regular toppings for carnitas tacos weren't available (diced onion and cilantro). I also ordered chips and queso. That's not queso, that's a gloppy mess.

Then I saw why there probably wasn't too many customers. The service here is terrible. It's not just bad, it's almost insulting. It like they had a contest going on to see how rude they can be. My wife and I walk in and nothing, no hi, no acknowledgement, the 2 women behind the counter don't even look up. A minute passes and the guy on the grill yells, someone will be right with you. That's it. Goes back to grilling. At least he acknowledges us and wasn't rude about it but that was the extent of our welcome. Almost five minutes pass and the light skinned black girl behind the counter just walks by a couple times. She knows we are there but doesn't look up is say a word. She'd been working on an online order so she's been slowly going back and forth but hadn't once acknowledged us. Finally the first words out of her mouth are ""what do you want"". Reluctantly we order 3 dishes or try to. I order a chicken burrito, sofrito salad and....I start ordering a chicken bowl but I guess she was done. Just starts moving to the next station and interrupts me saying chicken bowl by saying ""brown rice or white rice"" not sure if she only handles 2 times at a time, or didn't hear me. Maybe she's pulling a soup nazi move and in her head is thinking NO CHICKEN BOWL FOR YOU. We go down the row and complete the options for the first 2 items and I totally get that it's fast food, and the the ingredients are scooped and plopped, but it was almost comic how carelessly she dumped the food into the tray. It's was like the clique lunch lady serving slop. Final straw was her burrito rolling skills. She folds the tortilla and I should have been glad that she overloaded it, not to be generous, but just because she didn't care. With every roll, stuff was squirting out the sides, and there was literally a wet mound on the tin foil. Then she wraps the burrito in the foil. Doesn't replace it, doesn't wipe it. Wasn't sure if she was being lazy. Maybe she just didn't like the way I ordered my food. Maybe it was a set up so after we leave the staff could have a good chuckle.

I asked to purchase two gift cards and the employee didn't know how to register them and had to ask the girl standing next to her who wasn't doing anything but what seemed like ""gossiping"" to her, who then scoffed. At this point they still barely said a word to me or looked up. She messed up on the cards and had to re-do them.

I know after all the bad wrap Chipotle has gotten lately I was asked wasn't I afraid of getting sick?
But this is one of my favorite places to go to get a salad and I am sure by now they had it figured out what the problem was so I hoped lol

This was my first time at this location and of course my phone had to die so I could not check in. :(
What a perfect way to end a great night getting one of these! 

We walked in and was waited on us right away!
There were 2 employees making the salads and 2 at the register.

They made them super fast just the way we wanted them!! Talk about heaven in a bowl!!
I love their salads!!! The combination of flavors are awesome!  We both ordered grilled chicken,

I always get brown rice with the black beans on the bottom a long with the pico and a little hot sauce and topped with corn that has cilantro throughout this really makes the salad amazingly   good! Then a little extra sour cream with some cheese on top and there you go! Enough for 2 meals that's for sure! 
It made a great dinner and my lunch the next day!! 
I am happy they are now here and I don't have to go over on the strip anymore when I shop in this area. That location is way too busy you are never in and out too fast!!
Everyone here was friendly and the salads were beyond amazing!  I have to say this had to be the best Chipotle we have been in so far!!!
