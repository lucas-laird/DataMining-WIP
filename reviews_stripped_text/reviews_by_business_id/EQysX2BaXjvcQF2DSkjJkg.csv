1) You work on Tenaya in one of the many lonely business-plexes
2) You're sick of the two walkable restaurants advertising ""$2 Buds, 24 Hour Gaming,"" and ""Kitchen Closed, Bar Open"" 

The View Cafe is a cafeteria oasis, nestled right in the front entrance of the Mountain View Hospital complex. Just walk in and turn right for ""urgent care"" or make a left for ""convenient eats.""

This little Cafe receives a solid 3 stars on my behalf, comprised of 2 stars for tastiness, 3 stars for variety and 4 stars for convenience. Additionally, the atmosphere is excellent, the seating is ample, and the non-profit prices simply can't be beat. I love the idea of eating a reduced cost lunch in the midst of Las Vegas' top 10% of wage earners (such as doctors & nurses).

Some highlights:

-Today had blackened salmon, 2 sides and a 20oz fountain drink for $6.49.
-Employees get an additional discount
-Burgers and wraps made to order
-Pizza, soup, salads available
-Bendy straws for your drink
-Chocolate milk
-Food related incidents such as choking, IBS and bloating can be rapidly responded to by the numerous trained medical professionals.

Thank you, View Cafe, for sustenance I can rely on in this food-limited neighborhood.",CNoIsGYJUWv67qu-5PkyOA,5,2,3,BpFymxPolwc9I9OUf_Zrig

This self-serve cafeteria is just inside the lobby of MountainView Hospital, and has extensive hours (closes at 8PM, but reopens 11PM-2AM) and a wide array of good, to very good sustenance for those visiting, and seemingly, many employees. 

There's a salad bar which charges by the ounce, three hot items du jour (International station), grab and go wings, fingers, roasted chicken, with the option of add on fries. Two hot soups rotate daily, and chili seems to always be offered. There's a grill which cooks burgers, grilled cheese, BLTs and the like to order. Soda machines, coffee, tea, soft serve ice cream and a freezer with Good Humor type treats are available. In the refrigerated section are sammies (the chicken salad and turkey were AOk) cakes, pies, yogurt parfaits, commercial yogurts, juice, soda, milk and H20. 

Everyone I encountered there from grill workers to a smiling cashier who proclaimed ""I love my job!"" at ten minutes to quitting time, were all helpful and sweet. It can be a stressful time having a loved one in hospital, and they were a breath of fresh air. 

*Quick tip* though the prices are crazy cheap, if you are staying on the unit with a loved one, they will order food from the ""Room Service"" menu free of charge; there's also a Nutrition Pantry you will usually be guided to once they know you.

The fingers were inexpensive and tasty.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,14,13,4,LeDFNUQqSWh_8d8c7kcUmQ

I've been here for about a week caring for a family member and whenever I have been ready to eat, the food options are plentiful & various. Understandably, the cafe can be a busy place, with hospital staff & patient families awaiting their orders. However, the cooks are fast & the food orders are accurate. A special thank you goes out to chef Lisa, who has gone over & beyond the call to ensure that my dining experience was special. Thank you all, your kindness will never be forgotten.",rkxnFRCjQ2a7WqsPFGG7Hg,0,0,5,V13vhcfak-wDWHumXllUVw
5381857,2016-06-14,1,EQysX2BaXjvcQF2DSkjJkg,"This was possibly the worst hamburger I have ever eaten.  Soggy bun, hamburger pre cooked and soaking in water until ordered, then grilled. Don't understand the good reviews. I give it 2 * because it's clean and cheap and convenient to my docs. I will try something else next time.  They do have decent looking salads.",QQgdS8xwFcgKFmCBzZtmdA,1,1,2,jZgt91RFlB09MejpPt-B7A
