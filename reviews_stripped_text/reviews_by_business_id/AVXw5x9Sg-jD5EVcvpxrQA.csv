The service was outstanding this late at night. I was helped by two pretty girls and they seemed to enjoy what they do. If your having fun with your job and are more than happy to answer questions, heck even ask a few, you earn a 4 star rating. 

I ordered a Chicken Tendercrisp Sandwich Grilled with no mayo. It took a few mins for my order but I could tell it was freshly made. The sandwich had two warm buns, a piece of grilled chicken topped with a red tomato and some green lettuce. Pricing was not an issue as I expected this to be more than what you would normally pay. 

Maybe I caught them on a good day, either way the sandwich was great.

* BK in the airport... awesome!
* super fast speedy service
* crispy hash brown... mmm.
* condiments and plastic-ware station for customers
* cooler with orange juice/ milk/ chocolate milk
* clean  

CONS-
* PRICE !!
* No value items

TIPS-
*  If you can avoid eating at the airport, do it because the prices are ridiculous.  I ordered a breakfast combo and an extra orange juice.  The total came up to right under $13.00!
* order your fries without salt to assure you get piping hot fries (or hashbrowns) then you can add your own salt at the condiment counter.
* if you are at the airport waiting... keep your cup and you can take advantage of their beverage station (free refills)

It's tradition for me to have a light lunch or dinner here before flying out (I even impulsively got onion rings here once after arriving in Vegas). Yes, this Burger King is reliable, but the sad truth is that airline food sucks a big fat one.

They're always busy, so it's not always guaranteed that you can ""grab n go"" with the food.  The seating area in the C Gate area can also get very busy.....the seating at the other location is usually open because the customers at the A/B Gate location usually get their food and go to their gate since it's at a fork between the 2 gate areas and there's still a 2-3 minute walk to the actual gate.  Keep that in mind if you're planning to grab a bite before your flight.

The food is.....well, it's fast food and doesn't taste any different than the locations outside of the airport, just realize the cost is 50% higher.  The service level is decent, not great.

Overall, it's a solid place to grab a quick bite and deserves the 3 Star rating in my book.

Realizing that BK can hit you up one last time, everything here is DOUBLE the normal retail price as back home--wherever your home is.  $9.89 for a regular Chicken combo?  $3.50 for an extra order of fries?

OK, so my butt didn't need the extra order of fries, but you guys!!!  I thought the whole point of eating at airport fast food places was so that we could avoid those strangely-named snack shops that used to be in airports 20 years ago.  Like, ""Karen's House of Nuts and Pies"" or ""Ye Olde Sausage Hut.""  Anyone remember what it was like in those days before McDonald's was able to push its way in?  Well, thank you BK for showing me that $14.79 is never too much for an abysmal chicken sandwich, medium drink, and two medium fries.",Qx-5FRNpL14H2TtIKmB1kA,0,0,1,hpv0LXDRk1-AlnAD-l3hsw

So I suggest you eat before heading to the airport, when you get to your destination, or you take snacks (just no liquids the airports will make you throw them away, even with an unbroken seal).

The location is big and shares it's space with other food vendors.

The burger king in terminal C is a little hidden, it's behind the restrooms, shoe shiner, starbucks, and at the very end of the boarded walkway - there's a lot of construction going on.

Absolutely no free refills as another yelper posted, there are 2 fountain drink dispensers in the lobby w/a big sticker stating refills $0.79 - maybe if it's crowded and the staff won't notice you but then again it's not worth it.",hzK1T62UDUvetem3rwr2Zg,0,0,3,bUFRGILLVUtIRp1CL0uk7A

Their spicy chicken sandwich is pretty good but at what cost? I always wonder how much of their chicken is really chicken as well so I refrain to even indulge in that whether or not I'm in a hurry.",DkYv0GTlLQMEBkE7cmPnvQ,0,0,1,ghg0ms18IpJNGIFhc6dJeA

Sir, who cares? If I asked for an ICEE, give me my ICEE!! Why are you try to pinch my pennies?? 

In a state of confusion, I took the fountain drink cup and then realized that he really did NOT give me my ICEE! I went back to the counter to let him know that I still wanted my ICEE.  He said, ""Ma'am, I told you that was extra money, the fountain drink is already included.""  

Huh? Where is my ICEE?? Are you even going to ring it up?

In short, I ate my combo without an ICEE because my cashier refused to ring me up for it.  I guess, he just thought was would be a waste of my money to purchase an extra drink when one was already included.

Even for an airport, the prices are crazy.  You are looking at $10 for a combo meal.  Seriously?!?
