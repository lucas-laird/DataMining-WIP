I ordered ""The Carter"" named after one of the employees. Cool right? I wasn't too sure about cream cheese on a sandwich but it was incredibly delicious. I'm normally a mayo and mustard kind of girl but Mr. Carter himself suggested that leave off the mustard because it clashes. I did and added just a bit  to try at home. He was right really gross with the mustard. He asked me my name when I first got there and ended my time there by thanking me by first name when I left. INCREDIBLE customer service. They were cheerful and told me all about the shop while I was there. Where the art work came from and all.

He got the italian one on sourdough.  We both agreed that the sandwiches were fresh, the sauces were great and the place was well organized and clean.

I can't remember what it was.  But...I know I liked it.  And so....my review would wait. That was until...I was tasked with the answering the question, that is..similar to answering the question of one's existence.....""Where are we going to eat lunch?""  Remembering how much I liked TSS, I threw it out there.  I was happy it was accepted..now I could write a review.  Upon our visit, the one thing I noticed right off the bat, was the staff was not as helpful as I last remembered on my previous visit. I started to panic, but when I spied the ""The Winston Cooper""  I knew everything would be alright.  The Winston Cooper incorporates a delicious combination of hot pastrami, roast beef, and salami.  You get your choice of cheese, i chose American.  I wanted everything on it.  This included Mayo, Mustard, Secret Sauce (Garlic/herbs & Olive Oil), Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Onions & Peppers.  I asked for a side of ""Bomb Sauce""...this beauty is a fusion of Ranch and Jalapeño.  I chose the ""Dutch Crunch"" for bread.  It was a solid roll. This excellent sandwich was paired with some chips and a fountain drink.  If your looking for drink to just go with a sandwich, check in...your gonna get a drink for free (As of October. 2015).

I have figured out after having a few of the sandwiches here that I like mine with everything but pickles. I like pickles and especially on a pastrami sandwich but here they taste more sweet then dill and it throws the flavor off. They have different breads to choose from and the dude told me that some of the bread is flown in from San Fran and baked right at the shop. I chose the ""Dutch Crunch"" aka ""Tiger Bread"" depending on where you are from and it's really good bread.

I ordered an Italian stallion on Dutch crunch bread with everything.   Everything includes their special sauce - garlic and olive oil - and it's delicious.  My fiancé ordered a Trifecta - BLT add turkey.  Combo'd up for two sandwiches and a tip for around 20 bills.   

The Italian stallion: ham, salami, prosciutto, provolone and Italian dressing on Dutch crunch with everything.  Everything - mayo, mustard, secret sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and peppers.   The sandwich does not disappoint in shape, size, amount of meat or taste.   The bread is AMAZING.  It has a great crunch without being over the top thick.  The meat was delicious and I felt like it was the right amount.   The whole sandwich was just wide enough to make me stretch to take a bite but not wide enough that I couldn't take a bite.  

The Trifecta - triple decker of bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado.   Ordered with a turkey addition and gluten free bread.   My fiancé said it was by far the best gluten free sandwich ever made and the best part - no up charge for the gluten free bread.  Usually costs two-three bucks more.  Ouch....    The quality of the sandwich was amazing.   I would order and eat it, even with the gluten free bread.  And that says a lot.  

The service:   I had a chance to talk with the owner.   A tremendously nice guy with genuine service in mind.  The staff making the sandwiches were friendly and personable.

2645975,2015-03-07,1,TrGBHqHVzJM5tk2C1D1ctQ,"Looking for a quick lunch we opted for ""the Spot"".  A new sandwich destination in the Northwest.  After reading several yelpers reviews it seemed worthy of a try.  I am sure glad we did because I think it is a new favorite of the fam's.  

Right away I was impressed with the classic Vegas style sign and industrial style sconces on the wall.  The seating area also had a vintage look with the bright red industrial chairs and wood style tables.  I think they did great on the decor of this place and the extra large chalk board was a cool addition.  The menu board was also done very well in this art decco style design and lettering.  Very unique and nice touch.  Now enough about the ambiance let's get to the food.  

I have never heard of Dutch Crunch before but it looked amazing in others photos so this was a decision I did not have to think about.  The menu had tons of choices of sandwiches with fun and witty names.  We ended up choosing the""Winston"" and the Darius"". The :Winston"" was hot pastrami, roast beef, salami,and I put provolone and all the fixin's.  The ""Darius is a veggie sandwich with cucs, lettuce, tom, hummus, and avocado.  Both sandwiches were friggin awesome.  They were very good size portions and for a few $$'s ,more we made it a combo with chips and a drink.  The owner brought us some delicious sauces on the side one was called ""bomb sauce"" and the other I forget what it was called but was like a Teriyaki/BBQ mix which was also good.  

Overall I think this place is awesome! The location is not to  far down the highway so I will be back again and often.  My plan is to tour the entire menu.  

While there I did notice one guy waiting a really long time for his sandwich.  He seemed pretty upset because he was working at the time and in a slight hurry.  I think they kept making his sandwich incorrectly.  They kept assuming he wanted all the veggies or something and had to remake his sandwich it seemed like 3X.  My suggestion to the business owner is to simply ask each visitor what they would like on the sandwich so they do not have to throw mistakes away.  It will be tough to make money if anything goes in the trash.  

The mistake did not happen to us so I give ""The Sandwich Spot"" 5 stars. Great job!

Had the Pastrami Mommy sandwich. No kidding this was one of the best pastrami sandwiches I have had.  The meat was sliced correctly which made the meat tender and delicate .

I was pretty excited when I discovered that we had one in Vegas and it's been on my ""must go"" list since discovery. My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch and were not disappointed in the least. I had The Spartan with pepper jack on Dutch Crunch bread while he had The Pastrami Mommy with swiss on wheat. Both were awesome and so fresh! My boyfriend continuously commented on how good the wheat bread was. Noticed the 5-7pm happy hour they have Monday thru Friday when all sandwiches are $6.99.

The shop has a very open and friendly atmosphere.  All of the employees greeted us as we walked in.  They looked us in the eyes and made our order exactly as specified.  

I ordered the KLC's Pastrami Reuben. It was the best Reuben I've had in the longest time.  The pastrami was just right-not too dry like most places.  It had just the right amount of 1000 island,  mustard,  sauerkraut,  pickles,  peppers, and onions.  They even had marble rye! I'm drooling just thinking about it! 

My bestie had the Sinci Sarah.  I heard they named that sandwich after a very famous and fabulous lady in Las Vegas.  Roast beef,  bbq sauce, and Jack cheese. I snuck a bite- Delish.  

The owner let us try some of the unique sauces they use on their sandwiches. The Bomb Sauce was kind of like a spicy mayo.  Pretty tasty.  Their Psycho Sauce was to die for!  It was a combination on a BBQ,  teriyaki, and the Bomb Sauce.  I hope they bottle that stuff up and start selling it in stores.  I saw that they have a sandwich on their menu that uses the Psycho Sauce.  I am definitely going to try that next time.",l_6G8IPmJmWipXjc3_AlMQ,2,1,5,llURRbgO_MrJWoaYiZ57nA

The decor is very cool. Industrial and clean. I dig it. When I walked in, one of the employees apologized to me for the mess. She was wiping down tables and I saw no mess at all. But her apologizing and acknowledging it was a great bit of customer service. 

Sandwich Spot has over 20 sandwiches to try on a variety of breads. I had questions about the sauces and Dutch Crunch bread and was immediately offered samples of everything. Sweet! Both the Bomb Sauce and Psycho Sauce were delicious and that Dutch Crunch bread was phenomenal. 

I choose the #21 which was marinated chicken breast, hot sauce, blue cheese dressing and pepper jack cheese. I subbed the Bomb Sauce for the hot sauce, added onions and got it on that awesome Dutch Crunch. My request for pickles on the side was no problem. 

The sandwich itself was outstanding. The chicken was warm, which wasn't specified on the menu but was a great surprise. It made the cheese nice and melty. The crunchy bread was a great contrast to the cheese and chicken. The blue cheese was not too strong adding just the right amount of tangy goodness. 

Overall, this is a great place for a sandwich. I see no reason to go to Subway or Port of Subs when you can hit the Sandwich Spot instead. I can't wait to visit again and try some of the other sandwiches.

The Sandwich Spot is the only place in Vegas serving Dutch Crunch sandwiches, as far as I know and if you haven't experienced the Dutch Crunch you're missing out! This type of bread is flaky and crunchy on top and super soft on the inside. Enough about the bread, let's talk turkey, which was the base of my lunch. I went with ""The Carter"" which is warmed up Turkey, cream cheese, bacon, avocado, and bomb sauce; ""bomb sauce"" is garlic herbs and olive oil, FYI. The turkey was real thick sliced turkey and not the compressed stuff, but the cream cheese and bomb sauce together was overpowering, the turkey flavor got lost, even the bacon had trouble breaking through. 

The sandwich was still pretty darn good, and this place is definitely worth another trip. Their Veggie sammie (The Darius) looks amazing. Hey, Sandwich Spot please, add another location in Henderson, the Eastsiders will rejoice!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,29,29,4,SIH_iC-Ea3xH8Vrq27GNiQ

The place had just open so we beat the lines. After reading all the reviews for this place and seeing some of the photos I already knew what I was going to order. 

Both my wife and I got the pastrami mommy with double meat on the Dutch crunch roll. We got it classic pastrami style with just pickles and yellow mustard.

The Dutch crunch bread was super good it was crunchy on the outer side yet soft at the same time. Tasted very fresh considering it gets delivered from San Francisco. The pastrami is sliced thick which I love cause you get a real good taste.

3167785,2015-01-22,3,TrGBHqHVzJM5tk2C1D1ctQ,"Sometimes there's just nothing that can hit the spot quite like a good sandwich can. Aptly named The Sandwich Spot, this new joint which is a transplant from Sacramento, is looking to do just that. Located on the NE corner of Cheyenne & Tenaya inside the Target shopping center, they are bringing something new to an area that's otherwise surrounded by chains for miles. 

Walking in, you're met with some of the simplest, but coolest decor you can find in a sandwich joint. After some friendly welcomes from the staff and owner, it didn't take long before we had some samples in our hand and a bit of history on the place. The owners brother Binnion (yes, with 2 n's), which whom the Binnion's Baller was named after, actually designed and created just about everything in the store. Everything from the metal light up sign right in front, to the canvas photos on the back wall, to the just about perfectly done hand made chalk signs behind the counter. They also picked out some neat tables and chairs to match the theme of the place, and then made a whole wall in the hallway chalkboard style for guests to add their own little touch. With other unique little things like old school light bulbs, this is definitely a cool change of pace for what's become the norm for sandwich restaurants. 

While chowing down on the little sample pieces of bread with their signature sauces, we started to check out their fairly large menu. Adding to 20+ options that originate from the California locations, this spot adds a couple Vegas-only specialities. Most sandwiches are available on Sourdough, Sweet & Wheat or the infamous Dutch Crunch, which I believe is only available at this restaurant in all of Las Vegas. But for those who aren't looking for a classic sub roll, they also have sliced Sourdough, Wheat, Marble Rye and even a Gluten-Free option. There's currently 24 sandwich variations which range from $7.49-$8.49, and also a ""Basic"" sandwich, that is almost like a build your own, which also comes out to $7.49 if you opt for cheese. 

I ended up going with a #12, The Winston Cooper, and of course had it made on Dutch Crunch. It's topped with heaps of hot pastrami, roast beef and salami. Each meat was tender, flavorful and sliced at a near perfect and consistent thickness for a sandwich. This particular sandwich is also topped with their Psycho Sauce, which is a combination of their Bomb Sauce (spicy jalapeño ranch based), their Secret Sauce (secret ingredients) and a bit fusion style with teriyaki in there as well. On its own, this sauce is amazing! It's sweet, spicy, tangy and just as suggested by the owner, goes absolutely perfect with a real meaty sandwich like the #12. Aside from that, all sandwiches do come standard with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions and peppers as well. I'm not a huge fan of tomato or mayo on my sandwiches and they happily made it without. If they'd just add cucumbers and sprouts to the topping choices, I'd be in sandwich heaven. 

Now, the Dutch Crunch bread really is something that lived up to the hype for me. I've never had it in all my times to California, but have heard about it plenty of times. When that oven timer goes off for the bread being baked fresh in here everyday, it's a beautiful thing. What comes out looking almost like dried up, crusty old cheese bread is actually a perfect combination of textures. It has just a slight crunchiness on the top layer, but is warm and soft on the inside. I'm not sure I could even bring myself to try another type of bread here. Combined with their house made sauces, it's a killer flavor and texture profile for a sandwich that will be hard to beat for me.

The Sandwich Spot is definitely a welcome addition to the Vegas sandwich market. With quality ingredients and a pretty large sandwich that can be made into a combo with chips and drink for under $10, I have a feeling there will be plenty of people to agree with that. Plus the service is friendly as can be. I know I'll definitely be coming back, and probably sooner then later.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,5,6,4,dy4Hk8rS79Cc7JFvnIpu6Q

We had the roast beef with bomb sauce and cream cheese. Good flavor mix but could have been helped along with some crunch...perhaps a pickle. 

Also had the grilled reuben which was much more successful. Nicely grilled rye added the crunch I wanted. 

On the side we tried the fries. Being a sandwich place with such interesting menu items I was expecting something a bit more special, but alas they are simply out of the bag frozen shoestrings. Not bad, but not great. They have a nice dilly ranch that helped these along.

The sandwiches at each location are pretty much the same, but depending on what location you are at the sandwich might have a different name than you are used to. The decor is themed for the different locations also. When I first walked in there was a guy that greeted us and told us a little about the menu and the types of bread they offer. They had 24 sandwiches to choose from and several sounded so good. 

Priced at $7.99 I decided to try the ""Trifecta"" on sourdough. This sandwich had 3 slices of toasted sourdough with bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado. I enjoyed the sandwich. The bacon wasn't fatty and had good flavor and the avocado was fresh. One thing that really stood out was the tomatoes. I don't know where they get them, but the tomatoes tasted like they were just picked from the garden. One disappointment was the sourdough bread not being fully toasted. The bread was only slightly toasted and because of that there wasn't the crunch I look for when biting into a BLT and instead it was mostly soft. Hubby had a sandwich on their ""Dutch Crunch"" bread and I really liked that, so I will get that bread the next time.

I also tried the The Miss Swiss that consists of Hot Turkey, Prosciutto, Avocado & Swiss Cheese, it was tasteful. The The Carter filled with Hot Turkey, Avocado, Bacon, Bomb Sauce & Cream Cheese is my second favorite although I have not tried all of them LOL.

ATMOSPHERE:

Tucked away in a strip mall on N Tenaya and Cheyenne, The Sandwich Spot is a great local contender with all of the sandwich chains around town. Well lit and inviting, the inside looks like it has the bones of a former Capriotti's  with a nice splash of color, sweet HAND WRITTEN menus and cool decor by the owners brother, two and four tops, high tables, a little counter dining area, and a cool chalk wall in the hallway that anyone can doodle on while your order is being made.


BITES/BEVERAGES:

Dutch Crunch...that's what brought us here. If you've had a good Dutch Crunch Roll before(it's a Cali thing) you know that its a great bread option when constructing a sandwich. They have tons of options to make your own custom sandwich, or you may choose one of their tasty signature sandwiches. I went with the Winston Cooper which was packed with roast beef,  pastrami, lettuce,  tomatoes,onions, peppers, choice of cheese (went with provolone), choice of roll/bread (Dutch Crunch of course!) topped with their psycho sauce. This is one of the best meals under $10 you can get with chips, a drink, and one of their signature sandwiches. Delicious!

CLOSING STATEMENTS:

Great customer service, tasty sandwiches and great price point (Oh, and DUTCH CRUNCH ROLLS!) definitely deserves a return visit...ALOHA!!!

My specialty sandwich was delicious and customized to my liking with no mistakes at all. (Since it had BBQ sauce, I don't know what they would offer mayo on it as well. Honestly, that mixture sounds terrible.)

Unfortunately, I had no idea what Dutch Crunch was until reading Nate M's review as I wrote mine, so I think I had marble rye toasted instead.

The roast beef on my specialty sandwich was particularly good and they were happy to tell me and show me in advance of ordering that it was not very rare, which is often the case at delis like this and not of interest to me.

Food Quality: 5 Stars
-  Get the  #12 - Winston Cooper (Roast Beef and Pastrami) on a Dutch Crunch roll with ALL the sauces (Psycho Sauce, Bomb Sauce, etc.) Amazing Sandwich!  This place puts Subway, Jersey Mikes, Jimmy Johns all of them to SHAME!! 5 stars all the way!

Wife had the #10 - the Darius (all veggies) with added red pepper hummus. I'm not one for all veggie anything but it was crisp, fresh, and good. 

They also have great chip selection, Miss Vickies chips!!! 

Pricing: 5 Stars
- Great prices for the size of the portions and the quality ingredients and overall flavor. The bread is thick and soft. #12 goes for $7.50, add a $1.50 I believe for chips and a soda. 

Service: 5 Stars
- The owner and his staff are friendly and really enjoy what they do. They are humble and are very appreciative of rave reviews they are receiving. It is a quality hand crafted sandwich they are making, so there a longer wait then most sandwich spots. Be patient, its worth it!

Atmosphere: 5 Stars
- It looks like nothing much from the outside and its in a older shopping center (left of Target) but inside it has character, even a chalkboard wall to express yourself. Place was designed by the owners friend or brother in law I recall? 

Comfort: 4 Stars
- Plenty of seating, nice tables, place is clean, not cookie cutter at all in there. 

Location: 5 Stars
- Right off the fwy (Cheyenne Exit)

- The Fat: 

We came out of Target and wanted something fast to eat. I noticed ""The Sandwich spot and looked them up on Yelp. With high ratings, I wanted to try them. My wife was hesitant because she thinks sandwiches are too simple and not really a meal.

Psycho sauce, Bomb sauce, anything else he suggests, he knows what he is doing!  You will forget you are even eating a sandwich, its damn good and the best sandwich my wife and I have ever eaten. 

Wife had the #10 - the Darius (all veggies) with added red pepper hummus. I'm not one for all veggie anything but it was crisp, fresh, and good. My wife was super jealous of my sandwich though ;) She loved the #12 so much that she is going to open a Yelp account just to give them a 5 star review. She even told me to go back inside to thank the owner for creating such a great sandwich. Keep in mind, my wife never has liked any sandwiches, she also dislikes roast beef AND pastrami but she LOVED this sandwich! She was geeking out for about 20 minutes over it, lol. 

If you want a sandwich that is truly not fair to the competition, you must try this place. It's going to be one of our regular places.",snGMkVwMG6mq12R90qmqOg,1,2,5,75CcrU1wJ98opjnYX0MubQ

Located along Tenaya and Cheyenne, The Sandwich Spot is a couple doors down from Wine Five Cafe and the old gaming store.

I like this place! The decor has that retro vibe with great staff and really nice owners. The sandwiches are freshly made with bread that comes in from San Fransisco.

Recommendations: Ruben Sandwich and Number 16. I can't remember the name but it's really really good. Put it simply Sandwich Spot blows away all the regular sandwich places -subway, port of subs etc. 

Delivery is offered with a 5 sandwich minimum.
Worth it!!

The place is nice and clean. The menu had a bunch of sandwich options. We asked the owner what his recommendations were and he was very helpful. The staff were pretty chill and very nice. I had the #20 The Maru and my buddy had the #12 the Winston Cooper. Our sandwiches came out and they both looked amazing. By the looks of it, of course he was enjoying his. My sandwich by the way was fantastic. The bread was also very tasty. We both opted for the dutch crunch rolls. Yum. We were told to have the Psycho sauce(not sure if that's how you spell it) on the side for dipping and wow what an excellent recommendation by the staff. They even let us sample each of their sauces before we ordered. Super cool of you guys.

I went in thinking this would be another trendy hipster spot that would be whatevs but it turned out to be an amazing place that I plan to come back to at least a couple of times a month. I ended up bringing my wife home a #2 the Roger That so I wouldn't have to hear her yapping about why I didn't bring her a sandwich but in all honesty, I got it as excuse to taste it later.

4147493,2015-01-12,2,TrGBHqHVzJM5tk2C1D1ctQ,"A brand new business and I have been here two time already in just a four day span.  Must be good, right?  Right.

The Sandwich Spot is so close to home for me and yet I never knew it was opening up.  I don't go by the shopping center it is in all too often.  It was a co-worker who told me about it.  I am glad he did.

For $9.49 you can get any of their 24 (?) sandwiches, a drink, and a bag of chips.  Not bad.  Perhaps the price is more than that of a place that offers $5 12 inch sandwiches but there really is no comparison.  The breads here are more artisan and the toppings are fresh.  They also have some good sauce selections to choose from.  More on that below.

The first time I tried the Sandwich Spot I ordered a classic Reuben sandwich.  Pastrami, sauer kraut, cheese and Thousand Island dressing on toasted marble rye bread.  Was it the biggest, baddest, thickest stacked Reuben around?  No.  But I can't remember the last time I had a Reuben so good.  The meat was sliced thick enough to not taste like cheap lunch meat but not so thick as to not be sandwich friendly.  It was tender and flavorful.  The sauer kraut was good and crisp with a bit more sour than most krauts I've tried elsewhere.  The bread was the most impressive part of this sandwich when compared to others.  I love a good Reuben on marble rye but oh so often the bread is toasted too much and tears up my mouth.  This was just right a toasty crunch yet still soft enough to not kill me.  That is a hard balance to acheive.

On my second visit I ordered a Winston Cooper on Dutch Crucnh bread.  I highly recommend the bread for any sandwich.  Soft on the inside and crunchy on the out.  Awesome.  As for the heart and soul of the sandwich itself, roast beef, pastrami, salami, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncinis, choice of cheese and choice of sauce.  For my choices I went with Swiss and Bomb Sauce.  The whole package was nothing short of amazing.  Everything on its own was good but the synergy obtained by the combination is just hard to beat.

The Bomb Sauce I had on my Winston Cooper was good but the Psycho Sauce is truely where its at.  I was brought a small piece of bread with the Psycho Sauce drizzled on as a sample.  It is a mix of the Bomb Sauce and the Garlic Sauce they offer.  The two together form a sort of tangy and spicy sauce almost like a creamy Italian dressing.  The next time I am back I am going to get the Psycho Sauce on my sandwich.  It was just too good.  Hell, I would order a side of it to dip my chips in.  Yes, it is that good.

I can see this place doing really well.  It has some awesome food to offer and the staff is great.  They are friendly and fast.  They talk to their customers.  They get their opinions.  The joke around.  They play a good loud mix of music from hip hop to rock.  This is a cool little shop and a true asset to the neighborhood.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,6,5,4,p0yWm3GqYhfc5m256WX36Q

I am originally from Sacramento, CA and this place is a city treasure! They have the best sandwiches, the most amazing customer service, and I love that the food is so fresh!

My friend and I did not have a hard time locating the restaurant (its in a strip mall, next to target and off the 95 south freeway), and when we entered we were immediately greeted and asked if we had visited before.

The layout of the place is pretty simple. They have this huge photogenic sign with a cool dimly lit hallway.

My personal favorite sandwich is their vegetarian sandwich which has alfalfa sprouts, avocado, cucumbers, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, cheese, bomb sauce and cream cheese on their signature Dutch Crunch bread. Their roast beef sandwich with cream cheese is delightful too, but I'm not sure if that is an actual sandwich on the menu. They will customize any sandwich on the menu to meet your specifications just because they care about the customer experience. At the Sandwich Spot, you can taste the love in each and every bite.

The only negative thing I have to say about The Sandwich Spot is the amount of time it takes to make a sandwich.  On my first visit, I was the only person there and it took nearly 20 minutes to make two sandwiches. I thought about hoping over the counter and giving them a hand, but they had it under control. This week, I came in during the lunchtime rush and it took more than 30 minutes before my two sandwiches were ready.

5349097,2015-01-12,2,TrGBHqHVzJM5tk2C1D1ctQ,"My friend and I decided to stop by here for lunch since we were heading out to the SoBe arena at Fiesta Rancho for some ice skating. Plus, it's a brand new establishment -- they had just opened up on Monday! 

We got to talk to the owner of the store for a little bit so we got some info and back story. They had originally opened in Sacramento and have been growing at a really good pace the past few years. They actually have a decent amount of stores in the Bay Area. I thought it was a little odd since I am from the Bay Area and I haven't really heard of them .. but that's probably because they were still new when I was still living there. One of the perks is that the store is completely his own so he doesn't have to name the sandwiches the same as all the other stores ... interesting fact. 

Their menu is quite extensive and has a whole lot of choices for you to choose from. I actually looked at their menu online before I went so I wouldn't be standing there for like 15 minutes deciding what I want to eat... but I did take my time looking at the list of ingredients they add to every sandwich...

I decided to get a #2 The Roger That, which had hot turkey, bacon, avocado, and cheddar cheese. However, I asked them to sub the cheddar cheese with provolone. Every sandwich comes with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, secret sauce, pickles, peppers, and onions.... to which I opted the mustard out. 

My friend, on the other hand, went with a #19 The Miss Swiss, which had hot turkey, prosciutto, avocado, and swiss cheese. He opted the mustard, pickles, and peppers out of his sandwich. 

They also have, I believe, three different types of breads to choose from: the usual white, the wheat, sourdough, and a dutch crunch. The dutch crunch is a butter top crust (?) -- little crunchy on the outside while warm and soft on the inside. It's actually a popular type of bread back in the Bay Area so that is a plus. I've never had this type of bread anywhere in Las Vegas before and that's why we chose it today for our sandwiches. 

Also, you can make your sandwich a combo, adding chips and a 22oz drink all for $9.49, which was only a dollar more than our sandwich .. which was a pretty good deal to me so we both turned it into a combo. 

When our sandwiches came out, I was quite impressed. It was a pretty good size and on top of that, there was a lot of turkey in the sandwich. I couldn't help myself and just started munching on my sandwich without a word. Football was also playing on their TV so that was a nice plus too! 

Oh the owner also gave us a little bit of their psycho sauce and bomb sauce to try out :D the psycho sauce was pretty sweet, almost like a bbq sauce. The bomb sauce, which was a jalapeno ranch sauce is pretty good but a little too heavy. I can tell that if I have too much of it, it'd be too much for me to handle. 

BUT yummy in my tummy. The sandwich was delicious. The best part about the sandwich is that they do not skimp on the ingredients at all. There were plenty of pickles and peppers. Not too much onions, which was actually PERFECT cause I don't like TOO much onions in my sandwich. The bread was really delicious too, it tasted fresh and the crunch on the top added a really good texture too. Though, the thing I did notice is that my sandwich was dripping water...probably from the pickles and the peppers perhaps? I don't know. I may also opt out of the peppers and pickles next time or have them go light .. cause I did notice that it covered up a lot of the turkey taste :( ...

And I only finished half of the sandwich and my chips ... I took the other half home. TOO MUCH FOOD. 

Overall, quality ingredients, great bread, good amount of food, price wise is great for what they serve you, and service is really friendly. 

The only down side is ... it is quite far from where I live. If we weren't going to the SoBe arena for ice skating, we probably wouldn't even be on this side of town. I live on the SE side of town while my friend lived on the SW side of town .. so getting to this location is longer than your usual lunch commute in Las Vegas. I mean, if I lived closer, I would definitely come back more often ...but since I don't, I'm not sure how often I would be able to go. Now don't get me wrong, the food is great and the price is great but I'm not sure if it warrants the drive.

We have talked to the owner a little about the location. He mentioned that he originally looked for a place in the SW area but it didn't really work out. But it is still in the back of his mind .. who knows, maybe he'll decide to move closer ! 

But, if you're in the area, give it a try. Definitely worth.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,4,4,Pi0sVpy61WgzS5uX4vhxrQ

I had the Italian sandwich on the dutch crunch bread.  The Dutch crunch bread tasted good, but it scraped up the roof of my mouth - ouch!  I don't know how anyone can eat that and put yourself through the pain while eating a sandwich.  When it comes to sandwiches the bread is super important...

The rest of the sandwich was ok, not great.  It had some fairly average deli meat on it.  It was not a very big sandwich either.  It was almost all bread with a modest portion of meat and toppings in the middle.  Not bad - but far from excellent.

I would go back to try another sandwich.  The 2 star review is basically what it is supposed to represent - ""meh. Ive experienced better.""  3 stars means A-ok and my experience wasn't that.

My rating would be more like 3.6 stars rounded up to 4. One thing I found very strange looking at the menu was a lack of ham based sandwiches. I am a ham sandwich kind of guy, and they offered nothing ham except the build your own sandwich. Plenty of turkey, plenty of chicken, plenty of roast beef....but no ham combinations. 

I ordered the Carter, which is Turkey, avocado, bacon, bomb sauce, and cream cheese. I didn't quite taste any bacon so maybe adding more here would help. You do get your choice of extras like lettuce, tomatoes, mayo etc....so its built to your taste. $8.49 for the sandwich, and an extra $1 gets you chips and a drink.
I had mine on the Dutch crunch bread which, while interesting, is really just white bread and a crunchy like outer shell. 

Overall, a much better sandwich than Subway, Quizno's, or any of the other chain places. Really wish they had ham choices though.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,2,2,4,YYKJeD9yL8mjA0NVGxCKAw
