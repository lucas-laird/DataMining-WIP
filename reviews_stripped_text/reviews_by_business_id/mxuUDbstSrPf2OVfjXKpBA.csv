934743,2017-05-02,0,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,"Went here on Saturday afternoon for a quick sweet treat, there were two employees and a crazy line. The employees did not really seem to have any system in place for helping guests and it took forever! Ice cream was as expected from Dairy Queen.",xZXEBvQuvTrkdfEkrYlLcw,0,0,2,-S9Dw0IgIeCt0Yqd7LrzTg
1130438,2017-11-13,0,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,Arrived at about 9:15pm (they close at 10pm) after looking forward to a blizzard treat all evening. We were told that they had run out of ice cream. How does a f***ing dairy queen run out of ice cream!?!,9AVR1iAWAmusA7pv5ffBFA,1,0,1,X-IBMxwQZESnGI-V0hcskQ
1513174,2015-01-23,2,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,"Came here to eat lunch. It's your standard hot dog stand. Lol! They only have hot dogs, Pepsi products to drink, smoothies & desserts. Food is okay. Chili cheese dogs were so good. So much cheese on my chili dog! 
This is located on the first floor of the Excalibur hotel. There's also a game room in front of Dairy Queen. It's a great place for kids to play at. 
There are about 5 tables on the side of Dairy Queen. There's plenty of room to move around. Not too many people here which is great. 
The lady was handing out free samples of a berry smoothie. It consisted of blackberries, strawberries, blueberries and yogurt. Tasted delicious. Very berry! Very smooth consistency. 
My daughter loves the Excalibur because to her it looks like a princess castle. We will be back. Descent place.",AN9y_ctlxODtNOhwk2mx-Q,3,2,3,1cD_wqrWurwq7zeJI9X6xw
2574664,2017-02-04,0,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,The lady that helped us was SO nice!  She gave really excellent recommendations and she was very friendly.  I have never had great experiences at Dairy Queen with their employees but this one was stellar!!  Her name is Aeri and she was seriously incredible!  I loved the Reeses blizzard with fudge instead of peanut butter!,2MaV4LVdRnXhge4FcOStrQ,0,0,5,pti9iLT3FXQBBH-iVXTlPw
2841868,2017-09-20,0,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,"I came here at 9 pm last night and the women working said ""I can't make any drinks, we close soon"" you close soon? Girl, you close in an hour..you're just lazy. I asked for a water and she walked EXTREMELY slow to get it..management needs to do something about this problem. The women refused service to other people in line too because the shop was closing in an HOUR.",YAqtXfrK4XoGaIYBRkllQw,0,0,1,JL3BrY8kzDdNI_QYYOw6nw

Got a small oreo blizzard but it cost about $6... the ice cream wasn't creamy or anything.. i was so sad. I guess i got used to Mitchell's Ice cream or Tillamook Ice cream which were a lot more fuller and used authentic dairy.",cDsMEfCHpZ29fBP__qcc4A,0,0,2,PHiJfLvw3wCIA_x4UmBksA
4131961,2014-03-28,0,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,They don't have chocolate ice cream here which is a major fail. And no dipping in chocolate is not the same thing. Other than that it was your typical dq. Good location to take a load off and look out the window at goings on.,j39JhTFEAMQD2Ch6L_bv6Q,2,0,3,RFd9fmqjt_zCUJlcy2WjRA
4285387,2011-09-16,1,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,"I don't wanna go 5-stars wild on this place, but I had an Orange Julius here for the first time in about 15 years and - goddamn - just as tasty as they always were! I didn't even know the chain existed anymore, so this find stoked me out.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,2,3,4,i4ohUOhkfgkyZh5wjMxgJA
4542285,2017-08-13,0,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Who teaches these employees how to make the menu items?? I ordered 3 freezes (usually slush mixed with ice cream) and I received ice cream mixed with flavoring... I requested them to fill my cups more and they refused.

5603605,2017-09-15,0,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,"Every single employee here needs to be fired. Today is September 15th 2017 at 4:03pm at the Excalibur location . 

Myself as well as 7 other people are here waiting in line and with 3 people working it's taking over 15 minutes to make ONE DRINK. And none of them could even take an order while the other ones were attempting to make a customer's drink!

How long can it possibly take to make 1 single drink?!?! Needless to say I will never come back here since I probably won't get my drink even if I had the chance to order one!",DeHx-UbWhKuLUiG78_FKEQ,0,0,1,p9z6abmDWKmyodeOVqvyRA
5944492,2014-07-02,1,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,"Not impressed with this location. We ordered 2 hot dogs, a sundae and a blizzard.  We wanted the blizzard made with chocolate ice cream and were told they don't have it. So we said okay, vanilla is fine. Then the cashier goes to make the hot dogs, and the other person working tells her not to make them because the kitchen was closed (we saw her even take out the hot dogs and then put them back). After we got the desserts and ordered a sandwich from subway, we discovered the turtle sundae didn't have caramel, and the oreo blizzard had almost nothing but vanilla ice cream. Very disappointing service. It's better to go to the other restaurants in the food court.",bFwd3BNlEchWD4-xRfhtnw,4,0,2,UKpEeKPmAl1zC3njtJrc6A
5977721,2015-12-10,1,mxuUDbstSrPf2OVfjXKpBA,This dairy Queen is right by the arcade of the Excalibur Casino (smart placement lol). This dairy Queen did not have chocolate ice cream when I went! Not sure if they were out or if it is because it was such a small location.,OgR807T8aPmCOumFDTVsMw,3,0,2,cdGgSQ8wLDXS23NH3g-gZA
