Mind you this review is only for the daiquiri .... But with all honesty I forgot what i had LOL... (but it was good... ) they had about four flavors and all i know we mixed them all up.... it was under 30 dollars and if you keep the large cup you get $20 refills
Cant go wrong with that",yKkb2x_MMOzWPy5Nclgm_w,1,1,3,NBZPBKRrXItuARr6mtHXUw

That is about the very best I can offer to this crowded, loud, very dirty spot. The food was microwaved, and greasy. I just won't go on, except avoid it.",SHn5pXg4BSUVQPxKPtrAfQ,0,0,2,mKc-ObY6ag_-5tIACKgpYg

For my first drink, I ordered the Tequila Sunrise. It was a bit too sweet and had to add a little club soda. My guy ordered a beer and as a finale, we ordered the Cabo Wabo Margarita. That was pretty good and in a nice big glass. 

Our Bartender was very nice, accommodating and had a nice conversation with.  I guess they see their fare share of people from everywhere, every single day.",Lu8y2ayxVlAzuJEVfVcH4w,4,3,4,YfHQBtzCN2e81eTYspVu_A

Love this place when I'm passing through McCarran.",1NWsKjxq9TNbA3ACd7Xykw,0,0,5,i2yFZ2AiclbMKWAI9QSwhQ

It wasn't so crazy overcrowded like the other options by C 12-c16... this is  in the newer section of Term C. But I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon it and I got a bar seat and fast service. Melissa was my server and she provided great service. I will be back for sure if and when I have time between flights. They had 2-3 sports games on for sports buffs this will be a hit. 

So the food is pretty good for bar food (you are not coming here for organics!), I had a burger cooked perfectly and the fries are decent (they put cheese on them, so request no cheese if that is an issue). They also had a decent Pinot Grigio available vs. their 2 chardonnays which I won't touch ever - so that was the saving grace for me. It is odd that they offer you a 9 oz or a 6 oz pour and literally measure it right in front of you - I am sure this is management's orders, but not so customer friendly. It cheapens the experience for sure. BUT with all that I would still go back because it was easy, fast, provided a good enough environment to spend an hour before my flight and had nice servers.",m_Ypsp2GMd9mMYlggfjqKA,0,0,3,nplQ6dNHnF7GqM4lOGlrWw
