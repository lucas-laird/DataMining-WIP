The bar girls are very friendly and the man cans of Pabst are only $3.50 (Booya!). 

The stage area in the back feels more like a class room but that's cool. Once in while they bring in some decent comedy. 

And my personal favorite from my last visit was the creepy dude in the corner with a briefcase. Yeah a real briefcase. Seriously, what's in there? Scarface phone? A bunch of coke? Briefs? The curiosity was killing me but I couldn't muster up the strength to actually find out. Maybe next time, guess I'll have to go back.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,1,4,NRZG0tDyjDRoEdg8vD_T4w
116739,2013-04-07,0,4E309lwPu65lXyaeuLRETQ,"I usually only go to Boomer's when they are having an event in their back room (mostly the amazing burlesque shows held there).  Parking is not an issue as they have a lot, plus ample room on the street. I am not a drinker, but have noticed that the bartenders are very prompt and courteous, and prices reasonable. The men's bathroom is clean and well-stocked.  Plenty of tables, plus they have pool and a few other bar-type activities.  One of my favorite things to do is walk up and down the metal steps on the East side of the building.  They look like they've been taken from a ship or something.  The bottom step is a bit bowed, so be careful with that one.",abw6bqZccf9C_mT1_nqe2g,2,0,5,H5HoeG0YxSDvpSIad3SgKA
1049548,2012-05-11,1,4E309lwPu65lXyaeuLRETQ,"I'll support any quality metal band that travels over 6,150 miles into the hot desert, so last night I came here again just for that. This time around it was Romania's Negura Bunget. 

Every year there tends to be more shows around May, June and July. You can thank the huge music fests that are coming up within the next couple months, i.e. Maryland Deathfest, Central Illinois Deathfest, Chaos en Tejas, etc. A lot of the bands are actually from overseas and don't tour the states that often. So if you can't make it to one of these festivals, you still have a chance to see some bands that take advantage of being state side and tour. 

On a side note, some more bands touring as of right now: Nasum (Sweden), The Devil's Blood (Sweden), Demonical (Sweden), Church of Misery (Japan) and Horna (Finland) to name a few. 

The place was the busiest I've ever seen it. There was only 1 bartender working so the wait for drinks was longer than usual. I seen about 10 different kinds of beer on tap. Domestic pitchers were $12 and $16 for imports. 

I had a good time largely due to friends and the live music. Negura performance was on point. A Black Metal band with traditional Romanian folk instruments would be my brief description. Being in the position to see them again within a few weeks in Maryland is definitely a plus.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,2,2,4,_PUmIew0wystZ-Hw6oUuog

I flashed my lights and she started to approach my car until she saw I was a woman. So...  hookers in the parking lot? For me as a one year resident in Vegas, i was disappointed by the area and the lack of any kind of security present to disallow things like that. But it seems to have a very specific event following for certain burlesque and comedy shows which are in the back room. Other than that it's a pretty empty beer bar.

1460177,2011-09-25,9,4E309lwPu65lXyaeuLRETQ,"I will go for Las Vegas Burlesque Live! Otherwise, getting a drink from that lame chick, Marie, is like delivering bad news to someone who's cat just got ran over. What really pisses me off, is the last time I was there, I asked for a cup of water. It was loud due to the live band playing. She brought me a bottle. I politely told her a cup would be fine. The look that bitch gave me...I wanted to slap it right off of her face. First of all, it's your f'n job. Second, I have worked in this biz for over 15 years and I appreciate an upsale. The bar was busy, so it really wasn't necessary. Third, Don't assume a bottle is what I wanted. And then get pissed because I didn't want it after we just bought 5 drinks. You are lame and I will tell everyone I know about you. The owner is super friendly and gets it. She knows what she is there for. I think Marie needs a hug. Even so, it probably wouldn't change her rotten attitude. A few months back, before leaving, I came up and left a tip for the night. It was pretty big. Do you think I got any love? So I haven't left a tip since and she just reinforces my decision. Yay for Cha Cha's Burlesque shows! Boo for the bitter bartender. I'll just wait and go somewhere else, like Frankie's, where I get treated better. Thanks! But NO THANKS! Lame.",sBqCpEUn0qYdpSF4DbWlAQ,5,0,1,gB7kFLWAQriNnp9AI4DmwQ
1476838,2012-01-13,0,4E309lwPu65lXyaeuLRETQ,"Came here for New Years Eve and the burlesque show. It was a really great time. This place is a total dive bar, but I like my bars divey. The burlesque show was very good, very funny and the room is small enough where most seats are good seats.

This has been mentioned in other reviews, but the Boom Boom Room (where the burlesque show is) is quite small. So get there early unless you want to sit in the back.

The crowd was lively and fun. I had no problems with the service either, everyone was really great.  There isnt much around here though, I don't live in Vegas, so I couldn't tell you whats even close. Its like a totally random business area. 

I wish they had the show more then once a month tho! :(",D2olw_tyQWAsBb9XTQhv8w,1,0,4,WotHJfAzi5y7mZVrXJQJJg

Who doesn't like boobies??  You can't find that person.  I challenge you!

Live Burlesque has their monthly show here and it is fantastic!  I like that you can reserve a booth so you can feel like a big shot Rat Pack member whilst watching the sparkly ladies take off their unmentionables!

Drinks are totally reasonable.  Not over-priced like you'll find on the strip!

Come to the Halloween show!  Yours truly will be performing along with a stellar cast.  A good time will be had, for certain!",LUpPyHnDlQOm9F4GCKcuHA,7,6,5,1_WqtXwFRWH14HpTbuXISQ

An average divey, hole in the wall, down to earth bar. Good size bar and seating area, they have a couple pool tables and I think a dart board. Their Lagunitas IPA is $3.50! And you can start your drinking with the free Bud or Budlight with your Yelp check in. Crown or Jack(I can't remember what the BF ordered) was $4-4.50. Not bad either way.

Game of pool?  Totally in.  You'll probably lose your dollar the first try, but the bartender will definitely toss you a bill to replace it.
Also, they've got a new school Juke Box.  Righteous!!",YyGhWvyw6mjJFICgq7rUxg,6,3,5,Po-MGkwSfCTxo8R2aXsFEg

3394553,2017-03-24,0,4E309lwPu65lXyaeuLRETQ,"This bar is great if there is an event happening that you can go to, because they have a decent back area with a stage and seating area. The bar itself lacks atmosphere, but when there is a comedy show, a burlesque show, or swing dance the place lights up and has a great atmosphere and makes for a great place to spend time with friends. The bar area is large and has high tables and chairs. They have two pool tables and a stage area (but I have never seen that stage area be used). They play music through a juke box, and it usually is low enough that you can have a decent conversation with a group of people. It's a little bright in the bar area for my taste. 

The drink prices are reasonable. All the bartenders are super nice, but sometimes the service is slow. 

It's definitely a dive bar, but not a boutique or swanky one, more of a generic drive bar. 

The location is down a random street in an industrial complex, so if you are driving down it and you think you are going the wrong way because it is dark and there appears to be no life happening, you're not, keep going and you'll see the bright sign. It also has a nice view of the strip.",uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g,1,0,4,wss-Al5cWzyqabg-YXQ8Jg
4238465,2014-03-18,3,4E309lwPu65lXyaeuLRETQ,"umm, they are open 365days 24/7..ok, disregard the previous comment.  This bar is not open 24hrs, my bad.  I only come here on Sunday's, they have open mic comedy hosted by DAT DUDE DONNIE, right now you can catch DAT DUDE every Friday night hosting and headlining at Sapphire's Friday Comedy  Hour.  (Sounds like I'm a promoting him, hmm) ok, so I am just a little.  Oh yea, this is a review about the bar huh? 

This is a old school bar, off in the cut.  Cheap drinks and even cheaper laughs.  The bartender LISA is really, really cool.  Please tip Lisa if you do happen to take a trip on the wild side and experience BOOMER'S.  I don't know what it is like during the other days of the week, but Sunday is a Adventure and she's bartending SOLO up in there.  

No real pizzazz here, a couple of pool tables, dim lights, chairs and bar stools.  

BE WARNED: the bathroom stall door in the ladies restroom sticks.  I promise (and I'm laughing as I type this) my friend got stuck in the bathroom for like 15mins.  She couldn't text me because she left her phone w/ me.  When she came out of the restroom she hits me on the shoulder and says: ""B!tch, didn't you hear screaming your name? I was stuck in the bathroom""  My response was: ""No hag, I was wondering what was taking you so long""

hahahahahahahaaaaa, I don't care, that is still funny till this day and that happened like 6months ago.


Overall Boomers is an ok spot..

 but this is only my opinion, check it out for yourself

It's pretty dive-y. OK, very dive-y but not Dino's dive-y if that makes sense. Bad dive-y??

I've only been here for the Lindy/swing dance nights on Friday. I would give 4 stars just for that event. 

Service seems slow or only if you're a regular. I remember trying to get a drink and the bar keep wouldn't even acknowledge me until a friend called them out on it.

Watch out for peddlers and what not, the surrounding area is pretty sketch. Really, I would only go here if there was a popular event in the back room going on.",GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w,0,0,2,8CC69PWz9MpbR2IjQsinFw

Okay, this is a fun place. The fist time I came, it was by accident. I went to a business nearby and saw it on the way. 

It's a small dive bar, so my first visit was uneventful. The next time I went months ago, I seemed to have gone on a Magician's night. Groups of people were picking cards, volunteering for each other, watching others sleight of hand maneuvers. there were a couple of people I recognized as performers on the strip, in a smaller show. apparently some of the big Magicians on the strip have even stopped by, names were being dropped.

Boomer's has been in the news lately because of their new promoter, who books mostly punk bands for the bar, a big change from the rocker/ juke box scene it was before. 

But that may be the jump start it needs to drum in some more business. I want to raise my review up a star, but we'll have to go there a couple more times on a band nite to see how it rocks.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,3,2,3,LexL_O-QGDDMjyeWqhLcBg
