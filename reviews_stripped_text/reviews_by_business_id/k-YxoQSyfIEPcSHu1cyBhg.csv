I was eating the sandwich and remember feeling like it tasted funny, but thought it was just me; as I am 22 weeks pregnant and have been trouble keeping food down (morning sickness). I discovered that the egg in the sandwich had mold throughout the egg, and I ate almost the whole thing. As a first time mother I was worried for the safety of my baby, and called my doctors and poison control. Hopefully the baby is okay. I would not recommend eating at this establishment, as they serve moldy food to customers. I have pictures of the egg, and will share them!",z9Anp8JcECK4UAcgC3G39A,0,0,1,OFs2GeYLCm9J5trom1Fjbg

The straw kept getting clogged, we figured it was just oreos.  We stirred it around out of habit and we saw something blue. We picked it up and it was a finger condom! Finger condoms are used when you cut your finger. You put a band aid over it and then a finger condom to prevent the band aid from coming off. THAT IS DISGUSTING.  When we called to complain, nobody apologized. No sympathy was shown. They just said we could get a free shake next time. Why would I want a free shake after getting something like this in my current shake?? There are a few other jack in the boxes in this area. Do not go to this one! A good one is 3821 E Craig. Always humorous and good attitudes and I have not found any items in my food that is not meant to be there!",L7oPPwgyq_btB9KGLug-3g,0,0,1,PB-9aUTsP_53o5ulYHjYNA
600227,2015-08-18,0,k-YxoQSyfIEPcSHu1cyBhg,"I went late like 10pm last night to buy a chicken sandwich and some nuggets & I also had a coupon for a free medium fry with any purchase so I used that as well which came out to like $2 and some change. When I got to the window the employee that looked like he could be manager (he had a red shirt on) took my 20 dollar bill and asked me to pull to the front and they would bring me my food. He closed the window before I could get a word out about my change . I pulled to the front and he came out about 5 mins later. I went home a noticed I didn't get my change or my receipt. I turned around and went back . A new manager was on shift (less then 5 min after I had left the drive thru) I told him what happen he asked for me to come back at 6am after he count his money and it there was $17 and some change over that he would give it to me. I came back at 6am this morning before work and he said his money wasn't over (who pocketed the $17? where did it go?) and that the OTHER manager would call me by 10am. It's not 12pm and I still haven't got a call or my money back. This place is horrible and the whole company and location lost my business for good. Wouldn't recommend and will defiantly tell all my family members and friends is the area about Jack In The Box.

P.S. Will Update IF they call me back.",66js8OIlRJDbBKXaaE-HnA,0,0,1,yXSsUq4OEyM1OSAdND9kXA

4107972,2014-08-04,0,k-YxoQSyfIEPcSHu1cyBhg,"The only reason it's getting a 1 star is because husband like this place, but other than that it sucks. We usually stop here if we are leaving town late at night, but not anymore. On Friday August 1 2014 at about 11pm we stopped here and I guess he was the night shift supervisor, but being that he should have been courteous to customers. We ordered and drove up to the window, well a few people came inside and he decided to ignore drive thru all together and take their order and serve them first. We waited in drive thru for almost 20 minutes from start to finish. Once he came to the window he was rude and he spilled our drink and didn't even apologize or clean it up, I ordered cheesy bacon potato wedges and wow. It had maybe a teaspoon of cheese with 5 little tiny bacon bits on it, yes only 5 and you pay $2.50 for this trash. Next I asked for ranch because hubby got a meal and he gave us 1. I asked for 1 more and he rolled his eyes and said that he has to charge $.50 for it. I said fuck it and this damn place never charged for it before and left. Absolutely horrible experience and the quality of food has gone down considerably. I will never ever return to this location because a I can get better customer service from McDonalds which in just down the street.",4d14iYYxxaVrlAWVh8sbFQ,2,0,1,3TvTiWhUUE6Ej2kwdmxJTg

The last three times, my order has been incorrect. I knew it would be wrong this time because the guy repeated the order wrong twice. I corrected him, still screwed. I dont have time to rifle through the whole order while sitting in the drive through. I pay for it to be right, so I expect some freakin quality control. You want $15 an hour?

Not only that but one visit was so bad on the service. The employee told me to reverse my car a bit and go forward just to reset the drive thu timer. Like dude, it does not take this long for this shit to be made.",w3i6oVvG-tX0Cy_iDSE5ew,0,0,1,2lVgN7OnK76WnLgzJBFTNg
