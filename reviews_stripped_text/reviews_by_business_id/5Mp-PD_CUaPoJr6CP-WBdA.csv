Since this store was in Vegas and so far from the mother ship in southern California, I was a bit apprehensive. The prices are a bit higher than your stand alone restaurant...fish tacos here are 3.99...nonetheless I had to try some. Let me tell you, they were the best Rubios fish tacos I've had to date, and I've eaten at almost every one from San Diego to L.A...plus the fish was huge, I ordered 3 but should of stuck to two...my taste buds were telling me more,more,more, but my body was screaming for elastic...this store was great",Vvt_C-6ABG1VgxfjNccIBQ,0,0,4,xQm2o7nvB7CzyLZo0k3Qyw

978009,2009-03-10,1,5Mp-PD_CUaPoJr6CP-WBdA,"First, my credentials, briefly: I'm a native New Jerseyan but travel the nation for work  When I first heard ""fish taco"" from a co-worker from L.A., I thought, ""Disgusting!""  Then on vacation I tried one at the behest of a friend in Pacific Beach (San Diego).  I was changed forever.  But, the bar was set high.

Thankfully, Rubio's is an authentic fish taco maker.  It is a chain, and is similar to Baja Fresh and other ""Fresh Mex grills"", but with one glaring exception, and that is their fish taco.  The others make fish tacos, but Rubio's has mastered the art.

Having a Rubio's so conveniently located in the food court at the Monte has made one of my more well-liked casinos to become a preferred casino.  The routine is that I go in the back, right to the food court, have a DELICIOUS taco dinner (2 fish and one ""street"" taco, with some fresh salsas, and a soda to wash it down), and then hit their casino for some great gambling at lower minimums than most of the strip.

But the food is a no-brainer.  Inexpensive, easy, quick (relatively), and ever so delicious, the Rubio's at the Monte Carlo is one that I visit several times on each trip I make to Las Vegas.  So well worth it.",-qg0Mkfmchibl47MjGlIBA,3,2,5,yllla33G2Sxrp93zH2Q40Q

1293712,2016-09-10,0,5Mp-PD_CUaPoJr6CP-WBdA,"Lunch time. Satisfactory for fast food. Citrus rice and black beans were lukewarm. Probably sitting under a warmer, but they hadn't reached a point where you can tell they've sat a long time. 

I added cilantro and onion mix to dress up citrus rice and make tastier than the plain presentation. 

The black beans were satisfactory. What can I say? I'm not a big fan of black beans, but they came with the meal.

I ordered the enchilada special which included one shrimp and one chicken. Both came with some cheese inside, the chicken for sure and I think the shrimp too. I say yes because I tasted very little shrimp and a lot of something else which I'm assuming was cheese.

The enchilada corn tortilla was not soft, a tad firm not representing a good enchilada and not to my liking. It tasted as if they rolled the enchilada and cold tortilla, warmed it and served. The amount of chicken and shrimp were minimal, but lots of cheese to add to your your fat and cholesterol. Towards the end I unrolled the hard tortilla and picked out the meat leaving an abundance of cheese. Yes, lots of cheese and imo not good cheese. 

I'm giving two stars only because I skipped breakfast and having late lunch. I was hungry and many times food tastes better than it is. I don't know why I tortured myself eating unhealthy.

Did I finish my plate? No.

I can't even figure of the physics of how that much breading and batter can stick onto the small fish filet without falling off.  Also, the oil tasted old - it had a bad aftertaste.  They did get an extra star for the kid's meal though.  We ordered the quesadilla meal for my DS and he really liked it.

Their burritos are my favorite. I love their tortillas and their pinto beans. I normally get the kids meal because the regular sized burrito is way too big for me. Their chips are delish...sometimes they need a little salt. If you can make it to dessert then get their churros. They are bomb! Oh and they have a nice little salsa bar with a variety of different salsa and sauces. If you get a soda with your meal then you can get free refills (which is unheard of for a casino!).

Besides burritos they also have street tacos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas. I have heard fabulous things about their fish tacos. Also, they serve breakfast! OMG their bacon, egg and cheese breakfast burrito is to die for. They don't skimp either, that thing is jam packed with all the goods. Yum yum!",Z6sMdVaYrFoAOL-Kbc7b3Q,7,3,5,Eqh7WFptmhulur7xYkWYFA

Even though it is placed in the Monte Carlo food court if you are a fish taco lover as my husband and I are then check out Rubio's! Don't knock it until you try it.
