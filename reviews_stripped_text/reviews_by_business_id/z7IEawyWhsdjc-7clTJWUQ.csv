First, the restaurant is very bright and clean and seems very well maintained. I've been here when it's been extremely busy as well as nearly empty, and regardless the food always comes quickly. 

The nicest thing about this particular IHOP though is how friendly and wonderful the staff is. So kind and welcoming and it makes a typical breakfast experience really enjoyable.

As far as breakfast: the ""over easy"" eggs I ordered were more ""pan fried for 2 minutes GOO"" than egg, paired with undercooked bacon. I'm grateful the hash browns were edible. I also decided, my better judgement, to try a new item: Cinnamon Sugar twice baked French toast (or something like that). Basically regular French toast with cinnamon sugar with an added oatmeal/cornflake crust. Let me save you: don't bother. I cut into the toast and the entire middle on both pieces was mush. Not cooked AT ALL. The special ""crust""? I might have seen one oatmeal flake. Very disappointing. I didn't eat but one bite of it and the waitress took it away without a word. Awesome.

First, we were seated without any utensils or napkins, so when the coffee was delivered, I had nothing to stir my coffee with. 

As we were waiting for our food, I saw the bus person wiping down the table, seat, then onto wiping the next table...

My omelette looked more scrambled than omlette, and the fruit bowl looked old. The edges of the fruit pieces were rounded from being kept long after being sliced. It was NOT fresh at all! Just to test, I took a bite of honeydew melon, and I was right. Stale taste!

My husband ordered T-bone steak and eggs. He said the steak had the taste of being kept in the freezer for too long. He asked for medium and received near well done. We didn't want to be they're any longer than necessary, so we said nothing.

So I cancel and re-call them. Then a lady answered and took my order in less than a minute. So I get there around 11:12am(usually only takes 10 minutes). I walk up and tell, Carlos, the guy at the desk I'm here for pick up. He totally ignores me and seats some people. I wasn't mad, I was pissed. So 5 minutes later a lady comes to the front and asks me why I'm just standing there. lol I tell her pick up and she says my food isn't ready. So what do I do cry, yell, complain....nah I pay for my food and I just sit down. Guess who's in the kitchen chit chatting.....CARLOS!!!!!! I wanted to take a picture but that would be kind of creepy. I got my food until 11:30am. That was 40 minutes after I called them the first time. Luckily I inhaled my food trying to get back to work so I did eat my lunch. Food was okay, but I'm just disappointed on how Carlos probably was the one who put me on hold and just bounced once I got there to pick up my food. I felt discriminated, shamed, angry, maybe because I was wearing a painted shirt either way I didn't feel like a valued customer who's been here more than 50 times maybe even more than 100 times....",CtZuWMG8HAfHpqaMRIb0iQ,0,0,2,lG7LRPAQaWtaCV7Chcuhkw

Actually, I am not a fan of IHOP for meals other than breakfast, but I also don't want a 20 minute discussion on where to eat, so I took a left into the parking lot.

OK, I will admit I was wrong. We were there between the lunch and dinner hours so seating was immediate. Our waiter brought the drinks right away and took our order promptly. We both ordered Patty Melts, and the cooking time was fast.

The real shock was that the food was good. Not just good, but really good. Not only was it really good, it actually looked like the picture on the menu. I have to say I was impressed with this IHOP and would not hesitate to return.

4 stars, losing one because the entire time we were there all the tables from the lunch rush remained dirty. Yeah, it didn't really effect the meal, but it was no pleasure to look at.",Jql0kDX77dWUZcRzGjPXLg,1,1,4,r_TsABPNu6Qm9y5vYLE4rg

I was last in Las Vegas a couple of years ago. I didn't manage to review a bunch of places that I had visited. It happens when there is a ton to explore in Vegas!

On Independence Day, I was watching the fireworks at the Stratosphere. My friend flew in from Denver. I headed over to the airport after the fireworks were over and traffic started to decongest. 

After picking her up at arrivals, we headed over to this IHOP for a bite to eat. We both hadn't had dinner.

I wanted pancakes. I saw the cinnamon roll ones on the menu and knew that I wanted to have them. I also got scrambled eggs, sausage links, and hashbrowns. 

I loved the pancakes. They had a decent cinnamon flavour. They were yummy with maple syrup. 

My eggs and sausage were delicious. I have never been huge on hashbrowns. I don't like them super crispy, so I left the crispy parts and ate everything else. 

This place was fairly quiet at midnight. The food is decent for this hour. It's what you expect at an IHOP.
