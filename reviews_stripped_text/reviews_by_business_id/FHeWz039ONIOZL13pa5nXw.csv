He invited us to several events before hand to be able to try the different menu items, took a special order for my Fiancé for the night of our event and had that prepared first and he comped our meal when we had our consultation. 
We would recommend Dazzling Bistro to any and everyone! All of our guests were so happy with the food and the service, plus we all had so much fun just experiencing having a food truck!

I was able to meet Chef Darnell, and he is so charming. He took the time to tell me about each menu item.

He then came into the brewery and started to yell out peoples names.....he didn't know where they were sitting either so why couldn't he grab my order?

A fantastic food truck, Chef Darrell & a fantastic location, Khoury's liquor store.  Issa, at Khoury's said that the Dazzling Bistro Food Truck comes by a couple times a month.  Good to know cause I'd really like to try more like the Gumbo & Rice bowls I read about.  

My friend & I first grabbed a six-pack of Franziskaner Hefeweizen which paired well w/ Chef Darrell's creations.  

Our order was slightly mixed up, but no problem, Chef brought us an Old Bay seasoned, Spicy Shrimp Taco.  It said w/ Blue Chips, but it came w/ a salad & all three items we got were on a Hoagie Roll.  It worked well as a sandwich, instead of a taco too.  We took off one bun from each order & then could really taste the elements of each sandwich.  I loved this spicy shrimp & slaw creation!  It had a nice kick of Sriracha & garlic aioli which I love!

The Thai Style Beef Satay Tri-Tip was a strip of Beef Satay On a Hoagie topped w/ a nice sweet cucumber, carrot salad.  I really liked the sweet sauce on top of it & it would also be great as a salad!  

My fav was the Smoked Pork Belly Banh Mi On a Hoagie, topped w/ coleslaw & pickled onions & cilantro!  I should've taken one to-go so will have to hope that it's on the menu next time.  If not, I am very excited to try what is on the menu next time this Dazzling Bistro Food Truck is at Khoury's.  Thank you Chef.  I love spicy, it was a wonderful experience & very tasty creations.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,8,4,4,ZsUu5yK2BifiKFv0FFrQSg

Menu planning was a breeze.  I could not WAIT for them to get here that day.  Had I known just how amazing the food was going to be ahead of time - I would have been even more excited!

They arrived on time and set up - and then the magic happened.  Beautiful plates of food started appearing out of this truck.  EVERYONE at the event loved the food.  I did not hear even one negative comment.  I personally had a brisket slider that was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. 

If I could - I would stalk this food truck to all of his events.  That's how amazing this was. 

For dessert we'd planned a white peach cobbler.  All of the piglets that work in my shop snarfed up all of the peaches before I could get one.  I must have looked crestfallen when Chef Darnell told me, because a week after our event he showed up with a serving of peach cobbler and a plate of pork sliders.  The look of sheer envy on the face of the shop guys as I waltzed by with my surprise lunch was totally worth the week's wait.

If you are looking to hire catering for an event,  DO NOT hesitate - this is your go-to.  We will meet again, Chef Darnell.  I look forward to our tasty reunion!",ssxtocJRR6M2cxO0ciOzlQ,2,0,5,qldyNYZ_fiZ77bRWGwyj4w

The service was very friendly and the food came out pretty fast. We both ordered the philly cheese steaks and the bread was awesome. Perfect food after a couple beers. The only thing that threw me off a bit sad how the meat was cut.

3207410,2016-06-25,0,FHeWz039ONIOZL13pa5nXw,"We have been fans of Darnell Harness, the chef from Dazzling Bistro, for several months now.  I therefore turned to Darnell as I was to host a pre-family reunion reception dinner at our home and I needed a high quality caterer. I had about 58 family members, all with different food preferences. Darnell took great care to provide menu options and to explain the importance of offering light small plates in the context of very hot weather and the possibility that some may be swimming and may need to avoid heavy meals. 
There were indonesian pork satays with a very creative non-peanut sauce, which were the best I have ever had. We enjoyed mini chicken cashew sliders on olive buns. There was a grilled corn and crab salad with raspberries, some portobello sandwiches with provolone on the most dreamy brioche bun, marinated green bean salad with toasted sesame, and macerated seasonal berries with basil and mint which were cool and refreshing.  I am telling you that all of my family members, barring none, approached me to explain how much they loved the different foods. Some of these individuals have extremely high expectations and it was so gratifying to have others recognize what I have known for a while now: Darnell is truly gifted. Darnell delivered a platter of food at a time, so that individuals who arrived early could get started, and the amount of food was incredible.

It was smelling so good all around the truck like Cajun spicy scent. The smell made me hungry and I was ready to eat.
Chef Darnell is such a fun person to talk to. Everyone around the truck was enjoying conversation with him. He said they change menus for occasions. He's from Louisiana so Cajun food is what he's specialized in.
Everything on the menu looked good but chef Darnell recommended Southwest Chicken Tacos so I decided to try that.
The food came out pretty quick.
My Southwest Chicken Taco was delicious!! The chicken was peppery spicy and coleslaw inside was crisp, not overly mayonnaised. 
It was $9.99 but the portion wasn't big. 
They are on Roaming Hunger so it's easier to spot them.

4107110,2016-11-13,3,FHeWz039ONIOZL13pa5nXw,"I was curious after seeing the 5 star review as to whether this was truly a diamond in the rough. Well, they're definitely polished.

Dazzling Bistro was one of many local food trucks at the 4th annual run of Sunset Park'd, and my friends and I walked up near the end of our busy lunch session. They have a somewhat eclectic menu that draws inspiration from several regions and countries (and doesn't misspell ""banh mi""). It looks like they often (or always) change up their menu; had I known, I would've tried to find stomach space for more food.

However, I just went along with my friend and tried some of his order. The ""Thai"" Coconut Curry Chicken Rice Bowl ($9.99) didn't resemble any Thai curry that I've had (and it wasn't spicy in the least), but there was certainly a strong yet balanced coconut milk flavor. The chicken was exceptionally well-treated, marinated and grilled, thinly sliced but still moist and tender, and present in sufficient quantity for every bite. The onions and red bell peppers were  delicious. I wasn't expecting a chef working out of a food truck to care so much about the chicken, which is normally a dull protein.

After this brief experience, I'm really looking forward to trying more of Dazzling Bistro's creations. I'll definitely have more room in my belly next time, so my fingers are crossed that they come back soon to Henderson or to nearby parts of Las Vegas.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,6,4,4FT2Q4xR1YE9eWK2ND16gQ
