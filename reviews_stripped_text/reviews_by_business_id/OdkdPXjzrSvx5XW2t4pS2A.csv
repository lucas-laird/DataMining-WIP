It's definitly a texture changer when it comes to sushi. I think I have only had taht but its enough to make me stop and get it as an appirizer.",n5kvsYIIPUVrARu0pkaazQ,0,0,4,PhcWrYAg2FzXQlzxJGuroA

The sandwhich had Thai style chicken with a sweet chili sauce and components similar to daikon. The bread itself was suppose to be toasted but was very soft. Not a big deal but a crispy baguette would have definitely made a difference. The Jalapeño fries were just meh. The tasted like regular fries with a few jalapeños on top, there was no hint of ranch seasoning but they made have helped. I want to try more from this truck, maybe next month at first Friday",L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,2,0,3,AvawFdumPVGVi_kqhsg2Dw

Formerly the Flying Monkey Truck, the Robo Duck Truck has the same fusion menu and font/color design. I'm pretty sure it has the same menu too. When I saw them at the Sunset Park'd food truck festival today, I knew I had to get the Taco-nauts again.

The Taco-nauts ($5) are four pieces of crispy wonton, each topped with a bed of sushi rice, a chunk of grilled miso salmon, and a drizzle of spicy mayo and eel sauce. I thought the food came out a little cold, but the flavor was still as good as I remember it from last time. This is a great appetizer and a treat to share between friends, so if you see them at a food truck gathering, stop here first.

Perhaps I'll finally try another of their offerings next time. Kurobuta udon sounds nice because kurobuta is always a treat.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,3,1,4,u2x5zDhgmHSWXbnxPeEVhg
