While we didn't need a reservation, due to a large party (20+) if we had arrived any later we would have had to wait or sit at the bar.  Since the bar looked nice, had plenty of seating and had one plasma tv, the bar would have been acceptable.

Atmosphere in the room was very nice: upscale but unpretentious.

We were brought bread which was ok, but nothing special. Skipping the appetizers this evening, we jumped right into the main event:

A bow tie pasta with garlic and eggplant dish: Nothing extraordinary but edible. Would we get it again? No.

A double bone veal chop with roasted potatoes (special): This was excellent! The veal chop was perfect and the potatoes were just crispy enough to make me want more.

Dessert: The Spumoni Pie looked tempting but was a little disappointing.  The cream puffs, however, were outstanding and should be a featured item. 

Service: Could have been better. Slow and not very attentive. Perhaps partially due to the large party, but definitely could use some improvement.

Will we go back? Despite the mixed reviews, we will be back to try another pasta dish, possibly get the veal chop again if available, but definitely to get the cream puffs. The restaurant is also known for fresh seafood, which needs to be tried (and reviewed here).",tyPhJy0OMJqf9k9Xzck3uA,0,0,3,GsZmm19yVeCah77sygn3hA

The waiter irritated me immediately by leading us to a small table when other couples were seated at larger tables.  I told him a larger table would be where I would be sitting this evening.  We were served warm, but industrial Italian bread followed by cups of pasta fagioli brimming with beans, but not much else including flavor.  My wife ordered the eggplant Parmigianino that was virtually tasteless and accompanied by a terrible marinara.  I cast my lot with the penne with chicken and spinach in a pink sauce.  Blah, blah, double blah.  Our waiter continued to earn his paltry gratuity by failing to check back with us to see how we were enjoying our meal or if the water glasses needed replenishing.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,0,0,1,mCiWtKATncmPwoQmx1FuyA
