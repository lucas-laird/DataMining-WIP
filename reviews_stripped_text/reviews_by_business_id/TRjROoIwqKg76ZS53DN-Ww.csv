29953,2010-09-20,0,TRjROoIwqKg76ZS53DN-Ww,"Well after eating so many times at this place I decided to finally write a review.

The good: I usually go to this Robertos for a late night snack, trough the drive thru  and order the Carne Asada Fries,  more bang for your buck, with taxes it comes out to $8.63. Now i'm a picky eater so I only get the fries, Carne Asada, and the cheese.  It  always taste great and the people working the drive trough are always courteous. 

The bad: The only thing i periodically dislike is that I don't think they have a set standard of how much stuff they put on your plate/container. Usually I'll get lucky and get great amounts of Carne Asada, Cheese and Fries. A couple of times though the guy making them (it's always a guy) gives me good amounts of beef but will skimp out on the fries and the Cheese. I llike my cheese! lol. 

The ugly: I think the owner is hella (west coast slang there) cheap. Since we started visiting this Robertos, the drive true speaker has been broken. You usually can't understand the person taking the order, and many times the person taking the order has told us to drive directly to the window were you pay to take our order. I think I've visited 15 times this year, and it still hasn't been fixed.  Also I dislike the whole "" pay one extra dollar to use a debit/credit card"" their website says they have 65 locations total, I think they can go without that extra ""one dollar fee/surcharge"" 

I would have given the ""taco shop"" a five if it wasn't for the chepness and the irregularity of the carne asada to cheese to fries ratio. The taste of the food and the service does give them a solid 4 in my book. I still recommend this place.",Mxiz8rV43IIRq0JvFluJPA,1,0,4,vgImXI8H8hzRoiUGWu4YcA

Not just any Roberto's, it has to be the one on Eastern only. Only here do they really know how to make a great steak enchilada or burrito at four in the morning. Apparently this isn't a secret though, because everytime I arrive, fully hungry (and fully loaded) there is always a wait...but hey, it's a small price to pay for perfection.",HaPtQKTZmtIDjyKzjaCmqA,1,2,5,yk8wikxFmgxdRFlKR1nBDw

1598646,2018-03-19,0,TRjROoIwqKg76ZS53DN-Ww,"This location is iffy... It's a hit or miss... Roberto's is decent food but like I said a hit or miss.

Last year I was going to write a review about the service and go into detail about how poor it was. Then they got new people and it became better.

Lately it's been GREAT service but the quality of the food has adjusted.

My ""go to"" when I come to Roberto's is either: the Chile relleno burrito, breakfast burrito, carne asada fries, shredded beef chimichanga or the carne asada quesadilla.

The only one they haven't fucked up (yet... lol) is the quesadilla... if that goes to shits I might have to make a trip to the one on Lamb Haha... 

Anyway... their portions have gotten smaller. Maybe they're trying to cut portion costs? Who knows but they've gotten smaller.

My biggest thing that's been bugging me, why I decided to write this review (and most likely who would actually read a Roberto's review but why not)

The Chile relleno burrito. The pepper hasn't been cleaned out properly. They take the stem off but the inside still has A SHIT LOAD OF SEEDS. 

That's about it...",NMQtnyYFjUjJqW3e51oTTQ,0,0,3,BeIvt9JqOe58PfapUhDGzQ

After ordering and not getting a total, I pulled up to the window to pay- several people came and left inside. The cashier even came to the window register at one point, and after looking at me, put money in a letter envelope and then walked away. After over 10 minutes at the window without even an acknowledgment, my lunch was over and I had to leave without any food. 

At least I didn't have a chance to pay, I suppose. But definitely won't be going back to this location.",HeoolPKjgiQkXMRlJxp0-w,0,0,1,4nDLJgieA0JMUv4SXMNuJQ

Also they were cleaning the bathrooms with a whole lot of Fabuloso and it did not make me feel fabulous at all! I wanted to puke! I just couldn't eat a burrito and smell that at the same time.

Anything on the menu is good but the longer you wait in the day the less fresh everything seems. I have worked in many restaurants and at some who didn't prepare everything fresh for the day and this place is one of them.

The salsa bar was ehhh ok...I guess...But I just couldn't get over how half assed their tacos were. For a place that calls themselves a ""Taco shop"", I expected a helluvalot more.

To be honest with you it's not really someplace I would normally turn into or would going to eat because it's kind of in a bad neighborhood and it doesn't look like it would be one of my favorite spots from the outside. 

I pulled up to the window and gave my order to the woman in the drive-through. She was nice enough, nothing to really write home about. When they handed me my bag of food I swear it weighed about a pound and a half. I was NOT EXPECTING THAT!

I ordered a beef burrito... Nothing fancy no extras and no subtractions. It came with a few napkins fresh red sauce and fresh green sauce. This thing was the most amazing Barito I literally have ever eaten in my life!

The tortilla was fresh in the meet was fresh there was no fat in it it was layered and layered and layered with flavor there wasn't too much beans and rice and all of that filler.

There are constanly people around this location that look suspicious. 

The trash bins and bathrooms were or perhaps still are filled with graffiti.

I had the $0.99 chicken tacos, and they were atrocious. They mask some horrible food with cheap prices. If you go to the location on Durango, the tacos taste fresh and crunchy not stale and flavorless.

My friend ended up getting a carne asada burrito and was on point so maybe the next time I come in the food will be better and the restaurant will look cleaner.

The staff was pretty much on point but that can't compensate for bad food.
