I was only disappointed with the Caesar Salad, not because it tasted bad but because lettuce and croutons are not worth 7 bucks.

You enter a dark tiny room maybe the size of a little closet, 4 or 5 people maybe, ring a bell, and wait for your doom. Really felt like the beginning of a horror movie, and no one knew I was here. 

A nice maybe elderly lady, blame the lighting, greeted and helped me out with the menu, lunch specials, and time it took to finish. They have a pretty good menu at reasonable prices from pizzas, calzones or strombolis, ribs, pastas, gyros, salads, subs, wraps, burgers, chickens, and more. Breakfast lunch and dinner. 

I ordered the 16"" one topping pizza (Italian sausage) for $7.95. Tasted pretty good I have no complaints. The crust wasn't thick like Chicago or thin like NY but was OK. Didn't take a long time to make maybe 10-15 mins, all good sat in the bar area watching sports on the numerous flat screens. 

I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu. I really didn't want to copy and paste the entire menu so you can find it here http://www.usmenuguide.com/expresspizzamenu.html",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,1,0,4,-GHHqc-Thgx9qLbM1vc8Lw

2509120,2012-12-16,2,sZ3AWH6WPq38fEKijvl9vA,"I'll be honest, when I opened my front door and saw their menu laying on the ground I figured this was just another run of the mill pizza joint that would only cater to my late night drunk escapades when my taste buds have no sense of right or wrong.

To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. I mean you can't have high expectations for a place named Express Pizza. Another confession, I""ve never tried the pizza (next on my list of things). 

So here's how much I like this place...I tried one of their lunch specials on a Saturday, seven days later I've eaten them two additional times. That's how friggin good it was. 

This place has a variety of lunch specials available 7 days a week. Major points their for not limiting their deals to midweek. First time up I tried the Lasagna lunch special after asking the lady taking my order if that was a good choice. She advised me that I ""wouldn't be disappointed."" I wasn't. The sauce was terrific, pasta cooked perfect, just the right amount of cheese. And for $6.50 it included a canned soda and piece of garlic bread (which was great for dipping). Next time out I ordered the Gyro (since my wife said it was amazeballs when she ordered it for lunch). Outstanding. PIta was so fresh, meat was filled with flavor. Tuh-zee-kee sauce, because I have no friggin clue how to spell that mess of a word, was awesome! I'm not a french fry guy, but theirs were seasoned perfectly and I ate a load of those. Third time up I ordered the Lasagna for dinner which included a salad. 

Had I ordered the food when I was drunk I probably would have wrote Mr. Michelin himself and requested he consider this place. Instead, I'll just call it an outstanding hole in the wall delivery joint located inside the Bounty Hunter bar. Two giant thumbs up.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,2,5,Gf2r_tzRfX3CfmBjHJmMyg

There wasn't much cheese on my lasagna and not much inside and I felt the portion was very small compared to other restaurants. The side salad was typical for this type of place so no complaints there, and the garlic bread was really good. Just how I like it, lots of butter, not over baked or burnt, and soft.

They made sure to give me the best special available without me asking. Who doesn't enjoy saving some coin. The portion sizes are large and well worth any money you'll spend.

The pizza was flavorful and had really fresh ingredients. The spaghetti was tasty but needed a little bit of parmesan. However the meatballs were perfect as is.

I order delivery a lot, so I try to kinda mix it up on grub hub. Well, I forgot that I had actually ordered stromboli from these guys once before and it was terrible. As soon as I bit into my stromboli tonight, I immediately remembered how bad it was the last time and knew I was out $20 again. Before I get into the specifics of the food, let me state that this place is 1.4 miles from my house according to grubhub and it still takes them 55 minutes to get here (which would be ""whatever"" if the food was cooked, more on that in a second). I do want to say the delivery guy is super nice, always thanks me when I include a tip online. Really nice kid. That's pretty much the last positive thing I'm going to say in this review. 

So, back to the food. The stromboli was EXTREMELY undercooked, like, still doughy undercooked, and the taste, I can only equate to being a ridiculously high amount of yeast in the crust, or just flat out mold on one of the ingredients. I think it was the former, which is the lesser of two evils, but still left me doubled over praying to the toilet within 10 minutes or so. It wasn't even JUST the crust that had that flavor. After a few bites of that, I tried just ripping it apart and eating the meat out of the middle and just everything had that taste: the cheese, the meat. It was literally inedible. I threw it away after forcing down about 5 bites. Then proceeded to get sick. I still have the taste in my mouth. 

Check your dough recipe's guys, and if the crust is still white and mushy that means you didn't cook it long enough! I'll stick to sandwiches if I order from them again, and that's a big if.",AiKpcP8srJ2saZHzT6Ammg,3,0,2,vxClRsaHFaAr6f_7cOTAvw

The bf began searching the late delivery website and found this place.  $2 delivery charge.  We expected another random late night junk food take out place meant for people too drunk to know the difference.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I ordered the Gyro and a side of spaghetti for our son.  Bf ordered Philly Cheesesteak and fries and fried zucchini.  The side salad actually came separately in a different bag, not wilted as feared.  They gave us plenty of ranch and blue cheese dressing without extra charge.  The Gyro was pretty good, came on fresh pita bread.  The spaghetti was ok.  The bf enjoyed his food.  The website had saved the address of the last hotel we had food delivered too over a year ago and no one had called to verify so the delivery guy was lost at a different location...he was a good sport about it while the female owner called to blame us for our mistake.  Decent food, and if we decide to order from them again, we will definitely remember to update our address!  For being such a good sport, we gave the guy and extra tip on top of the delivery fee.",p3rQEm0gp2UsR4Rwh6FirA,1,1,4,8QW50YSXbZcFtrLHRYUgrA

Their pizza is pretty tasty, but what always keeps me coming back is their Burgers and Fries. Very juicy burger, with a good size helping of some tasty fries. Also, the delivery person that they usually send is a very nice guy, very polite, too. The only downside I have come across is their wings. They do not add any sauces or seasonings, which isn't that big of a deal to me, but might be to other customers. Love this place!",gGiDOiOB3IKkQvldLYDV6w,0,0,4,wtHxC-ggYnOV-WhVqYXMmA

We always have it delivered and it is still hot when we receive it. There is enough food in the meal that we have leftovers for days! So yummy and the staff is super nice. :)",xLr0KUQ0wlFP6FuxHir0PQ,0,0,5,k2YUW8-Hk2ZTeoh9AcHFuA

They gave me this place. Seems to be located in The Bounty Hunter bar. 
My review is solely on the food. Even though the lady on the phone wasn't the nicest, I felt like i had to go out of my way to be nice to her so she can be nice in return. Hate when i have to do that fake shit.

The price wasn't bad at all around 12 dollars for a large cheese only. 
Got a small order of wings , seems they come with fries. Total was 24.00
They are close to me and the price isn't high. That really didn't matter though because the pizza was very bland. The cheese had no taste. Pizza gets eaten within a day at this house, and pretty much the whole thing is still left over from the night before. 
No taste at all... Like at all... Tastes like bread with cheap cheese on it, plastic cheese.
The wings weren't anything special, I hate when they aren't cooked thoroughly and that squishy fat part is still on them. Fries a bit soggy.

Sucks cause its close to me, they deliver late, and the price isn't bad. But the food quality is why the prices are so low. Too good to be true. Back to getting my late night pizza from Putters.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,4,2,2,uKrxBefCYJ-7XwQMKa7wRg
