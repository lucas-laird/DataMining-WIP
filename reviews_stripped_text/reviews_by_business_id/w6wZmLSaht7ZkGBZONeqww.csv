Seems like it would be a hit after a night of drinking, though.

All specialty dogs are $4. I guess that's not ridiculous, like White Castle's Strip price markup, but note that NY locations price the dogs lower and it varies by dog, which makes sense given the variety of ingredients. Plus this location isn't even on the Strip, so...?

Their slogan is, ""It's all about the snap!"" and mine didn't have much. The Pig in Da Blanket, with cheese, bacon, and grilled peppers, was okay, but not something I'd go out of my way for.

I went there almost at 10pm at night and the staff were really nice.  They wanted to make sure that I was greeted and they were ready to help me out. 

The cashier person was helping me out because I asked him what was so good about their hotdogs and which one should I choose?  He suggested for me to try out the Grand Slam Combo because I was able to choose from their specialty hotdog section.  I let him know that I wasn't so hungry for bigger hotdogs with lots of stuff so he suggested the King Combo and because I wanted chili he stated that I can substitute it from my Combo. 

Since from the time I came in to their store,I felt that the facility, staff, and food were all great to me.  So I've never had this place because it was made only in NYC where it's popular their and I've never been there YET. 

So after I received my meal, the amenities were located in many areas of the store to make it easier for customers to go and eat. Plus the food was served quickly. I like that the fact they were quick and they asked me if there's anything else that I needed. That's good service.

Were the dogs good? Most definitely.

This place does have a little complicated menu but I believe, in time, it will be very easy. It is just different then what people are used to ( including me )

I ordered the number 6 which is either two specialty dogs or three regular ones, drink, and fries.

I got two specialty dogs. The upper east side and the bulls eye. Both were bomb dot com

Oh, and the papaya drink was perfect to wash down such a tasty meal. 

Curly fries were good. 

People were really friendly. Except for one customer that was complaining that the dog wasn't centred on the bun. I thought he was joking at first but he wasn't. He started lecturing the kid about putting the dog on the bun right. I'm thinking he must've been an owner or investor but super unprofessional to do in front of everyone if he was. 

Place was good and people were nice. It would be a shame if that guy is the owner because I will not patronage a place where the owner lectures his employees in front of everyone.

What arrived was DISAPPOINTING the hot dog (small, like you, would get, buying at the grocery store) was smothered in a red sauce/onions. I guess the papaya sauce is supposed to be the key of this New York City eatery. This is their first outlet west of the Mississippi.

What I noticed right away was there were only about 10 hot dogs on the flat top where in NYC I was used to seeing about 100 cooking at once all day everyday, but being off the strip on Paradise Rd there is barely any foot traffic so I understand why they don't keep too many hot dogs cooking at once.

The food was just as bad. I took one bite of an Original hot dog with NY Onions & it was disgusting. The NY Onions were drenched in a sweet tomato sauce. This was my first time trying a meat hot dog in years & best believe it'll be my last (until I get tempted again.) Fried Twinkie was covered in a nice pancake batter; sweet & heavy, as expected.

There's 8 of us and we walk in to a smallish line. Basically 3 sets of people in front of us. In NYC there's a line out the door and it gets handled super fast. I will make a long story short and say it looks like the one in NYC but it is operated terribly. It was just before dinner time, like 5pm and they were out of fries and pastrami and sweet potatoes. They didn't have any dogs on the flat top which looked to be off the entire time we were there. The service was so slow that people before us asked for their money back and another set of people started complaining that they didn't tell them there were no fries when they ordered a combo. I knew it was about to be a disaster so i suggested we cancel and get our money back, but my family said we're already here. I thought maybe they're making the food in the back because no one was cooking. One person was at the register and the other was consolidating mayonnaise. Finally, after people started complaining they started making our order but it came out all haphazard. And they kept asking us what we ordered when they had our order on a screen. They brought some dogs and then some others then after we had the dogs they brought out the sides one by one so that my family was eating random tater tots after their hot dogs were finished. For some reason my hot dog came after the oreos so we just boxed up the rest and left. I was so excited to take my family to see the place i loved in New York and this was so depressing.

3391689,2017-07-07,4,w6wZmLSaht7ZkGBZONeqww,"Move along, nothing to see or eat here....
I was in the area of the Hard Rock hotel in Las Vegas today and today was the day to try out Papaya King for hot dogs and the highly touted Papaya drinks. Oh cool, the ""King Combo"" has two dogs, curly fries and a drink for $9. Well I order and the guy taking the order is new and doesn't quite know the menu, I order the king combo and he asks me which one that is from the picture menu, I point it out and get one hot dog with the sour kraut and one with some kind of tomato topping, then it come with curly fries and a drink, I order the standard papaya drink because it sounds different and I had to see what it was all about, then I step aside and wait for my order. 
Some lady was behind me in line and orders food too and a few minutes later a tray with two hot dogs, that looks like what I ordered comes out to the counter and so does fries and a drink. The lady serving the food doesn't call out a number or name, just puts the tray out for someone to get. Well without me knowing the lady that ordered after me grabs the tray and is off. I'm thinking that sure looked like what I ordered, but I'm not sure.
Then, I'm thinking my food was swiped out from under me! Soon I hear, whos drink is this? (Mango), well sure enough the lady took my papaya drink and my food and was already sitting down and eating it. Then they ask me what my order was and I said, ""it looks like that lady is eating it"". They are like duuuuh???? and ask me if I ordered the mango drink, I said ""no, that lady is drinking it, I ordered the papaya"" again a look off duuuuh?
Well they finally realize that my order was being comsumed by someone else and I finally get me food. I find a seat and the overall experience is not too good. There is nothing special here and as some of the other reviewers were saying they liked the hot dogs because they had a ""snap"" to them when they took a bite, well sure enough one of the two dogs did have a noticeable ""snap"", but am I lucky or what? it's just a rubber hot dog and nothing really outstanding. The curly fries are the same machine extruded ones you can get at the Checkers on the same corner lot. The great papaya drink tastes like the remnants of a watered down orange julius and is not all that. 
I also saw 3 people in a group order some food with different topping and the workers behind the counter didn't label the foil wrappers, so this group of 3 diners had to ask which is which and the counter people had to unwrap each one to take a peek inside because they didn't know either, the wrappers are not marked as to what toppings are inside.
I'm suprised that they didn't have a system down for all that since the place has been open or a while know. I hope the hot dog gods will have mercy on these workers there since I am sure one day they will have a large group of tourists arrive and I am sure they will fail in a big way because they don't have a basic system in place to run the business properly.

I liked their franks!  They have this really good snap to them when you take a bite.  And I loved the Papaya Tropical Drink!  It was really sweet and refreshing and pairs so well with the hot dogs.

Hot Dogs, Good 
Fresh Juices, Delicious. 

I will say that I have not been a fan of the ways, that a lot of these east-coast-style spots are coming to Vegas. In regards to overall execution - it's sufficient but I've been underwhelmed by recent transplants in the last few years. On the higher end side of dining , and the casual side - the gameplay of these places has been, frustrating to say the least. Service non-existent, clueless staff and inferior food product.

Now comes another Ny, east coast staple. Papaya King was good. I liked it a lot and will be back soon. The Upper East Dog and a Classic Chili dog were both great, served as a combo with curly fries and a papaya coconut juice. It  was excellent. $12 for the combo and full when done. 

The restaurant is small with counter based service. The menu is oddly high on the wall and the lighting is sharp and fluorescent. Overall, I liked it - and I look forward to a hot summer day in Vegas with a fresh and delicious Papaya King juice to cool me off. 

On a similar note - other reviews have mentioned Dog Haus hotdogs across the street. I like Dog Haus a lot as well. This is not Dog Haus. It's not the same concept. Yes it's hot dogs, but it's not the same. Papaya King is something else with different flavor profiles and great juices. Give it a try.

My vegetarian (soy) dogs were somewhat disappointing -- flavorless (could/should have used seasoning at the ok soy-dog factory...) & I think undercooked.

The good news is that the manager said they'll be switching to a new/better type of vegetarian hot dog in the near future, and the manager was very friendly & informative, even after having been on the job for 10+ hours.  Even the hot dog buns seemed to have been sitting out for a couple hours -- not as soft/fresh as I would have liked or expected for the price.

Strip-Mall location at Tropicana & Paradise is rather seedy, especially after dark.  I'm sitting in the corner, sizing-up (oh dear, profiling!) everyone that walks-in.

Place has wifi, but it's secured.  Either just for staff, or customers need to get the password from staff.

A NYC institution since 1932.  The nostalgic remembrance of a NYC local, ""when I was in high school, this was the cheap eats hangout"".

1.  Bone dry buns.  Beyond day old.  Bite and crumble. 

2.  Canned toppings (cheese whiz, ""chili"", fluorescent green relish and pickles, ballpark yellow mustard, not so sour kraut).  

3.  Absolutely nothing special about the dog.  It's no Casper, Miller, oh heck, it's not even Nathan's or Pink's.  Nothing makes it stand out.  No great spice blend, no smoky character, no snappy casing, nothing.  It's just a mystery meat in a tube found at your local ball park.

Lastly, the buns are toasted and mine were good. If it's crumbling that's not good but could be because the place is new and messed up. They should be toasty though and mine were. 

If you want a NY street dog in Vegas it has arrived and I'm happier for it. Plus they are 100% beef",KyWEKfRgOKi0EIJ8RVDhRg,0,0,4,AW0WAR5FTu-DoJ_9z4hghw
