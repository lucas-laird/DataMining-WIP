I just had them cater for a family party and everyone said it was incredible!!

27147,2017-05-26,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Love Plantone's the only reason  for three stars is We haven't worked our way through the whole menu yet. Coming from the east coast (new haven, conn & New York area trust me We know good Italian food) I agree the chicken parm needs more sauce. I am sure they will adjust. After all that is what Yelp is for. Every new restaurant needs a break in period. The staff is always friendly and helpfull.  There isn't a kids menu posted but just ask they will hook you up.
 The best yet is the  Roast Pork Italian. If we eat in or to go no matter what, we get we always get a whole one of these with spinach to go. I will repost as the stars raise above the 5 mark.

We tried the Quattro Formaggio and the Tony Pepperoni and both were great! The sauce is flavorful and perfectly seasoned, using San Marzano tomatoes (the only way to go).  The pepperoni is incredible - large pieces and grilled before being baked on the pizza. A unique selection of cheeses on the Quattro, both interesting and delicious! My only recommendation is they bake the pizza just a little bit longer - the dough is chewy and I like mine a little more crusty.

We went back a few weeks later and tried the Angry Sicilian and meatball sub sandwiches. Both come highly recommended by my son and husband. The tiramisu is definitely worth it!

We were greeted when we got to the counter. Their menu isn't too busy but there is a good amount to choose from. I decided on a slice of pepperoni pizza, I didn't know it would be so big, and chicken parm pasta. Both were really good, the sauce wasn't like what I've had before, it wasn't super runny. The flavor was good and somewhat chunky tomato sauce. You get a good amount of food for what you pay for.",DjKuSpu7WnL-dq6gYBI85A,0,0,5,gj1AgqJCuY2M1lwvj6VWkA
333659,2017-08-20,1,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Curbside Service is NOT as Advertised

Being 8 months pregnant and running errands all day, I was ecstatic when I found out that Plantone's had curbside service. I called in my order ahead of time and the employee who took my order told me to give them a call when I park in the designated curbside parking spots. Upon arriving, I call the same number, and another employee tells me that I have to come in to the restaurant and pay. I was confused because typically an employee comes out to give you your food and obtain payment, thus curbside service. So I ask the employee to clarify as I thought they had curbside service. The employee tells me that typically you have to go in and pay and can choose to sit in your car in the designated spots until the food is complete and they'll bring it out. What's the point of curbside pick up if I have to go in and pay anyways?!?! I might as well just pick up my food when I pay for it, which is what I ended up doing. I voiced my concern when I went in to pay and the two employees at the check out counter were apathetic and didn't have any response for me. This has been my 2nd experience of poor service here.
Being in the restaurant industry for over 20 years, service is a factor for me and I won't be back.",kXMJb_A2QnbA0FuVfkzvUw,0,0,1,ILnq9fay_K_9ZEYF6yCULA

I arrived just as they were opening and was greeted by the owner who invited me right in and it smells amazing inside. The owner is a very personable guy and spoke with every customer that came in and it was apparent he really cared about customer satisfaction (no need to worry though the product could sell it self). Owner is from New York and stays true to that by making authentic Italian food complete with fresh in house made mozzarella.

We ordered Mama's meat lasagna and  pizza verdure la rosti. 

The lasagna was a pretty big portion, however it was just okay. The sauce wasn't ""I'll probably be dreaming about this later"" good but it filled us up.

I wanted to try the pizza verdure la rosti because there was eggplant in it. The pizza was full of other vegetables like squash, zuchini and tomatoes. This combo made the pizza thick and juicy. It was definitely different experience compared to a supreme pizza.

The ambiance of the place was warm and inviting. Loved the decor and the music selection. They're outside dinning section looks nice but we decided to stay nice and cozy inside.",I9jbgQlsz01ZIYUDqWzafw,0,0,3,O891r47QzZMingGYR9tdkQ

1255775,2017-05-11,3,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"I had high hopes for this place since it was soooo close to home and because of how much I love Italian food. 

Experience #1: got off work ordered a sub and asked for no onions and no tomatoes, and spaghetti with meat sauce. 
I got home and realized they didn't get my sandwich right and my pasta was pretty bland. I called and told them about my sandwich being wrong and they told me they would have make me a new one or I could get a credit for another sandwich on my next visit. I figured they were pretty busy and I wouldn't sweat it. Plus I just got a free sammich! Score!!! Thanks and well played management!  

Experience #2: went in for my free sandwich and NO DICE! They weren't having it so I left. 

Experience #3 (5/1017) : it had been a couple months and my mom was interested so I took her. We ordered, took our number and sat. They brought the food and they messed mine up again. They took note of their mishap and sent the Events Coordinator out to speak with me. 

She (Kristin) comes out wearing the same thing everyone else in the kitchen is, doesn't introduce herself and sits down in my moms chair (She went to the restroom) and begins talking like we're friends. My first question was ""who are you?"" And you're in my moms chair. She apologizes at first then says, we don't want you to tell 5 friends about your experience and they tell their friends... blah blah blah.... 
My mom chimes in with a ""I could understand if you guys were packed but you're not even busy"" (like 2 other tables and us). 
They bring my food out again and it's just not good at all. So Kristin comes out again and begins asking me how was it and I was honest. Chicken isn't grilled, sauce doesn't have much flavor other than salt salt and more salt and the sracha sauce was like a mix of sracha and ketchup.  She got offended and told me ""well, I can make you like our food!""  At this point I was like any one in the food industry knows customer service and this was not it. Especially when there are only 2 other tables. Cmon!  She could've offered a different meal or the sandwich I never got. 

Either way this place sucked before sucks now. Who knows about the future. Gave this place 2 chances with three separate experiences. Fail fail fail. If you don't know what ""flavor"" is then you'll be satisfied. If you want flavor then go to Roma Deli 2 (w Sahara/Durango) they don't skimp on the sauce and they speak Italian.

1352466,2017-02-11,2,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"I was recently told about this place by my best friend and I was happy to hear that finally, a place like Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizza by UNLV is now on the southwest side of town. There has not been many good ""family-owned"" style places in town or many at all. Besides Cugino's by UNLV as previously mentioned, Nora's on Flamingo between Jones and Decatur, and Roma Deli on Spring Mountain between Jones and Decatur, I don't think there are many others like them. 

Came here for a small ""in-between meal"" eats after the gym the other day (ssssh don't judge). Conveniently located on Warm Springs, just west of Durango, in the same shopping center as SkinnyFats, it now resides in the previously known Mac Shack location. Décor is pretty nice with TVs mounted on the wall. A ""wall"" rack with ingredients (similar to Cuginos and Roma Deli) most likely used in their own food as well dividing the restaurant from the line to order and the seating area. Decent amount of seating including seating outside. Also some bar seats for those who come here alone and don't wanna take up an entire table yourself. 

Offerings are a bit different than previously mentioned places but has pieces of what the others are popular for as well. They do fresh made pizzas with some specialties as well as building your own. Also cold and hot sandwiches (or build your own as well) and chef's daily specials. Boar's head branded deli meats is no newbie to the Las Vegas market and this place doesn't fail to do so as well. 

Always being one to pick the one with the most stuff, I easily picked the ""Angry Sicilian"" sandwich. The sandwich consists of prosciutto, capicola, soppressata, mortadella, house-made mozzarella topped with roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and drizzled with some extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, and a sprinkle of oregano.... all on your choice of either sesame load, multi-gran loaf, italian loaf, pizza bianca (flatbread), or rye bread. For a small size, it was $9, large $14.95. And of course, I went for the large. (NO I did not eat it all. remember I said small ""in-between meal"" ? I only ate half, saved half for another day. Ive always been a fan of Italian meats over the traditional deli meats (ham, turkey, roast beef, etc) as it brings so much more depth and flavor. Mozzarella is also one of my favorite cheeses ! Light, smooth thick slices of a mild cheese made traditionally with water buffalo milk... Mmm :) Wonder if they sell mozzarella by itself ? Om nom nom hahaha. Overall, super flavorful sandwich which brings memories of my frequent visits to Cugino's when I went to UNLV. a MUST GET if you cant decide on what to get ! 

Cant wait to come here again and try other things ! UNFORTUNATELY ! (boohoo... xD) its so close to EOS gym... HEHE :) and sonics... happy hour half drinks (strawberry limeade...) and suzuya for dessert... LOL XD sssh im a piggy ... 

Ate the leftover sandwich the next day. Still pretty good. As it was already a ""cold"" sandwich, pulling it out of the fridge maybe 15 minutes before eating it made it as good as it was freshly made",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,4,WLe0OaCeZSlZ_b89U8ZLPQ
1367253,2017-03-20,3,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"I was extremely excited to be able to support a small business in my area and have given the business several opportunities to make up for their issues which I initially thought was because it was new but it's going on 3 months since opening and things have only gone downhill in terms of quality and consistency. Don't let the name fool you, this is no italian market. I would be surprised if they even have a slicer on the premises as you cannot buy cured meats or any italian cheeses on site aside from prepackaged items and dry pasta that I'm pretty sure has been there since its grand opening.

Decor is nice. Outdoor seating features fire pits and the interior is a mix of rustic wood and brick. Their brick oven looks impressive--custom designed down to the name of the business--Tony Bolony--but wait, isn't their business called Plantones? A quick google shows Tony Baloneys is a trademarked named business in San Francisco. Perhaps an oversight on their part and a very pricey one.

It's unfortunately another one of those restaurants that makes the mistake of opting to provide both fast food service (go to the counter to order, fill your own drinks etc) with server service. If they wanted to provide a full service dining experience they should just offer it when you walk in. And since you aren't assigned any server in particular food runners get confused since they didn't take your order and don't know where to go or who to look for or who to give the food. More often than not I will get my food before the customers who arrived before me for whatever reason. I guess I'm just lucky? Cashiers are hit and miss--some are just there obviously for the paycheck. No smile no greeting. Just jaded looking teenagers waiting to clock out. Servers have always provided service with a smile--more recently they have been exceptional, the only reason they should get any stars at all.

The actual pizzas are virtually flavorless. The bottoms of pizzas show their lack of cleaning of their oven. Covered in black soot. Perhaps they thought this would add to the flavor of the pizza? It's hard to tell that they were baked in a brick oven pizza as it lacks any flavor hinting towards that. The pepperoni itself is sparse and extremely mild. The grilled chicken also has no seasoning whatsoever and the texture of their mushrooms is miserable--like they boiled or microwaved them and just threw them into storage. Another pizza place which shall remain unnamed has $8 12"" pizzas with unlimited toppings with over 30 to choose from... Plantones (10"" for $10) just can't compare with less than 20 toppings.

Sandwiches are extremely small for the price and NOTHING like the owner posted photos! The meat is sparse and also lack flavor. The chicken parm is a soggy mess and maybe 4 inches long! The italian sausage barely has any seasoning and lacks any spice whatsoever... The meat in the baloney sandwich was completely blackened--no joke! I guess this is what happens when a realtor tries to be a restaurateur. If he wants his business to succeed the restaurant would be better off without him there as he completely lacks customer service skills and seems to have a poor attitude when he is there.",EdHAQPSE0TXFz5u6-5qoVQ,0,1,1,U7SIBF3zlnzkcHVGniqktw
1382809,2018-03-07,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,I tried this place for the first time today and was definitely impressed. I am extremely picky about chicken parmigiana and this sandwich was terrific. It wasn't mostly over cooked breading like a lot of places...it was a nice thick chicken cutlet with just the right amount of breading cooked just right so it wasn't overly crunchy or soggy. The Angry Sicilian was built just right with quality Italian deli meats and fresh mozzarella and the perfect amount of mayo oil and vinegar. I've lived within walking distance of this place for a year now and kept passing it by...I will be adding this to my regular foodie rotation now.,bEf6fcADvn2jGoP5lxaMCw,0,0,4,kwTpPcesG8jLJXcM2AXUPg
1403505,2017-02-08,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Plantone's is good- but I would recommend for lunch or a casual night dinner spot. We live across the street and decided to try it out. Apparently it was the grand opening night so there was a DJ and lots of Italian balloons so we went on a good night. I was hoping that it was a sit-down Italian spot because it was a Friday night and I wanted to relax after a long week. However, Plantone's is more of a quick-order deli where you place your order at the counter, take a number and grab a seat. We had to sit at a bar top because it was so busy- good sign of what was to come, but like I said-I wanted a more relaxing atmosphere!

Another pet peeve is that the wine is served in plain glasses. I know that serving wine in water glasses is the authentic Italian way, but when I spend $8 on a glass on wine- I prefer it to be in a nicer glass. We ordered the eggplant parm sandwich and a Quattro formaggio pizza. Both were tasty- especially the pizza. Thin crust and fresh out of the oven. I could tell that the pizza was made with the freshest ingredients. I also enjoyed the sandwich, but my only suggestion would be to toast the bread-it needed a little crunch.

Overall this place is A-Ok for lunch or if I am looking for a casual week night for some quick and yummy food. Looked like they had a nice outdoor area that I can see myself enjoying during the summer months.

1434998,2017-11-12,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Great family run Italian Deli. Despite the name, it's not a ""Market"" where you're going to find an assortment of Italian goodies. There are a few items on display that from a marketing perspective certainly play to the name, but, it's an Italian Deli / Pizza / Pasta place. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.

Unfortunately, unless I missed it in the store, both the online and in store menus give little indication of the Chicken, Fettuccine, Ravioli, Penne and Spaghetti, with the typical sauces, that are also available.

Based on 2 visits I've found the service friendly and attentive. 

From the Deli the Meatball Sub was solid and the Roast Pork Sub was really good!!! The Pasta Fagoli was good as well.

The Pizza is excellent!!! It's very close to an authentic Neapolitan crust, thin in the middle and a wonderful, thick, chewy crust on the edges.

From the Pasta side we had Ravioli with marinara. The Pasta was good and I loved the marinara sauce!!!

We'll certainly be back.",bBp0fm5w2ssoTS2Pk3ROJw,0,0,4,eaAL33oQi1nGwVMalhaCyA

1448072,2017-01-16,16,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Plantone's is the newest business to hit the south west side- small market, pizza bar, and a massive selection of sandwiches. From the minute you walk in, service is on point! There's a greeter stationed at the entrance to walk you through the menu and make suggestions, along with multiple staff attending to the dining room and checking on customers.

Pizza is available whole or by the slice- and slices are huge! The Paulie's Pesto Chicken was a great choice, with a thin stretched crust and a robust sauce. The Quattro Formaggio was even better for this cheese lover.  Tried the Italian Pork sandwich with broccolini and sharp provolone, and it was hearty and flavorful. Heads up that the au jus makes it a poor choice for takeout, so come try it when you can stick around.

Prices are pretty reasonable for the product and portion. There is patio seating that looks like it'll nearly double their available seating space in warmer months. This was already a busy plaza before they opened, so I imagine parking is only going to get more hectic. Coming back for the Angry Sicilian soon!

EDIT 03/23/2018: A year in, and they're still solid. The Angry Sicilian sando is huge and fresh, while my new fave pizza is their brunch option with scrambled eggs, pepperoni, cheese, and arugula.

The meat, highest quality & fresh. Their house made Mozzarella was creamy & delicious. Another customer had the Italian Hot Dog. 2 long dogs in a boat of bread with condiments. Looked yummy. He said its always what he goes in for. For house made quality their prices are very reasonable. More affordable than restaurants that serve processed food. I will be back. How anyone can give them less than 5 Stars is beyond me. If at anytime, anywhere there's a problem with an order give the server a chance to rectify concerns. Love this very nice clean family owned restaurant. Best sandwich I've ever had & I'm 67. Bravo! I just ordered a build your own pizza. I requested sliced onion instead of chopped & fresh basil instead of basil pesto with meats. Came fast & exactly as requested. The wood fired pizza crust is excellent! Their sauce is excellent. This restaurant is a gem with fresh ingredients. I live alone so will have enough pizza for the Knights game tomorrow. Go Knights! I'm thrilled to find Italian that is fresh & tasty. Not easy in this day & time. Thank You Plantones! I'll be back for other dishes & having had the sauce I can only imagine how it enhances other dishes.

1584728,2018-07-02,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Come for the pizza!  Stay because you're too stuffed to move.

I met my lucky charm here for a girls lunch during the week.  She and I love to split an abundance of menu items to get a better tasting in one meal.  When I say abundance I mean we split Momma's Meat Lasagna, The Anitpasti Board, a slice of Paulie's Pesto Chicken and Tony's Pepperoni.  You wouldn't think it would be over doing it but their slice of pizza seems to be half of a pizza.  Yeah it's not your average slice.  

Starting with the antipasti board really gets the taste buds going and the stomach warmed up.  It's a lovely spread of meats, fresh cheese, artichokes and roasted red peppers.  The lasagna is perfectly named as the sauce and layers are filled with meat to create this pasta dish.  It wasn't my favorite but maybe because of the pizza.  I couldn't get enough bites of the Pesto Chicken.  The white sauced pizza combined with the pesto chicken is fantastic. The crust is what really stands out and what makes or breaks a pizza.  The pepperoni pizza did not disappoint either.  Again I think it's the delicious crust which made it stand out from many of the other pizza establishments around the area.  

With plenty to choose from on the regular menu, they also offer specials daily.   Enjoy their food in the dining area with plenty of seating.  On the lovely days, they have a beautiful patio seating area.  I'm definitely a fan of Plantone's!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,5,2,4,TQP8kASVnJB11VLiYTMQFg

1871233,2017-05-30,1,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Plantone's has been on my radar since it popped up on Yelp. I was kind of wondering what kind of experience I would have since the reviews have been mostly good with a few bad reviews. 

When I walked in... It wasn't clear what you were supposed to do... So I was lost for a split second until I saw the arrows on the ground. Basically this is a place where you order and you are given a number and they bring out to the food to you. So as soon as you walk in... Look to your right and walk through the little aisle and look through the menus that are hanging on chalkboards or you could grab and to go menu and look through that instead. 

I was greeted right away and I told them I needed a second as it was first time... And at that point they could've explained the menu to me but instead they just left me alone which ended up being fine as I was ok with just looking through the menu. When I did finally make it up to the cashier I think I surprised her. She had her back to us and jumped about a mile when she turned around and saw us! Lol it was hilarious. :D

I placed my order with her and was given a number... And proceeded to wait. 

The ambiance is actually really cute! They have boxes of dried pasta and jars of olives lining the aisle that your walk to place your order... The only odd item was Cheetos....I would not expect Cheetos in an Italian restaurant. But the music was very fun... Now I can't think of any of the songs that I heard but I remember thinking that it was very cute and very fun Italian music...:) They also have 3 TV's against the wall playing mainly sports. Lots of cute tables with plenty of seating. The only weird thing was a bar type seating in the middle of the dining room... It was weird because when you sit in that bar type seating you are basically looking onto the tables that are lined up against it... If I was sitting at the table beneath it...I would kind of feel a little weird to have a stranger looking onto my table... But all good. I might just be a weirdo!! Lol

They have a decent sized menu with lots of different items on it which I will definitely be back for. 

I got the fried baloney sandwich... Which is basically a fried mortadella sandwich. The menu said ciabatta bread but it was just served on a white bread in the shape of a ciabatta roll. The mustard added the right amount of tang to the sandwich... But I wished that she would've mentioned that I could've added an egg to it...I later saw the pictures of the sandwich with a fried egg and they looked delish!! Overall, it was okay... BUT very very greasy. After I had a couple of bites, my hands and my mouth were covered in grease. Flavor 3.5/5 I also got the Italian pork sandwich with the broccoli rabe.... As soon as I saw the words broccoli rabe I was hooked. The sliced pork was tender but a little on the dry side but Amy the cashier thoughtfully brought us a side of au jus and when I dunked the sandwich into the au jus....omg it was perfection!!! It added so much flavor and a little kick... The broccoli rabe was cooked great so that it wasn't? mushy and had a great bite to it. Overall, the sandwich was a little messy....duh.... You dunk it into the au jus which totally saturated the bread... So worth all the extra napkins that you needed to wipe up the juices dribbling down your chin. Lol flavor 5/5

Will I be back heck yeah! It was delicious! Then why the 4 star instead of a 5 star? Maybe it had to do with the fact that I went there an hour before close but I had to wait a little over 20 minutes to get my food which in my books is a little too long. Hopefully I'll be able to go during lunch one day and see if the wait time is better. :)",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,2,1,4,qgHAjtfatyytz0IJ-ONT5A

I was disappointed in the selection of ""Italian"" food, it was mostly pizza and sandwiches.  The only pasta dish they had was spaghetti with bolognese sauce which included Italian sausage, aka pork. Being that I don't eat pork it left me with only sandwich or pizza options which I wasn't in the mood for, especially when the pizza is pre made and reheated to order, so we left.  I would be willing to give them another try but it would be nice if they had more pasta options.",tbeLiqr9QzOBG5wymuaNNg,1,0,1,icbBBa9_58pp5Vp3w_yD8Q

The restaurant wasn't that busy, there are just so many stores within that shopping center, that parking was hard to come by.  We actually had to park at CVS and walk over.  

My husband and son both ordered the Angry Sicilian.  It was okay and actually the best item that we did order.  However, my son's sandwich was pretty soggy so he ended up just eating the meat and leaving the bread.  I had the Eggplant Parmesan sub and boy was I disappointed.  There was barely any sauce, the bread was very dry, and the eggplant had the skin on it, which was very rubbery and hard to chew.  I ended up cutting the skin off, and just eating the eggplant without the bread.  I would have typically asked for more sauce, but the sauce wasn't all that great either.  Our youngest son had the pasta of the day, which was just spaghetti and meatball.  It was okay, again the sauce was nothing to call home about... especially coming from an Italian family.  We also ordered a pizza to share, again nothing great.  Just really disappointed with our experience.",IqWNLmid5wNci-g06btQOg,2,0,1,H_TgYVfAQ3uIv9hwCpt4kw

2082264,2017-01-05,3,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"TL;DR: do yourself a favor and eat here. NOW. Can't afford a trip to Italy? This is the VERY next best thing. Five stars is not enough. 

Just had Plantone's for the first time. Holy F*% it's amazing. I lived in Italy for more than four years. My parents live there now. During my last visit to them, I savored every bite of authentic Italian pizza I could because I thought I'd have to wait at least a year for another taste. Plantone's proved me wrong!!! 

I didn't know what to expect when I ordered my pizza, probably just a decent American style that I would gobble up and not think twice about. Plantone's IS as authentic as Italian pizza gets in the entire United States. The crust had that familiar crispy char, the mozzarella slices (nope, not shredded!!! Also not mozz. di bufala but that would have meant I was dreaming this whole experience anyway) were tossed on with in a lovingly haphazard sort of way that makes each bite different and interesting, the grilled onions (cipolle!!) had a mild but rich, earthy flavor and as soft as butter, the added ricotta and black olives (per amendment by myself , plus, the olives' flavor blew my freakin mind) gave this Bianco Pizza a provincial Mediterranean flavor, cuz ya know... when in Rome... This was, by an embarrassing amount more, the best Italian pizza I've ever had outside of Italy itself. 

I'm pretty sure Plantone's has mastered time travel because, in the measly TEN minutes from placing my order to pickup, they must have flown in this pizza straight from Italy. Next on my ""to try"" list is their tomato sauce in any form: pizza, pasta, calzone, idgaf. That'll be my ultimate determining factor in Italian authenticity.... hint hint! Simpler is always better, and the only extra ingredient needed is love, something Plantone's excels at! I'm not too worried that I'll soon be dually impressed.

Atmosphere very nice, people friendly. Parking is terrible. Tad on the pricier side, but not outrageous.

My wife had the Italian hot dog. She's from New Jersey and used to eat them as a kid. She said it  was authentic, but the bread was different than the East. Too much bread. The insides (peppers, potato, onion) very nicely done. Hot dog good quality and good portion.

I had the pasta of the day: fettuccine with bolognese sauce. This was 11 bucks so expected decent quality. Pasta was over cooked and the sauce watery with ZERO taste. Not even red, but at least it was very meaty. Didn't have any salt nor any herbs we could taste. Just bland! Sad. Do not recommend.

It almost hurts to write this review.  Having said that, here is my experience.  The first time I tried the Italian hot dog it was pretty darn good, not Jimmy Buffs, but the best I had tasted since moving to the west coast. So I went back a 2nd time.  The experience was quite different.  The bread was not as fresh, they changed the brand of hot dog (much saltier and flavorless) the onion and peppers were burnt and the potatoes were more like potato chips.  They redid my order and the potatoes were better, everything was the same.  So one for two, which means I had to try it again.  Maybe that second time was an off day.  So I do return and tell the cook about my previous experience, I wanted to make sure he got it right and politely told him that if it wasn't I would not be returning.  I was really hoping they got it right.  So I ordered my usual. Upon returning to my office hoping it would re-create my first experience,I opened my sandwich and there were no potatoes.   I called and they told me to return, a bit of a hassle, but hey, it happens.  The person behind the counter  was very courteous and even refunded my money, which I thought was good.  However, when I got back to my office, the potatoes were there, but very scarce and like the onions and green peppers, were very greasy.  I tried to eat it but between the salty flavorless hot dog, the lack of potatoes, and the overall greasiness, I was unable to finish it and just threw over half of it in the garbage.

Needless to say I as very disappointed and hope that they can somehow return to the quality and taste I had from the first visit.  If they do, please let me know and I will gladly return.  Otherwise, I'll have to write them off as a place to go for lunch. I would've given 1 star, but the staff are really nice so I gave an extra star for that.",dPgVG1nGSUONC0IViu5Phg,1,0,2,J6OTV8n5bRNcJ2W9Ummtqw

I may give this plan one more shot considering it's 4star rating here among users. Maybe I got the worst thing on the menu? I've had a better sandwich at Subway for 1/2 the cost. 

Tried it again, second time with the same order (to be fair) and the same results. My sandwich was dry, slightly over cooked (or sitting too long), and to me the value is just not there for $12-13. Perhaps I'm ordering the wrong item? I'm willing to give it one more try.  Once again, the service was great. The place is very clean.

They revamped the Mac Shack that was previously there and now it's Plantone's. The atmosphere is really inviting and the design is really nice...it's not an up-scale restaurant per-se but it did have that vibe. 

You can either order up at the counter, or a nice server will come to your table. We got lucky to have Victoriano as our server! He had a great attitude, was very informative, and extremely attentive. He said that they can pretty much make your pasta anyway you like it except for they don't have shrimp, steak, or seafood. He also mentioned that the cooks were trained by an Italian chef, so the food is more authentic. The food was not what we expected, but even better than expected! We ordered the Angry Sicilian and asked for it to be toasted, the Pasta of the Day which was penne (but instead we received Fettuccine, but did not mind) with Bolognese sauce, and a Build your Own Pizza. Everything was hearty and delicious! The Bolognese had plenty of beef and the meats and veggies we ordered on the pizza were fresh and plenty. 

We wanted to eat at the outdoor seating area, but it was breezy so we didn't want our food to get cold. It's spacious and nice out there so we will definitely sit out there next time to enjoy the great food. Happy hour specials are Monday thru Friday from 4-7 PM.

It's because they're as plastic as the sauce and dough they create.

2851147,2017-01-28,4,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"This review is in response to my 4th visit an hour ago.(which will be my last) I've ordered the same thing each time. The angry Sicilian sandwich. The signature sandwich. Great sandwich until today. During my 34 minute wait, I counted 12 people behind the counter, none were sure what was happening or what they are supposed to be doing. There were at least 2 managers and the owner there. I hold them accountable, not the staff. Once 30 mins had elapsed, I went to the counter to find my food, they didn't have my ticket or have any idea I was even waiting. After a few minutes, I was handed a bag that contained someone else's order. I was told this is the closest thing we have to your order just take the extra stuff as free. So I did because I couldn't wait any longer. Having had the sandwich before, I expect to see the same thing I've had previously, which contained layer after layer of sliced Italian meats. This one was a fraction of the size, probably one fourth of the previous visits. I never minded paying $18 (includes tip) for a sub, because it delivered. I will not make that mistake again.

I realize that this review is not very well written, please forgive me, my blood is still running hot.

I should have taken this to the owner when I was there, but didn't as I don't like to make a scene and was hot enough to do just that. The two nice ladies sitting next to me sharing their simultaneously similar experience did not help.",yRXgw7v2wLKXTLNxTgZ6JA,1,0,1,gMY_iRj9b6ED8eceU8dFcA

Excellent quality steak (I'm guessing it was ribeye?). Thinly sliced, tender, juicy and the perfect quantity. The roll was fresh and around 10"" long. We chose American cheese for our sandwiches but they have several other options. Two larges ran $25+, well worth it--excellent quality ingredients. 

The place is nicely decorated to dine in. They're conveniently located on the corner of Warm Springs & Durango. 

The only qualm I had is when I placed my order over the phone, they told me it would be ready by the time I got there. I arrived about ten minutes later and paid. The order was never relayed to the cooks. In turn, I had a brief 7-10 minute wait. But like I said, it was brief and well worth it. Human error, I get it; to err is human.

3028871,2017-03-04,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"First time here, and definitely coming back! 

Dined on a fairly busy night, a decent amount of guests were dining (looked busy from the outside) 

Immediately greeted by a nice girl who asked if we had been here before. We let her know it was our first time and she gave us menus and explained the specials and how to order. 

Ordering was really easy and there was no line at the time. Amy was very helpful with the menu! Also, free refills on drinks so ordering a small cup would be ideal if you don't mind standing up and grabbing seconds! 

Ordered the special which was fettuccine, added Alfredo sauce and chicken. Also ordered a large pesto chicken pizza. In my honest opinion the Alfredo sauce was ok, tasted like mostly cream. Also chicken was chewy, possibly just slightly overcooked? I always try things twice so I'll have to give it another shot next time. The pizza was excellent, not too overwhelming and the dough to topping ratio was perfect. 

Overall I'd recommend this spot if you're looking for a semi casual date or a quick fix if you're craving Italian food that's good quality and moderately priced. They do have alcoholic beverages available as well which was a pleasant surprise. 

 (Spent $40 total for the pasta, large pizza and two small drinks.)

Kristen was very funny, came to our table a few times asking us to tell the owner how awesome she is even though she didn't assist or serve us at all. Definitely added some comedic flare to our dining experience so I went with it. She even wanted me to pull up my Yelp review (I had written and posted it before leaving) to make sure I wrote about her and spelled her name right! I figured she must really need the ""brownie points,"" as she put it, with the owner. Owner ended up giving us some coupons for next time so I guess it was worth it? 

The girl who greeted us (didn't catch her name), Amy, and two servers, and the cooks were all the true superstars. Very helpful and polite, not overbearing by any means and definitely did not fish for unwarranted compliments!",XxbZVX09lwA3J0yG6-JSZQ,0,0,5,rOZxTV7ew8fOjR-_wXFo-A

Plantone's is amazing and actually it's pretty dangerous that they are less than a 5 minute drive away because Italian food is one of my all time favorites AND I can never say no to pizza! Like ever! Most recently they have been running some pretty good deals for the people who live in the neighborhood by sending out some mailer coupons and I decided to take advantage of one of the ""buy one get one free"" specials and wow... Talk about a deal people! 

So since we are talking, can we talk about this Paulie's Pesto Chicken and Pizza Bianca being like one of my all time favorites?  Yes Ma'am!  These two menu item favorites never fail! Always fresh and made to perfection. The Paulie's Pesto Chicken comes with of course: Grilled Chicken, Fresh Basil Pesto, House made mozzarella and EVOO. Pizza Bianca consists of: Grilled Chicken, White Sauce, Caramelized Onions, Fontina Cheese, Grated Parmesan, EVOO. Aside from the food, I just have to shout them out for always having consistent above par customer service! Each and every time I've ordered from here, I have always have an ""above and beyond"" kind of experience. 

A couple of things I would like to get around to would be to visit them for a dine-in experience and also for the happy hour specials and others that they feature throughout the week!

There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant; there is also an outdoor patio for additional seating should you choose to soak up some of that sweet Vegas sun.

On to the menu--I'm a little embarrassed to say that I've only tried 1 item on the menu in the 7 or 8 times I've been here. The meat cal-zone; it's big, it's meaty, and super cheesy! But more importantly, for $12 it gets me full which is incredibly rare now-a-days. I'll be trying different menu items soon to diversify my taste buds a bit.

The owner, Glenn is awesome. He's usually in on Fridays and is very well connected with his customers. He makes his rounds and checks to see that they're satisfied.

This place is also a speakeasy for real estate deals. If I was a betting man, I'd be willing to bet that there are more real estate deals getting done in here than there are that get done in some brokerage offices.

3432210,2017-02-17,2,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"My husband was 3rd in line at their grand opening to get a weekly free pizza for a year. So we should be visiting this wonderful neighborhood establishment at least on a monthly basis. 

The employees are very helpful from when they greet you at the door and when leaving the restaurant. 

Our first visit to Plantones was right before the grand opening. I guess it is common place for many restaurants to do this for training purposes as the employees were getting acclimated to their new environment. During this first visit, a few mistakes were made, but to our advantage. My husband had ordered a 10"" pizza with chicken pesto and all the veggies except jalapeños. Instead, they made the large pizza and added jalapeños. No big deal since they didn't charge us extra for the large pizza and we could easily pick off the jalapeños.

On our second visit, the first Friday to claim our free pizza, it was right at lunch time. Big mistake. Super busy. We waited in line for a good 13-minutes.  I almost feel that this could be improved as there are two windows.  So because it took so long to get through the line, I expected a long wait on our pizza as well.  I actually turned on the stop watch on my phone, went to the nice and clean restroom, got back to the table and within 4-mins and some seconds of waiting, the pizza arrived. Now this time does not include getting a drink and finding a table. So if anything, it took no more than 6-mins, which is still really good considering the lunch crowd.

Be sure to save room for dessert. The cannoli and tiramisu is fabulous.

Also, be sure to order a drink. They have the fun coke machines. So far, my husband's favorite concoction is strawberry vanilla coke.

My buddy ordered the chicken parmesan hot sandwich that looked mouth watering (his rating was 5 stars) During my visit the owner Glenn introduced himself was very friendly and accommodating. He offered me a coupon worth 5$ off my next visit and also have me his business card! Needless to say excellent dinning experience. This is the Italian lunch/dinner spot that gets you in and out and doesn't lack one bit on quality!",055mHXHyW4wE3dwVSNMs9g,0,0,5,F3db3X0l_3G780oj7G3RAA

The fresh mozzarella was perfect. with just the right amount of natural salt like eating milk. The san marzano sauce was rich and flavorful with a delicious tomato taste without being overly spiced like some places feel they have to. This pizza let the tomato taste shine through. Excellent!

3470602,2017-02-02,1,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"First visit and maybe I will give it another try but doubtful. I had the regular Italian sausage and peppers, my grand daughter had the regular meatball sub. Now I judge all Italian sausage subs against Portillos in Chicago, compared to that this was a grade C at best. The sausage was the size of a hot dog, dry and shriveled up. The peppers had no spice at all. The meatball sub consisted of two medium size meatballs very little sauce and you have to pay extra for mozzarella cheese...really on a meatball sub. The thing had such little sauce there was none on the plate after an 11 year old kid ate it, you know kids ain't especially careful when they eat. Two subs and two small fountain drinks 22.00 dollars. That's a little pricey no chips come with subs. They do serve it with pickles but who eats Italian subs with dill pickles.
Anyhow maybe it was an off night so like I said may try them again some day. Oh and parking is a nightmare had to park over by CVS.",XFxVhDCcPK_TDBIKLXbTow,1,0,3,zBIHuC-N3BoQ0N6EqK9aEA
3485613,2017-04-09,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"First time trying this place. There was a fair amount of people in there for a Sunday around 11am. We were headed to another spot but smelt the brick oven pizza from our parking spot so decided to try this place out. We are all about trying new spots and welcome small business over chain restaurants. The decor is inviting and rustic it definitely has an Italian vibe. 
We ordered the Quattro formaggio slice and the mamas margherita slice as well as a Caesar salad. The pizza was fair although not nearly as warm as we wished they had served it. Victor the server provided us fresh ground pepper on our salad which we appreciated. He also made a few routine stops by our table to check on us and grab us ranch dressing and a knives. We found victor helpful and prompt in our requests. 

However the woman who took our order was unpleasant and rude, her name tag said Maria. There was a point while we were dining that a secondary margaherita slice landed on our table, we mentioned we didn't order the secondary slice and that we had our full order, the slice landed on our table by mistake. We left the slice there as we knew it didn't belong to us, about 3 minutes later Maria came over to our table and removed the slice and placed it on another table, without saying a word. We found that extremely strange and quite rude. I felt awkward for the other table and their slice of pizza was left sitting on our table prior to being served to them. 

The owner arrived near the end of our dining and he was very sweet, he gave us his card and mentioned a few things about his new restaurant. We will definitely come back because the food was good, the restaurant was clean and the owner was great. Hopefully they figure out the food running and tell their staff to be more friendly (aside from victor he was great).",GmXOSEbXy8JXmvo9hM5WWQ,0,0,4,2LcUDytnijRV0-UJSipo0w

Inside they have regular tables as well high-top half booth/half stool seating. You order at the front counter and they bring your order to you. Staff is friendly and food is made fresh to order, so it might take a moment until it's ready especially if you order certain pastas, but it's worth it. 

Philly Cheesesteak ($7.50 for small) - Steak, onions and your choice of cheese. This was actually the sandwich that brought hubby and I here. The other pictures we had seen showed the sandwich had a good amount of steak in it. Sadly the one we had was mostly onions. The bread and onions tasted good, but where's the beef?! If this were the only thing we ordered, I am positive we'd have not come back. Thankfully the pizza I also ordered for us to share tasted really good! 

Tony Pepperoni ($4.50/slice) and Mama's Margherita ($3.50/slice) - Wow these are some huge slices! They gave be a big rectangular pizza box just for the 2 slices, which aren't the usual shaped slice. Both pizzas tasted great and the price was very fair. 

Angry Sicilian ($14.95 for large) - Prosciutto, capicola, soppressata, mortadella, house-made mozzarella, roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion, evvo, red wine vinegar and oregano on an Italian loaf. Yes, all that! This is one tasty sandwich and the bread holds everything in nicely. I could barely eat half and will only get the smaller one next time unless I am sharing with someone. 

Momma's Meat Lasagna ($12.95) - Pasta sheets that are made in-house are layered with a beef, pork and veal mixture, ricotta, sauce and shaved parmesan. This came with a couple pieces of garlic bread. The lasagna and bread were both good. I can't say I was feeling ""wow"" over it, but it was good and the price was fair. 

The cold sandwiches can be made a lettuce wrap if you'd prefer and since the food is made to order a lot of menu items can be customized if you want to leave something out or maybe even add something.

3581368,2017-06-18,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"It really kills me to give it 2 stars especially since I was really excited to try this place. 


l'll start with the positive things

I really liked the location of this place, great real estate choice. My husband and I really liked the interior of the restaurant, it has a modern touch to it. The place was clean and looked new inside ( because it is new) so we really liked that. Also the chicken with my meal was good but i'll elaborate on that so continue reading.

Now for the negative

WHERE THE HELL IS THE MARKET?!?!?! It can't possibly be the display area with the chips.

So when you walk in its hard to see and read the menu. They have them posted up high and the print is small so it's hard to see and read but no big deal. We did notice that they had 3 huge screens by the front door which we are assuming are meant to display the menu in bigger print but it wasn't on. We were in a pasta mood but they didn't really have many pasta options which was a bummer. Aside from the lasagna that seems to be a regular on the menu we ordered from the ""specials"" menu which was pretty much a protein (chicken or sausage) prepared differently, served with fettuccini and different sauce according to the protein option.
I ordered parmesan chicken with fettuccini. My husband got a pasta with sausage and a pink sauce I think it was. My husbands sausage (see what i did there) was thinly cut which wasn't the problem but it looked and had the texture of mushrooms. The sausage had no texture and the sauce was more on the goopy side and bland. My dish was better, but not by much. I will say my chicken parmesan was good. The chicken was moist, was salty, saucy and cheesy. The pasta / fettuccini however was a different story. I felt as if the pasta was more of an afterthought, didn't feel like it went with my meal which is weird and its such a simple dish which is why I was disappointed and slightly confused. Also the sauce was........ good/ fine, it wasn't greasy or gross which is a good thing but I was turned off by a metallic/electric cooker taste.


Maybe pasta isn't their thing and maybe their subs, pizza or calzones are the better options. This place has soooooo much potential but the entire restaurant is sort of confusing, I thought it was a sit down and order type of place but its an order and then sit type of spot which I think they should switch that up ( due to trendy ambiance and size) but not a deal breaker.  Honestly thinking about it now the place reminded me of Sbarro with a cool and trendy interior. Not sure if its worth the money to get Sbarro quality food in a trendy joint. This is probably the thanks I get for not cooking this evening.",TCXHYNo1LWLszdGwrFhvJg,2,0,2,lDdCk8599dpFYXXkpyw6Jg
3591709,2017-02-03,1,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"ANGRY SICILIAN!!

Plantone's Italian Market is a fantastic addition to the Southwest side of Las Vegas, where we tend to miss out on some of the better Italian joints such as Roma or Nora's, especially when in need of a quick bite. Featuring Italian sandwiches (ANGRY SILICILIAN!), thin crust pizzas, and a daily handmade pasta special (as well as an always available lasagna), this converted location of Mac Shack brings a lot of variety.

Italian meats are often procured in Las Vegas from Boar's Head, and Plantone's doesn't hide the fact that they use their meats. I've tried a couple of the sandwiches here, including the Angry Sicilian and the Plantone's Parma. At 15 dollars for a 10-inch sub, these are some pricier sandwiches, and I'm not sure you can get by on a 6-inch size sub either. 

On the ANGRY SICILIAN!, they absolutely heap on the meats - Prosciutto, Capicola, Soppressata, and Mortadella all come together along with house-made Mozzzarella, Roasted Red Peppers, and some of the other normal trimmings. If you're coming here for the first time, GET THIS SANDWICH! It's absolutely delicious and my mouth waters just thinking about it. And I absolutely love the Italian bread here. I generally like my sandwich breads soft, and this is by far the softest bread I've had for an Italian sandwich. I can't recommend this sandwich enough.

The Plantone's Parma is also a tasty sandwich, but it only has imported Prosciutto - there's more of it than on the other sandwich, but since Prosciutto is rather expensive, you don't get that same kind of heartiness in this versus the SICILIAN(!). In the end, I felt a little hungry and less excited about this variety.

One of the most particularly enticing options at Plantone's is their homemade daily special pasta. They offer one particular type of pasta, such as fettuccine or pappardelle, in one of their variety of sauces. During our second visit to Plantone's, we decided to get the fettuccine bolognese that was available for the special. At 10.95 for a medium-sized portion at best, it's not the cheapest pasta around but the noodles here are special. The fettuccine was unlike any that I've had before - on the thicker side and somewhat wavy in nature with an unevenness that suggests it was indeed made by hand. Handmade fresh pasta also tends to be a little softer than the dried noodles we generally have available to us, so it may not be as appetizing to some as others. The bolognese sauce was average in my opinion - the sauce was tangy and meaty, but lacked a certain depth to it. Maybe it was simply a little bland. Some grated Parmesan cheese would have gone a long way to add some nuttiness. Granted, I'm not sure they have some available or not as I did not remember to ask.

Service here was good for both our visits - someone greets you at the door and explains what's available and where to order, though they can get a bit wordy. Food is brought out to you if you dine in, and they offer boxes for whatever type of food you ordered.

I'll be back soon to try their pizza. Also, ANGRY SICILIAN!",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,3,0,4,g1KgrIpVfoQ3uGY5wl2W8A
3597213,2017-04-17,1,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"I am always interested when I see an Italian Market has opened up in the area and try to check it out to see what they offer. I made the trek across town to see what they have to offer. When first walking in it was a bit confusing. There was a pizza selection as part of a long counter top where the other food options are. You have to walk to the front of the line to find a menu or see the boards with other food options, little confusing if you haven't been before. I thought it was just me but the other people behind were just as confused.
A market
-The highlight of the trip was the Italian Broccoli sandwich with sharp provolone and an Italian bread. We decided to have the pork on the side and I'm glad we did, it wasn't very good.not much flavor and the au ju it sat in really lacked the basics, not even a hint of salt. The broccoli was cooked perfectly and seasoned just about right, I prefer a strong garlic taste in mine but that's just preference. This is my go to sandwich when I travel back to Philly(not a cheesesteak) so it was definitely comforting.
-After seeing some photos I decided to try the meatball sandwich. It was on more of a homemade roll, very light and airy, with two meatballs and way too much sauce. It was just middle of the road for me, nothing outstanding and there are definitely better meatballs out there. Seemed like there should be less sauce and more meat
I would try some other menu items if I am in the area but would not go out of my way to come back.",L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,3,2,3,JzgWuJ0dJJbNwXr5A9aywA

Save for the pizza bianca, the rest of the meal was less than satisfactory.  The pizza had a good cheese flavor and the caramelized onions gave it a good taste.

The sauce with the fettuccine was watery.  Just getting some on my plate resulted in several tomato spots on my shirt.  The pizza fries was a conglomeration of steak fries, tomato sauce, cheese, and meatballs.  It was a gloppy mess.  The fried ravioli were OK but they were almost identical to the ones I get on the buffet at the Suncoast.  

I'm glad I didn't have to cut a slice from the dessert calzone because the crust almost had to be torn to get through it.

While I didn't do the ordering, you look at the menu board near the entrance and then walk down the counter to the far end and place your order.  It's seems a bit inconvenient.  You then get a stand with a number for the table and they bring your food when it's ready.

4019297,2016-12-23,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"My prior review of this restaurant was one star due to an incident that happened when we arrived.

Shortly after, we received correspondence from the owner Tony, who apologized for any misunderstanding and very warmly invited us to try and be part of the Plantones family again.

Today my wife and I went in and tried this place again.  

This time, we were greeted by Tony himself and given a tour of all this place has to offer.  First thing we noticed was the decor, as it is well decorated and has a very warm and inviting feel.  This is very different than when MacShack had residence here, in a good way.  

Inside there is a very nice looking structure of multiple cabinets that features grocery style items for this type of food that can be purchased, and of course on the other side is the restaurants food.

Tony had us try a few different options, including pizza, a sandwich that was some kind of Italian Pork sandwich, the angry Sicilian sandwich and a peppers and sausage sandwich.

KILLER FOOD!

The pizza you can tell is home cooked and full of flavor. We got the pepperoni one and noticed the quality ingredients from the first bite. 

My wife and I split part of the Italian pork sandwich and I have to say, it was one of the best tasting sandwiches I've ever had.  It was full of flavor and juice and topped with some kind of greens (broccoli, maybe asparagus?) but it was fantastic.

For my meal I got the sausage and peppers sandwich and it was incredible.  The sausage was a bit spicy but not in a way that would overwhelm the flavor.  Fans of this type of sandwich may just find this is a new favorite spot.

My wife ordered the large angry Sicilian.  It was huge, she had to take most of it home.  Pilled high with various meats and cheese, this is the kind of sandwich you always see pictures of in ads. Most time the real thing never lives up to the picture, but this certainly keeps its reputation. I highly recommend it!

Aside from amazing food and service, this place also features ice tea as a drink and has a the newer style sofa fountain where you select your own soda then flavoring from Coca Cola products.  My wife had her Vanilla Coke while I enjoyed the Orange Coke.

Highly recommend this spot, bring some friends and family and enjoy the amazing experience !

Plus with all most of our group of ladies wanting wine; this ultimately was in the cards. Italian food and wine pair so deliciously together. One of the ladies in our group lives close to this restaurant so we would not have far to drive home after dinner being so close to her house. Then, after dinner we all drove back to her house with leftovers, and continued the party at her house.

Our group was seated in the patio area and it was late enough in the evening that the heat was not an issue. Those nightly Vegas breezes that come from the mountains are amazing too out here on the patio. The restaurant is very warm and pleasant with a modern edge in architecture. On the front landscape they use desert plants to decorate such as the huge agave as you walk in the front door. The color scheme they use is a mix of brown that makes the restaurant very appealing and clean feeling. The staff are very considerate and friendly too.

Most of us started with white wine and then when dinner came, since most of our glasses were empty we switched to Sangrias. We dined here on a Wednesday too, so we received a wonderful surprise  on wine , going with the bottle was amazing. Our Sangrias bottle was half price, so we ordered two bottles with eight of us. For dinner we ordered two 10 x 18 pizza with three toppings each. The first one had pepperoni, feta, and mushroom. The second pizza had mozzarella, olive, and feta. Their pizzas are very delicious too.

Our server delivered flawless service to our group and was so polite. She constantly continued to ensure that we had all we needed with such a large group of guests. The pizzas that we ordered for our extra extended party later at the house were all correct. Our server was the one who prepared that order as well. The order was flawless and those pizzas were divine. The service was exceptional and food excellent and our little event went very smoothly.

Living in the Southwest its nice to see a fresh new restaurant pop up in hopes of that i can add it to my regular rotation. Fair warning to those that walk in and wait to be seated like me, its the kind of place where you grab a menu and order at the counter to the right where they give you a number. I ordered the Italian Hot Dog, as i try not to order the same ol' staple items you can see on any menu. It came out looking like a loaf of french bread split down the middle, with bell peppers, onions and potato chips pouring out of it. It honestly didn't look appealing so i hoped it was better in taste upon the first bite, 70% peppers and onions, a few potatoes and no hotdog. Second bite was similar, and i could tell it was not going to be a meal that i would enjoy. I took the sandwich apart and removed 50% of the vegetables as they were very mushy and bland, and positioned the hotdog so that it could add some flavor to the sandwich and mask the vegetables. I got through the sandwich/hotdog, but it wasnt enjoyable at all. Its a possibility that i simply ordered the wrong thing on the menu, but im a strong believer that if its on the menu it should be worth eating at least. I may give this place a try in my future but i will not rush back as there are plenty of places within a short distance  of here that has consistently good food across the entire menu. The patio is cute, and the employees were friendly, and im sure the pizza isnt bad but that hotdog might need some rethinking or at least a different preparation of at lease the vegetables.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,6,0,2,ymnYiXBi-O7XVaeE_9eGAQ

This sandwich has sharp provolone and au jus on it. I would have liked a small side of the juice to come out with the sandwich by default, but the sandwich was by no means dry. The bottom was soggy just how I would expect. The pork was juicy and sliced thin. It was basically like a French dip, but with pork instead of beef, and some rabe on top.

4228973,2017-03-20,3,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"I've been pretty excited to see an authentic Italian shop open down the street from me. Sometimes I cringe when I see the prices but it really comes down to the flavor.

I've had the pleasure of trying their Alfredo pasta during my first visit. You can absolutely taste the texture difference of the pasta of how it is homemade versus store bought. It was soft, maybe too soft for some people's liking, flavorful and just delicious. They packed in garlic in the sauce and it's exactly the way I would've wanted it.

I tried the Roast Pork Italian hot sandwich. I did wish to have a small cup for a little more au ju to dip my sandwich in, but it surprisingly remained slightly moist the whole time. I'm not usually a big fan of broccoli rabe with the bitterness but it perfectly countered the pork, juice and the bread. This sandwich surprised the hell out of me.

I do feel like you get the most bang for your buck with their Philly Cheesesteak. This sandwich was just plain greasy and so damn delicious. I wish I asked for extra provolone cheese because I could not get enough of it. I also had them add all the peppers, onions and mushrooms and they were sautéed perfectly.

I did try their white Bianca pizza and added some basil pesto to it and this was also awesome. I plan to try all their pizzas at some point. They offer a buy one, get one Happy Hour special between 4pm-7pm for any of their 10"" pizzas.

Also at first I was a bit upset that the two cannoli's were $5.50, but they are seriously the best cannoli's I've ever had. I wish they were a little cheaper but it was definitely worth it.",bRzr5YuEIncFzG6_vYSwcw,10,5,4,3t3g-Oi4S-F88-5Jzng48g

I was tempted to try a pasta dish (which changes daily, usually two selections) but instead opted for the Sicilian sub. While I still haven't tried the pasta, I feel confident that I made the right choice.

I ordered the sub on sesame bread and it arrived as this MASSIVE two portion (unless you're very ambitious) sandwich. I mean, this sub fed me twice- it was the only thing I needed to eat all day. I also tried the meatballs as a consolation prize for not ordering the pasta and they were tender and delicious- hey I said the sub was the only thing I NEEDED, but I never denied that I'm a glutton. The sauce that came with it was good enough to get me excited about pasta there in the future, and I ate every last spoonful. No regrets.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,4,2,4,U1WzGYbmLvHhdL6NPubzVw

Because this place is new, I have yet to try other items on the menu. I got the Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich, my boyfriend ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo. Keep in mind that Fettuccine Alfredo isn't even an item listed on the menu, but ask and ye shall receive. They are very flexible on making common pasta's even if it's not their listed ""Pasta of the Day"" - you just need to ask. Brownie points for great customer service & accommodation!

Italian restaurants are always, always over-priced, so I was relieved to find this place REASONABLY priced. Granted, it primarily sells sandwiches and pizza, but don't underestimate the quality. All of their bread and noodles are made in-house, so you get the FRESHEST results.

My boyfriend said his Fettuccine was delicious (very fine dining like / balanced additions of garlic, parmesan, and butter) and my Eggplant Parmesan sandwich was to die for. The default bread they use for hot subs is so soft and fresh.

Pizza by the slice is more like half of a pizza with the large portion. Both types we tried were delicious, the Paulie's Pesto Chicken and Tony's Pepperoni. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and the pizzas had enough grease to feel indulgent without ruining the pizza. The pizza slices were inexpensive for the portion and quality.

Momma's Meat Lasagna was okay with the a meaty bolognese sauce on top, but it wasn't overly memorable. I loved the Antipasto appetizer that was loaded with meats, cheese, and other goodies. The presentation was nice too.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,1,4,1ZTBU-TFy268LaqaBul1Iw

After driving around the parking lot for 10 minutes to find a spot, I was impressed upon entering as the remodel on the space was extensive. The ordering was awkward as apparently there is a fridge under the register that they take the order at, and one of the staff was getting supplies out while the order taker stood awkwardly behind him. Instead of acknowledging me and apologizing for the situation, she avoided eye contact and didn't even say hello. When that moment had passed, she seemed very confused by my order which was pretty simple - the roast pork sandwich and a spinach salad with the dressing on the side - all to go. After repeating my order several times she asked me to move down to the cashier station. Again - another awkward situation as I stood there waiting for the cashier for several minutes. All staff who walked past avoided eye contact and no reason was given for the absence of the cashier. Several minutes later the cashier appeared and thankfully she apologized for the delay. The wait for the food wasn't too bad, and left the restaurant within 15 minutes of arriving. Upon returning to work I opened the bag and saw that not only had they put the dressing on the salad (after several requests for it to be on the side) but there was so much dressing the salad was inedible. The roast pork sandwich looked delicious, but the broccoli rabe was so tough that I had to take it off the sandwich and eat it separately.

4612027,2017-02-03,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"This place is amazing!

I worked during their grand opening and found nothing wrong with their service, food or atmosphere!

Once you walk into the restaurant, it feels much larger than compared to what it was before (Mac Shack). The staff is very welcoming, but some are still learning (which is understandable).
When it came to ordering, the cashier made sure that you got the right size of whatever item you wanted.
Then, when it was delivered to the table later on, the staff made sure that you had everything you needed to enjoy your meal.

When I was there, I ordered the 10"" Mama's Margherita Pizza and was so satisfied! The crunch was just right for the crust, it wasn't burnt or undercooked, and the homemade mozzarella was phenomenal!

Along with that, I got a side Caesar salad and a drink and it was all reasonably around $10!

To top things off, the owner of the restaurant--his name is Glenn, and he made sure I knew it was with two N's-- is the most endearing man. He's a local, UNLV alumni and probably the sweetest as can be.

If you need a good fix for pasta, pizza or subs, try this place out! I'm sure you won't regret it.",57a0aJvH77yY4t8Dkk0cvA,3,0,5,93-Be6ho-7woaeHy561c6w

Husband got the Angry Sicilian sub which he said was greasy and bland.  The paper it was wrapped up in was soaked through with grease.  My meat lasagna was also mega greasy, so much so that it was hard to taste anything other than oil, and the pasta layers were mushy.

For a great deli sandwich, ill go to Butcher Block down the street from now on.

5009228,2017-01-27,0,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Went for the for the Grand Opening. They encouraged people to start camping out at 12:00am. It didn't happen. We got there at 8 A.M. with 4 people in line. We ended up 7th and 10th in line by 8:30 ish.

LET ME TELL YOU! People are hitting themselves for missing this. Great open atmosphere, awesome patio for when it gets warmer. The staff beyond amazing. The poor guy who had to stand outside and keep things organized amazing. Explained everything to the T, and kept calm. They even had people park at Vons's walk over and without a doubt he knew what spot you were in. By 10:45 it was at 100. 

At 11:00 when they opened it was spot on amazing. You walked in knowing what you wanted, as they handed out menus. It was a easy flow. They have been open a month or so, and the place still seems very clean and organized. Every employee knew what their task was.

Food: 5/5

With a mass opening like this I thought the few good 10 orders would be kinda a shock and have a few things wrong. Nope. So then I thought at least one person would have something wrong. Nope. The only problem was Togo or dinein. But if that's your issue. By all means you rocked.

Pizza Blanca: AMAZING! The cheeses and the Onion compliment it so well, but the bites of chicken set it off. The crust is great. Has some char-marks but not burnt. If you like it a little more krispy just ask, they will handle it. 

Pesto Chicken Pizza: Actually is very good. My partner loved it. I thought it was very good.

Chicken Parm Sandwich: So we shared food with a gentleman named John in line. Which was awesome. He gave us each a piece of his sandwich. I must say their red sauce is amazing. To die for. With the small piece of chicken (because i got the middle of the two cutlets, in a large sandwich) was cooked very well. Not to much coating at the end of the chicken as filler. Hands down was great. 

Glen the owner is very kind. Can talk to anyone! Staff is 5/5. I can't wait to see how this place grows! Congrats!",K7TwsKP-uvnzIoij7CqzjQ,6,4,5,kyLZwWeiENS1bJe-iHqD7g

5122957,2017-01-31,4,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"I came for their grand opening and was able to get a year's worth of pizza with a weekly customer punch card. Stoked.

Everything I've tried here so far has been outstanding. They use boar's head meat on their sandwiches so the ingredients are quality.

What I've tried:

Angry Sicilian sandwich: A loaded sandwich that was so good I forgot to take a picture. I guess it's their signature sub. I was surprised to hear it's only 10 inches as it does look a lot bigger when you get the large...seems to dwarf a Subway foot long.

Meatball sandwich: Ridiculously tasty meatballs formed to perfect size with outstanding sauce in their freshly baked bread. The meatballs have a hint of distinct seasoning that stands out from other meatballs I've had and it really works...will have to ask what it is if I run into the owner again.

Custom pizza: Soft, airy crust with a hint of garlic, a little light on the cheese and sauce put probably because I loaded up on the other ingredients. If you want to add ""roasted vegetables"" don't assume it's roasted peppers or a mix of other roasted veggies, it's actually just eggplant. I'm not an eggplant fan and especially not an eggplant on pizza fan so I'll give the roasted vegetables topping a miss next time, perhaps they should call it exactly what it is: eggplant. I also opted for a ricotta cheese topping to compliment the meatballs, pepperoni and sausage and it was the light and creamy ricotta similar to what they use over at Pizza Rock, suffice to say I'm a fan of that stuff.

You can tell immediately if you have a chance to meet the owner that he is extremely involved and passionate about the food they are putting out. They are also active in giving back to the community through various charities.

5226017,2017-02-09,3,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"I went to this place to try it out last week and I was pretty disappointed. There are a lot of kinks to work out in terms of logistics. I went there to place my order after work- (so like 6pm during the workweek) and it's not busy at all. I go to place my order and the cashier, a blonde girl, says ""Hold on! I'm not ready yet!"" The thing is, I hadn't said a word. I was 'holding on'...not the greatest first impression, but young people get stressed out easily. I just wait until she is ready. Finally, she calls me over and then as soon as I start to speak she tells me to hold on again so she can answer the phone. Meanwhile, there are like 25 employees all everywhere trying to create a fun environment but just trying too hard and making it super awkward. One guy asks me my name, I tell him and then he tells the rest of the staff and they keep saying my name every  chance they get thinking this is somehow a catchy marketing ploy? I'm not sure but it was obnoxious. So finally, girl is off the phone and I'm ready to order now. Then, the phone rings again- no apologies, nothing.  She just answers. I'm visibly pissed and she recognizes that so she placed the caller on hold this time so I could finally order. After about a 10 minute dance with her, I place my order. Sandwich and individual pizza. She tells me 30 mins. What?!? Jesus! I paid already so whatever- I decide to drive directly across the street to Von's to pick up some stuff. I haven't even parked... Less than 5 minutes had passed and some man calls and tells me my order is ready and to come pick it up. I ask him how that's possible? 5 mins ago, I was told 30 mins. He repeated my order to me. I confirmed and he said yup, ready. Weird but ok. Even better. So I go across the street again- (if you know this area, you know how impossible this can be during this time of day) and I finally make it and go to pick up my order. I get there and, of course, my order was not ready. They did however, say my name at least 20 more times to add to this lovely experience. I finally got my food. It was correct and edible which is why they get two stars. Mediocre quality at best. Two stars is generous, trust me. Soggy pizza and bland sandwich. 

Suggestion: Service matters as much, if not more than the product. Please keep your eyes on the face of your business. (Ashley, I think was her name) Also, invest in some salt and pepper and make sure all moving parts are communicating with each other so you have a decent shot at a first impression. Finally, quality control. Pizza was super soggy because it was not timed to be ready when the sandwich was. 

Best of luck to you folks- I love supporting mom and pop shops- hopefully this experience was the exception and not the rule.",z6vN2RkLbY8cv3QUw0EDiA,3,0,2,EdLtoyWkX8nNEgXPkX-L7A

5278755,2018-06-13,2,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Twice visited in the past and thrice utilized for catering it was alongside three adults and a child that dinner service was finally sat down to at Plantone's Italian Market on Friday, past experience yielding a superior Pizza than those ordered for Take-Out but the rest of a five-item order again showing inconsistency, though nothing was particularly ""bad.""

Now approaching 18-months of service and busy on this particular evening, a heavier prominence on Social Media and updated online Menus perhaps finally spreading the word of Glenn Plantone's tribute to Uncle Tony, it was just prior to 5pm that guests grabbed a high-top before placing an order, the lack of Happy Hour specials admittedly surprising in the setting of a 5/23/18 Instagram post though overall cost remains affordable.

Sticking to counter-style ordering that only serves to confuse first-timers, some thirty feet separating menus from the register, it was shortly after paying the tab that a number and cups for self-service Beverages were provided, items rolling out one-by-one with an entrée of Chicken Parm arriving first, the pounded Breast juicy and light in oil though the Pasta was still too watery which led to Sauce already under-spiced being thinned out and mostly left to waste.

Next receiving six fried Ravioli, the texture fine but neither Cheese Filling nor Sauce doing much to compel anyone to finish one remaining, it was here that a ""well done"" Pizza Bianca substituting Sausage for Chicken was delivered, the crust still a far cry from Sin City's best due to a lack of leavening but toppings all mingling well with sautéed Onions playing well off crumbled Pork and Fontina.

Rounding out savories with previously ""secret menu"" Pizza Fries, the Steak-cut Spuds flaccid even in areas not saturated with Sauce or added Ricotta, it was with far less attention to visuals than the one pictured online that a Nutella Calzone was finally sliced, the cost of $10.95 a far for ""Calzone of Day BYO"" as listed on the receipt not noticed till later inexplicably higher than the Nutella Pizza regardless of the suggested ""1/2 off Happy Hour"" which was nowhere to be found.

TWO STARS: Apparently achieving at least some notoriety as of late, though the odd order of delivery with Dessert preceding Fries makes one wonder if the kitchen can keep up with even a 33% filled dining room, Plantone's Italian Market simply does not have what it takes to compete with other locals such as Naked City or Metro let alone the likes of Esther's Kitchen where Appetizers such as stuffed Zucchini Blossoms only cost a few bucks more than the fried Ravioli and handmade Pasta is the same price as Chicken Parm atop watery boxed Noodles.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,2,2,qHUYQEgGyvVYAQ9ZPz73PA

5349056,2017-02-25,2,MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg,"Oh Plantone's! You've stolen my heart the moment I walked in!

I like to browse Yelp from time to time and found out about Plantone's! It's brand spanking new and I told my boyfriend that we have got to try it! So one day, we stopped in for lunch. We got greeted the moment we walked in and if you've never been there before, they give you a small briefing about the establishment, which is fantastic! Except ... I couldn't keep my attention on their briefing because my curiosity got the best of me and my eyes started to wander...

Plantone's has a very casual atmosphere to their establishment. One side is the kitchen, reminding me of a cafeteria-esq area where you can see them cooking. At the end of it, you order with the cashier and she gives you a number. Then you pick a seat on the other side and wait -- either for your food or your to go order. They also have stuff for you to buy if you so desire. A lot of it are imported, I believe -- they have pasta, sauces, olive oil, etc. 

So far we've tried three of their items: the angry sicilian, plantone's parma, and their pasta of the day, which was a linguine with a bolognese sauce.  The angry sicilian had a TON of meat on it with their house made mozzarella, roasted peppers, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The plantone's parma focused on their imported prosciutto with mozzarella and arugula, which is a fairly simple sandwich. Their sandwiches are available in either a 6 inch sub or a 10 inch sub and you are able to choose what type of bread you would like with it. 

From our experience, the 6 inch sub comes with a pickle and peppers while the 10 inch does not. If you would like your sub to be cut in half, you would have to ask because it's not an auto thing for them. 

The angry sicilian is our FAVORITE. It's absolutely delicious and everything just meshes together so very well. Their mozzarella is definitely a winner. I would definitely recommend this particular sandwich if you didn't know what to try first. The plantone's parma is also delicious but it seems a little lacking compared to the angry sicilian. While I understand that imported prosciutto is pricey, I can't help but to notice that the angry sicilian and plantone's parma is the same price yet the angry sicilian is so much more filling than the plantone's parma.

The pastas that they have changes daily, thus the term ""pasta of the day"" and the best part? They are also house made and you can definitely tell because the texture of their pasta is different and thinner than what you can get in a box. Their pastas are good and simple -- nothing too complicated. So if you're looking for something complicated, then you probably shouldn't try it.

Aside from sandwiches and pastas, they also have pizzas. I have yet to be able to try them but I will soon enough!  

TRY THIS PLACE. OK. THANKS.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,0,4,4Z9fx0YRtcnr3ktwem7qpQ

There was no crumbled feta on the green salad (I was really looking forward to that because I love Feta) but there were onions. The pizza didn't look like the pictures i saw online,  it was a regular cheese pizza with a few bits of basil, and the lasagna was no bigger than the palm of my hand (but it cost almost $13), there was no thickness and no toasted cheese on top, it seemed microwaved.

Once inside, I was greeted immediately. I liked the open kitchen - it was nice seeing how everything was prepared. The happy hour specials were great, so we ordered some drinks and food. Here's the rundown.. 

Margherita pizza - Delicious dough. Very flavorful, good chew. Unfortunately, the pizza had way too much cheese. The pizza was heavy and soggy. Kinda disappointing. 

Meatballs - light and fluffy. Good sauce. Would definitely order again. 

Angry sicilian sub - good, but dry. Missing something to tie it all together. 

Mozz sticks - big and crispy. We'd definitely order again.

Now I must foreshadow the fact that I placed my to go order about an hour before closing on a Sunday so my review has a grading curve til next time. 

We ordered 2 pizzas, 2 sandwiches and a salad. 

Pizzas ... The chicken pesto was so heavy and not baked long enough so it was slimy and a challenge to eat even with knife and fork.  But the flavors were spot on delicious. 

The pepperoni pizza again the sauce and toppings were too heavy and the dough only seemed par baked.  But delicious none the less. 

The angry Sicilian ... That's the four star earning sandwich.  They could run their business off the sales of that sandwich alone. 

Chicken parmigiana sandwich was also good.  Their red sauce (both pizza and sandwich) are so good -- the chicken had a good breading and was weird chicken free ... But it was kinda on the over cooked side.
