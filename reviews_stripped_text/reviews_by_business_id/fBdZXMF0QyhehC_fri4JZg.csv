Anyways... we walked in and it was so dark and dingy, it was very quiet and it was the type of place where you can tell there were regulars, but not a whole lot.

We were about to turn around and walk out, just due to the ambiance, but decided to sit for at least one drink.

We were very surprised after... The service was AWESOME! So we decided to order some appetizers. The food was unforgettable. We were so impressed by it all. So now it's one of our spots.

Just wish they would redecorate,  they would attract more people if they did... every time we go, it's always pretty empty.  Too bad, cus they have something going there.",yhyv-3rSq6VxifMoiOCGBA,3,0,5,dpNi3m5Ap7vXryzjZMywoQ

Since I've been on a Burger Binge, I had to try this place!

Fat Charlie's Burger and Fries: comes with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. Server even asked me how I wanted my egg.. I got it over easy (over medium may have been a good choice as well). Yes, egg with burger has been done before, ""Fat Burger"" was the first rendition I've ever had a burger with egg. But this place does it BIG!! Quality of the patty was good overall, juicy enough and lightly seasoned. Buns were proportioned well with the steriod pumped patty. May want to jog around the block before and after a Beast like this! Fries were the fat potatoey delicioius ones! Went hand in hand with the burger. 

Interesting enough, everything else in this place was Super sized! They had a Huge wrap around bar filled with character - bikini tops/bottoms hung from the metal bar roof, super high warehouse type ceilings (you could stick a freakin' palm tree in there!), Jumbo sized decorations hung from the ceiling - A Huge Marlin or Swordfish, Cowboy Riding a Shrimp.. Weird but Fun!  

Sweet service, Great burger for a Great price, Unusual and Interesting Decor! It was like eating outside a ranch but inside a building.. Dive Bar Gone Wild??!!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,6,4,4,QZYqsQGlo-0tDU31XvWLHQ

They have good comfort food, honestly great quality.

Some Alaskan Amber on tap, and Sierra Nevada joined our meal.
The chicken on my sandwich was moist, and juicy. The bread was a beautiful golden crisp. The french fries were amazing. The salad was fresh. 
My fiancé enjoyed his Fat Burger, the ghost pepper sauce had a bite, that's for sure. The onions rings were hands down the best I've had!!! 
The Steak and Shrimp looked great. The mashed potatoes looked like the classic set up, topped with beef gravy.

The ONLY let down is that they allow indoor smoking, so be aware of it if someone has breathing problems. I got used to it even with my light asthma, and nothing stuck to my clothes or hair.",jgqmHN3vgkZbI04PgZxb_Q,0,0,4,VJ2umROnAyCvle-1l5kyrQ

After almost 20 minutes, there was two ladies at the computer and one loudly said ""fine I guess I'll take this one"" and came over and said ""are you ready to order?""  She made it extremely obvious she did not want to deal with us!  I think her name was Barbie (she never introduced herself but that name was on the bill), and she looked like she was strung out on something. We didn't see her again until our food came, but the young man continued to check on us.   The food was not good.  I got a Cajun chicken salad, which I didn't even eat except for the chicken. It tasted like a plain crappy salad drowned in ranch. My friends got breakfast, which was mediocre at best.  The young man flagged down our server, who dropped off our check and never came back to our table. We waited over 30 mins to have someone take our payment. We could tell the young man was getting frustrated because he was not able to process payment himself and the lady didn't care that he kept telling her to run our credit cards. Eventually we gave up, put the exact dollar amount in for each check, and tipped the young man who took care of us all night.  By far one of the worst experiences I've ever had eating out.  The lady servers both appeared to be strung out on some sort of drugs and were embarassingly terrible at their jobs.  I worked in food service for ten years serving, bartending, and managing, and I do not understand how these women have jobs, or how this place is even still open if this is how it's being run.

One night I decided to eat there, I figured, ""Why not? I'm here and if I get sick, Walgreen's is next door and I can walk there to get something to settle my stomach...or buy a pack of smokes!""

After eating there, it became a place where hubby and I could meet friends at any time of the night since their kitchen is 24 hours. It's a fun place for greasy food...and I fell in love with their Philly Cheesesteaks. I don't know what it was, but I never had a bad philly cheesesteak there -- ever. Best of all, we could have beer with our pancakes at 3am if we wanted. Not many can boast about that...wait, maybe that's not something to be proud of.

At any rate, their breakfasts are great, too. Hubby and I could split a stuffed french toast breakfast, but more often than not we didn't because he didn't want to share. HAH!

The last time I was there with my cousin, I was a bit shocked at how different it was.  The clientele seemed a bit older and a lot more cranky.  Maybe we just got there at the wrong time, but it wasn't the Charlie's Down Under I remember getting ripped at and then stumbling back home at 4am.

4624509,2014-09-14,2,fBdZXMF0QyhehC_fri4JZg,"This is an extremely smoky bar with terrible music. The atmosphere is not there, the music is so low that no one really talks. The food is just ok and the service is very mediocre. The crowd is in their 50's so their is not much action as most people are gambling. This bar needs a major facelift! I would probably not recommend it to anyone as there are better places to experience",wtNopFY2ybprzk4FuEbWJQ,3,2,2,NA0KdkBesLiXgDogu2j5zg

I got a burger and fries. Not many fries and the burger was dry, but still okay.",BdMzGeY0LS9XWqRg8HQbLg,0,0,4,PfUOI27KNDx9Xo07daI-7w

The people next to us looked like they didn't have anything on their table either and they were there before us.,ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,3,0,1,G1q59x3gU5s26r6lVcqf6Q

The coffee was hot and strong, the portions were large and very tasty. The staff was attentive and friendly. I can highly recommend it.",4mfJ8VUEE3cOHIgreigWtQ,0,0,4,UdG72sjhSCFwxDI55Ms9Zw

It was slopped on the chips. I definitely ordered the wrong item. I was never asked if it was ok. Only given a bill... Hummmm who does this? As far as a cool place to go it's really cool. Decorations are awesome. So, if you want to go to this place, remember no nachos. The staff seemed really friendly. 80s music playing while I was there today. Not sure if it's always like this.",RnHpI-1r4DDKgMjoYXPIQw,0,0,3,FCKFSUPfoN8IG27O81m4Ag
5229014,2015-06-24,4,fBdZXMF0QyhehC_fri4JZg,"Meh....

I came out for karaoke last night, and will probably not return unless its a special occasion. 

I don't really understand the decor...there's a cowboy riding a giant prawn hanging from the ceiling, and a giant platypus over the bar...its a little weird.  

Drinks are expensive, and their ""specials"" are on really crappy beer.  

Karaoke was fun, but apparently the owner or manager of the bar doesn't like the music loud...I will never understand bars that want karaoke, but don't allow the host to play the music loud enough for the singers to hear.   It got a bit better as the bar filled up, the volume was turned up, but...I want to sing like a rockstar, and that requires loud music.  You can't half ass Pat Benatar. 

It was ok, but there are definitely cheaper places to drink with better regulations for sound.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,3,2,2,0SGlbPOWkLRCO4yqKLtUGw

5285700,2017-09-18,0,fBdZXMF0QyhehC_fri4JZg,Great bar and great prices! I got the Cobb salad (without meat) and the fried mushrooms which are very good! As a vegetarian I could find options which is unusual at a bar most of the time. The happy hour specials are also a plus!

Next time in I lost $200 and they comped my beer, made me pay for the food but again bartender very nice.  Last time in I won $100, paid for my food and was totally ignored by the bartender.  She actually seemed like she was angry that I won and that it was an inconvenience to make change so I could tip the food waitress.  Too many other options out there to be treated like this.",VR2BOYPZFtpmcjypmBvkvw,3,0,2,mYJ9f-Izl-b5HnC_s9z6jA

5950126,2017-03-19,0,fBdZXMF0QyhehC_fri4JZg,We saw this place by chance on our way to Osaka and decided to give it a try. The first thing you notice is a very particular decoration! So pretty! Great neighborhood atmosphere and it looks like there are a lot of locals which is a good thing. The drinks are very cheap so you can actually stay longer with your friends. I was (successfully) gambling long enough and our server comped my drink. The staff is very friendly and the food is good. A burger and fries were way under 10 bucks. How can you complain. Great time. We will definitely come back for more.,wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,0,1,5,pEV19KtJRtFrnHcXQnmM0w
