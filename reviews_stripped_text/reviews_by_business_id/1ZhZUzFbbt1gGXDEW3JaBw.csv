700614,2017-06-29,0,1ZhZUzFbbt1gGXDEW3JaBw,My favorite pool hall in the west coast! This was an old pool hall that was taken over and completely demolished. The owner literally started from scratch! And the outcome is nothing less than first class! The Wynn of Pool Halls! Too nice for pool players. Definitely a place to take a date. It has a beautiful bar and the kitchen has a good menu. The design makes it the most comfortable pool hall I've ever been to. There's a custom super comfy seating that surrounds the entire place. Cell phone chargers at every other table. The lighting is done well and makes the place look modern and does not have that typical pool hall look. Black Diamond Tables both 7' and 9'. Lots of HDTVs from anywhere you sit. The bathrooms are super clean like the top casinos in town. Everything is just top class! A must see place that you will definitely go back to.,u7eeg-lVKFNwvu28HtstKQ,1,0,5,8gi0pP4iIaj5kGSsBDxQXg

1349250,2017-02-04,0,1ZhZUzFbbt1gGXDEW3JaBw,"I had a very interesting experience tonight at Griffs. A friend of mine told me about Griffs and how it was so much nicer than the previous place Pool Sharks. I have to say it was an amazing atmosphere, beautiful place, new tables . At first it looked like I was going to have a great night. I walked in and was greeted by a nice man by the name of""Thumbs"" which I though was the coolest old man I have ever met. I proceeded to go to the bar for my first drink of the night and the bartender was awesome. She was funny, and knew what she was doing when I ordered my whisky on the rocks. Told me about a better whiskey than my normal Jim beam. I ended up ordering a bullet rye as suggested by amber (the said bartender). I was thankful as I throughly enjoyed the flavor much more than Jim beam. Things were looking up until it came time to enjoy a few games and a few more whisky's. As my girlfriend and I started our game , we looked for our server so we could order another round. About 15 min of waiting and still no service. I went back to the bar and asked if we had to come and get a drink every time. Amber told us no , that our server would be right with us. I did end up ordering another from her as we waited so long. As we played a few games, my girlfriend got a little hungry . We decided to order food , but yet again we're left waiting as we saw our server watching TV. She was shorter lady in what looked to be wearing a blanket. We finally waived her down and asked about the nachos. She at this time had no idea how to answer if they had liquid cheese or shredded. Her answer was , I don't know what does the menu say? Not the answer we were looking for as paying customers. Other than the horrible service, and the fact that when I asked to speak to a manager , he was apparently not present, everything else was great. I will say Thumbs was amazing and amber and her cocktails were absolutely delicious. My girlfriend had a "" Tropical storm"", well 3 actually lol. I would love to come back and give it another shot, but next time I will not be waiting for service, I will just go to the bar where I felt like I was appreciated.

Update on my second visit:
  So I want to be fair and give Griffs another shot. I came back after a subpar experience the last time I was in due to horrible service. As I am in the food and beverage industry and have been for a very long time I know that sometimes you gotta give a place another shot. This time my friends and I decided to make it a guys night. We walked in and I was very happy to see my favorite door man ""Thumbs""!! Again was greeted by him and felt very welcomed. Saw my awesome bartender again Amber and she knew right off the back to pour my new favorite a double Bullet Rye on the rocks. Got our table and this time the service was AMAZING!! There was a band which played some fun music and made it much more lively. Our server B was aw some. Very funny, sweet, attentive , and knew her stuff. We never had to wait for a drink, we ordered wings and chicken fingers , then B convinced me that I needed fries which I completely fell for and am glad I did! All in all I will definitely be coming back here for my birthday celebration in 3 weeks and will telling my friends at work about Griffs. I have a feeling this will be the new place for us after a long night at work. As long as Thumbs is at the door, Amber is behind the bar and B are there , we will be frequently returning with more people. I hate to say it, but as long as I don't have to put up with our last server again, We will be regulars at Griffs.",eWjOpwT29ALgoaYfTMo0oQ,3,0,2,KFhWTseo08q7cGYfwNVqUQ

Good drinks, clean bathrooms. I have yet to try the food but the menu looks bomb. And the plus of it all: NON SMOKING!  Yes, winning all around.

We played pool for about an hour before dinner and ordered food and drinks.  As we left, I paid the waitress at the back register for our beers and food and tipped her accordingly.  I then turned immediately to my left to the bartender and asked her how much for the pool time. She said it was $12. I handed her three $5 bills. She said ""thank you"" and didn't return any change.  The rest of the exchange went like this.  

Me:  You said $12, right?
Bartender (B):  That's right.  
Me:  We still need to get our change. 
B:  Oh, I thought you were tipping. 
Me:  We paid our waitress for the food and drinks and tipped her already
B:  Oh, no it's fine, I thought you were tipping for the beers, but it's fine.  You don't have to tip if you don't want to.
Me:  We tipped our waitress.  We never ordered any food or drinks from you. 
B:  No it's fine.   You don't have to tip.  

*I KID YOU NOT!  THIS GIRL TOLD ME TWICE IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE AFTER I ALREADY TIPPED OUR WAITRESS FOR FOOD AND DRINKS THAT WE DIDNT HAVE TO TIP IF WE DIDNT WANT TO!  I NEVER ORDERED A SINGLE DRINK FROM THIS GIRL!  ALL SHE EVER DID FOR ME AT ANY POINT WAS HAND ME A CUE BALL IN EXCHANGE FOR MY ID AND THEN HAND IT BACK WHEN WE LEFT AND THEN INTENTIONALLY TRY AND SHAME ME IN FRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS!

I was given the wrong change and when I brought it to the attention of the server, and then manager, they made excuse after excuse about why it wasn't correct. From ""We don't carry change"" to ""We round off""(in our favor) to ""We ran out of change and was going to bring it to you""(After 40 minutes had already passed) to ""Nobody has ever complained about us doing this before in the last 3 years""(we've been robbing people)...that's right. The manager was really proud of the fact that he's been getting away with doing this for years without anyone saying anything. 

Yeah, I know. It's petty. It's not a lot of money. It's just change. That may be true, but it's MY change. I should get to choose what I do with it. AND if I choose to ask about it, it should be corrected without all the name calling and rudeness that the manager started with. 

They do have nice equipment, but so do a lot of pool halls in Vegas. I suggest going someplace like Good Timez Billiards instead where they have excellent equipment AND honest employees.",23DeAJxYiB5DwRKaVGx6iA,0,0,1,RNs6lBKSKK0rUj-LykJC7A

This place just has a down side for me. 
The bartenders absolutely suck. 
The female bartender that was there before midnight made me a delicious Mai Tai and a blue Hawaiian which was a little off but still okay. Now the bartender that is there after midnight has NO IDEA what he's doing, why in the world is he a bartender?? I asked the waitress for 2 Mai tais, she had no idea what I was talking about even asked me what was in it. When I get my drink I immediately see its a different color so I taste it and tell the waitress it's not a Mai Tai, she becomes defensive and proceeds to tell me it's $9 now I paid $6.50 for the last drink so now price goes up after midnight or what?? She tells me she doesn't know anything that id have to argue with the bartender at that point I gave up and just drank my $9 watered down apple juice with rubbing alcohol. 
I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of experienced bartenders, I like a good drink with a good game so this is sad for me. Not to mention their fountain drinks are $6, yikes.",_iJGSqe5AcELZK3_s9XH3Q,0,0,3,Neg620bCodArAukGm8A4mw
2217622,2018-04-27,1,1ZhZUzFbbt1gGXDEW3JaBw,"The last time I was in this place, it was called Pool Sharks. The tables were decent for the most part, but like every other pool hall in town, it reeked of smoke (and so did you after a tournament)... the floors were uneven in places... the chairs/stools were on their last leg... and you had to hold your breath to go to the bathroom - oh, and I usually walked to the international market around the corner to get decent food.

All I can say is wow, what a transformation. I'll have to spend more time in there before I rank it as the #1 pool hall that I've ever been to... but it's on the short list for sure. Great remodel job - looks nice, doesn't smell like a stale ashtray, plenty of seating area for rail birds, cozy area for hanging out off to the side, plenty of TVs, thoughtful layout re: the pool players (and even teams for league), nice lighting, nice highlighting, boardroom type colors with hunter green & wood paneling, tasteful art... just really well done. Classy. Congrats. Do we give the credit to Sunny??

I was hungry so I ate - nice looking menu, and the food I had was great. I had the Mosconi Meatball Sandwich. Very tasty. I substituted Onion Rings and those were great as well. I washed all that down with Diet Coke and the staff was very attentive in bringing me refills (as usual, I was thirsty in the dry air of Las Vegas).

I can't say that I'm a fan of the Cyclop balls, but I guess that's a personal issue that I'll have to take up with my therapist. At least they're clean and shiny Cyclop balls.

I also complained about how they did away with the all day rate for $10.00 when a pool event was going on at the Orleans Casino.

2852474,2016-11-28,0,1ZhZUzFbbt1gGXDEW3JaBw,"There's a new best pool room in Las Vegas, and it's called Griff's. The tables are first rate Diamonds with plenty of 9-foot available as well as a behemoth 12-foot snooker model. They're perfectly maintained, well-lit, outlined for precise racking and ball spotting, and comfortably spaced. Also a generous supply of perfectly tipped cues of various weights and excellent condition are plentiful throughout the room. The seating is ample and couldn't be more comfortable, and the walls adorned with very cool classic posters featuring past greats of the game. This is a place that has to be seen to be appreciated, the photos on their website don't do it full justice. The eats are excellent, (dynamite potato skins) and the drinks are beneficiaries of very healthy pours. Even the bathrooms are so clean they have a photo on their site, nobody does that unless they take great pride in every aspect of the operation. That's definitely the case here, and it's clear the owner(s) spared no expense and attention to detail to offer the area the finest pool hall possible. Even the music is at a perfect volume to enjoy and augment the ambience but not too loud, as other places often are, as to make conversation difficult; and it's thankfully chosen by the management, not a jukebox at the mercy of the patrons. The playlist was enjoyed by myself, and my son and his buddy, age range 21-64, that's no small feat. Plenty of TV monitors are situated around the room to keep up with the latest sporting events as well. The rates and food/drink prices are very competitive, especially considering the high level of the accommodations. The non-smoking atmosphere is also a huge positive that can't be overstated. I can't think of any negatives to mention, my only hope is that when they get video poker that it's limited to the bar area and not located by the tables. Griff's should be right at the top of any list of best pool rooms in Las Vegas, it's not even close.

On Decatur near Twain, parking was not an issue on a Wednesday night around 7pm. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the bartender who asked if we wanted a table and what size. Standard or 9 ft. We weren't sure, but went for the smaller table. I'm short and didn't feel like sprawling on a large table! She gave us the cue ball and told us our table number.

First thing we noticed looking at the pool floor was that it was quiet. There were about 7 tables in front with players, but they were focused. It might have been a league. Since I've never seen league play, I don't know if that's the etiquette...or maybe it just happened to be a bunch of serious players. In any case, I liked that atmosphere. Music and TVs weren't too loud either. 

The server was attentive and I liked that she checked on us a few times while we played. I will come back again since I want to become a pool shark  I'm just a guppy now, but with some practice, I hope to become an adolescent. I recommend this place if you want a clean, smoke free place to shoot pool. They also serve food, but we didn't order anything from the menu - maybe next time.

I usually don't like pool halls because of the way they are designed here. I was having an awesome time playing pool until the server came over to us to offer us drinks, we ordered, and asked about the food, she responded ""kitchens closed"", with an attitude and walked away before we could say never mind about the drinks, since we wanted them with food not without. We looked for her to cancel and couldn't find her so we canceled at the bar. She then finds us and tells us ""you're paying for your drinks whether you like it or NOT""... it was honestly the rudest thing any server has ever said. It's not like we weren't going to pay for the drinks we ordered since we couldn't find her to cancel, she didn't have to be so rude. I probably won't return here. Customer service is everything whether the place looks nice or not.",Aj1zhoGxdris_q-97TY3KQ,0,0,3,vK3F1KC-G1FUvBuktPgY4Q

This time I brought my bro-in-law Robert to play some pool and he was blown away at how great Griff's looked like. He remember the the old place called pool sharks and it was very smokey and the food wasn't that great either. He's impressed that Griff's has also non smoking and a full menu the gal Aileen the bartender was very help ful as to what to drink also she remembered what I like to drink and its been like 6 months. I've been coming here since it opened and I'm still happy to co.e here to play pool or just to watch a sporting event too. That have karaoke as well on Fridays i think.,kp4asCUZuPCenSulOOxozQ,0,0,5,MMaFe1GWvmfVon7kbjtpGg

After explaining the restrictions to our waitress, the cook himself came out to talk to us and figure out what on the menu they could eat safely. The level of service we got was above and beyond what you'd get at a typical fancy restaurant. At a pool hall, that's almost unheard of. 

The food was delicious, the table we played on was very nice, and the atmosphere of the hall is great. It's non-smoking, which is much appreciated, and as a result I could totally see spending several hours there playing pool. I will be back!",IMZDQSvAS0el4kZ-tv_pIA,0,0,5,WuMvagK_5_EF_-B4RoxiOQ

The place had tons of people playing pool, but the tables for diners were wide open. I was greeted and offered a beer right away. I browsed the menu, and just couldn't resist trying the Cuban sandwich with a side of onion rings. Both the sandwich and onion rings were amazing. My only complaint would be that the menu listed the sandwich as having dijon on it, but the cook must've forgot about it, because it wasn't there. I would totally order it again though.
Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. If I get stuck in Vegas for work again, I'll definitely head back to Griff's.",dondbMHw80Qn6gUMKd1zEg,0,0,4,zuj065eT5mQBdjn_icIrEQ
