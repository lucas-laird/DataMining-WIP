I ordered two chicken burrito and gave her my coupon and assumed that it would be $3.19 for the two chicken burritos. She said you already got the special 2 for $5 so I can't use your coupon. Ok, my coupon would be cheaper. Why are you forcing me to pay for the  special price when my coupon is cheaper. At the end, I reconfirmed with her if all my food was in the bag. She said yes. Came home, opened the bag, three tacos were not there that I already paid for. Also, everything was cold. Not hot, not even warm but cold. Not edible. That's why I drove back and went inside to talk to a manager. He was discourteous. When I told him there's items missing, he said what do you want me to do. I said take a look at the food because it's all cold. He said I don't have time for this. I can give you a refund. I took the refund and drove down the street to Taco Bell. Wasted my time.

I came here again last night (poor judgement on my part) and even though there were three cars in line I waited 17 minutes (I timed it). Oh and it's very expensive as well. A large #8 which is a drink, fries, tiny taco and medium burrito is $9.25. Go to subway, get a foot long with chips and a drink and you're paying $7.50.

The soft shell chicken taco was juicy and flavorful and not too much to eat. A lot of cheese on it and I like that!

I went up later for some ranch. They said .50 cents and then the girl in the back was like it's ok just give it to him. Appreciate not being charged for a small side of ranch. We all know y'all got an abundance back there.

One male employee and only one working this time was touching and changing all the trash out on the floors and outside and wiping all tables. I appreciate that, I don't appreciate him NOT washing his hands before getting back to work. Even if you don't touch food you wash your hands while in a food prep environment.

Always be aware anyone can see this in an open kitchen. Besides that. Good experience here. Some staff may need to learn health code a little more.",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,1,2,3,T2_0WxE4fUio9CzXlYnyjQ
