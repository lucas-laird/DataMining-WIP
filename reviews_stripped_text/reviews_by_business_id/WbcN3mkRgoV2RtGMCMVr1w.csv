1361361,2017-10-20,0,WbcN3mkRgoV2RtGMCMVr1w,I can't believe my son just went to get a sub I was starting to get worried because it's a few minutes from the house when he went in there and had to wait 10 minutes before ringing the bell and then no one still appeared for another two minutes.  And then was rude like yeah?  Well??   That's my money he's spending and I could've spent it somewhere else....my son is turning 19 is not a child you should not be treated like some obsolete teenager.  Maybe he will the guy up from a nap who knows....my sons to mellow to be upset....but I'm at said that he had to do that and be gone so long that I had to worry about him driving.,bHtXt8AkP3w-cANI1tz8Pw,0,0,1,e69t-FGF8A7OMk3MWtG-IA

Their employees seem to have very little training, and there is never a manager around to help them.  Unfortunately, I find this on par with ALL subway restaurants in Las Vegas.  Try a Port of subs, or Jersey Mikes.  They always have enough staff to serve their customers in a timely manner.

It is now 11:15 and I still have the same 4 people in front of me. 
One sandwich artists, and the order she is working on is apparently huge!

There's never a wait at this location when I stop by here, which is usually during breakfast or dinner times.

I'm not sure why you put minimal spinach (if I asked for it, obviously I like it) and why are you counting the pickles? 

Also, why didn't you sign out of the other employee's register log on? Had you logged in as yourself, I could have put your name in this review. 

The employee's log on that you used is actually THE BEST sandwich maker there, hands down. He's QUICK, courteous, and efficient. 

I said, ""Thank you, have a nice day."" And you looked at me, put your head down and continued what you were doing. I didn't mumble. So obviously you heard me but didn't have the decency to at least say thanks. Interesting...",wxkXoO2zlb2C2mYEwgL5cg,0,0,2,BwzXZrbBFAHkp6ELDkNLMQ

I have loved my local Subway from the very beginning! I hate to even confess this to you guys but I eat at this location probably 4 + times a month depending my mood and work schedule. That being said the staff is helpful, the chips are stocked, and I'm always happy and full when I leave. 

Thank you to the Management + Staff for keeping me feed for so many years lol!",g73QLrVANuqE8bdMlnIOXQ,2,1,5,5JYN2igm1rCoJiW8Xu1gFQ
3167907,2015-01-15,3,WbcN3mkRgoV2RtGMCMVr1w,"Never in my wildest of Yelping dreams did I imagine that I'd be giving Subway a 3 star review. For the most part, I'm just not a fan of the chain as a whole. But this particular location is different...and having lived just around the corner from here for about 3 years now, I've been here enough to say this one sets itself apart from any other one I've been too.

It is located in the Albertsons shopping center off of Farm & Durango just a few doors down from Starbucks. While fairly small like most Subway locations, this is easily one of the cleanest and most well-kept fast food restaurants. Every time we've been here, the place is spotless both in the dining area and behind the counter. All the separate areas for things like chips and sodas are well organized. Just seconds after someone leaves, they are coming through to wipe up and straighten everything up. It's really a very well run spot and honestly, that's just nice to see.

Now, as far as the food goes...it's still a Subway. Most of the time the sandwiches are a major hit and miss and don't deserve but 2 stars on their own. Sometimes the bread is obviously old, sometimes the ingredients have clearly been sitting out for a while and sometimes something just doesn't taste right. But every now and then you can a pretty decent sandwich here, and they're fairly cheap too. Most 6"" subs can be had for under $5 and I usually get the Spicy Italian with double meat ($1.50 extra) that comes out to $5.50. Not that I'm anywhere near worried about watching what I eat, even though I should be, but I feel better about spending six bucks on this opposed to a greasy burger or burrito. Sure, I love those things a lot more, but a sandwich really hits the spot sometime. Plus I'm a huge fan of putting cucumbers on my sandwich and that is strangely one of my biggest reasons for coming here over other sandwiches chains in the area. I also like the different sauces they offer, including the Creamy Sriracha sauce that I think is really tasty. 

But what really makes us frequent this Subway, is the staff. They move really quick and we've never had to wait more than a couple minutes. Pretty much every single employee we've dealt with has been great, and one of the managers in particular is just straight up a nice dude. They're always extremely friendly and not once have we been rushed or gotten attitude like you expect from fast food chains. Even during a summer visit where their AC was out, these guys were smiling and going about their job without a hitch. In this Vegas heat, that's a feat all on its own. 

There's no argument that much, much better sandwiches can be found in Las Vegas, even if you're just looking at chains. But Subway has cheap ones that can be decent, and our family of 3 can easily eat and be full for well under $20. And with service that's all but unheard of in fast food, we will definitely continue to be repeat customers.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,4,4,3,JlgdayICp8FCa1kttSfz4A
3341194,2014-03-01,3,WbcN3mkRgoV2RtGMCMVr1w,"Stopped in with part of the family to grab some sandwiches to go. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. It seemed a little dark going in. Not sure if this is typical or if a light might have been out. I opted for a six inch Cold Cut Combo, which was actually rather filling. I usually do a foot long, but six inches satisfied this time. We also ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, but got Pastrami by mistake. The kid ate it anyway and said it was pretty tasty. We will return.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,1,1,3,fLBe4urIaBILu_3MeNtxTA
3602970,2016-12-10,0,WbcN3mkRgoV2RtGMCMVr1w,So I use to like this location because they were so sweet and sanitary... I can honestly so its no longer that case... I'm a vegan and I ask for gloves to be changed so the meat that they handled from the previous she helped would touch my food ... she went to cut my sub with the same knife that she cut with the person before me that had meat on her sub ... I stopped her before she cut it and rolled her eyes ... I didn't take a picture of the actual counter but meat was inside the veggies and cheese ... just somewhere I can no longer go ...,3vAh1vNvBmVwGWK0vQV-og,0,0,1,RMimPTt2KhU1RPt0paO16A

The staff is friendly and super sweet to my kids when we come in PLUS pretty good sandwich makin.'  I also like that your place is always clean. 
My only complaint and major concern is the LIGHTING in your parking lot at night is absolutely horrendous!  It's so dark and creepy that I feel very unsafe & nervous when I step out onto the parking lot from my car and when I leave your restaurant. You need to contact property management or whoever to change and improve your light fixtures outside your building. I believe the light fixtures have a tile of some kind in front of it. The tile should be removed and be replaced with a cover that is transparent or emits more light. I have debated several times if I should drive to another Subway a mile or two farther just because I do not feel safe in your parking lot at night.
Please take this seriously and change the lighting in front of your building.  Thank you so much and we hope to come back and see a brighter & safer place at night.",RbGmtskcl0iZA6oE-NdAVA,0,0,4,odRBAPs4NcjLYjxUGmKoaw
5635741,2015-09-09,1,WbcN3mkRgoV2RtGMCMVr1w,"Not impressed with online ordering from this location!  While online you can't change or add a pick up time, nor is there a place for extra notes (example: dressing on the side). I placed my online order & immediately called the store.   No answer, call again, no answer.   Wait a few minutes, call again.  No answer.  I checked the phone number, it's correct.  I call again.  I switch phones thinking maybe they don't answer blocked numbers.  No answer.   I tried approximately 25 minutes!   I wanted to tell them not to make my sandwiches now, wait 45 minutes!   Had they answered the phone, they would have known.  I get there & advise them, your phone is broke or disconnected.  To my surprise I got ""we were busy"" we couldn't answer the phone.   Really now?    Then the employee tells me, I did hold off on making you sandwiches a few minutes.  ??? How would you know, you never answered the phone!  So, with 2 sandwiches made, I was out the door.  Were they  fresh?  NO!!!  Why?!  They sat over 30+ minutes!    
So if this store can't be bothered by answering a phone for 25 minutes, I can't be bothered by going back.",x4U6QY33adODiZUEXmAE8g,0,0,2,S_d0iA0L3wuNZYF8lUEAMA

I work in the same shopping complex, eating at Subway is convenient. However, todays experience aggravated me to the point of getting upset. The inept hospitality and speed of there staff is mind boggling!!! 

I walked over today, approached the counter with zero line. I asked for a 6"" Sandwich. My order was confirmed with an eye roll of annoyance by the worker. I proceeded to ask for a toasted sandwich. The two people behind me ordered 6"" tuna sandwiches.  These sandwiches we prepared before mine, while my sandwich sat on the counter, GETTING COLD! After this point, my sandwich was prepped to be finished, upon asking for salt & pepper and Oregano, SO MUCH WAS USED THAT IT MADE MY SANDWICH BARLEY EDIABLE!!!! Thirdly I asked for Avocado on my sandwich, I have never seen such poor cutting skills EVER! I paid to have piece not slivers of avocado. 

To add insult to injury the cutting knife was cleaned on the parchment that my sandwich was being prepped on, HELLO CROSS CONTAMINATION!!! 

If you are wanting to eat here for lunch, give yourself extra time & make sure you don't have an expectation of how your food should look or taste. 

Thankfully, I had a coupon for a 6' sandwich so I didn't pay for this experience!",AY8X73vSCeBVdZshq0yjig,0,0,1,w_HA45Jpde3Xl5oyipSzAw
