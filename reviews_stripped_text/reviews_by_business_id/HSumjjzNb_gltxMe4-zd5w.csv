I just ordered a double pepperoni pizza with their famous thin crust. It was absolutely delicious, I was not disappointed! They were generous with the sauce and the cheese too! They also have a drive through so you can order, run an errand, then come back to pick it up or phone in your order and pick up in the drive through. The only drawback might be if you like to dine in. There are only 3 tables in this tiny place that seat 2 people each but I personally like to bring my pizza home with me.  The ingredients all were fresh and delicious! I will definitely be coming back! My son loves wings so we'll also be giving them a try too!",h4w6AhswqV8u90OMobuISA,2,0,4,VVpMJg2TqjtUaKz40swLfA

91636,2015-03-23,0,HSumjjzNb_gltxMe4-zd5w,"They say 3rd time is a charm. I recently went to Vinny's for the 3rd time - more or less because its close to where I live and we(gf and I) wanted some pizza while heading out for the day.

The first 2 times I went the service was very slow, but could be expected because the place  had just opened. Giving the benefit of doubt, I assumed this was why(service was so slow) and gave it a 3rd try recently.

The 3rd experience, we ordered their pizza/soda special, which is basically a personal pan pizza and a soda.....After  watching 3 orders come in, and go out before us, and 30 minutes go by, I asked if the pizza would be out shortly and the manager(I believe - the guy giving orders anyway) said they would be out in 5 more minutes.

15 more minutes go by  and 1 more order out before us, that ordered after us, we finally get our pizza.

They did ask us if we wanted a free desert(for our wait), and said it would only take a couple minutes to prepare - We declined as we did not want to wait any longer.

The pizza, it was good - That's what the 2 stars were for.",A1VEdD6UZGIlVvnwoCm_ew,0,0,2,d0Ac54ZebUAqss51PfVBRQ

Their chicken fingers and wings are the reason to go there, first off. Their breading is perfect and they're just fresh and moist.  I'd go there over BWW's, Popeyes and Caine's any day of the week.

Salads are huge and a great value. I really like the garden salad with their Italian dressing. 

Pizzas are very well done.  I got the supreme and that delicious sucker was loaded with toppings like peppers, ham, sausage and bacon. Yes, that's right.  I suggest the thin crust, it's not super thin like most are used to.  

Delivery within 3 miles is free and staff is always friendly, a major plus when you're tired after work or just plain lazy like I am. 

Read the comments before mine and still decided to try the place. I asked the manager about their yelp reviews. Apparently there was a previous cook who kept messing up the orders and has since been replaced.",GIloQ13qb61KDodq3mlqgQ,5,1,5,qB6bsNdT82g0lHctnvUd6Q

If you are the owner reading this, trust me, if you want this joint to succeed, you are going to HAVE to run a sick special like $5 or $6 pizza specials just to get traffic in your door to get people trying and talking about it. If people don't come in, they won't buy it, if they don't try it, they can't tell everyone how good it is.  Your food network advertisement is a silly ploy.

2984957,2015-09-08,6,HSumjjzNb_gltxMe4-zd5w,"Worst experience ever ordering a pizza. I ordered a pepperoni mushroom tonight and gave the lady my address and apt #. When she read the addy back she didn't get the apt # so I repeated it and she said nothing after except ""We'll be there in 30-40 minutes.""

     30 or 40 minutes later I get a call from the driver saying ""The dispatched never gave your apt # and I can't find you."" I go outside and find the guy driving around and eventually flag him down. I gave him a 20 dollar bill on an $11.89 check and he rifles through his pockets and holds up 2 one dollar bills. ""This is all I have man."" He went on to claim that almost all of their orders are credit cards even though I told the dispatcher I was paying cash. I said ""I guess this is your lucky day"" and give him the 20. He says ""Thanks"" and walked away without even offering to give me the 2 dollars in change.

    What a piece of crap delivery driver, but it gets worse.

3112229,2017-03-30,0,HSumjjzNb_gltxMe4-zd5w,"One of the best pizzas that I've ever had in my life. I tried Vinny's on a whim due to tiring of the nearby Subway's evening choices, and was not disappointed. Although Vinny's delivers and has very limited seating both inside and out, I decided to dine in anyway since I didn't have much to do on an early Saturday afternoon.

The very enthusiastic & jovial female blonde employee recommended the deep dish stuffed pizza after I saw another employee take it out of the oven for a delivery. For a medium pizza that has eight slices, the pizza is a bit on the pricey side (about $17-18), and takes about 20 minutes to make. I had planned on waiting at one of the tables anyway, yet was slightly disappointed that there wasn't any WiFi at this venue (unlike everyone else). No worries. The time went by fast as it is. 

When presented with the pizza, I felt as if the box weighed between 5-7 lbs. My first reaction was ""Holy f**k, that's one stuffed pizza!"" Along with a Pepsi (no alcohol served here), I could only eat about four slices. I made up my mind to take the other four slices back to the hotel for later due to my stomach being stuffed as thoroughly as a Thanksgiving turkey. The flavoring of the pizza (only a sausage, pepperoni and onion variety) was blended in correctly, and the end product itself wasn't undercooked, or overcooked. 

This was certainly one of the best Chicago-style pizzas that I've had in a long time that would make any Giordano's or Lou Malnati's proud. That, and you'll get good service too.",0sl4I8R7znWXp_K4A0nZ_w,6,2,5,RaZey-pjkWP_Mgz0DRuBhw

I order a large stuffed meat lover's pizza for delivery. (in the past, we always went to the location for pick up) It came fairly quickly.   It was burnt (see picture posted)  clearly burnt.  Dark black on the edges?  I know they have to put this pizza through twice.  It's always been a little darker on the edges, but never black black.  

I call in immediately and ask what's the deal?  The person who answered simply told me ""It's not burnt, it just looks that way because it has to go through the oven twice.""  umm?  Ok, this is the only type of pizza I have ever ordered from your place.  I've ordered maybe 10 of them in the last year.  They have never come out BLACK.  The remedy was, ""I can give you credit for another pizza for next time.""  I don't think there will be a next time.

Get your customer service together.  You could have offered to send another pizza immediately.  Oh wait, you could have LOOKED at the pizza and not sent it out in the first place.

I got a large Chicago style deep dish with pepperoni, bacon, and sausage for $20.  Decent sized pizza, but I was expecting it to be ""deeper.""

3838326,2015-05-29,1,HSumjjzNb_gltxMe4-zd5w,"We were in the mood for a deep dish Pizza, so we thought we would have Vinny's Pizzeria deliver a medium Pepperoni, Mushroom, and Sausage Pie. The pie was delivered hot and fresh in 31 minutes. They had estimated 45-60 minutes.

The crust was a perfect golden brown on the bottom, and cooked through on top. The flavor was hampered by too little salt in the dough mixture. The sauce was slightly sweet, and lacked any Basil or Oregano flavor, which was a minus. The toppings were fresh and had very good flavor, but the amount of toppings was disappointing.  

All in all, here's how I graded the experience:

Ease of ordering.                    A
Delivery time.                          A
Delivery temperature.             A

Value.                                      B

We called at 7:17pm....8 piece fingers with ranch, 15 piece wings plain with a side of their house sweet sriracha and a side of ranch and a side salad with 1000 island.
