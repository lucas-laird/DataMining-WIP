I didn't know what to expect considering I had gone to this restaurant a few years back when it was located in the Venetian, and received horrible service (and the food wasn't much better.) We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, the bartender was super friendly and our drinks were very strong, but still tasty. We started with chips & salsa and the spicy guacamole. It was a lot spicier than I thought it would be, but it was still pretty good. The boyfriend and I ordered chicken quesadillas to share, they were delicious and it was such a large portion that we couldn't finish it. This place definitely redeemed itself since my last visit, everyone in our group enjoyed their meal and we would definitely come back.",8WOX53mnhkOj6Uo59maCzg,3,1,5,nmrm1K888HjBA-4LcGYn3g

Hi Dave,

Thank you so much for taking the time on Yelp to let us know about your visit to Dos Caminos in Las Vegas.

It truly means a lot to hear from you and we appreciate your honest feedback regarding our margaritas. Please know that we do make all of our margaritas fresh and made to order.

It seems that the waiters take the order and someone else does the rest (another person brought the food, drinks, refills, etc.).  We never saw our waiter again until he handed us the bill.  The food is spicy, even if you order mild.  It just didn't have a good taste to it.  Agave, which was the name of this previous restaurant, was much, much better.  The food is expensive, too.

513090,2013-04-10,0,jPvn-C8kNUcyGfjUtOc_oA,"Quite simply, too expensive for what they are offering. I don't mind paying extra for mexican food when it stands out. However, this was fair at best. The staff was pleasant and good looking, but for how slow it was it would have been beneficial for the manager to stop by the table for a quick intro and survey our experience. This would have probably led to us resolving our dissatisfaction and a better review. 

Started with some cocktails and some of their guacamole. The drinks were a buck or two more than they should have been, but they were good, (watermelon margarita and a mojito). The guacamole was tasty, serving size was good for two, but it definitely needed salt and their was none on the table. It also had a overwhelming creamy flavor like it had been mixed with too much sour cream or something.

The salsa trio they brought to the table was good. My wife had carnitas tacos, which were just basic bare-bones street style tacos, which definitely needed more to the dish to be worth the price. I had the brisket enchilada. This was a $17 enchilada. I was happy to pay this, but the price definitely set my expectations high. When it came, the presentation was nice, it came in a cast iron pan, covered with gooey cheese. The brisket was thin cut into long sandwich style strips and layered in the bottom of the pan and covered with sauce. Great effort was required to cut through it as well as chew it. It was so tough it reminded me of shoe leather. For some reason I though it was slow cooked, but the menu said smoked. I had about three bites and then just stopped eating because I was so disappointed. If this is going to remain on the menu they should slow cook the brisket until its soft enough to eat. I might wait several months and give it one more chance, but probably not.",4puga78OgQaTWsoK-0YwDw,1,0,2,QFGNq-0inxWVi6sz5ulLMQ

732657,2013-05-19,1,jPvn-C8kNUcyGfjUtOc_oA,"Very disappointing. Where do I begin?

1. My wife and I each ordered a margarita, and we both felt that the tub mixes you buy at Bed Bath & Beyond are better. Way sugared down and way over-priced for the quality of the mix.
2. The menu advertises ""a trio of salsa's"" with your appetizer or meal, but these tasted like they were out of a can and the menu should have said ""a trio of salsa's - two tablespoons of each"". I guess it's good you don't get much.
3. The music in a Mexican restaurant does not need to be Mexican or mariachi, but hearing Berlin followed by a karaoke version of David Bowie followed by 70's slow rock followed by another poor cover of an 80's one-hit wonder made me feel like I was in an off-strip casino listening to the house bar band on a bad night.
4. Very eclectic tables and wall art and light fixtures, somehow they just didn't all fit together.
5. I've had better Asada tacos at Taco Bell. My wife was not happy with her Pollo tacos either. Nothing special about the taste at all. Very bland.

I could go on. All this for $105 for two adults and two kids (again, one crappy margarita for my wife and I).

1075317,2013-03-23,1,jPvn-C8kNUcyGfjUtOc_oA,"Wife and I went here to experience the newest Mexican restaurant in our area.  Having been a fan of Agave which had previously been at this location we surely thought they must have closed for something better, this was not the case.  The menu seemed somewhat limited, they did not have burritos on the menu and had a quesadilla listed as a main dish.  They had Mexican Hamburgers listed which are just Tortas you could get at Roberto's.  

We ordered some chips and salsa, there was nothing special about them and they showed $3.00 on menu.  The medium hot salsa was more like a paste as opposed to regular salsa.  I ordered the chicken fajitas ($14.95) and the wife had grilled mahi mahi tacos ($12.95) for three small tacos.  The waiter said there was not a creamy sauce on the tacos when in fact there was.  The service was good but staff didn't seem too knowledgable about the menu. The wait for food didn't seem very long but it was a Thursday night and they weren't the busiest.  When my fajitas came out they came with 3 small tortillas which didn't appear to be enough to fit the fajitas in so I had to ask for more.  The wife enjoyed her fish tacos and also had a skinny margarita to drink which was good but she said was a little light on the tequila.  The menu was a little lackluster with limited options.

We were under the impression the rice and beans came with both meals and when we inquired to the bus boy he said he wasn't sure because it was his first day there.  I was going to tell him it was my first day there as well.  

All in all the food was alright and the prices were a little higher than what you would expect.  The interior didn't look too much different than Agave but maybe a little more decor.  There was an outside seating area off the bar with several fire places which wouldn't be a bad place for drinks when it warmed up a little more.  If we go back it will be just for drinks.",3J0390orc7RAgh31_aPvag,2,0,3,OJT1uqtCpZ9qAsRplljxuA

I thought I would have to get over staring at ""dead"" Agave; my old reliable friend, poor dead Agave!  Plus, the word on the street has been none too favorable and annotated with eye-rolling and heavy sighs.  We didn't start out with it as our destination, but it did look rather cute and sparkly from the outside so we put our trepidation on hold, took a deep breath...f*ck it, I'm goin in!

9:00 PM and this place was near empty.  So now it's a question if it's sad, creepy, or both, but being lazy and already there overrode that.  We checked to see if they were still serving, they were, until 10PM and we were greeted and seated promptly.  Turns out reverse HH was in progress, I feel my fear slipping away.

The decor still mimics its former life, just less festive and browner.  A bit too brown and bright, but still comfy.  Cassette tape music that seems a bit out of place, but hey, I like Bob Marley and Depeche Mode.  

No HH menu, but our server, Leah was quick to point out all our options and offer tips, plus she was great throughout our entire stay. We decided to just HH and started with a really tasty pitcher of fruit ladened sangria and a standard Margarita.

The guacamole was really expensive, though. $10 for a smallish bowl? I don't think I'll make that mistake again. The salsas that came with the chips were also delicious. Well, 2 out of 3. But the other one was tomatillo-based and I am really not a fan of those. My fiancé liked that one though.

I ordered a Cosmo Diablo, which was perfectly refreshing with a hint of pineapple and a touch of spice.  For my main course, I opted for the Carne Parrillada fajitas, which were to die for.  And to end it off, we ordered a couple of ice cream/sorbet choices for dessert.  My favorite flavor was the dulce de leche and then the mango sorbet.

Two things I didn't like about it was that when the restaurant was Blue Agave, it had wonderful trees and greenery in the patio area and created zones of privacy and intimacy.  Dos Caminos cut all the trees down and thus removed the character of the patio, to me.  Then the music didn't jive at all with the food and the menu.  It went from 80's WHAM! to disco  and no spanish flair to the music.  That was very incongruent to the experience. I left feeling like the restaurant can't decide what it wants to be, Mexican, tapas, bar, 80's vibe, what?

The Guac is just about the most amazing things you could order.  We had them make it spicy and it was creamy, delicious and spiced just enough to burn but not so much to where it ruined the rest of the meal.  The mini meatballs were delish, as were the tuna tartar bites.  I had a simply grilled salmon that was perfect!  My husband had the fajitas.  Amazing!
We ate outside on the patio, which was packed, and sat near the mini fire places which were lit at the end of our meal when the sun went down.  No one rushed us and we got to enjoy coffee and dessert.

Undercooked chewy chips that you pay extra for.

Before I go deeper I will say that the guac is very good but that does not save this place in any way. 

Lets start with the food. I ordered what is their version of fajitas, now I saw cheese on the list of ingredients for the dish, and to me meat and cheese is not a bad thing. What I did not expect is: mealy textured meat, as if defrosted wrong, meat cooked on a flat iron that had no flavor of its own and a puddle of salty, oily cheese that was disgusting. The flavors were out of balance and one of the worst dishes I have ever seen or tasted. The tortillas were wet and sticky on one side and dry on the other, I mean how do you screw that up??????

Service started out good, there was a delay in getting our first and second rounds of drinks, but I can understand a busy bar. The fact that our server filled up an ice tea a table away and did not bother to fill my water glass when it was empty was not good. But when she leaned across a railing that was behind me to ask me if I wanted another drink, is where it went down hill. Three steps more and she could have been table side. So now we forward to me telling our server about my main course, she takes it away, I never see a manager, and before we could consider ordering desert, coffee or even finish our second round of drinks she plops the check in front of my face. The asks ""Oh you didn't want any thing else did you?""  WOW! I have never been so insulted of felt like I was being told to 'Get the hell out' in my life. I was so mad I could not speak and no manager ever bothered to follow up with us about dinner.

The ambiance felt too much like a run down, Tijuana joint... it certainly has potential, but I felt the effort was not to the luxury that the Dos Camino's name is used to.

Food wise... the Guacamole was still fantastic... I had the Mahi Mahi Tacos, which were also good, but I heard conflicting reports on the Tuna Seviche.

My biggest concern was the fact that although they accepted Open Table reservations, they denied using OpenTable dollars for the meal.  It is embarrassing to show up to a venue, in hopes of using your rewards to assist in the bill payment, and to be denied because ""Corporate doesn't allow us to use gift cards/ OpenTable checks""... BS! Open Table is just like cash currency, they are required to use them... but instead of admitting that they don't know what they were doing, they denied me and advised that I must pay full price up front.

Being a lover of your guacamole and pescado tacos, we toured the valley of mexican restaurants while you were closed, trying to look for a place to satisfy our cravings.... Successful? Not even close. But then we heard about the news... Dos Caminos to open in Summerlin?  Uhmm... Thank god!! The gas bill driving out to Leticia's was becoming a little too high for our twenty-something-year-old-budgets.

My roommate and I made a date to try your new location on the fourth day of being open to the public.  The restaurant is much different than your old location, but I think it's fitting.  Although I miss the wall of skeletons at the old location, the skeleton paintings will do for now.  : )

The food lived up to expectations.  I found a new love, pollo asado.  The sauce is amazing.  I mean... wow.  I'll be craving the smokey flavors for days to come.  The guacamole is just what I remember it to be - perfect consistency, spiciness, and seasoning.  The trio of salsas is always a delight, but my favorite is the habenero.  The chips are not as good as I remember them being; they tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp far too long.

The only reason I gave your new location four stars (instead of five) is because of the restaurants ambiance.  The staff seemed to have some anxiety, I got a mild headache from watching them run in all different directions (almost bumping into each other several times).

We each had some version of tacos. No complaints.The fish tacos were a little spicy, but I do have a sensitive palate. 
The chips and sauces were more than enough for the three of us, and we shared a two-person order of guacamole and had a little left over because our food came before we finished it. 
Sat outside on the patio. It was a little windy, and they turned on the fire place about half hour after sunset. (As an East Coast transplant, always humored when 75 degrees = cold.) Service was totally fine; waitress was friendly and quick to meet our needs for more water and shared dessert. Music was '80s hits until abt 8 when they dimmed the lights and put on mariachi music. $30 a piece for tip, shared dessert, drink, guacamole, and entree. Sounds average for Summerlin.
Really not sure why so many poor reviews. I went to Agave once and liked it the food but really don't see much difference. Feel like others may be splitting hairs and comparing red apples to green apples.",KRGpbpX7nq4JctJirefzCA,1,0,4,PW_cWG5lntamJsTJLiPlBA

I was ready for a mission! Loose fitting clothing ... Check! Somewhat starved family... Check! Husband prepared for the financial damage.. Check! There was no way I could fail!

Forgetting this was a mission that had to be completed by two parties! Dos had to deliver or I'd be fighting a war of devastation.... And I deed that ended up being the case! 

We ordered guacamole, chips and salsa, the trio bocadito ( may be the name of the app), two kids slider meals, 1 kids quesadilla, smoked brisket enchiladas, and the short rib barbacoa. 

The guacamole app was the initial warning enforce the storm! Call me 730 coocoo but they used to offer the guacamole trio... Not anymore . What ev! So the guacamole was ok, but I needed more salt, there was none. (Can't you just not stand when a restaurant fees the food s so on point that salt and pep are not needed. . Well exsqueeze me for having such a palate) the salsas were ok. My fave was the red one.. Salt would have helped. Also not sure what was up with the chips but they were chewy as the first review stated. On to the main dishes. To begin, when do kids sliders resemble three hamburgers from McDonald's, minus the fact that they're served medium!!! What kid eats a medium burger?? 14$ down the drain. The cheese quesadilla was inedible smothered in cheese, I couldn't let my son (10 months) risk that cardiac attack so i sent it back! The beef short rib ish was flavorful, but the meat wasn't as tender as it could have been! It made it a bit rough to enjoy. The smoked brisket was ok also, just a king a bit in flavor. 

I feel this day coulda just been a clusterfracked day for them being it was opening day. Waaaay too many people in your grill when your eating, food just not up to par. Prices for quality ratio out of wack! I really wanted to enjoy my meal but 100$ tab left me feeling sick and confused as to what happened!

I was a huge fan of agave, the restaurant that was here previously, me and my family would come pretty regularly, that all changed tonight! 

By far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, after a nice long wait for a table we were greeted by a sour attitude waitress, waited ten min for water, and another 30 min to order food. With crapy wanna be salsa and something that they tried to pass as guacamole to keep us company I felt this dinner quickly going down the drain 

The menu selection is extremely poor, I'm not sure how they can call it Mexican food..  

To what seemed like an hour wait and I'm sure it was close to that since it took us from 7 pm till 9:45 to finally leave.. we got our sad pitiful over priced sorry excuse for mex food. the food was cold and way to spicy for something on the menu that wasn't supposed to be. It took 3 times to ask for a side of sour cream, They brought out rice and beans for table share and when it was set on the table I laughed !! Think one bite wonder for something that was supposed to feed 6 people

When I said something to a manager about how I was extremely disappointed with everything she looked at me confused and just asked if we wanted dessert I declined and just wanted the bill ( no apology and deff nothing was done about the check either) 

So we will never be going back, and sorry to say I don't see a successful business happing there

We also asked for chips & salsa...which we already knew weren't free...and the waitress felt the need to start quoting prices.  No doubt they've had a lot of complaints about having to pay for the chewy chips, especially at the high menu prices.

The skirt steak was not impressive, and had an odd spice flavor.  The mexican street corn was very good, and a nice surprise.  The chicken quesadillas were good.  The enchiladas suiza weren't that great nor were the smoked brisket enchiladas--chewy and tough.  The meat was hard to cut even with a knife.  The salsas were tasty, despite being served with chewy (not crispy) chips.

The decor and atmosphere was trendy, but the noise level was way too loud.  We had a difficult time carrying on conversation.

4012170,2013-04-11,8,jPvn-C8kNUcyGfjUtOc_oA,"If Agave had an ugly sister her name would be Dos Caminos.

I had a hard time rating between a two and three star experience. But with so many downers the three star rating seemed fair for a first time experience. 

I'll start with the good news: The mole enchiladas, the kids meal sliders and the corn bread skillet were 5 stars!  

Okay, now for the bad news: 

Having been a fan of the old pink decor that Agave had, I wasn't a fan of the brown dark interior.  The music and vibe felt more like a nightclub and the restaurant was really loud and no ""Mexican"" music was playing which tells me...not your ""typical"" Mexican food restaurant.

We waited 15-20 minutes for a table and we sat near the kitchen which loses its charm if you're not outside or in the ""kiva"" near the bar.  

Waitress seemed overwhelmed so she was more like an order taker than a friendly waitress.  No smile, no ""Welcome to DC is this your first time here?  Let me recommend... "".  Instead it was ""what can I get you to drink and are you having the guacamole?""  No I didn't order the guac.

Personally, with so many restaurants in Vegas they should be going out of their way to welcome customers and make recommendations off the menu.

Kids menu offered mini sliders, quesadillas and tacos so I thought the menu was a bit limited.  They do bring out bendos and crayons and a menu to color on so that is always a plus with me.

Food took FOREVER to come out it was at least 45 minutes! But at least it was semi-worth it.  Definately made to order meals, not a premaid frozen or slapped together mess, just fresh delicious upscale presentations.  

I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas and they were good, I don't think I would order them again though. They were very spicy served New Mexico style-flat with layers of sauce, spinach and cheese, but needed more sour cream.  

My sister ordered the mole enchiladas and wow!  Those were winners!  Her dish looked amazing with zigzag crema and nicely sliced julienne radishes.  

Kids ordered sliders and they were yummy...I know because I took one bite then I had to have another!  My other sister ordered a hamburger, which she liked and that woman is hard to please.

Menu is a bit different than your typical Mexican restaurant, lots of hamburgers to choose from...? 

Waitress did us no favors by explaining the slant on the menu or restaurant not that we would be able to hear her anyway since it was so loud.

Chips and three salsa's came out.  Nothing fabulous about the salsa just mild, medium and HOT, taste was okay but too watery.

The winner was definitely corn bread skillet!  OMG they should be adding this to the appetizers menu, or offering it as a sample or a side because this was delicious! Moist warm tasty a bit creamy with a little bit of spice and perfect to share.  It's hidden on the ""sides"" section of the menu. Order this for sure!

Overall, I wouldn't come running back. Maybe I was there on an off night?

UPDATE:  I did hear back from the restaurant so I always appreciate feedback! All very positive..so for that maybe I'll stop in for a Margarita and give Dos Caminos one more chance.",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,12,5,3,J6FJUGpZ2FQUAC0toZCiCg

Walking in .. we noticed that they hadn't done too much renovating from the old Agave restaurant. It's still open, spacious with comfy booths all around and a huge inviting bar in the middle. Love the outdoor space which would be great for cocktails and appetizers. 

We ordered the Guacamole with the Jumbo Lump Crab and Chipotle .. it was just as good if not better than I had remembered. The trio of salsas was good as well, and the accompanying chips crisp and nice and salty. 

Mom decided on the Grilled Shrimp Quesadilla which was served on an open-faced crispy tortilla. She loved it .. I mean really loved it .. and she doesn't usually go for Mexican fare. She even loved it as leftovers the next day! 

I wanted to try a little of everything and got the Dos Caminos Bocadito Trio. It came with two pieces each of the chicken taquitos, molotes potosinas (corn masa turnovers with roasted pepper rajas, spicy house made cheese,
pepita-pasilla de oaxaca salsa), and the plantain empanadas. I found the empanadas to be bland and mushy, the chicken in the taquitos dry and the potosinas just okay. Definitely not something I'd ever order again.

I will have to leave an update for this restaurant because we didn't have THE BEST experience, but it wasn't awful either,...so just the 3 stars will have to do for now. First of all, the seating on the patio is much better than it was under previous ownership. They have more tables outside and it feels more open. I've always loved that patio, but now it is a much more comfortable feel.

When our server mentioned to us that we were there for brunch so we receive a complimentary cocktail if we would like, we were all about it. We took advantage and my hubby ordered a blended margarita and I ordered a Bloody Mary. I ended up having to send the Bloody Mary back because it tasted like peppered tomato juice. They had no problem substituting it though and I replaced it with a mimosa which was delicious. 

The part that bothered us was that after we ordered our complimentary cocktail, we then found out from the server that our drinks were only complimentary if we ordered from the (very limited) brunch menu section. We were already half way through our drinks so we had to stick to that menu and there are really only a handful of options. Had we known this, we would have forgone the drinks and ordered from the lunch menu. 

We ordered the breakfast quesadilla, one without bacon for myself, and we waited about 20 minutes after we placed our order and munched on the trio of salsa's in front of us. For those who don't like spicy food - STAY AWAY FROM THE orange salsa. My husband can't handle spice and he mistakenly thought that might be a mango salsa and he was wrong. It was incredibly spicy even to me and I loooove my spicy food. We were both pleased with our meal and the portion siize of these quesadillas are enough to feed 2 people easily.

What I liked about Agave was the cool decor and ambiance, including the huge wooden doors, the patio, even the bathrooms; all these things are intact with the change in ownership.  What's also the same, to me, is that the food is just OK.  What's different is that Dos Caminos is a small chain with locations in New York, Atlantic City, and Ft. Lauderdale and the prices seem to be more expensive than Agave.

We had:
traditional guacamole
crunchy veggies for dipping
Dos Caminos Bocaditos trio

We were served complimentary chips with three different kinds of salsa:  tomatillo (watery), a red salsa (had a slight kick and tasty), and a spicier orange salsa (can't remember the ingredients, but I didn't really eat it).  
Gal Pal had the guacamole and veggies as her meal and she liked it just fine.  I had the trio, which consisted of two chicken taquitos topped with some kind of cabbage slaw, two plaintain empanadas, and two molotes potosinas (corn masa turnovers with roasted red pepper, spicy cheese, and salsa).  This trio was listed on the menu as priced at $16.50, so I was expecting six bigger pieces of food. When the platter was served, I was surprised at how small the servings were for that price.  I liked the chicken taquitos after I nudged the cabbage slaw off (didn't like the taste at all-sour) and I liked the plaintains, as well.  I did not care for the molotes and only ate one, hoping it would get better; it didn't.  It was just kind of spicy tastelessness (is that a word?)
When the bill came, my trio was only $8.25, so it must have been priced for happy hour, which is a good thing because that dish is not worth $16.50.
