1368058,2018-02-17,1,mzQLni03qPCPxkUXQ52U_Q,"Outside it looks similar to an adobe building but the moment you walk inside the restaurant, you will see there isn't a lot of space to accommodate many people. There is about 4-5 small tables inside and perhaps at least 3-4 tables arranged outdoor. The restaurant is open for breakfast. And lunch hour is usually their busiest time. They offer breakfast and lunch combo plates, and they have a selection of burritos, tortas, tacos, quesadillas, seafood, and soup. Also they make specialty drinks like Horchata, Limonada, Tamarindo, and Jamaica.

I chose the Grilled Chicken Fajitas combo plate ($8.99) which include tender chicken stir fry with green pepper, onion, tomato, and is serve with Spanish rice, refried beans, a small salad, sour cream and guacamole. The Chicken Fajitas include tortillas, you have a choice of flour or corn. I prefer corn tortilla, and I like that they serve it warm. The salsa verde is mild and it's not too spicy. I can tell the food is freshly made, the meat and vegetables are so flavorful, and everything in my combo plate taste amazing! Also I tried the Champurrado ($2.50), it's a thick Mexican Hot Chocolate, it has corn flour, cinnamon, clove, and star anise which gives out a calm and comforting flavor. The drink is serve hot and it's very satisfying.

They do have friendly and fast service. The person who place my order is Maria, and she made sure to check in with every customer. Price is reasonable and you can afford to order more. The staff is quick to make the food and it is delivered within 10-15 minutes. So far this restaurant is now my go-to spot for Real Authentic Mexican Fast Food.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,1,5,HRjyroafNHx5Ryi-j9il7A

This is a hole in the wall that started out as a Thai place that went nowhere. I recently saw some signs of live here and good reviews of the place. Tried it out. The tamales plate was really good. Well seasoned tamales. Rice and refried bean complimented the entree nicely. Second time there I had the Chile Verde plate. It was a very large portion. Very tasty sauce for dipping the soft tortillas. The salsa for the chips tasted different and very good. My friend had the carne asada. He liked it both times we were there. Reasonable prices. Less than 23 bucks for two plates plus drinks. I think we are moving from Los Lupes.,8xUzj8aCDOWrhykVcWggXA,1,1,4,OhaaQ0Uc_-Qlp7bmgWGA5A

I ordered the taco combo which comers with 3 tacos, rice and beans, but I was hangry so I ordered an extra taco and fideo soup. The tacos I tried were asada and pastor, both yummy, but I liked the pastor better. I was given two squirt bottles of sauce, one green and one red. The green was mild and paired well with the tacos. The red was tasty too, but a little spicy as reds tend to be. The food came out quickly and tasted fresh and delicious.

I took off a star for their Chili Relleno Burrito, the Beans and Rice were good but the Chile Relleno itself was under cooked and hard to chew the cheese not melty and the Sour Cream I ordered and paid extra to be added wasn't to be found with a magnifying glass...

From our visit this is what I gathered:
The Zarape is a family owned restaurant and you can see dad working the kitchen and the children working the floor. The location is a bit hidden but easy to get to  from the strip. Food is reasonably price for the size portions. 

The menudo was delish. It has a great homemade taste and I like that it has hominy in it. I do however wish they had that oil salsa you see in a lot of pozole/menudo places for that extra kick.

The green chilaquiles were the right amount of spiciness to get your Saturday morning going.

Tamarind water was perfect to wash every down.

I heard the breakfast burritos are very good! I will have to try it one day. I always get the carne asada tacos, very good! It's simple, meat, cilantro, onions & lime. 

Bad part the restaurant is kinda hidden and some homeless people in the area. Also, they close like at 3pm! I want tacos at 8pm! Ha

If you are sensitive to salt I would ask for no salt next time as the burrito just had too much for me.  But It was good.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic as well.  A solid place worth checking out.  They lose a star for the salt and not giving a handful of chips to go with the Burrito.,KWWc0mW-yPJXcTQS2uZYrg,0,0,4,KXsNKZgkKSugq2xjyMjAQA

I must say that since i've eaten their tacos & burritos I cannot see past them. Their chicken and assad's is seasoned to perfection and ever so tender!!! omg when you try their food you will be hooked! They are very generous with portions. The staff is super friendly. I cannot find one complaint about this place. If you're deciding on where to go to eat right now pick them... I guarantee you'll be back within a few days lol. $1.50 tacos & $5.99 huge burritos...what have you got to lose?,Q9JkGZuQhXCFj_resEKbjg,0,1,5,vbpHODXoe5AZdZzMWmVyQA
