Imho, I should have gone to other Japanese food places nearby and enjoy a better selection at lower prices.

You pay for the service, which is pretty good - i got served fast and well and the staff was what you expect from a luxury restaurant. But, other than that, the food is either on-par or less good than cheaper establishments.

The whole evening went this way so that by the time the food did come we were too fed up to perhaps enjoy the food as it deserved.  We were very disappointed being that this is a Mandarin Oriental Hotel.  At the end we wondered if we should order dessert (or go to the yogurt shop we saw downstairs around the corner) and decided to give this place one last chance.  BIG MISTAKE.

As it is located on the 3rd floor and guests will need to use a separate elevator next to the hotel lobby (23rd floor) plus your room key to activate the elevator, I am not sure if anyone can just make a reservation and enjoy their food. Please be sure to call ahead and I am almost certain they will make special arrangements.

So I walked in to this gorgeous and chic restaurant in the morning, and the hostess happily greeted me and asked for my last name. From that point on everyone started to address me as Ms. XXX. I am in love with this place already! I sat next to the window (great view) and ordered American breakfast with carrot juice plus coffee of course ;)  My sunny side up egg looks perfect and tastes great, the waffle is very fluffy and the pecan cream is the best I had in years! Even the juice, I can easily tell it is freshly squeezed. The plates are visually pleasing. Service is top notch and attentive. To my pleasant surprise, before I leave my server even asked me if I want another cup of coffee to go.

The service was horrible.  The lady who we had never stayed long enough to listen to us.

551134,2012-11-15,1,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"This review is about their Sunday brunch.

This is a great, and very non-traditional, brunch for Las Vegas, and Kudos to Mozen for having the guts to do.  This is a brunch that is much more focused on lighter food options, such as fresh sushi and sashimi, fruits, vegetables, and salads.  You also get a choice of a dish off their Sunday menu, which is definitely where you can find your ""heavier"" dishes.

The food set up and presentation is gorgeous, and I can't say enough about the quality of their fish.  The sushi and sashimi were both top notch, and they will prepare the sashimi for you to order, so you can just get what you like.  The selection is not large, but the quality of the fish is superb.  The salmon and the tuna both were great, and just had a great mouth feel, and were fresh enough that there was no fishiness to them.

The bread and fruit selection was wonderful too, with great pastries and a large assortment of fruit.  I truly had fun watching my friend trying to get the lychee open to get at the deliciousness that was inside.  The pastries were good too, but I've had better here in Vegas.

Their main dishes span from a steak and eggs, to Northern Indian curry, to South Korean and Japanese.  I had the Korean seafood stew, and while it was ok, I wouldn't order it again.  I expected it to be somewhat spicier as it was made with kimchee, but the portion and quality was great.  There was a ton of tofu, and it had shrimp, scallops, and calamari as well.  My friends had the curry and paneer, and both were really great.  I could've just dipped the fresh naan they made in both of them and been happy.

Their desert buffet, while limited in selection, was all delicious.  I liked how they had seasonal treats in there as well, and also they did some interesting flavor combinations.

Overall, a great brunch, and while the price might get you, it was truly delicious and well worth every penny,.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,5,1,4,4gz4ZRnF1w6NIoy4OWOmLg

I got the green tea waffles with lychee compote and passion fruit whipped cream. The portions might not look like alot to cover 4 waffles but it actually was just enough. The compote and whipped cream was much more flavorful then imagined and the waffles had that perfect crunch.

My dining companion got the bottomless mimosas and bento box with garlic Naan and curry.

If I could dream up a perfect buffet, this would be it - fresh sashimi sliced to order, a few different sushi rolls, snow crab claws prepped and ready to eat, oysters, a couple dim sum dishes, soups (I didn't have room to partake but there were 3 types of noodles and good-looking toppings), salad bar, an entree made to order, and fresh fruit/desserts. Of note, there isn't a HUGE variety compared to your run of the mill Vegas buffets but the quality is much higher.

Absolutely everything I put in my mouth was delicious. What really stood out were the entrees - steak with a homemade mustard for hubby, scallops with artichokes and other veggies for me. The chef is really great with subtle twists and spices added to the food. Fine dining within a buffet - awesome!

They had a large variety of fruit, traditional to more exotic starfruit and fresh lychees. The other desserts were presented as gorgeous little bites, so it's easy to try multiples without wasting. All were good. Another plus, you can order a coffee drink (latte, macchiato, whatever) to go with dessert. Very nice perk, in my opinion.

When we arrived at Mozen Bistro, the receptionist met, greeted us and asked if we had a reservation. Informed her that our reservation was at 1pm, although we came ahead of time, we were ushered and seated. The restaurant was almost full to capacity by then. 

The restaurant's ambiance is the unhurried, cosmopolitan setting- and set up for an intimate crowd. Had 2 live jazz artist playing in a prominent corner of the scene.

The waiters were all courteous and explained to us how the buffet concept worked with a selection of a main entree from their menu. 
Three of us ordered the Angus Beef Steak and an order of scallop, and one HongKong steamed grouper. All these dishes was superb and were appealing and tasty. Truly a gastronomic delight, aside from the side dishes from the buffet- a wide array of salads. Antipastos, sushi, a fresh selection of crab claws, jumbo shrimp cocktails, kumomoto oysters.
On the one end there's prime rib perfectly carved to your liking, a pork siomai (Dim Sum) and steamed pork bun station- these are so yummy and delicious that it got a melt in your mouth feel.
We also tried a helping of soba from their ramen or noodles station- it's so appetizing and good.

Our waitress, Kristy  always make it a point to stop by and ask how we are doing, dishes out and continuously check what we might need, she is a very friendly, hospitable and gracious server who deserves this commendation for excellent service from start to finish,

Our over all rating, is you get the worth for your money and this is the best Sunday jazz brunch that we ever experienced. Definitely worthy of recommendation to our friends and family.

You'll never get this expectation, as a local, it was beyond comparison. Phenomenal  food quality yet the best personalized service in Las Vegas, that you can seldom get from this fast paced city.

Situated to make decisions in a short time frame with a limited data plan on the go, my friend and I went out of our way to Mandarin Oriental at around 2:00pm to try this ""Four-star, Japanese, Asian Fusion, Sushi Bar"".

The mid-day light fare lunch menu was not very appealing and was quite limited to basic sandwiches, soup, and a small selection of overpriced sashimi, nigiri, and sushi rolls. $18 for a California roll with ""blue crab"", this better be pretty outstanding. Nope, this California Roll was the most poorly made sushi roll I've had to date. The ""blue crab"" tasted nothing out of the usual, it was bland and unseasoned. No hint of vinegar or seasoning in the sushi rice. Unfortunately, I just don't have anything good to say about this dish. Sorry to say I am 110% sure that the pre-made rolls from supermarkets or fast food stalls would've offered something better tasting for 1/4 of the price.

I don't doubt that their regular menu or hot dishes would have provided us a much better experience.

Firstly & most importantly to point out, they offer free coffee from 6am - 8am & when you're awake & nervous as all get out b/c of a certain *event* later that day, you're thankful you don't have to leave the hotel for a cuppa

After 8am, or if your fancy runs towards the espresso drinky variety, they have a full coffee bar that serves Illy Coffee & Illy just happens to  be my absolute FAV!

We had drip coffee on the 1st morning & it was completely drinkable; lattes on the 2nd morning & they were creamy & smooth - just like the Illy lattes I know & love.  Maybe another shot would have made it perfect but this was still 1 decent latte that I'd get again

Service in the restaurant was phenomenal - our waitperson was so incredibly nice & this made the process of waking up so much easier.  Also free papers were provided & we had our choice b/t USA Today, Wall Street Journal or NY Times

We both got omelets - mine w/ mushrooms & brie; BF got tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms & brie

Let me just say that the mushrooms were tender & nicely cut to have a good bite of mushroom in each forkfull.  The brie was a perfect accompaniment - there were huge hunks that must have been added right at the very end b/c it was just a bit melty but still in ""hunk"" form & I can never get brie to do this when I add it to eggs.....it dissolves completely & I can't tell I even added it.....so props to you!

Homefries also were flavorful - like tender roasted potatoes & the fruit cup was fresh & had lots of variety

1460922,2010-01-01,0,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"MOzen Bistro, like its hotel, is relatively new. And like everything in Las Vegas, it tends to be on the expensive side. With dim lighting and modern decor, the restaurant gives an air of excellence and romance. I'll be honest, you really just pay for the awesome eating environment. The food in my opinion doesn't exactly equal the price. But who knows? Maybe when you add in the tentative service, the aesthetics of the food, and the overall eating experience, maybe you do add up to the price on the menu. But under no circumstances should a pad thai be $28. The portion was moderately small... so you'd expect it to taste fucking amazing. However, that was NOT the case! 

Enough with the down side of MOzen, let's move onto the +'s! Mozen has excellent service. I never had to ask for a refill of water...and trust me..I DRINK A LOT OF WATER. I may feel like a water balloon after and I may pee like a horse later. BUT I DRINK A LOT OF H2O (that means water for those of you who are challenged in chemistry). Another plus was the aesthetics of the food. The food was so... PRETTY. :D My plate, the Royal Tandoori Platter consisted of grilled lamb, chicken, salmon and broccoli accompanied with naan and salsa. The salmon and broccoli were w/e. But the rich spices with the succulent meats (lamb & chicken) were amazing. It was quite savory and delicious :D. I also had the dim sum bento box (an appetizer) and i was pleased with it. It was really good dim sum. Although the shumai could be a little less dry. 

Overall, MOzen earns 3 stars because I believe it wasn't exactly worth the price given the food. It's A-OK for a casual dinner. But if you want to impress someone on a date and win big in sin city, then splurge to your hearts content here! :)",NaA5cpQC4nEWu5FrXJcIrw,1,0,3,m7-wWMOrSlg2zRonFHcZug

I booked what I thought was brunch on Easter Sunday at 9:30 to celebrate my mother in laws 79th birthday!  We fly out from the Bay Area and we were extremely excited to indulge her! I actually called the morning before to confirm and never received a call back!  We arrived and were informed that brunch did not start until 11 and then were asked if we planned to stay.  No sorry for the misunderstanding or let us see if we can get you in at 11. Nothing!  I expect a little more from a five star establishment.

We decided to stay since it was too late to get reservations anywhere else.   We were also excited to try the food.

The food:
I will say that all the food looked fabulous coming out and we were all excited to try it!  The flavor combinations around the table were too bland for my liking.
HICKORY SMOKED SALMON SCRAMBLE - 3.5 to 4 stars - this had a very good basic flavor combination.  It was a little mild but the person who ordered it prefers mild flavors.
HUEVOS RANCHERO - 3 stars - I expected deep flavor in this dish and there was none.  It sounded so good reading it off the menu but it lacked spice and was very bland.  
POACHED EGG MASON JAR - this dish had a texture issue for me.  I ordered it without ham but with bacon.  I removed the ham as I was afraid it would feel almost like rubber in a already soft dish.  I expected the bacon to be crispy and some texture but it was like rubber.  I think this dish could use more sage and the bacon to be very crispy. 

The service
Service was good however I felt like we were being rushed the entire time we were there.  I think this had a little bit to do with our waiter as he seemed very anxious and high strung.  We had expected to have a long leisurely brunch and ended up having a rushed breakfast.
The other item to note was the lack of concern by the hostess that we had booked what we thought was Easter brunch for our mothers 79 birthday!  It was a big deal to us and it was frustrating that they seemed to actually hope we would not stay.. possible so they could give our table to someone else.

Away from the busy smoking and drinking crowd of Las Vegas, this restaurant gives you the opportunity to truly enjoy their atmosphere. I felt like I wasn't in Las Vegas when I dined here. Sat at the sushi bar and was entertained by the Sushi chef. Asked him what fish do you prefer for tonight? He showed us the fresh cuts and highly recommended the tuna and yellowtail. All my husband and I could do was shake our heads because we couldn't believe how fresh the fish looked. And boy did it taste exactly how it looked. We ordered the Japanese bento an array of sashimi, sushi, miso soup, wag yu beef, and tempura. That plate alone was enough for me to throw a white flag. Nigiri was to die for, we had yellowtail, tuna and ebi. Might I add the slices on the nigiri was out of bounds. It was so large it took us a minute to chew. 

Our server Mike was amazing as well. He overheard my parents face timing and greeting me a happy birthday. He then came up after the call was done and said save some room for dessert!!! Such a nice touch to the service. 

My husband and I are completely satisfied with the service and most importantly the food!!! Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is willing to step away from the craziness Las Vegas offers on every block.

I absolutely adore this place. I wish I had more reasons to visit the Mandarin Oriental just so I can eat here more often. When my girlfriends suggested we try lunch here for Restaurant Week, I was excited. Mozen definitely lived up to all its great reviews!

For this week, our lunch was served very elegantly in these bento boxes:

Murgh Makhani
Garlic Naan
Salmon Crudo
Miso Mustard New York Angus
California Roll
Matcha Tiramisu

We also ordered ala carte off their regular menu:

Wasabi Prawns
Thai Green Curry

The Salmon Crudo was served like a tartar and it was amazing. It melted in your mouth. My girlfriends ate the steak and said it was deliciously tender. We all devoured the wasabi prawns and green curry. Those were the highlights, but everything was tasty and yummlicious!

The service is what you'd expect from a place like Mozen. Our server was very friendly and helpful, even when we took a while selecting our ala carte dishes. The staff came by regularly to refill and pour our green tea. At the end of our meal, they brought out a small complimentary dessert, Raspberry Coulis, which was very nice. 

I can't wait to try more items on their menu. If you're looking to have a great elegant lunch with amazing Asian-influenced food, plus sit in a nice cafe with a nice view, this is your place.

Walking in I thought to myself where is everything? No art? No decor? It seemed so bare. Everything is the same color and blends into each other.

Once the experience began and the service was extraordinary with multiple staff members making us feel like the most important people in the room. After a long day at work and traffic on the strip this really made us all just feel so damn good. It was also genuine and not pretentious. It felt as if they appreciated us choosing to dine with them and I have to point this out because it really made the entire experience that much more special.

So the food was perfection. Not only did it look appealing to the eye but it tasted just as good as it looked! Every little detail was thoughtful and I couldn't believe that everything I tried I wanted more of. I began with the sushi combo which was presented like art. I also had the tandoori chicken which was perfect (climax moment). And all of this was followed by a very simple mango tapioca which once again hit the spot (back to back climaxes). I don't even love mangos and I would have licked this up if it wasn't completely inappropriate! Sweet, tart, creamy and crispy little nuggets for an amazing texture experience! 

I also tasted my friends Beijing duck salad that was so simple but packed with flavor and the skirt steak which was cooked to tender perfection with some of the juiciest & sweetest tomatoes. Everything was so flavorful yet so simple with beautiful presentations. 

I was also so relaxed and just enjoying myself. My brain went back to why this place was bare. Its designed to put people at ease and you forget about the chaos in your everyday life. Simple, sleek and elegant is what this place is all about. I loved it. I need to make an effort to simplify my world and have less shit in it just like this design.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,28,26,5,O6VNxBsDAqIqCWAo1qEG-A

We wanted something near or on the Tropicana end of the strip, and were willing to pay a little more to avoid driving around or having to cab it. Kumi had good recommendations as did SushiSamba, but we wanted to avoid hundreds of dollars for small-bite plates of sushi. MOzen was difficult to find - tucked behind in the Mandarin Oriental hotel and up an elevator - and seems to cater mostly to guests. But there was a nice mix of folks dining there, from blue-jean clad hipsters (one older looking dude may well have been Dave Grohl), to dressed up party-departers. Service was the usual for the Strip, though they definitely made an extra effort to be proud of the place without being annoying. Seating, view, and sound-level were great for conversation yet not overly date-y. Yes it was pricey, but not seriously so. We each spent just shy of one-bill and left full and having sampled some drinks. The best item was a roll with scallops and shrimp, and if that was representative the rolls are the thing to focus on (at something like 14$ for a very sizable portion). The Uni was very tasty, and if I was feeling a little more adventurous and spendy I would gladly have sampled more of the sushi menu (at something like 14$ for 2-3 pieces). Nasi Goreng was great - yes, it's dollar-street food in Indonesia, but they really did a nice thing with different flavors and spices. And I'd highly recommend the sake-flights over the drinks if you're on the fence. They're a lot of fun and reasonably good value. Enjoy!",LufujYVd4fyIstGnOX1miw,0,0,4,xwa7-BYU8pdsd-KLVOlj8g

You guessed it, MB is getting 3 stars (althought i'd like to give 2.5) this time . . . not for the food quality, but for the service.

First, the food is awesome.  They introduced a new Bento option to the menu and all of the small options (from the east) were delicous.  There was such a huge variety, it was hard to select which to pick.  With the Bento option, you got to select 6 out of about 30 menu items to eat.  There was nothing i didn't thoroughly enjoy.

Second, the staff were all friendly and pleasant.  They greeted us warmly and were genuine.  The hostess was unusually helpful and allowed me to charge my cell phone at her station as my battery was running low.

Third, the service itself was poor and here was our experience.  The water glasses went empty and we had to ask to get them refilled . . . several times it took more than 10 minutes to get that accomplished (by the way, the restaurant was about 1/3 full).  One of my dining partners asked for a wine menu and 15 minutes later, he finally got one after asking twice.  One of my favorite items on my first visit was the smoked gouda mac n cheese.  I noticed it wasn't in the menu, so i asked the servers assistant if it was available off menu and she said she'd check.  When our server came to take our orders, i had inquired about the mac n cheese and she said she'd check.  Our dinners were delivered by someone else and when our server came back to check on us, i asked about this one item and she said it wasn't available . . . well, after our meals were already being consumed was not the time to tell me.  I should have had the answer before i ordered my meal, not 1/2 hour later after i had to ask the third time.  One other point that was made . . . because of the large Bento selections, one of my dinner mates was having a hard time making a decision . . . he asked the server for assistance and all she contributed was ""everything is excellent"" - well, that really ended up not helping him at all and i know he was taken a bit aback by that answer and ended up making his own decision without the guidance he was looking for.

I am sure this service experience was more of a fluke, however, i had my expectations set so high from my first visit, i ended up somewhat deflated after this visit.  Especially considering i had suggested this place to work associates that were coming in from NY City to meet with me.

We ended up talking to the MOD after our dinner and I wanted to make sure he knew my concern (i asked him to meet me in the hallway so i could be discreet).  He was pleasant and listened and gave me the card of the general manager.  The next day I received a message from Christian and for the next few days he and i just traded messages but we ended up not actually speaking so he only received my account third hand.  He can now read about my experience first hand now.

Anyway, i definitely think this place is a must visit.  I hope that the service training gets a boost.",tOLIRcDqQzWc2CEyXk2zyg,0,0,3,Q_dbJebTOc_MbiW31JqH-w

Dinner: I ordered Indian fare and it was simply the best Indian food I have ever eaten. Like another reviewer said, the flavors are bold. The Indian rice was literally melting in your mouth. Since it was my birthday, the restaurant surprised me with Dom Perignon - very classy indeed.

Breakfast: Very awesome breakfast that will fill you up and leave you happy. I ordered the Mandarin breakfast twice and still couldn't get enough! Also had fresh orange juice and Japanese green tea.

Brunch: Wow this was epic. I love the sushi, sashimii...and everything about brunch. At $58/person, it is slightly pricey but very much worth the price. I think I had over $100 worth of sushi by myself, not counting the bunch entree...it was so good.

And of course, MOzen followed in the path of the MO so service was beyond excellent! Everyone was so nice....

The dinner menu was three courses, and thanks to my fellow Yelper dining companions, Neli T and Cathey K, I was able to try all of the dishes. The lunch menu also looked pretty promising, but the dinner-exclusive dessert made this the best choice for me.

SALT AND PEPPER CALAMARI: Started with an app off the regular menu, which was lightly breaded and perfectly fried but not particularly salty or peppery. 
SUSHI COMBO: Porcelain bento-style plate featured five bites of fresh fish for this course. The seaweed salad was creatively served in a hollowed-out lime half, and the tuna with caviar was super fresh. The fried tofu, however, was a bit soggy.
THAI BEEF SALAD: Beautiful presentation! Marinated rib eye was very flavorful, dressing was light, portion was fairly large.
ROASTED BONE OUT BRANZINO: The fish was perfectly cooked but could have used a touch more seasoning. The sweet Vierge sauce didn't quite work for me but I really liked the fregola and corn pasta with walnuts, grilled haloumi, and mint, which had a lot of textural contrast.
MURGH MAKHANI: A course of four Indian dishes served in a wooden bento style box. The chicken curry was a bit sweeter than I prefer, while the lentils were a touch salty. The naan was super fresh, though.
LA FRAISE YUZU: Almost too pretty to eat! But we did, and it tasted even better than it looked. A Greek yogurt topped with a summer strawberry sauce and gelato, with yuzu foam and almond streusel. Another dish with fun textures, but this was a nice bit of sweetness without being too sweet, either. The yuzu flavors could have been more pronounced but this was wonderful as is. 

I'll be keeping MOzen in mind- the incredible dining room views and exclusive location make this a good special occasion spot. The RW lunch menu also looks like a great value, and allows diners to try several dishes bento-style to get a feel for the restaurant's quality and diversity.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,11,4,Uqb87MpG7NMSIzTllmEpzg

Damn I wish I went back the second day before I left to use up the breakfast credit, and bask in the loveliness they call Nantucket Eggs.

You know I usually skip breakfast, but I had breakfast credit at Mandarin Oriental since I booked through American Express, so I was obligated to at least try it out. I went an hour after I woke up, so around 930-10 and it was a very nice experience. Its located on the 3rd floor and as you walk towards the restaurant from the elevators, there is a pastry area that is loaded with stuff to purchase (drinks also) during breakfast and lunch hours, and next to that is the hostess.

I was promptly greeted and shown my table with a menu. Not too complicated for breakfast and it had the usual stuff, omelets, continental breakfast, eggs Benedict, steak, fruit, drinks, and bread. 

I was told before hand that Vegas water is almost undrinkable so I opted for a bottle of Fiji water, and a chefs daily smoothie which was a strawberry banana smoothie. 7 dollars for a bottle of water? HELL to the NO, but there was no way I was going to max out my 50 dollar daily credit without ordering too much food and looking fatter than I already am, so yea it was chilled water and it Fiji Water, what can you expect?

The strawberry banana smoothie was good, usually its blended older fruit, but it wasn't sour, it wasn't nasty, the texture was nice and it was pretty filling. If you haven't already figured it out, I ordered the Nantucket Eggs as the main breakfast course and it was amazing (see attached picture). The hollandaise is in its own pourable container so that it doesn't get too soggy, and the crab cakes, wow combine that with the poached eggs, sautéed spinach and the sauce, it was like breakfast heaven. Or at least for me since breakfast is usually not in my cards. They include vegetables and a thing of potatoes on the side and they were decent. BUT THEM CRABCAKES, EGGS, SAUTEED SPINACH, and SAUCE though.

The service was very good as well, always checking up to see if I need anything, and if the food was good. Maybe alittle excessive for me, I'm used to having service where I need to, and have to flag people down so you know, YMMV

I just ate lunch and now I'm hungry again thinking about them eggs, them crab cakes, and them Hollandaise sauce.

Still regret not using the second day of breakfast credit for more.

I have to admit when my Husband first suggested Mozen I thought it looked like it could be an uptight restaurant with nothing I would like.  I'm a pretty finicky eater and I'm not very adventurous when it comes to food.  We started with a couple of appetizers - Ebi & Vegetable Tempura and the Salt and Pepper Calamari.  The appetizers were excellent and cooked to perfection.  For our entree's, I ordered the Murgh Makhani.  Our waiter told me this was his favorite and one of the best selling entrees.  I was a bit skeptical but I ordered it anyway.  I am SO glad I ordered this dish!  It was amazing.  The Indian curry was so creamy and delicious!  The chicken in this dish was cooked perfectly, it was SO tender.  I will definitely order this dish again when I return to this restaurant.  My Husband ordered the North Indian Nalli Gosht Curry.  When his dish arrived we were in awe, it looked so cool.  It had a large lamb shank sticking from the bowl.  The lamb was so tender it fell off the bone, this dish was another amazing entree.  The basmati rice was cooked perfectly.  I have tried to cook Indian rice and I have had other's cook it for us and it has NEVER turned out like Mozen's.  In case your wondering what naan is, it is Indian bread.  It comes out steaming hot and it taste great .... especially when you dip it in your curry.  

The wait staff was perfect.  They were there the second your water needed to be refilled or they noticed an empty dish was on your table.  Also the maitre d, stopped by several times to make sure we liked our food and to check on us.  The service was impeccable.

Our entire meal, including 1 cocktail, 1 glass of wine and 20% tip, was $150.  Very reasonable for 5 star hotel dining!!

As guests at the Mandarin Oriental, and very much enjoying our stay, it seemed only natural to try MOzen for convenience if nothing else.  I kind of wish we hadn't bothered.

Prices are high, but we expected that.  Service was attentive and friendly, but not without errors (failing to replace utensils, kitchen took so long to prepare our food that we almost walked out).  The food was a mixed bag.  Calamari was very well seasoned but overcooked (this is what happens when you have tiny pieces of calamari)--we sent it back.  Mushroom soup, which was ordered in place of the calamari, was delicious; best part of the whole lunch, and a generous serving.  Breads were good, especially the miso roll.  French fries were outstanding, salad was fine, turkey club was very good, chicken tikka masala wrap was very unappealing...I ended up just eating the fries with the cilantro chutney; couldn't stomach the wrap itself.  I told the server not to recommend it to any other Indian customers.  Maybe it works for palates not accustomed to Indian flavors?

To the server's credit, she was pleasant throughout the meal (even though we were critical of the food) and kept our beverage glasses full.  She removed the calamari and tikka masala wrap from the bill, so we walked out for just under $50.  Maybe they do other dishes better, but I won't bother giving them a second chance.

2178516,2011-12-13,1,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"This is a review of their lunch menu.

The Skinny: food is nothing awe inspiring however the quality of the ingredients is very good (3.5) service: was okay... but I expected something better from a place in the Mandarin Oriental (3) value: appears expensive but portion sizes are commensurate with location and service unless you're talking about the sushi. (3.5)

After going to the Spa at the Mandarin Oriental with my sister, we opted to head here for lunch. (I wasn't looking forward to having my spa smell obliterated by the smell of cigarette smoke, thank you very much.)

I had seen the menus at Mozen Bistro before so I was anticipated my wallet to be raped royally. What I found surprised me.

The lunch menu had several items on it below $20 with very healthy portion sizes. Opting for my standard favourite, I opted for the Smoked Turkey Club ($16; comes with fries and salad). The hubs ordered a kobe beef burger with pretty much unlimited toppings ($28; includes fries and salad).  My sister chose the Thai Beef Salad.

We were started with a lovely basket of various rolls with three dipping sauces. Although the sauces (a tzatztki, a sundried tomato anti-pasti, an olive oil) did not appear to suit the bread that was served (baguette really needs butter), it was definitely nice to have to start the meal. 

For the sandwiches, it came with a rather large portion of fries and salad. The dressing wa a nice light dressing with just the right amount of acidity while the fries were nice and crisp. The generous serving sizes really surprised us given our location (on the Strip) and the cost of the meals.

I really enjoyed my turkey club sandwich. Although I would have preferred real fresh turkey, the amount of quality deli turkey was really good. Add to that a nice assortment of cheese (smoked gouda!), bacon and avocado, it made for a pretty nice big sandwich (I could barely finish half of it... even when I took out 60% of the bread). I do wish that the sandwich was heated to allow the cheese to melt a bit and the meat to be warm but that is personal taste.

Next, the Kobe burger. It's kind of a unlimited toppings deal so my hubby ordered it with bibb lettuce, cheddar, grilled onions, and wild mushrooms. For a fancy place, the burger was a definite two-handed affair.  He could barely get his mouth around that bad boy! It was also prepared perfectly medium rare. I asked him how it tasted. He replied, ""Not the best burger I've ever had, but given the quality and quantity - very decent on both accounts"".

My sister's Thai beef salad was also quite tasty. Loaded with a ton of ribeye (""there's half a cow in here!""), it was decently priced given the amount of protein. She also indulged in 3 warm rolls to fill in the carb gap.

By now we felt very close to Mr.Creosote (from The Meaning of LIfe), so of course the waiter comes by with three still warm lemon madelines. Not being able to pass these up, we gobbled those beautiful buttery beauties up. I literally did not need to eat until the next morning.

Overall, the service was only okay in my books. Given the caliber of this establishment, there were numerous times we had to signal our slightly vacant waiter to refill water, to get a box for our leftovers, to get our cheque.  Despite this, the staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our meal which is a plus.

Given the quality of the food and portion sizes, this place gets a 3.5 stars. I am definitely interested to try this place again although I will pass on the sushi (I checked an adjacent table's maki which appeared to have way too much rice to filling ratio... that's no good in my  books!).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,3,3,MCVJX20ddff9wRgeSt4qiQ

The sushi combo was nice to start, I wouldn't bother eating the fried tofu though, it's bland and not that good. The sushi is very fresh and exactly what I expected from this place. For the next course I had the branzino which was ok, the skin was tough and chewy, not the crispy light crunch that you envision but meat was pretty good. My friend's Branzino came with a hair that she pulled out of her fish. This happens, I get it. But the manager decided ultimately to comp both our drinks even though it had nothing to do with me. I guess that's easier to comp but my friend didn't have much of an appetite after seeing that and I don't blame her. The last tapioca/lychee dessert was refreshing and a nice finale but hard to enjoy since we couldn't stop thinking about the hair. Attentive staff, beautiful view, decent sushi.

All of that said, I am sure I wouldn't eat here if I weren't staying at the Mandarin. The hotel is out of the way. A bonus for a hotel but not necessarily for a restaurant.

day 1

dinner was just slightly below amazing.
there were a few hiccups.

amuse bouche - seasoned cashews and a small serving of spicy salmon with microgreens.
the cashews were spiced with curry and cumin and maybe some turmeric.
they were spicy and delicious.
the salmon was spicy and not in the typical ""spicy tuna"" kind of way.
also delicious.

course 1 - Green apple & cilantro jelly, sashimi of Hokkaido scallop & garlic salsa.
this was my favorite dish of the evening.
we were instructed to eat this with the spoon provided which turned out to be the only way to go.
the jelly with the scallop and crunchy garlic salsa all mixed together was a culinary delight.
it was both delicious and refreshing.

course 2 - Pan-fried halibut, flavored rice, curry leaf tempura & salted buttermilk sorbet.
unfortunately, the fish was overcooked.
but the rest of the dish was delectable...which made it worse that the fish was overcooked.
this dish could have been one of the best things i've ever eaten.
the flavored rice was the perfect mixture of spices and seasonings.
the tempura curry leaf was also a nice touch.
the salted buttermilk sorbet was a unique palate cleanser.
it was salty, sweet, tart, cool, creamy and crunchy all at the same time.
it was a party in a little tagine!

course 3 - macha green tea creme brulee with lemon sorbet.
amazing green tea flavor, perfectly bruleed top and a refreshingly tart lemon sorbet.
a perfect end to an amazing dinner.

we also ordered a few small bites to try.

salt & pepper calamari - nothing special here but the calamari was very tender and the garlic and five spice salt was a great touch.

singapore chili crab - amazing flavors; nice and spicy; a good deal at $10.

blackened albacore tuna tataki - the garlic soy reduction and chili aioli were the stars of this dish; complemented the tuna very well; unfortunately we were overcharged for this dish but didn't realize until we got home; $8 dish, charged $18 by mistake.

samosa - hellooo spicy!!! not for the faint of tongue! again with the perfect blend of spices and seasonings. for something with no meat inside, it sure had some crazy flavors going on. the mint chutney definitely helped with the spiciness.

lastly, the china.
i'm a sucker for fine china.
i feel that the vessel that the food is served on/in plays a pretty significant role in the presentation of the entire dish.
if food is art, then the dish is its canvas.
from the small white tagine by front of the house to the beautiful bone china round pasta bowl by narumi (which i can't seem to find anywhere!), all of the dishes were beautifully presented.

overall, a great dining experience.
as i mentioned, a few hiccups with the fish and the pricing and the runner was a little shy, quiet and seemed nervous so it was difficult to hear him try to describe the dishes he was bringing out.
the server was amazing.
he was attentive, charming and funny.

the food (other than the halibut) was visually stunning and skillfully prepared.
the mixture of all of the different spices from all different asian cuisines is beautifully executed.
the chefs at mozen bistro do a wonderful job showcasing all of the dynamic flavors of asia.

i should mention that they have a special bento box for $48 where you can pick 6 different items from their ""journey through asia"" tapas menu.
it's a great deal that i'm going to have to try next time.

I had the smoked salmon, cream cheese and bagel ($16) and it came with capers, tomatoes and red onions. So tasty, even requested more capers and the bus boy arrived with more. Ask and you shall receive at this place!

Our server Kristy was so sweet and attentive, she was almost too good to be true. 

Thought the $7 for OJ (fresh squeezed was $10) was a bit pricey but this is Vegas and MOzen is well worth it for us...quiet, civilized, and even a bit tranquil. Beautiful way to treat yourself, you are worth it!",wvH8Aa15PQ2lyGnw2kYCSA,2,0,4,wIV1GU6GoicAtrICHruUrQ

One of the major annoyances is the long waiting-time before the food arriving. My boyfriend and I came there around 11:00am and finished the order very quickly, as both of us were really hungry. I mean, can you imagine what a kind of terrible feeling--we had totally emply stomachs without eating anything and kept walking 40km after the dinner last night (about 6:00pm). We almost dragged ourselves to the restaurant, just to eat some hot Asian foods, but we waited nearly 50 minutes before serving. My boyfriend and I had to appease our hunger with lots of free coffee provided there (the waiter must think I am wired). In a word, the service there is super slow. Another inconvenience is the time schedule of food service. Lunch is provided only after 12:00pm, and such situation is pervasive within Las Vegas restaurants.

I became a fan of their brunch after my first visit! The dining experience was phenomenal! 5 stars for service, 5 stars for quality and variety and 4 stars for value (around $60/pp).

From the manager to the staff, the service was topnotch and exceptional! The food stations included one for seafood, dim sum/Asian cuisine, cold dishes/cuts, fruit and dessert. 

As soon as you are seated, you are asked for your beverage of choice - fresh watermelon, carrot or orange juice.  After I ordered my morning beverage, I walked over to the fruit station and topped my plate with exotic fruits such as dragon fruit (this was gone pretty fast), pineapple, and rambutan (resembles the lychee). 

Then, I made my way over to the sashimi, oysters, jumbo shrimp and crab claw station where I sampled a little bit of everything.  The yellowtail and salmon sashimi were quite good. I also enjoyed the oysters and jumbo shrimp but not so much the crab claw. 

Being Asian, I had to check out the dim sum, noodle soups and BBQ chicken & pork at the Asian cuisine station. I asked for sample size portions and they were very accommodating.

For my main entree, I had the seared scallops.  I forgot to mention to the kitchen to go light on the salt.  It was a bit salty for my taste but other than that it was well prepared and a light dish so that I was able to enjoy a few of their many delectable desserts!

You must save room for dessert because Mozen offers an array of delicious desserts. The macaroons were among the best I've tasted! It went well with the matcha green tea.

Overall, what stood out the most for me was their service.  I also enjoyed the zen and elegant decor/ambience, the crowd (spotted a few celebrities during my last two visits) quality and variety here.

MOzen serves up beautifully plated and high quality dishes at Vegas prices.  However, the flavors and freshness are so good here that the prices seem almost reasonable compared to other places charging similar prices.  I had the Caesar salad with Tandoori chicken and a couple sushi rolls, which were good but nowhere near as spectacular as the chef's tasting menu that night.  My partner in crime chose this route, and I was lucky enough to try some of the items off of said menu.  We started with incredible baked oysters, moved on to a roasted tomato soup, and dove into a tender veal osso bucco.  The dessert was indescribably rich and decadent -- and the name of it escapes me.  However, it had layers of fruit filling (like jam) in between different flavors of smooth and creamy semifreddo.

I will 100% say their small bites menu is the highlight (A journey through Asia).  My favorite was the Hokkaido scallops, and then came the Lemongrass Prawns and Yam Neua as a close second.  The scallops are served sashimi style over a cilantro pesto puree, while the lemongrass prawns are actually ground and served with a mango salsa.  Yam Neua (one of my favorite Thai dishes) is served pretty darn rare if that's your thing, and it's quite spicy, be weary.  Light and refreshing, but my lord those Bird's Eye Chilies are spicy!!

I wasn't so crazy about the Bento box.  It's an assortment of 6 different items (to name a few a Japanese pancake, assorted Nigiri, salt and pepper calamari)  Don't get me wrong, it's good, but the small bites are a better idea, just because you can pick what you want, and everything I picked was delicious and made with so much attention to detail.

Really like the small bites, wish the restaurant was a little more scenic.  Service was perfect.  Would def come back, and will definitely try the all you can eat sushi during the sunday brunch w live Jazz.  How awesome does that sound??",jX7n6KfNZ22kBh6AHhxRbA,3,1,4,dekUgc1BgP_wKhX9JpVijQ
2562804,2013-12-20,1,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"We stopped into the Mozen before a show on a very quiet Friday night. To be fair, this restaurant probably starts hopping around 7:00 and I realize that high time for dining in Vegas  isn't really 5:30, but no matter. We had the restaurant pretty much to ourselves and that was just fine with us.

The ambiance of Mozen is very nice. It's a great setting and has a partial view of the strip with floor-to-ceiling windows. Wait staff was very nice and attentive and our waiter took the time to explain the different entrees to us and make suggestions. I can't speak to whether or not the service suffers as the night wears on, but we were very well taken care of as there were only 2 other patrons to look after.

The food itself was fabulous for just about everyone but me--and very generous portions which was a surprise for such an upscale establishment in Vegas. Our friends ordered a spicy green curry and pad thai. I ordered some sushi and my partner opted for an Indian curry. Everyone loved their meals! I can attest that their food was superb. I'm typically not a fan of Indian food, but Mozen's Indian food made me a convert. Excellent flavors, rich, creamy, and too much to finish even though the food was fabulous. The reason for the 4 star review, however, was my sushi. It was just... lacking. Everything tasted fresh, but the temperature of the rice and the fish was almost warm and therefore, kind of droopy. It certainly wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. But if one ""meh"" dish is the lowlight of an otherwise fantastic meal, then I'd say you're doing pretty well.

Overall, Mozen was a great place to eat and I'd go back again. Perhaps next time, I'll stick with the Indian menu.",6Xq3MjkgWhyma7-DgWio1A,0,0,4,Zdcezz5N_dZpILyb6AEtzQ

We love the Mandarin staff so attentive, so willing to make adjustments to the menu. I tell so many friends to come here, I wish I could stop people on the street and tell them to get up there! They are higher priced but the service! The service!

Vegetable soba noodle soup $20, my husband so enjoyed this. He also asked for bread - they brought him a bread basket with four different kinds of warm bread, he dipped it into the soy sauce (the bread was free).

I had the cheese plate it does come with meat but I asked for double cheese no meat and they had no problem with that. Four kinda of cheese (doubled) we ended up taking some of it with us). For $24 I had $24 worth of cheese! Plus they have nugget, candied walnuts and a few pickles.

Illy small coffee (7) and iced tea (7) - drink a lot. That is a tad over priced.

Again, I am sad that some reviews say they had bad service, got sick, found the food to be poor quality? So surprised! Each time we come we love it!

I dim sum si sente che sono freschissimi e il gambero è assoluto padrone. Anche il pad thai si difende alla grande, spicy ma non troppo e con gamberi in quantità!

After waiting what seemed like an eternity to be served (greater than 45 minutes), I found a LONG black hair entwined in my Huevos Rancheros. It was beyond disgusting! I have no idea how they didn't see it in there. The eggs were literally stuck to and hanging off the hair when I lifted my fork. 

I was absolutely starving and was nearly about to cry at the sight of the hair. When I reported it to our waiter, he apologized and took the plate. While they were preparing a new order, I had to pick off of everyone else's plate because I was so hungry. I grudgingly ate the newly prepared huevos, and only because I was still hungry... otherwise I would have bailed on the whole situation.

This definitely isn't the first hair that I've found in food, but it's pretty disturbing when you find one at a place that charges $12 for a bowl of Cheerios. Mozen is expensive and exclusive. It should be held to a higher standard than iHop when it comes to quality control. 

Why the 1 star? 

* Hair in food. Probably enough said.
* For an insanely overpriced restaurant in an exclusive hotel, I felt that the hair warranted an apology from the restaurant manager or someone in charge. When you make a mistake of this magnitude, it deserves a sincere apology.
* They only comped my huevos rancheros on the bill. I felt that was kind of chintzy.

What could have earned a 3 star?

* An apology from management
* A more generous compensation than just simply replacing the hair-laden dish with a new one and not charging for it. I probably think the whole bill should have been comped since it was only breakfast and not like a $400 dinner bill. And I was a guest at the hotel.",o9DYSlFm9pQwiurVs8U5ig,5,2,1,OwmOjsEedyqkq-ARtxTUig

Mozen is located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.   Service is friendly and attentive.  You would think it would be all fancy shmancy but as soon as we walked in and saw some people chilling there in their t shirts in jeans, realized it was pretty casual.  But we didn't feel awkward being all dressed up.

I thought the concept of the menu was cool.  Basically you choose from a selection of Japan/Korea, Indian, Singapore/Hong Kong and Thai cuisine.  The plates are tapas style and meant for sharing so they recommend 3 to 4 per person.  

Or you may choose from two ""Bento Delight"" selections for 48 bucks, which is basically their prix fix combos.

We didn't go with the Bento and ordered the garlic and cheese naan, mustard chicken tikka, yum ma muang, char siew pork & siew yoke, sashimi and we were both pretty stuffed.  Dishes were good except the char siew pork and siew yoke, didn't care for that one.  The sashimi was excellent.

Overall, it was good but nothing wow especially for the price, 10-12 bucks per plate.  Kinda silly to pay 12 bucks for naan but at least it was good and hey it's vegas.

Bento Box was only $30 and came with a variety of ""samples"" of some of Mozen's most popular dishes. It was a great deal for $30, so beautifully presented, but the food was mediocre. I think I came in with too much of a strong expectation.

The Coconut Tapioca dessert was my favorite and I don't even like coconut!

You get a total of 6 different items in the bento box, but nothing really went well together. Kind of having a mini buffet in a lunch box? 


Off the menu my partner ordered the Flat Iron Steak and only when we got it, we realized they never asked us what temperature we wanted the steak.  So it was a bit well overcooked for our preference.


I still think it's worth trying and going to! They donate $5 from the portion of your meal to Three Squares. Plus if you never went here and always wanted to, this would be a great way to sample their dishes!

2949040,2015-06-11,5,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"I have just found the best Asian fusion brunch in Vegas! We wanted a nice brunch but didn't want to go far, Mandarin Oriental is walking distance from Aria, so MOzen it is! 

We got seated at a window seat with beautiful views of partial Aria hotel and Crystals. We chose Perrier Jouet brut flowing champagne for $35 per person over mimosa for $20 per person, figured a couple glasses of that would worth a bottle already, so why not. 

Brunch is buffet style with a choice of entree, there are quite a few good entree items on the menu. 

The buffet:
Appetizers: sushi, salads, cold soup, ceviche, fresh Fanny bay and Kumamoto oysters, king crab claws, fresh shrimps, smoked salmon, assorted cheese and grilled vegetables. 

Live station: dim sum, strip loin, noodle soup and roasted vegetables. 

Dessert station: fruits, mini cakes, cup cakes, mousses, creme brûlée, macaroons and many more. We didn't try most of them, both hubby and I are not big fan of sweets. But it was really dessert heaven for dessert lovers! 

Also many kinds of sauces such as cocktail sauce, Chinese red vinegar and XO sauce, even chimichurri sauce! 

I ordered Makhani as entree, asked for tofu instead of chicken, garlic naan was so yummy, the curry was bomb! I never like curry, especially Indian curry, but that was so good, very light with amazing flavors! Hubby had scallops with pork dumplings in tomato broth. He loved the tender and flavorful scallops as well.

The noodle station was exceptionally good! The fish broth was light with amazing flavors, many freshest ingredients to choose, I just added rice noodles and veggies, regardless how simple that noodle soup was, it was definitely the best noodle soup I have ever had! Hubby liked the chicken broth a lot too. The strip loin was so juicy and tender, perfect rare plus just the way hubby liked it, 

The brunch food was FANTASTIC with too many good things, hard to believe it's buffet food! The service was top notch, our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly, kept our champagne glasses full the entire time. This was no doubt the best brunch I have ever had in a very long time! It doesn't get any better than this, so relaxing and pleasant! I think for $64 per person, if you don't want champagne, that's a pretty good deal for what you get!

What's not to love, there's the opulent service, the great menu, and the elegant view of the Veer Towers and Crystals through the floor to ceiling windows.

During our last few visits, our family ordered:
-Wellness
-Wonton Noodle Soup
-Bento Box
-Egg Benedict with Lump Crab
-Over-easy Fried Egg Southwestern Quinoa Salad

Their Wonton Noodle Soup is better here than it is at any other of the Mandarin Oriental properties I've stayed at...lots of vegetables with a beautiful presentation.  I also loved the Egg Benedic with Lump Crab as well...you can almost taste the ocean with this dish.

Ken has been our server several of the times we dined here. He is very engaging with his intelligent and warm conversation. Like any other fine restaurant, they take their time to engage with you through service and the quality of the meal. 

The only thing I don't care too much for is their Sushi bar. You are in a city of amazing meals, especially Sushi...compared to what you have to pay, the variety of fish is a little underwhelming. So I pass on the Sushi, and just stick to their vibrant offerings from the menu. But still, I love coming here for all that they do so well...plus it doesn't hurt to look out at the beautiful architecture of city center.

Beautifully Elegant!
It begins at 12 noon and goes to 4pm... at least that's when we left. 
Pretty much because we were too busy gabbing and drinking.
Oh!  I forgot to mention... the bottomless mimosas and champagne.  (Yes, there's a fee for them, but it's a reasonable fee for all the champs we consumed in 4 hours!)

The Ambiance and Service - 
Quiet, Understated Elegance
You are not rushed; You are pampered.

The Food - 
Not your typical brunch; Not your typical buffet either.
There's a few stations: sushi, sashimi (just ask), oysters, crab, shrimp; meat carving station; meats and cheese; variety of salads; dim sum; custom-to-order noodle soup; desserts galore.

And then there's your entrée that you order from a menu of about 8 options.  

I've been to this brunch twice... ordered the Grouper once and the Scallops once.  Both were Fantastic!  The Grouper melted in your mouth. It was light and succulent. The Scallops were perfectly grilled, moist, tender and meaty.  Both were lovely choices that I'd order again.

My mother ordered the Waffles once and the Chicken Makhani once.  The Chicken Makhani hands down is decadent and rich.  It's definitely filling.  She took most of it home.  Now, this is not to say the Waffles are not good. They are VERY good... but the Chicken Makhani was amazing.  


Note: This is the kind of place you go to for a leisurely brunch where you want to wine and dine for a bit.  I believe for the bottomless champs and brunch it was $93pp plus tax and tip. While this is pricey, remember where you are and that the quality of the food and champagne is top notch.  I highly recommend going with folks who enjoy dining and enjoy really good food and wonderful service.  It will be lost on those looking for the run of the mill buffet.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,1,5,P2IOp-5BK8fyz4LEKwGpVw

- Laksha lemak
- Gosht Curry
- Murgh Makhani
- yogurt parfait (breakfast)

Located on the 3rd floor of the mandarin oriental, also has a little breakfast/coffee section in the morning that offers pastries and drinks to go.

I got dinner here with some coworkers around 9pm wed night, was close to closing time and there was only one other couple there. 

I loved laksa in singapore and I love coconut milk so the Laksha Lemak was an easy choice for me. It might not look huge but it is definitely a sizable portion filled with noodles, chicken, and big prawns, I had sizable leftovers and was super full. I also got to try some of my coworkers Gosht Curry (lamb) and Murgh makhani (chicken). The chicken was good but the lamb was better. The two curry plates were around 30-35 while the laksha was a little less than 30.

I also got to try the yogurt parfait, a great choice if you want a tasty light, healthy breakfast.

A little pricey for me but typical if not cheaper than usual hotel restaurants. You're paying for a more upscale environment and you'll definitely get some great food here.",416uX1dOkO0kj8tkCfhnCw,1,0,4,Ksv1CKP_gDfITWEg4MEq8A
3074897,2014-01-03,2,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"I had such high hopes after reading all the reviews. This review is for their weekend brunch

For the price, 69 dollars on New Years Day, I would have rather forked out 20 dollars ~ more for Sterling or 30-35 less and go to the Wynn or Bellagio.

There really wasn't any breakfast options. No omelettes, simple eggs, bacon and I expect some from a brunch concept. I get it's an Asian inspired but even Jasmine has much more offerings.  

They had a waffle option from the entree but since each guest selects a premium entree along with the buffet, we went with the scallops and Hong Kong style steamed grouper.  The grouper was a filet and lacked flavor.  If you're used to traditional steam fish you'll be disappointed. The scallops were average- delicate but under seasoned. 

The best entrees of the brunch was the sashimi.  They had three varieties with salmon, yellowtail, and tuna.  They slice it to order which is nice and the quality is good but given this is Mozen and not your everyday Vegas ayce sushi joint, how bout some mirugai, salmon belly, conch, or something other than abc sushi? I'm not asking for o toro here.  Other than the 3 sashimi items, there was unagi worse than makinos and some abc spicy tuna rolls. 

The desserts were the best part of the brunch hands down but I can't imagine they made them all. If they do all praise.

I was disappointed overall with their brunch buffet. It wasn't in line with what was presented online - much more paired down with very little breakfast options other than some continental croissants and muffins.

The noodle soup station was alright and the carved ham, roast beef and chicken was no better than a 25 dollar brunch buffet u can get elsewhere.  Service was decent at best- our waiter was nice but extremely busy and didn't have much help. I'm not a snob but for what we paid we expect either better food or service to compensate.

For 69 dollars you can do much much better.  All the other reviews are good so maybe I'll come back for their bento dinner deal but I won't be back for brunch.

3 stars since I ate prob 60 dollars of sashimi and great desserts- the rest sucked.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,4,2,3,uZKjJ_bBJMGEqCH7k5bn0w

We started with the Salad Caprese and for our main courses Georges ordered the 72 Hour Kobe Short Rib and I had the Halibut.  Both dishes were very tasty.  I cannot say that the food was THE best, however, it was very good.  Things seemed to happen so fast as I was on a company dinner that, unfortunately, I did not take the time to savor the dishes.  If we go back again, I would probably check out the Indian offerings they had - I believe we missed out on the lamb... the trio of desserts was an okay touch - the crème brulee was okay - not the best (I am sorry to say that because I wanted it to be fantastic).

To finish our night... as suggested by the elevator gentleman, we headed on up to the 23rd floor to check out the amazing views the lounge area offered.  I advise you do the same - up there I believe is also the check in area for the hotel.

First thing when I was seated in the booth, I immediately noticed a cluster of white hairs and old dried skin flakes right next to me. I wanted to vomit. Grandma had not only left behind the free newspaper they offer, but she also left behind her DNA. The server was apologetic and cleaned it up, then offered me a black napkin in exchange for the white one on the table (bonus point, I had a black dress on). 

This is a non-traditional style brunch. Going over the menu selection, you can either choose between doing just the AYCE serve yourself brunch for $45, or you can do the AYCE, in addition to entrees (Hong Kong Style Grouper, Belgium Waffle with caramel pecan cream, some of the offerings) for $58. They have a ramen station, along with what they were calling dim sum, there were only two available, pork bun and shrimp shiu mai. A salad station with different offerings like, caprese, waldorf, mediterranean, pasta, etc. A small charcuterie and cheese board (my cheese was hard at the ends) as well as crab claws and what they were calling Kumamoto oysters (I don't think they were Kumamoto) and chilled shrimp, as well as some sushi rolls that were about grocery store quality. My favorite station happened to be the fruits. They had lambootan, dragonfruit and my favorite, passion fruit. Dessert station had mostly parfait type offerings, with some cake pops and one truffle and different creme puffs. 

In addition, they offer ""free flowing"" Veuve Clicquot for another $35 or mimosas for $19 (this is in addition to the cost of brunch).

3994025,2013-06-10,0,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"This review is of the Sunday brunch they offer, I believe beginning at 11 or noon (there have been a few times we have shown up early and found out they are still only serving breakfast). I have been quite a few times, most recently yesterday (6/9/13). The concept is basically an all-you-can eat buffet area, then you order one entree at your table, and then visit a dessert buffet.

I think it's one of the best and most interesting brunches in town because of the variety of foods they offer. There is a sushi bar with fresh sashimi and several prepared sushi rolls. I will say that the quality of sashimi can vary - some weekends they only have yellowtail and tuna, other weekends they have a larger variety and the sushi chef makes a fantastic spicy tako (octopus) that you should definitely request!

There is also a large raw bar with all-you-can-eat oysters, some cured meats, a great cheese selection (and they recently added candied pecans with the cheese, which is awesome), some salads that differ every weekend but always include fresh mozzarella, and a somewhat recent addition - a soup and dim sum bar. Not a huge selection, but what they have is great!! Then the fruit area has every kind of fresh fruit imaginable.

After the buffet, you order one entree to your table. I used to always order the chicken makhani or paneer makhani since I love Indian food. They do a great job with it! Their nan is fresh and very fluffy, and it always comes with a really yummy and interesting bean sauce on the side. I found that I got too full on all of the other items to eat a full Indian entree afterward, so I recently switched to the Belgian waffle once they added it to the menu. It comes with a REALLY good pecan cream. I've also tried the steak (really good), a ravioli dish that they have since removed (one of the tastiest things they offered), and some of the fish dishes (we were never impressed by those).

Dessert bar is good with a huge selection, but I'm always too full to enjoy it much! It changes constantly. Service is fantastic, they are SO attentive that on our first few visits we actually found it to be a bit too much - but it is wonderful because if you go a lot, they remember you and bring out your drinks without having to ask, the sushi chef prepared the things he knows we like, etc. I love it when they make such an effort to get to know the customers.

Great food, great ambiance, and great service (thanks to our amazing server and his server assistants)!  

Started off with a spider roll to share. Not bad. Not out of this world but it was good. 

I went with the Korean Bulgogi that came with jasmine rice and kimchi. Thought it tasted pretty great. Better than your average Bulgogi, nice consistency. 

My dad went with the Angus Burger which we both assumed wasn't a popular selection at an Asian restaurant. But to our surprise, it was so tasty (probably even better than my order). It came with a side salad and a side of fries so you didn't have to debate whether to take the healthy or the unhealthy route. The meat was well-prepared and the overall presentation was great!

It's a tad pricey (it is the Mandarin Oriental, so...). The sides are unmemorable and overpriced (basic mashed potatoes $10; small bowl of spinach $10; a side bowl of rice $9!!!).

For the price and the quality of food, I think it's just average.  We had reservations and was in a group of 5 (friends/family from out of town wanted to try Mozen Bistro), we were seated rather promptly.  They were not super busy and there was a few empty tables by us, so I must admit I was a bit annoyed because they kept running out of food and told us to come back in 10 mins a few times.  The service was only okay, we have to ask for water/coffee refills a couple of times. My husband was impressed by their Sashimi but that was one of the items that they kept saying to ""come back"" for.

GREAT food
GREAT service
Beautiful room w/ nice welcoming vibe 

It gets frustrating for locals like myself to eat 'splurgy' meals at some of the higher-end places at the Strip, and then ending up w/ mediocre service and over-priced food because the staff/restaurant thinks you're a tourist and you won't be back.

Well, I am thrilled to report that Mozen is definitely NOT that type of Strip restaurant! :D

Service was super friendly and attentive, the room is fancy and beautiful (but not  stuffy pretentious) and the Bento Box lunch special was chock full (too much food, actually) of absolutely delicious selections.  The indian-spiced chicken (tikka type flavor) was especially outstanding. 

As a bonus, it sure is nice to be able to get to a nice Strip restaurant without having to navigate a smokey casino floor and dodging obnoxious tipsy tourists fixated on having their ""what happens in Vegas..."" experience!",z2FfBClLQHtlC9708E6lwQ,0,0,5,TEoE_zFBV0AKDyG2WmY95Q

First time I tried Breakfast Bento and Steak & Eggs. Tragic.  Even neighborhood diner did it better.  The Bento itself was horrible displayed.  They did not even place the rice to be presentable for the price that they charge.  Salmon was undercooked and those so called ""Hand-selected fruits"" were hard as rock and tasteless. Onsen egg was broken at the time of serving too.

Steak was dry and tasteless.  I was rather surprised they could not even get the simple scramble egg right. I had better breakfast eggs on airplane than here.

During my other visit, I tried Mandarin Breakfast which consists of egg white omelet, same tasteless fruits and the best part to my breakfast was their butter!

Asked for juice refill.  ""Sorry we ran out (at 1030am?).  Forgot my tea order and the table was dirty (hair attached on the table, guess they didn't mop it well?) (See Picture).

We really wanted to experience Twist, but unfortunately they were not open for lunch, so we stumbled upon this place. I'm not really fond of the setting of the restaurant too much; I mean the arrangement of chairs and tables in the back room. it just looks so empty and odd.

Anyway, our waitress was decent. Service was good, but not excellent. The food, on the other hand, was so disappointing! We were starving, and our food didn't come out until an hour later! After everyone got their entrees, I was the one who didn't receive my sushi roll dish after an hr 30 mins later. I think the waitress completely forgotten about my order, because she asked, ""everyone is good right?"" Ummm. i didn't get my food. I was upset, since she mentioned that sushi usually comes out first, since it's quick to prepare, and most of my friends received their sushi dish way before everyone else. The waitress claims to say that the Asian food is authentic and Asian chefs are preparing it. I think that's BULL!!!! It doesn't taste authentic at all... but then again, it's Asian-fusion. 

My friends who had ordered the Kobe Hamburger said it was delicious. I took a bite, and it tasted ok. The Kobe Hamburger would probably be the best thing out of the menu. The sushi, I'll admit, is very fresh, but it was very much lacking in flavor! My friends just had a sip of the Tom Young Goong soup, and that was it. The Hot and Sour Soup was too spicy, and it didn't even taste authentic at all. The fried rice is nothing special, so it's not even worth the price.

They constantly directed all their comments and questions to my husband (he is white) and called him by name, but never even looked at me the entire time, let alone spoke to me or called me by name.

Food was not terrible but for the price I was expecting better. The Thai short rib broth was the best thing: the broth was good, and they give you a fork for scooping out the marrow like a mini osso bucco (however I really think this needs to be a spoon; the jelly-like marrow just slides through the tines). The sushi ""tacos"" were made with yuzu jelly wraps which were very interesting - I was expecting radish wraps or crispy wonton skins fried into taco shell shapes or something. However, the fish inside was fishy, which is a no-no for raw fish. The other sushi rolls and dumplings were nothing special. The oxtail soup was terrible - the broth tasted like ramen spice packets; the oxtail was a'ight, but not fall-off-the-bone tender. The ""kobe"" beef carpaccio was chewy and thick - obviously not real kobe or even Australian kobe, and I have my doubts it was even American kobe. My spoon had a sharp bit I nicked my tongue on.

Service was also okay but I was expecting better. They trick you into paying for $9 Fiji water (that you can get for under $3 at the CVS next door) when you ask for ""just"" water - and they don't tell you their default water is bottled.

They ask for your name and room number before they seat you, but then you still have to fill it out on the check.

If you are staying there they don't give you the option of paying separately - it goes on your tab by default.

Normally I tip 25-33% for average service, so when we decided to tip less than 20% I felt guilty for days. And I'm sure they're trained to say things in that deliberately misleading way and they weren't singling us out to try and trick us. But they didn't even give us a chance to refuse the bottled water - they had already popped the seal before they even made it to the table.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,0,0,2,CKiAJCYEbZZG3VpxgAC8wA

I must say, the experience wasn't what I hoped for. The Mandarin Oriental is such an elegant & high-end chain that I expected much more from their restaurant.  MOzen isn't fancy, which is totally fine, but their prices didn't justify the fare.  

The menu is all over the place.  Some would call it diverse but I call it awkward.  They have Sushi so there's your Japanese option, then Indian dishes for another Asian feature, then randomly you see a Caprese salad and Osso Bucco. Didn't know Italian food was somehow related to Asian fusion.  I had Osso Bucco at a fine establishment the previous night so I wasn't tempted to order it again but I found it interesting to see on the menu. 

Stumped & dissatisfied w/their selections, my fiancé & I decided to order sushi and small plates to share rather than an entree.

--------------------------

Spicy Tuna Roll = 3 stars
* average spicy tuna roll. Menu states that it's blended with spicy chili aioli but I couldn't taste it.

Tempura Shrimp Roll = 3.5 stars
* surprisingly better than I expected. It was crunchy but not overdone w/batter.

72 Hour Kobe Short Rib = 2.5 stars
* loved the edamame puree but the short rib was way too fatty. I know fat gives it flavor but I don't want 50% fat on such a small serving of short rib.

Calamari = 3.5 stars
* served with 2 dipping sauces - marinara and saffron-dijon aioli. Better than average but nothing to rave about.  Could've used some seasoning.

Blackened Albacore Tuna Tataki = 4.5 stars
* my favorite selection in the entire evening.  Fresh & flavorful Albacore Tuna and nice presentation. Sauces complimented the tuna well.

Lychee Smash = 3 stars
* delicious mojito-style cocktail but it didn't really do it for me.  I think it was $19 and for that price, I expected some kick.

Lychee Martini = 3 stars
* for my 2nd drink I decided not to refill the Lychee Smash and ordered a typical Lychee Martini.  It wasn't on the menu and our waiter said he'd have to check if they can make it. Really? Anyway, apparently they can make it but it was so frothy. Never had a frothy version of this martini before. It was ok and same price as the 1st drink. I should've just ordered wine.

--------------------------

Our bill came out to ~$550 for a group of 4.  This is a bit much for an unsatisfactory experience.

Dim lighting, amazing views of City Center, and culinary displays of food may be the only justification for their prices. In that regard, MOzen deserves 5 stars.  I read some good reviews on their breakfast so that may be the only time I dine here again.  Pass on dinner.  It's mediocre and overpriced.",fMBA_z1hwURKp9uArgSmKA,11,5,3,gJp-t7_f22r8dojzRwbFBw

4571733,2012-01-27,2,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"My 300th review is about my journey through Asia.  Eric R. and I have a great new Vegas tradition where any time any of our uncles visit us, they take us to dinner!!  I had the great fortune of picking the place this time, and off we went to Mandarin Oriental.

The whole reason I came was for the bento dinner, but we all saw so many things we wanted to try that we just ordered many dishes a la carte.  I had the cucumber cilantro magarita, which was very refreshing.

First, we ordered a little sushi (Cali roll with REAL crab, spicy yellowtail roll, salmon nigiri, and toro nigiri).  Toro was super oozily fatty delicious, and the salmon was very fresh.  I loved the flavor of the yellowtail even in the roll, and this was the first California roll I actually liked.

Then, we sampled beef carpaccio with mushroom, Thai beef salad, chicken rice paper wraps, and chicken lettuce cups.  A lot of these items were a bit spicy for Eric R.'s taste but I liked them!  Eric R. also got the peking duck bao from the Chinese new year menu, and only gave me a tiny bite but it was deeeelicious!  I love scallions mmm!

Next round included Thai fish cake (looked scary but tasted good), bulgogi with rice/kimchi/butter lettuce cups (substantial portion!), wasabi prawn, and Singapore chili soft shell crab.

Third round: Indian lamb kebob, naan, tandoori chicken, and dosa - served with various chutneys - tomato, coriander.

Interestingly, the Indian food which was praised in expert reviews did not excite any of us too much.  We we already pretty full when it came out too :)  The lamb was sweet and had a strong taste of cardamom, the chicken not too flavorful, the naan was blah.  The dosa was pretty good.

Lastly, Eric R. and I split mango, strawberry and mascarpone gelatos (the fruit ones were amazing) and his uncle had the lychee mousse with passionfruit sorbet.  They gave me all of the chocolate ribbons (yay)!

It was a fun journey through Asia with great service and everyone had an open mind.  My favorites were the sushi (quality outstanding), the duck I barely sampled, the bulgogi, and the wasabi prawn.  The spicy peanut fish sauce with the rice paper wraps was really yummy.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,6,4,4,SU-2y_UboI9wi2emetRbpA

We ordered right away - a spinach tofu curry, bulgogi and tuna roll. After nearly thirty mins and complaining, we got the sushi roll and at that point waiter gave me a bull shit excuse on how because my dish is vegan, it would take longer and how the tofu is frozen and all kinds of excuses. About ten mins later we got our food and it looked like it was rushed and the waiter forgot to put in my order. The spinach curry was watery with purée of spinach and lacked flavor. Tasted like water with spinach and tofu was steamed and jasmine rice was still undercooked and raw. 

When I informed the waiter that I wasn't happy with the dish, he took my plate and screams in the middle of the restaurant to the chef - ""hey chef, she hated the dish.""  Juan, the waiter was just incompetent and rude and I'm so surprised by the service received especially being inside of such an amazing hotel and a hotel that also houses twist run by a Michelin star chef.

We came Friday around 130PM for lunch.  Got seated no problem, great.  Staff were very courteous and that was in line with a 5 star hotel.

The wait was terrible.  They were not understaffed as there were always servers available, but our server came around about once every fifteen minutes.  From the time we sat down to our first bite took about 30 minutes.

The food was average and overpriced for what we received.  It tasted fine but not much better than our usual nice restaurants, but at 50% the price premium.  The juice my wife ordered was the deal breaker.  9 dollars for a glass of watered down orange juice, and it was super sour (you'd think a 5 star hotel's restaurant would pick out nicer oranges.)

All in all, maybe the Sunday brunch would have been better.  But I would not visit again based on the service and value at this restaurant.",sqqFuBMd9tWiKICuuVmzNg,0,0,2,e0E3nxll8tgmc7c7qE4jng

Service was attentive but nonobtrusive. We started off with the bento box asn appetizer. It was very fun to eat! It had bbq pork buns, pork shu mai, samosas, some shrimp mayo salad, oyster and tofu. I love tofu but that tofu was boring and they should have added 2 oysters. Next up were our main entrees. We shared the 72 hour kobe short rib and murgh mukhani (chicken in creamy curry). We were told the Indian food is the best there and for us, it really was! The curry came with naan, lentil soup and 2 small items I don't remember.

I came here on a Sunday at around noon, just in time for their Sunday Brunch.  I broke my brunch into 5 courses:

1.  Fruits and breakfast pastries.  Fruits were fresh with a great variety.  I found the pastries ok, but not up to my expectations given the price.

2. Salad + cheese plate.  Roasted veggies and greens were good.  I had 3 different cheeses.  All were very good, almost excellent.

3. Sushi.  They offered fresh sashimi, but as a vegetarian, I stuck to veggie rolls.  I eat sushi often and relative to the bay area - maybe a 5/10.

4. The entree.  As part of the brunch you choose an entree.  I had an Indian curry dish with homemade paneer (Indian cottage cheese).  It was excellent.  Well balanced spices and minimal use of butter, cream, or other 'cheats'

5. Desserts.  They had a full cart of desserts, most the equivalent of a 'dessert shooter.'  While this concept reminds me a little of PF Changs, theirs had gold shavings  and a skilled pastry chef behind them.  I sampled 6 different ones and loved 4 of them.  

This is a little tough for me.  It was extremely expensive - $70+ per person (after tip).  I didn't feel like I got my money's worth, but it was enjoyable.

4642832,2013-06-10,0,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"We tried Sunday brunch here, which is pretty pricey so come hungry. You order your main entree first, which are dishes based on various cuisines all over the world, then head to the buffet tables. There's an assortment of fancy salads and grilled vegetables, but also oysters, crab legs, and sushi. I liked the ceviche and the unagi in particular. They also have a section where a chef will make you a bowl of Asian noodles (think egg noodle, clear broth, Chinese chashu pork), and some other Asian dimsum dishes (think steamed buns). I thought the noodles were a little bland. 

So one issue with this format of AYCE is that it is hard for both the server and the diner to transition to the main entree. The server has to wait for the diner to stop eating, and the diner wants to keep eating the oysters and crab legs! Because of this, I was pretty much 80% full by the time the main entrees came. I had an Indian curry, naan, lentils, and rice that was great, and the BF had a skirt steak with garlic and mushrooms. The letdown was that both dishes were plates I could get from any Indian and American restaurant. In fact, I've had better curry and steak elsewhere. To me, this is a fallback of trying to emulate various cuisines worldwide; there's always someone else out there who's done it better.

For dessert, there was an assortment of amazing, decadent desserts. Think truffles, macarons, panna cottas, etc. There is also a variety of fresh fruits. I would have liked to see some ice cream as well. The coffee was nothing too special.

It was a good experience but I didn't walk away impressed. I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't come back.",oEvsA_IvL0yRyI7d4lT-IA,1,0,3,ridsRxwKvr_pDe4l38dKWQ

We came to Vegas for the weekend from California to celebrate him. I called back to change the reservation to 18 and the girl told me they would have to break us up since they could only accommodate up to 12 which she didn't mention the first time I called with a reservation for 14... A couple of hours before our reservation the restaurant called me asking me if they could take our order. Keep in mind none of us had been there before so we had no idea what we would order even if we were going to tell her what we wanted. She thought that if we were going to be ordering sushi they could have it ready for us, which makes complete sense to me now!  
So now we are at the restaurant and it goes down hill from there. There were only about 4-5 customers in the whole restaurant. We placed our orders.  Some of us that ordered received our appetizers while others did not. The service was beyond slow at this point! Now we are all starving and food finally comes. The food was not even worth the wait! We had some oysters ordered and we could see them sitting on the counter not on ice for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile we are the only ones in the whole place with the exception of one couple which our waitress spent all her time with. We've been there an hour and a half now and we were all waiting on sushi rolls and some are waiting on appetizers still! The manager once we called him over offered us other food options but in fear of how long that would take we quickly passed and even sent a few plates back.

MOzen, as in you need MORE zen in your life? (My friend's joke, not mine lol) Pretty sure MO stands for Mandarin Oriental, the hotel in which this restaurant is located. Both the hotel and restaurant is very elegant, but very quiet. There were only a few other people around, but it's definitely a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of Vegas.

Glancing over the menu, everything seemed really pricey. We thought maybe the portions were large enough to share family style? Nope, turns out they're individual portions. It's definitely Asian Fusion, with a mix of Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Indian cuisines. 

Glancing over the menu, nothing sounded exciting to me until I reached the last page with the bento boxes. $48 for the Bento Delight. Pretty steep, but yolo, we're on vacation in Vegas. Go big or go home, right?

My other friends got the Bento Expressions ($52), duck curry, and special vegetable curry. Our meals started with 4 mini French baguettes (??). How unusual for an Asian restaurant! It came with olive oil and tomato pesto. The dipping sauce was heavenly! Can I just get a jar of this to-go?

My bento came with 6 different offerings: Tom Yum Soup, Thai Green Prawn Curry, Chicken Tikki, Korean Beef Kalbi with rice, Char Siu Baos (2 pieces), and Nigiri (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail). I thought it would be a better deal to try a little of everything. Presentation was super cute.

The prawns in the green curry were my favorite; came with 6 large pieces! The curry itself would have been better with rice. There was hardly any rice served with my beef kalbi. Both the beef and chicken tikki were reallyyy dry. The char siu bao was probably one of the worst I ever had. Also dry, too much bread and too little filling. The nigiri was plain. The quality of the fish was average. I've seen better quality at AYCE places! The soup is good, but not enough to justify paying $48 for everything.

My friends' dishes looked more appetizing, so maybe I'll come back to try those.",9IX2jJzDNvODLA9EzSKV5A,2,0,4,B-LD-y-NlHaL6jvAjmdiLg

We had our Easter brunch here. Sure, it is pricey, but if you have the stomach capacity to go with it you might be very satisfied.

The buffet items are good. There is a lot of variety, ranging from sushi and salad to freshly cooked soup noodles and sliced beef. I especially appreciated the noodles because it's not often to find those in an American bistro (Mandarin Oriental would have been a good bet tho!), but it is not really price efficient, I suppose. There was also a dazzling array of Easter desserts, and it'd be impossible to leave hungry after trying everything at the buffet.

We also had to choose a main dish, which is a bit ridiculous because that is a lot of extra food. I picked the steamed fish dish, hoping that it will be lighter than the other offerings, but it was disappointing -- the fish was steamed for too long and the texture became rubbery. If anything, Mandarin Oriental should have done this dish right -- it's a Cantonese staple and showcases the chef's skillz. The mister's waffle was a better choice - it came with green tea whipped cream and passionfruit preserves, and tasted fantastic. 

Overall there are some 4-star moments, and some 3-star. I really wanted to like this place, but the price-to-quality ratio is not quite there. I will likely visit again for their dinner menu just to try it out.",x0i6NgHySrXWgb17gVMTuQ,0,0,3,TURgJeI7uEaDFxrLJu8iow

The service was fast and consistent. Several waiters and bussers were constantly asking me and me if I needed assistance. I was offered a delicious complimentary spicy salmon sashimi dish. My Thai Green Curry with Prawns was the best I've had outside of Southeast Asia. The best part of the meal was the spicy fish sauce that was offered on the side. It was very spicy and salty (the way I like it) and complemented the jasmine rice and curry sauce perfectly. I dined with my girlfriend for just under $100 with drinks and an appetizer.

The green curry with shrimp was one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted.  After we finished the shrimp I was eating the sauce like a soup.  Sooo good.

Yes it is a bit pricier than the other brunch places on the strip, but the overall experience is much more glamorous. 
I believe the price was $46 for the brunch, and $58 if you got an entree too, but you don't have to and none of us did and were plenty stuffed. 

First off the ambience is serene with hints of elegance. A live musician plays orchestral music. It's not as large or crowded as the bigger buffets so you don't deal with mobs around you. 

At first glance the food counters seemed small and pale in comparison to the larger buffets, but the variety is actually quite substantial and everything is clearly of higher quality and more delicately plated. 
The salads were unique and had great flavor combinations. I loved the mango shrimp salad, and the caprese salad was also very good. 
The seafood here is so fresh and faaar superior to those at the larger buffets. We ate plates and plates of the lobster, crab, and shrimp. 
The sushi was alright, but definitely also ask the chef to prepare you some fresh sashimi! The sashimi cuts were amazing.

Their dessert station was enticing and beckoning me the entire meal. I had like 6 of them and loved the coffee creme brulee. 

The only complaint I have is that drink situation was confusing. Not all drinks are included. For example, OJ is included, but fresh OJ is extra. Employees had different answers to if the coffee was included.",gRtIqKlpP_YNp45x-MmeQQ,2,0,4,nUoo34DTDQcgkS4AP1_MgA

The ambiance was good, and service was excellent, but that's what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. Now, onto the food!

I had the Japanese Breakfast Bento box ($36) the morning I arrived at the MO and it was good, albeit pricey for what was offered. The grilled salmon and shrimp dishes were delicious, as were the mushroom and tofu dish. But be warned! If you hate sour food, don't eat the pickled plum! I made such a face from having it that made the server walk over and ask if there was anything wrong.

Every Sunday, they offer a brunch buffet at $58 per person. Again, if not for the price, it would be 4.5-5 stars. You'll be offered a menu to order your ""main"" brunch entree--I had an Indian curry and my girlfriend had the salmon omelette. The curry was delicious and tasted authentic, and the salmon omelette was delicious as well. You have multiple options for the buffet: a fresh made noodle soup bar, a couple of dim sum dishes, a sushi/sashimi station, and a raw seafood bar with oysters, shrimp, and crab claws, an d of course the dessert station. There are also salads, cured meats and cheeses, and fresh fruits if that's more your thing. The sushi was fresh and delicious (they had salmon, tuna, and yellowtail during my visit), and I had a delicious soba noodle soup at the soup station. The dessert station doesn't disappoint, and the seafood tasted fresh as well. The best part? Your server will bring you freshly made Mochi ice cream at the end of your meal!

Note:  This updated review is based on multiple visit for dinner service only.

The menu is broken into two parts, a build your own bento box (select from regional Asian dishes) or larger portions of mains split between south east Asian dishes or classic western dishes.  The bento ($48 for six selections) is the best way to enjoy and sample Mozen.  Simply put, it's an exaggerated, fun, foodie tour of Asia.

Flavors are very bold and over the top.  Do not expect subtle flavors, hints of this, a wafting aroma of that.  Surprisingly, it all works especially when combining so many strong classic cuisines of Asia.  Some standouts:  

Hae-Mul Pa-Jeon (Korean pancake filled with shrimp and lump crab); what's not to love.

Beef Carpaccio with a mixed mushroom ""chutney"" drizzled with a soy ginger vinaigrette; sweet beefy goodness explodes against the earthy foil.

Steamed grouper topped with cilantro and scallions; moist and delicious.

Singapore Chili crab made with a soft shell crab; sweet and spicy.

Galouti Kebab (smoked, minced lamb with classic Indian spices and a mint chutney); deep earthy richness with a bright herbaceous finish.

Very well chosen wine list.  Vegas resort prices.

Lots of goodies inside...let's go!

Started with the Naan with Truffle Butter. You could definitely smell the truffle once it hit the table, but the taste was fairly mild. Still good though!  It was callin my name!

Tandoori Salmon was next.  So much flavor in each bite...this is how Indian curry should be! Loved every bite!  Out of all the plates, THIS was my favorite by far!  Seriously, if I come back here again, I will probably order a full size of this bad boy!

Miso Mustard Angus Striploin, tender and flavorful beef. The miso sauce was great...I soaked it all up with the meats!  Yum

Laab Gai : Sweet and Sour Ground Chicken Salad with Roasted Rice, Dried Chili Powder and Mint. This was very light and refreshing with the mint and lettuce wrap.  Tasty :)

Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll. Probably the only dish I didn't love, but it was still good.

And to finish, Ginger Panna Cotta. This was good, with a nice hint of ginger.

We visited for dinner and for breakfast: 
For dinner I can highly recommend the TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNAISE. $28  
WOW.  just WOW. Succulent, fresh and tender pasta and meat.  absolutely delectable sauce.  it was amazing.
The Amuse Bouche was a lovely surprise.  Delicious salmon tartare.  I could have nibbled my way through the entire tray of them!  The spiced cashews were nice too.

I wasn't crazy about the offerings on the kids menu - they seemed way overpriced ($12 hot dog, $16 tomato basil pasta) and my son wanted Mac and Cheese which wasn't listed.  So I asked if they would accommodate us. Holy cow.
The Chef's Mac N Cheese was so unbelievably good I would go back and request that anytime: For ME!  The chef made cavatappi pasta and an amazing bechamel sauce, with buttercrumb topping - and charged us $12.  SO worth it!!!!  I polished off what my son didn't finish.  I was not ashamed in the least.

For Breakfast:
I devoured the NANTUCKET EGGS: Grilled jumbo lump crab cakes, poached eggs, baby spinach and hollandaise sauce.  Scrumptious.  I loved them.  The crab was oh-so very fresh and in nice big pieces.  Hollandaise sauce was on the side so you can control the portion.  My husband felt it was too rich a dish.  But I just loved it. 

here's why I didn't give it 5 stars:
I did not mind paying the entree prices, but thought the ordinary items were overpriced. 
An iced tea was $7.  seriously?  
A single scrambled egg (for my son) at $6 
Each coffee was $7.  
and the big kicker was an 8oz glass of whole milk was $8.00  sheesh.  

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant.

5279264,2010-12-30,3,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"Arriving early at The Mandarin Oriental for my 7am reservation I first had to navigate the space between Crystals/Aria/Mandarin Oriental.  While the Claes Oldenburg piece is certainly interesting and well placed, the directions to the Mandarin front door are not.  A walk, a 2 foot elevator ride (couldn't find the stairs,) more stairs, a doorman, and finally an elevator to the 23rd floor eventually found me standing at the hostess podium where I was greeted pleasantly by a pair of young Asian women - one of whom would end up being my server, Kristy.

Offered a free Newspaper (Times, Journal, or USA Today) I opted for the Times and was led to a comfortable seat near the window.  With soft wood tones and plenty of natural light throughout the room and a mild ambient soundtrack playing overhead I'll note that the restaurant was largely empty with only three other couples dining during my 90 minute breakfast.  With that noted, Kristy was an exemplary server and beverages remained full with her checking in on me frequently, asking about where I was from, and making small talk without being invasive at all.

Browsing the menu I'll note that the prices at MoZen are not at all cheap - but the quality service, room, sourcing, and preparation are worth the cost.  With orders placed my coffee was filled (Illy) and I browsed the provided selection of Staud's honey and jam while waiting.  To start my meal I was offered an amuse from the kitchen - a yuzu infused grapefruit ""elixir"" that was intensely tart but surprisingly sweet - a great way to awaken the palate, though not particularly a great match for the coffee.

For my first course (yes, I ordered two breakfasts since I couldn't decide on one) I opted for the Croque Madame featuring  grilled sourdough, Serrano ham, Gruyère cheese, sunny-side up eggs and gratin of Mornay.  Served with grilled vegetables and a side of apple wood smoked Kurobuta pork bacon, the Croque was excellent, albeit somewhat small and underfilled compared to that at Comme Ca, Bouchon, Morels, or Fleur.  Flawless eggs topping smooth and delicate ham, the sourdough itself was nicely toasted and the cheese/Mornay combination proved a mellow foil to the salty ham - all told a solid Croque, but probably not justifying the $19 price tag.

With at least my third refill of coffee (I lost track, but at $7 I figured I'd drink to my heart's content) poured it was only a matter or 15 minutes reading about the Islander's woeful season before my second dish would arrive - this time Walnut-Banana Bread French Toast.  Featuring ""thickly sliced warm banana and walnut bread, lightly battered and pan-fried with whipped cream and Vermont maple syrup"" this was one of those dishes that tasted every bit as good as it sounded.  While I generally prefer my French Toast in the custard style, using a hearty bread like Banana Walnut in this case allowed a crispy caramelized exterior while the bread itself maintained its characteristic pastry-like consistency.  Topped with warm and bubbly fresh syrup and creamy whipped butter (no whipped cream as noted on the menu) the taste and texture of dish was closer to dessert than breakfast and the flavors went very nicely with the coffee.  A hearty portion at $18 the price was still high, but I'd definitely order this one again on a return visit.

Finishing the French Toast Kristy asked if the chef could send out one last taste and I agreed without question.  While I cannot recall the official name, the item I received was delivered by the chef himself and described as a warm ""donut.""  Essentially a pate a choux similar to a large gougere but stuffed with warm vanilla custard the pastry itself literally melted in the mouth leaving behind a warm splash of creamy vanilla - while not exactly a donut, if it were a donut it'd be the best I've ever had.

Settling the hefty bill (about the same price as their Sunday brunch after tax and tip) I will note that Mozen was the most expensive solo breakfast I've ever attended, but at the same time it really is not out of line with what one would pay at Bouchon or Tableau and the food was just as good while the service was actually superior...and all three are equally tricky to locate.  Packing me up a cup of coffee and two extra ""donuts"" (no charge) to go I thanked Kristy and the woman at the reservations desk for a lovely meal and got lost, again, en route to the lobby.  Next time I'm in Vegas I'm heading back to MoZen for the brunch - assuming I can find it.  For now I'll just call it a hidden gem and hope that others discover it for themselves.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,5,poEdinP5-Pt2rPJ5AatipA

They offered a choice of main entree, which I opted for the big, buttery diver sea scallops.  In addition to the entree there was a small buffet for grazing.  The choices were good, but quite slim in comparison to the brunch pricing.  Choices included ginger soy noodles, shellfish, charcuterie selections, veggies, BBQ pork buns, shaomai, and best of all the sashimi.  The sashimi was most definitely the highlight of the meal. 

For an extra $35 they offered bottomless Perrier-Jouet, but they were out, so they substituted Veuve Clicquot.  It was a nice and logical substitution, but I like PJ better and that was part of the allure that motivated us to opt for the Mozen brunch. 

Service was a struggle.  I think our server must have been new because we had to ask for every drink refill and on occasion we had to ask multiple times.  It took 4 separate requests and an hour to get drawn butter for dipping the crab, which arrived 45 minutes later.

Mozen was one of those place I've had bookmarked forever, mainly for their brunch but $30 for lunch seems very reasonable for such a high rated spot.

The service was top notch from the get go.  They were very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and even though we almost went a la carte, our waiter urged us to go with the RE menu since ""it's the best of what we offer"".  Who wants to pay more than $15 for Indian curry anyways? :)

The Benito box offered a variety of diverse flavors.  It was almost like a mini tour of Asia!  The box had chicken tandoori in a mahkani sauce, California rolls (with real crab), garlic naan, miso mustard sliced steak and the matcha tiramisu being the perfect ending for it all.  My favorite was the salmon crudo tartare.  The freshness of the salmon combined with the nice spicy kick it had was fantastic.  I tried to buy another can of this as it would've been just perfect being mixed with a bowl of rice but alas...

The waiter said he mentioned to the chef that they should offer this combination lunch daily and apparently he scoffed at the idea.  Perhaps too many dishes to deal with all the time?  It would rival Estiatorio Milos for best lunch on the strip if they did.

This is probably 1 of my favorite lunch spots in Las Vegas. It's such a hidden gem on the 3rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, so no one knows unless you stay here or via words of mouth. I've been to Vegas  6-8 times a year. I always try to fix be a new restaurant to try each time I come. With my parents during the July 4th week, they really enjoyed the ambiance, the view, and food here. 

Even when you do a search on Yelp, it doesn't show up because the food here is modern culinary tour through Asia with a wide variety of delicious dishes served alongside a selection of American classics.

Everything is quite delicious and beautifully presented in all little tiny box or China. Enjoy brunch every weekend featuring specialty items such as our Bento Box Brunch with crispy scallop and masago roll, fried calamari, char siu bao dim sum and choice of entrée or choose from other offerings like green tea waffles, fresh sushi rolls, hickory smoked salmon scramble and much more. As well as the exquisite cuisine, free flowing mimosas are available along with a selection of bloody marys. Weekend Brunch is served every Saturday and Sunday starting at 12 until 2:30pm.

Even their brunch, I love how the fruit, potato, and egg would never touch each other :) genius for people with picky eater phobia that don't like their food to be touch ;) .

Their bento box is my favorite meal here. Try dessert too, the matcha cake, you would love it, not sweet at all. 

Good service, a bit out of the way because it's not in the casino hotel type. Reservation is highly recommended.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,13,7,4,-ckDmCNfAnHylMajA2-i1w

I came here for dinner and got a delicious cod covered in black truffle sauce for $32. Most entrees are in the high $20's to low $40's and appetizers are just under $20. I was slightly disappointed with the limited wine list. They only had about 5-6 options of red by the glass, ranging in $16-$24 per glass. There was a decent selection of bottles, though.

I ordered the Korean bulgogi, and my husband ordered the Nantucket eggs Benedict. We both agreed that the food was just entirely flavorless and under-seasoned, which was shocking based on all of the other reviews. I also ordered a latte, which was super mediocre and definitely not worth the money. 

The ambience and service were excellent, however, which was standard for every place in the hotel. Overall, I wouldn't go back to this particular restaurant...",yzrFhOYx7WoY5KQZchfXag,1,0,2,sAQZSccX3rA8ASbaOdgJ-w
5650422,2012-06-22,0,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"Overall, 3.5 stars. While I adore the Mandarin Oriental, I expected more from MOzen Bistro. Don't get me wrong- nothing was in the slightest bit bad! But I just felt like for the money you pay here, there should have been more urgency for quality/above&beyond creativity. 

Okay, something that really threw me off: it's the Mandarin, so of course I'm going to get tea. I ordered the green, but asked if I could do this iced. They said sure, no problem. They bring me out a piping hot pot of green tea, and cup of ice. Well, I'm sure that you can imagine the combination. They could have done this much better (brewed it twice to triple as strong, poured it into excessive amounts of ice, then had a separate pitcher for me, etc). But, this was just the drink, so I won't judge them a ton on that. 

Service was standard for the Mandarin. That in itself says enough. 

The food took about an average time to arrive. I got the Eggs Migas (their southwestern approach to scrambled eggs). These were good, but I'm glad I ordered a side of goat cheese to scramble in...it gave it a nice extra kick. 
My mom had the steel-cut oatmeal and expressed her delight with it. My dad had the omelette, and it was just a standard omelette...nothing special or out of the ordinary. 
Sister and her boyfriend had the French toast on the baguette..and they said it was again ""just okay.""

The real winner:
--Yogurt, granola, & fruit parfait! PLEASE just get this. Housemade yogurt and granola and it was divine. Great, fresh fruit throughout.
--Chicken-apple sausage! Just a tad sweet and big on taste. 

I prefer Thomas Keller's Bouchon over at the Venetian-- more selection, not as overpriced, and just overall better, in my opinion. If you're at the Mandarin Oriental, though, then this is your best (and only?) bet for a breakfast and/or early lunch.",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,1,0,3,YmEh8t8WRIrSiB6iu15y0g

First of all, the restaurant has a great location - a cool view of some of the strip, which is nice. It was very beautiful inside as well, and not crowded, which certainly added to the romantic ambiance.

I ordered a glass of wine, and my husband ordered a bellini. Both were really great. The menu was a mixture of Japanese and Thai, in my opinion. We started with the spicy tuna roll, and I ordered a steak salad. My husband ordered duck.

The spicy tuna roll was awesome. I LOVE sushi and this was excellent. My steak salad wasn't huge, but it was very tasty. The dressing was a bit spicy. My husband loved his duck.

We finished our meal with crème brulee, which was excellent.

Our server was excellent - very polite, and gave us great recommendations on things to do while we were in Vegas. It was a great meal, we'd definitely come back again.",nzm6MM_2mc2TN3EyiceqvQ,0,1,5,X5E8KHUOzXr0QiL7qKkeqA

There was a ""big party"" in the other room.  The place was otherwise empty.  Servers were grabbing chairs and tables out of our room to take to the ""big party"" room.  We were completely neglected.  We were literally the only people in the place and couldn't get service.  For the price, the food sucked.  Obviously they don't do enough business to keep seafood fresh or to hire qualified chefs.. What a joke.

So, the ""big party"" shows up and it's a bunch of wasted frat boy goofballs in cargo shorts.  Screaming and cheering.  How is that allowable in a restaurant that professes to be fine-dining, at least their prices do?  Desperation.  That's how.

I was here over the weekend and we had some dim sum appetizers for the Chinese New Year and they were all fabulous. The duck salad is great. I have not tried the sushi, but I don't think it's their specialty. 

The one downside is the service. When the server came over to tell us our specials, he couldn't pronounce words like ""salmon"" properly which I would kind of expect from a high-end restaurant. 

 It is strange to me that a restaurant this good would be so empty (on the weekends) when it is so good.  It's definitely a hidden gem on the Strip.",akgMrTkbtc80Coh4t5Kzpg,0,0,4,_Lq7VX6wwi7OYtT8M0enqA

Between the 5 of us, we ordered filet mignon, sea bass, and chicken for entrees, and ordered sushi rolls, calamari, chef salads, and caprese salads for appetizers. The food was good, no doubt - but memorable? Not really. If you're looking for a good meal at a 5 star restaurant, then this is a good candidate.

The service was attentive and the ambiance was relaxing. I made reservation for the Sunday brunch expecting for the brunch buffet with sushi, seafood, and chef's selection of dessert. Unfortunately, the Sunday brunch buffet was no longer available as of 2nd week of October. I was quite disappointed, but the extensive weekend brunch menu was quite delightful. 

We ordered the Japanese bento box which came with a roll, fried calamari, choice of entree (chicken waffles), bao. The flavor is light and decadent. The fried chicken was juicy, but not greasy. 

Green tea waffle with lychee compote and passion fruit butter - Sounds like the ultimate asian breakfast fusion! Once again, the flavor is very light and the waffle was crispy. Interesting combination. 

The best part would be the nigiri which was very fresh and decent price for a quality piece. FYI - i only eat nigiri from top rated japanese restaurant. The hamachi and uni nigiri were so fresh and delicious that i ordered for round 2. The combination of the rice and fish were well-balanced.

It was our first time in Vegas unsupervised, so we kinda just wandered around towards whatever caught our attention. Anyways, we arrived after walking the strip for a while for lunch.  Service was amazing.  Greeted with a smile and super helpful.  We received the menu and some delicious jasmine tea to start.  After a short while, they brought out some bread with three spreads.  I really enjoyed the yogurt spread and my girl liked the pesto.  

Then, it was time to order.  My lady had this green curry, which was super spicy and full of flavor.  It was served with rice.  She loved it. I had the cornish game hen which came with awesome mashed potatoes and gravy and bone marrow.  Good choice.  Very tasty.  

The bill was pretty steep.  Around $75 including tip.  

Overall, a pretty good place.  The atmosphere is nice and the window seats were pleasant to sit next to.  Personally, wouldn't be my first choice, but it was a good experience.",jucMr-Nba7XZZd8azV33Bg,0,0,3,kfeediU7OSxMiCSEfnAH1A

5768843,2014-01-30,1,xEH00X_VoRepWKXQrragmw,"I would not describe this place as a destination whatsoever. Sort of accidentally went here because I was looking for a highly rated Japanese place by the City Center that was not wildly expensive. I was not totally wrong in this expectation other than the style of the place. Mozen is basically the Mandarin Oriental generic hotel restaurant. The menu is all over the place as it has sushi, chinese food, ramen, bimibaps, thai food, and american food on a completely not cohesive menu. I ended up ordering a serrano ham and chicken sandwich (~$24) that came with a salad and fries (I took the option to just have a giant salad). It was very good. The service started out very good as well, but as our lunch was ending and we got to around ~2pm the staff kind of disappeared and we had to aggressively search for someone to give us our check.

This is a very low key place in Vegas, like the Mandarin hotel itself. It's great if you are still in physical shock from the night before and want to escape the cigarette smoke for an hour or so.

Ate here for brunch on Thanksgiving with Justin B and really liked it here at MOzen. the restaurant is on the 3rd floor at the Mandarin Oriental and we were seated at a table with a window view of the Aria pedestrian bridge which made it fun to people watch while eating haha. So this is a brunch buffet but you also get a served entree as part of the meal as well for $69 (i think this was a special holiday pricing) - yes this is a bit pricey for brunch but its not that much more than your normal brunch buffets at the major hotels and i thought the quality of the food was very high. plus another $19 for unlimited mimosas ;) definitely a splurge for brunch but we're on vacation so why not haha

for the buffet, i was impressed with the selection. seafood consisted of oysters, crab claws, shrimp cocktail, some nigri and rolls, and smoked salmon. also had a station for salads and i particularly enjoyed a pesto pasta salad. and there's also some fruit, oatmeal, granola but who needs that at at buffet haha. there was a carving station as well complete with turkey, stuffing, ham, prime rib and roasted veggies. my favorite was a noodle station where i was able to get won ton soup. it was hard not to get really full from this buffet selection before my actual entree haha. then when you're ready, you can tell your server to fire up your entree and i went with the scallops since i didnt want anything too heavy. the dish comes with 2 scallops and they were really good! very moist and flavorful and served with some veggies. oh and the desserts! so amazing - caramel macarons, creme brulee, chocolate mouuse and much more. it was hard to stop haha

overall i really enjoyed my brunch experience here! the buffet is small enough where you're not overwhelmed with a million food choices and a million people waiting in line for food. didnt have to deal with any big crowds and since they take reservations, we got seated right away instead of waiting for hours to eat haha. plus since its a smaller scale buffet, i felt the quality and freshness of ingredients was better than most buffets. added bonus was that they actually make the mimosas for you when you need a refill rather than at some buffets i've seen them pre-made and just sitting in a pitcher ready to pour and serve.",HO35wso-psqx0GF--QSwGA,2,1,4,K5Rq6j4hG9WHP2iY_EwtUg

Because there is no casino at this hotel, it is so peaceful and serene.  When we pulled up into the secluded driveway, there was only a couple other cars.  So refreshing not to be in a sea of honking horns and cabs.  

When we walked in, the music in the lobby was so soft and soothing, as was the music in the elevators that took us to the 3rd floor where the restaurant is located. Again, so refreshing not to hear the slot machines nor walk through a haze of cigarette smoke.  

The waitress explained the Restaurant Week menu in the most zen-like, soothing voice. The service was fantastic from everyone.  Seated by the window with a view of the City Center, I almost forgot that we were in Las Vegas. We were there to experience the Restaurant Week lunch menu ($30.13) so that is what we ordered, although the other menu items did look enticing.    

The bento box was filled with:
- Murgh Makhani Tandoori-  a roasted marinated chicken in a creamy indian curry. This was my favorite dish and even better with the Garlic Naan that accompanies it. 
- Salmon Crudo Tartare with marinated hearts of palm. This was my second favorite dish.
- Miso mustard NY certified angus with miso mustard sauce.  The beef was a bit chewy, but the sauce was very flavorful. 
- California roll with lump crab, avocado, and cucumber.  This was just ""meh"". 
- Matcha Tiramisu- mascarpone green tea mousse, raspberry coulis.  This was so delicious, but the size of 2 dice.  :(  At the time, I didn't think this bento box was enough food.  I was almost tempted to order some sushi from the sushi bar.  However, I am glad I didn't because on the drive home and the food settled, I realized how stuffed I was.  

I really enjoyed the offerings and am now intrigued to return.  They also have a breakfast menu in addition to the lunch and dinner served.
