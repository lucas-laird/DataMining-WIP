Daily buffet starts at 8:30 pm and they have quite a selection of appetizers, sushi, rolls and entries.  We kept to the sushi cuz allowed us to try more.  The jalape√±o tuna and the tourched scallops were excellent.  The presentation on the poki tuna was wonderful and delicious. 

To top it off, you had to try their mango mocho and green tea ice cream.

You get to choose from the menu, made to order and eat til you're stuffed..hard to beat!",smPKp46qzdxJCVKH4ja5kA,0,0,4,JqhpMtkTJ0DXMWjZPfkqgg

I thought I had found the best sushi I could find in town. This place surprised me!

The decor is cute, the sushi bar is very nice. It felt like everyone in there was happy/pleased and it had to do with the fact that they were there and having an excellent time.

Besides the excellent sushi, I thought that the sushi chefs had great personalities. Sometimes you have excellent food and the staff is just LAME. These guys were talking, commenting on the stuff on TV, laughing, still very attentive, giving sushi suggestions (good ones at that) and were having drinks and saying ""KANPAIIII!!!"" and clinking glasses with us. Rolls were made quickly and nicely. Very nice place. Don't hesitate to try it out!",iyhqoE49PTX2VNITzpDw6w,0,0,5,r0iJfOCz1104lhBBs0p7Pg
4113548,2007-01-03,0,6ZtGxbWeQPen-ecU4ZBz9w,This is the best restaurant in Vegas.  The food is amazing and the service is perfect.  I especially like the shrimp tempura on the appetizer menu and the funky roll (soft-shell crab).,xc4rdsrGoS-Yk3TXLefmtg,0,0,5,Es9OnjUgWBZtJ0YTF_-TJg

I use to live around the corner.
I've eaten here so many times.
I hold stock in this place.
The Sushi master makes riceless sushi.
He also uses thin cucumber instead of nori.
They have different flavored rock candy martini's.
I love Cafe Wasabi.
We shall meet again.
Soon.",KKNnYagjyoR4ZCJhrEs1PA,2,3,5,FVp9772gpFfW5BG27ytrTA

The prices were not cheap, but much more reasonable than the Strip, and the food really was first-rate. The place was empty when I was there, but the service was very friendly and quick. 

I loved the shrimp tempura, and the rolls were outstanding too. Didn't try any sashimi, so I won't comment on that. Bill for two was $50 even.",YORoJ6RecFVGcSwG8kR77w,1,0,5,35btDdgHyZUjPf7QD-AR_g
