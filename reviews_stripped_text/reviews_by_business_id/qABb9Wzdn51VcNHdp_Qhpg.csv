684992,2016-01-07,0,qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg,"Upon entry to the restaurant, we thought with the yummy looking baked goods display, we were in for a delicious treat. However, I can say that I have not been treated worse at a restaurant in my entire life. The customer service gets zero stars, but we ended up having the pizza and house salad which were pretty good, but get only 2 stars since it was fine, not great. My biggest complaint is that we felt very unwelcome, and here's why. 
There are two sections in the restaurant. By the Bakery area there are seats. The back part has tables for dine in. My order was going to be a combination. ...a glass of wine and a nice salad, plus two slices of pizza.
We asked if we could sit in the restaurant area, since most of our order was going to be off the menu and there were no more seats in the front. Instead of making us feel welcome, they had a whole discussion why we couldn't get pizza there, or sit there cause where we were sitting is for ordering off menu only. We were in fact getting salad and wine off the menu.  We were told that there were no seats in the front and that's where we had to sit. (cause we wanted only slices not a whole pie). The hostess was loud and rude, and  I looked annoyed, and then the hostess said ""the boss is going to be mad"" but she'll just put us at a table in the corner and we can stay.  And we got sent to a table in the corner, with no table cloth, and no utensils like we were imposing. There were no other customers I might point out, that we were taking the table from.Here we are trying to give them money, and they wouldn't go out of their way for our business. They were going to turn us away. Very unprofessional especially in the restaurant business where the competition is abundant.
At first, I thought they were going to bring the utensils and table cloth,  but, they didnt. It then took another 10 minutes for someone to take our order.  I ordered cabernet, and got chianti, and wasn't told till it was to late.  When we were finished with our meal,  the check got dropped off, without us being asked if we wanted anything else- which we did. 
The food may be alright, but I would never return. Its not so good that I need to be treated like they're doing me a favor by allowing me to eat their food.

883937,2014-02-05,0,qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg,"We found this little 'outdoor' cafe in a non busy part of the Grand Canal Shops. We sat down for dinner and I have to say we had a delicious and very relaxed Italian dinner. The service was excellent and the waitress very attentive. The prices were not outrageous compared to what we experienced elsewhere in Vegas and I thought it was excellent value for money. The restaurants near St. Marks' square were expensive and extremely busy (wait for table) and noisy. This is a great alternative. It is next door and associated with Zefferino's, but is not that menu which is expensive. They have their own breakfast, lunch and dinner menu.
My wife had Spaghetti Aglio e Olio which she pronounced to be delicious for $16. I had Salmone Piccata - $22.95 which was moist and delicious. I started with a very fresh green salad starter, and had the Gelato for dessert. This had to be the greatest gelato I have ever had. It was unbelievably creamy and intense in flavor. 
The gelato is available inside the bakery which also has cakes and tarts that look great although we did not try them. It also has a coffee bar in the back; sandwiches and opens early for breakfast.
I would say a hidden gem. Not 5 stars because I reserve that for the greatest, but I found no fault at all.",Ds1N7w0V2KBUTv8lxOjv6Q,0,0,4,zoDPopNQ33zHHew0VPapUQ

Aside from the Ravioli a la Vodka.. there is nothing else to rave about. Whatever you eat here, is cooked much better in other places and that even includes the pastries. The canoli was crunchy, but the filling was flat, it lacked dimension to it- as if they only used bland cheese. The ravioli is really good, what makes it so delicious is the sauce; everything is cooked and seasoned to perfection. But it's just that, cheese stuffed ravioli with a light, yet creamy, vodka sauce. 

The service is a hit or miss, it doesn't even depend if it's busy or not... it really depends on whatever server you got.

I would only recommend this place if you are hungry and at the Venetian. The prices are reasonable compared to the rest of the restaurants (not fast foods) onsite.

1059456,2010-09-13,0,qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg,"The cookies are good and the cafe latte was fine, however...

Saw this place listed in the Palazzo's restaurant guide.  There's a photo that shows a fully stocked bakery.  It looked really good, so I marked this place for the following morning's breakfast.  Mistake.

First, there's a vast selection of breads shown on the shelves in baskets--in the photo.  When I went late Monday morning, the baskets were empty and stacked carelessly on the shelves. I inquired about the bread, and the lady pulled some monster loaf out of a plastic bag.  Too big, and that's it?  Terrible presentation of the breads, clearly they're not selling many.

Ordered a selection of dry Italian cookies. They tasted good enough, though I'm hardly an expert of them.  Also ordered a cannelloni; it was decent, but when it comes to these I prefer less sweet and more ricotta in the filling.

The absolute mess was the sandwich.  With everything else, I ordered a mozzarella with grilled vegetables sandwich to go.  The first surprise when I got back to the room was that it was a hot sandwich.  The  second surprise was when I unwrapped it's aluminum foil and a bunch of sandwich juices dripped out onto my clean pants. What? Why was this sandwich dripping juices? Why was the bread soggy?  Why was the lettuce wilted? I thought it to be perhaps one of the worst sandwiches in recent memory. The ingredients were good by themselves, but a hot soggy sandwich with wilted lettuce is nothing that anyone should be served.

I'd definitely look for another option.",b34Cfr0ilfXKI1tW42KZjg,0,0,1,vQMFv9lEuzNz6RVkhGNtUg
1078788,2015-07-01,0,qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg,"We had dinner here as part of a package of various events at the Venetian. The location and food were probably 4-star but the service was closer to 2, so I've rounded it to 3 overall. 

Located deep inside the Venetians shopping  center, this restaurant/bakery is embellished with the Italian themed decor and the painted sky ceilings throughout the building and has the feel of eating at an outdoor square. In addition, there's a performers square a few feet away from the seating so we got to enjoy musical and artistic talent throughout dinner. 

The service, as mentioned before, was a bit lackluster. We arrived between 5-6pm and although they were busy there were empty tables and no wait to be seated. However, once our server discovered we were part of the promotion our menus were snatched off the table and he immediately wanted our order. Then we were ignored until kitchen staff dropped off the appetizers. The mixed greens salads were a joke, with about a quarter head of iceberg lettuce and three (yes, I counted!) little green leaves, topped with tomatoes and red onions that looked like they were picked off a Jack in the Box sandwich. Yuck! And of course no one came to see how we were doing. 

However, the entrees were a pleasant surprise. The garnish and sides were tasty and the meat was well seasoned and perfectly prepared. Without the promotional prices we had I would still go back for dinner. 

The poor service continued with long waits, no one checking on us, and as I said they weren't that busy. The servers just disappeared inside the bakery and wouldn't come back for minutes at a time. We had to wait almost 5 minutes for the dessert tray. I don't know if this was because of our promotional status or what but due to the delays and bored attitude we only tipped about 14% (usually we do 20+). I would probably want to go back a few times before giving up, maybe it was understaffed or he was having a bad day.",pmWguGOqTSPx8GqE0xr2Hw,0,0,3,rPuyDQzaNLVr72K9Tm75bg

I stopped by early for a breakfast treat.  Only about half of the pastries were labeled so I had a little difficulty communicating my request to the counter person.  She seemed very reluctant to follow me to the display so I could point out what I wanted, then when asked what they were, she mumbled something unintelligible.  I decided to go for it anyway, but was disappointed when I ordered my latte and was told I had to get that at a different counter.  Couldn't I at least pay in one spot?  No  
Then, she had the nerve to keep my change without offering it to me.  OK, so it wasn't much, but I know what that tip jar is for and should be the one to decide if she deserved it (she didn't).
On to the coffee bar.  Luckily it wasn't busy yet, but waiting in two lines would really stink.  I just want coffee and a pastry!  My latte was Illy and had no foam.   I think I counted about three bubbles lining one side of the cup.  Hmmmm.
I was able to grab a table outside of the shop.  The display case had looked good and I wasn't disappointed in my pastries.  One was a chocolate pastry roll that looked roughly like a breadstick, but as I don't speak mumble, I don't know what it was called.

1190141,2009-12-22,0,qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg,"We had chicken with artichoke, mushroom and asparagus, chicken parm and lasagna.  Every dish rested somewhere between stouffers and something I cooked for myself in college.  I think Olive Garden is better, and I'm not being a snob - I love the OG when i want dependable, familiar chain style food.  

I don't know what the place means to be, so it's hard to rate it.  Since I'm at least being seated by a hostess and there is a waiter checking up on me, I'm assuming it's at least a casual diner? The food, however, suggests it's more of an ""order at the counter and grab your own table/silverware"" joint (which exists in the attached Bakery). So I think the food/restaurant got lost somewhere in between. 

The dishes were pretty much assembled with pre-existing components mixed with fresher ingredients; i.e. my potatoes were kinda like the frozen Ore Ida homefries but I was also given a nice little saute of green, red and yellow bell peppers.   The pasta sauces definitely tasted canned to me, without any added fresh herbs or anything to liven them up. The lasagna noodles definitely were mushy and tasted exactly as I remember canned ravioli tasting.  To be fair, my chicken was really tender and pan fried nicely though. So, it's a bit mixed and matched for me. 

There were a few other pasta dishes I saw, and a salmon dish, that other people were eating that looked really good, so maybe we just ordered the wrong things. This place averages around 15 -20 dollars a plate which sounds high, but compared to the surrounding restaurants isn't that bad and which may account for its ""pre-made"" taste.",vbynLMiZ6-ZvU3Z80j--xQ,0,0,2,PdcFqC3W6lw_iyyNXIfHfQ

My brother had the spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs are beefy, solid, and are just right - NOT too much breadcrumbs.

My expectations went down the hill. Why? because I had huge hopes of this place to be what I had in my mind, and it wasn't .... :'''(

It's the first bakery/restaurant that you see, once you step into the fake sky area of the Venetian Hotel. It's so cute and cozy to sit, or just to watch it, but the food was burnt oil experience. 

After a night of tequila shots and hilarious dancing at TAO, and after 2 hours sleep, I was starving. All I wanted was nice hot bitter coffee with some omelet and classic maple-syruped  pancakes, was I asking too much?

So, the four of us went to Tintoretto, for some heavy breakfast. I got what I was wishing, omelet and pancakes. It took a while for me meal to come. I could smell and taste the grease (very much so ewww for my oral cavity). I ate cos I wanted to shut my stomachs screams. The omelet was hopeless case, how can you freaking mess up an omelet? Grease flavored and un-matched veggies soaked in oil were accompanying the bad-success omelet.

So, I just give 3 stars because I had fun there sitting with my three loves. And the bitter coffee was good. (I guess that's not to hard to mess it up)

I'm not hating this place, but I don't love it either. It's an alright place. 

For your taste buds maybe it's good, for mine, it's just to heavy...

We walked up just after 4 pm on a saturday and asked if we could use the coupons for dinner at that time. The hostess/server said we could and sat us right away. She was polite and spoke with a beautiul Italian accent. 

We were seated at a table for 2 right along the railing with people walking by in the Grand Canal Shoppes. While we enjoy people watching, it kind of backfired on us as we were trying to enjoy our meal and a group of people that appeared to be deciding on whether or not they should eat here, walked up and stopped for a minute to get a good look at what we were eating.

The free dinner was limited to certain selections but still some nice things to choose from. My wife had yellow squash soup as her appetizer with chicken marsala as her main course. I had the house salad and penne pomodoro for my main course. I know that's just pasta and tomato sauce but I had so much meat for breakfast that day I just wanted some good old fashioned carbs for dinner. Little did I know they would also bring us as much fresh bread and butter as we could eat.

We ordered a couple Peroni beers with our dinner and I found their beer prices to be better than most places on the strip.

She loved her soup and my salad was good and fresh but their house dressing was amazing. A sweet balsamic vinegarette. I should have asked if they sold it in a bottle. My wife said the chicken marsala was great and my pasta was a generous portion with fresh basil and chunks of tomato. A cup of good coffee was also included with the free meal.

The plate was drenched in watery oil too, which made my lips itch. The alfredo had a large cream sauce to noodle ratio but lacked flavor.

Service wasn't bad but it almost seemed to cover the minimum. They came by twice to refill water before the main course. We didnt get another water refill until the check came. They don't really give you a choice of how much pepper or cheese you want on your plate. They just dump the cheese on or turn the pepper grinder once and call it good.

Most places had stopped serving breakfast at 11am. We walked into the Venetian and through their food court area and didn't find anything appetizing. Walking through the Grand Canal Shoppes we both noticed the restaurant with the adorable ""outdoor-patio"" seating. We'd seen it many times but never thought of eating there thinking it may be a bit pricey. It was almost 12pm and they were still serving breakfast and the menu looked reasonably priced. 

We were seated immediately and our server, Alethea, who was probably the most wonderful and attentive server ever, came and took our drink order and answered our questions about the menu. We ordered and food came out quick. Hubby had to wash his hands and breakfast arrived while he was still away so Alethea had the busboy bring out a little cover to keep his food warm. 

Their breakfast menu is pretty basic: eggs, omelets, pancakes, pastries and such, but I'm a pretty simple gal and so I ordered the buttermilk pancakes with caramelized strawberries; hubby ordered the Italian omelet. The pancakes came in a stack of three dripping with melted butter and strawberries in a strawberry syrup. They were probably the best pancakes I'd ever had.  

Hub's omelet was wonderful, a little different from our typical omelets as it had tomato sauce on it. It was cooked with Italian sausage and mozzarella cheese and served with a side of sautéed potatoes, bell peppers and onion and slice of toast, which looked like a piece of French bread. 

Alethea came by and filled our water glasses and checked in on us periodically and didn't rush us at all, a huge pet peeve if mine while dining. The setting, as mentioned above, was in the Grand Canal Shoppes under the ""sky"". People were passing by and I found the atmosphere so lovely.

I then ordered their Italian omelette.  It's an omelette with Italian sausage and mozzarella cheese topped with red sauce.  It's served with potatoes that have red, yellow, and green pepper pieces.  You also get two slices of toasted Italian bread.

My coffee was refilled twice without asking and service was on point.  This is out of the way for a local but it gave me chance to watch tourists being tourists.  I also got to walk the Grand Canal Shops and look for my friend who is one of the gondoliers.  (I guess you'd call her a gondolette).

4074410,2012-06-19,0,qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg,"So I've recently returned from my first trip to Italy and now I've become this HUGE European coffee snob. Not to epic, douche-like proportions, but let me say that Starbucks just can't cut it anymore. Since my return, I have been searching for coffee that is close to the crazy tastiness you get in each cup in Italy. So far, my search has proven to be fruitless...until I decided to spend a Saturday searching for coffee at the Venetian. I tried every coffee bar on the property and this one was by far the best -- and the closest to a real European coffee experience. 

I walked up to the bar and ordered 2 macchiato espressos. I love this place because you actually can stand and drink your coffee at the bar (the true Italian way). The barista was skilled and the coffee was the Illy brand, which is superior than anything else you can get in the U.S. in my opinion. Best of all, the coffee was served in a dainty little ceramic espresso cup. Paper cups piss me off and I like having my beverage in a REAL container. 

The coffee was good and was very close to what I had in Italy. It was rich with a slightly bitter coffee taste and a nice presentation. Smooth, hot and delicious. Of course, where I paid 90 cents for the same thing in Europe, here is cost a whopping $3.75 per cup (yikes)! And don't order ice water, they will only sell you bottled water for $2. 

I would recommend this place and it is definitely worth a trip to the Grand Canal Shoppes if you are a coffee lover. I cannot comment on the food since I only visited the coffee bar, but they had lots of takeaway yums and ginormous pastries. And pizza in the back too. There's also an adjacent sit-down restaurant but if you just need a java jolt, head into the market. The coffee bar is to the right, right up at the entrance.

I am wary of any gelato in Vegas, as almost all of it is fake, Americanized trash that appeals to the tourists. 

However, walking past Tintoretto's gelato stand, the sign caught my eye- ""gelato artigianale""- ""housemade gelato"" in italian. My husband and I approached, and sure enough, the gelato looked like the real deal... But how would it taste??

Maria rosa was kind enough to let us taste as many flavors as we liked. All were delicious and tasted just like our favorite gelateria in the hills of Italy!! Best yet, we felt right at home, being able to talk in Italian to Maria rosa.. It was as if we had never left the Homeland. 

The gelato is made fresh daily, on premises, with only the best Italian ingredients- the coffee flavor (""caffe"") is incredible, made with fresh brewed Italian Illy espresso. Almond (mandorla) is amazing, with caramelized almonds on top, and pistachio is made with Sicilian pistachios. 

$12 for two small (two-flavor) cups-- expensive, although it cost about the same as gelato does in Italy with the euro-dollar conversion.

We loved the place so much we came back twice that weekend. Definitely a gem amidst the tourist traps of the Venetian! If you want authentic gelato, this is the place to go!!!

Grazie mille to Maria rosa, who went out of her way to make our gelato run special!!!",JgOsI4hTFBiT-_ROgb1kqg,1,0,5,ORtxVWzM50RqHC4q1wGh5g

I will say that the staff was super friendly and attentive, but it still doesn't make the cut when your selling tiramisu that tastes 1 day old or 2 or 3.

I tried their $5.75 tiramisu and it was maybe 1.5 inches all the way around, but the worst part was the edges of the pastry were crusty hard like day old bread. I'm not a tiramisu expert but I do know that it's not suppose to be crusty. It's suppose to be semi soft and spongy all the way around from the inside out. Wow, this was really the worst I've ever had... kid you not.

Also my hub ordered a coconut sugar covered macaroon type cookie + 2 chocolate chip cookies and he only had a small bite and didn't even bother eating the rest. This comes from a man who will eat anything and everything, so basically it was super bad. If your a pastry shop that can't even make cookies right not sure why your still ""baking"".

We also tried an Irish coffee drink that was pure alcohol and barely any coffee. It was strong as heck and not suppose to be like that, but it was the most somewhat redeeming part of this pastry hell on wheels... lol? I don't know. In a nutshell this whole tastebud ""extravaganza"" cost us $14 too much and at this point I am definitely forever checking Tintoretto off my bakery foodie list.",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,2,0,1,yG5jGb9qelRA15Vo2jRoFQ

We (party of 6) really wanted one of those cute tables on the piazza (in the restaurant's designated seating area), and planned on a more substantial breakfast, but at 10:30AM it just was not going to happen. So we pulled three little round tables (in front of the window) together and while three of us held them down, three of us went inside to see what we could come up with. 

The first thing my brother noticed is that the ladies behind the counter were speaking Italian, which was pretty cool. 

The second thing we learned is that the pizza and calzones were not ready yet. 

And the third thing we learned was that if you wanted to order off the menu, instead of from the bakery display case, you can. 

We (the 4 on my ticket) ended up with two ham and cheese croissants ($6.50), a danish ($3.25), one of the fancy desserts with strawberries ($5.75 - you can see it in Enjella L.'s photos), two small coffees ($2.25) and a couple glasses of water.

Since we came here mainly for the atmosphere, (and by golly was it classy), I will start off with a heads up to any of you who're looking for quality food. Coming here might not be the best idea. I ordered a ham, provolone with tomato and basil panini for us to share, a hot coffee for me, water for my mom and a glass of merlot for papa. The 'panini' came in a regular sandwich bread and taking it from my mom, who experienced working at a coffee shop when she was younger, 'ordinary' was the word to describe it, not to mention, what was served to us wasn't a panini to begin with. (it would've been a grilled sandwich and the provolone cheese would've melted. Ours was cold) The coffee tasted more like tap water than anything, really and I had to douse it in a lot of milk before I could bring myself to drink it down. 

Service wasn't exceptional although we did have a friendly waitress. She knew the menu well and brought in our food pretty swiftly. I just wish that the way the staff presented themselves was as neat and sophisticated as the restaurant they were working in was. Nevertheless, if there's one thing you'd want to come here for, it'd be the whole 'outdoor-ish' Italian cafe setting, a great place to just sit and talk.

I always stop by here whenever I am in Vegas and pick up a pound (which can easily run you close to 20 bucks), but is worth every penny.  I have yet to find a place between San Diego and Vegas that makes these cookies just the way I like it.  Not drenched in cheap Nestle chocolate, good smathering of preservatives between each layer and moist almond cake, not your Duncan Hines boxed variety.  They also do a good job of not melting on the 4 hour trip back to San Diego for me to share with family and friends who are sometimes disappointed to learn that although they are car friendly, I couldnt resist the temptation not to eat them all on the way home.

Make sure you call them to see if they have them! They often sell out by early afternoon, especially during high season.",7AHCbe8w6l9i9q1M3TWfjw,1,1,5,D5CHm8_wIynqAhdnXb1ldg

The food was very good as well.  I had a croissant with egg and cheese.  My husband had a plate of eggs, potatoes, and toast.  He also ordered a chocolate croissant which was delicious.

Then after another 25 minutes we were told that our order was delayed because of they were switching from breakfast to lunch. What?!?!?!  We left at that point having wasted a half an hour trying to get some eggs and toast. Worst service from start to finish I've had in maybe forever.

The food is pretty traditional Italian food.  Like my grandmother would have made if my grandmother were an Italian immigrant.  You can probably name 90% of the menu without ever seeing it.  Italian comfort food.

But then there's Mariarosa, the grandmother you wish you had.  She said she's worked for Tintoretto's for over 40 years -- 30 in Long Island, and the 11 years in Las Vegas.

Mariarosa welcomed us like family.  Told the waiter to take care of us.  Came by to check that we were happy.  When my wife went to the bakery, Mariarosa had them arrange the pastries on a plate.  She pinched my son's cheeks.  She's the nonna all of us wish we could have, at least for 90 minutes. (Check out the photo.)

I deduct a star because service is consistently on the unfriendly side, but whatta you gonna do? Tintoretto is located in the Venetian Hotel, right alongside the Grand Canal. I recommend ordering the cannoli and espresso to go, find a quiet spot along the canal, and enjoy this magnificent dessert while being serenaded by the gondoliers.",vg1FBGFtjwL_KLUvQyGnIw,1,1,4,nIJz5N2FsdntZIxM6cVOqA

I'll keep it short and simple: When I eat at an Italian restaurant, ESPECIALLY one in a freaking expense Italian hotel setting, I expect the pasta to be fan-freaking-tastic and homemade. So I ordered the spaghetti bolognese (sp?) and the spaghetti was the out-of-the-box stuff I make at home and the sauce was unimpressive. Service was spotty on top of that.

Tintoretto is located at the Grand Canal Shoppes inside the Venetian.  There is also a restaurant inside, but we were here for the bakery.  When you walk inside, the baked goods look so very inviting inside their display cases.  Everything looked so good.

I finally decided to give their pecan tart a try.  It did not disappoint, and it was one of the best pecan tarts that I have ever eaten.  Probably the second best that I have ever had the pleasure of trying.  Even the price of $4.75 was affordable.  Being at the Venetian, I expected the price to be much higher.  The portion was just right.  Not big, but not small either.  Three of us were able to share it.  The pecan tart was not overly sweet.  Crust was so yummy.  We thoroughly enjoyed sharing it at one of their tables outside the shop.  People watching while snacking made for an awesome combination.

Well, I cannot give my opinion on any other of the food items here because I only had that awesome pecan tart.  I can say that the bakery was very clean and organized.  The service provided by the woman who helped us was exemplary!  

I am absolutely a fan of their pecan tart.  I would have to try more of their items before deciding if they are worthy of 5 stars overall.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,1,1,4,sfHTQSx4dB8gPSX3tyl0gw
