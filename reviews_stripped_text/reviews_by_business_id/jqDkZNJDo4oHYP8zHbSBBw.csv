I was told by a friend that this company had the best prices (they do) and for what we paid we were treated like VIPs all the way. I hosted a bridal shower at Mandalay Bay and when Allan picked us up at a residence he suggested a Strip Tour along the way. He was very informative about Las Vegas and even stopped at Bellagio to take pictures at the fountain. My friends from Spain were very impressed and it was a great start of a great evening. The ride back was just as nice. Allan was right on time waiting and was even patient when some of my friends took a little longer to come out.
I will definitely use their service again.",A5bjxHV5FLLhggRDWiWxjQ,0,0,5,XBlTRMfGYx7cTNpbS_RWJQ
884854,2017-08-07,2,jqDkZNJDo4oHYP8zHbSBBw,"Terrible attitude for a business attempting to draw customers. Joseph was helpful and informative but Alan is a negative reflection on the company and a liability. He was extremely rude cutting me off in the middle of my inquiry for clarification of a false discount advertising, he was unprofessional and undeserving of your business. If you can reach Joseph get his personal contact info...I'd do business with him  anytime!",S4DIxyi2U8_f3AVm0FgM7g,3,1,1,rY3sd0tjoRVRLll-Db7dIQ
1177346,2016-09-13,0,jqDkZNJDo4oHYP8zHbSBBw,"I called numerous limo services for our las Vegas wedding. Finally found this limo service.  From the first phone call I was impressed. They were beyond knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable. We decided to hire them. We rented 3 limo's. 1 for groomsmen and 1 for bridesmaids for ride to wedding venue. 1 giant limo for all of us for ride back to hotel. They kept in contact. Let us know who are driver's were the day before. Absolute best prices. No hidden fee's. The limos were clean, stocked, and on time. The AC in one for bridesmaids wasn't working well but our driver tried super hard to take care of it. The limo ride back the driver played the perfect music for the kids in our group and we all rocked out! It made there whole weekend :) The drivers were so curious and good. Honestly can not say enough good things. Would highly recommend them and will use this service again!!!
The driver for ride back in giant limo even picked us up early no questions asked!",O53CvjZxXCphl7psjeTc-w,0,0,5,YzSjL2x1oLANfMcHmwkawQ

And I wasn't charged because they only took me down the street and back home because my guests and I were about to pass out! I never threatened anyone with anything. I don't need your money. Wasn't looking for a deal. Just wanted what I was paying for. But I know I'm not crazy because you guys have several bad reviews all with the same complaints. So screw you Lorey whoever you are. You were not there. And btw, u also didn't ask you to refund the $300 deposit that I lost on our Spa treatments. All of this on my Birthday???? And you're talking about an aggressive tone of voice!! Go to hell!",1nvX6QJBsSgi-xqqNLJiSQ,3,2,1,0PA-m-Z1Mr4NLUoAZygKCg
2749095,2016-08-30,2,jqDkZNJDo4oHYP8zHbSBBw,"Talked with Alan from Exotic and told him our plan for a Limo. He explained that the trip would be $100 from my house to downtown Las Vegas (about 15 - 20 minutes tops) for my daughter's birthday. I told Alan that I wanted to purchase the $120 voucher for $75 on the Yelp website, He told me that the voucher was only good if you are using it for a round trip ride or two trips. That information is nowhere to be found and he started verbally abusing and chastising me because I objected to their terms.  They also don't answer their phone and I had to leave a message for them to call me back. Must be a very small operation as this is only their 3rd review. We use Limos frequently for business and on special occasions and I will make sure to not refer any people to them.",F9hdVYNQhLrQk5qmkq4syg,3,1,1,wqq_dHjYnpz2cMkOEMVGqw
4083885,2018-04-24,1,jqDkZNJDo4oHYP8zHbSBBw,"For our upcoming prom night, my group and I called to reserve a party bus. The guy who helped us out over the phone was very kind and informative and offered us a good deal. I believe his name was Alan.

On the day of prom, the driver of the party bus greeted us well and arrived on time. However, once I handed him the required payment, he additionally asked for tips. Why should we be required to give tips before receiving the actual service? In addition, the driver did not seem to understand that the website merely asked for ""suggested tips"" and he demanded we give him $60 in tips before boarding the bus. He called his boss and we had to have him explain to the driver. We were all delayed and had to wait for the phone call to finish before we could finally board the bus and head to the venue.

Once we arrived at the venue, the driver didn't drive up to the main entrance and instead forced us to walk over to the door. When picking us up later that night, the driver was on time but he again parked the party bus too far away from the main entrance. We had to call him to drive over, and at first, he refused and demanded we walk over. It shouldn't be necessary for us to walk a distance away if the party bus is able to park closer to accommodate us.

Upon boarding the bus, the driver greeted us with a frown and rude attitude. It was hard to have a good time on the way back.. He killed our vibe and ruined our atmosphere. So, we decided to give him $40 instead of the suggested $60 in tips. When the driver noticed this, he stopped us from leaving while some of us were already half way to our cars, including me. The driver then ran towards me, yelling, ""You only gave me $40!! Why?!"" He was threatening and clenching his fists like he wanted to fight me. He claimed $60 gratuity was the required amount... He still didn't seem to understand what ""suggested"" meant. And keep in mind, he was arguing with high school students.

This entire experience with such a rude and aggressive driver ruined our night. As seniors, we wanted to make our last prom dance a memorable night, but the driver made it a bad memory. Would I recommend this company? I'd rather not, but if they got a new driver, I would reconsider. The one star is for the initial man on the phone who gave us a good deal. Nothing else.",OrIRVve08AYCHrJMmUXQjQ,9,2,1,632zp4WqqyJ0qyQFB6h65g
5362457,2016-05-28,0,jqDkZNJDo4oHYP8zHbSBBw,"Traveled to Las Vegas to spend some time with the in law family, and have an overall, toned down, Vegas experience. With this in mind we hoped for a glamour stroll via the strip.
Got a hold of this service from craigslist, called around a couple of places and decided to give them a call. They were very upfront with the prices and did not deviate at all from what was agreed, a practice somewhat lost in these areas. Also the add-ons  agreed with the prices as well. They arrived on time and even called ahead, as if they knew, asking if we wanted to start a bit late in case of any delays in our part. We requested an additional half an hour. Allan arrived exactly when he said he would, with a great ride. He had a very clean and stocked vehicle. With all the amenities that you would require of a glamour limo. Took us on a great tour of the city, while always maintaining a great disposition with all, very courteous and attentive to my wife's family, for sure owe him some browny points. Will definitely recommend his services to any one else in Vegas looking to have a great limo experience or just looking to getting around in style. Thank you very much for your services Allan, I expect to see you next time we are in town. A bit more rowdy though.",2o5HaFpQoI896m64tT_cyQ,1,0,5,GiGBycPuKCaSCtQ9UpLAMA
