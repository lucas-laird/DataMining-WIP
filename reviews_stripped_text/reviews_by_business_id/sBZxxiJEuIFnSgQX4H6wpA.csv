my sons football team. They prepared 75 Subway To Go boxes and clearly marked what type of sandwiches were in each box. They were made fresh and ready on time. When I picked up the order, the restaurant was clean and decorated cute for Halloween. I will definitely use this location again!!!",X_9070tJ9efb7kYMFnwZaw,0,0,5,7Ct2rJoPNIAKuNwHL8mfFQ

Even though they know the offer is going on, they have no bread left, except, whole wheat and a few cheese bread. Duh! You should have had plenty made for this promo. The franchise owner is no where to be found. Maybe Mr Babcock needs to get behind the counter and do some work. The employees were overwhelmed. They had this deer in the headlights, spaced out look on their faces. Many people like myself, just walked out. Mr Babcock, epic fail!",wJVC3-1FPyMIidaD4tVPdA,0,0,1,TZVqF5wbVG8ng5upCPS4Tg

While the place is clean and the employees are nice, it is way slower to get a sandwich made here.

I recommend the Subway in the Walmart Shopping Center or the one next to Fresh & Easy on Durango and Tropicana.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,0,2,PtHhBBwNs_CDRw-rEqAusQ

If I'm the only customer there it shouldn't take 15 minutes to make a cold sub. This place takes the ""fast"" out of ""fast food.""",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,0,2,6qyhqIiPhvl3-K05puvZiA
