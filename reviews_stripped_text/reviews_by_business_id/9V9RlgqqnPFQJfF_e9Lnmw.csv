26259,2011-05-24,1,9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw,"The banner advertising ""Gourmet Chinese Food"" could not be further from the truth.  I'm shocked that this place has more than 3 stars and isn't out of business yet.  I understand the whole American Chinese food thing and I know we're lacking in great local Chinese food spots... but I'd avoid this place at all costs.  The food was very bland and- more importantly- every dish we ordered came out sitting in a pool of grease.  I have never had pizza this greasy, let alone Chinese food.  I am talking inedible amounts of oil covering the shrimp, noodles, etc.  Even more disturbing was the fact that multiple people working here were coughing and sneezing, including the lady at the front handling takeout orders (who failed to cover her mouth and was sneezing throughout the course of our meal).  Made me wish I worked for the health department.  This restaurant is disgusting, the only reason I don't give it one star is because I didn't get shot or die after eating the food here (meaning I suppose, potentially, it COULD have been worse).  Anyway, the point is I'd never come back.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,0,2,lfOThVutIjuEW1bE0xKHNQ

445689,2015-09-24,0,9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw,"My fiancé and I have frequented Baidu for a few months now. We have always enjoyed our experience in the restaurant and the food was always good. 

Why I give it a 3 is the lack of consistency. I absolutely loved their fried rice because it was always simple rice with egg and green onions. So I was saddened today when we ordered it and it had different ingredients, carrots and peas and no onion. This may seem like a small thing, but when I order the exact same thing a few weeks apart, I expect them to be the same dish, or I probably wouldn't have ordered it in the first place. 

My other negative comment about Baidu is that their delivery drivers are a bit pushy when it comes to tips. One of them even came back to the door when my fiancé didn't leave a tip on our card (he was unaware that I hadn't added it to our delivery order already). I kid you not, he signed the CC receipt, closed the door, we sat down to eat and this man came back demanding a tip because he ""drove very far"" to deliver our food, we live no more than 4 miles from the restaurant. Now, had my fiancé known I forgot to attach it, he would have given him cash, but for him to come back and demand it from us was just very off putting and we most likely won't order again from Baidu.",MWct0uJTnIiFYhLpXLj1_A,0,0,3,_b_qWTdkbjHlux3YIip0-Q

Scallion cakes used to be my favorite but now they're super greasy. The minced shrimp lettuce wraps used to be light and super flavorful. Now they're drowned in sauce and barely palatable. Fried wontons are also way greasier than food should be 

The only thing I still enjoy is their Singapore noodles. Although their medium heat is pretty mild. Orange chicken is decent but nothing amazing.

1098542,2014-02-14,0,9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw,"What I had: Potato Beef lunch special w/ chow mien noodles and a spring roll
TOTAL: $6.76 w/ tax and water

So, I popped into this place for a quick bite and to be honest with you, that's all this place is good for: a cheap, quick bite

I ordered the potato beef lunch special... they gave me water with it... but never even OFFERED to take my drink order... which might be a good thing because they don't actually have a soda machine. They have a cooler with canned sodas in it. It really irks me when restaurants do this and always brings questions to mind like: (1) You can afford to run a restaurant but can't afford a soda machine? (2) If I wanted a canned soda, I'd just drink that at home... or in THIS place's case, just (literally) walk to the pharmacy 10 feet away and buy one for cheaper...

OK, back to the potato beef. I ordered this hoping it would be ""stew-like""... like the filipinos make which is one of my favorite dishes... IT WAS NOT... This was more like Mongolian (style) beef with some potato slices thrown in... the potatoes were cut crinkle/zucchini style... cheap flavors and nothing to write home about.

The free spring roll that came with it was probably that pre-made crap from the grocery store... which I'm beginning to suspect ALL their ingredients come from the Wal-Mart or Smith's nearby. I suspect this because this place is right next to a cool butcher shop... but when I asked the manager if they got their meat from the butcher next door, he said ""No, we get it from another store"".... he specifically said STORE... not a meat packaging or distribution place like the GOOD Chinese restaurants do.

The free appetizer with the lunch special was ""corn egg soup""... they literally called it that... I've always heard it called egg drop soup... this one was pretty bland with no green onions added... and it seemed to be much thicker than what other Chinese restaurants have.

Overall, the entire meal was BLAND... despite how cheap it is, I would suggest someone go to Panda Express if they're looking to go the cheap route... but if you want some REALLY TASTY Chinese food... in bigger portions... check out China-A-Go-Go (multiple locations) or China Tango Bistro (in Green Valley)",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,0,0,3,-32OBkz4xDYlZ9_VPOwOfg

Our dishes looked exactly the same and tasted exactly the same even though we ordered two different dishes. He at least got some green onions in his. Neither one of us could eat more than 3 bites and it went into the trash. I hate wasting food but it just wasn't good and I didn't feel comfortable eating it.

1635319,2018-01-13,1,9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw,"Chinese food is easily my favorite. When I moved out to Vegas, there weren't all that many options as far as delivery is concerned. Baidu was decent but far from being actually good, but it had 1 thing that the other places didn't: steamed meat dumplings.

The steamed meat dumplings are my favorite and theirs were above average. For years I would continue to order regularly mostly to get the dumplings despite the lower quality to the many other Chinese delivery options that have since opened up near me.

As time went by, I ordered more infrequently as ordering solely for the one dish wasn't what I wanted to do and getting higher quality proteins and vegetables from other places was preferable, but I would still order for the steamed dumplings from time to time.

Tonight I ordered and the food was particularly below average. They forgot the sauce in a dish where that is critical to it being edible. But the real reason I'm finally writing this review and why I won't be ordering again: the steamed meat dumplings are no longer ""real"". They actually served me the same frozen crap you can buy at any Albertson's and microwave yourself.

I have no reason to come back for far below average food and fake dumplings. Thanks for the memories.",noZoIj8rHPHsNzMsn1HojA,2,0,2,i7NAs7fsCsyl-3k5MrV4PQ

I wasn't in the mood to drive all over town in search for some good take-out, so I narrowed the search down to restaurants that delivered. After perusing some menus, I decided on Baidu. I called and had a little difficulty understanding the guy on the other end of the phone, but after some repeating I got my order in. He quoted me a 35 min wait time. Sure enough, 30 minutes later there was a knock on my door and my food was waiting. 

The food was delicious and exactly what I was craving! Not to mention, the price was reasonable. If you live within a 3 mile radius the delivery charge is just $2. Anything over that mileage and it's an extra buck. We were right on the cusp of that, but they ended up just charging me $2.

Food: The Singapore Mei Fun was great, as were the Chicken w/Garlic Sauce and the wildcard: a 1/2 order Orange Chicken Combo Special (6.95 and the size of a full order at any other Chinese restaurant) which comes with broccoli, a spring roll and your choice of rice. Brown rice is available for an extra $1. 

Service: Absolutely everyone I've interacted with at this restaurant is really cheerful and helpful, the waitstaff filled our water glasses at least 5 times over the course of our last lunch there - not so much because we were parched, but because our glasses were 2/3rds full of ice. They could make their job easier by putting less ice in their water glasses but they choose not to cut that corner and for that reason I think service at Baidu China Bistro is exceptional. 5 stars for service.

I call up there and tell them I will return their rice and I need a refund as they could have killed someone as they have me on hold I look at the Mongolian beef and break a piece off but it was to gummy to tear because it too was raw!!!!

She told me to keep everything and she was calling eats24 to refund me. We hang up and throw EVERYTHING in the garage can outside. 

She then calls me back to tell me ""never mind I need you to bring the food back"" by this point I'm furious. I explained it's in the trash and I asked you and you said no!

I was simple and ordered the shrimp tempura my associate ordered the lettuce wraps which were to die for and than we ordered the orange chicken with a side of rice which was also to die for because not everyone rice is good, so after its all said and done my experience was good!!!",nnVfZdA0wWpxQaywgUqMKQ,1,0,4,vGwFVOvEdPIG3qt9QEkfWw

My 8 year old ordered a cup of soup which was no ordinary cup. It was more like bowl lol. I ordered orange chicken, beef and broccoli, combo fried rice, combo chow mein. Orange chicken was off the hook! Cooked perfectly. Beef and broccoli was so much beef. That's the way beef and broccoli should be made. The rice and noodles were deviously! We even ordered another combo rice to take home. We couldn't finish all of our. The older gentleman packed everyone's food up and bagged it. He even added more broth to my daughter's soup because she drank it all (for free). For being an old guy, he was on top of everything! Never had to ask for a refill. Our glasses were always full.

My order was beyond simple: American broccoli in a spicy garlic sauce, and it was just what I expected. I also had a couple of bites of my husband's Orange chicken. The pieces were large and perfectly fried, and I thought the sauce was really good. It wasn't overly sweet or some insane shade of incomprehensible orange. It tasted as if someone had put some thought into its creation. On a previous occasion I had a couple of bites of mei fun, and that was also executed well. They offer brown rice, always a bonus in my book. If we are nearby and hungry, I would go back.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,4,3,yDj8T4SOuhCTTD_EulLUtw

Don't let the trendy look fool you, there is a cook in the back that knows whats what. We both like spicy food and asked for hot sauce, we were not disappointed.
I would definitely go back if I was in the area.",-eVBjD2-3MJzIyJwwtcGsg,1,1,4,UUPJFS2-OrFl760u4g4H6w
5252531,2015-05-16,0,9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw,Super friendly service. Not sure if this is family business but it feels like it. Very nice menu. I had the Wor Won Ton Soup. It was HOT fresh veggies and very low in oil. The chicken broth was lovely. Unfortunately it was just a bit lacking in flavor. Perhaps a bit of herb or onion. I felt the won tons were a bit underdone. I also wish they would use a nicer mushroom. Somehow those button mushrooms are just too bland. I would return and try another dish.,KjdNJS5kFjUOgDCk0P2sEg,0,0,4,4DEV5JwdAAZP7bj-axIr0Q

It used to be so fresh and nonrant.-greasy, and now it is more bland and definitely tastes reheated and not fresh. I always order the same or similar dishes and could really tell the difference the last two times I ordered--I really do hope that Baidu goes back to its old freshness standard or else I will have to start looking for a different neighborhood, local Chinese restaurant.",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,1,1,3,PUv9NOyaLmR3Y17-kE-aoA

The beef was tender but the sauce they had it in was way too salty, tasted like they dumped beef bullion on it. The General Chicken was dry and the sauce had no heat  and we asked for medium heat thinking we're playing it safe in either direction. The steamed rice was fine. I also got some Tempura Shrimp, tasted a bit of old oil and the batter was way too thick.

5499059,2012-05-12,0,9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw,"I always order the same thing at Baidu, so take that into account with this review.

But my usual order is delicious, and just as importantly for a Chinese restaurant, consistent.

Their scallion pancake is a stellar appetizer, a Szechwan specialty that can be challenging to find in Vegas. Thin pastry layers have green onion flattened in between them. It's maybe more of a frybread texture than a flapjack. It's served with a soy ginger dipping sauce that's best used sparingly.

Pork fried rice is my favorite Chinese dish. I know that's not very adventurous, but I don't care. Good pork fried rice is one of life's simple pleasures. Baidu's is, for starters, served in portions that strain the sides and top of the to-go cartons. The pork is mostly lean and a rich red color from the BBQ treatment. The vegetables are cooked to tenderness, like in a pilaf. The rice is just the right mix of fried and moist, with enough seasoning that you don't need to add soy, I find it well complemented by the searing hot mustard available on request.

My new go-to for Chinese.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,1,4,vsig7GKnXsG_j0YxmZZmvg
5550017,2011-01-25,1,9V9RlgqqnPFQJfF_e9Lnmw,"I find Chinese delivery food to be universally bad or mediocre at best no matter where I live.  However, I keep ordering it, mainly that I find it to be somewhat like comfort food.  Even when it's not that great it is still good at times.  Lately, since my food poisoning scare with my delivery food from Thai House Restaurant , I've practically stopped ordering Asian food all together.  

I recently, had that ""comfort food"" longing within me and decided to give this place a try after moving to this area last month, encouraged by the reviews that said the food was fresh.  I was delighted that for once the food was indeed fresh, with the vegetables in the Shrimp and Vegetable dish most notably cooked perfectly and not mushy or greasy.  They had brown rice options, and the fried rice was spectacular.  The orange chicken was the most memorable I have had out of the Chinese delivery restaurants I have ordered from.

So this has quickly become my favorite Chinese Delivery restaurant in Las Vegas, and probably the only place I will order from while I live in this area.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,4,1,4,57QwBSXXw-kC43cvsf912A
