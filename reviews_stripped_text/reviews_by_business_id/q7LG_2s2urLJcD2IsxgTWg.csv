The cashier didn't seem like she understands english and Manager started to speak spanish in front of me and finaly gave me coffee with cream. I told the manager I ordered medium size black ice coffee with large cup with extra water and ice. The manager was extremely rude and said it is impossible to give me with it. Everytime I go there, I always order medium black coffe in large cup w extra ice and water. It is impossible. I will never be back!! Thats way McDonald is going down!! Employees need to speak English, not Spanish in front of customers.",9sGuuxfg-QyMpjoh0SlQuA,0,0,1,TA9-SFAj6UgZ9qZoBg5log

They are at work and they should be talking in English in front of customers. This is very rude.,hj0b4V-U-FSKMyewo_B8-g,0,0,3,VYiOcBR0RxCD4B3FGZZlaw

One cashier for a line of 4 + customers, open a line, help that poor kid out! Don't waste your time here, wish I could give it neg stars.",_UsSJFj7phfzoKQfzbnV6A,2,1,1,C9WkNVit1DogTSYgsMFByQ

So, every morning I get before the 10am mark.. I like to grab my number 2. The sausage egg Mcmuffin. I always like to add strawberry jam to it. But here's why I only gave em 4 stars.. They're so tight fisted with their jam. Like they only have 6 left and they gotta store the rest up for the summer or something.",KyieFxrQxDx6ncUVLaCPAQ,1,0,4,gAWdlGxM47E9iOII4XDI2w

I asked for water because our bill was a little higher than expected and on my bill she charged me two dollars for Coke. So I went back to show her what I thought was her mistake ,we didn't order coke  just wanted the free water she said that's how much they charge that there is no free water at McDonald's. For that reason alone I will never go to this location.",aPkFbCC9lCZsJoLaNeTY7A,0,0,1,otPTHp7bKpjaZ5HlEtH3kA

Service is so crucial and I'm not sure that anybody has either taught or cared to hold the employee's here accountable to that! I don't eat McDonald's a lot but when I do I don't expect much, but what I do expect is fast and efficient! That is what they pride themselves around right? Not so much... I pulled up at the drive thru and sat there for over 5 minutes and finally pulled up to the first window to only find this kid texting on his phone. Go figure... He said ""oh I'm sorry"" what's your order? Yikes.. I ordered at the window and pulled forward to only have to be then parked for my food when there was nobody in front of me. I'm not complaining at all about receiving my fresh fish of fillet's but for them to not be busy and all this time that was unnecessary time spent was ridiculous!

They completely redesigned the interior and they have all new staff in the morning and afternoon shifts.   They have a play area and there's a Redbox outside as well.,KIss0NROnhtSaxi3yU91FA,0,0,5,KPqwWT7pLlKzGp_V_iFo6Q

My issue this evening was at the drive thru. I ordered a McGriddle with egg and cheese and WITHOUT MEAT. I had to repeat it to the cashier three times. When I got to the window to pay for my food, she asked me again. I picked up my order at the window and went home. Opened up the paper and there was a bun and cheese! Drove back to McD's with the sandwich and talked to the Manager, told him what I ordered and showed him what I got. So, I proceed to order a McGriddle with egg and cheese, NO MEAT! He say's, McGriddle with cheese. Um, no! When he finally figured out what I wanted, I told him to give me two and I will not pay for the extra one. They got it wrong the first, second, third, fourth and fifth time. I don't know what happened to the really nice Manager and crew that were there before, I won't be returning to this McD's again! I will drive to the one at Jones and Trop.",i5MlesN2FAeZjR9ECjISPA,0,0,2,XEJOX1UvEhRZaRmwGuhbSQ

They are all really friendly which makes this place awesome because a lot of fast food places the staff can be mean...
