Prepared oysters on the half shell with onion, tomatoe, and shrimp salsa and an avocado strip.  Don't miss the shrimp empanadas.  Plato with bistec, shrimp supreme 3, and thre shrimp aka Diablo were marvelous.  Karla, our server, was one of the most polite, informative, knowledgable we have had in a long while.  Her smile is infectious.  All in all a very good first experience, we will be back!",QevYjxVahffbvVM53g9a0w,0,0,5,JFe46JXy4cLEPgZTbqfKzQ

2045515,2017-01-26,0,KBA0yGsblufetQgs6Sm_nQ,"This restaurant was more like 4-1/2 stars. Really good seafood, very flavorful and fresh, served in a no-frills eastside downtown location. Loved the aguachiles shrimp, the carne asada, the molcajetes and the fish tacos too. The fried fish has this really crispy but thin coating that is just the best! I am used to cabbage with fish tacos, so the lettuce they came with was a bit weird, but maybe that's a regional preference? The mango chela and micheladas were great; as was their Jamaica, which was tart, fresh-tasting, very cold...delicious!
The salsas are excellent, and the tortillas were fresh. But we didn't eat much of the beans that came with the meals...they had no taste at all. 
The only thing we kinda regretted ordering was the fried ice cream. It was frozen much too hard (in my experience, fried ice cream is frozen hard, THEN put into a deep fryer for a just a bit, before serving it, to soften it and crisp up the coating); and it was not served in the ""cone bowl"" as earlier reviews had pictured it. 
Stick with the seafood and you'll have a tasty meal!! And the owner is super-nice :-)",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,0,0,4,5_lle6dTRwFkhnJEca-6Ow

2334089,2015-03-14,0,KBA0yGsblufetQgs6Sm_nQ,Growing up in a Mexican family it is not very often you find a Mexican restaurant that lives up to your expectations. That being said 7 mares did and exceeded my lofty expectations. The food is prepared in a very traditional Mexican manner and the quality of the fish was great! Bundle it up with great service and an attentive staff and it's almost as great as my grandmother's house. I would recommend getting a variety of plates and sharing. The molcajetes and camarones a la diabla were my personal favorites!,9yfqfIJXg7zVQ9819EM0YA,0,0,5,QF3FnJ7inf9yilzp9-XurA

It's spicy so be careful!  The Jamaica is delicious! Tart sweet and fresh! Ice cold Pacifico complimented the meal too!  Friday Saturday and Sundays they have karaoke!  It's so much fun to watch! 
The only thing i can complain about is service. We were greeted by an older woman very sweet. Our waitress was rude from the drink order and beyond. She asked us if we were okay about 5 times in a 15min frame and every time it seemed like the frown was more and more frowny. It took her even longer to bring the bill.

I had the shrimp quesadilla and it is way better than Lindo Michocan. The parillada is really good too and it's worth the money believe me.
