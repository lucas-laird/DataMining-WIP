First of all, the place is clean... very clean. Compared to other Hawaiian food chains/places I've been to, this is by far the cleanest & has a very updated style (which is probably due to the location). Right when you walk in the cashier is smiling and welcomes you, gotta love feeling welcome. The usual plates and combos for a 

Here's what we ordered:

Mini Fried Shrimp (5/5) - Plain and simple, but very good. One scoop of rice, one scoop of mac salad, and a good amount of BIG ASS BREADED FRIED SHRIMP! Please don't be fooled, I'm pretty certain the shrimp is prepared fresh in house. It's not that lame frozen kind that others claim is fresh. Also comes with a very flavorful tartar sauce, I think they add a little mustard in it. SO good with the shrimp.

Shrimp Chow Fun (5/5) - I LOVE flat noodles, so chow fun is always a plus in my book. A big portion of noodles tossed with onions, bean sprouts, green onions & shrimp. The shrimp was also seasoned perfectly, it wasn't bland at all. Very good flavors!

I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Can't wait to try the other food here, they also have milk teas! Not your average Hawaiian chain, lots to pick from. Swing by & check it out, you won't be sorry! :-)",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,0,0,5,mq2GHbS02O-tZiCrT05qMw
1280001,2017-11-27,5,_gMR_YdsMwwKy63-UwjdnA,"Huh. It is Hawaiian BBQ, Las Vegas edition but to me it was pretty average. I wasn't expecting hula dancers and fire eaters to come out but what I ate was pretty A-OK. I ordered the Spam Misubi, which I will admit was pretty good. My main entre was the BBQ Beef bowl that in my opinion had way too much rice and I did pick through the vegetables. I know, I am Filipina but I am a weird one because I don't eat a lot of white rice. I am sure the amount of rice served is standard but it didn't meet my preference.

I will say that the service was fast and friendly. The restaurant is clean and pretty sleek. The prices were right on the nose with Hawaiian  BBQ in Vegas but what I ordered just did not WOW me. I am in the critical stages of trying to find a Hawaiian BBQ in my hood, so I will go back in, try something different and hopefully find it delightful enough to keep going back.",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,5,7,3,MelKZnPD2wug-FB5gR0JUQ

You have 2 options which is funny and cool at the same time. . . so your entrance will be 1st Ohana BBQ which then gives you the option to eat there which is like any other fast food sit in but with more comfortable seating and you get a charging station at your table which is sooo awesome because you can charge your phone, laptops etc. . . so if you dont want to sit there then theres your 2nd option which is pretty cool too and is another room next door with different menu like chinese and more restaurant feel and you get a waitress and all that good stuffs. what makes it great is that say you want to try the restaurant option you may still order from the Hawaiian selections and that means your group or partner doesn't have to be split and can enjoy a meal together.",9poAce4B7L8ixuV3O_6XyQ,1,0,5,TJuOmzPpRT1pBT24NorDdw

The restaurant is clean, modern and they have phone outlet chargers throughout (which is a cool touch).

My favorite menu items include the cake noodles, stir fried udon, hamburger steak and Korean pork belly buns. 

The saimin is your typical saimin, although I wish it had a little more spam (comes with 1 piece, cut into 4 strips).

I went for the Chinese menu.  I know it is Hawaiian food here but I actually prefer this over the other casual Chinese options.   Salt and pepper shrimp!  Yumm!   And just around $10 comes with rice.  Really hit the spot.  Will frequent this restaurant often.

The food was awesome. Chicken Katsu really the only thing get for the most part or my favorite. I like about the Ohana Hawaiian BBQ style is the chicken pounded out thin, really nice even coating of panko, and perfect golden brown color crust. The katsu sauce admit tend like other local spots but it still solid and enjoy it. I feel like it not as thick as other spots. The portion size is HUGE. The amount of chicken get for regular is more like two meals for the price of one. I rarely eat the whole portion unless starving. The menu enjoy they had more diversity then the other location.  They have whole section of boba drinks on the menu. I never ordered one but saw someone else and it looked good. Might have try some next visit. I like menu interactive type with pictures and rolls over showing more menu items. Different. 

Really the best thing about this location compare to other one been to off Durango. I believe they have couple more locations (never been). This location is got brand new vibe, new building, and great spot to chill while having some local food. They have lot more seating then the other location. They have lot of booths, and tables. The high ceiling, very open feel, and the decor ESPECIALLY with the huge spam logo  plus the 808. Local style on point! They have two huge wide screens on both side right in the middle. I just happen to go for lunch during playoff action. It felt like chilling at home all relax with local food and football. The staff is five stars for sure.

   The inside is very clean & service is good. I did have issues on separate occasions with quality, taste & packaging. 
   They quality of their Lau Lau was bad the first time, then I tried once more hoping it would taste better, but it wasn't :( 
   The taste of most of their food is good but nothing that really wows you, kind of basic but not in a bad way. One time we ordered food for home & didn't get our sauces for katsu & extra sauces we.requested on the side. It was really disappointing that we didn't have the sauces because it did need it to boost the flavors and we'll, pretty mandatory for certain dishes. 
   I was border line on giving 4 stars but when you have a dish on the menu that really tastes bad, most likely frozen store bought, you lose a lot of credibility for being a restaurant. Even if it is a faster pace type of dining, there's plenty of down time to have your cooks create recipes from scratch. If there is no down time, then your business is doing well and you can hire an extra cook to assist with making fresh quality dishes. I don't see any room for excuses on this subject
    Hope this rating was fair and I do intend on eating here again in a couple weeks. Id like to try more dishes to give this place more opportunities for an extra star or maybe 2 :)",G-lXqfGcJDRmi2iUXuj8Bw,0,0,4,xUWuudxK5zn_0uI7h7-n2A

We ordered:
- Seafood and BBQ Combo
- BBQ Mix Combo
- Chicken Katsu

Food came out in a timely manner we were a large group and all ordered separately. Milk tea was dropped off and I told them as more food was coming out, that we are missing a Thai tea. Took two different people to finally get the boba to the table. Then a third person came afterwards and asked if we got our Thai tea yet. Could use some better communication there.

Food wise, all their portions are extremely large and can probably be 1.5 - 2 meals. I got the Kalua Pork and it was alright. There was a lot of pork but the flavor wasn't there. Their mac salad is typical of most Hawaiian places. I sampled a bunch of other dishes from my friends. Their katsu was OK. It could use more seasoning, but dipping it in sauce solves a lot of things.

The katsu and macaroni salad are seriously bland, they could both use more flavor - not more salt but some actual spices in the dressing and breading. The katsu is white meat trimmed of fat, which is fine, but then you need something in there to flavor it up. The food seemed all fresh and the frying fat drained off, so nothing was soggy.

Malasadas were fine, drained okay, maybe a little bigger than average.  I would like to be able to make a half-order of those.  It was busy, but I did have to wait quite a while for my carryout order.  Eat24 was down for some reason, so I ordered when I got there.",0DGh3LaLFDDES3OtOqGq1w,0,0,3,QUmvM3cdQndcX0Shkd7msQ

This location is a lot nicer than the one on Eastern/Warm Springs, which makes sense because this is the newest location. As a small bonus, there's usually sports playing on the TVs.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,1,0,5,Fh9CeKqKczbMG1GuUAKzMg

I had to knock off two stars because it was grand opening week... If you buy one boba you get another one free for checking in on yelp. So I bought one Thai tea boba and I wanted to get the taro for free. They said taro was not one of the options and that anything else is free. So I told her if I can buy the taro and get the Thai tea for free and she said they couldn't do it because they were limited on taro so they couldn't do it on the special deal. If it's grand opening week and you're trying to gain more customers. I would expect them to honor it regardless if you were limited. At least let me BUY the taro and get the Thai tea for free. It's better to give it to a happy customer instead of saving taro because it's ""limited"". Like why are you saving taro? The point is to sell the food/drink. Not save it. First come, first serve. Then you can tell your customers you're all out.",omzK_8C8RdZoulHbC8t3Ug,9,5,3,61P5wJ2JJSX4KGdsF54E7w

I don't usually go to Ohana because I'm not a fan of Hawaiian styled food. I actually only come here if I want some wonton noodle soup. But when you order it, be sure to use the wording they have on their menu. Apparently the cashier can get easily confused. 

They give you a good amount of wontons with the dish ... I think like 8 of them. Each wonton is filled with shrimp goodness. I would actually prefer if there was more pork in there but that is fine. I usually take it to go because I like the chili oil I have at home :D I use a generous spoonful of chili oil and it tastes amazing! Their noodles are cooked perfectly with the right amount of firmness and chew! 

Perfect place for some wonton noodle soup. I don't have to trek over to Chinatown for the dishes.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,0,0,4,xXL9uT3FRyeHtGS8CJanuw

I like my pork chops extra extra crispy and this place delivers that crunch! I've been here 4 times now with various coworkers and haven't heard one complaint. It's nice to have a choice of Chinese food or traditional Hawaiian food for those with picky friends like mine. There's something for everyone! The chicken katsu is a favorite as well. I've also tried the chicken cake noodle (for the first time) and it reminded me of Hong Kong pan fried noodles with an emphasis on meat and less veggies. The portions are huge and always more than enough for one meal.the ladies who work here are so friendly and accommodating. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because the air conditioning has been awful the last two times I've been there. I mean, I could feel it on but everyone in my group was sweating and fanning in between bites.

The ONLY part I do complain about and I wish management would take note is that whenever I order saimin or anything that does have soup DINING IN, they always pack it on a TO GO with styrofoam and all. I'm not a full on-go green-tree hugger but I REALLY WISH I could eat my soup without having to pour it on the noodles. I feel it's wasteful use of styrofoam. I've ordered saimin and the wonton noodle soup a few times and it always comes in like this. When they improve it I'll bump it up to a 5 star.

Ordered a regular BBQ chicken with a side of extra macaroni. The extra side of macaroni came in a bigger container but when I opened it the macaroni looked like it was just a small spoonful which was disappointing. 

The BBQ chicken portion was on the smaller side and I thought it would be bigger since I opted for the regular size. The BBQ chicken wasn't the best I've had. It was just okay.
