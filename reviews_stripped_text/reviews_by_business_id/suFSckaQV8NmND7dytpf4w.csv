Went to wash hands. There was no soap and no toilet paper in the restroom. The food was served without utensils. The food was okay but not adequate for the price. After we had finished dinner, we were given the check with wrong pricing. Gratuity was added on the bill for four.

468836,2015-08-04,1,suFSckaQV8NmND7dytpf4w,"Visited this place during 8/1/15 - 8/2/15 

I just hope the owner reads this and learn a lesson or two. 

Here are some negative points. 

- Bad BAD customer service 
- Quality is not maintianed
- Drinks are supposedly self service 
- No plates offered
- No Sauce offered
- No Utensils offered
and SO much more! 

LEARN THIS !

- Welcome your guests with a freaking SMILE!
- Before the food arrives - Serve plates and utensils
- Keep smiling if customer is re ordering even if its near closing hours. YOU ARE SUPPOSE to serve them until you close ! OTHERWISE PUT A NOTICE. 
- wash your dishes properly!
- IF A CUSTOMER WANTS TO SPLIT THE PAYMENT BETWEEN CC and CASH, ACCEPT IT! we are in 2015 not 1915 ! 

This is going to be a LONG review to please bare with me if you care or else dont!

Here's a little background - I visited this place with my friends back in April. As we were exhausted, I didn't really pay attention to the details. Food was great (especially BEHARI Kabab) loved it. 

Now to the recent experience. 

Went to Vegas from LA with my buddies. The entire time I kept bragging about this place to my friends and how this place has most amazing behari kababs ever. 

Yelp states that they close at 11 Pm. - I called them at 10:05 and spoke to a nice gentleman who said yes we are open till 11 pm. I repeatedly asked him if they could serve us Behari kebabs in specific. He obliged and said YES (REPEATEDLY). We left our hotel and while on the way, I called again just to make sure. He then again said YES (REPEATEDLY). I was well satisfied and was looking forward to it. 

10:30 - We got seated. 
The host gave us 4 Menus and said ""we can only serve chicken biryani, chicken karahi, and any of the burgers"" 
My reply: I just spoke to someone and asked specifically about the behari kababs. 
Host: NO
My reply: I called twice!
Host: Let me check *he goes back in the kitchen and checks for god knows what*
Host: Ok yes, if you had ordered us then we coould have made it but sorry we cant now.
My reply: What are you talking about ? I just spoke to him 10 mins ago How can he not make it now? 
Host: Yea he cant.

I was so frustrated at his blunt  and not to courteous responses. I was about to stand up and leave. 

Somehow he put aside his ego and said ""ok we will serve you 1 plate of behari kabab' 
1 PLATE? LIKE I dont get it. but anyhow. I said ok and we ordered rest of the food from that 'restricted menu' 

ONLY reason this place gets a star from me is because of their taste. YES it tastes GOOD! No doubt about it. It is overpriced by a huge margin but arent they all? 

Next day - I decided to give them another try. This time, we went for Lunch. around 3 Pm. 

This experience was going to be rather worse, I would have not imagined it. 

I called in advance again and asked specifically about the behari kabab.
Host ""yes its available""
Me ""Can I place an order ? I'll be there in 15 mins""
Host: ""yes absolutely""
I ordered my food and got there in 20 mins. 

Host ""Yes your order is being made and should be out very soon""
Me ""Thank YOU!"" I was quite excited !

My order arrived 45 minutes AFTER I was seated. So 45 minutes plus the 30 mins advance notice I gave them. ARE YOU SERIOUS? They seriously tested our patience. FOOD WAS HORRIBLE - OVERCOOKED. 

Most terrible experience EVER!

The waitress would keep coming and tell us  5 minutes and the food still wouldn't come for over 15 mins. In total, we had been waiting for over an hour for a couple cheese burgers. When you're a family with a hungry baby and senior citizens, you NEED food to come out. In the end, the food was not very good. Nobody was happy with their dishes and we all left unhappy as we wasted about two hours at the restaurant. The only thing we liked was the Philly cheese steak.All in all, it was a bad experience. On a separate note, we were not welcomed into the restaurant, nor were we offered any drinks or menus until later. It is also probably important to note that we are usually not picky and critical about these things.


We later found out that there were only TWO people working in the entire restaurant, including the chef. Which is why everything was so slow. But why would a restaurant only have two employees???",OCgrQCi0l1Voa9ZHbbV8Ng,1,0,1,n_GzHLUWKLGbzim7vO0wiQ

That really was an excellent suggestion as both were amazing and incredibly flavorful.

I have been to the downtown location many times but this was my first time eating there since they moved to the new location.  I had the Chicken Gyro - no onions and my friend had the regular Gyro - no onions.  Both arrived with onions and hers had small black plastic in the food.  Not sure how she had plastic in her dish but that's definitely what it was. (Maybe a plastic bowl chipped?)  She is a pretty good sport so she sent it back for another gyro and the next one was plastic free.  The service was not great and the pricing has definitely increased since the last time I was there.  $12 for a chicken gyro w/fries and a can of soda is just way too much.

If I go into a restaurant and spend 40-60$ the least I can get is a cup of nice refreshing water with my meal but instead i have to continuously buy water bottles which are priced at 2$ a pop. I'd be more understanding if it was a fast food chain and its but your own water but the fact that this location should be more ""upscale"" would incline me to believe that I get a ice cold cup of water with my meal.

During lunch they offer a buffet, but during dinner hours, the main menu has a handful of Mediterranean dishes (falafel app, shawarma plates and pitas) but is mostly Indian dishes?

It was a challenge to order a basic Greek salad with protein, because there was a language barrier and the cashier was unfamiliar with the menu. Every question I asked, he would take to the kitchen staff for an answer, then come back still unable to answer my question.

My simple order for a Greek salad ($9 on menu, no description, apparently w/o protein?) plus lamb was rang up as a shawarma plate ($14) and all sides were substituted for the salad. No dressing, flatware, napkins, or pita were included with my takeout order. Tasted just fine but definitely overpriced.

This spot should consider a name change to reflect that the namesake kabobs and Mediterranean cuisine do not describe the  majority of the menu offerings.

It was super fresh with a base of curry and the chicken literally melted in my mouth! I was wondering if I have died and gone to Greek  heaven!!!  This was my first time in here but it will not be my last for sure.  I work right down the street from this place so now I will frequent it at least once or twice a week!!!  I think I want to try everything on the menu now ... and I probably will eventually!!!

But the main issue with this place is the wait time for the food . I came in right around 8:15  and was seated, I had the lamb shawarma plate. I didn't receive my food till 9:00. 45 min was way too much time, I only complained once though, and my food came out after that. But there were a lot of mad customers who were also waiting too long for their food and complaining. Time is money . As far as the food goes, the lamb shawarma was ok not great, pretty oily and kind of salty imo, rice was ok, and the ""house salad"" is just like two slice of a tomatoes a couple slivers of onions, on like 5 pieces of lettuce. The one star is for actually getting my food. 12.99 for the lamb shawarma I don't mind, but u get reemed on the can of Coke that is 2.50 yes a can not a fountain drink, that is what made me mad. Oh also watch out for the 15% gratuity that's automatically added to the bill. I woulda tipped more but hey they did it for me.

This time I was in Vegas, I saw online that they moved into a new location. I went there and was shocked. A Hispanic girl was serving and no sign of the old owners. I asked the server if they had a high chair for my toddler and she said they did but it was broken. May be I should have left at point but was too hungry and tired after driving over 600 miles that day. Things only went south from here. 

We saw the menu, and everything is severely overpriced. While were sitting, no water was served. My wife asked for water pointing at my toddler child, and the server brought in just one cup of water! Are you kidding? So we don't get water unless we specifically ask for it? I went to the restroom and there was no soap in the restroom! 

While ordering, I wanted the beef biryani but she said they didn't have that. Then I asked for the Bihari kabob and she said they didn't have it either. Majority of the items listed on the menu were not available. I don't recall if I ever went to a restaurant where they had a menu but the items on the menu were not available. She pointed me to only few items on the menu that were available. We finally ordered few items (not what we wanted) and sat there for a while. They finally served the food. The food was very bland and average - especially for the price. When we finally got our check, the check had more items than I actually ordered - the bill was much higher than what it would have been. I told the server about the issue and she then corrected the check. They added 18% gratuity on the bill and with the poor service I didn't want to pay any additional tip. When I gave her back the signed credit card receipt, she didn't look happy. I guess she expected additional tip in addition to the 18% gratuity. 

The old owners most likely have sold their business to someone else. The new owner has no idea how to run a business and employs servers with no training to run this place.

On my next visit I tried their Philly cheesesteak. It was every bit as good as the chicken burger. It was well flavored, the bread was fresh, and it was very filling. 

The third trip was all about the Cheeseburger. It was excellent as well. With all of the burger and gourmet burger spots in Las Vegas, I have yet to find a cheeseburger as tasty as this. It is better than Habit Grill, Bachi Burger and Guy Fieris.

The owner(young guy) is very attentive and friendly with the service. He recommended us some of the dishes which we loved it. Although the place is not that busy and you have to wait a little bit for your food to come, it's worth it. You will not be disappointed.

5056743,2016-06-15,0,suFSckaQV8NmND7dytpf4w,"This is essentially for east indians and Muslims and they really use that Mediterranean theme loosely.  The food isnt great but not bad.  There is heat in a majority of the recipes, which i have asked to be cut, but they cant.  The food is very much overpriced considering the cut of meat (bottom shelf) and the sides which seem to consist of lettuce and rice.  However, they do work that meat into magic and create a meal I would consider digestible and even tasty.  They seem to have a vision for this place, that just doesn't meet the level of product they are serving and really lack some basic expectations, when spending money in a business. I gave this business 3 stars because the times I have ordered, eating the food was a pleasant experience and I did enjoy it overall.  For the Muslims this is probably a place you would want to support but if you are looking for Mediterranean food, note to reader, you wont see one olive, spinach pie, grilled olive oil chicken, feta but there is a grilled pita that I enjoyed with a side of butter.",6djF-uggm1H_eYqmFIAPrA,0,0,3,N8VM1mtuv8zRMjjftyEILg

It doesn't look like much but the food is excellent; great quality and taste. We got the chicken boti and tikka beef, both lean and full of flavor with sides of rice, pita and salad. I would give them 5 stars, but for a place that also serves Indian food I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have more sauces (like raita or chutney) for their Naan. 
Would definitely come here again though!! Our waiter was super nice and welcoming.",uwRztPQeBI6G7yKvrYn4vw,0,0,4,TE6vv6woqQMBEM-nvk54tg

I only stopped in because the Chinese restaurant next door was closed.
I definitely didn't want a huge dinner plate so I ordered the beef kabob pita sandwich for 7.95(8.63 with tax).
Honestly...I rarely eat this style of food, so I'd say it was good. Not the best, but it had a nice flavor.
I think I should've tried something without all that pita bread. Maybe next time.",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,19,19,4,7M9VSSMbHe7PxHC2Jh-B4w
