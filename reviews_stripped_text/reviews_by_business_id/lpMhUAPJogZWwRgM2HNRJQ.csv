402543,2008-01-07,0,lpMhUAPJogZWwRgM2HNRJQ,"After amassing some points we decided to spend some of them here after I had made some football bets.  Normally, Station casinos are not great lines but they have higher limits than one would think, about double the Hilton.

Anyway, we were seated after a slight delay and I got the Delmonico and my girl friend just had the salad bar.  The salad is very good and included in entrees or by itself with soup for $16.

They have more variety than most salad bars and very good quality including bleu cheese crumbles, asparagus, shrimp salad, peas, artichokes, palm hearts, etc.  That night they had red and Boston clam chowder--the latter was pretty good.

The bread basket is below average consisting of thick sour dough slices and raisin bread.  My steak was a little slow in coming.  The 24 oz. ribeye was served with a side of zucchini/squash, a baked potato and bernaise sauce in a little container.

Ribeye was a pretty good quality steak about an inch and 1/4 thick with fairly good marbling.  Overall it was not up to the quality of Craftsteak but worth the smaller price tag.  The spud was about 6 inches lond and as thick as my wrist at its plumpest part.  

Vegetables were very crisp and hot, a good treatment of a so-so side.  I prefer mushrooms with steaks.  The only complaint was the bernaise which was served cool.  I don't use it for steaks but I dabbed some on the veggies.  Everything else was done correctly except this.

Service was good except for that small delay in getting seated.  My girlfriend enjoyed the salad bar and didn't go back for seconds even though there are no limits on trips back.

Pros:

1.  Pretty good value for the money.
2.  Very good salad bar.
3.  Clam chowder above average.
4.  Steak quality and cooking execution pretty good.
5.  Decent service.

Cons:

1.  Bread not very good.
2.  Food temperature inconsistent.
3.  Not so great for wines, none was ordered.

Overall for about $63 including tax and tip it was worthwhile.  It is an in-between place.  Not quite fine dining but not diner food either.  If you go in expecting this you probably won't be disappointed.  

If you are with a big group you will not like it.  It is set up mostly for booths so aranging tables might not be feasible all the time.",DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg,2,1,4,Jdm2_zOZajISN2wJWp0epQ

The 12 oz New York strip was very flavorful. It tasted marinaded and rubbed with spices. There were thin strips of fat around the edges that were crusted over with salty crispiness.

The baked yam was soft, sweet and delicious. I loved the cinnamon sugar butter that came on the side. I spread it over my yam and it melted into it'd threads, bringing out yet even more sweetness.  The consistency was like custard. 

The meal came with bread for starters. Focaccia, pita triangles, raisin walnut, and soft pretzel.  Dip the complimentary soft pretzel into the cinnamon sugar butter intended for the yam. It's delicious.

The fries were really good. They were skinny, came in a newspaper cone and were hot and crispy. 

The soup and salad bar also came with the meal. Make your own salad with ingrediants like spinach, beets, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes with several choices of dressings. Grab a chilled plate! The clam chowder and chicken noodle looked tasty, but I didn't try it.

The service was timely.  It wasn't that busy on a Wednesday night, and our food came out shortly after we set aside our finished salads. Our server was definitely up selling drinks, apps, and desserts, but wasn't overly pushy.

The decor is terrible, the location inside the Palace Station is pretty awful and the only reason I went in with my fiance is because the wait for oysters was over an hour...

As a side note we hit the oyster bar about every other week as we live just across the ways, that may change after this visit.

 There are many elements to a great meal and of course food is number 1 on the list but bad service can ruin even the best of meals. It can also persuade you to return if you had a bad lot. So I will go down on record as having the best waiter and bus person ever. Oscar is a complete delight, he is efficient, on the ball and in my eyes the BEST WAITER I have ever had. This man should be courted by some of the finest restaurants in town, he is that good. The only one close is Israel @ The Barrymore. He makes the trodden down Broiler come alive, I cant remember the last time I tipped 30% +. And the lady making sure the iced tea glasses where never empty is as sweet and my fiance likes her tea.

Food - Dozen oysters (9 out of 10), crab legs (7 out of 10), salad bar (7 out of 10), bone in rib eye (10 out of 10).

Salad Bar was a surprise for $3 you get the same chowder as at the oyster bar and they are smart in the sense they know they aren't that busy. Why smart? Each of the salad bar offerings is put out in very small amounts, enough maybe for 3 to 6 people at any given time. This ensures that while they do not put out the most glamorous offerings, what they do put out is extremely fresh and even the plates are in a chill box.

Rib eye - OK so here is the the most amazing part...Oscar recommended the steak and i ordered medium rare. Incredible flavor, cooked to perfection and overall one of the best steaks I have had in a very long time. Worth every penny of the $37 I think I paid.

You can't beat a couple of cold beers, some oysters, a great steak and the company of a beautiful lady...hard to top!

To the ""The Broiler"" I say thank you for a pleasant surprise, to ""Oscar"" I say a heartfelt thanks for making the evening far better than I expected it to be, Stations Casinos is lucky to have you and they need to get you in their commercials!!!!

And to the ice tea lady, don't change, the tea would be nowhere as sweet without you.

We will be back

Two people in my party got sick from the oysters. The Clam Chowder was so gritty it was inedible, my hamburger was dry and smelled old. To top it off a bill for two people is about $70 you can go to a really nice restaurant for $15-20 a plate in Vegas.

      The oyster bar is attached to it at one end and they share a kitchen, so all throughout dinner I saw servers running back and forth. The place was designed this way, so you know right from the start they weren't trying to be too fancy. 
     There are no table clothes or salad forks and forget about extra knifes for your bread. In fact if you don't want bread it's optional, my hubby and I had to ask for a basket. If you get a steak it actually comes with a side. If you need more than one, they are just four bucks. Service was mediocre, but the steak was pretty good.  The place is really inexpensive and even has a cheesy nautical theme.

The bad news is that you can only get the pan roast now at the bar.  You can no longer order pan roast if you go inside the restaurant and sit down.  The wait is also excruciating.  I went there on a Wednesday night.  Not exactly a time where the casino is packed.  There was only 1 waitress and 1 cook for 18 seats.  I counted because I was standing in line for 40 minutes!  I just stood there and watch customer after customer get up and leave after they finished their meal but there was no one to clear out their plates and tell the next person to sit down.  It was hard for me to get mad at the waitress since she had to take all the orders, bring out all the drinks, take care of all the checks, serve soup & salad, and clear the plates.   So after 10 seats opened up, the waitress finally got around to seating the 6 people waiting in line.  Then, of course, there was another 20 minute wait for the food.

We wanted oysters, so we ordered a dozen of the fresh oysters. The tiger shrimp cocktails and the steakhouse chopped salad. 

The oysters were very fresh - kind of small but fresh - and complemented with fresh grated horseradish. The tiger shrimps - I was not too crazy about since I have had better elsewhere.

5199355,2010-06-30,4,lpMhUAPJogZWwRgM2HNRJQ,"Preface: This is largely a review of the soup & salad bar.

Those sneaky little coupons will get you every time. We ended up at The Broiler with a $15 off $30 purchase coupon. The hub had hoped he could try the pan roast or linguine with clams, but these are only served at the Oyster Bar. The coupon was only good for The Broiler, so in we went.

The interior reminded me of a dark Shoney's, kind of a mismatch for the prices printed on the menu. Service was slow, but they got the job done. The hostess was probably the hardest working one there. Props to her!

The menu is straightforward steak and seafood, but they do have the not often seen soup and salad bar. The menu describes it as fresh and bountiful, which you would expect for $16! They're just trying to upsell you into getting an entree, as it is only a $2 add on to the entree. But, show vegetarians some respect! 

Sadly, it wasn't exactly fresh or bountiful. The lettuce selection was romaine or spinach, and there was plenty of wilting action. The rest of the vegetables were okay, but when you start with substandard greens, your confidence is hurt. I was left with an overall impression that the selections were not fresh.

The breadbasket was decent. At first, I was excited to see pretzel bread, but the more I ate it, the more it just tasted like not so interesting dough. 

As for the soups, they had clam chowder and chicken noodle. The clam chowder was flavorful. I think the predominant spice was rosemary. I could be wrong, but it was a powerful taste. I liked it, but it might not be for everyone.

Overall, I was disappointed. Bobby seemed happy with his trout and ginormous sweet potato (literally 3x the size of a normal one). Me: I had honestly been excited to see a $16 salad bar. I had visions of grandeur, but after my visit, I am thinking that Jason's Deli is the deal of the century!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,2,2,0W7wp8WFZeuMOebbtldbyw

I wouldn't say its awesomely wonderful because the quality just isn't like the other steakhouses in the other casinos.  However, it is massively inexpensive compared to those steakhouses.  This was truly a bargain.

Husband and I came here before a comedy show at Bonkerz, and I had the steak and lobster special for 24.99.  It came with a baked potato and their salad bar, which was an insane amount of food for the price.  I ordered my sirloin medium rare, and it came back medium but I didn't really care.  It was cooked well but it wasn't massively tender like the sirloin special at Ellis Island which I preferred.  However, the lobster tail was a real treat, as it was roasted perfectly.  The salad bar was wonderful, and we really filled up on it.  The clam chowder they serve was memorable.  The bread was also very good.  My husband had the NY steak and liked it but was walking around in pain from having salad bar before his meal.  His meal came with mac and cheese which came in a really huge bowl that could have been for 2 or 3 people and was way too much food.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here as there are probably equally good places in the Henderson area where I live, but for a before a show meal it was very good.  They also take restaurant.com certificates so it is an even bigger bargain.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,1,4,Ya01ifFabeOh-pnvBzhj_g

When the food came, it was pretty obvious that the steak I got was previously frozen, as the texture was dry although cooked medium rare.  I'm pretty sure the steak I got was only USDA Choice or Select, the types you can get in any supermarket.  For the price, you'd really expect that it would be Prime.  Also, the lobster while large was rubbery and tough, not like fresh juicy lobster which I also expected.
