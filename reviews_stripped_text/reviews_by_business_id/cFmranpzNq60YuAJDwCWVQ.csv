The first time we ordered they forgot toppings, on Halloween it took them over 2 hours to get out pizza to us (we live 7 miles from this store) the phone at the store was busy for the entire night and we called over 40 times. When the pizza did get to us it was cold and the delivery boy was rude and disrespectful when we commented about it. I ended up contacting corporate over the situation when I couldn't reach the store to complain and they said they would credit me $25 to give them a second chance (in reality it is their third chance) and when I called today to order a pizza using the credit, I find out that no such credit was ever credited to my account.

Frankly, I don't expect any above and beyond service from a chain pizza place like this, but could the employees care any less? Not sure about the answer to that. If you order any sides or extra sauces, make sure to remind them that you ordered them, otherwise they'll let you walk out the door without giving you your complete order. This has happened on more than one occasion.

The last time I went in there may be my last visit for a while. Ordered something simple for pickup, and the employee who rang up my order was nice enough. I always give the driver a tip when ordering delivery, but most often not when I'm picking up (hence what's the point of going through the hassle of picking it up yourself if not to save a few bucks?) But as I was walking towards the door, the employee and her co-worker seemed upset that I didn't leave anything on the 'tip line' of my receipt.

831554,2015-03-14,0,cFmranpzNq60YuAJDwCWVQ,"I would give my most recent experience 5 stars....the one before that 1 star but overall 4 stars. What prompted me to review was this last experience. The 1 star experience before that we ordered a handmade pan pizza, the best pizza they've ever had, always fresh. And then tried the Boston pizza I think it was. Supposed to be flat and foldable and big. And we wanted it for leftovers the next day since we were leving town and had no groceries.  Well that Boston pizza was cheeseless, dry and burnt. Terrible. The handmade pan was awesome as always. Well the Boston was like $15 plus tax / delivery etc. so I called and said I would text them a picture, they said no need and gave me a credit of $15. I threw it away which tells you how bad it was since even bad pizza can be eatable.  So tonight is sitter night so I called to get my credit. I stuck with my handmade pan pizza this time. Online said $8.99 each for medium 2-topping. I ordered 2 expecting to pay the difference between my credit and the total.  He said they were actually $7.99 each and he waived the delivery fee. I owed $1.19. He put me on hold and came back and said it was taken care of. 30 mins later 2 perfect hot cheesy fresh pizzas show up.  I tipped the driver well of course and the family was so happy! So I guess with a national chain like dominos, you sometimes expect disappointment as with Pizza Hut or papa johns etc.  Sometimes they get it wrong. But at least this location corrected it with class and didnt even charge the petty $1.19 I owed even though I expected to pay it.  And they have my business again.  And this review.

Today I decided to see what's up with the rest of their menu. I kindda wanted to get everything because how can you go wrong with a menu with items for $5.99 you can't it's awesome! 

I ordered the thin crust of coarse which they offer 2 medium 2 topping for $5.99 each so I get that with pep and beacon like always and if I chose the 1 large 3 topping for $7.99 still a good deal I would've add olives which would have been perfect. 

Then I order the stuff cheesy bread (Jalopino and Bacon) which was Canadian bacon btw I didn't know that. It was ok but wasn't my favorite it was cheesy and too pickled jalopinoy if that makes sense. It could've use some sauce. Then there's the specialty chicken I seriously thought this item wouldn't last but they still have it and it was actually really good. I ordered the cheesy BBQ and bacon of coarse...you see a theme here? Bacon, bacon and more bacon if you can't tell by now I love bacon! Anyhow yes although the BBQ sauce in the box looked completely burnt it taste great minus the burnt part. 

Ok so now that I've gone a little renegade and tried those two new item I have to try their hot sandwiches because they have that also now and their chicken Alfredo because I love Alfredo anything!

First time ordered specialty pizza, regular salad and tiramisu cup-after waiting 45 minutes from the time pizza left store ( you can see when online as is tracked)-pizza came freezing, gave me a Caesar salad which I hate and the lettuce was brown, quality of the chicken sucked as was mush, and forgot my desert, also wrong dressing.
Informed Sandy at store offered future credit. Fine.
Second attempt was tonight.... Wings, pizza, sandwich desert, and salad...$11 additional over credit, ok.
Told 20-30 minutes.
40 minutes later, pizza ( not thin crust as ordered), wings (not boneless as ordered), sandwich-which by the way is NOTHING like shown on website-supposed to come with banana and green peppers-there was a1/2 of each on the sandwich, NO desert and AGAIN the crappy Caesar.
This was the order that could make things right?
Driver had ""boss"" in the car who exemplified clueless.
I denied a redelivery as it was 920pm and they promised 10 minutes- its 952pm-seriously why did I even believe them.

Two: we ordered 4 pepperoni pizzas and went to Albertsons while we waited for them. Picked them up and got home to find out we got four cheese pizzas.
I called while my partner drove back to get the right Oder and the girl was confused about what we wanted as a order as if it was really that difficult to understand. No offense. Finally, she ended up just giving us 2 Pepperonis which is far from the four we ordered and paid for. Out of frustration we took the two and left. Smh! So irritating!

They understand what customer service is about not this store. 
Here is the review I wrote in the Decatur stores page. They deserve all the business.

Amazing service today guys! I recommend you order from the Dominoes on Decatur not the one on Blue Diamond. Let me tell you what happened today. I ordered three bread bowels from the store on Blue Diamond around 5:20 pm.
6:45 came around and still no delivery. I called and was on hold for 20 minutes and no one answered. So I called the store on Decatur and explained what happened to Jon. He tried to call the store for me as well however they didn't answer for him either. While I was on the phone with Jon from the Decatur store the delivery driver from the Blue Diamond store shows up and drops the bread bowls all over my front door step. He looked at me like he expected me to pick it up and eat it. I told him to take it back and credit my account. I now explained this to Jon from the Decatur store and he apologized for that stores behavior and sent me three free bread Bowls from his store. I totally didn't expect that but how amazing is that. Jon you really made our night and we appreciate you. You deserve a raise for going above and beyond even when your store was not the store that messed up. You made me feel different about Dominoes and I won't let the Blue Diamond store alter my opinion at all because of you. Thank you!",m-_Ed9mCK_jNN1T5sC51aQ,3,1,1,5ViKLH5sZ77321Kt_n-pww

When they first opened a few years back we would order delivery and every single time, something would be wrong with my order ie. no dipping sauce, wrong sauce, wrong pizza etc. I wrote their corporate and was sent an apology and a $10 gift card to come back. I waited a month or so and tried again and tried to use the gift card and guess what? No funds on card. I had then said forget it! If I want to pay for a crappy pizza I will go to the Hut or Caesars as at least I know that theirs is horrible but they get my orders right. I digress, I went there just a day or two ago and did carryout. The dude behind the counter took my very big, complicated order of a medium pep and a medium cheese pizza. I was told it will be about 15-20 min. Ok cool. 50 minutes later I walked up to the counter and said ""hey, are my pizza's ready yet""? Dude looked and they were sitting there. Mind you I was sitting in plain sight just a mere couple of feet away from the counter. I was not hiding in the rafters or lurking in the shadows waiting to attack. The employees run around and look so disorganized. Maybe the franchise owner or manager should spend a little time here and establish roles and duties. The phone would ring probably 20-30 times before someone would answer it. 

Appearantly this location has not improved over my two or so year hiatus and somehow is still in business. I had made a promise to myself to not spend another one of my hard earned dollars at this store again but was in a bind as it was late and my family was hungry.
