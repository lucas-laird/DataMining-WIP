If you're staying at the Rio, take the free shuttle to Ballys then walk 2o min on the strip to reach this place. It's in the back of what looks like an abandoned ally/lot. There's lots of options on the menu for Korean dinner and meats. It's about $27 for AYCE which is worth it because most of the a la carte dishes are at least $20/ plate. We decided to order individually instead of doing AYCE because we had 7 people and there's no one we could eat our worth. The soup bowls are medium sized so I suggest sharing one unless you can finish the whole thing by yourself. The shrimp fried rice was surprisingly very flavorful and moist, however, the brisket meat was disappointing. At $25,  we got a medium size plate that resembles the thicker beef slices in pho. 

It was mediocre,but we may return to try the AYCE at a future date.",6DglCjROPLec4a883IjOrw,0,0,3,XFx5ZBsX9kSVtvgZSKh44g

My friends work in the resturaunt industry so they're very polite and friendly whenever we go out to eat since they know how it is to deal w rude customers.  However the lady at ginseng is just mad at us from the get go.  Whenever we ask for a refill of a side dish or water, she pretends like she doesn't hear us and pretty much ignores us.  If we try to repeat ourselves we get a very mean look and a face of disgust.  As we sat at the table waiting for our grill to be lit she just stood there in the corner of our table doing nothing.  We look at her like what's going on? And she then tells our friend who is sitting on the left corner side of the table to move to the other corner because she can't light the grill...  First off a guest should be able to sit on which ever seat at the given table he pleases, she basically was saying its inconvenient for her to reach over to light the grill so move.  She also kept telling us to be quiet which I guess is understandable because we were talking amongst each other but we were the only people in the resturaunt and it was 4am in Vegas...  Idk.  
My friend put it best, it was like we were invited for dinner by a host that didn't want us there and wanted us quiet and we had to make do with whatever we were given to start off with.  The funny thing is all 3 times we went to eat here we always left wondering why the service was so rude and annoyed.  I wonder if it's always the same lady or a few of them that act like this...

While walking to our table, we noticed there was only 1 other party besides us and there were 4 tables that still needed to be cleared.

It was about $30 per person. It is definitely more than the usual AYCE Korean BBQ you find in Chinatown, but for a 24 hour spot, we thought it would balance out. An older, unhappy looking woman came to take our ""order"". Before we could even order, she told us the first two that would come out is the beef brisket and pork belly. After eating the brisket and pork belly, she brought out the tender beef, chicken and short rib (although we didn't order it) and walked away. Later she brought out the spicy pork. I thought it was quite odd, as typical AYCE Korean BBQ spots will ask you what meat(s) you would ""all you can eat"".

The gratuity the added was about 15%. I asked the hostess why was there a Required gratuity when we didn't even have a party of 6 or more. Then she said it's actually 5 or more in Vegas. I go to Vegas a lot and I've NEVER heard of this before. Then she even said that some places it's 4 or more where it's mandatory gratuity.

Note that the galbi is only short ribs (LA style) for those that frequent Sydney and Seoul joints. The traditional Galbi is on the a la carte menu and kinda expensive IMO ($40+ a portion - I assume 2 pieces). 

Anyway, not a problem but they limit to 2 pieces per person. We lucked out and they actually gave us an extra piece between 2 I think as the pieces they gave us in the first call was a bit stringy or that we skipped out on the chicken items. Who knows. 

But the annoying thing is that I started to order our cuts and the lady was like ""I bring out 1, 2, 3 then 4, 5, and 6 for you ok?"" It's like umm no I don't want that and I know what all of them are. And I really don't care for the chicken pieces (had to stop them from bringing it out). They also just went for it without much consultation, threw everything on the grill. Which is very strange as they reminded us to eat everything when we ordered more. But you brought it over and went about it on your own? Not a problem for us as we are big eaters. 

When we paid a nearly 15% tip - like a few cents short, could tell that they were unhappy but we were already on the way out. And because it was on the margin of being too little and just enough for their high expectations they didn't kick up a huge stink.

After choosing your meats (we went with beef and chicken), they fire up the grill on your table and you cook at your own pace. They slice the meat thin enough so you're not waiting very long for it to cook, which I think is a huge plus. They also offer mini sides (at no additional cost) of kimchi, pickled dikon and bean sprouts to freshen your palette.

We ordered the grilled chicken and dolsot bibimbap, so this review is limited to those items, the standard side dishes (banchan) and service.

Starting with the good, service was friendly upon entering but since we didn't order the ""All you can eat meat"" special, most of the waitresses were occupied serving those tables. We felt that we had to make an effort to get their attention for water, refills etc.

The dolsot was very disappointing. There was 3 veggies (mostly mushrooms, chinese broccoli and bean sprouts), about 2 tablespoons of meat and an overcooked egg. Typically, bibimbap has 5-7 veggies that include 2-3 root veggies, spinach, beansprouts, carrots, leafy lettuce, and egg that is almost raw so that when you mix it all up, it blends and cooks in the hot bowl.

The small portion of grilled chicken was overcooked/dry and was served on a plate. Judging by how quickly the food came out, it was likely precooked and sat around.

Finally, the banchan (side dishes) was very mediocre. There was only 5 or 6 compared to a good place where 10-12 is standard for dinner.
This seems to be the place for big meat eaters who 
want quantity, as the ""All you can eat BBQ"" is $28 per person. 

But if you enjoy the other Korean specialties like soups, rice/noodle dishes, fish, appetizers etc.,
I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant.

The general consensus was that the food was decent. We ordered traditional jjigaes, bibimbap, and naengmyun. They give you pretty big portions; I wasn't able to finish my Haemul Soondubu (Seafood Tofu Soup). I've had better Tofu Soup elsewhere however. Still, I was satisfied and left very full. 

The prices seem to be higher than what I usually pay for Korean food in SoCal but then again, we're in Vegas. 

It's a good option if you are craving Korean food and don't want to drive too far off the strip. If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars.",FyrYa3fL4agc5kZiW_3WFQ,2,1,3,roSVPAK-pVRB18p2UOPR1g

Did you say they have a 24 hour open Korean spot?
*drool

I was drunk and hungry. I wanted meat. I ate here. And it was good. I had spicy grilled pork. I liked it a lot. The chop chae was good too. It would have all tasted better with soju. I doubt I would have been able to tell the difference between soju or water at the time. I love chop chae and I love spicy grilled pork. My body on the other hand does not. It was still good.

1841869,2016-08-13,0,EkuSy_kM8dpGrlb2pTxCBw,"24 hour kbbq!! Heaven is real and this is where it's at.

I'm from California but I can't even lie, the meat here is so much better than anywhere in LA's K-Town or all the places on Colima in Rowland Heights. 

The service is a lot better here too. Back home all the ahjummas ignore you even if you're Korean, but the employees here were really attentive, particularly Esther. Not sure if she's the only Esther there since every other Korean female has that name, but you'll know who I mean if you get her as your server! She's extremely nice and she even flips the meat for you! This is like full service kbbq (unless it's like this outside California? lol)

Onto the meat- the kalbi is limited to 2 pieces per person (and you can only get it one time, so 3 people would only get 6 pieces total during their entire stay), but I don't mind because I can't find kalbi and all the other meat of this quality for $30 back home. The other meats from the AYCE menu were equally delicious and didn't really need to be seasoned or dipped in anything because they already had so much flavor. My sauces were basically untouched, which never happens for me.

I saw their sign near Fatburger but it took me a while to find it, then I found out it was behind Walgreens /o\  It's really hidden so I feel like a lot of people would miss out on this (along w/ the fact that people don't usually come to Vegas for kbbq).

All in all, great food and great service. There's no competition unlike the kbbq places back in LA/RH but they still give their all here, which I really appreciate. 
And they also have legit spoon and chopstick boxes! I don't go to enough LA spots to know about every restaurant, but they definitely don't have those in any of the Rowland restaurants. That gives it a more authentic feel to me. Small things like that and kimchi quality (which is great here) already let me know if a place will be worthy or not.",98KsxJJE_srKW-h970E9JA,0,0,5,VGy6MS_lLkka6QtnW1lQCA

They're in a great location on the strip with tons of foot traffic, but there were next to no other patrons inside while we were there. I think if they refreshed the interior and sourced some higher grade meat they could attract a much broader and more affluent crowd.

1885655,2014-06-20,0,EkuSy_kM8dpGrlb2pTxCBw,"Literally THE best hangover food ever. If this place ever closed down, vegas just would not be the same. 

Located right on The Strip, next to the big Walgreens, it is kind of hidden but not (if that made any sense at all). It's in an alley way that leads to a huge parking lot, if you're driving or getting dropped off. 

I'd say, it is more like a 3.5 stars than a 3. 3.5 stars if you're comparing it to anywhere else (ie. LA) but 4 stars for vegas food, if you know what I mean. 

The food is good, it is. Actually, it's DELICIOUS post drinking. I always get the Mandoo Gook, which is a dumpling soup filled with meat and glass noodles. The dumplings are HUGE and the portion is incredibly generous. It isn't too salty or full of msg which is always a plus for me. I've also tried the Doenjang Jigae (soyabean paste soup) which is pretty good too but a little on the salty side. 

My only question is WHY DONT THEY DO DELIVERY?!? They are clearly catering to tourists or hungover people (being 24hours AND on the strip), they might as well take it one step further.

Anyways, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come here if I actually lived in vegas but as a tourist staying on the strip, this is not only something I'd settle for but a very good option.",FQZZsU3J88IGF8n5e3XYZg,3,0,3,yaq5T0zottE1UQoizEveTw

1954114,2016-05-24,0,EkuSy_kM8dpGrlb2pTxCBw,"It's really weird but out of all the places I ate in Vegas, I probably had the BEST experience here.

Yes, they only limit you to two pieces of Galbi per person, but I'm more concerned about the quality than the quantity of meat I have. Aside from Galbi, all their other meats were up for grabs and the quality first class. They first provided us lots of dish condiments and a huge bowl of lettuce salad. I know this is equally bizarre of me to say, but I COULDN'T STOP EATING THE SALAD. My bf gave me the dirty look because he wanted me to eat more meat, but dear god, the salad was just dressed so well and loaded with derishessness! After a long tiresome day baking under the sun, the salad was such a refreshing note to my mouth. Even my bf, who doesn't like vegetables or fruit, ate a few pieces of the salad and liked it. (I must learn the secret recipe.) But aside from the heavenly bliss that is the Korean salad, the Galbi was also very tender and succulent. The bulgogi was probably my favorite, though, in all its mushy glory. Once grilled, it no longer resembled raw mush but soft, flavorful and juicy meat saturated with sauce and doused in the restaurant's seasonings. It complemented our short grain bowl of rice very well. My bf also loved the pork belly meat they provided, so he ordered double amounts of that. We pretty much sampled all the meats on the menu (didn't like the brisket - too tough) and liked everything else (though I'm not a fan of the pork belly.) The condiments, like the usual kimchi, bean sprouts, squash (i think) and other side dishes were equally sublime - good too for indigestion. My bf thought this buffet will only allow you a one hour limit, based on the receipt, but I'm not sure how true that is. Our receipt for The Aria's buffet was limited also to two hours, so I'm not sure if that's really a thing in Vegas or it's just something they write to make sure you don't dally. It didn't matter much to us since we were hungry and thus, ate fast and furiously. Our waitress(es) were very prompt and serviceable and you can adjust the dial on the grill to a setting you like, so no complaints on that end.

This restaurant provided me and my bf a very interactive eating experience with great food, great fun, and great service. I would give 5 stars, but I hesitate to do so because not all of the meat selection was great (brisket, for example) and the Galbi thing was a little disappointing (why label as a buffet when you can't get something for unlimited quantities?) It's roughly $30 pp, which is up there in terms of buffet, so I expected better from them. This doesn't take away from the fact that the food was awesome, though, so I would still come back if I ever go to Vegas again.",JFO4M53JgSZAe2fQorBjPg,0,0,4,9RLl9Jg-ltXl5e_mgbUzdA

Unlike many of the strip restaurants which are jam packed during dinner hours, Ginseng was almost empty.  It was prefect for my hungry group, no reservations, and we were seated promptly after arrival.  

The all you can eat menu is very limited to just 6 items.  For what it lacks in options, it picks up in quality, for parts of the menu that is.


 - Bulgogi - The best meat in my opinion.  Loaded with green and white onions, it made for the best tasting meat option.

 - Brisket - pretty average, not much to say anything about.

 - Spicy pork - again, average option, not much going with the meat or marinate.

 - LA Galbi - the bone-in short ribs were pretty legit, close second to the bulgogi.

 - Pork belly - overly fatty.  More fat than meat, on the disappointing end.

 - Marinated Chicken - I usually steer clear of chicken at KBBQ because of the longer cooking time.  The chicken and marinate we're definitely above my expectations.


I'm pretty spoiled by the dime a dozen KBBQ spot's in LA with great quality, so my review might be a bit biased.

Note for those who want to try this place, be prepared for a long wait at least for dinner when we went there. When you walk into a Korean restaurant and most of the customers are Korean, you know you're in the right place for some authentic cuisine.  

The two dishes that stood out for me were 2 pork dishes.  The first pork dish was mixed with rice cake and cabbage and was stewed in a kimchi sauce.  The tender pork had a kick to it, but also sweet at the same time.  Very traditional Korean food. I was hesitate to try dishes mixed with kimchi, but this was surprisingly good.  The second pork dish was spicy and grilled with onions. The sauce was more spicy than the first.  It was a simple combination, but great.  Both dishes were similar, however I didn't' mind eating it twice.  

I've had some really great seafood tofu soup and this place was definitely on par.  The soup wasn't watered down and had a strong flavor. And they didn't put too much vegetables overpowered the seafood flavor.  

Though i would say this place is a bit more expensive then the ones I've been to at home, but it's Vegas. Overall, I would say that this place would be a great pit stop on my next Vegas trip.  Another great thing is that this place is 24hr, so you can come visit here after a long night of Vegas fun! :-)",JCapJcvST-rREaLEvNRMcQ,0,0,4,S4_KJwdsjYnB-iJ2mxBzpQ
2559421,2015-11-11,0,EkuSy_kM8dpGrlb2pTxCBw,"I was very hesitant after reading other Yelp reviews. However, I have a different viewpoint since I know what to expect from a Korean service standpoint. 

In Korea, servers are not there to socialize or be kind. They take your order and serve you food. In Korea, they actually do not come to your table without you ringing for them first. Knowing this, I wasn't expecting an American server experience with smiles and greetings. The experience was authentic. The place was packed with other Koreans. 

We received our food fast and efficiently. They came over periodically to check to see how we are doing and if we needed anything additional. The food was excellent and the banchan was plentiful. 

A tip was not automatically added in to our bill. We both had the all you can eat. 

If you want more flavor ask for gochujang. It's a flavorful sauce that will add a kick. 

Know that you will get plenty of food and walk out feeling quite stuffed. Do not expect happy fuzzy care from your server. However they do busy their butts so tip!!! You will not have just 1 server. Whoever is closest will ask if you need anything. Based on my observations everyone that works here is Korean. So cut them some slack, they aren't familiar with American culture in being a waitress.

The place is open 24 hours and located on the strip across the street from the Monte Carlo -  it's old and a little sticky inside. You also have to pay $5 for to park in the nearby lot (or, if you're not pressed for time, you can always go on a mission and park at the closest casino's parking for free and then walk over.) But, when it became time to dine, we were pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the banchan and the meat. The majority of the food offered for their AYCE was above average and extremely satisfying. 

They have the table-side-door-bell so we would press it whenever we needed service, it's very convenient! Also, the ladies working here will try to cook the meats for you, but if you don't want them to, just let them know you got it and they will leave you alone. 

Here's the banchan (sides) we got:
- Stir-fried little fish guys 
- Pickled steamed broccoli
- *Kkakdugi (pickled radish cubes)
- *Kimchi
- *Kongnamul-muchim (seasoned korean soybean sprouts) 
- *Mountain of lettuce (seasoned with a Korean tangy sweet soy dressing)

*everything with a star in front, I enjoyed very much and went for seconds/ thirds. I recommend grilling your kimchi and radish cubes! It awakens the seasonings and makes them even more delicious.

Here's what we selected from the AYCE menu: (it comes with white rice)
- Bulgogi (thinly sliced marinaded beef) Very tender beef, moist and flavorful. We enjoyed it! Flavor rating: 4/5
- Chadolbaegi (brisket point without marinade) This was my least favorite cut of meat -  It was very chewy, tough and dry. The natural flavor of the meat was enjoyable. Flavor rating: 3/5
- Samgyeopsal (pork belly) This was excellent! The pork belly was super buttery after it was cooked and melted in my mouth!  Try not to overcook it. If you're unsure, ask the ladies working, they'll take care of you. Definitely dip the cooked pork belly into the sesame oil with seasoning and enter food ecstasy! Flavor rating: 5/5
- LA Galbi (beef short-rib with house marinade) **LIMIT: 1 PERSON 2 PIECES ONLY** - This was one of our favorites! It was tender, meaty, moist, and flavorful. We somehow didn't catch the small red writing that said 2 pieces only per person, so we were disappointed when we found out we couldn't order anymore for AYCE. Flavor rating 5/5

$23.95 is one of the better (tastier) deals for Korean BBQ AYCE in the area, so we are fans!

Pro tip: after you've ingested pounds of glorious meat, take a walk on the strip to help with digestion and enjoy people (tourist) watching! :p",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,14,10,4,56lDaS1RPGqqj3ZCDATIBQ

We never got the extra sauce that we asked for, or the refill on one of the meats. We then were left waiting for our check for over 30 minutes and were saddened to see there was an automatic gratuity placed on the bill that we did not feel was justified.

We passed by a huge marquee advertising Ginseng Korean BBQ in both English and Korean several times. We couldn't believe there could be a good Korean restaurant there. But after hearing good things from a friend, and unable to ignore our intense cravings for spicy Korean soup, we decided to give it a shot.

Ginseng Korean BBQ is located past the Fatburger on a small street off the Strip. As soon as I entered, I felt like this was going to be the real deal. Everyone in the restaurant was Korean, as were all of the servers and the manager.  

We were seated and given menus. Yes, the prices are more expensive than the average Korean restaurant. But this is the Vegas Strip, what do you expect?

I ordered the yukae jang (spicy beef and vegetable soup), my fiance got his usual soondubu (soft tofu stew extra extra spicy), and we ordered an appetizer of jap chae (sweet potato flour cellophane noodles stir-fried with beef and vegetables). The jap chae was hot and flavorful and totally hit the spot. The side dishes that came out were authentic, fresh, and delicious. The kimchee was very good.

I had a bite of soondubu and it was so good. My yukae jang was excellent - piping hot, spicy, and perfectly seasoned with plenty of shredded beef, a little egg, vegetables, and cellophane noodles. I was in heaven.

Only wonder the best reviews on Yelp are from Koreans. The meat was okay but the typical favorites such as Galbi were not included in the buffet option and available as an overpriced menu item. Go here if you're desperate for Korean food but don't worry about how much it costs, the service you'll receive, and the quality of food you'll receive.",T40V1lTI5hD2giFVl12ABA,0,0,2,CseKIUVIYNRXnD7_NkPesw

A lot of people here address poor customer service.  We initially had the same thoughts. But then decided that since we've only been to tiny Korean restaurants where we live where the owner takes care of you and you don't worry about the menu, maybe we aren't familiar enough with their culture to judge the service as ""bad"".   One of our group doesn't eat meat, so ordered a seafood dish and was given what we perceived as a bit of grief. There was no help offered in choosing a seafood dish. We later decided our Korean server probably didn't intend this, and service improved with the more our group ate of the meat and side dishes.   

Going to Ginseng is definitely a cultural experience. The AYCE BBQ has 5 different meat choices, and if you don't specify your preference (the bulgogi was perfection!), they'll start you at the beginning and keep feeding you until you are in a meat-sweat-coma.  And I mean keep feeding you a lot! The BBQ is cooked on a grill on your table and is pretty cool! 

We didn't even look at the later pages of the menu where prices got into the $30-50 range. This was for hot pots and other dishes. 

3 stars because the food was good, service was okay but could improve, and the menu was confusing for us, plus we were discouraged from ordering from it (they wanted everyone to order the AYCE). We would go back, but we'd do research on what we'd want to order first! If you go, make sure to specify your preferred meat first so you can really enjoy it. Also make sure to brush up on Korean menu knowledge as the menu, even with English translation, is overwhelming if you don't eat Korean all the time.",tKA3suxclCHmcTZSNGZE6g,0,0,3,foL9I-xtwkiwC7EggjHf3Q

We called to reserve or enquire about table availability because we thought it would be packed since it was all you can eat. But my wife heard a lady speaking half english that did not even answer our question, then hung up. We were hungry so went anyway because we love KBBQ.

Went for the ""All you can eat"" for $30/person.
It looked more like a ""1 hour -  you only get 1 cut of meat once - then get the fuck out!"" type of deal. 
Where is the ""all you can eat"" when you can't order more of some meat? The time limit of 1H to eat is also bullshit because they are open 24H a day, so what's the rush to kick us out when 80% of the restaurant is empty?
It was more like a packaged ""4 cuts of meats once"" disguised and renamed ""all you can eat"".
After looking at the pics that everyone posted....it looks like the server served us the least tastiest meat options they offer, like we got the left over. At the end we actually had a fith unappetizing and unwanted option of chicken which we refused, but she just threw it on the grill anyway. At this point we were ready to leave.
We left the place wanting to order more of what WE wanted to consume (but couldn't) and very dissapointed, partly because of the server's bipolar attidude.

... with restrictions. You need at least a party of two, you have a one hour to eat, their the galbi is limited to two pieces per person, and you have to pay for extra uneaten food.

First time we went, we didn't try the BBQ. The 6 side dishes were so tasty. Picked radish, picked zucchini, beansprout, kimchi, marinated beef, and seaweed. We tried the bibimbap and mandu guk. The bibimbap was very delicious (the rice was toasted perfectly!) with the exception of the eggplant that was a bit hard and plain. The mandu guk's broth was flavorful, the glass noodles' texture was on the spot, but the dumplings were more on the plain side (very lightly seasoned). 

Second time I went alone and wanted to try the BBQ buffet but the lady said it was only available to two persons and more. I was disappointed and left. I'll try it next time for sure when I come back to Vegas.

They All put it in) but they must have put an exceeding amount. The broth almost tasted like Korean Shin ramen.  I never waste food but only ate a few bites.  
Wife ordered the tofu soup and we didn't expect anything like BCD.in LA but  even BCD instant tofu soup was better then this. Bare ingredients. Few pieces of frozen seafood, tofu and scallion  (halfazz tofu soup) We ate only half.  If you're gonna serve me overpriced food then at least give me something  decent please.

In fact, it's better than most Korean BBQ places in Korea because in Korea, the freshness is less and the sanitary protocol, what sanitary protocol???  Have you been to Seoul?  There are places where the sewage is open air.  I'm not kidding.  It reminded me of New Orleans.  You also get much smaller meat portions in Korea.

When i got here, it wasn't too busy. it was maybe 930 at night. i was excited to try this place out and was starving since i knew i was going to a ayce I'm not going to eat alot during the day. i went in and had requested the ayce menu since that wasn't handed to me. they gave me the regular side order menu with most dishes average 15 to 20 bucks for one entree. i knew i would add a few more bucks for a better deal. 

the inside is pretty much section off into your own table with a seating of four for most kbbq tables. they are roomy and do have lots of space for groups or small parties as well. the parking is in the back of the building. it was next to a club called krave, not sure if the club still exists. but this place is hidden and isn't easily spotted on the strip. they do have a sign with red letter outside the plaza. finding this place might be a bit tricky. the nearest casino would be mgm, if i remember correctly. 

next i sat down and waited patiently for the food to arrive, and the servers were on break eating their dinners. i saw them eating their k bbq food and grilling it up. they had brought the raw meat and placed it all on the bbq and cooked it for me. i didn't do much because each time i try to flip it they come over and take the tongs and flip it for me. i wish i can go on my own pace then them serving it all the time. i felt like i was in a rush to stuff everything in my face at once. i can remember the meat was awesome and it was good. the texture and flavor was on point. i did ask for seconds of the side dishes which was the bean sprouts and pickled spicy cucumbers and kimchi as well. i know it was some good stuff. when i asked for more they don't acknowledge you but they do bring it to you. it felt like they didn't like it much or maybe just tired. the customer service is so so and kind of rude if i have to say so. 

i did have a good experience and i did eat a few rounds before i called quit. it was nice they do honor one person customers for the k bbq. unlike some places in LA, where they don't honor one person ayce bbq. it did satisfy my craving for kbbq in vegas. i did end up finding a much friendlier environment for kbbq with much more food in vegas later on. if you ask me if i would do a repeat of this place, i rather travel a bit further out the strip to get some better and more food for the ayce.

Our hostess checked in on us periodically to cook the meats and make sure we were satisfied with everything else on the table. It also helps to have a ringer button on the wall so you can ring them for things like water refills or meat orders when they're busier and less attentive. 

FOOD: The meats are not exceptionally marinated or seasoned but the spicy pork and kalbi (short ribs) are still very good. The unseasoned thin slices of steak can be a tad dry so dip it in the bean sauce or sesame oil. I think my least favorite meat from the All You Can Eat menu is the pork belly. It's almost completely just fat. I did enjoy, however, the unlimited salad that comes with the meal. It's chopped lettuce dressed in a spicy vinegar and oil. Light, refreshing and a perfect compliment to the barbequed meats. It's important to note that their prices have risen within the past year or so. The AYCE option used to be around $22-24/person I think. Now it's $30, so eat your fill.
 
(this is why I'm giving it 3 stars, though it can arguably be 4 stars when taking everything into consideration)

ATMOSPHERE: The place has off-white tiled floors, oil stains on some of the glass round the place, and no music or anything. It's not much to look at but for a KBBQ place that opens 24hrs, I don't think 'atmosphere' should be something to concern yourself with.

I've probably never known about this place, because I've most likely been distracted by Fatburger every time.  But if you wander deep into that alley next to Fatburger, you will find this little Korean gem.  yep.

OK fine, so I vaguely remember the server lady being nice and the spicy chicken being pretty good.. but not much else I can recall about the food taste.  However, the next day it looked bomb in my snapchat story tho! So yeah, 4*. haha

While, I'm sure its no where near as good as KBBQ in LA (or Oakland/SF for that matter) it's open 24 hours and you'll probably go here drunk. So who cares. Give it a shot.",0xgcrVXSZDvrt0Y6E_CeGQ,0,0,4,JCSiXKHt2iTH6Sv1X4U4Lg

But, that's where Yelp comes in. Not only is it a place to find ""Real Opinions"" by real people, it is also a place where one can leave a ""red flag"" for services received that is . . . bothersome.

It is not unusual to find ""below par"" service from Korean restaurants. The food at this place, I would give 3 stars. The part that bothers me is that when I left the place, rather than feeling like a customer, I was at the Salvation Army Homeless shelter. 

After a long day meeting with my own customers during a Fashion Trade Show, I took some customers out for dinner. The place is now a Korean All you can Eat BBQ, so that's what we ordered. I understand the concept of All You Can eat establishments, in which being environmentally efficient, I naturally have the mindset of ""no waste"". Our table, compared to other tables, ordered modestly. But every time the dishes came out, man they were very stingy with the meat!  I looked at other tables, and they seemed normal proportions. 

When you order a dish of Sam-Kiup-Sar (Pork Strips), there should be a normal proportion of a dish, that is meant for a table of 4 full grown adults. But, (I think it was the owner lady who brought it) she just brought out 5 pieces..! That is like saying to a (guh-ji = a homeless beggar)  ""here, take these scraps and be gone"". 

For a group of 4 adults + drinks + tip = $180

The taste and quality of the food, as I said is like a 3. The service we received is a ZERO.  It gave me a sour aftertaste as I walked out. If it was just me, so be it. But, I felt embarrassed in front of my customers.",gkzM3jVDMkApiuA1KRNUjg,3,1,1,VW55x4wAHX8-QURo3PMHNA

I tried my friends ""Cold Soup"" they bring it out with ice in it. Very interesting never had soup that was brought out cold. It had no flavor to it and eating ice cold soup is just too weird for me. Nasty, I wouldn't order it.

Its also nice because this place is open late night (because everything taste good when you're drunk) so if you're craving korean bbq after the club I would come here . It's convenient and right off the strip.

The only nice thing is they asked our party (of 10) if we wanted separate checks so paying the bill made it very easy.

Visitors to this restaurant could either order regular dishes from a standard menu, or select the all you can eat meat options. We tried the AYCE option, which consisted of 5 meat options, including brisket, short rib (kalbi), and bulgogi. The meat was good, but not as good quality or fresh as compared to other places that I tried in the past. They offered a good selection of slides, and offered a salad with a nice light dressing. The restaurant charged $29 per person, which was pricier than typical restaurants of this type, but its high prices were understandable given that it was located on the Strip. 

The restaurant itself was comfortable and quiet, unlike many of the korean BBQ restaurants on the east coast. Service was also excellent as well - they frequently stopped by to ask for our next meat selections and to refill our sides and dipping sauces. 

Tip - even though you might be tempted to try to eat $29 worth of meats, it is a far more pleasant experience to eat only as much as your stomach can comfortably tolerate.

The All-you-can-eat has an hour time limit and they started serving our food in about 20min without asking what dishes we wanted.

During the meal they served food very slowly and never checked up on us. We did not really enjoy the meal because we had to rush for food and water, and we did not get service from them.

The most impressive thing happened. We paid by cash with 13% tip.  (I know that I should have paid 15% for dinner, but they did not give us service so I think it is reasonable to pay less) They stopped us from leaving because we did not pay 18% tip. The lady explained that there is 18% gratuity with party of 6 or more. And our table is for 6 people, so we must pay 18% tip. I told them that we did not choose our table and there were only four of us so the gratuity rule did not apply on us. We were not happy about their service so I put down the amount I thought they deserved. Then she started being mad, gave us an attitude and said something angrily in her language.

I chose only 4 of the five meat entrees knowing I'd be lucky to finish that.  As it was, I ate very little of the sides and most of the main courses - but my appetite is limited these days.  I chose to skip the Chadolbaegi (brisket) due to reviews here and the Dakgui because it's chicken.

Meat dishes include your choice of up to 6 different items - 4 beef, 1 pork and 1 chicken:
1.  La Galbi - Beef short rib w. our house special sauce
2.  Bulgogi - Thin slices of rib eye marinated w. specially formulated soy sauce
3.  Chadolbaegi - Thin slices of beef brisket point without marinade
4.  Dakgui - Chicken meat marinated w. specially formulated soy sauce
5.  Sam Gyeop Sai - Thin slices of bershire pork skinless belly without marinde (thick-sliced bacon)
6.  Mae Un Dwae Jigui - Grilled spicy pork

Side dishes (8) included white rice, large romaine salad w/tangy dressing, Kimchi, soybean sprouts, pickled radishes and broccoli, grilled cucumber chunks and another green pickled dish.  All were worth a taste but I enjoyed the salad a lot, the sprouts and pickled items the best.  (The menu doesn't list these items or mention they're included.)  There's also a soy-based dipping sauce and a possibly ginger-based chunky dipping sauce.  

The waitress understood that I wished assistance in cooking and provided that, after firing up the grill in the center of the table and bringing out my sides and water.  She started the Sam Gyeop Sai - basically thick bacon - laying out the full strips then using scissors to cut the strips into pieces.  After that gained a decent char on both sides, she started the Galbi and Bulgogi, leaving the Mae Un Dwae Jigui until last.  So I had bacon, thin-sliced steak, short ribs, then spicy pork.  My favorite was the Bulgogi, which has a fantastic marinade, followed by the Dwae Jigui, which also has a nice sauce.  The short ribs are more like something you'd find at a chinese buffet and the bacon was just bacon!  All good however.  I think I could manage the cooking myself next time - the bacon and pork favor a nice char and the others just need to be turned frequently to fully-cook.

And there will be another time.  Ginseng has just become MY place on the LV Strip - I'll never visit without eating there at least once.  I mean really, a sirloin steak for $50 or this for under $30 - there's no contest.  Plus, I can't get this down the street in San Antonio - but I'll be looking now!",sNmJyDQ73WV6Qd2lS0BAFA,2,0,5,OcwHaavxi3Br548wBJXk1w

how could i not have gone to such a stacked event such as ufc 84?  even if it had the most god-awful name in the history of full-contact sports?  ""ill will"".  when i first heard it, i thought it was a joke.  i mean, we have a friend of ours we jokingly call ""ill will"".  even then it's stupid.

one of my friends decided that this would be a good place to go and i miss korea and my brethren so i hop at the first chance i get to have korean food.

being on the strip, i thought this place would be ridiculously expensive, but it's not so bad.  i mean, relatively.  they had most of the essentials on a korean list: bulgogi, galbi, soondooboo, etc.

i did think that a $17 plate of jahp chae was pushing it a bit, though.  i mean, it's fucking rice noodles with veggies and beef. the overhead to make that shit must be obnoxious in las vegas, because it should never make it over $10.

anyway, i had the soondooboo [spicy tofu stew] and my friend and his girlfriend had kimchee jjigae [kimchee stew] and the ttuk guk [rice cake soup], respectively.  all came out to standard, but the bahn chan was a little meh.  which reminds me-- what the fuck is up with all the korean restaurants serving coleslaw in their bahn chan now?  seriously.  are they hiring polish people in the back now?

the service was pretty okay and they seemed to handle non-korean speaking customers [my friends] pretty well, which is the best i can say for most korean restaurants.

also, they have a really cute waitress there, so they get an extra star for that.  i hope she reads yelp, because i'm totally going to ask her for her digits next time i come around [ie. when i'm not broke as shit] and she better be ready.",CIfH02mSlXfT2JyU5Sn-dg,1,1,4,re_X6XvK-0PvPAN-OT7zgQ

The place is difficult to find because it's in the middle of the strip of las vegas. Parking may be difficult to find am access for people who aren't familiar with vegas and the crowd. 

The place had an okay athmosphere, nothing to special. The dining floor and restrooms were clean. The place is not crowded at all, the tables are seperated thoroughly evenly. The ambience is not too loud but not quiet so it is a good mixture. 

The food was good, they have briskets, bulgogi, kalbi,  pork, and chicken. The side dishes were good as well, although, they didn't have fish cakes. 

The service started out good. She was proactive about helping us out and getting our food settled but towards the end it's like we didn't exist at all. That's why this place will get 3 star, lack of consistency in service.

Would I come back here again? Probably not. This place is very inconvenient for locals. There's other cheaper, with same or better quality in China town.",ZvneWq5RacQdzAdci1LkHQ,1,0,3,g64X4y5xflHyl5Plc85MDQ

Its a limited list of items to order from the menu for AYCE.
A little pricier compared to the Bay Area. Maybe because this hidden spot is on the main strip of Vegas.
We get a lot more for the same price in the Bay Area.
AYCE does not included lettuce wraps and radish wraps.
Bon Chon is included but not as much as I use to in the Bay.

Food taste good and you will see this spot packed with Koreans so you know it good.

After you are seated they will automatically serve you with Rice Tea placed on the table. My wife ask for a glass of water, the waitress said ""Oh you do not like the tea?"" She immediately take the tea and replace it with water without asking if we will still drink the tea. When they served the food, the servers are slamming it on the table. The worst part is, when we got our bill, with out notice they charged us extra for a tip, when we ask they said it is Las Vegas law. There are only 4 persons on the party, so I do not know what kind of required charges they are talking about. It feels like the servers knows that we are not from the area, so they do not really care If you will come back or not as long they got the most out of you.
