Server came and checked up on us regularly but not to the point where it got annoying. Flavor tasted authentic and good.",gege4H-BqLhGqqRBhMl0iA,0,0,5,m3WxMJm4mcdo59en9TMgpQ

Decor is nice and clean you are greeted right away when you enter and seated. We were given stainless steel filler and water cups right away. The servers are very good looking which is always nice. when my server came to the table she asked me if I been there before and if I had any questions about the menu..I got a oxtail soup never tried it before with lots of meat inside #5 the sides they give you are delicious and refillable which they never had me wave them down they were good at checking to see if anything ever needed to be filled and they gave us 3 extra free noodle for the soup we got. I'll def be back the soup was very good just keep in mind they do not really salt the soup that's up to you which is left on the table. The first bite I had said... I needed SALT. Which then I remember her telling me she adds it before. After I did...... I wanted to go back there and ask who ever made this marry me, be sure to order a couple things my friends kept trying to sneak their spoon in my damn soup so we ended up ordering one we all shared after we were done with our first soups lol. beef soup was oh my god......best thing my mouth has met.",nmWhgkLUThBmO_oAUs6luA,0,0,5,avBQBb2nwGk4zRpOHdfQEw

Spiderman 1 to Spiderman 3 well... who wants to see Toby Macguire cat calling girls again. Anyways the first tangtangtang really delivered food well but how well does this obscurely located place do? hmm seems sequels still never perform as well as the first movie. 

Setting: In a horrendously located plaza where if you're coming from the 215 to blue diamond you probably already have eaten at soyo, goong or yuxiang before noticing this hidden Korean restaurant. Nothing else is really here besides an enterprise and a liquor store. Coming from Blue Diamond you will have to make a U-turn. 

Food: Now there are lots of what I call classic Korean dishes to choose here but here's a few. You can go the bone simmered soup which you will need to add green onions, salt, pepper, and tadegi (spicy chili paste) or galbi tang which has a sweeter, flavorful broth with glass noodles and short ribs OR my personal favorite bossam (steamed pork belly). We opted for the bone simmered soup of ox knee and ox tail. 

Ox Knee Soup: Broth was very decadent and the ""meat"" is gelatinous which some people may not like

Ox Tail soup: Broth was good but not as delivering like the ox knee. The ox tail tasted strange. Almost kind of freezer burnt? and for the first time I have never finished an ox tail dish. 

Service: They do their job

Overall: This place gives me a weird vibe. The staff are older Korean so its weird to be listening to Migos at 1100am for lunch hearing F this and N that with my mom. I almost feel like I should be pounding rounds of soju at Soyo. I might give this place another chance and get the galbi tang next time.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,0,0,3,xY8xS9s92LiO1szZQm2zWA
