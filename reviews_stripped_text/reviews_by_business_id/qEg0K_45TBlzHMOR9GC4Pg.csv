I read the reviews prior to coming here, so I didn't expect too much.  The actual place used to be a few different businesses, so perhaps the location is no good in the long run.  I wouldn't call the area a broken down strip mall by any means.  The atmosphere is not bad at all, and the place was crowded.  It's like an upscale sports bar mixed with a pizza parlor and a gelato place.  They have as many TVs as they can fit on the perimeter, a full bar, a gelato display, and restaurant seating.  I spoke to the owner and he was very nice to me, the service was ok, but it was because they were so busy because the place was packed.  The pizza was delicious, and it was very unique style.  It's thin crust, and quite tasty, I got 2 pizzas - one with large slices of sausage, mozzarella and ricotta, which was awesome, and one with sliced mozzarella, tomatoes, topped with ricotta.  I will be going back, though I do think that the pizza may be slightly over-priced, but worth it - it's not the normal everyday pizza.",1LruKakieDb6khMVPlG8jQ,0,0,4,cmMWNefx1VnyyAgWuKxPqA

Found this place by reading other Yelps.  We loved the fact that this appeared to be a local place, not a tourist destination. That certainly influenced our decision to dine here.

We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering. Jennifer, our server, came over promptly and welcomed us. We decided to order a bottle of wine with our meal since we had plenty of time to linger. The small wine list was reasonably priced, and we selected a decent Chianti. 

Onion rings???!!!  Well, they are in our top 5 foods, so we had to try them. They *rocked* our world. See my photo! Very large portion, too.

Feeling slightly guilty, we then ordered the Mediterranean salad. Jennifer clued us in that they are quite large portions, so we ordered a small one and split it. They automatically brought us large plates and tongs so we could serve ourselves from the bowl. Very nice. The dressing was good and not over-applied. Another winner.

Next up: Margherita Pizza! Slight charring, flavorful fairly thin crust, nicely spiced and herbed sauce, fresh mozzarella. Heaven on a metal pizza platter! One word of caution: when they say a ""large"" pizza, they mean it. We would ordinarily order a Margherita to start and then something else, but what with already having consumed all the onion rings and salad, we only ate half the pizza. (Not to worry, it made a super great breakfast at the hotel this morning!)

OK, so even though we were really full, we couldn't resist dessert. My husband ordered an espresso and the cannoli. I finally narrowed it down to the creme brulee gelato, as creme brulee is one of my all-time favorites.  YUM!  We managed to nearly finish both of them.

Oh! And while we were having dessert, an on-the-house taste of the two house favorite gelatos, Bananas Foster and Italian Pistachio, were brought to our table. Excellent. If only I had more room!!

We just loved this place. We both sighed wishing we could come back soon and try other pizzas, and wondering how we could transport the entire place home with us to Austin.",TE5i-PPThOIGckmDIviLDw,1,0,5,DuE5J366swhiW17w2DWlpA

1139097,2009-11-07,2,qEg0K_45TBlzHMOR9GC4Pg,"i finally hit what i'll call my semi-neighborhood pizza joint ( there ain't much in mountains edge ! ) 

I was surprised to see it wasn't set up as a video poker/bar/food spot, i was surprised to see an Italian place a few doors down, i was surprised top see it wasn't an Italian restaurant but was in fact a pizza joint ( with some apps, sammies, but no pasta and of course the GELATO ) 

gf ordered the veggie pizza, i went with the meatlovers - place ain't cheap $16-$17. We also started with the calamari - the server assured us everything in the restaurant was fresh - nothing frozen. 

The calamari was decent but i admit, i still prefer tartar sauce over marinara. decent serving for $8. 

The pizza - mine was good, gf's - well, i just can't comment on it since i'm not a believer in a veggie pizza - you want veggies buy a salad ! ( then again, if you want meat - BUY A STEAK ! ) 

Some details about mine - it had meatball ( sliced - i couldn't taste it ) , pepperoni - nice sized slices - and since i asked for a little extra crisp, the pepperoni curled up and crispy on the edges - great taste ! the sausage - also cut in thin slices - decent but the pepperoni stole the show. the pizza takes a slight turn for the worse with the peppers and onions - the flavors were good but you had to work fast before the crust started to soften. 

The great thing since we were only able to eat 2 slices off the pizza ( the calamari filled us up ) the next morning the pizza wasn't soggy and it tasted better - the flavors melded much better ( still believe the true test of pizza and pasta is the 2nd day, not the first day - at least to the flavor ) 

and geez - they got tv-o-plenty in this joint !

1140758,2010-04-10,0,qEg0K_45TBlzHMOR9GC4Pg,"This is definitely among one of the best pizza places in town. The crust is very thin and flavorful. The highlight of their pizzas is their toppings. Especially the pepperoni. They are larger than typical pieces, have slight crunch, and taste spectacular. It's hard to describe further, but it was by far the best pepperoni I've had. The sausage was also excellent. It is cut lengthwise and very tasty as well. The portions of their toppings are HUGE. The entire pizza was covered, they definitely do not skimp. We only had pizza, but I am told by others that the pasta, sandwiches, and salads are also excellent. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is a lot of fun. You feel like you are in an Italian restaurant/pizza parlor as soon as you walk in. Red and white checkered tablecloths, brick walls, lots of pictures on the walls, and 20+ flat screen TV's throughout the dining room.

Boyfriend took me here last night for our 6-month anniversary of our first date (aww) that happened to be a different Italian place the first time so I guess he's going with a theme :) Unfortunately I was not all that pleased by the food. 

We ordered a large five cheese pizza. Now I know this is supposed to be thin crust pizza, but when they put so much cheese on this thing that it becomes a soggy mess that you literally cannot pick up, that is a problem. I had to use a knife and fork for half of it, and it was actually kind of disgusting as you are literally just swallowing gobs of greasy cheese. The mix of cheeses on there wasn't necessarily appetizing either as one in particular had a really creamy texture that just did not seem to belong. If you're going to do a five cheese pizza, make sure the damn crust can hold what you're putting on it and make it with cheeses that are gooey and stringy, not creamier than warm butter. Ick. Oh, and $19 for a cheese pizza with no toppings? Rip-off.

The gelato we got for dessert was a different story. I would come here for dessert more than pizza. The presentation was beautiful and the four bites I got (EAT SLOWER, MATT! :D) were delicious. They even brought us a small 5-gelato sampler before we ordered to see what we would like. We got a 2 scoop mix of white chocolate strawberry cheesecake and cookies and cream. Yum! 

This place looks really nice. It's bright, has flat screens along the entire length of the place and they have lots of memorabilia around - old school pizza parlor meets high-tech. The customer service was decent, the gelato was delicious, but the pizza - yikes. Matt loved it, I hated it. If I'm going to spend $19 freakin' dollars on a pizza it better be huge with at least 5 toppings (other than the cheese!) and not fall apart. This place is not somewhere I think I would frequent unless it was for dessert alone.


UPDATE: I don't give a shit what Matt says, I'm not coming back here even if he's paying. I'll wait in the car with gelato to-go. New York boy or not, the pizza sucked.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,4,4,2,xVtt_G_5qZdaBuOO-XeQ4g

Why you may ask:
1st off the atmosphere is wonderful! There are so many things to look at, over 24 52"" flat screens playing just about any game in HD and not to mention other shows and entertainment that everyone loves! The restraunt really makes u feel at home all the way down to the old school checker board table cloths to the celebrity pictures and framed signed guitars of past rock bands! 
2nd: The service!!! We had Tommy as our server and as a former bartender this guy rocked! Not only was he a plethora of information, but he was really on top of his game. Fast attentive service with a smile, and he really coursed out the meal perfect! Say better than buff wild wings) and their chopped salad( massive hearty tasty salad, would def share) but we finished with those and not 30 sec later we had our drinks refilled fresh plates and our large buffalo mozzarella pizza( OMg this is Italy on a plate) ! The crust let me tell u is nothing like anything I've ever had before in Vegas! Crispy outer with this mouthwatering chewy middle!!! Aww I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Then this guy not only offers us cappachinos but brings us little samples of their gelatos and the tiramisu( handmade by their Exec chef Enzo!( picture of him on their delivery cars too!) we ended up getting a pistacio gelato sundae... Now wait this gelto is to die for the only use imported Italian pistacio and Italian pistachio paste making this the creameist gelato in the world, and not only did we get hot fudge and whip cream but is was topped with a full 6""  imported silian cannoli 
shell !! I know I sound like a commercial for them but this I learned from my great server Tommy! Kudos to you!

Now how do I even begin to describe the one delicious brick oven fired rich meaty concoction that will forever plague me with an eternal raging hunger erection.

The restaurant itself is nice, great set up with all the TVs... would be a great place to watch football (especially if the pizza were better).  The salads and side dishes I've had there are good, and well priced.  The gelato in like 15 different flavors is definitely good.  But bottom line... I think the pizza sucks.  The toppings are pretty good and seem like good quality... but the crust really leaves a lot to be desired.  It's too chewy, bland, and just not good.  It gets really soggy under the toppings...  and I'm not saying after a while... or when you get it delivered.... I'm saying it's that way right when you get it served.  Not good...  I'd rather get a pizza from Pizza Hut or Dominoes to tell you the truth, especially considering they're way cheaper.

This was perfect New York Style thin-crust pizza.  My favorite pizza restaurant in town is Settebello, which is authentic Italian (Napoli) pizza, and this is NOT THAT, it is New York style and excellent for that! The sauce was fresh tasting, the pizza beautifully thin and the right combination of crunchy-chewy.  A small is perfect for two.  Stella Artois beer on tap, which I had when I worked a summer in Belgium, was so wonderful with the pizza.  22 flat panel televisions around the room, silent with subtitles, we watched the Food Channel, President's Cup, Barrett-Jackson Car Auction (where we had come from -(who wants to eat at a convention event off the chafing tables and snack bar?) it was a lot of fun.  Red and white tablecloths, pizza served on those little wire towers so there's room left on the table.  Nice, nice ambiance, lots of celeb pictures and memorabillia.  But I saved the best for last - and which is actually the first thing you see in the door - is this GORGEOUS display of about 30 (guessing) varieties of incredible gelato, tastes definitely encouraged - we loved our taste samples of snickers bar gelato and pistachio gelato, we had creme brulee gelato (with little pieces of carmelized sugar in it) and this fantastic chocolate truffle mouse gelato - very very very good.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it is so far from our home (Flamingo and Eastern), so it's quite a schlep down the 215 to get there (not from Mandalay Bay, though, which was why we decided to go there from the auction).  We will definitely find reasons to be back in that area.  They are doing a lot of street construction so it's a little hard to get to - located between Tropicana and Flamingo on Durango.  Lots of families there, so I challenge the ""pricey"" charge made by Samantha, nowadays everything is expensive, so she should go back to the 39cent tacos and leave the reviewing to people with some taste and objectivity.

The service is excellent! Our server was friendly, informative, attentive but not overly, and he was great at upselling. 

We had the calamari which is fried in olive oil only. We were told they have a fryer with olive oil dedicated to frying calamari. Calamari was larger and meatier than what I'm used to which was a pleasant surprise. Batter was light and crisp. Would come back for this... 

The clam pizza had slices of some kind of hard cheese (maybe Asiago or Romano) which made it really salty. I could have done without that. Being that was the first time I had white pizza, I don't think I would order it again; I'm a fan of tomatoes 

We also had the Bufala Margherita which was good. I think the Bufala on the pizza changes the texture to be chewy and recommend ordering just the regular even though there are better benefits to having the Buffalo (there is a reference card they give you that tells you how it is lower in cholesterol, fat, and sodium and higher in protein and calcium - I was amazed at that card, my first time seeing it) 

At the end of dinner they give you a tasting of their gelatos. Great idea, as I tasted the Strawberry White Chocolate Cheesecake and had to get it - there were strawberries in it, so it was a fruit based dessert right?!

There is a bunch of  T.V.'s playing a variety of things mostly sports.   Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to sit at the bar and have a few, but I look forward too it.

The food is real good.  I really like the house salad the small could actually feed two.  Now the pie's Like any other place they have a wide range of toppings.  But what most places don't have is the option for New York style which is shredded Mozzarella and the Neapolitan style which is whole slices of Mozzarella.  I like both so I tend to go with a few people so we can get both.  

If your in the mood for something different instead of the normal pep or sausage pizza's try the Kalamata Olive and Artichoke combo it is excellent.  My only gripe about the pie's here are they are a bit watery not at the crust but at the tip.  Other than that it's really good.

FOOD- there's nothing we did NOT like. We loved it all! From beginning to end. Quality, quality, quality. 

ATMOSPHERE- I LOVE IT! They have a quaint bar area as well! 

SERVICE- Needs some improvement. Although it was not horrible, it was very SLOW. We weren't greeted right away. The table seated next to us, arrive about 5-10 mins after us but some how got their drinks and food before us... And they had the same server? And I don't understand how the pasta came after the WOOD FIRE pizza? 

FUTURE- Yes, we will be returning, repeatedly. The husband and I said a few times in the night ""I think we found our new spot!""",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,2,2,4,W8NCWkMVrA6PL7K2StZ0Ew

I ordered the Meatball Parmesan sandwich and it rocks. The pasta salad that came on the side was bland, but I was more interested in the sandwich. You can get curly fries instead (and that is actually a much better choice).

The downside is the iffy service. I'm hoping it was just the guy who served us, but he just couldn't get things straight. Fortunately, the service isn't horrible and the food more than makes up for it.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,2,1,4,C08wuvSuI0sBb81_8hBh3Q

The white pizza with tomato just looked like glue and tasted like glue. I know white pizza wouldn't exactly be the most appetizing thing, but this was awful. One of our coworkers declared it as the worst white pizza they ever had. Don't put it on the menu if it sucks, I don't care if you want to be a pizza place that caterers to everyone, this place is doing a disservice by allowing such a poor product on the menu. AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL!

The clams in the linguine was really small  that you almost need a microscope to see them. Of course, it came with half the container filled with oil, yum.

But to keep this review balance and what saved it from getting a 1 star was the mushroom parmesan pizza that our other party got was delicious. 

Would I come back here? Probably not. But if I was going to, I would pick something else other than the white pizza.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,2,0,2,Qyq383kOkLKSM74RDi_1kA

27 flat screens

me - the caprese eggplant parmesan salad and chicken wings
my favorite tiramisu gelato is to die for!

They have not once brought the correct foods at the correct time. The appetizer arrives with dinner, they forget the garlic bread, no one ever asks if you want another drink. I have been here at least 6 times and always leave aggravated. I even talked to the manager who barely says he is sorry. There are far too many places to put up with this.

This is by far the best pizza I have had in Vegas...While Metro Pizza and Joe's are close, I am officially addicted. 

I've been here twice. The first time I was a lil' well, how do you say...lacking memory skills, yes that's it. Anyhoo, I did remember the one slice of pizza my friend forced me to eat, to regain normalcy with the rest of society. So, another trip was made, a sober one at that. 

Ordered the chopped salad, delicious--Romaine, avocado, artichokes, garbanzo beans and salami with a balsamic dressing. 
Our neighbors at the bar ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza, so my friend and I replicated and ordered the same thing. The pizza is awesome, fire oven and thin crust with HUGE pepperonis. I can't wait to try some of their specialty pizzas--meatlovers, 5 cheese, vegetarian, and the white pizza. 

If I had saved any room, but apparently I love beer too much, I would've had some of their gelato. It looked like they had a large variety of flavors.

This place is also great for watching sports. 25 TV's line the restaurant, it can't get any better than that right? Well, lucky for you gents you have one in the bathroom. 

The bar has a few beers on tap...from what I can remember--Stella, Peroni, Coors Light, Bud Light, and about 4 others.  

Oh, and they also added pasta onto the menu and they now deliver within a 5 mile radius!!! Whoo! I made the cut off by .2 miles.",fcb3NvbGr9qaPPLUlSnk6A,1,1,5,Az8G7hUv3C0Ujc39O8mHlQ
