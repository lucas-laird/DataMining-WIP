4190,2012-05-29,0,gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw,"Ok, it's a Chipotle Mexican Grill. It's exactly like all the others, and the menu is the same.

That being said, it is inside a mall, and has a reasonably large and clean seating area outside the restaurant in the concourse. The food was good, and the staff was efficient and served promptly and hot. It is possible to get some variability in the freshness of the food and cleanliness of the location of course, and on both points this location was great.

The only reason I'm adding my review here, since I don't think every single Chipotle needs a review, is that it was one of my best meals in Vegas. The last time I was in Vegas it seemed a little easier to find something vegan. Especially in some of the $100+ per person restaurants, I'd expect the chef to be a bit more accommodating.

During one order, after silently building my burrito, the gal behind the counter half heartedly asked how my day was going. ""Good! How about yours,"" I replied. She stared back at me blankly, as if she were a hostage silently screaming for help, then burst out laughing. WTF. 

As for the food... Two out of the 4 times I've been there, they've been out of certain ingredients. And twice more, I've found my meat was room temperature, at best.

1. Online order apparently never works with this location which I find odd. You could have the email confirmation in their face and they would argue with you that ""they didn't receive it"". And it doesn't help they have such crappy attitudes. Even the manager will give you attitude. Sure, I can go out of my way and go to another location that's 5 miles away from my job instead of this location which is just around the corner but I shouldn't. I guess not everyone cares about customer service. Instead of trying to blame the customer and saying ""no, we didn't get it"" say ""I apologize for the inconvenience. Please let me know what you ordered and I can make it for you immediately."" IDK just a thought? At least that's what I would do...but hey it's not like I've been in the customer service industry since I was old enough to get a job....oh wait....
2. Food is always cold. Even when you eat there. Why is my food cold when I literally just ordered it? Is that also my fault? Maybe you should have a microwave next to the soda machine for those of us who are paying for a hot meal.

Friday 5/30/2014 approx. 1:45PM...

Wanted a quick bite so entered Chipotle and was barely greeted by the guy behind the counter - I think he made a sound like ""neh""  - so I proceeded to give him my order. Asked for a chicken burrito, but they were out of both beef and chicken - at lunchtime no less. Without a smile nor a friendly smirk and after heating up my tortilla, he filled my burrito with Barbacoa and veggies (remember no beef nor chicken), and passed it on to a girl that seemed equally as miserable to be working there. She added the additional accouterments, wrapped my burro, and handed it to the cashier.

Now the cashier was friendly however not above and beyond as I have experienced in other Chipotles. She was very accommodating when I asked for a paper bowl for my burrito..

I rarely eat there. It's my least favorite place to eat at the Fashion Show Mall.

To begin with it's always crowded, and you can rarely find a place to sit. The dining room is cramped, and there's rarely any available seats in the mall area.

It's always very loud in there. So loud it's almost impossible to hear the people taking your order. I usually have to say, ""What?"" or ""Excuse Me?"" many times while ordering. 

It's also very expensive, and they don't offer a mall employee discount. There are 2 other Mexican Restaurants in the mall. One facing the strip next to RA Sushi, and another in the food court. There are many other restaurants within feet from there, and they offer discounts.

On a brighter note... The quality of food is up to standards, and it's usually fairly clean. The employees do put in an effort to constantly clean.",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,2,0,2,sufDxs1tbHT9bESm-Prntw

This was the location within the Planet Hollywood shops so immediately my friend noticed that the prices are higher at this location than others. That's quite pathetic on Chipotles part if you ask me. 

It's basically an assembly line style fast food joint, much like what you'd see at Subway. Food choices are basically a bowl or a burrito for vegans. 

I ordered the sofritas which are basically a burrito with tofu. You can then order beans, rice, sauce and guacamole if you wanna pay 2 dollars more. That's right, 2 dollars for a tiny container of guac.

All of the people working were extremely nice and informative which I appreciated since I was a Chipotle virgin. 

The food was a lot more expensive than I was expecting and my burrito really wasn't very big but the food itself was delicious. I loved it and still get cravings sometimes.

Once we got to the counter, the girl (chubby white one) looked pissed at me for some reason. She looked very unhappy & was very unfriendly toward me. The way she spoke, and her actions. Also, there was another girl who helped scoop the food into our burrito bowls, and she had the same attitude as well.

While they asked what we wanted & scooped it into our bowls, they barely scooped anything, so I asked ""May I have some more, please?"" They followed by scooping a very, very small amount. One of them, when I asked for lettuce, scooped about a quarter sized amount & when I asked for more, another quarter or two sized amount. I'm not sure why they're so stingy here, but at other Chipotle locations I've been to, they always give a generous amount of food & customer service is mostly great.

Once I got to the cashier, the guy gave me the wrong change (less), but when I let him know, corrected it almost immediately. I always tip food service, and almost didn't (because of the mean girls) but did because the guy saved the day by being nice & he didn't give me a mean look or frown. He SMILED & was genuinely nice.

The line was pretty long, but it goes fast. The employees weren't rude, but they weren't overly friendly either. Just enough to get them by. 

So here's why I don't eat here ever...
1. The food gets cold fast. With all the lettuce, salsa or sour cream you pile on your food, no wonder everything you eat is cold after a few bites. 
2. The quality of meat they use was really crappy. The steak was really chewy and you could see the veins. 
3. They are super stingy with portions. I've eaten at this location a few times and have ordered different things. This last visit, the chick put 4 small pieces of steak in my taco. Another time I ordered a bowl and I only got a little scoop of rice even when I didn't have any beans. 
4. The flavors are pretty bland. If you don't drench your food in salsa or cheese or sour cream, you really can't taste much. I don't eat sour cream or cheese since it's extra calories I don't need to be eating. So it looks like I'm stuck with boring food. 
5. Their tortillas suck. They get hard and break so all your meat and stuff fall everywhere and you need a fork to finish eating your tacos. 

Anyway, to everyone that swears by this place, to each his own. But for me, I'll just stay away.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,3,1,1,QIWbKDl1Bjn91V35p3o_Bg

Yes there is a perpetual line, but it always moves fast and I firmly believe that the turn over is why the food always tastes fresh here.  They always seem to be on top of replenishment because they've never ran out of anything while I was there.  

Their chips are the best!  They spritz lime juice on the chips before they salt them which gives them a fantastic fresh flavor.  I have noticed that not all locations do this and their corn chips a very bland without the lime zest.

I like that they don't charge extra for fajita veggies (sautéed onions and peppers) like other similar restaurants; that they now offer brown rice and wheat tortillas; and that they don't charge you more for a salad or bowl.  Burritos, bowls, and salads are all priced by your protein choice.

The fun thing about this location is their seating in the middle of the mall walkway.  The people watching opportunity is priceless.  They also have in-restaurant tables, if you prefer, but it's crowed and usually loud.

Great idea Chipotle! You just earned yourself a fan.

First off, is it me, or should there be a Chipotle in every major mall or shopping center in Las Vegas and Henderson?! It's our favorite organic-based restaurant (a Panera just opened up recently near us and I wanna try that place soon), and hubby would love to eat here once a week, too.

We've eaten here several times. We usually sit at the outside seating in the middle of the mall  aisle (fishbowl effect; just seats and trash cans surrounded by a little fencing), but the last time, it was so deep into the lunch rush, that we were lucky enough to get a table inside (napkins, forks/spoons, Tabasco hot sauce (chipotle version is delish), drink fountain inside, right side, facing the front of the square-shaped restaurant). Long line, but worth the wait, and once you get the food, mmm, it's all about the happy bellies.

Inside it's small (if it was just those tables and chairs, it would be a hole-in-the-wall), but that's why there is seating in the mall, too. Once the line got really long, the staff was churning out the food (and they got it right, too) and managed the line to zero people after the lunch rush. Kudos to them to managing the mischief (they were still nice, too, while being busy, which I can appreciate). Then, they got to do some cleaning and refilling after the crowd died down (after the high-fives and smiles). It is nice to see some fun and genuine customer service (it's a downer when you get service from people who just do not care, and they don't like people, and it shows)---again, not the case here. 

My husband always gets a burrito (carnitas is his fave) while I get a bowl (regular white or brown rice- it depends, chicken, medium salsa, sometimes, I get the corn, black beans, some cheese, some sour cream, some lettuce) to share with our son who loves rice bowls (and rice, in particular). We used to have leftovers, but our son, when he loves something, finishes his food with much enthusiasm (""Mum! Mum!"" he says, which mean 'more food please'). 

My favorite meat here is the barbacoa, but I don't get it often. It is rare to have a bad meal here. Honestly, the only thing that could make any Chipotle any better is if they offered seafood in their meat selections. (But, if you like Hawaiian food, check out Braddah's, 'cause it's like a Hawaiian Chipotle...)",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,3,2,4,KbQyJbjscAnD16wCHsDW1Q

Tonight, my grandmother and I went to the Chipotle at the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas right on the strip. We decided to do take-out because they were closing. By the time we got home we were starving and so we dug into our food as soon as we sat down. Only a few bites into my burrito bowl, I bit something hard and hurt my tooth. I spit it out thinking it was a bone, but it was a circular ball about the size of a pea that was a dark brown on one side, and a lighter color on the other. I knew it wasn't a bone, so I stuck it in a ziplock bag to further investigate this alien substance - as you can imagine i couldn't finish my food. A few minutes later my grandmother yells saying she bit something as well. She spit it out and it was the same ball like thing I had bit on. So these two strange balls had ended up in both our burrito bowls (what are the odds?) My grandma doesn't get as grossed out as I do, so she continued to eat her food cautiously. A couple bites later she freaks out again and shows me the second thing she crunched on. It was a large chunk of avocado (normally this is a good thing) that was extremely hard and still had part of the seed attached. There was also fragments of the seed in her bowl. The chunk of avocado with the seed attached was bad enough but either of those two balls could've choked a child had they swallowed it. This is unacceptable. I'm personally still skeptical about the two-tone balls, while my grandma thinks it is just part of the seed. Not to mention but as everyone knows, ""the guac is extra!"" I'm sorry but that avocado was totally not worth that extra four bucks...

Needless to say we lost our appetite and twenty dollars worth of food that was inedible. I have never had such a horrible food experience, and never would have expected this from Chipotle.

5021409,2014-02-27,1,gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw,"I am not in general one to review a chain property as you would think a patron would be getting a mostly consistent experience from location to location.  Not so the case with the Fashion Show Chipotle.

First, it should be noted that this store is more expensive than the surrounding Chipotles.  I understand the rent for the building is probably pretty high, but that's a tax that seems to have landed on the customers.  Being that you are paying more however, unfortunately the portions are less than neighboring Chipotles.

The proteins are dished out in what looks more like garnish portions.  The meat should be the hero and not the after thought.  Ask for a more ample serving and you are charged double for what truly is a normal sized portion at any other location.

Eat there in a bind because you know what you're getting flavor wise.  Just don't hope to be satiated unless you want an $8 dollar burrito bowl.  For a store in a more lavish environment, they're exceedingly expensive yet wow, at the same time incredibly stingy!",qQC7w7AEGJAsYAfzDip24w,2,2,1,H2DAPwGOyRDzAfI6Y-NALw

5348470,2014-12-20,1,gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw,If I could I would give this chipotle no stars. I ordered a burrito bowl and received a kids meal. They're really stingy on portions. I told the server to give me a little more meat when she barely gave me any and said it'll be an extra charge.... Horrible chipotle!

5353540,2012-11-16,0,gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw,"If you are looking for a consistent meal no matter what location you visit, come and eat at Chipotle. One of the healthiest fast food restaurants around, Chipotle serves up great tacos, burritos and salads...all well under $10. 

Food: One of the things I like about this place is that all the ingredients are freshly prepared and served in front of you and you can customize your burrito in any way you want. Oh, and make sure to order the guacamole... The freshest and tastiest I've tried in Vegas. 

Staff: This particular location had some customer services issues when they first opened, but have improved a lot since then. You are always greeted with a warm welcome and a smile and your food is always ready within minutes of walking in the door.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,0,0,4,QpkyEjFGAZYfApk47OeVmw
5373069,2012-05-19,1,gtffarZ2Y_rLfCegMg-nqw,"A light meal is nonexistent at Chipotle. Even when getting a salad, the staff piles heaps of each ingredients into the bowls. As stated by their board, all of the protein choices are raised in hormone and antibiotic free conditions and the veggies are mainly organic. Which means the copious amount in front of you will only put you into  a food coma.

The options are limitless. With the availability of brown rice and black beans makes me happy. The pile of shredded barbacoa only adds to my delight. The dressing is not my favorite. It is unnecessary with their pico, roasted corn, mild and hot salsas. For a quick meal, Chipotle does hit the spot.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,4,k-HtDeGlYYTbOxwKR4nk_A

After stuffing your piehole with buffet food it's not a bad idea to get a burrito bowl or salad here. They can get crowded of course but they move fast. There aren't a ton of seats and they share their space with pizza and Chinese places so you might have to get it to go.,j7Ew20Kh33lFEaUXW1rGNw,1,0,4,ZXeAEZGpV_OgiCjN3H9z3g

Food quality is consistently good (nothing off about the steak burrito), and the guy noticed immediately when the tortilla ripped when he was wrapping up my burrito and exchanged it for a new one. Would've been a pain to have started eating it and then realize the tortilla was ripped. Employees there are super friendly, I know the guy was probably being polite when he said I looked nice but hey, if someone gives you a sweet compliment as you're buying lunch it's an added bonus and makes me feel good so why not? :) 

Located inside the Fashion Show Mall next to a few other food places (Panda Express is right next to it), it's a convenient location within walkable distance from many hotels including the Riviera.
