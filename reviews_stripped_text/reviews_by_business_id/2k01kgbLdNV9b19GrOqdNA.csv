We order from here a couple of times a month, at least and have eaten in a few times with friends. The stromboli is HUGE and so flavorful. My husband is a vegetarian but also allergic to spinach so they're nice enough to sub out the spinach for broccoli for him. 
My favorite (I admit my taste in pizza is boring) is the pepperoni and I've also had the pepperoni calzone. Oh, and the penne vodka is seriously good as well. I admit I like the one I make a little better but when I don't feel lime making it, theirs is a perfect sub in.

OLDER REVIEW:

We ordered two pizzas.  I wouldn't get either one again.  One was a deep-dish cheese pizza.  It was flavorless.  I can't remember the last time I had pizza that didn't really taste like anything.  Once in awhile I would taste a tiny bit of flavor (where there was a very small amount of seasoning).  I lifted up the melted cheese and didn't really see any sauce except for on one or two slices.  For me, the sauce is 75% of the pizza.  Pizza #1 just tasted like hot dough.  But. hey, at least it wasn't burned or undercooked!

The other pizza had a super thick cream-like substance that just completely coated the entire pizza.  We thought it looked kind of unappetizing. I've never had a ""white pizza"" like this before.   It didn't taste gross, but we felt that it was too rich.  However, at least the pizza had flavor!   We aren't going to finish the cheese pizza (no point in ingesting all those calories if we aren't tasting anything), but we'll finish this one.  But only one slice at a time.  

Ending on a more positive note... the delivery guy was friendly and the order came in a reasonable amount of time.  So that's good.  Other people seem to like this place, so perhaps you will, too!",wEEZ_PVlMS-nDtbpzhB4hQ,0,0,4,Zn430mdk2JMdccjvDyzXhA

Once you go inside even at the decor is not that great but once you order the food you will be very very surprised. We had the pizza a couple weeks ago and it wasn't to my liking but a lot of people really like it. But last night I had the linguini with White clam sauce and I was just blown away. It was so good, huge portion, super flavorful and the pasta tasted like it was homemade but I'm not sure that it is. Really really friendly people looks like a family organization so I'm always happy to support local business. And they have Coke products which is important to me if you read my reviews. Again kind of a weird do you know off the strip funky kind of place but if you have a car looking for straight up Italian and not a lot of pretense or even that nice a place then this is the place to go.",9Hv16RYnYAoMlzm5wRxkAQ,0,0,4,gYhvXU-R6WwIPU5-82GI1w

Both were very good and you cannot beat the price......both meals with a drink for under $20. Thanks to Yelpers for the spot on reviews.",EGoi9oWdh74BuFcTakjJBw,0,0,4,gW69C21YHu8OU3tc7A8WGg

Service is good and New York style pizza is the best.  Order before you come pick up or have delivered if you don't like the Commercial Center.  Lots of room and plenty of parking make this good for anytime of day or night when it's open.,WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,0,0,4,r0goRk-NcJjXruf2NvfxZQ

Dough made from scratch.  Their standard cheese pizza is excellent and also tried their buffalo chicken pizza which was also excellent.  I hope more people discover this place.",_nrUhoV7DRrPocrmC-SLtQ,0,1,4,p1WoATr_stLcAD23-l2ofA

I did a phone order of their house pizza which allowed me to select up to six toppings. At the price it was at, and the large size it came as, it was so worth it. I also ordered the chicken wings and asked to have it half BBQ, and the other half hot. Both were your typical BBQ and hot flavored sauce, nothing special. But the chicken pieces were on the bigger side, and quite filling. It took us 15 min to drive there, and by the time we walked through the front door, our food was packaged up and ready to go. Overall, great food and excellent customer service.

P.S. Check in for the free bread!",J3ykuVkcYsttcksT_fIbpw,0,0,5,T6FqLS9MaRWAmzd9tMGSnQ
