The staff was friendly. I thought the sauce creation was interesting and the sauces were good. I was not crazy about the meat selection. For the same price their competitors offer shrimp, scallops, and more chicken and pork types. It was 9.99 for one bowl, and 14.99 for all you can eat. After they give you rice with the meal there's no way I could do all you can eat.

870391,2018-01-05,0,eV-5b1Bjtnn-QePN3t3taQ,"This review is regarding the business. First off, for the price of the lunch 9.99, the food was not bad. This is why I'm giving 2 stars. As a business...I'd give zero if I could. 
To start off, they do not have labels for any of their selections. Is it steak, is it pork? I'm not sure. They have a nice sauce combo chart however with the sauces not being labeled, it was of no use. 
Now for the check. Took forever, then when I had a question about it, waited for over 3 min before having to go find the waiter. I had noticed my wife and I were charged a kids lunch (5.99) which our son who is only 2 did not eat a lunch. When I asked the waiter about this she informed me that my son shared some of my food so had to pay. Excuse me?! If this is the restaurants policy why had she not told us that at the beginning when we told her he will just have a few bites of our food! She took the charge off but let me know moving forward, if he shares we must pay. Let her know that's ok because we will not be back. 
So be warned! If you have a young child who will not be eating a lunch, touches some of your food be prepared to pay 5.99 for eating something you already paid for! I expressed to her that the food on the plate would have been eaten one way or another by myself, and it is mot AYCE so why did it matter I shared some. Her answer was ""if someone shared food, they will be charged"" this is absurd!! I've never been treated this was at any restaurant over my 2 year old son taking a couple bites off my plate!

The service was good and our waiter was helpful, although they are mostly there for drinks and special requests, as you're the one putting your bowl together and taking it to the grill.

If you've never been to a Mongolian grill before, it's a fun experience. I was trying to keep my options light and I believe you can do that here. However, I must have not put enough sauce on my bowl at the end of it (you need sauce no matter what to grill it - it cooks like stir fry) so the grill guys ended up torching my meal with their oil anyway. I wasn't warned that they would do that so my meal was super oily and although it was tasty, it wasn't what I was going for.

The bowls they give you seem small at first, but they end up being the right amount. My table mates liked it a lot and I'm sure we'll go back at some point, but I'm not craving it, if that makes sense!",74sdrfg2SFhH3kAslZjjrg,2,0,3,d91L2oHodLgpqdJyjpbg_A

Then you wait in line to get your meal stir fry on the grill. 

It's wonderful seeing how they do an amazing job making sure the meat is thoroughly cooked while the veggies stay crisp. They ask if you would like white rice or brown rice with your meal, and they serve the Mongolian Noodles on a nice big plate. They even have a few extra sauces on the side like Sweet Chili, Sriracha, Garlic Chili, Hoisin Sauce, Teriyaki, Honey, and they have Sesame Seeds to add more flavor to your meal which I think is a bonus!

I came around lunch time ($9.99) and I enjoyed everything. I had Stir Fry Chicken with Mushroom, Zucchini, Green & Red Bell Pepper, Baby Corn, Water Chestnut mix with House made Sauce, Garlic, Pineapple, and Sesame Oil.

One was that meat, chicken and pork was all frozen which added a bit too much water to the dish. The second, was the selection of sauces. They had only a handful of flavors and none of which really came through on the main dishes. My third issue, was a lack of spice a station which would have aided in the flavor palet of the overall dish. My last issue was the rice, the brown was VERY dry and looked as it had been sitting in the rice cooker for about 3 HRS too long.

Secondly,  once I got all my ingredients in my bowl I had to project my voice towards the kitchen to find the cook to cook my food. My food was terribly OVER COOKED,  dry,  and unappealing at all and I was hungry.  I was watching the cook as he cooked it and he literally stepped away from the grill for almost 5 minutes as my food incinerated.  And it wasn't just my food.  My husband and son's dish was also well done to the point of crispyness.  Yoy dint need to be a culinary chef graduating from Culinary Institute of America to know when your grill is too hot you lower it.  I will not be returning coupon or not and deter everyone and anyone from coming here. Again, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY... so sad...",154yADsdXX8RtSjkmA7qDQ,0,0,1,k-0b2kVOafea2rWj1cWOYA

The restaurant is clean with plenty of tables.  The window allows you to look into the grilling area as they cook your creation.  I think they should have walled off the area where the sink and supplies are kept.  It wasn't appealing to see that part of the back area.  

I have been to several other Mongolian BBQ restaurants.  This one failed in comparison.  I didn't feel as if they had enough options as far as meat and vegetable options.  They also didn't offer seafood choices for lunch.  I'm not sure if they offer it for dinner.  They really lacked on sauces and didn't have any dry seasonings either.  

My creation for lunch was ok. The sauces they offer didn't add any great flavor even with 4-5 ladles of their options.  One bowl was plenty for me as I piled my ingredients before handing it over to cook.  It's 9.99 for one bowl or 13.99 for AYCE if you're really hungry.

The bowls are a bit shallow and piling on noodles lady is NOT advised. They stir fried my food up and offered a selection of brown or white rice. I ended up loving my plate but felt I hadn't gotten enough noodles so I requested an additional bowl. This time I got a small portion of noodles to add to my first dish.

This was my first time at a Mongolian grill, such as this, and I must say I like it. The concept: you get a bowl and fill it with meat (beef, chicken, turkey) and add veggies. The veggie selection is fresh and respectable, including spinach, water chestnuts, tomatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, and on and on...There's also the odd choice of adding sausage and pepperoni to your bowl. Finally, you add your sauce, you can wing it or they have recommendations. Take your bowl to the counter, and they stir fry it for you and serve it with rice. I saw others eating noodles, so it looks like you can request. 

As mentioned, this was my first time at a place like this. The waitress was super friendly. I grabbed a table and she came out to explain how it all works, then brought my cooked dish to me. Maybe it was because it was my first time, but she came to the table while I was eating offered to let me fill another bowl since my first didn't have a lot in it. Definitely a nice gesture of going above and beyond in customer service. 

The price is $10 for the bowl + $3 for drink at lunch, which gets you 1 bowl. And for dinner, it's $14 + drink for AYCE.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,0,0,5,3Xt2fevulqZjK3nASXl2WA

They were also SUPER slow -- I went up for a second bowl, and I waited fifteen minutes at the window before having to leave (and wasting a whole bowl of uncooked food) because I had to get somewhere. The selection of items is pretty small and random for a Mongolian Grill -- for some reason, they had pepperoni, pizza sausage, and cubes of ham, but no seafood, and a small selection of vegetables. There's also a sneeze guard over the food items, but it's so low that you have to basically put your face on the glass to reach many of the sauces.

I kind of remembered this place on Flamingo a few years ago, but I'm more impressed with the new owners, and how much they cared about their customers, and the details on how they conduct their business.

I have to admit, I really don't like the location of this place, because it kind of tucked away, but it's a manageable drive to get here from Henderson.  If you think about it, it's only a five minute drive from terminal 3 at the airport.  

When we got to Stir Krazy, we were greeted by the owner, and he walked through the selection process of how to put the bowls together.   What caught my eyes was the freshness and selection of the vegetables to choose from, but what separate this place from the other Mongolian bbq places around the area were the sauces.  On the boards above the bar is a listing of on how to make a several different sauces for your BBQ.  The process to cook your BBQ is a couple of minutes, and then you're ready to eat.

The sauce were more light oil based, and not a powder deal I remember eating at a few other places.  Stir Krazy sauces were light, and complimented each bite without overwhelming your taste buds with that heavy soy sauce taste that most people experience at other places.  Too me, it's the sauces that make or break a Mongolian BBQ, and Stir Krazy does a great job of creating it. 

The workers at this family owned business cared about our visit with them, and check on us about four times while we where there.  Even though Restaurant.com got us there, I will visit this place soon....maybe next week.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,1,2,5,FQL6gc4EJcTih7hGP8O7Tg

You can purchase a one-time plate or for a couple dollars more you can get an All-You-Can-Eat deal.  Definitely worth doing the AYCE option, IMHO.

There are many options for meat, noodles, veggies, and sauces.  Grab a bowl and create your own meal.  I like this because you can experiment with flavors each time.

Once you are happy with your creation, one of the cooks will take it to the grill and cook it thoroughly.  Then you get a plate and have the option of white or brown rice (I went with the brown - very good).

The dining area is very nice - casual, but with an upscale feel to it.  Nice atmosphere and plenty of room for groups.

They have brown or white rice options.  The veggies are super fresh and I particularly like their orange colored lo mein noodles. My only complaint is when your bowl fills up, it's really hard to keep stuff from falling off and it starts to fall either in other food items on the serving line or it falls on the floor. My suggestion is to put the noodles in the bowl first, then fill up your meats and veggies. The time it took to cook our food was really fast but they had just opened so there wasn't alot of patrons dining yet. Overall, a good price for lunch and we will be back.

Mongolian grill is not a food I would eat everyday. Yet this shop does an excellent job in providing a place for this type of venue.  

I am quite pleased this location is easy to find on the Southeast side of the Vegas Valley, which I like exploring.  I dislike driving in the crowded Northwest/Summerlin area of the valley.

It's a casual but well decorated little spot tucked in kind of a dark (but not unsafe) strip mall behind a gas station. As a first time visitor, I was unsure whether I was supposed to wait or seat myself. 

It was dinner time, so I had to pay for the all-you-can-eat, even though 1 trip to the bar was enough to fill me. I also had to pay the AYCE price for 1 to-go box. (Lunch offers a discount for only 1 trip). 

Items at the bar were very fresh. The selection was good but not great, especially for veggies and sauces. They serve rice on the side, or you can ask to have it cooked in (which I did - it was tasty this way!). The food was good, the service was friendly but not always available. 

I had a Restaurant.com voucher, but my total didn't reach the $30 minimum. The ""waitress"" allowed me to use it but subtracted the difference (with my pre-approval). 

I would suggest a few additional veggie options, and a hostess or somebody to help direct when you first enter.... at minimum better signage to seat yourself, etc. I also recommend a few more posted ""recipes"" for sauce-combos.

We got our bowls together and took them
up to the cook, who greeted us with a smile and asked if we wanted rice with our plates. We waited only about 2 minutes before our food was ready to eat. I'm sure they get busy at times and you may have to wait a little longer. We had a very enjoyable experience however, the reason for my 4 out of 5 stars is due to the fact that in past experiences the typical dinner pricing is $11-$12 for all you can eat and comes with a side of soup, salad and stuff-able flat breads.

The all you can eat option is $14.99 and a much better value but you have to stay there and eat. So to pay $10.99 x 2 to make a decent no carb meal is just not worth it. Hopefully they find a better solution or offer different sized bowls and change like $4-5 extra for a bigger size.",rmnEwVndX_nrSn8s6sWoiA,0,0,3,kp8heaKsZFNpum0CyrWvSg

The ingredients are good, fresh, and well-stocked, but no better or worse than any other Mongolian stir-fry place I've been to anywhere else in the country. The service isn't all that friendly either. We went in 45 minutes before closing and the staff seemed eager to get us (and the 3 other tables dining) out the door. For the price - and in the spirit of AYCE - we expected the full 45 minutes before the staff was ready to pack up and clean the station, the floor, etc. The sauces are good though. I like spice and flavor and some other places' sauces are too sweet and limited; these sauces have depth and offer good customization. The noodles are also a nice texture; they don't get mushy when stir-fried.

I can't imagine anyone getting the non-AYCE portion and thinking they were getting a good deal, but it can be a healthier option than lots of other places (depending on what you select). I'll go back if I really crave it... Spending ~$20pp w/drinks/tip can go a long way other places.",0daa3lYsz2iFumNX-Ay3Qg,0,0,3,bVbsLjvR03gANWe4x_RMhQ

Was willing to pay the $14 for the experience of getting to go out dining rather than take out. The place was so hot I felt sick, the music was loud 80s hair metal that I didn't need during dinner (I do like ""welcome to the jungle"" just not during dinner),  and the giant screen featuring the latest awful news was depressing and in my face.  Unfortunately, the grill is far behind the counter so the experience of watching your food get cooked did not really happen as I'm used to it. The food was ok as far as generic American Asian food goes, but lacked the sauce I love so much that I'm used to in the bay area.  To be fair, I only wanted one serving of noodles so the all you can eat was not the selling point for me that it might be for others.

You can also add Brown or White rice (about an ice cream scoops worth). Dinner is $13.99 AYCE with No to go boxes. Makes sense. Kids 10 and under are $5.99 for lunch and $8.99 for dinner. This is a bit high for kids meals, but it is AYCE so if you have a hungry kid then come here. My kids wouldn't eat enough for the $8.99 dinner to be worth it. They do charge $2.49 for a drink with free refills. I guess this is where they get you because I think this is high for a drink so you may want to stick with water. I was celebrating a friends birthday lunch and this was her choice. I was a little intimidated at first because I didn't know the system. I was fortunate to have come with people who knew what to do. It is not a hard concept to get down and there are people that are there to help you if you don't know what is in the buffet.   The only bad thing which is pretty much my fault is that I have been using the Myfitnesspal app to record my meals and calories and I had no idea what to put in there because I couldn't remember what I stacked on! I just kept putting meat, veggies and then the noodles. It was so yummy I don't really much care. Maybe add some nutrition information right in front of my face so I stick with more veggies next time! I will be back and I will recommend for my International students to stop by as well. It's close by and a good value. The restaurant is also a decent size with a good table layout to accommodate a lot of people.

It's what you would expect from a Mongolian BBQ style place. They have a decent selection of meats and veggies, however the selection of sauces is not the best. They also only have 1 style of noodles. 

One bowl was 9.99 and all you can eat was like $13.99 I believe. I bit more than other places I've been to. You also have to wait for the server to bring you the bowls you can't just get them yourself. 

Service was friendly however the guy at the grill seemed to always be busy doing other stuff when I showed up. Maybe because it's a small place and there was only maybe 2 other people there.

Some Mongolian grill restaurants charge more, some charge less.  Some have more ingredients to go with your stir fry, like noodles, fried rice, or tortillas.  Some have more options like a salad bar.  This one is simple.  

They have a selection of meats, beef, chicken, pork, turkey.  Then they have assorted veggies, and a couple of more meat options- sausage made to look like ground beef, pepperoni, and ham.  Then they have a bowl of noodles which seem like pasta noodles.  Lastly they have their limited sauce options.  

For what they have, it is good food at a decent price.  If you go home hungry or not satisfied it is not their fault.  When the craving for a good Mongolian Stir Fry occurs, this place should definitely be on your list.

Compared to all the mongolian restaurants i have ever been this one is pretty good for a couple reasons.  First It has a large selection of ingredients.  
Thats really important in any buffet style retaurant.  They had your normal stuff, but a lot of extras you dont normally see like tofu, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, zucchinis, red bell peppers, spinach and some weird ones like pepperoni, sausage bits.  They even offered brown rice.  Second, the ingredients were super fresh.  The meat wasnt chewy and tasted tender.  It didnt have the rough consistency or dryness of poor meat cuts.  They had the standard selection, beef chicken turkey and pork.  

Onto The areas that could be improved.  I didnt like the curry sauce at all.  Wish They could have added some fruit and salad area.  But thats not usually found in a mongolian bbq.  They didnt have the traditional sesame bun but thats also not a big deal.  

Overall you notice the small nuances this place offers that are different.  And thats what makes it stand out.  All for 13.99, not bad for all you can eat.  Having said that, after the first two bowls my enjoyment went down significantly.  I realized as much as i liked mongolian bbq its not a cuisine i would eat often.  But this place is definitley the place for me to go if i feel like mongolian.

Now i went for dinner so between the 9.99 per bowl vs Ayce, i think ayce is the way to go. But for lunch they probably need to get a lunch special price.  9.99 is really a forced upsell.  But im hardly ever going for ayce for lunch, so i think they are hurting their own lunch business as i would only come here for dinner.",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,2,1,5,42f4y-RvoYzdz3mibbc_uQ

We love the food and the different sauce and ways to load your bowl recipes on the wall are awesome for new ways to work your selections. The owner is as sweet as can be and always looks for ways to improve her offerings.  Don't miss the peanuts as they add great flavor to all the different styles of stir fry.  The noodles are my absolute favorite and swirl them up on the tongs so they fit masterfully on the top of my pile of meat and veggies for my perfect plate of yumminess. I also love the hot and spicy sauce recipe with the garlic, spice and pineapple all blended together.  I never feel like their recipes lead to oily stir fry and there is always amazing flavor.  The freeze frozen meat (chicken, beef, pork, turkey and maybe I am forgetting some) are super easy and when cooked they are the best and most tender pieces to offset all the veggies.  I also love incorporating the bean sprouts for some crunch.  I am telling you I wish the owner had a location closer to Mountains Edge as we would eat this almost twice a week if we could!  Plus it is all you can eat for dinner (lunch is one visit /plate) and can be a healthy dinner options for those watching carbs and eating lots of protein as you can forgo the rice.

The ingredients are always very fresh and the kitchen area is open, not cluttered, and very clean.  The way it works is you are given a bowl in which you can fill it up as much as you want with the variety of meats, veggies, and sauces available.  After building your bowl, just hand it to the staff behind the counter and they will cook it for you on the huge grill (which will only take maybe between 3-5 minutes to cook).  Lastly, the staff will ask if you would like a scoop of white or brown rice to enjoy your stir fry with.  The first round, I decided to have the stir fry with the Go Lo Mein noodles.  Second round, I decided to have a scoop of rice instead of the noodles.  Third round, I just had the meat and veggie stir fry without rice or noodles.  In any case, it was delicious.  The sauces are amazing here.  They have something that's sure to suit everyone's own tastes.  The sauces available are fire, hot, pineapple, curry, garlic, sweet, house, soybean oil, and sesame oil.  Mix and match 'um and have fun creating your own unique personalized stir fry flavors!  I personally love the house, garlic, sesame, and soybean oil in my stir fry.

It's not your typical restaurant. More like a take out Chinese style sit in with about 12 tables. 
Fairly clean and staff seemed nice but the food was just plain and very average. 
The decor doesn't resemble that of a Mongolian grill, more just that Las Vegas theme.

They do not give you many choices to work with as far as food. What choices they did give you all seem to be frozen, not fresh. All the meat and half the veggies were all frozen. 
Lack of sauce choices leave for more improvement. They all seem to be really watered down, and have little to no flavor. You have to use a handful or more of sauce and at that point it is so watery the flavor it does have runs off of the food and onto the plate.
Only flavor comes from honey or sweet chili bottles located on the counter.

Rice is really really dry. Also lacks flavor. 
For the number of stars I was expecting alot better.
Didn't even bother finishing a full plate. Paid, and went elsewhere.  

The person I went with seemed to like it, but agreed it doesn't get 4+ stars.

Probably won't return. Not my cup of tea.",NoEblq6Sgkn9sab99zCXCg,1,0,2,JA8DmcxQrkzNNC7xcqohwg

The place itself is tucked away in a plaza that doesn't have much going on. No wonder I've passed it without realizing it's existence. Anyway, the place is SUPER clean. You can tell they really care about appearances, which is great. 

The people working were also really nice and fast with service, even during dinner rush. After telling them that I had never been there before, the waiter told me what to do and proceeded to take care of the husband and I with quickness and hospitality. The man working the grill was also nice, fast, and efficient. 

I've never been a fan of AYCE to be honest, since usually by the second plate, my stomach decides it wants to kill me, so coming to dinner here was a mistake. All dinner is AYCA and lunch is one bowl. Lunch is good enough for me!

As far as the food goes, I see people saying that there wasn't a lot of variety here, but it seemed like plenty to a Mongolian BBQ noob like myself. The main meats were turkey, pork, chicken, and beef. Chicken all the way, baby!  

As far as food quality goes, it's hard to rate, considering you are the one in charge of making your own food. If you suck at making food choices, it sucks. User error. Of you magically come across a killer combo of mouth explosion flavors, then it's great. 

All and all, it was okay. I feel like it was a wee bit to expensive to come to for dinner if you aren't going to scarf down a lot if food, but the lunch price is typical.

It's pretty much exactly the same restaurant as before, just in a new location. The ambiance does benefit from the new location though; bright inside, but not blinding, like the last location could get. 

They have a great selection of meats and veggies, and everything has always seemed very fresh. If you aren't familiar with this style of restaurant, your server gives you a bowl to take to a buffet to choose your meat, veggies, noodle, and sauce, whatever you want. Then you hand it to the wok attendants, and they cook it up. You pretty much can't go wrong, and I'd say half the fun is trying to stack your bowl as high as you can  - although for $14 for all-you-can-eat, there's really no need to. But when it comes to the $9 lunch bowl, challenge accepted.

Service was quick. Clean restaurant. Nice decor. I went during a non-busy lunch hour and was greeted within meetings. You seat yourself. If you're looking for a quick bite and you're in the area, you should stop by Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill.

For $9.99, you get a 24 oz. bowl, which you can fill up with meats, vegetables, orange noodles and a wide variety of sauces. The bean sprouts and mushrooms didn't look too fresh, but the rest of the toppings looked okay. I used 3 scoops of house, 2 scoops of garlic, 2 scoops of sweet and 1 scoop of sesame oil. I skipped the white rice. 

Within minutes, the server cooked my bowl on his grill and transferred it onto a plate once it was finished. They have a lot of Asian condiments (i.e Sriracha, Garlic Chili Sauce, etc) too. I loved my dish! It was flavorful and packed a punch. 

It was a good experience though! Pricing-wise, it is a bit on the steeper end for Mongolian BBQ if you just get one bowl. I'd reccomend the AYCE if you're super hungry!
