I asked at the register if they had relish, ketchup, etc., she said it would be in the bag. When I picked up my order after a long wait I asked about condiments and another person said they were in the bag too. I walked all the way to the gate only to find no condiments!

They were cheap on the napkins. Only gave three small ones for two hot dogs and chicken strips.

The chicken strips were over cooked. Considering they packed our hot dogs right away, before the strips were even in the fryer, there should have been no excuse. Oh, and they gave me the wrong dipping sauces!

Speaking of packing the hot dogs way too early, the one that had kraut on it had a soggy bun by the time we got to the gate to eat it, which was only a few minute walk.

This was my 2nd experience with Nathan's and 2nd disappointment. Considering how much I like hot dogs, I'll have to seriously rethink whether it's worth it to go to the Coney Island location.

I ordered the burger and onion rings and my fiancé the grilled chicken sandwich. I can't speak for him but the burger was extremely dry and flavorless. The onion rings were pathetic as well. One of the rings I had was the very outside skin of the onion. It was extremely tough.

The last time I came through McCarren with my kids I dropped 70 bucks on food. Rather than stage an impromptu hunger strike, we decided on the two hot dog meal (two of them) and some bacon cheese fries.

The hot dogs were Costco quality in taste but not in size. (So, yes, they tasted like hot dogs, and for reference, they were bigger than my middle finger, which I checked out of curiosity only.)

For the chicken sandwich, after the first bite, I was shocked by how hard the outer crispy batter was and it was hard to swallow. Then I had a second bite, the chicken tasted chewy. How did they make it like that? To be honest, I had never had the crispy chicken sandwich like that before. I was so afraid to get sick so I threw the rest of the food away.

""Since we're an airport location, everything has to be more expensive!  *BULLSHIT*.  Nothing justifies more cost.  But GREED always comes into play with ""captured audiences"", also like concert or festival sites, malls, etc.  It's all *Bullshit*.

SERVICE

And sometimes therr are just times you feel like an explanation of logic & common measurements of time, would have more impact if shared with a brick wall.
