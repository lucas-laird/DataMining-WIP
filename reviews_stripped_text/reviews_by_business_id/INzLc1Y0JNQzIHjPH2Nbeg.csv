I ordered the chicken nachos and the new seasonal chicken salad. The salad was served in a stainless steel mixing bowl. It was cold, fresh and very good. The chicken nachos were decent, the portions were huge and the prices are cheap most items were $2-8. This is a Mexican/American fast food causal dinning restaurant. Menu has tacos, burritos, nachos, and salads. Easy to order, they have a huge menu on the wall. You can choose to go orders or seat yourself either inside or outside. The inside self dinning area was good size, the floors and tables were all clean and the huge windows makes the area fell very open. 

If you are looking for a fast meal in a clean restaurant under $10 this is a good option.",IhwH_mJ-E0vVpLFG8leZvg,0,0,4,RXChtbqrBBLRcy0jwLWHWw

 I had taco plate the 1st time I came, i really enjoyed the brisket, great flavor!..but chicken one was bland. The refried beans were really tasty, but the rice was cold in temperature and underwelming. The 2nd visit i had the $1.00 ground beef tacos on Tuesday. Major disappointment. Barely had any meat or lettuce in them and some sort of weird tasting sauce at the bottom, unless it was lard or something. Really gross. My 3rd visit I chose breakfast. Smart idea! I ordered chilaquiles and a cheese quesadilla. Delicious! It was the biggest of portions Ive ordered here, amd the tastiest. Id return for just that meal alone.

Ordered taco combo plate with fried fish and shrimp and the fish look kinda strange, shaped more like chicken tender.  Took first bite and I noticed the meat was kinda hard and dry.  Informed guy at counter that I assumed was Manager, he had blue polo, that they might of made mistake with my order.  He tells me they don't make fried chicken tacos, well sir, I guess today you do now.
Showed him my order and he said they might of over cooked it and just walked away without even apologizing or offerinvvvg to remake.  Took another bite and there was no way it was fish.  Even if you over cook fish, it will not turn hard or chewy.  I work in the food and beverage industry for over 20yrs so I would know when something like this is wrong. 
Really disappointed that they made no effort to make things right.  Come on, what's the food cost on a fish taco, probably less than  $1.  And they couldn't even offer to remake one.",qbsk-DAOt1hPdG3x18bAuw,1,0,1,I08iCM9jtjSCOhzfudXfSA

Two of us got the combo plates, our kids got the chicken strips and potatoes while I went with the brisket burrito""smothered "" in the fire roasted ""sauce"". I loved the fact that there were so many options from the beans to the rice and the variety of ways to combine them. However, once the food arrived at our table, the illusion war was over and we were all left disappointed and feeling a little sick. 

My daughter absolutely loves chicken. To watch her spit the food out and look at me as if I forced her to eat mud should have been a sign, but unfortunately we pushed on. The food was like warm at best and my burrito was never even made. When we brought this to their attention, they were not apologetic in the least and quite obviously slapped it together in an attempt to prevent further complaints. Oh.. And that fire roasted sauce... It's nothing more than a small bottle of store brand chunky salsa dumped on top of a disappointing burrito filled with meat that they had the audacity to call brisket.

Feta cheese... On Mexican food.. Seriously? It's a moment where a restaurant tried to get cute and failed miserably. 

It's a shame this place couldn't hit the mark and being that they are sandwiched between two of our absolute favorite places to eat makes me think Fuzzy's is headed for a disastrous fate.

But over several visits and a sampling of many menu items, their service is above and beyond.. but their food just isn't very good. It's unfortunate because the dishes sound great but the actual product is lackluster.

- As many other reviews mention, tortillas are cold and seem store bought. They also have very little protein. If tacos are your specialty, why are they your worst item?!
+ Tortillas and portions aside, the brisket tacos are fairly good and I don't find them easily in town. That is probably my protein of choice here.
+ Oh, and opt for the California Heat style if you're doing shrimp, otherwise it's pretty plain.
+ Their Baja tortilla soup is thick and chunky like a stew, and actually really good. Recommend this, would order again.
+ They have breakfast tacos!! And they're served at all hours!!
- But they were really disappointing. Aside from the cold tortilla, they scramble the toppings into the egg, which isn't what I'm used to. The egg looks and tastes like it was cooked on a filthy flattop. Why do something if you don't do it well?!
+ While not difficult to execute, their salads are pretty good and the avocado dressing is hands down the best I've tried.
- But splurge for shrimp, because the shredded chicken is super dry
- No salsa bar?! Their branded bottles on the table are more for flavor and not heat, and made me think of an upgraded version of the stuff in Taco bell packets.

Fuzzy's is more Tex-Mex style than anything else, and I absolutely love it.

Things to try:
- nachos
- chips and salsa / queso (their chips have this addicting seasoning)
- chicken enchiladas

   It was dead inside while the other restaurants nearby were packed. So we knew it would be quick to grab n go.
   The service when we walked in, horrible off the back! The small man cashier just stood there staring at us, no greet or even a simple nod. Lol, like we should've left right then n there. 
   Since it was our first time, I asked if everything was ala carte or if they had combo meals or deals. This jerk off had the nerve to point at the menu on the wall with a smug face. Didn't even say anything, what a *****. If I wasn't starving, I would've taken off, but like I said nearby restaurants were packed.
   Finally after ordering, waiting and a buzzer he gave us went off, we walked to the counter to show him it signaled us. This jerk made us walk to the kitchen window in the back to grab our own food. I asked for extra sauce and he said there should be a packet in each box. I walked to the soda machine where I saw sauce containers, sat at a table, filled up my own sauces for my to go order. 
   No wonder this place is doing horrible. There were 2 people at their generic bar who looked like they were getting loaded for free. And one very nice old couple who left while we left. Other than that, no one in that huge space. 
   Get a new staff or run your business to nothing. Your star rating already shows your current standing. I'll check back in, maybe in a month. I'll have whoever I'm with do another rating. 
   FOODIES: For those who are concerned about how the food tasted. We ordered a steak burrito, chicken taco combo and chicken enchiladas combo. They forgot the toppings in our burrito, avocado and sour cream (requested). The taco combo was maybe average. Enchiladas tasted healthy, unexpected. Overall freshness of food was decent. I would like to day the Buchanan (sp) beans were pretty good for beans. 
   I would like to say, the cook or chef who handed us the meal (when we walked to the back of the dead restaurant) was extremely nice with a friendly smile. Sad, the nicest person is probably their hardest working (the cook) kept in the back. Then they go and put some rude white guy up front who gets to make tips and ruin their business.
   I wonder if the guy up front was the manager or just a cashier because I didn't see a manager up front, only what looked like a waiter sweeping around tables. If he's management then this place is in big trouble!!",G-lXqfGcJDRmi2iUXuj8Bw,0,0,1,UAkq-1MiDa1mQXAxA_xXpw

Chips and Queso with Chorizo (or without meat)
Tempura Fish Tacos (flour)
Shredded Chicken Nachos

Then take the ""Butt Burnin' Sauce"" sitting at your table and pour it all over everything.

Side note: My wife and I went to TCU in Fort Worth, TX, which is where Fuzzy's got its start. The original location on Berry Street (pretty much on campus) was basically our second home. Since we moved to Henderson, we've sorely missed the Tex-Mex we loved so dearly. Fuzzy's has now filled that culinary void in our lives 

My Fuzzy's faves include: chips & queso (preferably with chorizo), chicken nachos, pretty much all of their tacos, chicken and beef fajitas, the enchilada platter, pretty much all of their breakfast tacos, and their sopapilla chips. Plus, I was elated to learn that the Vegas location has Shiner Bock on tap. If you've never heard of Shiner Bock, give it a try - you won't be disappointed! It's one of the best beers to come out of the state of Texas - ever. No joke.

This restaurant is in an awesome, brand new shopping complex, and it's exceptionally clean and modern. It's quite spacious, too, and it's got an awesome patio - perfect for our mild ""winter."" The staff is super friendly, and the owner / manager, Christopher, is an awesome guy. If you have a question or an issue during your visit, he'll go out of his way to make it right.

On Tuesday they have $1 beef, chicken, and spicy pork tacos and you can get it on soft, corn, or hard shell tortilla which is nice. Most taco deals really limit you , however Fuzzy's has a nice little selection. The tacos were filled with meat which I thought was a excellent thing and 3 tacos made me pretty full. 

The establishment is clean and they have friendly team members and they have tv's which is a plus if you want to catch a game. The environment has a great chill vibe and you can go there with a group and enjoy yourself and if you plan on being loud there is a patio to use as well. Matter fact behind me there was a lady who was having a party all by herself and it was pretty funny, if I didn't have to run I would have joined her because she was really enjoying her own company. 

I would definitely come back on a Tuesday and enjoy the $1 tacos and next time I go I will be sure to try some other stuff on the menu.

We're always in search of good Mexican food in Las Vegas and decided we had to give Fuzzy's a try. I should've known that it wasn't going to be very good when we checked out their website and they were advertising a sandwich. Not exactly a Mexican food staple. The establishment was very clean but I would expect it to be since it's pretty new. The food in itself wasn't very good. A few things that led to my lower rating are listed below:

1) Salsa wasn't really salsa, basically tasted like Cholula hot sauce. 

2) Tacos were very flat and lacked substance. See the attached picture. 

3) Enchiladas were very sparsely filled with meat and very small in size. 

4) Flavor of the dishes was not at all authentic and reminiscent of canned enchilada sauce.

I came here on a whim because I heard on Tuesdays it is $.99 tacos.

Now the options were either shredded chicken, pork, or ground beef. What I'm use too is the option of flour or corn tortilla, then the normal fuzzy fixings (lettuce pico feta garlic sauce and cilantro). Now I can't say if they were exactly what I'm use too because....when they gave them to me they were completely falling apart when I opened them up. It's like whoever made it, just threw some things on a tortilla rolled it a bit and wrapped it in aluminum foil. I was a little off out but that only because I had to eat it on the go and most of the filling was coming out. They were pretty inconsistent in flavor too. Some had more cheese some had more lettuce some had barely any cilantro. I was disappointed in that as well. But even though they were made shitty the flavor was still pretty good. I appreciated it the extra hot sauce in my bag too. Service was quick and efficient. I mean they did actually make it and get it to me quickly. They just.....didn't execute it that well?

Not only did the beer add a unique flavor but bacon was also simmered along with the beans. I'll admit the fat content may be higher do to the bacon, but damn it...ITS BACON . Highly recommended when you visit. The next item was Mix-Mex rice. Their version of fried rice...Not a fan. I'll explain why, first omit the peas and carrots (blah) needs some peppers, onions or something other then peas and carrots. The rice seem crunchy as in not fully cooked. Overall flavor was bland, especially after tasting the beans. Now the main course, the fajitas. Very good in fact everything you'd come to expect from a fajita.

4182721,2016-10-20,0,INzLc1Y0JNQzIHjPH2Nbeg,"TL;DR: Del taco and Taco Bell are about on par. 

Well, this place isn't horrible, but it is very middle of the road mediocre. I tried the nachos with shredded chicken, and a brisket taco.

First off with the taco. I chose a soft corn tortilla with shredded brisket. The tortilla comes out cold with cold lettuce and cold tomatoes and cold cotija cheese, but the meat is hot. The meat itself is actually kind of good. I wish it was a bit more juicy though. I like when juices are running out the back of the taco while trying to eat it. The issue with everything being cold when the meat is hot is that if you let your taco sit for 2 minutes, the meat gets cold.

Ok, for the nachos I did the shredded chicken with sour cream. I guess sour cream doesn't come standard on it? They use a liquid cheese and what tastes like a white corn tortilla chip. They put tomato and onion on top with the chicken and a dollop of sour cream on the side of the plate. 

The chips taste like store bought chips sitting under a heat lamp. The chicken was ok (again, not super juicy). Where's the guacamole? Where's the beans? Where's the crunchy chips? 

They had ""butt burning"" hot sauce on the table. I LOVE hot sauce and spicy foods. I drenched my nachos in the habenero sauce and never broke a sweat. It was about on level with Taco Bell mild sauce.

Positives? The staff is super friendly, the restaurant is really clean, and they give you a reusable cup for soda! Free refills for returning guests? No idea, but that might be cool.",1csYUsGUX4vwHH-YmRTgQg,1,0,3,eU_Ulp6ERyDQT017N4RSWQ

Both tacos were good, but the shrimp was my favorite. My plate also came with 2 sides, borracho beans (pinto beans cooked in beer w/ bacon) and cilantro-lime rice. The beans were pretty good, but I did add salt and hot sauce. The rice, however, tasted like it was straight from a box or a frozen dinner...it had a plastic taste and was just gross. I also had the chips and queso and those were the bomb diggity. They don't have a salsa bar, but their bottled hot sauce isn't bad.
The parking lot was really full, but they were pretty empty. The food came out quick and everyone was nice. The dinning room was pretty clean, but it was uncomfortably warm.

The sauce on the nachos was weird and not authentic mexican as it was some kind of garlic sauce. The queso tasted like kraft macaroni and cheese with out the noodles. Guacamole was bland. Tacos were just fine. Their tortilla chips were dusted with their own special seasoning which included paprika. I just felt like they were trying too hard and the recipes were unique and under developed, I thought it was going to be authentic mexican and it turned out to be like mexican food out of a white persons kitchen.

The staff are very friendly and helpful and the manager, who is a very nice guy, often walks around checking with customers.  Based on the food and service I give a 5 star rating, hands down. One problem is that the restaurant is a at a very popular newer strip mall that also has a Farmer Boys a Zupa's and a Pizza Rev along with some other busy stores. This strip mall has woefully inadequate parking.  For the volume of customers they would need a lot more spaces. At lunchtime you can drive around the lot for 10 minutes searching for a space. On two occasions I simply could not get parking and was frustrated with competing with other cars for any space that might open up.  So I gave up and left, which is a bummer.   The other day I parked on an adjacent street where other cars were parking.  If you go at less popular times you will be fine.

I ordered 3 hard shell tacos with sides of black beans, rice and a beer (served in a massive goblet). The tacos were mostly filled with lettuce and very little protein filling, but they were each under $3 so I can't complain too much but it did make me want to go home and make my own. The rice and beans were really salty, which is why you need all that beer! The peas in the Mexican rice were not fresh; shriveled like raisins. 

Also the self service policy is not really clear, when your buzzer goes off you go up to the kitchen window and pick up your order. I wasn't sure since I saw the cashier go up there herself a few times. Felt kind of odd to do. Each taco was in a separate basket, that seemed like a waste. I wish there were hot sauce options that were mild, they're all way too hot.

Overall I'd probably try another place for tacos in the future. They have a lot of improvement to do.",4zCEuRL-vK_9867DTuJsjQ,1,0,2,Vdbk51ar9uohbij84Fmykg

I don't know if it was because we went between lunch and dinner rush but everything was wrong. First, my tacos had burnt shrimp. Not just overcooked burnt brown all the way through. When they replaced it they were now undercooked and drenched in oil. They also call it tempura shrimp, and it's not, it's frozen popcorn shrimp like you get in a frozen kids meal.My friend got the combo and his taco shell was completely raw and stale and his shrimp were cold pre-cooked salad shrimp that were coated in a seasoning. They might have been ran under hot water but they never got close to any grill. Then the beans are canned beans that taste like they have been sitting in a warmer since Monday, and the rice tastes like one of those Uncle Bens microwave packs. 
The only redeeming thing was the queso, but it never solidified, which means it was fake cheese.

. Good Mexican food is hard to come by in Las Vegas and I was hopeful that this could be our new Mexican restaurant. The chicken was on the dry side and the guac needed salt so bad. The portion size for a side of guac was on the minuscule side.   

I am currently dairy free and I told the girl taking my order that I was, so I didn't want anything dairy on the tacos and sure enough they come out with a dairy based sauce under all the chicken that I only noticed halfway through one taco. Thankfully I am not allergic but I am nursing a baby who was sensitive to dairy so I was frustrated by that. 

The restaurant is clean and if you have a big group of people that you need seating for this place would easily facilitate that over another Mexican place in town.
