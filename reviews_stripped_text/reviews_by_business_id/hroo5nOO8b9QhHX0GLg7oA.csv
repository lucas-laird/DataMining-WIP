In fact, it's often joked that it's a good thing. The rest of our relatives are already there awaiting us, and so we quickly order our food, which arrives quickly via Hispanic servers who can say ""Pho Tai"" better than Hubby can.

My Pho' Tai Sach (rare steak with tripe pho') is average. What can I say, it's Vegas. The broth is a bit on the oily side but had a good flavor, and the noodles and meat are alright. My hubby liked his Pho' Dac Biet. 

My aunt suggested we order their Pho' Xao Thap Cam, which basically translates to ""assorted fried pho'"". This was a very interesting dish. The pho' noodles are fried to create a crunchy, chewy pancake layer on which an assortment of seafood, meats, and vegetables are placed on, and the whole thing is topped off with a sweet gravy reminiscent of Thai rad nah gravy. It wasn't out of this world, but it was pretty good. 

My cousin's verdict on his Bun Bo Hue (Hue beef noodle soup): good. 

I didn't think the Che Suong Sa Hot Luu (a Vietnamese dessert of agar and tapioca in coconut milk) was very good, as it was sparse on pretty much everything, but Hubby liked his Ca Phe Sua Da (Vietnamese Iced Coffee), which I noticed came out already in the glass.

Pho' So 1 means ""Pho' Number 1"", but I'd have to disagree when I think of all the pho' restaurants I've eaten at in SoCal. But because the food and prices are ok, this restaurant will be my go to Vietnamese restaurant for now in Vegas until we try out a few other ones there in the city.

Said Pho expert also explained that Pho is typically a breakfast item in Vietnam, so it's warm and filling, but not super heavy such that the rest of the day is shot, i.e., nap time!  That's particularly ideal for lunch time during the work week.  (Napping under your desk while boss passes by = bad news bears!) 

Apparently, this place uses less cinnamon and ginger in the Pho, so it's less ""spicy.""  That's fine by me, as I am not a fan of really spicy dishes.  (I spend more time drinking water than enjoying the food.)  Nonetheless, I still threw in a couple slices of  jalapeños into the soup for a slight kick.

271318,2016-08-14,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"WORSE bowl of pho in Vegas. I ordered the rare beef pho. It came out lukewarm, so the broth wasn't hot enough to lightly cook the rare beef like it was supposed to. The blood from the rare meat started to run and coagulate, and made my broth so unappetizing that I lost my appetite.

This wasn't a one time thing. Last time there a few months ago, although all four people in my party ordered different kinds of pho, all bowls were bathwater temp.

I asked the supervisor at cash register about the lukewarm pho. He said the kitchen didn't put enough hot broth and next time to ask the server to take my bowl back for more broth. This is just sheer laziness...

The reason pho broth isn't hot is because they didn't heat up the noodles first, and didn't put enough broth to bring all other items to temperature. If the name of your restaurant literally means ""Number 1 Pho"", they should make sure that every single pho bowl that goes out of the kitchen is steaming hot, every single time, instead of relying on customers to ask them to heat it up a bit.

The only reason we go here is because of the DIY grill (#80, they bring out everything and you cook the meat at your table). 

The staff is non-Asian but they know the menu and the wide variety of sauces well, so I was impressed with that.",5jgGp15H_0GRS_daM2AC7A,1,0,2,EmqEtfs6nrdl2Mui3WZAXw

The oil is so thick in the air and on the furnishings that (excuse me if you've heard this one before...) Exxon Valdez: the Sequel could happen at any moment if someone were to create a flicker or spark.

The food is mediocre (rough rib-eye, oily soup and vegetables anachronistic to our age), the prices fair (that's where the one star comes from) and the service non-existent. Okay, that was a hyperbole, as they brought me food and took my order prior, but nonetheless, I felt like I was in a certain Ralph Ellison novel minus the violent urge to stuff a waitstaff in my chimney. Seriously, I was treated like a negro during the antebellum South. Alas, I resist the urge to play the race card here, as I am black, and felt they treated everyone with the same disservice and surly attitudes.

443728,2017-01-27,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Worst restaurant I've ever been to. I'd recommend you go to the other nearby pho restaurants if you want decent food and service, because they lack both. For starters, I'm Vietnamese so I've been to numerous pho shops, but this is the first time there wasn't a vegetarian menu (a lot of Vietnamese people are Buddhist and follow a vegetarian diet, that's why there is always a separate menu). I would've left, but I was accompanied by 3 others that were hangry because we've been on the road for 8 hours. I politely asked if there was any way of taking meat out of a dish, and the most condescending and snobbish attitude came from our waiter. We finally settled that I could have stir fried veggies and tofu with rice, which I was thankful for. My friend ordered hot tea and got tap water with a lime slice in it.. in a plastic cup. What even? When we got our food, everything tasted terrible and not even mediocre at best. None of us finished our food. 

They didn't tell us to pay up front so when we asked for a check, we got attitude for it and then directed to the front counter. At the front counter was another rude man-child that had an equally condescending and snobbish attitude, if not worst than the waiter. He said he genuinely wanted to know about our experience. I perked up at this because I thought he was the only sincere person attending to us that night, but when we asked about why the tea was not tea, he (rudely) said it was because it was a free service, which I've never heard of- rather than giving us water with a lime slice in it when we order tea, why don't you just give us tea? We then asked why the waiter never came back to check up on us after giving us our food, then he prided himself in saying that he was an ""asshole"" like the waiter and that I should work here too, implying that I was also an asshole. 

TL;DR all of the employees need an attitude change or to find a different place to work that doesn't involve customer service, and work on making your pho taste better and not so watered down (in my case, you don't need to compensate tofu, rice, and veggies with 10lbs of salt).",nt5gmwYuXk0G5jK_dKZQpQ,1,0,1,QAPAzD9E2ePRY1lEF0LXrQ

You sign your party in at the podium in front and wait to be seated, which only took around 5 minutes as they were cleaning off tables. We informed the server that it was our first time there and he didn't really say too much, so we ordered some jasmine tea and Vietnamese egg rolls as we were still deciding what we wanted for main dishes. The egg rolls come on a plate full of different greens and some julienne carrots.  As earlier stated, the place was jumping and our server was kind of running around, so we asked the guy who brought out the rolls how to eat them incorporating the greens. He said that you more or less make egg roll wraps, using the assorted greens and some provided sweet n sour sauce. My wife loved the taste of the wrap, but I preferred the egg roll just as it was with the sauce and some chili oil. After around 20 minutes or so, our server returned to take our order. Once again we mentioned that it was our first time, and he then proceeded to give us some suggestions from the menu. I ordered the #10 pho, which was a noodle soup with different types of beef. My wife ordered the #29, an udon noodle soup with pork and shrimp. I also ordered another side of noodles and a side order of grilled pork. After a short wait, we were served big bowls of piping hot noodle soup, along with our sides. In one word....YUM!! The soups were outstanding and the grilled pork was excellent!  The soups were accompanied by a plate of bean spouts, lime, thinly sliced jalapeños, and a few fresh herbs. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some inexpensive authentic Vietnamese pho. I only give it a 4 because it is a bit loud, the service was a tad slow, and the jasmine tea was unsweetened (expected it to be honey sweetened like other places).

Pho So 1 has a location in California located on Victory and Sepulveda blvd; and never have their quality ever disappointed me after many years of patronage.
So for the first time last night, we decided to switch gears and try Pho So 1 in Las Vegas from our usual Pho Kim Long.

Our expectations were that of what we were familiar with and accustomed to.
The place had all the right smells and the look typical of a Pho joint, I felt that this was going to be good.

My girlfriend ordered the grilled pork vermicelli and I ordered the pork chop and shredded pork with omelette dish.
Food arrived quick as it always usually does but already we were offput by the smell. There was something strange and we had noticed that in the menu as the menu items are different from their location in CA.
There was this smell coming from the food that just didn't seem right, which then led to the taste, then ultimately to how we felt after dinner.

I want to say that the pork items were probably bad for as I'm writing this review right now-my stomach is still feeling uneasy. My girlfriend felt the same way.

Her grilled pork vermicelli kinda had a lemongrass-like taste to it which we couldn't confirm if it was one of the ingredients used to flavor the pork, and as for mine it tasted something similar but more of pork that was spoiling. If you have ever left meat out or smelled spoiling meat then that is the picture in trying to paint for you in terms of taste and smell, it was not good and why I'm giving it a 1 star rating based solely on this experience.

We ended up eating what we could that wasn't meat, but by then we had felt that the meal was tainted and decided to just stop.
We still paid for our meal but it was truly not worth it as we would've been better off having McDonald's for dinner.

Ultimately it was my fault for wanting to venture out of the normal and breaking redundancy by going to a new place.

The pho use to be so big and fulfilling. Even though they were always busy, the waiters would always find a way to make a table for customers and take your order. This was before 2016....

(2016) We arrive here during a lunch rush at 1 pm. All tables were pact and super busy. We come in and we see all the waiters running around like a bunch of headless chickens. We sat ourselves at an empty table and we're ready to order. No one came by to take our order. I had to get up and go to the cashier to find a waiter to come take our order. We ordered and after a couple minutes, our pho came out. The pho was small and cold!! The rare meat they put in the pho didn't even cook and change color due to the temperature of the soup. We asked the waiter to give us a new bowl and he recommended he just microwave the bowl. All the noodles were not cooked and he meat impossible to eat. All our dishes were inedible. The only nice thing I can say about them was how fast and accurate they took our money for the bill.

I don't see that at other Pho restuarants or haven't stumble upon another one just like it. You know a restuarant is good when you have guest waiting for a table. I usually do the thirst test after eating at a certain restuarant to see if they use a lot of MSG. After eating at this place I was not thirsty at all, I guess they really cook their broth from scratch than with the help of MSG to flavor it. Their pho was really tasty and delicious and they give a lot of meat.

891160,2010-09-21,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Let me preface my review by saying this:  I learned to make pho broth in culinary school, so my first introduction to this broth spoiled me on the rest.  However, I'm in Vegas on vacation and am coming down with a cold, so any pho is good pho.

Appearance: we had breakfast at Pho So 1 at around 9:30 on a Tuesday morning.  Jadira is right, there is no host station when you walk in, so you just walk in there and stand confused until someone sees you and ushers you to a seat.  We were seated within 90 seconds, though.  This place is nice and clean, and everyone there was pleasant.

The service: prompt, English-speaking (for the most part), and our egg rolls came out at the same time as our soups.  Unlike most restaurants, we were never bothered once our food was delivered.  That was ok with me - I would have been happy to flag someone down if we needed anything more, and it's awkward trying to talk with a mouthful of noodles and broth running down your chin.  Besides, they really give you all the condiments and complements you need before you get your meal.  

The food: nice and hot.  We shared an eggroll appetizer, my husband had pho with flank and brisket, and I had pho with beef balls.  The balls were tasty, but I wasn't crazy about their texture.  The flank and brisket, along with the eggrolls, were great, with a good ratio of meat to fat.  The noodles had a good texture, and there were plenty of them.  Great big plate full of basil, sprouts, jalapenos, and lime just in case.

My complaint: The hardest thing to get just right, at least for me, is the broth.  Having been spoiled by my textbook broth, I like for it to be dark in color from onion and ginger brulee, and for it to have a strong aroma of beef balanced with the sachet spices.  Pho So 1 had only the latter - very aromatic but almost as light and clear as water.  

Bottom line: we're still looking for that perfect bowl of pho here in town, but you could do lots worse than Pho So 1.",_hjimNhw7V4ChvtqVC_dUA,0,0,3,m6A3jrFgtB6MS9SvGApw5A

955270,2014-02-23,1,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"To say this is the best pho place in Vegas, is sad. It used to be decent, but I ask you to try it out and see for yourself.

SETTING: Located in the same plaza as market 168 and Honey Pig, it has a fair amount of parking. Be careful on the weekends when it's super crowded and everyone's a crappy driver. Restaurant is open, spacious. Seats and tables are gross and sometimes sticky. 

Might be a bit of a wait depending on the time and day. Fridays, saturdays, all major holidays are pretty packed. 

SERVICE: Hit-or-miss normally. Late-nights are good from 8pm-ish onwards when it's got a good crowd going, but they're still attentive. 

Can be very annoying trying to grab their attention. Like some asian places, don't expect them to pander, smile, or be fluffy with you. Cultural thing? Slightly. In vietnam, it's normally very business-like in the sense that you go eat and get out. You've got places to be. Casual. Still respectful though. Nothing personal. 

Am I the ONLY one that finds it bizarre that they serve hot tea in regular-size beverage cups?! Where are my teacups and teapot?! Not a huge deal, but it's comical to me. 

FOOD: one issue I've had consistently with the place for several years is the temperature of the broth. They either serve it slightly warm or barely hot. You might think this isn't an issue. Good pho is HOT (still shy of boiling hot) throughout the whole time you eat it and doesn't grow cold when you're almost or halfway finished. It also serves to cook your thin meat slices in there. I can't tell you how many times my pho has come out barely warm.

If your pho comes out tongue-ready without having to blow on it (sorry, couldn't word that any differently :/ ), then they're doing it WRONG. Ruins the experience.

Broth is normally flavorful for me, but nothing spectacular like ""OH MY GOSH this is UH-MAZE-ING."" I like to eat it as-is before manipulating it with hoisin and hot sauce. Whenever it is packed here, the food suffers. It's a pretty huge difference. Meat is fine, but I've found it oddly too tough sometimes. Hu tieu mi is one of my fave noodle soups, and they do a decent version of it. However, they LOAD so much into a bowl that it spills when I put my spoon and chopsticks in.

Would I call this perfect or even the best pho in Vegas? No. It's mediocre bordering on okay, but I'm happy this place has some awesome love for it. I'd rather stay at home and make my own, honestly. Am I being elitist about this? Maybe. I've just had decent or excellent pho since I was kid to know the difference in quality.

PROS: open late nights for the bar/club crowd and night owls. Okay pho, but seriously overrated. Good portions for both small and large bowls.

CONS: service. The food. 

VERDICT: Okay food for the price. Affordable. Great option for when you're craving food to soak up all that alcohol late nights. If you're not super picky or don't care, it's an okay place to go. Far from the best, but still better than the worst.",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,2,1,3,t1feRyc1fbiefTkVcUbH6A

One of the few pho places open late that is priced right and tastes good, with also good portions. Soup to noodles to meat ratio. Still tastes awesome. Spring rolls are just ok. But the take out spend, wow. Very quick. Worth the drive each time. Yums. 
They are now near the top of my list for pho places for sure. 

UPDATE June 2014
I do not like this place at all anymore. Go someone else. 

BAD SERVICE, ok food. They have great pho hands down almost close to the pho place I loved back home in Hawaii but the service was horrible!!! Even as an Asian person in there, I felt I was invisible. Three tables that were sat after us was served before us. It took 3 different people's attention before my husband finally got his soda.  I understand they were busy and the food came out quick, but the service was the worst I have experienced in a long time.  It was also super hot, they had 2 fans on but felt like there was no ac running, which made it even more uncomfortable and the experience unpleasant. It was cooler outside! I  would never dine in again maybe only take out.  It's a shame because the food rocked. I want to try again but not sure I would ever dine in again. Take out sounds better but of course it doesn't give you that Pho experience you want when you want that hot brothy soup.",dE06ZauqS1mMdTsnaSxvlA,0,0,4,SAcJeq2eg0YqP5YrCTGltg

When the little grill and tons of plates of ""stuff"" arrived at my table, I was completely lost.  I looked around at the smiling faces of successful grillers, and thought, ""I want to be just like that guy, only without the mustache.""  I had to ask my server for instructions.

I'm going to break it down for you so you're prepared to get crazy with your dinner:

You will get a plate of beef and shrimp, (order this one, both proteins were great) lettuce, mint, limes, onions, and jalapenos, (like with pho) some peanut sauce and some fish sauce for dipping, a bowl of hot water, and finally, little clear pieces of paper (rice wrappers)

Here's what you do:

1)  Squeeze some lime on your meats, because errrthing's better with lime.
2)  Dip your meats in the oil which is in the little reservoir around the grill, then place on the grill, cook to your liking.
3) Dip rice wrappers in hot water to reconstitute them, then lay on your plate.  
4) Fill wrapper with lettuce, mint, jalapenos, carrots
5)  Put freshly cooked meat in wrapper.
6) Wrap it up like a burrito
7)  Enjoy the HELL out of that delicious little thang!

This restaurant is a popular favorite when it comes to vietnamese food. Wide selection of different foods on their menu listing to almost 100 items like pho, bun, com... appetizers like spring rolls and cha gio (viet style egg rolls) 

Service is pretty decent. The owner (or owner's son? whoever it may be... young mid aged maybe high 20s guy) is really nice. 

One of my favorite few things to order is the #10 which is the special pho with combination of beef... good sized bowl for a large. decent amount of noodles and meat. usually comes out pretty fast and hot. a fav during the year, esp during the cold times to warm up ! 

another one is #54? which is the bun thit nuong cha gio... rice vermicelli noodles with viet egg rolls and barbequed pork on top of greens and eaten with their mixture of fish sauce ! one i like to order over the summer or when its hot... nice cold noodle (no soup base)

one other favorite i order a lot is Bun Rieu... its a special soup based noodle soup that uses tomato as a base for soup and crab meat... also have a few cubes of cooked pork blood as well... very tasty.. takes a while to make compared to #10 or #54 but its worth the wait... most of the soup is usually gone by the time i finish this =]

popular place for pho by many people of different ages... open late to like i believe 2am? busy during prime hours. 

one little con is they dont have a really good air ventilation system... sometimes can be a little hot or stuffy or have a little KBBQ feel when someone around you has gotten the beef plate to grill at table.. but dont let this stop u from going to this place..

one pro to mention is this place is bill splitting friendly... for those who like to pay for their own order when sitting in a group.. =]",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,4,0nLUeQNFctgGE7LYIJg_yQ

I personally am a big fan of Pho (as this is my third yelp on a vietnamese restaurant). I was introduced to this particular place because I use to date the owner's son. I had never had pho prior. The establishment has flourished since then. The restaurant has doubled in size in 2002.

My fiance says that this is his favorite place for Cum Bo Lu Lac. Its basically barbequed beef and rice (i believe). I happen to like their jellyfish salad. The pickled favor is not overwhelming. 

 The pho is on par with most pho restaurants I have eaten. Price is also very reasonable, I think it was $6 for a bowl of pho which is around the going rate. Fresh spring rolls were very good too. 

Some people have mentioned that the place wasn't very clean. I would like everyone to keep in mind that most authentic Vietnamese restaurants aren't going to be very upscale and /or clean. Not that this is an excuse for hygiene, but I like to review on subjectivity. This is how most Vietnamese restaurants are, no boujie-ness but great food. If you're looking for an elegant Vietnamese restaurant, I can say, from experience, that the food will be over priced for exactly the same product from a mom/pop pho restaurant.

This restaurant isnt open as late as Pho Kim Long, but it is great. Last time I checked, they only took cash. So make sure to make cash on you.",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,0,0,4,2HjYErBKsnbSPzfI89a8dA

Starting with the food, my pork chop over rice was really dry and the portion was small. My mom ordered their classic beef flank pho was below standard in my opinion.  The beef was old and dry. 

Customer service was not up to par either. The wait to be seated took about 15 minutes. I get that it was the weekend but that was no excuse for the poor flow of the restaurant. I only saw two bus-boys cleaning up the whole store. And there were plenty of empty tables but too short-handed to clean up, leaving many customers waiting outside. When it was finally my turn to be seated, the waiter had really bad attitude. 

For such a small portion, the price was so not worth it! Even the price in New York was cheaper than this place! 

I felt really bad for the workers because I felt like this place was short staffed. Leaving the store crowded and poorly ordered. Many angry customers were waiting by the door with me.

This is my favorite Pho place in Las Vegas. I come here so often that certain servers see me and they already have my order written down before I'm even seated (true story :P)

My favorite thing to order is item #12 a.k.a. Pho Tai Nam. I like to order the rare steak that comes with it on the side then let it soak in lime juice that way when i put it in my soup it's still a little pink by the time I get to eat it. Along with that I get the eggrolls (item #1) because they are SO DAMN GOOD. Not once have I ever visited and left disappointed with the eggrolls. They are consistently amazing every single time. They come with a decent portion of lettuce and veggies and what I do (if you've never tried) is take the eggroll and some veggies and roll it up in the lettuce leaf like a wrap, dip it in the sauce they give you and VOILA! taste bud orgasm.

I gave it a 4 because some days, the service just downright sucks lol. It's okay though, the food ALWAYS makes up for it in the end.

Your typical Vietnamese Pho house decoration with simple table (plenty) settings and menu. Servers are prompt and cleanliness is acceptable. If you struggle on which kind of Pho you'd like, be adventurous and pick the Pho Dac Biet (Pho Special)! Warning, the bowls are eye-popping big, regardless if you order a Special or not! As the beautiful Pho lands on your table, the broth is hot enough to open up your pores, the aroma is rich enough that it could suffocate your nose, colorful display with very little floating oil, now the important part (**drum roll please**), once again the broth is hot enough to burn your tongue but the taste is truly a blast full of flavors with no Sriracha hot sauce or lemon required. Typically, you will get an after taste (from MSG!!) in some Pho houses but Pho So 1 leaves your mouth tastefully wanting for more, truly a work of art!

Oh the prices are nice too. $6.75 for a ""small"" bowl, which was enough to fill me up.

I got the #13 beef pho with flank and brisket. The beef broth was decent, not the most flavorful I've ever had, but still good. The meat was very good! And there was A LOT of it! Large tender slices that was very proportional with the amount of noodles (ie, I still had meat left to go with the noodles by the end of the bowl). I was very happy with this, and very satisfied and full by the end of the small bowl!

My friends had the pho ga (chicken pho) but said the meat was dry and not that good.

The place was steamy and a muggy inside, could probably use some fans and ventillation given it's Las Vegas weather with hot soup/grilled items being served inside.

So really when you're on the strip all you're left with is American and European food, and after tons of heavy drinking that kind of food may not sit so well anymore. Honestly nothing cures a night of heavy drinking like a big bowl of Pho.

When I get Pho in Vegas, I love to hit up Pho So 1. It's got a pretty funny name, not quite Pho Kim Long, but usually places with funny names tend to have sh*tty food. But this place is an exception. The prices are pretty standard for Pho places, but it also is dirt cheap in comparison to things on the strip. About $6-8 for a bowl of pho. I like to order the large #1. When I first got it honestly I thought the bowl was tiny. I was so used to getting the bowls that were more like buckets at other Pho places.

But don't let the bowl size fool you. Unlike the other Pho places. Pho So 1 actually jam packs their pho bowls with noodles, meat, and condiments.  Where as the other Pho places may give you a gigantic bowl, but honestly it's all broth. I have a huge appetite and I typically leave Pho So 1 stuffed. I highly recommend their Pho. It's not as good as Grandma's, but it's definitely delicious. I also highly recommend their Cha Gio (deep fried lumpia). It's also quite good and they serve it right with the lettuce, noodles, etc. Although their dipping sauce is a bit different.

Anyway, if you have a cheap way to get off the strip. I highly recommend hitting up Pho So 1.

Restaurant is decent size and always seems busy, plus it is open pretty late which is convenient when you need pho as a hangover cure.

I hate to say that aloof service tends to be pretty standard with most Asian restaurants, but it definitely seems to be the case here.

We also ordered a number 95, which is thin pieces of rare beef. This dish used to be so much better. Before, it was a generous portion of beef marinated in lime. Now, the dish is more expensive with a smaller portion and they changed the sauce to be more sweet. The old way was so much better. 

The 888 was okay. It was an all meat platter and it had a nice grilled flavor, but the meat was pretty dry.

Pho.

And that's exactly why I ordered Bun noodles instead.

In all seriousness Vegas' asian district has a decent pho place that attracts tourists and locals alike and according to my Vietnamese buddy who frequents Pho So 1 after many a crazy weekend, he says the Pho is alright.

They have a fairly extensive menu offering all manner of vietnamese dishes outside of the family soup & noodles like the aforementioned bun, and rice plates with pork chop, beef filet mignon, etc.  Also many chinese fusion dishes and some hot pot items also make the list.  

The restaurant is spacious and being off strip, parking is free and easy.  If you have a car and looking for some good, cheap eats, Pho So 1 is as good a choice as any.",C9WHeAxjoR9Nxo7l-Y-F0g,2,2,4,WNYBR6RvWZwsf1PItoCp3A

Returning back I've noticed they now have the option to BBQ at a table (with a portable burner). I would love to try it here... only problem was there is NO ventilation. They didn't even keep the front door open or bothered to open it when 2 tables had the grill.

Compared to the other pho restaurants in LV, this is one of the ones. Unfortunately, that's the only positive about this place. Unfortunately, everything about the place overshadow the decent food and just plain out bring the place down. Dining there was like dining from hell. First, the service is about the worst I've ever experienced. They spilled the boiling pho on my gf's friend and rather than apologize, they put the blame on her. Second, they completely got my order wrong and while they admitted it, they never corrected so I ended up eating the wrong pho anyway since I was too hungry waiting for what I ordered. Next, the entire place was disorganized and smelly. Busboys were busting tables all around us while staff were running around but never really getting our orders or that of our neighbors' orders properly. I can only guess this place is still in business because people don't know where else to eat in LV. Here's a tip. Spend the money and pay 3x the price to eat pho at one of the restaurants in any of the major hotels (Mandalay, Bellagio, etc...) and you will still get better value for your money. As for this hell hole, they should be grateful we didn't sue for the spill.

1693186,2012-10-10,1,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"My husband craves this place.  He would eat pho here every single day if he could.  I like pho, but I am not obsessed. So I usually put him off for a while, usually we go once every 2 weeks or so.   After coming here for pho we don't go anywhere else now.  We also take all our guests here atleast once. You can tell it is has a ""cult"" following.

The restaurant setting is sort of like an Asian diner.  A little dated with cheesy fake silk flowers, but relatively clean restaurant. Every table has popular condiments like Sriracha, hoisin, fish/soy sauce, and chili paste, napkins, soup spoons, and chopsticks.  The service can very a bit variable, especially with ordering, which is why I give it 4 stars rather than 5.  Sometimes it is attentive, sometimes you are waiting and trying to catch any waiter's attention when it is busy.  Once you have their attention, service is pretty good and quick.

The menu is huge and everything is incredibly affordable, actually a real good value! Typical appetizers such as spring rolls, summer rolls,  and satay.  They have atleast 20+ pho soup dishes, and plenty of noodle, rice, and stirfried dishes.
I am a pretty particular eater. I don't eat any starches (no rice, noodles, etc), Pho So always accommodates my no noodle request correctly when I order pho.  The broth tastes light and is consistent every time, but not particularly unique.  The broth is the basis of every single one of their pho soups, so all the pho orders come out in a matter of minutes of ordering, since they just require the requested meats, rice noodles, and the ladling the generic broth over it.  

I have tried other dishes there, like the bo luc lac, which is delicious and a decent portion for the price.  Although I haven't gotten it myself, I see many people order the meats for the do-it-yourself grill and then put it in a lettuce leaf adding rice noodles, vegetables, and condiments.  Looks fun.

Alcohol offerings are a few Asian beers and a basic ""house"" red or white wine (AKA Sutter Home)...that is it.

In summary, I give them 4 stars.  For the price, the food is good and consistent.  Service is always friendly, but occasionally it is hard to get your order in when it is busy.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,1,1,4,KDrjDfwukuzVSlKoUMBrMA

We ordered fries and they never came. It was around 6 pm so I thought the servers would be attentive. But we were wrong. We had to flag them down for a refill of water. We had to tell them to remove the charge for food that never came.

I watched the first server leave the restaurant presumably it was the end of his shift. Yet no one else came to check on us. Thumbs down for sure.

They never brought one out to me and had me just tell a server.. Not coming back and telling my friends and all of yelp"" - this being my most recent TIP posted for this establishment. 

Again, another establishment I hate to do this to since I was such a regular at this place, but in all honesty, when you see a cockroach in a place where you like to eat, it really does make you want to never come back. Last night 12/8/15 I was dining with a large group of friends (about 18 people) and a manager of some kind (he was not wearing restaurant uniform) made his way to even greet us and thank us for coming to their establishment. 

Everything was fine, until my mother and I decided we needed to use the restroom. My mom has said to me several times that she even though it's cheap and the food is decent, she doesn't like coming here because she always sees small cockroaches in the bathroom. I had personally never seen them before, so I would continue to come here whenever friends would want a pho run. This time on 12/8/15, it was a different story. My mother and I walked into a very dirty restroom and as she entered the handicap stall, she yelled at me on the other side, oh man.. see there goes one cockroach. and then I hear ""stomp"" and she goes, ""I killed it."" She allowed me to come and see for myself, and that is the pix I have recently posted. 

We even saw another small cockroach on the floor near the sink, but I wasn't in the mood to stomp on another one, because quite frankly that's not my responsibility. Seeing a cockroach in an eatery establishment, it does something to your stomach thats hard to describe. I enjoy the food here, and even my meal that night was delicious, which was number 71 btw, the diced beef with onions and tomato rice. 

I very politely asked to speak to a manager, and the server asked if everything was okay, and I kindly responded, ""yes, it has nothing to do with the food or the service, that was fine, but there's an issue with the bathroom and I just wanted to discuss that with a manager"" the server nodded his head and said okay. and while we were still packing our left overs and splitting our bill, I was waiting for a manager.. none came. I kept looking at the server I spoke to, and it's almost as if he was trying to ignore me/ avoid making eye contact. 

I finally after patiently waiting and still no manager came out, I approached the server and asked if he was going to get the manager, or if he just wanted me to tell him. So I ended up just telling the server, and he responded, ""Oh well we sent someone to the bathroom already and they didn't see anything."" and I responded, ""oh really? because here is the photo proof. and I can tell you exactly where it's laying."" What's really poor service and disappointing is that instead of just being like, ""I sent someone back there and we didn't see anything, but we apologize for that experience and we will look into it more and making sure we better attend to our restrooms..."" they kinda brushed it off like, ""oh well, we didn't see one, so no there's no cockroaches here.."" I insulted because it was like they were saying or making it seem like I was making it up. but no I have picture proof.. and I would post this kinda stuff unless it was true. I even said to the server, I like the food here and I like coming here, but I cannot continue to come back if you guys don't care about your bathrooms and the cockroaches. and honestly the lack of interest in fixing the issue is enough to make me want to never come back. There's plenty of good pho and Viet food in this city. This is the last time Pho So 1 will see me, my business, and those I associate with.",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,14,8,1,VDTLFC6qtCT3eFtq48JuGw

Special Combo: rare slices of steak(cooks in the broth), well-done brisket, flank, tendon and tripe. Half the time I'd order this and the other half, just brisket, tendon and rare steak.

After a few pho-less years, I got it in my head to try some pho again. Based on some reviews, the general consensus was to try here as they were considered to be one of the better places for pho.

The reviews were right on the pho (and on the service). Normally when I go eat pho there's only a few selections. Not so here. There's a several page menu with a LARGE selection of items including non-pho items. Fortunately, if you aren't sure what to get some of the more popular items have photos so you can see what you're ordering.

Once ordered the food came in a decent amount of time. The main issue is getting anyone's attention. While the restaurant is FULL of staff they all have this sort of focused look in their eyes while never making eye contact with anyone. Hence they'll never see you waving your hand as you need another glass of water or help with the choking victim (I kid on the choking). 

Eventually it you time it right, you'll give someone who hasn't learned the ""Avoid Looking into the Eye"" trick and you'll get your service. That said the staff were nice when we got them (they even offered us an extra appetizer from a mistake order from another table).

Just know you'll have a hard time getting service.

That said the food is good, the restaurant is clean, and there's plenty of parking since it's in an outdoor mall. if you want some good pho and you don't mind a bit of a wait on service try it out.

The fried eggroll was not as good.  And used a different eggroll wrapper which makes a huge difference.  The order came with 4 rolls... The Simi Valley branch comes with 5 rolls.  

We ordered Pho and dry noodles with bbq pork.   No complaints with the Pho, the broth was good, hot, & tasty.   However the other dish...the noodles with bbq was served burnt.   It was inedible.   I thought my son was exaggerating, but he was right.  All I could taste was badly charred meat.  I don't think burnt food should leave the kitchen and served.  

Finally the prices were higher here in LV than in Ca... Like 25% more.   We had to even review our bill and ask the store owner about the difference.  We were told they raised prices recently.  So be sure to check out the prices.

Next time we're out in Vegas I'd like to try out a different Pho place.   I hope Yelpers can steer us to THE best pho place in town.",ZWgnv3IEHuxLkBg5Wd-pJA,0,0,3,8YpKBzcNNQwB5caBFOjjgA

If you're stupid enough to go into this restaurant after my review then you can hear the death throes of bankruptcy and the health department shutting this place down and turning it over to someone else to reinvent it again any day now. This is after going there for 8 good years until recently in the past year a change of ownership within the family has now turned it into a bunch of egomaniac kids with no idea how to run a restaurant. Examples? Heat turned off in January on cold nights inside the restaurant about as cold as it is outside 50 degrees give or take five degrees even the staff were wearing coats and hats serving customers. When I asked about the Heat it wasn't broke or anything to that effect they just didn't want to turn it on, but they did have a heater fan sitting on the bar by the cash register supposedly to heat the whole restaurant and said that the grilled food some people purchase is enough heat to warm up the restaurant LOL. Half the beef for the table barbecue is uneatable literally nothing but fat and tendon as opposed to what they used to serve and what their other family restaurants serve at Viet Noodle Bar just up the street on Spring Mountain. If you want to vomit going to the bathrooms they're filled with roaches urine feces and trash all over the floor and unspeakable body fluids on the walls. The Cashiers beg for cash payment so as to have under the table income and avoid IRS penalties for fraudulently under-reporting cash income. When we realize the barbecue was unedible we asked for a credit or exchange to get something else and the manager on duty which is the nephew of the previous owner now at Viet Noodle Bar with tattoos all over his body a coat and a hat on BECAUSE THE HEAT is off to skim more cash  said, "" I'm not giving you a full refund for the entree,"" and when I said it's up to you to make some kind of adjustment he said, "" well then I'm not making any adjustments."", and charges the full price which of course is going to be disputed on the credit card never to be paid and this Yelp among other social media reviews like TripAdvisor to rid the Local Clark County Residents of this Diseased Scam. Believe me, I'm not the only one that feels this way. MANY others had this same experience or worse.

It's more of a salty pho, not one of the sweet ones.   I always get the rare steak which is $7.99.   The meat is by no means really really good but it is decently tender and just hits the spot.

2229612,2010-11-04,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"After midnight on a wednesday, a rare miracle occurred and my boyfriend agreed to indulge my noodle soup craving! After we shared a lackluster pho experience in Seattle, he's always resisted any mention of brothy noodles. 

Upon arriving, the restaurant had several occupied tables. My order was promptly handled and I was offered a complimentary hot tea while I waited. The tea was steaming when it came out, but had the tiny residuals of ice floating in it- a considerate touch since I wouldn't be staying long enough for the tea to cool in the glass on it's own. I enjoyed the tea, it was flavorful, very refreshing and a nice precursor to the meal.  I ordered the #10 for myself and the #12 for the boy. My meal came with gelatinous chunks of meat, shredded tripe, brisket and rare steak as well as chopped green onion and raw onion. I really enjoyed the textural variety that the different meats contributed to the meal; the shredded tripe was something I found surprisingly pleasing. The only negative is that the gelatinous pieces were so rich, I doubt I'd be able to have this same dish too often. His had a lot of shredded brisket and some rare steak, as well as the green and raw onion. The noodles and toppings came in a container to themselves, with the broth and additional raw vegetables in separate packages. The vegetables were a huge portion- tons of bean sprouts, lots of fresh herbs [basil and others that I didn't recognize] and chopped jalapeno and lime quarters. There were also several containers of sauce. It was all wrapped up well and stayed hot during the cross-town drive home. I appreciated that the steak was pretty much raw when I got it, so that we could pour the hot broth over it and let it cook in the soup. The meat is more tender that way. The broth had a nice spice level without being obnoxious, was just salty enough and worked really well with a fresh squeeze of lime on top. 

In fact, the broth was flavorful enough  that J finished most of his which is exceedingly rare to see. Early into the bowl he said that he'd be willing to have their pho again, so I am VERY happy! More noodle soups for me! Pho so 1 has converted a pho-phobe. And the generous portion of vegetables and different herbs makes it feel virtuous enough to have instead of burritos, so I can justify eating here again soon. The hours are perfect for me as I often work pretty late. I chose this place because they aren't open 24 hours; I just can't help but think maybe their chefs are happier or something.  

Their iced coffee with condensed milk is strong and has a unique taste to it. It reminded me of custard with a strong coffee punch. When I recieved my order, the server laughed and asked if I was going to be partying all night. The cup had a lot of ice and the actual amount of coffee ended up being rather small, but that's probably a good thing considering the time of night I was having it.

There has to be something in pho that tastes so good and helps you recover that much faster. I think that the pho (especially the broth) here is better than many of the other pho places in the area. 

I almost always have to get a side when I get pho and the side to get here is the fried egg rolls. Definitely fried to perfection and when wrapped in a leaf of lettuce and dipped in fish sauce, it is a tasty way to start your meal. 

The service the last few times has been a bit questionable as I think they hired some new staff, but I'll let it slide since they did get our order correct.

Came here, looking for lunch, and was recommended this place by a relative--myself, husband, 3 & 5 year olds, step-mother, and my brother.   Walked in and was excited--everything smelled good, and the place was on the empty side (we'd come a bit early) which was good because we had 2 kids with us.  

We ordered noodle bowls--one tendon, one with tripe and other cuts, one of the brisket ones (#13 I believe?  Was what my children shared), another brisket one for myself (#11 one) and the spicy noodles with the blood sausage in it (#63).

Was not impressed at all by what came next.  We received our veggie plate, and I was dismayed to find that all the plates had partially rotting basil placed on them.  A bit bummed, but not deterred, I picked off the decent ones and set them aside for later.  Then the actual noodles came--the broth was a very watery beef broth, and was definitely not as good as something I could've made my self at home.  My meat was alright, but my children's as well as my husband's and brother's meat all tasted more on the wet muddy cow side than proper beef should--the kind of taste it gets when it hasn't been cured and hung properly.

I could have set this all aside, and given this place 3 stars (because at least the food was inexpensive), had the service not been so awful.  The one bright side was the waitress recommending the specific noodles (the meat on #13 was thinner and easier for them) for our children, and the man servicing the register who was pleasant and polite.  However, the waitress spent the rest of the time being extremely curt with us.  The restaurant was nearly empty, yet we were seated right next to the restrooms;  I normally wouldn't complain, but there were other empty tables that could've seated our numbers, and there was a smell.  Top this off with a bus boy who, at first I thought was restocking the table next to me, but then spent the next 20 minutes standing 10 inches away straightening out chopsticks and other such things, rather than moving to an empty corner of the restaurant.

Add this to the fact that we caught the same waitress ignoring and arguing with a couple in the booth next to us (it took them 30 minutes to actually have her come by to talk to them!).  I'm not sure how they normally are, but apparently this was a bad day for them.

The restaurant is very spacious--as opposed to the surrounding pho restaurants. I don't think you should have a problem with getting in, as pho is a quick meal so people are in and out. The decor itself was plain and didn't stand out much. The service was friendly but it may also be because they're my people.

I wasn't craving pho at the time so I decided to go with chao ga (rice porridge with chicken) and my mom got hu tieu nam vang. Everyone's food come out first except for mine and I probably waited around 15~20 mins until they realized I still haven't gotten my food yet. When it came out, I was so happy because I was starving! Now, the chao ga was good; there was a lot of white meat chicken and it was really flavorful and I did enjoy my meal. 

However, when my mom and I got back to the hotel, we were really tired and our mouths felt really dry. That's when I knew that our food was packed with MSG and before I knew it, I knocked out on the bed for a few hours. I woke up and immediately started drinking water due to dehydration.

Yes the food was good but it makes me question if the food was good due to hours of prep time and flavor, or due to the added MSG. I would have to go with the MSG and that's a no-no for me.",4th-MvaVtul61irYo6wrVQ,2,3,2,y-eImVBT8AWli1LiCuGVmQ

Well let's start with the service, now when it comes to Asian restaurants we all know not to expect 5 star, 4 star, or even 3 star service. So with that in mind this place completely blowed. Maybe it was bad luck, or maybe we just came on a bad day, but the service was by far some of the worst I have experienced recently.

First and foremost they kept bringing out random orders that weren't ours, and despite this lack of competence on their part, the waiter for some reason started to get frustrated with us.....(well f*!K him).

Moreover, the lady that was behind the counter (the owner maybe) gave us this piercing dirty look because we were frustrated that the orders were coming out wrong. It was as if she was on her heavy period and I took her last box of tampons and hid them.

Second, the correct orders took forever and day to come out. By the time we had received our orders, two tables were already done eating. We only ordered three entries, but it seemed like the cook had to go to the farm to slaughter the cow and bring it back to the restaurant.

As for the food............it was average. Definitely not a hot spot for Pho here in Vegas. I've eaten Pho since I've been an embryo in my mommy's uterus, so this place is a no go for me. The free water sucks too, you can definitely taste the ""tap"" in the tap water.

This is how I see how each breaks down - I order ""Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet"":

Pho So 1 -
PRO'S:
. This is typically the place I normally go to when I'm hungover like I normally am in Vegas. Pho does a body good after drinks.
. It's clean, it's nicer looking than most Pho restaurants, and it's usually packed...most often with some hotties.
. They have an extensive menu
. huge parking lot
. Catch up on finding a real estate agent because they advertise in the menu.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants I've been too.
CON'S:
. Mediocre pho broth. Can sometimes taste like beef broth in a can. The 99.8% fat free kind. Come on! Fat is flavor!
. Service??
. Get distracted by look'n at the menu cuz a bunch of real estate agents advertise in the menu.

Pho Saigon 8
PRO'S
. Pho broth is slightly better than So #1
. Won numerous awards in several publications for best Pho/Vietnamese restaurant.
. My friend ""Double D"" says this is her favorite place, and she's a local.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants.

. Smaller parking lot
. The day we went they forgot about our drink order.
. Older and less appealing interior
. $7 freak'n dollars for a LARGE bowl which isn't any bigger than So #1's large bowl of Pho. In fact, I think it's slightly smaller.
. My boba in my Thai Ice tea was like rubber pellets.

This time we tried: 

""Pho Ga"" (chicken pho) - Great news, they give a huge portion to-go! It was a good enough size for 2 regular sized bowls! Bad news, the chicken was very tough and super dried out, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the plentiful pho noodles and the comforting chicken broth. I guess I was forgiving and not too picky, since I was sick and I needed hot broth to sooth my sore throat. Flavor rating: 3/5

""Bun Bo Hue"" (spicy beef noodle soup) - Not good at all. It was really bland and watery. Plus the meats weren't tender. I wouldn't suggest ordering this here - Pho Kinh Do had a much more flavorful broth and overall tastier bun bo hue. Flavor rating: 1/5

""Chao Tom"" (barbeque shrimp paste on sugar cane) - This dish was terrible. The shrimp paste on the sugar came was so bland and gummy. It tasted like I was eating some part of a plastic container - it's nothing that I would ever consider ingesting. Don't even bother trying this dish here. Flavor rating: 0/5

I raved about how they hooked us up with lots of fresh herbs and veggies on our to-go order last time, but not this time. I was really let down. :(

Whenever I come here, I get one of 3 options.

1. Pho (Beef Noodle Soup). I get the rare steak, flank, and brisket option. If you dont want your broth as greasy, minus the brisket. Just your basic pho with nothing but meat. No tendons or tripe. This would be a good choice for you first timers that dont wanna second guess what's in your soup. For you adventurers and seasoned vets, the combination has everything in it. Don't forget about the bean sprouts, cilantro, mint leaves, and sliced jalapenos that come on a separate plate for you to throw in there at your discretion.

2. Rice Vermicelli. I usually get the Charbroiled Beef or Pork with Egg rolls and Vegetables. I get this because it comes with the crispy egg rolls that they make so good. So instead of ordering it as a side item, it already comes with it. They give you a small cup of sweet n sour fish sauce to mix in your bowl for that complete flavor.

3. Rice Dish. I get the Diced Beef with Grilled Onions accompanied by Tomato Fried Rice. Very tender cuts of sirloin pan fried in oil and soy sauce. Very flavorful.

I have also have tried their Seafood Barbeque Combination. When you order this they bring out a portable grill heated by a specific gel. On a separate plate they give you raw shrimp, beef, squid, and tripe. You cook these items yourself. So basically, this is their version of Korean Barbeque. It's pretty much guaranteed this is what you will be smelling when you walk in there. This is what parties of 3 or more usually get because for about 25 bucks you get a decent amount of food.

Last but not least, I have heard great things about their Beef Salad. Eventually I will get it and it will probably be my fourth option.

These guys are open until about 3 am 7 days a week 365 days a year. I know this because Christmas Day nobody wanted to cook so we went here. Their service is very efficient and they always seem to be fully staffed every time I go.

The only negative thing that brings them to 4 instead of 5 stars is that the floor always seems to be littered with misc things. Not to the point where its piled up but if you look hard enough, you will see it. I will give them a pass because everything else makes up for it. Any questions? Message me and I will tell you everything I know! 

You can also check out their website: www.phoso1.com

When my friends and I set foot in this restaurant, we noticed that 85% of the patrons ordered bo nuong vi (DIY grilled beef, that comes with with vegetables and rice paper). Oh wow, I haven't seen this at restaurants in a long time. But then again, I am spoiled and only eat this dish when my mom makes it. 

Since everyone ordered this, I also ordered it too. I am glad I ordered this dish, as the taste was impeccable! The beef and shrimp was seasoned in lemongrass. You are given an abundance of fresh vegetables. The combination of the vegetables and beef/shrimp was heavenly.

I visited this place for a second time this past week and I for one will never be coming back to this restaurant. The place is absolutely filthy and is way overdue for an inspection. The walls were covered in layers of dust and splatters of hoisin sauce and Sriracha. The floors were so sticky that I had residue on the bottom of my shoes, so as I walked out I was still sticking the ground. Their fake flowers have so much dust, that it began to fall when the A/C blew on it. My first impression of the restaurant was terrible and the waiter was very pushy to take my order as he hovered by the table until I made my decision. 

I should have never come back to the restaurant. My first time visiting, I got sick after eating, but assumed it was because of the mam nem (fermented fish sauce). But after coming back to try the food without the sauce, I came to realize that I was sadly mistaken. I once again got sick from their food and all I had was their Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. The food did not taste good,  but I am a kind of person that knows the preciousness of food, so I continued to eat. The meat was dry and very chewy and the egg roll lacked flavor. I had very little Bun and had a lot of sour vegetables at the bottom of my bowl. 

Overall I was very disappointed in my visit and I hope that the Health Department takes notice. This is a place where you are only asking to get sick and there is a reason as to why there were only 2 other families within the restaurant. This is a place you need to stay away from.

You will have to ask the waiter for simple instructions in how to do it.  All though he jokingly said "" you don't know how to do it, why you order it! ""  I will give you a short breakdown of how to do it. 
You will get a plate of raw beef and shrimp ( I recommend 2 plates for 4 people ) and    a grill with a flame coming out of the top with oil on the side of it.  
Dip your meat in the oil on the side of the grill and place it on the grill.  
Dip the wrappers in HOT water to make it soft add your veggies (lettuce, mint, basil, jalapenos, carrots and radish )  
Add your cooked meat and wrap it up like a little package.

By the time you have ended your meal you will have it perfected!

The pho on the other hand was pretty good.  The mexican waiter kinda takes away the whole experience of eating Vietnamese food and ordering in my native tongue.  The broth was good, and not too much msg.

I have been going to the SF Asian Market for the past few years on a near weekly basis and never realized that Pho So 1 is located in the same shopping center! After hearing so many good things bout this place, I decided to check it out one day.

This is a definite one and done for me.

a) the place is NOT clean at all. The seats and tables looked like they could use a good cleaning. I kind of winced as I went to sit in the booth. When I went to look at the menu, a dried piece of lettuce was stuck to one corner and fell off onto the table as I noticed it. 

Nice.

This was my first impression of this place.

b) Ordered a plate of roasted chicken with rice and salad. The chicken was very dry and tasted bland. Wildly unimpressed. The rice and salad was serviceable, but it's pretty tough to screw those up.

c) Ordered a bowl of Pho..and while it wasn't terrible, it also wasn't anything special. I can name a dozen places off the top of my head where I can get better, more satisfying pho in this city.


Service was okay. Just okay.

I just don't get what all the hype over this place is about. No thanks.

2 stars.

2927193,2010-09-19,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Possibly the worst Vietnamese restaurant I've tried in Vegas. 

First, it's kind of confusing when you just walk in because they have no stand that you walk up to to get seated. We just walked in and waited until someone saw us and sat us. They sat us at this weird booth in the corner that had one full seat and one half seat, so instead of seating 4 it only sat 3. Since we always sit side by side, we sat on the full seat which faced the wall. 

It took about 15 minutes for someone to come take our order. I'm guessing it's because our seats didn't face anything but the wall. We ordered egg rolls, pho, and a rice plate. The pho came first, then the plate, THEN the egg rolls (which were listed under the appetizers).

I had to pour so much sauce into my pho just to give it some slight flavor. The beef and pork rice plate was pretty bad. The rice was very crumbly, like it didn't have enough water and the pork was not appetizing at all. The only dish we actually liked were the egg rolls. 

Throughout our entire hour and 15 minute dining, we only got our water filled twice. Once when they just gave them to us and the second time when we asked for the bill and he asked if we wanted water. 

The service here was very bad. We were never payed attention too and the waiter was never friendly. We were seriously sitting there waiting for our water to to be refilled for about 45 minutes. Then when the guy finally came and we asked him for the bill, he took 10 minutes to bring it. Then some other guy who wasn't even our server came and took our card. After that we waited another 10 minutes just to get it back.

Yes the food was really cheap, it was only 18 bucks for the both of us, but the service was just unbearable.

I eat pho roughly once a week and I feel like a regular going to this place. Their broths are absolutely amazing. I like how it's not oily, yet packed with flavor. They come out with sides of mint, onions, and whatever you want to throw in it. I personally like mine with everything except the chili slices, with extra squirts of fish and pepper sauce. The orders take roughly ten minutes to come out, regardless of how busy it gets. And it can get quite busy in there. Curious as to how Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and English sounds like in one room? Try going there around 9pm on a Friday night, it gets LOUD in there. However I don't mind the noise, it adds character to the bustling and rustling atmosphere.

Broths and most of the meat bowls are all roughly under 10 bucks a pop, which is a steal for me. I always leave feeling full and well-fed.

The wait staff is how I like it; fast, to-the-point, and ubiquitous. There are a lot of people walking around filling half-empty cups of water and serving food non-stop.

First off let me say that my friend who has visited this place numerous times said this was the first time the services was poor. We went for lunch hoping to have some yummy pho. Sadly it was not meant to be. We started off with an order of spring rolls, egg rolls and the iced coffee. My one friend who ordered the spring rolls found two pieces of hair literally in the roll (she notified our server asking for a replacement of the egg rolls instead). My other friend and I enjoyed our egg rolls as they came out quickly and were yummy. Unfortunately there was some confusion (I don't know how as my friend speaks Vietnamese so we thought we could avoid any language barrier etc) as they brought out another order of the spring rolls rather than the egg rolls my friend had requested. She notified the server who made the correction. Meanwhile she had also gotten her egg noodles she ordered while my other friend and I were still waiting on our pho orders. We noticed that two additional tables near us received their order despite being seated after us (and it seemed their orders were even wrong but yet they received a replacement in a timely manner; we still had yet to receive ours). We notified one of the servers that we had been waiting for awhile for our pho orders. He seemed to understand and it appeared went to check on the order(but again who knows even with my friend speaking in Vietnamese we never got our pho). 

I don't know if this was just an overall bad day on their part with service/kitchen communication as like I mentioned a few other tables seemed to have gotten the wrong order (but heck they at least still got their pho). We started to get a little frustrated that we still hadn't received our pho for I'd say 30-45min after initially ordering and then even notifying them of still not receiving anything. Finally we had enough decided to just cancel the pho orders and pay and leave. We were offered a simple I'm sorry and given our bill (they didn't charge for my friend's spring roll order so we ended up paying for 2 egg roll orders, 2 iced coffees and an order of egg noodles). I would've expected a little more sincerity or for them to comp on something since not only did my friend's order have human hair in it but they completely forgot to bring out half of our order.

While they were in town for the holidays, we stopped by for our routine visit.  I though I might share a couple of other recommendations from one of the most authentic Viet kitchens in Sin City:

1.  Pho Xao Don Dac Biet (Stir-fried Combination Pho): the pho noodles are deep-fried, then served with a combination of beef, chicken, shrimp, and various vegetables in a light flavorful gravy.  I love this dish but think the chicken is a little dry, so I order it with everything else but this overrated white meat.

2.  Bun Rieu (Vermicelli Soup in a Crab & Tomato Broth): few non-Vietnamese know about this noodle soup, and thus it's one of Vietnamese cuisine's best-kept secret.  The broth is richer than it sounds, with crab bits, fried tofu, even escargo when they have it on hand.  I love the chunky crab contents in contrast with the light vermicelli noodle, it's a very well-balanced soup.

3.  Thit Nuong Cuon (BBQ Pork Spring Rolls): spring rolls are originally made with braised pork and shrimp, proteins that carry minimal flavor, leading to the necessary accompaniment of the marinated fish sauce dip.

Soup is less than mediocre, broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful. We asked multiple times for simple sides like onion, and waiters would not acknowledge our requests. 

Just to top off the cake, there was curly hair in my #10 soup. The cashier was apologetic, but not by nature. She looked at my wife and I, trying to find out if the hair belong to one of us. The hair was curly and short, possibly armpit hair. For her to stare up and down at us, it was very offensive, we did not plan to eat someone else's pubes.

Lacking AC in this weather is not a welcoming place to dine. When I ask about the AC the waiter claim it is working (on) and the heat is cause by the weather outside! Sorry that was a load of crap! I posted a picture of the thermostat of the restaurant and it reads 90 Fahrenheit. I am not a high maintenance person but temperature that high ruins the dinning experience. 

The food is nothing to rave about! The chicken dish was dry! The grill pork and egg roll with vermicelli was decent! You could have gotten this in another Vietnamese restaurant.

Order the BBQ grill (pork or beef) spring rolls and have the grill on the table so you can cook and compose your roll to your own specifications. The sweet sauce with peanut in it is the icing on the cake completing the meal perfectly.

Prior to this restaurant, Vietnamese food was never a preferred cusine. I now know I just didn't go to good restaurants. That's how good the food is here!!!

(-1) The lack of flavor in the broth. Pho is known for the thick flavored broth and this just LACKS so much of the uniqueness of pho.

(-1) We had 9 people. Everyone ordered their own pho bowls. Only 7 came out. We had a feeling they put the last two bowls on someone else's table because a waiter came to us with an order of egg rolls that we didn't order. Ugh. 

(-2) Our hostess was a rude. B.I.T.C.H. You do not wave customers off, bump into them and glare (Hello. You bumped first). As she was taking our orders, she was glaring when there was too much order. (Our pho order wasn't complicated so chill down lady. Lady you're working at a phone restaurant not Starbucks - THAT'S complicated). Service please.

One star is for that young guy with a tied back fohawk hairstyle. You saved our tummy and fixed our orders really fast. And I saw him make sure other tables got their orders too (Ahem. Those eggrolls...)

You're talking about a place where all the Vietnamese locals/older generations go and eat. This has been an institution for at least 16 years (it expanded from one store front to two about 13 years ago, if I can remember correctly). My parents (born in what was once Saigon), friends and extended family all come here for Vietnamese food. Sure, they've tried Pho Saigon 8 (not bad) but this place is consistent in their tasty food.

The pho broth is always flavorful. I never feel cheated out of meat portions (balanced proportionately with the noodle serving) and they serve you a heaping side plateful of vegetables (I can't even stand those places that give you a little stem of thai basil to put in your soup). 

The sauces are solid. The goi cuon peanut sauce is delicious with great consistency, and the fresh shrimp spring rolls are always fresh. The fried egg rolls are meaty and just plain delicious -- they randomly were once too soggy a few years ago, but that's not the case anymore. The nuoc mam (fish sauce) is great, and that's not to be an overlooked thing because other places mess it up (along with the peanut sauce).

I also order their bun thit nuong. Their grilled meats are NOT fatty which is an unfortunate occurence in a lot of Vietnamese places and again, there is a decent amount of meat. 

Their Vietnamese iced coffee... I took it for granted how well they make it until I had it served to me in other restaurants. You think places can't mess up condensed milk with Cafe du Monde grounds and a little water, but shit, they do. My mom craved the coffee this morning and we went their this afternoon for lunch.

Their seven-course beef menu is reasonably priced (beats a good San Jose joint that specializes in 7-course beef). In fact, everything is. Anyway, the beef menu is really fun to order when you're introducing people to the world of Vietnamese food (just make sure they're not vegetarian). It's fun and definitely hands-on. You get to wrap up your slice of beef with a good handful of basil, mint, and vermicelli noodles and choose which one of the three sauces you feel like dipping it into. It's great fun in variety! If the fish sauce/nuoc mam and garlicy taste of things there didn't permeate my hands/mouth/face/body, it'd be a fun date menu. But don't take a date here for the seven-course beef if you plan on smooching later for the first time.... 

Ambiance: Okay, it's pretty much a typical Vietnamese joint. At least the tiles aren't slippery from grease like it was 15 years ago. It is clean and bright inside now. My dad doesn't really like the grilled smell when someone is grilling next to us -- but that's what you have to expect when at a Vietnamese place that does a good job with their grilling menu. But why am I even talking about ambience? It's not like it's a Thomas Keller restaurant.

Service: Okay, fine. So it can take a little while for a server to see you - BUT the food comes out REALLY QUICKLY so come ON, people! (I'm talking to those reviewers that complained a lot about it...not you.) So yeah, you wait a few extra minutes to grab their attention, but once they see you, they attend to you and from the time you order to the time you take your first bite, you've had time to prepare your chopsticks and sauces. This is also the case on a really busy Saturday afternoon. The owner's son that has worked there from forever ago remembers me from the time I was a little side-kick sister going in with her big brother. He just stopped by the table briefly to say hi, despite the restaurant being packed on a late Saturday afternoon. If something doesn't work out, they're flexible. I ordered the 7-course beef menu for a friend trying Vietnamese food for the first time, but he wasn't able to eat peanuts straight up. They took out the courses that had peanuts and switched it out with something else. I was AMAZED the waitress was even willing to stand there for more than five seconds on a busy night explaining what did or did not contain peanuts. 

I cannot tell you how often I crave this place while I've been living out in suburbia New York. I have to come to this place at least three times on a two week vacation while here in Vegas. And they are always consistent, so after all these years, I know exactly what I'm getting.

They never skimp on all the wonderful fresh herbs and veggies that accompany whatever dish you're having. I always feel bad not using it all up. 

But the biggest factor on my critiquing of vietnamese restaurants is the nuoc cham. Yep. Mhmm. That stinky, salty, tart, sweet fish sauce that I dip mostly everything into.

So this place was highly recommended to me by my dear, dear friend.  It wasn't difficult to find it especially when I'm not from Sin City.  Parking was plentiful.  Location is in a good size strip mall.  

As my family and I first walked in, we were just standing there, waiting patiently for someone to throw a glance at us, seat us, SOMETHING!   Ten minutes passed and all the workers were just busy serving everyone else.  Granted, they were moderately busy.  Anyway, as soon as the next customer came in they went straight to a table and sat themselves.  Soooo, we did the same.  Took another ten minutes to flag someone down to come to us and finally brought us the menus.  OMG, are you kidding me?! All I said to myself was, the frkn soup better be good or else my friend gets it! hahaha...

Thankfully, once we ordered, it wasn't too long before the food came out.  We ordered Pho, eggrolls, and the bbq pork.  Pho soup was good a 4/5.  Eggrolls were not so good 1/5, a bit too oily.  Bbq pork was really good 5/5, tender, juicy, and so bbq perfectly=)

Basically, its nothing to rave about.

I've heard that they use MSG, but I have no complaints about it, although I need to drink a bit of extra water.  My mom gets a headache sometimes after eating here, so she isn't a big fan of it.

You can order pho, rice or even get the grill to make your own rolls with the meat/shrimp they give you.  The food here is pretty good, probably some of the better Vietnamese food you would find here in Vegas.  Typically the meat is good, any of it (flank, steak, beef balls etc - or you can get the tendon or tripe if you like that as well).  I like getting the grill, reminds me of the old days of living with my parents and making that stuff at home and the nostalgic feel to it.

Only took maybe 10m to get a table. The tables are really close together and ours wasn't super clean. We also didn't have the utensil or condiment caddies. I had to eventually grab one from an empty table since our food had come out.

There were flies everywhere. So gross. One table asked to be relocated from their window table, because the flies were bothering them. There was even a dead fly on the utensil caddy at the table next to us. 

The only reason I give 3 instead of 2 stars is because the food tasted pretty good. Their egg rolls were fat and crispy, a stuffed with lots of pork, carrots, glass noodles and woodear mushrooms, and they were seasoned well. The chicken pho had shredded chicken breast and a ton of noodles. We even all requested fewer noodles and there was a ton of noodles. The broth had a good flavor, and you could taste the spices. Only complaint about both dishes was that they were both super greasy. The pho broth was so oily that none of us could really sip too much liquid.

My bro ordered the lemon soda (soda chanh), and they put so much sugar in it that it was undrinkable (even after they replaced the first one they brought out).

Pho 1 was introduced to me by a friend, and what a delight. We ordered the Number 12  Tai Nam Gau. The broth was flavorful, and the ""extras"" to put in the soup were all fresh, and nothing wilted, which I have experienced at other establishments, thus making me question the food The egg rolls were phenomenal and flavorful The peanut sauce was outstanding.  Pho won my heart, however there were several ambiance issues that strained the dining experience.

While we ate, a kitchen assistant set up a work station next to our table, where he proceeded to refill bottles that are placed on the tables. It was distracting to hear the final sounds of various sauces being ejected from each plastic bottle. There were at least 20 that were refilled. When I thought it would be over, out came another set of bottles. I hope that if management reads this, prepping will be done in the kitchen. Another distraction was the lighting. The room could use a screen on the front window. The afternoon sun cast a light, and as I talked to my dining partner, she was like looking at a shadow. When I placed my glasses on, all she could see was the reflection of the overhead lights and we could only laugh that wearing glasses made one look like an alien. We began  a discussion on restaurants and ambiance. I realized even a food truck has it's ambiance  and if there was a jack hammer  performing roadwork next to the truck, it would ruin the experience.  We had our final laugh as a busboy began to clear tables and managed to stack dishes and toss in the silverware to create a cacophony of tableware sounds I realize these are minor issues, however it does make a difference  to improve the entire dining experience. 

I am not a fan of plastic bowls as the soup did not retain it's heat. The server never returned to offer a refill on out tea or offer dessert. 

 I will definitely return to Pho 1 as I enjoyed the soup,  however, if I was bringing a friend to enjoy  a meal and to talk, it would not be my number one choice due to the ambiance issues and the lack of service.",LgiBFHIsRWIduc7HTq2rkA,0,0,3,_79TG3zOOesn7DcTcRi6Iw

The broth is tasty, aromatic, delicious, full of beef flavor. The rice  noodles were cooked just right.  Their meats are sliced paper thin, taking away most of the texture and taste. I would give 5 star if their meats are sliced by hand thicker. The big bowl, really big, is about $9.  

Quite a few Mexicans ordered Pho. Their menudo is a close cousin.  Just have to make beef broth with bone, star anise, ginger and onion, may be a little cinnamon or whatever your heart desires.

Their appetizers samples, anything like spring rolls, shrimp rolls, pork rolls ect.. are $3 a sampling plate, which usually have 2 rolls in them.  The samples are delicious and a cheap and very good way to introduce clients to new dishes.  This place has some very tasty appetizers to drink with.

It may be a small, un-fancy restaurant but I can't stop not going to this place! This restaurant is always full of diners. It is well-lit at night and with windows to bring in day light. I always get a seating to a good table, although there may be a few seconds or minutes to wait. But immediately upon sitting and browsing at the Vietnamese menu, complete with Vietnamese language and figures, I would request hot tea first. Hot Hot Vietnamese tea (yes, it is very hot in a tall glass, so be careful..sip it first, don't drink from the glass fast) is served prior to my meals which I enjoy sipping with squeeze of juice from lemon...my senses goes in relax mode! A cordial smiling food staff would take my order in just the way I like it. I always order #35 which is ""Hu Tieu Hau Vi"" (Seafood with Rice or Clear Glass Noodle Soup with or without Soup) with a little addition that I like: chicken, clear glass noodles and with soup (see my photo). I always experience good, timely service. The soup is served hot!!, in a huge bowl complete with a heaping platter of green vegetables, lemon, bean sprouts, basil, mint & green peppers...i like that!, which I place on the soup as soon as it is served. I leave it there for a few minutes to ""heat up"".  In no time at all, this soup is ""devoured""... I can get a little ""greedy""-looking as I dig into the soup and have the greatest enjoyment of it. In between my meal, I usually get refills of the tea...wow, because I like their hot tea! The order of Tea is included in the meal that is ordered at no charge. It is so ample to know that at a reasonable price of $7.50 + tax it is a just rightfully sweet $10 altogether, whataaah meal! 

Other favorites of mine I like to order from time to time are:
#1 ""Cha Gio"" (Authentic Vietnamese Egg Rolls) which is wrapped in fresh rice wrapper = $5.25..I love biting into each with a brown dipping sauce,
#10 ""Pho Dac Biet Xe Wa"" (Special combination of well-done brisket, rare slices of steak, tripe & flank tendon with rice noodle soup) = $6.95...the portions of meat are cut large,
#21 ""Pho Rau Thap Cam"" (is Vegetables combination with Rice Noodles Soup) =$5.95...ordered on days I want my vegetarian fix,
#65 ""Com Bi Cha Suon Nuong"" (Shredded Pork Skin, Egg Loaf, Charboiled Pork Chop with Steamed Rice) = $6.95...one of my favorite rice entree,
#87 ""Bi Nuong La Lot"" (Beef wrapped in Hawaiian Lot Leaf) =$9.50..quite delicious,
#90 ""Banh Xeo"" (Pan-Fried Cake with Pork & Shrimp) = $7.95...awesome taste,
#8 ""Ca Phe Phin Sua (Nong Hay Da)"" is a french style hot or cold filtered coffee with condensed milk...this, i like sooo much, the blend of sweetness and bitterness is mouthwatering =$2.95,.
They also serve beer but ""33"" is the Vietnamese Beer you ought to try =$2.95.

The smell of barbecue in the air will fill your nostrils from other diners' choice of Special Dish called ""Dac Biet"". If you order this,it is to be cooked by you on the table, on a Griddle. This is is an array of meats or seafood on a platter as your choice from the menu listed as #80-#81 with a price ranging from$18.95 - $25.95. Especially a great choice for 2 or more dining companions.

This is my go-to place eventhough early morning hours, especially it is open Seven Days A Week from 9:00 a.m. to 3 a.m.

The waiter suggests the lemongrass chicken so I go with that. The wifey orders a Vermicelli bowl asking to substitute grilled chicken instead.

The Pho arrives first...Broth is clean and flavorful, noodles just right... overall, good dish. Lemongrass Chicken and Vermicelli Bowl arrive.
The Lemongrass Chicken obviously has been reheated and the vermicelli bowl has beef, instead of chicken.WTH????

One bite and I send the chicken plate back and ask to order something else...THE WAITER NEVER CAME BACK!

I literally know how much quantity the dish that i order normally comes out until i have recently visited here. 
Our waitress comes to us to take our order and i asked her a few questions on her menu and she literally says "" ihave no idea"".  I asked are you new here, because i found it odd to not know anything on there menu.   I ordered the beef marinated griddled on your table dish which comes with a side of vegetables.  The vegetables came out not even a half portion of what it should usually come out and complained about it, and found out later that the waitress was the owner.  Isnt that funny?  she has no idea what is in and whats on the menu.  HORRIBLE!
She was the most rude person i have ever met in my life.  Because of her rudeness and not wanting to give us what we pay for and wanted, i did not want to pay for what i had not eaten, i had told her i will pay for what i ate but this is ridiculous because i havent even ate half of what i ordered, and she brings a box and says take it to go.  I immediately got angry and said no, and she called the POLICE! hahahhaa.  The officer was a great respectful man and told me to just pay for it and report this restaurant to the Health department/news to get the on t.v to show them how bad they are and he gave me an event number for the case.  I only give them a 2 star because all there servers are really nice, a bit slow but at least respectful, except the lady owner.  She was straight up rude and needs to be taught a lesson.

If you eat Pho, you know the tables are gonna be dirty, the service poor, floors not swept..... but that's the norm.  Minus all that and get down to the Pho itself.  This place is the best so far in Vegas.... better than the ""best in vegas"" Pho Saigon 8 (they paid off the reviewers, if you ask me)

I had the #10 Pho dac biet (special).  Broth is good n tasty, doesn't seem to be any MSG?  The best meat is the Tai (rare steak) be sure to eat this first....as it is very tender than most other places.... veggie tray had like 9 slices of Jalepenos!  Gotta have my Jalap-penos...tea is served in a glass tumbler HK style but I burned my fingers trying to drink it (should be plastic) 

The menu is more extensive than just a Pho place.... rice plates, bun, bo 7 mon....(beef seven ways)  saw lots of peeps having that.....must be gooood here.

I also ordered the pork meat ball spring rolls,  They weren't really pork meat balls, more like pork meat logs cut into planks.

That being said I've been here at least 30 times with friends and family and I'm always so satisfied. 

The pho is flavorful in itself, although it's true that there are times that it isn't served piping hot. Most of the time it does come out pretty hot, but when it doesn't it still is hot enough to cook my raw beef shank that I get in my number 11, which is hot enough in my opinion. I personally like to add some lime juice and a little soy sauce cus I'm a salty eater. I also tend to get an order of eggrolls to share with the boyfriend. Always taste so good, can't resist ordering some every time we go there. 

We also like to get the #89, the diced beef salad. That beef is to die for, and half the time I can't decide between a bowl of delicious pho or some of that delicious beef salad. My boyfriend likes to get it as a smaller portion with tomatoe rice when I'm more focused on my pho.

We've tried a few different things here and they all taste pretty good, but the #11 & #89 are our favorites with an order of eggrolls. Thai tea is also great here. 

I've gone to several pho places all over Vegas and most of them are more expensive for a less flavorful broth. Pho So 1 just feels like home. 

Unfortunately they've raised prices recently and sometimes forget to wash the lettuce that comes with the egg rolls. We always get seated right away but service is not the best. They're straight to the point, not really bad but not necessarily good.

My man is on a ""eating healthy"" kick so he knew my old Asian parents would be just fine with going there.  My dad and I were doing the Tom/Bo Nuong Vi ( shrimp/beef we grill at table and roll ourselves), my man had pho tai ( rare beef pho) and the kids all had pho with no meat.

My mom (being vietnamese/chinese) was SO picky cause you know how old school asian moms are- nothing is as good as theirs. So she finally settled on the banh xeo (crepe like thing with shrimp, bean sprouts, fried and served with herbs and nuoc mam).  I think she complained the whole time that it was a little hard- not as soft as how she's had it in SF...okay mom, but you finished the dish...so it wasn't that bad?

My dad and I thoroughly enjoyed our dish- with the shrimp paste dipping sauce.  I think that's the best part of the dish!!  Yes, yes, I am SO asian cause that dip makes you stink SO bad, but is oh SO good!  Anyhow, they bring out all the condiments to our dish- lettuce, assortment of herbs, rice paper and vermicelli noodles.  We grill up all the shrimp and beef and roll away...YUM! Word of advice, don't cook the beef too long or it becomes really tough..

We also ordered a beef carpaccio dish (Bo Tai Chanh) that was really good, the beef was so tender. 

The place wasn't too busy when we arrived at 7:30pm but next thing you know, it filled up.  It seemed like a lot of people ordered the shrimp/beef dish that we had, but how can you not when first thing you see is people grilling meat at the table when you walk in?

Overall it was a good night.  Service was decent, better then most Vietnamese places, all you had to do was wave to someone at the counter and they were right over.

They were doing pretty brisk business at about 2:30pm, which I wouldn't think is a peak time for lunch. It was a good sign. I was tempted to order the pho dac biet, but I gravitated toward my childhood favorite pho chin nam (well-done brisket and flank) as soon as I saw it on the menu. A small bowl is $6.95, and a large bowl at $7.95, which is probably about par for the course here in Vegas.

It took at least 5 minutes for them to come out with my bowl, which may not be a good sign. The best places will have a broth going and be able to fill a bowl very quickly. However, my worries disappeared when I started filling my mouth with piping hot goodness. The broth is nice and seems relatively clean, and the meat is generous. The portion size is also pretty standard.

There were things that could've been better though. Unfortunately, I think the only upgrade from the small to the large is the amount of meat, not the pho noodles. I started running out of noodles about two-thirds of the way through. I also got a relatively small portion of thai basil on the side, but at least it's fresh. Most egregiously however, the flank meat was hardly cut at all, so I found myself tearing away at the huge slices with my mouth. I did enjoying having a large piece of meat in my mouth, but it's probably too much for some people to handle.

For now, Pho Kinh Do is still the best in Vegas for my money, but I have no problems recommending this place as well. I might even go back and try some of the other dishes on the menu if I'm in the area.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,2,4,rFshmbQ0pL0WqGyQg6JDuQ

Food is always consistent, and decent. Prices are very good, but when you get the bill,  check it against the menu. They like to sneak an extra dollar or two in there.

Spring roll is good, but if you get it late at night, you know it was made at lunch time, and the penut sauce is not thick, so ask for an extra portion.

The Pho is usually very good, though lateley, they have cut down on the portions of beef in the soup. 

This is not a place to take someone that you do not have a solid relationship with.

This is the traditional Vietnamese soup with thinly sliced beef and meatballs.  It has beef broth and noodles.  Everything is perfect: broth, noodles, meat, veggies, & sauces.  Sometimes I start with goi cuon.  These are Vietnamese summer rolls.  Light and refreshing.  I love the peanut sauce they are served with.  This place is not high society and the food is not ""the best I ever had"", but it is consistently really good.  I've never been disappointed.",tixImBjX6uTCBDYcg0JvuA,0,0,5,ULEg-WaFbwkYaNn827ejwA

I have been here for years but today I decided to never go back again.

I ordered a #22.. Just noodles & soup & the broth tasted super watered down. I normally get a pho tai though, which I haven't had issues with.

They did give me a lot of noodles in the #22 though but the horrible broth made it unbearable.

The waiter cracked a stupid joke saying ""he doesn't have time"" when my girlfriend ordered shrimp spring rolls & then asked him to come back since she didn't know what else she wanted. (Too lazy to edit this sentence)

She ordered a side of chicken & a side of white rice. She didn't want a whole big order because she said she won't be able to finish it. I had a bite of the chicken & it tasted pretty good.

I finished my water & put it at the edge of the table. Waiter drops off my girlfriend's chicken & rice & doesn't refill our empty waters. After another 10 minutes, I got up & went to the front to grab my own water (they have a lot poured & lined up in a tray)

I paid in cash & was too upset to leave them a tip. The cashier shorted me all 3 of my pennies. I was so sick of this place I didn't even want to leave them that. We just left with our unfinished chicken.

Decided to go to Pho Kim Long & Pho Saigon 8 from now on until both of the places upsets me & then I'll just pick my favorite pho place based on taste alone & not service & begrudgingly go there without expecting much.",L81XheMK8cTbA5fa6KuGTQ,0,0,1,4IExZFsSTa6Ecr-cQxbJzg

After eating Pho Little Saigon, we had to try something different. Our friend recommended this place. And yes, I will be coming back if I don't feel like stuffing myself with Vegas buffets. 

We tried #80, which is the beef with lemongrass. You get rice paper, sauces, TONS of veggies (yes...I RIKE!), vermicelli, rice etc. I've never had this dish before and I don't know the name but you cook your own meat and make your own personalized wraps. This way you can judge how much vermicelli, veggies, meat or sauces goes in your wraps.

Service was good too. I usually don't expect the best service at Asian restaurants anyways. I'm so accustomed to nonchalant service that it's second nature not to care.

Honestly, it's probably made for two or more people to share. But my cousin ordered the Bun Cha Gio and barely finished that. There was no way she was going to help me. It was all good. I powered through it and actually wasn't even that full by the end.

Before the meals arrive, each customer's given a glass of hot tea to sip on. We're usually up for the beef flank pho and fried egg rolls (the sauce is awesome btw!). They go hand-in-hand like Noah and Allie from the notebook, incomplete with each other. 

Another thing I like about this place is that they accept requests to change the usual vermicelli to egg noodles (thin yellow). Vegetables are served on the side with mung bean sprouts. Not the classiest nor the most well-decorated place but it's a healthy alternative to the usual burgers and steaks, cheap and convenient.

I ordered the #10, which was Pho with pretty much everything: rare steak, brisket, tendon, tripe, and flank, and also ordered an Iced French Filtered Coffee with condensed milk.

First things first, I have to taste the broth, and it was good. It had a nice clean taste, but it lacked the fragrance probably due to the lack of spices and herbs. I enjoyed all the meat, especially the tendon as they were big slices rather than small bite-size pieces I'm used to. The brisket was tender and not as fatty, and the tripe was tender too. They give you a good amount of rare steak, and it wasn't the freshest, but still all right. The servers were nice enough to give us an extra side bowl of hot broth to cook the rare steak. I particularly liked the noodles as it was thin, soft, and soaked the broth well. I was looking for the fish sauce, but it wasn't on the table! Whaaat? A Vietnamese restaurant without fish sauce? That's blasphemous! I asked the server, and it was stored on the fridge. That was close! I was ready to give this a 1-star if it didn't have any.

For six people, they definitely didn't give us enough bean sprouts and basil. I can toss in the entire plate, which I did plus some more because a couple of my friends are against bean sprouts and basil.

I waited and waited for the coffee to filter through into the cup, and when I took off the filter, it was barely half full... Plus, the bottom had the condensed milk! Uhhhh, this is not enough, especially when I'm running on fumes. When I poured the coffee into the ice, it was thick! I had mostly condensed milk with bit of extra strong tasting coffee. You failed, sorry.

The service was good. There was an army of people just standing there waiting to serve! They were attentive, and refilled our water and brought whatever we needed in a timely manner. Also, the food came out quick.

Overall, that coffee was a complete failure, but I did enjoy the pho. You receive a good amount of meat and a decent size bowl of Pho. My favorite was the tendons, and the thin noodles make for easy eating and slurping. The broth was light and clean, but lacked fragrance. Would I come back here on my next visit? Eh, maybe. Probably not. :)",0aNZMeSxwIG6N7uy3a65ig,3,0,3,L0m9DT5kVFKC7lfTUnWvGQ
4657288,2011-05-20,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Let me preface my first pho experience in vegas with the following back story.  The last couple of days we had hiked the grand canyon, along with camping out so we were kinda tired of American food. After stopping at the Rio Seafood buffet the night before we were up for a change. 

Good pho in vegas?  No way, but i figured my Vietnamese friends would know better than me. I'll go ahead and separate my review into two parts,  the food and service. 

Food,  the pho was just ok. I got the Pho bo vien which is the Pho with meatballs. I thought the soup was a little bland for me. The portion size was decent and I got a lot of meat in mine, which is good. The price was a little higher than what I'm used to, but its Vegas, not So Cal, so not too bad I guess.The question I asked myself was, would I come to this place if it was located in So Cal. The question is probably not. The food was very average, nothing made it stand out. 

Now on to the service, The order came out pretty quick which i liked, however thats where the service got interesting. We had to ask for napkins, seriously what restaurant doesn't give you napkins to start off ? Someone in our group ordered the rice with pork chop, looked good, but we had to ask 4 or 5 times for a knife. Overall the service was pretty bad, and this is with asian people. 

I was told that with Vietnamese places, the ideal is to get good food out fast and not care about service. This is certainly true about this place, except the food was just decent.",QItQyU9VI96rDFt58xUHOg,0,0,3,JOBjLxhoi0RKzIcuhEiHgw

The pho is satisfactory. The broth came out hot, but nothing special. Noodles were flavorless as well. 

I was sad to see the bánh hi dish butchered. The rice vermicelli was woven just fine, but the choice of meat was just bad. It was like meats off a skewer you find at an American restaurant. The proper way to sautee the meats with some onions and sauce. The meat just was lacking any real flavor. So much failure for such a traditional dish.

Like most Asian restaurants, what is service? You sit down, order, eat, ask for check, pay, and leave.

While the Pho here is satisfactory, the issue with the bánh hi is disappointing. With so many other comparable Vietnamese places, might as well go to one of those other places instead.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,2,1,2,BalJhRo_yOUZGtIX2j-K1Q

They would never ask a white guy to pay with cash if he wanted to use his card. It's 2015, people hardly carry cash anymore!

Pho So 1 is doing a great job.  My experience with pho has been limited to the San Gabriel area of Los Angeles.  I'd have to admit the pho here was really tasty and they had all the regular add on's I get in Los Angeles:  Onions for one.

One thing I was disappointed in was the spring rolls.  They were not tightly wrapped and the dipping sauce was not very good.  I ended up dipping the spring rolls in fish sauce instead.

They do a good job on the Vietnamese coffee too.

Skip the rolls, go for Pho.  Just so you know this place is not on the strip it's on a stretch of Spring Mountain road packed with Asian restaurants and yes, massage parlors.  There are tons of options, so go explore.

4729098,2017-09-05,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"This is a long overdue review. I've been here so many times but never left a review, so this is gonna be a super looooong novel. 

We usually come here once a week or every other week and order a giant bowl of pho (pho Xe Lua meaning pho with an XL size) and a regular pho. 

We like the broth. My husband hated pho because of the first bad experience, but he really likes it here. I don't like the noodles that they have so I substitute it with the flat rice noodles, which is more similar to what we actually use in pho in Vietnam. 

Service is just okay or even less than average. They drop your water and your food and never come back. They might be back and ask if things are okay, if we get lucky. Sometimes service is bad, today is an example. The giant bowl looks pathetic, feeling like they just put the same portion of a regular bowl into an XL bowl and pour a lot of broth in it. It's just not even close to the amount we usually get. When I asked the manager/supervisor about it, good thing I speak Vietnamese, we argued back and forth and eventually he said it did look less than normal and gave us more noodles, not meat though. 

The charbroiled pork noodles (#47 and #48) are good too. Sometimes the sauce is a little salty as they put too much fish sauce in it and I don't like fish sauce that much. 

Another good dish is #80, grilled marinated beef wrapped in lettuce with noodles. The only thing is that you have to grill it and wrap it yourself at the table. But it's very good and is really a popular dish here. 

#91 the grilled pork meatball is a little sweet and dry for my taste. I enjoyed the first few bites, but eventually tired of the dryness. 

#63, Bun bo Hue is very flavorful. If you don't like pork blood like me, you can ask to substitute it with more beef. 

#95 is just ehhh. It's bland. I wouldn't recommend getting this at all, unless you pour a bowl of fish sauce on it to make it more salty. 

Overall, food gets 4 stars, service is 2.5 stars. In total, 3 stars.",NXn0RBMGCkKN_lIy7vkmIw,2,0,3,0cZAiL8IiX6W5iAZgeZHkA

The only other option is #8 up the street, heading west right before Jones. My friends and I have been coming to this place for the last 15 years. It used to be true hole in the wall with holes in the wall then they upgraded the joint with LCD tvs, then they removed the LCD tvs. I guess they decided they were too showy. How can you charge those prices and then renovate it with marble floors, countertops, and LCD tvs and pretend to be affordable??? I don't know. I just eat there.

The pho is usually good. Sometimes the meat has a little fat and if the cook is lazy the broth is not 100% steaming hot. Which isn't a problem except I usually like to get the beef on the side. Yes, you can ask for the meat on the side. Where they will put in on a small plate and you dunk it in when you get it.

The restroom, like most Asian restrooms, is a place I often tiptoe around to pee. I am just glad I don't need to sit and can pretend I am a firetruck hose in these instances.

Like most pho places if you go in as 1 person or 3 people, they give you 1 plate of mint and bean shoots, so you may want to ask for another plate if you actually like veggies like me.

The broth is usually good although there were times where it was too fatty and oily for my taste. It usually taste a little more hearty compared to the pho broth at #8. They probably put more MSG in it I assume. Whatever the reason, it's the better broth in town. I heard that they opened another location and took the cooks with them to open the new one so maybe that's why the broth was not what I was accustomed with.

But for $8, and you want a not bowl of pho, you can't go wrong with this place. Just make yourself a firehose if you are a dude and need to donate some to Lake Mead.

Like most Asian restaurants, I usually try to sit away from the door, so I sniff my nose, point at a table somewhere and ask if I can sit there. Being an Asian restaurant, they can usually care less, and say ok.

When you are done, look at the number pasted on your table, go up and pay. Simple as that. No one to come and ask you to take your check, money order, or cashier's check (like a proper French restaurant probably does in Paris).",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,1,0,4,gTsmd-PXl26JM6RKRQ14xQ

I have tried Pho several times and other items that I normally ate at Pho So 1 and the food just weren't the same. I finally reached a conclusion: whoever managed the kitchen or whoever the main chef was, they must not be working there anymore.

First of all, the good old day Pho broth at PS1 wasn't great but at the same time it wasn't bad. Now, the broth tastes so bad, I don't come to PS1 for pho anymore. The broth tastes like somebody went to the Asian market and bought the dried pho flavor in a teabag pouch and dip that pouch into boiling water and served that to the customer. It was that bad.

Other food also did not taste the same. Beside Pho, PS1 was also known for their ""Bo Nuong Vi"", which basically allowed you to grill meet at the table. Their dipping sauce used to be soooooooooo good, but now it's smelly.

Another good indicator is the place is not crowded like before anymore. Too bad, because I used to like PS1. :-(",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,2,1,2,_IduWzSThIMbitJ2O3UbeQ

The Pho came out barely warm, it seemed to be their problem, many reviewers also complained about this, I complained and they immediately replaced with another bowl with piping hot broth, the broth was amazing, it had the flavor of bone and well cooked beef instead of many pho restaurants using a lot of MSG and some can broth, this Pho is definitely a 4 stars, perhaps even 4.5 stars, the meat was plentiful.

The grilled beef was really grilled, the problem was they used lean beef so there was not as much flambe taste as would have been the case had they use a rib eye or a nice sirloin steak. It came with vermicelli, rice paper and vegetables. We would definitely come back for the Pho, I wanted to order the grilled ground beef wrapped with bacon but either did not see it there or forgot the name to order that, that dish is the best in the 7 course beef.

4884694,2010-09-25,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"This is the best Pho I've had in Las Vegas.  In southern California, Pho restaurants are as common as McDonald's and Starbucks, and even those who grow up not being Vietnamese become addicted to Pho.  Being from southern California, I had to find myself a great Pho restaurant when I moved to Vegas.  I have tried practically every place between my house and Chinatown, and can say that Pho So 1 is the best I've had.  

The flavor of the broth is what differentiates a great Pho from an average Pho.  Meaty, spiced, aromatic, and palate-covering are the characteristics of a great Pho.  Pho So 1 has all of this going on in their bowl of Pho.  The broth is meaty and has aromatics even before adding the fresh herbs.  The aromatics seem to come in the form of Star Anise, or Chinese Five Spice, or something of that nature.  Whatever it is, it's great. 
I like to tear up all my herbs, and add them in to stir them around to create a smell that will likely make you roll your eyes at how awesome it smells.  You know that feeling you get when you smell the food your Grandma used to make?  While nothing can truly compete with the smell of Grandma's Bagna Cauda, this aromatic smell of Pho is as close as it can get.  

I usually get a Thai Iced Tea along with the Pho, maybe even some Spring Rolls.  Both are very good, and I would highly suggest them.

4974378,2009-07-16,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Pho So 1 has become one of my favorites for Vietnamese food in Vegas.  Our first visit, we stuck with the basics...

* 10. Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua ""Special Combo with Rare Slices of Steak, Well-Done Brisket, Flank, Tendon, and Tripe with Rice Noodle Soup"" ($6.95) - A generous amount of food, one of the first times I ever had leftovers to take home from a regular order of pho.  

* 40. Mi Bo Kho ""Beef Stew with Egg Noodles"" ($6.95) - The Husband was impressed with their version of one of his favorite dishes.

Service was good too - tea comes out automatically, unlike some other restaurants we frequent and they are quick to take your order.  Food comes out promptly too.

Within the past week, I've been back twice for this:

* 85. Bo Tom Muc Nhung Dam ""Beef, Shrimp and Squid dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce"" ($25.95) - A platter of raw beef, shrimp, and squid and a pot of hot vinegar broth are presented before you, along with a plate of veggies (various greens, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and pickled daikon and carrots), a plate of rice noodles, rice paper, and a bowl of hot water.  For you first timers, you dip the rice paper in the hot water to get it soft, then you start to load it up with veggies, rice noodle and whatever you cooked up in the hot vinegary broth.  And of course, be sure to dip it in the tasty pineappley sauce thing they give you.  Oh so good!  It's another way for  me to enjoy hot pot - but Vietnamese-style!

Last night we had this one:
* 84B. Bo Tom Nhung Dam ""Beef & Shrimp dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce"" ($23.95) - Same thing, but without the squid.  I just love it because it's light, and you can ask for more veggies and rice paper if necessary.  That dipping sauce has a sweet and sour quick with a fruity twist and just good!

* 89. Bo Luc Lac ""Diced Beef Salad"" ($9.50) - This was a semi-raw beef dish with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, limes, and peanuts.  Be sure to dip this in the fish sauce too for that extra tangy bite!  Yum!

There are a bunch of other items in their Special Dishes section that I'm anxious to try.  It's a generous amount of food though, so it's better to go with a group of at least three.  (I think #s 84B and 85 are decent portions for a party of three, add some eggrolls if you're still hungry.)

The first two times we went late at night, and they had a steady stream of customers.  But yesterday during dinnertime, it was packed!  They sure do get a lot of business here, from the Vietnamese community (always a good sign) and outside as well.  We did have to wave them down for more water, tea, extra condiments, etc.  But it was no big deal since it was busy.  Definitely one of my places to go for Vietnamese food beyond the basic pho.

I had the delicious egg rolls.  I've had them before and loved them.  But I had experienced poor service before, which is a reoccurring theme in the reviews for this restaurant.

I was seated right away by the host, a middle-aged looking gentleman wearing a green sweater.  He seated me, took my drink order, and indicated my server would be over.  My server NEVER came to my table.  The host later returned and took my order and periodically checked on me while I ate.

I sat in 1 of the booths along the right wall.  I noticed all 4 booths, including mine, had 1 or 2 customers only each.  The only time a server helped 1 of the tables on my side of the restaurant was when the customer shouted and waved him over; he had to do that 2xs.  No server came to the table in front nor behind me the whole 30 minutes I was there.

The left side of the restaurant had whole families or groups of 3 or more seated at each table and booth.  The servers were plenty busy helping them.  Social bias anyone?

Just before I went to the cashier, I spoke to the host about tipping him directly.  As required, I went to the cashier to pay my bill.  I asked to speak to the manager, who was behind the cashier.  I explained my (and my side of the restaurant's) lack of service.   The manager apologized for the poor service. 

I also explained I wanted to tip the host directly.  The manager explained that the tips get pooled and to leave it on the table.  I explained I didn't want any of my tip money to go to the server who NEVER came to my table.  Then I asked to speak to the host so I could tip him.  The manager said, ""He just left,"" which, I believe, was total bullshit.  I looked around and could not find the host.  I told him, ""Okay.  Then I'm leaving no tip.""

I left.  Pho So 1 lost a customer.  And I recommend everyone who keeps going back & experiencing poor service, to just stop going.

5002481,2013-01-15,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Hello my Yelp friends.  I have been remiss in my yelping as of late, as I have made a major move.  I now live between 3 locations in the great basin/Mojave desert region, spanning Nevada, Arizona and the California border.  I'm living like the guys on American Pickers, buying and selling collectibles and anything else I can make a buck on.  I also direct the Food and Beverage and showroom department of a small hotel in Las Vegas...I know, how do I do it all?  Hence my lapse in reviews...enough updates,  here we go:

In the miles I put in for work, a lot of meals are on the road.  I have a lot of Hawaii Yelp friends, so I'll start in Las Vegas....the 9th island.  Since leaving Hawaii I most long for the food.  Don't get me wrong, out here I am reveling in the great Mexican food, home made mashed potatoes, and wonderful bar b que.  But one has to go long and far out here to find the elements of what makes the Hawaii food scene so great in close proximity.  I love Vietnamese food.  This was one of my early quests as soon as I got out here.

Pho So 1 is located in the chinatown district of Las Vegas.  The Chinatown here is more of an Asiatown, incorporating Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, Korean and Japanese restaurants, shops, services and industry.  It was 3 months into my move that I finally got a taste of Vietnamese cuisine...what a relief, as I was used to it at least once a week in Hawaii.  Pho So 1 is large by Vietnamese restaurant standards.  It will seat about 150, and is open from 9am to 3am daily.  Business is always brisk to crowded.  I tend to be a late night client and it's always bustling at this time, but I've always gotten a seat without waiting.

My first visit:  Large pho #14 with tendon, lean beef, fatty brisket, stomach.  An order of  what we call summer roll in Hawaii, but is called spring roll out here.  And what we call spring roll in Hawaii is called egg roll here, but is not like the traditional Chinese eggrolls you get at the chop suey houses out here or at Jack in the Box...a little confusing.  I also had my beloved Vietnamese iced coffee.

The ""spring roll"" was a welcome delight.  Every bit as good as the best ""summer"" rolls I've had in Hawaii.  The correct wrap, with the right pull, tenderness and slight chew.  This summer roll is fat with a great balance of noodles, lettuce, basil, pork and shrimp.  Served with a serviceable peanut sauce that I like to enhance with a squirt of Sri racha.  Selicious.

The pho was big.  Copious amounts of meat and meat by products, I would say almost twice the amount at Hawaii Vietnamese restaurants.  Also almost bowl covering amounts of onion, green onion, cilantro on top which I love.  Noodles are also ample.  The broth is mellow but rich with a slight background of anise.  Also served on the side is the usual suspects of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and other greens.  I must say the bean sprouts here are pristine white and clean.  The problem is the broth is luke warm to my taste.  This has been the case each time I went.  They do steam the noodles separately because as I break the noodles, I do get a small release of heat, the the broth itself is not very hot...I wonder if this is a mainland thing with lawsuits of people burning themselves with hot liquid.  On a side note, a Korean restaurant I ate at next door to this place would not allow me to take out their ban chan or na mul because of lawsuits....I think the ignorant bought the kim chee and let it sit forever like dill pickles and got sick....that's another story.

The ice coffee came via the tableside French press method, so I waited with great anticipation after a 3 month lack of iced coffee.  Their was a LOT of condensed milk....it really needed it.  The coffee sharp astringently bitter, not the real deal.....if you use all the condensed milk you have sweet coffee milk....sigh.

Something else to try is their Hanoi style pork and egg roll Bun.  I have not seen this style of Bun in Hawaii.  This method plates the dish rather than in a bowl.  Two types of pork are served, the traditional grilled pork slices, sweet and robust, and a ""pork loaf"" grilled that is very meaty, not bready.   The usual veggies are laid out with the vermicelli, the meat kept away from the cold veggies in a separate dish.  The difference is the full leaf lettuce, meant to be used to wrap your meat, noodles and condiment vegetables, fish sauce and hot sauces.  This dish definitely covers the taste senses of sweet, spicy, salt, bitter, sour.  Textures are covered of crunch, chew, squish, warm, cold.  Nutrition covered with protein, carbohydrates both low and high glycemic varieties, vitamins, minerals, fats, sugars....clean and fresh with hints of grilled burn from the meat....pure gastronomic satisfaction.",pSI1F88BCHdVGyv217w1zg,3,2,4,CmSn_LGhyK2Qtm7S9yWyEA

Today I ordered  chicken pho and when I got to the bottom noticed something brown in  the tangle of noodles I put in my spoon and saw it was indeed a small roach. The BF didnt say anything ( he shouldve) while we were eating but he wasnt touching his water because something was in it as well.

If it wasn't for ordering chicken, maybe I wouldnt have noticed the roach until it was in my mouth if it was with little  brown beef bits like well done brisket. 

 It was also filthy in there too. Sticky bottles, the floor a mess, etc. It was busy, but there was quite a bit of employees so downtime could be used to maintain cleanliness.

NONONONONONONONONO. 

it sucks because they weren't taking our order for the longest time and I decided if they didn't come after this last order they were serving we were going to walk out as 10minutes just sitting there after it's clear we were looking around and put down the menus. I wish I didn't have decent patience today as I could have avoided roach soup.

We didn't pay, but that is not the point. It's the cost of fucking fastfood so it doesn't mean a lot. It shouldn't be happening.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,12,2,1,v3IbAakSn4yBksy0Hp0fJA

The pho definitely passed my initial ""eye"" test with rare beef still a little pink and good amount of vegetables and herbs. The rare beef was tender and had good flavor. And the free tea they served with the meal was good, but that was the end of the good for me. This was the first time I had pho where the broth was so cloudy and not clear. The broth lacked any depth or complexity when it came to flavor; it was just beef water as far as I was concerned. And the beef balls were very basic with not much flavor either.

I bet Pho So 1's main competition is Pho Kim Long but I much prefer the pho here. 

OTHER STUFF: Other items I've tried are spring rolls and egg rolls, which are both good. And if you have at least 2 people, try the viet bbq (beef & seafood). Its similar to korean bbq where you cook at your table. They use some kind of purple jelly to light the grill which is minimal smoke and doesn't make you reek afterwards. You take the meat and roll it into spring rolls using veggies and rice paper... Fun and interactive food and most of all DERRRICIOUS! My vietnamese friend turned me onto those dessert cups. I've only tried a couple but they're really good! If you have room for an off-beat asian dessert, give those a try (they're inside of the fridge with the beer and sodas.

SERVICE: Dont expect any fancy 5 star service (this is a family-owned asian joint people). But I've been going here for years and they're friendly enough, feed me quick, and refill my drinks when they need to be refilled :)

Upon entering, we were greeted promptly and led to a table by the window.  The menu  is fairly extensive, but all we really wanted was some soup + egg rolls.  I ordered beef and he ordered seafood pho.  The egg rolls are served on a bed of lettuce and huge amounts of carrots and daikon.  Oh, I love daikon.  Really refreshing and cut out the oily feeling you get from the rolls.  The beef pho was on point, but I thought the seafood was just meh (though my hubby enjoyed it).

My friend ordered the Bun Bo Hue and he really liked it. I usually am not a fan of this but I tried a sip of the soup and it was really flavorful. Question though, where was the pork blood? He gave me the pork knuckles because he knows I really enjoy gnawing on them and he looked away and back at me and I was already done. It was really good.

I ordered the fried pork that comes with mint leaves, shiso leaves, vermicelli (Thin and easier to separate. Much better than normal vermicelli noodles IMO) the fried pork which tasted more like shrimp (really delicious), lettuce leaves, cucumbers, pickled daikon and carrots and dipping sauce. It's a little troublesome to make because you have to wet the wrapping paper (spring roll paper) but once you have all the ingredients combined, its fantastic. I found this perfect on the day it was over 100*F outside. 

We also had the spring rolls which were just normal spring rolls. The sauce on the other hand was good. It was sweet and a little tart but mild when I dipped the spring roll.. actually drenched the spring roll in the sauce. I really liked it okay? :)

They have a huge menu. It seems like their specialties are in the back and one is the beef you grill yourself which can feed 2-3 people so I will definitely try that next time I return to Vegas.

Yes, the flavor of the broth should be the most important thing, but what earns my favor is an impressive veggie offering. Here is where I have found the #1 green goods when ordering the vegetable option. If you like broccoli, carrots, celery, cucumber... get the picture? How does Pho So garden's grow? With a generous helping of vegetables! No tofu, but the other ingredients are so bountiful and fresh, it doesn't matter to me.

Of course, the broth is good too. Clean, balanced, flavorful. The noodles might be a bit on the mushy side, but not objectionable enough to prevent me from being a repeat customer.

Last night, we also made the plunge and ordered the table top beef griddle extravaganza, which comes with rice paper, lettuce, daikon relish, herbs, noodles-- all to create your own little rolls. When you go to Pho So 1, you will always smell the tempting aroma of grilled beef, and there are only so many times you can visit, before you just have to give in and get one for yourself. At around $20, we thought it was a little pricey, but after seeing the portion, it is enough for 3, maybe 4 people. I was a little troubled by the magenta Sterno gel that was directly beneath the meat, and I thought I detected the faint flavor of Sterno in the occasional bite. I probably wouldn't order it again, although constructing spring rolls is fun and a nice diversion if you don't enjoy your dining company (not personally a problem). It is an experience.  

I will admit the floor needs to be swept a bit more often. My advice: just look straight ahead. 

Regardless, this is still the name I will call out when I am asked, ""Where do you wanna go for pho?""",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,9,4,kqDHCHtbNWmNXOcE-7kV_w

During their lunch and dinner time they're on it with serving you but for late night (12am to 3am) the service isn't as great.

It doesn't require that much effort to follow through with customer service during the last couple of hours before closing. Also, I seen a roach a couple of times run across the restaurant. When you sit in a booth sometimes the seats, floors, and tables are still sticky, which is why I'm not surprised they had some roaches roaming around. 

For about two pho bowls and a side like spring rolls would cost me $28 without tip but including tax. Their pho tastes good, which is something I recommend you get.

Price is very reasonable each dish was under $9.00 if I am not mistaken. You can tell that this is a local establishment with most of the patrons I would assume living or working in the area, another thing is the place has lots of seating with great air-conditioning, I think it was 115 degrees that day but when we stepped in to the restaurant it was a nice cool 70.
Yeah Good Job!

If your in the area this is good pit stop for lunch or even dinner,,,,,,",YN9N-NhIP6_jTG6AUHgw1A,0,0,4,zF5FGlzIH5YL6pBQbhx3QQ

Although it's not the BEST pho I've had I think it's pretty good for Pho in Vegas, where there are plenty of non-authentic Asian food on the strip. The prices were pretty reasonable for pho so no complaints there.

We ordered the Pho Dac Biet and eggrolls... I think I've had bigger bowls of Pho in the SGV but their soup was piping HOT when it came out, which I loved! I hate lukewarm soup... The veggies all looked pretty clean and washed so that was also a plus. 

Overall, I would come back if I had a car, but with it being off the strip, I'm not sure that I would taxi it all the way here and back,,,",gPh8rpoOq2hjyhF2pAdn2A,0,0,3,czhAtf2VXXTufpHBGUt0Zw

""Pho So 1 who?""
""So I Pho So 1 muhfuckas wanna fine me. First ninjas gotta find me. What's 50 grand to a muhfucka like me?""
AHAHAHA! That was laaaaaame!!!

Vietnamese thits and rolls are what I had here. Egg rolls, spring rolls that gave me fat rolls. ""Are you ready to order?"" Ummm...we just got here, give us a chance.

Egg Rolls:
My friend loves their egg rolls so we got them. They were tasty and they were actually not bad but I just think Kinh Do's egg rolls are better. 3.5/5

Spring Rolls:
The spring rolls themselves seem a bit dry and they're not fresh. The peanut sauce was really runny. 1.5/5

#9 Pho Ribeye Steak:
Their pho comes in either small or large but I wasn't asked what size I wanted. Out comes a small bowl of lukewarm pho. The broth was lacking in flavor so I had to use a lot of Sriracha and Hoisin sauce. 2/5

#54 Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:
Charbroiled pork, egg rolls with vermicelli and veggies. This was good. The portion is pretty big. You get a good amount of protein and the noodles weren't dry even after re-heating. 4/5

Sure, they're open til 3am but there's another Vietnamese restaurant (PKL) not far from here that's open 24/7 and has better food. Pay at the counter when you're done but be careful because the floor is very oily and slippery. Gross!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,5,2,iMmoYPgHTXFEUnELCfCXng
5320621,2012-02-01,0,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Being Vietnamese, Pho So 1 is one of the best places to go to dine if you're looking for warm, beefy soup in the middle of the night (it's comfort food to some people).. or at like 2 AM when you're drunk and have nowhere else to go sober up... I have to say out of all of the Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas, Pho So 1 is not that bad compared to most Vietnamese restaurants...  (but that's purely personal preference since I am Vietnamese and get home cooked meals.. I'll try to be biased about the food..)

The number 1 thing I always recommend everyone trying if you've never had an experience at Pho So 1 is to try their Bo 7 Mon & Bo Nuong Vi ..

Bo 7 Mon is their 7 courses of beef, a combination of different varieties of marinated beef dishes you can try, each with different veggies and sauces that will compliment the dish. Each dish is distinct because the beef is marinated in different Vietnamese herb and seasonings. It's definitely more ethnic and strays away from the typical Pho that everyone knows more about. Vietnamese people love to drink beer and eat this as a party dish.. so if you're a foreigner, definitely try it for a true Vietnamese dining experience.

Now, Bo Nuong Vi is my absolute favorite thing to order at Pho So 1. Bo Nuong Vi means beef grilled over fire.. so the course itself will come with a portable grill right at your table with hot flames burning over the grill itself. This dish starts off at $20 for beef and you can also add shrimp and squid (definitely recommend).. it's Vietnamese BBQ at its best... The beef and seafood is marinated with lemon grass, garlic and sesame.. You dip the meat into sesame oil before putting it on the grill and once on fire, the smell is absolutely irresistible (beware, you WILL smell like BBQ food afterwards so keep that in mind for special occasions) .. The dish is served with assortments of fresh vegetables, vermicelli, Vietnamese rice paper that is used to wrap everything together, including the meat and eaten sort of like a spring roll (except you wrap it all together yourself), and most importantly the fish sauce and pineapple fish sauce (which is a thicker fish sauce that is both sweet and salty.. a lot of people cannot eat this but if you really want authentic flavors, try it out).. This dish is best if eaten for 2-3 people.. but you can get away with 4 people, however I definitely recommend ordering extra meat, Overall, for 2 people, you'll only pay $10 each and for 4, I would say about $10-$13 per person with extra meat sides. Definitely cheaper than most Korean BBQ!",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,1,0,4,B9yzU4jhSjFak2cOn1oSpg
5322403,2012-02-24,5,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"So Pho King Good! (Those of you who know how to pronounce Pho will get that!)

This is my favorite little Vietnamese place. I don't know what half the stuff on the menu is, but I had a Vietnamese friend help a sista out.

You cannot go wrong with rare beef pho. It cures hangovers. It's a scientific fact! And it's huge. I don't think I've ever seen anyone finish it!

If you have a group of friends, I recommend BBQ. (I love the steak and shrimp combo). So good and you cook it at your table... it's like camping, but with less bugs and not having to pee behind a bush!

There spring rolls are great and the sauce that you dip it in (not sure what kind it is or what it's made of, but it's divine) has a sweet, fishy taste. I know it sounds weird, but try. You'll be glad you did. You can get the fried, too.

I know this may sound bad, but I think this adds to the awesomeness... When people that are Vietnamese (the natives) are the regular patrons, they must be doing some right.

I am a fan of the Vietnamese iced coffee with consended sweetened milk. Don't drink this late at night. It's extra strong and you will sleep poorly. They had this other drink which had jello and was pink, it looked tasty, but I didn't like it. It was very pretty, though.

Getting a server to approach you often takes some time. Waving at them will only irritate the best even more. It is best to just sit tight and wait until they are ready for you. With that being said, you better be ready to order once they come around. 

With all the cons, why is it even worth going? The answer, the food. I do like them better than their hectic and obnoxiously busy competition. The grilled shrimp wraps are amazing. They set down a portable grill in the middle of the table and all of the condiments for spring rolls and you just assemble them yourselves. It is absolutely delicious. Their pork and shrimp spring rolls are okay. After eating my mom's there is no doubt that homemade is better. Their pho is good for when I can't have my dad's.

But people claimed the food was good, so I decided to toss myself to the ring and see what happens.

I'm not a major pho fan.  My experience largely extends to cracking jokes of the ""Pho real"" variety (yes, this is what I do).  For all the concern, however, none of the problems listed in reviews really happened in my experience.  Fast service, it sometimes took a moment to get the server's attention, but they were attentive when you did, they brought out something that we didn't ask for... not as a mess up, but they had an extra and offered the side dish for us to try just because.

The food itself?  Again, pho is not my usual first choice, but it's good to break out of the comfort zone, and to all credit, the food was tasty.   It was all well cooked, flavorful, and diverse.  I enjoyed it, felt full, and had a pleasant lunch.  Really, that's all I want from a dining experience.

When the check came, the price was not bad at all.  Two people for less than $20 is NOT a bad deal.

Service: 2 stars, (including the rude cashier)

After having eaten at this location numerous times, I was craving their vermicelli bowl, so made the trek to Chinatown.  The restaurant was about 75% percent full when I arrived shortly before 9pm on a Saturday night.  After looking at the menu, I decided on my favorite option, Vermicelli Bowl with charbroiled pork and an egg roll.  It came out in less than 10 minutes, and the pork was piping hot atop cool noodles and chopped romaine.  I added the requisite fish sauce, hoisin, and of course a good dose of Sriracha. Yum!

My only issue with the bowl was the pork was much fattier than I remember, which left some remaining in the bowl when I was done.  This is rare for me, considering I usually gobble down the whole thing.  Despite this, I highly recommend ordering.

It really does only take one employ to spoil an otherwise good experience.  When I went up to the cashier to pay for the $9.99 bowl, I noticed a sign that said $15 minimum for credit card payments.  I handed my card to the cashier and he pointed out the sign, then asked, don't you have cash.  I looked at the two bucks in my wallet and said, ""not enough to pay for the meal"".  In a huff, he said ""fine, I'll take the card, but only this time"". I considered lecturing him about needing to instruct the servers about mentioning this to patrons when they order, but decided against it; not worth it.  After I signed, I thanked him and he said nothing in response. Wow! Unacceptable.  Think I'll find a new Pho restaurant in the valley.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,2,0,3,2KJjSZd4zG2j-7bfgNbM8Q

So we walked in with a party of 15 and it took 10-15 minutes for us to get seated.  I understood that as this is not a normal sized party.  I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pho xe lua.  First off, I noticed how much more they charged here compared to LA.  
The spring rolls were just ok.  Didn't have much flavor to it.  The dipping sauce did help, but still not that good.  My pho came out and I wasn't sure it was mine because it was a regular sized bowl.  From my experience, xe lua is supposed to be an extra large.  I thought that's why I paid extra for it.  I even asked the server and he said that the xe lua was the same as the dac biet.  
I was confused, but I still ate it and didn't make a big deal about it.  When I took my first bite, I was underwhelmed by the taste.  The soup didn't have that much flavor even after putting in the hoisin, veggies and lime.  The noodles wasn't fresh tasting like I'm used to.  I forgot to mention that the food was luke warm.  It's not piping hot like it's supposed to be.  The meat was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.

The floor is slippery! Be care when you walk ... Even the workers slipped on their own floor. Safety first don't they practice this?

I order the same thing every time - #14 Special Combo, rare slices of steak, well-done brisket, flank, tendon and tripe. 
Describing Pho makes my mouth water. But really, I've tried as many Pho restaurants in Vegas (because this is so hard to get to and it's so inconvenient) but honestly... if you want Pho you have to do it right. 

The broth is perfect - not too greasy but OH SO flavorful. 

The service is hit or miss... you have to make sure they don't forget to put in your order. If they put in your order right away you will be staring at your bowl of heaven's broth and noodles in no time (about 5-10 mins).

Just ask one of the servers if they still have oxtails for the day because it's a daily limited item.  If you had oxtails at California Hotel in downtown, then you will want to try these.  Simmered in broth from the beginning, most likely over 6 hours.  It's extremely tender and flavorful.  Remember to order with Pho broth only.  Eating with noodles will be messy for you.

As far as the rest of the menu, everything is true to Vietnamese flavor.  No fusion here, and that's a good thing.  Everything is also very reasonable in price.  You can be full and satisfied for under $10, tip included.  

As for the service, it's better than most vietnamese restaurants.  Here's a tip.  Walk in, make eye contact with a server and signal how many in your party with your fingers.  After seating, you will be handed menus and probably forgotten about.  Once again, after you made your decision as to what to eat, look up, make eye contact, hand raising if necessary, don't snap fingers, someone will rush over to take your order.  When it's time for the check, go to cashier and tell him/her your table number (located on the chopsticks box).  Or you can ask for the check, up to you, but being Asian, I usually limit my eye contact to two times a day.  

One last thing, this restaurant does grilled meats extremely well.  These meats go into noodles, dry or wet, and also rice.  Cannot go wrong with these.  Many others do not bother to grill as it is very time and space consuming in the kitchen.

(sarcastically) No. The problem isn't that there's too much fat on the meat, there is no meat. Jumping straight to it he said he would take it back with no refund.

When I'm with others, we usually get egg rolls because it's 6 dollars for four and a massive heap of vegetables. The egg rolls are always hot, crisp, and fresh as well.

I once had the grilled meat and shrimp the first time I came here but I can't say much about it because it was about five years ago. I remember having fun though so that probably means the food was good as well!

The waiter dropped off our food and we never saw him again.
When I went to find him after 25 minutes, I asked for more iced tea and some to go boxes.
His snappy reply was something like, ""We are busy and everybody wants something!"".
When I went to pay the check, I discovered they had charged another $1.50 for the iced tea refill!  
When I asked why, the cashier said, ""Well, we have to pay for the ice!""  I told her I could give them the recipe for ice and they could save a lot of money, but she didn't seem to get the joke! 
Our bill was almost $70.00, so to charge for a refill of one iced tea seems a bit much! 
Keep in mind that we were a party of four guys, all ex-cab drivers, and when we get good service, we tip way too much!

Going to start calling it phocaine lol. I normally get Pho with Brisket only and no pasta, I'm really only there to get loaded on the most delicious liquids. The broth, amazing! The jasmine tea, double amazing! The thai tea, would be triple amazing if only they had boba and the serving was bigger. It's never really enough. The Cabernet was also delicious despite it being sutter home?? The only downside is the fresh spring rolls I order when I'm with company didn't come with peanut sauce, and when I do request it, it's not as amazing as it should be. A little to much soy sauce not enough peanut. Other than that I suggest trying this place over any other pho restaurant in town.

.....Instead of ordering our usual fresh spring rolls we ordered fried egg rolls, and what a treat----beautiful visual presentation if their just fried (not microwave reheats) egg rolls with a very subtle sweet n spicy  dipping sauce--yum---I ordered the small bowl of pho  but I still couldn't finish it---a guy one table over ordered a large pho and it was the size of an aircraft carrier---but then again he was a young man with a very healthy appetite...I still am amazed on how this pho outfit has reenergized what usually is a standard-operating bowl of pho---if you try their pho you will never go anywhere else...

Unfortunately, the majority of the Pho So 1 restaurants in SoCal still dominates on their taste in food than yours. Sorry. 

Here are my reason & suggestions for further improvements: 
1. Your restaurant is way too crowded. I think it's best to have one of those call for reservations. This will hopefully organize the restaurant. 

2. Disadvantage of crowded restaurant would impact the quality of the foods. Overcrowded customers can cause the crew to make the foods in a rush & food done in a rush of course would have poor quality tasting. I do recommend about having a larger crew than you currently have. ""Hire more soldiers"" to serve in your kitchen. 

I feel your foods is ok; the pho tasted like the Pho So 1 from SoCal. Though, I felt it was done in a rush, especially on crowded days. Therefore, I think if you have ""more troops"" to do the work, especially on crowded days, it would be doable. 

Overall, 3/5 stars from me. I might come back in the future. Follow those 2 suggestions above & I'll assure you that you'll improve Pho So 1 of Las Vegas. 



P.S. To the ""founder"" of Pho So 1 who's reading this: since you have successfully open 1 Pho So 1 restaurant outside of Southern California (i.e. Pho So 1 of Las Vegas), I do have further suggested locations of other additional locations you can open up Pho So 1: 
1. Reno Nevada
2. San Francisco California
3. Oakland California
4. San Jose California
5. Phoenix Arizona
6. Honolulu Hawaii
7. Hilo Hawaii",WTkUPfQtsDgP_uI-npytwg,0,0,3,HJnL5krGKjPHzKfH_TuP0A

5918582,2010-12-08,2,hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA,"Been back a few times since my last review way back in 2009.  For me this is still the best pho place in Vegas (like their broth), even though it is still not as good as a lot of pho places in OC or Cali. But it is only a 10-20 minutes drive for most living in the LV and not a 3+ hours pho pilgrimage.

Anyway, I was sick the past few days and once my appetite has finally returned, I wanted something easy to ease my tummy into, and I remembered ordering their porridge the last time I was really sick.  So I scan the menu for the porridge section, and they have a few listed, but I think only 2 without pork blood. So I was debating between the Beef Porridge or Shrimp Porridge (which in the Chinese translated portion of the menu stated that it has both beef and shrimp, but I found out that is not the case).  But the waiter was kind enough to ask the kitchen to make it a special order so my porridge order will have both beef and shrimp.  That is a plus in my book for customer service.  The porridge came out piping hot, with strips of ginger, cilantro and fried onions, and have diced up bits of shrimp and a lot of the beef (the ones used in pho).  But it wasn't what I had in mind (the Chinese version with minced beef), but the porridge itself was good and I think I would be happy with just that.

I also ordered their Beef Salad, not knowing exactly what it is, and it turned out to be a plate of veggies (the kind used in making Vietnamese Spring Rolls) with the traditional Vietnamese herbs and strips of beef.  This is definitely a healthy dish, with lots of crunchy veggies that can really tire out your jaw from chewing, but the flavor was lacking. Although I will say that it is refreshing, with all of the mint and basil leaves. Personally I will not ordered this particular appetizer again.

They also have a special Bun entree that is not in the menu, which includes pretty much all the topping in the Bun section.  My friend ordered it the last last time I was really sick, and it looked great and I am sure that it tasted great too, but the only way to get it is to specially ask the waiter for this special order request.  I will for sure order that the next time I head back and after that maybe try their hot pot.

Decor - 4/5 I like the new look. The flat screen TV anchored to the back wall plays a constant stream of local advertising, which helps remedy boredom when dining solo or when your dining companions are just not entertaining as the reruns of ads.

Food - 3/5 Overall a good bowl of pho, bun and most appetizers.

Service - 4.5/5 Being receptive to custom orders is a good thing.

Price - 3/5 I think it is par for the course.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,3,3,4,O2xL0cuCUmryfJzW1lV6rg

However, we were seated right away. Many of the waitresses don't speak English, and they had to call their one and only loyal Latino employee to help us out. That's fine though; he was cordial and nice :) Our orders came fairly quickly and we dug in right away:

Pho tai: The broth is AMAZING! So flavorful!! Much more so than the diluted sewage water we get at the other pho places in the surrounding area! Honestly, I didn't get to try the noodles or meat as my bf GOBBLED IT ALL UP!! It must've really been just that good...

Luong sam bo (something like that?): We got this instead of the red jelly drink that my friend originally ordered, and he said it was way too herbal. Probably wouldn't try this one.

Shrimp spring rolls (goi cuon): Yummm...very traditional. Tastes like the way I remember it at home :]

Pork skin spring rolls (Bi cuon): I liked this more than the shrimp, but that's just because I love pork skin. You really can't go wrong with the spring rolls; just the right portion of veggies to pork!

Red jelly drink: Don't know what the name is, but the pic is on the menu! It was okay...a bit diluted and the coconut milk was watered down...jelly was decent though.

3 Color drink: Again, very diluted even after I took out all the ice. The cup was small compared to most pho places, and honestly it wasn't very impressive. Green bean was not the mushy sweet goodness I remember it being, and the red bean had some weird flavoring to it. I definitely would not get this again; not when I've been spoiled by the good stuff everywhere else!!!

Overall, 3.5 stars, but 4 since the pho is a big YES PLEASE GET IT! Spring rolls are delicious as well...just avoid the drinks...you'd rather go to Tea Station or even Lee's Sandwiches down the street.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,3,1,4,JGRsH3TnBsHCcUm8xUTVvw

Everyone from Summerlin to Henderson has been telling me for months that Pho So 1 is the best Pho in Las Vegas. It might be the busiest Pho place in LV, but it is not close to being the best.  

The Pho was practically like boiled salt water. The broth was obviously rushed in preparations and served premature due to the overwhelming amounts of people rushing in the door.  I much prefer places like Pho Sing Sing where you can tell that they boiled the bones for over 20 hours because the broth is very oily and strong. 

The vegetables in the spring rolls tasted like the cook collected the grass after he mowed his lawn and brought it to work with him.  

The service wasn't bad, they just didn't give us any service in the first place. After they brought us our food, we never saw another server again. I hate restaurants where you have to flag down the staff to get service. This is also one of those places where the servers will pretend they don't hear you so that they don't have to do extra work. 

The restroom was horrible, even compared to horrible Chinatown standards. All I wanted to do was wash my hands and instead I had to witness a moment of horror! Two of the Spanish speaking cooks were having a conversation in the bathroom while one guy was taking a sh!t. The worst part was that the stall door was open and they were giving each other eye contact during this conversation. Let me remind you that one guy is taking a sh!t during this conversation.
