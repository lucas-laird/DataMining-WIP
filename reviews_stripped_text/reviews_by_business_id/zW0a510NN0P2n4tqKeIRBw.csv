I was in Las Vegas for vacation and was craving something consistent and cheap. Taco Bell is usually a good fix for yummy fast food. This place is off the strip and kinda dirty. What confirmed the lack of cleanliness was two insects hauling ass in this place. Not certain if they were roaches...but they looked like it. They were small, desert sand colored..and had wings (maybe?).",dLBiAtZsh41KqSpOnlXR4A,0,0,1,ASM5HVxxjMGj1WI20PHhnA

When I went to get my replacement order the Guy manager the fat one that works the night shift gave me a hard time and a few days later I returned and he gave me a dirty look and once again my order was crap. They're getting to cheap on putting the food inside my loaded grillers. And to.top it off he forgot my sauce. If your going to ask when im in the drive-thru what kind of sauce I want then give me it when i answer.

Despite what that little map says on the Yelp page, this location is actually located on the northeast corner of Flamingo Road and Decatur, not the north west corner.

I was out running errands and happened to be in the area, when I felt the urge for some wonderful chicken soft tacos. Those things are good anytime of the day or night! 

Anyways, the main point I'm trying to get across with this review is how impressed I was with the customer service at this location. Yes, I know it's fast food. Yes, I know it's Taco Bell. Yet I was greeted with a smile and an acknowledgement and treated like they were actually glad to have me here. Seriously, do they give them a commission here or what?? lol They were THAT nice. I certainly didn't expect that and it definitely left quite the impression.

Not only that, they didn't skimp out on the portions! They were actually one of the more generous TB locations I've been to in that regards.

...and believe me folks, I've been to my share of TB locations in this country!

Anyways, for the above reasons I'm giving this location 4 solid stars! When in the area and craving some TB, I will make it a point to hit this location.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,10,9,4,4viusn9U0oKsc6tTidCaEw

I asked for two of everything minus a select few off their dollar cravings menu. For some reason, the cashier just couldn't understand that order. Aside from the multitude of order screw-ups, here's my top choices if you're feeling hungry and can't decide:

8. Spicy tostada - maybe it's because I saved this until the end, but it didn't really do it for me. Flat taco shell sprinkled with some cheese and diced tomatoes. Pass

7. Triple layer nachos - there were more stale tortilla chips without sauce than with. 

6. Cheesy roll-up - exactly as it sounds, but strangely satisfying, especially with their multitude of hot sauces.

5. Shredded chicken mini quesadilla - pretty good, but the beef is better.

4. Cinnamon twists - this really should be in the top 3 because come on, what visit to Taco Bell isn't complete without these babies?

My Top 3 must-gets: 
3. Beefy Fritos burrito - this is the best bang for your buck on the entire menu. A decent sized burrito stuffed with beef, nacho cheese sauce, rice, and corn chips. Except, the corn chips got soggy pretty fast.

2. Nacho fries - isn't this why you came here? The fries are well seasoned and fried. The nacho cheese sauce has a kick and is the proverbial icing on the cake, or I guess cheese on the fry.

1. Beefy mini quesadilla - this was my favorite of the bunch. More beefy flavor than the chicken and has an all-around more satisfying bite.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,4,4,3,crQCJzdEipH0dL_MItwwag

It was late at night, our hotel wasn't letting us check in (rooms were in another person's name who hadn't arrived yet...@$)(&#) so we were on the hunt for good food that wasn't going to break the bank (like the night ahead of us would).

I knew that with some driving, we were bound to find a Taco Bell. It's familiar, consistent, and gets the hunger-job done.

We drove... and drove... until we finally spotted that glorious rasta-mehiko bell dangling in the Vegas dusk. YES. I swerved (er.. well, it was stand-still, jam-packed traffic) but still, I turn-signalled and shoved my way across FIVE lanes of bumper-to-bumper traffic to get us to this Taco Bell.

It was so worth it. They had more sauce packets than I've ever seen, and I drowned my three chicken tacos in an ocean of fire sauce.

Funny fact: my sauce packet said ""Let's go get matching tattoos."" I wonder if that's special copy for sin city, haha.

The burrito wrapped in the quesadilla is the best here. They do not skimp. Lots of cheese and the center of the burrito has plenty of nacho cheese sauce. Ate breakfast dollar menus, but not worth it. Mostly tortilla not much bacon or eggs.

The real MVP here is the booze which is added in to your lovely Baja blast freeze or any of the other freezes you may desire. You have the option of adding vodka, tequila, or whiskey in your drink. Many of my friends often for whisky but we're not as satisfied with the taste of their freeze. 

Be sure to opt for the vodka in my opinion, because it blends in nicely with whatever freeze you may desire.
