Our server, Angelina, was so incredibly friendly and patient with our questions, and make absolutely sure that all of our food was compliant with our various dietary restrictions.  She was attentive and funny, and you would be lucky to have her as your server.!  Also, the chef, Don, even came out of the kitchen to talk to us and make sure that the dish would come out exactly like we wanted it.   Awesome service by both of them!!  The food is really good as well, a great alternative to the myriad of greasy, fried, fatty, bloating options in the area.  Try the steak loin salad, it's delicious and won't make you feel like you need a nap after.  Prices are more than fair for what you get as well.  For a relaxed breakfast/lunch spot with great service and healthier options, definitely give The Grill a shot!",QjbzBaFuwgHzPCoe8MygXQ,0,0,5,tcRf46r19kssaC8Yz1OurQ

We ended up at The Grill to grab a bite for breakfast, and it was pretty average.

I'm not a huge breakfast fan, and I typically choose not to dine out for that meal as options are limited and the food is generally pretty standard- it's hard to screw up the usuals, and often even more difficult to make them stand out. That said, Cassandra's pancakes were downright bad while my simple breakfast burrito was nothing special.

Service needs to step up- even if this is down by Fremont, there's a certain standard that should be upheld. We were some of the only breakfast customers when we first arrived, yet it took unreasonably long to get our order and it was difficult to get our server's attention to communicate our issues with the food. Not worth another try with options like Eat, Rachel's Kitchen, and MTO so close by.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,4,2,1q4aqvsGHqQtueJu7vRltQ

I had to eat so fast, to be back at my meeting at 1:15. To many table and chairs in a small place.",3Vir5hwRpkkP7e744_Zimg,0,0,1,TGmyYtY2hHxGrZ5shKX7QA

I don't think the staff was adequately prepared to handle the influx of customers coming from the race because it took ages to get my food. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes, which is actually on the kids menu. But what the heck, old people enjoy chocolate chip pancakes too!      

Chocolate chip pancakes ($5): Awful. The pancakes came in a stack of three and looked good, but failed on the tasting good part. The chocolate chips were disturbingly crunchy and tasted off. Is it too much to ask for melty gooey chocolate chips? I took about 4 measly bites and couldn't stomach anymore. The waitress asked if I wanted it to-go. Um, no, because these pancakes taste like ass. 1/5 

Service: Wait times to get my order was way too long and the waitress was not the friendly type.
2/5

Worth a return visit?
Definitely add Gold Spike to your itinerary if you're Downtown bar hopping with friends, but maybe avoid eating at The Grill. 

*I thought The Grill at Gold Spike deserved it's own business page, so I added it! Now Yelpers can review this small cafe separately from the awesome late night hangout spot that is Gold Spike.*
