1) Food was way over priced for quality and portion size.
2) Food - Everyone in my party agreed we have all had better.
3) Waitstaff - Slow
4) Orders - Took FOREVER! (I'm usually happy to talk and wait for food, but it was oddly long. Friends were getting re-fills twice over before the food arrived).
5) Our server was forgetting things and was actually kind of rude.

This is a typical casino restaurant, buried in the Mirage hotel. There were only 2 burgers on the menu, one a hickory barbecue burger and the other a cheeseburger. Both were mediocre. We did enjoy the sweet potato puffs as an appetizer. They were plentiful and served with a barbecue sauce. A live band started performing part-way through our meal. The singer was more of a Marvin Gaye than BB King, and the horns were frankly pathetic. I would have preferred the canned music. 

All in all, not a successful outing. The place is very dark, and the service was slow even though it wasn't crowded. This is a lesson not to ask a Vegas concierge for restaurant suggestions. I suspect they have other incentives than the pleasure of their guests.",rBdbG7hpLalU35MJZenHeQ,0,0,2,17lWxPDIxSk2s1W8klzQtg

The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good, but difficult to compare to any other BBQ in Vegas since I've never encountered any other BBQ on the strip.  The sauce was great but the meat could've been a little more tender.  Side by side against some of the better BBQ I've had, it wouldn't hold up, but it will satisfy you if you are looking for a quick fix.

On Wednesday night, the blues started at 10pm and the first few songs that I was there for were great.  Had to pay cover, but the meal, the drinks, and the cover made for your average cost meal and entertainment on the strip.

303451,2011-05-07,1,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,"I went here with my husband last night (a Wednesday). I first want to mention that we are both vegetarians, so I won't be the best person to listen to regarding entrees. I had a restaurant.com certificate and since my husband loves blues music I thought it would be fun to go order some drinks and appetizers and listen to the live band. 

In order to even get into the restaurant, we had to pay a $5 pp cover charge. (I don't remember ever paying a cover charge to go eat at House of Blues while they had live music...have things changed?) Well, we said, we had already made a special trip to get there. We paid $10 and sat down. Our server was very nice and helpful, but after ""love"" let out the place filled up and service came to a standstill. 

We ordered the fried pickles, nachos, mac n cheese, and strawberry shortcake. The pickles were so salty I couldn't eat them (unless I wanted to head straight to the doctor for blood pressure medicine), the mac n cheese was eh, and the cake in the strawberry shortcake was soggy. The nachos were good but they didn't have BBQ sauce on them like the menu stated, and we were for some reason charged an extra dollar for cheese. Extra for cheese on nachos? Service was at a halt by the time we got our check so we didn't feel like arguing over the extra dollar... I guess I can't complain much. 

In all, I would say that if you are looking for a lounge experience to drink and listen to music- this place is great. Draft beer is $10 for the first glass and $2 for refills, a good deal if you don't have to drive home like we did. The band was pretty good too. If you are going to eat dinner, be prepared for some ""ok"" food and not being able to hear the people at your table over the live music.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,1,0,2,GnDoZFzsPkCbPUzgCyJ6Lg

First time I went to this place was January 2010.  We had just arrived in Vegas and were ready to have a couple of beers and food.  Saw BB King's on the way to our room and decided it would be our place for the evening.  

We get seated and wait about 15 minutes for a waitress to come by the table even though the place was only half full.  The live music was good so we were patient.  We got our beer order in, and waited at least another 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  Our fried pickle appetizer came out with our meal and was cold so you know that it had been sitting a while.  Oh yes and during our meal we had no drinks as we finished our meal before our 2nd beers arrived.  Food was just ok.

Fast forward to October 2011.....I stepped foot back into BB King's to give it another shot.  We were seated in an empty restaurant and preceded to wait for a waitress to stop by a table for a good 10 minutes.  Three waitresses were busy talking to the hostess up front and seemed to have no interest in working that night.  So prior to give them a chance to make my dining experience horrible for a 2nd time I was out of there.  Nope I was not going to get fooled a second time.

After eating here in August (yes August, and it is now December), I will never give them my business again. I write to you months later because this is how long the dispute has been going on for, and still no one from their company has called to settle it.

 

This past august my family stayed at the Mirage. BB Kings was the only breakfast place, so we gave it a shot. After finishing my breakfast (an egg dish) and my orange juice, my party received the check. My eyes bulged as I saw the mediocre orange juice I had just finished was SEVEN DOLLARS. Listen, I am a Los Angeles girl (born and raised), and anyone who knows me knows I am not opposed to spending money on a good meal. In this instance however, next to being sprinkled with gold, this orange juice was no where near being worth seven dollars. Before speaking to someone I checked a menu to make sure it wasn't me who had bypassed the price listed, but surprise surprise, there WERE no drink prices listed. Here's where the great customer service comes in.

 

After speaking to a manager, I was asked if my waitress had warned us that the juice was seven dollars at this establishment. Clearly my answer was no. She apologized, voiced that they were supposed to inform all customers of this cost, and that she would comp ""the entire bill."" Sounds like a good compensation, and like I always say, it's about how an establishment handles problematic occurrences that sets their bar. I had washed my hands of the whole ordeal, or so I thought.

 

Finally I received my monthly credit card bill, and here's where the dilemma began. BB Kings and their great accounting department charged me for the whole meal and then comped me for the meal. Sounds good right? It was Void. But later down in the bill another charge for the entire cost of the meal was on my statement. Despite the easy math, no one at the restaurant could comprehend the problem with these charges. If you charge someone twice and comp them once, YOU ARE STILL CHARGING THEM! After sitting on the phone with several managers at BB Kings, explaining the entire experience several times over, and being told that someone would be in touch with me within a day, I figured it had to click for SOMEone on their end. Well that was in September...so you do the math.I have yet to hear from anyone.

Unfortunately, management constantly sacks bands, brings in others, changes band personnel and generally screws up the vibe. They've had some great ones that have had the place packed and jumpin'. Too bad they keep jackin' with the formula.

As for the bar/ restaurant, 2 stars... A few of the hostesses have been good, but there's a very notable pair of them who are down-right rude. The bar staff are all efficient and friendly, as are the wait staff. The food ranges from mediocre to nearly inedible. Everything is so over-salted that you almost forget how over-priced their drinks are and flag the waitress down for another. I'm from the midwest, where we salt our fruit and anything else that doesn't move, and it's WAY too salty for me.

I had the eggs benedict ($15?) which was small and looked lost on my plate. Very sparse on the Hollandaise. Fairly inattentive service (which I see others have complained about).  Had a hard time finding someone to get us a ""box"" for the other child's bagel sandwich, which we weren't going to leave behind considering the prices.

574716,2010-09-08,0,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,"Let me preface this review by saying that this is not a place I would have normally chosen for dinner. The food and service at themed chains tends to be lacking. The reason I chose BB King is from the reviews here on Yelp, and more importantly I had a $25 GC from restaurant.com that cost me $2. So, a bargain was in the making. Our waitress was prompt and quickly asked us for our drink order, a little to fast since we just sat down 12 seconds previously and had barely began to warm out seats. We quickly glanced at the beers and I ordered a Stella Artois and my wife asked 'which of the beers on tap are dark beers?"" Our waitress did not have a clue and did not bother to check. Strike one. It was happy hour so we ordered an appetizer (1/2 price), the spinach dip to be precise. It arrived 15 min later with the salad that I ordered. The dip was spinachy enough, but mundane. The chips the dip came with were bagged,  so no excitement there. The salad was a handful of greens a pinch of cuc's and tomatoes. The dressing was served on the side in a plastic cup. Plastic is never cool in my book at a decent place. Within 30 seconds of receiving the spinach and salad, some unknown person brought us our entrees. I let this alien know that we had just received the other stuff and we were nowhere near ready for entrees. Strike 2, who wants to be rushed. About 5 minutes later someone else brought us our entrees. I guess they were in a hurry even though the place was 2/3 empty. So, we played the chess match with our dish's and received out entrees prematurely. My wife ordered the Cajun Chicken Carbonara. It was tasty enough, but the spiciness was barely detectable. It was OK, Cajun with a lower case 'c' I guess. I ordered the BBQ Chopped Pork platter. I knew I was in trouble from the start when all I could see was this tar or a substance covering a pile of meat that I was assuming was already dead. The pork was not BBQ'd at all as far as  I could tell. It had no smokiness to it and as it was so mushy I am assuming it was prepared in a pressure cooker, yuck. The tar like sauce was so think and sticky sweet, it overwhelmed the meat. This may have been a good thing and was intended.  And the sauce tasted bottled.  The two sides were cole slaw and BBQ beans, and both were served in those little plastic cups. Both tasted packaged/canned and were easily forgettable. The food was not good and for the price, a VERY poor value. Strike 3.  Will I return to BB King's? There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again. Unless the dinner was totally free. Never again.

Addendum: I origanally posted this as a 2 star rating. However, upon furthur reflection I came to the conclusion that this place just plain sucked and should be avoided even if it is the last source of food in Las Vegas.

We only had a sampling of the food.  The ribs are also very tender and the sauce had a nice tang on it. They have a few drink specials where you get a drink shot or beer in a souvenir glass.  I would shy away from the shot specials them seem to be nothing more than fruit juices to me...very , very little hint of alcohol in the one I had. 

I would have to rate the service as marginal. Be prepared to her your own drinks from the bar if they are busy.

Their idea of seasoning appears to be to dump a boatload of creole seasoning on the nuggets and throw it in the fryer. The remoulade sauce on the side and the coleslaw must have been unremarkable since I remember nothing of them. The only lousy meal we had on the trip. At least the 20 oz.

The food was good but not great. Definitely tasty, though. I was really impressed by the service; our waiter was attentive and friendly. My stoli and soda was fine: not too strong, not too weak.

Others at our table had the hickory chicken sandwich, the chicken tender appetizer, and the BBQ pulled pork platter (A giant heap of pork, no bun, with baked beans and coleslaw) Everyone loved their food. The one and only complaint was how long it took our server to check back and get us the second round of drinks.

We arrived at around 6:30 and JUST missed a line/wait. We didn't have reservations so we were seated at a high-top table. The hostess gave us a heads-up that the live music would start at 7pm. We ordered an Iced Tea and a tall draft beer. Beer was kind of expensive, but typical for a casino restaurant. 

Our server Dee was a sweetheart and gave excellent service! Quick, friendly and didn't forget anything we asked. 

We started with an order of Fried Pickles. FYI - they're pickle slices, not spears. The dipping sauce was good, and my husband really enjoyed them. I prefer fried SPEARS because you have less breading to eat, but over all, they were ok. Husband ordered the catfish dinner and I had a chicken salad. I know, so silly to order a salad at a southern BBQ style restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling fried foods, tons of bread, french fries or heavy mashed potatoes. My salad was good. Fresh mixed greens, fresh toppings. My only issue was the chicken. I could tell it was previously grilled, then let to cool, sliced and then reheated for my order. Bummer. Husband enjoyed the catfish dinner. Decent hush puppies, nice sized fish fillets, good fries. 

Overall we would say it was ok. Not amazing, not an authentic homemade southern food delicacy. We might go again if someone else chose to go here and invited us, but I wouldn't seek this place out again for dinner.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,1,0,2,ZCAmKo10TpaDSuN3oH4Dow

My husband and I didn't want to have a formal, sit-down dinner after our wedding. Instead we wanted a place where entertainment was part of the deal and where our friends would actually get up and dance. That's exactly what we got at BB KIng's. 

I am a bit of a food snob, so I was a little unsure about having southern BBQ for my wedding, but I was very wrong. We ended up having a buffet (and our guests were so happy that they didn't have to sit through a multiple course dinner) which had everything a non-traditional wedding needed: BBQ chicken, pulled pork, fried catfish, mashed potatoes, mac & cheese, and more. I was completely prepared for so-so food, and I was completely wrong. The food was great. 

And the house band there (don't remember the name) is unreal. The female singer has the most amazing voice. And the guitarist was absolutely spectacular. He was playing Purple Rain and he OWNED that song. If I didn't know better I would have thought it was the little purple man himself.

i suppose we should've worried when the restaurant called the day before to confirm our reservation, and then called the next day in the afternoon to confirm again.  then they called a half-hour before the reserved time and informed us that if 80% of the party wasn't there exactly on time, they were canceling the reservation.  then they informed the people who were there right on time that if the whole party wasn't there within the next 15 minutes, they were canceling the reservation (and then doing what? throwing everyone out?). 
in hindsight, we should've canceled after the way the night went.  the table placement was not exactly smart for a large group (why put us right in front of the giant-screen sporting event and piss off your customers who want to watch the game, not a bunch of people trying to talk?), and the poor server was the only one assigned to us AND another large party.  the food was...not horrible, but the word ""meh"" comes to mind.
the kicker though, was that their computer was not working right, and it caused a huge problem with payment, as the guy paying for the meal had his debit -- not credit! -- card ""rejected."" of course then, they found out it was their fault, but only after a lot of weird drama and having to pay in cash.  then, when card-holding guy tried to replenish at the ATM, it rejected him...he checked his bank statement on line and saw the giant bill from BB King's charged SEVEN TIMES.  yes, seven times.  
went back to resolve the issue and was initially told that it wasn't their problem because those charges were only ""authorizations"" and hadn't actually posted.  when it was explained that he couldn't get any cash, because their bogus ""authorizations"" had tied up all that money, it was suggested that he should just ""call his bank.""  
finally a real manager appeared, but it took literally another hour to sort everything out...and that was after seeing that some of the ""authorizations"" even had different total amounts.  so sketchy.  
ridiculous prices, ridiculously bad treatment, ridiculous use of their waitstaff.

We were undecided on where to eat, so we just walked from our hotel down the strip. Among the people flipping porn cards on the corners and people trying to 'sell' you free passes to clubs, there was a guy handing out cards with specials & offers at BB Kings inside the Mirage. 

We were still a good ways from the Mirage, but we ate at the BB Kings in Memphis and we were sold. We continued our trek, mouths watering, battling the crosswalks and navigating our way past the city center. Finally made it to the Mirage... by this time, we were walking in slow motion, in pain and starving... the Mirage was really like a mirage in the desert for us. 

I use Foursquare a lot on my phone. I check in to places and sometimes, there are discounts and specials just for ""checking in"". Well, sure enough, there was a 20% discount off the bill when you show the waiter your phone screen (they have to see the message). Most times, though, the server has no idea what to do with that message, so they always have to go get someone else who comes and looks and then they finally decide that it's just a matter of applying the discount to the total bill. Duh. 

We were *also* able to use the card we were given on the strip, so we got an additional $5 off our bill. Score!

The place was not crowded at all. It was midday, after all. There was no music, which was fine... midday. I ordered the ribs & mahi mahi. It came with baked beans & cole slaw. Delicious! I liked their ribs before and these were very good, also. Mahi Mahi is a favorite of mine and theirs had a wonderful char-grilled taste to it. The baked beans were nice and the cole slaw was basic.

We barely saw him and even when he was there, he really wasn't. I got the breakfast special (which by the way is not on the menu) which was eggs, toast and hashbrowns for $9.95. Okay, not great, the eggs tasted kinda fake, the toast was tasteless, hashbrowns were good. My mom got the spinach and mushroom omelette, which was the best item ordered, very good. My sister got the yogurt parfait and the fruit cup, which was just awful. All the fruit was either out of season and therefore unripe and flavorless (i.e. cantalope and honeydew melon that taste like cardboard) and worst of all, they used frozen berries, both in the fruit bowl and the parfait, which was just plain wrong. $12 for a fruit parfait that has frozen berries in it?!

Update on closing time -- it's now 10 p.m. mid-week, which is really odd for a place with live bands inside a casino (The Mirage) on the Vegas Strip.

Our party of seven got there at about 9:15 and was turned away because no table would be ready until 9:45, and then there wouldn't be time for us to order and get our meals by their apparently strict 10 p.m. time to shoo all the customers out of the restaurant.

It was surreal, standing at the hostess counter hearing the band inside jamming and knowing the place was still going to be ""open"" for another 45 minutes, but that we would not be seated because their staff didn't want to be there one minute past 10 p.m.

Because I had a $100 coupon from Restaurant.com and this was our last night in Vegas, I decided to order from the bar and take the food to go.  The bartender was cool and even tried to get us a table inside the dining room, but the manager refused him, too.

Once the food arrived, it was pretty good.  But we had to eat it at the Starbucks in the casino because that was the only place to sit down, and we couldn't eat at the bar because we had kids with us.  Only B.B. King's closed at 10, though. The California Pizza Kitchen and every shop and bar inside the Mirage was still open when we left the casino. Maybe they all do better business than BB King's. Likely they treat paying customers better.

One last note -- an 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill even though it was a take-out order.  That's way out of line when you're not getting any table service.  And I didn't notice that until we'd already left the casino. I'd given the bartender a $40 tip just for trying to get us a table.  With that 18% gratuity on top, the guy made a cool $70-plus for taking our order.  Great night for him.  Crappy night for us.  Insult to injury.",rlhVejmbyJiTj6MObxw7Fw,4,1,1,XU9s9y6h0EehCq4dTMckxQ
2269337,2012-09-09,4,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,"Mr. M & I had tickets to go see Ron White at The Mirage on 9/2 and since I snagged a coupon from one of those timeshare slickmeisters for a free app at BB King's we thought we'd have dinner here before the show.  Now, based on the reviews I didn't have high expectations, but I saw a couple of items on the menu that looked ok so what the heck.

We were also slapped with the $5 cover charge by the snotty little hostess.  I tell ya what....I know she probably deals with a lot of crap from the public, but she was NOT NICE.  I saw on her fancy computer that they also have a $15 cover charge button.  For $15 cover the Black Crowes better be on stage and there better be some good secondhand hemp smoke for me to enjoy.  Anyway....she said there would be live music.  Yeah, 40 minutes later there was a good band that came on stage.  A REALLY good band.  But seriously we got to hear 4 songs then had to go.  My theory started then that the owners of this particular BB King's Club are moneygrubbers.  It will be proven as fact later that night.

I was really glad the app was free because it was two beef tamales just like the ones you can find in the freezer at Trader Joe's.  I like the Trader Joe's grub ok, but one of the tamales had sat too long on one side or something in the steam table and it was hard and would have been better used as a shim under our wobbly table leg.  

We shared the entree and I'm glad we did because it was a huge amount of food.  The pork chop dinner was good all around.  Two moist pork chops, perfectly cooked and seasoned with fresh green beans, real mashed potatoes with the red skins still on, and those baked cinnamon apples were all the dessert we needed.  We both agreed that meal was really good, but the app was terrible.   The steak knife was completely dull.  When I first cut into a chop I thought, ""Oh no, this thing is all dried out and tough"", but it was the knife.  They need some new ones.  Terribly dull.  Thank God we didn't really need it.

Our server was really nice, but like others have said the service is painfully slow.  As I was looking around it seems like the servers have a lot of ground to cover in that joint.  It's pretty big, so maybe that adds to the slowness. 

OK.  Take an intermission now.  We went to Ron's show which was hysterical.

Then Ron invited everyone with a ticket back over to BB King's to listen to his wife sing.  Awesome.  We got our table and the server was there lickety split to take our drink order.   For $8 I got a urine sample sized plastic cup with some mediocre red wine and for $9 my husband got a plastic cup full of ice, water, & a splash of Dewars.  I felt like those overpriced drinks were an insult and therefore proved my theory that the owners of this place are moneygrubbers.  Those drinks were like someone wasn't even trying.  Awful waste of money.  The pork chop dinner is 3 stars, and the rest of the evening is a 1.  So they get two.  I will probably never go back to this joint unless the Black Crowes are there.",BA9SDRZGyRcUMxTdUTVhmw,3,1,2,-8hd6lQn5jEYiPw-JVyM5Q

I wasn't sure what to expect from BBK.  The information was conflicting...is it a meal/show package situation or a bar/restaurant with entertainment?  Add the poor Yelp reviews and I was worried.  Our visit was definitely a ""we'll check it out and leave if it's bunk"" deal.

Well, we checked it out and it wasn't bunk - on any level.  We each paid a $5 cover and found ourselves a great table (the hostess chicks *are* bunk). 

The band was fantastic! We couldn't believe that we could enjoy their show for $5. Lots of space to dance and you'll want to!  The singers and the guitarist were on fire.  Feel free to go old school and hold up your table's no-flame artificial candle at the finale.

We'd had a late lunch and weren't that hungry; we ordered some sodas and later had some gumbo (mega spicy -HOT- but delicious).  Our total bill, food and cover charge, was $15 each. Seriously.

Now, about those poor Yelp reviews:
*I can't imagine this place for breakfast. At all. I like sunlight in the morning - this is a dark, bluesy room...
*Our servers were great, but you can tell that the service here is lacking overall. They have the World's Slowest Busser. He takes ""I Don't Care"" to a whole new level.
*Closing at 10:30pm? In Vegas. Really?
*I shouldn't be able to enjoy the same event for $15 as the $55+ dinner package guests.  I think you could package a meal here for less.

BBK needs to revamp - with a band that good and decent food - the place should be packed.  It's not and that's a shame, because we had a really good time.",LU8SYDEo1gp1Cq2_2ZHiDg,0,0,4,AvC_2zDYCG54hbius8vpVw

2937601,2011-03-06,0,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,"I love BBQ, so I was VERY nervous as I sat down at BB King's Blues Club since chain restaurants rarely serve the kind of BBQ that is the focus of my dreams for weeks. 

Now, even though BB King's was not the best BBQ I've ever had (you have to go to holes in the wall restaurants that are strewn across the south to find true BBQ joy), for what it is worth, BB King, you made a valiant effort!

I have eaten the following:
Pile of Nachos with BBQ Pulled Pork
Hickory Burger
Carolina BBQ Salmon
BBQ Chicken
BBQ Ribs
Baked Beans

2 visits and I was satisfied each time. The first time the service was a little shaky but quickly improved as the night went on. Even though it was busy, our waters were rarely empty and the napkins kept on coming! The second time we went there our server was wonderful. She was very friendly and GREAT at suggesting dishes.

First Visit: The Pile of Nachos were mediocre, nothing amazing. The BBQ pork on the nachos was pretty good, and the jalepenos on the side definitely helped the matter! take this review with a grain of salt since I'm not a huge fan of cheese sauce - I like the real stuff!

The BBQ chicken/ribs: I'm sensitive about my BBQ sauce. I don't want too much on the chicken or ribs, not too sweet, not too much of a vinegar punch and with either a subtle or boot-knocking kick. BB King's sauce may have been a little sweet, but they do caramelize their meats PERFECTLY with the sauce! The ribs and chicken had a good bark on them and none of the food was greasy or too fatty. No major spice here, but the bark makes up for it. The baked beans that came on the side of this dish were a little sweet as a side dish for an already sugary dish, but they had a nice subtle smokey flavor and a great texture. 

Hickory Burger: My boyfriend at this burger, so I can't tell you exactly how it tasted, but we both have an incredible, insatiable love for burgers. Coming from Chicago (the Home of Kuma's Korner), we know our burgers, so when the man says it's one of the better burgers he has had since moving to Vegas, it has to be good! He said a lot of it had to do with the sauce and the perfectly cooked medium-rare center. I love it that Vegas still lets you cook your burgers medium-rare! He devoured this burger in record time and looked longingly at the plate after it was gone.

Carolina BBQ Salmon: I saved the best for last. There is food in this world that puts a smile on my face whenever I think about the smell, taste and afterglow. This dish sends a surge of happiness up my spine and smacks my brain around for a few minutes whenever I think about it. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overcooked, rubbery, too raw (even though I wouldn't have minded) or plain. The BBQ sauce on the fish was subtle, definitely not overpowering and once again, the bark made it scrumptious. The best part? They say that it is on a bed of creamed corn. I am sure many people thought of the scary, rubbery substance that would crawl out of the can and unnaturally jiggled in the serving bowl on the dinner table. This was a spicy cream sauce with a dash of corn made even more AMAZING by andouille sausage. If you haven't had andouille sausage, please find a local grocery store that sells it and make some jambalaya or even throw it on the grill. It is SPECTACULAR. This dish had enough calories to last me the entire week, but hey, there's a reason why I work out 6 days a week!

All together, I enjoyed BB King's. I will definitely go there again. The music during my first visit was great. They gave you a free drink voucher if you paid cover to get into the restaurant and you can go to www.restaurant.com and get a discounted $25, $50 or $100 coupon. I would go even without either of those discounts and get that salmon again tonight if my heart didn't shudder at the thought of all that buttery, spicy, savory cream sauce...Mmmm...cream sauce...",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,0,1,4,hvHKvZkqx9aI6GsQ5TqsyQ

We came about 5 minutes before a live set started, paid the cover fee $5/person, told the hostess we were there for the music, and got seated dead center in the front row. Nice.

We ordered a couple draft beers and some Sweet Potato Tots with Caramel Sauce (meh) to snack on while Jazz heated up the place. The first part of the set was magical with some great improvisations and jazz joints. The crowd was into it, but not really hitting the dance floor. About half-way through the set, a new lead singer came out and the mood/tone of the music became love songs. The dance floor did eventually fill up, but the jazz vibe was muted. I definitely loved the first part of the set more than the second.

The sandwich was suppose to be on a toasted hoggie bread and fries.  The bread was cold and dry, the catfish were those cheap-azz nuggets, slices of tomatoes and a piece of lettuce leaf. How do you put the round nuggets on the bread?  A palm size of fries. $17.99  

Chicken tasted good minus the gravy and mac and cheese.  The noodles were too thick to be used for mac and cheese.  You must have sharp cheddar cheese (orange)  in mac and cheese, not some mild white cheese.
$17.99

Collards were seasoned with bacon and that's all!  No garlic, no seasoned salt or vinegar. And it was COLD! $6.99

Don't even ask me about the drinks, what a JOKE!!!

The dessert menu didn't have any pound cake, sweet potato pie, buttermilk pie, cobbler; none of that true southern cuisine-soul food.

My husband asked the waitress were there any Black American ole' school cooks in the kitchen?.  She said, ""Yes, two"".  He then said, ""There is no way they cooked this food.  It is TERRIBLE!"" 

I know soul food.  I create soul food and I grew up on soul food and THAT is NOT soul food! YUCK!!!!!

IT IS OVERPRICED TOO!!!  $77

The food was really good. My gumbo was spicy and a decent sized portion. My partner inhaled her burger, which is a good sign. The mac and cheese was made with a white cheddar and came with extra cheese melting on top of it. But the piece de resistance was the sweet potato puff sundae. The name is a little misleading. They're not puffs at all, they're basically sweet ""potater"" tots. They're a little smaller, perfectly crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. Bring them out in a large bowl, drizzle them with hot fudge and caramel, top them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you've got a decadent dessert that is just to die for! If you get nothing else, get that!

So why only 3 stars? Our service was probably the worst service I've received at a restaurant in a long time. There were 6 of us. We were seated at a table. Then waited almost 20 minutes with no drinks, and no acknowledgement. I ended up having to go to the hostess and let her know that we'd been waiting and still didn't have our drinks. She didn't apologise, just said, ""Ok, one minute"" and went to find our server. A few minutes later, he appeared at my elbow and said, ""What do you want to drink?"" Not ""Hey guys, sorry for the delay. How is everyone? etc"" Nothing. Just ""What do you want to drink?"" We had to tell him that we were all ready to order our food too. He really didn't seem like he wanted to be there, and it showed. He went around, took our orders and then left. He brought our drinks, and at one point several of us were on empty, and about to go to the bar to get refills when he appeared to get us more. When he brought our food, he just kind of threw it down and that was it. I don't think he came back to check on us once, except to clear the plates. Had we not been in a time crunch, I would have spoken to the manager, but we were trying to hustle to get to a show. 

It's a shame, really. Had the service been on point, I would have bumped it up another star because the food was good and the live music was good. But that awful service is just impossible to ignore.",N-pWt7EPsPotH-yQEOfqKQ,1,0,3,Eb5ELVRdcCptZBlap6v6yA

King should not have his name attached to these snake oil salesmen. For one, if I'm going to pay a five dollar cover charge to see a blues band play, can they not make repeated pirate jokes during their set? (""what's a pirate's favorite letter? The C!"") I'm not sure why they shoehorned ten or more pirate related jokes into their set. I can only assume they thought they were playing at Treasure Island that night. Sadly, the lead singer was attempting to growl in a baritone, bluesy wail but it just sounded awkward and out of his range/comfort zone. Good background tunes, I guess - if you like elevator music with drums.

Additionally, who sells nine dollar PBR? My friend paid eighteen dollars for two of these notoriously cheap beers. And if you're going to charge twelve bucks for Guinness, you better make sure it tastes fresh; the stuff they had on tap was like a mixture of pine tar and dust. 

The catfish had absolutely no taste, and must have been battered with wet sand. The cheese and sausage platter looked like they opened a Slim Jim package and threw it on a plate. 

And to top it off, when the bill came we asked our waiter, politely, if he could put 30 dollars in cash toward the tab and put the rest of the 40 on our credit card. He repeated our request, nodded in agreement, and walked away. When he came back, he had pocketed the 30 dollars, citing that we told him to keep it as a ""tip"", and charged me the full 70 bucks. If you have a question, dude, ask me before you turn your hand into a piggy bank. When you're dealing with money you don't assume you have to know.

I was aware that this place had mediocre reviews, but since it was right across the street from where was I staying (Harrah's), I decided to give this place a chance.  I went here for an early breakfast and was craving Chicken and Waffles.  Boy was that a serious mistake.

When the waitress presented my order I was really turned off by the presentation and how cheap it looked (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=m0tR4ibrsuJFQ_gEwUVgAA)  As you can see from the picture, it was really sad and not as described in the menu.

But it was definitely not worth the $15.95.  You can actually pick this stuff up from the Flavors Buffet at Harrah's for a dollar less.

It didn't really help that I had a $10 coupon from restaurant.com, but at least that made the meal more cheaper than I would've paid for it.

BB King's Blues Club is here to the rescue. I needed a break from Carnegie Deli and I needed to get something fairly quick. My experience here first started off bumpy. We were told there was a 30 minute wait but we could sit and eat at the bar if we didn't want to wait. As I took my seat at the bar, I noticed an entire section of the place completely empty. I'm assuming they were short staffed. My main concern was the business we were potentially taking away from the bar since we weren't drinking. Fortunately, our bartender/waitress appeased our worries and said her main concern was to make sure we had the best experience there that night. Insert sigh of relief.

I always order the same thing when I go to any sort of Southern cuisine establishment. Fried catfish! I ordered the Southern Fried Catfish Dinner which consisted of a few of their fried catfish fillets breaded in their house cornmeal, fries, hushpuppies and coleslaw. The hushpuppies were definitely a hit. It wasn't heavily breaded and it was so soft inside. I haven't had many hushpuppies mind you but this place easily tops my list. The coleslaw was satisfactory but I liked that it wasn't completely drenched in mayonnaise. It was very light as a side should be. 

The catfish fillets were super juicy and thick. Surprisingly, the breading was so soft it just all easily fell off from the fish. It was better that way because I didn't want to walk back to work feeling all heavy and nasty. I had to fight myself from finishing the catfish because I wanted to keep some of it to snack on later. 

Overall, the meal was decent but it wasn't something I was blown away by. The portions are more than generous and can easily be shared between two small-average stomachs. Our bartender/waitress was on the go the entire time. It was like she was running the entire restaurant. Even then she took the time to chat with us with a smile on her face. There's a $5.00 cover charge when the live band was playing.

She never came back to check on us.  No refills.  Once our food finally got there...the most helpful person working there was the food runner.  We never saw our waitress again until it was time to drop off the bill.  Then we thought she got lost because we didn't see her again for quite some time before we got our card back.
As far as the food goes...the sauce is good.  But you have to ask for an extra side of BBQ sauce.  There isn't a bottle on the table.  No extra flavors...only their house sauce.  My dad liked his ribs.  My mom and I split the chicken and ribs combo.  In my opinion, the chicken was dry and the ribs were too fatty.  Cornbread was pretty good though.
There is nightly music there.  It was a good band....however, it gets really loud in there.  Unless you are going specifically to listen to the music...don't go because you won't be able to have a conversation.  Unless you plan on yelling at each other!  Also another warning for people who may not know this...if you are at a restaurant while there is live entertainment, they can charge you entertainment tax, which is usually 18%.  Definitely adds to the bill.  My mom went to the gift shop to get a magnet...that $6 magnet was also charged with the 18% entertainment tax.  
Not planning on going back...not worth the prices.  There's too plenty of other great places to eat at the Mirage, other Strip properties or local places.",NEN5RFpZp7DE6K1PK2KZzg,0,0,2,TU1ViwEO6D8mX8vQXTHW7w

Positives:
Pricing is actually pretty reasonable for the strip in Vegas - a little pricey but not shockingly expensive.
Nice variety of dishes - lots of good comfort food.

Negatives:
The restaurant is really open and has a bit of big deli feel, just a sea of tables - looks like they tried to make it really easy to clear all the tables for music and dancing.

Finally the cost, we had a $25 coupon (which is why we went in the first place) and for dinner for two and 1 drink each our bill was still $60. That's right, the original bill prior to the coupon was $85.

Decided to eat there on Sunday night after checking out their website and seeing that they sold 1. Collard Greens and 2. Fried Pickles!  From their website I was able to reserve a table through Open Table.  However I did not see where there was a cover charge for Sunday.  (Fri-Sat only).  OK  no big deal.  $5 later to get in when the band was on break.  We were seated at a table right in the front row with a clear view of the band.  Great.  I ordered the Fried Pickle appetizer and the cat fish as my entree with a side of collard greens.  The pickles were great but the sauce was too salty. The catfish came out hot and was great as well.  The collard greens were barely room temperature and dry.  I like a little juice in mine.  I won't be ordering them again.
The house band was very good!  The male lead singer/lead guitar was awesome.  I could have listened to him all night.  The female singer that came out had a great voice but no stage presence.  She looked as if she was a robot programed to sing.  Not to mention all the fidgeting.  From her dress to the ear piece. The only smile she gave was when a patron walked to the tip bucket seductively.

After receiving much deserved Bloody Mary ($10, but they have bottomless for $20), I look at the menu...

Chorizo burrito, sounds good.  Corned beef hash...i love that stuff. Biscuits n Gravy..too heavy for a plane ride home...

What's this?  Chicken and Waffles? Jackpot.

Served with hot sauce and syrup.  It was spicy and delicious.  Not enough waffle for me, but I am glad I ate it none the less.  Gladys Knight sells the Midnight Train in Atlanta, which is chicken and waffles.  Hers looks to be better, but I will take what I can get.  3 chicken tenders, a good size waffle, covered in butter, powdered sugar and syrup.  Don't forget the hot sauce. $15

Wife got the regular breakfast.  eggs, meat, hash brown, biscuit.  Good.  not worth 13 bucks, but in Vegas, you are at a resort, therefore expect resort prices.

Anyone complaining about price in Vegas is probably in the wrong place.

Since we were staying here, we walked by twice at night to hear music in the club.  Both times sounded great.  Wish we had more time to hang out.",bjaRDRmJs0cg545YHMb60g,1,1,3,psf3IZDwu9ju4f6gly0xnQ
4484592,2010-12-26,3,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,"Went here tonight because friends visiting from the East Coast wanted to go and brought a $75 restaurant.com certificate along with them.  We had to spend $150 to get the discount.  That's not too hard to do here.  They're big eaters, so we had to keep up with them.  

The four of us shared the sampler appetizer platter:  ribs, catfish, fried pickles, wings, and also a bowl of the sweet potato puffs.  Everything on the sampler platter was good, but the puffs were outstanding.  I try to never eat fried food, but couldn't resist these.

I ordered the filet mignon medium rare.  It was delivered medium well, and was dried out and awful.  I sent it back and got what my friend ordered - the bbq salmon over creamed corn, adorned with shrimp.  The shrimp were good-sized and cooked right.  The salmon would have been good, but the creamed corn - hell, they weren't kidding about the cream.  This was Heart Attack on a plate, with enough cream to clog the arteries of a tri-athlete.  That, combined with the sweetness of the corn and the gloppy barbecue sauce, AND the fat content of the andouille sausage mixed in for good measure, made this way too rich for me.  My friend loved it, though!

My husband's hanger steak, ordered medium, came well-done.  That was fine for him, since he only orders steaks medium because I force him to.  The other guy had pork chops, and he liked them.  I should have gotten them, too, because they looked like they didn't have any heavy sauce on them.  What really pissed me off, though, was that my husband didn't want the collard greens that came with his steak, and asked if he could substitute green beans.  The waiter said there'd be a $2 extra charge.  Why?  Both are listed as sides at the same charge.  This kind of niggling crap really pushes my buttons, 'cause it's unnecessary.

After pigging out on all that food, our friends wanted dessert, so we went along for the ride.  I had the banana bread pudding, and it was a very large portion.  I love bread pudding, but am usually disappointed.  Not this time - it really was good.  And I'll be eating the leftovers for the next three days.

The band - Greg Garland, I think, or something close - was really, really talented.  But I detest loud music, always have, and especially when having dinner with friends and can't have a conversation.  When I finally threw in the towel and decided that talk was out and music was in, I did enjoy it.  I think all musicians have gone deaf and can't hear the volume of what they're playing.

The service was spotty - good sometimes, and infuriatingly slow at other times. 

All in all, we had an entertaining evening.  Tomorrow we'll find a quiet cafe to take them to, so we can finally talk.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,3,2,3,auwPGqBtHECxXEavcxeRvw

Now mind you, if it were good - I wouldn't be complaining.

My husband had a yogurt parfait - that was a small cup of yogurt and a handful of granola for $10.  HUH?   Ok, people, I realize I'm in Vegas but come on - give me a little more here... don't make it SO obvious you are RIPPING me off...  it hurts when you do that!  LOL!

5241443,2010-07-19,0,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,"When BB King's first opened at Universal City, I was excited and looking forward to going.  Took one look at the menu and was totally pumped. However, as much as I loved the music, the food was a huge disappointment..  I chalked it up to being a new establishment and let it go.  

I should have continued to let it go...

BB Kings in Las Vegas was even worse than the one in Universal City (food wise).  Not only the food, but the service was terrible.  If I could give them a grade, they would get an F for the food and a D - - (minus, minus) for the service.  I'm actually shocked that some people have given this place five stars. They must be on the payroll...

I ordered the whatever Rib Eye, cooked Medium, and got it well done to the point of it being reeeeeeaaaaalllly dry.  I felt like I was chewing glued saw dust wrapped in sand paper.  The mashed potatoes were uninspired... the string beans were equally coarse - yes those string beans were coarse.  To make matters worse, the corn bread was served cold.  I don't know anyplace, anywhere, that serves cold corn bread.

So, after experiencing how dry my rib eye was I sent it back and got another one.  They kept my fork mind you and the corn bread. I guess that was punishment for me sending it back... when my plate returned with another rib eye - it had NO flavor... I dunno what cooking talent that is that makes a naturally flavorful rib eye, un-flavorable, but hey, that's saying something for the cook...   the initial bite into my rather cool (not hot) rib eye was cooked medium but the more I dived into it, the more well done (and dry) it was.  Please keep in mind we are not talking about a thick rib eye - the one they serve was about 1/2 inch.  It doesn't take that long to cook a rib eye that thin, so uh, er, hmmm, how did that get messed up... Geez...

I'm sure the waitress was initially ready to help our party of 12, but she soon gave up being even remotely visible.  Short of coming back  to drop off the bills (separate checks) in one pile at the edge of the table, I, nor did our group see her again.  By the way, that, in and of itself is completely rude... fortunately for her, the tips were already calculated in the bill.  She would have gotten a plugged nickel for that one...

I realize she's not the cook, but ensuring your table guests have what they need DOES make difference.  The fact that I had to wait for the manager to bring me a fork, another dinner guest request the plate of corn bread be warmed, got no refills on water, nor did I see anyone to ask, and practically had to walk to the bar myself and order another drink, all make my experience, combined with my other dinner guests, meal more of an unnecessary nuisance.  Consequently, I cannot, and would not recommend this place for anything.  When Yelp allows you leave a zero star, I'd give them that.

The only reason I gave it one star was because the band was good.  Now if they could get their food to match, BB King's would be on to something...",pAN0LQoIrlqnw9mYOj_fCQ,1,0,1,kB5xREjNzQwfBwGrFW3Cwg

However, once the band came on, they played FOUR songs and called it a night. They were very talented, but are you really charging me extra for 4 songs? Ridiculous.

No server paid us attention after we were seated. We were not given waters or told who our server was. We hunted someone down, ordered, and waited more for our food. The food was just okay, and at that point, we were already ready to go.

Upon walking in the door, it looked as though I would find a bingo ball being spun by someone at a head table; it was filled with the 50+ crowd, if I'm not being clear enough. Now granted, this doesn't exclude my intrest in a place by any means, but, uh.. for breakfast at 11a on a Saturday morning, in Las Vegas, it wasn't boding well.

Anyhow, basic breakfast fare with a southern flare: our 4 top had 2 breakfast platters, a chicken fried steak platter and for myself, Cajun pork chops.

The drinks were huge, the service was average. The gravy on the steak was not good, nor were the biscuits. My chops, on the other hand, were really, really good. In a greasy spoon sort of way, not a high class Vegas eatery way, so don't get a food porn woodie.

Not much more to say on the topic.. It garnered a solid MEH as an average based off our table. If it was just based on my chops, it would have been higher, but still..

We had the fried pickles, which were great but a little greasy as you'd expect. The chili was fantastic, and I'd highly recommend it. I had the pulled pork sandwich and the pork was tender and had a good flavor without being too salty, the sauce was perfect with not too much sweetness like you'll sometimes get. The fries were good but not too memorable. 

Prices were a little higher than you'd expect but then again it's the Vegas strip so that's the case for just about everything.  Overall a good place to have a southern/BBQ meal that may not be quite Beale Street but pretty good anyway.",j7Ew20Kh33lFEaUXW1rGNw,2,1,4,0y_qNVx-BHZJSn-frizxVw

Not only were they super-tender they were super-flavorful! I really didn't expect to enjoy them as much as I did and leave clean bones on my plate.  My husband got the pasta dish and really loved it.  The band playing on Sunday night was very talented.

Now for the problems: Although we loved the band the volume was so loud my husband and I could not talk at all.  We had to shout our order to our waiter about three times and honestly we just gave up and pointed at the menu what we wanted.  The iced tea was obviously old and tasted terrible but again it was so loud we couldn't send it back.  The side dishes (mine was the mashed potatoes and coleslaw) were very tasty but absolutely tiny portions.

Bottom line...if you can definitely go and try the ribs but perhaps go in the afternoon when the band isn't playing.  I will definitely get the ribs again but will not order the iced tea.",dX_uPyIVH8yNS2XMocjzzw,0,0,3,UxnpMc4G_uWnbn-HiL7lCQ

Today I decided to give it a try and came here for breakfast instead of the buffet for a change of pace.

Price cost as much as the buffet so I was feeling a bit uneasy paying the same price for me meal when I can pay about the same or less as the buffet and have more variety. I ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast $13 and it was excellent but small. :( 

Our server Janel was very freindly and always checked on our table to see how we're doing and she did not disappoint. Her positive attitude helped us feel comfortable even though the price was too high and food portions were not generous. 

The layout of the restaurant resembles a blues and jazz theme with southern hospitality. They have posters of famous blues singers on the walls and the lighting is pretty dim and has a bar in the right near the entrance and another bar opposite of the dining area.

5454295,2012-09-05,2,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,"Place made me very sad.  I used to visit Vegas a lot before I moved here, I dunno think I counted once and was here 35 times before , and I'm from Miami so it's not a hop skip and a jump.  I used to stay at the Mirage for a yearly convention and every time I did I looked forward to 2 things 1) pickles from the Carnegie Deli and 2) the GRITS from BB Kings.   I did not look forward to their $4.00 cup of coffee, especially when Starbucks was right around the corner, and the Mirage doesn't have coffee makers in the rooms. So $4.00 for a plan old cup of coffee is very steep.

Over this past weekend, I had girlfriends in from out of town staying at the Mirage. I could not talk enough about how amazing this place's GRITS were, grits, grits, grits that's all they heard. So Sunday we finally went to get me my grits.

As soon as we sat down, I noticed the menu was difft. My stomach growled and sank at the same time, surely they could not have done away with my GRITS. But sadly twas true, the GRITS were no longer :( and I was very very sad.

Now whatever they were going to serve me to eat was not going to make it up to me. Grits are Grits and I was looking forward to these Grits for days. They give you a biscuit instead of toast with your breakfast.  Mmy veggie friend said the biscuit was AMAZEBALLS and I didn't have the heart to tell her they probably made it with Lard that's why. Let her eat it in all it's glory and she was happy. I however upgraded to the whole wheat toast for $1.50 with my $4.00 coffee and opted for an egg white omelet.  My omelet was swimming in grease. Like there was visible oil on the plate from when it came out of the pan, made me sad again b/c the point of egg while omelet is to be healthy.  They didn't have any healthy options that I could spy on the menu other than the egg white omelet.

I will say they have 2 HUGE TV's for watching football. Like move theater screen size; however, they didn't have the sound on, so it's a catch 22. You can look but you can't hear!

So after everything was said and done my meal was $20 with tip $25. The day before we went next store and ate at Cravings with all you can eat and all you can drink drink mimosas [and GRITS] for $30.00.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,5,1,2,rMg8mkeSnjJE22EtQpc4cw

Our party of 12 got a table right by the stage and found out the band was going to start in 20 minutes.  Doesn't make it easy to talk about work does it?  Oh well..let's order some drinks!  Our marketing contact there, Rodney, was awesome. He just brought out massive plate samplers, entrees and more drinks!

Sliced fried pickles were extremely addictive.  I actually had to pass the basket down the table to stop.  The ribs were really awesome.  Some of the best in Vegas..still not saying much but I really liked em!!  The pulled pork was also great.  Not a producive work dinner at all but everyone definitely enjoyed it!!

After trying a few other things here, I strongly recommend anything that's from the pig.  SWINE FTW!!!!!  Can't wait to get the ribs again.  Forget the wings, chorizo or even breakfast for that matter...that's what Carnegie Deli is for if you're staying at Mirage.

I really wish I could have spent some more time at this place. I absolutely love the hip bluesy, laid back, loungy atmosphere and could imagine it must be a fun place to kick back on an evening before hitting the rest of the town.

Sunday morning and limited to the selection of breakfast choices to go to and not craving to go back to the not so delectable Cravings buffet option we chose before, this seemed to be our last, but decent resort.

I was seated promptly and given my much needed coffee immediately. I ordered an omelet with Swiss cheese, bell peppers, onions and sausage.

It arrived within a timely manner appearing fluffy and deliciously appealing. I then noticed it was ham instead of sausage in the omelet( I don't like to be too picky but I really don't like ham) so I told the waitress, she apologized politely and had another one remade.

Come to find out it was sausage just a different kind and the chef actually came out (no, not to strangle me) but to show me a display of different sausages how they are and what I would like to use. She was extremely professional and extremely polite.

She gladly remade it and brought it out to me. The omelet was seriously a fluffy, flavorful goodness. Savory flavor in each delectable bite and cooked to perfection. Yeah I know, that rave over an omelet, I just have to give praise to those who can make simple things outstanding.

I'm from the south, and the thought of having some good southern-cooked food sounded great for our Valentine's Day lunch.  I ordered the catfish dinner.  The catfish was good, but the hushpuppies were less than stellar, the fries were cold, and the slaw was ""OK"".

My date ordered the grilled Mahi-mahi.  The fish was tough (not flaky as it should have been).  The sauce was good, but not enough of it.  The rice was great.  The green beans were a big disappointment.  As I said, I'm from the south.  We like our green beans COOKED, with a touch of bacon and maybe some onion.  These green beans were, as our waitress told us, cooked ""al dente"" - way too crunchy - almost raw.

The beer taps were not working, so no draft beer - only bottled.

To top it off, the mood in the place made me feel like I was at a funeral.  The hostess was gruff.  The other customers looked mad/sad.  Our waitress was nice enough, but the service was incredibly slow.  There were a lot of people working there, and not that many customers - so I couldn't quite understand the lack of attention.

I was really hoping that I would like this place.  I love southern cooking, and there's nothing better on a Friday or Saturday night than a rocking blues bar.  But this is not the place for that.  I'll just have to wait until I'm back down south - or perhaps head over to the MGM and eat at Emeril's.

Music: 4/5 Stars
If you like music and blues, you should definitely check it out because the group was pretty entertaining and I really enjoyed the music. I came here twice and they played their own songs as well as hits from the past, which was really entertaining.  

Food: 4/5 Stars
1) The roasted chicken was cooked thoroughly and surprisingly juicy. It was lightly coated with a delicious BBQ sauce that didn't overwhelm the roasted chicken. 
2) The Ribs weren't the best ribs I've had, but they're up there in my ranking of southern ribs.  Again, some of their own sweet and savory BBQ sauce was coated on the ribs as well.
3) Cajun carbonara - cajun ziti pasta with chicken. The sauce was a bit thick, but it wasn't too oily, which i liked.  I REALLY enjoyed the garlic bread that was served with the pasta. It was a thick piece of bread, but it was soo soft that it felt like I was holding a cloud. I'm gonna have to order another side of that. 

Service: 5/5 Stars
Our server was awesome. She was really friendly, helped us pick out good items and they were actually good. Manager was around to check on our needs, which was really cool.
