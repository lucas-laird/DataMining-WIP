That is always a good sign.  We were a little taken aback by the prices.  25.99 for bulgogi!  We both ordered the bulgogi and an order of fried dumplings for 9.99.  They cooked the meat right at the table.  The lady was very polite and answered all our questions.  We have been to Korea and this place had some of the best kimchi we have tasted in Las Vegas.  The bulgogi and dumplings were pretty good, too.  The portions were huge!  It was enough to feed 4 people.

First impressions:
-Huge dining area, can seat a ton of people at once...We arrived at the same time that a busload of Korean tourists showed up. We thought we'd have to wait to be seated but totally didn't!
-Very expensive menu...at first look. HOWEVER, it includes a Korean bar that has tons of veggies, soup, sushi, and kimchee...so it made it worth it.
-The quality of the meat was actually very good, despite it being all-you-can-eat. I've been to these kinds of places and you usually sacrifice quality for the amount you get. But not here. Every bite was delicious.

The only thing that bothered me was that it was so busy that we had to wait over 5 minutes for water after we started eating and the food was very salty so it kinda made it hard to eat. I had to go to the kitchen and ask for water. But they were super nice about it and were more attentive after that.

I LOVED this place and would most definitely return for more yummy goodness.",Eq_hCb5GSbt8vOfjl_BKXw,1,0,4,ckh2FEr86k9T_KVmnYd4kw

I'm sure all korean restaurants use MSG but it was nothing but MSG.
The mool naengmyung tasted like 7 UP. I had to put so much vinegar and mustard to make some kind of flavor out of it but was still horrible.
The bibim naengmyun was not any better.

I would give the seafood pachun 3 stars though. The soysauce was pretty good.

I love closing out a night of drinking with late-night Korean and this is why I dragged my tired fiance out for the walk to find this place on Las Vegas Blvd on a recent Saturday night.   I've never met a late-night Korean joint that disappointed until now.  First, the place looked totally deserted from the outside (empty cans and a few plastic shopping bags rolling around the empty front parking lot in lieu of tumbleweeds) and we couldn't even tell if the place was open or not.  We walked inside and it pretty much was deserted - just one other table of people.  The place didn't just seem quiet, but felt curiously empty, as if  it doesn't ever get much action.  The menu looked pricey so we just  decided to split the kimchi jigae and pork fried rice, knowing we could fill up on some of the little side dishes Korean places always provide.  It took forever for the little dishes to come out, to the point where I wondered if maybe this place just didn't serve side dishes.   About half of the wait staff seemed to leave for the night while we were waiting and the kitchen seemed curiously quiet, like a ghost was making our food.  When the side dishes did arrive, they seemed less than fresh.  The pork fried rice is a joke (ok, maybe fried rice is not the first thing one should order at a Korean restaurant, but my man is a fan and honestly, how hard is it to mess up fried rice?) - zero flavor,  fatty pieces of tasteless pork and sketchy looking shriveled up peas.  The kimchi jigae was better but not good enough to redeem the meal.  I also thought it was weird that one of the waitresses stood around gabbing on a personal call on her cellphone pretty much the entire time we were eating.   I'm really surprised that a 24-hour Korean restaurant on the strip serves food this underwhelming and I'll be really surprised if this place is still in business the next time I'm back in Vegas.",s62DpbjtNMATCtRr4xpfzA,1,0,1,D9EdX1gjBKl1XxPZpB-XJQ

707422,2016-04-22,0,uQavb7YPhMo89AjwZcjb0w,"Just had a late night dinner. Was a little concerned because of the reviews. The first sign that it should be good was the fact that it had a lot of Korean patrons already. 
We decided on the $29 all you can eat for my husband and I, and our son chose the manduguk. We selected the top 4 meats. Went to the banchan bar and liked the selection. On the menu, the ""and salad"" was removed. So we both got a little iceberg lettuce with dressing from the bar. We were surprised when they delivered the Korean salad. It was very good. The server wasn't talkative, but helped place items in the grill. The first meat- the very thin pieces used to dip in the sesame oil with salt, was very good. Then we tried the Bulgogi. It was ok. Then the pork and sirloin cubes. My husband had the pork- said it was ok. The sirloin wasn't marinated, so we had to dip in the sesame oil mix. Was ok. My son really liked the manduguk- had several pieces of shredded beef in it. 
So overall, for a Korean buffet, it was good. We have been to some really good ones in San Jose, CA. But the food was good and the service was good. 
It appeared there were some regulars there eating because they kept calling the staff over and talking with them- even offering food and drink (4 men who were really enjoying the soju). There was also a big gathering of people.
We were expecting the bill to have the gratuity already, based on the other reviews. But it was not. Didn't ask. So don't know if it recently changed or not.

I guess if you're not Korean this place might be eatable, but I came here after a long weekend in Vegas with 10 of my Korean friends and we were so disgusted, we even took a picture with the restaurant to remind us for future reference: do not come here.

Service is awesome. The waitresses were very attentive and friendly, so if it was based on service alone--Id give this place 5 stars. But I just can't bring myself to give this place anything but 1 star (and that's only because Yelp forces this upon me).

The food, amazingly gross.  Everything was too bland or the taste was too ""off."" I'm used to some authentic Korean food (living in LA) and I couldn't believe the owner actually lets the customer eat food that tastes like... that.  We even had to send in couple of our orders back because it was just so bad.  I barely touched my food but the tea and pineapples were good.  This place charges a lot for their food.  A dish I can get in LA for $4 cost about $13 here, but it's understandable because it's in Vegas and they can charge that much.  I suppose people who aren't familiar with Korean food can find this place appealing (according to the all the stars I'm seeing.... very surprised, might I add) but if you're Korean and you just want some Korean dish after a weekend of alcohol and American food, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT come here.

The sign up front said buffet $16.99 but once inside we realized this price is not available during holiday weekends (we were in LV for the new year) so the price was 22.99 each. Well, we stuck around. 

The setup is kinda cool. The grill is built into the table, they bring you meat of your choice and you cook it. our waitress stopped by 3 times to turn over our meat but had I not cared it over, it would have burnt. 
Drinks are not included with buffet so we ordered cokes. We were brought two coke cans with glasses filled with ice for a mere $2.50 each!  = ( No refills...

We struggled to cook and eat at the same time and once we were finally done the waitress brought our bill.

I must say the food was good. or maybe we were just very hungry since we had been at the grand canyon all day and breakfast at our hotel sucked!

I would have rated this higher but I was really turned off by the fact that in our bill which should have been $49 plus tax included a $9 tip?!  I am under the assumption restaurants charge gratuity on parties of 6 or more (me and wife) so this was kind of a surprise.

Do not get us wrong we do tip but we do not like to be told what to tip especially when we are not 100% satisfied. 

I brought this to the attention of the cash register lady and she apologized, said sorry and removed the tip charge.

The signed said that cost for buffet is $16.95 except holidays, but when we came in, it was $22. The day was December 27, so there was no holiday. When I asked why the price is different, lady at the front desk said it was a holiday week. When I spoke with more senior waitress/manager and communicated to her that is was a false advertisement she just asked me to leave the place. I was going to leave, but my family wanted to stay. So we stayed and the end, when we got the check, the check included 18% tips included in our statement even though it was only three of us. The food was good, but service was terrible.

I would have to guesstimate that my experience that I'm about to mention is approximately 3 years old, but from the looks of even recent posts; looks like things haven't changed much.

We went with a medium sized group (roughly 8 people) for lunch.  The majority of us ordered soups/stews.  I believe that there might have been one that ordered a meat plate.  I ordered the kim~chi soup.  Perhaps this is just me, but you can tell a LOT about an establishment from their kim~chi soup.  The verdict, rather bland.

That's not the kicker.  Perhaps they've changed their rules now, but we ordered multiple bowls of rice to supplement our larger than usual appetites and were charged for each bowl  No where were we warned/advised that these additional bowls of rice would come at a cost.  How unprofessional/unethical and downright disreputable.  Who does that?!?  For those not understanding the culture correlation, I would equate this to being charged for requesting additional packets of ketchup to go with your order of french fries.  I would be willing to sympathize with the extra charge had the rice been a special blend, or perhaps a healthier organic version.  But no; we are talking about straight up plain, sticky, white rice.

At any rate, any dining establishment who charges for additional ""packages of ketchup"" without even being forewarned deserves a less than one star rating from me.  Too bad yelp doesn't allow for this.  I'll stick to eating at buffets thanks.",eBqVqBP2ab6YLnhfg4Qgcw,3,0,1,jJzWdjdQJc17gtV7wNXn0Q

I've eaten here perhaps 5 times over the years, and have always had good meat and good food.

OK - I will add that one guy, who has been our server before on previous visits as well, was just as good as he always has been.  But this other wench.... I feel like going back just to have it out with her!  Rude as can be - and serious attitude adjustment needed.  I am not normally one to be condescending or rude to the waitstaff in any place but once every so often, a person comes along who just makes me want to.... want to.... UGH.  Given the fact that I am Korean myself - - when I  run into one of these people at a Korean establishment, the hatred is intensified.  Considering the fact that many patrons who frequent Kimchi are NOT Korean, one would hope that the owners would take more care to ensure that their waitstaff is up to par with any other good Vegas establishment.

Anyhow - aside from this woman, Kimchi is a pretty decent Korean restaurant, open all night long, I think, and that can't be beat.  Just keep in mind - - if you go at 4 AM like I did on a Sunday morning, ask for the guy server and tell that woman that Grace said to keep her at least 10 feet away from your table at all times - and 20 feet away from the food.

Banchan is decent and plentiful.... meat is good. The ""Al-Jjigae"" and ""Yook Gae Jang"" was also quite good.

However we did not get to find out at all. After calling to make sure that they were really open we went. We walk in to see to 2 tables full while the rest of the place was empty. The waitress walks  over to say we cannot eat there because they are expecting a reservation of 300 in an hour & everyone was busy. We asked about to go & that was a NO too. She said they have this reservation every Tuesday; same time. Well if you do shouldn't you tell your customers when they call or put some sign up saying closed for  a private party?!? Anyway while we were being kicked out some people from the other 2 tables said don't waste time here because the food and the service were not very good.

The service is absolutely wonderful. They had great suggestions and helped my still groggy self get things cooked properly. My buddy joining me for the morning was a complete novice to Korean anything and ended up a total fan as well. Don't worry about all you can eat. The regular orders have better choices and are plenty of food. When the waitress heard that my friend had never tried Korean food before and was enjoying the galbi and tastes of my spicy bulgogi, she offered a plate of regular bulgogi for us to split as well on the house. Reminded me of how warm and friendly Korea really can be.

They have bottles of Hite which is perfect for the food. I can't bring myself to buy $14 soju after what it costs in Korea.

Perhaps it's another case of right place, right time. All I know is that I was more than happy with this kind of breakfast.",m2a1WvdBx9tCohxvhPaTyQ,1,0,5,VGW4iQstONrsyMUMD7fsNg

Spent about $30 a person and a little disappointed because it was a total of 3 people eating the AYCE KBBQ and we only ordered a plate of meat each. We wanted to order more to make it worth our money but we were stuffed. We ordered bulgogi, pork belly, and beef brisket. 

There are side dishes at the bar where you get items yourself. Nothing stood out, just your regular Kim chi, daikon Kim chi, bean sprouts, etc.

Service slacked a bit but they check up on you occasionally so that's something. What I didn't like was that they charged us automatic gratuity as you would with a table of 6. First of all, it's a table of 3 - you shouldn't do that. I'm a waitress so I know and that really irked the hell out of me. But when we tipped, it was almost the same - off about a dollar. YOU. JUST. DONT. DO. THAT. Unless the table is actually a table of 6 or more.

2260607,2010-05-04,0,uQavb7YPhMo89AjwZcjb0w,"It was past 1 AM and we had a friend in town who was really hungry so the almighty yelp came to the rescue. We opted to come here and made the trek from our part of town. Started the meal with Hite beer & hot barley tea [served in a plastic water cup, which I found odd?]. Our friend was stoked on the galbi, so on his recommendation we got an order and he got the bulgogi. I ordered the Soon tofu soup, or the spicy seafood and tofu soup. It came out boiling like mad, which was a nice touch. We opted to cook at our table, so the waitress brought the grill to our table & lit it up. She brought the banchan on a cart fairly quickly- candied anchovies, braised sweet potatoes, kimchi, sprout salad, pickled zucchini/squash, lettuce with a vinegarette & pepper flakes, and fish cakes plus a bowl of rice. She threw the meat on the grill and left us to dig in. We did have a few minor issues- it took her several trips to the table for us to get a straw and another glass. Once cooking, the meats made up for the service issues. The bulgogi was tender, coated with marinade and well-marbled. The galbi was really good- the fat marbling every piece beautifully. When putting it on the grill she unrolled a long thin slice and cut it with scissors, stripping the meat off the bone. Our friend said it was better than the meat he gets on the east coast though the prices were also a lot higher. My soon tofu was tasty, but the large bowl came with 3 tiny little clams and the mussels were absolutely tiny. We waited a long time for our bill, too. A woman and a couple came in while we were eating, and the woman was in and out long before we got our bill- and there was 3 of us downing 2 orders of meat- portions that were generous for 1 but didn't last long at all with 3 hungry people. This being my first time having korean BBQ, I don't have anything to compare to this experience but the waitress generally seemed unenthusiastic about serving us and after reading the other reviews it seems that we could have had a much better time. We definitely didn't get any mandoo or noodles and she seemed like she really didn't want to come by our table much at all. It was pretty late, but even so there really wasn't that much going on. The bar area of the restaurant was being remodeled, but it's understandable that they have to do it whenever they can since the place is open 24 hours. Also, there's a giant football outfront, so I'm guessing they're billing themselves as a sports bar/restaurant. 
Overall- the food was tasty, but I wouldn't know if there's better, so I can't jump up and down over it. Our friend liked it, but didn't like the price. For 3 people with 2 orders of meat and 1 order of soup & 1 beer we paid over $80. I'm definitely looking to try some new places before I go back here again to get a better idea of what to expect, but it's worth trying and our friend thought it was tasty. It just might be a better idea to go during daylight hours.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,2,1,3,SK_ra1kTq7Ph27KrwHzPLQ

Open 24 hours!! And if you go for the lunch special it's like $19.

They offer 5 different kinds of meat which is a smaller variety than most but my hubby and I only order like 3 different kinds anyway so I really enjoyed my lunch. The bulgogi was marinated well. The chicken was incredibly soft and tender. And the samgyupsal was in big, thick pieces. Also, they cook the meat for you at your table, which was new for me. Service was good. 

The side dishes were lacking in variety but the ones they offered were good. I recommend trying the marinated potatoes and sweet corn. The cubed radish wasn't very flavorful. I don't recommend that one but the other kimchi they had were good. 

I don't know if it was just me, but after cooking up 3 orders, I think a little bit of oil was splashing me from under the table so ask them to change the grill after a couple orders and just to be safe, ladies should sit on the sides or wear something that covers your legs!

The food? BOMB!  I lived in Korea for a year or so and they have a very authentic taste here... that is, except for (of course) the Sam Gyup Sal, which is what I always order if the restaurant has it.  Which NEVER happens in my hometown.
Anyway, its still good eats, just not seasoned the same...

Now, the reason for the 3 stars? The ""all-you-can-eat"" for 22.00 bucks, while some might consider expensive, is fairly priced for a city that has no problem charging me 12 dollars for a mojito.  However, its kind of scam-like...
First off, everyone at the table has to order all you can eat.  So If you and your 90 pound cousin go in there, sorry kiddo, youre gaining weight today!

Secondly, The waitresses only bring out one persons meat at a time... so if you go with four people, all order different meats, a couple different things can happen:
        A. Yours comes first (hooray! right?... WRONG)  All your friends are gonna eat your meat (so to speak), since what they ordered didnt come out yet, and the waitress will serve it to them too!!
       B. Yours comes out last, and youre already full from playing Vulture Boy on all your buddies food.

Lastly,  there's a one hour time limit on the all you can eat... we sat at a table with six people one time, and the last person didnt even get there order!!  Wow.

So, in closing, great food, weird rules, take it for what it is.  Korean food is best served drunk, Cheers!

We frequent this Korean bbq joint because of the convenience, cheap prices and that they never close.  This place isn't the cleanest or newest restaurant out there, lets put it that way.  The staff is very routine and they attend to your dinning needs quite abruptly.  Simple menus that sum up the lists of dead meat to choose from.  The tables have their own grills from which you may cook up a plethora of meats to your own personal liking.

We go nuts with the cheapster menu.  Pork belly, brisket, beef tri tip, marinated pork, bulgogi, marinated chicken, beef tongue and intestine are offered on this tier.  We always have them pre cook the intestine in the back kitchen before we twice cook it on the table grill so they get real nice and intestine-y & crunchy.  Also the pork belly is super yummy when dosed in the miso/fish sauce.  Everything is served with white rice, a fresh lettuce salad and some salted sesame oil and sweet dipping sauce.

No real complaints regarding the meats or portions.  You can get fat off of this stuff.  I kinda did.  Nice frozen thin cuts.  They don't mind bringin 'em out either.  There is a small self serve kimchi & korean side dish buffet in the center.  If I were to complain about any of that, I wouldn't be a person who understands the difference between an actual restaurant and a buffet soo.  Yeah, not the finest stuff out there but all of the pickled stuff is pretty decent.  Some people really like the potato salad in my party.

I've driven by this place countless times with my wife, and today as we were searching for a place to eat, decided to try this spot out. What caught my attention is that it is open 24/7. Now, I'm from L.A and i live in Korea town which is known for Korean AYCE bbq joints. These places close at midnite at the most so seeing a 24/7 Korean bbq joint was surprising. As you walk in, you're asked to see the menu. Reason for that is...there basic all you can eat price per person is $29.99. And there premium (for premium meats) is around $46 or so per person. Now that can be steep for some so they rather not take the time to seat you for you to then want to leave. So you see the menu first and then you get seated.

I chose the $29.99 selection. Overall, the meats where delicious with great flavor. Our server was friendly. They have a salad/sides bar which you are allowed to eat from. I wasn't too big on the sides though. The whole experience was great. The only thing i did not care for is that when the bill came, they automatically add gratuity. 18% too!

Don't go around sunset, cause the sun shines straight into the restaurant, they don't have decent shades, and do not turn up the AC so it is hot like an armpit inside around sunset.  Some wierd things:

1.  Its serve yourself banchan.  Some of the items were really tasty, but the kimchee at Kimchi is really mediocre.  We ordered kimchee chigae and the kimchee they used was like old, and mushy, and the broth very little flavor.

I guess the self serve concept is okay, and I think its so you will fill up before the meat comes out.  Just don't spill on the way back to the table.

2.  Kalbi was REALLY fatty, and way too sweet.  The pork belly was fine, no ""pork"" smell and otherwise unremarkable.

3.  Service was wierd, the waiter kept turning our fire down, while the waitress kept turning it higher.

4.  They have a menu which has some rolls, like California, but then they have the rolls at the banchan buffet, so don't order separately.

Overall, a very mediocre experience.  I'm not trying to compare with L.A., its just the food was just not up to par, period.  If I only ever experienced Korean BBQ in Vegas, this would not be my go to place.

That's great, but I preferred it before, when you ordered off the menu and the servers brought a huge assortment of banchan to your table along with a terrific green leaf salad doused in absolutely refreshing ginger  dressing. The salad still comes, thankfully, but even if you order off the menu, you no longer get the extensive variety of banchan as before. Instead you have to serve yourself banchan cafeteria style: it feels too informal and less special. I guess the new set up can be good if you want to pig out on a few items, but I miss the variety so I'm not too pleased.  Plus, business has picked up quite a bit, so now you may have to wait to be seated (the tourist buses seem to have added this spot to their list).

Having gotten my rant out of the way let me just say: I love this place! The marinated galbi is so frickin' tasty, as good as any I've had in LA's Koreatown, which is saying something. I also love their pork belly. If you want either of those you are going to order off the menu, so there!

The buffet is a great deal actually, so if you don't want to order off the menu you're likely going to enjoy your meal if you are an aficionado of Korean food.

No, I didnt forget. The service was so poor here I didnt leave one! How ballzy to follow me to the door! 

As a server it is in your job description to do simple tasks such as ask what we would like to drink, take our order and delivery the food to the table. These are minimal service job tasks the customer expects amongst others to make it a pleasurable dining experience. This is what you signed up for and you are getting a wage to do your job. If, however, you want a tip from me why dont you...
1. ask if we would like at least a second cup of hot tea  
2. ask how our meal is
3. ask if there is anything else
4. bring a full glass of cold water instead of a half filled glass, when asked (you couldnt stand and wait a little longer to fill the glass?)
5. say something, anything when you leave the check on the table. 

All these things are also in your job description that I shouldnt have to tip you for.  The only time I saw you was when you took our drink and food order, bring our drink and food to the table and leave our check.  For that, you expect a tip? 

As a local I have been to this restaurant several times for lunch and dinner each time I thought the service was lousy and never warranted me leaving more than a 10% tip. I go back because my elderly Korean mom and I go out for lunch together and she enjoys their buffet of side dishes. My mother was so surprised that a Korean woman, without any self respect and shame would boldly ask for something that she did not deserve. Where are your manners? (My mother is very traditional.)

 That display of flapping the guest check holder would certaintly not fly amongst your Korean tourists.  Were my amerasian features mistaken as some Caucasian tourist that you'll never see again? Yes, I am half Korean.

I am a generous tipper and the amount is based on the service I receive and type of restaurant.  Servers need to stop with the attitude that we are expected to tip. In my book you have to earn it.  

I explained to the server at the front door on the way out why I didnt leave a tip. She never humbled herself and wondered why she didnt get a tip and be concerned if she did something wrong and apologize. She hastily said ok, ok.

The place was ok, kind of dark from the outside but once inside it's similar to other korean bbq places. The prices were a bit high for Korean bbq, we got tofu soup for $13 and Bulgogi for $27. I thought it better be some good kbbq since we can get AYCE in Koreantown in LA for $16.99. The tofu soup was probably the most bland I have ever tasted. They either did'nt know what they were doing or forgot to add any type of flavor in it. I could cook better at home with a pot of boiling water and some tofu. Huge disappointment. Then comes the meat. It was just ok. Nothing to rave about.

It's a Korean BBQ place, but to be honest, their BBQ is probably the worst thing on their menu.  My recommendations:

1)  Haemul Jongol (spicy seafood stew) - very very good.  But I'd steer away from this if you're not Korean.
2)  Nakchi Bokum (spicy squid dish) - very good.
3)  Undegu Chorim (Monk Fish stew) - Awesome
4)  Sam Gyup Sal BBQ (meat) - this was good actually, the cuts of meat were tender and thicker than normal.  But stay away from the Gal Bi - the meat was good, but man they totally over-marinated it.  The grill got all burned up with all the sugar and sauce from the meat.
5)  Neng Myun (cold noodles) - average, but still good when you're in Vegas heat

The service:
From a Korean perspective, it was pretty bad.  They didn't give you any free dishes no matter how much meat you ordered (bad etiquette), and they rolled their eyes when we asked to change our grill (dude).

This restaurant is located on the Vegas Strip in a small strip mall. It's very unassuming and as we walked in we were greeted in Korean (well I assume it was a friendly greeting as everyone smiled and we were seated). There are grills at the table and a buffet type bar for the kimchi and other sides that go with your meal.

 We ordered galbi (ribs) and bulgolgi (beef). Both were quite tasty. They were well seasoned and there was plenty of food to go around. They both had their own unique flavors, so I appreciated that as well.  So much so that I ate enough for the rest of the day and it was only 1pm.  

We all enjoyed ourselves and then a cold noodle soup came out that was amazing. It contained noodles, and egg among other ingredients. It has a very nice citrus flavor that was perfect for the warm day. I totally wish I could remember the name of it. Needless to say, I went from stuffed to meal skipping full.

Don't be fooled and think you only have to order the all you can eat bbq option because we didn't. We ordered off the lunch menu and with the complimentary banchan, we left stuffed.

First off, the banchan (side dishes) typically served with your meal is serve yourself and ranges from all types of kimchi, potatoes, veggies, and even anchovies- all very typical but very well done.

I got the dduk gook (rice cake soup) and what really impressed me was that I usually have to get the mandoo dduk gook (dumpling and rice cake soup) but I ask for it without the mandoo (dumplings) and they usually try to charge me more! Fear not, they have both options and the soup stock was rich and oh so perfect with the perfectly folded in egg and chewy rice cakes.

I actually liked the name of the restaurant. I heard about this place from one of my sales rep's (at Vegas for a convention). Anyways, he was paying for dinner, so I thought I'd try it out.

I just went there tonight on the way to the airport so I was in a rush. We had about forty five minutes, so we had to hurry. We had ordered the dwaen-jang-jigae (soy bean paste soup), bul-go-gi (korean bbq beef) and a stone bimbim-bap (basically a korean version of fried rice but with vegetables and a fried egg on top). The soup was pretty tasty actually not your typical version, they added some go-chu jang (red bean paste) instead.  The bul-go-gi was  your typical run of the mill bul-go-gi (though the next tables kalbi short ribs looked and smelled tantalizingly good).  The bimbimbap was also pretty run of the mill and had I not had the extra bulgogi I would have been pretty disappointed. But it was a perfect addition to the bimbimbap.  The banchan (small korean side dishes that usually come with korean meals) were very tasty. We had about 9 small dishes (bean sprouts, kimchi, radish kimchi, spicy potato, fish cakes, spinach/sesame seed leaves, water kimchi, dried anchovies and one more that I just can't seem to remember).  

Service was actually pretty good and quick even though the restaurant was pretty full. We were out of there with time to spare.

CON:  Price. The price WAS pretty high for what we ordered. It normally would only run about $25-30, but as a fellow small biz owner I understand what they're going through (huge space on the strip). The bill came out to around $55 not including tip. But it's to be expected in Vegas. Isn't everything expensive?

My point we order two meals, we visit twice per month and my wife eats half what others eat and to tell his waitress that is dumb and rude. He needs to treat his regulars better.

The food on the other hand was quite good. Not better than the places in or around LA but still good. 

It is definitely more expensive than LA but it's Vegas so that can be expected. Personally, I'd rather eat here than Ginseng which is just down the strip.

First off, let me mention that there is an all you can eat KBBQ here and while I did not choose this route I will provide some evident opinions from my fellow party-doers. Their beef is pretty fresh and might they recommend the beef tongue (sounds gross but it's so good anywhere, take my word for it). We came in like I said at the crack of dawn so it was not busy at all (we were actually only one of two). What I liked about this place is that the place where you grill all the meat was buttered up so the grill did not get all grungy and charred up, I don't think the waitress had to change the grill at all. Overall, the meat isn't something that is out of this world, but most of my friends said that it was decent.

Secondly, let us move onto my meal. I am a soup connoisseur and so, quite naturally, I bought this noodle soup and I honestly wish I could remember the name but I literally just got done with clubbing and all I know that I was putting into my stomach was a warm bowl of delicious spicy soup! I am sure you can find it if you muster up enough creativity from my review.

The only thing I wanted to mention is that out of the four of us, three had the AYCE and I went the normal entree route and the waitress exclaimed ""NO SHARING OKAY?"" Which kind of irked me because I am not the type to find loopholes when I eat. So I am going to dock a point off just for that... Harsh? I think not -- my ego is damaged. She proceeds to ask me to help out my friends because they could not finish it all... my have the tables turned?

Overall, you should definitely try Kimchi, it could truly satisfy that insatiable hunger of yours at any time of the day. Just watch out, get AYCE or you can't share!",WjtVF2CsxKCN4nqjyL9zKA,1,0,3,tISbenL-QkSUviF-UXrdtg

You have two choices: $22 for about 10 meat choices, or $36 for about 16 meat choices. We didn't really know what any of those extra 6 were, so we went with the cheaper option. From those choices, you can order as many as you want, and they bring out plates of raw meat (along with a salad with a vinaigrette that was decent). The servers walk around and help you grill your meat, cutting it up, flipping things, and also putting more on any empty grill space. This bothered us since we were getting full fast, but we learned it's to keep the grill from getting blackened and getting char on the next meat you cook.

The meat all looked fresh and tasted great. There was a ton (and you get charged for excessive leftovers) so we left very full.

My main reasons for not a glowing review were:
Our server was never there when we needed her, most of the time we ended up asking someone else who was passing by for things. And it was not busy, maybe two other tables were there.
The buffet of basic sushi rolls and raw and marinated vegetables was really limited. There was one soup with large chunks of potatoes and carrots that was delicious but the selection was really small compared to other buffets.

One thing we really liked was even though when you order a soda, they bring you a can and a glass of ice, it's included in the AYCE price (as many as you can drink).",C153mp-HHFvf5G9LetRaTg,6,1,3,0hFHk5fbHjxIjrE8XQdEMg

I love this Korean BBQ. I'd eat there once a week (minimum) if we could afford it. Little spendy.* It's a nice restaurant -- a great place to take a date for a romantic evening, but also comfortable enough that you could just walk in after a big morning at Home Depot in jeans and a T and no one would bat an eye.

The food and service was excellent. I can just feel those beautiful ribbons of beef, sweetly marinated, melting in my mouth. And if you're a vegetarian, fear not -- the side spread they bring out is more than enough to fill your belly if you're dining with carnivorous friends. 

We went with our very good friend from Japan, Mr.Matsui. He proclaims himself a ""master chef,"" and he went bananas while the young lady tried to help prepare our meats. ""No, no, no! Thank you!"" he stopped her, then sent her away with a demand of, ""More garlic! More garlic, please!"" It was quite amusing, and luckily, the girl just laughed about it. Wouldn't have been quite so funny if he'd made her feel bad.

I digress. The food's excellent, the service fantastic. I highly recommend this BBQ. It's a little costly (for me), but at Kimchi, you are definitely getting what you pay for.

You pick up your own side dishes at the side dish bar (although I wished there were more options). And any other side dishes you'd have to ask.

Although the cucumber kimchi (Oi sobaegi) wasn't there.. I had asked one lady.. and she said ""we're sorry we don't have any."" I shit you not. 5 minutes later she comes out with a big plate of it. I guess they either... just made it or they were secretly hiding it from me.

The side dishes and entree was either bland or too sweet. I guess being on the strip they must have decided to make the food sweet to appeal to non-Koreans (especially Japanese). That was the only logical conclusion I can think of because Korean food should not be sweet.
The kimchee hot stone pot rice came out warm with kimchee juice still on the bottom. So, I told them to take it back. It came back 10 min. Later. Still not right and warm-it should be sizzling. My soy bean (den Jang chee gae) was too sweet as well as bland. So, I called the manager but the waitress never called one for me. So, I complained to her that it was one of the worst Korean food I've had in a long time.  I am visiting from los angeles, which has one of the best Korean restaurants outside of Korea. So, I think I know what I am talking about.
It's so sad because I was here for super bowl Sunday. It was not bad. They must have change the cooking concept since to attract the non-Koreans. If I was alone, I would have cancelled the order and walked out.

Trust me, stay away unless you like your food bland and sweet.

There are better Korean restaurant. I think Ginsang on the south side on the strip is better. The Korean restaurant on the strip pass the Stratosphere is better.

I came across this place because my friends and i had just left XS en route to the peppermill for breakfast foods and in the corner of my eye i saw the bright sign that said 24hr AYCE BBQ. Needless to say.... we flipped a U and pulled into the parking lot for some grub.

I am probably not the best judge for this place because both times i visited i was under the influences of alcoholic beverages. However i can say with confidence that the meal was alright. For 4am AYCE KBBQ it definately hit the spot. 

On both visits i pretty much order the same typical meat selection. I have to say that i did like the dressing on the salad that they served us however the steam eggs were hit or miss. The first time i went the eggs were perfect and fluffy and the second time they were overcooked to say the least. 

This is not the best KBBQ i have ever had and to be honest it doesnt come close to the best, but so midnight post party eating i say its pretty good. 

The 2 things that turned me off are as follows:

A friend and i had asked to split the tab with two credit cards and the host split the charges but used my card twice. So basically my card was changed the entire meal. Not a big deal because my friend just gave me cash but it was kind of annoying.

 We asked the host to call us a cab which turned out to be like a friend/family member/owner of the place. The driver tried to overcharge us for the ride back to our hotel and when we objected he gave us a more reasonable price. Who did he think we were?? Vegas Newbs???

When I first entered the restaurant, I had good feeling about the place since 90% of the customers were Korean and Japanese.

I ordered bunch of BBQ item- Bulgogi (marinaded sliced beef), Ross Gui (sliced beef without marinade), and Hya Mit Gui (sliced beef tongue) for the table.
All the meat tasted tender and fresh.  I really liked Hya Mit Qui.  It was very tender and flavorful.  The sesame oil accompanied the dish was very good quality.
All the BBQ dishes came with Man Doo (meat dumplings) and Naengmyeon (cold noodles).  I didn't like neither of these dishes.  The noodles tasted soggy without texture and Man Doo was not flavorful.   

My vegetarian friend ordered Jab Chae (fried clear been thread noodle with vegetables) and Bibimba (vegetables and a fried egg on the rice) without meat.  She really enjoyed both of the dishes.

I was happy to see they had OB beer which goes very well with Korean BBQ.

Everything is super tasty and the staff is great at guiding you through what dishes people typically order. 
A good beginners menu, for two people, would be one meat order (bulgogi). And one soup order (tofu, with seafood and beef). Add more as you go if needed.
There's also an ""all you can eat"" option. But I've never done that.
They'll even help cook your food on your grill if you're completely lost.
There's also a large ""sides"" bar, which I believe is complimentary. So many great choices that you might start to get full before your meat is cooked. The spicy cucumber slices are my favorite.
And of course, the Kimchi. Delicious. Smooth and crunchy with just the right amount of sour.
