Chicken quesadilla was DISGUSTING.  Tortilla was browned to a cardboard like consistency, the filling was hardly there, and the guacamole was brown.  My table mates also suffered the same fate -- there wasn't a single item that was enjoyable.

As for service - it was just as bad as the food.  I get that it's 2am, but there are plenty of other 24 hour cafes in Vegas that will take care of you and actually treat you like a customer.  Caesars has lost my business for a long, long time.",FFTX63pqjbhbBhdw-ZTXow,0,0,1,KisdqsUulqTveCizFNoQSA

Of course, it was pricey, but I look for quantity and density in my meals at this time of day.  They actually had a decent list of stuff, but I opted for the chicken wings.

Went here for lunch with a large group of friends over the weekend.  We were seated fairly quickly but had a bit of a wait for drink orders to be taken (not super long, just a few minutes).

Among the dishes ordered were the massive grilled cheese with 3 types of cheese and an extra piece of bread in the middle (SO GOOD!), the reuben (both guys liked it), the meatloaf, spaghetti and taco salad.  Everyone seemed well pleased with their meals but the fries I sampled were only good for about 2 minutes after they were brought out.  Either they had been reheated or Augustus needs to rethink the fries they are serving.  As soon as they started to cool even a little they were absolutely horrible.

I will probably never order that grilled cheese sandwich again as there's never a good reason to eat that much cheese, but it was really fantastic and if you love your dairy you should really give it a try.",X15oJw2RZWPPpT-gG9jOtg,0,0,3,ffiIud6rF8ag7Jse9lwJsg

Finally upon another frantic hunger wave down, a robot approached us and took our order.. (Mind you, it was not that busy, and there were waitstaff around doing random stuff and ignoring us)

Food's ok.. typical diner American food..
Everyone's food came out all scattered, i was done with my food when another companions food just arrived.. r-i-d-i-c-o-l-o-u-s!

Then the worst arrived.. after asking many time when and where the ""F"" was our steak and eggs.. NOTE: By this time EVERYONE WAS DONE WITH THEIR FOOD.
The robot said, squeakily, ""it's almost done"" (for the 5th time)
tick tick tick tick...
We asked to have it boxed to go since everyone's done and it was late AND THE ROBOT SAID ""IT was almost DONE"".. the robot lied =(

Another million yrs passed and it still wasn't done, we ask for it to be canceled so we can leave this horrid munchkin robot infested cafe but the robot gave us a hard time.. she then decided to take off our drinks instead but still charged us for the steak meal.. uhhhh WTF?

So if you are leaving Caesars Palace or just coming back to the casino and don't want to go exploring to find a place to eat, this may seem like an okay place to stop.

In terms of the menu, the lunch and dinner menu feature a lot of comfort food items like pork chops and chicken pot pie.  I've never been here for breakfast.  I had the crab cakes, which weren't that good.  The pork chops looked better than they tasted.

I'm not the biggest fan of Las Vegas food.  At the very least, Augustus Cafe does offer a slightly cheaper sit-down alternative to the other overpriced Vegas restaurants.

My goodness! For $58, you would expect a decent meal. (April, 2011) I ordered the chicken sandwich with potato salad and my husband had the Cuban with black beans. Nothing fancy, nothing hard to cook, just good solid food after a day of walking the strip.

Honestly, this was absolutely the WORST chicken sandwich I've ever had. It was dry, overcooked and had alfalfa (not sprouts) on it, which was bitter and revolting. (I never start taking apart sandwiches to pick things off of them but I couldn't tolerate this and took the green stems off.) I love chicken sandwiches but this thing just did not fit the bill. It also had avocado on it - which I love, but they'd failed to add even a touch of salt to them so they were tasteless. And, I should probably mention there wasn't a spec of any kind of sauce on the sandwich - no mayo, no mustard , no salad dressing, no honey mustard, nothing! Which added to the overcooked dry meat effect. It was awful. The potato salad was made with real mayo (nice touch) but was greasy and had a weird texture. Made me wonder how long it'd been unrefrigerated. Didn't finish it either.

My husband was non-plussed with his sandwich too. He simply said that ""we can make better at home"". And he didn't eat much of his beans which looked gross - of course black beans aren't the most appetizing bean on earth served all soupy in a white cup. Oh well.

We could have had a better, more satisfying meal if we'd gone to McDonalds...
That being said, the service was fine, although being what Caesar's Palace is, we felt a touch underclass dining here.

Two other groups got their food before us and we came in five and ten minutes before them. Once again we ordered three salads, not much cooking involved there, not rocket science.

the morning after some vegas funsies, me and the ladies wanted some breakfast sustenance so we chanced the line and got in quickly, the only good thing about our experience, if that.

We get seated and wait for 15 minutes. No one stops by to take our order. And the lady who was supposed to be our waitress went ahead to serve folks who came in after us (older and in a bigger group). Ageism for a bigger tip? Maybe.

They ask someone from a different section to serve us and I ask for Cold granola with milk that's specifically on the menu. She gives me yogurt and musli (something else). At this point we've waited around half an hour for our food. The servings are huge, but the food wasn't anything spectacular.

We finish our food and wait about 20 minutes for the bill which never comes. My friend asks for the manager, complains and our entire meal gets comped, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one.

Was it a bad day? Maybe it was just us? No, I talked to another friend about it and she had a similar experience, except it was later at night, when service should be easier because it's less crowded.

Go to the buffet or forum shops for food and don't bother with this place.",DrDcxgabnswIJOA6xoE99Q,0,0,2,iHEAGZdtTf9pIhP2BpLfmQ

They are open 24 hours and their menu is pretty extensive for such a little place. We never waited in line and the hostesses were friendly. The wait staff was a little spotty and the same person never came back to our table until it was time to bring us the check. It was hard to know how to tip for that, but we were so full by the time we left that we hardly cared at that point. 

We ate at Augustus once for breakfast and once for lunch. I can honestly say that both times it was wonderful. For breakfast, I had a Belgian waffle (complete with Caesar's Palace stamped in the middle!) and hash browns. Typical morning after drinking fare. The waffle was fluffy and the hash browns were just salty and greasy enough to hit the spot. 

For lunch, I had a chicken Caesar salad and was not disappointed. The bright star of this meal was the side of fries I got. Delish!

We ordered normally, Appetizer for the table.  Either two appetizers or an entree per person for main eating.  We could have easily ordered 2/3 less food and still had left overs.

Best Free Bread Bowl-Pretzel bun, cheesy bun, zucchini bread.  All warm and delicious.  
Whopper Milk Shake-To die for.  Balanced candy + milk shake perfection.  Comes in oversized glass for maximum calories.
Onion Rings-Mountain of Beer battered, pipping hot, perfectly salted, oniony goodness.  Came with great dipping aolis.
French Onion Soup-big enough to swim in.  Not overly salty, good onion flavor, high quality cheese and crouton on top.
Crab Cakes-Liked the avocado citrus salad with the cake.  Went together great.  A bit to dense though.  Could have done with one not two cakes.
Clam Chowder- A little bit off.  Definitely too sweet.
Prime Rib- Came with so much fat it needed lipo.  But other than that, this half a cow looked fantastic.

The wait for a table was pretty long, about 15 minutes. They said it was because it was so early and their staff was low. 

Once seated though, service was good. I had the pancakes with eggs, home fries and sausage and the BF had a NY steak and eggs. Pretty good and their portions were HUGE. I didn't finish mine.

First off, you shouldn't expect to eat in any casino restaurant (and I'm not talking about a place you could call a joint/diner/cafe) without overpaying for what you get.  Augustus in Caesar's is no exception and you're looking at $15 burgers, $11 quesidillas, $9 cups of soup, and $20+ if you want an actual entree.  

Hell, you dont even get a free basket of bread if you order anything that can be construed as a lunch item (appetizers, salads, soups, sandwiches, burgers).  That is, unless your waitress is sweet enough to bring you one on the sly.  We understood why it was such a big deal only after we devoured our zucchini bread muffins and egg&bacon breakfast rolls.  Nothing could have been more soothing for our hangovers than the essence of breakfast captured by our single bread basket.

The problem with ol' Augustus is that I have never had a great time with him.  He's comfortable, that much is true, because I know him well.  They serve pretty much your standard American fare with a few random outliers (most of which are Italian).

Augustus is really no fun.  Be willing to wait in line here.  I had the Caesars VIP pass that let me cut in front of all the sad folks who have been standing in line for a good 45 minutes.  I truly did feel bad for these people but, hey, Augustus and I go way back.

The service here is fair at best.  It gets insanely busy in the restaurant.  I'm not looking to constantly hold hands with the server but throw me a bone here.  At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.

The only redeeming factor is that Augustus is there for you when you need him and he's surprisingly dapper in the morning.  I will say that the one thing that Augustus does well is breakfast.  If you can beat the breakfast rush, they have some pretty high-quality items going on.
