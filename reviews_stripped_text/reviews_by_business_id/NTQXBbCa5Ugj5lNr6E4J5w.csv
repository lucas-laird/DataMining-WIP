The first time I went, I ordered the #5 (Rueben on Pretzel Bread) and it was about $10. I loved it so much that I went back a couple days later for another one! This time I ordered waffle fries too since I was really hungry. I also ordered two sides of thousand island this time because one wasn't enough last time. I like to dip my sandwiches in sauce when I have it, so I use a lot of it. The waffle fries weren't anything special, so I probably wouldn't get them again.

Backstage Deli is located in the back of the casino, next to the Cris Angel theatre. After you order, you're given a buzzer that does off when your order is ready. At that time, you toss the buzzer in a basket at the end of the counter and grab your food. Both times, the man that handed me my food was very nice. They have a decent size sitting area with tables and the restaurant is completely open. (overlooking casino)

I don't think the price is that high for being in a casino and the quality is very good, so I think the sandwich is worth $10. I noticed that they have another Rueben on the menu that is bigger I think. I don't think it comes on pretzel bread though because it wasn't listed, like it is on the #5. If you love pretzel bread like me, make sure you order the right one!

A great thing about this place is it is open 24 hours and all menu items are served 24 hours. So whether it is early morning, dinner time, or 3 AM after a long night of drinking, you can come here and order a burger, sandwich, breakfast, salads, hotdogs and more.

The #11 Pollo Panini is a good option. It comes with grilled chicken breast, mozzarella, roasted peppers, tomato and chipotle mayo on a decent roll. The chipotle mayo has a nice little kick to it. 

We also got the #3 Triple Decker (turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo). This thing is HUGE! They do not skimp on the portions. You know how when you walk into a fast food joint and see the plump juicy burger pictured on the wall with crisp lettuce and thick tomato slices but then when you get it, it looks like a flimsy thin piece of cardboard? That is not the case here. The sandwich is just how it looks. Huge!

They also have a lot of small dessert options that aren't shown on the menu. Cookies, brownies, strawberry shortcake, cheesecake, chocolate mousse. We got the Chocolate Mousse and the Fruit Custard and were pleased with both!

I got the Turkey Burger this time around. Same awesome taste and quality. 

Both burgers were somewhat plain, nothing fancy, but great. The grease was minimal, focusing more on other aspects of the burger. Very clean meal and didn't feel sick or stuffed afterwards.

We chose Backstage because it was within our hotel, we could order food to bring back to our room, and the prices weren't sky-high, like the room service menu items.

They seem to have a lot of very good people working at this restaurant. It was busy that night (it seemed like quite a few runners were taking their post-workout meal there), but the kitchen staff was working quickly, and the girl working the register was super friendly.

I wasn't feeling super hungry, but knew that I needed to at least eat something, so I ordered a fruit plate and a butter croissant. My husband went with the California Burger and an order of fries. We got our number and headed over to a table to wait. Again, the tables that were occupied seemed to be occupied with people who were doing the same thing - everybody looked ready to bolt the second their food came up.

I grabbed a bunch of condiment packets, napkins and plastic utensils before settling down at a table. There were about four people in front of us, so we knew we had a bit of a wait for my husband's burger (my fruit plate and croissant were handed to me when we paid).

I was impressed by the size of the fruit plate. I saw it on the menu, then saw a fruit cup in their refrigerated display case, and was afraid that I was going to end up with that. Instead, I got a huge platter full of red and green grapes, pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe and watermelon slices, as well as two (TWO!) strawberries. The fruit was fresh and good, and I was surprised by the fact that I couldn't finish it all. The croissant was flaky and buttery, and I had no problem polishing that off.

My husband liked his burger, once he had it assembled. It was a big dang burger, and they didn't seem to skimp on the order of fries, either. They smelled really delicious, but I didn't try any.

Overall, it was nice to have a non-sit-down option within the hotel that didn't cost more than our entire Vegas stay. 

Plus, they get extra points for helpful staff. There was an incident with a runner at the condiment station, and they helped us handle it quickly and safely. I sure hope that guy is okay.",-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,1,0,4,QFAn9MhRXMOSEgubu0hGYQ

The prices are about $10 less than the other sit down restaurants for a full breakfast. I liked it so much I came back for lunch.

YES, of course! *face palm* Our order came to a grand total of $12.65.

Our meal was up relatively quick, I waited a couple minutes. A heard our order number called, came up to see this sweet lady, ""you must be the lucky number"" she said. I laughed, ""Yup, that's me"", I said with a smile. I told her thank you & much appreciated. This time I noticed I had a smaller pickle but it was whole, instead of half! Nice surprise.

I probably should have gotten a burger or something. 

For what it's worth, my gf loved her tuna sandwich.

Whoever created the menu to this place is obviously a New Yorker, because they know delis here.

It's not quite Katz's level brilliance, but I was not expecting a deli sandwich in Las Vegas to be this amazing. 

I do wish the soda fountain had a little more diversity (instead of four flavors of water that all tasted like cough syrup, a seltzer button would have been nice), and the sandwich served on ""pretzel bread"" was a little small, but the overwhelmingly delicious head-sized club sandwiches forgive a lot of sins.",TWgQp3oD6m5hkaRfL7_ePw,0,1,4,mWdu1vyr1zYeuRMA4JHPJA

So I did the drunk zombie shuffle over to luxor and find a McDonald's.  There are about 70 other drunk idiots there in front of me so I continued my quest. I ended up downstairs and hapened upon this place.

But after over 12 years of visiting the same Mandalay properties, for pretty much the same conferences, you get to know your reliable, flavor-filled, consistent favorites, and Backstage is one of them.

Simple menu, but each item is high quality and the little details makes it into your go-to book, like house-made salsas that actually taste flavorful and not from a food service merchant. (lots of this city is sourced from the same suppliers)

Back in the corner or Luxor, to the side of the magic theatre, you're away from the smokers, and out of earshot of the many nightclub venues towards the front. Wifi is strong here, and the staff courteous and quick, and very personable.

I prefer this stop over the Luxor's coffee shop (the other 24x7 choice here), which by comparison is pretty generic. Opposite corner from the ubiquitous Starbucks. Top of the escalator (main floor level), if you're coming in from self park.

Always been able to refill my coffee as the day wears on, and they can customize pretty much everything to your dietary needs. Like some of the local places that are way off Strip, Broadway is kinda like stopping home in an otherwise boisterous city.

The place was busy at 10 pm, likely because we were the after-the-show crowd. I decided to reserve a booth by putting my sweater on one of the benches. We then went to place our orders.

There were a couple of times during my trip where I either did not take photos of my food, or did and they came out blurry. The latter happened here. I ordered a Reuben sandwich with potato salad as a side. I also got a drink.

Both my pics of the sandwich and salad were blurry. I blame the dark lighting in the eatery and my phone. Luckily, I was able to post my potato salad photo, as I could salvage it by sharpening it up. My Reuben photo was a lost cause. It was a blob of dark fuzziness. Instead, I will describe how yummy it was.

My Reuben sandwich consisted of corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese, on toasted rye bread with a yummy sauce. You can make it a combo by adding a side and a small drink, so I got potato salad and a fountain drink.

My Reuben sandwich was perfect. Normally, the sauerkraut makes the bread soggy. However, the rye was toasted perfectly that I didn't get any sogginess and the bread didn't take off the roof of my mouth. The corned beef was tender and flavourful. It was a great sandwich that hit the spot.

I loved the potato salad. It was chunky and yummy. I liked that I could avoid getting fries.

Not only are the sandwiches about $10 but we definitely were disappointed by the quality of the food. I got some special they had going that came with the chicken salad pita sandwich and fries. It was about $12....the chicken salad was more of mayo salad with some chicken in it. The only good thing were the fries but come on fries are kind of hard to mess up!
My friend got a chicken sandwich and she was disappointed with how bland it was. Nothing was used to season it...she had to use lots of condiments to make the thing edible.
Oh and they ordered one soda since a small drink at the place is $3.99!!! Yes, really!! This place is just a rip off...definitely not worth for what they are charging.
If you want to find a good sandwich...go to Planet Hollywood's food court that's in that shopping center and stop at the Earl of Sandwich. Now that's a great sandwich place!",v4C8VqqXhwvP0KuhWkCL6Q,1,1,1,CXApMQp2mrU54CoW6pXhCA

My friend and I shared a Patty Melt and Oriental Chicken Salad for around $20 total.  The Patty Melt was super hot and pretty good, it just lacked some salt and pepper.  On the other hand, the salad was a letdown.  The chicken was flavorless and dry, plus the prepackaged dressing did not taste good at all.",o0emAbW2Z9MnyGxBUzH2ZA,0,0,2,xZIf2n0oScFdk8RiUlrjHA

5737686,2013-07-02,0,NTQXBbCa5Ugj5lNr6E4J5w,"this place was seriously right outside of our elevator so we walked passed it 10 times a day. for me, the best thing about this place is the convenience (close to our room in Luxor and also opened ALL the time) 

price was reasonable considering it Vegas and inside the hotel/casino. 

Food was typical... but I like the variaty of choices.

I've had the potatoe pancakes (REALLY good like a soft hashbrown), Sweet potatoe fries (really good and cheap too), chicken noodle soup (to recover... you know) but their soup menu is writen on a board that's not on the menu, and then I had the chicken salad sandwich which was kinda dry but it was okay. My friend had a chicken salad and it was HUGE!!! plenty of avocadoes and other goodies in the salad and so big that the entire table couldn't finish it. 

Pretty fast service deli/diner... no waiter so you gotta get your own food and then put the tray away afterwards. 

Definitely recommend this place if your staying at Luxor... but if not... it's not worth the trip... they're opened REALLYY late so maybe you'll want to try it if eveything else is closed. Oh Cris Angel is right next to this so maybe if you decide to come watch that and then stop by here for a late snack.

i got the sweet potatoes, onion rings and the Grilled Vegetable Panini.

prices are similar to other deli places in vegas.  the sandwich is about 9 bucks or so.  

the sweet potatoes and onion rings were super good.  but the vegetable panini was just ""ok"".... i'm definitely more of a carnivore, so i don't know what i was thinking when i ordered the veggy panini... i blame my drunk self...  T_T 

very convenient because its located at the bottom of elevator 2.

Coming from NYC, home of some of the best sanwich shops in the country this place takes the cake for vegas hands down. This is one great deli, they serve a monster amount of meat on there sandwiches. Order a triple decker B on whole Wheat. Also one can refill there cup a unlimited amount of times at the foutain soda machine. Total bargain in a town that usually tries to take you for all your worth, especially considering how the taxis in this city seem to cost 10-24 bucks per ride even when you go less than a mile or two. 

This place is located in the luxor, like gentleman, my brother and I were staying next door at The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay and would stop here for a late nite bite before walking back over to Mandalay. In fact we happened to show up here on our last night and encounter a bevy of animals that just wandered in from a night out. We ended up taking two animals from Canada back to our room only after sitting with them for 20 minnutes. Slayed them like puff the magic dragon as they did the walk of shame back to the luxor as my brother and I threw lunch meet at the door after they walked out of our room.


Side note... The luxor is a dump, but it is where all the hot twenty something easy girls stay. Knowing what I know now, Id stay here over a more upscale hotel that has nothing but fat old midwestern hicks, whose trip highlight is walking by a real world cast member in the buffett line.",jx1BSmGVycPVwUjWXgg_XA,2,0,5,BTNHQjErBphyklYzG3XGGw

Pretty much, Luxor doesn't have a 24 hour cafe. What hotel DOESN'T have a 24 hour cafe? That is ridiculous. But let me save that for another rant. 

Given that there wasn't a cafe open, it DID help us drunks who were the casino at 2am. They do have a good menu, everything from cheeseburgers to breakfast. But it kills me that I paid $10 for a mediocre cheeseburger. Yeah. I'll never get over it. If the cafe was open, it would've come with fries. They didn't even get our requests right.

I had the Bagel sandwich with Eggs and Cheese. Jesse had the Veggie panini. Big portions and they hit the spot. The only problem was they didn't put enough seasoning on our dishes. A little dash of salt & pepper will be nice.
