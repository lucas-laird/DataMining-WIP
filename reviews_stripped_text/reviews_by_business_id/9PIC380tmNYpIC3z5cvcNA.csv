Service here was great very nice and welcoming. They do have a sign letting you know that if you order Honeytoast it will take 15 minutes which was fine with me and they make sure it is perfect for you. The Thai tea here is LEGIT!

Awesome experience.

Food: I ordered the Red Velvet Crepe Cake, was very simple taste but I realized whenever you put the strawberry syrup on top and mix with the ice cream you get the whole flavor which was not so super sweet which I loved. 
Drink: I ordered a hot Caramel Macchiato which was awesome taste right on the spot of sweetness, my buddy ordered a Taro Latte which was delicious.
Customer Service: The girls, unfortunately didn't get the names, were very friendly and helpful since it was my first time going.
Really loved the place super cozy to spend time with some friend or by yourself doing homework.

134165,2016-07-22,0,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"We ordered the Mille Crepe cakes(Red velvet and Green tea) and I can't help but compare it to the very popular and elite Mille Crepe cakes of Lady M in LA. This one is a little bit better than Lady M in some ways. The sweetness is just right, Lady M tastes a little bland. Also, the crepe is softer in consistency so it's easily sliced and has more melts-in-your-mouth texture when you bite. The service is quick and the cashier was respectful and friendly. The food presentation is excellent. Two things  why I'm giving it a 4, those are 1) the unnatural green color shade of the green tea which makes me think if they really used the natural matcha green tea powder. 2) I noticed a tiny white hair strand in in my ice cream scoop. I kindly informed them about it and they quickly replaced it and apologized. It's no biggie, things like that happens sometimes. 
The ambiance is airy. Thr drinks we ordered have this hint of floral after-taste which was unique.",GOFOO719rt_9jPs02iijzA,0,0,4,Oj6GO9C9oh9j_aq9hsK-HQ

I've been to this place several times now, and it never fails to satisfy my sweet tooth. Boxed Honey Toast ala mode, crepe cakes, and waffle ala mode are the 3 contenders that showcase the cafe itself. They all come with the option of having ice cream, different flavored syrups, and a variety of fruits to choose from. Aside from these are coffee and other nice drinks. In my opinion, the best time to come here is around night, where you can chill after a long day. Why did I take a star off? Well, seating in the cafe is quite fashionable, but not to my liking regarding comfortability. I find the seats to be all oddly spaced out, but no big deal. The point of being there is for the dessert. Now, onto customer service. The cashiers are always usually nice and smile as you decide on your order, and never fail to giggle if you express your excitement towards satisfying your sweet tooth.

But the area inside is cutely quaint. Great music and a nice hipster feel to it with a generous staff to match. 

When it comes to the menu, they currently have a deal where you can get a dessert and a drink and get 10% off your total bill. 
We went with the popular choice: Green Tea Crepe Cake with a scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream (optional, but suggested) and I got a Taro Milk Tea. 

The Green Tea Crepe Cake was very delicate and the green tea cremé that they give you lets you take control over your own sweetness, which I thought was classy. The cake itself is done very well and is not overly sweet. They pride themselves in their plate presentation here so don't expect each Green Tea Crepe Cake to come out looking the same! It's about their individuality! 
The Milk Tea is very standard but a good accoutrement.

We originally ordered the green tea ice cream, however, they told us that it was too soft since it was freshly made. Which was a bummer since I love green tea ice cream.

Frappe was kind of good, you can't go wrong with Nutella(still not good nor great, but just okay). 
But seriously now people, if you don't know different between good and bad dessert(buttercream is bad) don't suggest something to someone. Check you taste buds before you say this crepe cakes are amazing and delicious.!",4vd6CcedfImcInXnk-UJaQ,0,0,2,7axvRFTIRnuOBw6Oej4KLA

1131689,2018-02-16,2,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"Cute little dessert shop that offers pieces of sugary heaven. The name suits it perfectly. 

Must try is the Honey Toast ($5) with your choice of toppings (extra charge). My choices were condensed milk, chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream. Simple. The condensed milk adds more creamy goodness into the toast, while the cold vanilla ice cream tops it off with the warm toasty bread. Perfection. Another great option is the strawberry toppings for that fruitier taste. I have not tried the cakes, but I already can tell they are delicious as well.

I love the interior decor and atmosphere of the place. Nice place to hang out with your friends, but not spacious enough for big parties because of the sizes of their tables. Great photo ops tho. 

Tip *** It is not noticeable to find from the streets. No signage available. When you see Viet Noodle Bar, go in that plaza towards the back.",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,4,2,4,wfxep9XKLDlYoE4r74Of3A

1230009,2018-05-29,4,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"Is Sweet is a cute little coffee/ tea house that serves desserts like slices of cake, brick toast, shaved ice, ice cream. Located in Chinatown, in the same plaza as Viet Noodle Bar (which is located on the corner and can be seen from the street). Just head towards the back of this plaza and you will find Is Sweet.

My husband and I were in the area this past Friday and decided to stop by. We arrived around 8:20 pm. The female employee behind the register had a heavy accent and so I had some trouble understanding her. I felt bad that I had to ask her to repeat herself several times as I had asked questions about the crepe cakes. I do appreciate that she tried and was patience and still smiling despite my repeated asking her to say what she was saying one more time. 

I ended up purchasing Matcha Crepe Cake (to go) $6.50 prior to tax ($7.04 after tax) and consumed the next day (since we were full from our dinner). Since I had ordered this to go, I had a side of matcha sauce packed in a small container. However, if consumed on site, a chocolate drizzle is placed along side the cake (but customers are given a small cup of the match sauce to drizzle on the cake on their own). I thought the cake was very moist and not too sweet, even with the added matcha sauce. My husband liked this cake but thought it would have been nice to also have the chocolate sauce provided to give another added complement flavor to the cake. I am really a fan of crepe cakes and though each layer was perfectly moist and had just the right amount of creme between. 

Wait time was longer for our slice of cake than I had anticipated. I think the employee who took my order may have forgotten about us because I caught her looking surprised as she turned around and saw me (I was sitting across the room, as I waited for my order). Then shortly after, our to go order was brought out to us. 

The prices do seem a little bit more pricey than your typical tea house (there are some fruit teas available for purchase, served in glass mason jars if you choose to enjoy your drink here on site). But I would still probably come back here anyway to try one of the other desserts that they have and most likely would order one of the tea drinks while I am here (I am not much of a coffee person, but they do have several coffee drinks to choose from). 

I like that there is free WiFi available to surf the net and I also like that there is outdoor seating here so that I can bring my 4 legged little girl the next time I am out here in Las Vegas. 

I do want to mention that the indoor seating is kind of small though and was rather busy while we came in. 

Also if you wish to order one of their crepe cakes, it comes in 3 different flavors: matcha, vanilla, red velvet. And lastly, the current Yelp check in offer is 10% off 1 beverage. 

Is Sweet is a cute place if you are into coffee/ tea Asian houses and wouldn't mind adding a dessert to your get together with your friend(s) and/ or date night.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,5,5,4,WpVelcjpFDKZmfaIwGgXiw

My boyfriend and I ordered a taro frappe and honey toast with vanilla ice cream and bananas. I wanted boba in my smoothie, but this place doesn't have it. The taro frappe arrived first, and I like the mason jar they put it in! The frappe was really good. The honey toast was AMAZING. The toast was perfect with the ice cream and bananas. I the middle of the toast it was buttered... so. dang. good. 

The reason I give IS SWEET four stars is because the honey toast took forever. We were done with the frappe by the time the toast got to our table. I know the toast might take a while to cook, but they should have waited to make the frappe until the toast was getting closer to being done. If the place was busier when we were there I can't imagine the wait to get your desserts!

From an aesthetic perspective, this place does have cute vibes. It has mismatched tables and chairs which you find at a lot of coffee shops nowadays. Also the place is nice and clean with big windows. 

The desserts I've had so far have been quite good. My personal favorite, the banoffee, is especially yummy. The crepe cake I loved when I first ordered it since I had never had anything like it, but at subsequent visits it's become less and less appealing to me personally. It tastes mostly like layered whip cream. The drinks are okay. My mango iced tea was delicious, but my coffee was extremely bitter even with cream and sugar.

One event that did ruin this place for me was when I checked their hours online and saw they would be open til 12 am. My boyfriend and I arrived there at 11 pm where we were greated by a sign on the front door that said ""New hours! Open til 1 am!"" So obviously, we were like ""great!"" and proceeded to attempt to place an order. The two male employees there made eye contact with us when we walked in, then proceeded to ignore us for a good two minutes while we waited to place our order. Finally, one of them acknowledged us and said, ""We're closing soon. The kitchen is closed."" I was flabbergasted and thoroughly annoyed, not just that their hours were all over the place, but more so that they let us stand there for two minutes before telling us we wouldn't be served.

Honestly that experience has led me to go elsewhere to fulfill my sweet tooth cravings. Definitely overhyped.",GMm6VR69VTuFtTVteJkcOg,1,0,2,_rOTN0SSpIphqrVM3WeJnA

I asked if she could put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the frozen irish cream latte..and...you have to try it! Lol instead of whip cream, the vanilla ice cream melted into the drink and it was perfection.

The sizzling brownie and ice cream was mouthwatering. The perfect warm brownie allowing the vanilla ice cream to melt into it, was to die for. It was so rich in flavor. The dessert was perfect.

The honey toast with green tea ice cream was also on the dot. It was toasty on the outside and creamy soft condensed milk on the inside. The flavors all just blend together.

I thought the texture of the toast was spot on and adding ice cream complimented it very well. The portion size is big enough for two people to share, but I might have to get one all to myself next time...

Unfortunately, the price for the honey toast was not so sweet. $4 is not bad, but keep in mind, this is the base price for nothing on it. It's $1 extra for topping, $0.50 for sauce, and $1.25 for ice cream. Their base price should have at least included one or two free toppings or maybe even just ice cream...something is better than nothing. After adding some fruits and ice cream cream, our total ended up being $10!! Of course, we knew how much we were adding because we didn't want a plain honey toast. I think my eyeballs almost popped out of my eyes when I heard the shocking price.

Cute little spot in the corner with simple decorations. It's that type of cafe you see in KDramas with the cute chairs, plates and mugs. There is also a lot of room for everyone.. Unless there are campers that stays there for hours then I'm sorry. :(

I have the biggest sweet tooth in the world and this is my heaven.. Jk but comes close. :) I love the variety of combinations you can do with the honey toast and ice creams for a cheap deal! There is a 15minute wait for it but it's well worth it. I love the green tea crepe cake compared to the vanilla and red velvet because it's just the right amount of sweetness. And I always get the taro frappe with ice cream because I'm a taro lover. It never disappoints!

The creme brûlée was a bit heavy on the egg. Might just be my preference, but it wasn't the best one I've tried.

Ordered their signature toast with two scoops of ice cream and a late.  The toast was literally just that drenched in sweetened condensed milk and sugar syrup.  It was topped with strawberries, blueberries, etc.  Two scoops of ice cream tasted like it came out of a bucket from Smart n Final. The coffee was just a little better than Starbucks.

1881677,2015-06-04,0,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"I have been here twice and both times I brought someone new to try the desserts and drinks out with me. Considering my two companions are not hardcore sweet fanatics but very hard to please, we all left blown away. 

It is hard to find the location cause it's tucked away in the corner of a plaza. But I liked that it was not too crowded with restaurants and parking was not tight either.

The first visit we my bff and I ordered four things: 
Lychee tea and mango tea: (so I wanted a tea with lemon and the only one on the menu like that was the Thai tea with lemon but I'm not a big fan of Thai tea.  I asked the guy at the register and he recommended the mango tea to me)
Both were sooo refreshing! She agreed the lychee drink was probably one of the best she's gotten. I got the mango and it wasn't exactly thick like filipino mango juice, not too tart and sweet. Both drinks didnt have that artificial syrupy sugary aftertaste some places that use syrup have. There were also small pulps  of fresh lychee and mango pieces in the bottom of our drinks! Both served ice cold too.

2/4 items ordered approved so far. Now moving onto dessert.

Green tea Mille crepe cake:
This was my first time ordering a crepe cake. I've had crepes before and I was expecting it to be a little heavy cause they are multiple layers of the crepe making up the crepe. Tasted the green tea sauce first which i think to be an anglaise. The green tea was creamy just like how i like it to be. Sometimes some places use green tea that have that jasmine taste but not in this case which i was relieved. The cake itself was melt in your mouth smooth and delicious. Perfectly well balanced, and again, had the right amount of sweetness. The matcha was subtle and not overpowering and the whipped creme wasn't super sweet either. Love love love. The sauce goes well with the cake and the accompanying fruits too.

3/4 items check! We held our breath for the final taste test to seal the deal--

Cheesecake: 
(So i asked the guy if the tiramisu was made with ladyfingers and marscapone cheese like it should be and he said yes. There's only one other place in vegas we've gotten tiramisu that was made right and wanted to try this one made at an Asian cafe for authenticity. Most places will try to use cream cheese or cake is why. So we ordered tiramisu with her drink cause we couldn't decide between the cheesecake and tiramisu. What arrived at our table was the cheesecake lol but we were so happy with our drinks we didn't catch on the mistake at first)
Anyways! the bite of cheesecake was legit I tell you. She agreed it tasted like real NY style cheesecake. Nice and firm, not overtly sugar laden and was creamy but not too too heavy. 

4/4 items check!

Halfway through the cheesecake we finally wondered what happened to the tiramisu. Realized he gave us the cheesecake instead. We were kind of full at this point but we were still interested in tasting it.
We went for the final stretch of approval. Would we get an authentic tasting tiramisu from an Asian cafe?? So we got it lol

Tiramisu:
And omg the first bite sealed the deal. The ladyfingers  in the bottom was soaked in the right amount of coffee liquor. Marscapone cheese was set correctly. Overall, I didn't think it possible but yep, the tiramisu certainly passed! It was a whopping 5/5!!
----
Second visit with the bf late at night we got the passion fruit tea, had him try the green tea crepe cake and a honey toast with just vanilla. 

He said the passion tea was amazing. I thought it was a little on the sweeter side but he said it was perfect. The honey toast he loved. He noted that it wasnt doused with honey like other places. The whipped creme was lightly sweetened and mellowed out the sweetness of the honey and ice cream. The crepe cake he complimented that it was no cake like he ever tried before and was astonished it was just layers of paper thin crepe and lightly sweetened creme.

Overall, yes it was another 3/3 approval from the both of us. Props for consistency!!

Service was great and the lady behind the counter was very friendly and answered our questions. She even let us know where they purchased all their cute serving utensils and dishware which are so cute I wish I could take them home lol. I will purchase them for  sure now that i know where to find them :p

Plus free wifi! Pw is posted near the register, I think it was ""sweetcoffee"" if memory serves correctly.

There is a sauce (matcha for the matcha and raspberry for the red velvet) that you can either dip or pour over the cakes that gives it an extra flavor but without it, it's just alright. I haven't tried their other desserts but I wouldn't be opposed to it aka I'll give it another chance :)",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,1,1,3,b0pesTNZuhX1F5csipE1ng

However.

Despite the fact that a group was having a meeting of 15-20 people there for a couple of hours every week or two weeks for about two months, with virtually everyone in the group buying a drink or dessert, we had a final meeting last week where we decided to go outside since the weather was nice and grabbed some metal chairs and brought them outside.  

The next thing we knew, the girl employee came outside and told us not to be too loud or they'd call the police.  

Wait, we've been steadily supporting you and purchasing your food/drink and you have the AUDACITY to threaten us when we're outside and being professional?  Wow.  

One of our members went inside and very politely reminded them we have been coming every week and purchasing things and we also brought VIP musicians from Japan.  They then said we could come inside and did not apologize, nor address us.  

I might also add I tried to talk to them politely later thanking them and complimenting them on the 2003 Kaskade house music they played but their customer service skills and communication skills are terrible and they either didn't understand or didn't care.  

We sat inside, ordered desserts and coffee and did our meeting but believe me - it's the last.  Never again.  We try to support the small businesses but next time we'll go to Starbucks or something more supportive.  So rude.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,0,0,1,0bCAYYLwGZ2S-qJ05C4Ytw

(This review is mostly experience based & a little about taste)
   So me and some friends finished dinner at the Viet pho place next door to 'is sweet'. We walked over at 11:30 pm, into the 'is sweet' doors at 11:34pm. The close sign said midnight, we arrived nearly 30 minutes before closing. The cashier had already blocked off the register with chairs. When we asked if we could order, they said last call is at 11:30. Last call? Lol I'm at a club/bar? Hahaha! 
   Now I may be wrong, I doubt it. If your business has operating hours till a set time, wouldn't you fully operate till that time??!! If a bank closes at 5pm, does the teller tell you, we stop taking/cashing checks at 4:30. Even restaurants that I've been to from pizza to dessert bars. They never turn down a group of customers. That's your money now and your rating later. 
   I was already 50/50 on if I liked 'is sweet' or 'the patio' better. We were going to give both places one more try before deciding. This just made it a landslide of a win for 'the patio'. If you haven't tried the patio, definitely give there waffle toast and ice cream a shot. Something 'is sweet' doesn't have!",G-lXqfGcJDRmi2iUXuj8Bw,0,0,1,ELrwjwXNGRczv7ZcfaHx5g

My friends and I tried the the Green Tea Mille Crepe Cake, Red Velvet Mille Crepe Cake, Honey Toast, and Nutella Mousse Cake. These desserts were all good but our definite favorites were the Green Tea Crepe Cake and Honey Toast-- you can't go wrong with your choices! 

I love that this place is very intimate and the decor is ""sweet"".. it's good for dates or small groups. The location is bit hidden in the back area of a small shopping complex, so pay close attention to the maps if it's your first time visiting.

The environment is quite and chill; I like to sit here with my laptop and enjoy myself during my day off.

Drink: Iced tea with lychee is my favorite, it tastes fresh and sweet.
Dessert: they have the best honey toast in town, it is little pricey, but I think it worth the price. The green tea crepe cake is very good in here too; they will give you extra green tea sauce and green tea powder on top of the cake.

Overall: Nice place for tea time and chill with your friend.",R494UCWNG5FSg_yhndq1hw,0,0,5,VvZedNcD7WbW1Amuliz7lA

I got the match green tea latte, raspberry leaf decaf hot tea for my friend, a matcha crepe cake, and a tiramisu. Wait wasn't long for to go, and I should've kept the receipt on my first bout because my tiramisu order was missed. I guess I was inattentive to notice that he didn't mention it to me when he repeated my order back.

Anyway, the stuff here was okay and not really worthwhile, I'm sad to say. There several cafes in this city, and I thought the cute aspects of the food would pull me here. Maybe it's cause I ordered to go or was expecting a more exciting menu selection as far as their sweets go, but I feel like the only draw to this place is that it's open fairly late for a place that serves desserts. Though it's true, for a higher price point, you COULD just go to Sweets Raku down the street.

Anyway, if you find yourself looking for a cafe to have coffee and maybe a random sweet bite to eat, come here. But don't expect too much, or you might be disappointed.

Tucked a few spaces down from a Pho establishment is this cute little cafe that looks like most cafes I've seen in Asia. 

A small dessert menu with a few items available only on specific days pairs well with their extensive drink menu. 

To the far right of the counter are the desserts consisting of NY cheesecakes, tiramisu, coffee cake and creme brulee...which I found oddly placed at the end hidden by a few tables and chairs. 
Usually when you have pastries, you would want it to be one of the first things your consumer sees and not the last. 

On this particular visit, our order consisted of a vanilla crepe cake, tiramisu, creme brulee, thai lemon tea, kiwi tea and a mango tea. The cake was pretty good, as well as the tiramisu.  The creme brulee fell short on the texture as it was close to being runny and grainy. 
The tea however was the best part of the entire visit. The thai lemon iced tea was great and I could literally order gallons of this for summer. 

We arrived around 930-945pm and they had already sold out of the green tea crepe cake. They close at midnight,  so I would just assume they would have enough to last till closing...

The toast was a bit difficult to eat because the pieces were not separated at the bottom but the dish came with knives so you must put in some work for the goods.
I'd pass on the  strawberry fruit smoothie next time. It didn't come in a mason jar as the pictures on yelp shows. Instead it came in a plastic to-go cup. The flavor was mediocre, nothing special. Save your money.",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,6,4,5,euPar8kr3hR8QzCs_TKqIg

This place is right next to a new Pho restaurant that just opened up! If that helps anyone! 

When I walked in with my friend, it was a cute little shop. It felt cozy and welcoming. The different tables and chairs made me at home. The people there are friendly and give you when you walk in and if you have any questions about the menu, they will gladly answer it! After looking this place up and reading some other yelp reviews, I decided on the honey toast and the crepe cake. I honestly couldn't decide between the two, so I got both! Haha. We ordered the food and decided to sit outside. They have two tables in the corner overlooking some apartment complexes, the view was okay. Nothing special, we just enjoyed the weather! 

They brought the desserts outside to us and they were presented so sweetly! They looked so appealing on the plate, you didn't want to touch the work of art! The crepe cake came with some raspberry sauce and orange slices, I like the fact that you can pour as little or as much raspberry sauce on your crepe cake. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was almost melt in your mouth. It was good! My friend ordered the green tea crepe, and he enjoyed it just as much as well. The honey toast came out a little later than the crepe cakes, but that was okay because when it came out it was warm and smelled heavenly. It was worth the wait. I love how sweet it was, it was the perfect combination of toast and honey. I added strawberries to mine, so the strawberries balanced the sweetness of the honey. I didn't add any ice cream because I thought it would be a little too much. So getting the honey toast with the strawberries was perfect for me! Writing this is making my mouth water!

After reviewing the menu and having the owners give us some helpful tips, my fiancé and I decided on the matcha (green tea) frappe and the honeydew frappe. We also scored with the 30% yelp check-in offer. The frappé is slightly thicker than a slushy but smoother and lighter than a smoothie. First sips we were fans! Great, strong honeydew and matcha flavor. They had the perfect balance; not too icy or watered down and not obnoxiously sweet. They were perfect! They actually really reminded us of ice cream we would use to buy from the Asian market - very yummy and refreshing. I can definitely see us returning soon and many times when the desert summer heat hits.

Note: I'm comparing the matcha frappe here to the Madhouse Coffee's ""matcha green tea smoothie"" and also the ""matcha ice blended"" from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf - their frappe version here stands up to those top competitors! A lovely and much cheaper version indeed.

We also tried the creme brûlée and it was torched with just the right amount of sugar, again not overly sweet, just right! They topped it with perfectly ripened berries and we savored every bite. I loved the creamy, custardy consistency - not to mention the serving size was decadent and perfect for two.

We saw other mini desserts and cakes that they make in-house; yup, tiramisu was spotted amongst a fruit cream cake, coffee buttercream cake, green tea crepe-like cake, and a few others. (The only dessert not prepared in-house was their New York Cheesecake.)

The prices are great! $4.55 for a large size (24 oz.) Plus they are doing a yelp check-in offer which is 30% off any order, or you can jump on their grand opening special - BOGO 50%. Pretty sweet deals. 

The owners are Thai (a brother & sister duo) and they are so super sweet. They were very attentive and really shined in customer service. They offered to correct our drinks if for any reason we weren't happy with them - the gesture is appreciated, but we didn't even need them fixed. We really enjoyed our drinks!

I lured my parents to check it out too by saying.. we have to walk this pho out and walked right into IS SWEET ;) 

Hiding at the corner, this place is at the very end of the business complex. Mind you, do Not park under the covered parking structure. Or you'll get your car towed! I feel the businesses around this area has picked up exceedingly well from having Viet Noodle Bar open at this location. It works in both favors.. eat some delicious Vietnamese cuisine and then walk a few stores down.. Bam. You got yourself a place for after dinner non-alcoholic drinks and at the same time.. satisfy your sweet tooth ;) The best of both worlds for foodie lovers!!!

I, somewhat lost interest in trying this place, since a coworker told me it was just O-K. Damn I should've just went and tried it myself before dismissing it as the atmosphere is oh so cozy and nice! It was so wonderful. I was admiring the festive decoration they've done for Halloween ;) That's the spirit! I like that about local businesses that are open to do those things that make it fun and welcoming to the guests. It made me smile looking around.. those hanging skulls, bats upside down, skeletons on the windows, spider webs, and mummified skeleton got me in the mood to spook someone.. maybe with my silly laugh that my brother says is something else :P Hehe, keke, haha, hoho.. wait that's for Christmas!

The kind lady that helped me was patient and kind with answering all my questions on what's good here. I looked up and Thai Lemon Tea caught my eyes. My mom was eyeing the creme brulee, so we got those to try. You know when you drink or eat something and that flavor hits you on the first sip or bite and you have this animated cartoon look where your eyes become hearts popping out?! Yeah... my Mom and I had that moment. That Thai Lemon Tea got me. Grabbed my heart and ran kind of feeling. Remarkably refreshing. The hints of sweetness from the Thai Tea followed with sourness of the acidity from the lemon. It's like your favorite candy.. This would be for all the Sour Patch Kids Lovers.. but as a drink! I can seriously become an addict of this one. I slurped this up in F1 racing speed and I was instantly yearning for more. I'm even thinking about it right now as I write this review! Someone save me!!! Heroes! Batman, Superman, Voltron, Optimus Prime!!!??! Help me.. I need this driiiiiink! *with my hands reaching the sky.....Is anyone there?!

Creme Brulee.. one word.. LOVE. Strikingly gratifying. That custard-like creme that just melts on your tongue. Oh... . I'm lost for words. Give me a moment.... ....... ........................... ......... . Not overpoweringly sweet nor lacking of it. It's just a masterpiece. You can't go wrong with this dessert. No way, no how. There's some magic in this. I swear I took one bite and I was in happy land paradise. The sun was shining and a rainbow of color lit my palate. Let me tell you how good this dessert was... I can close my eyes and sleep with a smile :) Get some.

I'm going to stop by after work more often to this place when I just need that dessert fix I can't get from anywhere else. And to be open seven days of week til the strike of midnight?!

Super cute cafe and it's also placed in a hidden location, so the first time I tried finding this place in chinatown it was a hassle but nonetheless, worth finding!

The first time we went, we had the banoffee cake and the matcha crepe cake. For drinks, we had the pistachio latte (my sister's favorite, she always gets it when we go now) and I got the cold brew with a splash of soy milk. What I love the most about this place is the atmosphere of this establishment and the decor matches up with the display of the desserts (both super cute!).

The second time we went, we got the honey toast with matcha ice cream and whipped cream on top with peanut butter. It wasn't all that, still preferred the banoffee cake the most! This time I tried their lychee iced tea and it was super delicious & refreshing!

The last time we went, we took one of our friends with us and she was super impressed with how the cafe looked and was surprised the items on the menu tasted delicious. We got a coffee crumble cake (we were curious, but after taking a bite out of it... it wasn't delicious at all... we ended up throwing it away..), coconut cream cake, and the tiramisu (SO BOMBS!). For drinks, we ordered the Sesame Milk Tea, Pistachio Latte and  Lychee Iced Tea.

We got the popular matcha green tea, and the strawberry one too, the honey toast ( IT WAS SO GOOD FORGOT TO TAKE A PICTURE BEGORE IT DISAPPEARED IN MY STOMACH), summer special chocolate volcano (tastes cold, refreshing, but very sweet) and some others I can't remember from yesterday",p0te2uynErtSpmyD_BWYZg,0,0,4,MXgJ6p_4sgm9vK_BD5sHUA

My first visit here I showed up at around 20 minutes after they had opened. I was expecting to try their green tea crepe cake but the only choices they had that were ready was the coffee cake, and the melted cheesecake. Not quite sure if it's a limited choice every morning.. But I ended up getting the coffee cake. As far as the drinks, there are so many choices to choose from! Coffee, tea, and smoothies! I decided to go with the iced white mocha. 

The icing (which was actually butter cream) on coffee cake was pretty hard to eat at first because it  came straight from the fridge. It didn't really taste that good at first. 
I'm no pastry chef or a baker or anything... So I didn't know I had to wait till the cake wasn't so cold so the butter cream would soften up (the lady who took my order had explained that after I took a few bites from the cake). And man.. It tasted waaay better. Was not disappointed with the cake after that! 

The white mocha. I usually try to avoid ordering a white mocha because a lot of times it comes out too sweet. But! It just sounded delicious at the time so I got it! :D This drink was well balanced and had just the right amount of sweet. I enjoyed it very much! 

Most of their tables seat up to like 3 people. But there is one table I saw that can seat up to I think it was 6.. If you like meeting up with a couple friends/fam & talking over some dessert and drinks, this is a good place for that :)",pkUyjD6yHlBiMTbGYRGO7w,0,0,5,dfPOKmRAtJIoXGSjXjHMpg

2806863,2017-08-01,0,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"I recently discovered honey toast a little under a year ago. Mostly as a dessert at many of the all-you-can-eat sushi places here in Vegas. To my pleasant surprise I found this place, a place that specializes in honey toast!

If you've never had honey toast, it's very difficult to explain. It's almost like one of those Kings Hawaiian rolls with a sweet buttery taste to it. But it typically has a nice crispy crust on the outside.

IS Sweet makes it into an artform.

I came here on a Sunday night around 10:30 PM and it was completely packed. The clientele ranged from tourists to locals having dessert more than likely after dinner here in Chinatown. It's located in a small business/retail park off of Spring Mountain Road. Very easily accessible. Not sure how parking is during the day but at night it was pretty simple to find a spot.

All the drinks are listed on the chalkboard above the server station. Mainly coffees and teas. You have all the traditional's like lattes and mochas and coffee. The food portion is located from what we could tell on a fold out to go style menu by the register.

It's pretty basic. You get your honey toast and you can have it anyway you'd like it. The traditional way with just vanilla ice cream drizzled with fresh honey or anything else out of there multitude of ingredients such as chocolate sauce, green tea ice cream, fresh fruit.

I went ahead and got the traditional. Yummy warm fresh honey toast topped off with vanilla ice cream and honey drizzled all over it. I give this a firm 5/5. It took about 15 minutes to prepare and they let you know this ahead of time. Each honey toast order is about a 15 minute wait which I believe is the big time.

To drink I went with an iced mocha. I'll go ahead and give this one a 3/5. Don't get me wrong it was good and it was tasty but nothing over-the-top about it. Same price as if you were to go to Starbucks or coffee bean or any other place like that.

My friend got the traditional but topped off with fresh strawberries. She gave hers a firm 5/5 also. She had the red velvet latte. They use the powdered flavors here like coffee beans instead of the syrups like Starbucks. It tends to make the light is a little less on the sweet side which we enjoyed.

We sat down patiently waited for about 15 minutes before our two massive honey toasts came out. The taste was incredible. The toast itself had a flaky crispy crust on the outside and the inside had a sweet buttery taste to it that was soft and moist. The ice cream went ahead and melted through and through. The scoop is a little bit small for the size of the toast. It was probably a 5 x 5 square with about a 4 inch tall toast.

These are pretty massive. Saw a lot of people sharing desserts. We went ahead and ordered one each. Luckily we had a light dinner.

I definitely would recommend this place by far. Being in the heart of Chinatown makes it a great spot to go after you have dinner. Ample parking and a clean and minimalistic design on the inside.",zIj-0Aa0bLomrCIsveQ8PA,2,0,5,ui3cI2Exsb06Jja6VpGpiA

I had the honey toast that Amy had recommended and it was to die for! I ordered mine with Nutella and matcha ice cream. The honey toast was huge, definitely enough for two people to share. The price wasn't bad at all too. About $6 for the honey toast with the additional toppings.

Directions: it looks like maps has finally gotten the place correct. I used to always drive past it because the area it's in is pretty odd. The complex contains various businesses, a restaurant, and their cafe at the end. If it's your first time going here, you may or may not miss it. Parking: make sure you do not park in certain covered areas. I believe they still have signs about not parking there. Whether or not they abide by it is not known. 

Decor: such a cute cafe. They have different decorated walls(brick, light pink...etc)various types of comfy chairs and spaces to sit at as well as smaller or larger tables to accommodate 1-2, or larger groups. :) 
*i come here to do work sometimes because of the free wifi, various outlets, and good cafe food and teas to sip on while grading or studying. 

Food/drink: I originally came here because I LOVE crepe cakes and I wanted to try their green tea crepe cake. Still so good! It's lights and fluffy and not overly sweet, with a good matcha flavor. I just recently tried their honey toast and it is also very good! You can add different toppings from the list provided to customize it to your liking. I suggest getting a tea (iced or hot) to pair with it. :)

He then told me the total I don't remember the exact amount maybe close to 20 with 2 drinks and 1 green tea cake to share.  I gladly handed my card...
Well I guess the guy (the owner I think )didn't ring up the ice cream side so he came over to our table to demand our payment of 1 or 2 bucks more because he forgot to ring up the ice cream side!! I have no problem with the amount or paying but as we're eating he interrupted us and made me get up and leave my table to go up to the counter to pay again all over 2bucks max...

You're that cheap !? was it really worth rudely interrupting my date and I's conversation and making us get up from our seats demanding me to pay you 2 bucks more when it was your fault to begin with, he didn't even apologize !?

The tea came out promptly in the cutest teapot ever! The tea was strong but I found the rose flavor a little too subtle. I originally wanted to order just two cups but was recommended to get the whole pot instead, and I'm glad I did! For just a dollar more we got at least 4 cups worth of tea.

The honey toast takes a bit of a wait, but they make it to order so it comes out hot with a crisp exterior. I found it a bit dry but it was great when eaten with the ice cream. It comes with honey and whipped cream but they also offer other toppings for an additional charge. 

I had a little trouble finding this place as it's tucked away in a corner. Also found the menu a bit confusing as they display just the drinks on the menu board and have the desserts and prices scattered near the counter.

From the street you would never walk-in here mostly because you couldn't see the place. It's at the very end of a random strip mall between a few restaurants and I believe and empty building.  

I walked in and it was completely empty, which was a good thing, because this place is very tiny, maybe eight tables and a few chairs with coffee tables. I was hoping for a savory something to eat, but obviously with a name like IS SWEET, I shouldn't have been so optimistic. I took the cashier's advice and went with the Honey Toast over a waffle and an Iced Americano. 

The iced Americano was very good. Most places don't have the proper gear to provide a solid espresso drink, but IS SWEET pulls it off nicely. No funky or burnt aftertaste, pure caffeinated bliss.

The Honey Toast here might as well be the Incredible Hulk of breakfast breads. Think thick like Texas Toast and sweet like Hawaiian bread. Then cover that in Nutella and a vanilla pudding with side of whipped cream. Yowza, food can get you sexually charged. Not only did I eat the entire thing, I pretty much inhaled it with about three bites. I'm not a sugar lover so; you can imagine how good this dish is. 

The bottom of the Honey Toast was crispy from being lightly fried, but the middle of the bread was so airy and soft, that the drizzle on top slowly weighed it down and actually had the bread dipping in the center. Great textures and flavor combos going on with this sweet option. 

The menu is filled with so many beverages and sweet confections, that I'm already figuring out ways to get myself in this part of town more often.

My bf got a strawberry smoothie that came in a jar. Even though there wasn't a lot of fresh strawberries (the guy used some sort of puree / syrup) my bf thought it still tasted good, but it would've been preferably if they threw in more real strawberries.

The waffle was served nice and warm and was actually larger than I expected loaded with a ton of toppings! This was heaven. The Honey Dew Milk and Lychee Tea were really good as well served in cute mason jars.

I ordered the red velvet crepe. I didn't order anything else because I wasn't sure about ordering more from the menu till I try the crepe. The presentation of the crepe was very pretty. The crepe though was just plain...didn't taste like red velvet. It taste like I was just eating lots of whip creme. Sorry nothing great.,scvItRZwR9vZc1fwG8k35A,1,2,3,q9JHMPcV79qm9lCnNSaw4A

Cute and cozy, IS SWEET is a great dessert getaway in the same complex as Viet Noodle Bar. 

Honey toast and cakes are plated with great presentation. 
Two popular desserts:
- 6.50 for crepe cake (Vanilla, matcha, or red velvet) 
- 4.00 for honey toast base, toppings range from .50 to 1.26
- big variety of coffee and hot tea available 

Small staff is very nice. IS SWEET has a small, family-owner vibe to it. 

This place barely missed the mark, but the honey toast was not cooked completely through after coming out of the freezer and still had that undone/overly chewy bread thing going on at some parts instead of being crisp and caramelized. 

Call me a 5 year old, but actually cutting a honey toast mountain with a butter knife is close to an act of God. Perhaps next time I'll BYO Knife, but at least there will definitely be a next time!",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,8,5,4,kcKq-XsUI190NoI0tek77A

Small and quaint space.  Like all the different chairs and tables which adds to a rustic feel.  We ordered the Matcha Crepe Cake, Hello Kitty Strawberry Cake and Nutella Cake.  The presentation was done well.  

The  crepe cake was too pretty to eat.  Those layers though!!!  And drizzling the matcha sauce on the crepe cake made for a good video.  I was expecting so much more for the crepe cake and I felt it wasn't as good as I anticipated.  Not sure if it is the matcha flavor but it didn't wow me when I ate it.  I just didn't love it.  Presentation wise, it's gorgeous.  Is Sweet also offers the crepe cake in vanilla and red velvet.  I'll have to come back and give the other flavors a shot.

The Strawberry Cake and Nutella Mousse were light and tasty.  Not too sweet and just the way I like it.  The Nutella Mousse was a beautiful presentation as well and super cute.

I highly recommend their crepe cakes. They make three different flavors (Vanilla, Matcha, and Red Velvet) and each one is delicious. They are not overly sweet and one slice can be shared between two people. You can also add ice-cream on the side.

My personal favorites are the Vanilla and Matcha. However, if you're not a fan of the green-tea based flavor, it might be best to order the other two. One time, I saw a couple waste the whole thing! I guess they're not a fan of the Japanese green tea?

Maya, one of the owners, is very nice. She's usually the one working behind the counter. Every time my fam and I come here, she remembers us.

When I initially entered, the first thing I noticed was the sweet aroma; it just made me crave it all even more! All the sweets on display were tantalizing me (creme brûlée and cheesecake, among others), but I came for one thing and one thing only.

We ordered the green tea crepe cake, and it comes with the option of ice cream. We chose vanilla to complement it. As soon as we got our order, wow! We were so impressed by the display and presentation. A+ for that. We drizzled the green tea sauce over the ice cream and cake, and dug in.

OH. MY. GOODNESS. WOW. The texture was fluffy! Layers of crepe sandwiching sweet cream, together with the ice cream, and matcha sauce all created an orchestra of flavor! It was amazing. It was also served with berries to help break some of the green tea flavor. But wow was it good. The next time I came back, I tried the vanilla crepe cake with strawberry ice cream, and personally, I had more of an affinity for that one!

The service was really good. The cashier (a younger man with what sounded like a Thai accent) was very nice and very pleasant. He was very patient when we were debating ordering other items, and always managed to keep a smile on his face. He was the one who also prepared our dish, and delivered it straight to us at our table.

We also ordered the honey toast. Toppings tip applies to this too. Nonetheless, the honey toast was amazing, done perfectly. We added just strawberries. My family and I enjoyed this one so much, it disappeared in less that two minutes, if that.

Here! Toast is like half a loaf full of carbs, and smothered with your dessert dish. Breakfast dessert fusion. Hey I like that! 

Cute interior. Nothing exactly matches tables and chairs wise. I'll say I approve of its kookyness : )

Nice ladies helped us place our order. I think one of them almost wanted to laugh at me and Ness having an eedy beedy teensy weensy argument over what we wanted for toppings. And so it turned out like our picture as posted. 

Like mother like daughter - sweet tooth mania. One thing we did agree on without questions- iced matcha green tea. 

What's cool is you pretty much build onto your honey toast. There are more fun flavors and fusions on the menu. They also offer regular cake slices like tiramisu, chocolate, and cheesecake. Cavity chasers this is your place!

I handed her two cards stating that this dog is protected by federal law and that she is allowed to go anywhere that I go, she's a medical necessity.

She was nice about it, I know she meant no harm and she's just doing what she's told, but her managers should know that the law states that a service dog is welcome everywhere a human is. PERIOD.

It was only $6 which I think is not bad for crepe cake cause I know how time consuming it is to make. I also added vanilla ice cream and I have no idea how much extra it was to the overall cake. I was also impressed on how fast I got my crepe cake because there was only one person working behind the counter and there were a few customers. When I finally got my matcha crepe cake with vanilla ice cream, I HAD to take a picture with it. I give the green tea cake a 10/10! It was super light and the vanilla ice cream paired well with it. I also love the strawberries and how well the matcha sauce coincided with the matcha crepe cake and vanilla ice cream. The cake is shareable.

This place is very colorful and vibrant which perfectly matches their beautiful desserts. 

What drew me to this place was the green tea crepe cake. Every time I would come to study here I couldn't resist getting one because it was irresistible delicious. 

Last time I was here I just got the jasmine green tea I believe. Even before I would finish the tea, the lady came around and refilled my tea with hot new water. I thought that was really awesome. Its rare to get service like that in coffee places now a days. 

For studying, this place is a hit or miss. There's a lot of families and big parties who come that can be quite loud.

Mom Rating 3/5 

This is a small location with limited seating and is quite small if trying to navigate the space with a stroller. They did not offer high chairs and I don't believe they had a changing table in the bathroom either. The vibe is a bit date night but has a welcoming fast casual vibe as well.

I wish there were more choices with the drinks because sometimes I just want a regular milk tea, but they still have a good selection of other flavors.

3630609,2018-04-03,0,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"My review could more accurately be described as a 3.5 than a 3 star. Is Sweet is not great enough cumulatively for me to rave about, but I would optimistically return for another round or two of Creme brûlée.  

After searching up Japanese/Asian style patisseries in the area that were open around 2 pm, Is Sweet came up. From the street it's not the easiest to find (is anything, on Spring Mtn Road though?) but I busted a few U Turns for my sweet tooth. There is no large sign outside clearly marking or displaying their banner. 

Parking is decent, and upon entering you are greeted by cutesy chintz furniture that is a bit miniature, and mismatched. Lots of tiny tables and couches to settle around. Cute decor and great lighting, probably a great place for Snapchat pics, who knows. A few well-dressed young Asian women were there already, holding gossipy conversations. 

My friend and I came up and the staff did not greet us, just stopped their conversation, came to the front, and looked up expectantly. The young girl at the front seemed decently friendly taking my order, but the young man acted like he did not get paid enough to do what he did. Probably true. I wish you were paid more, my dude. 

I said hi, perused the selection, then got the iced Taro tea latte, which sounded delicious, but had no descriptors to it. I myself have worked at a place that did a DELICIOUS ""purple Oreo"" smoothie (which was just taro frappe mix, and Oreos, blended), so I had high hopes for this. After looking at their delicious display, I chose to get a creme brulee because I had been having major creme brulee cravings recently. You know, normal things. I also got a slice of beautiful coconut cake to-go for a family member because it looked yummy. 

My friend got the same taro tea latte, but a chocolate cake. The pricing for desserts was typical, kind of expensive, but it looked like their crepes and honey toast were priced better though I didn't get any. Maybe next time!

After taking our orders, we sat down and the girl came by to deliver our beautifully plated desserts and our lattes. I just had to take a photo!   

Because I was excited for them both, I tried the latte first, but was incredibly disappointed! The menu/staff did not warn me that instead of it being a latte (espresso + milk) with taro flavor, it's actually just taro-flavored milk (was there tea in there? As a constant tea-drinker, I highly doubt it, but it's possible it was in there, albeit very weak). I felt like a 5 yr old sipping that milk-flavored taro drink. BIG TRAGIC. 

Next, I broke the surface of the creme brulee. It gave a nice little crack like it was supposed to, and though the sugar coating on it was quite thin it was D E L I C I O U S. I love a good creme brulee, and this place did not disappoint. 

It was very Japanese-y, meaning that besides being beautifully presented, the dessert itself did not overwhelm the taste of the creaminess with too much added sugar. Japanese are all about that delicacy, and I loved every bite. It wasn't a large portion but for the price I'd get it again. 

Partway through my dessert I got up to get a cup of water, which I loved that they had available. Many legitimate Japanese patisseries have cups of water available self-serve on the side, and this place had a cute little corner with the water infused with berries and cucumbers. Ahh, so Japanese. I felt a tad bit like I was back in Japan again. 

We stayed and chatted there for a bit, but the latte disappointed me so much I left it half-full. As someone who absolutely hates waste, I was pretty sad about it. Maybe next time I'll ask them to make me a legit latte and ask to add taro flavor. I don't care how weird it sounds, because of that sad drink I'm determined to get it the better way next time! 

Overall, would return again and ask for espresso in my latte, and maybe try a crepe with my creme brulee.",j8bhSD379qzoVa15RSCBUw,0,0,3,TJd0mtOeB5RKQGfqqpkr2g

Recently, I decided to study at Is Sweet (also because I really wanted a cup of their rose hot tea). The location is fairly quiet for reading and studying, unless it gets packed with people but I don't blame them for wanting to visit this cute little cafe. I normally just get their hot teas, which are all fairly priced (a whole tea pot for $5, $2 for a cup). Their rose tea is just loose leaf tea with rose petals, it's both pleasant to smell and to look at. To make your tea even better, you have to order their honey toast! You pretty much build your own, starting at $5 and more depending on the toppings you choose. You can't go wrong though, it's so good and they prepare it thoroughly. Come here on a cute little date with a friend or SO, or come by yourself to catch up with some reading or studying - you'll love it! 

Also, they're also very generous - one of the workers asked if we would like more hot water in our tea pot since we finished it very quickly. Thank you, Is Sweet!",opBLkWisJQi5yqJb9mdTgw,0,1,5,ghGR08dmtc4ep93KGrhi0g

Ordered the 24oz iced coffee on a weekday afternoon. The one barista working was busy and it took some time for him to get to me but he had a smile on his face the entire time which seemed to just melt any ounce of impatience I had away. I typically down my tall coffees from Starbucks within seconds, so I was pretty happy knowing I still had coffee left after 3 hours of sitting on my bum.

Environment: casual cafe with coffee, matcha, red velvet and different variations of latte in accordance with the season. Seating is a bit scattered and inconsistent. Music is your standard top hits more leading towards electronic. 

Food and beverage: I've ordered the red velvet latte before, which had hints of red velvet, with the rest being cream and espresso. Good roast on the americanos. The crepe cakes vary from matcha , red velvet and others. I had the red velvet, very light  simple cream layered crepes. Depending on how long ago they made it can determine how good it really is. Better to have it freshly made.

The cake was clearly on point with presentation and texture was great however it was very bland and boringgggg- hardly any flavor, it was more like eating a lukewarm green tea with no sweetener (which is obvi not what I ordered) so definitely wouldn't recommend flavor wise. The reason for the 4 stars is for their drinks. Unfortunately I can't remember what drinks I ordered but I had two of their teas (both cold) and two of their coffees (both hot) and they were absolutely delightful!

So we came here at quarter to 11 pm. The girl up front had tons of patience (there were 5 of us) because we'd never been there and we had tons of questions. I loved her! 

Inexpensive!

I got MATCHA CREPE CAKE with STRAWBERRY ICED TEA. The cake was good, as it wasn't too sweet. There was just a hint of sweetness and a full flavor of matcha. The tea was so simple, yet the most satisfying! Tasted fresh, not artificial. Again, just a hint of sweetness. Not overpowered with ice! Perfect drink. 

We also got the STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE ICED TEA. The sorbet under the ice cream was very refreshing. It was light, airy, smoothie like. 

The COFFEE CAKE is a MUST TRY! They are genius for this. It is very rich yet melt in your mouth delicious. It has a strong coffee flavor. It's like an edible macchiato. Topped with toffee coated nuts, it's just the most pleasing dessert around! 

We also had HONEY TOAST and SIZZLING BROWNIE. We got the toast with cream and strawberries. It was simple, but flavorful. It was light, but filling, buttery, soft, and addicting!

I ordered an iced caramel machiato and a green tea crepe cake. The coffee was nothing special but I really enjoyed my cake! One good thing about Asian bakeries, in my opinion, is that the desserts are never overly sweet. I was able to taste the green tea without it being hidden behind sugar. The presentation is super cute too. My friend custom ordered honey toast with berries, pocky and a bunch of other toppings and a custom coffee as well.

Stopped by here with some friends on a weeknight to study.. because what else do medical students do but study right? 

I will give credit where credit is due. Is Sweet is indeed a sweet place to get a drink, dessert, and yes, study. Good drinks (I had a strawberry slushie) and the desserts also looked good. It really had great potential to become my new favorite study spot!

About 2 hours in, me and my friends were approached by the cashier and was told (not asked) that he needed our table because a large group 'coming in'...... He followed up suggesting we could move to a smaller table if we wanted. ?!?! (There were also no empty tables at the time when he told us to move)

Now, I've been to my fair share of cafes of all kinds and NEVER NEVER NEVER have I been told I need to give up my seat to make room for a bigger party (aka more $$$) Yes, a cafe is a business and business is business, but how is this the way to treat your customers?

Sorry to the bigger party, but could they not have gotten their drinks to go? Or sat separately?

To be fair, he came over one more time when we were packing up and offered to put some tables together for us. I was already in a sour mood and wanted to get out of there already. Didn't even finish my slushie. :(

We confronted the waiter about it afterwards and there was back and forth arguing that I would rather not get into. 

Bottom line, my experience was a big no no in my book. I am very glad that others have had positive experiences here. I really was enjoying myself up until we were told to move or leave. As always, this was just my experience and I hope everyone has a better one!",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,18,12,1,EM0AAp7uQVTQTI-G3IwJtg

I was so excited to get a slice and have my sister help me finish it!  I also showed her photos of the Bear cake, coconut cake, and Red Velvet...

However, when we got there at around 10pm, they were all sold out.

Instead, we shared the Matcha Green Tea Crepe Cake, the Chocolate Volcano drink, and the Strawberry Cheesecake Shave ice.  Yumm!  Sugar overload!

On my next visit to Vegas, Dear Daniel and Minky went with me to make another attempt for the Hello Kitty cake... there was none.  Maybe It was sold out again?  Arg!  

Since we were there, I got the Creme Brulee... it was a great snack because it tied me over until our next meal!

Although there are plenty of these types of cafes in Southern California, IS Sweet is one of a kind here in Vegas. Much like the decor, their desserts are playful, often featuring bears or Hello Kitty atop their cakes. In addition to the standard flavored iced teas, milk teas, and coffee, they have desserts such as honey toast, waffles, and crepe cakes. My favorite is a slice of the matcha green tea crepe cake with green tea sauce to top it off. I love how light and airy it is. 

If you're looking for something more refreshing, they are running a special during the summer with shaved snow. The tropical mango shaved snow features shaved mango with pieces of fresh mango topped off with a scoop of mango ice cream and mango sauce. Did I mention it had mango? The price is steeper than most of the other desserts at $10, but it's also meant to be shared between 2-3 people (I ended up devouring most of it myself). I have yet to try their tiramisu, chocolate cake, or NY cheesecake. 

The presentation of all their desserts (on wooden boards) and drinks (in mason jars) are social media-worthy, especially with their tables and seating. It's also a nice place to hang out with friends, with plenty of seating and free wi-fi.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,3,1,4,U8uHruGZ83qQNOQuFMqi8w

This hole-in-the-wall spot is located on Spring Mountain in between Lindell and Decatur next to Viet Noodle Bar all the way in the back! 

Here are what I've tried so far: 

- Matcha crepe cake: light and tasty. It has the perfect amount of matcha in it. I love the sauce that comes with it!!! 
- Red Velvet Crepe Cake: my favorite. 
- Vanilla Crepe Cake: My least favorite of the crepe cakes but it's still delicious if you want something simple. 
- Strawberry & Kiwi Honey Toast w/ Strawberry Drizzle & Ice Cream: HUGE dessert that's great to share with 3-4 people. The toast is warm, crunchy and tastes amazing with any topping you pick. You can put as many toppings as you'd like so go ham w/ it. Enjoy the honey toast while it's nice and warm. Takes about 20 mins to make since they make it to order. 
- Chocolate Brownie w/ Ice Cream: Yummmm 
- Peppermint Tea (Excellent for colder nights. I recommend getting a pot to share w/ friends) 

You can order a bunch of desserts to enjoy. None of them are overly sweet. It's always the perfect balance. They also have tiramisu and other desserts to try as well! IS Sweets adds new items all the time so keep a lookout! 

The place gets packed quickly since it's small so be prepared to either sit outside or get your dessert to go if you come here on a Friday or Saturday night. Still tastes great even if you get it to go! 

Price is reasonable. Each dessert is roughly $7-9 depending on how much you tip. 

Absolutely LOVE this place. Each time I come the experience is great. Service is phenomenal. Food and teas are delicious. For sure a 5 out of 5!

The cake was OK.  It was a little dry.  I didn't ask if the bakery items are made in house but my guess is that they are not.  Presentation of the cake on a wooden platter was nicely done.

Then came the chocolate volcano.  It's a frappé that very thick, very rich with a ton of chocolate flavor, and then topped with chocolate powder for an extra chocolate kick.

I come here to study a lot because it's the perfect place to study with its ample seating and wifi, plus they are open until midnight. It's also a good place to catch up with a friend. Their interior is Instagram-worthy and has lots of personality. They even have a small patio seating outside, unfortunately you only get a view of parking and apartment complex next door but is still nice to enjoy the fresh air.

 A worker here told me their crepes are most popular dessert. They have the option of matcha, vanilla and red velvet. I have tried matcha and vanilla and have to say their matcha is my favorite. Crepe has multiple layers and looks beautiful. Texture is super creamy and velvety. Vanilla crepe came with a chocolate ice cream on the side and even with the same creamy texture, it didn't taste like vanilla.

As far as drinks goes, my most favorite is their iced chocolate. It's basically a hot chocolate poured over ice. It was so good my friend had finished her's in 5 min LOL

Lychee green tea is good if you want something refreshing, but make sure to ask for less sweet. 

On one visit, a worker told me I can mix the flavors and that his favorite drink here is the strawberry lychee green tea. I asked for less sweet and it still came out really sweet. I enjoyed the small lychee pulp inside.

I truly believe we eat with our eyes first and everything is presented beautifully-it's all picture and social media worthy! My one complaint or recommendation is to figure out a way to increase their seating. Their seating is pretty limited which I can see posing an issue as they get more and more popular. 

My sister, niece, and I stopped in for dessert after lunch somewhere else. Located at the end of a small plaza this space has lots of natural lighting and some unique decor. It's very whimsical and vintage looking. There's about 6 tables with seating for 2-6. They serve cups and pots of tea, different coffees and lattes, and a handful of desserts. They had different cakes and even an almost make your own honey toast option where you can pick toppings and sauces.

Today we tried their green tea crepe cake, tiramisu, Nutella bear cake, and a taro latte. Everything was plated super cute, had a little wow factor, but most importantly was tasty and affordable. My favorite item we got was the  taro latte with the crepe cake with added ice cream on the side. The latte wasn't very sweet at all and honestly tasted like taro and milk but was so refreshing.

This place was super cute, all their items we tried were not overly sweet, and the pricing was right. I'll definitely be back to try their honey toast.

Update: stopped by a second day in a row and tried their pistachio latte and a strawberry cheese cake shaved ice that was to die for! Perfect for the vegas heat.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,1,2,5,MNhJi9pcE8SAzmEFaiHxwQ

Heavily sweetened, so definitely more dessert-y than coffee shop-y. The little ones were with me and opted for a red velvet frappe. IS SWEET. But still good. If I were by myself, I would definitely try one of the other, not so sweet flavors. The kids loved it, of course, especially with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top.
Wow, those 2 drinks were pretty filling, but I figured I'm not in Chinatown that often, better go for the signature honey toast. I make honey toast at home myself, but it's actually just a piece of toasted bread with country crock and honey on top. So imagine that, gourmeted and freshened up. Yum. The ""toast"" is very thick and kinda airy - more like a waffle than bread, I would say. They offer a huge selection of toppings, so we went with the cashier's recommendation of nutella, vanilla ice cream, and fruit (blueberries). It was good, but sooo sweet and over the top, after we just had a couple sweet drinks. If I were to go again, I might just get a plain honey toast or sample one of the other kinds of desserts they had in the display case. 
Even though there are lots of coffee and tea drinks to choose from, this is not a coffee shop. Especially considering they don't even open til noonish.
If it were closer to my house, I might actually be a regular, but at this location, I'll probably only be back on special occasions or to bring out of town visitors.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,2,3,4,xCcGU80pQrPVpP9HZsFMXw

I have tried other honey toasts and didn't care for them so I only ordered it because my friend wanted to try it. I am happy she did!

IS SWEET is relatively new dessert shop in the back of the Viet Noodle Bar plaza. Is open until midnight; is why we went here after dinner ended late.

Is menu with many typos. Is not so professional for that reason.

Is pretty good honey toast ($4). Is more expensive with toppings, ice cream especially being important for texture ($1.25), strawberry ($1) nice too. Is very good overall. Is not sickeningly sweet.

Is also good jasmine tea ($5 for a pot). Is hot and is strong jasmine flavor. Is also complimentary lemon-infused water at condiment/utensil/napkin counter on the side.

Is place with many other desserts and drinks. Is probably worth returning to try other items.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,4,4,ODRQvBg4DDPN-syV4qOePQ

I wanted to impress them with a hidden gem however this is maybe the first or second time I've ever been steered wrong by Yelp reviews. The second I walked in I felt totally awkward. Literally like a kid in high school walking into the school cafeteria for the first time. While the employees were not outright rude to me or my mother.. they did not welcome us, make any sort of suggestion, or even ask the basic what can I get started for you today. Instead they looked at us like we legit had 3 heads which left me totally confused and feeling like I'd done something wrong like I came in during the final five mins of them being open and placed some ridiculous order. 

Their Red Velvet Frappe wasn't bad, but honestly if you're looking for a Red Velvet frappe to knock your socks off.. go to MadHouse coffee instead. I also had creme brûlée, I didn't like it. My mom tried it and she thought it was gross. My dad basically looked at us both and said I'm not gonna have it go to waste and ate it..

IS SWEET is in the back of an already unknown plaza on Spring Mountain. The restaurant is small and filled with mismatched couches and tables. You can either say it has an antique feel to it or say it looks worn down. Your choice. 
The crepe cakes are not on the main board menu (small board off to the side - $4.50). The matcha crepe cake (or mirufiiyu in Japan) has the true bitter matcha taste. None of that over sweetened stuff from Starbucks they call matcha! The honey toast has a cheap initial price of $4.50 but it adds up once you start adding your toppings. Strawberry icecream and bananas are my favorite combo. Nutella is too strong of a flavor and kills the buttery taste of the toast. Leave the nutella for something else! 
The ice coffee was decent. Everything is served in a mason jar.

We had some trouble finding this place (the directions on Uber were wrong), but were pleasantly surprised when we finally found it! Cute decor and a decently sized seating area. 
Because I am a matcha fanatic, I decided to get the matcha crepe cake with green tea ice cream and an iced green tea latte. My boyfriend got honey toast with condensed milk, strawberries and strawberry ice cream and an iced taro tea latte. The drinks took a few minutes. My green tea latte was amazing, but the taro tea was a little powdery, but still good. Not too sweet. The crepe cake came out next. It was beautiful, and my boyfriend and I spent quite a few minutes taking pictures of it and a video of me pouring on the matcha sauce over it. The cake itself was delicious! It was sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, but wasn't an overload of sweetness. The green tea ice cream they used was my favorite part about it though...I wonder what brand of ice cream it was? Whatever it was, it was one of the best green tea ice creams I've ever had. Just as we were finishing my crepe cake, my boyfriends honey toast came out. It was beautiful as well, and the guy working also gave us a side cup of condensed milk in case we wanted extra. It was amazing. The toast was perfectly warm and crispy on the edges.

Very difficult to find which makes this place even more alluring once you finally find it.  It's in the plaza right before the jade/ramen area.  You'll pass by a few law firms and an acupuncture clinic before you find it nestled as the very last building. 

Until 04/30th there is a promotion going on for buy one get one 50% or 30% with a yelp or facebook check in.

Setting: Very cute and they did a good job at going for the coffee shop fad that is going on now. The music playing is your typical bon iver type radio station that isn't on too loud like it is at serenade or cafe darak. There are plenty of places to sit which accommodate mostly couples but there is a large that fits six.  Another highlight of this place is the amount of outlets available. This store definitely took the effort to install outlets to help techies like me stay charged.

Service: The female manager was very kind and delivered a convincing story to her coffee shop. Basically, ""We don't serve drinks that we don't like,"" which makes total sense.  Why conform when you should create a product you yourself would want to buy?

Drink: I got the hazelnut frappe which could have been blended better but it was still good.

4352948,2017-07-08,1,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"For years now I have been attempting to try a crepe cake.  One of the other local eateries used to be one of the few that offered this elusive delicacy, but every time I tried in vain to    finally try it they ran out.   Then within my yelp feed, Is Sweet  appeared, promising me a new hope of completing this goal that had almost become but a dream. 

On an amazingly hot day after ending up on this side of town, I made my move and headed up spring mountain on my conquest.  It was in the same shopping center as Viet noodle bar,  and was tucked all the way at the end.  They have outside seating for days that won't sear  your eyelashes off,  and upon entering they had an assortment of couches, nice chairs,  and more traditional small table areas. They have a selection of different beverages and other desserts likes coconut cake,  tirimisu etc but I had my eye on the prize for their crepe cake. The matcha green tea flavor to be exact...and they were not out! So happy! They give an option to adding ice cream,  however I first wanted to try it on its own. 


After placing my order I wanted to sit in one of the cool squishy chair areas, but no one bused that table yet, so we found a spot by the wall. There was a spot where you could serve yourself lemon water if you don't purchase one of their many refreshments like me.   

When the cake was brought out I was surprised how large is was. Layer after layer of crepe with whipped cream between the layers,  and a small container to pour the matcha sauce all over it.   There was also some fresh fruit which involved a cut up strawberry, two cherries,  and an orange slice and what tasted like a cherry sauce drizzled in the plate.   The cherry sauce helped create a good acid contrast to the mellow sweet matcha and whipped cream flavors.   The strawberries paired nicely,  but the cherries were way tart.   Overall the dish was executed well, although if I went again I would try out their other desserts before jumping back again to the crepe cake.  I hope to find it at another place so I can compare it, but I feel like this is a great jumping off point. 

One thing I will say as a side note, is that table that had never been bused was still dirty when I left in addition to 2 other tables.   It would be nice if they paid more attention to their dining area because it really was not very busy.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,1,1,4,UPW3XTtlcds_8c7LdDEPCw

When I first moved here 3 years ago I would regularly search for honey/brick toast options in the valley and would always end up exasperated and resigned to the fact that I'd have to satisfy that craving when I visited California.

Now 3 years later and honey toast is all over the place! TBH I came here two years ago to see if they had honey toast and they did not at the time which was a bummer but not anymore!

Anyway, for a Wednesday night this place had a steady stream of customers at 10:30 PM. I came along because I needed to kill time waiting for my husband. While I'm confident in doing things independently, you won't be self-conscious and alone because there are tons of people studying.. going on dates.. celebrating with their families. 

Service is good. They answered my questions and were patient when I couldn't decide what to order and if I wanted it for here or to go. Finally I settled on honey toast with chocolate sauce, strawberries, and vanilla ice cream along with a mango iced tea. Both were so good. SO GOOD. The mango tea was a little sweet and heavy on the syrup but that was fine. The ice dilutes it. The honey toast is definitely shareable. It took about 10 minutes to make so be patient. Also recommend eating it as soon as you can (and not taking it to go).

He is super kind and friendly, as well as the other employees! Though we don't come everyday, you can still catch is here at least once a week. 

Location and decoration: This cafe is quite hidden and is easily missed, but the great part is there's plenty of parking. It's in the very corner of the Plaza, and the entrance is next to the covered parking spots. The inside of the cafe is adorable. Vintage, mismatched furniture and dreamy music gives off that indie, coffee shop vibe where you come to read a book on a rainy day. I just love it in here. Plus, they have free WiFi so you can do homework.

My personal favorite drink is either the black sesame milk tea or the Thai lemon tea. Must try!! For desserts, I would recommend the matcha mille crepe, creme brûlée, or create your own waffle. The desserts aren't overly sweet, just the perfect amount of sweetness!

Hidden in the back corner of some small business square away from the busy streets of Las Vegas Chinatown, this is an average cute coffee shop to visit.

For the price of $4/5 I thought that our drinks would go as expected, but:
-The Coffee Frappe turned out overwhelmingly bitter. The guy willingly changed it to dark chocolate per our request. 
-Dark Chocolate was good and definitely preferable over White Chocolate, which was my sister's pick. 
-While I instantly almost fell in love with the Mango Iced Tea, I was thrown off by learning and seeing that they're already pre made in a pitcher. The generic sweetness led me to believe that my drink was made out of powder. Hence the absence of real mango bits and/or authenticity. 

Our customized Honey Toast topped with Nutella, whipped cream and chocolate powder was the safest pick and tasted just right. A bit stylish. The Nutella flavor was abundant in your mouth. It didn't take long for us to finish it.

Although there was effort to make the cafe cute and snazzy, the ambience just felt a bit underwhelming for me. Could it be the underground electronic music? The disorganized seating arrangement?

Red Velvet Crepe Cake ($6.50): Definitely pretty with the contrasting red and white layers and as a crepe cake, decent, however, there was zero flavor suggesting ""Red Velvet."" Obviously, the draw of this is the fact that it is red velvet and it's unfortunately a sham. It's randomly served with a strawberry preserve. Hard pass.

Honey Toast with Strawberries, Condensed Milk, Vanilla Ice Cream ($7.00): You can order Honey Toast as is ($4), but I don't think it would be very tasty by itself. It definitely needs toppings. I was concerned at first since the toast isn't sliced into pieces and not what I'm used to, but the elements were all there.

Vanilla Crepe Cake and coffee were ok, and it's a nice little coffee house.  That's where it starts and stops.

Over-priced for food where no baking is done on premises.

If I'm spending $13 on a piece of cake and coffee, it better be high quality and made fresh daily there(neither of which are the case), not shipped in from another bakery.

There's a string of these Asian Coffee/Tea dessert places that are grossly overpriced.  

Crown Bakery, Sweets Raku, Baguette Cafe, Rosallie: just a few places where they actually make their food on premises and charge accordingly.  In fact, less expensive in some cases plus higher quality.

The crepe itself was just okay. Nothing I would go back for again. It was just too sweet and lacked the green tea flavor I was looking for. It was also on the mushy side because of the cream fillings in between each crepe layer. It also came with a sauce to pour over but that just overpowered the cake too much in my opinion. The drinks were good though! I tried the taro milk tea and it delicious! It didn't taste powdery or artificial at all. The red velvet frappuccino was also really good. It tasted more like coffee than a chocolate cocoa though so if you like coffee drinks you'll like that.,cLFOKo3WRtsK4oB6yAPw8A,0,0,4,Ev-DAowcBm6_E4h4J_ve2g

I ordered a caramel macchiato, toast with strawberries and bananas and the green tea mille crepe.

I couldn't help but return the next day for a honey toast after seeing the pictures on Yelp! Both items were delicious, and came out pretty quickly (the sign on the door says it will take at least 15 minutes for the honey toast, ours came out faster).

Arrived right at 1130pm

Walked in and asked the very nice girl at the front for all the good stuff. She smiles and says All the sweets is great. I bust out the yelp app and show her the stuff that caught my eye. 

Crepe Matcha Cake. Wowzers so light and fluffy. Loved it especially that drizzle !

Chocolate Mouse Bear looking thing was devoured in seconds,  especially by the kids. 

Honey Toast with ice Cream and brownie bits. This was decadent,  just absolutely delicious. I was saddened when we finished it. I wish we had arrived sooner to be able to order 2 of these bad boys. 

Finally the pistachio soy latte. Just amazing and my kind of latte. More places needs to make this wonderful treat of caffeine rush. 

Cozy vibe. With only one other small group in the place. We sat outside since it was perfect weather.

4853426,2016-02-23,0,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,Was recommended this place so decided to check it out. We got the passion fruit green tea and the matcha green tea crepe cake. The drink was really good and it was in a mason jar which automatically makes it a little cooler. The sizes of the drink could be a little bigger for the size but they were good. As for the crepe cake I had a little mixed feelings ordering the matcha green tea one since the matcha flavor tends to be a little stronger and bitter to me and not exactly what I wanted in the cake. After getting the cake it looked really good and they give you the sauce to pour over yourself. The cake was nice and soft and was surprisingly not sweet at all and the flavors were very mild and not over powering.

However, when we asked for it, the lady working said that they don't have that item. I showed her the picture on Yelp, and she said, ""That's only during the summer."" We decided to get the lava toast with sliced almonds on top, but they ran out of that too. The lady working had the worst customer service. We asked, ""Are there any other nuts available?"" She replied, ""No."" Then just stared at us. Her face looked so upset as if she did not want to be there.

Now about the lava toast, it was definitely very delicious. The inside was warm and the toast was soft. The ice cream was a nice touch of cold to the dessert. You can pour the condensed milk on top of the dessert yourself, which adds a fun interactive part to the dessert! This was probably the best part of the experience.

I also ordered the matcha crepe cake, it was a little bland and did not meet my expectations. They also have a matcha sauce that can be poured over the cake, which was pretty tasty, but was just an extra sauce of matcha. Could've been more tasty if it was chocolate? But that is just me.

The kitchen was VERY dirty. I sat at the back table and could see everything. They do use gloves, but the also touch EVERYTHING with those gloves. The floor had dirty towels in the middle where anyone could slip and trip over. They didn't clean up after each dessert was made. I asked for a small container and the lady handed me one after scooping Nutella. So my container had Nutella all over it. 

My experience here, could've been a little better, but the lava toast is what saved the amount of stars on my review.",_5r-uKDWIsNUMoDBnSU_mQ,0,0,3,LGSMhA4QliEWKEamdjT7Sg

It's retarded how much I've been here. It's always my go to spot after dinner or just to take someone for some coffee and desserts. I've been on a few dates here too, and brought family just to enjoy. Hell, last night I bumped into a friend there who mentioned that she only went to IS SWEET because I recommended it and always take great Snapchats. lmao. 

I just need to remember to always check in on yelp. I tend to forget because I go straight to the dessert and stare insanely at them. 

I've tried most, if not, all of their desserts. The tiramisu, the Hello Kitty strawberry cake, crème brule, bannofie pie, cheesecake, cute little bear face nutella mouse, the chocolate cake, and of course, their crepe cakes. I've also tried their waffle and their honey toast. 

Drink wise, I've had their caramel frappe, taro milk tea, mocha latte, and a couple others. 

I have not been disappointed! 
It's a very comfortable ambience. Rustic, yet trendy. The music is always mellow or some sort of acoustic covers of top charted songs. It has plenty of seats, but it does get busy. A lot of people like the place and the brick wall look is where people always try to sit at. Great background for your picture taking needs! The lighting is somewhat dimmed, but still a lot of lighting at night. During the day, the sunlight hugs the place nicely.  

The presentation of the desserts and drinks are adorable to where you HAVE to take a pictures! So bring your camera's or have juice on your phone to take a ton of pics. Its funny, even though I've taken a bunch of pics of the desserts I've had, if I get the same dessert again, I still take pics! lol.

Anyway, when Game (co-owner) is working and see's me, he already knows what I want. ""HEY!! Tiramisu?"" HAHAHAH! Love him! Every time I see someone walk in, I see him always smiling and welcoming anyone and everyone. Princess too! There's always great attitude in there!

Though things can get a bit pricey, you'll find that they really take their time on your choice of desserts to make them both taste delicious AND look beautiful. With that said, it does take a bit of time to get your order. In the times I've been here, they were pretty late at night, so finding seats haven't been a problem for me, and same with parking. My friends and I have gotten the sizzling brownie (BEST brownie I have ever had), a few of the customized honey toasts, and this chocolate volcano drink. All were delicious, filling, and made us feel guilty after. But what kind of good dessert won't make you feel that way after consumption?

Also, the decor here is cute! The vibe is relaxing, the decor on the walls and tables are colorful but subtle. I ended up staying for a couple of hours and just talked with friends in the times I've gone here. The staff were welcoming and helpful.

Ambiance: 4 - Super cute place. When people leave all the tables, you could probably study here. It doesn't seat many, though. There's probably 9 or 10 tables. 

Service: 4 - Super nice and super sweet. 

Food: 4 - Let's be honest, people come here for the crepe cake and the honey toast. Maybe the coffee. 

//crepe cake: People can say what they want about this crepe cake, I actually like the fact that the cake itself is not that sweet. That it is the sauce that gives the flavor. I mean, any more 'flavor' and I'd be having me some diabetes. My favorite is the green tea. Also, even though the ice cream is an extra charge, my expert opinion is for you to get it. It just makes it better. 

Drinks are not really the forte of IS SWEET. I don't like the boba or the coffee. But I did order the mango smoothie and loved it! It had the 3 things that a proper smoothie -should- have: It was fresh, it was made of real mango (not artificial, thank godd!!), and it gave me a brain freeze. Seriously, though, it was really good.

Get your cameras ready folks, you'll be fighting over the best aerial shot. Picture taking takes like 5+ minutes getting the best angle. Can we eat already? ""I need for my instagram...facebook...snapchat..."" Myself and another elite, ""I need it for Yelp!""

Goodness gracious, the hype is real. The matcha green tea crepe cake is pretty darn good. I really like the red velvet crepe cake as well. The chocolate cake was very rich and decadent, but a bit much. The waffle was just okay. I prefer Serenade's honey toast. 

After all that sugar, what better to wash it all down with another sugary drink? Not. My mistake was getting the iced caramel macchiato. I would have much rather been content with the complimentary self serve water. A common complaint at my table was why no mason jars? Our drinks didn't have the cool factor. 

Well, I think the duo running the show were just slammed. They are super sweet and friendly!",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,11,9,4,wXbZEkWfl-Jkzc9PTdDKBQ

Ordered the matcha crepe cake and the chocolate mousse for my daughter. Their presentation is super cute and I love the wooden little trays they use to serve the dessert. The crepe cake could use a bit more sweetness. The chocolate that covered the mousse was really hard & it took a while until my daughter finally got into the mousse & cake part of it. She was literally stabbing it and still won't break lol. My brother ordered the honey toast & it was deliciousssss!! I wish I ordered it. Def ordering it next time, but won't be ordering the crepe cake & the chocolate bear mousse anymore lol. It was ok as my first time. The highlight was the honey toast for sure :) 

Oh, def a plus for their fruit infused water that they offer for FREE. I hate when dessert places sell expensive ass water bottles that you can get for a dollar at a gas station.

Family wanted Boba after having lunch at Aloha Kitchen so we went to Tea Time in china town. Kids wanted honey toast and my daughter suggested IS SWEET - we all piled into the car and headed over. Once there, we noticed the sign that said no outside food or drink. I proceeded to order 3 honey toasts topped with ice cream. There were 6 of us and a small table outside with 2 chairs.  I went up to the counter, asked permission to bring our drinks in so we can eat our food at the table that sat 6. The guy said sure no problem. Now mind you, they DO NOT serve boba. After a few minutes the Asian guy came out and told us we had to leave our drinks out side or eat our food outside. Now, had there been seating for all of us, that would not have been a problem. I think what got me upset was the way he spoke to us, he was condescending - not rude but almost insulting. I told him to cancel my order and got my money back? As we left he said loudly ""have a wonderful day"" to which I responded, I will because I have my money back and you just lost 6 customers.",Yqx29epbz9AhNZqWfCOZfA,0,0,1,ZmvqwHDFCMr11vSpJQ3a9A

IS SWEET. The name intrigued me. What inspired them to call it that? Is it a catch phrase? Is it all sweet? Is it sweet to be loved by them? 

I give this place a 3.5, but because of the interior decor and customer service I'm rounding up to 4 stars. 

This is a great place to go to with a group of friends. 

Here is what we tried: 

chocolate cake - 2/5 - bleh. I've had my share of chocolate cake from a variety of bakeries and homemade, and this was bland. Disappointing. :-( 
green tea crepe cake - 4/5 
red velvet crepe cake - 4/5 

The most memorable were the crepe cakes. This is the first time I've heard of such a thing and it was better than the chocolate cake I had. The presentation of the desserts were creative. 

I didn't get to try the honey toast or drinks (b/c I have to watch my sugar intake) but my friends said they enjoyed it. 

What caught my eye here is the interior decor. The faux brick wall. I LOVE that shade of coral red. The different colored chairs and tables give it a whimsical feel. For some reason it feels like Alice in Wonderland. 

Another complaint my friends had: no mason jars. Not a deal breaker, but still. 

Great service. We asked for iced water and they immediately refilled the complimentary water dispenser. They happily took our group photos for us. I will be back to try their other drinks.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,7,6,4,c0wqdmSgljel1cS8sMueNg

On a real note though the coffee here is actually really good. I ended up getting the hot white mocha. Soooooo good and it's the right amount of sweet which just leaves you wanting more. My friend ended up with an iced matcha milk tea which she had no complaints about too. 

The interior of the place is very cutesy and photogenic. They have a red brick wall which seat 6 people. and other 2-3 seater tables scattered around. I came here on a monday afternoon and it was pretty empty making it a great place to study.

The menu they have seems pretty extensive enough to where I'm sure you'll find something you like caffeinated or not.

5174394,2017-11-10,6,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,"I'm sad as I write this review because this place was one of my favorite places to get drinks in Vegas but it is not anymore. My recent visit was such a disappointment!

I liked getting Thai Tea and other flavored teas here. Prices were reasonable. I guess you can say a little overpriced but most of the drinks at any cafe these days costs a bit more than franchised coffee shops like Starbucks and Coffee Bean. Nevertheless, I think I have to say goodbye to Is Sweet.

My boyfriend and I walked in after eating pho next door and there was only only 3 other people at the cafe. They took forever to order but yeah I ordered as soon as they were done. My order was simple; Thai Tea and Taro Frappe.

I waited and waited. As I see the time and the time printed on my receipt, it has been 12 minutes since. Theres 2 people working but come on. Making those 2 drinks shouldnt take more than 5 minutes. We finally received out drinks after 17 minutes of ridiculous wait and my boyfriend's so called Taro Frappe was very bland and tasteless. I dont know what Taro powder they use but it tasted nothing but just milk. To add, it wasnt sweet either. I asked them to make it sweeter and they did. Did it make it sweet? Not really. Maybe a tiny bit. It wasnt the flavor he or I was looking for in a typical Taro Frappe.

My Thai Tea was just as good as before. But I'm lactose intolerant so I couldnt drink much because I didnt have any lactaid with me. Should have asked for soymilk instead but I totally forgot they carry them. If you are lactose like me, please substitute with soy. They do charge extra for it but at least it will be worth to do so.

Tables were somewhat dirty. It wasnt wiped completely. I dont think they ever come out and clean the tables. I always see them busy behind the bar and I dont know whats keeping them so busy. My drinks came out way too late and I wasnt too satisfied with it.

Cutesy interior and tables & chairs are unique. However, if they dont speed up preparing your drinks, they will irritate other customers too. Perhaps hire more workers if they take THAT long making them. 

Parking is plenty and it is located in not-so-busy plaza so dont need to worry about that. They do have a restroom and it is clean.",_VD870pQZJPqcGd07vxMsg,10,7,3,XjsfUFZC5BCK8S0z7c-g4g

I pulled up and seen tables and chairs outside with warm lights creating like a night garden appearance. Inside it looks even more cuter like a vintage, tea party type of look. It's great for friends to hang out and especially couples to go on dates! My friends and I decided to sit outside because they were very busy at night on a Friday night around 8/9pm. It's still cool out so it was a great place to drink tea and eat some honey toast! 

They have the 10% off per drink check-in deal so don't for get to do that if you buy a drink! My friends and I ordered tea, Thai Tea, Honeydew, and a type of Lemon tea (I forgot the actual name), and we ordered a Honey Toast with Vanilla ice-cream, bananas, and strawberries. The total came out to about $24. It is pricey because of the Honey Toast, you pay by the toppings. Base price for the Honey Toast is $5 and whatever toppings you want you get charged for it. Ex. 1 scoop of vanilla ice-cream is $1.50 or condensed milk drizzled on top of your Toast is $0.75 charge. Probably that's the only down side to this place is the topping price because the quantity given is not as much. The employee's are nice, my first time they took out a menu for me to look at and didn't rush me. They deliver the dessert to wherever you're sitting at and they bus your table when you leave.

Located in back of the Spring Mountain plaza housing Viet Noodle IS SWEET has received a fair bit of praise ever since opening doors in the middle of 2015, and with several desserts served to compliment a broad-ranging menu of coffee and teas the cozy spot shows well for an Locals-only sort of spot, though prices are often comparable to the likes of Bouchon on Jean-Philippe.

Open late and offering free WiFi, the staff exceedingly pleasant if not particularly pressed for pace, those visiting IS SWEET are likely to be tempted by several cute confections in addition to honey toast and waffles made-to-order, the quoted preparation time of fifteen minutes proving a low-ball estimate as a lone barrista and man in the kitchen struggled with orders despite only a half-dozen total guests.

Levied a tab of $25.57 for four desserts and tap water before adding a tip, a tasting of IS SWEET began with a small slice of British favorite Banoffie Pie, the flavor of fruit largely overwhelming the toffee amidst the creamy base as drizzles of chocolate and caramel further compromised the experience, a block of honey toast proving far better crafted with a base price of $4.00 boosted by a $1.00 dollop of Vanilla pudding plus $1.25 for ice cream without which the toasted bread would seem to be a waste.

Taking two more treats for home, the Nutella Mousse apparently carrying a premium entirely as a result of the artistry involved, suffice it to say that at a cost of $6 the light dessert was most certainly not worth a buck-fifty a bite, the far better taste and value found in a 'coffee cake' that defied convention, the hefty notes of cinnamon smoothed by creamy frosting while honey glazed nuts added  texture and finesse traditionally reserved to fine-dining and plated sweets.

***Unfortunately a bit too precious for its own good, even the honey toast which seems like a good deal turning out to be a bit pricey when accounting for portion after adding ice cream, IS SWEET is perhaps best visited with a group intent on sharing and sampling, though smallish portions may even make that a stretch.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,8,3,-slrMTMeBRoTeVeDDYoIzA

Environment: The interior is on par with many other cute coffee/ dessert shops in Vegas, complete with bright colors, an assortment of seating, and an open layout.

Food: I have tried their green tea layered cake, honey toast, as well as their mango iced tea and all were light and fresh.

The food is light and comfortable and the drinks would be great to sip on while studying late at night.

Service: Cashiers are friendly and personable. Additionally, sometimes the seating areas can be covered in dirty dishes from previous customers, however the staff is rather quick at bussing and cleaning the tables so that you are never stuck waiting for your favorite seat.

I have wanted to try this place for sometime, and it was worth the wait. I shared the red velvet crepe cake, tiramusi, and the bear shape mousse dessert. All were very decadent, and required some skill to make. I pick the tiramusu as my favorite. It was light, but you could still get the coffee flavor. Overall, all were great bakes! I expected the prices, $4 to $6.50 for artistry. The decor was fun, and a cozy space to enjoy our desserts. 
I want to take away 1/2 a star but that is not possible. I take one away because the lady behind the counter forgot my husband's coffee, and we waited to see if she remembered.

I did order their Thai lemon iced tea a couple times over to-go and found that it didn't taste as good when drinking it inside...in their cute litter mason jar...it tasted a little bland and watered down both times.

The best way I can explain this judgment is through the phrase ""all talk, no bite."" Is Sweet offers a beautiful display of their cake, topped with chocolate drizzle and an arrangement of strawberries and oranges to the side. As for the taste, This place lives up to its name. Is SWEET. It is SWEET, and I think on the more extreme side of the spectrum. 

What hit me was the texture of the whipped cream. Not fluffy, smooth, but rather patchy. In my opinion, the sauce given to you did nothing to add to the dessert's flavor profiles, but rather gives way to more artificial sugars and sugar overloads. Rather than a nice delicate touch to compliment a crepe cakes delicate texture, I was overloaded with just too much.

It's a very open and spacious layout, and having the large glass windows letting in daylight is a huge plus. It's usually not too busy here during the day, which I like. It gets a little busier at night, but I've always been able to find a table. I've tried their iced café latte, iced matcha milk tea, iced sesame milk tea, and green tea crepe cake. I've liked the matcha and sesame milk teas, but the latte wasn't really anything out of the ordinary. Because the matcha is powder based, it is a bit grainy as you drink it, and same with the sesame too with a bit more sweetness. Their green tea crepe cake was okay. If you've ever had Lady M's crepe cake, you'll think this one doesn't quite come close. The flavor isn't too bad, but more so the texture is a bit off. The crepe part of the cake has a hint of almost a playdoh texture...and just the green color of it isn't so much a matcha green, but a pine green food coloring. I probably wouldn't get the green tea crepe cake again, but am willing to try other desserts on the menu.

Last time I was here, I was excited to try their Green Tea crepe cake since I'm a huge green tea/matcha fan! But sadly I was disappointed for my specific crepe cake barely had any Green Tea flavor at all in it - it just tasted like whipped cream. The green tea sauce was the only reason I finished it but without it, it would've just tasted like a bland whipped cream cake. 

They have a variety of other sweets as well including cheesecake, strawberry cake, tiramisu, banoffee, chocolate cake, and etc. 

Their drinks are also just average, I usually get the matcha latte or frappe. I asked if I could have it with almond milk but their only other substitute is Soy milk.

Raspberry lemon iced tea tasted like overly steeped lemon ice tea with no raspberry to be found. Nonetheless, it was refreshing after the heat and sweet. Served in a cute mason jar, of course. 

The green tea crepe cake came with green tea sauce, a stripe of blueberry syrup, and blueberries. The ice cream was extra. This was my first time having crepe cake and it was underwhelming. There was no green tea flavor and the crepes became gummy with the equally bland whipped cream between each layer. The green tea sauce did have good green tea flavor with no sweetness. This dish was edible because of the sweetness from the ice cream and blueberry syrup. And even then, the ice cream was icy in the middle. All this mediocrity was presented beautifully on a wooden paddle. 

The ambience is what saved this cafe, really. It is why I would come here again if I was in the area. Sure, the food wasn't great, the colorful decor was a bit run-down and verging on being tacky, and I was greeted by a random household trash can outside entrance. There was, however, good natural light and airflow, greenery I could look at outside, plenty of electric outlets for studying, clean bathrooms, great music, and beautifully presented food.

DESSERT
We ordered the green tea crepe cake and the creme brulee to share. Both were so delicious. I especially enjoyed the green tea crepe cake because it was very light and not sweet, which I prefer. 

DRINK
The espresso machine was broken at the time so no coffee :(. But we ordered a pot of rose green tea to share and it was pretty standard. Good taste, not overpowering with floral scent but maybe too mild. Their lychee drink was refreshing, albeit a little sweet for me.

PRICE POINT
I would say this place is a little pricey for the amount you get, especially for the tea. The teas are pretty expensive when they don't taste as such. The desserts obviously had a lot of care put into them so I wouldn't mind splurging every once in a while. It also helped that we went during the grand opening so our order was 30% off.

AMBIENCE & LOCATION
The decor is very cutesy and comfortable, so you'll probably be seeing a lot of aerial photos on instagram. The place is small so it can't fit a lot of people, though there is a work table that fits 6. Everything about this place is adorable and it seems like your neighborhood cafe you would find somewhere more pedestrian-friendly than Vegas. Nice little patio outside and ample parking. Location is great -- not too difficult to find but just enough privacy. 

SERVICE
The owners are friendly and are quick to answer any questions. They don't mind if you chill and use their wifi to get work done! I can see this being a good study spot (although it does close a little early).

$22.32 got me a nutella frappé, a chocolate mousse cake, and a slice of strawberry cake.  

The nutella frappe was one of the best shakes/drinks I've ever had.  The consistency was so smooth and creamy.  The presentation was gorgeous in a clear plastic glass with chocolate syrup artistically drizzled down the slides and topped with a generous dollop of whipped cream.  The drink was not too sweet but rich and decadent.  I was in chocolatey heaven.  I highly recommend this drink! 

The chocolate mousse cake is shaped like an adorable little bear's head and It was so pretty I was hesitant to eat it.  Cracking the milk chocolate exterior revealed and rich and satisfying chocolate mousse atop a moist and chocolately disk of cake. It was absolutely delightful.  

The strawberry cake was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  It was absolutely gorgeous with it's piped decorations, pocky sticks, and tiny chocolate hello kitty head.  The pink cake was layered with the most delicious cream filling and fresh strawberries.  It's like the best strawberry shortcake ever invented.  I wish I could eat one of these every day.

Presentation is really nice and I was pleased with the service. The guy informed me of some specials and that's when I remembered they had crepes. 

Crepes - two flavor: vanilla and green tea. I did get the green tea and one of my friends got the vanilla but I preferred the vanilla in the end. Green tea is a hit or miss for me sometimes depending on what it is. 

There's a lot of drink choices that I had to take more than a few minutes to decide. Ended up with mango fruit smoothie but probably would not get that again.

Beware that when you order honey toast, everything you add that isn't the toast or honey is an addition of $1 or more! 

Also I paid 4 bucks for a lemonade.   

For 2 of us 2 desserts and 2 drinks cost more that dinner itself that night!  Over $30!

The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because of the poor customer service I encountered the other day. I ordered a honey toast with two toppings and I only got a honey toast with one scoop of strawberry ice cream, which isn't what I ordered. Right away when I got my order and noticed, I told the girl who took my order that this wasn't what I ordered. She acted very unapologetic and said ""you were already charged for this, if you want the extra toppings you have to pay (x) dollars"". I checked my receipt to see what I was charged for and it didn't even say. After this she just walked away. In the end I sat there disappointed and sad with my friend while eating an unsatisfactory honey toast.
Anyways. This is the first time that I encountered bad service here and I think it may be because they're new employees who didn't start out with the business. I'll still be going back to Is Sweet but I hope that the customer service improves and that encounters like that don't happen ever again.",ltfuWL22zbS4ncIk5TqQ6Q,1,0,3,ldWypv9j9PPYp9OoXsc6Fg

You can go a bit crazy with all the toppings they offer but I'm a simple gal and I went basic with Nutella and vanilla ice cream. This thing was huge.

The place is very decorative, they a red brick wall with some frames and also some shelving work with some nice designs hanging.  They have your standard table but they also have a mini table which felt like I was having tea and a playhouse. 

On to the food.
We ordered a taro flavored frappe and it tasted ok. Nothing really special about it so we give that one 3/5.
However,
We also ordered a honey toast with ice cream and bananas and that was so delicious! The bread was perfectly baked, ice cream was firm and creamy, and the bananas were flavorful. They also added some whip cream on the side which made the presentation appealing. We give this one a 5/5. 

The only thing they could work on is possibly speeding up the foos making process, maybe have some more workers during night shift so that one person is not making all the food! It took a while for our honey toast to be ready!

In fact, we liked it so much that we have been here twice in the past week! Its a cute dessert cafe with a hip vibe. Sort of feels like you are somewhere in LA while you are here. So far, I have tried 3 items from their menu:

-Strawberry Cheesecake Shaved Ice: the shaved ice was very light and not too sugary. However, it also came with a generous amount of vanilla ice cream, cheesecake bites and strawberries. This one is definitely my favorite!

-Matcha Crepe Cake: never had a crepe cake before, but I did like the layers of the cake and how it was so light that you don't feel as guilty eating it! I would have preferred the matcha sauce to be a little more tasty, but overall I liked it.

-Honey Toast: haven't had this one for years and it was very good! I definitely feel guilty eating this one, but how can you resist warm toasted bread with honey, ice cream and condensed milk?

Loved the nice presentation of all their desserts and each one is big enough to share between 2 people. Don't expect fast service because it will take them a while to bring out your order.
