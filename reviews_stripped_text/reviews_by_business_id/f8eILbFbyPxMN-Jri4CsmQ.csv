Ive been there a handful of times to entertain clients that were staying at the palms which in turn made me look bad. My first experience wasnt all that bad, the food was ok but for the price my expectations were a little higher. The last time I went, there was a hiccup with my bill and some extra items charged so I asked to speak with management.  I watched the server go to the bar and talk to some guy that was standing there with a few women. As im watching them all take shots im wondering to myself how long im going to have to sit here and wait. To my surprise the guy standing at the bar taking shots was the manager! Wow. Classy!! He slugged over with what seemed to be a carefree attitude as if I interrupted and inconveinced him. All that was said was."" We'll take care of it"" they took off one drink and sent over a complimentary drink as if giving me alcohol was going to fix it.. pathetic.! All in all very poor management, rude, and seems as if they dont take their position seriously.  I would not recommend going at all! Youll get treated better by prison gaurds",BuPih71V_cZt2vGpgNyRwQ,2,0,1,wZTRL_tkaPD3zhnzr6sUbA
211268,2013-05-13,0,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,I was at Heraea this past weekend having a getaway with my boyfriend and we ate here and watched the playoff for NBA ..I loved it the drinks were great the food was. amazing the ppl and staff were very friendly and I was even able to bet without leaving my seat. I loved it that was the first bet I ever placed before and it made watching the game with my boyfriend even more enjoyable. I will definitely be back next tome,toPo2venrFFeWnCWA5fDUg,0,0,5,PjkcjjRVNzt_Cb_qJSt8YQ
914394,2013-09-21,1,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,It is one of the best sports bars I have been to to date I love the food all of the people especially they have the best Waitress in life and her name is Janezza. She makes you feel like you're not even in a sports bar that you're in a fine dining restaurant.,Euei9XPcy0rt5CInrAuTjw,0,0,5,_tyumqUv-RhuvgopZUO-OQ

If they were going for over-priced ,poorly thought out selections on a pseudo fashionable menu with small portions ; crappily prepared they hit the nail on the head.

1603028,2013-04-01,0,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,"We had tickets to see Bill Maher who was performing at the Palms Hotel.  We walked all around the hotel and we weren't coming up with a place to eat.  All we wanted to do was grab a quick bite and some drinks.  One of the hotel staff recommended Heraea, so we tried it.  On a whole the food and service was up to par and generally was served quickly and correctly. 

I'm not giving this review 5 stars because it was really nuts in there when we were there trying to have a relaxed bite.  March Madness was in full swing and patrons were really into cheering loudly and clapping hands, high fiving etc. in response to which game on what TV they were cheering for.  It was almost competitive when it came to who could yell louder.  That's hard on your nerves when you are trying to have a relaxed dinner. 

Take note, have no doubt, this is a sports bar and fans will yell and cheer when their teams are doing good and when their teams are doing poorly.",hzvS8hyttyhwDBWOD0_zZQ,0,0,4,-b-8k8VkRUg5jJilIS6xMg

2155938,2013-06-22,2,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,"So I have to say that I ate here during a lunch break at an event I was attending and they seemed completely overwhelmed by the sudden influx of people. So perhaps this place is much better under different circumstances.

They stopped serving anything except a salad or a chicken salad sandwich - to save time with the big group and we could choose from water or soda - and the soda was actually in a can. 

So like I said, this may have been a special situation - from the photos an and other reviews they obviously USUALLY serve more than that - but I have to say, most likely .. i won't be back. 

The servers seemed totally clueless and several times they just ignored us and hurried by when we were waving at them.

A really lame experience. In Vegas there are SOOOO many great meals to be had that I felt like I had cheated myself out of the opportunity for one.",MWuVbyBgP4vD24Rc7UH5xw,5,2,2,x4rZruJctrzYPzUGqrrtvg

For being located off the strip at the Palms Casino, this new venue had state of the art sound and an awesome high definition TV/projecter setup. Many local people were here to party with the tourist and view the games. I ordered some beers and loved the Siracha flavored buffalo wings. I will definitely try to come here for a power lunch or dinner to test out the other food!",RSLTG7N0wYJhRTW5CGEm5Q,0,0,5,7xQAVDHkzmGrcsqqfIYtOg
2705038,2013-09-08,0,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,Very disappointed.... We had high expectations had rented the skybox suite and other than semi decent service (all men by the way) the food was edible at best and the specialty cocktails were mostly undrinkable. I didn't think it was possible to under deliver this much. If you come to eat stick to the appetizers. The breakfast burrito might be the worst one I've ever had.,usK-9Abx_n9MwdaV4pR2MA,0,0,1,rUrJh0dSKQJ3S2kvjWd7-w

So we walked over to the Palms Casino starving. With 7 girls it was hard to find a place that had something we could all enjoy. Some of us are vegetarians,  one pescetarian, and the rest omnivores. This place had a great variety. We ordered a Corpse Reviver #2 which wasn't on the menu, but they made it, and it was great. The tuna taretare tacos seemed to be the favorite. And the sports vibe wasn't too overwhelming.",FdwLluGuUAnbDHxgRuOlRQ,0,0,4,Cc1rRys-gDESfNftwFnHzA

Had the NY strip, can't really make it any better. Had this waiter named Zaben or Zabin, and he couldn't have been more accommodating.

3703780,2013-05-02,0,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,"Heraea was the next stop... The decor was superb, with about 7 flat screen TV plastered on the wall, and with nice plush lounges (tables were available as well). I consider Heraea to be a high end sports bar ,with high end food. As we sat down and looked over the menu we decided to keep it simple and just order off the appetizer menu. We chose the: Crab & Spinach Dip (Jumbo Crab, Aged Cheddar with Corn Chips), Little Kobe Burgers, Tuna Tarare (with mango salsa and avocado mousse), and of course a few drinks. As we waited for our appetizers to arrive our server brings out bread with this green dipping sauce. I must say we waited for some time for our appetizers to arrive (I mean they're just appetizers). After about 30 minutes or so our food finally arrives! I was highly disappointed in the crab & spinach dip! I think they forgot to add in the ""Jumbo Crab"" because all you can taste is the spinach and cheddar. Any who, on to the next appetizer. My Tuna Tartare Tacos were tiny! It was literally a fried taro chip bent like a taco. It was one bite and it came with 4. I had to send it back because my lips were tingling up a bit and my throat was really itchy (thanks to the avocado mousse). The only thing that was delicious were our drinks and the Kobe Burgers. Overall, if you're looking for a place to watch some sports and have a few drinks then Heraea is the spot to be!",CNKS9lCDbQVA2F-w3__XIQ,0,0,4,-USG1Au1CyO7PqIBTt398A

I figured this place would be a great treat for my husband. The Raiders/Broncos game was on and we felt like this place made the football game feel like an event no one on earth should miss. During commercial breaks the DJ was blasting body pumping jams it felt like I was in a nightclub, then as a oon as the commercial break was over the music stopped and the game was turned back up. You name it, we had it! Appetizers, burgers, salads, wings. All was yummy!

Just awesome overall experience. Our colorful and fun waiter Patrick was great and attentive. I wished we could go back again the next day! Groupon scored with this one !",6w14RRJ11VBXwgjA9L88Sw,0,0,5,pNmR6qKPXqd70yyROvyB4Q

4807117,2013-08-12,2,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,"After seeing the ads & billboards my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out. 

Expectation prior to going in based on ads: I expected a female friendly sports bar with hot female servers dressed in sports wear and awesome STK quality food. 
 
Atmosphere: Didn't hit the expectation. It is actually feels like you are just sitting in a regular sports book. I expected a real restaurant...
Service: Decent. Although, the servers weren't sexy females like the ads suggest. Instead, I was served by a male in suspenders. 
Food: 
-Pretzel Hot Dogs: Where is the pretzel? I don't know... My dogs were wrapped in a super dry croissant type bread. The ones I make at the house for $2 are WAY better and don't taste re-heated. 
- Truffle Sliders: Tasty, but I expected more than two sliders for $15. 
- Fried Green Beans: I liked the chili sauce and they tasted good. 

Saddest Part?? My coffee was stale... I think they served me coffee from the AM shift or something... I couldn't even drink it. 

Overall Feeling???? The most disappointing $60 I ever spent! Small portion sizes at High prices. Skippppp It unless you are only going there to watch a game.",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,3,2,2,RRSSTW2H1s7miXCZFJZZrg
4926293,2013-05-15,1,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,"This place has gone so downhill since I last went.  We went here for a big birthday party where we were charged per head.  We gave them a headcount but some extra friends showed up to say happy birthday and get drinks from the bar.  They didn't even eat or sit at our tables and the server charged us extra for them for standing around our table or sitting down to take photos.  The service was horrible when we tried to argue with them about this.

The crowd during dinner seemed okay but around 10pm, this place is beyond ghetto.  Most of our huge group went into the casino to wait for my gf and I as we tried to figure out the bill with the server and we were harassed by a ton of guys in the most disrespectful manner.  It was just a gross place.

Ex: today Syracuse played at 11:30 am and UNLV at noon (local team) and they had the tvs on a game from two days ago and Michael Jordan's past history. Wasn't till 1:00 they finally changed them.  March Madness is upon us and after today, why would I want to chance them playing the games and spending $8 for beer to watch Michael Jordan play? The ambiance is amazing but the tvs need to be current for us ladies and men who are also spending money. PLUS they haven't had Cantor Gaming to place bets and they are suppose to have them.

5384255,2013-08-24,2,f8eILbFbyPxMN-Jri4CsmQ,"We stopped here twice on our recent Vegas trip. Once for lunch and once just for drinks and a snack. On both visits, we took advantage of the Beautiful Vegas weather and ate on the Patio. Yes, being from Wisconsin, 112 degrees is beautiful to me!

For lunch I had the Blackened Fish Tacos with Fresh Corn Tortillas, Cilantro Slaw, Tomatillo Salsa and Lime. The fish was moist and tender with a great, spicy, crunchy crust. the other components of the dish added a ton of well balanced flavor. Diane had the Breakfast Burrito which had Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Cheddar, Onion and Tomato inside a Flour Tortilla. I stole a couple bites and it was pretty good. I did like her side salad better than my fries.

On our second visit we shared a very good order of Potato Skins. More than enough for two, they were loaded with Cheese, Bacon, Creme Fraiche and Scallions.

We liked our drinks so much we ordered the same ones on both days. I had the Cinn City Margarita and Diane had the Perfect Pear. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. We entered the Patio from the pool, so I can't really address the accessibility of the restaurant itself. I'll leave that for the next visit!",e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,2,3,4,8BsMDnsRQOk3kUtXYLp-3w
