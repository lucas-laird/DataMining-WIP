462180,2014-07-06,0,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"Saturday night (6/29/14), right before dinner rush.

After reading the reviews, I was excited to try Yusho.  The restaurant is right at the front of the Monte Carlo and they seated us adjacent to the main window, overlooking the strip. The server was friendly and told us about the tapas menu yet failed to warn us of just how small the portions were.  The problem is that at other places, tapas are usually priced accordingly.  At Yusho however, the prices are way out of proportion to the size and, unfortunately, the taste of the food.

The drink menu looked interesting so I tried the Last Word ($13), which is a mixture of gin, green chartreuse, maraschino, lime and egg whites. The flavor was ok but there was more egg white foam than liquid in the glass and I didn't taste any gin at all.  We also tried a Negroni which did have a strong taste of Campari ($13). However, similar to what they did with the previous cocktail, there was so much ice jammed into the glass that there were only a few sips of liquor.

We started with the house pickles ($9) and assorted kimchi ($7).  The taste of the kimchi was interesting but there wasn't much there to eat. We had one order of the Tiger shrimp which came in a small bowel containing a few shrimp and cucumber pieces with a tangy vinegar coating ($9).  We ordered one of the specials which was an ear of corn, broken into two pieces and smothered in a spicy miso sauce ($7).  The taste of the sauce was great but the corn was a bit waterlogged and mushy.  Next came the duck breast which consistent of one skewer holding four small pieces of bland duck meat wrapped around mushrooms ($12). We ordered two cod buns ($16 for two) and two pork buns ($16 for two). The meat in both tasted all right however the mix of ingredients that they threw in with it seemed like a desperate attempt to create something different by throwing in anything on hand rather then creating a unified concept of flavors that meshed together. The portions are so small however and you are so hungry throughout the experience that you will eat anything they bring to the table. Last to come was the crab fried rice ($24) and the chicken drummies with red miso sauce ($9).  The fried rice tasted ok but there was only enough to fill the small miso soup bowl that it came in. The chicken dish was the most substantial of the night with several flat medallions of chicken meat with a red dipping sauce.  We skipped dessert.

All in all, some of the dishes tasted ok but nothing had a wow factor. Certainly nothing to demand the exorbitant prices for what you actually received.  I can't see this place staying at the Monte Carlo for very long if nothing changes.  I would recommend skipping Yusho and heading right next door to the Dragon Noodle Co. or Andre's for a real meal.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,2,0,2,a0sOy8uklUwlNvdXEwGE3A

For charging such exorbitant prices, you'd think that they would atleast have decent furniture.

The servers were a bit more attentive this time around, so some improvement.  Hosts were on point with greeting, and the patio seems cool. No table visits by a manager or chef, and it was still slow for mid week. But again it is the Monte carlo, and in the middle of a reconstruction. 

As for the food it was better all around but still not comparable to raku and fukumimi.  And again the hygiene standard of the cooks, I know they are union but that is a manager issue to enforce.

We started out with the shrimp/pork shumai. While it had potential to be decent it was badly undercooked. Also, they don't even have simple Asian condiments on the table like soy sauce or hot chili sauce for the shumai. 

Next we had the ramen. My wife's ramen was horrendous. The noodles were undercooked, and the flavor was like Mac and cheese with a little bit of spicy pepper. Furthermore, it was served with no broth as it was apparently designed...what a lousy design! My ramen had broth at least. But the taste had no depth or flavor or anything resembling a decent tasting ramen. What can I say, totally unacceptable. 

We stopped eating after a couple slurps and sampling the noodles. The waiter asked if anything was wrong so I spelled it out. He at least removed the shumai from the bill.

It wasn't crispy or flavorful, though it did come with a very decent sauce.  It also made us full because the other portions were small.  The lamb skewer was good, and so was the crab fried rice.

The decor was very nice and the staff knowledge was adequate, not excellent but adequate. Although, admittedly, our server had not tried the specials for the evening or even seen then except for what had been order already. 

For a restaurant on the strip, the restaurant was surprisingly empty. Probably due to the food quality. Here was the major disappointment. 

We ordered a few items from each section: 

Yellow label/Kikusui Fubaguchi was good. Flavorful and delicious but overpriced at $20 for 200 ml. 
Tuna- alright, lacked flavor, quality of tuna was poor. Pine nuts didn't seem to fit in. 

Bok choy- biggest disappointment of the evening. Tofu was good, beets had nice flavor but the dressing was terrible. Lacked flavor or seasoning. 

LoganPOSERramen (posing as ramen). Tasting like American or French broth with a little dashi added. Terrible flavor. If you are searching for authentic, go elsewhere. 

Caramelized kimchi- brown with no actual caramelization. Decent flavor. 

Buns:
Charred eggplant- the plumb sauce overpowered the eggplant. Bun itself had nice texture, but could only taste the plumb sauce. 

Chub sausage- probably the best of the buns, but not terrific. Red pepper coulis is more French than Asian. 

Pork shoulder- sauce again overbearing and under seasoned. Big disappointment.

Doughnuts- dense and doughy. Good flavor, but texture was lacking. The Japanese sweet potato purée was flavorful but seemed to have been made in advance as it was starchy and dense. 

There were also sever opportunities for an upswell by the staff which were missed. For example bottled water in addition to our sake or another sake after we were finished with out first. A couple of the staff asked if we wanted to keep the container but no one asked if we wanted another. 

Overall, probably the worst dining experience I have had on the strip. Service was good, knowledgable and friendly with great spiels of the food when dropped 
but the server should not describe it as well and the food did not hold up to its descriptions.

The tofu in the ramen had an almost pickled flavor. Really interesting on it's own, nearly transcendent with the rest of the soup.

My wife had a bunch of meat (i don't really remember what) but she was going on about it as much as I was going on about mine. Two very happy people.

 The host team needs to get it together considering that the restaurant was half empty. They sent us to a table that was already seated and we were then led by the host to another table. Not a big deal, but I'm writing about it 5 days later so it kind of stuck out in the oddest way.

The 2x fried chicken was delicious and was a huge portion of 5 pieces of chicken breast. Lamb swears were tender with a hint of flame on them. We also tried the rib eye special and it was amazing. Can't even describe the spices but it was a flavor explosion. We went on to try the espresso soft serve and donuts. I don't do well with dairy but I really had to try the soft serve.

I unfortunately didn't really like it, as it was again, more on the meaty side and had a little off-taste to me. I did however liked the egg - soft boiled but not runny. 

I was able to get a taste of my friend's curry ramen. It was more of a sweeter curry but still having a mild kick, which I liked! The broth is more creamier, and if I were to come here again I would probably give the curry ramen bowl a try. (She also complained about having the size of her pork extremely small!)

Coming from SF/Bay Area, we have had our share of ramen and I'd say we're pretty good critics at it! Aside from the oddly small servings of meat, I would say ramen portions in general are also smaller here than the typical bowl. We were all pretty full, but left wishing there was more. Service was friendly and great, no problems there. The price is a bit high ($16-17 for a bowl), especially for the portions, but that price seems normal for it being in Vegas, let alone on the strip. I'd say give it a try if you're near and needing that ramen/noodle soup fix, whether it be to help a hangover or simply have some soothing comfort food!",Tbyoeb3vjli4Hjc6uqGKZA,2,1,3,3wKqDwAuTXowreqgnk1ouQ

I was originally really excited to see this place, since I could eat ramen (real, authentic ramen) every day.  However, the ramen here is ABYSMAL.  I started with the Logan Poser ramen, and after one bite, I couldn't bring myself to eat any more of it.  I can't even fully explain what was wrong with it.  The broth was just...bad.  The only reason this place gets two stars instead of one is because of our fantastic waitress.  She came over and noticed that I hadn't eaten any of the ramen, and offered to replace it with a different type.  I believe I replaced it with the Kuro, which was also just....ugh, terrible.  For what it's worth, the boyfriend happily ate his ramen and didn't see any issues with it, but I couldn't choke down the second bowl either.  For both bowls, the broth was just inauthentic and had a really bad aftertaste.  Our waitress checked on us, and I told her that I wasn't really into the second type either.  I of course didn't expect her to replace a second bowl, so I just decided to grab a quick bite later elsewhere.  Our waitress was very sweet and apologetic, and I felt awful for wasting the second bowl.  Overall, I can't imagine a reason that I'd ever come back here, but I will say that they had fantastic customer service, and kudos again to our understanding, friendly waitress!",LAn2cS9zOX54OPtj8W97XQ,1,1,2,CZyHFLSTPZ8fNuUK0ZeoOg

The service was great and the managers are awesome and really passionate. 

We had the pleasure of having almost the entire menu sent out for us to try. But unfortunately I didn't get a picture of everything seeing as we were eating too quickly. 

The food was good but personally I wasn't wow'd by a lot of it. There are a lot of similar underlying taste they use for a lot of dishes such as yuzu. Also, I don't really care for anything heavily salted and I felt like a lot of dishes were pretty salty. 

Cocktails were great! I definitely recommend trying them all.

All in all, it was good. But not what I was expecting. Although I might have to come back and check it out again on my own.

**READ MORE for further descriptions -

There were only a few items I really wanted to try from the menu - the octopus, the duck leg, the loganposer ramen, the squid griddle cake (okonomiyaki), and the crab fried rice. But I'll try my best to remember what we had... 

First they brought out kim chee and some pickled veggies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-japanese-grill-and-noodle-house-las-vegas-2?select=LXlVET7G4H2OUpP7FS_FHw#LXlVET7G4H2OUpP7FS_FHw) Both were great, I really liked the pickled veggies. The cucumbers in the pickled veggies were my favorite but there was also carrots and lotus root.

The tempura was good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-japanese-grill-and-noodle-house-las-vegas-2?select=8wLzSGfApECSx-Fqpaopuw#8wLzSGfApECSx-Fqpaopuw) the peppers were my favorite from that dish.

Then we had some Aged New York Steak wrapped in nori (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-japanese-grill-and-noodle-house-las-vegas-2?select=-jNsQFFbGfOu7VWLHTl94A#-jNsQFFbGfOu7VWLHTl94A) which I thought I would have enjoyed more, but it was a little too salty for me.

They also brought all of the ramens for us to try but I only got to taste of two of the three. I tried the Logan Poser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-japanese-grill-and-noodle-house-las-vegas-2?select=acJY9zERNMQDs4JTWrz8iQ#acJY9zERNMQDs4JTWrz8iQ) and the Maitake Mushroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-japanese-grill-and-noodle-house-las-vegas-2?select=K6cI5LaSC2-SLzvkTRWAXw#K6cI5LaSC2-SLzvkTRWAXw). The Logan Poser was really good I believe the meat was Pork Shoulder and the Maitake Mushroom was I think more of a miso like broth but again a little too salty for me.

Then we had several duck dishes. We had duck breast wrapped around mushrooms served on skewers and those were AMAZING. We also had the duck leg with steamed bun. The duck leg was not what I had expected. It was sweetened and tasted a lot like char siu to me. 

We also had the double fried chicken with nori on it. It was good but nothing too special. 

The okonomiyaki or the squid griddle cake was DELICIOUS! Have to try, if you're down for squid.

One of our last dishes was the octopus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-japanese-grill-and-noodle-house-las-vegas-2?select=w5lwFzOaweG324X5zU6uww#w5lwFzOaweG324X5zU6uww). It was good a little spicy and the sauce too heavy for my liking. But the enoki mushrooms were perfect and so were the green beans. 

Lastly we had an expresso ice cream with housemade pop rocks drizzled with fernet caramel? Pretty good.",q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw,3,2,3,ak91HilNneGyW8RjYmGA2g

Everything was new to me.

The grilled octopus was really good, had nice texture with egg yolk.

Okonomiyaki-like (but not really) pancake was rather dry and didn't like it.

Maitake ramen was something I've never seen in this diverse universe of creative ramen scene, often gone wrong, found some middle ground. Maitake is one of my favorite fungi (particularly for tempura) yet I've never thought that it could find a place in ramen. Not bad.

2x Fried Chicken was a bit overpowering but was guiltily delish. I only ate one piece at the premise and consume the rest at home next day.

Now, the Doughnuts - the purple mashed sweet potato came with a variety of crunchy nuts and that texture was very enjoyable. The doughnuts body was made of tofu, and there was nothing felt strange about it. It was just tasty.

I got the Maitake Ramen, which is made of a mushroom broth, spicy miso, tofu, and egg.  Just a few of my favorite things.

Disappointment at its finest.

Strike 1: FLAVOR - That ""mushroom"" broth was watery, flavorless, and lacked the richness and depth of a standard bowl of ramen.  With only a hint of miso flavor and no spicy taste, I'm not even sure what the flavor was supposed to be.  The tofu, usually my favorite part of a meal, was lackluster and only added to the blandness of the dish.

Strike 2: QUALITY - The dish upset my stomach for hours after.  Especially strange because it didn't contain any meats or overly-rich substances...

Strike 3: PRICE - Well, while I expect Vegas resort pricing, a meal like this is definitely not worth $17.

And the ramen, it was strange because it starts out good and gets worse as you keep eating it and all I can say is you can do ""too much"" to a dish in terms of just adding too much to it. There was too much going on. The simplicity of what ramen is begins to get lost in the oily things and all the extra stuff in the ramen.

YELP REVIEW FAIL


I was very disappointed with all the dishes except for dessert.  It is also way overpriced for the amount and non quality dishes.

To start we ordered the grilled octopus.  First off it is Not Grilled, it was maybe heated up in a pan. Second, it was smothered in the sauce and mushrooms.  The enoki were mushrooms were good but over took the dish, might as well just make an enoki dish.

Next we ordered the 2x fried chicken.  This was over cooked, hard and chewy.   Maybe stick to just 1x fried chicken.

Next is the duck leg.  This was actually pretty good.  It was cooked just right so it wasn't dry.

Now the crab fried rice. TERRIBLE!!!  This is Japanese style food and they didn't even know how to cook rice!  It was mushy, almost like rice cake. Just plain Bad! They give you about a scoop and a half of this stuff for $24. 

Next was the NY steak.  You are given 8 pieces that are wrapped in nori and cut like sushi.  The steak was cooked perfectly med well with good flavor.

Last main dish is the Logan ramen.  This was more like bad cup o noodle!  The noodles are dried noodles, I swear they opened a package of Top Ramen and used half for this order.  Then the broth was salty, chalky and sour.  The cook obviously has never eaten ramen in his life.  

We ordered green tea to hopefully wash down all this..... Um stuff, I guess you can call it because it wasn't food at all.  Even the tea was terrible!  It was really bitter and rancid.  Seriously tasted like weeds and a sock were in the pot.  The waiter later explained it is some type of jasmine tea. Although there was no scent of jasmine in the tea.

Now the dessert.  These 2 were surprisingly palatable.  The fried doughnuts were cooked just right.  The outside had a crispiness to it while the inside was soft.  It was also likely sugared with a hint of ginger.  The second dessert was their homemade soft serve.  This was real good.  It had a chocolate coffee flavor to it with pop rocks.  

Overall the service was great! But the food was not good at all and waayyy overpriced even being in a casino.  

Definitely will NOT be coming back here",0mGnLZaS85vWnNKPUDHDxQ,6,3,1,MmLtvEyKcRTG2kIDD9kNXA
2012074,2015-01-31,1,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"Over-priced, pretentious, Japanese fusion food.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

I wanted to love this place but my bill came out to $60 before tip and I left unsatisfied.

Here's how it happened... I walked up to the casino entrance and it was half empty. I had heard so much hype about this place so I decided to try it out. I got seated immediately right next to the hostess stand. I understand a party of one should probably go to the bar but I prefer tables. This table was in a bad location next to a bunch of cigarette smokers as it looked right out onto the casino floor. My bad for not speaking up but moving on...

I started off getting the Roadsoda cocktail which was sake, gin and lemon juice. It was tasty, nothing to rave about and the presentation was about as plain as possible. I mean it looked like Squirt poured in a tall, skinny glass. For $10 I wasn't that impressed.

I ordered my whole meal together: the chicken ""wings"", logan poser ramen, crispy chicken bun, pork shoulder bun, and cod bun.

The buns came out first with the pork shoulder being listed on the menu as a Yusho ""favorite"". It wasn't my favorite. It tasted like Mexican birria in a steamed bun taco. While that certainly sounds tasty on paper, it was salty and flavors were off putting mashed together with cilantro as garnish.

Next up... the cod looked promising. In what's seeming to be a recurring theme now with these buns is it looked like a Mexican fish taco. Battered, fried piece of cod sandwiched in a steamed bun taco with some sort of cream sauce. Honestly the fish was so bland I wanted to take some of the salty sauce from the birria bun and put it in there. Don't worry I didn't but they had house pickles in this one. Take notice of these pickles, they keep showing up. Stay tuned.

Finally the crispy chicken bun was my actual favorite of the three. Simply put it was chicken katsu with spicy mayo and more pickles! Chicken was a nice big cut (for Yusho anyway... I was expecting half a chicken mcnugget to show up) and the flavors worked great together. It was $20 for three tiny bun tacos. Highway friggin' robbery (and that's the sale price for cryin' out loud!)

The chicken ""wings"" we're next. I thought it was going to be real chicken wangggsss but alas it was a teeny tiny chicken yakitori skewer. At least it tasted great with the side of salt and lime they provide. This one was $8.

Finally we come to the Logan poser ramen. I believe it came in a tonkotsu broth with those pickles again, a 60 second egg, a big deep-fried chicken katsu looking skewer with bonito flakes and a mustard sauce on top and nori. I asked for puréed black garlic on the side ($2 extra) and sesame oil but guess what... No sesame oil! Ugh what a travesty! The broth was okay, pickles were off putting, chicken was massive and out of place but tasty on its own, and the noodles seemed undercooked.

The worst part though was this egg. Let's take a second to talk this through. I want my egg to be firm on the outside with runny gooeyness. That's what I'm used to so that's the expectation. This egg they served sucked big time. I touched it with my chopsticks and it fell apart because it was so undercooked. The horror of it all will stick with me forever and ever right up there with The Shining. Words cannot express how awful it is to see your ramen turn into egg drop soup before your very eyes. The ramen was $18 (no justification for that price at all.)

The service was actually very good. Waiters and busters were attentive and available at all times.

Overall I would say this place is a hard pass for me. The prices are in another stratosphere for so-called ""street food"". I don't know who strolls down the street and thinks to themselves ""I'm gonna drop $60 at this food cart right quick"". If your a baller and wanna impress some of your friends I guess this is suitable for you but don't come here for value, it's nonexistent.

We sat for about 10 minutes while the wait staff just hung out around us. No drink orders, no water, no acknowledgement, it was crazy, so we got up and left.
They gave zero f$&ks whether we stayed or left. So rather than throw money at a place like that we went else where.",3lHY2J4ZorQj0asQewlSCA,1,0,1,tAKaS2r0_qBkndQU7yJluA

2114250,2016-02-01,0,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,On the weekend of January 30-31 I stayed at Monte Carlo casino and hotel we have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and me and my wife wanted to try this new restaurant I have to be honest it was between Yusho and 800 degree pizza I should have gone with pizza let me start off by saying I'm just a normal person looking for a good place to eat a good meal I made reservations online which was super easy no problem didn't wait at all when we got their. Was seated at a nice window seat which is not what I requested but ok no problem I asked for a booth which we passed a lot of empty ones before we got to our table. Waitress came over very quick they where not busy at the time started off with room temperature water ok I guess they don't believe in ice no problem still going with it we had decided after seeing their menu online what we were going to have first was the appetizer grilled chicken bun very taste VERY small 2 separate bun were priced individual so that was the cost of a meal right their next we came to main course we both had the ramen which were the spicy shrimp and the Logan. The logan was good not great didn't have enough of anything ramen was a little cold and pork belly was a few pieces I'm not a heavy set guy but for the price I was expecting a little more. My wife's spicy shrimp came with 3 shrimp her soup was super super salty would not recommend if you are look at your sodium levels nothing else good about both. Waitress did not offer any condiments to make meal more enjoyable I had to ask for hot sauce and pepper only got chopsticks no utensils no fork or deep spoon to have the broth I came alway still hungry and feeling a little bit cheated paid close to 100 bucks without tip I will not go back if you are hungry this is not the place for you keep looking or try 800 degree I will next time. That my honest opinion. I gave 2 stars for the desert the Elvis was great.,xNF8xIwALR7XBRoZkuLe7w,1,0,2,CwBfSewVtbwDLNAApkw40Q

Gotta give them props on the presentation... Got the mushroom one and they have all the extras on a separate plate so the deep fried items don't get soggy in the broth.  The miso broth was exactly as expected, if you purchased an instant miso soup packet.  
The Logan poser... Broth was overloaded with katsuo.  Couldn't taste much else. The chicken was crap.  Their ramen in general was unusual, but not the good unusual. More the this doesn't make any sense and it is garbage unusual.

The food is so good that my mouth is watering as I reminisce on the whole experience; sorry I didn't take a lot of pictures my phone was low on juice. It suppose to be street food so it seems simple but I'd only caution everyone else that the food aint cheap.

The first item up was the Chicken Drummies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-las-vegas-2?select=UioPVMGCzrAhEBhmwxoDCQ#jVJY592-J_LNB9vucVuFHg these were definitely not your usual chicken drummies. At least for $9 they better have not been my usual ones. There was I think 5 or 6 fried crispy pieces in red miso, garlic, and sesame, small yes but delicious. I kind of wished I had more. 

The next item was the Pork Shoulder Steam Buns http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-las-vegas-2?select=UioPVMGCzrAhEBhmwxoDCQ#7h3L67sTasIEWUrHlf_J2A It was a juicy piece of pork shoulder with their kim chi, some cilantro, and other things on a white steam bun. It had a lot of flavor. Again it was a little small for me but tasty.

Next was the Fried Duck Leg it's crispy on the outside juicy and tender on the inside, delicious. It was served with a plum BBQ sauce, some herbs, and a couple white steam buns. I love duck and loved this dish. It was probably the simplest to make dish I had.

I don't remember the rest of the items just the picked oshinko cucumbers, lotus root, and carrot salad. I also liked for being veggies. The rest of the menu is pretty much grilled items (tofu steaks, NY aged strip steak, shishito peppers, etc.), fried items (more fried chicken, veggie tempura, maitake mushroom, etc), noodles, steam buns, pickeled, and sweet items (I heard about the doughnut made from tofu, sweet potato, and rosemary it sound good I forgot to try some, another time).

The customer service was excellent. The interior is nice and spacious. Good selection of alcoholic beverages, from beers, cocktails, sakes, and wines. It's located in the Monte Carlo near the front, towards the Strip and can be easily access by walking through the casino or Strip. I'd definitely be back just don't know when.

I forgot to add that they also had these fried skin, served like chips so good.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,10,8,4,CWfbR6qQjDPPkBjTX2gMaw

The space is bright, clean and honest--completely void of the flaunt,show, or flash you might expect from a name at the caliber of Merges. 

The sauces won me over instantly!...balanced acids, character & depth of flavor.  The dishes we ate were all generally good with a few very tasty options.  On taste alone I would give Yusho 4 stars.  The staff was wonderful, entirely able to describe each item we asked about in great detail and made quality suggestions.  This further solidified my 4 star standpoint, but in the end I felt like each item was a little overpriced.  I guess it really isn't overpriced when you consider the fact that you are literally eating on the Strip (we were even seated outside on a beautiful evening driving this point home more for me) and the dishes are truly made of quality ingredients...but at this price-point there are a lot of other local eateries I would rather be.

When we arrived (admittedly reservation-less) at Yusho around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, we expected to wait - but we didn't expect to wait nearly 30 minutes after being told it would be 15, and we sure as heck didn't expect to wait when there were over 10 visibly empty tables in the restaurant.  It felt like a gimmick to get us to buy drinks - drinks, by the way, that were largely out of stock (they didn't have the draft cocktail I wanted nor the Scrimshaw Pilsner I tried to order as a backup).

And after ordering the omakase (chef's tasting menu) and being served an amazing first course of cold shrimp miso, there was more waiting to be had - this time to the tune of about 15 minutes - leaving us to wonder if we'd done something to offend the staff.

Luckily, these two ""timely"" gaffes seemed to be the only evidence of a brand-new restaurant trying to make a place for itself in the bustling South Strip - and from there on out, our meal was BEYOND smooth sailing - it became one I'd never forget!

After the shrimp course we were treated to mackerel two ways - a full fish, fully edible, with a deep-fried head and tail and a sashimi-style middle fillet.  My fiance and I devoured it and prepared for more - which came in the form of a BBQ duck leg, ingeniously served with steam buns and perfectly fall-off-the-bone tender.  The course to follow was our least favorite - but in no way bad - in the chicken two ways (wings and fried).  But what was to come more than made up for it - 

Steak.  Ribeye.  And lobster.  Maine.

The ribeye was served with a chimichurri and cooked to juicy, buttery and fatty perfection, while the lobster - two full pounds, friends - came pre-cracked, meaty, and drenched in Uni butter - which, if you're an Uni fan, is officially the only way you'll accept eating lobster from here on out.  It was divine.

The chef himself presented the final course, which was a professional and well-received touch, and we enjoyed the coffee soft serve and tofu donuts as though we were on a back alley in Tokyo - recklessly and in about two bites.  I would come back for those snacks alone, much less the six previous courses.

Our waiter was personable, funny, honest, and charming, and the restaurant manager Josh took the time to host us and offer his card for future visits, which was truly appreciated after a bit of a ""slow start"" when we arrived. 

The staff. chef, food and ambiance at Yusho is truly outstanding - and reinstates the Monte Carlo as a creative dining destination after many desolate years,",Re1yWqTeMNSI00QsG-VsGg,6,3,4,i4uj1zK4Qc4S6Pi2GkqSWg

My special someone and I came here for a late night dinner. Yusho is a Japanese restaurant that serves their entrees mostly tapas style. Everything is served in small portions. Keep in mind...even though it's Japanese food...you won't find sushi here. While everything is delicious and service was fantastic.....portions don't match the prices. Big eaters: beware. You can gonna order a lot of food before you even come to being full and content.

$7 each for steamed buns. $10 if you want three (3).
$9 for chicken drummies. ***THIS....was our favorite for the night. Basically it's 6 drumsticks packed with flavor and seasoning.***
$13 for lamb skewers. ***our 2nd favorite for the night.** Small portions though....between the two of us, we each probably got 3 lamb cubes.(see pics attached.)
$7 for shishito peppers.
$8 chicken skin. Not a fan....because it's like chicken skin in crispy chip form. NOT worth the money.
$6 for house pickles(cucumbers, lotus roots, carrots)

I had the braised ox tail, fiancée had the Logan poser ramen.  Chef came by and said the ox tail would take a while to cook so gave us a pickled vegetable dish to help pass the time.  Like I said earlier, great service.

The pickles were crunchy which I like.  The pickling sauce was on the salty side....too much soy sauce?  

The ox tail only took 15 minutes so that wasn't long at all.  It was on the rubbery side and was very bland.  I braise ox tails quite often, I think sushi needs to revamp the sauce and maybe employ the use of a pressure cooker...I make ox tail dishes and they always come out with meat falling off the bone.

The poser ramen was also bland.  The noodles tasted like they were the dry noodles that come out of the bag.  The broth was also very bland....tasted like hot water.

As soon as we sat down and saw the menu I was skeptical. The menu was brief and didn't have the usual list of sushi, soups, entrees and rice of a traditional Japanese restaurant. I figured out that most of the items were served ""tapas"" style instead. 

We ordered the Mushroom Miso soup, a mixed green salad, chicken wings with Asian seasoning, three bun sandwiches with chicken and pork, and a teriyaki chicken bowl. 

First, the Miso was incredible!  It was rich with lots of seasoning and tofu.  The broth was very similar to a Chinese hot and sour while staying true to the Miso concept. 

My salad had a tangy twist along with the Asian dressing which was also excellent. 

The buns were large and filling and the meats were generous and well seasoned. 

The chicken wings were large and richly flavored. They weren't just dipped in sauce, they were permeated with it like they were pressure cooked. 

Lastly, the teriyaki chicken bowl was served with white rice, pickled green beans, spices and sauce. The chicken was cooked nice and crispy. 

We were really pleased with this meal in every respect and very, very impressed with the quality, quantity, and flavors of the food. We went from skeptical to deciding to visit again before leaving town. 

Negatives were the loud, pounding techno music played by a live DJ, and the fact we had to pay eight bucks for a liter of Fiji water because we didn't want to drink tap water.",iJEXWXPyiZR59HqkuXNmkg,1,1,4,gBMoqtRPcnDD50J1WWB-DQ

It's definitely reflected in the decor (anime projected onto the brick wall, modern paper lanterns, dim lighting), but not in a pretentious way. The service was wonderful and prompt, and our waiter was knowledgable about the menu.

We ordered the octopus (with green beans, yuzu butter, enoki mushrooms), which I could have eaten 3 more servings of. It was a delightful mix of savory and citrusy, with a creamy texture offset with the crunchiness of the green beans and octopus.

The other appetizer we ordered was the dumpling trio. This may have been a special (I can't quite recall it being on the menu), but I wish I had asked a better description of the dish, as it was literally a trio of three dumplings. Mind you, they were all delicious. One had a Korean gochujang-like sauce with a cilantro garnish (this also had the most meat). Another was deep fried with a yellow sauce which I couldn't really discern what the flavor was. And the last was a gyoza dumpling with another vague, but delicious, sauce. Personally, I would just skip this appetizer.

I ordered the Logan Poser ramen, and was overall pleased with this dish. It came with a crunchy shredded pork block topped with bonito flakes. I highly, highly recommend dipping it in the broth--it gives it such a heavenly taste. The broth itself could have been more developed, but we were given a decent amount of noodles and other garnishes (cucumbers, soft boiled egg, and chili paste). I do wish the overall serving size was larger for the price point.

Yusho has its hits and misses, but I would probably go for the mega ramen next time for the best value for my money.",vkxvRf_Rv56SE68bFYKi_A,2,0,3,1K_Lmr3JkhkUdHJXJjLv0Q

2938256,2014-07-24,1,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"We loved Yusho. Top notch service, good quality food, an open kitchen, friendly and accommodating management, and just an all around excellent experience. 

First, pork spare ribs with bacon and Brussels Sprouts. Yes please, may I have another! Perfectly cooked spare rib, not greasy or riddled in fat, and even though there was bacon + spare ribs which you would think would be too much. Nope. Delicious and a perfect portion.

Next, Chicken Drummies. Even though they were a little dry, I could have eaten several more, and they weren't greasy and overly dressed with fancy sauce making them anything but chicken wings. I loved the saltiness of the miso and the warmth of the garlic. Add a little extra crunch from sesame seeds and you have a decent wing.

Finally? The duck. Oh, the duck. Duck can easily be greasy, overly done, salty, far too fatty and too rich. I had never had a shitake mushroom marmalade, but I ate every single last bite. I loved the sweetness from the marmalade cutting the richness of the duck, and whatever the sauce was was a wonderful accompaniment to this wonderful dish.

The restaurant is VERY gluten free friendly. Even the hostess who I spoke to outside at the front of Monte Carlo giving out menus knew all of their gluten free options. You could even eat ramen noodles! They just a special rice noodle instead. 

You'll have plenty of options if you are gluten free or not, so go ahead, grab a few bites from Yusho and you'll see why their location in Chicago does so well.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,2,1,4,WZub-P4JaKHejwoCeK5inA

My drink was called chihai (I think) which had liquor, jasmine tea, and citrus juice. It was not that sweet and masked the alcohol very well. For our appetizier, we got the mushroom soup. It wa s surprising that we couldn't finish it since it was in a small bowl. I got a logan poser ramen which is tonkatsu soup base and had a fried pork ball on the stick. My friend got the lobster based soup ramen with the same pork ball. The server suggested mixing everything in the soup before eating. The ramen was delicious and filling. I was unable to finish eating or drinking the soup. 

The bill came out to around $58 which is slightly steep for 2 ramens and drinks but hey it's Vegas right? The service was wonderful and they were attentive, answering our questions and being helpful.",orOJVqmO8Y1J6FRurh3v3A,1,0,4,nlnwQhHyXbxv04zxo3i0ZQ

Apparently the wait staff was disorganized and no one was assigned our table.  Shame on the manager.  Manager came by and asked how we were doing. Ah really? What do you think?

Anyways we almost walked out but decided to order  since the kids were hungry and did not want to push through the casino.  We had the:
-Braised oxtail- Sub par, not as flavorful as other oxtail dishes elsewhere. Served Luke warm = bad restaurant.  ""Skip it""
-Tofu steak- pineapple and praline were non existent. Tofu was well grilled.  ""Skip it""
-Logan poser ramen- this was spicy and not noted in menu. Broth a bit sour.  Crispy pork stick is good.  Noodles were a bit scarce.  Served warm = bad restaurant. ""Worth a try""
-kuro ramen- soup base was too sour, but overall flavor was different for a ramen.  Chicken was well seasoned.  There was more chicken than noodles.  ""Get it again.""

The food was a unique take on traditional japanese foods but the luke warm dishes and sourness was a let down.
Overall dining experience:
The speakers were busted in our area so all we heard was loud beating static.  Glad they killed off the music to those speakers.  The dj was spinning some good eating toons.  Smoke from the casino wafted half way into the restaurant.

Was it worth it?  
No.  The portion to price was a bit off.  And as for ""street food"", not really a good description if you ask me.  This place is daring and experimental with Japanese cuisine but items are a bit over seasoned and broth too sour.  If these flavors were cleaner on the palette it would help.  Also work out the staffing and serving temperature issues.
I like the idea of the restaurant and the creativity but fundamental issues like luke warm food, lack of consistency in service and food forced me to rate 2 stars.

It would be unfair to compare Yusho Vegas to its Chicago counterpart, so I will go by this meal alone. I always enjoy my local visits to Yusho, not to mention Billy Sunday is one of my favorite bars in the city. 

 It is a large space and was surprisingly empty on our visit.  The decor is bright and stylish, lacking the excessiveness of most Strip places.

What I thought was good: 
- all the sauces that accompanied the dishes, especially the 2x fried chicken. It was great.
- excellent lineup of Japanese whiskey. Very impressed to find that on the Strip.

- tons of sake. Ordered the kikusui funaguchi, always a solid choice 

Just nice: 
-ramen. Wasn't as great as I hoped it would be but I didn't send it back.

-duck. Kinda dry, but saved by the sauce.

A solid place and I'm glad it's on the Strip. Maybe I actually am unconsciously comparing it to its Chicago counterpart, but I expect better trips in the future.

what made our dinner one bad dinner is when we found out that the server and the managements were not on the same page. It was very awkward and we just ended up taking the damage caused by the server because the way he tried to correct the issue was not right.

Also, one of managers who explained us about their whiskey collection had no smile at all even though we were smiling the whole time. The whole experience was so awkward that I will never forget.

3155272,2016-02-01,1,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"My boyfriend wanted to take me somewhere different for date night and decided on this place. I love Japanese food and was overall pretty impressed with this place despite a rough start, hence one star deduction.

I was a little leery at first since it was 8pm on a Saturday night, and this place had absolutely no wait and it's located on the strip. Oh well, better for us I guess, but why I wondered! Is the food here bad?! Anyway, the hostess that greeted us was very nice and professional. However, when she sat us at the first table behind the hostess desk, we asked to be sat somewhere more inside to experience the restaurant and she said that they weren't seating in that area anymore. Oh well. We didn't mind. That is, until she sat the next party that came in over where we wanted to sit. Ummm ok.......

As soon as we sat down, we were given water by Gabriel. Nice and fast. Then our server came. He was very knowledgable when recommending my boyfriend a Japanese whiskey (forgot the name but it was deliciously smooth)! However, when I asked about the Enlightened Lychee cocktail, he said ""it's nice."" Ummmm ok..... I asked if it was sweet and he said not really. Hmmmm.... So I order it and took a sip and yes it was pretty sweet. Still a nice lychee flavor so I liked it anyway. Not gonna let a drink go to waste! 

Since we were new to the place, we were pretty lost on the menu. I think Chef Danny saw that and took the time to explain the dishes on the menu. What?! Yes you heard me right. The CHEF gave us some wonderful recommendations based on the food we like. We ordered everything he recommended! So this is the feast we ordered which was way too much for two:

Appetizers:
- Spicy tuna taco - AMAZING!!! The saltiness of the skin shell complimented the spiciness of the sauce! Highly recommended! 
- Dumplings - AMAZING!!! The lemon sauce was very refreshing! 

Entrees:
- Wagyu Ribeye - made to perfection!!! The mushrooms were delicious! 
- Kimchi Fried Rice - went well with the ribeye! Pretty good but the steak would have been great without this dish too. 
- Hamachi Kama - one of my favorites of the night!!! A little messy to eat since you have to cut the fish, place it in the nori and add the peanut sauce and coconut slaw in it, but so worth it!!! The flavors all came together so well!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 
- Curry Ramen - I'm a little of a ramen snob so I thought this was just ok. Good idea but just didn't compare next to the other food we ate. 

Dessert: 
I wish I knew the names, but I got this amazing peanut butter soft serve ice cream with brown sugar crumbles and chocolate covered bacon, which I think they called Elvis. I thought I would be too full to eat this but this was amazing!!!! My boyfriend got the orange mochi with brown sugar crumbles and it was pretty good but it was hard to compare it since the ice cream one was so delicious!!!

Overall, I hope this place gets the attention it deserves, because the food is amazing! Notable mention on Chef Danny and the busser Gabriel as he helped us choose the dessert. I would like to say one more thing... Although our server was nice, I didn't really appreciate how he talked to Gabriel. Previously working in the restaurant business, I always believed that you treat your coworkers as a team - wether you're the one on expo sending food, wiping tables, or seating guests - you're all a respectable member to make the restaurant work... You shouldn't treat them as your doormat. I think Gabriel was a hardworking employee and deserves an honest raise or promotion to server. I keep the server anonymous because I don't want to take away from how great Chef Danny and Gabriel were. Anyway, we still tipped great since we know that the other members get tipped out too not just the server. So yes, try this place out and get the Hamachi Kama and Elvis dessert!

With such exorbitant pricing one would suspect great service and authentic food in this age of insurgence of Asian culinary choices in Sin City. I was greatly disappointed and highly mislead.

First ramen on the menu is an attempt to exemplify a tasty traditional pork broth. Unfortunately, the chef here thought it was alright to create a broth that lacked depth and richness that a real Tonkotsu is suppose to be. I wasn't sure who's pallet the chef is suppose to impress. Maybe in Vegas this place was holding back something; afraid rich and tasty would deter folks.

For their signature cocktails, the prices they are charging is a pure insult. The cocktails are weak and far too delicate. Almost to the point of tasting ""watered down."" I understand why so many 2 for 1 coupons were being passed out. The Japanese Whiskys are excellent, but overly priced.

The reason for such a poor review of Yusho is the poor service received at dinner. To pay nearly $16 for a bowl of ramen, I was expecting a whole lot more. To ask the server for a spoon felt a bit insulting. To have the server come with spoons and having the waiter place the spoon on the table abruptly was rude.

For starters, we had the House Pickles, Shigoku Oysters, and Shrimp Beignet.  All three were great for starters.  Great flavor on the House Pickles, vegetables were crisp and not too tangy.  I usually order oysters when it's offered on the menu, and Yoshu did not disappoint with their Shigoku Oysters.  Our server recommended the Shrimp Beignet, and glad he did because they were delicious.

With a large party, we decided to try a little bit of everything and we all liked every dish that was brought to our table.  

From the grilled options, we tried the octopus and Xinjiang Lamb.  For those that aren't fans of octopus and/or lamb, these two dishes will change your mind.  I, personally, don't prefer lamb, but I actually liked this dish.

From the grilled dishes, we went on to try the 2x Fried Chicken, Chicken Drummies, and Crab Fried Rice.  Seasoning on the chicken was really good and not overpowering and it paired well with the fried rice.

Finally, we tried the steamed buns - Crispy Cod, Charred Eggplant, and Pork.  All had great flavors...very good!

YU SHOuld not go to this place.

At first i saw the sign and i was super excited I could not wait for this place to open it's doors because i love Japanese style grilling. Yakitori and Robatayaki is the best and they have noodles too? Bonus!!!!

Every time i drove by the sign ""Yusho Japanese Grill & Noodle House"" I could just imagine myself eating tender cuts of charred chicken and steak off of skewers and then slurping up delicious noodles bathed in brothy goodness.  My mouth would water just at the thought of it.- I could not wait for this place to open its doors because it's such a perfect combo and there really is nobody on the strip doing this at a reasonable price.  

BOOOM!....AWAKEN FROM THE DREAM.....

As i walked in i noticed was there was a lot of outdoor patio furniture clumsily arranged in front of the entrance...uh oh i felt a disturbance in the Japanese Feng Shui force. 

Making my way into the restaurant i was greeted immediately by a very friendly staff, perhaps too friendly...........

The restaurant has a very simple atmosphere, not reminiscent of any kind street food dining i have ever encountered. It's more like this cafeteria i went to at Depauw University in Indiana that i was visiting back in 1998.   Dark wood colors and  a blend of white and yellow light that is confusing, mixed with bad fabrics and colors that don't match.  What ever happened to the good ol Japanese Feng Shui? I am not a feng Shui expert but if i was i would give it 1 Feng on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being a perfect Feng Shui.   There was definitely no Feng Shui Consultant involved in any part of the design of this place. 

The articles have praised Yusho as a high end elevated take on Japanese street food. When i think of Japanese street food i think of carts lining the streets with smoke bellowing off grills as delicious cuts of meat on skewers are charring on the grill and ladles of noodles and steamy bowls of brothy goodness are being served in big bowls to a bustling crowd of hungry folk who only have a 15 minute lunch break.   

Our order of elevated Japanese street food:

Chub sausage steamed bun -- No elevation here it was just terrible couldn't eat more than one bite.  Terrible blood sausage. Since when is Sweet and Gritty good?  I still get a little sick just thinking about it. 

Duck Leg w Steam Bun -- No elevation-- pretty standard on this if you want a little duck and some bread and you have $25 to spare this will do. If i was stuck on a deserted island with only a Yusho restaurant to survive i would probably just eat these. 

Chicken Wings-- No elevation I like my wings with a little crispiness to them...there was no crispiness...  These were slimy and stuffed with a  filling that made it taste like a chicken meatball more than a wing.  No Yakitori or Robatayaki flavor goodness present. 

Ramen Noodles-- Probably the worst non elevation--- Precariously balancing on the bowl was a  rectangular meat stick of what tasted like Panko crumb fried Bumble Bee Tuna. .... .......We were told it was pork.  Much better places for ramen in Vegas and at $22 for a small bowl this one made me really wish i could just beam myself out of there immediately.   Where's a federation starship when you need one?  

The hosts, server, busser provided excellent service.   Since this restaurant is part of the hotel we used our points for the meal and wanted to put a nice tip on a credit card because our waitress was the best ever and it's not her fault she has a terrible product to work with.  In comes a clueless aggressive girl manager who said they could not charge a tip on a credit card for the server and when i asked what they do when this happens she said that she encourages customers not to leave a tip. She reminded me of an angry badger. After a brief exchange of words where i educated her on the concept of protecting her staff.  She scampered away to try again and hallelujah she figured it out!  Obviously this is her first time as a restaurant manager. Sorry awesome staff your inexperienced angry badger manager is too lazy to help get you tips and is definitely the nail in the coffin for this place.  

If this food was not elevated  i think the tourists would like it and there would be a chance of success. Tourists won't like the food and when they have an issue the badger will crush them.   

It's just unbelievable that this  ""elevated"" street food is elevated by non other than Matthias Merges the executive chef from the infamous Charlie Trotters in Chicago- Arguably the greatest restaurant in modern Chicago History.  The only thing elevated about this place is the price. 

Mathias, i think it would be wise to make it an authentic Japanese street food experience.  Change the menu and concept and fire the clueless manager! 

Overpriced, non elevated bad  food, dull atmosphere, with good staff except for the badger.  YU SHOuld say Sayonara to Yusho.",OgGzFgmVEkK7Uo8r4Twlfw,7,4,1,6CvBLdhjT8ELHVF9o-mgQQ

We dined last night (wednesday, 10/27).  There were 3 tables at 7:30.  We work at restaurants on the strip, and we know that the city was busier then just to have 3 tables.
Lamb Skewer- Ok, but almost every bite, we had to spit out a piece of gristle.  
Pickle and Kimchi plate, and charred shishito-  These were probably the best items we had, and that's not saying much.
Mushroom Dumplings-  Check your mix-  The mix was sour.  Tasted of rancid garlic and basement.
All 4 Buns- Pork, Curry Chicken, Eggplant, Cod.  Pork was ok, Curry Chicken--  What was that????  Eggplant was ok and the cod was a bit fishy, and not in a good way. 
Teriyaki Chicken Rice bowl.  Ok, although, rice was not seasoned at all, and sauce was goopy.  Really kind of unpleasant to eat.
We had the 1st Ramen on the menu.  No flavor.  Bland and the pork belly seemed old.

There's wasabi in the soup , there's something sour that , and there's your slaty soup.  Chicken meat on the side is cold and dry.

I left the dining establishment almost as hungry as when I walked in. I spoke to my server and someone I believe to have been the manager. All they did was apologize and sympathize about the portion and pricing. It would have been nice if they offered us something else to eat on the house.

3661912,2014-05-18,4,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"Chicago Chef Merges has expanded to Las Vegas with his interpretation of Japanese street food. Yusho is located at the front of the Monte Carlo Resort and is quite an architectural departure from Monte Carlo's neoclassical style. Yusho's interior is contemporary, colorful yet there is a bit of austerity from its clean lines. Service is excellent, friendly, attentive and descriptive. Rob, our waiter is a Hawaii-born transplant who energetically articulated the specials, menu descriptions and portion sizes. We were impressed with Josh Wolf, Sake Sommelier, who also came by to ""talk story"" with us. 

I noted this restaurant after reading about it in an issue of Eater National. My curiosity was piqued because it's billed as a Japanese Grill and Noodle House. Yusho's chef had been the executive chef under acclaimed Chef Charlie Trotter and also mentor to some other talented and respected culinary professionals. I was curious how Chef Merges would put his spin on the familiar Japanese street foods such as ramen, tempura, yakiniku (Japanese barbecue or grill) and grilled skewered assorted meats.

We truly enjoyed Yusho's Japanese inspired cuisine from simple, sublime to intensely flavored dishes. Each dish was presented beautifully in a comfortable, somewhat homey feel. The flavors were executed well and blended Japanese and Western cooking techniques. Don't expect a traditional Japanese restaurant or ramen shop or sushi bar here! 

Our menu selections for this evening included the following.
 
-  Grilled octopus with haricot vert, enoki mushrooms, and egg yolk. The grilled octopus was tender and lightly smoky and formed a melange with julienned haricot vert, baby enoki mushrooms finished with a rich, creamy egg yolk sauce. There was a kick of spicy chilie that balanced the richness of this dish.

- Grilled Shishito peppers served in ponzu with grilled shallots and tendrils of grated lemon rind. The peppers aren't spicy hot but ponzu and lemon brightened the smoky grilled flavor.

- Logan Poser Ramen came in a rice bowl size serving vessel. There was a log of crispy shredded pork topped by bonito flakes that waved from the heat. Behind the pork log was 2 squares of crisp nori. The pork and nori covered fresh, steaming hot ramen in a lightly spiced Kotteri-type broth. The broth was luscious and had that ""umaminess"". 

- Veggie tempura was a huge bowl of light as air battered seasonal vegetables and thin slices of lemons. A bowl of ponzu sauce finished this dish.

- Crispy cod in steamed bun with pickled cucumber, sesame and watercress. The bun was pillowy soft that was a contrast to the crispness of the fried cod. The cod was expertly done as it was moist and silky beneath its crispy ""shell"". All of the contrasting textures, crispy to silky to pillowy worked together in harmony.

- Tofu Doughnuts rolled in rosemary sugar and topped with purple potato sauce and toasted hazelnuts. These doughnuts were creamy yet somewhat dense, almost like a really good Andagi or cake doughnut. 

All of the food was packed with flavor that was familiar to us Hawaii-born but had unexpected twists to traditional Japanese food. Prices to portion seemed a bit steep, for example, the rice bowl sized ramen cost $21.

It had various pork and beef along with a half egg and a LOT of veggies.. Seriously, the ratio was almost all veggies, very little Ramen, and a few pieces of meat. All that along with the broth was sooo bland, it was almost offensive. I ate it all because it was like $21, and I was still hungry. 

My girl felt the exact same way about her spicy shrimp bowl. All in all, 2 bowls and 2 pints of beer was $62 before tip. I know it's the strip but I couldn't help but fill ripped off. Steer clear from this place, check another place out.

I tried the pork bun, the Japanese pancake, the chicken wings, and the doughnut. One thing that bothered me about the menu was that there were no Japanese names for most of the dishes, so it was a little misleading for me. For example, the chicken ""wings"" were basically a variation on yakitori, served on skewers. Either way, the wings were definitely delicious and I highly recommend them. The pork bun was good, but the meat & the sauce were very separated, so in one bit you'd get all sauce and in the next it'd be all meat. The doughnut was a unique dessert, made from tofu with a sweet potato paste.

The restaurant's decor is typical modern-fusion restaurant, and the food presentation is excellent - as you can probably see from the photos, great care goes into how each dish looks.

Thin and crispy and salty and flavorful. Yummmm. The sauces were not too spicy but still very tasty - my only complaint is there could have been more of it.

We were greeted by a very sweet hostess. We were sat near the back where we could watch people walk by on the strip. It is always entertaining to see all the walks of life that come to this town. As locals, it is cool to know that anyone can enjoy Vegas. 

We ordered the Omakase, which is their tasting menu. It came with the pork shoulder, chicken skewers, a small serving of Ramen, a whole lobster, grilled green pepper dish called Shishito, and dessert. Typically, this is a 5-course menu. However, for that day the chef hooked us up with A LOT of food. I am sure it was because they were so slow. This place would have more business if they did proper advertising. 

If we never got the huge lobster dish, I would have thought it was overpriced for the type of place it is. For those who enjoy people watching, there is a great view in back you can request for. The service was excellent and the timing of when the food came out was decent. I can understand why they were awarded best new restaurant. I would not say it is the best ramen I have ever had. I believe there are better places to eat off the strip. 

You can get most of what is on the menu for a fairer price that taste just as good at a restaurant off the strip. But, if you want the experience then I highly recommend going there.",kHEQu2K4TIiXdw7Onj9TIw,1,1,4,9_9y-tXEG4F6K8gtJZ1K7w

We order the traditional pork ramen. It was bold in flavor and generous in portion. Also the duck breast was made to a good medium rare. Requested no onions and the sauce and mushrooms were drenched in diced onions. I was basically over this restaurant so I just ate around it.

Shrimp tempura 5 thin tiny pieces 18 dollars! That was outrageous and no dipping sauce either.

4127826,2014-05-18,0,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"Dinner tonight. I've been wanting to try Yusho since I first heard about it a couple of months ago.  'Street food'-style Japanese dishes are something I've been wanting to try.

Octopus: like others have said, it doesn't really look grilled. But it's GOOD. Hard to describe--cooked tentacles, green beans, and what I thought was noodles in a creamy sauce must have been the enoki and egg yolk. Of the categories of dishes on the menu, though, 'grilled' matches best. 

Chicken skin: I didn't know what to make of this at first. It doesn't look like skin--flat chips shiny with honey and covered in bits of what I think were roasted garlic. By itself, I mainly got the taste of the mustard and honey, but it really went well with the other dishes, which brought out the crispy skin flavor.

(That's something I noticed--the dishes there really shone when they were eaten together--the dishes I had complemented each other nicely.)

Japanese Griddle Cake--okonomiyaki--this was my first time having this anywhere, though I'd read about it before. Described as a ""stuffed pancake"", I've thought of it as egg foo yung made with pancake batter instead of egg. As street food in Japan, you can get it with an assortment of ingredients.  Here, you get all the ingredients. Kind of messy, but good that way. The cake was nice and light. The menu says ""squid, papaya, basil"". There were also a lot of bean sprouts, and I tasted something anise-y. I enjoyed it, but a couple of bites had a rather acrid herb in them. No idea what it was--kind of like biting a houseplant. But other than those two bites I really liked it.

House pickles--good variety of vegetables--lotus root, carrots, burdock, cucumber, probably others I didn't catch. It went well with the chicken skin.

I also had their special--rocky mountain oysters. Battered, fried, and sauced, served with a celery root salad on the side. The plate surprised me--they were smaller than I expected (small grape size). Soft and very mild tasting. Their flavor was kind of buried by the flavors of the other components--the batter, the sauce, and the salad.

In all, I really enjoyed my meal.  I'd increase the price range to '$$$', though. The individual dishes are reasonably priced, but they're all small plates, and you'll want a minimum of three or four for a meal. That adds up. My meal (no alcohol) came to $60.

The one thing I didn't care for was the music blaring from the overhead speakers--too loud for me.",-4JDJeFS0YAYSiSvIshGLQ,0,1,4,ZsnRmp8RgroprdPljHuTBw
4129736,2015-09-14,0,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"This ramen restaurant is modern and fun. The atmosphere is classy and urban. It's definitely a Vegas restaurant. 

The service is perfection. The moment you walk in you are greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. The wait staff is super friendly and super upbeat. They make sure you feel comfortable and they make sure you have everything you need. The service is definitely five stars. 

As far as the food, I was not sold. I love ramen. It's such a magical Japanese dish that had been commercialized by American restaurants. Ramen  should have a bite and a bounce in the noodles. Ramen should have a clean and refreshing soup. I ordered the monster ramen. This is definitely more than 3 servings. It's a monster size. Hence the name of the dish! However, I did not love the ramen flavor nor the ramen noddles.

I'll end this review on a high note. The fries appetizer is a must. It's a high note to start off your whole meal. The fries are super crisp. Yummmmm! It's such a memorable crunchy bite.

4132209,2014-07-05,3,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"I gotta say, while I enjoy many styles of Asian cuisine and the flavors, cooking techniques, and ingredients that go along with all of that.. I do agree with others that YUSHO doing "" Asian Style Tapas "" (as described by the server) Is not what I expected.. which is often a good thing. I honestly don't mean to be insulting or rude.

It began with the miso soup - I wish I had a photo, it was really beautiful - in its little bowl. The issue my date had with it, was the vinegar finish of the soup. It wasn't the earthy, warm flavor you expect from quality miso.  It wasn't unpalatable, just caught us off guard and did not get even half finished. i didn't actually see it on the menu, which could also be the issue, as perhaps its available due to Miso being a component of a ramen dish they have listed. 

On to the crispy chicken skins.. Again, really very nice in presentation... But really lacking something in the finish for me. They were served cold, which I didn't expect, and just didn't do anything for me in the flavor department. I can't really recall much about the taste. I have always loved fried chicken skins, simply brined and seasoned, fried and served with a a little sauce. These were, again, beautiful, but not anything I would order again. 

We also sampled the Fried Oyster, and Eggplant Steamed Buns.. great texture on the buns, nice panko breading on the oyster, tasty on the eggplant. Delicious.

We then sampled the Chicken Wings and the Octopus. The Chicken described as Thai Chile, Bonito Salt and Lime. Delicious, boneless little morsels served on a skewer. I liked them. Really tasty. The Octopus was tender, cooked and prepared nicely with Haricot Vert, Egg Yolk and Enoki mushrooms. Again, a stand out flavor and something that was unique for this dining experience, for me. It was rich, and I detected a hint of something maybe citrus? though I did not ask.. I really liked the taste of the dish. I actually had some sticky white rice with it. I hope that doesn't offend anyone, but that egg and mushroom and tender octopus was so good with a starchy rice. 

Next was the Japanese Griddle Cake -  described as SQUID, Papaya, Basil.. 

Beautiful little egg omelette, pancake goodie topped with Smoked Salmon , Plum, Radish, Sprouts and Bonito Fish Flake. Not what I expected, (because squid,) but It was easily my favorite dish. I am the guy that likes egg anything. Souffle, omelettes, over easy, poached..so that's 3 stars alone. Thiws dish really made an impression on me and I loved it. So thank you for that!

Now the Poser Ramen. Beautiful presentation.. I keep saying that.. but everything looked great. I just didn't love the broth or the noodles. It was salty. I like salty. I'm a fan of Tonkatsu, which is rich and salty..but with depth of flavor and balanced in its saltiness if it's done well. I'm not saying this was bad by any means.. but so salty that I ate the beautiful little panko breaded pork shoulder and the two sheets of seaweed, got the egg out of there.. and skipped most of the noodles. Oh the noodles... The best way to describe them.. is wimpy. I'm so sorry.. I'm just saying that nothing hit the mark for me on this one, aside from the breaded pork shoulder. I could eat that alone with a poached egg. 

It was about  $163 for two of us, that included a $45 bottle of wine, and Rosemary Sugar dusted Doughnuts - with candied ginger and hazelnut.. ( i loved them) .. .. I'm not complaining about the prices.. Strip Prices.. I'm aware of what that entails. We got a fair amount of food and tasted many items. I would definitely go back for some other items on the menu. i think its a great little casual spot and I look forward to it becoming a favorite among locals and tourists alike.

4146800,2014-08-31,8,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"Yusho? More like You-should-not-go. 

Much fanfare surrounded the opening of this place a few months back, with the Weekly quickly proclaiming it the ""best new strip restaurant."" Hogwash. I love the concept of a Taiwanese-style night market, and maybe the flagship spot in Chicago delivers, but our experience was quite sad. We ordered the ""grilled"" lamb, the Logan ramen, the fried chicken, and the pork buns. The lamb was more boiled than grilled, lacking any crispy texture or smokey flavor. Such a bummer. The ramen was a travesty of thin and flavorless broth, with some weird fried pork suspended on a wire on the edge of the bowl, and an overcooked egg. The pork was tender and tasty, the best part of the dish, but it made little sense for all the fuss of the presentation. If you can't pull off a rich, complex broth, and if you can't manage to produce a soft egg, you don't deserve to have ramen on your menu, end of story. The fried chicken was dense, overly crunchy, and dry. You have to work pretty hard to mess up fried chicken, but Yusho pulled it off. The pork buns were the highlight of the meal, but everyone is doing these right now and while Yusho's are fine they don't hold a candle to the ones at Fat Choy. 

No complaints about service, in fact I feel bad as I was ranting about the ramen when one of the kindly wait staff approached with our next dish. Oops, sorry buddy, nothing personal. But when you go to the strip and pay strip prices and then, once again, fall prey to soulless and overly fussy dishes meant to please the lowest common denominator of mass acceptance, you get pissed. Shame on me, a local, for ever thinking these trendy strip concepts will actually deliver the goods. Fooled again.

It was a saturday night, around 9pm, and the place was dead. I was curious to check out what's happening at Monte Carlo, since it's the first time in my ten years in Vegas that anything interesting is taking shape at this place. Signs aren't good. No one coming or going; no action, no energy. It felt like we were the only ones who missed a tornado warning. So, overall, a pretty disappointing outing.

ATMOSPHERE: casual but classy. Decor and ambience felt like I was in a classy place.  This place is like an upgraded, fancy ramen restaurant.

FOOD: ok.... so my friend had the curry ramen and she loooooved hers. I had the pork one... can't remember he name of it but it's in my pictures.   The bowl and presentation was fancy..... however, my broth tastes burnt! Maybe I was the unlucky one to get the burnt batch but eeewwww  being that I hate complaining about food, I ate it. I took out some burn veggies..... the pork was nice and tender. I was hungover and in need of soup... so I sucked it up.

PRICE: concept and location I guess it's reasonable. However I don't think it was worth the burnt tasting broth.

I've only been here twice, the first time was when I was invited to a dine around when the restaurant first opened. I brought my roommate and we sampled several of their dishes. Some of the flavors paired with the dishes were a bit different than the typical Japanese cuisine, but this made the tasting fun and new. I remember loving the fresh oysters and the NY strip steak... Incredible! I also remember not caring for the ramen at all, as for some reason it tasted sour. Some of the dishes were mouthwatering good and the others, less than average.

My second visit was more recent, when I came for the event Yusho After Dark. For $20 you're able to enjoy a main dish, an alcoholic beverage, and the apps they pass around to your table. There was this unique salad with dried black mushroom and a poached egg that I liked. Never tried anything like it! 

I know that their normal menu is a bit pricey for the small portions they provide. I would say that Yusho is a restaurant to go to for the experience and to try new, different dishes. If you are starving, I would recommend going elsewhere.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,3,1,3,X04auNoVLnd6WZLovaeYzQ

Servers were really nice and constantly filled your water so that was a plus. Some of the girl servers(?) has regular street clothes was weird to know that they worked there. 
I don't want to be picky cause maybe it's just my taste buds but here is what I thought:
The heirloom tomato salad was simple but very refreshing. Good to start off. The picked veggies were very spicy. It was not a good palette cleanser as they said. The 2x fried chicken was actually very good-flavorful and crispy. The drumsticks has Asian sauce flavor that I wasn't too keen on. I also had the Mushroom Ramen that I thought was decent. Normally ramen has a very salty broth but this one was very nice and subtle. They give you the things to put into your ramen and whatever the plum thing was---I did not like that. 
 For the main dish the NY strip steak looked really great. I don't think they let it rest enough because it was a little dry. If prepared correctly I'm sure it would have been much better. The hamachi fish had a unique presentation and was tasty. It was served with a coconut coleslaw and peanut sauce. Crab fried rice seemed like it had too much flavor if that even makes sense. They just need to tone down the spices a little.

We ordered quite a few dishes. The first were the Scallops, which were slice and raw and seasoned with soy salt and pink peppercorn. We also ordered the chicken wings that were tossed in thai chili, salt and lime, but they were not your traditionsl wings. They were 3 wings on a skewer, but they were boneless. One of my favorite dishes was the TeriChikenDon. It was a bowl of white rice with crispy chicken over it, and a fried egg on top. If you break the egg, the yolk gives the entire bowl awesome flavor. And my other favorite dish was the Yaki Ramen. It was more like a stir fry, no broth, mixed in was lump crab, garlic butter, bok choy and crispy leeks. And for dessert we ordered the Mochi, whiich was peanut butter and chocolate chip flavored with honeycomb sauce drizzled over it. I cant lie but this was not my favorite.I just thought the gummy paste over it was kind of dry.

Japanese - Curry Ramen
Banana Ice cream

I ate here twice. The first time was just drinks to use 2 for 1 coupons given out at the hotel desk. This place needs to give out coupons to fill seats. That was red flag #1. All 5 of us ordered the draught cocktails. They were all watery. Flag #2. Every time any one of our drinks was half gone, not fully, a server would come over. This gets annoying fast. Flag #3, pushy sales. 

Despite all the red flags the next night my friend wanted ramen so we went here. We had a young male server. We ordered our ramen and he didn't bring us spoons. We finally got his attention and I mentioned it. He then brought spoons with his bare hands and set them on the table. Not on a napkin. God knows what was on that table. It was two faux pas in a row. The ramen was in small portions and overly salted and lacked depth. It was not worth the 15$. It was so bad I refused to eat it. My friend and I went next door and ate pizza. I've had better ramen from the grocery store or food truck.

If the food was more flavorful and better portions, or if the prices were lower it would be better. Also they need to find some servers who are better with customers. If they were nice I would not be as upset. I predict this place won't last a year with the food, service and prices offered.

5022963,2015-03-24,3,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"Yusho was the choice for dinner on Day 2 of our Vegas vacation.  Yusho had been on my radar for its eclectic array of Asian street fare and interesting sounding cocktails.  The wife and I had reservations for 7pm on a Monday night, not that we needed them since the restaurant was far from full.  Yusho possessed a casual appearance that didn't sing Asian cuisine and frankly seemed out of place in the otherwise generic and, frankly, moribund Monte Carlo.  As a result, the energy level was, not surprisingly, low.  Fortunately, we were seated at a high top that overlooked the kitchen, which gave us a great view of seeing our food being prepared, something the wife and I always enjoy.

Yusho's menu was as promised, hitting Asian street cuisine like ramen, skewered grilled meats, and steamed buns.  We went with the 6-course Omakase Tasting menu ($75/person), which allowed us to sample a wide selection as well as an item that wasn't on the menu.  All of our omakase selections were excellent, however, my three favorites of the night were the Foie Gras with Buddha's Hand, gastrique, and sea salt; the Logan Poser Ramen topped with crispy pork, egg, nori, and cucumber; and the most unique item we had (which wasn't on the regular menu) was the Fried Duck Testicles or as they were affectionately called, ""Quacky Mountain Oysters"".   I feel no guilt or shame for loving foie gras and Yusho's rendition was delicious and, for me, guilt-free.  The ramen was the definition of umami, but equally important and appreciated by me was the fact the broth was nicely seasoned and avoided the saltiness that is often found in lesser-quality ramen.  By the time the dessert course, rolled around, I was already comfortably full.  Needless to say, after dessert, I was on the verge of bursting.   It was a good problem to have.

Yusho hit on all cylinders.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Drinks were top notch.  However, its omakase menu offered up serious value for the generous amount of high quality, deliciously executed food that we received.  Compared to the appreciably higher priced, yet far less satisfying tasting menu experience we had at another Strip Asian joint, Hakkasan, Yusho blew it away.  Without a doubt, Yusho was one of my dinner highlights of our week in Las Vegas.

In a city full of displaced Chicagoans longing for their beef, dogs, and deep dish it would seem odd to some that one of the most exciting Windy City imports to Sin City in years has arrived in the form of Japanese Street food but having been lucky enough to attend the soft opening this Saturday suffice it to say that Yusho is poised to buck the trend of ""celebrity chef"" Strip-side dining.  Owned by Matthias Merges and nothing short of stellar in its Avondale location where service, sourcing, and skills befitting his Michelin starred past found new footing in reinterpreted yakitori, a visit to Yusho at the Monte Carlo begins with the space, a jazzed up version of the original with a long floorplan plus eye-popping colors juxtaposing the gleaming open kitchen and with knowledgeable servers brought in from icons like Savoy and Robuchon without any pomp or pretense the 'experience' unfolds like few others - casually refined and a whole lot of fun, the kitchen and front of house doing each other justice even on day one.  Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,27,19,5,nOjuq4_MDdq48_uHT1l_Ng

I was amazed first of all at the phenomenal service from the entire staff. From the moment we walked in, until we walked out we were treated like we were the only customer in the restaurant, and you know better than that, it's Vegas!

The food...phenomenal. The Monster Ramen while they said was for two could feed four. The two of us attacked the ramen like it was our last meal, after having the Duck Breast, which only could have been better served in bed with my lady. 

We paired it with a whiskey flight, and a whiskey cocktail (I don't remember the name) which was fantastic as well. 

The desserts were equally as amazing. The s'mores and the yo mochi... You have to try them. 

So to sum it up, this was by far in my 38 years of eating out, the best food and dining experience I have ever had. Well worth the $100 spent, and I now will be dreaming of this meal, craving it, until we return. We will be back. 

I can say with all sincerity, this isn't the best strip restaurant in 2014, it's the best restaurant ever to have opened on the strip to date.

I've been here twice when it first opened and when they changed management....the concept is great and brings awareness that there is more to Japanese food than sushi and ramen....

I've had:

House Pickles - Standard pickled vegetables

2x Fried Chicken - Good and different than what i'm used to (kaarage) the first time I had it it was lightweight dry.

Chicken Drummies - Flavor is interesting but I don't really fuck with dark meat....

Crab Fried-Rice - Interesting as they bring out a broth where you dip it in

Logan Poser Ramen - Not a fan of the ramen they make as it tastes different and sour broth...

Shrimp Ramen - ditto to Logan Poser Ramen

Maitake Ramen - that maitake mushroom was good but ditto to Logan Poser Ramen

Shishito Peppers - Bomb

Hamachi Kama - Great, this was cooked nicely and amazing...i fuck with yellowtail collar at every izakaya or japanese restaurant i go to...

12 oz Ribeye - Delicioso and was one of the better items on the menu

Chicken Wings - Good, excellent

Pork Shoulder Bun - First time trying a Bao bun and this was excellent

Doughnuts - Interesting take, lightweight bland but great texture and subtle flavor

Yuzu Ice Cream not currently on the menu but was bomb.com with the caramel and tart flavor...

All in all Yusho is a very interesting concept and is willing to take traditional Japanese street food items and tweak them in their flavor. They are always looking to change their menu and keep it fresh and I respect that...that being said their food is missing an extra touch to it...it's lacking something...maybe it's lacking the umami taste...maybe it's the prices but they do have potential to be a great restaurant on the strip",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,0,0,3,ARl1rmSpGhy6PaKob9PQ3w

Also the frisee salad was on the astringent side so, there was no need for a side of pickle - things...So either it was a mistake on the server not knowing what was on the plate or he thought we were dumb....

As an industry professional I am happy to say that I am impressed with the entire package. Usually with restaurants I expect there to be a lot of kinks in the food and the service, but tonight I was genuinely impressed. 

First, just entering Yusho set the tone, I was greeted warmly by the hostesses and management. There was an excellent vibe of please come and have a great time. After being escorted to my table multiple members of the service staff touched my table and introduced themselves.

There was a great selection of craft and draft cocktails as well as sake and Japanese whiskey to choose from  

The food was spot on!  Caramelized kimchee and and yakitori glazed octopus to start. The griddle cake was solid as well as the chub sausage steam bun. The tempura is the best in Las Vegas.

5674914,2014-06-17,4,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,"I am really not sure which way to go with this review.  The food and service were great, but we left feeling a bit ripped off.  When new businesses open, there are growing pains (to say the least).  I usually give them the benefit of the doubt, but in this case, they've been open about 3 months and most of the issues we encountered were avoidable.

First, I made our reservation via Open Table about a month ago.  When we approached the host desk, she had trouble locating it.  The desk seemed very disorganized - there were post it notes everywhere and she couldn't find ours.  Luckily, she found us in the computer and we were seated after only a couple of minutes.  Not exactly a seamless arrival though.

It took about 10 minutes before our server approached our table for a drink order.  Although she was very nice, it wasn't a busy night, so I am not sure what the problem was.  By that time, we were pretty much ready to order, but had some questions about the menu.  The drink I wanted (Chuhai) was not available because they had run out.  That just seems strange to me - how do you ""run out"" of one of your signature cocktails?  Anyhow, our server was not completely knowledgable about the menu and even said ""you guys are really testing me tonight!"" We inquired about the Omakase and how it works.  She said we could choose 6 courses ourselves, or have the Chef do it for us.  From my experience, it's always good to go with the Chef's choices, so that's what we did.  

Now, I am not totally familiar with this restaurant, but I've heard that they are known for their 2x fried chicken, steam buns and ramen.  We were excited to try as much as possible, but understood that we couldn't try everything.  Our Server brought out our place settings - we had many forks, knives and and ramen spoon.  We were excited to know we would be getting ramen.

First was a seasonal salad.  I really liked the dressing (I think it was a yuzu vinagrette). It was pretty good and I even managed to eat with my chopsticks! :)

The next course was not on the menu.  It was Aji - Spanish Mackerel.  The presentation was a bit creepy, but the fish was super fresh and really delicious.  Not something I would have ordered for myself, but very good.

Next was the Xin Jiang Lamb and Duck Breast.  The lamb came on a skewer with cumin and cucumber salad on the side.  I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.  It had a great smoky flavor and you could tell it was cooked on an open grill.  Was more like steak than lamb.  I also liked the addition of the cumin on the side - we dipped our lamb in the seasoning and then the cucumber sauce and it was delish!

The presentation of the duck breast actually made it look not very appetizing, but looks can definitely be deceiving. The duck breast was stuffed with shitake mushrooms and wrapped in bacon and served on top of a shitake marmalade with extra mushrooms.  I really liked it and would definitely order it again.

We then received the Hamachi Kama, which is definitely not something I would've chosen but was AMAZING!  It was served with thai peanut sauce and coconut slaw, with some greens as well.  We dove right in, then we realized that there were seaweed wraps as well and maybe we were supposed to make wraps with the fish, peanut sauce and slaw?  This wasn't explained when the food was brought to the table, so we ended up just eating the fish.  Which was fine, because it was really good, and I am not a huge fish eater.

We then expected to get ramen, but it never came.  In fact, we then received our dessert.  We were really disappointed that we didn't get ramen, steam buns or 2x fried chicken (at least one of them would've been nice).  On top of that, the desserts were just not good.  We were served the doughnuts, which are just strange, but ended up being the better of the 2.  They were tofu doughnuts with sweet potato and rosemary.  The topping was purple, which was just weird.The other dessert was the soft serve and I hate to say it, but it was disgusting.  The menu says that it's coffee soft serve with Fernet caramel, pop rocks and nori.  First of all, I love coffee ice cream, but this was inedible.  Also, I am not sure who decided to use fernet to make caramel, but that is just wrong.  Lastly, there was no sign of pop rocks or nori - which is ok, because that doesn't even sound like it would have made the dish any better!

This was not a good ending, so we decided to order a bowl of ramen to share, since we had expected it during our meal and never got it. We went with the Logan Poser Ramen. It was OK. I really liked the crispy pork it came with.

Overall, it was a decent experience. I would definitely go back, but after adding up our courses, there is no way our food was $200. Then an additional $60 for drinks? It's a casual place, so that doesn't quite match with the vibe. I think they have a slight identity crisis.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,7,4,3,9_4XNQZIqSQOABZSQ7mahw

It shouldn't take 25 minutes from the time you sit down until the time the first food is brought to the table. Not when it's mostly ramen noodles. I mean, who has that kind of time? We sure didn't. And that 25 minutes was after we flagged down a waiter to tell him to please step it up.

So when the food arrived, we were pleased and dug into it immediately. One bowl of ramen with fish balls and another bowl of ramen with a fried and sliced chicken breast. I thought mine was just fine, but Mom insisted that hers was too salty to enjoy. We sent it back. The waiter said that the chef added some hot water to it and it certainly was improved vastly.

Let me first off by saying the service itself was very good since one of the main guy Cory came to our table asking us how everything was and making sure we were happy. He even gave us a complimentary shashito pepper app which was very good..Thks Cory..ok now for the rest..

We ordered housemade pickles, pork shoulder bun, steak with nori, chicken wings, shrimp ramen, and mushroom ramen.. 

The house made pickles were actually good..fresh and tangy and refreshing. But for $9 not worth it. One of the server also came and picked up the dish without asking us if we were done with the pickles and took it away when we had one pickle still left in the dish. for $9 im going to eat all the pickles but was unable to since the server took it off our table.

The chicken wings had a good taste to them and i enjoyed it for the most part.. I would like the chicken wings more well done and crispier than how it was served . but overall not bad. $9...same price as the pickles which makes no sense.

The pork shoulder bun was good..very good flavor..but the bun was cold. Im sure sitting outside played a role in the bun being cold . but i kinda expected a hot soft steaming bun. But maybe thats how its suppose to be served..not hot. The bun was $9..FOR ONE! cmon..i surely thought it was served with two..but they did warn us it was just one. 

Steak Nori was very very good..good flavors and the meat was tender and the nori was dry and crispy..how it should be..the mushrooms on top had a very nice flavor..but for $39 not worth it at all..

The shrimp ramen was good for the most part..the only thing was the broth..it tasted very shell fishy..the noodles were cooked good and the shrimp was awesome..but the broth taste was a little off. The ramen was served in a tiny bowl which seemed like a large drinking cup..$22 not worth it at all.

The mushroom ramen was good i enjoyed it..no complaints there at all..the mushrooms were good, the tofu had good flavor, nooodles were cooked al dente which i like. the broth had good flavor and i love soft boiled eggs and it had an egg in it which had a soft yoke. Again served in a tiny bowl ..not worth $17.

Finally the shasito peppers..only complaint is ..wish it was cooked lil bit more..but thats just how I like them but this one was free so it was the best!!

Ok...overall not bad..flavors were there but the food could be better..Cory kept asking how we liked it..and we told him it was good..i really didnt complain to him because my MAIN problem was the price and portion size which he cant really do anything about. Would i go back to Yusho?....maybe if someone treated me..but i would not go there again with those prices..the prices were ridiculously high for the portion size and the quality. 

Cory..lower the prices and give us bigger portions..then maybe il return..anyways thks for the experience:)


Update: 11-29-14 visit..

I revisted this place because i was inthe mood for some ramen..I figured its been a while so they mustve improved in some of the negatives i mentioned  above. Well it didnt.. the portions r still small(ramen). The only thing they did was serve the ramen in a bigger bowl making it seem like the portions are bigger. I got the kimchi ramen and the broth was sooo plain..needed spices or seasoning or something.

But as a world class ramen junkie, I say skip this place. They had other menu items that were decent according to my peers. But the ramen left much to be desired.",CLxJgJZvZAKKhqRXP8yX8w,1,0,2,_JPNdYZwUzdapvGguop_-g

The shrimp had a wonderful grilled flavor and the broth was out of this world.  If you want a dirt cheap meal hit up the food court. If you want quality and flavor hit up Yusho.,ML0lkqYXCXTIbrG_doc28g,0,0,5,BiykaDPvwog2teo7DXAorg

We also ordered some dim sum, the noodle was so thick and hard we could not even eat it. That we sent back. Had it not been that we had been traveling all day, and were starving we would have sent the Ramen or whatever that was back as well.",5feyovgHwlxAFNXhMBCqow,0,0,1,LXl84jf4T-PkMuz_8xoDDA

I just hate the far walk to this place. When our group finally found Yusho we were greeted by the hostess Katie, who was very sweet by accommodating us as we had originally made reservations for 3 but grew to 8 and were 15 minutes late! 

The former GM Joshua Wolf would take care of our group every time we dined in. He was amazing in customer service and great with food recommendations. Upon dining, I didn't know what to order so I trusted him to put together an order for our group. He was spot on. Our table shared the plates and was more than satisfied with the menu Joshua put together. 

Favorite items are the Crab Fried Rice, Ramen & the Fish Bun

4 stars for food and service",J_t2JOOHOTdtKtY-zXgGJA,4,0,4,C4AYVi1cHiJQ6eqNTx8y6g
