This location is in a nicer part of LV. Plenty of parking space n others shops to visit after a nice meal at Jollibee.",o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,1,3,2rrxheAJ4yAuObuRPzjYAQ
165400,2010-11-14,4,JbopSXzZIy7id23GJsO9pA,"You may ask yourself, why did this guy rate Jollibee so high?! 5 stars?

Well, I have my reasons and I will tell you. I grew up in the Philippines, lived there for 14 years and when I did, I never really thought much about Jollibee. When I moved to the US for school, that is when I began to really miss the unique menu and mascot of Filipino fast food. If I had lived here in the states and just tried Jollibee, I can understand a 2 or 3 star rating. But I rated it higher because of them bringing it to America. It let's me feel at home, even for 5-10 minutes. The atmosphere, the service and the customers remind me of the islands that I miss so much.

That's why I rated it 5 stars, how many places can offer garlic rice with longanisa? Spam? Corned beef?! Pan de sal? All on the go? Spaghetti! Not many.

When I go to Jollibee, I always get the yum with cheese and spaghetti. Only in the Philippines is where we offer rice and spaghetti in the same place. Now many non-filipino's may find that wrong or weird.. But to me, its awesome.

Heck, even the McDonalds and KFC in the Philippines offer spaghetti. It's not your regular Italian style, we put sugar and hot dogs in ours. Which I think is better.

I think it may be an acquired taste, when I was younger I never really liked the special sauce they have.. But now its one reason I go there. I have yet to try everything, I usually get the same thing but that's because I like it so much. Anyways, if you're in the area and want to try something new.. That's fast. Go for it. Also, the good thing about this Jollibee is it shares with Red Ribbon. If you get a meal in Jollibee, get dessert at red ribbon. That's my 2 cents..

From all the Jollibees we've gone too, everyone has waited till you were done placing an order to tell the people in the back.
Anyways, it took a good 10-15 minutes to get our order (and mind you it was completely dead inside) and when we finally got our order the side of the boxes was dripping of spaghetti sauce that ended up rubbing on the side of the plastic bag. When I had pointed it out, she just gave me a new plastic bag and had me transfer the boxes myself. Call me lazy, but when you serve me something like that its your job to fix it , not mine.

1. You're not Filipino.
2. You're Filipino but you were raised in the US.
3. You haven't tried Jollibee in the Philippines before.

Seriously, this may sound racist but people who doesn't fall in these criteria understands.

I was born and raised in the PI and I grew up eating Jollibee on special occasions of my life (LOL). It is an acquired taste!!! You can't be craving fried chicken one day, come eat here and expect to have that American flavor to it. Same with Spaghetti. Filipino Spaghetti is sweet. Sometimes spicy. You can't expect it to taste Italian and be disappointed about it.

Their spaghetti is on point. Despite the fact that it only has 2 pieces of hotdog, or sausage (sometimes), it still tastes like home. I'm not a big ""chicken person"" so I can't really comment on the Chickenjoy. Their fries? It sucks. LOL Don't even think about it. Just pretend it's not on the menu. But my son loves their corn. It's just a little overpriced! I mean, you're better off buying a $1 can of Kernel and melt butter in it. 

But that's the point of coming here. Besides the ""hit-or-miss"" menu items, it's that ""I miss Philippines"" feeling. It's that ""teaching your kids their culture"", or that ""let's try something different"".

You honestly can't come here and expect a lot. Even the Jollibee's in the PI are not as it used to be when we were kids. Their servings are small and they only give you ONE packet of ketchup and ONE tissue to wipe with. LOL oh i know..",iWuBuSndPxPQYzQMF5L_lw,1,2,5,OzvKM3XOnRp6LhXu6GdVWg

Growing up in Manila, going to Jollibee was considered a treat for my brother & I! I enjoyed drenching my rice with gravy while eating that crispy, juicy fried chicken. Other times, I'd order the sweet, cheesy spaghetti instead. If I'm being extra fatty, I'd pair it with a cheesy, mustardy jolly hotdog & top it off with the ube pearl cooler (boba) for dessert. May I also add that the tapioca pearls here are so big & sweet & chewy soft that no other boba places can compare. Too bad they only have two flavors but you can't go wrong with ube!

And 20 years later, living here in the US, I still do the same! The taste may be slightly different but Jollibee will always be a favorite. It's nostalgic & I have little complaints here. Prices are fluctuated but I don't mind. I'm just glad I live in a city with a Jollibee in a good neighborhood. Most workers are always kind & patient so that's already a plus for me.

The food regularly comes out cold (chicken, spaghetti) and what's astonishing is that front and back of the house staff is robust. The staff aren't really socializing with each other or rude as much as they seem to be focused on everything but providing timely and at best decent customer service. 

Do not come here doing meal times (lunch and dinner), they will either forget ringing up your order and you'll end up waiting for 30 minutes or they'll serve it right away to you...cold. 

As far as ordering the chicken here, beware of ordering the chicken ""spicy."" They douse it in so many spices that its inedible as your throat burns on every bite. Our last and final meal here of fried chicken was so bad that my husband had an allergic reaction and we ended up going to the ER after that meal.

I ordered the tocino breakfast, which came with like 6 small pieces of pork, garlic fried rice and fake scrambled egg with a tomato slice on it, and let me tell you... The tomato was so good! And that's it.  My gf ordered the spam breakfast.... The spam was cut the wrong way. How do you cut spam the wrong way? If it has squared edges you cut it the wrong way!! It has to have the rounded edges.  Spam lovers, YOU know what I mean! 

Our meals came with free coffee by the way and tasted horrible.. no wonder why it's free.  Good thing I got a cup of water too.  And the service was annoying, no kind of personality or enthusiasm, when I asked for ketchup, she gave me 3 packets.. I looked at it as she placed it in my palm... I said, can i get more please, she grabbed 2 more.. paused to think.. and grabbed another 1 packet.  Ay yi yi!  2 stars for the tomato, and good water.

Paid more here compared to mc Donald's or jack in the box. I would not recommend this place to any of my Filipino friends. Looks as if they took away the tv. Maybe people were just using the place to view the Filipino channel and wouldn't leave. Another cut back to create more revenues.,_Ro-S4BVZzC7Wa0KjxwGDw,0,0,1,Gb8mcTl_oj0N_MjS1cdA7A
2029949,2014-10-05,2,JbopSXzZIy7id23GJsO9pA,"I'm really saying 3.5 stars... or 3.75.. 

Please, people, don't sleep on the spicy Chickenjoy! I don't know why, but it's some of the most satisfying spicy fried chicken out there. Plus, chicken and rice is a universally delicious combination that is exponentially improved here with spice and a side of gravy. It's taken to even higher levels with the ability to add fries, burgers, or filipino spaghetti (complete with cheese and hot dogs). Don't sleep on filipino spaghetti either. And, finally, if your greedy meter is maxed out, you can always pop in and order filipinos empanadas (less flaky, more doughy/thicker like pie) or desserts (ube cake and mango cake for the win) and breads from the adjacent Red Ribbon Bakeshop.

If you're too lazy to hit up Red Ribbon, the Jollibee dessert pies are surprisingly good. The banana langka is a pie version of turon (banana and jackfruit eggrolls) that are good but make me sad for actual turon. However, that and the alternate flavor - mango peach  are served flaky and warm. And, of course, you can't go wrong with halo-halo. 

A word of warning (and the primary reason I don't give more stars): The drive-thru almost consistently is either slow or makes mistakes on orders. Once, my sister drove all the way home, eager to share spicy Chickenjoy, only to find that all the chicken was sans the ""spicy"". Make sure to check your order - the red flag and specks of spice should be clearly visible. Also, I find that three family buckets options are weird and force us to order a lot more a la carte. Perhaps smart on their part, but frustrating and far from satisfying for me.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,2,2,4,jXHa0CAb72iRgYQ5o7lKNQ

I asked what is that flavor 3 times and laughed at me again. Finally saying it's coconut flavor. I asked her why she didn't just say that. The cashiers were beyond rude towards me and my family. We were the only caucasians in the entire restaurant and I know she purposely wanted to make me feel stupid. How do I know? I spoke with the manager and under her breath she kept talking about us.

2880720,2015-10-24,6,JbopSXzZIy7id23GJsO9pA,"How much do I love Jollibee? Let's put it this way, there's a picture of me my sister tends to circulate in social media wearing full on Jollibee PJs my first year living in America as a child. I grew up with Jollibee in the Philippines, left at an early age, but visited often while I was young. We stopped going there at age 9, so I was Jollibee-deficient for several years until Jollibee popped up in Daly City (with a 24-hour drive thru to beat... I went here for Thanksgiving one day lol). When I went to college, I drove an hour from UCLA to indulge myself with those flavors I loved so much as a child. 

This location is not as good as other locations, so don't judge Jollibee as a whole based on your experience here please lol; however, I'm still a big fan! They provide me my Filipino comfort food in Las Vegas. They have done a lot lately to improve - the spaghetti is now meatier with a tastier cheese. Katherine A. is right about a lack of consistency in their halo halo, but I still wind up getting it since it's hard to find a decent halo halo in Vegas near me that has all the ingredients I want. My mom loves halo halo, she gets it almost weekly back in the Bay Area. One hot summer day she got halo halo from here, and said it wasn't the same as the one in Daly City. The staff is very friendly and shows you that winning Filipino hospitality, but your food might just take a bit longer than you're used to at other fast food places. I've been told 10-15 minutes waits on food items, like the hot dog or ChickenJoy. The wait is worth it though to get to dip that crispy skin into their tasty gravy (and leave the white meat for someone else eat :D). If you miss TFC, they have a TV in here playing all day. It's also connected to Red Ribbon, so I tend to order at both if I come inside.

They inform me of the longer wait for the pies.
The pies are always freshly hot :D

I should also top this off with a couple other things:
The boba in their Ube pearl drinks are soft so I know it isn't stale tapioca pearls being used.
They NEVER forget the lemon juice packets for my Palabok.

The restaurant was busy and not very clean.

I brought my family to lunch in this area and had no idea what to order, but after a suggestion from the employees, I got the following:

- The Yum Burger
- Lumpia
- Chicken for my kids

After getting our food and taking our first bites, I knew it wasn't go to go well.  My kids didn't like their chicken and when I tried it I can see why.

The Yum burger was OK, but I wouldn't eat it again.  The lumpia came out different than what I expected...  Imagine if you took some real lumpia, shrank it to the size of a french fry, fried it dry in the microwave for 20 minutes and then added water and microwaved it again to reconstitute it.  You get an interesting concoction. 

Everyone also had a very heavy feeling after eating.  That is no good.  It's like you just put sand in your gas tank.

Service:
When I rolled up to the window, I was charged for a 3 piece, two sides! Fine. Whatever, I wasn't in the mood for an argument so I paid the darn $8. Lady at the window was very sincere about her apology in screwing up my order but never offered to fix it. 

Food:
Mother-trucker! This place takes the cake in messing up fried chicken-ROYALLY. I took the first bite and my lips looked so greasy, it looked like I over applied clear lipgloss! Moved on to the fries in hopes for them to be so awesome, they would make up for the fried chicken lard drumstick I had just bit into. Negative. Salty, stale and with an odd flavor!

4014977,2012-12-12,2,JbopSXzZIy7id23GJsO9pA,"Now being a proud Filipino person, I gotta say I love my people.  My peeps.  My bretheren.  But Filipino fast food?  Not so much love.  Jollibee does some things right, but some things not so right.  Damn...can you say over-processed food!?  

Jollibee is of course, the Filipino equivalent of your American McDonald's or Burger King.  It was created when settlers from the lost tribes of the Philippine forests ventured to the soil of modern society and proclaimed that the world was their oyster...errr...balot.  Okay, fine, fine.  Jollibee got its start in Daly City, CA by trying to give Filipino-American families a taste of home that was long forgotten.  Apparently my Nanay and Tatay both missed the taste of the PI with burgers, chicken, and sweet spaghetti!  And the joy of that strange red and white bee buzzing around.

Honestly, Jollibee is about as Filipino as I am to looking like an Asian Brad Pitt (though on most days I'm closer to Jo Koy).  Close...but no cigar.  This is Filipino trying to attract caucasians at it's finest.  No offense to caucasians (especially you - Most Desirable Woman of 2012 Jennifer Lawrence), but not much Filipino influence is to be had here.  It is for all-intentional purposes, dumbed down for American audiences.  Which is a bit of a disappointment because real Filipino food is bursting with real flavor!  Patis here, bagoong there, jufran here, 'all-purpose' sauce there...pork EVERYWHERE...that is real Filipino food.  Jollibee, ai sos, I don't know what to tell you.

Of course I eat at Jollibee occasionally because my kids somehow like it here.  My little one goes, ""This is how they eat in the Philippines?  Yummy!""  Now I've never been back to my homeland, but I'm 110% sure this isn't how most folks eat there.  I've seen the PI episodes for both No Reservations and Bizarre Foods so I know!  Tony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern cannot be deceived!    

Going to the food.  For fast foods standards it's OK.  Nothing special for the most part, but somehow comforting at the same time.  It is nice to see Filipinos congregating in the same place considering what a melting pot Las Vegas is.  It's kinda like eating at the communal table.  Except we are all partaking in a lot of sodium and artificial flavoring.  But who said MSG was bad for you, eh?  Jollibee's menu is all over the place!  They got burgers, fried chicken, fried fish, Italian spaghetti, palabok, hot dogs...it's nuts!  Then of course you got sides like waffle fries, mashed potatoes and gravy, and white rice.  Filipino, right?  And who can forget the creative names for some of their food?  Fried chicken is called 'Chickenjoy',  and there's burgers called the 'Amazing Aloha' (it has pineapple in it) and the 'Big Yum!'  (I have never had it but I am assuming it is BIG and YUMMY).  Gotta love the marketing.

If you've had fast food before you know what to expect from Jollibee.  It all tastes strangely the same.  I will give them credit for their Chickenjoy though, it's pretty darn good!  Especially when it's fresh out of the fryer.  Something about getting a side of gravy to dip your fried chicken in is very appealing to me.  Add a side of mashed potatoes and corn and I'm in.  Jollibee Chickenjoy rivals that of your big chain fried chicken joints.  Masarap!

Jollibee does breakfast as well, and I think that this is actually better than their lunch and dinner menu.  What Filipino doesn't like garlic fried rice with a sunny-side-up fried egg and your choice of meat?  Especially when your choice of meat includes pork tocino, fried milkfish belly, corned beef, or SPAM?  Lovely!  Bring on some shoyu, Filipino ketchup, a Lipitor, lots of water and I'm all set!  Thanks for the memories.  Sure beats a friggin' Egg McMuffin!

Jollibee does dessert as well, boba drinks that they call 'Pearl Coolers' (UBE=YUM), peach and mango or banana pies (that look just like the ones from McDonald's), and the ubiquitous Halo-Halo.  International dessert of the Philippines!  It's kinda like fruit cocktail mixed with coconut shavings, condensed milk, shaved ice, and topped with a dollop of ube and vanilla ice cream.  This one is a bit sweet for my liking though, wish there was more fruit, and less milk.  It is kinda pricey though at around $5 for a large.  But unfortunately the large only feeds piggy ol' me.  

Overall it's an OK experience.  And yes, the cashiers at Jollibee can speak English as well as Ilocano or Tagalog and are very friendly.  If you go in here and think all Filipino people eat like this then you my friend have no clue!  Ok well maybe some of us eat like that.  Most of us rather be at home with a pot of chicken adobo or fish head sinigang or kalding (goat) calderetta simmering on the stove.  Just saying.

4026856,2016-05-04,2,JbopSXzZIy7id23GJsO9pA,"I've been to Jollibee many times- Cali, Philippines, and here. It's all just Jollibee to me. If you're unfamiliar with the food, you'll probably enjoy the experience since it's very different from other fast food places. I don't really like the burgers; I always get Chicken Joy with rice or the spaghetti. I really like Filipino spaghetti so I enjoy this. The palabok is alright too. It's fast food so you can't expect too much. If you want something a little better, order the arroz caldo or palabok from the Red Ribbon counter right next to Jollibee.

I always order halo-halo from Jollibee. I just went there for it last night. I can go to other Filipino restaurants when I crave halo-halo but I always go here because I know what to expect and it's always consistent.

With that said, their customer service is the worst. They always forget stuff on orders and just generally lack friendliness. A girl on Yelp mentioned they were rude to her and she thought it was because she ordered in English. First of all, this shouldn't matter. But I can confirm they are rude to all people.

Jollibee got the honors for our next Halo-Halo Challenge.  They say pictures are worth a 1000 words. Well, when we walked into Jollibee, Bam! In our face was a beautiful sight...a poster of a perfectly made cup of Halo-Halo. For about $5, I was hoping we got exactly what the picture demonstrated...ube ice cream, flan, sweetened condensed milk, red beans, green jelly, and coconut packed in shave ice.  I think a little ube syrup was even added just for show (see pictures).  Our Halo-Halo tasted as good as expected. And with the Vegas heat that evening, our dessert only tasted that much better. Our Halo-Halo was sweet, cool, and had enough of the minimum ingredients to keep me satisfied until our next challenge.  So far, I'm a fan of Jollibee's Halo Squared.  My only issue...I wish there was more flan and some legit ube (not ice cream).

PS: For an appetizer before our Halo-Halo Challenge, I tried their Beef Tenders (Tapa).  This was basically seasoned and caramelized beef steak, eggs, and rice.  So good and a perfect quick meal before any Halo-Halo Challenge.

4142835,2013-07-23,4,JbopSXzZIy7id23GJsO9pA,"I have heard about Jollibee for quite some time and finally got the chance to try it out today.  A friend had told me that it was like the Filipino version of McDs and KFC combined with some traditional Filipino staples thrown in the mix.  And yep, that is what I thought when I saw the menu.

We had the fried chicken and the spaghetti today.  The fried chicken was tasty and I really liked the gravy to dip it in.  Yum.  The spaghetti was really different since it had cheese on top, a sweet tomato sauce, and some hot dog pieces all mixed together.  I know it sounds super weird, but it was actually good, in a strange way.  

It was a cheap meal too. For 2 adult meals and a kid's meal the total was only $16.  Not too shabby for lunch.  I wish I was more hungry because there were a lot of fun looking desserts to try.  Maybe next time...And there will be a next time!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,8,6,3,gD_kh6tEkrB15T_Jivus3w

I left with root beer, a piece of fried chicken and sweet spaghetti with hot dogs and ham in the sauce.  I'm not saying it was bad.  Just not what I expected.  Sure, I could have ordered something more like what I was expecting.  Something with more Asian or Island influence.  But I honeslty did not know what any of it was.  I should not let that scare me and I usually don't.  I do enjoy trying new things.  But that is after some previously obtained knowledge.  I know very little about Philipino food culture.  So I went with what was familiar to me.  Fried chicken and spaghetti.  The chicken was not the best I've had.  It was not terribly crispy.  And the spaghetti was like something I would expect a child to eat.  Sweet and full of hot dogs.  That being said, I actually really did enjoy the spaghetti for what it was.  To pay around $6 or $7 for a drink, a pice of chicken and a scoop of spaghetti seemed too much.  And the restaurant was terribly hot.  Their air unit must have gone out.  The tables were warm to the touch and there were noisy fans all over the place.  I don't place any blame on the owners or management for this.  I just warn everybody out there in Yelplandia that it may be uncomfortably hot in the Jollibees on West Sahara if you go in during the summer.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,ZsHoj0BI6z2fRxgUOFmpOg

Upon walking in, holy jeez it was hot!! The ac was not on. All they had were multiple large fans circulating hot air! It was like walking into a giant oven. 

Next, my halo halo was pretty much just ice. It was topped with ube and mango ice cream and flan. I mixed it in with the rest and it was still bland. A halo halo is supposed to be chunky with a whole bunch of ingredients. But did I get that?! Nope!!! Just a little bit of red bean and 2 or 3 of the jelly things. The rest was all ice. Complete fail of a halo halo. 

As for the food, I don't eat it. Spaghetti is uber greasy. If you want Filipino spaghetti, just go to seafood city, buy the ingredients and make it yourself. Hell, I was born and raised in California and I make Filipino spaghetti better. Plus it's supposed to have hot dog pieces in the sauce. There's like 5. Another fail. The fried chicken, I don't know what it is, but it always has this weird taste. Like it's fried with old oil or something. It's like a rich taste, but not good. The chicken is served with a side of a gravy. For me, gravy doesnt really go well with spaghetti. However, I must say that the peach mango pies are delish. The crust is crisp and light while the filling is not too sweet. I once bought 6 of them so I could eat them later on.

They said my sandwich would be right out......
15 minutes later...... no sandwich... went to the counter and they said ""it will be right up""

I haven't been to the Philippines since I was about 8 years old and until a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco, I had never been to a Jollibee before. Well that visit inspired me to finally check out one of the Vegas locations.

My mentality as I approached the drive-thru window was simple. I might as well order everything I want to try now. Just get it out of the way so I don't have to come back. I ended up spending $14!

The verdict? The fried chicken was just so so. The side of mashed potatoes tasted like instant. The side of corn fared better, but basically that fried chicken combo was a bust.

Fortunately, the Filipino style spaghetti rocked! Honestly, I used to hate the sweetness of Filo spaghetti sauce. I'm probably still partial to a good, tart Italian Bolognese, but I'm totally down with Filo spaghetti these days and it is something that Jollibee does right.

On to dessert. You can get two pies for $3, so I opted to get both the Mango Peach and the Banana Langka (jackfruit). The Mango Peach was pretty good in its own right, but OMG! The Banana Langka is a superstar. I would totally come back just for that. It's basically like Turon. And that equals yumminess.

Overall, I can't give Jollibee more than two stars. It just misses the mark on basic food flavor (I'm referring to the fried chicken deal and the one bite of my cousin's cheeseburger I tried in SF). Still, it is totally worth a visit just for that Banana Langka Pie!",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,1,2,2,87lfdgH0dxWv1-j--3lZGw

FYI, Jollibee is like the McDonald's of the Philippines: notice the flamboyant mascot, pretty 'eh' of a menu, and its prolificness. They both have kiddie toys and accommodate birthday parties for teeny tots! 

Tonight, I got to attend a birthday event for one of my good friend's daughter who just turned 2 years old. We were provided with a private room with enough space for the guests (make that roughly 30) and an open space for the kids to play around and dance. People were given an hour to munch and socialize, which was then followed by an hour-long program that consisted of games for the kids (and one for the adults!) and finally, a dance number by the bumble bee mascot. He sure 'stung' that one Psy song like a boss! We all had fun and I could've sworn tonight's experience felt like I was teleported back to the Philippines for a while. (or maybe even Hong Kong - Yes, they have Jollibees there too!) The cashier up front even greeted me with the Filipino honorific 'po' when I ordered some food to-go! Awesometastic. 

Nonetheless, as much as I loved the company of tonight's crowd, Jollibee won't go up to my top 10 (or even 20) of fast food joints any time soon. The chicken joy is basically another word for 'Popeye chicken', with jollibee gravy added in. Oh, and there was so much fat attached to the chicken's skin, I wouldn't be surprised if you confused its consistency with jello. On a brighter note, I probably like the spaghetti best, sweet red sauce with hot dogs, very Filipino - lovveeee! Halo halo (shaved ice with beans, fruits, jelly and ice cream etc.) isn't bad either. Choose that for dessert or the peach mango pie. It's probably their alternative for the apple pie at Mickey D's for all I know!",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,3,2,3,qAUp870TRO0YVmJGlkSwng

Personally I've always been a McDonald's kind of girl growing up in the Philippines, unfortunately for me McDonald's in the US doesn't serve fried chicken and rice lol. I go to Jollibee on a rarity because first of all, the wait time for your food is always ridiculous be it dine in or take out regardless of the amount you're ordering it seems, and second because the food is beyond mediocre it's laughable. The chicken joy which supposedly is their money maker and star is pretty bad, most times I wonder if it's actually even chicken, it's comparable to Popeye's chicken but Jollibee's is a grease trap and not at all appetizing, although I have to admit I love the crispy skin.  

The spaghetti is ok for fast food quality I guess, the palabok not so much. My Husband and son likes their Yumburger with cheese mostly for the sauce but God knows what that is made of too lol. The halo-halo is never consistent either, we ordered 2, one was decent with just the right amount of ice and sweetness and the other was a total fail. Their peach mango pies are their only saving grace in my opinion.  

The lack of quality aside though, Jollibee will always thrive because there are tons of Filipinos who flock their locations for nostalgic reasons. Their brand represents the core values of Fiipinos, the importance of family and togetherness, a sense of belonging that no matter where you end up in the world you'll always have that little piece of home when you eat there. So with that being said, I'm sure I will still find myself coming back at one point.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,4,3,2,MZcmDm_vjoUxuKZz4PCxrQ

When I'm craving Filipino food but in a rush this is the place I go. Not the greatest menu. Honestly, I only like the palubok with their chicken combo. The chicken taste great especially when dipped in that gravy sauce they give along with it.

If you've never tried Filipino food, I suggest going to an authentic Filipino dine in restaurant.  I don't want you to think this is how Filipino food is supposed to taste like. 3 stars!

Anyway, been here twice when I've craved a buko pandan shake and this was the only place to snag one (til I franchise my own Zagu). Both times consisted of customers waiting and waiting for their food with no one placing an order...which means they had adequate time to catch up if they were truly in the weeds (which it looks like they shouldn't have been). Read: Extremely slow help...took 10 minutes to get my shake.

The second time I came in was last Tuesday when they were about to close for a buko pandan to go...got my shake and realized there was a huge baseball sized object in my cup...hey look, an iceberg...no really...a huge baseball sized brick of ice. Was the person that oblivious to what they poured into the cup or did they think it was just for some child who wouldn't speak up?

I went back the following week and showed the manager the pic on my phone and explained what happened...she immediately made another and apologized. Star added for quickly correcting last week's foul but I think it's time I buy my own pandan syrup and coconut milk and create my own...not returning for a third strike.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,8,5,2,OIXoilS7OgdMfNPa5g4nyw

But, every time I mention that we have them in Las Vegas to some of my friends, they make such a big fuss over it.  I stumbled in to this one a few months back and was not very impressed.  I had their palabok and chicken dish with coke for beverage.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Their food is overpriced, not worth the money.  I actually thought that McDonald's is better to go back to.  That's a sad comparison.

My cousin came over to my house one time and brought over Jollibee from this same restaurant.  He got the spaghetti, pies, and forgot what else.  I was actually more impressed with it that time.  The spaghetti was really tasty and the flavors were impressive.  The balance between salty and sweet was perfect.  I wondered if it's just a hit and miss.

Today, I went back and used the drive through.  It's very slow and employees look a little depressed and unhappy to be serving me.  Maybe I just looked like I was not worth serving.  Who knows?  I ordered the JolliHotDog and Spaghetti because of the good impression I had in my mind from when my cousin came over with one.  I am convinced it's a hit and miss.  My hot dog was not worth $2.58.  The sauce they put on there with the cheese and banana sauce didn't go well together.  I give that a thumbs down.  The spaghetti was lacking the same taste as the one my cousin brought over.  I was disappointed once again.  It just didn't have that taste.

If I didn't have Jollibee again, it wouldn't make a difference.  I think this restaurant didn't give me the feeling of wanting more.  It was just ""eh!""",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,0,3,1,9uthu4D5XA2ak_q3x39_oQ

Location is great since there are not too much Filipino food options around the area. Service was great, and I am sure it will still be but this was not the case this morning.  

We came in as they opened at 7am before heading to work.  My son wanted their chicken but they told us chicken isn't ready for another 25 minutes, I am assuming they still need to fry a batch since they just opened.  My son went for a little alternative and just wanted to eat rice and gravy.  Well supposedly they do not sell gravy and you aren't able to get a side of gravy without ordering the chicken.  So we asked for the manager and she said the exact same thing.  I told her well we do not have time to wait for the chicken and it's not really my fault that their chicken wasn't available in the first place and that we have ordered a side of gravy before.  Her response was ""Well not under my management.""

So we just brushed what happened off and just carried on and waited for our order.  Well it didn't stop there.

As many know, Jollibee isn't that big of a place.  So if somebody is talking crap in their kitchen, you can hear it out front.  And that's what happened.  The manager started talking crap about us.  I couldn't hear the entire conversation but a couple things popped out. It was in tagalog but she said customers think we owe them something and why would they say its not their fault that the chicken is not done, is it my fault they didn't order chicken?  

I called her back out and told her that its not right to be talking about customers like that, and if she does choose to do so, do it in the office and not where everybody can hear her.  

Her response... ""Thank you for your feedback.""

This is a Filipino fast-food joint. It's like the Filipino Mickey D's. It's not fusion or anything. Filipino, Filipino, Filipino! Pinoy! From the food to the old ladies that cut in line in front of you. And no, this is definitely not the best burger anywhere.

I'm sure there must be one in L.A. somewhere but don't ever recall seeing one...  Anyhow, decided I would hop over for lunch just to see what it would be like.  And well, I like it!  Granted I only had one thing on the menu, but it's certainly off to a good start.

The place is pretty big, set up like a typical fast food joint but with more of a mickey mouse-like set-up.  I'm not sure what it was, maybe the big bee and the color and the plastic-y seating?  Anyway, thought it was quite interesting.  There are probably 30 tables inside, and at least a third of them were occupied with Filipinos, belying the poor rating from Yelp.  Traffic remained brisk during my stay, so I'm guessing they do okay.  The service was pleasant although not necessarily altogether sincere, I thought.  But, what more can you expect from teenage employees at fast food restaurants?

They messed up my order a bit - I ordered the 3 piece chicken with a side of fries, but received rice.  Okay, chalk that up to confusion between ""fries"" and ""rice"", which could sound similar.  The chicken was properly crispy and fresh, and quite good.  This is a departure from other reviews I read.  I am a fan of Popeye's because their chicken come crispy, and don't like KFC because theirs do not.  I would say Jollibee's chicken was crispier than Popeye's although I like the seasoning on Popeye's better.  So basically a wash between the two, which is a complement for Jollibee's.  And to the rice, not fries... Okay, the rice is typical rice.  But that gravy is delish!  Surely it must be half msg, but who cares!  I put the gravy over the rice and that was pretty irresistible.  

So there you have it, purely based on chicken & gravy, I'm giving it 3.5 stars.  Impressive for fast food.  I will eventually try some of their other stuff, including their Filipino dishes and the spaghetti.  Debated if I should give it 4 stars and work down from there, or 3 stars with a chance to work up.

I took 1 bite of my food and realize that it wasn't ""Spicy"" like what I ordered so I called the restaurant and the girl who took my order answered the phone, she tried to argue that I didn't say I wanted my chicken ""Spicy"" I told her that It's not my fault that she didn't hear me but I know I repeated it twice I know I ordered ""Spicy"" chicken, I told her I will wait for my bf then we will go back and replace it. I waited about 10 minutes until my bf got home then he drove me back to Jollibee since I was already drowsy from my 2 medication that I took previously. When we back to drive thru gave them the 2 bucket of chicken then they replaced it with ""Spicy"" chicken, or so I thought. When we got home I was already very drowsy from having no food in my system and medicated when I took my first bite of the food they gave us we realize that it was the same chicken we returned to them and they just put a bunch of ""Spicy"" powder on it that you couldn't even eat it!!!! It burned my stomach even more that I actually THREW UP AND PASSED OUT!!!!!!!!!!! When my bf called the SUPERVISOR ANSWERED.  MY BF ASKED IF THEY JUST GAVE US THE SAME CHICKEN AND PUT A BUNCH OF POWDER ON IT AND SHE ARGUED THAT SHE WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK THE ORDER AND THAT SHE NEVER HEARD ME SAY SPICY CHICKEN, MY BF HAD TO REPEAT HIMSELF SAYING ""THATS NOT WHAT I ASKED YOU, I ASKED YOU IF YOU JUST GAVE ME THE SAME CHICKEN AND JUST PUT A BUNCH OF SPICE ON IT, YOU CANT EVEN EAT IT ITS TOO SPICY. WE WERE BOTH SO UPSET AND THAT SUPERVISOR DIDNT GIVE A DAMN! I PASSED OUT THAT NIGHT MY BF HAD TO CALL THE AMBULANCE ON ME BECAUSE I WAS MEDICATED AND THAT SUPERVISOR GAVE ME SPICY CHICKEN THAT YOU CANT EVEN SWALLOW. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS AWARE OF WHAT THIS JOLLIBEE DID TO ME. I WAS PASSED OUT/PALE FROM 5 AT NIGHT UNTIL 3:45AM.",vtDQZBZET-7KQJ1zr6XTCg,11,1,1,62opKOETlwPll-i6vSaTRg

They got my order wrong of course when I got to the window. 
The corned beef sandwich for $1.29 was tempting so I got 2. Really not bad at all, it tasted like that corned beef hash in a can I ate in college. Sort of tasty and spam like. 
Will return for a proper entree and skip the drive thru!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,1,0,3,XKg8hL3idpRh4ubE3NFBMg
5914695,2017-07-02,1,JbopSXzZIy7id23GJsO9pA,I just loved coming here when I was growing up as a kid. There's just some Filipino pride coming out of me when I come here to eat with family or friends. The yum burger is my favorite item to get from here. Also there halo-halo is the Bomb! Filipino pride y'all.,kSOkDKEdCzDjOVFaqOcTKQ,2,1,5,jzRa3dfOl-O7CFzvDojfaA

So I do not know why there are so many haters out there rating this place so low when they keep coming back here anyways... You know who you are... And why even bother to write a review...just to prove that you are above jollibee? FYI KFC in the same complex closed down... I think this is because jollibee was getting all the business instead. So don't listen to all those haters (especially if you are Filipino) go ahead and indulge yourself in the crispy skin of chicken joy and the yummy sweet spaghetti. Go ahead and relive your childhood days of yore...",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,1,1,5,mZRxoDe82PgYmsYrZCXTHQ

I've been to Jollibee in So Cal before, but never to one here in town. I've never been a huge fan, but figured I'd give them another shot.

I got the spam breakfast and it was ok. The best thing about this place is that everything is so cheap, even for fast food. Nothing amazing but it satiated our craving for a quick and cheap meal while we were in the area. Good for what it is, cheap fast food.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,8,3,kjuwb-ksq3Ce2Zc9eEN7xg

It isn't my first choice in most respects but I do so adore their breakfast offerings which are far and away something different than grabbing a McWhatever or some other kind of bread, egg and sausage sandwich.  I can have fish for breakfast or longanisa with rice and when the family is away, this might not be Lola's cooking but it definitely is good enough to make yours truly content.",OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,0,0,3,PJDQal8H0nsZb9IG0rXzkw
