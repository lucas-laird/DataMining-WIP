though the heart of the Strip is right outside your window.  Lots of 
hardcore gamblers make this their headquarters.",iw_6JAAw9FAIv2YkbLcMFA,1,0,4,KuSr8RyS4at1MFHIjc3Jgw
912883,2006-08-24,0,GHwn0lza-JdaETNbOw98oA,"I was very pleased with my recent stay here.  It was definitely the best deal I could find online...my cousin, boyfriend and I all shared the room.  It was a 2 queen bed room and it was quite spacious.  We had a big window although it just faced a parking deck and the side wall of the Flamingo.
Barbary is a great central-Strip location as well.  Very easy to cross bridges to Bellagio, Caesars and Ballys.  Paris is close by too.
Since the hotels is much smaller than the new megaCasinos, check in  is much easier.  They offer $2 drinks all the time and they were pretty strong.
There is a Seattles Best Coffee in the lobby, which is good after a late night.
I definitely recommend it!",WBmqTb2IrJu9_nIWgZu21g,1,0,4,GODYZnY7DeL0yGUhoT3Mjw

So as he keeps rolling and betting against himself and winning and laughing and other people are laughing and angry because he is a crazy drunk, Morgan isn't paying a lot of attention to a whole lot else. Luckily enough, he apparently has the cocktail waitress set to 'fill 'er up' as she keeps coming around with Crown 'n Cokes and happily putting them in his hand. This behavior continues until the point at which Morgan has 3 Crown 'n Cokes stockpiled under the table with another one in his hand. He drank them all, we lost all our money, but had a glorious time of it. Fun spot.",yfVbdcHTyb2N-2MI4Z9dGw,1,1,5,fii7wckFyNMTJrNQpHvrrw

They have a FREE shuttle that takes you over to their sister casino, Gold Coast. Although you may not want to go to Gold Coast, it is beside the Rio and across from the Palms. Saves on taxi fare and you don't have to stay at Barbary Coast or Gold Coast to hop on that shuttle.",ArG0ajKB734u4BAZUy11lw,3,0,5,qixDALEBDd2EskXvKpxsPQ

It's still Barbary Coast according to the taxi drivers. And if I wanted to get where I was going, I had to inform the taxi drivers that I was staying at Barbary Coast.

Best location at best price ever. C'mon $80 bucks a night. Who are you kidding? Why would you stay anywhere else for center strip views and proximity? My room had views of Paris and the Bellagio fountains. It was equipped with a mounted flat screen tv (see pic). The room was huge and clean. The bathroom had its own full sized ironing board with iron. I had tons of space. I am so happy I chose Barbary Coast over some of the other economy hotels. Security and Front Desk service is great also.

I've been told that the prime rib is bomb at Barbary Coast. Heard good things about Drai's also. Seems like everyone likes the Barbary Coast.",-x1516ZG5GllZiBjDQlRkA,1,0,4,-A-HDK1_6_Vd5KQPvI4nCQ

Also you don't need to take a cab to get there (obviously assuming you're staying on the strip and let's be honest if you're a yelper you're staying on the strip). Additionally the ""charm"" sorta grows on you and the games are more than fair (5x craps, NSUD, and two deck bj w/o the completely sucka' 6:5). Above all though it comes down to the drinks. They do give you beers in tiny cups but the place is small and there are lots of cocktail waitresses. Play at the tables and you're going to get drinks. Play at dollar machines and you're going to get drinks. Hell, one time I actually had to turn away waitresses while I was at a nickel machine! They're egalitarian about their alcohol service. So let's all just hope that Harrah's doesn't buy them up, tear them down, and turn it into another completely lame strip casino w/o the class, the games, or the drinks - because then we really would have to take a cab downtown...",Q5pNxamvrpZUn8TbYEVIBA,2,0,5,MVUvOg2GvTHoSpI9OdtERg

The location's great.  Next to Bally's, Paris and across the street from Caesars.

The casino is smaller.

Lower limits compared to other casinos on the strip so always very lively and packed.  Very packed.",PYRIiQilTl1rkx83hm8ttA,1,0,3,L6Uc8KRcSpr8ELzKEFluhg

3194187,2006-04-19,0,GHwn0lza-JdaETNbOw98oA,"After swearing I wasn't going to gamble in Vegas, I ended up playing slots at the Barbary Coast while the boy played craps.  I put $20 in the machine and played for almost an hour off of that amount, in the process getting two free drinks.  While I didn't win anything, with the drinks factored in I probably broke even.  Also, my craps playing boyfriend liked the $5 minimum tables and even ended up walking away ahead.  The dealers at his table were very friendly too.  It reminded me of the scene in Swingers were the dealer is teaching the old folks how to play.  

Barbary Coast isn't fancy, but it's got a charm that some of the newer casinos don't have.  The decor grows on you and I thought it was great that instead of the fancy food choices some of the other casinos offer, they had a hot dog stand.",eCcjxh8zjAqn-kZVWZ_HJQ,1,1,5,6Tsv6FbvEUqG6zjzpM_pFg

Perfect location right in the middle of the strip. 
Least amount of walking from your room to gambling.
Friendly staff (always willing to help, quick and strong with the drinks, talkative dealers)
Clean rooms with flat screens.  
Cheap.
Fat Elvis.

Sure, it's no mega resort.  Sure the gambling floor is small and the restaurants aren't the best.  But, it's one of the hidden gems of the strip that will surely be gone in a few years.

We went to get a meal down on the casino floor.  We ended up walking out without buying anything because it was extremely overpriced and from what we saw on other peoples tables, It was not worth it.",I1q2FV7sNycUgNvekpr-3g,2,0,4,KBOU5Iy-htX-S4hDQNIoHg
4258128,2006-09-16,0,GHwn0lza-JdaETNbOw98oA,"I can't attest to anything but the fabulous-ness of the casino here.  I didn't stay here...we were at The Mirage (just down the Strip).  But, please, I loved this place.  My friend loved it even more, as she won $160 at the $5 blackjack table.  It was her first time playing.  I couldn't believe it!  As bitter as I was (just kidding, I was happy for her, really I was), I enjoyed myself too.  

This place strikes the balance between ridiculous ""see and be seen"" casinos and creepy, dirty places that make you feel violated. The dealers were so friendly and helpful.  They have $5 blackjack tables all night long. The bartender was a total sweetheart and the cocktail waitresses were seriously attentive.  The free drinks were a great conciliation prize for my money-losin' ass!  

The best part of our Barbary Coast experience, however; was the awesomely cheesey 80s cover band that played from about 1:30 - 2:30 am!  They helped me rally for another 2+ hours of Vegas debauchery. I was sad that they only played for one hour, especially because they busted out more than one Pat Benetar song .  

This place made my hazy, over-the-top Vegas experience that much better!",KyWWK9Rhb_2Lkq0BeBIE1A,1,1,5,cy1C7K6G7Fn61-ZQyQBHdw

Las Vegas pretty much blows, as its just an arms race to see who can make the biggest energy-wasting eyesore.  

However, the ""Victorian Room"" cafe and restaurant at the back  end of the Barbary Coast (next to the glass souvenir case and magazine rack) serves a delicious cheap meal, perfect for down-on-their-luck not-sure-if-i'm-dehydrated-or-hungry-or-just-drunk folks.  Two bucks for all drinks, although they serve imbibables in little plastic dixie cups.  And it's pretty hard to pretend to be a high roller, considering that is the same kinda cup you use to gargle at the dentist's office.  

But the special meal deals that kick in between 11pm and 7am are a great find.  $3 for pancakes, bacon and toast.  $7 for a delicious steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns and toast.  $13 for a prime rib that is, according to a friend, better than a Ruth's Chris.  

A highlight for a city of fakes, this place is true.  What ""stays in Vegas"" is actually your money.",mE2RJWK_87Hb2yy8QnzIRw,1,0,4,-wh086Vhnc6ansn-xayjPQ

The other day I was playing Pai Gow poker and I couldn't even make it past 8am! I was practically passing out during my comped breakfast at that awful mess of squishy leather booths they call a restaurant.  Get with the program, guys. The Orleans knows how to do it - next time you light a cigarette, notice how strongly the match burns.  They've got that shit turned up to LUDICROUS.
