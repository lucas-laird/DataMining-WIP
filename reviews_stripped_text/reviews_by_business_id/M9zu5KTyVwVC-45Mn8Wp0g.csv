633342,2017-08-24,0,M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g,"I was excited when I saw an authentic Chinese restaurant opening up on the sw side of town and it's close to me. Had the chance to try it this Saturday aug 19th and wasn't too impressed. 
1- inside was clean since the building was brand new. Nice decor. Typical Chinese stuff. 
2- food was ok. We order appetizer pig ears with peanuts.  Lacked flavor. Probably should've let it marinated a lot longer. Clams with black bean sauce was ok. Chinese broccoli with salted fish. Broccoli was over cooked. No crunch to it. Was soft. Then we got fresh steam fish which was good. 
Wish was more scallions on it. 
3- rice cost extra?? Since when do you charge for a bowl of rice. Two of us order 4 dishes. And the usual Cantonese restaurant gives you free house soup. Not this place. No soup or free rice = not good. I rather just drive to Chinatown. 
4- wait staff was your typical Cantonese restaurant. After our waitress took our order we didn't see her again. Food came out really spread apart. Got the clams first. Then Marinade pig ears. 15 min later the fish. And lastly when we almost done with dinner the broccoli came out.",7vtqdgiiBge1UmhjgjFsqQ,3,0,2,O1xKBOT51JpR2X4FIMtbTg

Our waiter seemed to recognize my parents so our experience with service is biased but it seemed pretty efficient and helpful. Not a budget dinner option but the entrees are presented well, cooked well, and tasted delicious. The salt and pepper fried pork chops were superb. Dry sauteed string beans were good, but I would have preferred a bit more ""sear"" or ""char"" to them. The white wine chicken was just ok with not a lot of flavor. I think the quality of the entrees probably depend on what you order, but given the overall picture I rounded up from 3.5 to 4 stars. This is probably a good place for large parties or family events as well if you're interested in a banquet-type option as there are ample tables and seats.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,3,4,4,cLr--otFVEXEnsn68nePKw

1352458,2018-01-17,0,M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g,"Came here for dinner with family last night for the first time since opening. As some may have previously said, the owner of this restaurant also owns the Ohana Hawaiian BBQ restaurant chain, which he also had put a new location next door as well. This entire building was newly built and renovated just for these two restaurants. 

The interior design of the location is very nice and elegant. Upon entry of the restaurant, a large chandelier with a large glass wine shelf to the left. The restaurant space has about 10 large tables with about another 8 smaller tables. They also have 2 separate private rooms in the back with 1 large table each, but the rooms are NOT connectable. The private rooms has a karaoke machine as well. 

Service was quick and we had placed our orders pretty fast after we decided. First thing to come out was the Peking Duck, served two ways. The duck will be brought whole on a cart for a live demonstration of the cutting of the hot, SUPER CRISPY skin cut to serving size portions and plated to be eaten with fresh, steamed buns, chives, cucumbers, and green onions, topped with hoisin sauce. That is the first way to eat it. After the skin is removed and served, the rest of the meat and carcass is returned to the kitchen, meat removed and diced, and cooked to be served as lettuce wraps. Piping hot diced duck meat and other veggies wrapped in a crisp iceberg lettuce cups. YUM ! 

We had also ordered snow pea leaves w/ garlic, fried salt & pepper pork (this was accidental as we changed it during the order but i guess the waitress didnt hear it, but its ok), large pork intestine with preserved veggies and bell peppers, black pepper beef on a sizzling plate, seafood tofu casserole. 

Overall most dishes were pretty decent. The only weird one was the black pepper beef on a sizzling plate. The beef used was not cubed or in larger pieces like most/all other restaurants but slices like you'd get from dry beef chow fun, and a severe lack of black pepper as it was as expensive of a spice like saffron. Lol 

The unique thing is this place does not serve rice in a pot, but served in individual bowls. Pros and Cons. Pros, it looks nicer on presentation. Cons is it requires a waiter/waitress assistance for refills, and sometimes it may not be as hot (weird that it should be since they should theoretically be taking it from the rice cooker). 

Overall, a good restaurant. Nice setting. Good for those who live on the SW side (mountains edge, etc) from not having to travel too far (chinatown, etc) for decent chinese food (no i hate panda express. thats not chinese food. id rather not eat than eat that)",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,3,4,qEQs6Dic0X8eecBBuDoACA

We got there on a Wednesday night at 7:30 and they told us just a second for a party of 7. But ended up taking exactly an hour get seated. We tried to order our food as quickly as possible since it was already 8:30. The food probably took about 35-40 minutes to come. The servers seemed really new with their jobs and didn't know how to ""serve"" us. 

The food was good, though. I really enjoyed it. I especially liked their peking duck, which they cut and serve right in front of you!

I would probably come back again on a day not during dinner rush or try to make a reservation.  I can't pass up a Chinese place with good quality food right by my house!",KLUvRyRDUftXgFvUx50Kyg,7,0,3,pcmeWbUPUAqhqEm4UB2GpQ

It is very spacious, they have a bar space, tables for small parties, tables for big parties and two private rooms. 

Service:
They were friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. There weren't that many people when we went so their staff was very tentative to us. 

Price:
The price of the food was pretty expensive compared to other spots in Vegas but if you're coming from out of town, It ranges from where you come from. Since I live in California, most the food here was cheaper than what we find in the Bay Area. 

Food: 
The fish ball with vegetables was really unique and delicious. I would rate that dish a 5 star because I have never had It at other Cantonese spots, however the rest of the food would get an average of 3 stars.

1881664,2017-09-01,8,M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g,"Finally opened! We had been eyeing this restaurant since their sign was up during spring. Like someone mentioned, the owner also owns the Ohana Hawaiian bbq properties in vegas. 

We came during lunch and were pleased that they had a lunch menu so we ordered a couple items off that. Items ordered:

Hainan chicken garnished with crispy fried shallots, seasoned rice, corn veggie stirfry, cucumber slices with sweet soy and ginger dipping sauces. Lunch portion was good enough for us, even though it doesn't seem much meat on the plate. They included dark and white meat. Chicken was juicy, not dry and quite flavorful! Would have liked the rice to have a little fat in it but that's just a personal preference. I strangely enjoyed snacking on the crispy shallots lol

Two choice bbq combo with roast duck and bbq pork, steamed celery, plum sauce on the side. Roast duck was seasoned just right, not salty at all. Skin was crispy, meat was moist! I didn't have any problem with bone chips like at other restaurants and there was a good amount of meat. One thing that bothered me was that there were still some feathers on the skin and you can definitely notice it when contrasted with the darkness of the skin. I had to pluck them off as best I could as I ate. But some people don't mind that. And OMG the bbq pork was so good! It was actually tender! None of that hard chewy crust that can tire your jaw. I didn't expect much but it blew our mind lol not too much fat or overly greasy either. 

Xiao long bao/ pork soup dumplings arrived steaming hot in those cute like ceramic ladle-like soup spoons. Each dumpling rested on a slice of carrot which I assume is to help it from sticking to the spoon. You can tell they were handmade, but the skins were thick. There was some soup inside but the longer you wait to eat them, the more the dough seemed to suck up the soup especially because of the thickness of the skin. They're served with julienned ginger in black vinegar of course- SO YUM. We still enjoyed them and are glad we tried them. We would probably still order them next time.

Egg drop soup was delicious! Ordered it without veggies. Added a touch of white pepper to it and it was perfect. Tons of flowing, silky egg, consistency was not too thick and seasoned just right. 

Lunch specials do come with rice so we have yet to actually order rice during dinner time. Wish they gave you the option for a small serving of soup rather than family size but I'd gladly take the leftovers and eat them at home!

Price was definitely right for what we got. BF commented that this place is on par with LA's authentic Chinese restaurants when it comes to the quality and taste of the food which he loves.

Btw, Fantastic service at an Asian restaurant, you kind of get thrown off by it lol. The two servers, one female one male, were so attentive throughout the meal. Waters were refilled and not once ever got empty, finished dishes were removed promptly, and he even packed our leftovers to-go personally. Not once did we feel like we were rushed as we ate. They even checked back to make sure everything was okay partway!

4 stars for taste; 1 for convenience (for the folks living in the southwest), but minus 1 star for long wait (service was friendly, but the food came out in between loooonnnnggg intervals). 

Also, I've never had black sesame Mochi dumplings with almond milk dessert soup before (usually it's clear broth, and the dumplings are sweet). Oh. My. God. It's so good.

1963065,2017-10-19,2,M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g,"Exceeded my expectations. First off, the place is so nice. Modernly decorated, clean, very spacious, not crowded to where you bump into each other like many other Chinese restaurants. Dinnerwares are all new and clean. Really like the vibe and atmosphere of the place. 

We ordered a few things to share between the 5 of us: jelly fish and chicken, eggplant, crispy fried fish, veggies with salted and thousand year old egg, and something else which I forgot. Really delicious dishes, we enjoyed everything we ordered. Food came out pretty quickly. They have unique dishes too, we wanted to try the eel but they were out, so I plan on coming back to try that!

Price wise are they a little more expensive than other places, but the quality of the food is there and I would pay for the nice atmosphere. When going out for Chinese I always expected crowded place where they yell the order to the kitchen, loud clanking of dishes and getting bumped by the staff because they just packed the place too tight. This place is so spacious, they space their tables out nicely so you have your own space.

2013499,2017-10-31,2,M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We were looking for a quick, but tasty, dinner before we headed to the strip to watch the 4:44 Tour. What we got was quick (for the most part, as I'll explain later), tasty, and all-around satisfying. 

The planets must have aligned that evening. For once, my husband knew what he felt like eating. 

Saved from an hour of:

What do you want? 
I don't know. 
Give me something. Anything Pizza? 
No. 
Burgers. 
No. 
Mexican? 
Meh..."" 
on and on ad naseum...

Anyway, he immediately indicated that Chinese food sounded good so I started to search for nearby restaurants and found Taste. 

I decided to give this spot a go due to proximity from home and location away from Chinatown (I didn't feel like battling Spring Mountain traffic before battling strip traffic). 

When we walked in, our party was immediately relieved to find a restaurant full of Chinese/Asian diners. Not just a handful, but entire families making full use of the lazy susans on the larger tables. You could tell they were all enjoying their meals. 

The restaurant itself is almost shockingly clean and bright. The lighting was fantastic for food photos, so I have no complaints here. 

We ordered the roast pork, house special fried rice, salt & pepper calamari, and general tao's chicken. We enjoyed everything. The pork had a beautifully crisp skin, but remained juicy and tender. The salt & pepper calamari had a great crunch and was not lacking in flavor. I especially appreciated the generous serving of jalapenos and garlic. The rice was more on the soy sauce-y side for my preference, but was still great. And the general tao's chicken might be the best I've had, so far. Not long after dinner, we all agreed that we looked forward to chowing down on leftovers after the concert or attempting to go back before they closed at 2AM. Thanks to Jay Z running late, we had to settle for leftovers. 
 
As for service, we did not wait long at all to receive our drinks and place our orders. In fact, we didn't wait long, at all, in general. Food was served quickly, too. Truly, the only fall off in service was toward the end when we needed our check. The planets aligned once again that night as we needed attention at the exact same moment that all of the large families were ready to go. Needing to make our way out, I ended up having to approach the servers' counter near the kitchen to request a box and our bill. 

Price wasn't bad. For 4 dishes and drinks, our bill came out to about $65 before tip. The lunch specials look promising, too. 

I'll need to visit again to solidify my thoughts on this but, for now, it's looking likely that we've found our neighborhood spot!",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,4,1,4,OzXrgFlLZpHpVhF1znS7Yg

Free dessert was red bean tapioca soup. It was very good, thick and not too sweet.
They are a little different from from other restaurants that cater to Chinese clientele. They don't have free house soup, and they give you a bowl of rice instead of the huge container.

From the start I already felt they didn't care to serve us. When we came in it took them 5 mins to come seat us. We literally was looking at the waiter when we entered the restaurant but I guess they felt cleaning a single table required a 2 person job. The entire restaurant was empty and 90% of the tables were already cleaned so I have no idea why they wouldn't seat us.

The food delivered was warm and not hot. It felt like it was just reheated. They did not come and check on us. I was without water for at least 15 mins. That felt like eternity. Let me remind you there was only 1 other party in there besides us. They were on the corner organizing menu instead of checking up on guest. I felt rushed by the waiter as if he just wanted me to eat and pay the check. 

There was nothing special about the food. To be honest I felt I should've just walked over to the restaurant next door named Ohana Grill. It would've been half the price and taste the same or better at Ohana Grill.

I probably will only return here if I'm super hungry for Chinese late at night since they open till 2am.",Q2SqwNL1m9Wt7mlOh5NR_Q,8,0,2,YKkjKNulbiu6AvctbJSxdg

Def Recommend making a RESERVATION. They have about 20-25 tables- ranging from 2-8 people, good for big families
Same owners of Boba Hut and Ohana BBQ- both places have excellent service and quality products. We were probably the least Asian people there and both me and my husband are Asian. Mostly everyone in there was speaking Cantonese. 

Live tank- lobster, crab, talapia, eel where you can pick your own 

Black tea- served really hot and not too bitter and UNLIMITED- perfect palate cleanser for all the amazing food you are able to eat 

WE ordered (see pics)
1) 5 spice marinated beef shank- served cold- spice level 1- served with sliced shallots and cilantro - NOT RECOMMENDED- not a lot of flavor/bland and a lot of fatty pieces with little meat 
2) Egg flower soup- no veggies- VERY BLAND- Not reommended
3) Curry dungeonous crab with buns- THE BEST FREAKING THING EVER!!!!- I AM ALREADY CRAVING this- curry seems coconut milk based with a delicious earth flavor similar to yellow curry. A whole crab is served to you and the shells with the meat and that flavor is to die for!
- you can also get this fried, stir fried, or boiled with many flavors. Def recommend the curry way!
4)Black bean shrimp- normal served with green bell peppers and red onion
5)Schechawan eggplant- NOT SPICY- which was disappointing, and the eggplant was a little bitter- my hubby loved it
6)Side Rice- 1$ for large serving of jasmine rice
7)Dessert-Tapioca red bean soup (Free)- not my cup of tea

Overall the food here is amaZing!! and I will be back esp for that CRAB curry.

We had to assembled the Peking duck parts ourselves (the crispy skin, the veggie) even though we did asked for it to be presented inside the bun, ready to eat. Worst, the soup from the duck was presented in 3 oz cups. The ugly bones, tofu chunks and 2"" mustard pieces were presented on a separate plate! We have never experienced such a  disgraceful way of presenting this elegant dish! Chinese dinner usually ends with a carbo dish, rice or noodle. Even though we told Taste to serve the noodle dish at end of the dinner, it served the noodle right at the beginning of the dinner! Two fried flounder were ordered. They came stacked on top of each other, worst than if we had gone to 99 Ranch supermarket and ordered fried fish to take home.
The karaoke equipment didn't work either. The microphone blasts ear deafening sound. We ran out several times from the private room to the frontdesk near the kitchen to ask for help.

3552471,2017-10-10,2,M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g,"Always makes me laugh when I see a review call a restaurant authentic/non-authentic Chinese food. This place's chef, like any other chef, has his own interpretation of what some very classic Chinese Food dishes are supposed to be. Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. So if you think you know ""Authentic Chinese Food"" and want it? Get on a flight to Hong Kong as soon as you can, and report back.

When I think of Chinese gastronomes I rate it primarily of the focus or lack of extracting the maximum flavor of each ingredient in the dish I ordered.  I ordered the four dishes the server told me were the House Specialties. The Walnut Shrimp stood out. Every flavor of the ingredients used stood out and I enjoyed. Even the traditional bed of shredded Chinese cabbage complemented the dish nicely.

Next up was a dish of Fried Rice. The rice was delicate and not over cooked. The other ingredients added were all fresh and complemented the dish. They didn't drown the dish in soy sauce like you normally see here in Vegas.

I ordered one of their jellyfish dishes and enjoyed it very much. The fourth and last dish was the Chinese stew which was excellent as well. These last two dishes you normally don't see on menus and you should stay away from if your taste buds are thoroughly Mericanized'.

Hasn't been open very long and found the staff pleasant and courteous. Nothing bugs me more than a server that over compensates by bugging you every five minutes. Looked up once when I needed another drink and the server recognized immediately I was in need of something.

Didn't do desert because, as usual I over ordered, and didn't leave any room for it.

This place is not to be confused with the likes of Hakkasan, Wing Lei,  Jasmine or Mr, Chow. You won't see their décor, ambiance, or their prices at Taste.

Looking for a place that aspires to be nothing more than a above average neighborhood Chinese Food restaurant? Try this place. The Chef here will not let you down. And yes, I was the only non-Chinese person eating there.",ThgkcL2WD-V2VFPiYhK4fQ,3,4,4,GY8CcHaSW7TT4287rYNBdA

Garlic eggplant was on point. We were warned it would be spicy, but as long as you avoid the small chili peppers, you'd be fine!
The sizzling plates were a new concept for us with Chinese. Great decision on our point. We got pepper beef and it was absolutely delicious!  Meat was very tender and flavorful. I just wish it wasn't the first item to hit the table, if would have been nice to enjoy it a little hotter. 
We ordered lomein, which was a lovely bonus to see on the menu. You don't see it quite often in Vegas. Again, flavors were on point! And the fresh vegetables were crisp!  
The wonton soup, which I think took the longest, was okay. It was a little too fishy for me. My kids wouldn't even eat it.

We have definitely found our go-to fave for Chinese food in Vegas, and thankfully it's down the street from our house (anything away from strip & all the traffic & tourists is an automatic plus just to begin with).

We've walked in and been seated immediately (place was about half full both times). Service is great and attentive. We love the newness & decor and the open, bright, CLEAN atmosphere. And although we've ordered with our eyes & empty stomachs (aka too-damn-much for 2 to eat in a single sitting), the bill was very reasonable & less than we are accustomed to paying.

As creatures of habit & not being brave enough to venture with the unknown, we always order the usual:  beef & broccoli, bbq pork fried rice, chicken chow mein (skinny noodles), honey walnut shrimp, and won ton soup.  Everything was served fresh & piping hot, and was delicious. The fried rice was slightly under seasoned but nothing a lil soy sauce or sauce from the beef & broccoli didn't immediately fix.  To top it off each time and as a pleasant surprise, they serve a sweet 'soup' - I don't know what each consisted of but they both (different each night) were hot, sweet and good!! And a great way to clear the palette.

There must be a private room for large parties in the back because each night there was an event going on.  Thankfully, our service was not compromised. But last Saturday every time that back door (which was out of our sight) opened there was extremely loud music (not appealing) - the Hubs guessed that it was karaoke back there but I don't know - we didn't ask.  Worth inquiring about though if having an event or needing a private room....again the food, service and price were on point!

The restaurant is clean and love the openness of the floor. I did have to wait a while before being greeted and sat because there was no host/ess when I walked it.

Not to sound biased but I do base the restaurant by its clientele haha. Seeing as most of the restaurant goers were mostly Chinese I knew I was in a good place (that and another friend suggested this restaurant to another friend to try).

XLB, Xia Long Bao. Always a must order item wherever they have it. However, their interpretation was lacking. The soup was not inside the dumpling at all. The filling was mostly pork. Tasted great, but I seemed to get the poorly made ones because there was no soup in center at all. Major disappointment for sure.

The next item I ordered was the Chicken and Jellyfish with Sesame Seeds. The only disappointment in this dish was it did not look like their picture in the menu. The menu shows there was more chicken than jellyfish. But what I got was inverted. More jellyfish than the poached chicken. 

This refreshing yet spicy dish was the highlight of the meal. The coldness of the dish (seeing as it is served cold due to the jellyfish) was what I needed on this hot day. The cooling effect of the pickled radish and carrots helped offset the spiciness of the dish.

I will definitely be back to try more of the menu items with pictures to go with it. I would've given them a rating of 3 for sure but the main dish and their service is their saving grace. I hate having to call my server to refill my water. This shows me that they do not pay attention to my needs as a guest. Here, they were the ones asking me if I needed more water without me asking.

We ordered the crab curry, spicy eggplant clay pot, garlic sautéed greens, house special crispy noodles, walnut prawns, and half a roast duck.

Atmosphere: 5 stars. For a Cantonese restaurant, this space was beautiful, new and well decorated. 

Food:  4 stars the crab curry ( 40 bucks per crab regardless of weight) was delicious!  It comes with plain buns for you to soak up that delicious flavorful curry sauce. The crab is deep friend first so the outside had a delicious crispy coating. By far my favorite dish and was totally worth it. The other dishes were not bad. The walnut prawns were large and crispy. Cooked perfectly so it wasn't too chewy. The crispy noodles were also good as well. The greens were a little tough and chewy. 

Service: 1 stars. 
No one was rude or anything but service was incredibly slow. We had to ask several times for water to be filled and our dessert and bill came 15 mins after we asked for it the second time.   

The food also came out painfully slow. Like one dish at a time. We would finish one dish and had to wait hungrily for the next. We ate nothing together. The last dish to come out was the veggies... Which is really weird because we just ate plain veggies at the end. Our eggplant never even made it out. We had to cancel it because we've been at the restaurant for 2.5 hours already....

But alas, the high expectations exploded.    Ended up ordering the szechuan spicy soup fish, and the Taiwanese 3 cups chicken.   Now, if you don't know the rule, the general rule is, Youre not supposed to order szechuan and taiwanese cuisine in a cantonese restaurant.  Stick with what the restaurant originates from.  Chefs will add dishes to the menu to placate the masses.  

The food wasnt bad, it was good.  I think it was just the high expectations.   The 3 cups chicken came out really really sweet, and really really salty but still had a good flavor..  The szechuan soup fish was also a bit salty.  And it was a bit milder in spicyness.  

I still want to come back.  Next time i'll be trying the cantonese cuisine and see how it goes.  I still feel confident about this place and will give it another shot.

The service was a bit slow and unresponsive due to serious understaffing as they only had 2 waiters on staff, that did the bussing, ordering, cleaning, filling the water, serving the dishes.  Felt bad for them, I think the fault lies with the business owner.

5/18/2018 - I had to change the rating to a 5 from 4.   It's my favorite cantonese style food in vegas, a little on the pricey side, and the private room cost minimum 500 bucks but good.",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,0,0,5,G5XIvtHZj3DtfnFaj2q6cw

We had this filet mignon plate, pork with salty fish, dumplings, and crab with fried rice. To be honest, all these plates were pretty saucy and salty so I would recommend to eat white rice on the side. They also gave us this hot red bean with mandarin orange in it(?) for dessert and that was really good!

Tasted great and they had that perfect slight snappy crunch to them, but still.

5526198,2017-09-25,2,M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g,"This place was decent and I wouldn't mind returning.

Like most of the reviews have said - it's new and in the southwest - so lots of space and the restaurant doesn't smell as much as the older chinese restaurants yet.

The crab curry was definitely a highlight.We also really liked the honey walnut shrimp.  They also had BOGO bubble tea.

I think my implicit issue with this restaurant is that it's promoted as a Szechuan restaurant but everything was under-spiced.  The hottest thing tried was like a 2/5 spiciness compared to other restaurants. 

We got:
Hot & sour soup: 4/5
soup dumplings: 4/5 - can't compare to din tai fung but decent
Salt and pepper shrimp: 4/5 - delicious but the one over at lotus of siam is infinitely better
honey walnut shrimp: 5/5 - really enjoyed this.
Szechuan chicken with jalapenos: 3/5 - why was this dish not spicy??
Broccoli Beef: 3/5 - tons of broccoli. very little beef. Also under seasoned
Pea shoots: 3/5 - underseasoned
Crab Curry: 5/5 - definitely one of the best things there. The buns are also delicious
BBQ pork: 3/5 - little seasoning

Food came out fast and presentation was decent. Just wish they had spicier szechuan food!",BdRMVROS1MXOHxr-bdZv0g,1,1,3,al13glvi6rPrO0R_Q6TOIw

Xiao long Bao 
Spicy fish hot pot 
Salt and pepper pork chops 
Chinese broccoli with dried fish

The soup dumplings were on point.  The hot pot should have had more fish for the cost.  The pork chops were hot, spicy, and tender.  The Chinese broccoli was well done but overpriced.  For the two of us and the 4 dishes it was 54 bucks and all we had was hot tea to drink.  

The service was disjointed and needs to have more structure.  We really don't know who our waiter was as 4-5 people handled the table as they rushed around. 

I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I just can't due to the cost and the haphazard service.  The meal was about 10 bucks more than it should have been.  The service needs to be rethought.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,1,1,4,qCCpnbJ9Mhzl8dTUfUO0Xg

The place I must say is one of the nicest and cleanest looking Chinese restaurant in Vegas, off the strip. The price was also way higher compared to the rest.

I had the following :
- walnut shrimp - really bland, too much mayo 
- Xia  long bao - the soupy dumpling - really tough, skin would stuck to the bottom, tasteless, seemed old 
- sweet and sour Pork- way too sweet and very greasy
-Fried rice - pretty decent 
- eggplant in a hot pot - really really not worth it 

I'm still deciding whether to give this place another shot, maybe I had a combination of the wrong things? But whatever it is, I really feel I wasted my money",zXb9UjXyvMNIOlMWFBD4vg,1,0,3,xlMSGrjogGE6g_iRWAG5Gg

However, some chunks were basically inedible, which at $18, is less than satisfying, and the sauce is a bit too heavy, such that I get very little of the taste of the meat out of the dish. I've had a similar but better incarnation of this dish in Chicago. Not a bad experience,  but not particularly outstanding.

It's nicely decorated inside and I appreciate that this type of Chinese restaurant has opened on this side of town, saving us the drive to Spring Mountain! 

For the food, we ordered Peking duck, lettuce wraps, beef chow fun, egg drop soup, and fried tofu. When the Peking duck came out with the steam buns, it was really cool to see the chef actually cutting the crispy skin off the duck. My bf said he has never eaten Peking duck where the skin was so perfectly cut off from the meat. 

Everything else we ordered was really good and I'd definitely want to come back to try the other dishes such as the fried flounder, fried rice, and maybe another noodle dish. However, the reason I took off a star was because service was pretty bad here. One server took our order and never came back and we had to ask a different server for additional things. They never came back to check on us once and even forget to bring out some things we asked for like soy sauce.
