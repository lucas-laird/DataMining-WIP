34828,2015-06-19,0,1aGNx-7cTXIeBCMVM8X0TQ,This is the slowest pizza hut to ever exist. Over an hour and a half for a delivery that was .6 miles away. Absolutely ridiculous. I could have gotten the order faster if I had placed it at a pizza hut that was further away. The pizza was no longer hot and the wings were disgusting. So disappointed.,lHuQYF26DUB-Nj_UoZnVcg,0,0,1,i325_6eErgL_ZfmDng9fGA

People it's pizza it takes time to cook and the drivers don't get all the green lights on the way to your home, stop complaining and being lazy, try making your own pizza. If you want fast food try McDonald's. Is my pizza late sometimes yes but it's still warm.  Thank you Pizza Hut you guys rock",rbALw5vyXoiu6X_BN_6RaQ,0,0,5,dNdQhJYNj09_WlCcSOcctQ

I had the italian meat and the buffalo they were good dont get me wrong, but i guess I got what I payed for when they are only two for five dollars. The new item pizza rollers witch you recived four per order for five dollars had pepperonni in side witch was nice. the cheese sticks how ever my dog if I had one would not even eat  not good card board yo do not get this joke of a cheese stick no real cheese just crust and powdered cheese.

1057349,2016-11-13,0,1aGNx-7cTXIeBCMVM8X0TQ,"Ordered a pizza for carry out since my room mate does this at least twice a week, I'm not a big Pizza Hut fan but thought it sounded good on this rare occasion. Online it said it'd only take 15 minutes. Cool. Get there right on time and the computer screen says I'm ready. Guy calls out name of girl in front of me, she pays, calls out my name, I go to pay but there's a problem with my card so the guy says he needs a manager. Manager comes out, not a problem very friendly very helpful very quick. Tells me after that the previous cashier will get our pizza out and sorry for the issue with my card. Problem is that cashier wandered to the back and never came back. I think he believed the manager would give us our pizza which is sitting in a pizza warmer in the front but he DID NOT. Little confused we sit and wait 12 minutes til the manager comes back and gives us our pizza looking confused as well. The place was cool until the cashiers miscommunication made me wait a little longer than expected. I'm pretty patient. But what made me knock a star off is that either the cashier or manager left the pizza warmer wide open that whole 12 minutes we waited so my pizza wasn't too hot when it was finally handed to me. Sad face.",0H-zIyvxf94D11173f63xg,1,0,4,T7tDuA6HbeBVNQ8iwcbuCQ
1076929,2018-01-30,1,1aGNx-7cTXIeBCMVM8X0TQ,Called in 4 two topping pizzas for pickup. Asked for parmesan cheese and peppers which cook was reaching for them from under counter when cashier Hannah pushed her hand away and informed me that they were out of both. A little weird to me. Then I get home and noticed how my pizza was cut. Wow good thing I have an 18 month old!,ga1azDQS1BAMooUbiYZEKg,0,0,1,uMBEnR6XEQLPPfZj6erxcg
1479547,2018-03-06,0,1aGNx-7cTXIeBCMVM8X0TQ,"This is by far the worse Pizza Hut I have ever had the displeasure of ordering from. First off, don't falsely advertise that you are open until 11:00 and the call your customer 30 minutes before 11 , telling them delivery is not available. This has happened to me multiple times. If your drivers do not want to stay an entire shift then announce delivery is until 10 or 10:30. This is terrible customer service. There is also constant issues with online orders and repeated technical difficulties and the only real discounts receivable are online. If the occurs then the stores should have call in discounts when the website is down. I have called both the store and customer service to express my concerns and multiple times wound up speaking with someone who sounds stoned to no end or a rep or manager who talks in circles offering no solution. I have also had my card charged 3 times while saying my order was never placed and a agin no offer made to compensate the inconvenience. My last order also placed the pizza was cold and looked like it was tossed around on a roller coaster. Tonight will be the last order I ever place with this company. I order from here once every 1 to 2 weeks and every time there is an issue. I also work in the customer service/F&B industry and am very understanding to mistakes but this place is out of control. Definitely fed up with this place.",iJwZ3dv-sOVyL-msLcFn3A,0,0,1,Wxr4HfnsyS7eBHbov7rFQw
1549642,2013-12-08,1,1aGNx-7cTXIeBCMVM8X0TQ,Terrible management and who ever answers the phone is rude there. I ordered one pizza online with extra sauce received a pizza with no sauce? Called & the guy on the phone took all my info and somehow couldn't find my order. The manager finally says she will resend it I agreed to giving the pizza they delivered back because she said she wouldn't redeliver without receiving it and made it seem like I was lying. Waited for the second pizza yes it had extra sauce but barely any toppings and cheese. Terrible customer service here. The driver was nice and understanding though and did say when my pizza originally went through that there was an order for a pizza with no sauce they probably miss them up this isn't the first time they've done this and the fact they sent me another pizza barely worth eating I'm writing this review.,9stdfPJbEMcl-FBnqTHTkQ,1,1,1,8X57YjaJ_Yj4c2OgM3knQw
1584517,2017-01-26,0,1aGNx-7cTXIeBCMVM8X0TQ,"Update on Pizza Hut (1/25/17):

I ordered two pizzas and some boneless wings on their Wing Wednesday promotion.  While the pizza was good, the wings were a major issue.  I ate one boneless wing and thought it was a little too soft.  When I bit into the second one, it felt softer.  After opening that wing up, I saw that it was raw....completely pink with just the breading looking cooked.  I sliced open a few more of the boneless wings to see that each one was completely raw.  

Needless to say, I contacted the store to see what they could do about the raw chicken.  I was transferred to two different people, with the final person as the manager on duty.  He apologized and said that because it was ""Wing Wednesday"", they were very busy and I must have just gotten a bad order of wings.  I was given a choice of a new batch of wings delivered to me...cooked a bit longer...or a credit towards my next purchase.  While I wanted a credit back to my payment method instead of a credit towards a future purchase, I guess their machines cannot handle refunding partial amounts of an order.  

It's too bad...I love Pizza Hut, but a raw chicken experience has made me not want to order from them for quite a while.",xVA0VhGnf0dBjP9K6FgK9w,0,0,2,dKIEIj_bvh4G3xXpBaV7BA
