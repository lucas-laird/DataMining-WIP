I ordered a turkey bacon guac, and he slaps raw bacon on my sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware of the limited people who are willing to work overnight at a subway, but I mean come on, have some standards for your hiring process. Like any human with a brain in my head, I asked to have my bacon microwaved. From that moment on slim shady coped a nasty attitude with me. He literally slammed the microwave door. Watch out everyone, we've got a tough guy over here. Apparently I had made his job so overbearing that he had to display his undying teenage angst. Then the tip on the iceberg was that he had to go open a new thing of guacamole. Man, what a tedious sandwich. First, he had to lift bacon into a microwave and press a button, now he has to cut open plastic? My god, what a hard life. He finally came back after a questionable amount of time preparing pre-made guacamole, I'm sure I ate some spit tonight, and he then slammed the guacamole bin into its spot. He wrapped my sandwich and shoved my chips in the bag like his life depended on forcefully  making my sandwich. He wouldn't look me in the eyes, and I'm glad he didn't, it was probably obvious that I was uncomfortable and utterly concerned with whoever is in charge of your hiring. Not to mention he had a downtrodden sloppy looking friend sitting in the corner with his failed attempt at a man bun just creeping the night away. I know people with down syndrome who could run a better subway. Get it together.

I went straight to the register considering I wasn't ordering a sandwich and the cashier or an employee who I thought was a cashier completely ignored me! She just continued to check herself out for lunch, and did not say one word to me, not even when I was in her way to swipe her credit card she just worked her way around me standing in front of the machine and kept on doing her thing. I even said ""no sandwich just these two please"" and she walked away with no words!

2674434,2018-02-10,0,kRRtnGLDTTfKyeuwjh8Blg,"What is it with this neighborhood?  Subway isn't fancy, it's not supposed to be.  So I guess I should expect nothing but to be disappointed.  I got my hopes up and was let down again... and it's not just this place aside from a couple sit down places nearby, most places over here are just disappointing.

I wanted some pretty basic stuff on my sandwich but what I got were remnants from the bottom of the containers... tomatoes you can see through because they are so old, bell peppers I didn't ask for, way too many onions, barely any pickles and olives (even though I asked for a lot), and only enough spinach to see it when the sandwich is closed but when I opened it to remove the peppers half the sandwich didn't have any.  I also asked for banana peppers and none of those too.  And there is a vinaigrette I asked for that didn't make it on here either.

Sure it may be trivial, but hell... even a half-assed effort would have produced a better result.  Is it this neighborhood?  Is it the employees?  I mean if you have dreams of bigger and better why not show that work ethic and do your job the best you can while you are planning your next big move?

I haven't been to Subway in so long that I pretty much forgot their entire selection of sandwiches, except for the obvious meatball marinara one. I didn't want to hold up the line, so I just ordered the first one that stood out to me, which was the Spicy Italian - pepperoni and salami, topped with cheese. I probably would've ordered something else if I actually took a second to read the description rather than order by picture. I got it on the Monterey Cheddar bread, not toasted, with provolone, cucumbers, green peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, and chipotle southwest sauce. The service was very speedy, just not very friendly or talkative, and I was in and out in about 4 minutes. 

*Tip (if you care about nutrition facts!)
If you look up your sandwich on the Subway website, you can actually pull up a customized nutritional info chart on exactly what you ordered. I almost want to cry looking at mine.

Sometimes when I want to ""change it up"" or go to another location by work, this is the place.

The people are friendly - it does get really busy during lunch.  

Sometimes what you would think are the front doors or locked - but the other pair of doors around the corner usually facing Fort Apache are always open.  There are a lot more tables to sit at here, but it does make it seem a little bit more crowded.

Again never looking at me. While I watched he made fun of another lady for picking up the wrong drink from the cool. He made comments like "" I charged her for apple juice and she got a juice box oh well not my money""  and once the line was done he was speaking to his coworker using foul language like G D this and F that.

So if you like a foot long for yourself or want to buy a friend lunch you can treat both of you for about $6, that's a bargain!!

The staff was pretty clueless, there was one guy working the counter helping a foreign couple in front of me that English was a second language too. It was taking them quite a while to figure out what to put on the sandwich. Meanwhile one of the other guys was walking around with a broom and pretending to sweep. There were 3 employees working, the 3rd guy was hiding in the back doing who knows what. Finally the only one really working asked the guy with a broom to help me and he didn't even know his name.

5526833,2013-05-13,3,kRRtnGLDTTfKyeuwjh8Blg,"How many Subway employees does it take to make a sandwich? 

In the mail this month we received an entire page full of the same Subway coupon: buy one 6 "" sub plus any drink, get one 6"" sub free. Basically this equates to a whole month's worth of buy one get one free eating, so how could we resist?

We were headed to an outdoor concert in the park and stopped in to pick up some healthy sandwiches. Our visit starts off by being cut off in the parking lot for a front-row-joe parking spot.. oh well I can always use the exercise... turns out the guy wasn't even going to Subway so I am not sure why he needed that exact spot. When we walked in there was guy #1 behind the counter helping a foreign couple with their order.  There was guy #2 sweeping the empty restaurant. We weren't greeted for a while because guy #1 behind the counter was overwhelmed trying to understand the order of the couple in front of us. They didn't speak English very well and had strange requests like adding an egg to their turkey sandwiches - but just one egg, split between two sandwiches.. he kept thinking they were trying to order an omelet. 

We didn't even realize there was a 3rd employee because he was hiding in the back, apparently too busy to come and help up. We weren't too upset about the wait, more humored by the strange order from the folks in front of us. Finally guy #1 behind the counter yells, ""Hey, what's your name?"" Guy #2 sweeping responds back with his name. Guy #1 then yells, ""You wanna come helps these two?"" To which guy #2 sweeping says, ""Yeah, just a sec."" We wait while he finishes sweeping and then washes his hands. He comes around the counter apologizes for the wait and takes our order. But it's apparent he's new because he doesn't know the names of the sandwiches (didn't understand when I ordered a black forest ham and turkey) and gets confused about how much meat comes on it, etc. He has to ask the guy #3 in the back for assistance. It was quite the process! We finally get our sandwiches made and I hand over the coupon. Guy #1 tells me the sandwich and drink are both free, but gets confused entering the coupon and also has to ask guy #3 for help. Turns out the drink was not free, so we buy the drink, take our sandwiches and walk out shaking our heads at what a hassle it was.

I'm sure we'll be back to use another coupon this month, but I'll make sure it's not on a day that I'm in a hurry.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,3,1,3,QXVd99cH8_RGMpqkYzss9A
