38295,2016-05-22,0,e9q0RPoKoja0C4Q_a6cnZA,What business closes but leaves their front door UNLOCKED!!! Well Smoke's did and I'm highly upset. Checked on Yelp and the website for the closing time. It clearly said Saturday at midnight. So we arrive just before 11:30pm. The door is unlocked and we walk inside. Stand there for a few seconds looking at the menu and young girl approaches saying the business is closed and has been since 11pm. I asked well why is your front door unlocked? She couldn't give me an answer. So I said why does you website and Yelp say you close at 12am? Still no answer. I've been to the Smoke's in Vancouver and it was amazing. Well too bad I didn't get to check out this location and won't be back. Do your business a favor and update your store hours on Yelp and your website. And when you close its best to lock the front door especially when there are shady characters hanging around outside. Teach your staff a thing about customer service. It wouldn't have hurt to show some courtesy to give out coupons for the trouble and mistake in hours posted.,es-YpvZpSdaWNLV7rxlmrg,0,0,1,0KKhClrZleR8cfn0hGbz4Q

1231951,2016-03-12,1,e9q0RPoKoja0C4Q_a6cnZA,"Like the actress Imogen Poots, poutine is a beautiful thing wrapped in a horrible name. As my husband says, if they called it ""cheesy gravy fries,"" everyone would love it. As it stands, few people outside Canada have tried it. And that's a shame, because it's one of the best foods out there!

Thankfully, this American girl can now get her poutine fix close to home. Located next to the store made famous on ""Pawn Stars,"" this walk-up stand is a branch of the popular Canadian chain, and hopefully its tourist-filled location will help spread the Gospel of Poutine. 

The menu is simple and straightforward, with three sizes (snack, meal, and Wow!) and several topping options (including beef, chicken, and vegetarian items). My husband and I split an order of traditional poutine (brown gravy and cheese curds) and double pork (pulled pork and bacon). Although I had my doubts about adding toppings to the already-delicious traditional flavors, I was blown away by how good the double pork was. The sweet pulled pork and the salty bacon nicely complemented the gravy and cheese. Our meal size portions were HUGE -- big enough that I had leftovers. And the prices were reasonable: just under $20 for both orders.

Although I'm still full from lunch, I can't wait to return to Smoke's. I've already got my eye on the Philly cheeseteak and the Montr√©al. Vive la poutine!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,1,5,Wk8I3mA3psS1OCiyWc9X5w

The snack-size traditional poutine is amply sized and priced ($6) for the name, and comes with fresh, skin-on fries topped with layers of fresh cheese curds and a splash of gravy. I do like that they layered the toppings so the bottom half of the order was not dry and boring. The fries were sauced just right so they were nicely soft but not soggy. Flavor in the gravy itself was lighter than expected but still savory and enjoyable.

Props for having vegetarian options available!

If you plan on getting poutine, you should consider consuming about 5 minutes after preparation. This will give it adequate time for the cheese curds to melt.

The poutinerie is authentic to the ones in Canada. They have all of the classics, including country gravy and cheeseburger. The staff is very helpful when answering questions and are willing to go the extra mile to ensure your poutine experience is awesome. We sat outside and the staff checked on us a few times, even though they were prepping to close. 

Out of all of the poutines I've tried at Smoke's, I feel like nothing beats the traditional poutine. The cheeseburger poutine was peculiarly similar to Sonic's chili cheese cony. My last comment is that this food did not quite provide a good bang for the buck. You can get Jones soda and they've got a new flavor each month!

One of my favorite memories of Montreal was the poutine and I was there last October and ate my share, thinking I will not have real poutine for a long time. My dreams were answered, upon my return I was told we have a poutinerie in Las Vegas!

We arrived at 11 pm on Friday night, it is always nice to have a late night snack that satisfies the late night out and one that will not charge the price of a kidney! I have raved about poutine and my friend Heidi was dying to try it, so here it goes.

If it is your first time to try poutine I suggest getting the fries gravy and cheese and smoked meat. This is the basic one but it will give one a fair assessment of what it is about. Trust me you cannot go wrong with any combo but it is so good on its own!

I was sad because while I was in Montreal I had stomach issues and realized that flour was in the poutine gravy so tonight I was a spectator to avoid a stomach flare up. I mentioned it to the girl at the counter and she told me the Poivre gravy is GLUTEN FREE! The Gods were looking down upon me, so I ordered a bowl too! I ordered the basic and I was in poutine heaven, it is so good! My friend loved her bowl too!

The parking, yes the lot is small, for late night grubbing the lot was empty so we were in luck. I can see where one may have to plan for this outing, but remember it is the Strrip and I do not expect hotel/valet parking.

This is a takeaway establishment so eating in the elements of Las Vegas could be an issue. It was 42 degrees and to be honest I was not looking forward to eating fast in the cold. Just as I had the thought the counter girl suggested we go to the BBQ place next door,  they will not mind if we ate in there. This is the perfect solution, they serve beer, and trust me it is another pairing that will make one happy!

Smoke's Poutinerie is a chain that originated in Canada (to hardly anyone's surprise) and has a number of outposts in its southerly neighbor. One of the more recently added locations is nestled in the corner of the first floor of Pawn Plaza, a small and colorful set of shops near the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (made famous by the TV show Pawn Stars) and owned by Rick Harrison of said pawn shop.

The first time that I tried this eatery (or any sort of poutine, for that matter) was in a very difficult scenario - namely, an amateur team eating competition. It was a race, so we had precious little time to wolf down the fries, gravy, and cheese curds. I knew I'd have to wait until a future opportunity for a real shot at experiencing this Canadian creation, and I found a great chance when I learned of their free poutine offer.

After mentioning/showing their Facebook post and whipping out my Nevada ID (free upgrade from snack size to meal size), it was a few short minutes until my piping hot food was ready. I slowly started to eat the poutine, and I was quickly glad that they'd offered the bacon as a topping. The flavor of their poutine gets a bit boring otherwise, as does the texture of their soft, thick-cut fries (think Five Guys, not steakhouse). The gravy doesn't do much for me, but the cheese was very nice.

But that bacon was boss. It held the whole thing together. When I ran out of bacon near the end of the box (which indeed is a meal-size portion), I had to douse the soggy remnants in ketchup and a light squeeze of sriracha sauce just to get through the end. It's a chore if you don't add toppings, so trust me when I suggest ponying up for the specialty poutines (such as delightful bacon poutine).

I'm not sure if Smoke's Poutinerie delivers a great traditional poutine, but it can put forth a delicious meal nonetheless. It's something I'll have to keep in my mental map, and it's worth your while if you're a fan of starchy, fatty goodness.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,5,4,swyNcwBfkmaTODOX-PvuVA

I came here the other day to pick up lunch for myself and some co-workers. Our order consisted of three meal sized poutines. One bacon poutine for my boss, one traditional for a co-worker and one country style for me. On the website I saw a perogy poutine which is what I really wanted but it isn't available at this location. It took kind of a long time to get my order as there were a few people ahead of me when I got there. I was told they cut and fry the potatoes fresh to order so it could take while. They weren't lying. Our meals took a long time but sure were steaming hot when I got them. I only wish I wasn't waiting for one more meal for a friend who went with me. My food started to cool by the time got back to the office.

Regardless of the cooling, our poutine was still pretty hot when I delivered lunch. Hot enough that the cheese curds were still gooey. The first bites of the fries with gravy and cheese were amazing. Plus I had all this other goodness on mine. Bacon, chicken, peas, mushrooms and grilled onions. It was a huge meal and I wasn't able to eat it all in one sitting. Neither was my boss. We were both pretty full about half way through. We were also very thirsty. It turns out this poutine stuff is very salty. Salty fries. Salty gravy. Salty bacon. Mildly salty cheese curds. It was just too much. I kind of wish I had ordered just a snack size traditional poutine. Although, my co-worker who ordered the tradtional said she was a little disappointed. And she is from Canada where this snack is from. To be fair though, she said she was usually disappointed with the poutine in Canada too. The concept, I think, is better than the product itself.

Some final notes to put a cap on this review, parking is aweful at this plaza. Its a small lot and a busy area. Get there early and prepare to wait.  Expect to eat outside. Some of the places here, including but not limited to Smoke's Poutinerie, do not have any seating. Do not go by the menu you see online. Not all poutines are available here and the prices show about a dollar lower than what this one charges. Get a drink. You're gonna need it.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,1,3,0XbZHeucQwSaV2w4XpVa7w

Meat was nothing like for example Schwartz's smoked meats in Montreal.  Gravy was soooo salty.  I am certain my BP went up 50 points.  Otherwise, tasty  but in my opinion overpriced.",4_mc5xJhrxqUxHsqyDZqRw,0,0,3,8eB1XKEA8p1qzfH6q4kgQQ
4271493,2016-03-06,2,e9q0RPoKoja0C4Q_a6cnZA,"Is poutine the equivalent of post hangover food in Canada? Because I can't imagine anything better to eat after a night of drinking. The traditional poutine includes fries, cheese curds and gravy. Smoke's Poutinerie has the traditional option and also specialty options that include everything from bacon, chicken, beef, steak, eggs, mexican style, vegetarian style, etc. We were told their most popular one is double pork (bacon, pulled pork). 
The sizes range from snack, meal size, wow size (example box sizes to the left of the cash register). The snack size can only be done with a traditional or traditional + one topping. The specialty poutines can only be ordered in meal or wow size. 

We ordered the pulled pork and were 100% happy with our decision. The pulled pork was flavored well, sweet and a perfect match to the poutine. The fries were thicker than skinny fries, thinner than wedges. We asked for light cheese curds and they graciously put them on the side for us (I'm not big on cheese, yet I think I would have been ok with the regular amount of cheese) and the gravy was heavy enough that no fries were dry, yet no fries were over drenched either. Good job guys! 

Smoke's Poutinerie is in the Pawn Plaza shopping center (A mini container park?) which is connected to the Pawn Shop shown on the famous TV show. There is seating only outdoors and not very many for the number of restaurants in the Pawn Plaza center. There is plenty of FREE parking on both sides of the Pawn shop! 

I personally would not be able to eat Poutine as a meal and would consider it more of a snack. My friend and I shared the meal size together and it was perfect for us. Sit outside and people watch the tourists, get some dessert next door and check out the famous pawn shop. Easy, free, convenient parking and lots to check out in the area- seems like a great date night! Just don't tell your girlfriend you got the date night idea from me! ;)",8XKSiMpMxgdwI3qjuqmXFg,5,4,4,jatT9pwO-4cSnEFDXNkYjQ
4382293,2016-04-24,0,e9q0RPoKoja0C4Q_a6cnZA,"This is was my first poutine experience. This whole food concept was an unknown to me before seeing it on Yelp. When I decided on Rick's Pawn Plaza as the location of my food crawl I knew that I needed to give this place a try.

Since this was my first time I decided on the snack size of The Traditional. I wanted to get a taste for the traditional to see what it was all about before venturing into other options. The fries tasted homemade and had a nice crisp to hold up to the brown gravy. The cheese curds were the perfect size so that the cheese to fry ratio wasn't overwhelming.

It was fun to try a new food item. I'd definitely like to try some other combinations next time since they offer so many options.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,1,4,qjQplae03ScmNznmyrXdTQ

4996124,2015-11-17,4,e9q0RPoKoja0C4Q_a6cnZA,"I really wish I had a better experience -- I was pretty hungry when I stopped by around 8:15PM on a Sunday evening, and I do love French fries.

The guy behind the counter was really friendly & patient with me as I took time looking at the menu.   I ordered the large box of fries with the *vegetarian* poutine, caramelized onions, and substituted cheese sauce for the green peas that normally comes with it.  Adding a Jones Soda, & my bill was $14 something.   Jones sodas aren't cheap, but over $10 for French fries??!  Time will tell if the tourist prices can last, when the only tourist attraction is the pawn-store 150' away...

I sat down & waited, and my order was ready about 7 minutes later.   There looked to be a waitperson 'working' -- female in her 20s.  For the entire 45 minutes I was there, she just stood & had some sort of in-depth, personal conversation with some customers seated at another table.  Sounded like she either works part-time at Jimmy-John's Subs, or wants to get hired there.  She was also telling them how there would be filing at the pawn store the following day, and when they're filming is about the only time the owners/main characters from the show are ever there.  She sure wasn't working (though they weren't busy, either).  If she was supposed to be a waitress, she failed.  If she's a co-owner or something, she probably at some point should have come to my table & asked if I was doing OK, etc.

When the order taker inside called out that my order was ready, I waited about 20 seconds to see if she was going to pick up my order & bring it to me (& she was closer than I was), but she wasn't at all concerned, and just kept talking to the other people so I hoped up & got my order -- not a big deal at all, however, not the sort of conduct most small businesses have, either.

When I sat back down with my order, my first impressions where that it looked pretty small for the price & being labeled as a large/complete meal, and that I sure didn't get a lot of cheese sauce -- just a very narrow squirting of it atop the fries.

Again, I was really hungry & like fries, so I was very disappointed at the both the collective & individual lack of flavor.  Very bland overall, and even just sampling the vegetarian gravy, cheese curds, fries, or caramelized onions individually showed the components just didn't have much of a flavor for some reason.   The only flavor I got was the artificial green apple flavor from my Jones Soda...

A little before 9PM, the place was starting to close up.  The guy behind the counter came outside to clean & secure the ketchup dispenser, etc. meanwhile, the worthless waitress continued to just ramble-on with the couple customers at the other table. Only when they finally got up & left did she act like she had any connection to the business besides her uniform -- like I said, gotta be the owner's daughter/wife/girlfriend or have some other relationship that allows her to be there without truly earning her keep (sorry honey, but as they say, ""the truth hurts"").

I drive by the place a couple times a week, but unfortunately, I have no reason to ever go back.    I suspect most of the business it (& the other places in the small shopping center) will get is from tourists there to see the pawn store, and that's not going to be enough in the long run. Hopefully I'm wrong.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,2,epGlggD-poqogvUIjL2LEw

I came in on a Friday and drove downtown to try this place! I got the traditional meal size poutine. It was freaking awesome. The cheese curds and gravy were on point. The fries were fresh and crispy. It was made in literally 5 minutes. The selections are great because they have vegetarian options and the oddest meat combinations which sound amazing! I can't wait to try then

They also have jones soda which is freaking awesome and free sticks! Really cute interior and friendly employees. I highly recommend this establishment for a poutine fix, I will definitely come back to try the other!!

This place is very clean and small. There is also a parking lot which is great because parking downtown is a nightmare. :) thanks smokes poutinery!!",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,3,4,5,w9mT1fTKAqCfdtC_lbOpZw

We ended up going together and sharing one, since I had eaten not long before arriving.  Let me preface this review with this: I'm a SUPER healthy eater, as a rule - so this is not something I'd eat all the time (hence the low-ish rating).  But I did enjoy it; both of us did.  It doesn't say so on the menu, but you can change up the sauces on whatever poutine you get, so be sure to try the mushroom sauce.  That was my favorite part about it!  If you're in Vegas and you're looking for some poutine, this is the place to go.

I give them credit for originality with all their unique combos (chicken, beef, steak, etc), but the meal just left me unsatisfied. Always seems like a side item, rather then a main meal for me. Don't get me wrong, I was stuffed.....it's a lot of potatoes and meat.  I think if you like baked potatoes for a meal....this is your place",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,5,3,3,R8IWSNpebmGTL8qg_rprDA

If he complained about lack of parking (tiny lot out back) or the fact that unless you're out on a perfect day, you'll be freezing or burning on the metal seating outdoors, I would agree, but there was nothing wrong with the service.

Smoke's has no indoor seating. It's basically a walkup counter with an area for a line to form inside. You order and the cashier will call your name when it's ready. 

There are 3 sizes - a big one that is 2 lbs. A ""meal size"" which is 1 lb & a ""snack size"" but the cashier said he had never weighed a snack out. Probably about 1/2 the size I'd guess.

Brian and I split a traditional meal sized for $7.99. That felt really pricy for Canada's most famous drunk food. The gravy was very thin but good - I could taste the rosemary. Cheese curds were not what I expected - it was a sort of a cheesestick consistency. I expected more cheese for both the price & mountain of fries.

These are much better than the god awful salt lick poutine at Brooklyn Bowl, but I'd definitely try non traditional next time.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,4,3,aiSjt3AmRhFalNnC2qMyDg

My husband got the Double Cheeseburger which was really good. It had some really nice flavors and the gravy was so delicious, but the combination of everything was a bit salty for my taste. I 'm not sure if they salt the fries before they add the toppings or if it was a combination of everything together. 

I Got the Triple Pork, which I liked a lot as well. The gravy that they used is just super delicious, and I really enjoyed the cheese curds in it too. I just wish there were a little bit more- I LOVE CHEESE. ( I wonder if there is an option to get more cheese or not. The pulled pork was nice and tender, and The cooked the bacon and sausage just right. But my poutine was also on the salty side- couldn't eat much after a while. I bet ya if this one had some thinly sliced onions on it... it would've been amazing- it was just missing something to really tie all the flavors together. 

All in all, I would go here again because it was really good. I'll just ask for less salt the next time i go. PLUS they have Jones Soda which is made from real sugar cane. Awesome",BkWhiifV55jvhOAV-3rdOA,0,0,4,Sox-mYyhUoe4fAOFlKwAbQ

Came here on Saturday 5-7-16 for my very first poutine.  $26.75 got us two poutines, two drinks, and a hot dog.  The restaurant is located in the new shopping center adjacent to the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop.  Parking was surprisingly easy...we pulled into the lot and a lot attendant guided us into a spot since we're locals.  

I got the meal size traditional poutine for $7.99.  It came in a box and the french fries were the kind with the skin still attached drenched in gravy and cheese curds.  The heat of the french fries made the cheese curds all melty.  It was a hefty portion and I was unable to finish the whole box.  

They have many variations and toppings for the poutine and they sell bottled and canned drinks.  I think next time I would opt for the smaller size because poutine is delicious but very filling.  Yay! I'm a fan!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,11,9,4,kWH1K_L6OJ8hsM6y8xvawA
