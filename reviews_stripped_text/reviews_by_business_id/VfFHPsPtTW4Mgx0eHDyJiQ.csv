The food was fantastic and the drinks are reasonably priced.

58007,2015-04-06,0,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,I hosted a private party on the patio for about 35 people. My guests and I were very impressed by the 2 servers that were assigned to my party. They were very attentive and made sure everyone received their drink orders promptly. I worked with Kristyne  on the menu and followed her suggestion to include a vegetarian dish. The food was delicious! It was nice that the manager checked on the party at least twice to make sure that everything was going well and see if there was anything we needed. I would definitely recommend Distill for your next event! The patio is nicely decorated and there is plenty of seating.

I did not leave a tab open and only used my card that one time. My account was frozen and informed me that the charge was from this establishment. Mistake or not that's a pretty dramatic amount to ""accidentally"" charge someones card. How could this have been authorized and overlooked?

The atmosphere is nice. There is a large bar in the center (good luck getting a seat - it's fairly busy) and plenty of seating even at its peak times. There is also a patio area that is relaxing and doesn't get too hot/cool.

Lastly, you have really good servers here. My friends and I have always had positive experiences with the staff here. Our particular favorite is Jade. She's very outgoing and helpful with whatever you need. The bartenders are also friendly and keep the drinks flowing.

I've taken several friends and everyone has said the same thing that they couldn't believe they allow smoking. Today I overheard another couple say the same thing right as they walked in. A few people have said they doubt they would ever go back. It's very disappointing. I went there for lunch again today. We had to move two times to get away from the smoke. This could be a great place. In a day where smokers have options why does a non smoker have to be exposed and have a miserable experience? Management should reconsider their policy.

My roommate and I wanted to go out and try something new. We saw the free whiskey shot with check in offer and figured why not? The first time we came, I ordered the coffee infused whiskey and my roommate got the orange cinnamon infused. We agreed that the orange cinnamon was more our style so that's what we will be ordering from now on. Happy hour is definitely a good deal. $1.99 chips and salsa, $2.99 bruschetta, and $3 well drinks...yum! The chips and salsa were a great deal for only 2 dollars. Spicy salsa and a bunch of chips! As for the bruschetta, the bread was delicious and crispy, good enough to eat alone. But the tomato/onion topping also goes great with it! We ordered fries too that aren't considered happy hour. Just normal cut fries with a hint of salt for about $3. Both of us love fries so we have to try fries at every place we go, and they were pretty tasty here. The well drinks were also a good deal! $3 for a whiskey and ginger ale. They bring it on the rocks though, so next time I will ask for it chilled. Sitting outside just makes my ice melt and waters the drink down. But speaking of the outside..it's wonderful and where we choose to dine every time. They have nice high top tables, and lower seating with couches lining the patio area. Cute fire places and lantern hanging lights. Both times we went was during happy hour but I would come back during regular hours too. It's open 24/7 so we were thinking about trying it in the early morning sometime.

I was kind of bummed that they don't offer buffalo chicken sliders in their HH menu; so instead we ordered Greek fries, chicken lettuce wraps, short rib tacos and chips & salsa. Out of the 4, Greek fries was probably the best. Chicken lettuce wraps was too salty for me and the short ribs tacos was okay - nothing special.

780048,2015-01-22,0,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"Been here a couple of times since my last review (which wasn't very flattering) and had a blast. Kudos to Ronnie & Jade the bartenders for making one experience fantastic. Great bartenders who are laid back and a lot of fun that don't act like they are doing you a favor for being there. 

Due to a step up in service, decided to do a little something different from our usual Sunday Football meetup and chose Distill. Our teams were in the Championship (Green Bay for some, Patriots for most of us) games so we got there early to take up tables and seats right in front of the screens. One thing really nice about this place is the multiple big screen TV's with plenty of tables / comfy seats set up in front of them which makes it a great place to watch the games. 

Right after getting comfortable and drinks ordered, a super nice guy came up to us and introduced himself as Jeff the General Manager. Very genuine and hospitable... not often you have the GM take the time to go around and introduce himself in ""A Local Bar"". Took the time to raise the volume for the TV's in front of us to go along with the overhead volume so we could really hear the games and even came by to check on us to see how we were doing during the games.  Jeff mentioned he has been the GM there for about six months and I could certainly tell the place has improved.

Place ended up being jammed by game time with a great crowd. Ordered up tons of food for table sharing and the orders that really stood out were the Chipotle Chicken Nachos (delicious and huge) and found out why ""The Cure"" burger is rated one of the best in town. 

Overall a great experience. The only things I could point out to have made it a Five Star experience is the Waitress never bothered to even introduce herself / give her name, wasn't very personable and didn't mention any of the drink specials taking place. Found out there was a special for pitchers of Bloody Mary's for $19.95 at the time we got there (after ordering single Bloody Mary's and paying full price to start off the day) and around the 4th quarter of the first game we found out that there was a Miller Lite special for the big 100 oz. self serve towers of beer. We only found out because we asked the table next to us that were ordering them. Kind of would have been nice for her to mention that when we were ordering up single beers and paying more than twice the price for pretty much the same thing. Four big bud lights for $24 a round or $12 for 100 oz of Miller Lite.... hmmm. Kind of a no brainer what to go with if we would have known to begin with.

Guess we should have asked when we first got there. Regardless, still a great time and we left stuffed, tipsy and happy.",OF9gus15zboR9d8Xb-C83w,0,0,4,JecQgcV8bo9zj0WTthblXA

I wanted to try a selection of the menu so my friends and I ordered a variety of goodies! I read another review that the calamari was bad so I had to try it myself. Wrong!!! I swear on the bible it was the best I've had! She needs to order it again. The street tacos were amazing, I wanted to lick the plate! Caesar salad was good...I might get the dressing on the side if you like it light but I loved it. The poppers are not traditional they are actual pieces of jalapeño with cream cheese and fried, hot and yummy. 
For all these people that went opening night you need to give it another chance. I was very happy with the service, drinks and food. I will definitely be going back.

Their menu is pretty impressive.  It is a step up from your average bar food and has a very diverse selection (plus pancakes lovers rejoice, breakfast is available all day!)  My personal favorite item is the avocado eggs rolls.

They staff is pretty friendly.  Our server was relatively new so she was still getting into the swing of things, but you could tell she was trying so I won't judge too critically. 

The interior decor is warm and inviting, and the patio layout is kind of fun.   The bathrooms, however, could use an update.

953854,2014-03-12,2,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"Distill Bar is the old Agave.  The decor hasn't changed much but didn't really need to.

Got here early - around 5.  Wasn't too busy.  Had couple drinks at the bar - my friend won $20 bucks :) - and then sat at a high top table just a few feet away when my other 2 friends arrived.

The one thing that stood out for me was the staff.  Positive attitude and attentive.  From the bar to the table.

We ordered the chips and salsa ($1.99 happy hour) at the bar.  The salsa wasn't bad but the chips just wasn't like Agave when we ordered it was hot and freshly made.

We ordered the mashed potato bites, as we were told it was the most popular.  It was ok.  I guess I expected it to be more crispy on the outside.  I'll try the pretzels or the poppers next time.

Breakfast is served 24/7!  I asked our server for suggestions and settled on the steak and eggs breakfast.  ($11.99)  I forgot to advise how I wanted my steak cooked and wasn't asked so I got it well done.  Bummer as I'm a medium rare girl.  Eggs were cooked perfectly.  Steak was very thin, and had as much flavor as I would expect a well done thin steak to be.

Friend ordered the chicken fried steak special and it came with soup or salad, mashed potatoes and vegetables for $11.99.  He liked it.  Another friend ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast with the sauce on the side and that got confused - amazingly it took only a few minutes to have fresh one made.  The sauce was made with sausage.  Funny part was we had a hard time figuring out the ""sausage"" in the sauce and had to ask.  Our server didn't know and had to ask herself.   That being said it wasn't bad :)

The soup was a chicken and artichoke.  It came out - to me - barely warm.  It was my friend's soup and he was content with it.  But I like my soup hot.  Couldn't even see any steam.

My friend had the black and blue burger.  He loved it.  Gave it three thumbs up!  Seems to be the food of choice as I saw quite a few sliders and burgers at other tables.  I was just hoping the breakfast would've been better as most of the time you can't really mess that up.

sometimes it's hard to get a drink. That could easily be fixed with just a little more organization behind the bar.

We came mid-week, after happy hour. I'd wanted to get here for happy hour, since the prices are incredible for that, but once I saw the very limited food options, I was okay with our arrival time. The patio was open and not too crowded. Erin was our server, and she was great from beginning to end (and we sat for awhile just chatting).

Specialty cocktails are always fun and we tried two of theirs: 

Distiller's Delight -- bourbon-based, not too sweet, very refreshing. Probably my favorite of the two. Also tried the Mad Mule (without the simple syrup). This variation on the Moscow Mule is nice, but the addition of all the extra sugar would be too sweet. As it was, it was pretty sweet with a nice ginger bite at the end. 

Food:

Shrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip  -- Bland, bland, bland and very watery. No cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of lemon juice to brighten it up. The shrimp tasted like the frozen precooked rubbery kind. Mixed in a bit of salsa with it just to choke it down. Told Erin about it and she said that sometimes it's bland and sometimes it's not, it depends on who is in the kitchen. Sorry, but a commercial kitchen ought to have the recipes perfected, especially when it's a basic 5 ingredient appy that has a bunch of 5-star recipe options all over the food websites. 

Chicken Nachos -- Surprisingly good. Once again, not made particularly well, as the chips in the top center were covered in toppings, and then there were a pile of naked chips underneath, but the chicken was good (not spicy as advertised), the refried beans added a salty edge, the cheeses were pretty good, and the guacamole was very good. We used the salsa to save the spinach artichoke dip. 

The chips on both dishes were good, but the items themselves came out only lukewarm, so they were cold halfway through. I've seen this comment on a couple of other reviews, so I think it's an issue with the kitchen. 

Total bill for 2 drinks and 2 appetizers + tax/ tip/ etc. came to $50. Typical Summerlin prices. 

All in all, I loved the atmosphere, the drinks and the nachos. Looked like there might be a few other items to try on the menu. And the inside of the restaurant looked really nice too. So we'll probably be back.",O11n5wP5sq_NtxEGF6dwMA,1,1,4,RkeKW0JopGes2EgvCbrVNA

It came out pretty quick and was actually not bad at all. It cooked perfectly, bun was lightly toasted and came with a generous helping of fries. They have a full bar available with a wide selections of beers on tap. There is a Yelp special of getting their house whiskey for free if you check in but drink at your own risk! All and all, a great place to kick back on a Sunday.",Pt7qwibaqSEGZvxmDjox9Q,0,0,4,dSSuaxFYkC3ZQC3Vjk76Gg

The avocado egg rolls and mashed potato bites were amazing. We also had the pleasure of meeting the general manager Tony Ramieh. He is very personable and professional and according to my friend he is also handsome. We enjoyed it so much we came back for breakfast on thanksgiving morning and we were greeted at the door by Tony who even remembered our names. We had breakfast on the patio the ambience on the patio is also amazing. Friday night 11/23/17 we came for dinner. We no sooner sat down when Tony came over and said hello. He recommended the fish and chips and it was delicious. They have a great beer selection and wine list. I'm starting to think Tony works 24/7. We will continue to come back this is our go to place now. Thank you Tony Ramieh for making Distill not just above average but great,pbdBpbp0TszCyn0b14qI_Q,0,0,5,czuGSAxJIegtO9AZhC_PgA

That burger completely fulfilled my burger desires and then some. It amazes me that this bar and this particular burger are not more popular, as it is a fantastic amalgamation of all the best flavors a burger should have: savory, cheesy, just a bit of spice. It's stuffed and juicy without falling apart, and every ingredient successfully harmonizes with the others. It's a hefty patty, and when assembled with all the fixings it's so tall it's difficult to bite into, and you will make a mess. But it will be worth it, because this is a damn good burger. And a unique one, at that!

I am going to make a bold statement and declare this THE best burger in Las Vegas... for now. It's a competitive city for this title, but the Cure comes out on top.

Excuse the god-awful blurry photos, my haste to devour this amazing meal apparently affected my picture-taking abilities. You'll have to see (and taste!) it for yourself.

However, I had a sort of disturbing experience when it came to the service (aside from it being slow in general). I had gone with a girlfriend, both of us driving about 25 minutes to meet up here in Summerlin since it's a midpoint between both of our neighborhoods. We had been there ordering drinks consistently for 2 hours, then we decided to switch to water since we both had to drive. When we were ready to cash out, the bartender gave us a hard time! He kept saying things like, ""No, no... you're gonna order more."" and LITERALLY: ""Wow, you girls are boring! What are you going to do, go home and take a nap?"" We politely explained that we had been there for two hours, and were being responsible by sobering up before driving home. He CONTINUED by egging us on with ""Well, that's what uber's for!"" and ""Yeah 2 hours is nothing, the night's just starting!""

It's been about 9 months probably since I last had it but unfortunately, it was not much how I remember it! It was about 60% of the size it used to be. It used to be twice as tall. Today, it was about an inch thick vs. about 2 inches, was more chewy and not as fresh as in the past, and didn't have the caramelized nuts it used to have. So I have to say I was disappointed and it certainly was not the second favorite dessert I remembered it to be. 

That being said, I still did enjoy the restaurant. That is the only food item that I had so I cannot comment on the other menu items. I still enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. Although smoky, it is cozy.

Unfortunately, despite it not being very busy, the service didn't match my limited amount of time. I even told the server, when she finally came around, that I had a pretty short lunch hour.   She was quite leisurely, to say the least. 

The menu is pretty extensive, with everything from breakfast to burgers to pizza. Most items were between $10-$15.

I ordered the Blanco pizza, and it was fine, if a little bland. The crust was good, though. Not too crisp, not too doughy. 

The patio area looked really nice, and I wish we'd gone out there, but I completely forgot about it until it was time to leave. 

I'd probably try it again when I can sit and enjoy myself, but if you're in a hurry, I'd suggest going elsewhere.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,0,0,3,d3mSpMmLiokWR_2u1_cWxg

*  Welcome Experience
-  Ordinary - Upon entering the main door I was expecting to find a server or greeter standing there, however there wasn't anyone.  Within a minute or two a lady approached me with a warm smile and told me I could sit wherever I wanted and a server would bring us some menus.  I wish I would of been greeted sooner, but in the end it worked out. 


*  Establishment
-  Outstanding - The design of the overall business is fantastic. Its clean, open, casual, with great music playing in the back ground. There is a pool table off in the corner, a large bar in the center, and a really awesome Patio area.


*  Service
-  Outstanding - Our waitress, and her assistants were awesome! They checked on us routinely, and made sure we had everything that we needed. Wish I remembered the ladies name. I found out that she had worked a double shift and was still cheery and all smiles!


*  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation
-  Outstanding - The Food was amazing. You never know how a place is going to be when they first open.  Wish I would of taken some pictures of the food. The Mashed Potatoes Bites were DELICIOUS!! The Appetizers were well proportioned, and the quality was amazing.  Kudos to the kitchen staff on a job well done!,


* Stuff that isn't important but I felt it was worth mentioning.

They have power outlets everywhere! We were there for a business meeting and I was surprised to find power outlets in the main dinning room near a lot of the tables.  Great place to have a casual business meeting. 

Looks like they could accommodate large group meetings as well. 

The menus were very easy to read, and well put together. 

*  What I'll remember
- The Moscow Mule Drink! AMAZING. and the food. soo good. I will also remember the reasonable prices.  The quick prompt services. 


*  What I can't wait to forget
 
Nothing! It was all quite amazing. And I am a huge critic. This place rocks, way better than some chain restaurant.  They have nice views, and would be a great place to go on a date, or to have beers, lunch, and dinner with your friends.

The vibe is very relaxed. The bar seemed pretty packed. But, You are able to sit yourself in the dining area. Someone automatically brings you a menu & lets us know our server will be with us.

Erin was our server for the night. We automatically checked into Yelp & redeemed our free whiskey shots. We also ordered Mad Mule $10 (which was served at the Yelp event) & a Cinnamon Apple Sour $7. Apple sour was on the sour side & extremely strong. The whiskey shots came in coffee & cinnamon flavored. Yuck! Those drinks did the job done alright!

For food:
Shrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip $9.99 -- it was very very very very bland. It didn't have enough cheesiness. The shrimp didn't blend in well with the other ingredients. A lot of chips, not enough dip.

Street tacos $7.99 -- shredded chicken with usual contents that comes with a taco. It had a chipotle dressing on top. These were pretty good. Still, nothing that made me want to order it again. 

New York Steak & Eggs $11.99 -- beau said it was good cooked perfect. It came with hash browns. & you can choose between English muffin or toast. I tasted it, tasted like regular steak ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

French toast $7.99 -- beau also got French Toast (guess he was hungry). These were excellent. Probably best thing we ate last night. It was light and fluffy. 

Erin, our server, was very attentive. She came and checked on us every so often. She was nice & had lots of personality.

2871947,2014-09-09,1,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"Distill is a local bar located very close to my workplace. I've been in the area long enough to know that the building they occupy is where restaurant and bars go to die. I thought I'd give this place a few tries before reviewing since I've seen the building change hands from one establishment to another and wanted to give them an extra fair shake. 

My first experience didn't leave a very good impression since my coworker and I walked into an almost empty building at lunch time and the wait staff was visibly hanging out while preparing place settings in one of the booths and one of the guys appeared like he was taking a nap. Distill has a decent-sized menu so I asked our server what she would recommend and she claimed everything was good. I ordered their street tacos and the chicken, unfortunately, had the taste and dryness of sawdust. My coworker seemed to enjoy his sliders so I thought that would be the play for my next visit. 

I came back with a small group to celebrate with a coworker who was leaving the company. All the staff seemed awake -- big plus. This time, I ordered a variety of sliders. The philly slider was OK but not worth the calories. The western BBQ slider was like a dry hockey puck. The tiny country fried chicken slider which consisted of 40% bread, 30% mashed potatoes(inside the sandwich), 20% breading and 10% chicken was just inedible. It's probably just my luck that I ordered all the wrong food items. So much for the ""everything was good"" claim the initial server made. 

On a positive note, when I returned to celebrate another coworker who was leaving (a recent trend), I realized this place seems like a nice place to just hang out for a few drinks and watch sports on their large TV screens. Sans food.",HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw,6,0,2,yrmDXs9nTGIZMY9UpCU_5A

Went to the opening last night, and it was packed and loud, but a good vibe and crowd.  There was a band playing, but after talking with one of the owners that won't be an ""everyday"" thing, at least not for now.  Even though it was busy, the servers were quick and prompt and very very friendly and upbeat.  The decor is warmer and more inviting than when this place was Agave, with a lot of lounge chairs and tables replacing the old table booths.  The patio is still there and will be a welcome place to hangout in the warmer weather.  There is also a game room area, with video bowling, golfing, pool table, etc.  And, the ""jukebox"" is pretty cool, with the ability to sync to your iPhone and music playlists.  And of course plenty of  TVs throughout to catch your fave sporting event.

This morning we decided to try out breakfast, since we were running errands in the area.  We sat in the main bar area, and my first impression was ""I don't want to eat in a place that all I can smell is cigarette smoke.""  It's just not appealing.  It didn't seem so smokey the night before, but this morning was a different story.  The menu looks good, and they serve breakfast 24/7.  My husband had the build your own breakfast burrito (sausage, spinach, tomato and cheese), and they forgot the sausage.  I had the patty melt and it was ""meh"".  Not great.  Not horrible.  I ordered a bloody mary...let's just say it needs work.  Like, a lot of work.  I don't know what I had, but it was no where close to a bloody mary, lacking in taste and ""zip.""  Our waitress seemed nervous, and I'll chalk it up to the place only being open for 2 days.  But first impression, she had the personality of a log.  On a side note, the manager came over and introduced herself and was very welcoming, perky and nice.  Like I said, I'll chalk it up to nerves and the newness of it all.

This place has the potential to be a great locals hangout, and the owners are experienced restauranteurs/tavern/grill operators.  We'll give it a month to work out the kinks and go back and give it another go.  However, it'll have to be on the patio to avoid as much smoke as possible (if I want smoke with my food and drink, I'll go the casino across the street, or to the Irish bar at Boca Park; point is, Summerlin doesn't need another smokey bar/grill).

It's like anticipating for Christmas morning only to wake up to...Columbus Day? I am not a steak connoisseur but if that qualifies as Filet Mignon, next time I'll just have the chicken please...

What was good was the Greek Fries. Just simple greek fries with feta cheese, slices of shawarma meat and tomatoes. This is something I expect from a bar like Distill, nothing extraordinary but everything you can expect when you crave fatty greek fries.

Please don't have items like the Filet Mignon Sliders on the menu only to leave us crestfallen. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth..literally. 

Besides mediocre food, I love the outside atmosphere. Real nice if you want to get away from the noisy compounds of the interior, especially during a game night. 

What's cool is that they offer a Football Menu during football games whether or not you're there to watch the game.

I know, it might not have been there signature dish and all, but why have it on the menu if it's some half assed supreme boboli faux pizza bs? If that is how they treat something as simple of a staple as a pizza, I can't imagine what they do to the other items on their menu.

On top of that, our servers kept rotating so it was hard to keep track of who to ask for what. Most of them were fine but the last guy (dark spikey haired bar tender guy) was a complete jerk. Totally inconsiderate, ill tempered, abrasive, rude and disrespectful. He made me and my girlfriend very uncomfortable to say the least.

My main problem was that they double charged me on a beer I ordered.  It took three separate calls for me to get the charge removed.

In fact, once on the patio I didn't even feel like I was in the middle of busy restaurant parking lot.  My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on Sunday evening.  It wasn't very crowded at all.  We were greeted and told we could sit wherever we wanted so we chose the patio.  On this visit we didn't really see much of the inside.  Happy Hour is every day from 3-6 but we missed that but checking in on Yelp got me a free drink so can't really beat that.  Off the appetizer menu we ordered the chicken quesadillas and avocado egg rolls.  Basic bar food but no complaints about taste or portion size.  I wish the tables outside were a little bigger.  We felt cramped eating having to use the small round table and a couple chairs to hold the times.  Not sure why the waitress didn't offer to move another small table for us since it was empty on the patio minus one other group of diners.

I know I will find myself back here soon especially during happy hour.  They also have a loyalty program.  I mean if you are going to frequent an establishment you might as well take advantage of the perks that go along with it.",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,4,2,4,A38y50ODgYiAOzcT4d-Ktw
3592625,2014-03-26,9,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"The gentleman sitting next to me at the bar and I were in agreement; a name like Distill might not appeal to both sexes equally. The place did appear a little lopsided, with few members of the smarter sex represented in the crowd, but maybe it was just an off night.

You have to be envious of the location (though I cannot for the life of me imagine why the prior establishment closed down, they made the best $5 burritos every Sunday morning in the parking lot), many a west-sider will find themselves in this area when on the hunt for food.

At first I wanted to bemoan the continued downward spiral of the local Las Vegas food scene, specifically the burger I ordered that they affectionately refer to as ""The Cure"", but then I realized -

YES - I definitely want to bemoan the continued downward spiral of the local Las Vegas food scene.

The Cure was, well, unremarkable in every way, despite a description that promised so much: 

""Hand crafted burger: ground beef and pork blend stuffed with fontina cheese topped with soy marinated onions, jalapeño jelly, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and fried parsnips on a brioche bun."" 

Doesn't it just sound tasty? Well it's not. Unremarkable, is the best way to describe it. There was one more thing, the second half of my burger was ice cold by the time I finished the first - not that the first half was piping hot or anything, but ice cold?

The bar menu has no section for ""distilled spirits"", despite the name, another thing the gentleman sitting next to me thought was curious. They did have a coffee infused whiskey as part of their signature Manhattan, but if you didn't read the description of the drink you would have never known they offer this unusual item. I asked the bartender about the coffee infused whiskey - and before I could even finish my sentence, he returns with TWO shots of the curious liquid - one for me and one for this gentleman I just met - and then charged BOTH of them to my tab. Wow, really?

If I were the one opening a restaurant in this enviable western valley location, I personally would have avoided the poker machines. But then my goal would have been to wow patrons with good food and service, rather than just open another smoky gambling hall.

In all, the food is not great, the service needs a little, well, delicacy and the place sure was overflowing with men - but I thought is was okay.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,12,7,3,AwSRSMhBdVyvHPaireavFQ

I ALWAYS order my steaks/burgers medium rare, but this was a time where I couldn't because it wasn't an all beef patty, the cure burger is a mix of beef and pork, so we ordered it medium. We also ordered Their steak sandwich(forgot the name) and split both. I think it was kinda like a French Dip.

Our Server was great, offering suggestions and answering questions we had about anything on the menu. Our orders came out rather quickly and dug right in. The steak sandwich was very tasty, meat was well seasoned and the roll was nicely toasted. The Cure Burger was love at first bite, and is as good as everyone raves about! A bit messy in a good way, and the Jalapeno Jam gives it a nice kick. We enjoyed every bite.

I don't know about you, but after having something savory, I crave something sweet, so we took a look at the dessert menu. Their Bread Pudding sounded good, so we went with that.
When our server brought it to our table, our initial reaction was WTF!?!? This BEAST could seriously feed 4-6 people and pretty much covered the entire plate almost! The gooey nut topping part was good, but the custard part needed a little more love. After a couple of stabs, we were done.

1) For yelpers, if you check in you get a free shot of their house whisky. Bad thing is, it's horrible. Cinnamon / orange infused. Pretty much tasted like Triaminic cold and cough. Pass on it, trust me.

Well, I do not know who voted, but it seriously is ""the worst"" (not just one of the worse) breakfasts I have ever had in the past 30+ years.   I had their Protein Omelet, and it had absolutely no flavor -- it was terrible. Another in our party ordered the Strawberry Waffle, and the strawberries (there are only 4 small strawberries on their so-called Strawberry Waffle) were FROZEN. Yes, FROZEN. When it was brought to the server's attention, she apologized and informed us, ""we don't have any fresh fruit.""  She was right -- because the watermelon, cantaloupe, and other melons they serve as a side dish with their breakfasts also were frozen and tasteless. So, while the reviews for Distill are positive for the drinks and the typical ""bar food"" you get at a place like this (and I agree that this is a fun place in the evenings), they definitely need to drastically improve on their so-called ""best brunch in Summerlin""!!!!!

I've been here when it was a Mexican restaurant and the decorations have changed.  There's a lot of whiskey barrel type furniture with leather/vinyl coverings.  There are also a lot of decorative signs with funny sayings.  The room is quite dark until your eyes get adjusted.

There are a couple of spaces at the bar that have no video poked machines built in and I chose one of these paces.  Lelaine was the bar hop and she was there with my coffee quickly and a menu.

Unlike prior restaurants/bars in the same space who really never changed it up so much, the decor and design has changed just so to make it feel and look brand new and that time and consideration was put into this remodel.  It is still built on a round center bar, but they have knocked down enough walls, put up enough brick and done enough design changes to make it feel welcoming and different.  

Pretty expansive menu considering it is basically a bar (which includes breakfast 24/7, which I personally found to be a big bonus), what I thought to be reasonably priced and many nooks/spots to sit and hunker down to meet with friends, it seems like a good ""local spot.""  Often in Vegas, we (or maybe me) look to restaurants/bars that are unique/have an edge/have a niche, when indeed to great solid, basic staple with nice staff, good food and a nice atmosphere.  Although there is nothing earth shattering or noteworthy to say ""this place is awesome"" (although there are pool tables in the back),  I still enjoyed going and will absolutely go back.  As it advertises wanting to be a local hangout, I think they might be on to something and being a local in the Summerlin area, I will go back.  

Curious about the smoking policy, for the nice hostess indicated that you could smoke anywhere and I saw only one person smoking who was sitting at the bar.   With people eating everywhere and NV law, not sure the hostess was correct.  I am not a smoker and a ""you can smoke anywhere"" bar would surely be the only thing that would turn me off about this place.  Again, I did not grill the nice hostess any further, although would clarify when I am in there again.

Fish tacos - Flavorless, even with a weird sauce they laid over them. 
Sliders - Dried out meat, and just not dressed with anything special.

Checking in on yelp you'll grab a Distill bar infused Bourbon on the house. The bartender gave me a pretty sweet Coffee infused bourbon with diet coke. I'm gonna say this was pretty nice drop and if you like a little sweet I recommend it.

For dinner we ordered some mash potato bites as an app!!! Order them! They are amazing. For dinner we got the six pack sliders!!! A mix or combo of different sliders. Ruben, cheeseburger and Philly cheese steak. All were pretty tasty.

4216853,2016-03-14,2,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"Came here on a whim one night with some friends. The place looked so nice, inside and out. Very spacious inside, and lots of seating. We came around midnight, and seated ourselves in kind of a dead area, so I was concerned that we might be overlooked, or that the server would take a while to get to us, but she was very attentive the whole time. Good pub food. Good portions. They're open 24/7 too.

Food: 

Avocado Eggrolls - Not what we expected. The eggrolls were stuffed with a mushy guacamole, rather than avocado slices or chunks. It wasn't very enjoyable biting into a crunchy wrapper and having the filling squish into your mouth. Taste was meh, but the ginger dipping sauce was tasty. Wouldn't order this again. 

Biscuits and Gravy - Standard, nothing special. Not great, not horrible. The sausage in the gravy was a nice touch. $3 price point doesn't hurt either.

Potato Nachos - Tasty. Exactly what it sounds like, slices of potato, fried, and topped with the normal nacho ingredients. 

Calamari Straws with a Mango Curry Emulsion and Sriracha -My favorite of the bunch. The calamari was soft, and the sauce was interesting; just savory enough and just sweet enough for me. Ask for more on the side, because the drizzle on the plate isn't really enough. 

Bread Pudding - Ok, but not great. Nice and buttery,  but too dense. 

Overall a good experience, I'd come back some time for the calamari and to try out some other items.",Sn7SkFeZZTLqapjFf3d16Q,3,1,4,EpAgqjBOFE5Vm_GSypkuUA

We sat in uber comfy leather chairs to watch the England vs. Italy FIFA match. We started with the free shot with our Yelp check in.  The orange cinnamon infused whiskey was smooth and delicious!  Our servers were awesome!  I started with the Distiller's Delight..  It was so refreshing. Danger Will Robinson!  Warning....they go down very easily!   We ordered off the Happy Hour menu.  The yummy fried artichokes were battered served with a mayo based dip.    The bruschettas were toasted and garlicky served with chopped tomato and onion.  The salsa was smokey and delicious.  The chips were heated but a little on the hard side.  I like my chips to be light and flaky, but at 2 bucks, I can't complain!  My server Laney (sp?) suggested a Jameson and Ginger Beer with 3 lemons.  OMG it was delicious!  We will be back!

Update:  We came back for breakfast and were  lucky to get Laney again.  We both got bacon and eggs and shared a short stack.  The coffee was roasty, delicious and refilled frequently. My over easy eggs were perfect.  A side of applewood bacon, crispy hash browns and sourdough toast completed this huge breakfast.  We couldn't touch our supersized pancakes.

We decided to order appetizers and settled on the mashed potato balls and homemade poppers. 
The manager brought them out and introduced himself. 
Bar food but really, really good!!! (try the poppers)
We then ordered another round and a six pack of assorted sliders. They, like the appetizers were served diligently, quality ingredients, and tasted amazing.
A free whiskey shot and full belly later, we  again spoke with Tony the manager and  although we are not ""local"", were made to feel extremely welcome.

Or not offer water before taking my order. The place would be great if they had their wait staff properly trained. Which is really a problem with management. Servers please read the proper process: greet your customers and offer them water, then come back and take their drink order, then come take their food order, then come back and check that things came out correctly and that your customer needs nothing else.

She had to deal with ALOT and she never broke her uplifting positive facade! I'm just obsessed with her and her immaculate service!!

We come back months later, and she still remembered us and welcomed us into her section with open arms and a wide happy smile! She's my favorite type of server! Just overall wonderful! And her attention to detail is top quality!! Her attitude towards her job and towards everyone else both happy and difficult, stays the same! She gives her best service to everyone!

5051587,2014-07-16,1,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"I've heard good things so we decided to do dinner here with a friend. 

I dig the laidback vibe and decor, I love the quirky patio space! It was a bit hot this day so we stayed indoors. Just note this is a bar and is a smoking establishment but it was not smoky when we went. I will probably try to smoke a cigar on the patio one of these days. 

Make sure to check in, there's a offer for a infused whiskey I didn't see until after we were finished and paid. D'oh! 

We shared the shrimp artichoke spinach dip. The dip was really creamy and nicely seasoned. It only had a few shrimp on top and it really didn't need it. My philosophy is don't be skimpy as it gives a lesser impression than if it wasn't there at all. Just don't put it at all and offer more quantity of the dip as that was good and we had plenty of unused chips as we polished off the small dip quite fast. 

I decided to get a black and bleu burger. This was a pretty good burger, not skimpy of the stinky cheese and I like the horseradish sauce though wish it had more kick vs just the flavor. Comes with a side of choice and I picked fries which was standard, but good. Our friend got the Cure burger and between the two, that was the definite winner. That was uber yummy so I took two bites instead of taking a small taste. 

The fiance get fish and chips. This unfortunately was a bit of a miss. The batter had decent flavor and fish was good but it wasn't very crispy at all and should have been fried up longer. Whoever plated it, should have caught it and let it have a few more minutes. Slaw didn't have much flavor as it barely had any dressing on it. The fries were good. 

The fish and chips was in the entree section of the menu which comes with a soup or salad. He chose a caesar salad which was actually pretty good caesar and was rather sizeable for a ""side salad"". 

Our server was pretty friendly, and was reasonable with checking in on us and refilling. 

While one entree was a miss, I think we will be back soon as we can see the potential. There is a industry half off happy hour on Weds. starting at 10pm so we will probably come back soon for that and I am definitely in for The Cure!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,1,3,Ize-wqP2MLcXhx5fZSjzJg

5203307,2015-02-25,0,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"Distill is still one of my favorite bars in Las Vegas. We have had mostly great experiences from enjoying the Super Bowl, discovering that The Cure burger really is as good as the reviews say, to making friends with people in a neighborhood of Las Vegas we'd otherwise never visit.

However, one particular employee there has irked me to the point that I've come back to Yelp, hoping management will take steps not to lose my business and the business of the friends we've recommended to the bar. I preface all of this by mentioning that I've been served by every member on the staff here. Everyone who works there, without question, is excellent and professional - unless you have the unfortunate experience of Carissa. 

If she is your server, you are better off giving your business to the restaurants nearby. Her service is either slow or non-existent. Often, we find ourselves waiting up to an hour before she returns to refill our empty drinks. Or, perhaps you're new to the bar and curious what's on tap. She doesn't know. She won't find out for you. In fact, she'll watch you stand up, take several steps toward the bar until you can see the taps to decide, and then take your order. Don't bother asking what's good for food, she doesn't know. Dare I mention the more than a few occasions where she flat out did not serve us? When we had to ask another server to take us instead...  

My review remains 5 stars because of the other outstanding people who work here. Just know that there's potential for a terrible experience here too.",S4dV5bWLNli05LUgfV3FCQ,1,0,5,IOmaHFClK0nhBkPv8eDZcg

As far as food goes I've only tried the quesadillas and they were very average.  Service is decent but bartenders get lost when busy and takes a while to get a drink.

French Toast - Bread Pudding with Banana Foster Sauce

Located just a mile from my front door, and recently offering brunch as only a 24/7 'Local Bar' in Las Vegas can, it was just after 8am that I entered Distill and with the crew mopping floors as a few locals sat playing video slots beneath the echoes of KISS's ""Shout it Out Loud"" it was to a Please Seat Yourself sign that I was greeted - a seat in the upper rim selected with a young woman named Chrissy interrupting her duties of setting up the Bloody Mary Bar to procure me a menu, water, and the first of several cups of surprisingly good coffee.

Offering a 24/7 menu of items ranging from snacks, sandwiches, and salads to entrees and even hearty breakfasts it was largely for the weekend-only 8a-2p brunch that I'd scheduled my first visit to Distill and ordering in two rounds with every item recommended as a good choice by both my server and Assistant GM Kristyne, who stopped by to chat no less than three times, the meal unfolded in four plates that all showed surprising creativity and execution one would generally see reserved for far more 'fancy' spots.

Beginning savory, it was with a paper-lined cone full of tender cheesy potatoes beneath a golden topcoat that the meal began, and paired with a duo of sauces from which the smoky sour cream was undoubtedly a standout the flavors were up front without a bit of the greasiness oft associated with fried potatoes - the hashbrowns served next to a competent croque madame for example, though the sandwich itself was little more than ham, egg, and cheese on toast as the Bechamel was a touch too thick and unfortunately under-flavored.

Moving on to two more brunch-specific selections, as the soundtrack shifted briefly to Pink and copious coffee refills continued, round two saw the arrival of two substantially larger entrees and although the chicken tenders proved no better than the sort one would expect at a decent pub the waffle was executed beautifully with a crunchy exterior and springy crumb, the spicy sauce keeping sweet caramel in check - a sense of balance equally achieved by three thick slices of custard-soaked breaded seared crisp with sticky bananas foster finding its foil in a toasty layer of nuts.

Far exceeding modest expectations in terms of food, scene, and customer service with prices trending far lower than several other spots in the city it is only a matter of time before I return to Distill and although I'm certainly not the bar's target audience for booze and games I also look forward to seeing whether the quality carries over to Elixir and Remedy's, the Henderson based members of their growing 24/7 family.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,4,m_0smw7nduegv7s-b-WjBw

The best part of this great sports bar/restaurant (besides the food) are the big cushy leather chairs & sofas, enough space between others, the just-right lighting, and the greeting one always receives from a terrific staff.  I recommend Angela, our server for the few hours, who goes the extra mile & does it with a fun personality (as though she loves her job).  

The menus are vast & include:  football day menu, happy hour menu & B/L/D.  Wanting to begin my take-off-a-few-pounds resolution, I chose the fish & chips, & was I a happy camper!  Three sizeable, lightly-breaded in beer batter fillets served with lots of good fries (I gave to my partner), coleslaw and a salad  of gourmet greens (or clam chowder) for $13.25.  He had the steak nachos from football menu & they were plenty, being generous with the steak portion.  And not too gooey.  Your choices on that menu are terrific, incl. generous & attractively plated fish tacos.

The music that night (we asked for the game ""noise"" instead) was for anyone's taste; a nice departure from the usual screams of Brittany Spear types.

The bartender convinced my friend to try their famous fresh squeezed margarita at the cost of $10. (Not on the Happy Hour menu).  The drink was so tart and bitter she could not drink it.  The bartender replaced the drink with a glass of wine and charged us for both!

The second time, I took my dad who loves a good hang out bar.  The bartender again greeted us, introduced himelf, shook our hands then promptly disappeared never to be seen again.

My now wife and I held out wedding rehearsal party for around 100 people in the outdoor patio and it absolutely exceeded our expectations. They were well staffed and very organized. Christine (one of the mangers) set up the entire event for us and everything went great. The set up was perfect, the food was fantastic, the staff was very attentive and helpful, and price was right in line with comparable venues around town.  They set up a full bar outside on the patio, had waited service as well, and set up a full buffet spread. It was also the little things that made a big difference like they had both regular and cucumber water available for guests to refresh at. They ensured that all guests were able to get transported home safely.  I absolutely recommend this option if you are ever hosting a party.

Food was a 2/3 

As I have gone past this place probably 1000 times I decided to go out of my norm and stop in.

Walked in, somewhat loud for a weekday, seemed the music would get louder as the people would get louder. 

Seated myself, was served by Sydney, who was really attentive and friendly. She made the experience enjoyable, even though it was a little busy she took a few minutes to chat.  

I ordered the grilled chicken without the sauce  and chicken soup.  

The soup of surprisingly really good for a bar.  It had a pretty good spice kick to it.
The chicken was average, not being able to see what you're eating because of how dark it was in the bar was a little discouraging.  I'm not a sweet potato fan and there were a lot of them.  I was not able to make out the difference between normal potatoes and the sweet. The red peppers were mushy, but edible. 
Overall the customer service from Syndey would bring me back with my friends or even again alone.  
I would probably stick with a burger next time since the reviews are very high

Ordered a burger with bacon this time and it was well prepared. Fresh bacon, Tomato, and lettuce.

For a smokey dive bar, i was excited about outside seating. We were greeted enthusiastically and our waitress showed up soon after to take our order of a couple drinks. 

now.. whenever i see beers on a menu i've never heard of, I like to ask about them. I like beer and i like trying beer. One might suggest that behavior likening to beer tasting be done in a place that serves beer... such as a bar.  However, it seems to be an unwritten rule at Distill that if you sit outside, you are immediately dubbed an a$$. AND... if you ask about beers, you can expect the waitress to only really know the size of the beer and have about a 60% accuracy rate on the hue of the beer. Getting any info on what a beer tastes like was pretty stupid on my part to think that a business would actually know the menu that is printed on paper and not handwritten on a chalkboard. 

Having asked a few simple questions about a couple beers i had not heard of, it was clear that the waitress was really bothered by having to do the minimum amount of work; and, that we were outside was even more so of an insult to have to endure the constant walking to the nether regions of her place of employ to deal with people she clearly thought sucked. 

I'm to blame for ordering the beers I ordered. However, the beers were crap. Whoever is in charge of ordering beers isn't good at their job. 
The waitress was not a happy soul in any regard. 
The outside seating was nice. 

If either of the two previous failing businesses that were in this location returned, so would I. But as long as Distill somehow manages to profit in what is a pretty nice location, I guess i'll just be happy to have my beer outing adventures elsewhere.",3EPBhYWMcglaqhJYgcofHg,2,0,1,OqJXmNgfRO7ACgmON66GWQ

5667405,2015-02-22,1,VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ,"We were looking for a place to get a good burger on a Saturday night and I have seen the ""Cure"" burger mentioned many times so we decided to head on over. Overall, we were really underwhelmed..

First off, it is seat yourself anywhere, which is fine, but when you walk in, it really seems like a place that they would seat you, for the tables at least, so after standing there 5ish minutes and having several waitresses pass us by, we walked up to one to find out it was seat yourself...the lack of interest from any server was to be a theme for the evening.

We found a table and sat while several servers passed us by, easily a dozen times. No menus to look at, no drinks, just us sitting there, and (I would think) obviously looking like we needed menus. Server finally came over with menus, and then back about 5 seconds later to take drink orders. As I had literally just gotten the menu, I asked for ""a water to start"" 

They did bring the water out pretty quickly and then cue the same dozen waitresses walking by while we sat for 15 minutes waiting to order. When the waitress arrived she actually asked ""Did you want to order some dinner?"" I was very tempted to say ""No, we just came for water"" She seemed surprised when we actually wanted drinks...at a bar....anyway, I could go on, but the rest of the evening was the same service wise. Waitress nowhere to be found, dinner took forever (although the man who dropped it off did apologize for the wait) and just feeling like we were almost inconveniencing the servers...it was very odd. 

I could almost understand if it was meant to be more of an actual bar, but it is set up like a very large restaurant with tables everywhere, so it was just weird. I was tempted to just hit the bar myself and get my own drinks, but I kept playing the waitress must be coming over here any minute game, even though I could have gone to the bar and back 20 times in between visits from her. 

Anyway, on to the food. Short story, everything was meh. Long story, we ordered mashed potato bite appetizers, very bland, almost no taste at all actually, and was only marginally helped by the sour creme sauce. Pretzel bites, again incredibly bland and no taste, and again only marginally helped by the mustard sauce. 

The Cure burger which I have heard good things about was also fairly disappointing. It had some good flavor, but was probably the messiest burger I have ever had. Everything was dripping all over my hands and the plate below and sliding everywhere, resulting in bites of just burger or just sauce toppings. I finally gave up and ate it with a fork, which was 1. ridiculous, and 2. only worth it if it had been really good, and it wasn't. I edited to add that it did not have the fried parsnips in it either. I thought that was on the description, then thought I mixed it up with another burger, but I didn't and they were missing. Sweet potato fries that I ordered along with it were tasteless (sensing a theme on their fried items here) and the margarita (one of their $10 ""distill specials"")  was also just eh with a short pour for sure...definitely had better.

It's one of those places that had the service been top notch, it would have made up for the food, or if the food had been awesome, it would have made up for the service, but considering both were not good, it's not worth a return trip at all. Too many other places in Vegas doing it better.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,5,0,2,5qCeErKvxoT2ab9Rg53YeA

The wait staff, bartenders, and the manager Dan make this place a standout. The bar is staffed with good people and it shows. Overall vibe of this place is excellent.

I've noticed that the crowd that comes here is mixed with both older and younger people. A lot of casino industry people come here and love it. Everyone gets along and great conversations are the norm.

The music was so loud, that we had to speak in raised voices the entire time we were there and STILL could barely hear each other. Clearly, everyone else in the place had a hard time hearing each other as well. Most of the people were leaning in to talk/yell to/at each other. All those people yelling over the unnecessarily loud music just makes the entire bar/restaurant even noisier. 

We sat at a nice four top, which was clean and were greeted very quickly. Our poor waitress was very sweet and smiled a lot as she yelled ""HI CAN I START YOU OFF WITH A DRINK?!?!""  I had the ""Mad Mule"", a specialty house cocktail. (Citron vodka, mixed with ""fresh lime juice"", simple syrup, orange bitters, and ginger beer.)  With this kind of ingredient list this cocktail should be awesome, but it was just ok. I will have to try something else if we ever go back. 

Distill has a big variety of sliders to try, but we went with something simple. The ""Bacon Cheese Burger sliders"". Sadly, not much to write about, they were just average.

The best thing we had all night were the ""Mashed Potato Bites"". They take mashed potatoes and mix them with cheddar, pepper jack and parmesan cheeses then add a ""blend of spices"". They roll them into bite sized balls, then bread crumbs and fry them. I recommend trying those if you eat here.

First time, sat at the bar, ordered the mule drink and a chicken dinner. Cute bartender took our order for drinks, then disappeared...finally another one took our meal order. Chicken had good flavor, lots of food on the plate, but was a touch dry. My friend has the tacos, he enjoyed them and got full on 3. 
2nd time came in a bit drunk with a couple friends. Not too many people there except the bar/wait staff off work. Had the chicken fried steak breakfast and it was pretty good. My friends didn't win any money so they went home early and unhappy. 
3rd time came in with a group of 3 other friends, we had some cocktails and some chips/salsa while watching the college hoop games. TV's are a little weird if you sit at the hightop table. Our waitress was fantastic, gave us a free beer (mistake) and a free philly cheesesteak sandwich (another mistake). We all had a good time.

Drink orders were a bit slow to start with, and a glass of water had to come from someone different which is strange. The place was relatively busy and I didn't notice it being smoky. I guess the only reason I'm downgrading to 3.5 stars was the slow service on visit 1 and 3, and the chicken not being that great. I guess I'm used to really good food.

Cure burger - 2 star.  
I was unfortunately disappointed. The burger tasted as though it was missing something. I found the meat patty itself to lack flavor, the other additions in the burger fell a bit short. There was some sweetness to it, but it was needing either a tad bit more, or some contrasting flavor to bring it out, which I didn't experience. 

The only assumption I can make is that, it was a busy night with a major game, and happy hour time. I don't know if it was cooked differently than if I had come at a less busy time. I hate writing this review, since I was looking forward to this burger. 

Chipotle Chicken Nachos- 3 star. Average nachos. The chips though, were delicious, and I'd probably come back and get the chips and dip or the chips and salsa as the salsa was VERY fresh and delicious.

I do want to note that I LOVE the interior design of this place. The outside patio is gorgeous, and if the weather isn't too hot or too cold, it'd be such a great place to sit and dine with friends. Inside, there was an area where there was a huge couch, and a tv right in front, almost as though you are watching a game from home. So brilliant!  Service was a 5 star.

The restrooms even say ""For those who sit"" and ""For those who stand,"" haha. Especially compared to the other 24 hour local bars around the city, I would have to say this is my favorite. 

The only reason I took off a star is because I ordered the sweet potato french fries (which were INCREDIBLE - they even came with their own maple/brown sugar dipping sauce) and I guess there was a miscommunication between the bartender and the kitchen, because I had to ask about 20 minutes later where my fries were. My friend said she's never had that happen to her before, so I assume it must've been a fluke. The bartender was very apologetic and immediately went to the kitchen to see what had happened.

The bar is the focus of the indoor area, and it's a poker bar. They offer a selection of specialty martinis and other cocktails, and the few I've tried have been good. One of their burgers, the hangover cure or something, won a best burger award from Thrillist. I had it and it was very good. I recently had the Italian sandwich, which was pretty tasty as well. 

Their 3rd Anniversary Luau party was a decent event, with a free buffet & drink specials.
On the buffet was teriyaki beef, chicken & macadamia crusted mahi as well as macaroni salad, green salad & macadamia cookies. The free photos offered at the party was a nice touch also. They were photo booth style on a green screen with multiple backgrounds available, and the three of us enjoyed getting a few pics. 

Distill also has a yearly 80s party, which was really nice the first year, with plenty of 80s decor. They handed out sunglasses, buttons, etc. to accessorize with.

Servers are also bussers, which didn't help speed things up. And the bar was backed up with drink orders. They definitely could benefit from a second bar. 

We did manage to fill up on the free offerings, so I'll reserve my food critique until next time. We checked out the menu, with its standard assortment of appetizers, salads, burgers, and sandwiches, and prices are pretty reasonable. But the Happy Hour (3-6 pm and 3-6 am - catering to early joggers?) menu is completely unimaginative and eminently skippable. 

I'll update my review and impressions of the food after all the excitement dies down (and hopefully the noise - this place is jet-takeoff LOUD!!!!!), but my initial impressions are just ho-hum.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,1,3,Md-sQuDdQfbyhd2H1ze0zQ

Unfortunately, it was just kinda sad.....the music they played was meh, the food they served was barely edible, and there was a cricket just hanging out on the wall behind our table (we were seated inside in the ""restaurant"" area...ick...also, our server herself was so afraid of the bug, one of my party had to kill it).  I will say that it was fairly packed in the bar area and seems popular enough amongst the locals? 

I might come back when I'm itching for a drink at like 10am...but otherwise, I'm sure I can find better places to go for a casual drink.",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,5,4,2,EaX7MttqZf_liZxj4-vqRA

The food is delicious, but most importantly, the bartenders are the best!! Because of my work schedule, I come mostly during graveyard hours and Rob is seriously the best. He's friendly, attentive, and makes awesome drinks. When I have the opportunity to come on other shifts, bartenders Billy, Chanel, Megs, Teanne, Rick, and Mike make it a wonderful experience! In the words of Toby Keith, ""I love this bar"".",xKuEY6y0wYVuikt11IpUUg,0,0,5,KHCUM76pppKdujraWO-ByQ

If you're a sports fan inside is the place to be, but you'll find me outside here anytime of year. Had a great meal here yesterday. We had the chips and salsa and mashed potato bites - both were delicious.

Happy Hour counts on Saturday so I had the red sangria- and as recommended it was tasty! For dinner we had the grilled shrimp tacos and the Distill chicken sandwich. Both were very well done and delicious. They are working on new menu updates so I'll be back to see what else they come up with. 

The staff was super attentive and friendly. Kudos to Connie and Tony for taking such great care of us. This is a great spot in the sometimes pretentious Summerlin neighborhood- down to earth and great food.",2dLz_y1_rUHj9O3_lJfT9w,1,0,5,g4Bw5LhDXA7Jz3Yc98lz3w
