I ordered the fish and chips.  The only good thing was the french fries.  The meal is supposed to come with 3 pieces of fish.  I got 2 1/2.  The first piece was O.K.  The second was 1/2 the size and seemed thrown in just to be 3 pieces.  The last piece was rock hard and must have been from some diseased fish.  Lucky me, I got the fish with cancer or a tumor.

i ordered the christmas special: honeybaked ham w/cranberry sauce, salad, soup, steamed veggies, mashed potatoes all for $13!! they also had other specials for the same price with turkey and salmon. you CANT beat that price fo sho. the ham came out perfect and everything on my plate could not be better. the only complaints were that other people that ordered the  t-bone and meat loaf said it was a little too dry.

739483,2013-04-04,0,2Y0-nrSZNsLRStyupZgM7g,"Ugh. This place...not good. We usually end up coming here for breakfast at least once when staying at The Orleans for Viva Las Vegas. Why do we continue to go then you may ask? We go because it serves breakfast all day (the buffet is better, but  breakfast ends quite early)  and is convenient, and cheap which works when you have a hang over and you're short on time. There is so much going on at once, so  it's not always easy to go elsewhere off site, that and/or the thought of getting in the shuttle bus to the strip is more than your pounding head can stand. Unfortunately, The Orleans is full of pretty bad food choices generally speaking.

The food is mediocre - the toast comes covered in this spray butter crap which makes it limp and damp - who knows what's in that shit. Even when you request dry toast they put it on. You have to request REAL cream for your coffee, or you get this cream replacement that is probably made from some sort of nasty oil product and coloured white. Not to mention it's been sitting on the table for who knows how long. GROSS! The food is inconsistently prepared -  you can ask for eggs over easy, and they can arrive medium, overcooked, or under cooked...you just never know. I can't speak about how the rest of the food is, as we don't go there for anything other than breakfast..

The service is pretty crap too. I ordered a Mimosa when I placed my food order, and waited 20 minutes for it. I tried to ask about it, but the servers here have the art of not making eye contact with customers down pretty good. There are a bunch of servers running back and forth, but they don't often seem to be carrying anything. Our server disappeared completely for awhile, and I couldn't get anyone else's attention.  By the time I got her, I told her that if my Mimosa wasn't coming right now, to just cancel it. She said it was and said something about having to go to the bar to get it (What?) We got our food, and a few minutes later, I got it. Bloody hell, seriously?! I had intended to have one before I started eating, and then probably get another along with my breakfast. I'd probably stuck there until it was time for lunch if I'd ordered a second one! Over all, this place seems really disorganized. Yes, the place is busy, but holy hell people, not only is it Easter long weekend, but there are probably at least 1000 people in the hotel specifically for the Viva Las Vegas weekender! That's not new info to the hotel or staff as it's been going on at this location for quite some time now.  This last visit on the weekend was the worst I've experienced here yet, so hopefully it improves next year.",l9S84aF58DvyHj_HVNPXzA,3,1,2,kP8TlE_4UkHS7Brv_r4nZg
928129,2014-08-08,0,2Y0-nrSZNsLRStyupZgM7g,"We haven't had dinner at the Courtyard Café at the Orleans since the Boyd Group took over a few years ago. We used to visit regularly as the food was fresh and tasty. 

Well, that was then. We had dinner there tonight after a movie and couldn't believe the drop in quality of everything from the food to the service.  I had the chicken fajita salad and my friend had the Kung Pao Chinese dinner.  The chicken was so salty I could feel my blood pressure rising with each bite I took. I could identify the salad and tomatoes, but the grilled stuff that they mixed into it was unidentifiable. I believe it was supposed to be green pepper and onions. It just looked like mush.

My friend's Kung Pao dinner had ""salty"" chicken also. It actually looked similar to what I was served. It just lacked the lettuce, tomato, and bits of corn.  Mine was a hodgepodge of food thrown together. Both dinners were disgusting as the food looked more than 1 day old and soggy.

There was a guy at the table next to us who had ordered the $6.99 spaghetti plate. As we were leaving, we saw the waiter pick up the bowl of almost untouched spaghetti when he left.  Just hope they weren't planning on just touching it up and serving it again because that's what our food looked like.  

The food was tired and so was the waitress. She looked haggard and could barely get the food on the table let alone drag herself back to refill our water glasses (which never happened).  

There are too, too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.  For these 2 bad meals with just water to drink, the cost was $30.00.  Costly bad food!  You can bet that won't happen again!  Goodbye Orleans!",9SDdfeVRYgGduC-WfmTj-Q,0,0,1,0mBz_X7MKT55eB-BDEI9KQ

The graveyard specials are pretty sweet deals. Although the food is less than spectacular. It's just ""eh..ok."" It was more of just to satisfy our hunger at such a late hour. The service was a little slow. Even at 1:30 AM!

We came back for brunch the day we left and the place was packed! Everyone else had the same idea. I ordered their egg and ham special and it was just like any other egg and ham dish.

The fried stuff, like the fried clams, onion rings, and french fries - actually, the french fries are darn good here, are good, but for health reasons, I try to stay away from fried foods, especially sides. 

I've had the Turkey and Avocado wrap. The turkey was of the deli meat variety, and did have a sufficient amount of avocado. It was a nice sized wrap, but it did lack flavor. I ordered potato salad on the side, and, and that, too, I found bland. I had a taste of the Oriental Chicken Salad, and it was on the sweet side - it was okay, but the flavor just didn't mesh. I've also had their chicken Caesar salad and while I'm kind of grateful that the dressing wasn't too rich, it was actually not rich enough, especially for a Caesar dressing - and the chicken was bland.

$4.49 STEAK & EGGS !!!!!!!!!!!!

It used to only be $3.99, but the price raised the extra .50 cents a month or so ago, because they now offer this spectacular deal ONE HOUR EARLIER ! Unlike most steak and egg specials which start at midnight, this establishment now offers it at 11 pm. 

It's not the greatest thing you'll ever eat, but for a broke college student who tends to either party the night away or study the night away - this is a God send. Service is usually pretty quick [again this is late at night, I'm not sure about their peak hours]. 

I'd recommend ordering the steak one level under what you would usually order. For example, if you like Medium, order it Medium-Rare. The cooks usually over cook the steak. One time, a group of us ordered steak ranging from Rare to Medium Well, and each and everyone one of our steaks was cooked to Medium. Which of course, made me happy as that's how I like my steaks, but my fellow steak and egg eaters were not too happy.

Since I was staying at the Orleans Hotel, my brothers and I decided to eat at the cafe for convenience. My brothers order the T-Bone special for 11.99  while I ordered the 5.99 Prime Rib special.

We were seated promptly but service took a skydive after that. Jose was supposed to be our waiter but he ignored us to serve the larger tables. I hate it when waiters judge you by the cover. Just because I'm in jeans and a t-shirt, it doesn't mean I don't tip well.

We sat there for 5 minutes and no one came by to greet us. Finally the busgirl came by to ask us what we wanted to drink. Drinks came after a few minutes.  After waiting another 6 minutes ( I timed this), some random person from the back said that he was going to take our order for the waiter. After we gave the waiter our orders the food came out in 20 minutes. I kid you not! 

I got frustrated and asked the busgirl who our waiter was. She told us it was the guy who has been ignoring us. ""Jose"". I then told her that we were not greeted at all by him. After that complaint someone else came by to take care of us. When I paid for the check, I noticed they changed the name of the waiter to the person helping us. In the end I gave our waitress 20%.

When our waiter finally came over, he told us about the graveyard specials that start after midnight, that we could just wait and get the specials if we wanted, so we did that. We ordered a sampler platter in the meantime, because we were starving and had like 30 minutes or so to wait still. 

The sampler platter was awesome! It came with chicken strips, delicious fried calamari, onion rings and hot wings. The calamari and the chicken strips were so amazing, best thing I ate while in Vegas that weekend. Then at midnight we ordered the graveyard specials.

We ordered the lobster/steak special (discount applicable ONLY IF you are a member), chicken wings, and prime rib. The wings were a bit on the salty side, the salad was drenched with ranch, so there was more dressing than salad, the lobster was tiny and over cooked, but the steak was ok. BUT the prime rib wasn't good. Only the first few bites in the center were we able to swallow. Reason being, the rub they use on the outside of the meat tasted almost cured! So we had a lot of leftovers, thinking about how to fix them so we could eat it the next day.

The two cashiers were even rude when I tried joking to them about my bill. Instead of kindly saying no thank you, they gave me the ""eye"" and a smart -alex smirk. 

It's no wonder the entire place was practically empty! Everybody was at FRIDAYS or at the food court!

Do you hear that chant? Steak and eggs. For breakfast. Steak? For breakfast? What?!?!?

Apparently the locals love it here and they have the cheap deals for them. You can get it for $9 on a weekday. That's still an amazing price.

Too bad I came here on a weekday.

Located on the first floor of The Orleans Casino, in the back, Courtyard Cafe lets you take in the wonderful smells and scents of .... the casino and the cigarettes. It's not that bad haha. It's just a really wide and open area and there's no wall/barriers, so you can see your Keno bets if you really wanted :P
After waiting in the line for 15-20 minutes, we finally got a seat in the back (or is it front LOL) and our waiter came over to ask for our drinks. Water. Yes. Water. After that, he took a while to come back to get our orders. 


Guacamole Bacon Cheeseburger. They have a lot of guacamole in here. Since I had asked for medium rare on the patty, the patty wasn't overdone and hard. It was actually rare and you could taste the juices. The guacamole had a kick to it that I loved (it wasn't spicy per se). The bacon was overdone a little bit more than I would have liked, but it's wasn't to the point where it was burnt and not edible. That was the inside. As an overall taste, though, it was a good size for $9.99 (pretty big) but it was still average to me. I've definitely had better burgers but as my friend would say, this was decent. More than decent. I took out the onion rings because if I hadn't, my big mouth wouldn't have gulped this down. The onion rings were eaten last but they were a bit dry without any... hmm.. BBQ sauce! Or any sauce. So I guess maybe I shouldn't have taken them out? :(

You could also get a side and it was fries but definitely ask if they make substitutions! I got hash browns on the side (or potatoes I guess) and I needed ketchup with it. They were lacking saltiess if you ate them solo.

I didn't get too much of a chance to eat what present company had (I was pretty filled) but as I sat up and got away the chant returned.

Although I've only eaten here one time, I enjoyed a Prime Rib, salad, baked potato in lieu of fries, plus a dessert (chocolate cake).  My friends had the Prime Rib Dip (prime rib on french roll sandwich, pickles, olives, fries, and  au jus).  We each spent approximately $13 (with tip) for our meals.  All i can say is YUMMY!

The salad was so-so.  It was basically what you'd expect for a side salad (tomato, lettuce, croutons, etc).  Nothing to write home about.

My boyfriend had the prime rib, but instead of a salad had opted for the chili, along with chocolate ice cream.  The chili was fairly ok, and chocolate ice cream is basically chocolate ice cream.  There were also some rolls that they served with our entrees, which were also pretty good.

The prime rib entrees, however, were a different story.  Each were cooked according to our specifications.  The size of the prime rib was approximately 8 oz. each.  They were definitely monster-sized portions, and we definitely didn't end up cleaning our plates.

The prime rib dips (sandwiches) were served on a seasoned french roll with garlic and butter.  Heavenly.  Not only was the meat cooked well, but the garlic and butter mixed on the bread was a perfect touch.  In addition, the fries were quite crispy (not soggy) and seasoned.  

The chocolate cake was a generous piece, but was definitely moist and delicious.  I ended up eating the entire thing by myself.

Overall, a great experience. The portions were huge and the service was pretty good.  Although I kept waiting (anxiously) in anticipation of the entree, I was definitely well pleased with my choice.  I will definitely be coming back here for another prime rib dinner/prime rib dip.  With prices like these, why not?",QiDtS54JwTGeH81c-a84WQ,1,1,4,WaWRJL3VWGkrw4G1xUSb0w

I ordered the fish and chips, one of my favorite comfort foods.  The order is 3 smallish peices of processed and prebattered fish (think Gorton's).  They were all very greasy, the fries were seasoned and it also came with a side salad or soup and corn on the cob.  The tartar sauce was a bit too rich and lacking any real flavor.  I was using ketchep after my first peice of fish.  The meal didn't make me sick and is edible, but if you are really craving fish and chips, it would be better to just go across the street to McMullen's.  

Service was good, the waitress really hustled and the drink server topped off my ice frequently enough.  The reason I gave only two stars however is because of a policy they have at this cafe: no take out or to go orders.  I have never heard of anything so strange and can't figure for the life of me why they would do something like that.  

I wanted to order a tuna fish sandwich to go, but I couldn't, they wouldn't allow it.  I asked what do customers do when they can't finish, well, they have boxes.  Okay, well can I order it and then request a box?  No.  Really?  WTF?!  After some more bewildered discussion, the manager said I could order it and request a box, but I HAD to eat some of the order.  CRAZY!

Anyway, the tuna salad had large chunks of dry albacore, the lemon mayonaise was good though.  The side of cole slaw that came with it was too creamy and rich and lacking any flavor.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,2,1,2,qxeX5F5DNtp5B8AFf3p1Zw

We ate closer to 10:30.  

Across the table various food items were ordered.  My aunt got California Benedict and seemed to enjoy it.  My grandma and cousin both got a scambled egg and toast.  It seemed perfectly average as a boring meal like that should be.  I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak.  It was alright.  There was a lot of cheese which I appreciate.  The meat was perhaps a bit dry for my liking but the sandwich was elevated over all by the onions, mushrooms, and bell pepper.  I especially enjoyed the mushrooms.  So many places don't serve mushrooms on their cheese steaks and I love mushrooms.  For my side I ordered potato salad.  It was fine picnic style.  Nothing remarkable.

A coupon was used at the end of the meal to order a dessert.  We got a slice of carrot cake.  This was good carrot cake too.  You could see the fresh carrots throughout.  The spice level was spot on.  There was a good helping of chopped walnuts both in the cake and on the frosting.  The frosting did not tast much like cream cheese as I like but it was fine.

I was very nervous that I might get food poisoning. 

The hostess was nice, not charging us, and they got security involved to take a statement in the event that I got sick. It was disappointing that they never called me the next day to check to see how I was feeling, but that goes with the territory, I guess.

Mistakes happen I guess, but the waitress said , ""The steaks are marinated because they are of lesser quality"". I've had great steaks (Canal Street), steaks that were in the freezer for awhile (with lesser taste), and even cheaper quality steaks but nothing tasted like this. Late night steak specials at other restaurants, (Ellis Island, etc) cost about the same, and are MUCH MUCH better.

At best the steak was spoiled, at worse, I don't want to speculate. It's ironic that the Orleans has the best steak restaurant in town (Canal Street) and the worst as well.",GosVWmEi8tClv9zFxjy0eg,0,0,1,y6PX5WKGlnp9_ZosAvehTw

Mom had the BBQ Burger - All beef patty, topped with cheddar cheese, bacon & onion strings, smothered in bbq sauce.  The burger was cooked well.  Good sauce on top.  Onion rings instead of strings but overall tasty.

It was very late so we happen to be craving breakfast and where in the neighborhood, literally passing by so we stopped. 

We all ordered the steak and eggs breakfast which sounded good at the time.

First of all the SERVICE sucks! The waiter was as excited about his job as he was to go and have his balls waxed! We will revisit this and the reasons behind it coming up.

My meal comes and my toast is burned black, I had asked when I placed my order that my toast please not be burned. Perhaps that is just one of my pet peeves, I just can't do burned toast so I always inform in advance as a courtesy to them and I.

My toast is replaced 10 minutes later, sighs. My steak was tough and rubbery, had I not had a steak knife it would have been barbarian style eating this night!

My scrambled eggs were overcooked and rubbery, the taste of that bite in my mouth was FOUL. That is another thing  I dislike is over cooked eggs, I am a cook and that is a No No on my list and a mistake that people often make while preparing eggs. So I asked the server if he would replace them for over easy instead. The server comes back later with a plate and fork to scrape the scrambled eggs off of my plate. This was one of the most awkward and weird things that I have encountered in my years of dining. As this is happening for what seemed an eternity, my friends are and I are looking at each other completely buffoon baffled.
