9376,2017-11-26,0,pNVRNptxW2u_WhQ0Fs-g9A,When this place opened it was wonderful. It slowly declined to the point at which we gave up on them. In the spirit of nostalgia we finally ordered again. We ordered a pepperoni and extra cheese pizza. On a smallish large pizza we got 17 pepperonis and shuddered to think about the amount of cheese that the people that didn't ask for extra cheese got. When we called and spoke to the manager she succinctly told us that all toppings are standardized and pepperonis max out at 20 per pie. That's 2&1/2 per slice. That's far too few. This company's M.O. is the same which dictates how many pickles and how much ketchup McDonald's puts on a hamburger. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! BUY PIZZA HUT OR GRUBHUB METRO PIZZA!!!,a-3qWtHY-X8D9kocRwOdDg,0,0,1,qCdn2NHTdPMlrb-jpVcBsA

You can always just stomach it if if you don't really like it but this was just gross! Soggy, soggy through most of it. I had mushroom and bell peppers. There were 6 times more bell peppers than mushrooms. I think they used one mushroom on a large at most. I like pretty much ANY pizza so the fact that I threw this out says volumes! I would have enjoyed a frozen pizza from the grocery store more!  It really sucks too because I wanted to believe the good reviews on here because its so close to my house but unfortunately, I have to side with the bad!",PKrnfSpE3tb8j1WvSWGMRg,2,0,1,Sl7ACnx6Y31GWOU6cmTf2g

The pizza is good, as good as you can do for this neighborhood, that's for sure. It's tasty sauce and high quality cheese and crispy crust. I'd like a little more chewiness, but it's hard to do with the water in Vegas and only a very few guys have figured it out. 

The wings are really great, properly sauced (lightly) and crispy. Ranch dressing is damn fine as well. I wish they'd throw a couple celery sticks in with the wings, however. It's tradition. Salads are good too. 

Bring the price of a pizza pie down two bucks and this place would get five stars. I can eat half a pie easy, they are small!!  All told, Southern Highlands is better off with these guys here.",Pdkr6ajlAYWApTOXbni2hw,0,0,4,b-kOv5ONzO5Y3sV_GJ8jog

The restaurant is pretty small, but comfortable.  They only do lunch three times a week (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), but when we don't feel like cooking, the delivery service, close proximity, and incredible prices ($10 14"" large cheese) will make this a new staple for the family.

This is the first time that we've been here. Wanted to try it out since we pass here almost everyday. 

After our first experience, it'll most likely be our last unless there's major changes. 

We ordered our pizza and were told it would take about 15-20 minutes. well that time came and went. we ended up waiting nearly an HOUR for our pizza to come out. 

We were hoping it would taste good. But it's a basic pizza. nothing really special about it. we also ordered the Garlic bread. we were told that they were really good. Sorry but it was very basic as well. i'd take little cesar's crazy bread sticks over that one any day. 

that pizza was not worth the nearly 1 hour wait.

- The woman who answered the phone was nice, not something I would yell from the roof tops as amazing customer service, but she was nice and did what I needed her to do, take my order.
- Delivery was on time with the quote of 45 minutes, which mean it was delivered 15 minutes after they technically closed. 
- I liked the thin crust, my pizza was a small with ham and black olives. Toppings were evenly distributed, maybe a little light on the black olives but that is probably just me cause I've been craving them for 2 days.

This place offers thin crust only (which ends up crisp kind of like a cracker and probably thinner than a cracker) - I do like a crisp crust but I know some don't and won't like this pizza at all. We had the garlic sticks and margarita pizza. Both were packed with lots of roasted garlic. If you're not a fan of garlic, I'd suggest you pass on anything that has ""garlic"" on the list - think we ate a whole clove of garlic!!

The pizza sauce that comes with the sticks is a bit thin for my liking. I like my sauce thick. This was more like tomato sauce.  The sticks are made from the same dough as the pizza so super thin, tons of cheese, and like I said earlier tons of garlic.",XALnd2JbUB_tnj0sNSOThg,0,0,4,iSKxPz-EWGBb-Bip4YmCoQ

I ordered a Margherita and a supreme plus box of frys. The Margherita was caked in garlic chunks, had very little cheese and hardly any basil!!! Taste horrible!! The supreme looked like the Red Baron kind you purchase at Smiths, but Red Baron taste a million times better!! The frys $3.75 for like 10 frys and their frozen steak frys you buy in the big bag from again Smiths for like $2 bucks. 2- pizzas and frys $35 bucks, I feel so ripped off that I had to write a review.

They charged 50 cents to sub blue cheese for ranch and didn't honor their usual large cheese pizza deal. 

To top it...they screwed up my order...again. Ordered a plain cheese pizza for my picky son and it came in as a pepperoni. The second pizza did not have evenly distributed toppings.

On the phone, the guy justified the mistakes, did not say sorry, never offered money back and said he would only make a new cheese pizza to replace the pepperoni. He said I could come in to get it and did not offer to have it delivered. When I asked, he said it would be 45 minutes. I came in. 

When I got there, again, no apology, no refund offer. I told him it would be my last time in here after giving them this second chance. We conversed for a minute and I left. I'm done with their overpriced, poorly prepared product.",EdK-6ooP3RCyNNcx4CXdrw,5,0,1,B1llYawVzAjKAxZR3zvmrA

Since this place is less then a mile from my house, I was hoping this place would be good or at least decent.  Unfortunately this was not the case.

For $16 I got a large pizza with burnt crust.  It was a very thin pizza without a lot of toppings or flavor at all. Definitely overpriced.

You can make a much better pizza at home for 6 dollars.  Even pizza hut or dominoes would be preferable to this.

My question is why go to all the trouble and cost to open up a pizza joint and then make extremely mediocre pizza.  Heck, the ingredients don't cost much - pile them on at least if your going to use crappy quality stuff.  Very disappointed  in this place.",pHQcEJbsYThyl_861tc8ug,11,4,2,xfnqsk-8UiEs95hH7ZRB1Q

I had one bite of flat breadstick, but the seasoning was way overdone and just gross.  We actually THREW AWAY PIZZA.
