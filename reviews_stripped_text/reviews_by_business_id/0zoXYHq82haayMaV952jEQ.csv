I waited about 30 minutes inside before I asked someone about my order. They brought it out and said they forgot to bring it out and it was cold. THEN I looked inside and everything I ordered was wrong. It gets better. They then brought out my new order which was also wrong. So I've been waiting 45 minutes for 1 turkey burger and I'm quite disappointed,m0MH5zWr-VpIFGhTXIW33A,0,0,2,5_cYG1Gzp2q35bSUUPDggg

I'm not either .  I went there after working out and I was starving, i figured I'd have a nice healthy salad. I ordered the large Albacore Salad , the guy at the front said it was good ,  when I opened it I almost peed my pants , it was 5 pieces of bibb lettuce , 2 cherry tomato's , a scoop of canned tuna and Dijon mustard (not mustard dressing) this was the large too , 
Generally I like to go to a place more then once to give an open minded review, but I'm not sure if I could bring myself back to give it another chance. The Daily Wellness is a much better place !",UTmcw54zYdCYZMh2YA4ruA,4,2,1,tX2mQdq3VhdSL6uVRZKJlA

I have also had one of their wraps, forget the name but it's packed with a ton of vegetables and comes with tofu fries.

471998,2017-06-30,0,0zoXYHq82haayMaV952jEQ,"The best I can say is that the food was edible. That's the good part. 

The place caters to paleo and vegan type people, so it's going to be more expensive, but it substantially so. They are a food and smoothie shop with an open kitchen, but do not have enclosed blenders, so there is a huge amount of noise. Also, they do not appear to have run cycles on the blenders, so someone will turn one on, and walk away to do something else, and leave it running. One was left going for 5 minutes non stop. 

The food: to say that it was worth it would be an overstatement. One entree was the shrimp, cous cous and asparagus. For 13 dollars, there were literally 5 shrimp. My cheese steak was greasy to a level that was borderline inedible (It's a cheese steak, so that's par for the course.) The jicama fries tasted like nothing and overall everything was bland and boring.  The food had all of the outward appearances of a place that isn't trying all that hard.

551163,2013-03-17,1,0zoXYHq82haayMaV952jEQ,"While this place is fine and technically proficient, I was not wowed or amazed by my meal, and for the price, I would not come back here again.  I did the make your own meal where you pick a protein, a ""green"", a ""grain"" and a sauce.  The chicken was done well and was juicy, the quinoa was a bit on the al dente side for me, but again was fine, and avocado is avocado.  What I did not care for was how they served it.  It was on a large plate, with everything separate and not touching.  I felt like someone who had OCD fixed the plate.  I would've preferred a bowl where I could mix the things together with the sauce, since quinoa isn't exactly easy to get on a fork with chicken and avocado already on it.  Quinoa is also rather bland by itself.

I also got the Thai Ginger soup, which was more like a thick yellow curry with nothing in it.  I love ginger, and couldn't really taste it in this soup, which was disappointing to me, as it's the reason I ordered it.

I would honestly give this place 2.5 stars, more on the lines of ""meh"" than A-ok, and that's mainly because the service here was decent and the people working behind the counter were nice and helpful.  I would honestly rather go to the Sweet Tomatoes down the street as it's about the same cost depending on what you order.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,2,0,3,e6GCgXSra9mEHoj-_g6RDg
596748,2013-12-19,0,0zoXYHq82haayMaV952jEQ,"I am currently a vegan and thought this place would be a great place to grab a healthy 'juice'. So I come here with my dad and he orders a parfait and I order a green 'juice' and the total comes to about $16 dollars with tip. I thought that was a tad on the expensive side but I know the prices of juice are very expensive because of the amount of vegetables and fruits that go into a juice (I worked at a juice bar for about two years so I understand juice pricing). So my 'juice' comes out and it's a smoothie? I do not know how they can call these smoothies juices?! It was frozen and it was really sweet for something that was considered a green juice. I was very disappointed and felt very mislead. My dad did not like his parfait either (too sugary). As a health nut and a biochemist I would not consider this place to be healthy at all. Albeit I have not tried any other items but i will assure you that I will not be coming back to try anything else. The only time that any one should go sugar load there is after a very High intensity work out. The only reason I have this place two stars is because the service was lovely. 

A note for the greens and proteins owners: 
I would recommend rewording the menu so it is not so misleading. I know you mean well and have a great idea but for people educated on health and wellness it is very misleading.",2LbrMbv1ATnrNs00hsrUjw,0,0,2,bjgYGIs8n6pNkBkIpktE_Q

Priscilla assured me that it was alright and that they would re-make it when I could come by later in the day, all I needed was to give them a 10-15 minute window.

Margherita Pizza (Low-fat mozzarella, tomatoes, roasted garlic, and basil) - To my surprise, i didn't know there was roasted garlic in this. If anything, all i noticed was the huge amount of mozzarella cheese on the pizza. They have different crusts you can pick. thin pizza crust (normal), lavash (a persian? flat bread?), and something else. Not sure what lavash was or the other one (and this was my friends pizza anyway but i was ordering/paying) so i decided to get the normal thin pizza crust. Flavor overall, like a normal margherita pizza. Only thing was i hope they can amp up the roasted garlic flavor (or maybe i can request for more/additional roasted garlic... XD garlic lover om nom nom) and the crust, maybe they can bake it longer. It was a little soft for my taste. The edge crust, it was nice and crispy, but anything under the toppings, was a little, floppy =X

Bison Cheese Steak Wrap (Red onions, peppers, low-fat mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato) - this order was for me. I thought it was quite interesting and ive never had bison before. something new to try for me. Comes with either a side of tofu fries or jicama fries and a pickle. The pickle was a normal pickle spear (yum). I opted for the tofu fries (curious but definitely not a stranger to tofu). Nicely fried. A little underseasoned but still tasted yummy (i like tofu anyway). As for the wrap, you get a choice of either a savoy cabbage wrap, wheat wrap, spinach wrap, or whole wheat bun. I opted for the spinach wrap. Overall, it looked decent and yummy. While i ate it, it was dripping a lot of juices/oil. Almost made it seem like this wrap was heavier/fattier than it really was. First experience in trying bison? uhm if i wasnt told it was bison, id almost call it beef. Overall, flavored well but a bit messy to eat (drippy drippy ....) Im not sure how healthy this wrap was but after eating it, i didnt feel so healthy. LOL  

Overall, nice place. A bit on the pricey side. These two items added up to i believe around $24? I guess a price to pay for fresh/organic? ingredients. May try other things next time since i think i picked the fattiest item on the menu.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,3,6bGpKEm7MFVXzjaaFmwD1Q

I came across Greens and Proteins while driving along eastern avenue. Now I'm used to cooking and making my own healthy greens and protein foods, so I have a bit higher standard for places like this. First of all, they are relatively expensive but this is understandable considering the healthy ingredients which tend to be natural or organic. 

My friend ordered one of the actual meals while I ordered one of the green drinks, I believe it was the one with chocolate flavor. Anyways, my drink tasted horrible. Maybe it was too healthy but I couldn't swallow it. If you are into this type of thing, maybe its for you. My friend ordered something I believe with the eggs and it was ok.

The environment is very nice. When we went the place was booming so I have no complaints there. The staff is friendly and it gives off a healthy, clean, fitness vibe.

Review 11/4/17: We've tried a few more times since my last review (which somehow never got posted). They've changed menus several times (with price increases accordingly). Today we ordered 2 more smoothies specifying ""no ice"" and ""no honey"". They were both so sicky-sweet we had to trash them after a few sips. Apparently (and confirmed by the server), the sugar comes from the ""chocolate chips). Really? They used to include Stevia, honey, and the banana as the sugar sources. My conclusion is they switched to a cheaper sweetened chocolate. Sigh!

I have laryngitis otherwise I would have requested a do over in the store. The lady that took my order for a green ginger limeade was wearing plastic gloves that she handled my money with. I then witnessed her sweeping the floor with the same gloves on & then delivering a meal with the same gloves. That customer sent his meal back for more rice. She made my drink with the same gloves on & I think she was having a rough night as my drink was devoid of any ginger or lime & was watered down. Just as I got my drink another customer came back in to complain & have their green ginger limeade remade as it was waterey. Please have your employees change their gloves as the above is very unhygienic. I should have also asked for a redo on my drink.,_7Q8ieyyW57NwidRqzZzKw,0,0,1,gMMmh80Z00hHfOIqXIs4Bg

I ordered the angus burger with lettuce pocket (instead of bun) with tofu fries.  Angus burger was fine, not salty which is good.  The tofu fries were salty because of the seasoning.  So healthwise, its kind of a wash with the tofu fries lol.

My wife ordered the build your own with angus patty, kale, and sweet potato mash.  She seemed to enjoy it because the kale was steamed and not sodium bombed.  She also ordered a ginger limeade which was too sweet for her taste.

Drink: Note the smoothies are like a meal so you probably don't want that AND a full meal unless you are splitting.   The juices are all very nice and clean.  Favourite is the Wellness drink.

On that visit, we understood why our food might of seemed rushed (wrap was wrapped loosely, pizza was not as yummy, etc).

There were only BBQ on 2 of the 8 slices!!! I don't quite understand how that can happen.  Next, We ordered ""add avocado"" on the wrap.

As a reminder... we go to the location on rainbow often and order the same items. We are definitely going to stop going to this location as every visit is disappointing.

That said, the breakfast that was served to the table next to me looked amazing and I can't wait to try it.

This go around though, hammered down on the ""build my own"" with ostrich (check another animal off my ""got ya bitch"" list of animals consumed!), sketti squash and some mashed sweet taters. Also got an antioxidant blast smoothie (berry mix).

So, the chow.
Ostrich - very lean, and decent. Tried it without the citrus bbq sauce first, and it was ok. Was hoping for a bit of seasoning or something, but, it was just cooked meat and no seasoning help. With the citrus bbq, not bad at all and solid chunk of meat. Texture was and cooked temp were not bad either. All in all, a solid slab of lean meat.

Sketti squash - tasteless and didn't seem to be cooked enough. Was very disappointed in this one. I'm usually a huge fan of this and make it my own quite a bit (gives me something to do when my madre delivers 12 giant squashes from her garden). But, a little citrus bbq made it tolerable to wolf down like a desert coyote.

Mashed sweet taters - very good. Was really happy to see this on the menu as a carb option. I hadn't had them in a while, and was pleasantly surprised to have a solid plate of mashed sweets. Perfectly fluffy, not stringy (which sweet taters can be when mashed thanks to the fibers), and solid flavor. Only thing missing was a chance to throw some cinnamon on them. If you've  never done that before, give it a go. Fantastic. I promise.

Antioxidant smoothie - Great flavor, miss on the texture. I knew it'd be a bit think and chunky thanks to the apples (without an amazing juicer, apples are a prick to deal with). But, was hoping this place would have a juicer that'd take that away. Not so. 

In any event, smoothie and food rang up over $24. Considering the ingredients and if I were to order something similar elsewhere, I'm sure it'd be close to that too. So, not overly fussy with the price.",SU-iAuGsoDnws0oFG4VO8A,0,0,3,mXcd7hyQFQkMpw6eXYoqZg

I also love how they have quite a few local business cards and promo materials at the pickup counter where you get your drinks- shows that they are involved in the local community, which I really like to see.

That being said, their smoothies and wraps are each around $8, which sounds about on par with other similar businesses- and for the smoothies I would say it's about right.
But I was not impressed with my tofu/chorizo breakfast wrap- I asked for it in a spinach wrap, which I use frequently at home to make my own wraps, and this one was not particularly full. Most bites had more overlapping layers of tortilla than filling or veggies. On top of that, the menu lists the wrap as coming with ""a side of tofu homefries""- this sounded really cool to me and I was excited to check it out.
Imagine my surprise when I open my take out box in my car and realize that a ""side"" consists of exactly THREE crouton-sized pieces of tofu. They were tasty, but considering I spent $8 on my meal and my take out box was half empty, I'm not pleased. I genuinely don't know if someone was in a hurry and forgot my side, or if three pieces really constitutes a portion- it doesn't to me.

I might come back, but it won't be for food- which is really disappointing, because everything sounds great.

Truly is no place better in Vegas comes too healthy menu. Literally they breakdown the calories on just about every menu item. Offer Build Your Own Custom Meal pick your proteins, greens, grains, and sauces. Again they have everything broken down too calories. It was my first time daunting too pick choose as my first taste. I kind of in the mood of burger so went with the Ostrich Burger and try so got the 7 Vegetable Broccoli Cheese Soup. 

The soup was good. It nothing Wow factor but overall solid soup. It nice creamy base soup but had nice thickness and full body with the cheese (assume cheddar they use. The color really nice. Times order any vegetable soup not have that vibrant or look like vegetable. Soup was right on. Nice HOT!!

The Ostrich Burger was delicious. I believe one first times having it. It lean meat. So thinking might be dried out but still moist and had nice flavor. The garnishes of lettuce and tomatoes really fresh looking added too my burger. The sides lot too choose from but went with the fried tofu. I scared at first. I enjoy tofu but not seasoned right just bland. The fried tofu was hit for me. It had nice seasonings on the outside and enjoy the aioli dipping sauce for them. They also offer Bison as protein. I see that in my future...

They cook everything too order so takes time but very much worth the wait. The only thing not fan of is the interior is REALLY boring.

In my pursuit of this fun filled journey of Greens n Proteins I've found that when i can combine healthy food with flavor I become happy. From Juices to shakes . Wraps to bison cheese steaks potato fries to Quinoa Salads. Its definitely a place I leave feeling satisfied and not disgusted with myself! Their service has been great the 4-5 times I've been there.

Frankly, I couldn't justify paying more for juice than I paid for my entrée. (Huge cheapo moment). 

I enjoyed my satay as it was a good amount of skewers and actually tasted like I had ordered them from a Thai restaurant. The wrap was okay... lacked a little flavor as I couldn't taste any sauce, but it wasn't bad. I liked the tofu fries I ordered along with it.

There was a gentleman behind the counter instead of a woman. He was nice and was able to make my order vegan. He was also kind enough to sub out a non vegan sauce for one I would like. 

I ordered a veggie burger without the bun since the bun wasn't vegan and a gluten free vegan bun was $3 more. After consuming the burger, the bun wouldn't have made a difference. It was bland and...well bland. The tofu fries on the other hand were amazing! Add the BBQ sauce and wow! 

Service was a lot better from my first visit last year. I was asked if I needed anything else after my food was delivered and I asked if silverware was in a specific area. The gentleman then offered to grab them for me instead. The staff seemed more cheerful than what I experienced last year.

Decided to check this place out for the first time with a friend and unfortunately, can't see myself returning.  I ordered a rough cut roma tomato salad and the tortilla soup.  My friend ordered what looked like a mix of steamed veggies and rice (steamed broccoli, kale, mixed squash/zucchini).   The salad they brought out for me was mainly radicchio and frisee (the red/purple lettuce and the light green ""fuzzy"" lettuce just in case you're not sure what that is); two of the most bitter greens that I'm least fond of.  The dressing was a bitter vinaigrette with lemon, I believe.  The tomato slices appeared to have been sitting out for a while; not fresh at all.  There were some spinach leaves thrown in along with some cucumber.  I took a bite and was hit with bland bitterness.  At first, I thought there just wasn't dressing but the guy explained that there was dressing on it.  The tortilla soup came out and did not look like soup - it appeared very thick, almost like orange hummus.  I dipped in and it tasted very sweet, like pumpkin, without any type of ""mexican/tortilla"" flavor.  I couldn't force myself to eat it although I was starving.  I told my friend she should try the soup to see if it was just me.  She seemed very hesitant by the look of it.  She took a dip and stated, ""There is no flavor....it's just...sweet?""  I didn't quite understand what I had ordered.  Her meal came out; just steamed veggies and brown rice.  I tried some and it was fine but I can't fathom paying the $13 for this when it is one of the easiest things to make at home....steamed veggies and rice.  I lost out on $12 myself.  I couldn't eat my food and soon pushed it to the side so I could just focus on hang time and not the hunger pangs in my stomach.

THOSE WITH CELIAC'S/GLUTEN INTOLERANCE BE CAREFUL: see below

I was very excited to discover this chain had opened up on the southwest part of town. They are ingeniously located near LVAC, making it easy to get a healthy recovery meal after your workout. We ordered: Pumpkin spice chai latte, veggie garden burger, and bison burger. Total after tip= $38.10 (we took our food to go). A little on the high end $$$. Our food came out pretty quickly, but our smoothie took longer than expected. I was hoping to get that first and sip on that as an appetizer while we waited for our food. I don't know if they forgot about our smoothie or was just slow on making it. I did notice however, people after me get their drink before me, they also knew him on a first name basis and gave him the extra out of the blender in a separate cup. They should treat everyone as if they are a regular. Talk about not making me feel special. 

~Pumpkin Chai Tea Latte; Chai Tea, Pumpkin, Green Cabbage, Carrots, Butternut Squash, Flax Seeds, Ginger, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Walnuts, Agave Nectar. This was really good and very filling. Although the cabbage was pronounced, the smoothie was well balanced and tasted raw (the way I like it).

~Bison burger w/ jicama fries; choice of swiss or cheddar cheese, lettuce tomato and onion on a whole grain bun. He wished he got it with cheddar rather than swiss. ""Jicama fries"" are just sliced jicama lightly seasoned with what looks/tastes paprika. 

*Veggie garden burger; I was extremely excited because I'm a sucker for alfalfa sprouts. I asked the cashier if the veggie patty was gluten free, as I have had a difficult time finding a veggie patty that does not use ""wheat gluten"" as a binder. He asked someone on the cooking line, who I assume was a manager, and he said ""yes, it's gf, the patty is soy based protein"" I took their word for it and gambled the risk. Sure enough I think the veggie patty is glutenous so BEWARE to those with celiac's/gluten intolerance. I got sick, as I do from eating or cross-contaminating with gluten/wheat. I have yet to bring my concern to the attention of the staff. Moving forward, the burger was eh-okay. My gluten free bun was hard (it's difficult to get a soft, buoyant bun using gluten free flour, especially if you're taking your item to go. In the future I will dine in. I ordered my burger with tofu fries. I was told that they dust the tofu blocks with rice flour and fry it in corn oil, so the oil should not be a point of cross contamination, as there isn't anything else with regular flour going into the oil. My burger came with the sprouts, bibb lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I also added vegan cheese, it's shredded.

We also added avocado to our sandwiches ($0.75/burger) for a quarter of an avocado (rip off). I don't mind paying extra for modifications, but make it worth my while and not be so skimpy! At least give me a half an avocado for that price, so that I can have it in every bite as opposed to just half my burger. I was charged extra for vegan cheese, again this would be fine, but there was less than a teaspoon sprinkled on my burger, with a $1.00 up-charge.

Although the food is pricey, it's raw, healthy, and typically quick, right up my alley. I will be back because there is not many others around like this and to inform them of my gf veggie patty concerns. There are just a few ""tweeks"" they need to adjust before they get the 5th star from me.I hope they properly label their menu on their website and physical menu so gluten free & vegan items are clearly marked. Just remember they do not operate out of a certified gluten free kitchen, but it seems that for the most part they handle issues like cross contamination okay.

Service was exceptional. There was a constant line (with one cashier) at 3:00pm. He was very nice and patient with me since I had a lot of questions.",BbnxMn4ysHRqvXULXehwyg,3,2,4,1L_ZnHLrtlfwR-HqqRy3Dg

Anyways...my boyfriend and I wanted to start eating healthier. We're not health freaks but we don't want to become obese one day either. He heard about this place through his co workers. The thought of ""making your own meal"" intrigued him so we were willing to give it a try. We walked in knowing their prices were on the higher end side.

We both decided to get the ""make your own meal"" plate. To sum it up, PORTIONS ARE SMALL. It was actually perfect for me because I get full easily anyways but for all you ""big eaters""...be warned. This MAY NOT fill you up. Yes, it IS a healthy restaurant afterall. Yes, the whole point in small portions is because it is healthy for you. But I'm just saying....
 It may fill me up but PERSONALLY, it still left something for me to desire.

We also got two drinks. He got that green drink (sorry forgot the name of it but I've seen a lot of Yelpers get it) and I got the berry antioxidant smoothie. They tasted different...but a good different. Man....after drinking this, it puts Jamba Juice and Tropical Smoothie to shame. Greens and Proteins smoothie drinks tasted natural and healthy. You can tell it has natural ingredients and fresh fruits and veggies...unlike all the other sugar and crap that maybe be in Jamba and Tropical.

So why 3 stars and not a higher rating? 
-2 stars for the price. It seriously pays to be healthy. =/ I think with 2 drinks and 2 meals ran our bill to $30+ ....for that price, we could have went to Cheesecake Factory lol

My order came about 20 min later maybe even a bit longer which I think is too long for a fast casual restaurant. When I took the first bite of the pizza all I could taste was the BBQ sauce. While the BBQ sauce did grow on me after a few bites, I almost thought it tasted a little too unique. Additionally, if a ""traditional"" BBQ sauce is not used, the menu should specify the type of BBQ sauce being used (citrus BBQ sauce). Now on to the chicken, I did not like the spice on the chicken and it was a little dry. The positives were that the pizza is low calorie so you can finish the whole thing; the fat free ranch is delicious; the lavash bread gave the pizza a nice crunch.

I am not sure if he was the manager or what, but regardless of how busy you are, you need to maintain a certain level of professionalism and care about people, especially food allergies. He was dismissive and after we ordered, I was sure they didn't prepare his food correctly. I ordered an albacore salad and it was just ""okay"". My husband had requested just a bed of rice with bison and veggies, I believe it may have been a custom order. He really liked his, and didn't have a reaction to any of the food, which is a thumbs up. I hate to leave negative reviews but I just wasn't feeling after the guy was a little abrasive. I WILL go back again because I know people have good and bad days and life happens. The smoothie I had was great however. It was a pretty busy place so I look forward to trying it again.

3257850,2013-03-09,0,0zoXYHq82haayMaV952jEQ,"I saw this on my way into Zabbas last week and mentally bookmarked this place.  I am always down to try a new place that is supposedly healthy.   Wow, was I surprised.  In the first 48 hours I had eaten here for lunch, dinner and lunch again!

Walking into the place was a little daunting.  This place was so busy that there was literally a line out the door.  All the tables were filled and we were worried we'd have nowhere to sit.  This place is very hectic loud like a high school cafeteria!   The floors are nicely tiled, the tables are high end wood, as are the chairs.  There are booths along a window that, if one can grab, are pretty comfortable to sit at.

The menu consists of Breakfast items (until 11am), Soups, Salads, Pizzas, BURGERS and Wraps/Sandwiches.  Calorie Counts are next to their popular items!  To drink, there is your standard coke fountain with a dedicated dispenser for WATER.  :)

The place is very busy, but still manages to be clean.  There are no trashcans in sight, you just leave your table and the staff quickly cleans up after you.

The first time out I ordered the Ostrich Burger with Swiss Cheese and Tofu Fries.  Despite the cost of being over $15 for my order, it was delicious and I felt it was well worth it.  The burger was a tiny bit dry, but delicious nonetheless.  Burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato and onion.  The tofu fries were unique.  I wasn't impressed at first but I later realized it was because the fries weren't cooked all the way and it was still squishy in the middle.  This meal I would rate a 8 out of 10.

Later that night I came back again and the place seemed to be less busy.  This time I ordered the Turkey Wrap with bacon and a spinach tortilla and Jicama fries (it's like eating a raw apple sliced up like fries).  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  I loved it - I was very impressed.

On to my next meal here at lunch:  This time I ordered the Bison Burger Swiss cheese, medium rare with Jicama Fries.  The burger was just the right amount of juicy absolutely incredible.   Where else can you eat a burger like this guilt free?  I also ordered a Green Leaf Berry Blast shake with almond milk.  It was very good and satisfied my cravings for fresh fruit.

Be warned, however.  Buying a shake with one of their meals is like eating two meals in one.  I was completely stuffed by the end of my visit.

Today for lunch I ordered the Turkey Burger with Swiss and half Jicama fries, half tofu fries.  To drink I got the Apple Pie Smoothie with Almond milk.  I was impressed with the burger.  Very juicy and tasty.  The Jicama fries are spot on.  Just like eating an apple again and served raw with paprika.  The Tofu fries this time however was even better than I remembered.  This is because they were actually cooked all the way through.  If I can get tofu fries prepared like this again, I think Jicama is in trouble!  On the other hand, the Apple Pie Smoothie left more to be desired. I am not a fan of this.

I am sure to visit again to try the Bison Wrap with Spinach tortilla.  My friends have all been getting it, but before I settle into my ""norm"" i wanted to try as much as possible here.  If my norm is the bison wrap, so be it. :) 

This place has definitely earned a solid top entry for my work lunch rotation.

I am only giving four stars for a simple reason: the guy that took my order at the register the past two times doesn't seem very friendly at all. Not a smile; not even a forced smile - it's like I'm bothering him when ordered.  On top of that, I don't EVER get a receipt from him or even offered a water cup.  The other guy, who appears to be either a manager or owner is very friendly and helpful.

Other suggestions to the owners if you are reading: You need more tables and seating - It appears the suite next to you is empty, consider expanding. :)",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,2,0,4,YMgTgJArd-2Mk5VJbEDcIw

Chicken breast I weighed it at 5-6 oz cooked. Which is 6-8 raw.  That should be about 340 calories. 40-50 calories uncooked per ounce not 272.,Nf_Jw_W_CwOz5WJ7ApSMxg,0,0,3,ByN3_ennoMG9sAXAvTYYjQ

The Southwest Tofu & Chorizo Burrito caught my eye; the idea sounded interesting, and so did its description: scrambled tofu and soy chorizo, tomatoes, cilantro, and Anaheim chilies, wrapped in a spinach tortilla. A side of tofu home fries originally comes with this, but you can replace that with another side listed on their menu. Also, you can choose to sub the tortilla with lettuce. With that being said, the burrito only looks good on paper. In this case, I would've preferred actual meat than the tofu because of the spices and ingredients. 

One cool thing to mention about this place is that the calories for each of the menu items -- excluding breakfast -- are listed. Prices for foods seem reasonable, much more reasonable than other ""healthy"" eateries by my gym. They do make smoothies and juices here, but I think $7.50 for a smoothie is too much, even with a Yelp check-in for $1.00 off.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,2,3,13EToPCrPiZbcDDeQc0WYw

The execution can be a bit spotty and the food, while decent, won't make you forget about all the unhealthy (and more delicious) alternatives around town.

The girl behind the counter raved about the tofu fries but I wasn't a fan. I've never been much of a tofu fan and the fries failed to convert me.

My favorite part of their menu is the ""Build your own custom meal"" where you pick a protein, grain, green, and sauce of your choosing. It's perfect for when you want a quick meal, don't feel like cooking, and aren't in the mood for traditional fast food. The pork tenderloin with the balsamic reduction was good, but the portabello mushroom was overcooked. Portion sizes are on the small side so don't expect to walk away full.

I ordered a chicken parmagian from their daily specials - it was created with a leaning towards Paleo: spaghetti squash topped with chicken breast and covered in a marinara and (this parts not Paleo) cheeses.   It came with a side dish of cooked fresh spinach, which I topped with a basalmic reduction.  The spaghetti squash was well drained and cooked perfectly - when I make it at home, it's squishy and unevenly cooked!  The marinara had a nice fresh flavor and the cheeses were melted in goey goodness.

I ordered their bison cheese steak on a spinach wrap which is about 600+ calories for $10.99. It also comes with their yummy tofu fries and dipping sauce! The cheese steak is delish and the bison is super lean. Bison is just naturally full in flavor so if you're looking for a good manly meat that's lean but tastes like cow (mmoooo) go bison! I also ordered their white chocolate veggiechino which is 500+ calories for $6.99. I chose the almond milk (you can choose the option of soy or Almond milk) it was pretty delish with grains of grinded up coffee bean. If you're looking for a big caffeine kick I would not bet that the veggiechino will be a good pick me up especially if you're a coffee drinker. But as a sweet milky treat. I think it's a good choice.

Upon entering you can see the inside is actually really nice. I think it actually looks better than the one on eastern. The menu is pretty clear and precise. It ranges from green juices, green smoothies and then your food items. All the food items i would say are healthy, you can even get gluten free items or protein style for your burgers if you want.

I ordered from the create your own menu. Basically you pick a protein, 1 side and a grain and your choice of sauce. I picked bison patty for my protein and sauteed spinach, and grilled onions for my sides instead of getting a grain. I also ordered a wellness drink.

The bison patty was cooked as ordered it didn't strike me as anything amazing. It was kind of bland and dry. I'm assuming it was bland because it was healthier. The spinach and the onions tasted exactly as they should nothing special but was expected. The wellness drink was actually my favorite of all the items ordered it tasted really good for all the green vegetables in it. It was actually really sweet so i think they probably put more juice in it to mask the vegetable taste.

Overall place isn't bad but nothing special. One thing I must warn you about is, it is extremely overpriced! Looking at the prices i was surprised they charged so much for vegetables you can buy and make a whole weeks worth for the price the same price. 

Side note: there are also a lot of jacked up guys and girls in yoga pants that stop in because the LVAC is right next to it. So if you want to sit in and people watch it is a good place to do that.",fKqMqB36iwQuskyXB1kOtw,0,0,3,i986Y7lM9VSVMetbKy8Pzw

The Margherita pizza was simple but delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce, low-fat mozzarella cheese and slices of tomato with bits of basil garnishing. I wish I had gotten the gluten free version though! - I really love how they have the gluten free option. The portion was probably good for sharing with one other person. 

The smoothie was alright. The taste was leaning more towards the spinach and kale which I wasn't really fond of. I do love kale though but it was probably the spinach that was giving it a weird flavor. I'd give it a 3/5. 

There was also complimentary cucumber water which was a refreshing touch. The place itself is pretty spacious and busy but the service was fast and the workers were very nice.

The young lady who took my order, gave me a post with a number so she'd know where the food was to be delivered.  She soon brought my coffee which was very hot and enjoyable.

The Greek scramble consisted of scrambled egg whites with feta cheese, kalamata olives, basil, green peppers, onions, and was accompanied by tofu home fries.  Their information lists this at 309 calories.  I wasn't concerned so much about that as I was taste.

The taste was quite good.  The olives brought out the flavor of the feta and the tofu home fries were a treat.  There were some pieces of toasted pita to accompany the scramble.

I will stop in again and try something else.  The price was very reasonable and the patio dining was perfect before the hot days set in.

Albeit only 3 reviews, this is a new location on the Westside (i.e. the best side, throwing up the W!!).  If you read my review of the Eastern location, I too gave them 5 stars.  However, it's easy to dismiss these posts as biased ones since there is so little reviews.  I had to investigate because that's what I do.   

I am a fan of Greens & Proteins and one complaint about them is price.  Most of the items on the menu are pricey and to be honest, don't have much taste either.  Keep in mind, G&P is healthy and that includes you to have an healthy wallet. I'm not a baller by any means, but will splurge when quality proteins is what my body needs.  I also use to have food delivered to my home via ""Eat to Grow"".  This was pricey too and taste is only for the desirable.  I made my biggest gains on these meals and G&P is no different. 

I've tried their Salmon and Ostrich Burgers in the past.  At this location, I opted to try their Turkey.  You get 8 oz of clean protein and less fat with their Turkey Burger.  This meal is also served with their Jicama fries.  The turkey was pretty good, but the fries is something that made it into the basura with the quickness. After Lent, I will definitely come back for their Filet Mignon.  

I gave the other location 5 stars, but had to drop this location to 4 stars.  This G&P is more spacious, but missing that ambiance that the Eastern location has. Great people watching at the Eastern location.  Because this location is new, the staff is also new.  Knowledge is power and a newbie staff can mean weakness.  When I order at places like this, I like to know how much the servings are like protein count, total ounces, etc.  The staff actually had to go to the back and ask.  They also didn't know if they served fat-free ranch.  I know, I'm just getting picky but these are the things most health driven restaurants would know.  I'm sure by the next visit, they'll be more prepared. Thus, I will probably up their rating back to 5 stars. 

Still a fan of Greens and Protein.  Don't be surprised if you see multiple check in's from me at this joint.  This is a new and more spacious location.

He informed me that they do not use juicers at all but they blend their juices... Then that is not considered a juice! That is a blended vegetable drink. If I wasn't with my coworkers I would have asked for a full refund because I was not even able to drink it. I am on a strict juice diet and cannot have much fiber and that was definitely not in the description.

You would think when somebody advertises juices that it would be juice not blended and chunky ( gross)

- Turckey Burger plain wrapped in a Lettuce shell. It is amazing, low cal and low carb.

- Cup for water. This is a MUST. They have free cucmber infused water, it tastes wonderful. 
- Juice. The ginger limeade is my favorite! It is under 200 calories and packed with healthy fruits and veggies! i neer imagined I would crave a green juice, but it tastes sooo good! It is the perfect consistancy to drink and stays cold long enough to enjoy it.

I want to give it more stars, because I have really enjoyed both of the drinks I've purchased at this place.   

First time, I had the ""Green Leaf Berry Blast"".   A nice mix of berries and leafy greens.  It came out a sort of purplish-brown color but it really tasted great and filled me up.

The second time, I had the 'Wellness Drink', which is a mixture of green grapes, apples, limes, some other fruits and then a bunch of leafy greens.    The taste was fresh and fantastic, and it really hit the spot after my workout.    So yummy and it has all that good stuff in it.  

Customer service was fine both visits.   My drinks were ready in a snap.   The atmosphere of the place is inviting and comfortable and it works with their health-conscious atmosphere.   I could see myself eating here.

So why 3 stars?   I'm deducting one star because at 8 bucks a pop, well it seems a bit pricey for a cup of juice.  But that doesn't keep me away. 

The other star I am deducting for 2 reasons.   Lack of nutritional info and the use of agave nectar in every drink offering.   I track everything I take in, and I would think a place that serves up healthy food could offer more than a simple calorie count.  How much sugar is in these drinks?    Macros are important to my lifestyle.   I would like to see a more comprehensive breakdown.

And the agave is extra sweetener that is just unnecessary and really not a healthy choice IMO.

I am eager to try some of the food offerings.    I will update or offer up a better review at that time.",geGB7_3rveH9QAc-hf0hjg,0,0,3,qnQxVwgnk1Ox5I8VeFaS9A

Food was edible; I think I ordered the wrong thing. I got the Buffalo Spinach Wrap and was pretty disappointed.

I'll give this place another try in the hopes that something else I order is enjoyable. Otherwise, I just felt like I was paying triple price for grocery store deli food in order to say ""I'm healthy! I eat raw vegan carrots!.""",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,1,0,3,NHLScSJdqLLPMYZ5DK_AsA

The tofu fries are very tasty and amazingly seasoned, however the menu states they are BAKED when they are actually FRIED, they automatically lose two stars for the false advertisement (which I've complained to management several times and STILL haven't changed on their menu).

There are about 5 or 6 different fresh juices on their menu and they do taste good, but they could use a little more variety.  Nearly all of their juices contain grapes and agave nectar.  Their Wellness Drink, which contains spinach and kale, also adds too much pineapple, orange and agave, making this fresh juice overly sweet.

They are located across the LVAC so there are a lot of people coming from the gym seeking a healthy meal.  But don't be fooled!! A lot of their menu IS healthy however things like sauces, cheeses, dough, batter etc. almost defeat the purpose here.  If you're truly seeking wholesome order the plainest rawest things on their menu.

I go to greens & proteins for the convenience and taste, but think there are better similar establishments.  Also a little pricey but have a large menu to choose from.",b2Vh1q4rKvWPakdMw1nJlw,3,1,2,26Fko_4MTFBpumO_48WI3g

Came here Saturday evening because my boyfriend wanted something healthy and yummy.. I've had this place bookmarked forever and wanted to give it a go.. The only thing is I'm doing a detox which means no food so I just went with him to watch him eat and take big whiffs of his food LOL It is located right by LVAC on Flamingo/215 which is the perfect location for it. Everyone eating at G&P looks like either they just worked out, are about to work out or like they love working out.. Very healthy, clean and fresh feel to the place. You order at the counter and someone brings your food out to you. Everything on the menu looks so good and I love how they have the calorie count for everything. 

My man ordered: 
_The build your own protein plate with chicken breast ($9.99,) broccoli, cous cous and bbq sauce- I thought it was going to be a small portion but it was more than enough and it looked delicious~
_Hummus plate ($5.99) - comes with plain hummus and roasted pepper hummus, served with soft pita and crunchy lavosh~
_Green Shake Smoothie ($7.50) - I love how they don't add sugar to their smoothies... This smoothie in particular is over 600 calories though!!! But it is loaded with all the good stuff. I had some sips of this.. It's very rich & creamy and definitely would a great meal replacement! 

My bf said everything was very tasty and he had plenty left over..The prices are actually very reasonable compared to other ""healthy"" places and they cater to vegan, raw, gluten free and HCG diets! The service was great here too! Especially the guy who brought the food out.. Even though the silverware is self-serve by the fountain drinks he offered to go get them for my boyfriend and checked up on us a couple times~

This food also comes from SYSCO Company which a lot of items are frozen and GMO. 

Something that bothers me more than anything and I notice these things because I used to work for the health department, almost every time this younger boy is serving/making smoothies and the hispanic chef is cooking they are wiping there noses, faces, scratching there ears, or coughing (even with there gloves on), they don't wash there hands or change there gloves, they continue to cook and serve the food. I have seen them do something dirty every time I am in there with those 2 on shift. I couldn't believe I saw the chef sticking his finger inside his ear with his glove and continue to cook, I then cancelled my order and left. 

I hope the owner corrects this because I won't be back for a while after seeing that.

I was supposed to meet Suzy H. and her son here, but due to a miscommunication, she went to the Eastern location instead.  No problem.  Intending to share my food, it just meant that I ate two breakfast items all by myself, the Granola Crusted Whole Wheat French toast and the Greek Scramble.  Sure, I could have taken leftovers to go, but I just kept eating until there was nothing left but the parsley.  I guess I was hungry from my earlier swim, but it was also because the food was really good.  I'd been to the Eastern location about two years ago and had a so-so experience for dinner, so much so that I've never been back there.  This brunch, though, has changed my mind about G&P.  I would certainly come back anytime for a morning meal.  I had excellent service throughout, and, contrary to my own belief, the cost for breakfast wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be, $13.94 for both dishes.

They've also got pizza which was surprising for me. Gonna have to recommend the BBQ pizza one. The others don't sound appetizing to me personally. 

If you order their drinks, grab the epoxy app so you can get their virtual stamp card. Cashier told me their Wellness Drink was the most popular. It's pretty good - if you like grapes. 

My favorite has got to be their tofu fries! I always try to get an extra order to go :0). 

I've been here a few times and there are times where the food is bleh (depending on what you order) and other times they're decent. Aside from the tofu fries, nothing else has stood out to me so just give yourself a few visits to try various stuff.

The turkey club sandwich also wasn't too shabby. But it's definitely better than eating at Sweet Tomatoes every time I want something healthy.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,4,3,4,rKlkDZnE3XgfcNvyLOnpvg

I want to like this place but def still looking for other options. Came here with my gf cause she was in the mood for healthy and light got the bison wrap with tofu fries and the broccoli and cheese soup... lets start with the soup i know healthy places are known for bland food because sodium is a big factor when it comes to health but a nice little packet of salt which the supply and this soup was edible. Now the bison wrap, not bad, not great nothing special. The bison was again no flavor but noted this is a health food spot so understandable some sauce they provided made the wrap taste better and i ate it just fine. Now my main problem the ""TOFU FRIES""; if you like this you might as well eat cardboard probably taste better and better for you, this was horrible the texture and flavor was like processed plastic?! ive had similar tofu fries before and they were way better than this, def recommend trying the napkins. Overall i get where this place is going and not being a health nut i cant really complain i just wont eat here and let my gf enjoy it.",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,0,0,3,a2t9MAoNyw9H1Cg_AgkfXw

Why can't we ever have just like, a salad?

That's all I need when I visit Greens and Proteins. 

Their steak salad is divine. Perfectly cooked filet mignon, romaine, arugula, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, roma tomatoes & pickled onions with a caramelized onion vinaigrette. I know right?! It's my goto there, and I've also swapped out the filet for grilled chicken if I'm looking for something a bit ""lighter"".

The Ceasar Salad is simply delicious. Romaine Lettuce, parmesan cheese, parmesan crisp and EVOO Caesar dressing. Adding chicken is highly recommended.

5936865,2017-06-14,1,0zoXYHq82haayMaV952jEQ,"Plastic is a great material, but I would rather not have it in my smoothie. 
While visiting this location yesterday, I purchased a berry smoothie for my five year old and a Green Ginger Limeade smoothie for myself. 

While drinking my smoothie I felt an odd texture in my mouth, thinking it was a piece of a hard leaf of some sort , I chewed it only to find that it did not break up into smaller pieces as expected. When I pulled it out of my mouth it was a small piece of plastic that was the equivalent of laying 3 grains of rice end to end. I showed it to the very kind young lady who rang me up earlier and she said she was sorry and that she would share my finding with the manager. 

Thinking that this was just a fluke, I continued to sip my drink, only to find another piece of plastic about one fourth the size of the first. I went to the counter and asked to speak with a manager. The woman I was addressing informed me that she was the manager. I then explained that this was the second piece of plastic I had sucked through my straw. And she said that the night before, she had seen a piece of plastic in the grapes while they were removing the grapes from their packaging. She made a circle with her hand to show me the approximate size of said plastic piece,(approximately the size of a quarter), then went on to state that since it was clear, that made it very difficult to sort out of the grapes. 

I have visited this location in the past and had no issues. The employees and the manager were very pleasant and friendly during this visit. My problem is with the fact that the manager stated that she saw the plastic in the grapes, yet she did not take the time to stop the process of cleaning them in order to fish out the piece of plastic.  I can only think about the many health conscious patrons who come here expecting to have a healthy treat as I did.  In fact, her own baby ( that looked to be approximately 4 to 5 months old) was enjoying a smoothie and I just hate to think that someone else's child could have choked on that piece of plastic. 

In the future, I would suggest fishing the plastic out and training the employees to also keep a watchful eye for things that should not be present among the fruits and vegetables they juice. This whole thing could have been avoided by a very simple precaution.",LAAbbgZS41n-NvvpdM437A,0,0,1,jGgC4zw9-jwW_HKTTNRQPg
