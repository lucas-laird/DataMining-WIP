I would have never waited that long at a fast food place if I had been for warned as they usually do.  I asked to speak to a manger and the guy said nothing to her.

I like the Popeyes by Sunset and Decatur.
The staff are very pleasant and helpful! Always give me 3 mns of laugh when i go there :)
restaurant is clean, on tuesdays they are always busy busy since they offer the $1.69 for 2 pieces of chicken leg and thigh 
I can't resist their Biscuits! always freshly baked!

sometime eating simple is good.

All I can say is TUESDAY SPECIALS ARE LEGIT!! I don't come very often but when I do you better believe it's on Tuesday and for that yummy special! I didn't even know this location existed until I went in this area of town for some quotes on a car repair. When I pulled up this last Tuesday there was NO WAIT, and this is definitely unlikely at most locations especially on the Tuesday Special day! When I pulled up to the drive thru person who took my order was friendly and easy to understand! Repeated my order correctly and had me pull forward! THIS is the kind of service that they need to send some lesson's to the one up on Durango/215 because that one is ran by a bunch of ignorant young teenagers!

Even after showing her the receipt she still wanted to dispute the fact that they forgot half the order. She never said thank you. Never apologize for the inconvenience.  There are other Popeyes around Vegas. Do yourself a favor and don't go to this one. I will be calling corporate first thing in the morning.

I was in the drive thru and asked for just a box of shrimp. No combo, no sides, just shrimp. She was so lost like she never heard it before. Kept questioning me. Then asks what side would I like. Again, I said no sides. She said she would have a price for me at the window. I get to the window and she says ""Did you have the 10 piece combo?"" I said no... the one that just wanted Shrimp... Again, confused look. She grabs a manager and he gives me a price. He didn't hesitate. 

I am now sitting in the parking lot because the shrimp was going to take 2 minutes to cook. I've been sitting for 5 minutes now. They probably don't even remember what car I'm in... 

The manager felt bad about me waiting so long and he gave me two orders of shrimp. That was kind of him.
