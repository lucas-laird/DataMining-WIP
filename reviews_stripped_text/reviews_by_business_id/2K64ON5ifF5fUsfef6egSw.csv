1231060,2018-04-28,0,2K64ON5ifF5fUsfef6egSw,DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION if you expect to have the ordinary el pollo loco experience. The drive thru girl was rude and seemed bothered to do her job (take my order). They didn't have any breast or wings available to order but told me I'd have to pay extra for a skinless breast because they were filling a large catering order. They obviously don't appreciate their customers or they would treat them as such. I respectfully declined and left the drive thru however... i will NEVER revisit that location.,_eJvV9LYc124N42PCF6G0Q,0,0,1,uSWpRAXlaxhmCk6sMKuzbg

3717160,2018-01-06,1,2K64ON5ifF5fUsfef6egSw,The chicken was extremely dry all the Salsa's were not marked spicy or mild. The smoke coming in from the grill was extreme my eyes started burn in. the car asada steak was extremely flavorful the burritos were good and the other Specialties were good but do not recommend the chicken it was not fresh that we saw fresh chicken coming in but seem like they gave us hours old dried out chicken,P1r88O8pkOF7YpeNmoJI0w,1,0,1,YV-GGOzsNbYCEZgx5FnPSQ

They grill whole chickens and chop them up which is cool but do be careful for any small bones, I found 2 in my food. 
The tacos are surprisingly a little bigger than expected, I purchased 3 with a steak torta and was stuff after eating $2.50 
The torta was meh, tasted okay only real issue is that mine was super soggy, it wasn't a big deal for me but I couldn't finish it even if I wanted to. Took one bite and it fell apart giving up on life. 
I'll be back for my next hang over or if I feel like getting full for under 5 bucks.",f8soV-0RFMII2-t4jahTHw,0,0,4,9xCN0syb4AJDnD_K3nKv7w

We went inside to order and the female employee at the register did not acknowledge us.  Mind you, I am very light skinned and die my hair blonde, and I am Hispanic, and my family is all Caucasian.  We were discriminated against as she skipped over us to help others and must have assumed I don't understand Spanish, as she spoke about my family and I to a stranger.",eS6-8plwkXyDw576e8Oj7g,0,0,1,TMbB4KpalI9GcKn_jEP3xQ

5995081,2018-03-31,0,2K64ON5ifF5fUsfef6egSw,"I love this concept. From the ridiculously great smell of char-grilled chicken, to the fast and friendly service inside the restaurant, this spot has easily become a family favorite. I normally get a full chicken combo which is $13 and it includes rice and beans as sides. Although the sides are small, and I normally order one or two extras, they taste great. They are conveniently located in the same plaza as EOS fitness, so it's a great snack after the gym. Kudos to you Pollo Mobile. Your chicken and salsas are now a part of our weekly lives.",n3oInek8quP4GnbI_KN2mg,0,0,5,C6qyLWBOLATKf2vNxT1eWQ
