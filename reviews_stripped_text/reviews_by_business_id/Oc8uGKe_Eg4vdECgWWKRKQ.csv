Changed to 1star, they don't do the Saturday night anymore now it's boring and dull",SoK4m6wb20ztog7S086w6A,0,0,1,xxaiiv37wiue9noRffVfgw

The crowd n atmosphere was cool but the food, hookah n service was amazing so I'd definitely go again!",8cDxJWnBf1SYE5_WZYZ36g,1,1,4,ThDvUjoZ20eDg-KXooqZ8A

Great hip hop too. Not the nicest of spots, but everyone is chill.",TleCKECB5IWKsfbljTLOjw,0,0,4,1Kw8FHSecXENd5fleqDjsw

They are doing all three of those acts in one night, but it is just not something they have planned out very well. Pretty much they are new I guess, but they do not have their ducks in a row at all. Their bar had only three beers then they ran out of the one I was drinking after only having two. I just felt like they should not have been open yet and did DJ auditions during a closed time because the transition of the band, DJ, and karaoke in between was just hard to watch. Maybe it will turn itself around when it comes to the night club part, but from my expereince I will never return.",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,2,0,1,0g5i5lHPqMGicxiPIFmskg

There is no need to deal with the strip on a thursday evening for  nice dining and entertainment if you like live music.  The evening I went Hajee was entertaining, we had a wonderful time.  Thank you to the staff for being top of the line in customer service and for providing a wonderful dining environment. I cant wait to return!",GWYPUdvwoIq3Y1irSSMV1g,2,0,5,oG-TkA5PM2OGFsCCEpBbUw

4529846,2015-12-16,0,Oc8uGKe_Eg4vdECgWWKRKQ,"Experience:  Ate dinner on W Flamingo and was looking for a bar on YELP in the vicinity. The previous bar came up, and it said it was a Hookah lounge. So, I went to check it out. Although it's a new place, with a new name now, it was still a Hookah lounge. 

Facility:  This is bordering between a dive bar feel and a restaurant. It has some tables and chairs, some bar seating and some comfortable couches to sit and relax.  The decor is minimal, as I think they are just trying to get started. There was an Italian version of pool and chess going on. Music was playing, but not super loud as they had the debate stuff going on the TV behind the bar. 

Service: We were immediately greeted and was checked on often. The manager Israel was very friendly and came over and chatted us up too. He explained to my friend that he would teach him how to play this version of pool when he comes back. However he warned it was very addictive once you start. 

Food: we didn't order any food, as we just finished dinner, but another patron did and it smelled delicious. The manager told us they serve Ethioian food. We did get a watermelon hookah and some beers. The hookah was super cheap at only $10, and it lasted a long time. 

Overall:  I liked this little divey spot. It felt like a neighborhood bar. I will come back again as they were so nice, the Hookah was cheap, plus I want to try the food.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,1,2,4,NaQh3TBjyeLEsdiH0vYrpA

The owner, Maria, stopped by several times to visit with us. Everybody was very friendly and attentive. Oh, and did I mention the prices are great too?
We'll definitely be back!",M7j7eHoAHKfL3UPHMh-JHQ,5,0,5,urg3GlGSWYNIyJUoWxyfyA
5571037,2016-07-28,1,Oc8uGKe_Eg4vdECgWWKRKQ,The service was awful and the crowd was sketchy when I visited. I would not recommend this place as a late night spot maybe try some other time.,g6oRihnQNJbHA1BFGCjK9g,1,0,1,M2IAvt-_pUnLEuXDiJq-cw
