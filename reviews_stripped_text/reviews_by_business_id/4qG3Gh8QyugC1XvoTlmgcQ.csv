30634,2017-06-10,0,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Egg Works should be called - EGG WORST:  This place was absolutely Horrible.  The food was bland and their Specialty Potatoes were Salty as Hell.  

Service  was extremely slow.  We had 3 different waitresses tell us they would be serving us in the first 4 minutes we were seated.  And it took forever for the food to come out.  But amazingly our Bill came out before we took the first bite of our food.  I guess they didn't wanna give us a chance to complain about or ask for a refund for any of our  food that they knew was nasty before it hit the table.

Not 1 of the 4 of us at our table enjoyed any of our meals.  All left with more than half the food on our plates. I drank the water to fill me up.  That was the best part of the entire meal.  THE WATER.

I dont recommend this place to anyone who likes any flavor to their food at all.  And if you have any hint of High Blood Pressure,  dont eat their Salt Of Death Potatoes,  because you will have to take your High Blood Pressure Pills and call for an Ambulance before you leave there.

45545,2010-08-31,0,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Do you love eggs for breakfast? Well Egg Works is a great place to start up your day, you get the protein that you need and why not have it a way that you can enjoy. If your not an egg eating person no worries, they have french toast, waffles, pancakes, crepes, burgers and sandwiches. 
The location is great, good amount of parking, and the staff is very friendly. Sounds to me that this place would be a great place to eat and bring your family or friends. Not an early bird? It's okay they are open until 3PM, perfect for brunch.

Today, when we were ordering omlettes the waitress asked us if we would like them with 2 or 4 eggs. We said 2 eggs and therefore got a reasonable size meal. (They also came with potatoes or fruit and a muffin or toast.) The smaller option wasn't on the menu--it was a couple of bucks cheaper--and, possibly, the waitress only offered it to us because she sized us up as seniors. However, getting a reasonably sized omlette makes this a much more attractive place for me. I found the veggie omlette quite good and with two eggs right sized.

There was just as big a crowd in a much smaller restaurant. 

We pass our food around to sample soo heres my story...

Cottage Cheese is the BEST EVER period. Whatever was on top of it melted in my mouth. 
Food portions HUGE cost LOW (109.00 total with 8 big appetites) really impressive presentation for what is normally basic stuff.. hard to be creative with breakfast but they pull it off. 

Banana Bread French Toast... bit more of a dessert however it was SOOO GOOD!

On the second me the waitress apologized that it was not started. To be clear the waitress, Rea, was awesome. She placed my special order correctly, yet the kitchen just FAILED to do their job. I said to cancel the meal because we had no time to wait.

The manager Koko was great as well apologizing numerous times. The food showed up while she was there and it was wrong. The kitchen could not read the freaking slip!!!! The manager stated the main chef was just arriving at 10:00 am on a Sunday morning abd would handle it.

It is obvious from the running around in the kitchen that this crew needs retraining or continous supervision. Better yet how about the main chef get in at a reasonable time for such a busy Sunday am crowd.

409047,2009-05-29,0,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Breakfast eaters, look to other reviews because someone's Best Burgers of Las Vegas list pointed the way here, specifying the cheeseburger with Cincy chili, and that's the find. The burger itself is fine, indifferent, no worse than a thousand others of its ilk. But the chili. These folks get the Cincinnati approach. Tweaked with unsweetened chocolate and a bit of cinnamon (but replete with more standard fare like cumin, paprika, garlic and tomato sauce) it's a regional style that if you suspend any constitutionally held ideas of what chili ought to be, is really quite delightful. In Ohio (and across the river in Kentucky) you can have it 3-Way, 4-Way or 5-Way with spaghetti and the chili being the one and two base and finely grated Cheddar, onions and beans being three through five, depending on how you like it. Works the same here at Egg Works. This stuff is hard to come by out west, (a few years ago some guy tried to open a Skyline imitation buried in a shopfront hole in the wall on Van Nuys Blvd and folded in flash) and if you're curious to open your mind and palate to chili adventures, this is way easier than flying into CVG. That said, here's a caution for all cases: don't go anywhere expecting the absolutely uncontested best thing you've ever eaten. Take it for what it is, simple, enjoyable and somewhat different from what you're probably used to and your experience (and life) will be just a tiny bit more pleasant.

Looking at the menu made me hungry so my husband and I decided to check it out the next day.

It was quite busy when we got there around 9:30 am. Plenty of tables and flat screen tvs...We were immediately seated. I was fascinated with the newspaper-printed menu. Quite unusual. Definitely stood out.

I ordered the Waffle Works with bananas, eggs and bacon. My husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. When our orders arrived the first thing we noticed was that the portions were HUGE! To us, one plate was plenty for two.

I was a  bit disappointed with my order. Nothing really impressed me besides the portion. My waffles were overcooked. The eggs didn't have enough seasoning and tasted rubbery. The bacon was okay.

My husband said that his biscuits were a bit hard to fork through. But, he enjoyed the Works potatoes. Overall our first experience at Egg Works was (sorry to say): Eh.

The Standouts: Hearty portions, attentive service, unique menu.

They all have been thoroughly impressed and surprised that Vegas has more than gaming and the Strip to offer. The country fries are extremely tasty. The muffins are on par with Bouchon at the Venetian. The country gravy is just perfect as country gravy can get. 

Room for improvement would be: 1. Have the servers take the bill and payment for processing instead of leaving it to the patron to go all the way to the front of the entrance there there is usually a line of people trying to pay. For those of us who are busy, having a morning breakfast may be the only time we spend with the family until dinner. Therefore, it takes away from the quality family time at the table for one of us to  have to do what most servers at other restaurants already do. For those who are busy schedules and are trying to squeeze every minute we can with the family, it feels like if we were asked to go pick up our order from the kitchen when our number is called.

Took a date their for brunch last Sunday, she ordered the Veggie Benny while I had the Country Benny. The country benny was one of the better renditions of biscuits and gravy that I've ever had, with the gravy having a really nice, balanced flavor. It seems like a lot of breakfast gravies that are served with biscuits are just thick and gloppy; more meant to stick to your bones then deliver flavor. Their gravy really shines.

My date loved her veggie benny, especially the grilled tomato and fresh avocado. Service was friendly and customer oriented. I'm definitely a fan!",oNbkFvGTErw_ue_3_Mwcng,0,0,4,dpqZLMXKd2imQB1saw41IA

I don't have anything particularly unique to add to the other reviews here. The food is pretty consistent, though I commonly order between 4 or 5 dishes. The cooks overdo it with the cheese and Works seasoning sometimes, but I've come to expect that so I plan for it. ""Easy on the cheese"" or ""no seasoning on the potatoes"". They seem cool with that.

The service? It can be hit or miss, though more hit than miss. In fairness, I almost always sit at the counter, and if Rochelle is working, I'm taken care of. I've never had awful service, but the dining room can get really busy and the service suffers for it.

When I first started coming here, I couldn't stand the ""decor"". Sadly, it's grown on me. I'm *this* close to buying a tie-dyed EggWorks t-shirt. 

My favorite part? It's a local small business. I feel good supporting them, and that's what's most important... They make me feel good about myself. haha",HGINFgk9adbHHE6AfnhpwA,2,2,4,cpUG0y5w5VyN-ft1gZ4k0g

I went with a family friend the other day, and she encouraged me try something new.

It comes with potatoes on the bottom; chicken, ham, and cheese on top, with 2 eggs on the very top. I really wanted to break my egg yolk, but I was scared to what would happen to the taste of the food. I did get sourdough bread as my side which was not that sour. I prefer sourdough to be tangy.

I believe the cheese was thicker than the omelet. It was topped off with some canned or or jarred taco sauce and a dollop of sour cream. Only potatoes they had were frozen tater tots or potato ""shredded"" hash browns, which looked exactly like a McDonald's hash browns. I ordered rye toast which was some type of rye/pumpernickel swirl that tasted like neither. 

I had wanted pancakes instead of the toast and potatoes but this was not a option. It would have cost me an extra $6.25. No thanks. The only saving grace was the coffee tasted good but was $2.75 for a small mug, with the thermal pot left on the table; pour your own.

Total with tip was $16.06 with a 15% tip. To top it off, they have an improper ventilation/hood system in the kitchen for I walked around the rest of the day smelling like I worked there.

919501,2011-02-25,0,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"EGGS!!!  Excuse me for the exclamation, but I do love eggs with a passion.  For that reason alone, having the word ""Egg"" as part of an establishment's name is usually enough to lure me in.

I can't really comment on wait times for a table, as I usually come by my poor lonesome self and sit at the counter with a magazine or the paper, but there is usually no wait for the counter.  The staff is fast and attentive, almost immediately getting my drinks as I sit down.  They have a couple of televisions above the counter, one on sports and the other on news.  Each table and counter seat has a flip egg for when you need service.  The egg with the smiley face on it (it's actually a pretty creepy smiley face, the kind of face that says ""hey baby wanna leave with me tonight?"") means everything is well.  The egg with the frowny, constipated looking face means you need attention, and the one time I had to use this they were extremely quick to respond.  

Most of them items on the menu have eggs (dur), and the portions are very large.  Omelets are made with four eggs instead of three.  I usually order the Three Pigs, which is an omelet with cheese (usually order without it though to decrease the fattiness), sausage, ham and bacon, served with either fried potatoes and toast or banana nut muffin.  The Omelet itself is amazingly delicious and the potatoes tasty with this seasoning they drizzle over it.  I usually order toast, as I really don't care for the banana nut muffin.

Random quirk: The door to the bathroom is built to look like an outhouse!  Cute looking, but still retaining the functionality of modern plumbing!

The food is a bit pricey, but you generally get what you pay for.  If you live in the southwest part of the valley, you owe it to yourself to check this gem out.

PROS:
Eggs, eggs, and more eggs!  Big portions for you egg lovers
Fast and attentive and friendly wait staff.
Flip egg so you can call for service without looking awkward

CONS:
A bit pricey.

THE VERDICT:  A great place to go on a semi-regular basis.",dLkOEK2tAe8B-LNV6x_HoA,2,1,4,90XvBOgXwMDRkfGhkzqCvQ

Coffee is good and I like how the table gets their own carafe so we don't hafta wait around for topping off our cups (much appreciated in the morning). I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there and I try to get something new every time, this last time I had their special with potato skins filled with egg, cheese, bacon pieces and topped with sour cream!

The portions are massive and for some of them they allow half orders, a life saver for someone like me, with eyes always bigger than my stomach. The skillets are great mainly because they include the breakfast potatoes, that are unlike any other I've had. So great! I have a love affair with eggs benedict and it does not disappoint here. The banana nut muffins are a work of art for your mouth and usually warm from the oven. YUM. 

Maybe the best part about this joint is the cute little egg on the table. You turn it to a sad face if you need anything at all, and the servers practically break their necks running over to you when a sad egg is spotted.

Egg Works reminds me so much of those cozy midwest diners I miss so much being in Nevada.  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is personable, and pleasant on the eye, and the decor screams of the house you grew up in.

The potatoes which accompany most of the menu items are seasoned with Egg Work's special blend of dry spices.  Some may find them a bit on the salty side, but most leave salivating for more.  Everything can be customized to your preference, and even ordered in half-portions for those without monstrous appetites.

For a $12 plate I expected better value, especially since I declined the potatoes and toast that comes built into the price. I guess you pay for the convince of not scrambling eggs, with chicken.

I ordered the Three Pigs omelette, which was covered with a massive amount of jack cheese. So much that the grease from the cheese puddled into one corner of the omelette.  I had to scrape most of the cheese off. I could barely taste the meat flavors and was hoping for a crunchy bacon filling with the sausage and ham. The side potatoes were a bit overcooked and over seasoned and the English muffin was drenched in butter. Maybe my stomach wasn't in the mood for lots of oily fats, because I just wasn't impressed by the meal or flavors.

When I went in for take out, they sat me down and gave me a drink while I waited. Everyone was very friendly. The food came out in no time at all. I brought the food back to work and proceeded to devour my meal. 

The second experience I had was even better. After we sat down, our waitress greeted us promptly and took our drink order. She was also very friendly. After this, two other people stopped by to be sure that we had placed our drink order. Then we ordered our food and I requested the last portion be a to-go order. The waitress remembered and at the end of the meal when she gave us the check she put the order in and it was ready right before we were ready to go. 

Now for the specifics.... their eggs are really as fantastic as they say. My favorite so far is the Cincinnati Chili. If you have EVER had Cinci Chili before and loved it, this is a MUST try. I'm not sure how many places have this in Vegas...  I tried the Cinci burrito. The egg in it was extremely filling and the entire thing got eaten (in twi sittings).

Upon walking it, you wonder if you might suffer food poisoning later. The decor is pretty run down, the layout isn't very pretty. But oh my gosh, I had the best waitress ever. She was wonderful.

I ordered a mimosa, I was given an individual size bottle of champagne, along with a glass of orange juice, so I could make my own cocktail as strong as I wanted to, without anyone raising an eyeball at me beginning my day of drinking at such an early hour.

The service was outstanding. The food comes in pretty large portions, and wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was hot and good. I had french toast, eggs, hash browns, and bacon. And of course, my beautiful mimosa. My companion had chicken fried steak with potatoes and gravy.  Both dishes were yummy. The menu is varied, so even if you are a picky eater, you will find something that makes you happy. 

When you go, ask for Melinda. She's awesome. 

I'd add more descriptive words. But someone stole my thesaurus, which is bad. Very bad. Yes, bad.

Tasted like plastic, and I enjoyed the whipped cream more.
The reason I am giving such a poor rating is because both times we went they brought out the wrong food.

1568377,2012-11-01,5,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"As the dog jumps up on the bed, my brain screams out in agony. Opening my bleary eyes slams sunlight in from the window. I want to pull the pillow over my head to shield myself from the world, but the dog insists. As I roll over to try and fall to the floor gracefully, I realize that I'm still wearing my clothes from Saturday night. My shirt is drenched in sweat and twisted sideways and my right arm is asleep.

After shoving the dog out the door, my belly growls and my head pounds. I know there is but one hope to salvaging the day. After a full glass of water and a small handful of aspirin, I wander out to my car and find my way to Egg Works.

Parking is always a bit of a challenge on Sunday mornings, but fortunately not today. I park around the corner and stagger to the door. Just inside, I'm greeted by the glorious smell of breakfast goodness and a cheery hostess. She asks my name and surprises me with an estimated 5 minute wait. I take a seat on the bench by the window and try to look a bit less disheveled (unsuccessfully)

Moments later, the hostess calls my name and I groan a bit as I stand to follow her. My table is a two seater by the window, a little too bright for my sensitive eyes, but that's not their fault. The menu is a newspaper filled with lots of breakfast, and lunch options. I choose quickly from their list of Bennies (several variations on the classic Eggs Benedict) To help easy my pain, I also order coffee, which is left in the carafe on the table should I feel the need to chug four cups before my meal.

Now hang overs are just your body's way of slowing you down so it can catch up. The critical components are hydration, caffeination, and nutration (or nutrition if you like) Egg works can help with all of these. One special shout out to the potatoes, which should be illegal due to their addictive flavor.

One other note, y'all don't have to wait until your shakin off the effects of Jager bombs, or returning from Sunday services to come by - the service is fast enough that you can swing through here on your way to work, school, DMV, voting, airport, etc.

Oh, and if your wondering, I did survive that day, though it did make me pause for a few nights before I could look at anything served in a tiny glass or with a twist top.

Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things but my boyfriend and I both get disappointed each time we come here. The banana nut muffin is always dried out and does not taste fresh. Service is always hit or miss. And the food in comparison to other places like the cracked egg, it just doesn't measure up. I got stuffed French toast which was decent but again, nothing compared to the one at the cracked egg. The chicken fried steak skillet was more gravy than anything else... I think I enjoyed Denny's more than the egg works version. And lastly I tried the pork benny. It wasn't bad but you definitely have to have a certain ""taste"" to order that. It was very unique and different from anything I've had.. but I had a hard time finishing it with the mountain of the smokey bbq sauce slathered every where. I love their potatoes because they are seasoned well and full of flavor. I usually can't order country potatoes but they're so good here it's the one thing I can compliment.

Opt for the banana muffin instead of toast! I typically hate muffins but this muffin is out of this universe. It has a strong aroma and taste of banana and you can also physically see the nuts in them.

The Works Omelette: Loaded with all different kinds of meat and vegetables. Comes with their works potato which is a must have.

Country Fried Steak: A GIGANTIC slab of chicken fried steak and drizzled with soo much gravy. The gravy is creamy and savory and pairs perfectly with the fried steak.",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,3,1,5,7JiIB89H2Olkts9opacJPg

I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with Eggs and Potatoes, and a cup of Coffee. The service was fast, very fast, so fast indeed that I wondered at the quality of the food. Sure enough it looks good, but in the taste department they came up way short! The Eggs looked like they had been mass produced and were pulled from one of those buffet style servers. The gravy tasted like it was canned and way too salty with not much hint of meat in it. The biscuit was stale!  The Potatoes, way too SALTY!!!! Smothering reheated frozen potatoes in seasoned salt doesn't cut it in my book! Finally the Coffee was decidedly bitter to both our tastes.

The service is always pretty good.

The food portions are huge, so if you aren't hungry enough to eat 4-6 eggs, be prepared for a Togo box. Or get the half portion.

I like their bloody Mary's and mimosas. Bloody Mary mix is hablo Diablo and it's delicious. So good I don't even know if they actually put vodka in the drink. The mimosas are probably check champagne but they also used fresh squeezed oj. All about the mixers baby!

Their muffins are so good. Sometimes they come out before your food. Sometimes with your food. Sometimes after your food... just depends on how good or busy your server is. Get the house potatoes with extra seasoning and extra crispy and thank me later. 

My go to is usually an omelette. They're huge and delicious and packed with veggies and protein. 

Also, if your service sucks or you need something, flip your egg girl.

Right off the bat I knew it was going to be good by the long lines out the door (any foodie knows that's always a good sign). Walked in the hostess took down my name and despite the large volume of people in the restaurant she told me the wait was only 10-15 minutes. Not bad. It gave me time to check out the menu so I didn't mind. 

As soon as we sat down the kids got crayons & an activity sheet so they were occupied which made me happy (it's the little things that make such a difference). Our waitress was very helpful. She even took the time to explain the different types of eggs, recommended a few of her favorite dishes when we couldn't make up our minds. We ended up getting the bacon & onion skillet, corned beef hash skillet, and bacon waffles for the kids which they split (oops, I forgot to take a pic). The corned beef was great. I'd recommend that for sure. And I don't even like corned beef so that's saying something!! The kids waffles were just okay. Nothing special. Probably should've went with the French toast. The bacon & onion skillet was very tasty. I'll probably order that again. And those potatoes that come with just about every dish...WOW! They were so good. I was actually pleasantly surprised how much I liked them. 
All in all, the prices are fair, staff is very friendly and the food is great. Definitely coming back. I'm going to take my parents when they are in town next month. I have a feeling they will love this place too.

All of that, Egg Works.

I've been to Hash House (pretty much live there when I stay downtown) a lot, and while I do love that place, this local little breakfast nook has supplanted HH.

So, as I said, I hop on a bar stool, the manager Gia stops over to throw down on some coffee and ask if I have any questions. Nope. Menu is straight forward, well laid out and my prey is ripe for the picking: The Sundance Special Omelet. What's that you ask? Spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special Works artichoke cheese filling and then topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes. Right from the menu. But, am I satisfied with all that? Nope, throw in the chicken!!! Opted for the American fries and some sourdough as well.

The omelet... amazing. Perfectly done, ingredients all complimented each other and the chicken was seasoned perfectly with a bit of a spicy, southwest style seasoning. The kicker though, the special sauce, having some sort of lime flavor to it, which literally had me doing back flips off the stool. I swear I went into the hunch over the plate to ensure my neighbors didn't even look at it. Sourdough toast was toasted perfectly, not cold and was a perfect vessel to help wreck the omelet. 

American fries (while I normally opt for hashbrowns, figure, it's a house special, go with it) were incredible. Each spud was crisp on the outside, fluffy inside and hit up with that same southwest kind of seasoning the chicken had.

Dish was 20% eggs over med, 70% potatoes and 10% was a smattering of half raw mushrooms, spinach and chicken.  The chicken was just diced up lunchmeat chicken so yeah.

It is busy, but they get people in and out!  The menu, printed on newspaper print, is about 10 pages long, with lots of omelette and egg concoctions.  They also have pancakes, waffles, french toast, and lunch/dinner options. It is set up like a diner with very simple decor. 

 I've tried a few of the omelettes, the pancakes, and the french toast and everything I've tried has been tasty- with large portions! I usually need a to-go box and can make another meal out of my leftovers.

The potatoes are yummy! Seasoned very well (a little overly salty for my taste), diced, crisp but not dry or crunchy, and lots of them.  The meal starts with a warm banana nut muffin, which is delicious! 

Today, I tried the Stuffed French Toast, which is like a french toast sandwich- stuffed with cheesy eggs scrambled with your choice of meat. I am sure I didn't eat it correctly, because I ""unstuffed"" the french toast so I could eat it separately. The egg/cheese/meat (I got sausage) was great, but the French Toast was just okay. It was a bit dry and thin.  I think I might have fared better had I ordered things separately.  My dining companions loved their meals- a Bandito Scramble and the Strawberry Cream Cheese French Toast. Everything came out piping hot (which I LOVE).  Coffee was great (they will provide a carafe of it so you can fix your own refills), and they had a variety of creamers on the table as well as sugar, equal, and splenda. 

Service was great! Our server was friendly, funny, personable, and quick.  They have a system where you can just flip an egg (a little plastic egg on a stand that's on your table) from black to yellow if you need anything additional.  They had everything you could think of on the table, though- from hot sauce to jelly to butter to ketchup.

I'm not an American breakfast lover so my review can be viewed as skewed.

I ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet with a side of potatoes. I didn't like my dish because the egg was overcooked and somewhat rubbery. Also, the omelet was really thick and it had way too much bland cheese on top of it and also inside of it. And the red salsa on top was so ambigous; it didn't taste like tomato, it wasn't spicy, what was it? It was convenient that the potatoes were cubed into small bite sizes but it was definitely overseasoned; my husband didn't like the ratio of surface area:seasoning and I completely agree with him. I tried the banana nut muffin but it wasn't worth the calories so I only ate the spillage of the muffin top and ignored the rest. The coffee was swallowable but it had the typical diner taste. On a positive note, it helped me ""go"" after breakfast so it was somewhat useful. 

On the other hand, the service was good. The waitress was quick, attentive, and simply put ""did her job well.""

I was wrong on both levels.  This place is not only fantastic and magical but they're crazy fast to boot.  I've never been so happy to be wrong!  -:P

We walked in and most (if not all) of the tables were full.  It was quite bustling with the servers quickly moving about as well as hostesses seating people.  Placed our name on the list, was told it was about 10-15 minutes and sat outside.  I don't even think it was 5 minutes when we were called and sat.  Cool.

The menus are newspaper-style (cute!) and there was also a special laminated menu for, well, specials.  Derp.  Service was always efficient and super-polite by our awesome server (who wore a cute egg-themed shirt over her baby bump); we were never left without.  My fiancé ordered sides and she made it a combo so we'd save money; I opted for the spam and eggs and rice meal!  Om nom nom.  We also were super excited to be in a non-bar/casino-type place and still order mimosas.  Super delish.

Everything tasted great and came out so quickly, but did not feel rushed in the least.  If you eat eggs, please go here - they know eggs better than eggs know eggs.  Seriously.  I rarely ever get scrambled eggs because most restaurants make them weird - this place made them to fluffy, delectable perfection.  Spam slices were thick and the sticky rice was better than at most Asian restaurants!

And the banana nut muffin is indescribably delicious.  Just... put it in your mouth and enjoy.

Prices are reasonable for a breakfast place - if you don't order alcohol (oops) - and sure as heck beats IHOP/Denny's.

Hash House is nothing more than a tourist destination that out-of-towners feel they must check off their bucket lists due to the TV time and praise it's received from clueless celebrities visiting Vegas.  However, I bet the celebrities actually GET the service and CORRECT orders without the LONG wait times for their food to arrive.  So yes...go there if you are a celebrity...they may actually take care of you.

Locals know the real deal for breakfast is at Eggworks (or their other locations Eggworks II & The Egg and I) where you avoid the annoying families on vacation happy to overpay for their mediocre meals in exchange for bragging rights of being able to say, ""Hash House A Go Go...Of course I've been there!""  I've also noticed the weekend-wanna-be-bad-ass biker crowd likes to be ""seen"" at Hash House as well which makes it all that less cool if you ask me.

Eggworks makes my favorite Eggs Benedict of all...The Blacken Prime Rib Benny.  I've had Eggs Benedict with plain ham, exotic ham, salmon, chicken, crab...you name it.  None are as delicious as the one these guys put together with blackened prime rib!  I wish I could find a place in Seattle that would make me a Benny this good!

Be prepared to wait for a table in the mornings on the weekend but be assured that once you are seated, your food will come out fast and fantastic!  I really don't enjoy traditional breakfast foods, but this joint knows how to make EGGCITING breakfasts with a gourmet flare.",0E2Q9mJsMdQ0hRkKTVWuag,10,10,4,kp-Gl03CZUFA652Ry3_baQ

Some of the creamer spilled onto the table so we used the two napkins we were given to clean it and requested more napkins. It took about 20 minutes for us to get napkins and we got them only because we asked someone other than our waitress.

They were both happy with their meals and they really enjoyed the banana nut muffins that came with the omelettes. 

Heather checked back with us several times to make sure all was well. She even checked a few of the condiment caddies from the other tables to find my favorite hot sauce. Nice! She also caught a kitchen error on one of our orders before it reached the table.

Once you take your seat and they hand you their menu which is a newspaper, you know that it's not quite ordinary. Once you get a chance to look around it has a whimsical country  farm feel that centers around eggs. Stuffed chickens and roosters here and there. Egg Works themed coffee cups and even when you need help, there's a egg sign you flip that has a sad face meaning that you need your waitress to help you with something. We never actually had to use it since the service was really friendly and great. They treat you like you've been there before after ordering. A nice 'down home' feel. One of the quirkier things is that the door to the bathrooms is built to look like an outhouse.

I just ordered the Bacon and Eggs (what else?). It was a huge plate that additionally came with potatoes (the herby fried square kind). The eggs were fluffy and took up a large portion of the plate. The bacon was nice and crisp, but not overly so. Overall, it was so much that I couldn't finish it off. We also had the Vegetarian Greek Omelet.  I love feta cheese and never thought to mix it with eggs. It came out really tangy. Besides eggs, what is the next best thing? Four words: Homemade Banana Nut Muffins. I could just come here to eat these all by themselves. I'm not a muffin guy, but these dark pillowy muffins make my mouth water. 

A couple last things: The prices are really good for the amount and quality of food you get. No complaints here at all. The parking lot is fairly large, but I could see this place being really busy. When we went it was more toward afternoon, so the crowds dispersed by then.

I ordered a breakfast burrito with seasoned potatoes as the side.  When the burrito arrived it was drenched in sauce.  It was so bad that it broke apart constantly whenever I cut into it.  In my opinion, based on having many breakfast burritos at different places, a burrito should be held or at the very least shouldn't break apart so easily when cut into smaller pieces.  This was so bad that I was using my spoon and eating like a regular meal.

""Maybe you should've asked for the sauce on the side"" could be a rebuttal to this review.  Perhaps, but keep in mind this was my first time here.  I had no idea it would be drenched.  To add insult to injury, the water we were served had a bad after taste which leads me to believe that they don't serve filtered water like the majority of places do.

Egg Works is not located on the strip, so it did take a good 15 minutes to drive there from Caesar's Palace. 

We ordered the chicken fried steak, waffles, and chorizo skillet. I've never had such a delicious chicken fried steak before! The gravy was also very yummy. It came with Cajun potatoes that had a ton of seasoning, but I like that kind of thing. If you're not a fan of salt, ask them to go light on the cage.

The waffles and syrup was also great, and the skillet was hot and cheesy. I can't wait to go back!

Tip: I loved that they are so attentive, there's an egg with a smiley face and a frowning face. When you turn it to the sad side, any employee will stop and ask you what you need. It's so great when they all help each other.

2900693,2010-04-22,0,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Best breakfast ever. This place totally surpassed my expectations.  Just a quick google search and we were off the strip and a few (7) miles later we're at Eggworks.  This place is cute, it feels like you're in a log cabin.  The staff is super prompt. Whenever you needed your waitress, you flip this metal egg at your table from a smiley egg to a frowny egg and someone comes running!

But more importantly, the price, and the food. I think the costs were reasonable.  I believe I ordered an eggwhite veggie omelette (came with a side of fruit and banana nut muffin/hash or potatoes). I opted for the muffin (splendid!!!). I also ordered a side of the turkey sausage (pumped they even had turkey sausage), an apple danish, hot tea, cranberry juice....and i think that's it, lol.  I did take the pastries to go, so dont judge me too much.

all the food was great. the table came with a variety of hot sauce (which is a must for me). i recommend the good ole Cholula.  They had something they must make called Habla Diablo or something (see my pics) which was just plain heat. Didnt care for it.  

The fruit was delicious. Every piece was excellent, and I'm pretty picky about fruit.  Eggs were great, just enough cheese on top.  My only complaint was that the tomato in the omelette made it wetter than i'd prefer.  I really dont need to write anymore since i loved every bite. My peeps got the potatoes which were also great.  I think for my entire order it was $25, tops.  Totally worth it considering I ordered so much!

DEFINITELY GO HERE. Especially if you love breakfast.",XKvpZ7o7AqQ3AsDH45m88A,0,0,5,PUuy3nGRTfpyuYtYZ0PoQA

I got the Cincy Chili Dog and a salad with ranch.  I didn't like the Cincy dog at all, had a couple bites and gave up.  The ranch dressing for the salad wasn't made right so they offered me a new one with freshly made dressing but we had to go so they gave us four (enough for everyone I was with) of the banana nut breads, which were pretty good.

Even though the food wasn't that good, they got five stars for service and I would be willing to go back to try something else.

It's right around the corner from his house but he'd never even heard of it.  We got there around 7:30am and there was a decent crowd there...  about a half hour later there was a line of people waiting.  Guess we had good timing!

I went with the chili skillet...  it was delicious...  It came with their potatoes on the bottom, with some slightly spicy chili, a good bit of melted cheese, and two eggs on top.  Definitely would recommend this one.  Perfect portion size and with a nice sweet slice of pineapple on the side of the plate.  My buddy went with the Denver Omelet...  Iooked great... nice and big (4 egg), well-filled.  He ate the whole thing so it must have been good!  He wasn't a big fan of the potatoes...  Their potatoes are the small rectangular/squarish ones....  kinda heavily seasoned.  He and I both prefer a more traditional hash brown.  Not sure if they're available though.  My skillet had the potatoes.... which were really good with chili and cheese on them... but as a side dish I wouldn't have been crazy about them.

Service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  They have to be to keep the crowd moving!  Would definitely go back... and would probably get the same thing.  Just don't try going much after 7:30am on a Sunday though, unless waiting in lines is your thing.",FR2YSaIYBAxJ6VImV_dPKg,1,1,4,EQwdHa9mhxlTPUmvG2w-Jg

3024297,2010-07-03,1,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Ill admit it, Im easy....on breakfast places.  In my opinion, producing good solid breakfasts isnt exactly rocket science so most places that specialize in it usually get a pretty good ranking from me.  Even with my modest expectations, my visit to Egg Works was a pleasant surprise. The menu was varied, the portions generous and the service crisp.  

After just getting destroyed by some octogenarians at the 9am bingo session, I decided I need to assuage my wounds in some eggs and potatoes.  I had been meaning to try Egg Works so after inviting my mom to come with me (hey someones got to pay after the drubbing I took) we entered the surprisingly rustic and charming restaurant for a late breakfast,  My mom instantly loved the bucolic decorations and I loved the big plasma tv's playing the World Cup games.  Distractions aside, we both commented on the wonderfully large menu and were impressed to even see ethnic Hawaiian and Mexican options.   

I opted for the Sunrise Special which was essentially a greek omelet with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  Accompanying the omelet was breakfast potatoes and my choice of their famous banana nut muffins or toast.  Wanting to kick it a tad more old school (with the bingo I was certainly kicking it old, old, old school), I opted for the toast.  Mom had the eggs benedict which she found to be exactly what the doc ordered.  As for my omelet, it was perfectly fluffy with the right balance of filling.  The potatoes were seasoned and plentiful however, they looked to be frozen and not freshly made.  I love fresh homefries and this was a slight disappointment.  Otherwise, by the end of meal I was full and ready to wash the dauber stains off my hands.  

Overall, Egg Works is a fun, neighborhood breakfast joint.  Its larger than meets the eye which Im sure helps move crowds on the weekends.  Service was consistent and friendly and the prices were very reasonable, especially given how much food each dish seems to contain.  Both our meals were in the 9 dollar range and there were few things that really exceeded that in price.  They also are open for lunch and have a selection of salads, sandwiches and burgers.

Our server was super nice.  At first we got sat at a small 2 person table with no width but our server was sweet and generous pulling one of her other 2 tops to combine so we had room.  Some servers may have been hesistant or may not have even offered since they'd essentially be giving up more tip.  We defintely kept that in mind when paying.

As for food, we had the Prime Rib Steak Benedict which was a unique addition to their massive menu.  Rather than a standard bene, it was over their croissant which provided for an intense and rich experience.  I loved the pairing with the hollandaise sauce and spinach.  

We rounded the meal out with a waffles combo which was perfectly crisped but soft which was topped with whipped cream and bananas.  We had enough food to take home to have a second breakfast the next day.

3077175,2010-12-03,2,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Confession of a Banana Nut Muffin Lover: 

It all started with a desire to find the Mister a good American breakfast joint.  Having grown up in Vietnam, I do really prefer a French first meal (Vietnam was colonized by France and thus most of us are self-admitted Francophiles) and have subjected my loved ones to French breakfasts and brunches galore!  My fiance, however, had a good ol' American upbringing in the Midwest and ate morning carbohydrates like pancakes.

Enter Egg Works: adorable down-to-earth breakfast restaurant, all themed around ...Eggs!  Even the decor is completed with classic paintings with egg-ish slants, all the faces are replaced by eggs (including the Mona Lisa).  

There is a plethora of egg dishes for you to order, my favorite is the egg-crepe, a tasty blend of crepe batter and egg (perfect compromise of French American traditions).  But the various egg benedicts (called Bennys at Egg Works) are also done well, including one that comes with prime rib on top of a buttered croissant - truly a diet sabotage worth your time. 

But like most food love affairs: you come across that one delight so casually and unintentionally, this was how it began for me and the banana nut muffin.  I was not really even a muffin enthusiast, until then.  Adjectives like moist, soft, warm, perfectly sweet cannot deliver the experience of this muffin.

Upon receiving the sandwich, it was quite bland in taste & full of lettuce & tomato more so than I'd expected, lowering the quality of the sandwich. 

My husbands breakfast tasted much better than mine & he was more than satisfied, along with one of my daughters. Which are in the photos on my profile.

However, only after we left did my other daughter reveal to me that in her Fruit Parfait that she ordered, she bit into something ""crunchy"" and when she pulled it out of her mouth (I recall her quietly getting up from the table & excusing herself, not saying a word & the rest of the day not eating anything) she said she saw an eye & part of a little head.. She was so disgusted & threw up in the restroom & was so mortified she didn't know what to say or do..? She didn't reveal this to me until later after we'd left so there was nothing I could do except write a review about it. I have ""no"" idea what it was or what it could've been..

They were relatively busy for a Sunday morning but we were seated rather quickly and our server acknowledges us within 3 minutes.

I ordered a skillet breakfast, delish! their Works potatoes are cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic on them. My husband got an omelet with three kinds of meat in it. (yes, he got yelled at for such a poor choice). If you don't like cheese, don't order anything with cheese on it.  Both our dishes had tons of melted cheese piled on, which was awesome.  

Service was just ok. The server never asked how our meal was  after it was brought to the table and since the coffee was bitter i wanted water. Finally had to flag her down halfway through my food to get a glass of water.  I also waited and waited to get a box for my muffin.

I'm amazed at the lack of face time restaurant managers give. I saw a manager once during our 45 minutes to an hour there when a table's order was wrong outside of that, i never saw a manager again. 

I would return again but maybe not on a Sunday morning when they're so busy.  I'll give our server the benefit of the doubt and say that's why the service wasn't stellar.",Bri2w25qn-LSKRpM2wqyoQ,0,0,4,DnjmAwyGxmVjh8GVKRIhKA

Ever since we've moved to Vegas, we utilized the full power of the Yelp community to assist us with finding our new ""regular"" joints. So mucho props to you all.

Like I said, the wait time is sometimes longer during the peak breakfast/brunch hours - but damn the wait is worth it. There's limited space inside for those waiting, so I'd avoid the busy times during the extreme Summer/Winter days.

The serving sizes are huge, so there's a nice ""half"" option for those of you without the hyper-asian metabolisms. Prices are reasonable and the menu selections will keep you wanting to try something new every time.

The one bummer thing is the hours. This being Las Vegas - I would assume they stay open late. I suppose it makes sense them serving breakfast food and all (they stop seating at 3PM). Their Loco Moco at 2AM would be friggin' epic.

First, our server Maria G. was an angel. Once again, a lackluster meal is made better by a great employee - thank you Maria! 

Back to food. I really, highly suggest NOT getting a crepe. The egg part was weird and spongy. Pancake-y might be a better description. Also not a fan of their house made chorizo, which was bland with strange texture. I almost choked on globs of cheese inside the crepe omelette- seriously. Coffee was too watered down for me, and I really dislike non-dairy creamer, would much prefer a tiny cup of cream.
Back to the positive notes, I was a fan of their spiced potatoes (spice was similar to Lawry's) and their bottled Salsa Verde helped flavor up the bland Mexican Omelette. They do HALF orders, and it was A LOT of food, so glad our server mentioned that before ordering! We enjoyed a free banana muffin with our checkin (yay!!)

I believe we had no particular server because the busser ends up taking our drink order after seeing us not being taken care of yet. Few moments later, a server asks us for our drinks orders again. Then after that, a separate server asks to take our food order. 

Many minutes later, no banana muffin or food has been delivered. I ask for vanilla creamer which I never received. They must not have food runners either because my boyfriend can see his food sitting in the window. 

In a rush, 45 minutes later, I ask for take out boxes when I finally get my waffles. They gave me runny eggs when I specifically said over-medium. 

After my boyfriend boxes up our food he finds a hair on his plate. It couldn't have been his because his head is shaved. 

Towards the end, I asked if we could have lids to take out syrup home for my waffles. I never received them.

When I asked if we get banana muffins with our meal, the server said ""only if it comes with the order or if its your first time."" Now how would they know if it was our first time or not if no one asked us in the beginning? As a server myself for a different restaurant, I know asking the customer if it is their first time is one of the first things you ask when you greet them. 

I gave Eggworks 2 stars this time and not 1 because I still do enjoy their food. They're always busy so they should be used to the fast paced environment.

Have been coming here for breakfast since I moved here several years ago, and family and friends I know have come for longer. The breakfast  food is always tasty, the muffins are sooo good. The ingredients are not extravagant, but consistently very good, very well flavored. Portions are large and we almost always have to take some to go.  The staff is always friendly, upbeat and engaging, the decorations are nice. If there are ever any concerns with an order, as can happen in a place occasionally, they are prompt to address. Sometimes there is a wait on weekends, but they keep it clean and get you in pretty quickly. Whether there is a crowd or fewer patrons, the service, quality of food, and experience is consistently great.  I also like other restuarants that have a bit more variety in terms of vegetables added and creative twists on breakfast items, so they are not my preferred 5 star, however solid 4 star for me and plus my husband loves them and I love going there with him.",RFwh_YX-UtHsEf7yZkcuKQ,0,0,4,eZ3lI526jwoCFLO5JaEZ6Q

This place deserves 5 stars for originality.  The menu is like an 8-page newspaper full of creative dishes.  We got there on a Saturday noon and waited about 15 minutes or so.  I decided to check out the menu while I waited, and by the time I sat on the table, I was still torn between the stuffed french toast, crepes or an ""egg-ceptional omelette""....so decided to ask the waitress, who recommended the seasonal PUMPKIN BANANA PANCAKES...which were not a bad choice.  My bf's huge omelette was a little overcooked for me, but was stuffed with looots of different ingredients and home fries (with a little too much seasoning!).  Since it was my first time, they brought us complimentary BANANA NUT MUFFINS that were warm, soft and delicious!

All in all, food is good (not amaaazing, just good), service was great, decor is really cute, farm like, and the dishes are super creative.  Portions are huge and prices more than reasonable.  Would definitely go back!",4fM5kiW-haOTm3SCPYgs2w,2,1,4,0CoOxvWAWD9bWWnvQQ9uvA

I looked around and waited....and waited...and waited...someone finally stopped and I asked if I could speak to a manager and she said she would send coco? right over.

Egg works offers a large slightly overwhelming newspaper style menu.  The service was super friendly, fast, and smiley.  We had three breakfasts and three coffees for $36.  Price is right.

Momma was thrilled with her eggs benny with spinach.  She opted for fruit on the side and was all but licking the perfectly cooked egg yolks out of the bottom of her dish.  She was also happy the fruit wasn't the usual melon cop out but fresh pineapple and orange slices.

I could not resist the temptation of the chicken enchilada omelette.  Theis creative breakfast omelette weighed approximately 4 lbs. and was served with at least 3 servings of crispy seasoned potatoes.  The portion was huge! I brought half home.  The omelette had chicken, green chiles, enchilada sauce, and cheese, and crispy tortillas baked on top for a crunchy surprise.  Very good.  Nothing needed salt or pepper.   Hot, yummy, and nicely seasoned.  

The leave a carafe of coffee on the table for your convenience and provide french vanilla coffee creamer. BONUS POINTS!

I live and die by the South of the Border Skillet.  It's off menu, so I am sharing this little nugget with you because I am a regular here and know the secret menu.  You can thank me later.  

From the minute you walk in the door here, it's like stepping into a breakfast joint in Gatlinburg, Tennessee (aka the #1 vacation spot for rednecks east of the Mississippi).  I think this is the look they are going for considering all the hokey decor.  I love it!  The hostesses, servers and bussers work together to make sure you get excellent service.  Each table has a little sign on it that you can use to alert your server if you need something, but you won't need to use it because the service is just that good.

The only downside is I could sit for an hour just sipping coffee, but this place is too busy to do that.  When I see the line out the door, I feel too guilty.  So get in as many cups of coffee as you can before turning over your table.  I like to take half my breakfast to go for the next day, but if that isn't your thing, be sure to order the half portion offered for most menu items.

Makeup not done, hair not done, and literlly 4 hours of sleep, we're there with our big appetites.

We get there and I ask for coffee, and immediately its served. Server was very nice and even took time to explain some of their specialties, their famous potatoes, and even their banana nut muffin. I was supposed to get a choice between a muffin or toast, but because I was a first timer, she gave me both. 

Muffin - Was like a taste of sweet heaven! Talk about an orgasmic feeling, and get your head out of the gutters! Made fresh, served warm where the butter melted on direct impact. I was in another world and forgot where I was at. This was the best banana nut muffin I've ever had.

I ordered the country skillet which is basically their potatoes topped with country fried steak, 2 eggs and their country gravey- Potatoes were to die for. Not your usual potatoes, but these were crispy and served with season salt. I was in love with the potatoes itself! Only downfall was that the potatoes are better off on the side vs topped with all that other good stuff. 

Friend ordered corn beaf and hash - defintely excellent, but I still favored my country skillet. 

Service was excellent. Coffee was never empty, and defintely service with a smile. If you haven't been here yet, this is definitely worth the drive from the strip, even more so, if you're up early enough, this is definintely the place to go.",gJ7FiUk5If8Ru8ykwH5RHQ,6,4,5,38qpVbFgDAyrHpoNQajG7w

We were told that we would have to wait about 15 minutes, which actually came to only 10 minutes, which was great. Our waitress was friendly, but would forget a few things that we needed, such as utensils and coffee.

I had asked if the sausage I ordered was indeed turkey and she took it back and had it remade without telling me that that was going to happen. 

So I had to wait for my breakfast to come back and then when I placed an additional order of turkey sausage for my husband, we waited 20 minutes for that to appear.

In all honesty this breakfast just took way to long to be served and the miscommunication was the problem.

I've never had any sort of issue with the other Egg Works I've been to so I guess I'll be returning to those other locations instead of this one.

In need of a run to Lee's (which is in the same shopping center) on a Tuesday seemed like the perfect time.  Especially since there was no line wrapping around the building.  

We were seated immediately.  5*'s. 

Drink orders taken within 5 minutes of sitting down.  5*'s.

Waitress in the uniform pony tail popped over to take our order off the extensive menu within 1 minute of our drink order being taken.  Upon being told we weren't ready, she left and returned 15 minutes later.  2*'s. 

HUGE portions.  of Potatoes.  

We had at our table.  

Chicken enchilada omlet:  very tasty.  could have used a touch of spice.  but over all I'd get it again. 

Western omlet:  filled with goodness and the person ordering it took the other 1/2 he couldn't consume at the table..home. and he never ever takes home left overs.  

Bandito scramble:  nice combo but kind of bland.  not enough chorizo to make it --wait for it -- EGGciting enough.  

Coffee was delicious.  Of course any coffee for me is delicious if they are not serving Star bucks or Seattle's best.  

Banana muffin.. worth the entire meal.  Moist, delicious and the alternative to extremely dry toast. 

Now we come to the waitress again.  Ok it was a Tuesday and there was never a line waiting and she had several open tables.  I think she might have either been new OR having a bad day but we had to turn our little eggy guy (see pics) to get our check & a to-go box.  

Overall I'd say its a great find during the week.  Certainly not worth the wait for the massive lines we've seen on the weekend.

The banana nut muffin has a BIG top on it...the BEST part!!  Moist & fluffy towards the middle and nice crispy around the edges.  it's really more of a bran muffin than banana nut.  I'd call it a banana-nut infused bran muffin....except that'd be too pretentious for this casual joint.   I usually eat the top & leave the muffin.

We've been several times and there is almost always a wait...deal with it.  The food's worth the wait.  They hustle people through tho so we've never waited as long as they've estimated.  And if you're a party of 2, the bar at the back is great... the service is best there and it's not quite as noisy/crowded as the dining room where people are on all sides of you and servers are bustling around non-stop.

The bloody mary is ok, a little weak IMO, but for $6 go for it.    And I think the portions are HUGE.  Bring an appetite.  

If they have the breakfast nachos on special, it sounds odd, but sister ordered them & said they were very yummy.   The stuffed french toast looks out of this world (& huge!), but I always order the Hawaiian...maybe one day.",FISzlNZgrFylvgX3Nl_a5w,2,0,5,DEX21Qo_DbrtOfKM5Jk0eg

The barn-like decor, with some farm animals, and egg people on the walls are real cute. The menu is presented different, it's printed on a newspaper type layout and there are little egg people all over that too. Cute.

My regular meal of choice: the waffles and sausage patties with an iced tea (fresh brewed). My husband usually gets an omelet (egg whites) and potatoes. I love the waffles, you get 1 large waffle, light and sweet. The Patties are good too. And there's always enough potatoes on my husband's plate, that I'm able to have some too. I like them because they've some kind of Cajun seasoning on them. 

If you need anything from the server, there's an egg shaped sign on the table and if you need assistance, you flip the black egg over so that the yellow egg is showing and a majority of the time, a server instantly shows up to assist you, whether they're your server or not. It's interesting, and I hope I don't jinx myself by saying this, but we've been going there for about 3 years or so, maybe once every couple months, and there has not been a time when the service was bad for us.

I always research what I want to eat before actually going to a restaurant.  I was also pleased with their website, offering an online menu.  It just makes things super fast for me.  Within the last few weeks of being here, I've tried their canadian bacon eggs benedict, prime rib eggs benedict, and the crepe omelete.  All of the above were delicious and saucy, the potatoes were to a crisp and they were spiced up perfectly.  

My orders came in a timely fashion and I always pay the right amount.  A well done deal for such a tasty place. If you're in the neighborhood check them out, because dammmnnn they are tasty!",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,4,3,4,XJm78oiwmHO56HJOrmiAHA

Without boring you with the details, the pass through window was an symphony between the cooks and the servers.  Good communication and everyone knows what needs to be done (busy work) to keep things running smooth.  There is also a good quality control.  Several times, a manager asked to have items replated because the presentation wasn't to her standard.  In some cases, food was discarded and re-done.

The quest to find a pan fried CFS like Eat At Joe's in Redondo Beach, CA. is hard to find.  It was a good steak.  Seasoned well.  The home fries are also deep fried.  Crispy.

They have these 2 egg symbols next to your table one with a happy face and the other with a sad face and you flip it to the sad face if you need something and since the staff work as a team the response time is very short which is good.

I ordered the country fried steak and I gotta say it's one of the best I have had. The gravy was very flavorful and the steak was cook very well, nice and crunch with a flavorful crust. It also comes with banana nut bread which is their specialty and taste great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the potatoes which were seasoned a little bit too much so it was a bit salty. But not a deal breaker.

My girlfriend got the chorizo skillet which was a mix of chorizo, potatoes, eggs and jalapeños and cheese and salsa. It was awesome every bite was flavorful but it was a large bite if you try to get everything on the fork! 

My parents got the waffles which were soooo fluffy and cooked perfectly. Add some butter and syrup and you got a simply but delicious waffle.

Egg Works definitely has a good feel to it, which I think is absolutely critical for a breakfast place. The morning has to feel good, especially for the unfortunate noon-waking types. 

The staff is friendly, though not spectacular (which they have the potential of being), but they do work efficiently and cleanly. The food is nothing too special; a little too rich, even for American food, and there's the unnecessarily huge servings of thick, saucy food even if you're expected to have morning-dessert afterwards. You could easily split an entree with someone else, and be happier in the end for it for not feeling so mayo-greased. I did appreciate how fresh the vegetables were, and the solid arrangement of the layers in my eggs benedict (which is important), but then the excess food and servings is just such a huge turn-off, especially when the flavors are so monotone that it all eventually becomes one huge unnecessary mouthful. 

What I'd like to see is some more use of those excellent veggies and construction to create a bit more interest to the breakfast dishes. I'm not saying that they should be doing culinary acrobatics here, breakfast place and all, but they could stand to reduce sizes so that guests are not one-flavor-drowned, or to add a bit more interest to these huge dishes to warrant them being so size expansive.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,0,0,3,qm2ZNFr_9BrHDbQsAzmepw

My husband had an omelet that was a self creation and my brother in law had the boring standard egg, bacon and dry potatoes!.. oops did I say dry.  Yup that was the only thing I will not order for myself.   Everything was delicious the table service was on point and this is such a cute place with a great concept.  Now why the 4 estrella's! well.  They are a little pushy with bringing the check before you finish and cashier wasn't very pleasant is was like I was invisible and she didn't smile.  Sorry peeps I love a good smile!

4744449,2010-06-06,3,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"You'll rarely find me reviewing breakfast places, as my body has a tendency to not turn on my appetite until I've already been awake for two or three hours.  So coming from me, a four star review of a breakfast place is a great thing.  Egg Works helped me get my breakfast fix that I've been craving for the past week.  I have dined here before, but I saw Jen S. post his review of this place this past Friday, and that helped me decide where to get breakfast!

So on those rare occasions when I do breakfast, I love me some eggs benedict.  So I decided to love me some eggs benedict through Egg Works' ""Works Veggie Benny,"" which their menu describes as, ""English muffin grilled brown, topped with grilled tomatoes, fresh spinach, sliced avocado,two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, sauce then we serve it with a side of Works potatoes.""  

First things first: the Works potatoes are amazing.  I will eat potatoes in any form, whether it be baked or mashed or anything in between, and the Works potatoes are at the top of my list.  They are crispy on the outside but maintain that starchy softness inside, and are served with a salt/spice seasoning that make these taters into little breakfast fries.

The Works Veggie Benny itself was good.  The avocado and tomato sounded delicious and refreshing, but was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce.  I think one of the poached eggs ""popped"" prematurely and got yolk mixed in with the hollandaise, leading to a soupy consistency that smothered my veggies.  Not a bad thing, but I wasn't used to my hollandaise being so runny.  Outside of that, the food was delicious, though I think next time I'll be going with a Benny that has some bacon or sausage to go with that sauce.  The meal also came with a slice of watermelon and honey dew; fruit is always a pleasant way to round out your breakfast.

My friend got the Spinach Benny, and we both got coffee, which led to a bill of $25 for the both of us.  Each entree was just under $10, with the coffee being about $2.50 or so.  I am definitely coming back here again, I just can't guarantee when!  Once I try some of their skillets, scrambles, omelets (they have quite the menu!) I have no doubt that my four stars will be bumped to five.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,3,3,4,nZavWUphp9BTSt2VLY_fKA

There was a large heaping amount of eggs and potatoes. It's big enough to share but I didn't. I ate it all. I love gravy. It was just the right consistency, not lumpy or runny.

4827763,2017-01-15,1,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"I heard a lot of talk about Egg Works from some friends so we decided we would hit the place up before flying out. To be honest here, after spending all day yesterday around the strip our group may have been a little hungover upon waking up, so what's better than a greasy breakfast? 

I was told the muffins are amazing so with my breakfast I had to get one, it was pretty good, very soft and moist. I ordered the chicken fried steak skillet which had their house potatoes, cut up chicken fried steak, gravy, and 2 eggs on top. And to drink I chose to get a mimosa and water. The mimosa was cute, they served it by providing a Mason jar glass with a mini champagne bottle and a cup of OJ on the side so you're to mix it yourself. Fine by me, it just means I could control how much of each to make mimosa just right for me. We came as a party of 4, coffee was ordered and we were without coffee cups for about 10 minutes or so. When our food was brought to the table all other 3 dishes were brought expect mine, it was about another 5 minutes. It really seemed like they were confused about the orders coming out and had to get it sorted. When I did get my food, it looked great and didn't taste too bad. The only thing on the food quality that I wasn't a fan of was how salty it was, the potatoes had a seasoning on them that was good but it was a little too much and really made the whole dish too salty since it was all basically mixed together in the skillet. The gravy was pretty tasty though, and the chicken fried steak was about average. My reason for a 3 star review was the delay in the food all coming together along with the coffee cups, there was a chip in my glass that was overlooked, and the table hadn't been bused all the way so the previous guests tip money was still on the table, and of course the salty food. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I wouldn't really go out of my way to do so.",d9kFnjd5OKAdxBG0LdA-6w,6,2,3,CTMY1NocU1h8DvaXoEEspQ
4830741,2011-08-02,0,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Wow, this place just does breakfast right. If someone was looking for a template on how to make a great breakfast diner, they should look no further than egg works.

First the service... they have a egg smiley face at your table that you can turn into a frowny face if you need immediate service. If you make it a frowny face, your server will come almost immediately. I've really never needed to use this however because our server almost always has checked in on us at good times.

Now the food. Holy crap is this stuff good. If you're dieting, don't go here because it's too tempting. I would reccommend something, but really everything is good. Make sure to get a side of potatoes because they're fantastic and seasoned very well.

When we arrived they were full.  All of the indoor seating in the waiting area was full, and we were told there would be a waiting time of about ten minutes.  Because it was cold outside, we stood near the registers trying not to block the walk through too much.  After about five minutes, we were able to get some seating in the waiting area.   When we got seated we were greeted and offered beverages almost immediately.  The service and food was excellent (I've always had really good service at any of the locations I've visited).  I tried something different today; the brioche breakfast sandwich -without the cheese- and hash brown patties in lieu of the signature potatoes.  It was very good.  Everything about the experience was very good with the exception of the lack of adequate space at the entrance of the restaurant.  Not enough seating for those waiting and if there is a line of people waiting to check out at the the register it quickly blocks a main walk through.  If you happen to have been seated near the entrance, you will have people standing right behind you waiting in line to pay (when it's backed up).  If you are at the table next to the hostess, you'll have people directly across from your table in the ""waiting area"" seating.  Luckily, we were not placed at a table near the entrance.

He chose the Beef Eater ""Grilled Parmesan sourdough, Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and grilled roast beef and a side of horseradish sauce.""  I'm not sure if they are still using horseradish sauce, but my friend thought it was hollandaise sauce!  I tried a bit and found it 'interesting.'  The sandwich was decent as he finished it all, and the Works potatoes was a generous portion because he had a lot leftover.

The Husband was craving the Country Fried Steak ""A hand battered chicken fried steak, topped with Grandma's country gravy and served with two eggs, Works potatoes and a choice of toast or banana nut muffin.""  He has his two eggs over easy with sourdough bread.  The country gravy was definitely creamy, but needed a bit more zip.

I wanted a side of corn beef hash, and the waitress said they could definitely do that.  She asked if I wanted the homemade version or the canned, which I had never been asked before.  Apparently they just started doing the homemade version, but most people prefer the canned one instead.  Feeling the need to experiment, I went with the homemade version, knowing ahead that it was going to be more stringy-like.  And she also asked if I wanted it more well-done, which I took as ""crispier.""  They also serve it as a small or large side order.  The homemade version is definitely a bit more stringier and something I've had quite often since most Filipinos eat their corned beef like that.  However, it definitely needed a bit more flavor - some heat and pepper took care of that!

Overall, our breakfast experience this time was okay.  Our friend wasn't as impressed, and just found it to be average.  We weren't wowed the same way as the first time.

Service was so much slower but the food was consistent with the other Egg works so that part was good. Didn't appreciate having to flag down someone though every time we needed something. 

Being that it's a new year hubby decided to try something new as opposed to sticking with faves, lol not the wisest idea as the Cincy Chili Loco Moco he opted on was probably the worst tasting item in the menu.

5090458,2015-12-01,0,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"When I was an omnivore, I frequented here because there weren't many breakfast places off the strip (in the Flamingo/215 area) and it was good enough, plus they serve alcohol.

I had family in town this weekend for Thanksgiving, and brought a party of 10 to Eggworks at 9am on Sunday morning.  I called in ahead of time and they were gracious enough to take a reservation, even though that's outside the norm for them.

Two of us in the party are Vegan (my husband and I).  We knew the menu, and knew we would need to modify dishes to meet our dietary needs, but I was disappointed w/ the lack of accommodation the restaurant provided.  We each ordered the Veggie Skillet, no cheese, no eggs and asked if we could get avocado instead.  We were told we would need to pay extra for the avocado.  I reminded the waitress that per their menu, a side of avocado costs more than a side of eggs and cheese (arguably the most expensive parts of the dish) and she advised there was nothing she could do.

Had it just been the two of us, we probably would have walked out instead of paying $15.00 each for a dish of veggies and potatoes, but we had 8 other people with us so we bit our tongues, and paid for the extra avocado.  The meal was tasty, but that's besides the point.  In addition, they offer no non-dairy milk for their coffee, so we had to pass on that as well (non-dairy creamer still has milk products in it).  Come on, most breakfast and coffee houses around town at least have an almond or soy milk option.

The vegan community in Vegas is only getting stronger, if a restaurant isn't going to have vegan options on the menu, they should be accommodating of the vegans that do still frequent the restaurant.

I e-mailed the restaurant that morning, it is now two days later and I haven't heard a peep, hence why I decided to write this review.  The next time I have a large party like this, I will take them to many of the other restaurants in town, where we can all be accommodated.",rg9BnWtWbEusg8GBnS8JsQ,0,0,3,DeEFy06BLeSB8s6HHVpkGQ

Family-friendly casual style dining that post-Jager bomb college kids can also appreciate. Really enjoyed watching both demographics fill up the joint on a Monday morning before Christmas. Perhaps there were some vacationers in the mix, but for the most part, it seemed like a locals joint.

Probably the best thing about the menu is the wide variety of dishes, anything from healthy scrambles to cream cheese stuffed French toast. Which do you think I chose?

5199597,2010-03-15,4,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"Celebrity sightings alert! Given the star power that regularly graces the Strip, my Egg Works sighting might not be too stirring, but when I saw members of the Wranglers hockey team, it thrilled me. They practice at the nearby ice facility, so I imagine they do coffee and eggs at the Works fairly often.

I do too, but I must admit that the 2 for 1 entrée coupons in my edition of The View are a big big incentive, as is the banana nut muffin. That muffin is habit forming! Just so you know, the muffin is an option in addition to the usual toast you get offered at breakfast restaurants.  Muffin or toast: you would be crazy not to choose this muffin.

Egg Works is technically a chain; the sister restaurant close to us is The Egg & I, but I think Egg Works is a smidgen nicer. It is a newer location. There is also Egg Works II on Sunset. Completely unrelated to the food, but they have a great website, so if you have any questions, you should visit it.

As you may have guessed, eggs are their specialty, so there are plenty of omelets and scrambles and sunny-side ups. The menu is pretty extensive, and they do have non-egg items such as buckwheat pancakes! They also have lunch, including hamburgers. They offer egg whites and egg substitute in addition to your regular chicken eggs. Often, the tastiest thing is their special of the day. The best thing I have eaten there was a chicken and pesto scramble special! Generally, I will get a scramble with vegetables, which are always fresh, not canned. I will say that the eggs can taste pretty plain, but I think they want to leave it to you to add salt, pepper and hot sauce to satisfy your own personal taste level. 

The serving sizes are very generous and include a mighty helping of their breakfast potatoes. The potatoes are diced and are not greasy at all. The secret to their tastiness is the magic dust--a little spicy, a little salty, a lot of yummy. 

The service is always attentive, and the servers generally look like they are having fun. They work as a team, which always makes service snappier. If you need something, there is a little egg on your table that you can flip. Now that's using your egg. Bwahahaha!

Overall, I think that Egg Works is a solid option for breakfast. There is something for everyone, the ingredients are fresh and the execution is respeggtable. (I can't resist a good egg pun.)",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,5,4,D5hTmQKX0ZiEGg-ZQQ4fsQ

Egg Works is definitely the place to go for great breakfast. There are plenty of egg dishes from your traditional eggs, bacon and potatoes to a host of different omelete styles. 

I tried the Eggs Benny which is essentially a more hearty, country version of the bougie eggs benedict. You can have your eggs served any style, I chose over medium. Service is very quick and we didn't have to wait long for our meal to arrive. The Eggs Benny comes nicely plated with country potatoes and a seperate dish for the biscuits topped with sausage patties and eggs on top. The gravy basically covers the whole dish of biscuits. I should have asked for the gravy on the side, but I was hungry so it didn't matter. The biscuits are flaky and flavorful, the sausage patties are very tasty, and of course the eggs are awesome. The gravy is definitely authentic and tastes the part! The country potatoes are tasty but if not careful, the seasoning could be a little overpowering.

**Summary**
       - Best of Both Worlds - You get the quality control and pricing of chain restaurants with the taste and feel of a family owned joint. This is the fourth in a string of egg works in town and the first that is actually close to me.
       - Seasoned Center Cut New York Steak - One of the two items I always get when I'm here. They use their own special seasoning that makes the steak simply delicious.
       - Works Potatoes - Seasoned home fried potatoes. Their seasoning is so good they even sell it. Their fries are done the same way.
       - Banana Nut Muffin - Comes with almost every dish. It's sinful how moist and addicting this muffin is. If it's your first time and your entree doesn't come with it, I believe they'll give you one anyway. They know it's like crack and it'll keep you coming back.
       - Works Burger - The other item I always get. Sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon, and cheese. Need I say more. It tastes just as good as it sounds.
       - Bennies - If you like eggs benedict, they have 5 different kinds. One even is topped with blackend prime rib.

       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice breakfast or lunch place.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,2,1,5,n0vr1cIBD1bfHQB8ly-eSQ

My two favorite dishes are the stuffed french toast (it's basically a french toast sandwich with eggs, cheese, and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.) I usually get this with bacon and it is by far amazing. I love sweet and savory dishes equally so this dish is the perfect balance for me.

Second favorite dish is the banana bread french toast (can you tell I love french toast?? lol). But this is by far THE BEST french toast I have EVER TASTED. It's so soft, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you're craving something on the sweeter side, this is definitely the dish for you. It will NOT disappoint. 

Portions sizes are generous, I usually always have leftovers (which make a great snack for later). The service has always been quick, efficient and friendly, though, I I've seen this place get pretty busy (especially on weekend mornings) so expect to wait a little if you choose to go then.  Their menu is pretty impressive (lots to choose from so I need to start venturing out of my ""comfort zone"" and try other things). 

So for all you breakfast lovers out there -- this place is without a doubt a must-try... I can pretty much guarantee there's something for everybody!",VabJnFi9mkPPi9EC9rjINw,0,0,5,RLc4nuS7SvWDxZYkGbZqTQ

I really LOVE breakfast and honestly, this place simply was a drag. The only thing that I could agree to love was the gravy. The biscuits were ""doughy"" but the gravy masked it. It was simply that good. The other items, eggs, bacon were just meh. The potatoes were the biggest disappointment... just crunchy squares.

I do appreciate that they serve alcohol, but I prefer caffeine with my breakfast.  I wanted to order a cappuccino, but the waitress told me that it was the really sweet kind that doesn't taste like a cappuccino (aka the sugary liquid that comes out of the cappuccino machines in gas stations). Blech!  I do appreciate the heads up though.
My boyfriend and I split a prime rib country potato etc. skillet that they had on special.  The meat in it didn't even remotely resemble prime rib, and all I could taste was the  Worcestershire sauce that they doused the whole skillet with.  :(
I would give this place another shot, but with so many awesome breakfast places in the neighborhood...it might be a while before I do.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,1,0,2,7jyD-yFSqp4Csco96TTpTA

If you have the misfortune of dealing with Linda, I feel for you. She has the worst demeanor of anyone I've seen in the service industry in a long time.

The food is great. No complaints. We've tried almost every dish on the menu between Egg Works and Egg & I, so food wise it's worth it. The food came out quickly in spite of how busy the restaurant is on Sunday mornings. Maybe an off morning today, but when the experience is soured before you even sit down, it sets the tone.

I always get the same thing, the Eggs Benedict, and it is pretty much perfect every time. I say pretty much, because I had to learn to ask for them to poach the eggs medium, otherwise you get a runny white, which is gross. Runny yellow, yes, running white, ewww. Potatoes are delicious!

Hubby always gets the three pigs skillet, which I think they recently renamed but he loves it and there is never anything left on the plate. 

Price wise, it is very reasonable for Vegas. We always get out of there for less that $30, (20% tip included) which I feel is a good value for that kind of breakfast.

Arrived Sunday morning around 10:30, put our name in for a table and about 5 minutes later we were seated. This place was packed though, and I quickly learned why!!

I kept it simple and ordered the classic breakfast, mainly because my friend was telling me how good the potatoes and the muffins are, so I wanted to try them. So glad I did because the seasoning on the potatoes is AMAZING and that warm, freshly baked banana nut muffin was heaven in my mouth. One of my friends got the chocolate chip pancakes, which I had a bite of... yummy!!! My other friend got some sort of chili skillet thing, which I didn't try because I'm not a chili fan. 

The service was great and they have these little things that you flip the face on and a server comes by ASAP to see what you need. It's a great system and I wish more places did it that way! 

So, my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5? While the seasoning for the potatoes was amazing, the potatoes themselves were dry and not the best texture breakfast potatoes I've had. I know this is little, but dry potatoes are just blah to me. 

I will go back, because it was delicious. But I may skip on the potatoes (and instead pick up some of the seasoning to make my own).",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,1,1,4,FrpBtSEKBBp13PA3R4zxFg

I have met 2 other people who hate eggs just as much as I do. I don't know what it is, I CAN eat eggs in fried rice,  and I LOVE egg rolls, but I just can't eat eggs by itself. Nonetheless, my husband loves Eggs Works, so you may find me here quite often. 

I appreciate that they have items on their menu that doesn't have eggs. Although, I would stick to the breakfast dishes because the one time I ordered a burger, it was very dry and tasted horrible. I usually order Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy. Sometimes they drown the two biscuits in their sausage gravy, but it tastes good and is not too salty or watery. The works potatoes are also very addicting, although I feel that sometimes they give you too much of that as well. It makes me wonder how much  they end up throwing away everyday? My husband loves the Island Favorite because of the Portuguese Sausage, and Egg Works is a much closer drive than going to downtown. 

Usually service is average and quick, but our visit today was just horrible. First of all, we waited about 20 minutes for a server to take our order. Second, they screwed up my order. I ordered my usual, and our server said ""it comes with works potatoes, is that ok?"" I replied yes. Then she asked ""would you like to add any eggs or meat with that?"" and I said no. Another server delivered our food, and when I saw my small plate with just one biscuit with gravy, I told her that it was missing the second biscuit and the potatoes. She informed our original server, and although she apologized, she just seemed very confused. Apparently she thought that I wanted the side order portion. Funny, the side order doesn't come with the works potatoes. Also, she should have known that because she asked me earlier if I was okay with them. Really? Then she told us that she wouldn't charge us for it, but she did anyway. Well, at least she only charged us for the price of the side order. We also had to wait 20 minutes for our bill. What a disaster! This was the first time we experienced something like this.

I'm sure I'll be back again whether I like it or not, lol. Hopefully we will get a better server next time!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,1,3,9FpPZjaTF004TaNfeMI5dQ
5934558,2010-11-03,2,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"I usually work nights, so breakfast for me is usually lunch for most people. That being said, on the rare occasions that I'm up before 11am, I get a little excited to eat breakfast foods, and usually, Eggworks is my to-go place. 

As their name suggests, they serve typical breakfast faire; omelets, breakfast meats and egg plates, waffles, pancakes, etc., but most of their menu is centralized around the always versatile protein. 

My personal favorites are the scrambles, specifically 'The Works' scramble, which is a medley of 3 scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, mushroom, onions and bell peppers. Simplicity wins here at Eggworks, and their consistency of the quality of food is what keeps me a returning customer. They also give you an option of toast or banana nut muffin with your meal, but I have to urge you to opt for the muffin, it is mighty tasty. 

Service has been good up to date, and it can get very busy during primetime breakfast hours, especially Sunday. 

So if you're in the area, ignore the national franchise pancake houses and diners and come here, it works.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,2,2,4,zwad6nvp6prnmtj3oAvGYQ

Today however was phenomenal as we met Ashley. She was amazing and her attitude was so refreshing.

5960301,2012-05-20,2,4qG3Gh8QyugC1XvoTlmgcQ,"I have been to this location on several occasions and I'm usually drawn there because of a coupon. On this occasion, I had a buy one breakfast get one breakfast free (up to an $8 value) coupon from my trusty Entertainment Book with me. 

As always, I suggested to my fella that we share a savory and a sweet dish and once again, I was rebuffed. I ordered the pork chops with scrambled eggs, my fella got the sunshine skillet and my mom ordered the classic breakfast with hamsteak. All our food was solid breakfast fare. I have never been a fan of the home style potatoes they serve at Egg Works, so I went with the hash browns well-done. The hash browns were more like hash brown patties, which I was a little disappointed by, but they were actually pretty tasty. My meal was tasty. When we were finished eating, each of us had about half of our meals still left on our plates. The portions are enormous. At this point, my fella finally admits that my suggestion of sharing plates would have been a good idea - victory! 

This restaurant is great for breakfast treats, just get there early on weekends or you'll be waiting a while for a table. Service is fast and efficient. I'll be back, and next time I'm getting sweet and savory!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,3,4,reVcOz7TWi8Rp2ZgzYkdng

The menu is fairly expansive so deciding what to get can be overwhelming. However the quality of food is so good I don't think you can go wrong with anything you get here. The portions are on the very large side, so unless you want to pig out or take some leftovers home ask for a half order.

Everything tastes good and is priced very fair and the staff is nice. Too bad we don't have an Egg Works in Southern California.",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,1,5,SHKE_V7IamI9Y2TuMgZhiQ

They offer a large array of breakfast items: pancakes, omelets, corn beef hash and Benedicts and my FAVORITE ""HAWAIIAN STYLE"" breakfast!. (Spam and Eggs baby!!) but if you really wanna try a great Hawaiian favorite, you have to try The LOCO MOCO. Some places try to have there own style of Loco Moco such as special kind of ground beef patty or special kind of rice. Although, the secret in having a great ""LOCO MOCO"" is the gravy! Thank you Egg Works for making the gravy wondeful. Such great flavor. not too salty, not to runny or thick but just rite. Lastly, order the egg over easy on top of your loco moco. you will not be dissappointed.

Other than having great breakfast food the atmosphere is great. Nice and clean which I like. Especially, the restrooms. If the restrooms are unsanitary, than I second guess about how clean the staff is. With 3 adults and 1 two yr. child the cost of eating was very affordable.

I am always pleased to come here either by myself or with friends.  I love the breakfast selection of omelettes but what keeps me coming back over and over again is the Cincinnatti Style Chili or Cincy Chili. You can have it 3 Way (spaghetti, chili cheese), 4 Way (spaghetti, chili, cheese, onions) or 5 way (spaghetti, chili, cheese, onions and beans).  Any ""way"" you get it, it's to die for and just one of many reasons this place feels like home.",OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,1,1,5,IYUOPMh8GXf3mGGTaJK6CA
