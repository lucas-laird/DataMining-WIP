America was running a rib-eye steak special for $14.95.  We were pleasantly surprised by not just the taste but the size as well.  Well worth the money compared to other places on the strip.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  Ask for Chris if you do.  His service was outstanding despite being busy.

The onion marmalade was very good, the patty was soft even when it is well done (it is ground prime rib). The patty is half pound. The burger came with baked potato. The size is big that I can't finish the whole burger, while my husband finished his whole plate including the baked potato. The only down side is that I wish they would put more horseradish aioli on it. 
The service was good. The waiter was sincere and polite.

Another up side is that it opens 24 hours so it is very convenient while the price isn't crazy. The decoration was very interesting too as there is a half wall made into an american map, and there is different things pinned on each state. For example, there is an alligator figure on the Florida state, and there is an astronaut figure on Texas.

The restaurant was clean, not crowded and was a welcome respite from the strip. The wife and I were fairly worn out, very hungry and just wanted a quick bite before heading to our hotel to collapse.

Our friendly server made a few suggestions from the menu, none of them appealed to either of us. We each just wanted something simple, we weren't looking for or expecting a fine dining experience. A nice, juicy hamburger with fries would do the trick.

The orders came out promptly and looked delicious. The fries were hot and crispy but something was definitely not right with the hamburgers. The texture was odd, they had no flavor and after peeling back the bun, no grill marks to show they had ever touched a grill or flat top. I'm 99% certain they were precooked, (maybe even purchased frozen and pre cooked?) then heated in a microwave. The bun LOOKED great but, while not stale, had obviously been around a day or two. We each left 2/3 of our burgers untouched. Paid the bill and left.

Possibly they had an off night, but a decent hamburger isn't hard to do is it? This was our only truly bad dining experience in Vegas during our stay.

I went here 4 times during my trip (all for breakfast) and was not let down by anything, not once. By the last day i was looking for something wrong with the place but was hard pressed to find it. 

Every day the hostess was nice, even genuinely asked us how our morning was going on the way to the table. Our service was great. Even with our special requests, time constraints and what not. It was near flawless. We were always asked if we wanted a mimosa or bloody Mary even though it was like 8 or 9 am!

Now the food. Oh yea, the food! In the 4 days i went, i had Steak and Eggs, A bagel with lox, omelet with lox and 2 eggs sunny side with bacon.  In general all was well above par and blows any Denny's or IHOP out of the water. 

The steak n eggs was about $15 and tasted better then many ""dinner"" steaks I've had in chain restaurants. The bagel with lox was a tad overpriced at near $11, but was delicious. The omelet with lox was good, but the lox were cooked. I sort of expected it on the side (idk why). it just tasted like a fish omelet to me. Strange but good.

My wife got the dinner special which is an 8 oz. steak with 1/2 pound of crab legs, potato, veggies and a salad for $15.  Great value.  My wife liked her steak a lot and the crab legs were OK.  I got the vegetarian club which was not  that great but the fries were very good.  I got the mac and cheese before and I remember it being OK. 

This place isn't expensive, but If you not getting the special then I can't really say its great value.  I can get a great vegi sandwich at the Cheesecake factory for a buck fifty more, plus this place charged $3.75 for crappy iced tea.

The only reason I gave this place 3 stars and not 2 was the good service.  My server was Neverly and he was very nice.  The hostess was very nice too.  The only reason I can see coming here is if you want the special or you are looking for a table service place where you don't have to wait.  I suppose it's a good place for kids too.

Do not come here unless you are desperate because everything else has closed within the hotel and you are too tired to go walking down the strip, like me! Also, don't come here unless you have at least an hour to waste while you are waiting with hunger pangs for your food. 

I came two times during my last trip because I had booked a stay within NY NY which happens to be my favorite hotel in Vegas. I have always liked the food at America and service was always decent.

Both times I came recently were just terrible. The first time we waited exactly 40 minutes for our food. Our waiter seemed to make jokes over the fact that he moved verrrrrrrrrrrrrry slooooowwww. Well he wasn't joking. It ended up being true. It was not busy as this was around 2am. 

Another time we decided to try again for breakfast, hoping the first disaster was just a fluke. The waitress was not very friendly and she never came around. She didn't even serve us our food or give us refills. We had several other people come around to do her job. The thing is, she wasn't even busy. She only had two tables. The place was dead. There is no excuse for terrible service like this.

Also, there was a very obnoxious drunk girl yelling at the bar for the entire time we had to wait for our food to arrive. At first this all seemed slightly amusing, I mean it IS Vegas. However, after awhile it was annoying and none of the staff seemed to give a darn about her behavior. No one told her to pipe down. She just sat there putting on a drunken show for the entire place, cussing and showing undies and falling off the bar stool. I guess this is what keeps the staff awake at 2am. Who knows. 

The food has also decreased in taste and quality. Too bad. I used to really look forward to this place back in the day for some great steak and eggs at 3am. Never again.",D6SCKQqI61IXtvrllfVSJw,1,1,2,QoeiVvUX0NE802du6CaGdQ

Parking: 5/10 - Parking is the lot for the New York, New York hotel.

Restrooms: N/A - Didn't visit.

Overall: 6.5 /10 - A safe bet for a basic meal.  If you are looking for a fine dining experience, this isn't the place to go.  Think ""diner""",6n0zHhe9S8a5USbpDG_fKA,0,0,3,5gvo3KE5S_ILXx5UPM5JFQ

We both ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  Originally we were gonna order all you can eat pancakes but we missed it (last serving was at 11:30 am for the AYCE pancakes @ $7.95).

Our food took awhile to be served but it was okay, the place was busy and we were busy admiring the decor of the place.  The food was good but I noticed it was a little overcooked.  Maybe it sat on food warmers before it was served to us because when they served us, they also served the other surrounding tables guests around us.  Maybe they need to hire more waiters and servers.  Now back to my train of thought, the food was overcooked, the hash browns was a little charred.  The scrambled eggs was perfect, nice and fluffy.  The other good thing was the gravy for the chicken fried steak, lots of flavor.

I wanted to order a healthy meal so I chose the ""eqq-white omelet with the vegetable fritatta"".  The omelet was fried in oil, but it wasn't greasy.  Serving size was medium (I estimate 3 eggs worth + 1 ounce of veggies).  My meal, to say the least was not memorable, and left me a bit hungry.  So I was glad that my meal came with a bowl of diced fruit.

Servers seemed so rushed, but apologetic for being harry. I really felt so rushed and that they just couldn't wait to turn the table. Put it this way, they practically started clearing the table before I was through with my fruit bowl.  So much so that, when I lifted my arm to take a serving of fruit from the bowl, that by time my fork hit the dish, they had wisked away the fruit bowl and my fork ended up scooping air from the table.

After receiving the check, they immediately took the canteen of coffee away.  I guess that was our cue to leave.  On the way out, with our check in hand and headed to the register, we decided to admire the globe on the ceiling (which was the restaurant main feature and what drew us in). After gazing upwards for 20 seconds, the hostess snapped the check from our hand and said, ""i'll just ring you and if you can follow me, you can sign your bill"".   

Price for food/experience was not good.  My small meal + coffee + iced tea came to about 35 bux.  I would definitely NOT return and also NOT recommend to friends! There are better places to blow your money on.",tzpb0JIfIRqV5H-NyEZZ9g,2,1,2,byYbIkoeJ_Jt4kWhKd5Bqw

Coffee is a carafe - so, not the hottest.

Quesadilla - A little oily but not too bad.  It would have been better probably if we ate it at the restaurant so I'm not complaining too much.  The salsa was decent and the filling was significant.  Definitely an American style quesadilla.   Would try it again.

Burger/Fries - Cooked MR and dressed appropriately.  It was a decent burger with no frills at all.  Definitely a $6 burger per Carl's Jr.   The fries were okay but I can't expect too much from pool side service fries.

There were no egg whites to speak of and the teaspoon of hollandaise sauce on each egg was pathetic.  His hashbrowns were a little better than mine but still, way over done and dry.  My daughter got the Red Velvet Pancakes and barely ate 1/3 of them!  They were dry no matter how much syrup she put on them (not sure how that happens) and basically just made your mouth stick together so you couldn't take another bite without taking a drink of something.

The story that I can tell that sums this place up involves a group of us guys roaming in here at 6a (having been up the entire night) and in desperate need of food.

And then we got the pancakes - these were the driest things ever put together - more absorbent than a Sham-Wow. No amount of fake maple syrup could make these things palatable, which in our state is saying something. 

Terrible food. About the only thing that I've found on the menu that's any good is the bagel sandwich.

I believe this is the same place where NYNY's room service comes from...based on the similarity in menus and presentation. The food is acceptable when it's the middle of the night and you don't want to get out of bed, but if you're looking for a place to have lunch or dinner...go elsewhere.

My Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs was tasty, fatty, and delicious. Our waters were constantly refilled, and the decor and environment felt relaxing enough. What really stood out was...as I am asian..I MUST have soy sauce with my over easy eggs..Get that Ketchup and Salsa away from me. Our server said it'd be no problem, and she actually went all the way to neighboring restaurant Chin Chin to get me a bowl of soy sauce. Wow above and beyond the call of duty.
  The only real reason I gave this four rather than five stars, was that our server disappeared for what seemed like ten minutes before we could pay our bill. Not a deal breaker, but a nuisance nonetheless.  Anyway if you're in NYNY and want some breakfast, it's worth a shot.

The theme is exactly that where there's a giant model of America floating above with states labeled according to specialty.  Our first visit was at 4am in the morning with only one other group in the restaurant.  There was a sign that advertised a 16oz Ribeye Steak Special for $12.99 from 12am-5am.
Are you kidding me!  Forget the steak and eggs, get me the special!
I ordered the Special, rare of course.  This steak was big!  It took up half the plate and was plump and juicy!  My steak was cooked perfectly!  A steak like this can easily go for $20-$25.

I was definitely hungry so I ordered some spicy wings. The wings were a little too bready for me and they had a weird after taste. Not great.

The husband ordered the brownie sundae which was ginormous! 'Murica! The vanilla ice cream tasted like some generic drug store brand, which was off putting. You know how sometimes you don't eat ice cream out of the carton for a long time and there's that thick chewy bit at the top? That's what it tasted like.

I asked if we could sit on the edge and not in the middle of the room, because we wanted a quieter spot than being smack in the middle of everyone. The hostess was rude and told us only one table was open and it was one in the middle.

It was awful. Cold, hard, I couldn't even cut it with a fork. The french toast also had no flavor, very bland. My mom had the regular french toast, and her food was also pretty bad. Cold, no flavor and looked like her bread was smashed. It was so dreadful I called over a manager. The manager was a very nice lady. She apologized and comped our meal.

First off, I got sick eating here. That should be a red flag to people considering the place, but it honestly could have what I ordered. Wanting to be cheap I got the roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was served cold which was fine with me. But it tasted very strongly of horseradish to the point where the store bought roast beef and veggies were sort of overpowered. That was also fine. I thought it'd at least make the sandwich taste like SOMETHING, but not to long into my meal and I felt a strange gagging reflex and a rumbling in my tummy. The meat seemed to have gone bad and it was very well masked by the aforementioned horseradish. I spent the night with an upset stomach and a bit of heaving.

... RIch... the bartender... 

We are making a 15 hour trek from CA to CO and our first stop is to blow some cash in Vegas... let's check out New York NY... 

So 300.00 down the drain and down on our luck we are hungry... starving say the least... we walk around and find America. 

We decide to sit at the bar ( some thing i rarely do).. watch some college football... and order up some grub. Rich comes over to take care of us.. and take care of us he does. Charming personality, and doesn't seem to get ruffled.... 

One thing my friend and I love to do is watch people tip. We watched him serve up things great time after time, and never flinch when gathering up his tips.. be it the 50 cent change or 2.00 for a 3.00 beverage.. he smiled, checked on his entire client group ... along the bar... often. 

I like this place, good bar set up, nice sizable dining area.. and a great big map of the USA, with little symbols on each state.. probably a great place to take you kids.. should you have had to bring them to Vegas... and get a little education out of it. 

The price is the price... what you would expect from a Vegas Restaurant... 2 bud light drafts, 1 Pepsi, 2 chicken sandwiches .. and edamame... oh yeah, and the food we extremely satisfying... 

Like I said, RIch is 2 of these stars alone. He was great with his co-workers.. his shift ended while we were there and we hurried up and cashed out and give him what we thought hopefully made up for the lower, unappreciative, prior tips!!",MQOXalbozCE9cT1Kui_ZxQ,1,0,5,dnVYtdY-Tzg4p871yo0P8A

Service was TERRIBLE and there were hardly any diners in the place.  It was far from crowded.  We asked our server for more water and a few lemons, and he forgot both, even after we reminded him.  We had to help ourselves from the lemons at the bar- LAME.  Then he made some comment like, ""I could have brought those to your table, you know,"" full of attitude.  

When we finally got our bills (he also had major 'tude with giving us individual tabs), he had given us all of our change in quarters.  Some of us had more change than necessary and some of us were short-changed.  NONE of us had the correct change.  At this point I lost it and proceeded to go pretty much ape sh*t on our 45 year old server with a comb-over.  ""Excuse me, look- all of our change is completely um, how do i say this, NOT RIGHT. AT ALL.""  He gives me a blank stare and then shrugs it off: ""Sorry, we don't have any other coins except quarters here.  We give change in quarters."" Then he smiles sweetly and says, ""Would you like to speak to the manager, miss?""  the rest is pretty ugly from there.

Now, let me clear that i am not expecting the world's greatest meal OR service from America the restaurant inside a Vegas casino.  However, I do expect to get what i pay for and that includes getting the correct change back, NOT IN JUST QUARTERS. 

As far as this restaurant goes, it's America the Shitty, and I would rather just roll to any other hotel's 24/7 cafe to eat.  They all have one.

It is a large model of the continental United States, with Alaska and Hawaii hanging on the wall.  It is a 3D model, so familiar landmarks are highlighted with cool little structures and lights.  For example, there is a small Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, and a Space Needle in Seattle.  My kids loved it.

On to the food...  The kids had donuts.  Haha.  The adults enjoyed the breakfasts.  I had a waffle, which came with powdered sugar with butter and syrup, but they do provide fruit toppings as well for an additional fee.  Portion sizes were fair and food came out quickly.

At the time we were there, some kind of construction was happening right in the restaurant, which was interesting.  The sound of drills and the scent of sawdust accompanied our meal.  It actually wasn't too bad, and I share that only because it looks like they are going to have some other feature there, so I'm curious to go back and check it out.

Overall, this is a convenient place to have a meal if you are staying at the NYNY Hotel for several days.  If you are here briefly, there are so many other places to eat that I'm not sure this would be the first place on your list.  However, if you find yourself here for a meal or stopping by for a donut, I think you'll have a good time.",PesNFqw_8e20OK33RVfEeQ,1,1,4,6gFamfLUHyzG7bkOhF4Uag

Food:  I had a burger, which was fine; there's only so many ways to screw up a burger, after all.  My wife ordered an advertised special, which was steak and crab legs.  She told me they were the best crab legs she'd ever had, and they certainly appeared fresh and well-prepared; I've never seen anyone have such an easy time getting huge hunks of crab meat out of the shell, especially with snow crab.  So, based purely on those crab legs, they'd get a positive review.

Service:  Here's where things fell apart.  Our server was apparently the slowest in the restaurant, which was not at all busy (we'd arrived just after 5, which is really early for dinner in Vegas).  We didn't get out of there until 6:45.  People who arrived after us got their drinks and meals before us, paid, and left before we even finished our meals.  It took him 25 minutes from the time we ordered it to bring dessert!  I mean, it's not like they had to bake the cheesecake or anything!  We really had to hustle to make it to our show, even though we felt we'd allowed plenty of time before we stopped for dinner.

Not that there is anything wrong with eating here at the America inside New York New York, but being in Vegas, there are so much other better dining experiences you can't get in your hometown. So why waste it on simple diner food? If I was a local then this would probably be a good place to just relax and dine at.

But if you have no choice, don't worry. I had the Prime Burger, which is a Half pound ground prime rib, Swiss cheese, red onion marmalade, demi glace and horseradish a√Øoli served with french fries. Everything tasted great and I had really no complaints. 

The place is huge, but never got crowded. They have a cool map of the United States hanging above. It's like a 3D in your face map, so something cool to look at, or entertain your kids with as this would be a great place to dine with your family.

The menu is not overwhelming. There are times you hope the menu has so much stuff it overwhelms, then we complain. Then when it doesn't you have that feeling to still complain and wonder, ""thats it?"" There are plenty of selections, from salads, to soups, sandwhiches, entrees, etc. **YELP TIP** CHECK OUT THEIR WEBSITE FOR THE MENUS

There is a nice simple bar within the restaurant entrance if you want to get your drank on without being in a crowded place. It's INSIDE the NY NY, so you do have to go through the casino, but it is simple to find. 

Would I eat here again? Sure! However, would I actually go here again? Only if I had to.

We stayed at the NY NY hotel, so this was convenient and we ended up eating there 3 times over the course of our stay. Each time we went the place wasn't very busy, but the service was pretty slow. Even so, all of our servers were very friendly and attentive.

We had the following dishes:

Humongous Pretzel - This pretzel really is humongous. It could serve 2-3 people and came with French's Mustard and Cheddar Cheese Sauce. It was what you would expect any soft pretzel to be: soft and chewy and delicious.  

Petite Caesar Salad - While it maybe ""petite"" it really was a generous serving. The house made croutons were huge (and my toddler loved chewing on them), and it was pretty tasty.

ABC Omelet and the Ham & Cheese Omelet - Pretty good. Generous amount of avocado on the ABC omelet, and lots of ham in the Ham & Cheese omelet. I thought it was interesting that the cheese wasn't inside the omelet, but rather melted on top. Both came with hash browns and choice of toast, and a delicious mini muffin.

Steak and Eggs - Steak was a bit under cooked, but the rest was good. 

Corned Beef Hash & Eggs - A little greasy and kind of a small portion,but good nonetheless. 

America is careful to prevent cross contamination if you have a gluten intolerance, which we really appreciated. They have several options that are GF and took the time to make sure everything came out as it should. The prices here were pretty decent, too.

They also have good coffee, which was a nice break from Starbucks.

These 24 hour diner style establishments I review as if I am forever comparing them to a Denny's.  When I arrived at America I was seated quickly and brought water and coffee quickly, which in Vegas is a great way to start any meal.  Big old carafe of weak coffee is plopped down on your table within a minute of sitting down, and although it isn't the finest quality it makes up for it in quantity.  They have this giant tilted sculpted map of America that hangs precariously over your head as you eat.  I was seated under Texas and this did not make me happy, but examining the map/art thing was a great way to pass the time until my food arrived.  The service was quick and prompt, although the waiter forgot my smoothie on the first trip but realized it himself and was back super quick with it.  My breakfast plater thing had a good amount of mediocre food, that looked like it had actual veggies in it.  Weird.  Also the bacon had some sort of thickness (it was NOT thick bacon), but when you compare it to the bacon at a Denny's it was pretty divine.  I am pretty sure they had some kind of all you can eat buttermilk pancakes for a pretty good price as a special, but a lot of basic pancakes just didn't special to me.  I overheard that this is the food that they serve as room service in New York New York, so hopefully that helps.
Things I like : Decor, Lots of coffee, bacon, hash browns, service

My boys loved their food, husband was happy - cleaned his plate! - and I was satisfied with my pulled pork sandwich.  I didn't finish it because it was a big sandwich with coleslaw and melted cheese.  Mine was served with a side of fries, and so was my boys burger.  The steaks were served with a baked potato and a side of veggies.  The veggies were cooked and seasoned perfectly!  Most places we go to are ALWAYS over seasoned, but this was perfect!

We made a reservation and our table of four was seated immediately.  Our waiter, Rich, showed up right away and gave us a rundown of the alcohol menu.  I had a great cocktail and my friends shared a bottle of reasonably-priced wine.  

We were all pleased with our food.  We shared an order of edamame (dee-lish!) and a caprese salad (yum!).  The starters arrived promptly.

For my main course, the cobb salad did not disappoint.  The veggies were fresh and the bacon crisp.  It was a good cobb.  My sister had the cedar plank salmon, and it was perfectly cooked.  My friend had a salad with tuna, and she liked it.  My other friend devoured her cheeseburger in a matter of seconds, and had quite the smile on her face.

The four of us shared the hot-fudge brownie sundae for dessert.  Seriously THE BEST hot fudge brownie sundae I have ever tasted.  The brownie was moist, soft, chewy, with just a few nuts.  The fudge was thick and rich.  This sundae was AMAZING.  Just remember that the bottom of the ice cream dish is coated with hot fudge, so don't ignore the bottom of the bowl!

I can't say enough about our waiter.  Rich is my newest crush.  Turns out he's so good at what he does that he's been promoted to bartender.  Plus, he looks like a young Kevin Bacon / Nick Nolte / Gary Busey (when he was young and handsome) hybrid, so we gave him a hard time all evening.

The steak was average but good enough for the price. The crab legs were pretty decent not the best but good. The potato was great. The salad was average. The bread was amusing.

Had this been a review for last year, it would have been 5 stars.

Our waiter was GREAT!

Jump ahead exactly 12 months.  We returned for a repeat of the great time we had in 2010, however, we were met with HORRIBLE service and a bartender who REFUSED to add sugar to our Guinness!!  REFUSED!  I have NEVER been refused something so simple, plus they set precedence for it the previous year.  MARY was the bartender and BONNIE was our server - UGH!  NEVER AGAIN!  I even showed Bonnie a photo of my beer on my phone with the ""America"" napkin under it.  She really didn't care.  She also only checked on us once the entire 2 hours we were there, and we had to hunt down people to get us refills on drinks, and pay our bill.  The table next to ours agreed with the bad service when they had to yell for someone to take their bill, too.

Both nights we ended up seeking refuge at the America Diner at some ungodly hour, much like old travelers of yore would seek refuge at a Tavern to escape the icy snowstorm howling outside.   Except in our case it wasn't howling but it was the incessant sound of clinging coins, and it wasn't a snowstorm but utter mayhem on the Casino floor.   Lastly, it wasn't icy but it was an inconceivable amount of cheap booze that would leave us clutching ourselves in agony the next morning.  While the food pretty much sucked at America, I'm still pretty fucking glad the place was still open at 3 AM on Sunday morning.

While my wife ordered the steak the first night, she opted for the pancakes the second night.   I went with the Macaroni & Cheese and a Spicy Chicken Sandwich the first night and the Macaroni & Cheese and Potato Skins the second night.    (Hey! Nothing like simple carbs to absorb an insane amount of alcohol lounging about in your stomach)

The first night, the Mac & Cheese tasted very much like I what I imagine a Salt Lick tastes like.   The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was anything but.  I'm guessing they ran out of Buffalo sauce and they figured I was too drunk to give a fuck.   While it's true I was too drunk to start an argument then & there, I knew I'd get these fuckers on Yelp sooner or later.    The Mac & Cheese the 2nd night was legit... not great but certainly better than the first night since I could actually glimpse the taste of cheese that time around.   My wife said the steak was completely fucked up and she's still having painful bowel movements some 48 hours later.   The pancakes were good, but then again how does one really fuck up pancakes now, right?

If this was the Bay Area, I'd probably give this place 1 star or 2 at the very most.   Seeing as they're open 24 hours a day though, I'm being generous and giving them 3 stars.

I stopped for dinner here before the Vegas Strong Benefit Concert at the arena nearby.  The restaurant was almost empty.  Service was attentive and I had the idea it would be just as attentive if the place was half full.  

I ordered an iced tea and the Miami Press.  The menu states it as: ""shaved pork and ham with Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and mayo on a grilled Telera roll.""  I expected the sandwich would be pressed but that was just the name.  It was not the Cubano type sandwich I was expecting.  Nevertheless, the sandwich was good.  The meat piled high and the Telera was good.  It was also a good amount to eat.  But having seen their desserts when I walked in, there was room for one small dessert.  I got the New York Nights--chocolate sabayon with chocolate dacquoise and raspberry coulis on a short dough base.  It was a perfect way to end the meal.

My server, Neverly, was around to attend to anything I needed and he was quite a pleasant fellow.  By the way, locals, there's a 10% discount for those of us smart enough to live here.  Use it and enjoy.

I believe we dined here 4 times during the course of our stay at New York New York. Twice for breakfast, once for lunch and dinner. The second time around I wasn't too impressed with the Philly Cheesesteak special. The bread felt very soggy and that ruined the taste.

For Breakfast, I had the New York State of Mind which is your traditional bacon, eggs, white toast with a side of fries. Their bacon strips are huge and I absolutely loved it. However they charged $5 for Orange Juice which I was not very pleased to see when the bill arrived. Very very overpriced for Orange Juice. Shame on you, 1 star off for trying to gouge the customer.

That being said, by the looks of their menu, there's an extensive line of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Prices look decent, especially since America is inside a casino.  We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food. 

As for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts. 

PS:  Additional photos of America's cronuts can be found here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donut-crawl-ii-las-vegas?select=IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg#IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg

Take 2- Manager comes out to apologize for the order. OK, muffin not burnt, but only a the tips of the crust seem to be a little charred. Bite- why is this muffin not toasted? hollandaise sauce was thick and gewey, tasted a bit mushy. Egg was a bit overcooked and hash browns were mushy on the outside. No amount of Ketchup could save them. Only hate 1/2 of one muffin.

We arrived around 11:15 and all the donuts were gone from the display case, not because they were sold, but because they must remove them at a certain time every day?

The layout of the restaurant is strange. The room with seating is huge and there is a ginormous 3-D map of America on the wall. It feels very hollow, because it's so large, even though you can tell they are trying to create a fun space. It also looks tired and the decor is...meh.

All I really wanted was dessert, but our waiter told me they only had like two of the ten desserts available at that hour. That's pretty weird since they are a 24-hour establishment. Why am I unable to get a slice of chocolate cake at 11:30 p.m.? We ended up ordering appetizers (fries/potato skins) and a brownie sundae.

You see, when it comes to eating the day after a long night of drinking, there's not much you can do to fuck it up.  Unless of course you're ""dining""  at New York, New York's very own bland-a-tron.  America, is a veritable cornucopia of bad food, cheesy decor and, get this, surprisingly good service.  Yeah, go figure. 

There were 8 of us eating and the majority of us all had something to say about the pathetic dishes that were brought out.  My BLT looked like it was made with bread from the local 99 cent store.  My friend Ian, who also ordered the BLT and fries, received 7 french fries on his plate.  Yes, 7.  Needless to say, we complained and got the rest of the missing fries to join his sandwich.

While the collective moans and groans at the table regarding the food were many, I found our waitress, Sigi, to be on top of her game.  It was almost as though she had a sixth sense regarding everything at the table.  Whether it was when we were placing the order or needing a refill, there she was, Joanna on the spot.

But , regardless of how good Sigi was, service only gets you so far.  So, when you're taking a break between between betting on black and rolling those dice, think twice about getting something to eat at America...it's a definite gamble.

 I was very disappointed with my experience at America. During long layover I'm Vegas I decided to go on the strip for a few hours. I needed to start with breakfast. I passed up 48TH and Crepes because the line was really long and there was no where to sit. My weariness led me to make the bad choice of choosing America.  I knew going on the food was overpriced for what they were serving but i was really tired after flight.
I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and after waiting 20 min for my order, even though the place was slow, I saw my food and knew right away I was going to regret choosing this place. It came with 3 pieces of chicken which could have came fron a chick they were so tiny. I could tell the chicken was bought prepared and heated up. It had that familiar orangey color diner chicken has where the establishment is too lazy to flour chicken themselves. Lots of places actually serve this chicken and it's not bad tasting but it can easily be dry. Of course those tiny pieces were far from moist. The Waffles were crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle, nothing spectacular about the flavor. But my guess is that any place who doesn't take pride in preparing their own chicken, probably bought the waffle mix prepared as well.
Funny that the restaurant is called America, pretty ironic. Lazy, no pride in your product, over charging customers, the buck you make is more important then the goods they are pedaling.  Is that what they are saying America is?

When my entree arrived I was surprised to discover that the avocado was simply sliced up and garnished on top my omelette. My side bacon was not that great though. I specifically asked the waitress if the bacon was good there and she assured me that she would make sure it was cooked properly and it would crunchy. My bacon came out somewhat burnt and chewy. Overall, my omelette was satisfying and the grandmotherly hostess was the highlight.",rj9-ndvzOYoUIyRjTuUylA,0,0,4,cfh0MkEh7DFjPlJZ03QZdA

Came here on a weeknight around 12AM with a fairly large group (13 people). We were seated fairly quickly after a 10-minute wait. This place is huge and it was fairly empty at this time. The map of the US hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch and very educational.

Almost everyone in our group got the $12 rib-eye steak midnight special. My steak was delicious! and cooked to my liking. Although I had asked for my steak to be cooked medium, my gf noted that it wasn't medium and that it was missing the little plastic thing they stick on the meat to show how well it was cooked.

Medium or not, I still enjoyed it. Must be my hunger taking over. I've also never heard of HP brand steak sauce until I came here. I usually pour A1 on my steak but after trying the HP sauce, I'm a convert! It had more zing and brought out the taste of the steak to the fullest.

We had a lava cake for dessert but I didn't like the ice cream that came with it. Toffee/coffee flavored. I prefer chocolate or vanilla next to my lava cake.

My only complaint was that I had ordered my steak with mash potatoes but instead it came with baked potato. I liked the baked potato enough so I didn't bother to have it exchanged. Also, I had to flag down the waiter a few times to remind him to bring/refill my gf's iced tea. He keeps on forgetting. I guess I can't blame him for serving a huge group on a graveyard shift.

Other than that, I believe America is an ok place. It's not a fine dining establishment but I am somewhat surprised with all the one-two star ratings.

On our first visit, we ordered the BLT (applewood smoked bacon, lettuce and
tomato on sourdough bread) and Corned Beef Hash & Eggs (slow cooked corned beef and shredded potatoes with onions and peppers, served with two eggs any style). Both were ok. The BLT was better than the corned beef. The corned beef was actually pretty bland, which was surprising because usually that type of dish is quite salty. On our second visit, we got the Breakfast Burrito (farm fresh eggs, black forest ham, bacon with chorizo sausage and pepper jack cheese, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla) and the King Club (roasted turkey breast, applewood smoked bacon, romaine lettuce and tomatoes on toasted sourdough). These two were a lot better than our first visit. They were good, but nothing too special about them.

The true stars of this place are the donuts. They are huge, sweet, and decadent. I mean, what isn't to love about a nice fresh donut? We got the Strawberry Shortcake (frosted strawberry icing with a vanilla & strawberry filling) and the Boston Cream (chocolate frosting and custard cream filling). I am usually not a fan of filled donuts, but these were so delicious.

The service was a little slow, but totally understandable because it was during the breakfast rush, but overall a pretty decent experience. I would go here again if I was staying in New York New York again.",62F28369AY13NOZxUA5tfA,2,1,3,mmU8TDOBDBcLsBLACOmoDQ

The menu seemed like your typical diner food. The only disappointing thing is that they don't offer combo dishes. I ordered the cinnamon apple waffle but if I wanted it with a side of eggs and bacon, it was an additional charge (like $4 for each item!). But maybe I'm just used to the Dennys and IHOPs and whatnot.

Servers were polite but it took a while for our meals come out. We were told that they wanted to bring everyone's meal out at the same time (keep in mind we had eleven people). Unfortunately some meals weren't as warm as others.

Despite that, food was ok. Everyone in the party seemed satisfied. The bagel and lox seemed like a popular dish amongst us.

The doughnut bar is wonderful and has excellent selections. They stay open 24 hours but the food taste much better than any 24 hour place I've been. Not to mention that in Vegas 24 hour spots are required knowledge. I've been twice and in both experiences the waitresses were excellent and patient.  Bonus:This cafe serves alcohol!

THE BAD: American food can be found a little cheaper elsewhere.  It's in a Hotel Casino and that may not suit all families. This also means you can't park out front so you'll have to walk from the hotel parking structure waaaay out back. They allow smoking indoors in Las Vegas.

Well we decided to jump into the ordering process which was another nightmare...which again for a totally dead restaurant why would you leave 1 waiter to help out such a huge party leaves a big question on who is managing this place? I can't put all the blame on our server because he really was trying to hustle his butt off but I think the lack of sheer disorganization lead to the ultimate melt down.

Here we go food not coming out with everyone else's food...cold food...my wife's food never got ordered...mix ups with food...the mediocre food at best...then ultimate melt down; paying the bill. This literally took 30+ mins to get figured all because they couldn't put families groups together.

The only hot sauce America has is red Tabasco, which I don't care for by itself.  So, the waiter asked if I would like to try their salsa.  I said I would.

I was annoyed when the bill arrived and I had a $1.50 charge for the salsa.  It's not that I care about paying $1.50, but he offered like he was doing me a favor and didn't mention it was an additional charge.  I would have still said yes, but I feel like you should give diners a heads up when there is a charge that's not on the menu directly in front of them.

The sandwich was large and did not stay together well.  The bagel was grilled, but not toasted.  I would have preferred it toasted for a more consistent result.  The shaved ham overwhelmed the sandwich, which is too bad because the bites I did get with bacon were very good.  The hash browns had a decent sear to them, they clearly were cooked well.

Staff - one of them was clueless but luckily another came and rescued her. How hard of a question is, ""which donut do I need to try?""

Our server who took our drink order came back with only 2 sets of utensils instead of the 3.  We way looked at our menus (which I think were way too bland).

After our orders were taken, the service got slow and I think if it wasn't for the 3 of us having our cell phones this wait would have been longer than we would have enjoyed...Thank you Interwebs!

Our food finally had arrived and much like the menu, the taste was mediocre.  Nothing too way over the top to be memorable enough to be the best food ever and all.

The first go around, they bring out a stack of three pancakes. After that, it comes in a stacks of twos. The hubby ate five pancakes in total. He said that the pancakes were light and fluffy.

After reading so many articles about the famous croissant doughnut, I had to try it. This was the first time that I'd seen a Cronut in my life. It's truly the best pastry that I've had in a long time. Yes, it must be really bad for you and really fattening, but it's so good. It's hollow on the inside, which makes it light and airy. On the outside, it has a sugary glaze, and is flaky and crispy. It really doesn't get much better.

I like the decor of this restaurant. While it's not fancy or sophisticated like fine dining, it's bright and clean. They have this piece of artwork that hangs from the ceiling. It's a map of the United States and has decorations of what each state is known for. Alaska and Hawaii is off to the side and have their own little section.

Probably not the first place on most Las Vegas gourmand agendas, the 24/7 ""America"" at New York-New York Casino had always interested me if only for its kitschy design plus one of the city's few Monte Cristo sandwiches, but it was not until I heard about the restaurant's in-house donut program that I finally committed to an early morning visit; the expansive restaurant largely unoccupied as servers joked around at the bar while ""American"" Top-40 played from speakers hidden by the enormous map of the good ol' USA.  Featuring a menu of expectedly American classics ranging from pancakes and waffles to country fried steaks and eggs it was with a bit of disdain that I arrived to find the Monte Cristo now relegated to the 'lunch' menu but happy to accommodate given the restaurant's 24-hour nature it was with a simple request that the sandwich was prepared and arriving on a covered plate alongside the Frosted Flake French Toast both dishes would prove competent , though nothing to write home about, with prices and portions both in line with other Las Vegas Boulevard breakfast joints thus leaving plenty of stomach space for a sampling of the restaurant's deep fried dough.  Featuring no less than a dozen different varieties with three cronuts plus fritters, crullers, filled, raised, cake, and fancy on display it was with a bit of indecision that I pondered my options and eventually settling on a few personal favorites plus those most interesting a quintet was selected at a total of $12.50 and aside from the lackluster, artificial banana flavor of ""Monkey See, Monkey Do-nut"" the results were very impressive indeed; the 'cronut' as close to Dominique Ansel's original in texture as I've found (a plus for those seeking authenticity, though I still prefer Coco's rendition to both,) the Boston Cream featuring surprising subtle custard inside a delicate yeasty pocket, and the apple fritter rife with fresh fruit beneath a delicate sugar crunch plus plenty of cinnamon rivaling some of the finest I've ever sampled; the best in Las Vegas by far.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,4,FTt9AVy4E6TjwV-SWpVH2g

The food was pretty so-so. I ate here a few times during my stay and nothing wowed me.

I ordered a fruit salad with cottage cheese for breakfast one day and it was really good--the fruit was fresh and everything tasted good. The next day I ordered the same thing and the fruit looked markedly different--wilted, definitely not as fresh and the cottage cheese tasted ""off"".

I wouldn't waste my time ordering coffee here, so I got a latte made at Il Fornaio next door. Though they take a while and the line gets long, the coffee there looked much better than the coffee shop variety here.

5336977,2018-05-20,0,Md6895ZtS3FA8a0pUaH6nw,"After reading some bad reviews of this place, I was hesitant to try it, but am glad I did.  This restaurant is located very conveniently in the NYNY hotel and casino, right next to the main registration area.  It can be difficult in this hotel to find a decent, convenient place  for  breakfast.  The choices are not great - upscale places that are not open for breakfast or village eatery areas that are not the most comfortable for seating and also tend to be noisy. So, America was the choice for two breakfasts at NYNY.

Yes, prices tend to be high for what you get, but that's the situation with all strip locations.  My first breakfast was avocado/bacon omelette  served with sourdough toast.  It was okay - nothing to write home about, but not bad either.  The toast was buttered and rather good.  I had expected the avocado to be inside the omelette but it was served on top.  Again, nothing amazing, but it did the job. A-OK.  

Some people on Yelp have complained about the waiting time and service. I didn't experience any problems at all with service.  This is a BUSY place, being  centrally located, with  few other  very great alternatives for a basic good breakfast  at NYNY, so you can imagine that the staff is kept super super busy.  Me and my guest didn't have a long wait for our food.  About normal, I would say, for the amount of people there in the morning.  So, no complaints about service.  The servers were all very nice, courteous and helpful. 

We loved looking at the huge map of the U.S. suspended across the ceiling.  So fun, and great to take a photo  for your fam back home.

For the second breakfast, me and my guest searched  for a different place to eat, but gave up and came back to good ole America. We saw that they had donuts and pastries in the window out front, but didn't see anything there offhand that appealed.  So, we went in and were seated.  We both ordered their ""croissant donut""...and OMG.  Of everything we had for three days in Vegas, those croissant donuts were the BEST THING WE HAD. That's the truth, seriously.  They  are in several flavors - cinnamon sugar, honey drizzle, chocolate or  butterfinger.  We had the cinnamon sugar and it was TO DIE FOR.  They look like big double decker type donuts, but they are light as a feather inside because they are actually croissant-type dough. If you've ever had a ""cronut"", these are similar, but way better in my opinion.  Totally addictive.  Before I left for home, I bought two more to take with me, the honey and the chocolate.  The cinnamon is my fave of all the flavors.

So, I would definitely return to America if I go back to NYNY, if only for their donuts!",r1Z8dxSnd7T4XEAhVUoA0Q,0,0,3,knTpiCuzSHsf4A_hj48e4A

We came in and ordered fairly quickly as there were only a few people sitting in this enormous room filled with memorabilia from around the
United States. I ordered the steak special which came with two sides. I ended up getting some coleslaw to substitute the vegetables and an order of the french fries.

The food came out in about 12 minutes or so, which is a good time to wait. The steak was decent. It was a litte tough to tell the truth, even though I had ordered it medium rare. Id say the steak was decent 
especially for the price so theres nothing to complain about.  The 
coleslaw was forgettable as were the fries.

The need to hydrate in Vegas is of the absolute importance. Ha!

I opted for the bagel mania which is a grilled NY style bagel sandwich with bacon, eggs, ham and good ol' american cheese. It was delicious not only cause I was starving at the moment but the combination of ingredients was perfect. The cheese topped off the bacon, eggs and ham. And all those things were encapsulated in a perfectly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside grilled bagel. Delicious... It was just what i needed. It came with country style potatoes. That was pretty good too.

You're a 15.00+ cab ride away from your hotel down the strip and you have no cash, your friends are borderline vomits, you're wearing a $500 dress that's sopping wet from a naked hot tub party that seems like a distant memory (wait, naked? how was my dress wet?) and the only thing that's going to keep you alive is a cup of coffee and some buttered toast. Where do you go? You go to America, the only restaurant that will cater to your busted, drunk ass. 

We ordered sausage, eggs and toast, a pot of coffee, chicken fingers and nachos. Someway or another, the grand total of the bill was $60, not  including tip. This is for crap I probably could have bought at 7-11 for $10.00 or less for the same quality. I guess when you're drunk and rambling, you have to pay extra for someone to try to decipher the shit coming out of your mouth. 

The service here is terrible. It's because the people who work here hate their lives and it's evident in their lack of facial expression. Some may be suicidal, I mean, if I was working there at 4 am trying to talk to drunk people who have no idea what they're doing or saying, I'd probably think off-ing myself would be a good idea, too. 

The only thing worth mentioning is that fucking gigantic map of the US. I've been to America a bunch of times, the most recent time being the basis of my review - but that shit is funny when you're sober, when you're drunk, when you're high, and I'm sure if I ever did shrooms or any sort of hallucinogen, I would want to come here and just stare at it. 

So what I'm trying to say is, don't come here for the food - you come here when you've hit rock bottom with your partying and you need to chill the fuck out with some really greasy, crappy food. Expect to pay a fortune for food that some dog probably shit out a few hours earlier. That's all I really have to say.",M-XJkJWgzKEUURS2wawcuw,3,2,2,SMDx_nz0AG_wYg6OUNJJ4g

Actually three times if you count me ordering room service my first day and this being it..

The first time was excellent!  Service was fantastic, hostess was very sweet and talked to me as I came in.  She actually seemed interested in talking and listening when I told her about my stay so far.  Coffee was delicious, good food (although I didn't love the fried eggs).  The restaurant is huge inside so there was no waiting .  Loved it!

I came the next morning and got a completely different experience.  It was actually BAD.  Waiter didn't seem concerned about getting me anything in a timely fashion.  Again, the restaurant wasn't too busy, so there was no excuse.  
My food was so bad and the eggs were so runny, that I had to send them back.  And I never send food back because I feel bad....
Anyhow, I sent it back (after waiting forever to get the waiter's attention and instead I got the manager's attention).
My food came back a second time partially cooked more, but still runny.  I hate the runny white part in eggs over medium.  It was pretty gross.  I couldn't eat it and was starving by then, so I just ate the toast and bacon.
My toast was ice cold.  The butter wouldn't even melt on it.
I was told there wasn't any creamer for the coffee, and instead they brought me a cup with milk in it.  I ended up not drinking my coffee at all.

I was ready to rip this place apart....

Then I asked the waiter for the bill since he didn't seem to get the hint that I had been sitting there forever waiting for it.  And he told me the manager covered it and not to worry about it.

Fortunately for me, I didn't have any cash and couldn't even leave him a tip.  Not that he deserved a dime.

So because the manager at least had the common courtesy to cover my breakfast, I didn't give them the 1 star I had planned....

It was located right off the elevator of the hotel and it's open 24 hours. As of writing this review, this was our third time visiting this restaurant in four days, but not because it's amazing: just because it's there. 

My sister was turning 21 so the bartender the first night gave her $1 birthday shots. Awesome. The second time we visited was a Saturday morning, and it was understandably crowded, busy, with a short wait to be seated but a really long wait to be served, however, they did what they could. It was an average cost for pancakes but the serving sizes were huge. I only ate 1 1/2 pancakes out of the three I got. Thy have an all you can eat special for pancakes and I can't imagine eating more than two. A lot of the meals at this restaurant (and honestly in Vegas in general) do not include sides and drinks which is ridiculous in my opinion. 

Overall, the food was average. The most average American cuisine you could ever experience. I'm not a very adventurous eater, so if you like to stick with the classics, (burgers, fries, chicken wings/tenders) this is the restaurant for you. Average service, average food. The worst thing about this restaurant was that the frozen margarita machine was broken all three times I visited so far, and the milkshakes tasted like milk with whipped cream on top. The fries were burnt and hard as a rock both times I had them. Horrible. The highlight of this restaurant is the family friendly atmosphere and the decor which includes a giant map of the country!

It's 4am on a Monday and I just walked off the craps table at NyNy resort uber hungry. The food court is closed and the only place open within close proximity is this place. I instantly fear the abhorrent midnight mediocrity that is the standard for most late night casino eats however this place is a welcome surprise for late night eats. 

I ordered the 15.99 rib eye steak late night special; medium rare with a loads baked potato and the lady ordered the monte cristo sandwich. 

Food quality was very good. 
The steak was a generous ribeye cut and it was actually cooked as requested. (I say that because you can't ask for the world when ordering late night steak specials) Needless to say, its probably the best steak I've had at 4am . 

The lady's Monte Cristo was as awesome!
The French Toast was well cooked (meaning not runny eggs/sloppy or burnt ). It was the a great marriage between breakfast and lunch in your mouth at 4 am. 

As expected the service and food came out slow. (This is expected when you are dining at 4am) however the server was very friendly and accommodating so it really was not an issue at all. 


I don't know if we lucked out but I can seem to understand how this place has so many bad reviews? This place is much better than most late night casino eats.

We had reserved online several days in advance, and even called to confirm the Thanksgiving menu went all day.  We were told ""of course, why wouldn't it?"" which just sounded like an I don't know or don't care answer so we asked again and got ""yes, as we said the Thanksgiving menu runs through the entire day"".  Even though said with a ""now buzz off"" type tone, we at least we're now confident.

So we get there, show them the reservation and say we would like the Thanksgiving menu.  They said it did not start for 30 more minutes.  When we explained what we were told when we reserved, they said we could have the regular menu only and no we could not wait the extra few minutes to get what we had reserved for in the first place.

Poor service.  So the food may or may not be good, but it wasn't like this was 10:15am or something.  We wanted what we had been told we could get  and went off to somewhere else where we had a 5 star Thanksgiving meal, even got in at rush time with no wait or reservation.

Bad service is one thing, and I'll often forgive - misrepresentation or just not knowing is poor business.  Management here need to train their staff.

I went in prepared for some run of the mill, plain old, American food given that the name of the restaurant is AMERICA. We ordered steak with baked potatoes and grilled veggies. The grilled veggies were the highlight of my meal since the baked potato remained mostly undisturbed and my steak was salty. 

Everyone my age remembers where they were when Princess Diana died, when the Twin Towers fell and now where they were when they heard Bin Laden was killed... me?... I was watching coverage on Fox News while in an establishment called ""America"" inside a hotel called ""New York, New York""!!!! TRUST ME... the irony of this was not lost on me... at all.",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,2,2,ow6jZjtPFtF0mu23HeDzaA

We had a food allergy which I understand is not something I expect businesses to always be able to work with but it was CLEARLY stated on the menu that there were tons of GF options and the waiter couldn't even answer the simple questions about the food. Waiters and waitresses should at the very least be aware of the menu!!!!! I know not to expect a lot when dining out but this place was a joke. They even tried to argue with us about the amount of time it took to get our food. We had proof! The waiter continued to ignore us and avoided eye contact until we begged for the bill. If you hate your job don't work there!!!,0R82lcPktysixL7TN7t3ug,1,0,1,9gMuN69K95rIfsXLbhX20A
