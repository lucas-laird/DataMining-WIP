267694,2008-05-29,1,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"Fin is, quite possibly, the prettiest restaurant I've been to in the US (if you've been to restaurants in Hong Kong, you'll understand why I explicate on the fact that it's ""IN THE US"")

The food is alright. But let's not kid ourselves - the selling point of Fin is NOT the food (ugh, yes, I hate myself for writing this since I consider myself to be somewhat of a ""foodie"" who RESPECTS food).

I went during lunch hour which, in Chinese people language, means dim sum time. From all my previous experience, dim sum is something to be eaten at a gaudy/tacky restaurant where old men eat goose feet while reading the horse-racing section of Ming Pao. THAT'S authentic dim sum. And that's when you know that Fin is FAAAAAAAR from authentic. I mean, when was the last time you ate shumai at a place that looked like it was designed by Philippe Starck?

Don't get me wrong - food is not horrendous. Of course, foodwise, I still prefer the ""authentic"" (i.e. greasy) Chinese fare over the B*sterdized $13 chow fun but, like I said, the food is not the star of the show with regards to Fin. And, in their defense, at least they are conscious of the fact that they are NOT authentic (they sell themselves off as ""CONTEMPORARY"" Chinese cuisine) - just the fact that they have sashimi and pad thai on the menu is proof that they're not trying to pass themselves off as being authentically Chinese.

So yes, you'll enjoy the food but you probably won't remember it. But go anyways - go for the beautiful interior!! That's what the 4 stars are for - not for the food in particular, but for the restaurant itself!",baDwrsfEM_F3n26nhP9Cpw,1,1,4,HVZ2jWqyaefsNiqqLwvApQ

I ordered some sort of duck dish with rice and the duck was bland and the rice seemed to have a weird taste. Also, the duck hadn't been de-boned and the amount of work it took to get any meat off these bones was just unreasonable. Now to be fair, the server did warn me the bones would still be intact, but I'm a newbie when it comes to eating duck and apparently I had no idea the effort it would take just to wrangle a morsel of meat from this creature. So not only was my meal bland but also frustrating. 
My family also seemed to echo my sentiments about the food's flavor. We all kind of agreed that it had potential but something was just a little off. And I think anyone who's been to FIN would agree, for the kind of money you're paying, you should be having a meal that will knock your socks off. 
Next time I will coast right past FIN and head to Cravings, the Mirage buffet. It's not excellent either, but it's leaps and bounds better than FIN.",aS8d5npW9hp8vy0HZUfjiA,0,0,2,aDL9elBpphcI_moR80_GoA

On a good note the decor is really beautiful. 

The Food:  The first course was traditional chinease egg rolls.  They were very yummy, they succedded in elevating something plain to something extradinorary.

The entree:  Absolutly disgusting.  I ordered the peeking duck.  They cut it fresh at the table and it looked great.  However they served it in rolls with enough BBQ sauce to drown a cowboy.  they killed the duck with all the sauce.  It was dripping out everywhere.  

After cleaning the sauce I tried to eat the dck and the skin was not crunchy like duck should be.  It was far too fatty and just not good at all. 

My girls pasta was not cooked well either.  She had a few bites and couldn't stomach the rest.

The fortune cookie and free shot of baily's were great though.  

The service was terrible.  They didn't care that the $70.00duck was horrible.  I don't even thing they understood english.  The waiters were too stiff and had no personality.

I don't give 1's lightly but it's appropriate here.  This place, on this night, was just awful and I would not return.  If your in the mirage and want a great meal, the Japanease place is much much better.",F5RaKQFo3F3bjYjTZ615kA,1,0,1,2wEbjtKmV18QPSv4_r4v0Q
849854,2013-04-16,0,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"As a vegetarian I find myself drawn to Chinese/Asian restaurants as I am certain to find something on the menu. I chose the crispy eggplant for an appetizer - a stretch for me since I am not a huge fan of eggplant. However I found this appetizer very satisfying in taste and texture. The minced garlic/scallion in addition to the vinegar sauce were quite delightful. I wish I could have echoed this experience with my entree. I selected the spicy Ma Po tofu. I found it odd that rice did not come standard - because this dish desperately needed it. The tofu is very flimsy - I struggled with the consistency. I actually combined some of the eggplant from my appetizer and that helped immensely. As for the sauce on the tofu, it was difficult to discern any type of flavor since all I could taste was spice/hot - almost smoky. Definitely would not recommend this, absolutely nothing good about it. 

The meal ended with a complimentary  shot of Baileys and probably the best fortune cookie I have ever tasted, almost like a shortbread. 

The ambience is fantastic. 

I would recommend the restaurant and I will return, just avoid the tofu.",c2Ccc4CCSCWi-gXm_92Auw,0,0,3,fE2_un4vSLLSfzrZEfXEcA

My first night in Vegas I always suffer from major sensory overload which makes it nearly impossible to settle on a place to eat. After roaming through ti and the Mirage my BF and our friend finally settled on Fin after decided we all had a bit of a Chinese Food hankering.

This place is gorgeous inside. There are these curtains of glass ""bubbles"" that separate the tables and it lends a modern, underwater feel. It's also sealed off from the loud, smokey casino and the staff was very softspoken yet helpful and available. It really took the edge off.

I had Mongolian Beef, flavorful and very tender but cut a bit thicker than I prefer. My BF had a soft tofu dish that was smokey and spicey and our friend had the sizzling chicken and sausage clay pot. I normally detest sausage but this was so delicious; flavorful, smokey and noticeably absent were the ""mystery chunks"" that normally make me gag when I eat sausage. We all split curry shrimp fried rice which was yummy if a bit spicy.  It had finely chopped water chestnuts which I usually hate but they gave the rice an interesting crispy but not crunchy texture.

The highlight for me was dessert. I had the fried banana. Super lightly battered and served with a large cup of icy cold, thick sweet orange scented cream, this was the bomb. It was large enough to split between 2 people but I scarfed it pretty much single handedly.

First off, the prices are pretty high. But it's in a row of ""high class"" dining (Samba, Stack, Japonais, etc.) so I can't really expect them not to keep in line with the local pricing.

The staff can be quite ""hovery"" one moment, and then ""disappeary""

I ordered the ""Dinner and a Show"" package which is $49 dollars and you can pick from a soup (well your pick is always Egg Drop because that's the only soup), appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I had the Pot Stickers, which were really good (and probably the highlight of the meal).  The Sweet and Sour Pork was good, but nothing exceptional.  The Dessert was Vanilla Brulee which was quite good with the added fruit.

The Ambiance is nice, but a bit dark, and it IS hard to forget that there is a casino right outside.

Overall I would say the price really is the biggest drawback. Between myself and my wife I spent more than I would for a dinner at The Melting Pot (Granted, this is more food for sure).  Since it was planned as our ""Expensive Dinner"" before the show I knew what I was getting into, but I would never just ""Stop in"" here for a meal.",zF10BKjK4Lz9U_8Yqw28ww,1,0,3,oX9z9r6o0hTpaFC1t8eBGQ

Salt & Pepper Calamari- The calamari had a light batter which provided a delicate crunch. The dish was accompanied by sweet chili sauce on the side and had fried garlic and green chilies on top of the calamari. This was a great appetizer that the entire table enjoyed. (3/5)

Spicy Shrimp & Lobster Sauce- The menu states that this dish is to be served ""Sichuan Style"" but clearly lacked in heat. The lobster sauce was too mild and was more like egg drop soup. Perhaps it's to accommodate for the American palette. I wouldn't advertise this dish as spicy. The bright side of this dish was that the shrimp was prepared very well. (2/5)  

Steamed Sea Bass- If you decide to make a visit to Fin, this is the dish I would recommend! Succulent sea bass is plated on top of a soy-based sauce with cured ham. There is also tender bok choy on the side to cut the richness of the sauce. (4/5)

Spicy Seafood Clay Pot- Shrimps, scallops, sea bass, and squid (say that five times fast!) made up this dish. There were also pieces of spring onion, carrots, and red chilies tossed in. Again, the title of ""Spicy"" did not live up to its name. (2/5)

Lemon Chicken- The breaded chicken was plated with thin lemon slices and had the lemon sauce on the side. The lemon sauce was not overpowering and the chicken was cooked to perfection. But for the price, this katsu-like dish can be found elsewhere. (3/5) 

Stir Fried Green Beans- Skip this dish, period. The green beans were not crisp and tender. They were over-cooked and soggy. (0/5)

Combination Lo Mein- There was more protein than noodles in this dish which makes it hard to criticize. The sauce was light and not too salty. (3/5)

Yang Chow Fried Rice- Pretty standard fried rice. The mild flavor paired very well with the steamed sea bass. (3/5)

The trendy decor of Fin will surely lure in customers but the food won't have me coming back.",XB3jLxGXzD7euz3cGKdkMw,0,0,2,sZEBOzIOy8lJCPsdZ8ZZdw

The portions were also well sized leaving my father and I content and full.  
The only con was that I felt like everything was an up-sale even without noticing it.

1709255,2011-03-16,15,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"***Fin (an upscale Chinese restaurant) at The Mirage is like a lot of other Las Vegas fine dining restaurants--overpriced, mediocre food***

Most Las Vegas (The Strip) restaurants are overpriced.  So if you are planning to eat at a nice restaurant in Vegas, you are probably not going to get your money's worth.  Still, the quality varies quite a bit.  Mesa Grill and Carnevino are both overpriced, but at least their food is good (at least on my visits).  There are other Vegas restaurants where you spend a lot and the food is bad (or mostly bad).  Fin is one of those restaurants.

Fin sits in The Mirage and has a contemporary decor that is nice though it does not really stand out.  The restaurant is very close to the casino, but it is still pretty quiet.

Fin is a Chinese restaurant, but it is probably a more Americanized interpretation (based on what we had here).  They were doing a $40 3-course special.  There was a good variety of starters to choose from while there was not much selection among the entrees or the desserts.  We all opted for the 3-course.  We added some a la carte dishes to share as well.

I started with the barbecued spare ribs.  They were sweet but not overly sweet.  The ribs could have used something else to give them a little more kick.  The meat did not have a fall-off-the-bone texture.  The meat was not exactly tough, but it could have been more tender.

I did not try the shrimp and scallop wraps, but they looked bland.  I tried the crispy shrimp toast that was served on a sweet and sour sauce.  That starter was decent.

For my entree, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass that was served over a sweet garlic sauce.  The sea bass came with a side of steamed white rice.  The sea bass was fried (the menu said wok fried, but it seemed to be more deep fried).  The sea bass was quite greasy.  It was also incredibly fishy, which was a little odd because sea bass typically does not have one of the stronger fish tastes.  It could have been because it was not that fresh or simply that the fish flavor became more pronounced in how they fried it.

I really did not like the fish.  The greasiness and the taste made me feel a little queasy and I can eat pretty much anything.

From the a la carte menu, we had the General Tsao's Chicken, which was served with broccoli.  This dish was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and tasty while the sauce was both sweet and with some good heat.

We also had Shrimp Lo Mein noodles, which were okay.  The noodles were fine and seasoned properly.  The shrimp was plump; however, they were not cooked long enough.

For dessert, I opted for the assorted sorbet, which had 3 flavors.  There was lychee and blood orange.  I cannot remember the other flavor.  Only the blood orange had a good flavor.  The other two flavors were bland.

The sorbet here was all ice.  It was like eating a really frozen slushie.

The other dessert option was a vanilla creme brulee and it was much better.  The vanilla custard was smooth, creamy and had a good vanilla flavor.  There was a nice caramelized shell.  The creme brulee was garnished with fresh berries.

They finished us off with a complimentary Baileys shot, which was good, and a fortune cookie.  The fortune cookie was pretty good.  It was a little thicker and more buttery than most fortune cookies I've had.  The messages seemed homemade especially since the paper appeared to be cut with scissors.

Service was not that good.  I have heard that strong customer service is not a high priority at Chinese restaurants (more emphasis is placed on flavors and value).  Maybe this place was trying to emulate that even though it seemed to be an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The waiter seemed confused and he left the table when we were ordering to check up on another table.  Other servers seemed a little bit abrupt.

Still, once we put the order in, the food did come out at a good and organized pace.

Of the ""nice"" Las Vegas restaurants I have tried, Fin may be the worst one.  The General Tsao's Chicken and creme brulee were both good.  For the other dishes we had though, I think you would be able to get just as good food (if not better food) at one of the P.F. Chang's nearby (and at a much lower price).  There are many Vegas restaurants to avoid and Fin would definitely be among them.

The Mirage has complimentary parking (both valet and a parking structure).",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,18,18,2,Aoht_-tB-TkqrBpYyZQDoA

2018309,2008-04-27,2,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"my editor and i were trying to grab dinner after a long work trip day and on our way to see the cirque love show at the mirage. so, we arrive, a little braindead and with seemingly a few options. a sushi place that looked more like a bar, a nicer italian restuarant with an uninspired menu, or Fin. 
i was immediately attracted to the joint for two reasons: i'm a sucker for modernist design and this place looked gorgeous; and because it was completely closed off from the smokey, loud, flashy casino. oh, and the third reason was that there were normal menu items (fried rice, wonton soup) along with more culinarily advernturous stuff (clay pot brisket) for a reasonable price - even for vegas.
after being assured by the hostess that we could get in and out in an hour to make our showtime, we entered the soothing, blue/silver somewhat water-inspired decor of Fin. it was quiet, with the sound of flowing water and fresh liliy on the table - just what we needed after a long day.
service was excellent. the entire staff was chinese and were the epitome of polite, fast and eager to please. we had a few questions about the dishes and our waiter dutifully steered us toward two dishes he thought we might like - and warned us of the more ""different"" dishes that take a more adventurous pallete.
the foor was damn tasty. i settled on fried rice with dried scallions and egss whites and it was flavorful without being greasy. we also ordered a chicken noodle dish that was pretty standard....no i take that back, ""standard"" chinese food always tastes too salty to me, and this was not, but i didn't love it. the wonton soup was fantastic, and the egg roll appetizer came out pre-cut into six bite-size pieces, perfect.
oh - we also received two complimentary items. after we ordered, they brought out a small serving (a soup spoonful) of pickeled...something. anyway is interesting - clean and vinegary but not overwhelming. also, we were offered a dessert menu, but we declined and they still brought us a nicely presented fortune cookie (i am not a fortune cookie fan, but this was delicious!! buttery and fresh, not rock hard and crumbly) and shot of bailey's cream.

The only reason that I gave this a 4 star review is that the menu prices seem a little extreme for the type of food. However, that is typically the range that you will find in any large resort on the Las Vegas Strip.

Fortunately, I purchased a fixe prix meal via travelzoo. For $59 we received a 4 course meal for two with wine - and it was more than reasonable. I highly recommend purchasing something like this, if at all available.

My husband and I each had the shrimp and pork wonton soup. It was very good, warm, and just the right sized portion.

As an appetizer, my husband had the lettuce wraps. The filling was very flavorful and the lettuce slices were cut into the perfect size so that they could be enjoyed without the mess. I had the pan-seared pork pot sticker which were also incredible. Either choice will leave you satisfied.

For dinner we each enjoyed the Mongolian Beef which was perfectly seasoned and was served with a bed of white steamed rice. Other choices available were a Chilean Sea Bass, Kung Pao Chicken and a few others.

Dessert for us was the Vanilla Brulee, perfectly cooked with a nice crunchy caramalization, topped with some fresh berries.

At the end of the meal, each guest is presented with their Vegas themed fortune cookie and a small Bailey Liqueur palate cleanser.

The drink called The Bubbly Dragon, didn't bubble and tasted like straight grapefruit juice with a strawberry (still half green) stuck in it.

Next the spring rolls (3 cut in half to appear more) were similar to the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store except they were thinner.  My egg drop soup was thin like wonton soup and had very little flavor.

My husband only eats vegetable fried rice.  Very tiny chopped vegetables and the rice was not fried.  Again our waiter had attitude when we requested soy sauce and black pepper.

The Sea Bass also had a great flavor and any tofu bowl is tasty.  The Stewed E Fu noodles were a little bit over sauced but still yummy.

The bill came out to about 55-60 per person.  That's definitely expensive for Chinese.  But I don't think you can argue that food here is bad.  

Basically what you're paying for is the service and decor.  Let's face it - You don't go to a chinese restaurant to get good service.  Sometimes the service you receive is outright rude.  It's not a stereotype - it's the truth and I'm Chinese. 

This place is beautiful and the service is akin to a fine dining establishment.

But a fine dining chinese restaurant will never be able to stand on its legs when compared to fine dining Italian, French, and other cuisines.  If you can chop and stir fry 80% of the entrees in minutes, it's hard to argue ---  Fine dining Chinese is at a disadvantage.

We ordered veggie spring rolls, which came with two sauces. One was horseradish, which I didn't realize til it burned my tongue. The spring rolls were just meh. They had a weird kind of taste, almost like fish, so didn't appeal to this vegetarian. 

I got the veggie lo mein and my friend got the garden vegetable stir fry. They came out and hers was chicken. She sent it back and got the right dish. The garden veggies was mostly huge pieces of bok choy, with some broccoli and beans, and like 1 carrot. It didn't look appealing at all. My lo mein didn't even have any broccoli in it.

They bring you a fortune cookie at the end with a shot of a creamy pistachio liquor. This was the highlight of the meal!! The fortune cookie tasted homemade. It was really light.

3487670,2009-11-24,1,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"Probably one of the better Asian cuisine places in Vegas. Lushly decorated in a modern Asian-cityscape mix. They have some mountain paintings along some walls, with drapes of glass bubble beads around. There's a fresh orchid table piece on every table, and has chopsticks as part of the table setting. However, this being a fancy restaurant, everything is fancied up.

Their menu seems to be more suited for Americans but the taste still suggests Asian cooking, which I think is awesome. All the dishes were made from fresh ingredients and served piping hot. The fried rice was very well done, but needed a tiny bit more flavor. A dash of pepper totally fixes it though. My parents enjoyed it though, being the light flavor lovers. My dad also orders this lamb dish, which I'm not sure if it's even on the menu. It's like a rack of lambs, but was amazingly done. Was the best lamb I had ever had(and I hate lamb because of how gamey it is usually). The rest of the dishes I don't remember too well. I don't remember any dishes being below average. It was a pretty fulfilling experience. The fortune cookie and Bailey's shot was superb. The fortune cookie was soft, sweet, and savory in a way. Possibly fresh baked. The Bailey's shot seemed different than the type that comes out of the bottle. They could possibly have altered it. Felt creamier or sweeter. They paired the fortune cookie and the Bailey's shot quite well.

In Vegas, price doesn't matter. Don't eat here if you're keeping track/limiting of your spending. All in all, great food here. One of the two Asian cuisine places(not including Japanese) I'd eat at in Vegas, aside from the buffets.",bM1jMFJp2T7RvVfVp4GmrQ,2,3,4,QQ0CLGcOrPDcXNg5THQ-yQ

FOOD: we ordered from the Prix Fixe menu (which they keep well-hidden; it's on the Mirage website, but when you are at the restaurant, if you didn't ask for it you wouldn't know that it existed).

He shows up with the bottle, and is obviously about to open it when I point out that we have regular wine glasses, not champagne flutes. Off he goes. 10 more minutes pass. He returns with the flutes, opens the bottle and proceeds to pour the wine like soda into my wife's glass - it foams up, losing all the bubbles. I had to show him that you tip the glass at an angle, then gently pour the champagne into the glass, to retain the effervescence. He also forgot that we were having a dessert.

I am perfectly fine with going to an affordable chinese place, so going to a 'fine dining' chinese restaurant was not my usual cup of tea.

haha My dad did not know what to do with the pickled vegetables on a soup spoon starter. He emptied the spoon of the vegetables and saved the spoon for his soup. I guess it is there to cleanse your palate.

Won ton soup by the bowl? We'll share, thanks.
The crab and corn chowder had more corn than crab so it was really sweet. I added some white pepper to balance out the flavor.

The pan-fried noodles were good, the stir-fried mixed vegetables were only okay, I have had better mongolian beef, and the barbecued duck was decent.

I got the prix fixe menu.  You automatically get egg drop soup but then you have choices.  For my appetizer, I ordered pot stickers, my main course selection was Kung Pao chicken, for rice I got the vegetable fried rice, and for dessert I got the mango pudding.

The egg drop soup was good but it needed some salt--at least for me.  There are no salt or pepper shakers on the table and I was OK eating it as it was.  It was a good soup with some small pieces of small broccoli florets.  That was great for texture.  The pot stickers were very good and the sauce served with them was a winner.  The Kung Pao chicken was good.  A good amount of chicken, quite a few peanuts, and a few red peppers but not enough to give the dish much zing.  It's not supposed to have zing so it was made properly.  Portion size was good but not I need a take out box size.  The fried rice was a whole bowl of individual grains of rice, fluffy and tasty.  Finally, the mango pudding for dessert was great!  It stole the show.  The pudding had fresh chunks of mango on it.  What a good way to end the meal.

Service was very good throughout the evening.  I never had less than a half glass of iced tea when a server was there to refill it.  The pace of the meal was good.  The only thing about service that I would fault was the lack of removing empty Sweet 'n Low packets from the table.  Cleaning paper like that off a table when you come to add more iced tea or clear dishes should be a no brainer.  I was surprised that a restaurant like this would have that down pat, but they don't

Of course it's not fast food or convenience food pricing, so if you are seeking a meal for 2 for 20$ you'll probably be disappointed; however compared to the other options in The Mirage this was reasonable. When I dine out I like to have sit down service and this fit that need although our server talked low and unclearly. The server also seemed annoyed or kind of put out for some reason. The restaurant was not busy when we were there and we were one of the first tables seated upon them opening for dinner. We also didn't have any special requests and were pretty straightforward in our ordering so we didn't do anything that I'm aware of to have an annoyed server. We were not intoxicated, loud, or demanding; so the general vibe from the server seemed unfounded. None of the servers seemed to be happy or to have a smile on their faces so perhaps that's part of the ambiance (?). Also this was early in the evening and we were eating before seeing a show. 
The food tasted great and had decent sized portions. Each entree was about 20$. Two of us dined and including the tip our 2 entrees, one regular (non-alcoholic) beverage, and side of rice were around 60$ total and that's with giving around an 18% tip. 
The servers were good about keeping our waters filled but we had to flag them down for any extras as it seemed like they were aware we needed something yet avoided making the connection unless flagged down. 
The ambiance was quiet, intimate, and could be romantic if that's what you seek. The decor was modern which I find pleasing. They left the doors open and even in the back part of the restaurant you could still hear the noise of the slot machines so I would imagine that the seating closer to the doors would be much worse as far as slot machine noise.

We arrived at the restaurant at about 5:30pm, after visiting the Dolphin Habitat and Secret Garden at the Mirage (which was excellent). We did not have reservations but we were seated right away. Our waiter was very courteous and fast with our drinks and appetizers. 

We decided on the spare ribs to start. We got 4 small ribs on a plate, complete with hot wet towels to dry the bbq sauce off our messy hands. Now the ribs were pretty small compared to take-out ribs, but the meat coming off these ribs was plentiful and more than you'd get at a take-out place. So it was like small bone, LOTS of meat. We were thrilled and they were very delicious.

For the main course, we both decided on the mongolian beef. We were warned that it would be just a bit spicy, but we didn't care. We could handle it. It was spicier than I thought it would be but it really was one of the best chinese dinners I have ever had. It was mixed with many vegetables that were equally great. 

We skipped on the dessert but we were greeted with fortune cookies that we were told are freshly made everyday. Tasted like vanilla, and much tender than take-out cookies. Great message too which gave me luck and fortune at Caesar's Palace that night. 

I highly recommend FIN if you want an affordable Chinese restaurant on the strip who knows how to treat you, no matter if you get the cheapest or most expensive thing on the menu. First class all the way.",Tlz7fq7X9S-vH7tOSVpNew,0,0,5,NYZn5ZGBcGvCWIi3CkXrpg

It caught my attention as I've never been to such an elegant and beautifully decorated Chinese restaurant. All my experiences with Chinese food were casual places in Poland (I mostly liked them). Such food is probably Europeanised and has little to do with traditional Chinese dishes. I thought that what they offer in Fin would be closer in taste to the ""original"". So we gave it a try.

The decor was truly beautiful, very elegant and relaxing. But (and I say that about every restaurant in Vegas hotels) it was so dark that we barely saw the menu. The staff was prompt and professional but to call them nice or even pleasant would be probably too much. Also the waiter wasn't happy when I asked what was the difference between lo main and chow main. But he probably gets that a lot. We decided on crisp shrimps on fried toast, chicken chow main, dried scallop fried rice and some drinks. The shrimps were very good, a bit too oily but otherwise tasty, especially the strawberry-colored sauce. Yummy! The dried scallop fried rice was ok (according to my fiancé) and my dish wasn't bad either, just not great - it had too much (soy?) sauce and was a bit bitter. Drinks were good too, lots of alcohol :). Prices average for Vegas. 

To sum up, we had a good time but the food wasn't anything special, just good. Worth checking out but it won't ever be one of my favorite places.",l4hRcfkhlbC38aCC2UN1mA,4,5,3,TrvZXb9rqxOhJrG8THAQxg

The staff was very accomodating, except for the waitress who refused to take our photo at the meal's conclusion (citing poor eye sight - but I have my doubts!). 

The food was delicious, although a bit high-priced for high-end Chinese food that tasted very similarly to much cheaper alternatives. You pay for the ambiance, the service, and if you ordered the higher end dishes, I'm sure you'd get fabulous food as well. I had the Vegetable Egg Rolls, the Vegetable Fried Rice, and some of my husband's Mongolian Beef. All very good, just nothing super-exceptional.

The only other problem is that the portion sizes are quite large. This would normally be wonderful, except in a town like Las Vegas where most people are vacationing without a fridge/microwave leftovers become more of a hassle than a gift and the excess food goes uneaten.

We had such high hopes that this would be our next big ticket Chinese restaurant to replace one of our favorites - Chinois by Wolfgang Puck, but alas, save your money and go to PF Chang's - you'll get better food there all the way around without paying so much for the so-so food.  Got there early when they opened (they were late opening for a 5PM reservation start time, which is irrupting as we had tickets to The Beatles Love and was trying to pace ourselves 2 hours to eat and get to the show in The Mirage.  We ordered the BBQ Rib appetizer - usually a favorite for us, but these were just awful.  I can' find anything really to recommend about these except they were a good size - you got four - but the sauce - was tasteless and the meat wasn't well prepared - way to tough to chew - again PF Chang's - a lesser experience - has way better ribs and probably for a fraction of the cost.  I don't mind paying top dollar for a great dining experience but we're already in trouble with appetizers.  The soup - Crab and Corn soup was also nothing exciting - just average tasting.  For main dish we had always order two items - Usually one beef and one chicken...for chicken we had the Kung Pao Chicken - this was actually the best item we ordered...had we found a better appetizer and soup and a better beef item - we might have upped this another star, but this alone wasn't worth the money we spent on this food.  For the beef, we went with the SIGNATURE DISH - Beef Tenderloin with the black pepper sauce.  You have the choice of Black Pepper or Orange Sauce - that may be a misprint in the menu - as you don't actually get any sauce - they just cook a really cheap piece of beef and put pepper on it - it was tough as nails and probably the worst piece of tenderloin beef I've ever eaten.  Sitting on a bed of some sort of julienned veggies that weren't edible - just a really nasty dish - and for this you'll be paying $45+ dollars for this ""signature"" dish.  Usually a signature dish is something so special, it's worth the extra money - save your dollars folks - there's probably a dozen or so terrific steak houses in Vegas that will make you a great steak meal for this price - this is NOT one of them - dried, tasteless and in general a major disappointment.

4826380,2012-01-10,0,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"We shopped around for a good place to eat in vegas for our first wedding anniversary, and since we were staying at the mirage, we decided on fin.  

the place is beautiful! Thats about all I liked about it. and even as I got to looking at the intricate wall designs and decor, i noticed how dusty and dirty it was. 

The waiter hovered over us while we decided upon what to order, which was odd and awkward.  He wasnt very communicable or friendly. 

We split two entrees, vegetable lo mein, and an appetizer- we got the pot stickers, general tso's chicken and kung pao chicken.  They brought all of the food together, not as appetizer followed by entrees.  

The potstickers (all 4 of them for $12) were nice and crispy on the outside, but the pork filling was rubbery and not very flavorful.  The sauce for the potstickers wasnt very good either- ive had better potstickers with sauce at the local $5.99 all you can eat.

The entrees were ok.  Both could have been spicier, but again, I am from Louisiana, so I may be a bit biased on that end. A few peices of the chicken were gristley and I had to spit it out in my napkin.  

I also had ordered a glass of rieslinhttp://www.yelp.com/guidelinesg which was very skimpy! Good, but no more than 1/3 full for $11.

rice doesnt come with the entrees. a small bowl of rice is $2 extra.

Then, the pushy photographer came in to take pictures of us, and then a while later, came back in to try to sell us $50-$144 photo packages, ugh.... 

to finish, we had fortune cookies which looked hand made, complete with hand clipped fortunes that looked like they were printed on an inkjet printer.  they also brought a bailey's after dinner drink, which tasted like baileys with some whole milk. tasty, small. 

overall, I was disappointed. the chinese buffet by my house it better tasting, and PF Changs will give you better service/ambiance and food!!  I just dont find the hospitality in vegas very good like it is in the south!",Hx7PHdn0mLerdZ_DX5wZTQ,0,0,2,dCRZgXQl-DxEU5uvZgJqiQ

4958062,2017-11-24,1,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"Had a strong dinner a Fin on a Thursday evening, but it was not without its issues.  We had reservations but the place was not crowded.  Once you're inside the restaurant it is a bit of an oasis from the casino, I could only faintly hear the slot machines and people.  It is also very dark, so be advised if you or someone in your party has poor eyesight.

We were approached immediately by a server to take our drink orders.  The wine list is nothing special, particularly when compared to some of the behemoth wine lists on the strip, but it got the job done.  Prices are commensurate with what you would see at a typical Vegas strip restaurant.

To start, we went with the ""Taste of Fin"" appetizer platter.  They can make this to suit the number of people in your party.  Each one of us got (in my order of preference) a rib, chicken wing, crab rangoon,  potsticker, and egg roll.  The sampler is a very good idea, but all of us wanted more of the ribs and chicken wings.  The ribs are sticky with a sweet BBQ sauce.  They aren't fall off the bone tender, but they certainly weren't tough.  The chicken wings were fantastic as well.  Crispy with a very flavorful sauce.  Of the 5 these are likely the only ones I would order again.

For our entrees, the table shared (again in my order of preference):  half of a peking duck, general's chicken, pork fried rice, and Neptune's crispy noodle seafood.  The peking duck is prepared tableside and served on bao buns.  The duck has all of the qualities you are looking for in duck:  crispy skin, juiciness, and flavor.  It was very good.  Each diner only gets one bao bun, then they carve the rest of the duck and put it in the center of the table.  This caused some issues, as nearly every bite of duck had a bone in it.  It was a very rough carve.  And, given how dark it was, you couldn't tell if you were getting a bite with bone until you bit down on the bone.  I would order this again, but you need to be mindful.

The chicken had some heat but was not overwhelming.  The chicken and veggies were perfectly prepared, nothing was overcooked or tough.  The pork fried rice was good as well, but not as memorable as the duck or chicken.  The seafood did not land with any of us.  The sauce was a bit bland and the fried noodles were not good.  I wouldn't order this again.  However, the seafood was prepared properly.

While Fin had some misses the meal was definitely more good than bad.  I would eat here again on a future Vegas trip.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,3,4,-BhIG8nfOo4c8JLujslyKw

The decor is beyond gorgeous!  Beautiful glass baubles hanging all over the room, a giant silver horse, sheer painted screens, painted mountain landscapes, and very nice private dining rooms as well.  It is pretty quiet and relaxing, even though there is a sea of slots in front of it.

We started with the egg drop soup, which was very light and not salty.  We also ordered the pot stickers, which were very light and tasty.  They are so cute-you get 6 mini ones.  I could have gone for a touch more vinegar in the sauce that comes with, but was good nonetheless.   We also had the Mongolian beef, which was delicious, tender, and full of flavor, and the bbq pork and shrimp fried rice-nice dish, not greasy, I just wish it had a little more shrimp in it.  The dessert we had, some kind of fried banana with a banana cream 'dip' was just alright.  I've had better desserts like that before.  It was very rich and the batter a little on the heavy side.  They also presented us with a tiramisu-like cake with a candle for my birthday, which was light and fluffy....And then there was the fortune cookie...the best of the desserts.  Homemade, semi soft cookie with a nice fortune inside served alongside a shot of Baileys.  We were so full! 

For such a posh place to eat in Vegas that isn't terribly expensive in general, but a little pricey for Chinese, I think it's worth the trip.  All our food, dessert, and 1/2 bottle of wine was $100 including tip.  Staff is very nice, I didn't need to ask for a thing!

Definitely not too shabby for Vegas!

Typically speaking, Chinese Food and Fresh, Light, and Delicious don't all go together, but at Fin, we indulged in plenty of food, and left feeling full but not stuffed, and like what we ate was fresh.

I know fresh can be hard to understand, but what I mean by that was all of the ingredients were the finest possible, and you could tell they were all top notch. Nothing was greasy or heavy or weighed down - it was all cooked the way I could only hope to eat Chinese food but rarely happens: Guilt Free. 

While it is a bit pricey, you get what you pay for in service and quality, and to be honest, it wasn't unreasonably priced. 

If you have a group - reserve one of the private party rooms - super chic and awesome looking for a special event.",sBf5IfUPxTowTdUebPZVTQ,1,0,5,ZzyAqtScnmEVrihEs1eMng

Maybe it went down 2 days later because it wasn't as fresh?  Anyway, given the controversy behind shark fin soup, I don't think anyone should be eating it.  May have to report them to my friends at PETA...

Actually a little overzealous with the water refills (we had bottled water and they refilled our half empty glasses with tap water and charged us for the bottled water anyway.  Sorry, but that's a NYC no-no.)  The wonton soup was great.  One of my dining companions had a crab and corn soup, she later had food poisoning.    Fried rice got good reaction.  I had the shrimp pan fried noodles, which were great, JB had the Singapore style noodles which he loved.  Overall everyone was very happy with their meal pre-food poisoning, if not with the price.  

You can do the same, if not, much better in Chinatown on Spring Mountain  for a lot less money.  Yes, the decor is beautiful, but you can probably decorate your own space with the money you save dining elsewere.

Although a diner in a compact wheelchair was able to be seated, it was a very tight fit and other diners had to be disrupted to be able to get this person seated.  I wouldn't recommend for wheelchairs.",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,0,0,2,3QSl-552Rvh_SIlGVkz7vg

5793279,2013-05-19,1,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"My review of Fin is pretty much the same as all of the other Yelpers. I found Fin to be a bit pricey for Chinese food, and the staff is very overly incredibly attentive. If you take a sip of water, someone is there to refill it for you. 

The food is good, though, there's no doubt about it. I ordered the stir-fry chicken and was very satisfied. They also follow up your meal with a delicious house made fortune cookie and shot of Baileys. 

The ambiance is fantastic if you sit toward the back and can block out the chachings of the nearby slot machines. 

Highly recommended for a nice dinner as long as you're aware of the price and overly attentie service staff.",R1xxRcTY3RpfDtGjisYEjg,0,0,3,fbfhDZYKbgbpw4m3hVk1aw

There is really nothing terrible with the restaurant except the fact that it is supposed to be above and beyond the Chinese takeout food from down the street. The only positive thing I can say is the restaurant decor and setup is pretty cool. I would recommend saving your money for a better Vegas dining experience.",cLFj8o3aVZKi08gwBYe5Rw,0,0,2,QDUDlvQZkPGuUWJ4X37ixg
5973019,2013-07-05,0,GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g,"FIN is basically a PF Changs only not quite as good and twice as expensive.  I liked the atmosphere though and the service was good and portions respectable so, they get 3 stars.  

We started with the shrimp toast appetizer and it had nice plump shrimp on top of that crispy fried toast one expects and sat in a just ok layering of sweet and sour sauce on the plate.  My son got the General Tsao's Chicken and I got Mongolian Beef.  Again, both were good but not great, especially considering the prices.  The cocktail I ordered however was great with a lot of Grey Goose vs. mixer.  Nothing watered-down about this drink!

In a good foodie town like Vegas, you have to really bring it to get more than an A-OK Yelp rating and FIN only makes it to the ""good"" range.",33v8c5ftrKuDGTw1ZQ2toQ,2,0,3,mDZSutetR_GyNvyuvqp5UQ
