Which is surprising because of all of the Arby's locations I'd say it is the best by far. Great service, quick and polite. The food is always piping hot and very fresh/tasty.

I'd definitely recommend to check this place out and order anything, it's all good.",QGxqWdgZLPzdzu30DhhDog,0,0,5,gCXxmoma-13vkS5mR1oOLg

The place is clean but dated. Which seems to be changing as they have signs up warning about some contruction work.
I have gone to this location many times as it is super close toy home. I have never had the experience the last reviewer had. 
This is a food chain I feel bad for as they never seem to be very busy. But the food is different and good. Not just a McDonald's clone",Tr1ulYYAHAw5FzEQQwZEJQ,1,0,5,5Cp3EwhtIFixmEpZHil91Q
2013549,2015-05-19,0,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,I used to like this place but they have let their quality slip. My family has experienced stale bread on their sandwiches. I have had stale buns on my roast beef more times than I want to count. Their potato cakes are not good anymore. I didn't even enjoy the curly fries which I got this time. Even the roast beef isn't as good anymore. I guess I'm done with this place for a while.,d7BFzGGsXr9TrNID5RL3QA,3,0,2,ucJIEOs7oAfsLWlj7ayxyQ

On top of all that the drive thru is the slowest I have ever seen, even when there's only a couple cars it takes a good 15 minutes to get thru... avoid this one at all cost!!!!",x3azRbv5vtqywPaGmSkVdg,1,0,1,ZMnaTdiM27GGQOUbN2GupQ
3324566,2017-04-22,0,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,"March 28, 2017: This is an update. I am updating them to 5 stars. I spoke to Helen the manager. Helen took care of the complaint. Per Helen's offer, I ate at this location on March 28, 2017 in the evening. Gina the supervisor was not there because if she was, then I would not go. The employees who were there, were all very nice. I recognized that they all were trying to be helpful and wanted to make sure my order was correct, even the cook in the back. 
This Arbys location deserves 5 stars. Thank you Arbys Las Vegas on Rancho Dr.!",AQKkGFBJUjr-7a6T43bo3Q,0,0,5,0bfJ6FVjlG4zV6dRko55FQ
3461339,2015-09-12,1,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,"Worst experience ever. I will avoid this location forever. First they allow me to order a chocolate turnover but don't have any. We waited 10 minutes (in the drive-thru) for the order. While sitting in the car we noticed a foul sewer/sulfur smell. Had to roll up the windows!! Then finally getting our order the cheese on the slider wasn't even melted. Handed it back to the employee and all she did was have someone put it in the microwave wtf (I could of done that) I wasn't given a receipt, so I can't call and complain. When we got home to eat we noticed the new brisket sandwich was 30% grisly. Yuck! I'm done!",XjzBjb1VC8DP013vxE7o1g,2,0,1,B3Bka9nebpbEnESrwnVRKw

The manager will not do it,,I won't be going back to this place again so they list money from us.  Don't advertise if you can't honor it!!

3681566,2015-08-28,0,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,Wow!! This is the cleanest fast food restaurant I've been in this year. On a scale of one to ten for cleanliness I give them an eleven.

3868173,2017-07-12,1,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,"This Arby's is close to our house... the only reason we occasionally order from them. 

They enter your order on the computer... when you get home to eat the orders are always wrong. Order 4 sandwiches and get home and there's only 3. I have a cheese allergy and always order 'no cheese'... get home and sandwich covered with cheese. Order potato cakes... they forget to put them in the bag. We shouldn't have to open each sandwich at the counter before we take it home. 

Here's what really ticked off my husband... he ordered a corned beef sandwich and requested no sauce ... he got home and there was sauce and no sauerkraut ! 
What the heck is wrong with this Arby's???? 

I read the 11 reviews on this place and most of them were the same complaints ... obviously the owner doesn't care as if he did he would address these Yelp postings.",YAur8kRg_1_k3JFPdZUNXQ,1,0,1,HV0BZVzLv2QSOQOV4Y7vOQ
3889929,2018-04-20,0,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,"Arby's is one of my go-to fast food establishments to grab a quick bite to eat especially since 2 for 1 coupon are available on a monthly basis in the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

One of my favorites is the 2 for 1 French Dip special for $7.00 to which I usually add a large order of curly fries and that is what I purchased during my most recent visit here and the food was extremely tasty as well nice and hot as usual. 

This is my preferred Arby's location and service always has been consistently quick and good, most likely because there always is an experienced manager (as in adult!) on site. Another Arby's location that I visit occasionally at 1465 W. Craig Road usually does the slow roll with customer service, especially after your order has been placed.

The current no-coupon-needed special of 2 Greek Gyros (pronounced ""yeeros"" with no distinction between singular or plural) is also worth looking into and will likely be the next item that I purchase.",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,5,ObH7eApgfuSQ5ZNkEO6I5Q

5526238,2015-12-29,0,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,"Usually love Arbys but this was a nightmare.  I honestly thought I was gonna crack my tooth on one of the fries!!! I didn't know that was even possible. My 2 year old daughter has never turned her nose up at a french fry and she didn't get past the first bite either.  These were not ur regular sit under the heat lamp for too long fries.  These were yesterday's fries scooped from a dumpster, thrown in a bag, and handed to me as if it wasn't a mockery of the time honored tradition of deep fried potatoes.  Good. Mood. Food. The sandwiches were at least (fingers crossed) from that day but definitely spent a few too many hours under the lamp.  Before I get too sanctimonious...I will acknowledge that I do love Arbys and I should throw them a good review from one of the other locations.  It will be glorious and remind me that even if the whole world has gone to hell I can still enjoy one of lifes simple pleasures. Bun. Roast Beef. Bun. Horsey and Arbys sauce as needed.  How hard is that slackers at Craig and Rancho Arbys?  Trust me, you don't want to look back on your Arbys career and wonder if u gave it everything you had!!!

5898639,2016-09-06,0,njAKI1RSggY0Izay-xwJSw,"Just horrible food and I emailed Katie with no response on my experience ? The store was super clean but that can be good and bad as I think their serving old food as I been eating Beef and cheddars for 30 years and nothing ever tasted this bad !
They meat was falling apart almost crumbly with a mushy oatmeal texture ? Its should be sliced  and it didnt even taste like arbys ?
 I swear you could put that sauce and cheese on a shoe and it would taste great but not that slop .
Im down here from IL 6 months now and this is all there is for Arbys ? as this location is giving it a bad name so I guess Ill be calling corporate and hopefully they will fix your franchise or take it away . 
Dont know if its a preparation or quality issue BUT if you know Arbys quality and love their beef save your money because this isnt Arbys its cold slop on a stale bun .

UPDATE : I read other reviews and saw they had a broken meat slicer so thats why the crumble meat and other said the beef quality sucks so theres definitely something nasty going on there !",Fp4QLL5JSjoaH8IiAUiO-g,0,0,1,btPvyWEMnLVaEK80Uaupyw
