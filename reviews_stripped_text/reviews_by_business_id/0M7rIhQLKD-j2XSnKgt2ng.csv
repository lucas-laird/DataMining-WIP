489907,2014-12-17,0,0M7rIhQLKD-j2XSnKgt2ng,"The woman managing the morning shift when I stopped by on Dec. 17 earned this 1 star, not any of the other employees who were far more competent and polite than she was. I was forced to leave without patronizing this establishment due to the utter ignorance and rudeness of this profoundly nasty woman.

I do believe the side items that were on the menu but were not prepared would have been so if the restaurant did not suffer from such poor management. I don't mind being refused a simple substitution on a buffet line of all things( where you have ample amounts of each item) but I cannot stomach a person on a power trip who is unqualified for their position. I left this place and went to Villa where I was treated with respect.",Iz1g0jEevehWoXCahQFkoQ,0,0,1,cNaDwNrMkxE3plkrmlYrEQ

The girl behind the food line was so rude and impatient when I asked questions about the entree menu, like she couldn't be bothered.  $15 for a plate of lousy spaghetti with meatballs and a side of veggies, but that would have been tolerable if she had been pleasant.  She was just as rude to the woman next in line.  And here is the height of wishful thinking on their part: after the lousy service, there was a tip jar sitting out there at the check-out register, as if I would give them one red cent for their horrible attitudes.  Sbarro should make a policy that workers should not yak with each other in Tagalog when others present don't speak the language - it' just plain RUDE.",DnMYQDDWpuMLNSIH9NXPuA,0,0,1,TzXKqGArnvmzq8jLiqPOXA

This is when you're caught between a Sbarro and a Burger King and on this particular day I really didn't have it my way so after contemplating just doing without I realized I was flying Southwest and they have nothing but a carbo snack basket and if I grabbed a slice of pizza worst case I could just eat the toppings so I did, yes it was horrible pizza but the service was very good and they did have a fresh right out of the oven pizza being sliced up when I joined the short line. I was also fortunate enough to find a small dirty table next the the exit only a short walk from my gate.

Sbarro pizza is generally predictable. What can you really expect from a food court? I do enjoy the large slices, though that's what I expect when they charge you the price of half a large pizza.

And sometimes when you do that, you will discover that the terrible Sbarro you grew up with at your local mall was in fact a superb and splendid culinary experience compared to what the Las Vegas airport offers by way of Sbarro.

I only had 50 minutes and I barely got there in time to line up with my section even though this was on the way. 

I ordered a slice of supreme even though I wanted pepperoni. The guy in front of me ordered the last three slices for his family. How annoying! 

Pros: 
-It was relatively quick and the pizza was edible. 

Cons: 
-Did not have more pepperoni or cheese pizza ready to go, but had plenty of the less popular flavors.
-Barely any pizza sauce on my pizza. 
-Crust thicker than I'd like it to be for NY style pizza.
-Pizza didn't seem as fresh and warm and other chains.

I asked if there was something they could replace it with and she looked at me and said with an attitude what do you want.

After 3 min of them talking she came back and said it would have to be another side or I'd have to pay for the slice. I told the girl that we didn't want another side because we weren't sure if they were done and I mentioned that my wife had already ate some with out knowing it was not cooked and she would most likely get sick.

Yep go home and stop sneezing on people's food.
