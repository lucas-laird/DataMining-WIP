However, I ordered 2 Grande Sausage burritos. This was by far the WORST sandwich I have ever eaten in a restaurant.

This is a ticking time bomb for salt. The sauce was over the top nasty. The eggs and sausage tasted terrible.

To top it off, about 2 hours later I am vomiting and have IBS type symptoms at work and have to make several runs to the restroom and try to stay the remainder of the day. I did call out on my night job so I can spend a couple hours in the restroom. 

I threw out the 2nd burrito, and only ate 3 bites of the first one. As nasty as it was, I did not eat dinner the night before and would have been willing to eat something that did not taste well, but this was just too overbearing.

I did the survey on the receipt, and demanded someone contact me. It has been 2 weeks and no contact.

To make it worse, calling the customer service number, they REFUSE to deal with customer complaints. Corporate will ask you if it is a store complaint, if you say yes, they simply say ""Go on the website"" and hang up without any negotiation skills.

This will be my last trip to Jack in the Crack. There are many other choices in Las Vegas, and all the others at least have someone willing to talk to customers. Other restaurants will not have me worrying about food poisoning.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,0,0,1,hnXP72G-WZfoIZ2csFBtkA

I asked for a croissant, add egg.  The drive thru worker says that the manager only allows for me to buy the supreme croissant, minus the meat.  This is a deceitful practice because you have to pay extra for what you aren't getting.  Almost double the price!

Then today I'm in the drive thru and the register in the drive thru window was reading my bank card. Mind you I've purchased inside with no problem with the same bank card. They said I have to park and go inside for them to ring it up at the other register because they were concerned with their drive thru window time. Really!?
