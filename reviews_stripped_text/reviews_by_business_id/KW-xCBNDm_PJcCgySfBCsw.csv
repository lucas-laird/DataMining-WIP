I ordered potato soft tacos and not only was I informed that my potatoes were going to be made fresh and not cold/hard, the tacos we're delicious. Inviting atmosphere and top notch service. Great job guys!",XUYDAVYao8Q0SGWgtDUXHQ,0,0,5,eY59sx0_N6tCphhzGkLT-A

I was impressed how with all the construction going on how clean this store is. The bathrooms were clean too from the night before. 

This location is so great that we have even seen police officers at this location. An individual can eat and not worry about anything happening, or if chaos does come knocking then the boys in blue are their to protect and serve. The food was nice and hot and ordered just the way ordered it. Thank you Taco Bell for making my morning less stressful and more yummy. They even had great attitudes for the morning which makes the day so much happier.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,0,0,5,vwYkjI-ndp1yyHQgcti7Hg
