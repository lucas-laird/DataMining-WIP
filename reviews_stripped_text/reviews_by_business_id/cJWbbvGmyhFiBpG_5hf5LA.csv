5586,2010-04-28,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"I. Am. A. Fan. This place is so much fun! The friends I was with had all been to the Hofbrauhaus before, so I was the only one who didn't know what to expect. We made a reservation for 8:30 on a saturday and walked right in when we arrived.

The first thing you notice is the HIIIIIGH ceilings and how loud it is. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, skip this place or sit in the room in the back which is much quieter, but you can still hear the music. Next time I go, I'd like to sit back there because it is made to look and feel like an outdoor garden seating area and it looked just lovely.

But this time we sat in the front room. The band played a mix of fun german singalong songs and american rock. They even played the  Star Spangled Banner and one point and everyone was singing. Very cool.

The prices were reasonable for a Vegas dinner. A friend and I split a sandwhich which was around $16 and the beer I had was $7.50. The more elaborate meals and larger beers are a bit more money, so plan on about a $30 meal.

Anyplace that let's me stand on the chairs (bench) to see the stage is OK by me!",92UySjdqhcGIiz5t1zmkfg,1,0,5,FwvvAfcXUmKzeFF2TSq-Kw

Cons:  Food is terrible.  No German Bread Basket.  Spaetzle was ""rubbery"", the sauerkraut had no flavor, the mustard was NOT typical German spicy mustard, the wurst plate was fair, the chicken lacked flavor. 

I came here three times to give it an honest review and tried multiple dishes...they claim it is ""just like the Hofbrauhaus in Munich""...not so...been at the Munich HB House and the food there is excellent.

58846,2009-07-29,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"This place is truly awful.  As a Las Vegas local I felt compelled to join Yelp.com to write this review.

Living in Las Vegas, I missed some of the small Midwestern German restaurants I used to frequent, so we went to Hofbrauhaus to try a little German food and beer.  Here's what we found:

*The beer was good, but $7.50 for a  1/2-liter?  Well- It is Vegas and they only have to get ya' once... but I'd MUCH rather spend $2 for a 23 oz. on-site microbrew at Ellis Island, and its less than 5 minutes away.  The place was half-full of European tourists - some of which thought $13.50 for a litre was a steal.

*They don't have a shot-ski (imagine a wooden ski with 5 shot glasses bolted down) or the stump (a great bar game involving a 4' stump, a square nail and a hammer) like they do at the Haufbrauhaus in other 'authentic' locations in the US!

*The hall is loud and echoey, but it's to be expected with 30' ceilings and tile floors.  The band is appreciated, but don't plan on carrying on a dinner conversation.

As for the meal...

*My girlfriend ordered the sauerkraut soup which she enjoyed and we we're then going to split an entree.  Then the 'sauerbraten' arrived:  $19 for 3 small pieces of dry, flavorless beef with bland brown gravy that tasted as if it was straight from a can.  There were two potatoe dumplings that tasted neither like potatoes nor dumplings.  They were ice-cream-scooped balls of gritty, mealy tastelessness covered with an unidentifiable blah crust.  Inedible.  A few pieces of over-cooked carrots and celery topped off this masterpiece.  It was truly the worst 'German-themed' (I won't call it German) food I've ever tasted.

I grew up in the restaurant business and eat dinner out 2-3 times/week.  I have never sent food back until this meal.  When we sent our food back the waitress was nice and we asked for her opinion of the food and she said that the owner had never let the servers try the food.  WHAT???  She said that she had tried a few things and didn't care for the food herself.  She told us that she had to get the manager to come to our table to take the meal off our bill and returned to collect the plate after a few minutes.  Expressing my opinion to the straight-from-Germany manager/owner was going to be the sweetest part of this meal, but our waitress returned with the bill sans the 'sauerbraten' and it was time to leave... We were getting hungry.",hu8RKdLzXKnYtYCRQND0FA,2,1,1,X1xfFHCBOGObFoE5SsBusQ

Both of our families have German families so I was excited to see what sort of place it was. We were seated shortly before we were expected (we had a reservation for 8 PM) and were seated in the dining hall. It was incredibly loud! At the end you fill out a survey and it asked if the music was too loud and I had to say that the crowd was too loud. Maybe it was just the time of night. The music that I did hear was not German (lots of recognizable party songs) and the entertainment was amusing.

My food was delicious! We split potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer) with salmon. I got the pork schnitzel and a side of spaetzle (my favorite holiday meal!). I wish that there had been a selecion of German wine but I did not see any on the menu. I spent more than I was expecting but it did taste good.

We were there for an early dinner, so the service was bit rushed since they weren't busy yet.  We ordered a pretzel for an appetizer.  I recall them being served warm.  This one was cold, so it was just OK.  After being asked several times, we ordered the Veal brats for dinner - it arrived within minutes, so it was all pre-cooked apparently.  This made me very glad we hadn't placed the order earlier.  The meal actually was delicious.  That was the best part of the evening.  What really put a damper on the evening, though, was ordering a shot at the end.  Don't order a shot unless you want a big welt on your butt!  We didn't realize this was the consequence.  On previous trips, members of our party had ordered a shot and did not get whacked.  This time, the staff was very eager and insistent about it.  I was very uncomfortable and was going to leave it (my boyfriend ordered the shot for me), but he finally drank it.  A server other than ours was instantly over and eager to deliver the punishment.  She was actually kind of mean about it and my boyfriend still has a welt on his behind 5 days later.  I guess they get a twisted satisfaction out of being mean to the people to leave them tips for slightly overpriced beer and food.  I was mad because he was really looking forward to going and ended up being in pain for the rest of the evening and the next day.

This place provides a fun party atmosphere where you can partake in fun German traditions and some new ones this place created, all put to loud German folk music.  If you are not much of a drunk partier, it might be over the top for you.  I don't really want to get spanked, sing songs with drunk people, try to hold up an oversized beer mugs until they drop, etc.  If you do, you will enjoy this place!

I've traveled all over Germany and this place mimics the fun beer halls of Bavaria.  I say mimic because it is fairly authentic but still a reproduction of the true festivals of Deutschland.

The food is very similar to that found in Germany but not quite as freshly prepared.  The flavors are good and most cater to the true meat eaters.  Almost all sausages and cutlets are worth trying.

But let's talk about the value.  A pint of beer costs $8 and their terrible Ice Tea almost as much (Germans don't know Iced Tea).  $20 for an entree, $6 for a salad, $1.50 for a slice of swiss cheese on the schnitzel, $2 for bread, and a whole host of other charges.  Basic food and beverages for 3 people was $78 before the tip.

Then there are all the tips.  Tip the waitress, tip the musicians (they even come around begging with their horns), tip the bathroom attendant that hands you a towell but can't keep the bathroom clean...geez, good thing I didn't valet!  You would never find this kind of pandering in Germany!  (Well, you do need to tip the bathroom attendants in Germany but at least they keep the bathrooms spotless during non-festival times.)

So, while there are good elements to this place, I don't recommend it.

If you are interested in an authentic German meal in a quieter setting, I recommend Cafe Old Heidelberg, with very authentic food (albeit, slow service) for a much better price.

The menu is large portions of mediocre food at inflated prices. The best part of my order was the side of french fries, which says a lot. 

It gets a star for the free beer chugging contest they put on, but besides that, the entertainment is very loud and distracting so that you can't have a conversation with your table. It is also not that amusing.

352203,2015-07-31,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Hofbrauhaus is a restaurant in Las Vegas that serves traditional and modern German food and beer.  I could tell that there was something different about this restaurant just by pulling up in the parking lot.  Three quarters of the parking lot is a wholly pointless valet lot.  I say pointless because the walk to the front door is pretty long, whether you park it yourself or not.  Choosing to valet will save you five steps....if you were able to choose.  A narrow catwalk wraps around the front of the building to the front door...not quite wide enough for two-way traffic.
Once you're through the front door, you'll find a nice small bar to the left, a gift shop to the right, and double doors to the main dining hall straight ahead.  Loud music and a pleasant smell of baked sour dough greets you as your busty server seats you next to rosy-cheeked strangers... who can't wait to meet you (so poetic).  The dining hall is a large cafeteria-style room with high vaulted ceilings and hardwood picnic tables complete with benches (be prepared to rub elbows with strangers).  Paintings and décor give a very authentic Bavarian feeling to the place.  The music is performed by a live polka band.  There was dancing, singing, beer mugs held high in the air, and then clanking together, patrons being spanked by server girls...wait, what?  You'll feel like you just walked into an Oktoberfest festival.
The dinner menu provides decent variety without sacrificing any authenticity.  For starters, I ordered the jumbo pretzel combo, which is a giant sourdough pretzel with course grained salt and comes with three dipping sauces...two types of mustard and a cold, spicy cheese spread.  I found the sauces to be good but the pretzel was too hard and heavy (but maybe it's supposed to be like that?).  For entrees, I had the rienbratwurst and my wife ordered the schnitzel sandwich.  The riesenbratwurst is about a nine inch pork sausage in a French bread hoagie with sauerkraut.  At first I thought it would be too bready as the sausage is only about one inch thin, but biting into it I found that it was pretty good.  The schnitzel sandwich is a large chicken breast pounded out flat, breaded and fried with tomato and lettuce on a large Kaiser roll, and we added Swiss cheese, it was quite delicious.  Both plates came with a large helping of decent thin-cut French fries.
The beer is limited in variety but not in volume or flavor, and is proprietary to Hofbrau.  You have six beer types to choose from: the Original (lager); the Dunkel (dark); the Hefe Weizen; the Oktoberfest; the Maibock; and the Hefe Weizen Dunkel.  Order a beer by the liter and it comes in a large glass mug designed to withstand a direct nuclear weapon strike.  I ordered the Hefe Weizen.  This was a fantastic beer.  Amber in color, cold, sparkling, and distinct fruity notes.  By the time I was half way through it, my previous criticism of the pretzel vanished.  Now I saw the purpose of the pretzel's heft...to stabilize the flux of beer in my stomach.
Overall, it was a great experience.  The level of social interaction can sometimes make you forget that they also have pretty good food.  But if you're not into German food, the experience of a Bavarian style beer festival alone (or the beer alone) will make it well worth the trip.",yhSsFJlY2J0vz0l3cBDtgw,0,0,4,6EOWh8XjyzIQ5YCbHlYKMg

Wonderful German festival songs permeated the air, as fellow diners (and us) swung our beers side to side, singing and chanting together.

This is basically the ""German experience"" of drinking and having fun with a little food thrown in. The beer hall smells terrible, like stale beer and sweat. Gross.

Now, on to the more important item. The service was so-so and my waiter tried to cheat me when we paid the bill. If you read nothing else in this review, read this - NEVER leave a cash tip if paying by card at this place! I charged our dinner, but left a cash tip and the waiter chased us down in the parking lot saying that he accidentally charged our card twice. This was a complete lie because while he went back inside with my card, I checked my bank app and it showed the exact amount I signed for on the receipt. He came back out a few minutes later and we went on our way. The next day I checked the bank and noticed the charge from the HB was for a higher amount and NOT the amount I signed for on the receipt. I called the HB and spoke to a very nice young lady in the accounting department who handled this whole mess after the fact. I sent her a copy of my signature and what do you know, it did not match the receipt. Hence, this waiter assumed I was a tourist visiting Las Vegas and not a resident, and he figured he could just steal from me and I wouldn't do anything about it. He took my generous cash tip and then tried to steal more money from me by charging my card for an second tip. It took nearly TWO WEEKS of my calling the HB to get the amount that I was owed refunded to me. This waiter committed fraud and, at the very least, should have been FIRED. That didn't happen. They told me that they've never had problems with him. Yeah, well, just because actual tourists don't complain when they sober up doesn't mean it isn't happening. He tried to steal from me and he'll try to steal from you too.

My overall suggestion is to avoid this place, but if you feel you just have to have the experience, pay with cash only.",55Ap3z9d95H3ASoh839OmA,6,1,1,e18R5N82t1sYEfw0A-eq4w

The place if far too loud when music is playing. I've been to the original HBH in Munich, which is loud, but the sound here dwarfs that. They have recaptured the loudness of a beer hall, but the music is overdone and makes conversation impossible. It really is loud enough already.

Everything was rushed and the place was pretty much empty. Guess the staff really hates staying late. Food was okay, but nothing spectacular. Our pretzel was hard as a rock. Almost inedible. I got this sausage sampler and most of the sausages were cold and tough and one had a bone fragment in it. The busser came and cleaned off our table before we had completely finished eating..extremely rude. We were told they were closing in 10 minutes and they made our dessert to-go. Overall, not the best experience regardless of whether or not it was before close. You don't want people coming in late, don't allow them to make reservations and then rush them through eating.

We ordered the special of the day- the goulash. It was AWFUL. It was just a bunch of meat slapped together with god knows what, then under, some sauerkraut. Now, I love all these ingredients-but how is this a goulash? The flavors (not that there were any...) just collided with each other, and overall it didn't work together. Plus it's very expensive for what they serve, and I had 2 small cups of diet coke (which they didn't bother to fill even the whole way) which they charge $3 for each!
How ridiculous!

513078,2017-04-19,7,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"I came here for my birthday after friends had recommended it for a family-friendly lunch spot a little outside of the strip. I was not informed that Hofbrauhaus celebrates birthdays differently than other restaurants. I was offered a shot of alcohol, which I initially declined, but after the waiter persisted and wouldn't let me say no, I accepted to take the drink. He then told me before I could try it, I had to pose with him at the next table over. I thought it was for a picture...but instead, the waiter put his hand on my back and pressed me to the table and I was slapped so hard with a wooden paddle (three times) that it echoed throughout the restaurant and I had visibly red welts on my ass (because I was wearing shorts at the time) for several days later. 

Initially I thought it was a joke, and so did my family and friends who were with me, but shortly after this incident the police and medical help were called because I couldn't sit down and was in incessant pain. I got an x-ray when I went to the hospital and it showed a very deep contusion to my tailbone. It's been several months since and I still can't sit down without a tailbone pillow and regular pain meds every single day.

Any other restaurant would have compensated the food, as we left mid-way through our meal when this happened because I was in so much pain. But no, the police that I'd called to report this incident told us that if we didn't pay (for the food we didn't eat and the beer we didn't drink) we'd be arrested for not paying our bill. So not only did we have to pay for everything, the drink that caused this WAS NOT COMPLIMENTARY, but the restaurant owner and waiter said this was done all in good fun. Hitting someone so hard they buckle at the knees and can't stop crying isn't in good fun. 

I was never informed that I was going to be hit. I never consented to being hit. I never thought celebrating my birthday could be turned into such a bad experience. This completely ruined my trip to Vegas because I was in so much pain and couldn't properly sit down for several weeks after. I would not recommend this sad excuse for a restaurant. The service is poor, the staff's behavior is crass and dangerous, and at least at the strip clubs you have to ask before you touch a woman (much less try to hit her).",NzM85MTn73QioaEltR42Wg,4,2,1,XVfgrbmq0kpWBhgrWTopDA
517030,2012-02-06,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"I lived in Germany for 6 years, and I love my German food. I know the owners put a lot of effort into the place, but I just can't dig it.

Hofbrauhaus Vegas is a great place to celebrate a birthday raucously. The Jaeger girls will gladly spank birthday boys, and the band usually makes the bachelorettes and birthday girls enjoy a special Alpenhorn (the things from the Ricola commercials) concert up close and personal. If you're up for fun and things that are supposed to be slightly embarrassing, this is the place. Just don't expect to have a conversation - the place echoes like the dickens.

The interior is a good replica of the original, but without the spurs of years of smoke and habitation. There walls are a warm color, and there's German-style painting near and on the ceiling. The stage plays host to German bands on the weekends. It's not unusual to see a few German couples dancing the Disco Fox to ""Living Next Door to Alice"" or ""Ein Bett im Kornfeld."" The band plays a mix of German and English pop, so don't be scared off by a few German titles.

The ""beer garden"" area doesn't echo as much, and it's a much more relaxed atmosphere. It's not actually outside, though, which is slightly disappointing.

Usually, the food is excellent, but at my most recent meal, the red cabbage, my favorite German food, was spicy, as if someone had added Siracha. I couldn't even eat it. Sad panda! The potato pancakes with salmon were excellent, and the salmon was fresh and sushi-quality.

There's valet parking, but most folks usually park across the street at Walgreens. Between the parking, the noise, and now the spicy red cabbage, I'd recommend other places.",OOflEjgmh5_rrbvOeJzStA,1,0,3,99QPWCNewn6XTiCLv0pDEA

However, if you have a free beer coupon, don't expect to get much, you still have to spend big money on a meal to get a 10oz beer. Yep, a little tiny beer, not one of those large mugs.

The food was ok. It was extremely salty. The beer was... well... beer. For sure wasn't worth $20 for a liter.  Oh, and if you want to drink it out of the ""das boot"", expect to pay even more, those boots are extra. (side note: my server mentioned the gift shop and told us that as servers, they're required to sell retail or they get fired.)

They do spankings. A full on spanking with a wooden paddle on the behind.  All you have to do is buy a shot. Crazy.  But OMG that s**t hurts!!  Those girls seem to have a lot of pent up aggression. The guys aren't too nice either. Expect a bruise for a souvenir.

This wouldn't be a helpful review if it didn't include the employees:
The host(s) look pissy.  Not very friendly and sure as hell didn't make the place feel welcoming.
The server(s) are sad.  They may smile at you and speak to you all positively and happy, but have you ever just people watched a server? The servers at this place walk around looking miserable.  They don't look happy. 
The random man standing against the wall. Seems important, but looks like a jerk. Doesn't smile, doesn't socialize, and looks like he's looking for something to go wrong. He was on his phone  the whole time except when he'd wander in and out of the kitchen.
The manager(s) are usually the easiest to find. The ones who hold down the fort. The one manager I noticed was a guy who seemed to run around frantically the whole night. He should have been the calmest of the entire bunch.

When you see this kind of DEPRESSING CHAOS in a business, you have to wonder where it's coming from. It doesn't just come from us customers.

I don't care what the acoustics in the building are, you can get sound that can be heard!

The band sounds good, but whenever a person speaks into the microphone it sounds so muffled and garbled its impossible to understand. If they correct that, the atmosphere will be even more party-like and would get much greater participation from customers. As it is, only a couple of tables nearest the stage can understand because they are closest to the stage monitors which are clear and crisp.

It would be nice if everyone, especially those who answer the phone, and the hostesses are informed of what is going on.

I planned to compete in their ""Octoberfest"" competition and even brought seven friends to cheer me on. We had dinner and drinks, but when it came time for the contest, management said they didn't know why it had happened at an earlier time than scheduled.

I had called and checked first for the times, checked their website, and even looked in the newspaper that they put on my table! All three sources had confirmed they have two contests per night on Fridays and Saturdays.

My friends and I left very disappointed, more from management's total lack of customer service than anything else. They did nothing to even attempt to make it right, they just made excuses and blamed others.

The beer is good but extremely expensive. I will admit there's something about holding the big liter stein that feels perfect. Just not for the price.

The staff has been somewhat unfriendly. I realize they get busy and the place gets packed. I've felt ignored and they have charged me for more than i ordered multiple times. They have however, got my order right every time. I find that impressive with the amount of customers.

Even with all this, I enjoy when they have live polka/German bands, beer games, and celebrity keg taps. It is the best place to go for the German experience in Vegas.

I asked if there was a smaller dinner that still sampled these items, he said uhhhh and stared at the menu over my should for awhile. He then suggested a sausage sampler from the happy hour menu. Not exactly what I was looking for, so I shared a salad and giant soft with my husband. The soft pretzel was made in Munich and frozen and shipped there. Sure tasted like it was frozen, dry and flavorless, but the dipping sauces saved it. I didn't try any of my husbands sausage sampler, but he didn't even eat the white type because it tasted like dry hot dog. Well, one beer, a salad, soft pretzel, and happy hour sausage sampler came to $46. We could have had a nice dinner for that much. My main problem is being told I shouldn't order something.

I had the priviledge of hosting about 10 folks from Bavaria and Austria and gave them a choice for their Christmas dinner.  When they chose this place I have to admit to being a little concerned, knowing we Americans way of ""Disney-fying"" everything.  

They bring their beer over directly from the HB in Munich so it's REAL German beer, not the recipe-altered imports like Becks and Lowenbrau.  Their variety of schnapps (brandy) is a little limited but plenty enough for fun.  The girl who circulates amongst the tables selling shkts of schnapps is fun and includes a whack with her paddle if you're I. to that kind of thing.

The food was good and seemed authentic to my experience actuall eating Germany for several years.  My guests agreed that the food was authentic and as good as you would get in most gasthauses (The Ochsen in Roost just outside Europa Park being a notable exception).  They even complimented the quality of the cuts used for the schnitzels as being above average.  If you're a foodie snob wannabe please move along, we don't need you here.

The German band was fun and kept up a steady replaying of drinking songs that had everyone swaying back and forth on the picnic bench seats.  Buying them a shot is always appreciated as are tips that get you a ring of the bell.

We arrived with high expectations, having visited the ""real"" Hofbrauhaus in Munich, when my wife was pregnant with our oldest child and unable to imbibe. We were really looking forward to visiting the Las Vegas recreation, and while the food and atmosphere were good, the whole experience was really ruined when we walked in the door.

Walk in, and expect to be ignored. There's a bar to the left, but they aren't interested in those waiting for tables. A hostess station emphatically states to wait for a hostess to seat you .... and wait you will.  While waiting (and waiting) to bide our time, I wandered into the nearby gift shop, where I had actually planned on spending $100+, but decided to wait until after our dinner, and I'm glad I did.

The apparent hostess-in-charge, Anna, finally appeared, and me and my family were standing front-and-center before the hostess station. Yet, it was as if we were literally invisible to Anna. There was another party behind us in line (also waiting for a hostess to arrive), and Anna behaved as if we were just not there. Anna went out of her way to greet the party behind us, who graciously stated, ""They were here first."" Anna then stormed off again, then came back, and asked the party behind us how many were in their party ... we were sure feeling the cold shoulder on a Monday! Eventually, after checking with Anna, a different hostess found the time in her life to lead us to a seat.

After that, our experience was great - we had an excellent waitress, Amanda, and our kids really enjoyed the authentic Bavarian music.

But I cannot get over how rudely we were treated by Anna - I spoke with the manager, who was very gracious, but I simply cannot recommend an establishment who employs someone to greet potential high-paying customers who behaves this way. Although the meal was good, I just wanted to leave ASAP because I was made to feel unwelcome from the moment I walked in.  No souvenirs to remember being shunned!

Maybe to some it is but to me it sure isn't even close. On the other hand one has to admit that even the original Hofbräuhaus is not really a decent place to begin with. It lives as a legend and ain't a place where locals go to anymore.


 First time we went there was with a group of international guests from all over the world, including some real Germans and specifically Bavarians. For me as a German I did not find the place to be very accurate but instead it was simply a selection of certain stero types most of the world thinks are typical German qualities. It starts with the music (an Austrian band played that evening), goes on with the beer (which is indeed the same beer as served here) and finishes with the wannabe German food. Very few of the available dishes were really German, most seemed to be americanized variations which is understandable since most Americans would probably dislike real German food to begin with.


 The waitress who took care of our group was simply overwhelmed and in a place like that I would expect the staff to at least understand you if you order from the menu in properly pronounced German. Not that evening, she placed several orders incorrectly and had troubles getting the drinks in the right order.


 Would I go there again? Unlikely. Do I think most Americans would enjoy the place? Sure, no question about that. ;)",iKxX6v3rMeIehHTKhW0hkw,0,0,3,nN4yLNPltwbkxmOWGrLcow

734031,2011-12-21,4,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"The Schnitzelmann hates what he must do here because he really believes in supporting unique places, especially one of only two authentic German restaurants in town. But if he is honest, 2 stars is about what the place is worth after deductions for the following:

One star must be deducted because of the exaggerated prices, which have risen regularly since the restaurant opened. Authentic ethnic cuisine can be had - even imported items - for lower prices than this at other off-Strip restaurants. The Schnitzelmann suspects that the Hofbräuhaus is mercilessly targeting one-time tourists, ignoring locals and practicing monopoly-driven price inflation such that if in Germany, the Bundesbank would immediately intervene. 

Another star must be deducted for the noise level, particularly evenings. The Schnitzelmann has been to the original Hofbräuhaus in München and can verify the music in Las Vegas is authentic, but significantly louder than in the Old Country. It is near-impossible to have any sort of dinner conversation with bands imported from Deutschland playing ""Hang on Sloopy,"" ""Country Roads"" and other obscure hits amplified to ensure maximum volume. 

A final star must be deducted for the service. The Schnitzelmann has known several of the waitresses personally and agrees they are of the finest personality away from the restaurant. Inside, though, the management seems to dictate that most wait staff push the more expensive items, rush customers out the door if they have not bought food or drink within a given amount of time, and be somewhat inflexible as regards splitting the bill. Always? No. But too regularly to ignore.

So we are left with two stars. One is for the high-quality food- all the items that can be are imported from Germany, including the fine beers on tap, and the Schnitzelmann has never had a bad schnitzel, wurst plate or even salad here. The two potato salads on offer are also quite good and the Kaiserschmarrn dessert is made just as in Mad King Ludwig of Bavaria's day.

One star is granted for the party-hearty atmosphere. The Schnitzelmann celebrated his bachelor party here and the long benches and tables and free-flowing beer made it easy to make new friends and revel in the waitresses spanking customers who request it. The same atmosphere (minus spankings) can be had during World Cup and European Cup Fussball matches, which are televised live and to which many knowledgeable and enthusiastic German fans come. 

But as regularly as Schnitzelmann comes here, there is always a sense afterwards he could have spent his time and money better elsewhere and that were he not such a fan of German culture and were there other German places in town, he would be at the Hofbräuhaus considerably less often.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,2,3,2,z0KGbLr_cLDKGhLcUuDDnw

Quick and simple:  Indoor beer garden, BIG, BIG steins of fresh beer, long communal tables, a live German band, everybody singing and drinking and laughing.

Good times!

Who cares if you don't know anyone here.  Bring some friends along and make some new ones while you're there.  The long tables and benches are meant for sharing with others and meeting new people.  Don't be shy!

Who cares if you're not German.  I'm not and definitely could never pass as one, but had a great time nonetheless.  In fact, some German folks were smiling at us because we were having such a great time.  That or they were surprised we knew the lyrics to some of the German drinking songs.  Yeah me and my buddies faked it pretty damn good.

Who cares if you don't speak German.  Drink and sing along at the top of your lungs and mumble something in tune.  Shoot make up your own lyrics if you want.  Just make sure to sway your stein back and forth up in the air.  You'll look stupid if you don't because you'll be the only one.

Who cares if you don't drink beer (WHAT!? Fine I'll drink it for you).  You'll still have a great time laughing at everybody and enjoying the band.

What you do drink beer??  The steins look big and intimidating, but if you do the math you'll realize how many bottles of beer is actually in one.....so order the biggest stein.  It's such a great feeling holding one in your hand.  So much power!  The beer goes down really smooth and its not at all filling.

It's a great feeling of being in a large room set up like an indoor beer garden and feeling like you're part of some big community or party.  Major plus is the band drinking along with everyone and singing at the same time!  Major skills there.

Definite good time.  Waitresses here are awesome....very friendly and there to make sure you have a great time.

By the way, make sure to ask for a round of shots for you and your guests.  Or at least a shot for your best bud you're drinking with.  It's tradition.

Everytime I brought my buddies here we always had a great time enjoying the ""party"" atmosphere, singing, drinking, and laughing the night away.

Oh yeah, make sure you buy a souvenir stein before you leave (they have a gift shop).  It'll make you smile everytime you use it or see it at home.  Buy the big one.

797245,2012-09-20,2,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"da wir schon drei Wochen da sind, reitet dich irgendwann der Teufel und gehst auch mal ins Hofbräuhaus. Oder wie wir Bayern sagen back to the roots, wenn wir in Amiland sind. Der Taxifahrer war ganz begeistert, weil auch er hin und wieder aber immer gerne i love it hingeht. Natürlich haben wir ihn mit unserer bayerischen Gastfreundschaft und den im Ceasars gewonnen Dollars eingeladen, was er nach wenigen tausendstel Sekunden Bedenkzeit mit Jesus yes angenommen hat. Wenn man vorfährt denkt man, aha das ist das Hofbräuhaus. Wenn ich von der Orlandostrasse zum Platzl geh denk ich auch, aha das ist das Hofbräuhaus. Wenn ich nachher wieder rausgeh war ich im Münchner genau doppelt so oft wie in dem von Las Vegas und in dem von Las Vegas genauso oft wie in dem in Stockholm, Rio und Singapure. Daheim gehich nur hin wenn ich unbedingt muss, weil ich Besuch von Amerika habe. Ok, das ist das Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas, so stehts auch aussen drauf. Als wir reingehen überkommt mich ein befremdliches Gefühl von Heimat. Es wir schnell klar, dass das nicht das nicht nur das Hofbräuhaus in Las Vegas ist, sondern auch Las Vegas im Hofbräuhaus. Von der Architektur ist dieses Haus spitze, echt 1a. Das hohe Kreuzgewölbe, wirklich sehenswert und vermutlich sauteuer in der jetzigen Zeit. Holztische und Holzbänke, eine kleine Bühne mit drei bayerischen Clowns, mit ihren grünen Sepplhüten. Die können spielen was sie wollen, es gefällt mir nicht, allein wegen ihrer Hohlkopfbedeckung. Ihre Musik hat hörbar bayerische Grundnoten und die Amis tanzen dazu ein Potpourri sämtlicher lateinamerikanscher Standardtänze gleichzeitig mit Free Jazz und Twist. Auch ein Zwiefacher ändert ihre Art zu tanzen nicht. Wir suchen uns einen Beobachtungsposten ganz links neben der Bühne an der Wand. Ein Smile im Dirndlgewand bringt uns die Karte und wir bestellen, Läwergnädlsubbm .. lass mas. Drei Mass zuerst. Ich schau mir den Souvenierladen vorher an. Aha Dallmayr Kaffee, einen Wandteller mit German Dog  Deutscher Schäferhund. Dackel in der Kuschelausgabe, T-shirts mit aufgedruckten Hosenträger, trotz Sommer Christbaumkugeln von der Brauerei und eine bayerische Fahne ist billiger als gebrannte Mandeln im Glas. Man muss es sich selber anschauen um zu sehen auf was man alles leicht verzichten kann. Zurück zum Tisch. Unserem Kutscher wird zuerst erklärt was ein Henkeltest ist. Die Mass am anfang soweit zu trinken, dass man sie auf den Henkel lehnen kann, ohne dass was rausläuft. Der Nachbartisch hat seine Noagal zusammengeschüttet und es gleich nachgemacht. Jetzt kommt das Essen. Alles was wir bestellt haben, gefühlt innerhalb einer Minute. Die Kartoffelsuppe war sehr gut, würzig, gschmackig, perfekt. Der Leberkäse hat etwas künstlich,- eher gar nicht geschmeckt. Die Weisswurst ??? ist halt Las Vegas. Der Schweinsbraten war sehr gut. Mit dem Fleisch kannst du den Amis nichts vormachen, das beherrschen sie. Auch das Schnitzel, schön paniert rund im Geschmack. Nur beim Drumrum da schlampen sie ein bisschen. Mir war die Soße, besser Sauce, trotzdem mit Packerlverdacht und zu sehr eingedickt und den Knödl hat vermutlich der Andre Agassi, der mit unserer Steffi an diesem idyllischen Ort wohnt, ins Aus geschlagen. Jetzt haben sie ihn auf unserem Teller recyclt. Der Kartoffelsalat war eiskalt. Gut, dass ich mir vorher noch meine Zähne versiegeln lassen habe, im Gegensatz zu unserem Chauffeur. Ein Taxifahrer ohne Krankenversicherung oder mit schlechter Mundhygiene. Auf alle Fälle kurzzeitig leidend. Inzwischen bringt uns unsere Ex-Avonberaterin im Hartz4 Paltinger die nächsten drei Mass. Wir bestellen noch zwei Giantpretzel -Brezn  mit Obatzda. Es war mir dann zu kompliziert unserer verkleideten und zum Bodenpersonal degradierten PanAm Stewardess zu erklären, dass ich den Obatzten lieber gegen eine Christbaumkugel eingetauscht hätte. Inzwischen haben wir Besuch vom überübernächsten Nebentisch bekommen, vier Männer im Beckenbauer Alter mit einer ganzen Batterie Underberg. Schnaps, Bier, Underberg. Unsere Bedienung hat die Mundwinkel so nach oben operiert wie die Angela Merkel nach unten. Ausserdem wird die bei jedem vorbeilaufen immer schöner. Alle paar Minuten schreit einer i love german und dann schüttest du das in dich hinein was der Rufer gerade in der Hand hat. Unsere Bedienung heisst Cinderella, zumindest heute abend und mutiert gerade zur Traumfrau. Jetzt kommt noch ein fünfter i love german an unseren Tisch. Der war sogar vor einer long time in Deutschland. Ja wo warst du den? In Amsterdam, Heidelberg, Vienna and Venecian. Das muss aber dann schon ganz lange her sein. Wir haben nicht mehr die Kraft ihn aufzuklären und es kommt noch besser. Ein sehr gepflegter, großer, gutaussehender und garantiert kein Hetero aber sicherer Nachkomme vom Kunta Kinte setzt sich neben mich. nice watch!!.

Overpriced.
Infexible with the menu sides.

The Hofbrau House tries to recreate a big beer hall atmosphere, so if you just want to get plastered like it's Oktoberfest and don't really care about the food, then it's probably great. However, if you want good German food, look elsewhere. Almost every non sandwhich type meal is $19.99 which is a high for the smallish portion sizes, and the first German restaurant that we have been to where you absolutely cannot swap a small side item to suit your tastes. My girlfriend got some bratwurst, and found the only mustard option was some generic Guldens, no German mustards; she also isn't a fan of saurkraut but couldn't substitute for red cabbage. If the meals were half the price, then I'd understand their inflexible, tight-fisted policy, but we've had much better German food with much better service for less money way too many times to find this place worth ever going back to.",m9ZwtR20x2iUzSlHDAhvUQ,0,0,2,rHwqUckKKYrG1xBz0cbUEw

The currywurst was spot-on, and you can't really go wrong with a giant pretzel with cheese!  The schnitzel was pretty good (although I make better--sorry guys!) and was quite a large portion.  Our only major complaint was that my husband ordered a dunkel and got a heffe, but whatever, he drank it anyway.

In the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the Hofbrauhaus logo. We were greeted by a friendly German man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. Haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. Unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. The band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. Great atmosphere.

We started with a jumbo Oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. Great starter! I'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. It came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. I wasn't lovin' it, but I drank it anyway.

For my meal I ordered the Majoram - veal bratwurst and it came with red cabbage and mashed potatoes. I had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. The red cabbage, which I didn't really want, was good. The bratwurst, also good. We also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. My coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the HB Riesenbratwurst. We had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. Hilarious. She was hammin' it up.

No room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some German schnapps - completely different from American schnapps. I was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. And strong.  By the end of the night we were stuffed. I don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. Better for the day of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.",qDYWRXL8jCdEdh7XahIFWA,0,0,4,c1Fg_4mes3DnS5oAQYTlCA

Waitress was really nice and food was served pretty quickly and was hot, but I don't like sausage or sauerkraut -so I was kind of screwed. Got the schnitzel and it was very heavy and fried and I felt sick for the rest of the night. 

BUT the pretzels were AWESOME! mustard and cheese to dip it in. Very tasty! But at $13 a piece - kind of pricey! 

oh yea and the beer was pretty good too, although the slamming of the glasses together scared me. I was convinced they would break, but they are apparently very durable/ strong glasses. 

Most fun? watching the hammered gay fall face first into the stage (where the band was playing) without putting his hands out to stop his fall. Lots of crazy singing/dancing etc. 

Worth at least one visit for the interesting experience. If I ever go back again - it will be too soon.",ckVtlSYAaP1eeUPEUSTJFw,1,1,2,bZq0XOW5bOe6kl3xxB9Nfg

The food is not the main reason to drag anyone to the restaurant either. However, Bavaria is not known for its culinary.  Don't get me wrong, the place is a unique experience: Loud music, Good beer and - if u are lucky, like I was - there will be a few groups of germans standing on the tables while singing and dancing and  you could also share one of the big tables with friendly, talkative bavarian folks. 

When it comes to the food: try the brats. The variety is not vast, but they are tasty and a good side of Germany. And the pretzels worth the try too. Don't forget the mustard and the obazda sauce. 

The service is not the strongest point: it took over 10 minutes to be greeted by anyone, another 10 minutes to get our beer and about half and hour to get the food. The wait wasn't bothering me much while my 1 liter beer was full and I was enjoining the music and the german bachelor party group next table, but then a sad thing happen: no one asked to refill our beers for the next hour, and when the server did, it took a while to come. 

Don't get scared when the bill comes. Just the pretzel itself is about $ 12, the beer $ 15... so... expect to spend from $50-$100 a person.

It was an experience indeed. The Hofbrauhaus reminds me of those days. Germany, Vegas style. The food is authentic enough to be called German cuisine.

As we were walking up to the place I heard live music, so I already knew it was going to be a good time. It's a huge white building with lit blue neon lights when it's dinner time. Once we got in I noticed a full bar and gift shop. We were seated quickly in what was like a Hogwarts type dinning hall, at least in my buzzed opinion. The ceilings are high and the tables and chairs are made of pure wood. They also have a stage set up for the music! 

Straight up Yelp, I had a 5 star time with 3 star food. 

The night we came there was a great crowd. The place was jamming, food was being served every minute, and people were taking shots of Jägermeister before getting spanked with a wooden paddle, hard. 

Before we ordered our food we started with a 2 Liter boot of Hefeweizen each. These were pretty fun and definitely pack a punch. I can't remember exactly what my meal was called but it was 2 grilled veal sausages, a little lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pretzel with dipping sauce.

This restaurant has 2 sections - the first when you walk in is the main room (pretty big) and a small stage is located at one of the corners; and a second room (also very big) which is called the Biergarten (the beer garden), I will just call it the Garden. Both are closed roof rooms. The first one is louder. The second one is quiter and more romantic, it has a fountain in the middle. I think there is also a second floor in the Garden with terraces overlooking the Garden, but I think it was closed that day, no one was sitting there.

I went with my family - wife and 2 kids. We sat in the Garden, which is recommended for groups with kids. The waitress and bussers are fast, very helpful and super friendly. Our waitress was from the Czech Republic (originally) which is next to Germany and she had a perfect knowledge of the cuisine and suggested us the most amazing dishes. She was great and very helpful. 

The appetizers came fast. We ordered  (102) Kartoffelpuffer - 3 potato pancakes and salmon and (111) Gurkensalat - cucumber salad with vinegar dressing. Both were really good and I recommend them to try.

We also ordered their house beer. It was very tasty, but not too heavy.

Next came the kids meals - they do have a kid's menu, but what we did is we ordered the chicken schnitzel dinner and split it in 2 for the kids. It's pretty big. It is (260) Schnitzelelsemmel for $15.99 and instead of bread we substituted for an order of french fries. Plus we orderer another portion of french fries. The fries are very good as well.

My wife ordered the pork schnitzel dinner which comes with the small German pasta and mushroom sauce. It is this one - (375) Jagerschnitzel for $19.99. I ordered a chicken dinner which has the same pasta and mushroom sauce. It is this one - (390) Gegrillte Hahnchenbrust for $18.99. They are both good and almost the same actually, just one is with pork schnitzel, the other is with grilled chicken. I recommend you try one of them. 

The food, the beer and the service are all 5 stars. We were very happy how everything tasted. We took a lot of it home cause we couldn't finish it and it tasted good the next as well.

There is also constant entertainment in the restaurant. At least if you go Fri, Sat or Sun - they have live music or other events. There was a band in the main room which plays half of the night when we were there. People jump on their chairs or benches and start dancing. At the Garden it is a bit quiter. There are some sexy dressed women though, which walk around and spank people. You give them a tip and they can spank you or your friend. It's funny. And last, but not least, I love the decor and the traditional German outfits the personnel is wearing. Everything is made so that you really feel you are in a traditional German restaurant.

I ended up tossing the hot dog at the wall.

This place will definitely satisfy your desires if you're wanting to experience a bunch of loud, annoying drunk people pretending they're in Germany. What's that? Oh, you have a giant glass boot filled with beer? You better chug that down as fast as you can without breathing!

I bet this place has to employ a full-time barf cleaner for all the times people drink themselves sick, not to mention the people who throw up after finding out they ate an Oscar Meyer hot dog filled with chicken beaks and pig assholes.

And as I recall, the entree was rather expensive. You can save yourself a lot of money and have the same meal if you just go to the supermarket, buy a pack of hot dogs, warm them up in the microwave and dip them in mustard. And don't forget to play some annoying German music and sing ""ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy"".",MIWGbwlUlekC7OS-UTsa6A,1,1,1,glosw8ITXKmMLII7UFHv9A

My friend Kerri made a reservation for 3pm for this place they day before. Ania, one of Isabel's friends suggested that we go to this place. I do believe that Isabel had taken her then boyfriend (now husband) to this place on their anniversary (as an unmarried couple late last year). I was down to try a German/Bavarian restaurant and see what foods they had to offer. Ania, Kerri (went to the Munich location), and Isabel said that this place was good. Of course, I don't know what ""good"" German/Bavarian food is supposed to taste like. 

We went to Hofbrauhaus after our windy and cold experience at Marquee Dayclub. It was still windy as we were walking in, but inside was nice and toasty. :) I absolutely loved the architecture in this building as well as the artwork and the long, wooden ""family style"" tables.  We were sat down and within a few minutes we were ready to order. Our server was pretty friendly.  I ended up ordering the Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup w/ sliced sausage and the Obazter Classic Bavarian Appetizer while everyone else ordered meat items. None of us ordered any beer, although I was pretty tempted to order a stein. Isabel ordered the shot that came with a paddle spanking, and ordered it for that reason. I know a few people in the restaurant ordered it, and when I saw the spankings and how much they hurt those people, I was not about to order it. When Isabel got her spanking, she was a freakin' champ, only a little hop. lol.... 

Anyway, our food took a little while to come to our table, but it was well worth it. My soup was creamy and tasty, and not salty and my appetizer was so good. The pretzel was soft and it was perfect with the seasoned brie & cream cheese dip, however, I consumed the pretzel before I even finished the two mounds of cheese dip. I ended up having to order another pretzel to finish it off. The girls seemed to enjoy the food and the festivities, which included the chicken dance. This occurred after the beer holding contest (the beer was in a stein and the arm had to be straight with no leaning back for leverage). In the end, two guys ended up in a tie and each got a free stein as a souvenir. Us girls got a free stein after doing the chicken dance, and that stein went to Isabel because it was her bachelorette party weekend. I hate the chicken dance, but it was worth getting kicked and stepped on to get a free stein. lol.....

Hofbrauhaus is a good place to drink tons of German-crafted beer, sing along with the host, get a spanking after taking shots (not for people with a low threshold for pain), eat delicious food, and do the chicken dance.",JAWpwyfRiRjgr0PDUrm00Q,0,1,4,B8ERDjqcoBm6y5hoD7leOg

The liter beers are huge, about the size of my head.  You could kill someone w/ the mug, it was so heavy.

We ordered the chicken bratwurst, veal bratwurst, weiners (kekeke -_-), and pork cutlet entrees along with two pretzel apeptizers - one was some garlic type tip, and the other was chicken liver.  I was surprised the chicken liver didnt taste bad, but I dont think i'd recommend it.  The pretzels were awesome though, with the other dips.  The chicken bratwurst seemed too dense and was really filling - it's like they packed a whole chicken into the two bratwursts.  The weiners were soo good, wish we had some buns to put them in (thats what she said).  But really, we all thought they'd be amazing with buns and ketchup.  The pork cutlet was huge, took up the entire plate and was also really good with the spicy mustard.  All the entrees came w/ a side, like mashed potatoes.  I had the liter hef to drink (it was great), and i was surprised i left standing (lightweight, i know O_o).  All the entrees are large portions, so you'll definitely leave feeling full.

The dining area was cool, felt kind of like a cafeteria.  We came around 2pm so there weren't that many people there, but I bet it would be so fun eating and drinking there when its packed, with live music going on.

Next time I come i want to try some of their fish specials, but being my first time there, it just didn't sound right not getting bratwurst.

The service was great, really attentive and gave us recommendations on what people liked.  The manager also said it was cool for us to leave the car parked in their private lot and walk across the street to the hard rock too.

But aside from typical restaurant reviews, this was truly a bizarre experience. Soon after getting drinks, a photographer came by and told -- not asked -- my guest and I to sit together so she could take a picture. She came back just after we got our food with our photo in a kitschy magnet selling for $10. I might have predicted this, but I wasn't prepared for the surliness of the photographer when we declined, since we were looking for a bite to eat, not posing in front of the Bellagio with a fanny pack and a noseful of sunscreen.

There was spanking... with wooden paddles, by waitresses in busty St. Pauli Girl-style dresses, which somehow seems just a shade off of an authentic German restaurant experience, if that's what the restaurant was going for. 

The spanking periodically generated loud whoops and chants from fratty guys, which was distracting only if you happened to be paying attention to the band, which played the Chicken Dance, Abba, the Star-Spangled Banner, and Sweet Caroline, in that order. Our waitress excused herself at our drink order to link arms with her nearest colleague when the chicken dance played.

It was my husband's turn to pick a place for date night and he had heard about HofBrauhaus from some of his co-workers. He decided to check it out for a couple reasons- 1) we both enjoy German food, esp. after living in Italy and travelling to Germany to see my sister-in-law (stationed in Germany) and 2) we're getting ready to move to Germany in a year and wanted a little German tease. 

ATMOSHPERE:  I was not surprised by the decor or the costumes since we had been told about the place. Although the description from one of my husband's co-workers was wrong. He described it ""like a restaurant you would go to in Bavaria."" To us, it was more like a beer tent one would see at an Oktoberfest. Anyway, the atmosphere was pleasant enough but I would not recommend for a date night. 

FOOD & DRINK: For a starter, I had the soup of that day, salmon and asparagus soup and my husband had the Potato Soup. Both were really really good and I could have eaten more! Main dishes- I ordered the  Majoram- veal bratwursts with red cabbage and a side of spatzle. The sausages (2) were good but not great. The cabbage was too sweet and the spatzle too bland. The beer was good but I've had better dark beers.  My husband ordered the Munchner Weisswurste- poached white sausages and a pretzel. He enjoyed his dish but again, it was good not great. Drinks- because I wasn't driving, I ordered the Hofbrau Dunkel (small size). It was okay but I've had better dark german beers. 

It's a great place if you're going with a group of friends or family. Otherwise, not ideal for a date night unless you enjoy shouting over the live band and sharing a table with strangers.",KBrv0-tU2YlDJPOD_BTjcw,0,0,3,RY8-_8FhGGlwS9kuWCOmOg

Hearing the live German band playing traditional drinking songs inspired us all to order the Liters of their original beer. I was super glad to read that they follow the German beer laws in this joint too. 
In Germany it is against the law to add preservatives or sugar to the beer, which means you can drink all the liters you want and feel great the next morning. 

I was a bit disappointed that they were not serving the Pork Knuckle ( pork shoulder on the bone) because I had a hard on for the dish in Munich. Yet, the fact that they do serve it on other nights made me feel OK with it. Obviously I have to come back on my next visit to this crazy city. 
After going over the mouthwatering menu a couple times, my eyes locked in on the Schnitzel (spelling?). A fried slab of pork smothered in a fucking awesome brown gravey, mashed potatoes and some veggies. Just enough to fill you up but not to the point of vomiting.

We ordered the giant pretzel combo and a couple beers (Octoberfest & Heffe)The beer was really good & not too pricey. The pretzel was light & airy...really good. It came with a sweet mustard, regular brown mustard, and some kind of cheese spread. Out of all the dippers we preferred the plain brown mustard.

(Unless, perhaps, you're in Bavaria. And even there, I doubt you'll hear a guy mixing traditional German songs with reggae and the ""Hogan's Heroes"" theme song.)

My husband and I met some friends for lunch on a Saturday. We arrived at noon, and the place was nearly empty. By the time we left at 1:30, however, the place was rocking, no doubt due to the entertainment (a one-man band) that began at 1. It was also extremely loud, so if you're looking to have an intimate meal, this is NOT your place! If you're looking for a good, raucous time, give the Haus a whirl.

As I said, the food is not the draw here; it's the beer. We each had a liter of the Oktoberfest, which is a nice, smooth lager. As much a I enjoyed this seasonal offering (and it was the main reason we all decided to meet here for lunch), I was craving the Hofbräu Original, so I got myself a 0.5-liter mug as well. So tasty! And so pricey -- $17 for the Oktoberfest, and $8 for the Original. (Hey, I said it was tasty. I didn't say it was cheap!)

My friends split a jumbo pretzel, complete with sides of mustard, cheese spread, and liver pate. At around $17.50, this was one expensive appetizer. Although they enjoyed their app, my husband and I skipped straight to the entrees. I had the beer sausage (a bratwurst), which was on ""special"" for $16, and he had his old standby, the leberkäse, which is like an upscale grilled Spam loaf. (Sounds bad, but it's oh so good.) My friends had the beer sausage and the giant bratwurst sandwich, and they split of piece of Black Forest cake for dessert. Total damage for lunch (pre-tip): $190. Eek!

There are two dining rooms in the building, and we've sat in both of them. On this occasion, the smaller, indoor beer garden was closed, so we sat in the large beer hall up front.

I enjoyed the different sauces for the sausage as well as the Mushroom sauce for the snitzel. I was less impress with the pretzel, which they claimed as a giant pretzel.

Even on a Monday night with the tables about half full, this place was Really really REALLY LOUD. Conversation with anyone not sitting immediately adjacent to you consists of yelling, shrugging, and smiling in a slightly confused way because you don't know if your table mate said something funny or tragic.

God bless the poor musicians on stage doing the most thankless gig in Vegas. But the music they were playing was not in any way conducive to a German vibe. Painful renditions of ""Margaritaville"" and such just exacerbated the disconnected wierdness of the whole experience. Performed through what must be the worst sound system in town in the boomiest room in North America - well... there was nothing that they could do, really.  Call me crazy, but in this kind of place, I want a barely amplified German polka band. Strolling, perhaps. 

The staff - from Greeters to Servers - were fun and friendly. They deserve hazard pay for dealing with the drunken shenanigans that happen in this place.

The food - fine. Simple and filling. This is not the place to come for fine dining. It did indeed remind me of the many meals that I have eaten in the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. So, pretty authentic in that area.

The Beer - also authentic and fine. This is good, standard German beer done well. Nothing to knock your socks off. Nothing Micro-brewery fancy schmancy here. Just traditional brews with a relatively low alcohol content. Perfect if you plan to drink a few liters (and remember that a liter is a WHOLE LOT more than a pint). 

After all of that...
I admit that I did have a good time - mainly because of the company.

Hofbräuhaus is not just a restaurant, it's a place of fun and pure revelry. Aside from the Stein holding contest, I participated in everything mentioned in some fashion. It was so much fun I needed video evidence of the festivities (or maybe I just blacked out).

Despite a packed house and a noisy party going on at every corner, our server was attentive and very quick with our orders and food. I opted for the 2 liter boot, because why not, it's Vegas. I also started off with the soup which had a savory chicken broth accompanied with a giant meatball. It was so good I destroyed the meatball and gulped the broth down as fast as I could. For my main course, I had the Currywurst. I've never eaten a meal so fast in my life. I don't know if it was drunken munchies, or I was super hungry, but I should have choked to death that night. In any case, the curry was delicious, not too spicy or strong. I'm used to Thai and Indian curries, so I would have preferred it that way but it was amazing in its own right. I actually dipped my fries in the sauce so I could eat it all. In hindsight, should have asked if rice was offered here!

But let's get to the reason I love it!!!  First of all, it's actually built like a Hofbrauhaus.  Tall, rounded ceilings, a long hall full of picnic style tables where you sit with strangers, and a LIVE German Oompa band!!  Yay!!  It's like German Disneyland, with music, dancing (normally the chicken dance or some sort of chain style of dancing).  Most times I've been there I've run into Europeans- Germans, Austrians, Swiss- and they know all the songs and sing along!  I've even seen a few dance on the tables.  It is not unusual for diners to dance and participate in the entertainment (though it is not required!)

The bands change every few weeks or monthly, so every time I go it's a new experience.  Some of the bands specialize in things or have different 'activities' such as playing the long alpenhorn, dancing the chickendance in a chicken mask, or one time a band member had people throw coins into his tuba! 

If you want to eat, the pretzels are okay, and so is the cheese dip.  I also eat the potato soup on a regular basis and it's fine.   The salads are okay.  I was not impressed by the schnitzels I've had there.  The sausages were ok, but they're hard to mess up.

Of course they have German Beer, and a sad selection of wine (I know they have Riesling, but no Gewurtz).  And they have Schnapps paddles.

This is definitely a great place for celebrations. Also, where else would you get spanked every time you have a shot of jäger?... Here!...So I started with a shot of Jäger.
Now, the food is a different story, although people around me seemed to enjoy it, I'm not really a fan. I ordered the Hofbräuhaus wurstplatte, recommended by my Hispanic looking German waitress, she said it was one of the most popular dishes in the house and the menu says is for sausage lovers. ( I know, it doesn't sound right) it wasn't bad really but it wasn't good either, I wasn't impressed by it, I mean there was the ""wow"" factor but nothing to do with flavor...... So I ordered another shot of jäger. (better sausages at Las Vegas grille and also less intimidating)
Previously i had ordered the Bavarian appetizer, Obazda, now this is worth ordering again, it was really good. Brie prepared with cream cheese, butter, onions, served with a freshly baked pretzel...... and a shot of Jäger.
The beers are good of course, who doesn't like German beer? But they are a little bit pricey so we only had one 1 litter Oktoberfest beer each. WOW, when the waitress came back and sat the two beers on the table my friend and I looked at them and we were impressed of how huge they were! Wow! there's something worth coming back for! (by the way, the beers were also big) ....so I had a shot of Jäger.
For dessert I ordered the apfelstrudel which is their signature dessert and I loved it, accompanied with a shot of Jäger is the best.
I'm pretty sure I'll be back. Even though this place is a bit pricey and they seem to cater mostly to tourists, this is a good place for birthday parties and any kind of celebration or to bring friends from out of town.

1. This is a German beer garden.
2. This place will be loud. Very loud. (There is a quieter section which you can ask for, but why?) 
3. The dining room is made up of huge tables, which means that unless you have about 8 in your party you will be sharing a table. 
4. You will be encouraged to drink. 
5. The food is mediocre. 
6. The beer is outstanding (and I don't like lagers much!) , and the only size it's served in is liter (don't order one of those smaller sizes).
7. You may get paddled (sometimes to the point where your arse is black and blue the next morning).
8. You will need to stand on your table and participate in the singalongs. 
9. Apple schnapps goes down very easy and has little alcohol.
10. You go here to have a raucous good time.

I've been to the Hofbräuhaus house several times and I'd say on every Vegas trip I go, I try to make it a point to go to this fine establishment. Mind you, the 4 stars may be misleading; I honestly can't remember the food too much, except on the way out sometimes. 
The 4 stars has to do with the vibe of the restaurant, the amazing beer and the fantastic service. 

The service is great; they encourage drinking and make sure everyone has a good time. A performer would come down to each table and drink beer with the table. I remember one performer telling us he loved his job - he gets paid to party with guests! 

The beer is delicious. If you are looking for the Naughty Ice and the Paps of the world, this may not be the place for you. (In no means do I dislike naughty and Paps, they got me through college; but sometimes you want a change of pace). My favorite beer is the hofbräu original, but I've tried them all, and they are all top quality beer imported from Germany. They serve the beer in these huge liter glasses and gives you that European feel (So I've heard, although I've never been to Europe).

The best reason for the 4 stars is the vibe of the establishment. Everyone is merry, the music is jovial and the staff holds games throughout the night that you can play to win a glass or other prizes. Think chicken dances, holding your beer up the longest and spankings! The tables are the long type tables that force you to be cozy with your neighbors. I typically wouldn't like this, but the place has such a friendly atmosphere that it's really fun that way.

Some of the sausages were great but others were just OK. The sauerkraut though was just beautiful. I'd call it new sauerkraut because it was less fermented than normal which made it very pleasant to eat on its own. I think the food is reasonably priced, expect $20 an entree, given the added cost of the semi elaborate accompanying atmosphere.

Now while the atmosphere was fun, I'd prefer if the live music matched the theme of the restaurant a bit more. Hearing songs like the U.S. national anthem and other U.S. classics was kind of odd in a place this strongly German themed.

We went kind of early so is wasn't packed or extremely loud like some reviewers have posted.  The atmosphere overall was nice,  we were seated at a table by ourselves since it wasn't very crowded at the time.

My wife ordered Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte (Sausage Platter) and I got the Schnitzel Wiener Art (breaded Veal cutlet) and we shared for some variety.  Both plates were delicious,  we would have devoured it all but the servings were big so there was some food left over. 

The beer was good and cold, we both ordered the large mug (I think it was a liter).  I participated in a beer chugging contest for a free mug and came in 2nd out of 10.  No free mug but it was free to participate. 

There was not a band playing while we were there but there was a solo guy providing some entertainment,  he also coordinated the chugging contest.

If you order any shots, prepare to get swatted with a paddle.  Not sure if they do that in Germany or not but it was funny for everyone else to see and drew their attention when it cracked.

The only down side to this place was the location.  It was off the main strip so far, probably took us 20-30 minutes to walk each direction.  Not a big deal as we needed the exercise anyway after trying to eat all that food, would consider taking a taxi next time.

Let me just say that in the real Hofbrauhaus, I could order pig's knuckle (which sounds pretty grim, but trust me.... it's the best of pulled pork and chicharones). Their beers were flowing like none other except in Munich. I couldn't understand a word of what was going on around me but that added to the festivity.

Here, I had to settle for their sampler (combination plate?) of a sausage, and some cuts of meat. It was good, but not terrific. It was overpriced too...

Their beer was ok... I tried the Maibock when I went. Again, it was good, but still missing something. The atmosphere was good. It was relatively empty since I went during lunch. Their performer was really entertaining. He really saved the entire meal. (I bet the dinner atmosphere is a lot more entertaining when everyone is drunk off their asses).

Then somewhere along the course of my lunch it hit me--I'm not in Munich. It's another one of Vegas' facades. Like the Eiffel Tower at Paris compared to the real one, or New York New York to the real Big Apple, I can't keep making these comparisons to their real brethren.

The part that makes this place not so amazing, are the food and the prices.  BUT DUH, IT'S VEGAS so OF COURSE it won't be......look, if you want affordability in Las Vegas, LEAVE THE STRIP.  THERE!

Back to the review.  The food is there but it doesn't shine.  Either the meat is not juicy enough, the vegetables seem too artificial, or there isn't that touch or flare of German ""family"" added to the food.  When you've tried enough German food, you'll understand what I mean.  And for what you paid for, I had a slight feeling that I lost more money than what I spent at the Hofbrauhaus.

However, the drinks don't fail, nor does the band in getting people involved in having a good time.  It's a great first time experience.  Probably because it's in Vegas, as mentioned earlier about not having that German ""family"" flare, there isn't enough at this place that makes you want to come back over and over.  It's not a nitch location for good times.  It's like watching an awesome show at an amusement park where the right elements are in front of you and at the table.  But in the wonderful world of food and venue exploration, you find sometimes that no matter how bad the drinks or the food, it's the engagement and that connection that really brings customers and places together.

This place is massive! Felt like I was walking up to a ride at a theme park. It is overall very themed. I definitely felt like I was submerged in a German pub. The live music and frequent toasts were a nice touch. 

We didn't have reservations as it was early Tuesday evening and we just assumed they would have room to cram us in the grand hall. Thankfully they did, and for the majority of our meal we had a large family style table in the grand hall all to ourselves. We had a great view of the restaurant and the band. The walls were lined with their massive beer glasses. All wait staff were decked out in traditional attire that really help submerge you in the culture. By 7pm the hall was pretty much full so if you are visiting and know that you want to experience this place, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAKING A RESERVATION.

The menu is pretty extensive with schnitzel this and spatzle that. It all sounded pretty amazing. We decided to start with an appetizer- Obadtza -it was a small pretzel with a brie cheese blend and some veggies. The pretzel was very hard :/ and the cheese was not what we expected at all, it was like a cold cheese ball with some sliced cucumber, tomato and onion. The cheese itself was good. We found ourselves eating it by fork as the pretzel was practically inedible, as it was hard as a rock.

*This appetizer also came out at the same time as our food  -_-

Most menu items were pork based so unfortunately that left me with slim pickings. I noticed they had a chicken schnitzel on a bun, like a sandwich, but I was hungry and didn't want to just eat primarily bread. (Good thing I didn't order this because if their buns are anything like their pretzels then I would of been very disappointed)

*They do offer a vegetarian selection!

I ordered the vegetarian schnitzel because I felt like I had to. I was a bit dissatisfied as I expected their mushroom gravy or at least something to add flavor. I had two fake chicken (?) crispy patties that were perfect in texture but completely tasteless. The patties rested on a cold bed of cucumber/potato salad. This salad was very refreshing and seemed like something better consumed outside on a hot day at a BBQ. If it wasn't for the fresh cucumbers this salad would of been completely flavorless. I ate a plate of very bland food... like there wasn't even a pinch of salt :/

My friend ordered the Jägerschnitzel and said she thoroughly enjoyed it and would order it again.

Overall THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. The theming was on point. I think we would return for a beer in the biergarten area. Their hefeweizen was very very good.

I was immediately jumped on by a very rude hostess who emphatically told me that I couldn't bring in outside beer. The bottle is black so you can't tell if it even has anything in it at all. I replied that it was an empty bottle. Again I was emphatically told no outside beer and she pointed to an area by the bar to put my bottle. Again I said it is empty and I wasn't going to drop it off. More lip from this loser so I took the cap off the bottle right in front of her and turned the bottle upside down to empty the contents on the lobby floor. A piece of paper fell out so she finally figured that it was new and didn't contain any liquid including beer. I was about to walk when she wised up and asked how many. I told her I have a reservation, but may not ever again. We were seated up front and enjoyed the rest of the evening. Too bad the first person we talked to was so rude and ignorant.

I live in Sacramento, CA and usually come to Vegas for about a week once every year while attending the CES convention.  There are a lot of places I have to make sure I visit to eat and this is one of them.  Looking around, we don't really have German restaurants in Sacramento. I mean there are restaurants in Sacramento that are categorized as German, but they are German themed food with your meats and potatoes and such.  This place has actual authentic German dishes which is what I look forward too and what Sacramento sorely needs.

When you first walk into here, you walk into their small merchandise room where you can find an assortment of German themed items and clothing, some of them of course with Hofbrauhaus's name into it. Beyond there are two rooms, Not sure the name of the first room but walking through that room, you arrive to the beer garden portion of the room.  The first room is slightly dark lit, and as we've always come there for dinner, they always have a band playing there. It's a very loud room.  I prefer to eat in the beer garden where I can't hear most of the music. For those looking for a happy go lucky fun time with eating, drinking and singing, that first room is for you. When the hostess asked if I wanted to be seated close or far from the music, she took us and was proceeding to have us sit in the first room, but further from the band.  I had to tell her that we actually meant the beer garden. So it looks like you have to specify that in the beginning.

Most of the patrons are in the first room and the beer garden is more empty although is slowly fills up as well.  We ordered and had our drinks shortly.  The food came out surprisingly fast and bow was the food good.  I did notice that teh waitresses weren't that busy, even when more people started to file into the beer garden.  They spent a lot of time talking with one another. Not sure if this is a good or bad thing but they did it a ways away from us so whenever I needed something, they were right there. Very attentive? Too attentive?  It didn't bother me too much.  

Also, I think their root beer might be house made.  Drinking it, I really couldn't distinguish between what type of root beer it was but it was pleasantly sweet.

There is a live band that performs here at the Hofbrauhaus on a daily basis. I haven't come here for lunch, but it's always oktoberfest when I come here for dinner. The food ranges from shnitzel to sausages. If you have not the apetite to eat like a Bavarian, there are some side dishes such as french fries and pretzels. The pretzel is also the symbol of eating like a Bavarian. It goes well with the beer as well. If you want something sweet, you can also order there ""biker beer"" The biker beer consists of beer mixed in with sierra mist. Back when I started drinking beer at the age of 26... i wasn't into the whole beer scene, so biker beer did it for me. Yet, as my love grew for the taste of lager... I need to get straight 1 liter of german lager. You don't have to order food to enjoy live entertainment. Some couples just order the beer. But to experience true Bavarian food that you won't be able to experience elsewhere, you should try shnitzel art. If shnitzel is not your thang, than try the bavarian sausages sampler. Its good to drink some soup, too. I would suggest the goulash. For an appetizer, I would suggest the bavarian pretzel. And as for the dessert... I would definitely say get the strudel!

(I don't recall the Hofbrauhaus outside of Cincy being this bloated in price.) 19$ for a plate of fried fish (and gross, super cheap Tilapia on top of that), 16$ for a couple chicken sausages...The beer is also pricey but not as off as the food. 13.99 for a pretzel and some side fixings. Yes it was a giant pretzel, but that is ridonkulous that it's so ridiculous. I'd say come here for a beer, share a pretzel or an entree and scoot if you REALLY want to come here. Otherwise you will spend a boatload on very simply flavored food!!",715N9CM6qrRp_lLzgp79rw,0,0,3,nMlEFz6C1BddNzMsBpigEQ

1) Jumbo pretzel - Served with spicy mustard, sweet mustard, and some combo of cheese spread.  A slightly crispy outside, with a nice chewy inside.  The cheese spread was delicious.  The pretzel was good, but would've been better if it was warm.

2) Hofbrauhaus hahnchen - Grilled chicken with a mushroom sauce and spatzle.  The chicken was nice and juicy, the mushroom sauce was nice and not intensely mushroomy, but the spatzle was annoying bland.  It was my first time having spatzle, so I wasn't sure what I should have expected, but no amount of sauce was able to help it out.

Our server's name was Sam, and she was awesome.  She gave us some great advice about the menu and was very funny.  The smacking of the butts with the shots was truly entertaining.

We ordered a large pretzel and for our entree we shared the pork shank special.  Very nicely cooked, the skin was the best part!

When we arrived, we entered the front area that had a small bar, hostess stand, and a gift shop.  We requested seating and the hostess asked if we had reservations.  ""No, we don't"".  She then asked my name - no problem, my phone number - really, and my email address.  I felt like I was undergoing a background check to get a seat.

We were led to an empty table (this is all community seating) that would sit about 8 people.  We were back near the beer glass storage and in front of a wait station.  The seats were fine and it was definitely loud.  

Our server came quickly and took our drink orders and our food orders.  While we were waiting on our food, the alpenhorn began its trip around the restaurant.  The guy sets the horn on the table in the diners' faces and tries to play a tune.  I think you are supposed to put money in the horn when he is done.  I watched this for several minutes, and just when I thought it was over, he approached our table.  I shook my head ""no"".  He kept coming.  I looked him in the eye and shook my head ""no"" again.  He just smiled and put the horn directly in my face.  I got up from the table and walked away.  He was not deterred.  He proceeded to play in my wife's face.  I have some hearing issues and that noise that close causes me a lot of discomfort.  This was the point my visit went downhill.

Our food was delivered.  I ordered a chicken sandwich (I am not a big fan of German food).  It was dry and bland, but edible.  The french fries were good.  My drink was empty and did not see the waitress until I was 3/4 finished with my meal.  After that she was able to be more attentive and fill our drinks a couple more times.  

If the alpenhorn wasn't enough, someone thinks it is a good idea to plan the National Anthem in a restaurant during supper.  Nothing like having to get up in the middle of a meal to salute the flag.  What are these people thinking?

I can honestly say I will not go back to this place.  It definitely is not for me.  I saw several groups enjoying themselves while drinking beer and taking shots.  It was entertaining to watch the drunks celebrate.  It kind of reminded me of the Strohaus at the 1982 World's Fair, but not done nearly as well.",kjoelX7Xcv0rXREqVwJA8A,0,0,2,dN7uswTlVVPLDviwSogHAg

Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas also has tv's throughout the place so you can watch you're favorite sports games.

For desert..I drank that to.  It came in the form several Apfelkorn shots.  Those are crazy dangerous, especially when you add the element of pain compliance of some paddle welding fraulein.

The architecture and noise create a most festive atmosphere.

Second time around I opted to try some of the food in addition to the beer and shots minus the spanking.

My buddy and I ordered up a sausage sampler which was served on a three tiered plate.  Lot's of sausage, sauerkraut, some mashed potatoes and a couple of pretzels thrown in for good measure.  This was definitely a meal within it's self.

Oddly enough, Vegas is a German food Mecca of sorts - at least for our part of the country. I was amazed at how many German places I saw around Vegas! Especially since the town is not the biggest. I actually got to try two places and one of them was the fabulous Hofbrahaus!

I know that German food is not one of the most well known cuisines in the world since it is so simple but if you get to try it you will see there is true beauty in its simplicity!

To start with Hofbrauhaus is beautiful inside and out. The building looks like traditional German architecture on the outside and inside. The ceilings are high and they are painted really nicely. They have a stage for live bands too! Seating is on large tables with benches just like you would expect in a Munich beer hall!

My BF and I came here on our last day in Vegas and I decided to treat him with the money I got from the machines!

What is really cool, and even impressive is that some of the food items are actually flown in from Germany!!!! We had a large freshly flown in pretzel to start with and we found out that the red cabbage, bratwurst and sauerkraut are also flown in!!!! We had the veal bratwurst, the chicken bratwurst and two beers. Mine was a incredibly good special seasonal beer! We also tried the apple strudel which was also flown in! Everything was seriously very tasty!

This review, of course, is not truly complete since I did not get to be here during Oktoberfest! The ambience here must be truly incredible when it is that time of year! However, if this place gets five stars without all the excitement of Oktoberfest - it truly must be good and, trust me it is

Service was pretty good! While you wait they give you interesting little newspapers with all kinds of information about the restaurant and its events. Next time we come I will make sure we get to check out one of the live bands! Expect to spend a great deal of what you win at the machines haha! This place is not cheap! I shelled out about $90 for two with tip included!

Actually, I take that back, the number of stars really depends on the purpose of your visit. For German mastication, 1 star is plenty.

I'm a big guy, but there are entree salads I've had elsewhere that are much more filling than the schnitzel plates I ate here. The food isn't inedible, but there are far better places in town for authentic and filling german fare.

Now, for a rowdy night of beer drinking and paddling, this place earns 4 stars. Steins of light and dark house beer are rampant as is the stereotypical German drinking songs performed by whoever is on stage. As for the house beers, I prefer the dark; flavorful, aromatic and just bitter enough to turn me away from vodka for the evening. If not, there's always Jager to fall back on. Watch out for the ladies with paddles and either avoid them or give them a holler, depending on how red you'd like your bottom to be at the end of the evening.

There were songs about beer (sung in German), grown men asking to be paddled on the ass by the waitresses in front of the entire hall, games to win glass steins. Oh yes, the entire place was up on the tables dancing and singing along as best (or worst) as they could. 

Hofbrauhaus isn't your typical ""sit-down"" restaurant by any means. Rather, the eating ""hall"" is full of tables that are shared among everyone. Groups are seated far enough apart to have their own space, but I can see the place being filled & mingled with patrons on a busy night. 

This time around, I took some advice from a fellow Yelper and ordered the stuffed chicken (Grillhendl). It's difficult to describe, but the flavor was definitely German and very delicious. Erin Ashley (my wonderful woman) ordered some type of salad -- potato salad mixed with green salad & a type of schnitzel on top. Oh the glory.

For an appetizer we were served a soft preztel accompanied with three sauces -- spicy mustard, sweet-spicy mustard, and a thick-creamy spread made from Brie cheese. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Brie. But this spread is to live for. 

I sang. I danced. I drank. I didn't win a stein, but I will keep going back to have fun and play the game. And so should you.",rQM4yX8XW466hX2to2O2bw,0,0,4,OdM7yNgKWiBbgYQZJKcohQ

But let me start with the positive: I was born and raised in Germany and Munich/Oktoberfest was always high on our agenda before we moved here. So let me tell you this: food and drinks - authentic. They even served the seasonal ""Wiesnbier"" in the traditional 1l ""Mass"", which tasted exactly like the one we had in Germany (did not seem to be brewed here in the U.S. but really imported from Munich). We all had a ""Schweinshaxe"" (knuckle of pork), which the apparently only serve on Saturdays. The texture/taste was excellent: Crispy skin and juicy/tender meat (I wish they had the famous Bavarian hot mustard called Loewensenf). The traditional Bavarian dumplings were great yet they missing some gravy. I do not need to waste time on describing the ambiance: This is Vegas, everything looks great, bombastic and as realistic as possible. Bottom line - a fantastic, authentisch Bavarian brew house.

So why ""just"" 4 stars? Number one: The place is overpriced as both the Schweinshaxe and the Mass were more than twice as expensive than what you can expect in Munich even during the high-season/high-priced Oktoberfest weeks. So whatever you paid - cut it in half, subtract another 25% (tax and tip are included in Germany) and you get an idea what you would have paid in any of the plenty Munich ""Bierkeller"" (brew houses). And number two: Not just that they charge you much more for the Schweinshaxe, they also just give you half (!) of it. They cut one in the middle and my wife got one half and I got the other (easy puzzle as we sat right next to each other). This is not happening in any of the Bavarian places. You pay for one (!) Schweinshaxe, you get one Schweinshaxe. Anyways, I guess they just adopted quickly to U.S. capitalism :-).

Bottom line, I would go back the next time I am in Vegas but if I was living there it would not be my every week dining place.",KLS_AWthM9n6KLcBTCF_RQ,0,0,4,_iEwxVVssQPAr_sH0FInNQ

Like Brittany B. said, ""I was expecting such an experience.... I [also] will never return""

I feel like I HAVE TO go into the whole meal for you to get why this is a 1 star..... so heeeeere-we-go!

We came in 7 people deep looking to get a free beer each (We had coupons from online) so we were prepping for some drunkin debauchery and were excited to get a few liters of beer each... well after we were seated in the hall and ordered our free beer we were serenaded by a pretty good umpapa band so we were feeling pretty good. When our beers came they were little 8 oz beers... I think a can of hofbrau was bigger than this beer; and I know that head is expected but it was half the glass.... ok it's free, what do you expect? Then when we tried it it was flat, like disgustingly flat. So we told the waitress who was surprised and told us that they hadn't had any complaints all day. They then brought over the manager Scott who proceeded to tell us that he's been drinking it all day and it's fine, and that the owner was drinking to and ""he's from Germany"", so our german friend who was with us asked if she could talk to him... Scott then told us that ""He's not here"".... after he left another waitress came over and asked which beers are flat, I pointed to the one in front of me... she picked it up, looked at it, then proceeded to take a swig of it... I told our waitress to pore it out. I later ordered a liter of my own... unbeknownst to me it cost $15... at least $3 more than at Oktoberfest and $7 more than Brats Brothers where I go to in LA.

After that we got our food which was pretty good, but was not as flavourful as I think it is when there's a high turnover rate, cause it was kinda slow so I imagine the less popular items had been sitting for a while, because it didn't taste fresh. 

Pluses are we had a friendly waitress Kathy, the Umpapa band was a good trio, but I was upset because they couldn't (note not wouldn't) play it because it was not on their play list, even though they knew it and I was willing to play it. I mean c'mon it was the song to play Oktoberfest 2011, just the Fliegan Song! They also stopped playing at 10:45pm, when the place closed at 11 and the staff were just staring at us the last 15 minutes as to eyeball us as to say (get the F* out we want to go home).... While I remember staying till the waiters were drinking with us after Oktoberfest... 

Over all felt really unwanted. Expensive. And not like Oktoberfest. 

I'm sure that during Oktoberfest this place is hoping, but what do you do for the other 340 days of the year? Give poor service and expect us to tip 20%? 

I won't be visiting again, nor will I be telling anyone to go OR tell anyone it's ""Just like Oktoberfest""....",_j1KnsWLVz3AU1mmm0G0JQ,0,0,1,cYsazLK6c7kT2EiOXn2ExA

Our visit to the Las Vegas was nice, we came in as Walk In and was seated right away. I really wanted to have the Pork Knuckles, but it was a specialty item that they only serve when it was ordered. I was devastated! But I quickly recovered trying to pick the very next best thing.... 

The Bavarian Potato Soup- Like a loaded baked potato soup minus bacon, but adding their smoked sausage. It was topped off with croutons and chives. 

Sauerbraten- Bavarian style potroast w/red wine. It was good, not as tender as I thought it would be, sauce was dark a bit on salty side which went well with the roast and spatzle. Yes spatzle! They look like gnocci pieces, but its noodles! Love them. 

Red Cabbage- Wasnt a fan, I tried it, tasted like caramelized overly sweet and vinegar red cabbage. I guess this is the Bavarian version of our American cranberry to Turkey dinner. 

Through our meal, there was a band playing and shouting out and drinking! It was Classic! Love it!  

Yes and the dessert! I had to get Apfelstrudel! Apple strudel! It was great!

Nice waitstaff, but 'service' is abnormally slow, even at off-peak hours. We watched one waitress flirt nearly continuously with a single table of patrons, as two other waitresses managed multiple tables (one appeared to have a majority of them and was doing the best she could while the other two were focused on some tables with heavy, heavy drinking going on). 

Basically it looked like the more you drink, the more attention you'll get from the waitstaff. Which I suppose makes sense, as that's where they're going to make most of their money as the booze aint cheap. 

Noisy as well. 

I've also been one previous time and have seen the house band. If you want a (relatively) quiet dinner while they're playing, you'll need to go to the beer garden.

- Good German beer
- Great service
- Like real German beer halls, you sit at long tables with other visitors. You make a lot of new friends from around the world

We though the plan was to meet for dinner. We had split up into smaller groups since we all wanted to do different things during the day. Well, a lot of the other groups decided they would eat first and just show up for drinks. Wish he had thought of that.

Beer was good, but expensive. My favorite was the seasonal winter ale. We had a lot of fun being loud, getting paddled by the shot girl, etc. However, no one else there was being loud or anything. The place was packed, but every other group was pretty subdued. The band was OK. I don't know much about German music so maybe they were more authentic or whatever, but their music didn't seem to get people going as much some bands I've seen at local Octoberfest events.

The place is what you and your friends make of it. We had fun and I would have given it a higher rating if the food and service had been better. I split a sausage platter with a friend. It was around $20 and we got 3 sausages. One tasted like an Oscar Meyer weiner.

Considering half of Texas, where I'm from, was settled by Germans, the food here did not live up to my expectations given the price point- but we have few restaurants turning out this cuisine here, so some inflation is to be expected.
$60 dinner for two, splitting a plate, an app, and a beer? Not really worth it, IMO. Quality was just not there for the majority of the items.

Kartoffelpuffer - Two crisp and golden brown Potato Pancakes served with smoked Salmon and traditional garnish; it's like going to a Jewish deli for breakfast and being torn between the pancakes and the lox, and deciding to combine them. Not bad, but pancakes aren't seasoned at all.  $15

Special Plate of the Day- pork loin served with two kinds of sausage, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, sided with gravy and mustard. Sausages weren't bad, one was considerably better than the other. Pork was unremarkable, as were the 'kraut and 'taters. $20

The beer. Good lord, I have no idea which beer my guy opted for, but we got the 36oz stein and it was huge but we drank it all without problem because it was light, smooth, and delicious. Complemented the sausages, as it's supposed to. HB prides itself on only importing beers that meet the traditional purity law, with simple, classic ingredients only. Mad hops, I mean props, to their beer! $16

The reason I can't tell you which sausage was the best is because service is mostly nonexistent. I guess if your basic couple is likely to spend $100, and most people tip 20%, you don't have to do much to get halfway decent pay by default.
Our waitress took our order, kitchen staff brought it out and took it away, waitress brought our bill. The end. Gave us a vague and rushed ""you good?"" as she walked by once, but otherwise did the bare minimum.
There was a featured dessert trio, but only one sounded appealing. Disappointed that they are unable to accommodate an order for a single dessert without spending $15 on the bunch of them.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,3,3,hAq41NlEamlrxJnM6I6YtQ

It's communal seating, and my wife and I were seated next to a quartet of German guys on a road trip throughout the western US.  At one point they went to talk to the Swiss band leader in German for a few minutes, and came back telling us they convinced him to play some conventional Oktoberfest music.  The band struck up a stirring, heavily accented rendition of Sweet Caroline, followed immediately by Take Me Home, Country Roads.  Our table mates lead the sing-along, swinging their liters of beer from side to side.  ""This is exactly what we sing at Oktoberfest!"" they exclaimed.  

Also, if you order a shot, the waitress delivers your spirit, then delivers a spirited paddle to your rear... as hard as she can muster.  My wife and I did not try it, but our German table mates partook at least 3 times (each).  They insisted paddling is NOT a German tradition, but is actually an American misperception of how scary and severe Germans are.  (True to this claim, we saw no paddling at the Munich Hofbrauhaus.)

Then the band played The Star Spangled Banner, and the Germans stood on top of the table chanting ""USA! USA! USA!""  So they were interesting to sit next to, and pretty drunk.  Also the first time I've ever heard the national anthem in a bar.

In terms of food, we tried the cheese spaetzel and chicken bratwurst - both were very good.  The pretzel was just OK -- too hard and not served warm.  I had a radler (beer cut with lemonade) since I wasn't trying to get too drunk -- also just OK, it was cloyingly sweet (I know, it's half lemonade, but an authentic radler has a subtler flavor).",AjsP4d4kx-NarVlduKtWYQ,0,0,4,avOnYpxUdosMHVK4UucwqA

First, the room is so noisy that you can't have a conversation with your fellow diners without literally shouting at each other.  There is a pretty even mix of crowd noise and live band music.  The band's sound was lost in the noisy room, but from what I could hear, they were not very good.  The seemed to alternate between trying to play German beer hall music and playing old pop hits...like CCR songs.  They need to decide what they are trying to be.

Second, when I went to pay the bill, I was informed there would be an extra fee of about 3% if I wanted to use my credit card.  Based on that alone, I will not be returning for another meal.",2yur9dbYINdaxroDYvVCJA,1,0,2,vTaewrQRWGjavOV45lJwtQ

Once inside the dining hall it was a little loud at first. There was a band playing Oompah music but there were in the midst of the ""raise your glass"" chant. We were seated at the traditional long wooden tables with benches. Comfortable enough. Our waitress was over quickly to take our drink orders. BEER! I had the original in a giant glass mug. It was perfect.

After a few mins we had figured out what we wanted from the decent sized menu. I had saurbraten that was awesome. My wife has the sampler with several different types of sausage and a pretzel. The food was delicious and went well with the beer. The band played the whole time and would occasionally get a little loud. It was all fun though. At one point the singer grabbed an Alpine Horn and went around playing that on each table in the place looking for tips. We gladly obliged. It was also quite funny to see some other ladies walking around with a large wooden paddle. Guys were lining up to get spanked. It wasn't super dirty or anything, which would have been bad because we had some kids with us. They all laughed at it and had a good time coloring and enjoying their kids dishes.

And that is coming from some people who love beer (my friends), and others (Jason and myself) who usually don't care for many types of beer. That was the highlight of the experience for us as far as I was concerned. 

The room was way too noisy to hold a decent conversation, but as the theme of the restaurant seemed to be ""drink beer and get drunk"", I guess I will let that slide. The waitresses were forced to wear these god awful costumes that were suppose to make them look like German bar maids but really just made them look frumpy, whether they were or not. And there was one poor decrepit 40 something who looked like she had prematurely aged due to partying to look more like she was 60, walking around with shots of Jager and a paddle that she was suppose to smack your ass with after you took a shot.

Now the food would have been good if it was served on a plane, but that's about in the quality range that I found it to be. They came out with the plastic covers on them which indicated that they had just been heated up and sent out for us rather than prepared fresh, and upon tasting there was no doubt. The mashed potatoes were the instant kind, my chicken breast was a flattened out patty of a thing, definitely frozen and refrozen a couple of times, and the gravy tasted like it came from a powder. 

They did have a good soft pretzel that they served with an awesome cheese dip, but at $10 for a pretzel, I could pass it up. 

My friends really liked the place though, even though one of them got the same exact meal that I did, only with beef rather than chicken... Maybe I am just expecting too much. Then again, he did have twice the amount of beer that I did. Maybe that's the secret to enjoying this place.

This place is huge, almost cavernous, with a loud, boisterous band playing in the front of the hall and long tables of reveling diners singing along. Both the food and drink menus are expansive, with plenty of sausage to go around. You can get beers in all different sizes, from the 1/2 liter to the full mug, and I bet you there's a boot option there somewhere. 

I'm not sure if all Bavarian dishes are like this, but it seemed like the ""Specialty"" ones offered at Hofbrauhaus include meat, carbs, and cream. Indeed, the Jagerschnitzel  that I got had those three components, as well as bacon and cranberries. The plate was the size of my head, and the pork was buried underneath a mountain of sauce and bacon. I think they made a mistake; I don't think this dish is meant for one person. The schnitzel was pretty good; it was well-seasoned and the bacon lent the right saltiness to the whole dish. It was nice having the noodles sop up some of the cream, and the cranberries also helped cut through some of richness. What makes a dinner here a real treat, however, isn't the beer and the sack of food you get. It's the rowdiness of the crowd, the whack of the paddle (you get one to the butt on your special occasion), the boom of the band, and a thousand other things that make this a truly unique experience.",Bv9C6zi0qmBXfJkO42iRAA,0,0,4,ZZghF1SAa5c1ChaCDh12FA

It's just plain fun.  

On a recent trip with said WOOgirls, my sadness at being kept from my beloved Hofbrauhaus overwhelmed and I had to stop in to pick up some food to take home to LA.  A few pretzels (gotta share with the hubs) and some spaetzle would do me just fine.  I got there 15 minutes before opening (couldn't find their hours online), and they unlocked the doors just for me.  Took my to-go order, churned it out quickly and with a smile.  AND they gave me extra spaetzle, just cuz they're nice like that.

Why not 5 stars?  Well... okay.  The bill for my to-go order came to $43 after tip.  I remember this vividly because it was a money-stressing weekend, and every expenditure's exact value is burned into my retinas.  Checking mint a few days later, I saw that Hofbrauhaus had charged me $48.  Yes, it's $5, but it's shady - and makes me wonder how often this might ""just happen"" here?  Of course, you can't really do much about something like that, because at that point it's their word against yours... so I let it slide, and choose to not let it ruin my love of the Hofbrauhaus.

Things to know, it's reaaaalllly loud, fairly expensive, and the food isn't necessarily outstanding. They have large tables, so if you have a small party you will likely be expected to share a table with strangers. With that being said, it's the ambiance that keeps us coming back. It's a very large restaurant with a boisterous and interactive live polka band, with waitresses in costume, where dancing on the table is encouraged! 

There were two of us on a Monday at 730pm and we were seated immediately at a table with another couple halfway through their meal. I've been here before on weekends and have had to either make a reservation or wait for a table. 

There were four types of beer to choose from and multiple sizes, though I must say the liter of beer is the way to go! Fun fact- if you purchase a shot of liquor they insist on swatting your behind with a large wooden paddle. They will line you up, make you bend over onto the table and smack you as hard as they can. It is outrageously painful but extremely hilarious! 

I had the vegetarian noodle dish, which seemed like their spin on macaroni and cheese. It was a very rich blend of elbow macaroni like noodles, Swiss cheese and onions. The portion was large and tasty, I ended up bringing half home. It comes with a side salad, which they failed to serve me. However I am just realizing this now as I look at their menu. 
We also ordered the grilled chicken breast with mushroom sauce and home made noodles. Also rich, but tasty.

2193971,2013-12-23,8,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Ok... I will just say this. I am of German descent. I love German grub. I love German culture. I love German beer halls. One of the last three things was not on target here =\

The guy playing the horns, downing beer, singing, while wearing traditional German leather pants was awesome. He definitely helped to liven up the atmosphere. However what made him even better was that he was having people play quarters for prizes, having contests for free beers (I won one, but was about to drive to LA and thus couldn't drink it) and I am sure he has many other things of a similar nature that I missed since we were there at lunch on a Sunday.

Pro Tip: I know Oktoberfest is going to be awesome here. Bavarian brau haus... ohhh yeah...

The murals, architecture, beer are all authentic. The food is a bit off though to me. I ordered the Oktoberfest Bratenteller. This is a double dish sauerbraten and pork roast. They each had a different gravy. The sauerbraten comes with a dark brown gravy with a slightly sour note due to the vinegar marinade that it left in for a few days. The meat is tenderized due to the marinating process and is done well. However the taste of the gravy seemed off to me. The pork roast was in a traditional German mushroom gravy. The pork was also tender but the taste wasn't on point to me again. It seemed that the gravy again wasn't like I am used to for most German food.  The pork roast mushroom gravy was also a much lighter shade than I am used to. However what had me crushed as that the spätzle wasn't that good. Spätzle is my most favorite part of German food. It is a noodle that when smothered in gravy is phenomenal. However here I felt it was anything but. =\   

Pro Tip #2: Most of the items in the gift shop are a weee bit overpriced ;)   so unless money is no object, I bet you can find that stuff cheaper elsewhere.

Service was kind of funky as well. The fraulein who was serving us, was somewhat inattentive and missed some basic things that the other waitresses did not. The details are what will make or break ya, and she forgot to ask if we wanted straws or lemon in our water when every other table had them delivered that way. She had a preoccupied air and was almost mentally checked out it seemed. 

Pro Tip #3: If you sign up for their online newsletter (on their website), you get free beer coupons!

Overall, I would come here for the bier, camaraderie, German culture, drinking songs... Heard the pretzels were good as well, but the grub perhaps would be better on a different day/night or perhaps I ordered the wrong item. I also disliked that we got there during lunch time and didn't receive a lunch menu but a dinner menu =\",f8W2Qv9QosVaP-dRQwLEyw,10,9,3,rIC-kZMFmOPltteaVfJSxg

I tried their special which was German roast pork with a nice crust to it, served with a beer gravy on top of a bed of creamy mashed potatoes with a side of hot pickled cabbage slaw with bits of bacon in it, which was a nice change from the usual  red cabbage slaw.  The food was large in portion and very filling.  The service was the downfall as we sat waiting for our server for 20 minutes before someone stepped in and realized they never showed up.

Just think... after a long 4-5 hour drive in the sun, what could possibly be better than a very large, very cold beer and delicious carbs and wieners? NOTHING. 

This time around we just indulged in beer and a pretzel. I always go for the dark, or the dunkel, which is rich but still refreshing and thirst quenching. The pretzel comes out warm, perfectly browned on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The pretzel comes with three dipping mustards - a sweet mustard, a cheesy delish whipped mustard and regular mustard. All three are great, and I don't even like mustard. 

The atmosphere couldn't get better. Friendly and welcoming, a very large and spacious room with fun German décor. I love the pretzels and lobsters painted all over the ceiling.

Hofbrauhaus is a Disneyworld-esque German-styled building close to Hard Rock Hotel. I wanted to try this place out for a while because of the charming facade outside.

We decided to head there to eat because it was in my head that it would be like a mini-trip to a sanitized Germany without the pricetag. 

When we entered, the place has the tired ambience of a hangover  complete with the loud, cacophony of a bad German folk band. Nobody was singing along with music, dancing or laughing... just downing a bunch of beer one after another.

Our waitress came by and took our orders dressed to... err... impress. She soon lost interest in our table however when we told her we weren't interested in alcohol. Ordered a Diet Coke/Pepsi which was not only flat but also tasted like there was some root beer mixed in there too.

I ordered the Sauerbraten which is supposed to be a roast pork dish with dumplings, vegetables and red wine sauce with red cabbage. We were surprised at how quickly the food came out of the kitchen. After we tasted our food , we knew why.

The food obviously was sitting under a heat lamp for way too long. Someone tried to disguise overly dry, salty pork with an overabundance of a lumpy, thick, red wine gravy. The dumplings were large, gummy and unappetizing. Vegetables were overcooked. The only thing that was okay on the dish was the stewed red cabbage.

My husband's schnitzel was dry and soggy. The gravy, it was swimming in, was bland. The potato salad was unpleasant, sour and overly warm.

This place is not cheap - a typical entree can be around the $20 mark - yet they do not provide you any value for your dollar given the quality of the ambience, service and food.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,6,2,1,zUsiYEQZ0GTvuYVAYuG1OQ

Came here with a few friends to tilt back a few German beers.

The crowd was very friendly and enjoying themselves.

You can actually have a great time in Vegas without gambling or clubbing.

From the live band to the chicken dance being performed by the crew... this place was hopping!  

Parking is easy but getting here and getting out is difficult as it is very close to the exit of the McCarran Airport. 

My favorite of all their beers is the Original.  It's very smooth and refreshing.

As for their food, their pretzel and bratwurst were the perfect combination.  The pretzel was heavily salted but I was able to offset it with the several dipping sauces.  The bratwurst was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor.

If you're into contests and love free beer, volunteer for their games!  You'll get a huge amount of beef for free, win or lose.

If you enjoy yourself, you can buy a little or big keepsake from their storefront. 

If you're looking for a place to celebrate any occasion or even get married, this is a great option.  They have a huge beer garden with a fountain as well as a patio.  

If you plan on drinking tons, be sure to take a taxi or uber.

Last time I was there, the band made their way around the restaurant with their instruments, and one of the guys hopped up on a table and played spoons like nobody's business.

If you're so inclined, a girl will come around and offer shots of Jager (or you can order them from your waitress).

Usually I only come here for going away parties or because out of towners want to celebrate all that is Vegas.  In my experience, the servers really push the large beers and shots, with spankings, which are about $7 a piece.  Let me explain.

A shot girl, or your server if you prefer, will bring you a shot of apple schnapps or Jager on a paddle.  You drink the shot and then they hit you in the ass with the paddle a few times.  

It's actually more organized than you would think.  The servers have always been meticulous about how the ""patron"" bends over to take their spanking, arm position, no wallets, etc. So, if the person is drunk, it takes a good five minutes to get them in the right position to get them spanked.  Usually about three spankings are given, but I've seen them do more if they don't think they hit you hard enough.  If everyone is in a fun-loving and/or abusive mood, then the spankings will add up (and the tips given to the spankers) pretty quickly.

Lots of songs, lots of singing, lots of stein holding contests and beer chugging contests.  Things can get ugly fast.  The restrooms are small, which seems incompatible with the excessive alcohol consumption encouraged, but I haven't seen any mishaps either. 

Food is ok.  We usually get the giant pretzels with cheese whiz.  Nothing special. 

Gratuity is always added onto the bill.  It's pretty obvious on the bill and the servers have always let us know, but that's something to remember in case your party is too drunk to listen or read.  Only go here if you are in a good mood and ready to have a good time.  Poopy pants will ruin it for everyone.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,2,2,3,5DDGETDUgWKx-au4HEVPug
2318868,2012-07-23,1,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"This review maybe a little biased because of how much fun I was having on this night, but I must say, this place is A GREAT TIME!

I had been once before for lunch with my parents when there was no band, no crowds, and hardly any beer drinking. 

On Saturday night, my girlfriend and I came here with a friend not knowing what to expect. We were wandering the gift shop waiting to be seated and all we could hear were screams and cheers and loud music and grown men screaming in pain as they are paddle spanked by adult women. WILLINGLY spanked by women with a large paddle. Hysterical. 

We were seated at a table right in front of the band where a group of four were already sitting, drinking, and having a great time. Immediately upon our entrance, the band asked everyone to stand up or stand on the tables for the National Anthem. Drunk people swinging their mugs around and shouting out their American pride! Such a funny experience! 

We immediately ordered beers and a pretzel. The Hofbräu Original beer was delicious! I am not a huge beer drinker, but this beer was smooth and had a wonderful light taste to it. We must have ordered at least 8 of them throughout the night. When the pretzel came out, it was huge and salty and soft and delicious. The dipping sauces (there were two different mustard and one cheese) tasted great, especially the cheese! It may have been because we were feeling a bit tipsy, but we really enjoyed the pretzel and the three of us ate it up in a hurry. 

My girlfriend and I shared the HB Riesenbratwurst, which was a slightly small sausage on a roll with sauerkraut and onion mustard. It tasted delicious! The sausage was a bit smaller than I expected, especially for the price, but the overall flavor combinations were wonderful. Again, this may be attributed to my buzzed taste buds, who knows? 

As the night progressed, there were many toasts made and many people brought up to the stage for chugging contests and songs and dances. People watching was the greatest and everyone was really friendly and excited to be there. 

Bottom line: it's impossible to not have a good time here on a Friday or Saturday night UNLESS you do not enjoy the following: making friends, loud music, toasts and drinking delicious beer, German horns, and some good old fashioned comradery.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,2,1,5,80QKISZNMAuTOOV49BiDGg

That of course, led to my not eating here for a long while, until recently when I tried it again.  The schnitzel was still terrible.  It is very heavily breaded and tastes like it has been sitting in oil.  Having eaten excellent schnitzel from San Diego to Munich and back, it is just not any good here, and I have given it plenty of chances.  That being said, other things are pretty good once I gave them a shot instead.  For starters, I love the giant pretzels, although to be fair, they are simply, giant pretzels.  I love pretzels.  Also, the sausages are tasty, as I enjoyed a sausage platter with a variety of wursts, and the potato soup is solid enough.  Down sides to this place are that it is super loud all the time.  I mean, super loud with the band playing and people shouting drinking songs constantly.  Also, it is expensive.  For what you get, it is pretty overpriced, although that is true of german food in general in town.  Bottom line, for a more festive and loud atmosphere with tons of beer and decent food, come here.  For more authentic and better german food, but without the party atmosphere and an almost depressing quiet in an older part of town, go to Cafe Heidelberg.

We ordered a pretzel, she rang up the fancy pretzel with all the sides($5 more expensive).    When my wife ordered a second drink, it literally took 20 minutes.

Great for groups as it's a beer hall type of venue with lots of long tables, super high ceilings with intricate paintings on it, and musical performers.

Service- Our server was fine, certainly not extraordinary.  I was expecting a little more enthusiasm, this is a beer hall after all!  We did have a coupon for a small free beer with purchase of an entree and we were able to redeem without any issues.  

Food-  The food was average.  Large portions, so expect leftovers or share plates.  They definitely missed the mark on the pretzel, did not taste fresh and it wasn't served warm.  The beer was excellent.

My brother asked why there was no sauerbraten on the menu. The waitress said it was on the dinner menu only. Later she returned to explain that it is because the dumplings that go with the sauerbraten take all day to cook. She offered to replace those dumplings with another side, but my brother stuck with the pork that he had ordered.

I thought the food was rather authentic in terms of offerings and taste. It wasn't just sausages like at most local German restaurants I've been to. The dishes reminded me of what I used to be able to get at old The Black Forest restaurant in Santa Monica.  Here, you can order schnitzel, sauerbraten, and schweinebraten. I chose the pork schnitzel which came with real spaetzle and cabbage. It was so yummy. My friend got the sauerbraten and it tasted like what I had in Germany. The meat was so tender and seasoned authentically. We also had pretzel to start and it was also delicious. 

A few minutes after sitting down, we heard a loud noise. We thought someone dropped a dish or something. We came to find out that the sound was from the waitress paddling a patron after the patron downed a jaeger. Apparently it's a thing here. That smack was loud.

I have always been very pleased with the beer and food selection, and this is one of the reasons that it's worth the mile and a half walk from the strip for me. I also like the live music in the German band, as that adds a nice touch.

The ambience is great in this restaurant, and if you have been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, you will appreciate how authentic and similar it feels and looks. They even have a beer garden area in the back of the restaurant, which even further completes the feel. They used a long wooden tables like in the original one, and you often times have other people/families sitting on the other end of the table, which is kind of fun, as long as they're not Yankee fans (yes, I'm from Boston.)

The beer selection is somewhat limited, but that's also the point: The beers are all the Hofbrauhaus selections, and they are all delicious. They offer the different sizes as well, in case you can't handle the big tankard size! I will tell you that you are crazy if you don't order the large pretzel with the three different dipping sauces... It's absolutely wonderful! Just don't try to eat it on your own, as it will absolutely be a carb overload for you. 

I do think the restaurant is overpriced, although it is also Vegas, so I understand. Making their drinks and food a bit more reasonable would probably drive more people here, though, especially considering that it is off the strip, and not as accessible to some people. If you are staying at the hard rock Hotel and Casino though, it is right across the street. 

Hi prices aside, I will continue to stop at this place when I'm in town, as it offers a different vibe, it's off the craziness of the strip, and it's just plain fun!",WHXBLnA7LE1ap2_KPoQKtQ,0,0,4,ei4XZjJTOpM7ivxzav90oA

This place is one big party! Great way to start a night and have dinner before you go out. A meal and a beer will run you $30-40 so it's a little on the pricey side but its Vegas!, That's not too bad at all compared to some other places.",mlnqX6MzQ0FxUbcVY782ww,0,0,4,-SN7dAFRUBJO9Cw-q6MKrg

Awesome German grub, pretty blond waitresses in authentic German garb (and they're nice, too!), and pretty much all the weiners and spaetzel you can eat. Cheap for the amount of everything you get, too. 

There's a live band most evenings, and it can be a little hard to hear, but that's why they serve massive quantities of beer. They WANT you to yell at the top of your lungs, get all red in the face, overheat, and then barf in the bathroom. Yes, yes, I did.

BUT not this time!  Normally I would rate it 5 stars, but this visit rates 2 stars at the most.  We visited on Dec. 28th, so it's in between Christmas and New Years.  We were there at night for dinner.  It really wasn't  busy at all, and there were many empty tables.  We were seated all the way in the back as we wanted a view of the band (which wasn't very good that night either).  We were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and WAITING for someone to at the very least take our beer order!  My husband had to get up and go to the front desk to ask them to PLEASE send someone to our table and help us.  Someone finally came to us and it may have been one of the managers.  She said that they had a large party over there (?!?) to explain the delay.  Whatever.  Like I said, it didn't seem very busy.  We've seen that place filled in the past.  She sent over a complimentary pretzel.  OK (more about that later).   A server came over to take our order.  We ordered full Bavarian style dinners.  Our dinners finally arrived.  Someone else brought the food to our table. He mumbled the names of the dishes.   I had forgotten the German name for my dinner order, but what was on my plate didn't quite fit the description.  So, another server came around and asked us what we had ordered.  Mine was supposed to be half pork roast and half sauerbraten.  I had my husband's dish and he had mine.  We finally got those switched.  The dinners were awful!  I have had Sauerbraten there for years, and that piece of meat was tough and flavorless.  The pork roast was very bland.  My husband ordered one of the ""special dinners"".  It was pork roast as well.  He said it had no flavor either.  Sauce was so so.  We do enjoy German food, and have had much better food served to us at Hofbrauhaus LV prior to our recent visit!  SO WE HOPE THIS IS NOT A NEW TREND FOR A DECLINE IN SERVICE AND FOOD QUALITY.  One last comment about that pretzel:  We took a photo of our steins of beers and the pretzel  right after they were served to us and posted it on one of our Facebook pages right away.  Then we immediately received a comment back about the photo from one of our ""friends"".  She commented:  ""Half of the salt on the pretzel is missing!""  (It was a little odd looking; like a few sections were rough and not evenly baked and browned like most pretzels are.)  I truly hope that this whole experience was a FLUKE.

Coming from a real German lover, this food does not resemble it by far. Its so salty, portions are small and bratwurst is awful.

We went to celebrate the departure of a coworker.  I had a glass of dunkel, and a glass of the lager.  The dunkel just didn't have enough flavor for me.  I preferred the lager.  I also had a $15 poached sausage.  For two sausages and a pretzel, it just wasn't worth it.  Sure, the imported mustard was good, but not worth the price.  In fact, for 14 people, our total bill was $750.  

I think next time we will try to go somewhere worth that kind of money to spend.  It is a fun place, that is for sure.  You can buy a shot of Jagger, and you'll get spanked along with it.

I did enjoy a Weizen and it was as it should be, cold but not half frozen like beer seems to be served here. 

I had a Wiener Schnitzel and some Potato salad. The Schnitzel was rather big and was served with a lemon, which is good, and some sort of berry concoction, which I have no idea what that was all about... Never seen such a thing, it is not something that goes with a Schnitzel. The potato salad was cold, thank you Lord. This hot potato salad thing is just unnatural.

Then there was the great German Polka Band, absolutely German, you could tell by the accents. 

The hostesses, uhm, well if you have nothing nice to say, then keep your mouth shut... so, no comment.

Their idea of communal seating here is that they will bring to you a table they pick out for you. After what criteria remains to be the great  unknown. While the hostesses talk a lot, they don't seem to talk to the guests or answer questions of any kind, oops, I wasn't going to say anything. 

Only encountered one German waiter (most of the wait staff is female and American). Nice if you have some folks that actually speak German in a German establishment. 

Something really weird is going on here. Apparently folks are happy to bend over the table to receive a whack on the behind with a paddle... Why? What is that all about? I know for sure this is not a typical German thing. Try to have me pay for a meal and then whack me on the behind and there will be a fight... good grief and people are asking for this?

Its a German Ale House with a great Bavarian menu.  The Hof has family style seating which basically means bring your Family or if you don't have a family to bring, prepare to be introduced to a replacement family for your meal. As luck would have it, Simone and I went for lunch around 2:00pm and the place was almost empty so we didn't have to worry about being social with the sin city natives. After much analyzing of the menu we decided to start with the ""Obatzer"" appetizer. Lucky for my waitress she didn't have to worry about my total butchering of the German language as there were numbers that went along with each menu item for ease of translation. The ""Obtazer"" is a hand made warm German pretzel served with a Brie Cheese and Buttered Onion Dip. The dip was rich and creamy and totally went with the pretzel. There was dip left over after the pretzel was gone so the wife and I very elegantly stuck the rest on top of our knives and proceeded to stick it down our throats. Although the choking seemed to be distracting to the other guests we definitely enjoyed our appetizer down to the last knife full.
For the entrees Simone ordered the ""Allgaur Kasespatzle"". It was a German style Mac and Cheese made with mini German Spaetzle dumplings, Swiss, Brie, and again, those luscious buttered onions. It was creamy and rich with just the right amount of onion flavor. Although Simone could not finish it, due to the earlier appetizer gluttony, i gladly helped her out. For my own entree i choose the ""Nurnberger Rostbratwurst"". The dish consisted of 3 grilled Bratwurst resting on a bed of fresh sauerkraut and mashed potatoes with a beer gravy. The flavors went together perfectly and complimented each other well. The Potatoes were creamy with a hint of Garlic , the brats were seasoned perfectly, and the sauerkraut was just sour enough but didn't overpower the dish. I completely cleaned the plate and also finished off my side of fluffy spaetzle drizzled in butter and parsley.  My only regret about this meal is I had no more room in the stomach for German beer or dessert. I will definitely try some when I come back during my next Vegas Visit.

Whether you like it or not will be depend on what you're looking for when you walk in the door.  We were seated in the main dining hall and I have to say that place is LOUD.  Its not a good place to have a conversation - as a matter of fact I applaud you if you can actually have a conversation over all that noise.  Even when the band isn't playing its noisy.  I was at the end of the table and had to have others repeat what the waitress was saying because I couldn't hear her from 6 feet away.

That being said its definately a fun drinking place.  The band mostly played German beer hall songs but sometimes they'd sneak in a Sweet Caroline or a Jimmy Buffett song. 

We were a party of 6; we all ordered different things and we all were happy with our meals.  I'm not a beer drinker so I didn't sample anything but there seemed to be a good selection.

As others have said, it can be pricy depending on what you order.  I had a chicken sandwich and iced tea and my bill (incl tip) was just over $27.

2669989,2010-07-09,3,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Once upon a time in a far away land there lived a boy that could celebrate Octoberfest no more than one month a year.  He would order seconds and thirds of his favorite schnitzel and bratwurst dishes, fill his gullet with authentic German bier till he couldn't walk and toast the night away with good friends as the polka band would play his favorite drinking songs.  He would wake up the next morning with a pounding in his head, his voice gone from singing at the top of his lungs and sounds of accordions and tubas resonating in his ears.  Just to do it all over again night after night until the festival was no more.  He would have to wait another long and uneventful eleven months until the magic would return. Until now.

The moment you walk through the door you can't help but smile and think to yourself,""It's party time"" or in my case,""lets get Fing Fed up"".  The band is rocking, or as much as a polka band could rock, the crowd is rowdy, and I mean dancing on top of tables rowdy and bent over getting spankings from jager girls rowdy. The waitresses have German accents, and I mean real accents, not BS fake medieval times accents. 

Waiter: ""Would me lord wisheth more ale""
Me:""Cut the crap Sir D Bag and get me a beer."" 

I also love how this place forces you to socialize.  You can't ask for a table for two and expect a quite romantic dinner.  Your seated at large picnic style benches perfect for standing and splashing beer on.  

OK so now on to the food.  The dinners are not too pricey the couple times I have been I have spent about $16 a plate.  I usually get the Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl it consist of 3 pork sausages with sauerkraut, mash potatoes and gravy.  Dudes, believe me when I tell you, this stuff is absolutely amazing.  If you're only experience with bratwurst is something you get out of a package from your local piggly wiggly, forget everything you thought you knew and get ready for the pork epiphany.  Every bite you take will open new doors of flavor and flavor combinations.  If your anything like me and like to drink as much as you like to eat you will actually end up spending more money on beer than you will on food.  Last time I was there I had 3 liters of beer, one of the dunkelweizen, one of the hefeweizen and one pilsner.  The dunkel was my absolute favorite out of the three.  So all in all if your looking for a place to get rowdy, dance on top of the tables, take shots of jager, get spanking from jager girls as well as get a top notch meal in the mean time look no further.",AoII0-uM9z0EesGnb9YCjQ,3,3,5,TklwtR5CZ7PVpqANIKPigQ

The food is very good, all of it German/Bavarian sounding, looking, and tasting. At least I thought so, but the two real Germans (what! Germans in Vegas? kidding) sitting next to us said it wasn't like at home. (They didn't say that it was not as good, just not the same. Ha ha!) Yes, sitting next to us, because seating is beer hall style, at long tables, next to whoever you get planted next to. So if you don't have a big group, your are going to make some new friends.

So what he heck did those two Germans know, anyways? Well, more than me. Besides the food thing, then knew the words to the songs better than I did. At one point the band ... yes you could have guessed it, three guys in leiderhosen ... struck up the national anthem ... we all rose, put our hands over our hearts, and sang ... well the two Germans didn't but hey, it's not their anthem, right? Right after the anthem the band charged straight into John Denver, Johnny Cash, The Monkeys, and Neil Diamond I think. Everyone just kept singing, whether because of the mood or the beer or cause everyone else was. And that's where the two Germans put us to shame because they knew the words better.

The beer is good. And it comes in liter steins. Nuf said.

At to top it off, there's a beautiful blond walking around serving up Jägermeister shots and spankings with a large wooden paddle. (Just to be clear, the paddle was for the spankings ... the shots came from what looked like test tubes.) I don't know if this is a Bavarian thing or a Vegas thing (probably the latter), but it sure got the attention of the spectators and the participants (especially the latter).

The decor is fantastic, and even the celings look the same!  The only difference I noticed is that the original has breathalizer machines in the restrooms, whereas they are conspicuously absent here in Vegas.  :)  You'll just have to guesstimate how drunk you get.

One comes to Hofbrauhaus for the beer, and it certainly does not disappoint.  My favorite is the dark beer, but the wheat beer is the real star:  If you have ever consumed some half-assed American knock off at a wheat beer, you'll see why the brewery even tried!  (I.E. The German stuff is goooooood!!!!).

I've had a few food items here, and they were good.  I woudl highly recommend the 1/2 chicken with potato salad.  

When this place is rocking, the atmosphere is the best.  The table setup and beer hall format really liven the place up.  You are likely to be seated next to folks you don't know, so half the fun is making friends while drinking copious amounts of beer.

The bar area up front is a bit more chill, and you can even watch the game on the 3 plasmas.  They also have a back dining area that is more suitable to families (it is away from the Polka band and not filled with drunken idiots like me).",Ic2wLF5mxzu6VrcV46gCOA,0,0,4,SyrDAA-CDbVnBtFn58LgzA

They really do the German thing well, pretzels, spetzels and sausages a plenty. Oh yes and beer and spankings, yes spankings. If you are the S&M, Christian Grey loving person then this is the place for you. Apparently if you order a shot of this dark liquor (Perhaps Jagermister?) you get a spanking by a waitress in a laderhousen (That Hansel and Gretel outfit with suspenders). This I did not indulge in, but many many men around our table did. We went late in the evening so the giant dinning room was emptying out so I assume we didnt get to see all the possibilities of spanking. Okay so the important stuff- the food. I ordered a white sausage dish at the recommendation of the waitress, interesting. I am not a huge sausage fan, but since I was here the sausage kingdom, figured I should try it. It came with potatoes and sauerkraut. I also of course drank a lot of beer and perhaps if I drank more the food would have tasted better. We also ordered a traditional pretzel with cheese dip and mustards, now that was tasty (The beer probably helped with this). I am not going to lie the German dinners that shared our table and the authentic German band probably helped me like this place more, it certainly wasn't the food.  So all in all, I would come back to drink and eat pretzels, not to eat. So drink up! Das boot!",aioz8aFguWO2_q-ZNoPRmg,1,0,2,-L95KU88PLu_vIeGqTDHwg

Even though I asked for my sausages to be grilled... there were no grill marks to be seen, and the outside didn't have any hint of a crust. 

Another huge flaw in my book is that their pretzels weren't warm! Cold pretzels are hard and chewy! If they had just toasted them a bit, it would have made a world of difference.

Food?  3 stars, bratwursts and schnitzels and obaszter, Oh my!

Drinks?  4 stars... ONE... LITER... BEERS.  I had two in about a half hour.

Fun?  5 stars.  Mona.  You reeled back and swung that paddle at my tush like it was a home run derby!  You said I must be used to eating sausage.  You called me a p*ssy for only throwing down 2 liters of beer.

I think I'm in love with you.

[end teaser]


============


For starters, out party of twenty had the simple and accessible pretzel appetizer; a huge, coarsely-salted, baked pretzel served with dipping mustard (one tangy, one sweet) and a tasty obaszter cheese... This appetizer was unremarkable but appropriately festive for the beer drinking that would soon ensue...

As the fiery-spirited and lovely Mona made her rounds taking drink orders, our party would erupt into booing and jeers toward the few who ordered anything less than the 1-liter stein of beer, often harassing them into ordering big... I opted for the 1-liter dunkelweiss, a dark bier, toasty @ 5.5% alcohol.  Oh, if only they had the Maibock at the time (7.1%)!

The menu offers a varied selection of Bavarian dishes, many to do with wursts.  Most were of two varieties; either wursts(sausages) served in sandwiches (w/fries) or wursts plates (usually with cabbage, or potatoes - mashed or salad).  A number of dishes present the sausages afloat in a small cauldron of simmering beer/broth... tasty, but visually unappealing, IMO.  I went with the Riesenwurst, a grilled sausage with sauerkraut, served on french bread... 

Making up for having slept through this part of the Vegas trip last year, I chug'd chug'd chug'd away, finishing my liter first, raising my empty glass to applause and laughs.  But as I reveled in my accomplishment, a dirndl-dress clad Mona would set down another liter in front of me... slack-jaw'd and puppydog-eyed, I looked at her.  Her response?  With a wink and a smile, she says ""Come on, I can put down 5 of these...""

Somehow I got through it.  2 liters of dunkelweiss.  One riessenwurst and sauerkraut sandwich.  A pint of Summer bier.  

Then she looked at me, ""... another?""
""Oh dear gawd, no, please!"" I stutter.

She smirked and walked away.  I guess we weren't NEAR done just yet.

And then came shots of apple brandy served on a wooden paddle... and the paddling.

Yes, paddling.

With me bent over the end of a table, Mona reached into my back pocket to take out my wallet, insuring nothing would get in the way...  Twenty friends counted her down.. ""one"", ""two"", ""THREE!""... as she swung for the fences... THWACK!!  I didn't flinch, but it hurt like crazygood!  

Like crazy... good.

I asked for another.

It's a Bavarian German mess hall with bench seating and bosomed bar maids and boots of booze!

My favorite imported brews are served in giant glass steins with strong heft to them.  Dunkel brau ist mein favorite.  Strangely enough I find a connection with my 3rd generation removed Germanic bloodline to be very intoxicating at Hofbrau.  Decorated in faux old fatherland fixings.  The atmosphere is most inviting and exiting as you are transported to the old castle days reminiscent of lederhosen and clogs.  Think St. Pauli girl in practice.  Various Germanic accents abound they really have a knack for the ""Vegas recreation"" feel here.

The traditional brats wieners and Vienna sausages on order are accompanied quite stoutly with the beers on tap and the pretzels and bitter sides with sauerkraut are an attestment to the dedication to the stout beer this culture has dedicated itself to throughout history.  In other words everything on the menu tastes much better with a glug of beer.  Seriously not knocking the taste of the food in general, but much like most European countries the cuisine is somewhat mated to the alcoholic beverage of favor.  You seriously can't fully appreciate the food with out the drink.  Sour goes great with stout. 

The entertainment is live and seemingly imported as well.  Lively stereotypical lederhosen wearing front man singing and commanding communal cheers throughout the meal.  It is a good idea to keep the large steins filled.  Raise a glass.  Shout an old world cheer.  Take a big drink and slam the glass on the table.  What medieval fun.  Sure to find yourself tipsy you may be ordered a Jeager paddle with assorted shots from which you will be challenged to gullet down in concession and afterwards the bar maids will give you one Hell of a brutal paddling for being a bad boy!  Old drinking game contests may be held from the band and you can possibly get a glass stein for winning.

Major fun can be had at the Hofbruahaus!  Make sure to stagger into the gift shop afterwards and check out the great trinkets mugs and grab a six pack of the great beer for your hangover in the morning.

As a two-time veteran of the real Oktoberfest, the Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas does its best to mirror a traditional Bavarian beer tent, and it almost succeeds - we have to remember we are in America and no matter how hard we try, we can't get as wild as our European cousins without shanking someone and the SWAT team is called in - aside from that, the polka band is great, the stein-holding contests are a hoot, and there are people standing on the wooden benches.  The crowd is fun, lively, and LOUD - another staple of Oktoberfest. 

The menu here is almost identical to the ones in Germany, though I don't recall seeing pig's knuckles.  The servers are dressed in traditional costume, complete with tightly-corseted boobies spilling out for your viewing pleasure.  There is the expected portrait of King Ludwig II on the wall, and there is Lederhosen, naturally.  A nice touch was the band playing the Star Spangled Banner - which I think was an old British drinking song before F. Scott Fitzgerald's ancestor changed some of the words around. 

I got the jagerschnitzel, which was excellent, though I will say the Spatzle was a bit blah - the kind I had in Regensburg at the Goldene Ente was the best (yeah, I'm a snob and a name dropper, what of it!)

Also, the steins for sale here in the gift shop are also cheaper than the ones offered up in Germany.  If Lufthansa is not your airline of choice, head over to Vegas - it's ALMOST the same, and you will have a good time.",8eQ7LmOK6KeSRXq_o8KaAw,0,0,4,T0cku7l7BAWNYQVU8a5YNA

Hofbrauhaus is cheesy, it's a tourist trap, it's priced for out-of-towners (read: expensive).  That said, on a Friday night, it is one of the best places in town to go if you want an energetic crowd enjoying themselves and lots of good beer.  

No, it's not a perfectly authentic German beer hall (then again, the Paris casino is not a perfect replica of French culture).  It's an impersonation.  A frat-boyish impersonation of a German beer hall.  Diners are seated on wooden benches at communal tables and served lots of beer (in massive, heavy mugs or an uber-expensive glass boot).  The polka band plays at night and sparks congo lines, drunken feats of strength and constant sing-alongs.

As for the negative reviews, I will agree that the food is mediocre, consisting mostly of fried meats or some form of sausage.  The prices are at ridiculous ""bilk the tourist"" levels.  That's why such a fun place only ranks at three stars for me. 

But Hofbrauhaus isn't built to be a place you'd go on a regular basis.  It's built to throw a drunken party.  A party where you get intoxicated enough to forget how much you're paying.

If you go there, know what you're getting into.  It's loud.  Hella loud.  Fun loud.  Lose yourself loud.  And if you have a designated driver and no responsibilities in the morning, it's a great place to play tourist (i.e. bring a group for drunken antics and lose several years of emotional maturity).",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,3,2,3,nWZiA1uqrRxvkc8buMThFw

We were in the back and I think when we go back, I'll request seat farther up front, so I can hear the band better.

Thanks to our awesome tour guide Susan R., she introduced us to this place when we vacationed here in Vegas at the holidays. I think we asked what unique part of Vegas in that we the tourists don't know about. This was one of the place she suggested that was slightly off the strip.

To the drivers, you will need to be a little bit more careful as one portion of the street is an one way street in front of the parking lot. There are no issues with parking at this facility, but will have some anger management issues as the space to back up is very narrow. Avoid these clowns with some patience when you are trying to back out.

On a cool Monday night, it was very festive as we were seeing live performances of a cool Oktoberfest band dancing and singing. Like all German beerfest, they seemed to like long tables with picnic bench seats as a way to dine. The restaurant like a big cafeteria with benches in a conference hall. They have a very high ceiling where I can imagine a circus performing here on an off day.

To start off, we have one of their big pretzel special we had to try according to our waiter. He suggested this as they don't have this special often. The pretzel was huge and the three of us almost didn't finished that off. Lovely soft tender thing with the right dip tasted better than your Auntie Anne's soft pretzel.

I think I ordered the Nrnberger Rostbratwrstl which was a three roasted Pork Sausages with sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes  Believe me when I say that with a mug of beer, this thing would totally blew you away. These delicious suckas are roasted to succulent tease that can melt in your tongue.

Of course I had to weasel out by ordering root beer as I was already plastered earlier in the day with plenty of vodka drinks at the casinos.

Oh, please don't be a wuss by ordering burgers. You came all the way to this place and you knew this is a German sausage house and yet you still want to order burgers? Shame on you!

For the veggie lovers out there, they don't want to leave you out because they offering soups and salads to keep you from your meat eating significant others enjoying some good food. They want to make sure everybody is happy here.

The place is so happening, they decided that restaurant was not good enough so they add in a gift shop right in front of the entrance. Very clever of them to extract more money from you on the way out.

A real fun time that is better than Medieval Times or a Ninja sake tasting at a wine garden. Give this place so love as they also have a kids menu to bring your whole family to enjoy this unique experience.

It may not be the same beerfest as in Germany, but it come very close with their offerings and performances. The only thing I wish they had was having Helga bring the beers to us.

- Beer as good as Hofbräuhaus in München
- Food was disappointing
- Location feels touristy and takes away from authenticity

I have been to the Hofbräuhaus in München, Pittsburgh, Newport and now Las Vegas. I would have to say I love me some Hofbräuhaus! The beer is without a doubt the most crisp and clean beer that is the epitome of German beers brewed under the German beer purity laws (say that ten times fast).

As for this place it in ever sense of the word the most water down version of the original Hofbräuhaus in München. The location doesn't give this church of beer justice, it adds the Vegas grime and it ends up feeling like it is robbed of its authenticity. The pretzel was great! but the lack of mustards was disappointing, usually there is regional addition that can be added to your pretzel (ex/ awesome beer cheese in Pittsburgh), in Vegas you get some cold cheese spread...

I get that this is a Vegas themed resturant but they should try to come at least close to the original. The jager scnitzel I had was bland and chewy and at $20 should have been way more flavorful than it was considering it was a small piece of meat with a tiny portion of spatzle. The spatzle wasn't bad and was pretty close to what I had in Germany but had the taste like it was made a few days ago and not fresh.

The real negative part of this is that we had a group of 16 and even though we had a reservation got slammed into a table that had a bunch of dudes on a bachelor party snuggled up way too close.

The worst part was at the end somehow with an average price of about $30 per person spent on food and drink (pre-tax and tip) we all ended up needing to throw in $60 each to make it work after tax and tip (they wouldn't split the tab). Seems like we got over charged but with a group that size it was hard to determine how that happened.

Luckily, Hofbräuhaus serves it on Fridays and Saturdays so now I can plan that trip to Munich later. Since there were three of us we signed into yelp and checked in. After we checked in we each got a free 10oz beer of our choice said we tried the Original, the Dunkel and the hefeweizen. My favorite was the dunkel so I ordered a liter of that. We shared the large pretzel which was really good. Soft in the middle and good texture on the out side. It has s served with two types of mustard and a cheese dipping sauce.

I don't know what it was, but the bratwurst and sauerkraut, along with a huge stein of beer to wash it down was amazing.  Also, you walk outside and you're in downtown Munich, with all of its culture.

One time when taking a cab back to the Vegas airport, I saw this spot and was again enamored.  On my next trip, my friends and I went there for lunch.  The food and beer was once again top notch.  I think they must fly everything in from Germany or something.  However, the atmosphere was another story.  It didn't have the same energy level that the Munich location had.  Also, their attempts at creating a local experience (having performers on stage) seemed more like Disneyland than actually being in Germany.  To top it off, the location sort of sucks.  While its ok if you want to drive, its pretty far off the strip.  Everyone knows that when you go to Vegas, you want to be right by the strip.

At least the Carnegie Deli was smart in selection a Vegas location right at the Mirage.

I had to take a few months to gather my thoughts in order to not be too cruel.  I wanted to yelp the moment I came back from this place, but I felt it'd be most ""fair"" if I wasn't as steamed.

So where to begin - oh yes.  Over priced boots.  We asked from the beginning what the cost of a boot was.  $20 is what we kept getting from ""A"" our waitress (I'll save her name - she was sort of nice). We signed this slip of paper that said boot was not replaceable if broken and beer was extra. Fine. So we asked how much the beer was. Again, kept hearing $20. I said, ""I'll just have the mini boot."" ""Just get the regular one...it'll be the same price."". Maybe it's my fault for assuming she was taling about the beer, but I guess she was talking about the boot. Some birthday paddle shots, dancing on the bench, and a few hours later...the bill comes. Boots cost us about 75 each!!!!!! Are you kidding? I mean we knew we had to pay for the boot and beer but calc'd it to about $40...not nearly double. So whatever we had a good time, were a bit peeved, but paid the bill. However, we just wanted to know why it cost so much and felt appropriate to ask...so we asked. That led to pointing fingers..we said we understood and wanted to just let them know for future customers' sakes. It boiled down to the confrontation of the manager and owner. Poor management...no solution rather kept adding to the problem. They even threw the waitress under the bus and blamed her for our unhappiness. Well now they just added on to it. The best part was when they wouldn't let us leave with beer in our boot. Damn, I paid 75 I better be a ble to take it out! Plus we were in Vegas!!!! By the hardrock!!! Not like we were in the boonie outskirts. After so much fighting with the management, we stormed out to the words, ""we're gonna call the cops!""

I said, ""Go ahead!""

Ironically we saw some cops outside and they never stopped us for our alcohol. In fact, thet were fascinated by the beer and asked where we got it. I said, ""down the street but don't go there. The management is awful!""

Sigh. I still get heated. I think my comic relief was their attempt at making it better by giving us a round of Jaegar. No thanks. Second comedy act was the sweet fobbish Filipina lady who asked if I'd pay her bills if she got fired because I would walk out with alcohol.

He agreed, and without letting any of the other 20 people know, half of whom had already eaten, know what was happening, they put the order in. It turns out the food is about twice as much per person ordering this way, and because half went hungry it ended up being 70 per person, before even adding the cost of beer.

At times it got quite loud and was hard to speak or hear the people next to me.

Since this was my first experience with German food the bar has been set High. I will definitely be recommending and returning to this restaurant.",WYnRx1ZArsYAjw5eiT7SKA,2,0,4,eqjvHRpHM2aImN9AAmNfoA

great. Hofbrauhaus is german restaurant with a beer hall and a beer garden both awesome. We dined in the beer garden which is made to look like your outside With the blue sky and trees etc. You think your outside but your not.
Being a Saturday night the place was jumping with great live music.
They had a beerstein holding contest which was fun to watch.
The whole atmosphere is like one big party for both young and old.
 As for the food and beer it's very good and I've been to Germany many times.
We tried the Nuenberer Rostbratwurst (3 sausages with sauerkaut and
mashed potatoes ) $13:95 yum.
The Wiener Schnitzel (breaded pork culets with cranberries and homemade Bavarian potato salad ) $18:95 was Huge and enough for two.
Almost every table ordered the Jumbo pretzel ( with cheese and two kinds of mustard) $12:95 pricy but so good and a great starter to share.
All the beer is imported from German and served in huge beersteins.
The staff and servers all dress in old time german outfits that look cool.
I've saved the best for last the ( PADDLE GIRLS ).
The paddle girls are servers who bring you a shot that someone has sent you and after drinking it you bend over and get spanked.
This goes on all night with screams and cheers from the crowds of guest
enjoying the fun.
Hofbrauhaus will be opening their first California restaurant in cupertino. It will open  this coming June in the Valco mall .

We walked into the enormous beer hall with people dancing on the tables, weaving around the room in dancing chains and singing at the tops of their lungs. The band looked like a traditional German band, but instead of belting out the German classics that no one knows, they were belting out Neil Diamond and other classic American hits that we all know and can sing too. 

There were chugging contests and the lederhosen clad star waiter laid down on his back, on a table and played a 10 foot  Ricola style horn - I am not kidding.

The beer is awesome and the food is yummy and authentic, albeit a little mass-produced.

If you want some good ol' Bavarian beer hall fan, I can't think of a better place to go outside of the real thing. They really went all out replicating the original.",ivEai27DRDFUoTqRhEGvnQ,0,1,4,ZdmSJ8uJ5mwQDfSSoBY08A

I had never experienced it, so I decided to give it a whirl.  We showed up and all the servers are in costume.  I love that!  Some people might think it's lame, but I personally think it adds to the experience!  

Huge beers? Yupp, my version heaven!  The beers were good, big, and flowing all night!  We spent quite a long time drinking and snacking the night away!  Their food?  Just as good as the beer!! Since my bestie and I are both equally indecisive, we decided to split two of their main dishes.  We got the burger and the chicken sandwich.  Both were AMAZING!  The meat combination in the burger had the perfect flavor and made it stand out compared to other burgers I've had in this city.  The chicken sandwich was perfectly crispy and I enjoyed every second of it.  

It wouldn't be a complete German experience without getting a pretzel!  Just as enjoyable as our main dishes.  

Having the german music in the background, great food, and good service... this place earns its 4 stars.  It's a bit pricey, which makes me upset because I can't afford to go there more often.

I've come here twice. Once for beer, which was great and fair priced for the quantity, and another time for the food. We ordered the sampler tower that came with three tiers of food. It was more than enough food to feed me and another person.

In actuality, the food is what really propels my rating of Hofbrauhaus to a five star. The sauerkraut and red cabbage are amazing. The spaetzle was especially fantastic. Overall the food reminded me of what I would have gotten back in Germany (I studied there for a summer). Truly amazing. I believe this ran about $20? So $10 for two.

My only gripe is with the waitress. We had gone during the holiday season, and she kept trying to hustle us to buy merchandise. Apparently the staff was having some type of competition. She kept hard selling t-shirts, mugs, and everything else to us when we had told her we weren't interested at the very beginning. It was actually very desperate and awkward. After our final decline it looked like she was pissed and then indifferent to servicing us at all haha. One of the stranger waitress experiences I've encountered in a very long time.

I just didn't get that here, sure they had the silver wear in the cup on the table, and the menu had many of the same items, and they had the beer and the large maB... but it just wasn't the same.

It was way more expensive, the same large pretzel the girls walk around with for 2 euro at HBH, was charged as $15 with some mustards... the wurst plate lacked the 5th wurst, and the ones that were there tasted nothing like the ones in germany (and wtf is with the huge fat wurst... not uniformed in size with the others).  Where is my favorite half roast chicken? Where is my pig knee? 

I really wanted to like this place, I wanted direly to find something to love, but it just wasn't there. The beer tasted different ( how ever it did have the right type of yeasty head ). The band did ein Prositen all wrong (and ask anyone who has been to HBH or HB Festival Tent at Bavarian Gardens during Oktoberfest you will never forget the way it is supposed to be sung).

The waitress was nice, the food was way over priced. My GF and I had: 1 Beer, 2 x Sausage Plates, 2x order dumplings and a pretzel for $90... We could have eaten at far better places for that.  I really really wanted to like it, but I left feeling empty hearted.

The only (and perhaps most important) noteworthy offering was their beer selection.  It was all authentic, fresh, delicious, and served in the proper glasses.

The pretzel was authentic tasting but rather stale (i.e, at least a day old), which is inexcusable.   Furthermore, we had to pay an extra $2 for ""authentic Bavarian"" mustards (sweet and spicy).  Neither was remotely German.  In fact, I saw them use Gulden's for the spicy mustard.  Big, early fail in my book.   

The Käsespätzle was mediocre at best.  Very dry and starchy.

The Schweinsbraten lacked the typical richness in both meat and beer sauce, and also tasted about a day old, or as if it came from a cheap buffet steamer tray.

The lentil/sausage soup was quite authentic and rich tasting, but that dish considerably less difficult to mess up.

Ambiance in the bier hall was extremely jovial and loud, making it hard to order or talk - which is expected and entirely OK.

The decor resembles Munich's famous Hofbrauhaus, for sure. While the Vegas climate is too hot to mimic a traditional biergarden, they have a beer hall inside, surrounded by a landscaped indoor biergarden, as well as more drinking rooms.

This location obviously caters to tourists. It's across from HRH and UNLV, so the crowd here is typically younger.

They import their beers from Munich. I believe they even brew some on-site.

The food was good, but my only complaint was it was very Americanized. Last I checked, fries were not part of German cuisine.

If you buy a shirt, you can get paddled. I got paddled and it was AWESOME.

The MC- who was quite the entertainer- was rallying people up to partake in a quarters style game with winners walking off with a coveted half liter of beer.

The selection of food was traditional German faire. I don't eat sausages, but they had a decent selection of other meat choices including a veggie option. The beer is traditional Bavarian imported directly from Munich. They have only 2 restaurants in the US with the other being in St. Petersburg, Florida. I felt fortunate I be able to experience this one.

The most impressive item at Hofbräuhaus was the humongous Bavarian pretzel, which I had to order. And the two mustards they served alongside were divine.

I'd recommend HB if you are looking for a unique experience off the strip. And you like beer. And of course pretzels! Prost!",UE2GqEwsKQgxFT6VgKCEbw,1,1,4,MyGVBcOWXA6EN4AulFacHA

total authentic german beer hall, or so i was old by friend's german wife seeing that i've never been to germany, but again i digress.

there's long wood benches where you pretty much sit down close to the other dining guests.  but everyone is super friendly and the place is pretty lively at all hours.  everyone is just drinking, singing, cheering with each other, and having a great time.  the waitresses are the coolest and apparently will lay the smack down with the paddle they keep handy.

they fly in their hef straight from germany and it comes in it is served in giant beer steins, just the holy grail of goodness.  best hef ever.  the taste is just phenomenal and the dangerous part is that it goes down like bud light.

the food is awesome.  got to get the giant pretzel to go along with your hef.  had the ribeye last time and it was just fantastic.  the one minor drawback is that for a beer hall its kinda pricey.  we always end up with a bill of more than $50 a person, but i think that's mostly because the steins of hef run about $15.  but its well worth the money.

bottom line is that you definitely need to come here when you're in vegas.  its right across from the hard rock which is another place you should be visiting so here's your chance to kill two birds with one stone.  cheers.",vekGsN7QGHo7gelmVSbOig,0,0,5,qbd_FPYRPRvamkC0V4i--g

Sunday lunch is not really crowded at all.  I suppose the high ceilings of the beer hall make the place seem emptier than it is.  There were probably 25 people or so here.  Live entertainment consists of a guy in lederhosen, doing his best to keep people pumped up.  He plays a music with a backup audio, do some beer tricks and play that super long horn thing.  Afterwards, he will go from table to table to chat and share a swig or two of beer.

If you are brave enough or not easily embarrassed you can earn some free goodies or beer by doing the chicken dance or even just guess the right number.

Foodwise, the portions are standard, you get your meat, potatoes and sauerkraut for $20 or so.  If you are pork or sausage averse, don't bother.  You can get a steak here, but why?

Two more comments regarding pricing and being 'touristy"".   This is a place where you will pay $7.50 for a half liter of beer.  5.50 for 1/4, 13.50 for a full.  Once you have a couple of beers, another liter sounds perfectly reasonable.

My bill for four was $180 with tip for a cheese plate, three entrees, one dessert and 3 liters of beer.

This place is for tourists.  I brought my cousin from Japan here.  I probably would not go out of my way to eat here.  Having said that, I think it is a good place to entertain.

Seriously, it's silly to expect this place to somehow replicate the experience of being in Bavaria.

There is a giant beer hall room which is the primarily room.  The beer garden room is for events or probably on busier nights.  Even though it says the beer garden is airconditioned, it is a bit hotter in there (maybe they didn't have the air on).

So have a good time, make sure you are well funded and don't expect to feel like you are backpacking in Europe.  Oh yeah and get a cab or walk across the street to the Hard Rock Casino and enjoy the scenery.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,0,0,3,eb-cpo4YhIWFkPIGSdApBA

Service is very friendly and efficient.

Food - I really don't love German food to be honest.  With that said, who doesn't love a great soft pretzel? These are flown in from Germany and you can tell.  They are excellent.  The sausages are also very authentic (I went with a group of Germans who confirmed this) and I think they hit the mark for quality, authentic execution.

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?

Friendly, yes, and the food came relatively quickly, but I was admittedly a bit miffed by the ""show"". Yes, at times the dining atmosphere during Oktoberfest can loosely resemble the show you see at Hofbrauhaus, but this is very rarely the case. That having been said, I think you come to Hbh knowing what you're getting yourself into, and knowing what you're paying for. Star Granted.

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Why is it that German food has been turned into this expensive anomaly everywhere outside of the homeland? Schnitzle? Fries? Spaetlze? This isn't expensive stuff, so as you can imagine, I was a bit deterred by the $30 price tag on my Pepper Steak with Wedges:

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dZXCmhBNt2XPcZeuIMwnjg&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg

That's an awful lot to pay for a dish that was 50% gravy. No Star Granted.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

The Pepper Steak was without question good, but I couldn't help but feel as though a vast majority of the flavor was coming from the gravy as opposed to the actual steak. Single Star Granted.

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I love love love love love German Food, but if you're jacking up your prices because of a carnival-esk atmosphere as opposed to food quality, you're doing it wrong. No Star Granted.",OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg,3,0,3,uVlOjdVo5BMRQmkROqyfrA

I had the Hefeweizen and it was everything a good German beer is supposed to be. Smooth with subtle hints of spices. Best beer I had in Vegas. My hubby had the seasonal offering and he said it was a damn good beer.

We also got a dessert sampler with bread pudding, apricot strudel and the hot raspberries with vanilla ice cream.

The large beers are the equivalent of two pints, meaning even at $14.50 it's still better than the normal $8 per beer Vegas pricing.  The hefeweisen was really good; not as tasty as my normal Weihenstephaner, but still very good.  

We ended up sitting in the mock ""outdoor"" beer garden since we didn't have a reservation.  It was still great!

On our way out, they were doing a contest to see which out of 10 women could drink their beer the fastest, with the prize being a beer stein. Of course, I didn't win but it was still very fun!

I have been to Germany and been to Oktoberfest and been to the Hofbrau tent, and this is such a bad interpretation of that.

If you were trashed, either you were covering your ears from the noise with your head down on that table, or better yet, you were joining in the singing although you didn't speak a word of German (don't worry, most there probably don't either). 

German food is not my specialty (I can only think of things I tolerate, like Black Forest Cake and pretzels, and then a bunch of other things I don't eat). Pretty much made this a pretzel-night and damn, they obviously do these treats proud. Normally not one to slather this in mustard, they had this amazing mustard that really blended the flavor. There were a couple other dipping sauces provided but I stayed faithful to that mustard. 

Definitely not a place I would select myself, but I made the most of it. The company was certainly interesting, and I do have to admit, everyone seemed to be having a grand time, whether slapping each other on the back, clinking beer mugs, or just laughing in general. God, I might have actually had fun. I imagine a fight would be epic here, if one were to break out (none did while I was there, thankfully).",d3i582wefTonNg8DB9WKqA,2,1,2,Z2uuJq_LI-Cm57DYRCtLww

Everything we had was incredibly heavy. Doused in dressing and thick sauces, it all tasted so fattening and yet somehow, flavorless.  The pretzel was probably the best thing we ordered with a ""cheese"" and two mustards. I put the cheese in parentheses because it tasted more like cream cheese than cheese. We shared the curry wurst to start as well. Long hot-dogs covered in a curry sort of ketchup. I liked the flavor of the ketchup, but its all so heavy and greasy that it was hard for me to move beyond that. The fries tasted like something that came out of a bad cafeteria. 

The space is pretty impressive and feels like a college dining hall. Long rectangular tables make great fun for large parties ready to embark on a German dining excursion. The best part of the lunch was when our waitress with the board she used to bring us shot glasses paddled my friends. They spank was so hard it echoed throughout the entire place.

Overall, this isn't really the type of experience I want when going to Vegas, so I probably won't return.

Came here at around 11:30am for some grub.  My gf and I ordered the Meat Salad (awesome bologna salad btw), and the Bratwurst with saurkrat (which was tasty as well).  

At first I ordered the half liter beer.  I looked over to my right and saw a tiny blonde girl drinking a HUGE liter mug.  I felt so much like a weaksauce, especially since my gf was taunting me, that I HAD to order the one-liter mug.  There was no choice.  Needless to say, I enjoyed every drop of their Hefeweizen (they use a LOT of bananas and cloves if your into the sweeter hefs).  

I'd love to see how they party down here during dinner time.  The host guy was hilarious, going around each table drinking his one liter mug of beer and one liter mug of Bloody mary simultaneously.

3438269,2012-03-24,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"The iconic Hofbrahaus is well known to any long time vegas resident. It's that beautiful white building on the corner of paradise and harmon. For those of you who haven't been there, let me tell you what to expect.
It's beautiful on the inside as well-- designed to look like a real german (or Austrian?) beer house. There are large painted pillars abound and a blissfully peaceful looking beer garden in the back. The waitresses all wear authentic german garb and the gift shop offers large glass steins for sale. 
First off, let me tell you that the food is not fantastic. Even if you are a bratwurst fan, I don't think you'll be blown away by the cuisine-- but i suppose that depends on your tastes. I'm not impressed with their pretzel or any of their chicken dishes either. It's not terrible but it just isn't that great. Of course, you don't really come to this place for the food.
Then there is the service, which again, isn't really that great. The waitresses are a step up above the ones who work at Hooters but not quite as competent as those working at your local family style chain restaurant. They tend to be painfully slow and often mix up orders when bringing them back to the table. 
And of course, the actual beer. It's good quality brew but it doesn't really impress me either. I've had their lager, dark ale, and hefeweizen. I'm begrudged to admit that their hefeweizen is hardly better than the Widmer you can buy at your local Albertsons or Wal-Mart. But you could argue that you really don't come here for the beer either-- you're here for the package it comes in. 
This is one of the most fun environments for a moderate to large group that you can find in Vegas. The live band plays plenty of recognizable tunes for singing along with,  the birthday boy/girl is encouraged to drink from Das Boot (ala Beer Fest), the drinking games on stage are tons of fun and of course, there is MC Johannes. Johannes may well be the funniest man of german descent ever to grace to earth.  His crude sense of humor tends to play better with the male dominated audience but I'm sure the ladies appreciate him as well. His comedy is mostly off the cuff, as can be observed by the way he interacts with the various patrons. Anytime a member of your partner is interacting with Johannes, you can expect to find yourself bursting out in laughter. 
The bill unforunately, is not so funny. You'll find that their food is overpriced and their beer isn't really that affordable either. Still, the birthday boy/girl will be overjoyed that you treated them to this place so it ultimately is worth it.

It was just as lively as before, and the band did an excellent job of making this place a fun and entertaining evening for us.  At some point in the night, the band announced that a very special guest would be coming in soon, but we had no idea what to expect... (more on that later)

So my friend and I ended up with the jagerschnitzel, which is a fried and breaded pork dish that also came with some spatzle (handmade German pasta).  Not as big as my meal last time I was here, but still very good.  The one thing that is cool is that instead of bringing bread to the table, they bring out a soft pretzel and several dipping sauces.  The pretzel was very good, and for me, just the regular mustard was good enough.  Our other friend got another dish that was all sausage, and that looked really good too.

Our waitress was very fun, and came by to check up on us regularly, but not to a point that it got annoying.  She also noticed that my friend and I both had a bunch of cameras out, and told us that the ""special guest"" was about to arrive, and we should rush the big double doors before anyone else got there.

The doors open, and it's none other than David Hasselhoff!  So he comes in with a camera crew, my friend and I are busy snapping up pictures, everyone is rushing the area he is walking, and he makes his way to the band area.

3500261,2016-03-30,3,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"I've been spoiled on stateside Hofbräuhauses after having been to the original in Munich. 

It's debatable whether it's fair to, for example, review a Vegas BBQ joint poorly ""because there's better BBQ in Memphis"" or something like that. We've all read those reviews, and I get it, but I still think that it's lousy practice to review something on what it could be, rather than what it is. 

Hofbräuhaus is a little different. Its explicit goal is to exactly replicate the Hofbräuhaus Munich in every way (even down to the fake bier garten and design of the building). Quote from website: ""As an exact replica of the legendary Hofbräuhaus in Munich, Germany, we take great pride in giving you an experience as authentic and unforgettable as the 400-year-old original"" 

OK Hofbräu, you have set the bar high - so I will evaluate accordingly. 

1. Ambiance: 3/5... decent job of creating the German bierhaus feel, but the fake patio doesn't do it for me, and the super high ceilings make it feel like a cafeteria. Not Hofbräuhaus-y. Nice band though, especially if you like ""roll out the barrel"" and ""the chicken dance""... a lot.  

2. Service: 4/5.... friendly and quick service, but the ladies can't hold as many steins as those German frauleins can. Also they don't have pretzel girls walking around. Bummer. 

3. Food: 3/5... it's hard to screw German food up. And they don't. But let's be real... no one comes here for the food. 

4. Beer: 4/5.... all imported from the Germany Hofbräuhaus. But the authenticity points gained here are offset but those you lose from actually making it in house.  

5. Price: 2/5.... WAAAAY overpriced. Even more than the original. This is really what keeps me from coming back more often. 

6. Paddlings: 5/5... I can't personally attest (I swear!)... but these ladies can swing a paddle. Be careful what you ask for if you've had a few steins and think the whole Yager shot followed by the paddling sounds like a good idea. The last one I heard echoed twice. 

Overall a solid three. But if you take their claims to be an ""exact replica"" at face value you'll leave a little disappointed.",VQHGS5qNZvuN2Y78zDA2KQ,4,2,3,DEl0yh7IXtuoUrSArkXU3w

Most people drink one of three beers by the pitcher and join in on group songs and chants.  It's pretty fun if you're not too uptight.  One of the strangest traditions is a paddling (wooden paddle from waitress) that guys line up for.

The food menu is pretty extensive, and also surprisingly expensive given it's mostly variations of sausage, kraut, and mashed potatoes. The beer menu is simple with just a few varieties on tap. Three sizes - huge, 1/2 liter, and 10 oz. 

I had a 10 oz original beer with a pork sausage plate. The beer was acceptable for a lager. For $16 you get three sausages, kraut, potatoes and gravy. Good taste for sure, but not enough to justify the price. 

This place is huge, with lots of picnic table like seating. Again, I was the first person in the place and while the hall was still wide open, they started seating other people right next to me at my table. I get that if you are busy, but it seems unnecessary when not busy.

It models itself on a German beer garden. There is a huge indoor area that has long benches where you sit and eat and drink. Also, what looks like an ""outdoor"" garden, to do the same I assume.
They offer 2 kinds of beer. I went with the lager. It was pretty tasty. Again, I am NOT a beer drinker. 
The food was decent. I ordered some snitzel with swiss cheese. They do have 2 (?) vegetarian options, and this was one of them. It was good, but not great.

I find the Vegas branch sometimes tries a little too hard to be like the original, but the customers always seem to have a good time, and if I want a bit of peace, I will sit in the bar and eat there.

Stepping through the front door, you leave behind the arid desert air and glitzy casinos of Vegas as you're transported into a world of schnitzel, ale, and strudel, served in a beer hall with ornately painted columns and ceilings, or an indoor garden with chestnut trees and a fountain, by buxom dirndl-clad waitresses with rosy cheeks. Having been to the original, I can attest to the autheniticy of the look, the feel, and the extensive Bavarian menu here. Liver mousse is served with a pretzel baked with dough flown in from the fatherland on a daily basis. If you like sausage, you must indulge in a wurstplatte, overloaded with Viennese franks, chicken and pork links, creamy mashed potatoes, and imported sauerkraut. Pork roast with dark beer sauce and bread dumplings, fried filet of cod with warm German potato salad, and breaded pork cutlet with cranberries are among the other specialties. Three versions of hofbrau - lager, a premium dark wheat, and a seasonal version - are on tap, and German, Australian, and California wines are available by the bottle or glass. Naturally the atmosphere is loud and festive, as if it's Oktoberfest every day of the year. If you're not part of a group, you probably will be before the night is over.

3520299,2014-06-15,24,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like ""if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop"" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the ""Sausage Tower"" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a ""hidden"" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a ""House Salad"" and priced at $14.95 the ""Grillhendl"" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed ""gimmick"" and ""tourist attraction here"" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered.

I like to order it by the liter, but they do serve it by the pint you lightweights.  Their Hofbrau Original is not bad either and they have seasonal beers too. 

After you've had your meal and a couple of beers order your friends a shot of Jagermeister or apple sours(taste like apple juice, but kicks like a mule) and when the drink arrive pull out your camera and record as your friends get spanked.

Regarding lunch we met up with 4 other business colleagues during lunch because one of the guys was there earlier in the week and he really enjoyed his lunch. So there we were table of 6. We had a free beer coupon from the Embassy Suites so we enjoyed one smaller than normal size beer. The other 5 guys enjoyed there lunch, but, I was not so impressed although our table server was very accommodating to our table needs and menu changes. The restaurant looks like an indoor beer garden, but, was very tame and appropriate for a business lunch.

In the evening a different group of 6 of us returned from American Shooters in the late evening and decided we would have dinner here. At this point there was live music and the place was hopping with people even dancing on their tables to the music.

We all used our free beer coupons for another small stein of beer. As we were eating our food we noticed one of the customers get up from his table and get paddle spanked by a waitress. I guess the guy did not pay his bill, but, actually others from the same table were also spanked minutes latter.

We quickly realized this was a ritual, which emanated years ago from customers who ordered after dinner shots. You got paddle spanked and then had to drink your shot. 

After we finished our dinners the one female at our table had ordered shots for the 5 of us. Needless to say all the men got spanked except for one, who refused to participate. But we could not suffer alone so we ordered another shot for our female friend. But she had rhine stones on her jeans so the waitress was very easy on her. The guys were disappointed by the uneven hand of our waitress. The guys were hit hard, but, our female friend got off easy.

As for my dinner there was way too much food to eat and again I was not so impressed by the quality or taste of the food. I guess I don't like German food so much even though I am Polish? Maybe it is because they invaded us in the big one: WWII. 

I should add service during dinner was as equally good (or better considering the circumstances) as was during lunch although we did not have any special food requests.

I would still recommend this place not so much for the food, but, because of the live music and the paddle spanking for fun. By the way I recommend the dark draft Dunkel, which was pretty tasty.",ncvgNeEsAIAuMWYFN2blhg,8,9,4,yASOLpAdOBpML9CO8lWnMw

Bavarian bands used to play almost every night, but over time it has become just another sports bar encircled with big screen TVs and you have to come on weekend evenings just to catch a band.

Prices are not for those on a budget, at $ 15 for a full-sized beer (liter) and $ 20+ per meal, you can expect a family of 4 bill in the $ 50 per person or $ 200 minimum range if you leave quickly and they will add the tip on if your party is more than 4 people @ 20% regardless of the service (which is usually good).

They have cut some of their best food items off the menu like the Beef Goulash.  The food is however consistently good but there are fewer and fewer efforts to make it better.  They want you to eat, like its a restaurant, but they make more selling you the beer.

The pretzel's suck (they are frozen), especially when compared to the real item in Munich.  

Now that they are here I can't imagine Las Vegas without them, but the more they become like every other sports bar in town the less people will go out of their way to stop by.",ESDpMVW5_5RhBJEgrTbC9Q,0,0,3,JRxDltTReoaOZBWmIlAuMg

I got the HB Hef, which was surprisingly memorable, and the pretzel, which the waitress pretty much pushed on us, was actually a highlight of our meal. Aside from these staples, the menu is fairly homogenous: most dishes involve a sausage, mustard, and potato in one form or another.

While enroute to Las Vegas on a red eye flight, I was reading an in-flight magazine, when I noticed an ad for this restaurant.  The advertisement called them the first and only authentic German beer hall and restaurant to call Las Vegas, NV home.  Not only that...they're a replica of Munich's famed Hofbräuhaus but in an enclosed building.  There was also an ad that offered a free mug (per customer) of their Oktoberfest beer just for stopping in.  We were excited because we have never been to Munich.

Anyway, we arrived at the restaurant at lunchtime and there was a line of people waiting to get in.  The building is quite large and has high ceilings that makes you feel like you're under a huge tent with painted indoor gardens.  You could almost hear people's conversation echo about.  We were seated at a large community table as an attentive and friendly server came by.  

We thought about ordering only a snack to take advantage of the free beer advertisement.   Our order consisted of 2 pretzels and 2 small (free) mugs of their Oktoberfest beer.  The beer was cold, crisp and clean tasting.  We were told that the beer is imported from the same batches as what is made and served at the Hofbräu tents.  We considered upgrading to a 1L stein but we knew that we had dinner reservations set for later that evening.

- Jumbo pretzel which was huge and served warm. There were two types of mustards and an Obazter (Obatzda?) cheese.  We were familiar with the mustards but the cheese spread/dip was deliciously different.  Apparently, it is a Bavarian cheese delicacy...a mixture of soft cheeses and butter.

- Jumbo pretzel with Bavarian Liver Mousse and Obazter (Obatzda) cheese.  The liver mousse was light and flavorful. I know, some of you might be saying ""Ewww"" but, it was really good.  I wished that there was a larger portion but, it would've been overkill.

We enjoyed both baked pretzels as they were served warm, soft and a bit chewy.  The pretzels and beers were perfect together and we were satiated.  

But, then....I looked at their dinner menu and spied ""Schweinshaxe"" aka roasted pork shank with crispy skin!  OMG...I started planning our return because they serve this specialty after 4PM.  Alas, our stay in LV was only for a couple of days and as they say, ""our dance card was filled"".  So, just to keep my tastebuds focused, I borrowed the picture of that pork shank.  I WILL return.....  Maybe the oompah band will be playing.

Good German food.
Well miss miss on both things.
Starting off the service sucked!! Worst service ever! We had a blonde waitress with alot of black eye makeup(can't remember the name) she ignored us for quite some time. She finally took out drink order after apologizing that she was very busy. Lol. (OK I tried to understand) but my bill was 102. Dollars and I think I deserved good service.. She never asked if we wanted water or how our food was. She didn't know the menu at all(I won't even elaborate on this) 
The large beers looks amazing.. well!!! Nope!! They we served almost room temp. Mugs not even chilled . There's a few that walk around with shirts. Specifically saying they are there for quest services. And he ignored us a 's well. 
Whoever the manager is !! Really needs to be more proactive and start out by training the servers !.
The food was below average, I opted for one of the vegan dishes and it was dry, over cooked and no real flavor.
Hubby got the sausages which were ok. But still they seemed to sit out too long all were not juicy. The band was a fun experience!! Although the tip jar was pushed in our face the entire time. 
It was a funny experience. And worth talking about. 
But as for my stomach and the food. Nonway!!
And the horrible service really makes me never want to recommend this place..

Definitely did not see that on the menu, nor was I interested in squeezing a plastic boot in my carry on. I told the waiter we did not want the boot, we had made the mistake, we were very sorry, but we wanted our beer poured into glass steins that we did not have to buy.

FIRST, I fully acknowledge the mistake was mine. What I don't agree with OR appreciate was what the manager did afterwards. 

He came over, and anticipating an apology for the confusion, instead got a guilt trip from the fact that they can't reuse the 2 boots he had poured and had to ""eat the cost."" THEY'RE MADE IN CHINA! How much can they cost? 5 cents each? He even awkwardly paused like I was going to jump in and offer to pay for them.

That's the Hofbrauhaus for ya (sorry guys, I'm not sure how to make the a with the umlauts, but that's what I intended fyi).  Hofbrauhaus is the quintessential rowdy restaurant where you can get some tasty beers and good eats.  I always find myself here in a party-type situation; mostly of the birthday type.  Honestly, the atmosphere fits and doesn't disappoint!

They have a live band playing both American and German folks songs while you get your drink or grub on and it keeps the lively atmosphere going.  As for the beer, they have 1/4, 1/2, and full liter mugs available depending on your thirst level.  IMO the best time to come in and funnel some beer into your gullet is around Oktoberfest.  Their Oktoberfest beer is awesome and highly recommended.  But, in the ""off-season"", the dunkel and hefe do just fine.

I've only had a few dishes here but I usually gravitate toward the veggie options.  They have a few veggie items available including the veggie brautwurst that comes complete with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  I've also tried the chicken braut here and they're similar enough to go either or, really.  The side salad is a healthy sized plate as well so if you're looking for something a little smaller to snack on, the side is a good option.  Also, before I forget, the soft pretzel here is really nice.  It's especially nice when it's fresh out and pieced off with a dab of the cheese or mustard sauce 'shmeared' on.. yummyyy.  Pro tip: alternate sauces when going in on the pretzel... trust me, it's a good time.

3701934,2010-08-25,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"So, after finding out that the place that I stayed at had a Bavarian restaurant next door I had to go; there was no question.  The restaurant stays close to its roots with a big dining hall full of long tables and giant 1L beer glasses.  Perfect for a good Bavaian experience.

In my opinion so far of Vegas... A lot of it seems to be for the show and not quite for the quality.  This is kinda one of them.  Sure everyone's in costume, there's  oompa band and all, but the food is merely MEH...

Instinctively, I ordered the sausage platter.  I figured I'd get a good taste of everything.  Plus, I added a order of spatzle on the side (CAUSE I LOVE SPATZLE!!!).  The first thing I noticed that everyone was pronouncing spatzle wrong (whatever...).

Anyways, my platter came with an assortment of sausages (2 vienna frankfurters, 1 chicken and 1 pork with a bunch of sauerkraut  and mash potatoes, mustard and hunter sauce.

After trying everything I came to one conclusion.  This is more about the show than it is about the food.  The vienna franks were terrible.  If you want to try them... go to Costco... they sell them there.  The only good sausage was the pork one.  And even then it was still ""OK"".  The sauerkraut was alright... but definately out of a jar that they bought in bulk.  It wasn't exactly the best sauerkraut I've had.  

The spatzle wasn't really made very well either.  I believe they just boiled it and strained it.  Good spatzle is pan fried after... (the best is in butter... MMMMMMMmmmm butter...).  This kinda had the consistency of soggy popcorn.  The flavour was alright (because it had herbs in it), but it would have been much better if it was pan fried afterwards.

The best thing really about this place is the atmosphere.  If you've never been to a bavarian beer/sausage house it's something that you have to experience (without actually having to go to an oktoberfest).  I mean it's not the same, but at least they try and give you the gist of it.  The weirdest thing was that no one knew the german drinking anthem and what to do; they really had to push it whenever they decided to ""lift their steins"".  That and the waitress's were forced to do the chicken dance everytime it came one.  OMG i felt so bad for the waitresses, as if they are made to dance everytime that song came one.

Definitely at least try this place if you haven't been to a bavarian beer/sausage house.  Personally I think even the one at EPCOT centre in Florida is better.  Order a giant beer and have a good time with your friends.  Don't expect the food to be amazing.

On our first day in Vegas on our way to the hotel, we passed the Hofbrauhaus.  My friend, who had been to the one in Munich, got all excited saying we HAD to go.

So we end up going and it was such a good time.  The live music is great, and so is the other entertainment they have going.  There is a ladies drinking contest (which I totally rocked out) and for the burly men, a contest where you have to hold a beer out at arms length for the longest.  You are also bound to make friends with the people who are sitting at the other end of the table.

The Jagermeister Mistress will walk around and offer shots - and spanks with a paddle, which is good entertainment, and my dream job ;-)

My coworkers mainly ordered liters of their Hofbräu Lager.  The rest of the party ordered boots of beer (like in the movie Beerfest).  Oh boy!

I also ordered their Bierkutscher (Beer Truckers) Steak, which was pretty good.  It's a 10 oz Rib Eye (which of course, I ordered medium rare).  However, the sauce on top of the steak was super salty... but my coworkers say that German food in general is pretty salty.  Boo.

3743171,2011-04-22,1,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Just awful customer service, really disappointing.

I made a reservation here a month before our visit - we were 20 strong, a soccer team in town for a tournament.  I was the first to arrive, and the hostess said to let her know when we had 10 there, and she'd seat us.  When 10 arrived, I let her know.  They started to lead us to our seats, in the Main Hall as we'd requested.

Then, confusion strikes.  She leads us to a table with people already sitting at it, one of our group says ""uh...we don't know them..."" and she laughs, then realizes he wasn't joking, and says ""really?  no way!""  They claimed that this other group came in and said they were us, so they gave them our table.

However, I suspect the true story is that they screwed up and gave another party our table, under no fault of the people sitting at the other table.  My proof?  While we were waiting for our 10 to arrive, I heard them call ""Leslie, party of 6.""  We were Leslie, party of 20.  So, the Leslie party of 6 was seated, then they realized they screwed up and tried to blame them for wrongly taking our seats.  Not cool.

The manager was involved in all of this, and he is the sole person to blame for the mistake, and the failure to fix the mistake.

They sent us back to the lobby and made us wait until a table for 20 was open.  By the time we were seated, it was 45 minutes past our reservation time.  We had just played 3 soccer games before going to dinner, and were all more than starving, and grumpy.  It truly sucked.

He tried telling us that we could just sit in the beer garden if we wanted - anyone who has been here knows that would be lame.  There is no entertainment, and it is not fun like the main hall is.  We came there to party, not have a conversation.

What they should have done:  Admitted it was their mistake, not blame some other customers.  Given us free mini-beers while we waited, or at least offered us water or SOMETHING.  Apologized.

The manager here sucks, I won't be back.  Oh, and our server sucked and was rude to some of the people in our group, but we still had to pay the 18% tip they tacked on.  I hate that rule with a passion you would not believe.",eyHW_diFXlqqL9EMu4LeHg,1,0,1,Y_BbjnV1CcBuDDRv0DOIDg

3746633,2012-08-24,8,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"To be perfectly honest- I thought this was a horrible representation of the German branded beer destination in Munich. I know it's two different countries, but the feeling was just- eh. If you're going to slap the name Hofbrauhaus on a venue to lure people in, at least give a similar experience- especially since you're charging a lot for it. I'm actually surprised that this restaurant got as high of ratings as it did. Maybe I should have started drinking before coming?

The location in Munich was a warm and friendly atmosphere while the Las Vegas felt like an afterthought. We ordered two dinners, a beer, an iced tea and dessert and it came out to a little over $80. Wowza. I kinda felt ripped off. There are a ton of great German places in Orange County/LA that charge significantly less and have a way better vibe. Jaime P and I actually joked that there were more servers than customers, yet everyone had to try and flag someone down for attention.

I ordered the nürnberger rostbratwurst which was three pork sausages, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes and the meal was washed down with a mug of the Hofbräu Maibock. The sausages and sauerkraut were cooked okay, but lacked any real flavor. Same went for the mashed potatoes. The beer was good, you can't go wrong with that. I should have ordered more of those and it would have probably still been cheaper in the long run. At least I would have been drunk and satisfied.

Went the extra mile to fill the void in my stomach and ordered the apfelstrudel that came out warm with a side of ice cream. I can't say anything bad about the dish. Between this and the beer, it was the only reason I chose to give this place two stars.

There was a one man band singing some German tunes. He did his best with the crowd in the beer hall to keep them entertained. I think there were seven total in this massive space, but he did what he could to get the audience excited with beer drinking games and off the wall jokes. It was funny because when I called for hours, I was told I should make reservations because it's on a first-come basis. Maybe the other 500-people or so were on their way?

This could have just been an off day- unfortunately, I'll never know an on day because I wont be coming back.",nxWrhF_hyX0wwjrEkQX8uQ,12,6,2,nFJnTRK0o1ltZTZoWd5T4A

as for the beer, it was rated very good from my friends (they all drank).  i don't typically drink so i am the designated driver where ever we go.  they also have shots of alcohol, which is normal, but the little twist they have here, is that you get some corporal punishment with every shot.  you get walloped in the behind, kiester, bottom, rump, ass, heiny, you pick your word for glutimus maximus!  all in good fun, but make sure that you are conditioned for the hit, our server Emily was awesome.  she hit with authority, she will leave you a mark you can count on seeing for the next couple hours.  

the food was good, a nice selection of meat and potatoes.  big pretzels and a wonderful assortment of dipping mustards for it.    there were even some desserts.  we opted for the triple plate one, with a strawberry cream, apple strudel, and some chocolate cake.  out of the three, the strawberry thing was the best, by a wide margin.  

they also have a nice gift shop in the front, where you can buy all sorts of souvenirs, shirts, aprons, hats, bags, beer, stuffed animals, and the like.  this is vegas you know.  

cons... if you are allergic to fun don't come.  if you don't like loud, boisterous and crazy people, don't come.  if you are allergic to crowds and strangers who will be all around you don't come.  if you don't like beer don't come either.  all in all a great place to have a good time!  i'm coming back in november.",f7pbQuon-3GbyNbzcNSQdQ,1,1,4,3GyA25CPDjGkO9LbfHMTWQ

Where the hofbrauhaus fails is in execution.  I visited on a Saturday evening and had the Schweinebraten.

In the end, hofbrauhaus is sort of like an epcot center execution of a german restaurant.

The food is not quite as good as what one gets in Munich and it is a bit overly salted. But the portions are generous and it tastes fine. The beer is good and the Yelp deal for a free 10 oz pour was all I needed. The coffee is clearly from a Keurig-style machine and has the distinctive Nescafé-like taste that comes with those.

The beer was really good.  It was obviously pure and smooth (German laws demand as much), but it also possessed a nice flavor that paired wonderfully with the food.  

I started off with the creamy Bavarian potato soup.  Rich and creamy, I was impressed with the natural flavors that commingled so nicely in the soup.  Carrots added sweetness, fresh chives added soul, and the addition of sausage and croutons made it heartier but not overly so.  Great beginning.  

For the main course I had the Wurstplatte which was a plate of 4 sausages served over mashed potatoes  and sauerkraut with a side of spicy mustard.  The sauerkraut was served with caraway seeds (Bavarian style) and was very nicely done, full of flavor and not particularly sour.  The Vienna sausages were good, the pork sausage was incredible, and the chicken sausage was just okay.  This dish was noticeably heavy towards the end, but the lighter beer helped considerably.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this selection.  The side of pretzel was fresh and tasty as well.  The mustard really made it come alive.

Service was very attentive, and the girl was so pleasant and friendly.  The ambience was great.  Large, open, really cavernous space with picnic table seating and music pouring through the space.  They really captured the beer hall atmosphere of Germany here.  

I understand trying to copy the real Hofbrauhaus could be a disastrous undertaking.  400 years of tradition shouldn't be reduced to a marketing gimmick, but I think they did a nice job in the reproduction without sacrificing too much in the way of tradition.  In a world where gastropubs are coming into their own and are even being rewarded Michelin stars, I think places like the Hofbrauhaus will always prove to be a smarter alternative.  Highly recommend this side of Munich.",xTGpw0x5EUj11YFhwr6m2A,2,0,5,HIqtPjImbqGQTCrUyVSW6w

Having been to the actual Munchen Hofbrauhaus and I can tell you the decor is quite similar. Big long oak tables, a boisterous band of German singers, and more beer than you should be drinking. 

The food while not absolutely authentic ""best German food ever"", I do think that it provides enough of an idea of what German food looks and tastes like for the curious patron. 

This particular night that I went, the ""haus"" had a really fun young band of German singers who really knew how to get the crowd into the night. There was drinking songs, blowing the alpine horn game, and drunken dancing. What else do you want from a German restaurant?

The one problem with Hofbrauhaus is the fact that its more like a ""tourist spot"". You just go there not for the food, but for the experience and the ""I just went to Germany feeling"". While I recommend everyone to go once. Going on a regular basis probably means you don't care about money, or you're an alcoholic.

Nothing like dancing in booths while drinking out of a giant mug bigger than your head.

My friends and I were on an all guys trip to Vegas and on our last night we decided to check this place out. We had no reservations, but within one hour, we were able to make a reservation via open table, and get seated. I was impressed because there were 10 of us and it was a Saturday night. As soon as we get there I was overwhelmed with the 

The ENVIRONMENT is huge! They have a live band at the very front and the decor is great. Very German/Oktoberfestish. All seating is on wooden picnic bench style seats.  One thing to keep in mind is the noise. It's really loud when a band is playing.  So loud that we had to pretty much yell at each other to have a conversation. However, just because it's loud, it doesn't mean you can fart at will. You have to remember that its picnic bench style seating and your friends will still feel the vibration.  

The FOOD here was satisfactory IMO. I asked our server for his recommendation and he suggested the Jagerschnitzel. It's a pork cutlet with bacon and onions covered in mushroom sauce. Plate also comes with cranberries and Spatzle which is a German noodle. The Spatzle taste like macaroni. The pork was a little gristly for me but the overall blend of everything on the plate was pretty good.  

The BEER tasted great and was so refreshing. Since we were there in October the seasonal beer was the famous Oktoberfest. All their beers are brewed and imported from Munich Germany. We all ordered our beers in that huge beer mug that you can serve rootbeer floats in. It was so good that I wanted another but the night was young and that one mug already had me feelin pretty good.  

SPANKING SERVICE - While we were waiting for our food this lady AKA The Jager Girl came to our table and asked us if we wanted a Jager shot. She didn't say how much and we didn't care to ask at the time because we wanted one of our friends who never drinks and is really shy to get loose. So a few of us bought shots for him. We didn't realize that you get spanked for every shot you take. He took it well and we later found out that each shot was only 5 dollars. So then we all decided to get one. 

The actual SERVICE of the restaurant was pretty good as well. They checked on us quite a bit and our food was brought out in a timely manner. 

Overall, it was a great experience. Solid 4 stars for me.",v325XGF-l9da74ZMWEjyoA,10,12,4,83-aKXfUdD-P72Iik3kRng

Apparently this was a recreation of the original Hofbräuhaus in Munich. Everyone comes for the beer, which is served in three different sizes, but let's be real - you want the one served in the giant one liter stein. Of the beers to choose from, they have the classic Bavarian lager, a darker lager, and a hefe weizen. 

The menu consists of some traditional Bavarian fare such as sausage, sauerkraut, potatoes, schnitzel, and the giant pretzel. I was quite disappointed by the ""freshly baked"" pretzel as it was very dry and tough. The cold ""Obazter"" cheese dip didn't help matters. If you're a fan of sausage, try the Hofbräuhaus wurstplatte for a combination of Vienna style frankfurters, pork, and chicken sausages with sides of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. Personally, I loved the Jägerschnitzel. Nothing says you're hungry like a big pork cutlet topped with mushrooms, bacon, and onions with a side of spätzle. If you're still hungry for dessert, the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream was delicious. 

There's live entertainment that comes on at night, which makes this place even more fun. But, you can always start your own entertainment at your very own table. This is the perfect place for a large group. If you find yourself in such a situation, be sure to order shots for that one naughty boy or girl. Each shot comes on a paddle. After that unfortunate guy or gal downs the shot, the beer maid gives that person a thunderclap paddling that echoes throughout the hall (why do you think they built the ceilings to be so high?). I'm still sore just thinking about it. 

Come one, come all. You will enter sober and leave with a headache, no memory of what happened, and unsure why your left buttcheek hurts so much.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,2,2,4,MoNMunNV9A0vnAn1XhKBoA

Let's play the adjective game:
oom-pah filled
kitschy
super-loud
brown creamy sauce-y (Have to make it an adjective)
WTF...what's going on with those spankings? (not an adjective)

Ok, so I'm experiencing a classic Vegas moment of cognitive dissonance...something I know (and don't quite love) from Europe has been transported via the Starship Enterprise to be adjacent to my hotel in Vegas.  I can see how this place could be fun, but really?  Is there where you come in Vegas?  

The Food:
Food is standard German fare, and it was acceptable but nothing special.  Sausages, spaetlzle, sauerkraut, big cuts of meat in brown creamy sauce.  It's served promptly and without any circumstance.

The Beer:
Well, they have the basic Hofbrauhaus beers: light, dark, a few seasonals.  Prices top actual Oktoberfest prices by quite a bit...they even make Canada and NYC seem cheap.  The Germans are not imaginative with their beer styles, but what they do, they do well.

The Atmosphere:
Loud!  It's this strange super-new looking version of what is a very old establishment in Germany.  They have an oom-pah band going which they seem to have imported, however, they're quite hard to make out because the sound system is poor.  The crowd is a little bit rowdy.  You even see some real Germans there, well, because they like to eat German food when they travel.

The Weird:
Whack! Is that middle-aged, fat business man being spanked by the waitress?  WTF?  They have this uber-strange practice here, in which a busty  ""shot girl"" comes over, sells you a shot, and gives you a very loud whack with a wooden paddle.  This is apparently their Las Vegas twist on the Hofbrauhaus...super strange! This is not a German tradition, in any way, shape, or form.  It was kind of creepy seeing groups of drunken middle-aged men bending over to get spanked in public.  They even sell T-Shirts that announce ""I've been spanked at the Hofbrauhaus""

The worst part of the whole experience is the parking situation. Very limited parking and you are somewhat forced to valet park.",zpwWpno3U-oZaG3AJuKqSQ,2,1,5,1hU2GW8a3aa4jsXC2i820g

3954448,2014-08-15,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Wow, tough to give it four stars, but I am going to do that. I will explain why. Beer should never be $16 for a draught beer. Sure it is one liter in size, but really who came up with that price? You almost feel obligated to spend it because the smaller beers are $9 so you might as well splurge and get the full Bavarian experience.

So why 4 stars? The food. Let me tell you after spending five years in Germany and knowing what Bavarian food should taste like, it is spot on. Really rich and authentic. I had the Cheese Plate appetizer which had American cheese on it, but don't let that bother you, it was done well and you get the same plate in Bavaria anyway. 

The Bratenteller is a mixture of Pork and beef with red cabbage and Spatzle. Authentic in every way and so good every bite was made with some sort of noise like umm, yumm, mmm, etc. 

Entertainment is good but in my opinion it should be louder. 

You will be seated with total strangers unless you indicate your comfort is not there, but sitting with strangers is the Bavarian way and I met some of the most fantastic people including a family from Ireland. 

So money aside, bring a hundred so you can get just a little of everything and at least 2 beers to get the full effect. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday or anniversary or whatever. Just make sure you tell your waiter and they may do something special for you.",zMDoBRh_SQxfFyhuaEVrdg,1,0,4,7s2GszhCcIX1BnCfGIvyiw

My husband and I both ordered the Jagerschnitzel. Gooooood. It was a pork cutlet with a mushroom sauce, bacon, onion, and cranberries served along with Spatzle, which is a German noodle. There was enough food there to fill you up, but not to get you 'over stuffed' and miserable.

The interior of the restaurant is very similar to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich AND, even though they don't have an actual outdoor beirgarten, their back room, in typical Vegas style, makes you feel like you are in an outdoor beirgarten.

My only one real complaint about this place was the music. When we came in around 9 pm on a Saturday, non-German rock and roll music was blasting so loud I couldn't hear myself read a menu. This issue was quickly resolved when a kind waitress moved us to the back room, aka the ""outdoor"" beirgarten. Later on in the evening the music switched back to a German duo that played traditional polka music.

As far as German food goes, I think this place does a really good job of coming close to food at the actual HBH in Munich. The sausages (wurste) were all wonderful, as were all of the main dishes that we ordered. The only thing that none of us liked was the rotkohl (red cabbage). It was way too sweet and had cinnamon in it. This is definitely not the way its cooked in Germany and not something I want to eat with a savory meal.

The beers are served in either liter or half liter sizes. We saw some people ordering shots, which come with swats, and that was pretty entertaining to watch. The waitresses really feel free to let out all of their pent up food service industry frustrations, as they smack the drunk guy who ordered the shot HARD with a wooden paddle.",PoEVqT6kKNW5gxp44R2w5w,0,0,4,8EaqBFYfWvSGVMXJfidGOw

Live entertainment was awesome. Within your first 10 minutes here, you'll already witness people getting spanked with a paddle for buying a shot. But I'm really into the music. The musicians played the keys and sang, and some would occasionally walk around playing the accordion or alpine horn (SUPER HUGE horn I thought was just on display). When they played Chicken Dance, everyone joined. When they played Amazing Grace, we stood up and sang along...immediately after, a group of people got into a choir and sang the Canadian national anthem...Wait, WHAT?!

But the food was bad (maybe drink first...because free 10oz with Yelp check-in). 3 of us shared 2 plates: Poached Mncher Weisswrste (2 sausages + pretzel) and Jgerschnitzel (pork cutlet, mushroom sauce, noodle) - and still had leftovers. We had to peel the skin off the poached sausages. I liked the well-seasoned flavor but didn't like that it was way too soft, almost like tofu. The pretzel was entirely bland and had a stale texture, but I liked the honey mustard dipping sauce. I preferred the Jgerschnitzel, but everything in it was too salty to even enjoy.

All sides are listed as $4.99, including the one you just had ""held"" from your plate, so why refuse to be accommodating to a customer who is already paying $19.99 for a lunch entree? This is especially difficult at a place where most of the sides are like it or leave it options like red cabbage and sauerkraut. I couldn't find two options that looked appetizing so I watched the rest of my party eat and sipped my water. My husband ordered the 306 and was underwhelmed.

Been here quite a few times in my adult life and love every minute of it. Went recently for the Oktoberfest celebration...what a hoot!

I have been to Europe but never to Germany so I can't give one of those reviews on how authentic this place is. 

The BEER OH the BEER! First of all, if you order anything less than 1 liter then you don't belong at the Hofbrauhaus. Depending on the type of beer each liter runs around $17. Sure it's pricey but you really are paying for the atmosphere and entertainment. The whole place is lined with long tables/benches which help create the ambiance of a German beer house. 

A German band complete with tuba normally plays and encourages more drinking. My favorite is when they come around with the tuba and you must hurl your change into it's opening. So much fun with a beer in hand. The band plays traditional German music as well as the occasional cover song. Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" with tuba backup= Amazing!

You can volunteer (or a friend can volunteer you) to have your booty paddled by one of the many waitresses. I saw an old man get paddled the other night and thought he may have a heart attack. But he survived!! 

The food is pretty descent but is pricey at about $18-$20/dish. I've ordered the traditional wienerschnitzel which is battered pork fried to crispy perfection. I normally don't get a full meal here since my friends and I mainly come here to drink. You can order a large pretzel with assorted mustards and cheese for less than 10 bucks. Also the fries with the cheese are a good beer-soaking snack. 

All in all the Hofbrauhaus is a fun place to celebrate birthdays, bachelor parties, and I even saw a group celebrating their 40th high school reunion. Also it's just fun to drink and be belligerent where it is encouraged!",lg5f5JPxo6AjHz-EvW1hVQ,0,0,4,6Rl6IlbGGKgcf_typlF10Q
3974467,2015-11-01,10,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"One of the members of our hiking group came here a few times during Octoberfest for lunch and she convinced the group we should do this.  Knowing our hiking group, going somewhere for lunch after hiking is not a hard sell at all so we put this on our to do list.

We got there before they opened at 11 AM.  As soon as they opened, the 9 of us were shown to a long table in the main room with high, arched ceiling.  The set up consists of long wooden benches at long wooden tables.

Our server was Angela and she was terrific!  First drinks.  I got iced tea and my tea along with others who had been or soda were brought quickly.  Our orders were then taken.  I wanted to get something somewhat German.  My only experience with German food had been at Luchows in New York City many years ago.  I was never overly fond of German food despite it being half my heritage.  I got the wurstplatte, a sampling of three German sausages--a Vienna style frank, and one pork and one chicken sausage.  They were served on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with sauerkraut and served with a spicy onion mustard.

The sausages were OK--nothing outstanding--but OK.  The sauerkraut on top of the mashed potatoes was something knew for me but the two went together well.  I was surpirsed at how much of the mustard was gone when I was finished with the sausages.  Maybe I overdid it a bit so the sausages had a bit more flavor?

I was the only one to get dessert.  I got the Black Forest cake at Angela's suggestion and this was so good that it would be reason to stop in here sometime when I wanted a good dessert.  Creamy and very flavorful, it was a perfect ending to the meal.  And, the hiker who suggested we come here was the only one who got a taste of my dessert.  My question to the Hofbrauhas is, ""Why serve this piece of cake with 4 forks?  Do you think I'm going to share?""  No way!!

Service was very good!  I will make a return visit some time and try a different dish but I'll go for lunch rather than in the evening when it will be loud with many beer drinkers banging their glasses and pretending to be in Munich.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,13,3,7tEHX2v2g8xQPR1RF6XRTA

3987262,2012-05-14,2,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Here is a good place to get a PG-13 version of two Vegas staples--alcohol and breasts.  Just don't come here expecting traditional Bavarian culture.

While it's a hell of a great time, this Hofbrauhaus is not authentic.  I don't know how much they're trying to be, but they're not, and that's okay.  I have been to the real thing in Munich several times, and I assure you that the similarities are skin-deep (and even in Munich the HbH is the most commercialized of all the traditional beer halls).  This place looks beautiful, the beer is just as great (lager, dunkel, or hefeweizen--all are excellent), and of course the waitresses boast dirndls and bountiful cleavage.  

In Munich, they do a brisk tourist business but there is a healthy local presence:  one room has a large rack covering one entire wall, like a wine cage, where the regulars store their personal steins.  In Vegas, the only locals are the staff.  The Munich HbH is a crossroads of the globe and you may make new friends from a dozen countries within a few hours.  In Vegas, you will meet people from Buffalo, Tupelo, and Modesto.  Still, you will meet people and have fun with them.  In Munich, the place is packed to the roaring rafters by 7pm.  In Vegas, the place is still half empty at that time and suffers from the loss of conviviality.  In Munich, an oompah band makes the rounds every half-hour or so.  In Vegas, three skinny white guys make do with guitar, bass, and keyboard.  Oh, and in Vegas there is a restroom attendant.

But that's all okay, because like I said, it's a great time.  There is still a lot of energy in the room, the staff are wonderful (especially our waitress Rebecca), and the beer and food are awesome.  DO NOT MISS the onion mustard and Obatzer cheese that come with the ""pretzel complete"" and check out the delicious crispy pork shank, after 4pm Saturdays only.  Plus they have added a uniquely American touch--whenever you down a shot, you get spanked by a waitress wielding a wooden paddle.  Those ladies mean business.  Great photo opportunity to embarrass your friends.

If you want to have a great time with a group of friends and get away from the standard debauchery, you cannot make a better choice than the Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas.",6EHbIv5w2I4XbXs3dG_D1Q,3,4,5,WKD0wjrMVXRh8ZBnbs1xbQ

Food was delicious and seemed authentic to me. The red cabbage was like a sauerkraut made with red cabbage with some sugar and spice added. Interestingly tasty. Generous portions, friendly staff, great atmosphere. I would love to go back.

They had a live polka-style band. I was disappointed there was not a dance floor.

People in our party ordered sausages and a couple of the pork roast style dishes. Everyone enjoyed the food. 

One draw back was the seating along the side of the room, where we were seated. The tables can fit up to 8+ people. If you're a party of 4 they will seat another party on the other end of the table which is pushed up against the wall. Which means if you're sitting on the outside you have to get up for the other diners or you have to wait for others to get out of your way if you're seated on the inside. This is okay if you like the other people seated at your table. But if you don't like their conversation or demeanor it could get unpleasant. So I recommend making reservations as I got the impression this was ""overflow"" seating. The rest of the seating areas had easy access to both ends of the table.

I attended an event here which was located in one of their halls in the back of the restaurant. This large meeting room was huge and even had tables like that in their main dining hall. The decor was something that would fit right along side a small German village. The staff was extremely sweet and their clothing was a throw back to the bar maid type of dress.

One cannot truly experience a German restaurant without trying the beer. The beer I had was a darker ale and had spicy undertones, but was very smooth. I ordered a sausage dish with sauerkraut and eating them together was so delicious. My favorite was the large pretzel with cheese that was as a big as the dinner plate.

The ""indoor"" room has the bandstand, so that's where the party is.  The ""outdoor"" (standard LV sky painted ceiling) has a working fountain and balcony, which look nice.  A great overflow/quiet room to escape any nuttiness in the main room.

And let's be clear, this is Vegas (and America), so it's super fake and non-authentic (think Venetian), but it tries, the beer is awesome, and the food is good enough, so I'd be back.  If you think you'll be transported to Munich, take another look at the map and come back to Earth.

Went on a Saturday afternoon with the wife and the daytime solo act was one of the best one-man shows I've seen in a while.  Funny, musical, interactive.  Oh, and toasts drinking often, in case you needed a reason.  Folks are looking to have fun and talk with each other (i.e., not a normal American bar), so that's a huge plus.

I'll be back here again on a weekend night to try it out--yeah, it's that worth it.

As for the food, the schnitzel isn't breaded (?!) and they charge for extra Jaeger sauce, which is stupid, but the spaetzle isn't bad and the Wien Wuerstl (Vienna sausage) is spot-on (with that special German snap).

4055334,2017-06-12,1,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Let me begin by stating that I am a fairly versatile, curious, and objective world traveler that has seen a great deal. I have spent my fair share of time (7 years including grad school) in a university setting (i.e. frat parties). Please keep these facts in mind while reading this review.

I was unaware of the Las Vegas Hofbrauhaus until a chance visual sighting while driving off-strip to gather some supplies. I immediately became excited, being a big fan of German beer--especially Hofbrau. I have visited dozens of legitimate German beer halls and have thoroughly enjoyed each one respectively. The façade of the Hofbrauhaus was very pleasant to the sight. My initial reaction was a quality professional establishment with only the freshest and finest of beer and probably some acceptable food to accompany it. Immediately I began dreaming of dunkel and schnitzel. For three days I had these desires, until finally I had the opportunity to get my fix.

I cannot understate the level of disappointment that I felt. I have a hard time believing what I saw.

Of all the crazy behavior I have seen in my life (mostly folks under heavy influence of alcohol and drugs)--which includes people cutting holes in ceilings with chainsaws, exploding full toilets with cherry bombs, naked people, ping pong balls coming out of orifices, and folks trying to remove the skin on their face--this place was definitely a NEW experience to me, and not in a good way.

I can not say one good thing about the Hofbrauhaus other than its premise has a pleasant exterior. Upon entering, I noticed that the dining hall was physically separated from the entrance foyer/bar area by some heavy duty hinged glass doors. In addition, (all of) the wait staff was standing in this area instead of the dining hall. They all seemed shell shocked, wide eyes glistening and slight nervous shaking like small rodents.

I asked to be seated, the glass doors opened and into the fray we went. I immediately noticed that the hall was designed as a very good acoustic reflector. Add to this 1980's rock music (i.e. Poison) being played at eardrum shattering levels of 120 dB and above through the full frequency band of 60hz-30Khz, people yelling and screaming, etc. I was then seated at my picnic table (which to be fair is common for authentic German dining). I could not communicate to the waitress when she attempted to order drinks because we could not hear or understand each other with the excessive cacophony in the background.

Next I witnessed a man with a Hofbrau flag running around the hall, climbing up and over dining tables and screaming, walking amongst plates of food and tumblers of beer. He would occasionally pour a beer onto someone's face, scream, and run off to the next table. To make this experience more pleasant there was a conga line of people following him in both behavior and footstep. To the best of my knowledge I likened this precession to that of Senor Frogs or likewise ""free Tequila shot line"". 

After the flag man, I was able to witness some excessively hard paddling done to several men in which they were struck so hard I could see their eyeballs bulge out of the orbital sockets from strain. Red faced and screaming, more beer was poured everywhere and asses paddled. As the screaming and frenzy amplified, I felt like a movie was being filmed. Surely, respectable human beings (most of which were probably middle aged) could not act so poorly? Furthermore, I have no idea how they could not find that atmosphere uncomfortable? It seemed like a torture chamber to me, something worse than Guantanamo ever did. I would have rather been water boarded, seriously.

In all, I think the Hofbrauhaus had the lowest class people I have ever seen in my life, behaving as poorly as possible. Again, remember I'm comparing this to a Senor Frogs next to a cruise ship terminal in the Caribbean--those people at 2AM, half naked, barely able to stand up in a Tequila conga line were better behaved--and it was probably only 60-75 dB loud in that place! This place beats any frat party I have been to or crazy bar in a 3rd world country. The Hofbrauhaus is a complete abysmal disaster of a restaurant if it can even claim that title. It's more like the 3rd ring of Dante's inferno waiting for the unsuspecting to open those glass doors. I have only sympathy for the pathetic and clearly terrorized staff that works here. 

I shall never return to this place. I bid you the best of luck, if you need your German beer fix (which I did)--I recommend bringing some industrial noise proofing earmuffs to protect your hearing--do NOT wear any clothes you care about, and bring your own paddle--preferably lead filled, so you can take down any number of the livestock-like low IQ denizens of the Hofbrauhaus, should they attempt to walk all over your dining table pouring beer on each other, screaming loudly with eyes bulging out of their heads and saliva streaming freely from their mouths.",iPHbivfVjozOvbtfOpZcHg,1,1,1,tyRMJew3DcAl18JaN6OPGg

4074558,2016-06-02,4,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"I have been to the original in Munich so I'm really happy to have a Hofbräuhaus right here in Vegas. While it's not an exact replica (and the food isn't quite the same), the true German essence is captured through the boisterous atmosphere, authentic imported beer and decidedly German menu. I love to take out of town visitors here, and I visit a couple of times a year when I'm missing the gorgeous country of Germany -- one of my favorites I've ever visited.

You'll find the as-big-as-your-head pretzels and all sizes of cold beer (from bashfully mini to ""holy cow"" huge), and and certain times during the year there will be a good German band playing live. Even if you aren't a beer drinker, it's just crazy to come here and not order a beer! It's so good and there's something for everyone from super light to the darkest of the dark. Come during Oktoberfest and you can drink their truly exceptional imported specialty beer. Don't forget a designated driver!

This is a great restaurant for large groups as the venue is equipped to handle them. Patrons sit at long, shared tables (just like in Munich), so be prepared to make friends! Kids seem to love the place too because they can dance around and jump to the music.    

The German food is authentic and tasty. Not fantastic but good (and overpriced). There's a great tiny gift shop in the lobby with cool beer steins, stuffed bear toys, funny hats and lederhosen. The waitresses wear just sexy enough drindls, a big plus for the men in your party. I know my husband and his buddy enjoyed taking a shot and getting paddled by one of the ample-bosomed girls on our last visit. Yes, you can get bent over a table and paddled. It's a gimmick but it's funny to watch guys whoop and holler.  

The mostly concrete beer hall is huge and cavernous (just like in Germany), so be warned that this is not a place to come for an intimate dinner or soft conversation. It is loud, loud, LOUD in there. When the crowds get heavy, the band gets even louder. Pounding on tables, stomping on the floor, drunken singing and shouting out toasts is not only tolerated but openly encouraged. If you know the chicken dance you will have a blast. 

While the noise is to be expected, the biggest negative is the service; I don't think I've ever had good service here but that's okay. You'll most likely be too busy stuffing your face with pretzels and beer to worry about that!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,9,7,4,IenmTstM07-BCLjjnu-F_A
4085971,2017-02-19,1,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"The best advice I could give you about visiting the Hofbrauhaus is to eat before you get here. Don't just rely on getting food here, unless you like paying for a sampler of sausages that look more like Vienna wieners than sausages. Carb up at home or if you are in a pinch, stick with the Bavarian pretzel. You'll thank me tomorrow morning.

Hofbrahaus though isn't really so much about the food as it is where you take your friends when you want to be loud and drunk and it be acceptable. The steins of beers are massive. No matter what kind you get, those one liter steins are going to kick your ass. It's not a shock, I always have a hangover the day following a Hofbrahaus visit. Even if you tell yourself that you'll only have one (or two) steins, you'll get sucked into drinking more. That'll come either through a chugging contest or a spank shot. Who can resist taking a shot and getting spanked? No man I know. 

I can't imagine coming here by myself, lest I want to stumble home drunk and hungry. Friends really do make come together. You want to share the experience of hearing a guy blow the Ricolla horn or singing the ziggy zaggy song. You're not getting that at Applebee's, no danke shun. 

If you really want to experience this, come during the month of October. And better yet, bring a bunch of your friends. And even better better yet, bring a bunch of them in October and get them drunk and see what happens. That's the type of fun the Hofrbrahaus brings.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,2,3,QFhHM_3sNdlcNOQ9zSV3Ew

It's really kitchy, and from someone who grew up with a mother who lived in Germany and Austria for years, has been to Germany several times and has had really great German food, I felt like I could get better ""Mexican"" food at Taco Bell than German food here.

bland
tough
stale
overcooked
chewy
slimy
cold

In a word: Fun.

Lots of people miss this gem of a place by focusing solely on the strip, or fancy steakhouses, or buffets. 

It's an excellent replica of the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, and it maintains the lively and robust, fun atmosphere.  The main room are filled with benches, situated very close to one another.  Beers come in Liter steins, and if you go during Oktoberfest, there's a special brew!  

Off the menu are 3.0 liter acrylic boots.  They'll fill it up about 2.0 L or 2.5 L of beer, and you get to keep the boot afterwards.  Or you can drink the little girl's sippy cup (0.3L) and be ridiculed by all your friends.  :)

Also off the menu, but available, are pork knuckles (only on Saturday).  This is a change from when I went last time, when they didn't have it; however, go early, they tend to run out.

It's German food, so for the most part your ""variety"" is limited to different meats in sausages, or some kind of veal or pork cutlet. 

In addition to the food, there is a live band (or at least one performer, depending on when you go) who contribute to the liveliness.  Winners of little contests (pretzel eating contest, beer stein-carrying contests, name that song contests) receive a wrapped 1.0 L stein to take home ($16.99 value, purchasable from the gift shop).

I never made it into the dining hall other than a quick pass through on my way to the restroom (stay tuned for more on that).  Instead I stayed at the bar since I was there for the beer after all.  When presented with the sizes, my friend and I looked at each other and looked down the bar at a lady with the large liter size beer.  Being men and not wanting to be out done by a lady, we both ordered the liter size of a dark beer as well.  We were already full so those beers took a long time to drink.  He was the first to visit the restroom in the back.  I followed suit a few minutes later.  The quick trip through the dining hall was entertaining.  People sitting at community tables singing and laughing.  Drinking and eating.  Live music playing traditional German tunes as well as more contemporary songs on traditional German instruments.  Sweet Caroline in oom-papa style was hilarious.  It looks like a fun place to eat and be basically part of the show.  I'd like to go back just for that.

I figured he went back to the restroom and I missed him.  So I waited a few minutes and he never came back.  Finally I asked the bar tender if he had seen the guy I came in with.  I got a funny look followed by ""oh, you're serious.""  For the last ten minutes he was sitting just one stool over and talking with another bar patron.  Both men are ex Air Force.  I felt pretty stupid at this point.  All I could do was laugh and wonder if I was really that drunk.  It was not long after that that I finished my beer and was ready to head home.

There are many bars in Vegas with a hugely better selection, Gordon Biersch, the Freakin Frog and the Yardhouse all come to mind.

3. The great big echoing hallway style room is loud - and wait til that godawful Oompa band starts up.  You won't be able to make conversation with or hear your friends, which can really be a negative in a dining experience.  And the band itself is not that good - sharp and brassy with too much piercing horn, not subtle or refined.  Accordions!?  They were like toddlers given a whistle: look I can make the dog cry with my earsplitting melodies!  Maybe if you were sh_tfaced it would serve as music - but how can you get there with the beer tasting like donkey sweat?  

4. There is a gift shop in the entrance.  I am not a fan of restaurants with gift shops.  Esp when they come with a heaping side of bad food, bad drinks, and bad music.

5. I was expecting a higher quality experience.  I suppose if you were drunk or high - hey it's right next door to the Hard Rock, most probably are - it would be passable.  Sadly I wasn't.",Ti5Bpj0eRmRYTBnep63S1Q,5,4,1,FAPmkhak53gX0eFQNupYiw

I have been to the original one in Germany and when I heard they opened one in Vegas I had to come and check it out. We ended up sitting next to a family that had originally came from Austria and when we go to talking and he found that I had stopped in his country for a time being we became the best of friend, or maybe the yager helped us become friends. Never the less we enjoyed dinner and drinks by the pint. Go to their website to find out when they have bands playing thats the best time to go.

We enjoyed eating there with our 9 month old son because he wasn't loud considering how large the place was. His babbles were drowned out by others. The beer was typical of German beer - it was good! The food however left me disappointed. I would not recommend the schnitzel wiener art. It was really dry and I found myself dipping it in the cranberry sauce provided to add flavor. I would get one of the other schnitzels with sauce or gravy instead if I returned. The potato salad was pretty tasty though. My husband ordered a special which came with a few types of meat and he liked it. The biggest disappointment was the price of our food at lunch time ($19-20 for an entree).

First of all, this place is priced like this is universal studios... Inside disneyland... Inside Disney world. Seriously. 16-18 dollars for 1 liter beer?! Ja, OK! That's a bit of exaggeration ( though the price is accurate), but the whole place felt like you were being hard sold to spend more money. I mean the desserts are TEN dollars! Items like that make this place outrageously priced, and not affordable for a regular visit. 

The second part that was a disappointment was our waitress. She obviously didn't know much if anything about Germany or the menu, seriously mispronouncing a few items over and over even after my German family repeated it back the right way. Now, I'm not a stickler for doing some sort of accent or anything, but it showed a lack of authenticity there, and I appreciate a place that tries to give you the real feel (especially in Las Vegas!)

What's more, we felt like she was trying to push things on us, and the second we said hey... We had some coupons for 2 free beers with dinner... She became quite unfriendly and unhelpful. We got the impression we weren't spending enough money for her. I get being a server is difficult, been there... But we were a very easy table and the place wasn't nearly full. No need to flip the switch just because we aren't going nuts on ordering stuff.

I almost laughed out loud when she came by with a ""retail menu"" and told us to order our gift shop items through her so that she gets the credit...really? I can't remember the last place a shopping menu was pushed on you. 

We also didn't particularly enjoy the music, it's very cheesy, and since my family isn't from Bavaria, they could not stand that kind of music haha we were excited to leave. 

To be fair, the bratwurst sampler dinner and the schnitzel were decent quality, which is what earned this 2 stars instead of one. However we saw a really strange pattern at our table and the tables around us... Orders came out no more than 5-10 minutes after being placed. Like our full entrees! I've worked at enough restaurants to know there is some serious pre-cooking going on back there, as nothing can be cooked to order so fast.

I would go back to this restaurant with a group of friends but the volume is high enough that I would avoid taking anyone I wanted to have a good conversation with.  

That said there were some issues.  

First:  The music when we showed up was really fun.  It wasn't authentic seeming but it was good party music.  They did have a little tribute with an alphorn that the band members carried from table to table.  Then the band took a break and when they came back the music style swapped from accordions to guitars and they began playing music that really did not fit the pre-break atmosphere.  I also felt it was inappropriate when they asked everyone to stand for the national anthem, it is not Veteran's day or Memorial day and I did not go to a Bavarian/German restaurant to be invaded by US politics.  Really....if you're gonna play an anthem, at least play one from Germany.  

Second:  The food was mediocre at best.  There was very little sauerkraut on the plate and the sausages were somewhat bland.  I ordered a pretzel and it came from the kitchen half frozen.  Presentation of the plate was poor and unappealing.  I really did enjoy the darker beer though.

The roast pork was tender and perfectly seasoned. It was accompanied by bread pudding. The lightly seasoned bread pudding matched perfectly with the well seasoned pork.

The Nürnberger are 3 pork sausages matched with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The sauerkraut wasn't sour at all and the mashed potatoes were creamy. Yum!!

I had seen it on Yelp as I was mapping out places to visit prior to my trip to Vegas, and the reviews and pictures were very eye-opening. I'm a sucker for German style food and accommodations. This place didn't disappoint.

Also, I was staying across the street at the Hard Rock Resort and Casino, so it was a no-brainer. I knew I wanted to work this place in, and so it was done.

The interior is very well done. They took a lot of pride in constructing and decorating the inside to make you feel as if you were in a German biergarten. They played authentic German music, too. Also, the servers are dressed in appropriate traditional outfits. They also have a biergarten with wooden picnic tables throughout.

The food was good. I had a pretzel to begin with, followed by a wurst platter, and topped off with Applestrudel. I enjoyed a couple of wheat beers, which were perfectly chilled. See attached pics for further details.

The service was on target. My server was knowledgeable, and took the time to explain my options, as well as the type of beer that would complement my meal.

Would love to take this place home to South Florida with me. However, it's too big to fit into my suitcase. I strongly recommend checking the place out whether you're staying at the nearby off-the-strip hotels, or seeking this place out as an alternative to all of the places to eat at on the strip.",-S1KvpmUM8Sx60UimmufxA,3,5,4,SPg2JpXVlgtLm6FmOmcCTg
4328508,2013-11-09,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"This place has been on my list to visit for a few years now and I finally made it over... I wish I had explored it sooner.

It's been too long for me to remember the real Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany for comparison, but I sure felt like I was in a German beer hall.  The restaurant is divided into two dining areas.  The first is an open Beer Hall with large tables.  Perfect for larger groups.  Six of us were at a table with plenty of room to spare.  The second area is a Beer Garden which has smaller tables and more for a quiet(er) meal.   There's also a bar at the front of the building.  The Beer Garden seemed to be closed for a party when I was there.

There's a band playing upbeat German style music. As other reviews mentioned, there's barmaids walking around with shots and will give you a paddling you haven't felt since you were in Junior High!  (Well, for those of us old enough to have been spanked before the world became soft and sensitive.)  This place was hopin' on a Tuesday night.  No... I didn't get paddled.

The food was definitely close to being authentic German dishes.  It may not be something everybody can appreciate (like how some people can't stand Chinese, sushi or Mexican), but the flavor and quality was good.  The food ranges from snacks/appetizers perfect for simply wanting to have a night of drinking.  There is a variety of dishes if you want a meal.   I was happy with what I ate.  

Now to the beer.... this is a GERMAN BEER HALL.  Go away if you're looking for Miller,  Coors or some fru-fru status symbol.  They only have German style beer here.  The selection is limited to several different beers, and they were all good.  

If you're looking for a quiet, dull time where you can enjoy meaningful conversation and eat Americanized versions of another culture's food, then go someplace else.  If you're looking for a place with higher energy to have fun and experience something different, then this is a good place to try.

They had this band that was playing great songs (Sweet Caroline was the first one they played when I got in there...THAT is fun to sing with a giant beer glass in hand...swinging it above your head).  They had a two story horn, similar to the Ricolla commercials, that they blew after hoisting it toward the ceiling.

There is a woman that walks around with test tubes and a bottle of Jaeger.  Should you buy a shot from this well-muscled woman, she makes you stand, with your hands on the end of the table, whilst she paddles you.  She does not hold back.  Apparently, in my highly inebriated state, I did not think she was hitting me hard enough, and asked her to paddle me and hard as she did the boys.  MAN did that sucker hurt!  SO much fun, though!

Also in my highly inebriated state, I convinced myself that I am fully bilingual and talked to a German man in, what I thought was, perfect Spanish.  Also, while swinging my giant beer mug where I thought was over my head, I smacked it into my tooth and it chipped.  I didn't fully remember this until the next morning when I found the chip.  This is besides the point, but pretty amusing to my bar-mates and I.

4358041,2011-06-26,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"To sum up: authentic Bavarian restaurant located off the strip with huge beer and great food.

To elaborate: My very first trip here was for a friend's birthday extravaganza. My first thought when I walked in was BEER!!!! and lots of it. Now being a Bavarian place they don't offer light beer so don't even think about it. They offered Hefeweizen, Dunkel and a seasonal - which in this case was a dark wheat beer. If you're looking for large quantities of tasty libation this is the place to go - get the litre and be amazed at the size of the stein you get. 

On to the food - if you like Bavarian (read: German) food, this is the place to be. I happen to be a fan, so I was in heaven and quite honestly was torn for a while. Oh the food was sooooooo good - you have GOT to freaking eat here if you like German food. Plus, the portions are HUGE! This is excellent drunk food - which probably says a lot about Germans...and the desserts look amazing. I was too full to try one though.

Bringing on the atmosphere - for all intents and purposes this place is an authentic Munich beer hall. They have family style long wooden tables and benches, there is a huge shelf along one wall loaded down with steins, and a guy comes in and plays live music and gets loads of audience interaction. This is a very enjoyable place to come and eat - it's a little pricey (look to spend at least $30 per person if you're drinking), but it's definitely worth it for tourists and locals alike. I can't wait till Oktoberfest to see this place come alive.

There are also spankings and contests. Be intrigued...",glYwn0bUfowzSEujf4Tmcg,0,0,4,3d9xmYaCl4HGxIl94waVwg

I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art which is a huge think breaded and fried pork cutlet with a side of cranberry. It also came with potato salad. The pork was bland and really needed the cranberry. The potato salad was standard grocery store variety.
My bf had the Jägerschnitzel and we both really liked it. It is the same breaded and fried pork as mine but it was smothered in a gravy of bacon, mushrooms and onions. Its ""hunter style"". It came with Spätzle which was also really creamy and good. My bf has German heritage so if he says the Spätzle tastes like his mom's cooking, then it must be good.

They get one star for the building and atmosphere.  

Our waitress was nice enough to start.  We ordered sodas with no ice and a couple minutes later she brings us out soda glasses that are half full.  No exaggeration at all.  We look at her and ask what's up and she explains that their system only pours so much soda per drink and with no ice it leaves the glass half full.  She then explains that you get two refills and we can use one of our refills to fill the glass.

What the hell?  Are you serious?

I have NEVER been to a restaurant with that policy.  This is a pretty pricy place so the fact they are cheap on soda is doubly strange.

And I wanted to substitute fries for the potato salad in my 18 dollar meal and she said no substitutions.

Also my dad asked the waitress what kind of German beverages that were available that were non alcoholic and the waitress got an attitude and laughed at him.  

I don't care if the food is good or not.  I don't care if the girls are dressed up like they are working Fantasyland at Disneyland.  For the price you pay for dinner here their policy on food and drinks suck here.

Goes well with any of the beers, my choice (first of 3) was the Dunkel, the dark beer which was smooth and rich.

For our group (3 couples) we also split the:
- Hofbrauhaus Platte: smoked pork loin, pork roast, and a delicious smoked sausage served with dark beer sauce, mashed potato, and sauerkraut. A huge plate for 2 but we were able to rise to the task.
-Hofbrauhause Wurstplatte: Frankfurters, pork and chicken sausages also served with mashed potatos and sauerkraut.
-Muchner Weisswurst, the veal and pork sausages, absolutely delicious! good with the heffe (maybe another litre??)

They have massive sized jenga in t he back along with beer pong tables (rightfully). They have interactive games like chugging contests and Stein holding contests.
 
Their beer was on point. I tried the Hof(enwizen? Too German for accurate spelling). 

They have booty paddles as a drinking game and they sound hauntingly painful. 

They have food as well, and I would say that was the one difference between 5 and 4 stars. Most of it was good but and seemingly authentic but salty. Very salty.

Beer: Had the Octoberfest.  Wife had Dunkel.  Both very good.  equal rating.  Had 2 liters, so I must have liked it.  15.50 per liter. Don't be scared.

Apps: Pretzel. Cheese, mustards.  Must have.

Meals: Had the wurstplatte, wife had schnitzel sandwich.  Loved mine.  Hers was good, not great.  I am the German in the family, so...

Service: Fine.  We had a large group so it is a pain t begin with.  they got to beat 3 of the group with a chunk of wood, so that probably helped them deal with it.

Games: quarter bounce into stein, stein holding (I am a champ!4.5 minutes), drinking through giant Ricolah horn, dancing, chanting, singing, etc.  And, of course, wooden paddle ass beating.  Thumbs up to all.  The guy who was on stage drank about a keg of beer while performing a variety of buffoonery.  He was great.  If you want a nice quiet meal, stay as far away from here as possible.

My husband liked the idea of eating at Hofbrauhaus so we decided to give it a try even though I knew this place is better for big groups. We walked in to people on the table with their beer in hand singing their hearts out! I thought ""Oh cool!"" . I was secretly glad the hostess led us to the quieter beer garden though. I just wanted a semi peaceful evening!

It was a nice size space and it looked like we were sitting outside. The ceiling was painted with a beautiful blue sky and there were cute  lanterns hovering around us.  They also have freelance photographers who walk around offering to take souvenir photos of you . We bought one since we were celebrating Jon's birthday.  If sentimental gestures are not your thing they have shot girls who will give you shots while smacking your bottom with a wooden paddle! 
Some of the ladies really get into it they kind of do a three step jog then swing! We were fine just watching. It was pretty entertaining to watch while you wait for your food.

The food comes out really quick so there isn't really a wait time. I was pleasantly  surprised because the place was packed. We started off with the Creamy Bavarian Potato soup. It was too salty for me so I just had a couple of spoons of it. We also ordered the Jumbo Complete which was a big pretzel served with ""Obatzer"" cheese, sweet mustard and onion mustard. The sweet mustard was my favorite! The pretzel was also too salty for me so I just tried to avoid eating the outside of the pretzel. I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art for my main entree . It is a breaded pork cutlet that is served with Bavarian potato salad and cranberry sauce. It looked like a big chicken patty. The taste was okay but I think I would have liked it better if I dipped it in the mustard rather than the cranberry sauce. The potato salad I was expecting to taste amazing because they specialize in this type of cuisine but it was unremarkable. The strudel is amazing here though! It was so soft and tasted wonderful! 

This is a nice place to go out with friends and have a few beers. I would go back again but I would order different items off the menu. I would keep my dessert the same though!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,1,3,zOiGWSm_y2SflcLIK6_xyw

My boyfriend and I wanted to try the one vegan dish on their menu: two vegan frankfurters with curry sauce and french fries. It was taking a long time to get our food, so I asked the waitress if the rye bread or pretzels were vegan, and clarified that vegan means no cheese, no butter, no milk, no eggs. She said she would check, but kept forgetting. Finally, by the time our meal came out an hour later, she said she had remembered to ask the cooks, and both the bread and pretzels either have butter in them or on them. At that point I didn't care to investigate further.

The Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas is a fun place to take some friends and I would recommend it to most people, but it does fall short of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany. 

First, the bad: its pricey!!! $15 for a beer? In Germany it was less then $6 (US) but its Vegas and they are selling an experience so I get it. It cost us $180 for 4 people to eat dinner... wow, but again its Vegas. My only issue with the price is that the servers don't come around all that often so you must flag them down when you see them or you may not get another chance. Also, I didn't appreciate that after the 2nd refill on her Iced Tea my friend was told she would be charged for the next one? Seriously? At these prices she should be able to drink as much Tea as she wants. 

The Good: Its a fun party environment. Especially on the weekend! I love the euro style dining experience in the main hall because as you drink and sing along with the band (which can be a little loud) you can't help but to meet some interesting people. The garden section is also available for the more intimate dining experience and isn't nearly as loud!  Also, the food is very true to the dining experience we had in Germany. Was it as good as Munich? Maybe not, but how many German places can you find in Vegas? Fact: Google lists 7! HB, Cafe Eidalvice (SP) and 5 Weinerschnitzels... so it was good enough! 

Overall its a fun place to go every now and then, but you can also find a better dining experience for the money (think Mortons). As a substitute for flying to Munich, its totally worth it.",eXVdbhzZGvIVbqVJzP2bxQ,0,0,3,40c8Yj0a_ul-zwmkrYk7WQ

I'd like to say I rocked the Hofbrauhaus, but in truth, the haus rocked me.  The beer at Hofbrauhaus is flown in from Germany.  Their wheat beer is delicious and among one of the better I've tasted.  Like true German wheat beers, it is served sans fruit.

Huge steins of beer come as soon as you can order them.  The beer drinking ensues at your table and on-stage.  I was here during downtime in Las Vegas, Saturday at 2pm, so the place was far from packed.  The band was a husband-wife team and despite the fact that the beer hall was only sparsely populated, they performed like it was a full house.  With interactive songs that ranged from standing on your bench to pounding your stein on the table to the rhythm of the song, they constantly kept all patrons involved.  I could go on with some of the other tricks they have up their sleeves but I'll let you come here to see them for yourself.

Even after a tough session of playing trumpet and flugelhorn, they still make rounds of the hall and chat with you while taking slugs off their steins.  Both talkative and sapient about the tradition of the Hofbrauhaus, they're even willing to get a little personal.

The atmosphere is frenetic between the live music, beer stein holding contests, and the guys with the jagermeister shots getting paddled.  That was probably the most amusing part of the whole evening-- watching a large-boned beer wench (can I say that?!) paddling middle age men on the butt after they did a shot of jagermeister.  And they enjoyed it..... !

For me, I'm not a beer drinker, nor do I like the standard ""pig and potatoes"" german diet.  So eating my salad and drinking my glass of wine just didn't cut it in the biergarten.

It's a great place to take your friends, (girls) share a stein of beer, and try a fresh pretzel.  Let your hair down. But go eat somewhere else.",1ziEzn7BoXTfOQ4YBkdz1Q,1,1,3,RR5lae_c_JfDXf4vQvhEZg

From the very beginning my experience was a pleasant one. Jennifer in the corporate sales office was extremely helpful in explaining the different dinner options that would work for our group and I felt that our meal options would be able to satisfy the many different dietary needs and restrictions we had in our group. 
The process of booking our meal was super simple and stress free. With all the details I had to juggle during our retreat it was nice to have this task be such a simple one!

We even  had to adjust our dinner time last minute and that was no issue at all.

When our group started to arrive the evening of we were set up out back in the beer garden and had designated servers per each of our large tables to wait on us. Within minutes the manager on duty (he might have been the general manager now that I think about it) came back to speak with me and welcome our group which I thought was a sure sign we had picked a great place to dine.  Everyone was so friendly and you could tell that the staff enjoyed their job.  At such a ""novelty"" restaurant as a German festhaus this is really important.  When customers come in to dine they are coming in for having a great wait staff really adds to the whole experience. These folks were just SO NICE....it was awesome!

Our group was large and drank A LOT but the folks who waited on us -- the servers and bussers -- never acted like it was an inconvenience for us to have a cash bar or for everyone to spend so much time changing their minds.  We also added to our banquet order additional food items for the tables and even that was a simple request.  It's easy to say that the folks here know how to take care of their customers.  At the end of our long meal we ended up nixing the separate drink orders and paying on just one tab--the head waitress showed me our bills and the additional charges and I was appreciative of the fact that paying the tab was so easy.  

At first we were somewhat bummed that our group was sat in the back away from the band and ""indoor"" entertainment but by the end of the meal we were so happy to have had the whole beer garden to ourselves. The food was delicious -- even if we couldn't finish our dessert trays--and we all had plenty to drink that I think everyone left full and buzzed :)

Before we left the general manager came over again to thank us for having our dinner there--such nice service!--and I have to say that if we come back to Vegas in the future I will make sure we eat here again.

4655513,2012-10-13,2,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"The Strip has the Pyramid, Ancient Rome, New York City, and Venice. Paradise Road has the Bavarian Beer Hall.

  The Hofbrauhaus is a Bavarian Beer Hall across from the Hard Rock. Step inside the Hofbrauhaus, and you temporary leave Vegas.

   This past Saturday,after 7 years in Vegas, l finally experienced the Hofbrauhaus. It is so different from what I expected. I expected a mega bar serving hundreds of varieties of beer. In reality the Hofbrauhaus is a replica of a Bavarian Beer Hall. Beer drinkers share good times at long tables. In the front of the Beer Hall, a Bavarian band leads the good times. On a loudness scale of 1 to 5, it reaches a 4. The servers dress in Bavarian uniforms. A major reason, I give Hofbrauhaus four stars is because the well-done theme makes it a unique place to share good times over beer.

   Because Hofbrauhaus is a beer drinker's theme park, the prices are inflated. The feeling of drinking beer in a Bavarian Beer Hall justifies $8.95 for a 17 ounce Octoberfest beer from Munich Germany. $8.95 also pays for a strong beer. By the way, a 34 ounce Octoberfest beer is $15.95. 

  Hofbrauhaus is more than beer. They serve German food at prices that compare to their beer, which is $$$. From Monday to Friday between 11 to 4, they offer $9.95 specials on German food.

   I left the Hofbrauhaus with the impression that it is cool to have a beer in a beer drinker's theme park at the same time that one beer is the limit. After one beer, the noise becomes annoying and it is so obvious you could go across the street and have a few more beers at Firkins On Paradise for the price of one beer at the Hofbrauhaus. And this is where we went after having experienced drinking a beer in the Hofbrauhaus.

Review in a nutshell:

Pros: Entertaining Bavarian Beer Hall theme, strong beer, fun at first, plenty of parking at the nearby Hard Rock

Cons: High priced, very loud environment.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,4,4,4,gIPR-eQT51g0ew544kTBMg

It's a huge, gorgeous building inside and out. I wasn't sure it was going to be what we were hoping for because of the star ratings but I'm so glad that we took that chance.  Not only was everything we ordered fantastic and authentic, but they really feed you here!  They have great beer selections (but I was pretty sure that would be the case).  The live music and atmosphere was incredible- they seat you at large tables and you may end up seated with people you don't know but it is a beer garden after all.  You'll get over any awkward feelings you may have quickly with how cool this place is.  It gets noisy, but that's to be expected.  

Everyone agreed this was our favorite place we've ever gone in Vegas thus far and we've all been many times.   Next time hopefully we'll have some extended family that I know will really enjoy it here. 

A huge plus that it was so close to The HRH, not even a 5 minute walk.  Made it easy to decide to get the huge beers and no need for an uber.   It's still worth the drive even if you're not close by. 

There's also a really beautiful outside patio garden, which I'm sure is really popular in the cooler months.

4713041,2018-05-01,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Leave it to the Americans to ruin things! I've been to the OG Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany. Think of the Vegas location as an overpriced American knock-off. This place is more like a frat house than a restaurant. They've got plenty of entertainment to fit the ""What Happens in Vegas"" theme of the city. 

There are no frills at the Munich location - just hard-working Germans who can somehow carry 24 full steins in one hand across a jam-packed hall. I will give credit where credit is due, when you walk into the Vegas location, you do kinda feel like you've been transported to Munich. They've done a decent imitation of the beer hall, complete with plenty of German swag. 

As for food, we went family style and shared a bunch of stuff amongst us four dudes. Half chicken with potato salad, pork cutlet in mushroom gravy with spatzle, some sort of beef roast in a ton of gravy, a tower of different sausages (beef, pork, chicken) with various mustard dips, and a big pretzel with a side of mustard. I found the food to be flavorful, but in an artery-clogging way, of course. If I was sober, I would probably find the food to be pretty gross, but after one stein down, your appetite spikes and everything tastes delicious. They really do over-do it on the sauces. The pretzel was also too dry and tasted stale. But overall I enjoyed the meats, potatoes and sauerkraut. 

Our main server was good but the Jager lady had a knack for disappearing for long periods. We ordered a round of shots and didn't get them poured for at least 20 minutes. 

As for entertainment, there was a ""band"" with two gents playing fun German tunes, a stein-holding competition, and paddle spanking galore. The sound of solid, unforgiving wood demolishing innocent buttcheeks echoes throughout the hall every 60 seconds. It's definitely loud, so don't meet there to discuss business. 21-35 year old males is definitely the key demographic. 

HLV is a good time to be had with your bros, but be prepared for a hefty Vegas price tag and one hell of a bloated stomach, when and if you are able to walk out under your own power. It's no Munich Hofbrau, but it has plenty of Vegas appeal.",z5R3uP_MMbtnXdgy3OR73w,2,0,3,R4usnTn8Gj_2s7fMk2gGOQ

We visited the Vegas location this past Sunday evening during our first trip to Vegas. I'm sorry to report that we actually walked out during ordering due to the no substitution policy. I have never ever been mad enough to walk out of a restaurant. This was a first for me. 
  My daughter wanted a schnitzel with something other than vinegar based german potato salad. We were told that substitutions were not allowed! When I asked the waitress to clarify that (ridiculous) statement--she smugly said that it is right there on the menu!! Are you kidding me? My kid is supposed to eat something she dislikes? Here is where I rant a little--
  If I agree to pay for the unwanted potato salad will the cooks be kind enough to scrape it in the trash for me so the vinegar won't get on my daughter's $20 pork cutlet?! Are these TV dinners where the cooks just heat them in the oven and rip the plastic off the top? Is it permitted that I purchase an additional side of mashed or fried potatoes; or does my daughter first have to plug her nose and eat the potato salad?! This was the only bad experience we had in Vegas. All the other restaurants were great--especially the two Wolfgang Puck ones. (Wolfgang Puck Bar and  Grill at the MGM was beyond awesome. Best wings ever!) 
  We have eaten at the Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh on several occasions. In fact, every time we visit Pittsburgh from Virginia. Never once did they question what sides we wanted. The experiences in Pittsburgh are why we visited in Las Vegas, but Vegas location really was shameful. I can't believe they seriously expect customers to sit there shut up and eat what they are told to eat? Shame on the customers for not walking out as well. Damn sheep...
  I was looking for the hidden cameras and waiting for someone to stop us as we stormed out the door. No one gave us a second look. The only employees that seemed concerned in any way was the valet parking crew which apologized profusely. What does that tell you about the staff inside the place? 
  What a truly awful experience. It was the only unpleasant memory from an otherwise awesome vacation. My stomach hurts just sitting here and recounting our experience.",G_PEhN-U3QwFSzU1AHcR8g,1,0,1,ACGv0DRni05TbmGDeL8Sjg

Day 101 ""DUSA Tour 2016"" 

In the 47 years I have been eating German food (including 3+ years in Germany), the ""Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas"" food is the LEAST authentic & WORST German-labeled food I have EVER eaten!! 

small quantity was the BEST feature, as I did not waste food (left most on my plate) ...

My Jägerschnitzel was dry, tasteless, small & paper thin with not enough mushroom gravy to even cover it 

My spätzle were dry & tasteless, as well ...

This restaurant does NOT represent the German food tradition ... it has been Las Vegas-ized beyond German recognition!!   

ONLY in Vegas have I experienced bacon (bad bacon strips at that) & fake onion whatever on top of my Jägerdchnitzel ...

One of our friends was celebrating his birthday and chose to go here. I was genuinely excited about it. We showed up and the place looked cool. The music was alright and the atmosphere seemed nice. I am a bit of a beer snob so u was very excited to try a variety of German beer.  They offer 3 choices..... 3 lame ass choices. It's either a light, dark or a hefenweizen(sp). I love dark beer so I ordered that one. At 15 bucks a beer the size of it was beautiful. Large manly glass. The taste on the other hand sucked! I would have paid  maybe 7 bucks tops for it. It wasn't complete crap but I expected better. I ordered a plate consisting of two white sausages and a Bavarian pretzel. Knowing a little about German culture I was expecting manly sized portions. Boy was I wrong. I received two tiny sausages. The average bratwurst one buys at a local grocery store dwarfs these lame tiny links. The taste was okay but nothing special at all. At least I had my fresh Bavarian pretzel to look forward too. Wrong again! It was a decent size but it tasted like it had been sitting in a freezer all week long and had just been popped into a microwave for a minute before being served. I was expecting a large warm fresh soft pretzel. I received a room temperature, stale pretzel that tasted like crap.pretzel time or auntie m's would destroy this place in a pretzel competition. Over all, I am never going back to this sad excuse for a restaurant. If I want good food and beer I'm going to the Chicago brewing company.

Was in town on business, and tried to take some people there for dinner last night.  As we pulled up into the parking lot, we were greeted by the horrible sounds of a band trying to play Margaritaville (which actually sounded like a bad rendition of Karaoke).  But being that one guest had lived in Germany, he wanted to see the Hofbrauhaus.  

We were told by the hostess that it would be a 20 minute wait.  We asked for the ""beer garden"" area to get away from the music.  So we stood in the front bar area, chatted and watched some ESPN on the screens there.  After about 45 minutes, we grew impatient.  

I walked into the hall to go to the restroom.  As I did I noticed the back area / beer garden was maybe 1/4 occupied.  All kinds of tables were open!!  

I walked back to the front, and asked what the area was and the hostess said that is the beer garden.  When I asked about the number of open tables, she said - we dont have enough servers!!  (on a Thursday night before a weekend??)

We stayed for a bit, and then started to notice the staff's total lack of interest in customers, etc.  With this we left.",L0hIDvoJUMNHSK_vEWGiFA,1,1,1,52sS20-Jt2Imzwc7i6h-hA

The beer hall is painted very similar to its German patriarch and the smell of German cooking filled the air. I started off with a 0.5l dunkle as did my wife and we ordered a sausage sampler. The order came with potato salad, sauerkraut and a pair of pretzels. With the exception of the pretzels which were well overcooked the meal was a great sampling of food. Half way through eating an entertainer arrived playing traditional German music and did a great job getting the crowd involved. We decided to order another round, this time I ordered 1.0l helles, and stayed to enjoy the show. We both had a lot of fun singing and raising our mugs.

Parking is in the rear, it's not so bad getting in as long as you don't have old people blocking the walkway to the entrance. GRRRR WALK FASTER OLD PEOPLE!

Kraut, Vienerschnitzle which is a breaded pounded peice of meat....sausages...and spaetzle.Bleah. Needs ketchup or somethin. Dessert was a black forest cake. Eh...nothing really popped out at me. The food was eh....beer good.

4814634,2017-09-13,0,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"Wife and I had this on our radar/bookmarked for the last couple of visits to Las Vegas. When we found ourselves looking for something on a Saturday evening in September (not during Oktoberfest) we thought we would visit. We arrived at 9:30 on a Saturday Night, the place was not too full. No reservation and no wait.

We sat down and were waited on immediately by a wonderful waitress. We ordered two large beers, one original and one Dunkel and a pretzel with beer cheese. The beers were good but average in taste with the Dunkel preferred by both of us. The beer selection was not as extensive as we assumed it would be. The pretzel was light and fluffy and above average. The sausage platter was also just average with 4 smallish sausages that if it were not for the beer were just average and not exploding with tastiness. Then we had the apple strudel which should be called dough (although imported from Germany) with just a few apples and a ton of too rich and way too sweet sauce on top.

The best part is the atmosphere. You certainly feel transported away with the decor and the live oom pah pah music. The waitress wore attire that tried to look like a dirndl but it missed or never ""lifted"" and a few male waiters, but not all, wore lederhosen.

4815230,2012-10-31,1,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"I do my best to stop in at the Hofbrau every time I go to Vegas. It's a fun environment that brings a different style to the table in a town full of hotel bars and clubs. 

People have told me that the Hofbrau Las Vegas is an exact replica of the Hofbrau in Munich. I'm not happy to admit that when I was at the Hofbrau in Munich some years ago, things were a little blurry. Lets just say the Deutsch begin the festivities rather early on Easter Sunday. Either way, from my fuzzy memory the Vegas Hofbrau certainly has a very similar feel to the original. The beer is all the original Hofbrau brew, and they serve it in the traditional stein (although I don't remember them having a smaller one in Germany). Last time I went I got the Oktoberfest in Das Boot! I was a little upset that the boot was plastic, but it still turns into an endurance trial toward the end of the beer- which can be fun, or not so fun all depending.

The food is all traditional Bavarian style- so be ready for sausage and potatoes! I still have yet to encounter anything I disliked on the menu but I highly suggest getting a soft pretzel as an appetizer. The pretzel is huge and comes with an array of dipping selections- all of which are great.

I think the biggest difference between the original and Vegas location is how the entertainment is catered toward the crowd. The original had a very traditional German brass band sort of playing in the background. The Vegas Hofbrau certainly has a bit more of a 'showy' feel to it. They're constantly playing German drinking songs along with many popular songs to keep the crowd involved. They also play a bunch of games. Such as 'last man holding the stein wins'. Also, if you really want, the waitress will slap you on the ass with a paddle with a sound that will ring out though the entire building. I haven't done it myself. Not gonna lie, I'm afraid of getting tagged in the coin purse.

If you're looking for a different experience in the sometimes overly repetitive town of Las Vegas, I suggest hitting up the Hofbrau. In true fashion of the town, you probably won't leave sober, but you will have a unique experience and not be surrounded by the hotel bar hookers like the rest of the town.

Well this visit did not disappoint in fact my husband and friends are now big fans as well. Came here on a Friday night, a week before Christmas. The place was packed and in a very festive mood.

Than we shared a nice warm pretzel. It was perfect and hit the spot with the beer. For my main course wiener schnitzel with a side of German potato salad. My husband had a different variation with gravy and our friends the chicken. The food is heavenly exactly like it is in Germany except there I would get skinny French Fries. I prefer it with the Potato Salad as it is here it compliments the dish. For such a large portion it disappeared from my plate quickly. 

The music was terrific at times the band would play we all got up and danced. The table of frat boys danced as well. Than they would get shots of Jaiggermister and get spanked. My husband told me while we danced that this was his best Birthday ever. We bought framed photos that they took of our table as well as a glass stein and our friend I saw him the next day in a bright orange Hofbrau Haus t shirt.

    A few friends and family had told me some about it so I had an idea of what is was going to be or what to expect. 

   Well to be honest i was not very impressed, Its very loud inside, the hall they seat you in amplifies everything. It makes it very hard to hear the people your with let alone your server. The live band was not very good at all. maybe they had to many beers by the time we got there. Its way to open for my liking, I like the concept of long tables and you set with others. The room size is just not appealing. 

   I will say the food was very good but the menu is very limited compared to others I have visited. Mostly sausages with a few pork and beef options. I guess for a Vegas thing its a place to visit but as a local, its nothing really special. 

   It was very clean, the staff is very friendly and if you order a shot you can get spanked. This is the kind of place you gather up your trade show buddies and make a night of it drinking and getting spanked.

Being by myself on business, I don't like eating by myself. But they have really large tables that they sit out at, family style. So I kind of was sitting next to people in a way. Coupled with the live band and the other stuff going on, I felt like part of the festivities rather than the lone business traveler sitting at dinner.

They have a couple types of beer and a couple sizes. Of course, when the server asked me if I wanted a beer and I replied ""yes"", then I should have been more specific. Because he brought out the large one that made me sheepishly grin that I'd just ordered something that size. But it was delicious.

The food was uninspired, but then again, I think I should have gone with the server's recommendation. I had the meal with the various sausages and they didn't have enough flavor to my liking. 

Hopefully coming here again and grabbing something else to eat will elevate my opinion a bit more. But for beer drinkers, this is definitely a nice place to sip on one.",bl9uobe0rspOGrKJLH2Pgg,2,0,3,gguSbWfs1nf4z3qOLgLFiA

I automatically assume that since we're in America, it's going to be cheesy and touristy, and it totally is, right down to being able to order fake lederhosen from the gift shop catalog at your dinner table, but their food is delicious, and being a sucker for yummy German eats, these ones are fine by me.  

I'm not sure if the Hofbrauhaus here is expensive because it's in Las Vegas or because it's such a ridiculous tourist destination, but it's a bit pricey.  Good news is, you're getting a ton of meat and for this fat Austrian girl, I'm happy about that.  My absolute favorite, favorite must-have here is the schweinehauxen plate--a whole mallet of roast pig, creamy and fatty to perfection, with vinegary warm potato salad, and red cabbage...oh my yes.  I really have never had anything bad here, but I usually end up getting some sort of plate involving a huge bratwurst, ham, and pork cutlets (most plates being in the $15-$20 range each).  The leibekase is also one of our favorites as is the cold cucumber salad.  Beer is, of course, served in get-you-drunk steins and it is nice that they have rotating seasonal varieties to choose from as well as several flavors of schnapps as your after-dinner apertif true to German custom.  

Don't expect to come here and be able to hear yourself think or even have a conversation with your table mates that's above shouting level.  The band is loud and constant, as is yelling and stupid antics by all the drunk douchebags that will inevitably be surrounding you.  Needless to say, it's like going to Oktoberfest inside a restaurant...tons of frat boys who can't hold their beers trying to dance on tables or harrass the waitresses or fighting over who won the stein-holding competition at the end of the evening.  Luckily, the space is huge (yet unfortunately echoey) and there are tons of long, family style tables with benches where you can get away from the stage and the band if you want.  There usually seems to be some sort of conference or wedding or birthday party happening here when we come to eat, especially because it stays open fairly late for dinner hours, but does close at 11 PM.  

If you're coming with a big group, you might have to wait for a bit...there is sometimes a line and people usually stay for quite awhile to party.  Luckily, there's a tiny bar in the lobby you can have a drink in while you wait if you want and you can always peruse the gift shop to buy that blue lederhosen you've had your eye on!",3hfz4MWc14zWNrrBi6wXEg,5,4,4,S3bwrvzUqQA2GzO85DIVqA

This restaurant is large and if you come during the day, there is a lot of space and usually isn't very crowded. I've never been at night so I can't comment on that. I miss the rowdiness that comes with a large crowded tent but they try to make up for it with live music and games. 

The steins are poured perfectly and the food is good! They've got lots of different options to satisfy your cravings. I love getting all of the different sausages with potato.

Unfortunately, I don't drink, so I was very much sober and aware of what shortcomings the place had. 

Drunk or not, there is no denying that this is a fun atmosphere. You won't see anyone at this place not having a good time. Food is surprisingly good, too. All right, I got that out of the way. Don't expect to be able to hold a conversation with all the noise going on, though.

Sadly, it ends there. First and foremost, the service is TERRIBLE. The servers only visit your table every once in a while. Granted, the place usually IS busy, but why not just hire more staff? They clearly are understaffed to accommodate the numbers of people they get in there.

On top of that, the staff are RUDE. The woman waiting on us last time (I believe her name was Maria) WOULD NOT LET ME ORDER OFF OF THE KIDS MENU. She gave me a rude, blank look and just bluntly said I couldn't. I've been to countless restaurants, fast-food and dine-in alike, and this is the only time this has ever happened. I can't always eat the full amount of food in an entree, and this is completely unforgivable that we would receive this kind of treatment. When I come into a place and my party spends $600+, I not only expect no disputes like this, I expect my ass to be kissed. 

And if that remark in the last paragraph didn't already tell you, it's EXPENSIVE. Granted, my party consumed a LOT of alcohol, but ANY other place would have been cheaper than this for a similar purpose.

If you want to go out and have a drunken, fun evening with friends, this is the place for you - go for it. Just be prepared to deal with high prices and rude staff that think of themselves more as party planners than servers.

For anyone that knows lechon, this is crispy skin at its ultimate!  A fabulous job on making that piece of meat visually appetizing and tasty! 

They were also offering their Famous Bavarian Dumpling Soup for $5.50 and the HB-Dessert Tower of ""Bavarian Cream with marinated Blueberries, Quark Strudel with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, and Black Forest Cake with Chocolate Sauce"" for $9.95.  

One friend ordered #310 Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl. ""Sausage at its Best! Three roasted Pork Sausages with Sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes"" for $13.50.  The sausage was pretty tasty with a good flavor.

I went for their side of Spatzel ($4.50) and Mushroom Gravy ($2.95) because it's something simple and I like their gravy sauce here.

We also enjoyed their seasonal roasted pecans and almonds.  By the back, there's a cart making roasted candied pecans and almonds for $3.50 a bag or two for $7.  Pretty yummy stuff, especially when the nuts are still hot!

Hofbrauhaus is a place with a great atmosphere where you are bound to chat it up and drink a bit with your neighbors.  It's definitely not a pretentious crowd here, and you'll see people from all ages doing shots of jager.

Everyone else ordered more authentic meals and seemed pleased. Those plate prices were much higher than my hamburger, and then with all the beers the bill was very high.

Hofbräuhaus you ROCK.  Just when I thought this non-drinking brown girl would feel like an out of place minority in a German Beer Hall, you actually made me feel right at home. LOUD! LAUGHTER! LOVE IT.

Dance on the tables? Sure.

Holding up your stein glass without a care of spilling it on anyone.? Absolutely.

Laughing and shouting with everyone having a good time in their own drunken stupor? You bet.

I'm brown so I eat rice a lot.  Needless to say, I am a German Food virgin.  The German speaking boyfriend recommended I try the brat and sauerkraut --yes! I have never had a brat!! So I tried the Nürnberger Rostbratwürstl.  It was tasty, and I can do without the sauerkraut but I much preferred the boyfriend's savory dish- some kind of Schnitzel... shcnotzel...i have no idea.  Just ask for the breaded whatever with the vinegary potato salad :)

This place isn't for you if you despise loud dining establishments.  
Come only if you feel like dancing on tables (go-go dancing experience not required!) and having loads of loud fun.

Fun events?  Stein Holding contests and Oktoberfest beer.

Hurry up and try this place!

There are a few drawbacks to it. 

#1.  It's outside the strip, it's like right across from Hard Rock Hotel
(Do you see a growing theme of me making lists)
#2 If you don't have a car, I have to walk drunk all the way to the Hard Rock Hotel.
#3 I got spanked by a wooden panel at the Hofbrauhaus. 

Now that I have your attention again and away from me complaining about how far it is from the strip. Let me explain the spanking. 

Apparently one of my friends who has been there knew that if you get a shot you get spanked.  My friend asked me if I wanted a shot, to my surprise I was like ""SURRRE!!!!!!""
 
My shot comes out and it's in a wooden paddle that has holes in it for the shots to fit in.  I didn't think anything less of it.   So I have my shot of Jager and then the waitress tells me to come over and bend over.  Apparently I will get spanked by her with the paddle. 

Now let me say that this chick didn't go easy on me and gave me such a hard spanking that the fat of my butt cheeks went through the holes of the paddle.  I was jumping up and down in pain.  

It actually hurt sitting down after that.  I was humiliated, there are pictures somewhere out there of that event and I will get my revenge on that waitress and friends.  

In conclusion if you want to impose pain to a friend please take them here.

The food is good. If you like sausages, you should be quite happy; even the salad comes with them.  The briny half-chicken is above average, the schnitzel is enormous, and the large pretzels are, unsurprisingly, great with the liters of German beer.

They have a bar, but the beer is obviously what to stick with if you want to be properly in the spirit of the place.  The dunkel gives you more flavor for your $14/L.   You can fortify it with shots of schnapps that the dirndl-clad army of waitresses will tempt you with approximately four times an hour.  

There are two areas, both indoor; a large one where live music plays and a second, somewhat smaller room that is decorated as faux beer garden.  This is where a little luck comes into play; if you arrive at a good hour, you'll not only get a table in the main room, but also you'll be surrounded by people who know the customs of beer hall songs and toasts.  Without this unpredictable element (if you're not bringing your own with you), your time at the Hofbrauhaus can easily fall short of mine.

I went here with visions of pork shoulder, giant soft pretzles, and, of course, liters of delicious beer.

I guess one out of three ain't bad.

This Hofbrauhaus isn't much to look at outside, but once you step in the dining hall, you realize very quickly what you're getting into. The setup is very true to the original: high celings, an oompah band, and short skirted waitresses. Slowly, however, things started seeping in. The closest thing that the band came to a genuine German song was the 'chicken dance'. I looked all around for those big pretzles that compliment their beer so much, only to find out that the pretzle that comes with your meal is of the small, hard variety.  I was very dissapointed at the size of the portions, too. My girlfriend got a sausage entree & it came with a minimum of sides: a pretzle. We had to share my plate, the 'Schweinebraten'.  The food was good, but I really expected more. Aren't German dishes supposed to fill you up?

I was very satisfied with the beer, though. It tasted like it did three years ago, and they stick to the original or dunkel. When it comes to beer, you don't come here for variety, you come for quality.

Also, it was really loud, so don't come here expecting a nice, quiet dinner with your sweetheart.

To recap: The food was good, but a ripoff, the beer was great, & the atmosphere mediocre at best. I know I set the bar high, but even with that factored in it wasn't that great of an experience. Would I come back? Only if someone else is paying.",L7gJwgcFiMgGx1tF2r_BRg,1,0,2,GhmentLQTBNENwnDd6DwGg

Tourist Trap

Being from Chicago, we have many excellent choices for German restaurants, which gives us a little credit for knowing what we are talking about.  In addition, we ate and drank at the Hoffbrau in Munich.  Based on those qualifications, I wouldn't recommend spending your money here.  

Everything is way overpriced, and they aren't embarrassed by it.  The pretzel appetizer was good, and the sausage platter my wife had was good, but my jaeger schnitzel was terrible.  There wasn't any thing schnitzel about it.  It was just a breaded pork cutlet sauced jaeger style.  It's not schnitzel until it is pounded flat.  That cutlet didn't experience hammer blow one.

The beer was excellent.  It was very fresh.  We were fortunate enough to be there for the tapping of the dunkel wheat, which was done by a Vegas performer, and 15 minutes later had a glass at our table.  I had the maibock, which was still very good for this late in the year (June).  

The place didn't look anything like Munich and the beer garden looked kind of stupid being indoors.  I understand why it's hard to have an outdoor beer garden in Vegas,  but it just looked ridiculous.  No offense to the people who did the actual work, it was just a bad idea from the start.

Our waitress was very nice and timely, the servers seemed busy and the bus boys were also working hard.

I don't know what they brought me but it wasn't a jager.  Very bland and tasteless. Wait staff were generally surly and not happy to be there. Also the beers--which were quite good--were not filled to the measuring line like they do in Germany.  When you are paying $14.95 for a liter of beer, you expect a full mug. I asked my waitress about this and she said there was nothing she could do about it because the mugs were filled automatically.   Wrong answer. The band was decent.  For music and beer, not a bad place but it was my second visit and I arranged to stay nearby just so I could come to this place again.  I will not be back.

Being an avid yelper, I decided to read up on some reviews. 
After reading the reviews, I was a little nervous about going, to be honest.  I was really worried that  I wouldn't like any of the food...especially after reading the menu...I'm not really big on pork products, and there is a lot of pork on the menu. lol

So...we got there, and walked in, and were seated...
What a HUGE hall!  
At first, I was uncomfortable...it felt like it was a million and a half degrees in that place.  Oddly enough, the more I ate and drank, the better I felt. ;)

The atmosphere here is definitely one of carefree partying.  
Its loud.  There is lots of singing, music, shouting, chanting, and spanking.
I had a blast.

I personally did not have any shots...something about being spanked by a stranger with a paddle is not super appealing to me.  Maybe in the bedroom with someone I know, but not in public...those ladies looked pretty strong too. :)

Now onto what was ordered:

Beer:
I ordered the Hefeweizen, which was awesome.  The half liter was $8...it lasted me the whole time we were there, so it was a good value, but...I'm a slow beer drinker.  The other beers were really good too.  (I tasted everyone's.)

Food:
I ordered:
A pretzel:  Pretty good.  Salty, but not overly so.  
The potato pancakes with smoked salmon:  THIS was delicious.  I'm a sucker for potato pancakes, but there were divine.  The salmon was delicious, and the presentation was great.  (I'll upload a picture as soon as I can.)
German Potato Soup:  This was DELICIOUS!  My favorite of the night. :)
The Majoram/ (Veal sausages):  Since I'm not a big fan of pork products, I had intended on getting fish or chicken...but when I saw that there were veal sausages for the same price as the chicken...I opted for those.  They were tasty.  2 sausages served over mashed potatoes, with a red cabbage sauerkraut.  (I wasn't a fan of the red cabbage.)

All in all the quality of the food was good.  
However...
Between myself and my roommate, we spent $85 on 3 beers, two entrees, and two small starters.  
I could have eaten better food for half that cost elsewhere, but all in all, for a fun night out for a friend's birthday, it was a fun place to go.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,4,2,4,tuClhEakYWhDeViW6vFxYA

We figured we could at least grab some cold German beers and comfort food here, and that's what we got. They have all your wursts and schnitzels here; I got the schnitzel that wasn't all breaded and fried, and I thought it was pretty good, but like most other items on the menu a bit overpriced. I'd been here once before just to grab a cold brew and it's surprising that they don't have a lot of different beers here; there's only a few varieties, if memory serves. I just went with a lager, which was a refreshing accompaniment to my hearty meal. We were kept entertained during the meal by the one-man band playing his heart out on the stage.

I admit staying at the Hard Rock Hotel on this trip to Vegas just because you are directly across the street. (Turned out to be a big mistake as Hard Rock is a terrible hotel choice)

We went for Valentine's Dinner. How romantic is that, right?!! I made reservations even though they weren't needed. When we entered the restaurant, there were approximately 10 people waiting for a table, but we were seated right away.

Make sure you get one of the $12.95 pretzels as an appetizer. Best thing on the menu!

There was a special menu available including: 

+ Tomato Cream Soup garnished with Pretzel croutons and chives. Delicious!
+ Chicken Schnitzel garnished with green asparagus and sauce Choron, served with parsley Yukon Gold Potatoes. Sadly, this plate was sold out by the time we got there. :( I ended up eating an enormous plate of sausage. nom nom nom.
+ Valentine's Crepe ""Romanoff"" served with vanilla ice cream, marinated strawberries and whipped cream. They have an amazing whipped cream. 

One of the fun things about this place is watching the all female chugging contest. The women all introduce themselves before downing their beer. Based on their looks, we placed bets on who the winner would be. I went with a puffy faced girl wearing a Wisconsin sweatshirt (how could I go wrong!?). The winner ended up being some girl from Santa Barbara with NO gag reflex what-so-ever. She didn't breathe once while downing her beer. (I'm fairly certain all females from Santa Barbara have no gag reflex, but that is for another site.)

One strange part of the dinner was the main guy on stage wearing lederhosen. He was announcing everything and singing on the microphone. He honestly sounded like Alvin from the Chipmunks. It was so bizarre. 

One of the better moments was another guy blowing the ""Alphorn"". There was a wedding party eating dinner and they got the bride up on stage. She was wearing a tiny skirt and they placed the large end of the Alphorn between her legs and.......well....... they blew her. Watching her face was hilarious. The horn blower announced that she was now ""ready to go!""

I walked by this very large building too many times and convinced myself I should stop in.

Impressive. Huge ceilings and lots of space, exactly what I would picture a drinking hall to look like. The gift shop seemed kind of cheesy but I put that out of mind as I sat down.

First off, this place is really intended for groups. Large tables with bench seating simply screams party. And there was a party going on with a performer. Overall the experience is pretty intimidating. Sat down, ordered some beer and spent maybe 20 minutes looking over an incredibly large menu.

So far, it's a 3 out of 5 experience, but the food was really good. Nice fresh pretzels with homemade mustard. Good currywurst, and an even better jagerschnitzel. The beer, well, it seems to have high scores but I didn't find them particularly interesting. I don't claim to have the golden tongue, but different strokes for different folks.

I love Vegas because two of my favorite things are in one place!  Eating and Clubbing! The Hofbrauhaus is a GREAT place for ridiculously delicious German food.  I had the schnitzel, because I mean, come on, you can't NOT get Schnitzel from a German restaurant.  When the plate came out, it was HUGE! OMG! Two people could have shared one and still had leftovers, it was that massive.  The schnitzel came with gravy and spatzle and my oh my, it was AMAZING!!  I've been to Germany and had Schnitzel, so this took me right back to Europe.  I'm so bummed that I couldn't eat the whole thing, but if you ever visit Vegas, this place is a must!!!

As for the experience I was talking about.  Seating is communal in the sense that their tables look like giant picnic tables where you can sit with your own party or join other groups of people.  The beer comes in these HUGE jars that are used for ""Prost""-ing, which is the German term for ""Cheers"".  This act of saying cheers is slightly frightening when surrounded by a bunch of drunk people.  At the Hofbrauhaus, it's common for people to stand in their seats and when they ""Prost"" they slam their glasses together in the hopes of exchanging beer into each other's glass.  A forewarning, be prepared to leave drenched in beer with potential glass shards on your clothes.  When the energy level goes up in this place, it gets loud, rowdy, and chaotic!  In addition, when you order a shot of Jagermeister, after you take the shot, they use a large wooden paddle and, literally, spank you with it!  It's hilarious to watch after you've already had a few, but when you get paddled, don't expect to sit down right away!

With all that being said, if you're in Vegas and want the perfect place for a great time with great food and great company, this is most definitely the spot to hit!",3cJsY18AzCmb-JzEF1Kizw,1,0,5,Lh8L7YvMSerz6N2hHN_9yw

I would recommend ordering an extra pretzel because there is a good amount of liver mousse and Obazda. For dinner I ordered Marjoram (Veal Bratwurst) which was amazing! It comes with a side of red cabbage which was so tasty. For desert I ordered Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte (Black Forest Chocolate Cake).

We moved our party ""outside"" to the fake courtyard, where we could hear ourselves talk. The calm area was nice and had a painted ceiling to give the illusion of the outdoors. There were TVs to show the shenanigans of the belly of the beast, as well as a Jägermeister shot toting dominatrix, trading paddle driven ass smacks and shots for a few bucks. 

I wasn't expecting much from the food, but most of it was pretty good and fairly priced. All the sausages I tried were good and I ended up wishing I got a sausage platter instead of the large fried pork cutlet;

The large communal dining area are filled with tables and benches. Unless you come with a large party, there is a chance that you will sit next to random strangers. This style of dining has seriously caught my interest as of late because I am always interested in other patrons thought on menu items. 

The waitresses are all dressed up in country style outfits. Looking around, they reminded me of a more natural attractive look than places on the strip. Our waitress was pushy in a playful way and quick to guide us to some of their most popular dishes. 

The beers and food are on the pricey side. They highly rely on their touristy appeal. With the prices comes a relatively large portion as well. We started with two half liters of the Oktoberfest beer and their signature soft pretzel with a sweet mustard, spicy mustard, and a cheese spread made from cream cheese and brie. This was magnificent. At first, I was hesitant because the size of our neighbors pretzel was huge. I did not want to load up on unnecessary carbs, but once it hit our table, it stood no chance. 

Once the doughy treat was devoured, we ordered the three pork sausages served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The warm pickled cabbage was good, but the mash had very little flavor besides cream. The pork sausages were mild and tender. 

I am normally not a fan of this cuisine because it is on the heavy side. Splitting an appetizer and an entree was enough for two of us. There was no real big complaints about the experience, but it was just ok.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,3,eFg81n09M5TpACnFnYiy0Q

You'll notice the Jagermeister shot girls working the floor.  Apparently if you opt to do a Jager shot with these gals they'll spank you with a vented paddle that reminds me a frat house spanking stick.

I'm normally a fan of schnitzel, but I thought I'd try something different this time. I went with the Sauerbraten (German pot roast) and while it was very tasty, the meat wasn't very tender at all. Definitely not horrible, but I'll stick with the Jägerschnitzel next time.

Parking is available in the back, but the lot isn't the biggest.  We ended up parking at the Hyatt next door (signage seemed to indicate it was allowed but I can't be sure).

While waiting in front, there's a bar area where you can chill over a beer or two, or browse the souvenir shop.

The main dining room of this location is noticeably smaller than its German big brother, but they did a lot of work painting the interior to match the real deal.  Special mention goes to the ceiling artwork.  The back of the hall has an ""outdoor"" dining room that is quite stunning.  It's fully indoors, but the sky-painted ceilings and decor really make you think you're dining on a patio.  This outdoor room is reserved for special occasions though.

There was a football match the day we went, so they had TVs wheeled out.

There's this one guy hired to play the alpenhorn, and he was go around making sure everyone was slightly drunk and happy.  Not the same as the real band in Munich, but he kept us all amused.

Beers are available in 0.3L, 0.5L, and 1.0L varieties.  Hopefully you know your metric.  One great thing about weissbier (wheat beer) is that it goes down easy.  There are different varieties for you to try as well.  And for the most authentic experience, you obviously want the biggest glass.  I don't even think they have the smaller ones in Germany, but that was a few years back.

Food is quite delightful and quite authentic, but not for everyone.  Many of the foods are pickled.  The sausages were decent but a bit on the mushy side.  But I really enjoyed their pickled beet salad (mush?) and sauerkraut - both quite good.

Service was prompt and very friendly.  Wi-Fi is available, but it was quite spotty.

The only thing is that this place can get pricey really quickly.  At some $20 a dish and $10 for a beer, you can see how this can get expensive if you have a family.

Of course, at the end, be sure to swing by the souvenir shop if you didn't do so at the beginning.  Much of the swag doesn't say ""Las Vegas"" on it, so if you wanted to trick someone into thinking you went to Germany..

Overall, a fun time.  Not exactly what you'd experience as a tacky tourist in Germany, but actually quite close.",tgrs5VQ6thhouiEtMU-N_w,0,0,3,6Y6xEE4PVUlQmD6-gZm9XQ

The place is designed for good times.  They encourage you to stand on tables.  They want you to have fun.  They prefer you to be loud in your proclaimed enjoyment of beer.  The mood is pretty light and enjoyable.

The food is pretty excellent and decent portions.  There were a lot of things that looked tempting, but I tried the chicken sausages with a generous helping of tasty mashed potatoes.  Prices ran about $15-20 a plate.  The beer steins are huge, and I had even gotten a ""medium"" that led to a comfortable buzz.  If I can finagle a way to come here without driving, I want one of the ridiculous sized ones.

There is a ton of audience participation.  They really want to get the crowd involved whether up on stage, or if they come to you in the crowd.  It wasn't one of those awkward vibes where they will force unwilling restaurant patrons to get involved, but if you want to participate, they most definitely will accommodate.

The only issue that I had during my outing was during the cash handling at the end.  We had a BIG birthday group, and those things always become hectic with a lot of separate checks.  The problem was that due to a miscommunication, the status of whether someone within our party already covered all our expenses versus if we still needed to pay became a back and forth ""yes/no/yes/no"" issue that while resolved, I wasn't sure if it was until credit card statements were checked.  But to her credit, our server was very patient and was trying very hard to get everything sorted out amongst the beer chants and drinking contests.  I think in a smaller group, that won't be an issue.

I will check out Hofbrauhaus again.  Between the lively atmosphere, friendly staff, tasty food and copious amounts of beer, it's a hard place to be bummed out in.  Just keep your party under 40 people, and it should be fine for an unique dining experience.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,1,4,4,HMkEzKcp7nmAI-Vol4Jo1A

5471101,2013-06-27,5,cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA,"This review is based solely on the really good Vegan Frankfurters they have here. First off, that was a surprise, to see they even had a Vegetarian section that also had Frankfurters! And were they good; they come with a tangy curry and a side of fries (you can sub for a salad if you want). 

Spidey and I came here to try out another German restaurant, and this one always comes up, so we thought, why not?

The inside is made out to look like a German hall, complete with long tables were you are forced to sit close to strangers. It's a very nice place, very open and bright, but I can see that when they get busy, it would be very crowded. As it was a weekday afternoon, there weren't that many people there. 

So we got the radish dish to start, which is a work of art. They give you a mound of spiral radish and ones shaped like flowers amongst slices of buttered bread with chives. Really good.

Spidey got some meat smothered in gravy with a dumpling that she really liked. For dessert we got the apple strudel and the black forest cake, all very good.

The food was good, but the service lacked a lot here. Like I stated before, there were not many people here (less than 20) but we were there for well over 2 hours, waiting mostly for our things. The dessert was the worst part, because our waitress came over and asked if we had gotten it yet. No. We had not. So she had to go and get it, which took a very long time. 

I would go back just to have the vegan furters again, but other than that, I wouldn't.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,5,4,4,ogMesRNJHI-rMrOSrqeBag

I disagree with that wise man on this issue as I not only think, but I know that if zee Germans had won zee war, we'd all be going to places like Hofbrauhaus on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. and you know what? I'm fine with that.

Well, I guess not the whole ""master race"" stuff, but really, more areas should have a Hofbrauhaus in their backyard as there is seriously some good times to be had in what I'm happy to say is a complete sausage fest! 

You would have to be a complete dummkopf to not have a lot of fun here. 

This sort of establishment, atmosphere and general wildness can really only be found during Oktoberfest in most places. So to have this go on nightly in the Vegas Hofbrauhaus.. that's something special. 

Then you have Das Boot! Yes, DAS BOOT! Because really, if you even know a little bit of German, you'd realize that everything needs to be said in a very stern and loud voice or you're not speaking the language correctly. Though you don't need to speak anything but drunk here.. And Das Boot will help. 

If you've seen the film Beerfest, this place has a Das Boot glass that you can chug down your booze in. Just remember to twist it at the end or you'll have a full load of beer coming at you. It is a little pricey if you're going for the glass one, but if you just want Das Boot, they have a plastic one. 

As for the food.. It's DELICIOUS! Not to mention very large when it comes to portion sizes. Now I'm not that much of a sauerkraut fan, but I ate the whole damn plate of it when it was in front of me. Though, perhaps that was also to soak up some of the copious amounts of alcohol that I drank while listening to the band play. 

I'm sure the house band cycles through songs every two hours. Either that or I just got really really German in my time here and felt like I knew the songs by heart. Those two semesters in PCC couldn't have taught me that much, could they?

Now they only have two beers here and two beers only. But the lack of selection  is made up by the massive amount of booze. and really, when trying to polish off a huge plate of frankfurters and kraut, who wouldn't want a good pilsener? Just don't forget your Lederhosen

For those seeking an even bigger kink, order the shots! A fraulein comes out with them on a paddle so you and a couple of friends can swing them down. Then said Frau bends you over and gives you a whack with the wooden paddle, Mit Vergnügen!!!! And who wouldn't want to get spanked with the same paddle that your shots were brought out on? Ich weiss nicht?

If visiting the Vegas area or you're a local and haven't come already, make sure you suggest it to your group, NEIN! Insist that you go at once!

When you first walk into Hofbrauhaus it feels like you have been transported to a beer hall somewhere in Germany or that region. I haven't been to that part of the world but people that have told me it does so I have to say they did a good job on the decoration of the place. Even the employees dress up. They have live music and the tables are more communal with a long bench so you never know who you will end up striking conversation with.

The food is great. I had their platter called Hofbrauhaus Platte. Basically a big plate with different stuff on it. It had Smoked pork loin, pork roast, smoked sausage, dark beer sauce, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. Everything was flavorful and tender. I had the seasonal Hofbräu Hefe Weizen Dunkel or a dark wheat beer. It was good though I prefer their Hofbräu Hefe Weizen which is a light wheat beer.

The shots you can do also gets you a spanking! haha

The prices may seem high but for what this place provides which is excellent entertainment and an experience plus great food it is worth going to.

We were here about a week and a half ago hanging out and having beers. When it was time to pay the tab and leave, the server hands back the receipt with a massive charge for stuff we didn't even order. Then, only when asked what the deal was with the charge, he's like, ""Oh... I messed up."" We asked to speak with the manager, and he comes over and immediately gets argumentative with my fiancee.

The food, subpar at best. My table was ready for a trip to the fatherland. Germans looking for German fare. We all agreed we should of gone with the sausage tower and beers. Kept it simple, meat, beer and pretzels. No brainer. Alas, that was not choice we made.

This replica does a good job of giving those a German experience who do not or cannot go all the way to Germany for the real thing. They spent a lot of money inside to cave the ceiling similar to the one in Germany, the music is mostly German bands who have been contracted and play authentic German music, and the beer has been imported from Germany as well. The beer is very good, however some people judge because it is not made in house, but that would also require a brewery so it is understandable.

The food also seems to be mostly imported from Germany, like specific sausages and the sauerkraut. My favorite are the Nuremberger sausages with mashed potatoes and the  obatzter cheese appetizer. Both super German and excellent dishes. I also know a lot of people who ordered the Wurstplatte, a variety of German sausages on one plate. Great for big meat eaters and hungry patrons. 

As for the ambiance, think loud, group style seating, would not suggest this for a date place or quiet night out. This is a girls/guys group night out, bachelor party type loud and craziness can sometimes go on here. Tons of tourists come here  as well, and they are usually young people wanting to drink and get spanked or old Germans trying out their known cuisine. 

Don't go to this place for the service or food, it is all about the ambiance here. Sitting next to and conversing with strangers from wherever, drinking real German beer, and listening to a German band play super loud music echoing in the beer hall. If you want to check it out but are afraid to sit in the big open loud hall you can always retreat to the beer garden which is enclosed in the back part of the Hofbrauhouse and is usually quieter. During busy times they will seat you there and you can get full service as well.  I would recommend reservations if bringing anymore then 2-3 people with you as night time (especially during Oktoberfest or other holiday times) as it can be packed with a long wait. Monday nights are usually the slowest and day time lunch you never really have to wait to be seated so you can also try a quieter lunch still getting the experience.",BIcfTJw4-76b9NuZUgpKIA,2,3,4,mJMK9uwhu_uyDN1ESr1ykw

Now for those who have been to the original in Munich, don't expect the same experience.  The Munich one has been around for a long time and is both a local hangout and a tourist attraction plus the beer isn't quite the same.  Still The LV version provides a taste of the german brew house.  The pretzels are unique to the area and bigger than your head.  The schnitzel is excellent and the portions large.  The beer pricing is reasonable and it is always fun to waive a liter of beer around.  The band always gets the crowd up on the tables and the servers are friendly.  Watch out for the paddle!!!

Great place just across from the HRH in an area that is starting to get a late night crowd as more pubs open nearby.  There is free valet parking (tip those guys, they work hard) or you can park for free at the hotel next door.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,5,2,5,ukuGkCDEYAXGmYYbxSJmfQ

We get seated in the bier hall.  Bier is good, imported from Munich, and HB bier is excellent.  I had a Dunkel, a Dunkelweiss, and an Original.  All great, especially the original.

Service is a bit brusque and abrupt; I guess they are trying to act Germanic.  The food is OK, but it is mass produced.  Not high quality by any means.

When our food came out, and you need to eat a schnitzel while it's hot, the band immediately struck up the Star Spangled Banner.  We all, of course, stand and face the large flag.  The performance dragged on while our food got cold.  I am all for patriotism, but this seemed a bit strange.  

Next, a guy at another table wanted to be spanked by the large waitress.  OK, this is their schtick. I get it.  Well, it was right at us while we are eating.  Then the waitress turns to us and makes comments about the guy she spanked; really, we do not care!

We sat down at the bar they have outside the restaurant and he got the hefeweizen and I just got their lager.  I loved the baby mug (10oz or .3L) that I got.  I have to go back one day after work and buy like 2 of them.  I have issues with these baby mugs!  The lager was good and light but I taste the hefeweizen and about had a heart attack!  It was the best hefeweizen I have ever tasted.  My boyfriend was going over the food and was drooling.  He hasn't had German food since he was there so we made reservations to come back that night.

We came back at 7pm and were seated right away.  Ordered each of us a liter of hefeweizen and pretzel and brie cheese app.  OMG the brie cheese concoction, delicious!!!  I just wanted to eat it alone it was sooooo good.  We shared the 3 different sausage plate which came with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  We also ordered potato salad.  German potato salad is different, more vinegar, but still yummy.  The sausage was good too, one was my favorite but don't remember what was in it.  The food came out fast and the waitress are friendly even with crazy drunks around.  While we were eating they had a band playing traditional German music and also some American.

First great quality was our waitress. She was very friendly and attentive. The food was also very tasty..and the portions are pretty big. The main drawback were the prices though. 

We had to share the meals because we knew we weren't going to be able to drink and eat without going broke. We got the Hofbrauhaus Plate, which consisted of Smoked pork loin, pork roast, smoked sausage with dark beer sauce, side of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. 

The smoked pork loin was my favorite. I loved how tender and delicious it was when you took a bite of it and combine it with the sauerkraut and potatoes. Yummers! 

The Grillhendl was also ordered. Which is an Oktoberfest style Roasted Half chicken stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions served crispy brown with homemade Bavarian potato salad. The chicken was really good! I mean really good people...order this! The chicken was moist and very well seasoned. I wish they would change the potato salad to mashed potatoes instead because they would go better with the chicken. But I really liked this plate...would have been nice to have enjoyed it on my own instead of sharing it :( 

The atmosphere of the place was fun. The bad is very entertaining and of course the people getting spanked is a riot.

This place is huge including the dining hall and another room where the bier garten is. This room was really pretty where you can have a private party of just sit around and enjoy some hearty brews with friends and family. They have a life-size version of Jenga to play and a beer pong table for those that are looking to get hammered!

We were greeted warmly by the hostess who seated us at a loooong wooden table, room enough for 16 people comfortably. Our server, darn forgot her name but super sweet and friendly provided us with menus and took our drink order.  She brought us out our drinks which consisted of a 1.0 liter stein of Dunkel and a tasty Hefeweizen. Mom had a glass of her favorite Moscato. We started out with a warm pretzel just perfectly baked served with hot mustard, sweet mustard and this amazing garlic cheese. The pretzel was so yummy. They feature live music going on every night and they definitely encourage participation. The performed a rendition of Edelweiss on german bells, this wasn't easy for this guy but his performance was terrific! 

Hubby ordered the Sauerbraten - marinated pot roast  served ""bavarian style"" with red wine sauce, veggie strips, homemade spatzle and red cabbage. This meal went perfect with his Dunkel beer. I enjoyed the Grillhendl - Oktoberfest style roasted half chicken stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions, served with Bavarian potato salad. This chicken was so moist and I could taste the beer butter. Mom ordered the Gegrillte Hahnchenbrust - Grilled chicken breast with a creamy mushroom sauce and homemade spatzle garnished with crispy fried onions. Our daughter, trying to go vegan ordered Gegrillte Veganische Frankfurter - two grilled vegan frankfurters served with french fries and curry sauce. Everyone was extremely satisfied with their meals. They were all served hot out of the kitchen and with a smile.

Next came the big surprise, since it was hubby's birthday I ordered him a Take a Shot, Get a Swat. He wasn't overly excited about this, but I thought it would add some pizazz to his birthday. Yeah, pizazz and Pain! The busty server came over looking ready and able. Hubby bent over and she paddled him good.  Thank goodness for the Jagermeister shot! Little did I know, that paddling stung!

Don't mind not being able to hear your dinner partner and sitting next to strangers? If you answered ""Jå"" then Hofbrauhaus is your next stop in Vegas!

I've been to Hofbrauhaus four times now, twice during the day and twice at night, and I can say that Hofbrauhaus is so fun. I've been here three times with my sister, once with my aunt and uncle who lived in Germany and once with Beau S., and regardless of the company, I have a great time. If you have a large group, this is definitely the place to check out. 

I've never once had to wait for a table. I've only eaten in the beer garden and it gets LOUD. Between the musicians, the chants of ""Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi,"" the ambient noise, and the steins clinking or crashing to the ground, it gets so loud, having a conversation is a bit pointless. 

If you're not an agoraphobic recluse that's cool with sitting next to strangers, you'll love this place. I highly recommend the obatzter cheese appetizer and the potato soup. Also, the sauerbraten is good, but I'd not order the gigantic fried chicken cutlet (I forgot the name and IDK if they even serve it anymore) stick to the super German stuff and you'll be fine.

The inside looked like the shrunken version of the original one, down to the tiny stage for the band.  Sadly, it also lacked a lot of the charm the original one had.  If the restaurant wanted to provide the guests with the ""typical"" German aloofness to their service, they did that well.  The staff wasn't overly friendly, and it seemed the hostess or the gift shop clerk really didn't want to be there.  

Well, I guess you don't visit this place for service, but for, what else? the beer! The beer was good, and I guess for $7.99 not the most expensive one we've paid for. The sodas though.. close to $4 for a soda! Ouch.  The price of 2 sodas came to the price of 1 beer?

The lunch menu was decently priced, with plenty of of German comfort dishes, it was hard to pick just one.

The seating is communal around some large picnic tables.  We were sitting with a nice German family who were very nice but didn't sprecken sie English

Had the Currywurst for my dinner and it was super tasty.  The German family dining next to us was eating the schnitzel and it looked really good as well.  I had trouble making up my mind when it came time to order.  No such difficulty when it came time to order my beverage.  ""I'll have a liter of Hefe bitte""

They also had a pretty good umpah band playing the night we were there, with all the authentic German beer fest tunes.  Sweet Caroline, Who the F is Alice and so on...    Would not hesitate to go back here the next time I find myself in Vegas.

I have to preface my review by stating that I don't eat pork or drink beer - which is their main thing being a German beer establishment. Still, they had several dinner options with chicken, fish, beef, and vegetables for me to choose from. 

Food quality: Super duper mediocre. I tried their fish and potato salad, and ate about 30% of my food. Also had a pretzel with cheese dip for an appetizer. Wetzels pretzels or any other mall shop does a way better job! 

Atmosphere: This is their main thing- People come here to take shots and get smacked in their butts with wooden paddles and then getting hugged by their waitresses. Most people looked like their butts were hurting, or they were going to be hurting soon from drinking too much. It was totally entertaining to watch. 

Service: All the waitresses were super relaxed and still pretty attentive. One of them just took a seat next to a gentleman in my party and watched the hockey game for a few minutes. Just a really chill vibe overall from everyone here. I could see myself being a patron if their food tasted better.",UTU-dD6WUyD_j8myX_9yFA,13,10,3,_Zv2xSjUvoigsBbmi5XwCQ

This place was amazing. I don't think I have ever been to anything like it before. I group of about 20 of us went to Vegas over the weekend. We were looking for a place to eat that would accommodate of all us at a reasonable price. One of my friends had been to the real Hofbrauhaus in Germany and thought it would be a a good place to go. 

It was a huge dinning hall. Live music, that played all sorts of German music along with 70's and 80's cover songs. Random but so cool. Every few minutes they yelled, 

""Ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy,"" 
While raising the Stein and toasting to the evening. 

Of coarse having German heritage and my last name being Kriege, I felt at home in this place. I loved everything about it. The atmosphere is one in a million. The food was great and authentic German food. They have 3 different house beers to choose from. Tried all of them but the Hefe is still my favorite. 

OK, I didn't want to spoil it but the best part was there is a Jager girl who walks around with shots. But the catch is you have to get spanked by her wooden paddle after you take your shot. And she's a feisty one.

My relatives used to make familiar Austrian dishes so it sounded like a good place to try.
Since I had never been there before I asked about the menu.  Although the server Erika was superficially friendly she did not answer my questions about portion size (I wanted grossen) and did not suggest anything or care that much. The lunch menu (with better prices) are only M-F which also kind of rubbed me wrong.
The atmosphere and decor is nice although Sunday afternoon was very tame.  The prices are all high -- for what you get.  For a $14 plate, I basically had three small frankfurters and some potato salad.  It had good flavor and all but was really light.  These were the same frankfurters you find at any German deli .  The drinking water served was good and almost tasted like mineral water but maybe since I was parched it could have been simple tap water.  Since things kicked off on the wrong foot I opted out of anything else to drink (overpriced) although the beer looked good.
My friends had young kids and there was a piece of hair in the macaroni & cheese.  Also, I tasted the fries they had and it was almost identical to McDonald's and might have been for all I knew.  Also, upon leaving they noticed that there were a basket of crayon packs for the kids (to keep them busy) that they never got nor was suggested.
The place is clean, seats are wooden and not comfortable really, and there was a bathroom attendant too.  I don't really care for bathroom valets or attendants anyway so that was a minus as well.
They did not push the gift shop but they asked if I wanted a picture taken and I told the woman that I had my own camera -- no thank you.
Service was not really fast but not extremely long either.

Okay, by no means am I a German food expert.  My knowledge on German cuisine consists of my neighbor's oma's cooking from my childhood.  Oma made some delicious food and it was the only non-Chinese food I got growing up.  I love Oma.

Mike W. had seen this place in those airplane magazines and had been wanting to try out this place for years now.  Boasting about being the only beer hall in Las Vegas, I can see the allure.  We shared the 310: NÜRNBERGER ROSTBRATWÜRST, the 305/6: WEISSWÜRSTE, and washed it down with a 17oz. Oktoberfest.  

Guten Appetite!

310: NÜRNBERGER ROSTBRATWÜRST - Three pork sausages with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  It can't get any simpler than this.  This was listed as one of their Hofbräuhaus signature items and I enjoyed it!  I normally only eat sauerkraut on my bratwurst only and having it on top of the potatoes made it so much more flavorful.  I cleaned the plate.  The pork sausages were on the small and thin sized though so I was hungry like an hour later.

305/6: WEISSWÜRSTE - Two of Munich's famous white sausages (veal and pork) grilled with a freshly baked pretzel, served with sweet mustard imported from Munich.  Now these brats were legit.  Thick and juicy and full of flavor!  I got to admit that I didn't care much for the pretzel.  It was hard and crunchy.  I was expecting a soft pretzel considering it's suppose to be freshly baked.  The mustard was good though.  I slapped some onto the sausages and it was great.  This was also listed as one of their Hofbräuhaus signature items.

As for the Oktoberfest?  It was some good brew.  What else can I say?  

Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas is a giant mammoth of a beer hall where they even have an indoor garden-esque beer garden set up with fairy lights for your pleasure.  Ladies are clad in dirndl and the men in lederhosen.  Buy your own dirndl for $100 in the giftshop!  The ceiling is so tall, you can't help but to look upwards throughout your meal.  This is like Hogwart's Great Hall for the beer lovers. Food is good but I did walk away hungry.

Some people paid and left. Than my husbands parents got their bill for $200 bucks when they only ordered 2 pretzels and a meal. They were trying to bill them for peoples food that already left.

Bartender FAIL.
Entertainment - eh.

The only reason I came here was because our friend coordinated our group of 25 and this venue accommodates larger parties because of their bench style seating. However, the food is mediocre and overpriced, the service was just okay, and the sound system was poorly monitored and difficult to hear what the emcee was saying during their random contests. 

First I arrived early hoping to catch a hockey game at the bar. I called ahead and a host said there were two screens and it looked like one was showing hockey. Joe the bartender was thoroughly inattentive, slow at pouring (hampered by bottle regulators), and indifferent to my needs. He never said hello when I sat down, never offered a menu or drink list. They only have 3 types of beers, and you can only get certain beers in certain sizes. After 10-15 minutes of waiting, Joe tried searching for the game but it was very clear that he had little experience with a remote control or his bar's service.  Plus having only one bartender at 7pm on a Saturday night didn't help him either. They use Dish service and couldn't find the game. Bar FAIL.

They sat us in the main hall near the band and the band was okay. But why had a drum set on stage if you're not going to have a drummer? Band FAIL. I could barely understand the emcee when he spoke because of either the acoustics of the room or the mic or where we were seated but it just made for a noisy atmosphere.

They've got a gal that walks around selling shots of Jager and paddle whacks on the ass. Having never been in a fraternity, I can't see how either of those can be pleasurable in any way. Plus, this lady was pissed about something someone said or did because she was putting out a really angry vibe to a couple of other guests not at our party. 

I don't eat pork so my menu selections were limited. I went for the chicken with mushrooms. Good mushroom sauce, but the chicken was horribly overcooked and tough. Then it was topped with French's onions and came with their German pasta side dish. This was NOT worth $19. Food FAIL.

They don't fail to deliver on the traditional German experience - loud obnoxious atomsphere with music, park bench seating, almost exclusively meat-focused menu, and only German beers on tap.

We got there as soon as they opened (11am), so we were able to be seated right away. Our server greeted us promptly and took our drink order. She was very nice and took care of us in a timely manner. 

When ordering beer, you have the option of a liter or half liter. On tap year round are the original Hofbrau, Dunkel, and Hefe Weizen. The seasonal beers are the Oktoberfest, Maibock, and Hefe Weizen Dunkel. I had a half liter of the Original. It was refeshing, as always. 

The food here is definitely authentic German cuisine. And is it delicious! For my meal, I had the Jaeger Schnitzel, which is one of my absolute favorite German dishes. It is a large pork cutlet that is topped with an amazing mushroom sauce, bacon and onions. It is served with a side of spatzle and cranberries. I was not disappointed. The schnitzel was slathered in the mushroom sauce, which is how I like it. My husband had the Riesen Fleischpflanzerl, which is a giant burger made with both beef and pork (Bavarian style). It is served on a kaiser roll with traditional garnish. Cheese can be added. I was able to sample some of the burger, and it was amazing! It reminded me of my mother's meatloaf, to a degree.

Most experiences here have been mediocre at best, but everyone knows that you come here for the ambiance and service, not the lukewarm, stale food or terrible beer. Bad food and beer aside, this time the service was terrible! It started in the parking lot. They have a ""complimentary valet"" that starts in the evening. The day I went, the valet started early because they were having some event. Had I known, I would've parked at UNLV down the street. Instead, I pulled in unknowingly and got stuck at the ""complimentary"" valet. I told the valet attendant that I did not have cash with me and asked if there was an area set aside for patrons who couldn't use valet. He very rudely said I could park somewhere else or walk to an ATM. I then politely asked to leave the parking lot to go park somewhere else (since they were blocking the route to the only exit with cones). He very rudely replied with, ""I guess this is complimentary but you really should visit an ATM before you leave.""  Luckily I was able to borrow a few dollars from a friend, but I was horrified with the scam they have going on in their parking lot. I disagree with the valet for many reasons, yes, the parking lot is small but this in no way necessitates a valet. Further, it creates a long wait time to leave. I was one of two people waiting for the car to be pulled around. We both waited 10 minutes. I would've rather walked to my car (it would've been faster). 

It should also be noted that the server was not attentive but it was a busy night. I was only able to order 1 beer because he never returned to my table. While I would've liked another beer- I am happy that I didn't waste another $9.00 on crappy beer. My sausage was lukewarm and kind of gross but the potato salad was good.

The beers aren't priced the same as Germany - 1/2 liter was $7.50, a full liter was $13 if I remember correctly.  But go for the full liter - trust me, you can finish it all.

We avoided the shots which came with a complimentary whack of the shot paddle (think of frat house hazing, it's pretty much the same thing).

A bunch of cute German guys were enjoying some beers and brats in their lederhosen, and eventually, they were subjected to shots and spankings (thanks to one of their friends). Maybe a little too entertaining, but it was a fun time. A three-piece band played Bavarian standards and many of the patrons sang along/danced. A very fun time.

As for the food, the portions are generous and the flavors are savory and delicious. I had one of my favorites, currywurst. The pretzels are really soft and chewy--perfect with a beer.

The main detractor for this place would have to be the prices for the beer which can get pricey if you have a high tolerance or are just extremely thirsty.  I haven't eaten at this particular branch of the Hofbrau but I'm sure the food is tasty and includes an array of German favorites including bratwurst and pretzels.  They have three signature beers which are served on tap-Original, which is a golden lager, Dunkel, which is a dark hoppy beer and a Hefeweizen.  I have had the original and dunkel time and time again, and they never fail to amaze me.

If you enjoy your beer and like a good old fashioned merry German atmosphere then this is definitely a must for your next Vegas trip.
