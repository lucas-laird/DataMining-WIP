The staff was very friendly which I love. I ordered the Tour of Italy with the lasagna, cheese ravioli and fettuccine alfredo. My daughter wanted the fettuccine alfredo so that was going to be hers. I also ordered a salad. My husband ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and a soup. His soup was warm, not hot. When the salad came I was very surprised that it was soggy and ice cold. Like it was left in the freezer too long. After a few bites I just couldn't eat it anymore. Our first batch of breadsticks were very hard but our second batch were a lot softer than the first. So our food comes and my cheese ravioli has great flavor but wasn't hot. My lasagna was also pretty good but not hot. I tasted the fettuccine alfredo, which was my daughters and it had the taste of sour milk. Overall, when we visit Las Vegas again in the future we will for sure not be coming here. Olive Garden is my favorite restaurant but not this one.",JspXAutMwg--AyO3ptZHUA,0,0,2,wDnG0nJdIAi-bGLM36dkCQ
166299,2014-12-28,1,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,Visited this location for a work meeting. Ill start off by saying the food was excellent. We did have a couple minor problems beginning with my boss feeling like the Alfredo dipping sauce for the breadsticks that's like 5 bucks a bowl was under filled. So the waitress called over the manager. We were all confused as to why dipping sauce was such a big deal. Now we did have to deal with the manager a few more times and I will say he was uppity about the dipping sauce. I thought he was going to turn out to be rude but after one of the steaks was overcooked we got treated like VIP's and it ended with a round of taste testing pastry's which made my boss very happy. Just dont mess with the dipping sauce portion.,iK_w7Td8RFB4p_IGQOCY7Q,1,0,4,sOIMVaoue9udf8l2KbYIPQ

Restaurant is clean and in fairly good condition. We had a booth close to the kitchen. Table and seats were clean.

Our waiter came to greet us and took our drink orders.  We both had the Alfredo specials.  Food came out quickly. 

The gnocchi and chicken soup was okay. I'm not sure if I'd order it again though. Maybe try the minestrone if we go back. 

My bf had the garlic chicken Alfredo. He said it was good. I tasted the sauce and it was better than my entree.

I had the chicken and broccoli Alfredo. There was hardly any sauce on it.  Chicken was okay but a little dry. Broccoli was cooked well.  I think if it had more sauce it would have been better. 

For dessert we had the chocolate option. That was good. A  bit rich. But yummy.

This location is right down Flamingo, catch a cab from the Strip and you will get there in about 5-10 minutes.  

The food was really good.  I had the Grilled Shrimp Caprese on angel hair pasta, but started with the Spinach-Artichoke dip (WAY better than CPK), Chicken & Gnocchi soup (fantastic).  The bread sticks were fresh out of the oven, perfectly warm and buttery.  I had bites of my BF's salad and it was OK.

Service was awesome.  The waitress was really friendly, she didn't pressure us when we needed more time, was very attentive and made sure our glass was always filled.  She came by often to check up on our meal, and everything came in a timely manner.  I can tell that they have happy workers there because in the background a lot of the waitresses were really enjoying themselves - everyone seemed really friendly.

We don't come to this location often but it's closer to our new house so we thought we'd give it a try... To start it off, we walked in and the hostess asked us how many in the party and they told us it would be a little bit of a wait so we said okay thats fine. She didn't take anyone's name to be put on the wait list. Which is wrong, I am a hostess my self and they were VERY unprofessional. Then a party of 6 or more walked in and got on the wait list and they got seated before us. So we were a little irritated about that. Then when our table was ready the hostess took us to our table and my mother said that it was a bit tight and with an attitude the hostess said ""ya it will be but we can fit 6 plus a high chair here.. It's all we have!"" so we sat down and ordered our drinks and food.. We got the endless pasta, soup, and salad .. Which was delicious. My mother odered fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, in fact we all did. And the chicken was nasty. It tasted like canned chicken, our server did tell us it was different than the usual grilled chicken.. It looked and tasted like tuna. Ew. Then my mother ordered a refill on her pasta. This lady Amanda brought out a refill, within seconds of ordering it, to my mom and it was angel hair Alfredo and she didn't order that so my mom said ""oh I didn't ordered that"" and Amanda said "" it's chicken Alfredo, it's the same thing! It's just angel hair pasta!"" and my mom said ""okay, but I didn't order that!"" and Amanda just rolled her eyes at my mom and walked away!!! That is NOT okay... The service was terrible! We will NEVER be going back to that location. Ever again. Our server got the manager for us and she acted like she didn't really care and she offered my mom a gift card and my mom said she didn't want it because we will not be coming back ... She kept asking if we wanted the gift card over and over .. She wasn't getting it that we didn't want the gift card... She only offered us a gift card, she didn't offer to comp anything for us. She bugged us enough to where we just said yes to the gift card.... Our server was great. He did nothing wrong but everyone else was terrible..

However, I guess the world wanted me to hold out on writing a review for it until this very night. I kept telling myself to write the review after each time, but ended up writing about something else. 

BUT, now I can write a review for this location of the famous Olive Garden chain everyone knows so much about, at least I am assuming. 

This was the first time I went with a 10 grouper. Usually its the casual date where the guy just loves Olive Garden that much or family and friend outings. However, this time I was with an organization who have end of the year dinners. (Year, meaning, school year, UNLV). 

In the past I have had good service. I never had issues, everything is always good. At least everything I choose...

Well this time, they had two people from the wait staff(gender neutral is happening) and they both were just really rushed for some reason. The gentlemen on my side of the table was nice and suggested all these things, but would not let me get my word for the longest time. He just kept going like the energizer bunny. That was just my drink order! Which I had some pomegranate drink which was fantastic, but then came the meal and at first I did not know what I want when he got to me, then I decided, however I took too long apparently because he skipped me... thank buddy. Now I have to wait for you to go all the way around because you could not wait five more seconds more me to find what it is I really wanted. 

Back to me, OK cool, so I ordered and then he went to grab the menus and caught his arm on my friends drink across the way. You expect the usual spillage of ice and drink all over the table sometimes your lap... but no. Not this time. What you do not expect is to be hit directly in the forehead with an ice cube... (ya you ponder how that happened because I have no clue). I have some type of beverage on my arm, little on the pants, but I am still astonished about the ice cube that hit my head. New restaurant experience to add to the books? I think yes. 

He did not even apologize to me, only to the person whose drink it belonged to. He just kept on rushing.... It may be a Friday night, but still. 


Other than that, my experiences have been good. Great food, great drinks, wine, sangria's, the works. Did not like their restrooms, they are shaped so awkwardly...but that is just me.

V = Seafood Alfredo (Sautéed shrimp and scallops tossed with creamy fettuccine alfredo.) Served with her plate, she had a Strawberry-Mango Limonata.

A = (kid) Italian Cheese Pizza topped off with mushrooms. Served with his pizza, he had a few glasses of rasberry lemonade.

M = (my son) = (Grilled Chicken with Pasta) - Grilled chicken breast with sides of steamed broccoli and spaghetti with tomato sauce. Served with his meal, he had a glass of sprite and a glass of rasberry lemonade.

Me = Capellini di Mare. (Shrimp, clams and mussels sautéed in white wine, garlic and a zesty marinara sauce. Served over capellini and topped with fresh basil.) Suggested wine: Sutter Home White Zinfandel.... Instead I had a sprite and strawberry margarita with salt around the rim.

The Alfredo sauce was thin and soupy not the usual rich and creamy style that I'm used to. I know I should have sent it back and requested a make over but didn't want to disrupt everyone else's dinner at the table.

I went in here with my Mother and it was busy as they told us that we could wait 25 minutes for a table or we could sit in the bar area right away, so we decided to sit in the bar area as we were hungry.  When we sat, It was freezing and the air conditioner was blowing in our faces.  The hostess said she would have it turned off but after ten minutes it was still blowing at us very strong so we asked to have it to go.  we ordered the mixed grill and chicken alfredo fettucini, both with chicken and gnocci soup.  It took about 25 mins and we left. when we got home we started with the soup which was and looked disgusting.  I had never ever had a complain about olive garden until i came to this location which is very close to where I live.  The soup seemed like it was extremely watered down.  It is supposed to be a white creamy soup but instead it was very transperant and u could tell it was just watered down.  it was soo nasty.  the bread sticks were fine. When i got to my chicken alfredo, it was not blackened like it always is and states on the menu! I was so mad.  It was breaded chicken. like for chicken parmesan which I do not like at all.  

I've been to olive garden a hundred times but this experience made not want to go back for a long time.  I hate the smell of it now and after tasting their food today I am just nauseous.  I ended up giving the entire meal to my dog, which was a shame.  I am giving it two stars because the hostess who was very pretty, (tall, brunette. long hair) gave excellent customer service.

My mom and I have gone to this Olive Garden for years. Everytime I go visit her in Vegas, this is one of the places we have lunch or dinner. 

I think the people that work at this location are extremely friendly, helpful. educated on the menu, give prompt service and are always making sure you leave completely stuffed. 

I think the food is always good.. if you enjoy Italian food. My favorite items are: Zuppa Toscana (soup), Tour of Italy: Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo and the Seafood Portofino. 

One wonderful experience, that springs to mind is... I was there with my mom and she was cold so she ordered some warm water. For the remainder of the meal, the waitress kept bringing her fresh hot cups of water. Whenever my mom's cup got low, a new hot cup of water would appear. We never had to ask for the great service. 

Another time, our waitress saw that my mom was sad and so at the end of the meal, she wrote my mom a ""thank you"" note. She thanked her for coming to her Olive Garden. My mom started to cry because of the nice gesture. She was having a bad day and when she told the waitress, the waitress gave my mom a hug and some extra chocolates.

1272299,2017-02-12,2,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,"The NEVER-ENDING pasta bowl SCAM! 

Two weeks after getting out of the hospital, my husband took me to dinner at Olive Garden. We each ordered a never-ending pasta bowl. Mine was chicken fettuccine. My husband ordered lasagna. However, the drama was never-ending, not the lasagna. 

Our waitress was slow and not very good. But, that wasn't the main problem. My husband's a hard working man. He wanted a second piece of lasagna. I no brainer, right? Not so fast. The waitress brought out the second helping of ""lasagna"" in a small bowl. 

The second serving of ""lasagna"" was not a nice square piece. Rather, it was a bowl of goulash leftovers. My husband and I explained to the waitress this was unacceptable. My husband wanted a second piece of square lasagna, like the first. 

The waitress took the goulash back. She returned with a second small bowl of goulash leftovers. My husband I both compared it to a dog dish. Then, the man at the table behind my husband turned around and put his hand on my husband saying, ""calm down, buddy."" My husband told him, ""Don't put your hands on me."" I said, ""let's go."" 

We attempted to head to the front of the restaurant to pay the bill away from this confrontational patron. The manager, Shawna, blocked our path. She said, ""you have to pay your bill."" We both clearly stated, ""we will pay our bill."" We wanted to move to an un-confrontational area to do so. 

However, rather than taking us to the front or the bar, anywhere away from the confrontational patron, Shawna kept us blocked in the middle of the dining area entry. This was a very unprofessional handling of a situation which could have been resolved with a square piece of lasagna. 

Shawna and Francisco, both managers, insist the goulash serving is part of a business model. 

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, on Olive Garden!

1316710,2013-03-07,0,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,"Yum yum this place is so good! I've been here so many time and I loves everything I've ever gotten. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. 
First of all their soups are soooo delicious!! I wish I had a giant tub of them. 
Everyone is crazy about the breadsticks but I'm not a huge fan. They are good but not that great. I also never eat them because I don't want it to fill me up. I want to eat my food! 
Dishes I have tried: 
Chicken and shrimp carbonara- my favorite plate of them all! It's sooooo good. Plus I love when they have chicken AND shrimp. I love it with Tabasco. Is is also my dads favorite plate and the waiters always say how good it is and some have said it was their personal favorite. 
Lasagna fritta- an appetizer and the only one ive had. It was very yummy. Not a top favorite but it was good. 
Chicken & Gnocchi- yum yum!! This Is the super delicious creamy soup. It's so absolutely delicious. 
Zuppa Toscana- my favorite soup and also most people's favorite. It's creamy with spicy sausage. This is heavenly I'd eat this every day if I could. 
Minestrone- this soup Is easily the worst thing I've had in the entire menu. It's not terrible but it's eh. 
Salad- their salad is pretty good but I'm not sure why anyone would be the salad over the heavenly soups. 
Spaghetti with Meat Sauce- I didn't order this for myself but I got it. It's good. Actually very good but idk why you would get this when there are so many better dishes. It's just plain spaghetti and sauce you could make at home. 
Fettuccine Alfredo- their Alfredo sauce is soooo good. But like the one above this is pretty plain and you could easily make this at home. 
Chicken Parmigiana- yum yum! This is super good. Not on my top favorite but it is good. 
Tour of Italy- this is what my mom always gets. Really good. You get 3 different things in one plate. 
Stuffed Chicken Marsala- on my top 5. I'm drooling thinking about it. It's so delicious. The thing i don't like is that it comes with mashed potatoes. I would like it a lot more if it came with pasta. 
Crispy Parmesan Shrimp- this is yummy. Very very yummy but I kinda feel like its an appetizer more than a dinner dish. 
Sea food Alfredo- yum!! I want some right now. It's super delicious! I never really order it since its easy to make at home but it's really good. 
Tour di Mare- like the tour of Italy but in sea food. I loved it. A lot. But I almost ate the entire thing and I don't eat a lot. When I eat tour of Italy I leave almost half the plate. It's not much but it really is good. 
Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo- it was super good but it didn't have much meat. I finished the meat super quick. 
It still one of my favorite places an i would like to try everything on the menu!",HLxTwrrNrEfLNNsw2liSuA,1,0,4,O30-PXfpXQ-eb0x3XNlg5A

We went in with a large group of over a dozen people around 9:00 pm and at 10:00 pm a couple of our guests stepped out and the staff refused to let them back in. We explained that we had been coming there for many years and that our guests did not speak English and did not understand their policy. 

Martin E., the manager, refused to allow them back in - effectively forcing our whole group out before finishing our meals and ordering dessert.   The only thing he repeated was that it was a corporate policy that he had to enforce. Purely ridiculous. 

Olive Garden (corporate) should  invest in teaching its managers common sense. (The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the waiters were very apologetic about the whole thing).

The only reason they received a two star rating is because our waiter Tyler P. was absolutely fantastic. Let me start by saying they were ridiculously busy, however we couldn't have been sitting at the table longer than ten extra minutes when they kept coming by and asking if we needed anything else, as if to rush us out. Finally, we took the hint and went to sit outside on their benches. Can you believe at least four different servers went outside to ask us if we were waiting for a cab or needed anything else (our server included)? So I asked if we were not allowed to sit there and Tyler said he didn't care what we did because he was off the clock, not rudely though. So we continued to sit there and talk, when a heavier set white woman walked outside and asked us if we needed anything else inside because she was about to lock up. We said no, then about ten minutes later my friend asked if she could go inside because she just realized she lost her key and this woman wouldn't even open the door to let her in to look. She spoke to us through the door as if we were criminals. The staff was rude, unprofessional and happy to take our money but annoyed that we sat OUTSIDE on the benches to talk. I was visiting from out of town and had not seen my friends in almost six months and won't see them again for another year or so. They ruined my experience and when I come back into town I'll be sure to let everyone know this particular location isn't worth the time of day.

UPDATE: I called the manager the next day to tell him about my experience with his less than professional staff, and his exact words? ""That Sucks"".  He seemed like he didn't care so I took the gift card he offered with all my money back since I can use it at any location.  Maybe losing business will help them care more.

I'm not a snob, but Vegas has so many amazing Italian restaurants that my professors recommended. Olive Garden just wasn't on my list.

So it's been ten years since I went to an Olive Garden. A few months ago my kind mother gave me an Olive Garden giftcard. My husband and I put off going there until yesterday, when I heard about a buy an entree and get one to take home deal. So off we went.

First of all, we were shocked by the portions. We were pretty much satiated on a few breadsticks and the soup. Then the enormous portions came around. The food itself was decent, and they had a few vegetarian options. I had the cheese ziti, and my husband had the seafood brodetto. 

The service wasn't bad, although they were busy so it was a bit of a wait for seeing our waitress. She did an admirable job keeping our glasses and breadstick basket full.

So if you're looking for large quantities of food that's predictable in quality, go here. If you are craving local Italian food check out String's or Nora's.",Hmjo4sLUIHpuBs5aenOT7w,0,0,3,QEl7Kr3VIijiB04XjpgUUA

My Coca Cola was replaced before my straw found the bottom half inch of beverage. My endless salad bowl was never empty. We had more bread sticks than we could shake a stick at. 

At other Olive Gardens in Cali, the wait time for a beverage refill, more bread or a salad can be horrible. That lag can make the difference in how relaxing and enjoyable your meal is going to be.

She stopped by our table on her own maybe 3 times. To take our order, serve our food, and bring the check. It wasn't even busy. Then the food was awful. None of us were satisfied. They also have these new machines where you can place your own order and that's how you pay your check right at the table. That is so low class and with that really why have a waiter or waitress? You can do everything yourself other than bring out the food. To top is off while we paid the check at the table the waitress hovered over us and it was uncomfortable leaving a tip with her watching. You can't ask for steakhouse prices with McDonald's service. We will never be going back to Olive Garden again. I have celiacs disease and the gluten free menu was a joke.

I have ordered multiple salads with my pasta and bit the bullet 8$ a salad the cake is definitely accessible when dinning in.

When we walked in, we saw a woman with black glasses an white ear plugs talking with a woman with long dreadlocks. We walked up to the counter, no greeting or anything, just carried in talking.

Was told to wait 10 minutes but given no menus, the restaurant wasn't that busy as it was lunch hour. We actually got seated in 5 though, that's good!

Sever asked us if we're ready, we ordered drinks, lunch specials and an appetiser sampler. He came back with drinks but asked for our food order again.

The food arrived, the soup was a small portion, but that was good, so you can try more! The salad looked good too. However, both times we visited, the service on the lunch special is very very slow. If you ask for the waiter for a soup, they seem really annoyed and bothered by it. Small portions are good, but of they don't want to bring more, then it defeats the point. We are not a large group, we wanted to try 2-3 each. The last time, and what prompted this review, was that the server asked if this is all we want in a rude tone and we asked for his assistance 3 times in 20 minutes when wanting re-fills and soup.

The first time we visited, they forgot the breadsticks twice and it took 25 minutes to get them. I don't believe the breadsticks are fresh, they are baked from pre-frozen dough and have a strange plain taste about them. 

Anyway, to conclude... Service 1/10, salad 7/10, soup 7/10, breadsticks 2/10, sampler 7/10. A restaurant is nothing without good service and has no legs to stand on.

The restaurant was surprisingly uncrowded so we had a seat right away. The waiter came up after a few minutes and asked us for our drink order. He offered us an option to purchase wine, and when we both asked for water, his completely friendly demeanor vanished...as did he! He came back with our water and breadsticks, took our food order, and we only saw him one time again before he brought the check.

Another waitress brough the soup and salad. The soup, Minestrone, was not too great...Campbell's would have been better. The salad was excellent as usual, though. We ran out of breadsticks pretty quick as we waited for our entrees, which was a LONG wait. We managed to catch our waiter one time and asked for more breadsticks...and he brought us a basket containing TWO breadsticks and dissapeared again.

The waitress brought out Chicken Parmesan for me, and Spaghetti with Meat Sauce for dad. My Chicken Parmesan was pretty terrible...and came with a side of approximately 20 rigatoni noodles. There were so few it was possible to easily count them! Dad said the Spaghetti was nothing to write home about either.

The waiter re-appeared with our check sometime after the meal, and he was suddenly friendly with us again. It really didn't help his cause, he still got a crappy tip for crappy service. 

All in all, I believe that taking a trip to any number of Las Vegas' local-bred Italian restaurants is a better investment if you're looking for some good Italian food. If you're hankering THAT much to go to a chain restaurant, Carrabba's and even Fazoli's can provide you with better fare than this place.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,3,0,1,4tUhd26xojkZOrM2NEEs9w

This location is on Flamingo right off of Maryland which is close by my place. The outside of the building looks older, like the inside would look old as well, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was updated on the inside. 

Pros:
1. I was seated immediately.
2. My waitress was super friendly and took my order quickly. She came over multiple times to check up on me and made sure everything was good. She gave me suggestions of items to try also. She treated me very well.
3. Was informed of all the specials that were going on at the time.
4. Food came out super fast and was hot.
5. Manager came by to make sure everything was to my liking.
6. Unlimited Salad!! Their dressing is amazing!
7. Not really a bread person, but the bread was delish and hot when it came out. Also tasted fresh and not reheated. 

Con:
1. I saw a waiter drop some silverware and then put it on a table! Yuck!!

My favorite times to come to Olive Garden are during the time they have the Unlimited Pasta Bowls and Buy one take one home specials.

I'll admit that we were a large group and the manager came out to apologize before we complained that there was a backlog in the kitchen and that was the reason it took so long. But there was also an issue with the level of heat on our dishes. They weren't hot and out waiter assured us that the food came out hot.

The Minestrone (other than the heat factors) just didn't taste right and didn't sit well with me and by the time we got our mains I was just thinking to myself ""why?"".

We also got conflicting responses to what we would and wouldn't be charged if we made substitutions or additions to our meal which was upsetting.

After going to the Vegas one, I decided to give Olive Garden 4 stars. Majority of the servers there seemed a bit on the older side. Ours seemed like she was maybe early 60's? She was nice, but a bit slow. It took a while to get our drinks, and take our order. So it seemed like FOREVER to get our food. My bf got the braised shortribs. I can honestly say, I've never once had a bad braised shortribs. But this one was pretty terrible. When we were ordering, our server said it was a ""good choice"" because they were going to take it off the menu. But it tasted awful... no wonder they were taking it off the menu! I cant quite put my finger on it but it had a very odd taste.

Our waitress was busy with several other large parties of people so we ended up having to wait around before finally another lady (I think the manager?) came around and took our drink and food order. Our waitress finally did come around to our table to bring us our salad and bread, but other than that she didn't come back around. 

I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my girl got the 5 cheese Ziti al Forno. Both of us got the salad with our meal as well. We didn't have to wait long before our food came out, but I do have to say that we were disappointed with the portion that we got, especially since the price on their entrees keep on going up. My fettuccine cost $14.99 and the Ziti cost $15.99. Usually, we get so much that we have to take to-go boxes home, but this time we had no problem eating our dinner. My girl's ziti was in a dish that was maybe 1/2"" deep and they only gave her enough to cover the bottom of the dish. Mind you, the noodles were single stacked and they gave her what seemed like just 1/4th of a cup of sauce!! I think we may have been able to ask for more sauce but didn't want to have to pay extra for that.

Pasta to me is just not ranked up as one top food choices.  Being an avid Yelper, I'm always willing to try new things and spend money to get the opportunity to continue one of my favorite hobbies.  With that being said, I decided to meet a few great friends for dinner one night at the big OG. Apparently they LOVE OG, but I didn't see eye to eye with that view, however, I was willing to go and keep an open mind.

What I do appreciate about all OGs is the home feel you get when you walk in the restaurant.  It's super cozy and is filled with warm colors.  What I don't like are the wheels on the chairs.  What is up with that?!  Omg, that NEEDS to go.  It's convenient, true, but so cheap to me (sorry OG).  Our server was nice and entertaining, talking to us in an Italian accent at times, but took a long time to get his attention when we wanted to order our meals and also when we needed a refill on our drinks.  

For dinner, I got that stuffed chicken Marsala for $17.50, obviously because there wasn't any pasta.  This dish contains oven-roasted chicken breasts stuffed with Italian cheeses and sun-dried tomatoes, topped with mushrooms and a creamy marsala sauce. Served with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes.  The great thing about the OG is that they shave extra cheese on your command.  The meal also includes unlimited soup or salad.  I chose the seasonal soup, but couldn't tell you what it was.  It was alright, definitely better with the cheese they shave.  The chicken breast was nicely cooked but the stuffing wasn't really a knockout for me.  The cheeses were lukewarm so it was more of a chunky than oozing and I didn't taste the tomatoes as much.  Although I'm not a big fan of mashed potatoes, I did like these ones.  Lastly, the Marsala sauce wasn't prominent so some bites seemed dryer than others (if that makes sense).  

All in all, I thought it was just ok.  Seems to be consistent with every visit I have at the OG.  I think it's a good venue for great company (like the ones I had that night).  I wouldn't necessarily bring a date here but I would revisit the OG if my friends were up for it.  Definitely should try it for yourself, maybe the experience might be better!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,0,0,3,RdU7Cp2K-TyrQAggUkrxkg

It was crowded with a long wait so perhaps the kitchen was overwhelmed",MoKQthJiJxDSqykltxZCDg,0,0,2,qiQF_To5HEe6ZVkpe3KJrQ

Everything was exactly how it should be. The salad was fresh and crunchy and the breadsticks were hot. I had the peccatore pasta and my husband had the vegetable lasagna.  Our waiter was always one step ahead of us in anticipating our needs.  A different waiter came by and congratulated my husband and I for our new baby.  And a manager came by to check on us.  I don't know what was going on over there last night but everything was on point! Way to go, Olive Garden.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,0,0,5,vRRYpFci_7K14Qfm-y157A
5784499,2018-03-10,0,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,"I used to really regard ""Olive Garden"" as a more ""upscale"" place to eat but with more and more places exceeding that ""fancy"" style, I believe they've become a little more of a regular night out or lunch spot. 
On this visit, I was very happy with food and the service. Ingred was an amazing server. She was very attentive and sweet. The food had lots of flavor and met all our expectations. 
The host stand and the bartender, however continue to be something less than desirable. They look like they hate their jobs, seem always confused, and just take forever. 
Other than that, this is still a great spot to dine!",_jTNDvLNoUJFJrld7MYBmQ,0,0,4,ChqLB-x52AL7wyEqQz3cfA
5786602,2017-03-03,0,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,"The husband and I stopped in for an early dinner one day. We order some food, got some drinks... everything was fine at first. Then I decided to pay for our meal on the tablet before getting boxes and refills just to make our exit quicker as we had a movie to go to directly after dinner. HUGE MISTAKE. Our waiter literally refilled drinks, and answered menus questions to the 2 tables behind us, and the one in front of us... and wouldn't even acknowledge us once our food was at the table. Not once were we even asked ""How's the food?"" Mind you this is an early dinner... he had a total of 4 tables.. not during dinner rush. Yet at one point we didn't even see him for over 20 mins. We ended up having to walk out thirsty as hell, and leaving more than half our food to rot. No refills, no boxes. I was hoping to talk to a manager and there was absolutely no one at the front at all. So needing to catch the movie we left and I decided to call to get in touch with one.

I was put on the phone with the manager named Shawna. After describing my experience she told me she could see that our full plates and empty cups were still at the table with no waiter to be seen. She assured me this was not up to their standards, asked for my address so she could send me a gift card, and told me to personally ask for her next time I came in so she can make sure we get excellent service.

Well... that's NOT what happened at all. In fact we never received a gift card and it's been months. I went in randomly one night to talk to the manager about it and hope she was diligent enough to write down people who should be comped or sent gift cards. She claimed she could not remember me (so they must get a lot of complaints) and basically called me a liar. At this point i said it was absolute BS and she got even more snarky and told me to leave. She was so unbelievably rude and unprofessional. You're a chain restaurant manager, you should be making sure customers are satisfied with their service. You also shouldn't lie about sending gifts cards when you clearly had no intention of doing so. Instead of trying to remedy the situation she just told me to leave in a loud voice! Made it seem like I was somehow trying to scam a free meal out of Olive Garden lol!!!

Obviously we will never be back. I'm really not sad about it, but I did feel the need to make it known that SHAWNA is not manager material. Clearly after reading the other reviews.. she's been an issue for many guests of the restaurant. Hmm?!",kb60_De5hn8Vua-BSnJMxQ,4,0,1,Smfm6It90AXs_o7EJe3H4w
5840742,2017-08-22,0,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,I live in Henderson and was going to the location on sunset. After two terrible visits there we came to this location. What a difference! The customer service here is 5 starts compared to the other ones. Always greeted and welcomed with the door held open on the way in and on the way out. Francisco the GM is such a good person and really knows how to WOW his guests. On both visits we have had a server named sky who is awesome and takes great care of us. I now drive past the closest location to my home just to come to this one.,BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig,0,0,5,qRzVpxUFv_bV9MldVXI3CQ
5849365,2017-01-18,0,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,"Love all of the new Mediterranean offerings. These meals are so tasty, with 600 or less calories each. The Herb-Grilled Salmon topped with garlic butter and served with broccoli was particularly yummy. Yes, I'm advising you to order salmon at Olive Garden! 

Here you can get any pasta dish with gluten-free rotini (yay!). The only sauces that are 100% gluten-free, though, are their marinara or meat sauce. If you can tolerate a bit of gluten (like I can), go for the Shrimp Scampi - so good.

Finish your meal with a cup of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and an Andes mint. Mmmm!

Staff here from the hostess, to servers to manager were super friendly and accommodating. 

If you're looking for an affordable and tasty meal away from the strip, go here.",ZDFjD5kHgSyM-iZUlhPSBw,0,0,5,6x6Z39mUfKF8tg-vX8IFMQ
5851089,2015-12-28,0,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,"Waitress that we were dealing with is very untrained. As she was passing out drinks, she decides to pass a drink across the table and spills the drink over my pants and jacket. She decides to claim there is nothing that she can do to help us out, so I request the manager. He helps very little, and says there is no way to receive a discount, yet at the end for our birthday cake for my grandmother there was a ""discount"" applied. If I wasn't with my family I would have just walked out of this place, seemed like there was an attitude from the staff the moment we walked in. Good thing it's Vegas and it's just a vacation spot. I'll never be back to this Olive Garden along with my family. That's one way to lose some customers fast and easy.

""Long"" was the manager on duty. The waitress mentioned had very short white hair that resembled uncooked Top-Ramen noodles.",Hn2VQnVCuiLYOsJWaRjz9w,0,0,1,PkzWxwI62V8OsQMLDyAoEg

5933996,2015-12-10,0,w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg,"I've been to several Olive Garden locations throughout Cali and two different locations in Vegas. They don't differ much from each other in terms of menu just probably in service. There was a group of 6 of us who dined in during our Vegas vacation and wanted to have dinner prior to us going to the strip. 

The restaurant didn't seemed busy as we've seen empty tables and not much foot traffic while we waited up front. Took a while for us to get a table but when we did we were stuck all the way in the back of the restaurant in the outside extension of the restaurant. We would have preferred the inside dining area as the atmosphere is much more nicer.

What I love about Olive Garden is the unlimited bread sticks and soup they offer as part of every entree. They also offer a wine sample of your choice of white or red. I chose a Rosé ed wine that was really good, considering I'm not much of a red wine drinker. 

Seriously though by the time my entree came, I was already full off of indulging in the awesome bread sticks and 2 bowls of soups. I love that you can try different choices as well. I tried Chicken & Gnocchi and Minestrone, a thick soup vs a soupy soup. I like the Minestrone more than the Gnocchi. But both were tasty and flavorful in their own way.

For my main entree, I chose the Ravioli di Portobello. It was thick and creamy filled with mushrooms topped with cheese and sun dried tomato sauce. It's about $15 for dinner, one of the cheaper dinner menu items. It was so filling that I couldn't finish it as I was already full from the free appetizer items of bread and soup. Overall, I love Olive Garden. You get your money's worth it with decent quality portion meals.",pBQrs5cq3do9o_RS-XS4yA,1,2,4,DVxvWrR8Kw4p1kE_ND1n-Q

Listen, listen. I got the beef tortalini with salad and my friend got the Northern tour of italy with salad. Diane lays on the cheese until we drown because we like it like that. :) And... 2 peach teas. But she just knows when we need something without us having to tell her! Bread sticks, more salad. Coma!!! To top it off, when she brings us our doggy bags, SHE BRINGS US TOGO SALAD! AND TOGO PEACH TEA!!!! I absolutely cant.. I'd jump up and hug her if I could. But I'm full. So instead we just leave her a large tip and waddle back to our lives. Thank you Diane!!",ABG8n-fsKfcdWdJqJkNsQA,1,0,5,XH1_9ihqwnb2aaEfqJcAZQ
