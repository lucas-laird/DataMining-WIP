221509,2016-12-24,0,WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag,"I don't usually leave a review but this place was so horrible, I have to say something. I wish I could give no star. So- maybe I can be ok waiting for a few minutes for the hostess to finish flirting with a European guy at the entrance and finally take us in when the manager saw the situation. But I'm certainly not ok to be ripped off by the waiter, ALEX, to bring us $10 bottled water when we asked for regular tap water. He never brought us the complimentary bread either, lied that the wifi wasn't working when asked for a password, and was certainly too busy to be caught after knowing we weren't ordering the ""specials."" Worst- since he earlier asked us where we were from, he thought that we were unexplored tourists from Asia with no understanding for gratuity?? (But we used to live in NYC over a decade). So by the time we were finished, he FINALLY showed up with the bill lecturing us on the tipping culture, and then directly asked us how much we are paying for the tip, so ""I(he) can take care of it."" WTF??!!!  I told him I'll fill out the gratuity on my own after the credit card was charged for the foods. And he goes, ""Oh"", and just walked away. What a snob!! Stay away from this place seriously. The food wasn't even that great (everything was too salty), and there are tons of great places in Vegas that treat you with respect.",qgK5mVp42RA2Uy2G2OrqZw,0,0,1,IoUkcUK-DDpFluwBwikCKA
230117,2017-02-20,0,WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag,"I don't know if my waiter was from Italy or an actor hamming up a stereotypical assertive Italian waiter. Either way, his performance was the best part of the meal. This alone was worth one star above minimum (remember, yelp is a 4 star rating system. One of those stars can't be removed). My waiter made what was an otherwise bland and disappointing meal entertaining. I think he deserves better food to serve.

I started off with a cocktail. A simple old fashioned. What I received gave the impression that either their bartender or I have no idea what an old fashioned should be. I was thinking sugar, bitters, muddled fruit, bourbon and maybe some vermouth, simple syrup or a splash of water served on ice. What I got was a glass of water with Irish whiskey and a heavy portion of bitters and syrup. It's like they read a description of an old fashioned and ignored the pictures. I was happy to move on to the wine.

The focaccia was genuinely good. Some of the best I've had. But it was disappointing to get more focaccia instead of crostini with my bruschetta. There were 3 pieces of focaccia. One was topped with some sad looking tomato tossed with basil and oil. The other 2, I don't know what to make of it. One had some bland compote that looked like muffaletta and tasted of nothing. The last had beets that were boiled to the point where no flavor was left in them and then boiled again. I think the chef knew their limitation on beets and didn't know what to do after all the boiling, so they added a truffled creme fraiche to compensate.

For a main course, I went with gnocchi in bolognese. Common theme, the gnocchi was over cooked, but that's forgivable. What isn't forgivable was the bolognese. A large number of flavors converging into a single note where nothing is recognizable. A junk yard dumped on a train wreck. Never knowing where the tomato ends and the meat begins. Such a travesty they buried it under a mound of steamed spinach with stems. I thought the spinach might have been added to give a contrast to the one note bolognese. The contrast in color made the plate more attractive but the contrast on the palate made it in-edible. Thankfully, I ordered a high tannin wine to clear my palate.",zms31dVNYpKXZZvkFPtdlw,0,0,2,FfC4Aifed9aVdIgM18bRZg

Then we moved to entrees where we shared a prime New York Steak with a side of eggplant parmigiano and roasted potatoes. Then Marco suggested some good Italian desserts and after dinner cordials.

Unfortunately, neither the service nor the food lived up to expectations.  In fact, this was the worst meal we've had in Las Vegas.  My husband's Manhattan was delivered to the wrong table and sat there for about 10 minutes.  The waiter finally realized his mistake and instead of bringing a fresh one over, he just gave my husband the original.  We saw all this because there were not many customers around, and the other table was adjacent to our.  When my husband complained that the drink was room temperature when it should have been chilled, he claimed the drink was made as expected.  My husband told him it was not cold enough and the waiter took it back.  Instead of making a fresh one, we watched as the bartender poured the original back into the shaker.  A few minutes later, the drink came back.  We asked the waiter if it was a fresh one, and without pause, he claimed it was.  Food was also not up to par.  We ordered tableside pasta with cheese and black pepper, shrimp fettuccini, and seafood risotto.  The pasta with cheese and pepper was ok.  The shrimp fettuccini was nothing to write home about, with its dried out, overcooked shrimp.  The risotto was too salty, and the seafood overcooked.

Tiramisu French toast - AMAZING. One of the best french toasts I've had. The toast is crusted with lady finger cookies and topped with custard and whipped cream. Delicious - recommend sharing with the table as it is very decadent.

Pizza - We had it as a group appetizer, also very good! Stone oven cooked, thin crust and yummy cheese and sauce. 

Calamari - 5/5 standard, solid calamari. Pro tip from the waiter: squeeze the lemon in the sauce so the calamari doesn't get soggy. 

Pasta - we had the seafood spaghetti and carbonara with pancetta- both delicious and the pasta was sooo fresh and yummy as it is house made!

Aperol Spritzer - Refreshing aperol! Nice sub for the usual mimosa or Bellini.

The plate the salmon is served on has a smear of carrot puree which was quite amazing to put on the Salmon, with tuscan kale which almost tasted just like spinach -- great combination.

Service is slow, and they also screwed up a buddies meal who happened to be glutten free and vegan, whereby they cooked his pasta with butter.. They took full responsibility and covered the tab entirely for a table of four. The problem was since service is slow, and because my buddy had an appointment at the ""art of shave"" he was unable to eat. If service wasn't so slow, and they reduced their mistakes; this would of been 5 stars 100 percent.",FGa7KMdT0r6clBQI7M0tZw,0,1,4,eE4Av2ufiYUjD84VBpELGQ

We started with the Burrata salad which was drizzled with truffle oil and infused with truffle essence. I usually love burrata, but this one was a bit milkier than ive had in other restaurants. Once you break the firmer outside it spills out a softer inside. Considering its texture I thought they made it in house, a las it's imported. 

I chose the salmon entree which was really good and cooked perfectly didnt care for the small chunky bell peppers that didnt add much to the dish and seemed like an afterthought. 

Server was pleasant, but ill add at some restaurants you want the server to guide you through the menu or at least tell you about the restaurant. Tell me about your favorites and whats new on the menu. Eating at a restaurant is like shopping at a store: if im walking in for the first time sell me on it. Otherwise, you're just an order taker and the experience isnt exactly memorable.

I HIGHLY recommend the tableside tiramisu. It isn't anything like I've ever had before.

I'm just going to say it... the pasta was probably the best pasta I've ever had. The texture and flavor was incredible. The texture was thick, yet chewy. Pasta typically doesn't have much flavor, but this one was def different than any other I've had. The alfredo sauce was creamy and delicious. The chicken was the only part of the dish where I was like- eh ok. 

The pizza... wow. All kinds of flavors and textures going on in my mouth. It had onions, red bell pepper, zucchini, and mushroom (I believe they were shiitake, but I could be wrong?). 

I really want to come back for another pasta dish before I go home, but hello! I'm in Vegas! There are sooo many other amazing eating options... but this place was so good... we shall see!",x7K_hpF5yBruTRKzDv21sg,5,5,4,cau1lJiCK1ohn1Sw5PAMOg

He was busy, but was always pleasant and answered all our questions. He made us feel very special and at home.  My husband wouldn't stop saying how much he liked Alsonso.

Go or No? Go

Tease:  Inside the Venetian square... 

Why I went:  This fairly new restaurant looked to be a nice place for a mid-day meal

When: 11/22/16

Food:  My wife and I got here in time for their happy hour around 3pm.  My wife enjoyed a tasty Belini and I enjoyed a classic Negroni.  We shared a meat & cheese platter which was delicious and included honeycomb, crackers and grapes.  You got to choose from a variety of items including speck, salumi and all kinds of cheese.  We also split their meatballs...which were amazing.  They were super tender and flavorful.  The marina sauce included was also excellent.  We also shared an octopus appetizer that was really tasty...we had to get some kind of seafood after all!

Service:  Very good.  Our waiter was excellent.  The hostess could have been a little more friendly...but once the waiter came over, all was good!

Hints/Final thoughts:  If you're looking for a light (and they certainly have some not-so-light options too!) meal, this place really delivers some tasty items!",EBveE4oDk6AYWNUEs937mg,1,0,4,NXOU0T7IcZUO6XYVbxpgGw

What ensued was a threatening, racist demand to leave the restaurant, claiming I voted for Trump. Callers have names of Sabrina & George, stating they were the owners of the restaurant, calling from corporate. This went on for at least 20 minutes, with two people of the staff, the management, talking to whomever was on the phone. The lady who handed me the phone verified that the caller asked for a "" black lady with wild hair"". Note: my hair is in a chignon, and I am light skinned. I had to demand for security, which told me I am being watched, for my protection, from different cameras, until I leave the casino.  After all that, I still had to cover my check, plus the $9 Pellegrino bottle.  Needeless to say, my appetite waned to nothing. All this happened on their business phone, without no one ever verifying that it was Not the restaurant demanding I leave because I was Black and with the assumption of voting for Trump.

The pasta was ""homemade"", but I found the tomato sauce mixed in with it lacking of flavor and spices. I am wondering if the real chef called in sick when we were there!?

I also unfortunately spent some time in the bathroom afterwards since I really ended up not feeling intestine-wise very well after the meal.

On the positive side, I really enjoyed the environment (inside the Venetian where it was ""covered"" with a fake sky). It was very casual and relaxing. The service was decent.

I am really, really glad I didn't go with my original seafood thoughts since if they can't get chicken right imagine if I had their seafood. Yikes!",BPL8bDIem9Dfx6JeV8KJLg,0,0,2,fhaV-Ht1bWVSe9mdmMMsOg

Walked by this place while looking for a place to eat in between lunch and dinner time. The menu and location captured our interest.

To our surprise, this place is pretty good! 
The Happy hour menu is definite a good deal for drinks and small plates. We got pizza and prosciutto mozzarella bruschetta for $6 each.
The pizza is very simple with thin crust , cheese and pepperoni but fresh made and tasty. The bruchetta is very tasty with thin slide prosciutto over mozzarella and their freshly made delicious bread topped with olive oil and fresh herbs. It is probably the best bruschetta I have had so far.

We also ordered hamachi crudo and spaghetti with meat balls from the regular menu.
Hamachi crudo, $19: fresh thin slide hamachi served with tomamato sauce, and herbs. It is very fresh and delicious.
Spaghetti with meatballs, $19: good size to share. Simple traditional dishes but tasty.

Although I work at a bar downstairs, this was my first visit to Mercato. I have been in the service industry for 5+ years and even though I think of myself as an easy guest to please, customer service goes a long way. I was lucky enough to belly up to the bar and be served by Andrew. I really hope I'm getting his name right he only said it about  7 times. He's from Chicago. He is impeccable beyond belief. I truly have never had such amazing guest service. Ask for him. Be blown away. We ordered octopus for an appetizer. And our entrees were ravioli and fettuccine.

But once I saw their menu and great location. We had to try it out and I am SO glad we did. First off let me begin, what really made our meal fabulous is the manager, Mirko. I knew it was her when she walked up because she was so warm and welcoming. We ordered the seafood platter that is designed to be shared with several people so we went with that. We also ordered mussels (one of my faves), argula salad, fresh pasta. And Mirko decided to make us table side fresh dessert, which was such a nice touch for the birthday girl. I will be honest. Before Mirko came over, our service was very slow and the waiter wasn't very attentive. But once I told Mirko that we had a birthday, everything changed. I am glad we got to meet the manager.

2942615,2018-03-12,1,WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag,"Mercato Della Pescheria is an Italian Seafood Restaurant located in the Venetian Casino Hotel by the Canal Shops. They prepare some of the food they serve with coal smoke that is unique for a different taste. Most of the seating is on a big what looks like an outside patio. That sits in front of an Italian Market with ancient looking Italian Buildings behind. On my visit near to the patio were people singing in Italian, a stilt walker and a person pretending to be a statue. It was kind of like a mini circus.

I think what I enjoyed the most (food wise) was the amazing hot crusty flavorful bread they served. It was the best Italian Bread I tasted in many years. I sure could go for more right now.

We ordered and the food came out very rapidly.

We started with the Swiss Chard Ravioli. They were quite good and also house made. Pasta might be the sweet spot here.

For dinner I tried the Coal Smoked Sea Bass. It was a very large portion of fish that had all the middle bones removed. It had a slight coal smoked taste. I thought the fish was prepared reasonably well but did run slightly dry. My plate also came with saffron laced cauliflower puree,  some cauliflower and fennel arugula salad.

My husband tried the Veal Osso Bucco. His plate was good but not perfect. The risotto was ran dry and was slightly crunchy and the meat was flavored nice but also was a little underdone in a few parts. 

OK -Bread is great! Pasta is very good,  Proteins not perfect.

After being seated we were given the dinner menu.  I asked for the lunch menu which I seen online but was told the lunch menu is not available this week.  With the HIMMS conference in the Venetian this week, I guess they thought why not take advantage of all the expense account clients. I probably should have just left at that point.   
My wife had the Caesar salad which was much smaller and not nearly as tasty as the one in the Grand Luxe Cafe.  I had the charred tuna steak which turned out to be one of the weirdest fish dishes I have ever been served.  It was blackened with something that tasted like instant coffee and served on what was advertised as a red wine reduction but was a really dark sauce that might have been ok for short ribs, but way inappropriate for tuna.  The blackening and sauce overpowered any taste of the tuna.  

Otherwise service was fair for a busy convention lunch time.  Ten buck for bottle of Pellegrino and sixty two buck for a middling Pinot Grigio seemed par for the experience.",DImSWbNzO4wneKgla6IHpg,0,0,2,8F4dfYalKoXOZk-NlNMnAw

The one thing this restaurant has is ambiance... sitting on a patio in St. Marks Square! That was the memorable part, along with the cool tomato cans on the table with bread. The rest... okay but not memorable. An Italian menu (no kidding huh?) and we focused on pasta for supper - spaghetti and meatball, carbonara, spaghetti with clam, and Swiss ravioli. None were bad but my carbonara seemed to have sat under heat lamps a bit longer than I would have preferred. Desserts were good - cheesecake and chocolate torta. Only item I can honestly say was distasteful was the espresso martini. The foam was thicker than I've ever seen in an espresso martini and whatever they used to make the foam left the drink tasting soapy. But the negroni was good so if there is another visit I'll certainly opt for that.",r-BStHfrLUjGID8m1I2Zog,0,0,3,HcF60vMM131N5E3tSgLSzw

My daughter and I had ""happy hour"" snack at 3PM as we had a late dinner scheduled.

We had oysters, a mini pepperoni pizza and the grilled octopus.  Every item was $6 which seemed like a good deal.

The pizza was very good.  The pepperoni had a spicy kick on a thin crust.  The size was bigger than I thought it would be given the price.

The grilled octopus had very good flavor.  Portion was pretty small but makes sense given the pricing.  However, the meat was mostly the body part (not tentacles) which made me think they save the better parts for the full-priced menu (which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine.  If you're going to have happy hour, don't have the food be 2nd class citizens on the menu).  But maybe the regular order is the same, who knows.  The octopus was on a bed of mashed potato which I thought was an odd pairing.

The oysters were a bit sad.  First, you get 2 for $6 which seems like pretty regular pricing, even for a nice restaurant.  This is the happy hour deal???  How much they they regularly cost?  The weren't very good oysters either and the accompaniments (cocktail and vinaigrette) were not very good as well.

All in all, not bad.  The setting is cool as you get to sit in the patio area of Palazzo/Venetian's St. Mark's Square.",zl_-zhvO1SrTywpQ0pDphg,1,0,3,WdfvvWNNomzxsOJv5jFZAg

The food:  I had seared tuna salad. The salad was fine (pretty hard to mess up lettuce). The tuna appeared as if they took a torch to the outside.  It was literally BLACK and crumbling. The inside was close to what you would expect for seared tuna. It was even a decent piece of fish.  But, I cook better on my gas BBQ when blindfolded.  The bread is only ok, nothing great.  

Service:  started out fine but when I commented about the fish she couldn't get away from me fast enough. I think the tile floor has skid marks on it from her acceleration. Questioning the food was so disdained that they never came back until I was done and ready for the bill.  Not even to refill my tiny ($6.00) glass of iced tea.

My experiences were more than stellar both times I came here for happy hour. I was looking for an inexpensive location to have some snacks and drinks, and this was perfect. The happy hour lasted until 7pm, unlike most of the other restaurants in Venetian and Palazzo which end at 6pm. 

I tried the Cosmo Bianca, Negroni, Limoncello cocktail, and pepperoni pizza. I did not know that the Negroni is a super bitter drink, so I did not like it and passed it along to my boyfriend who is used to bitter drinks (IPAs). The Limoncello was exceptional and strong, giving me a slight buzz. The Cosmo Bianca is a regular cosmo but with peach puree instead of cranberry; unfortunately it was a bit too sweet for me, and I squeezed a few lemons in it and it tasted really delicious. 

The reason why I am giving this place five stars is because of the pizza. Wow, I was so blown away that I'm pretty sure my boyfriend was sick of hearing me rave about the pizza. I've been to Italy multiple times, and every time I end up eating my weight in pizza because Italian style pizza is just divine: thin, soft but slightly chewy crust, thin but flavorful layer of sauce, and perfectly creamy mozzarella. This place had the perfect Italian style pizza outside of Italy, I was so shocked by the flavors and the texture of the pizza that I insisted we come back the following day. Also, the pizza was only $6 for a personal sized pizza! Comparable to the 5 euro pizzas I had back in Italy. I was so happy to find this place, and I will insist on going back every time I am in Vegas. Maybe I'll even try the seafood at some point... Likely not.

At last, he did but he had my wife sample it (rather than the one who actually ordered it) and finally the calamari came out.

The ambiance of the restaurant was very befitting of its cuisine type and location in the Venetian, and they have the option for guests to be seated at the outdoor (but really indoor) patio where you can view the show that appears every few minutes in the center of St. Marks Square. 

My boyfriend and I were seated quickly since we had reservations and were immediately greeted by Moises. Not to discredit the other servers at this establishment, but Moises was so enthusiastic and very engaged as a server. His recommendations were perfect and he was very patient even though we had several questions about the menu. 

We ended up ordering the Calamari and Tuna Tartare to share, while our entrees consisted of the Margherita Pizza and Seafood Risotto. I know Calamari is a pretty common dish, but something about this particular version made the batter very light yet still very crispy. The Tuna Tartare had a beautiful presentation with a great taste to match, while the Margherita Pizza was very tasty. I definitely think the Seafood Risotto was my favorite menu item out of all though, as they prepare it with a plentiful amount of seafood and the consistency of the dish is not runny at all.  

I also wanted to mention that Alessio, the manager at the time, was very warm and friendly with not just our own table but all tables that I could see. It is not always the case where the manager is able to touch each and every table, but it seemed like Alessio was on a mission to do just that. 

If I have not already said it, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone especially if Seafood/Italian cuisine is a favorite.

Our server was Italian and was very attentive, always available and his suggestions were followed and enjoyed. 

We had cocktails and starters were 1/2 dozen oysters and the cured meat platter. Very tasteful and plenty of it - with the fresh baguette in the tomato can - cute and a nice touch. I chose the seafood linguine Nd my partner the osso buccu on risotto. All too much to finish but we tried since it was great.  I tasted both dishes and some of the best I have had.

The surroundings remained busy, but not intrusive and some live music too by a trio with a guitar, an accordion and a singer which was mostly opera. Obviously there was a noise tour group here and there, but you take the good with the bad.

As we walked towards the restaurant and looked through the menu, we decided to forgo our reservation at another Italian place nearby and try this one for dinner. The ambiance convinced our gut feeling right away.

Aside from the elaborate setting and sophisticated furnishing indoor as well as patio, I was so touched by the sincere hospitality and focused attention of the wait staff.  The professionals here (I hardly use the word ""professional"" for wait staff, just because they are usually very part-time and ""green"" at so many places) pay attention to your tasting and eating progress intensely, but at a very comfortable distance.  This, tell me that people know exactly what they are doing.

Now the five-course Valentine dinner made with love:

Oyster appetizer-- fresh, elegant, just the right teaser

Grilled scallop-- seductive presentation, beautiful balance between the scallop and veggie base.  The soup/juice was a killer delicious treat.  We were handed spoons to finish it all.

Lobster risotto-- rich but not greasy, tender and flavorful... if only all the chefs in the world can do risotto right like this one...it melts in your mouth.

Filet mignon-- the best piece I've had in a long time.  Again, the chef here is so confident with his/ her skill, you don't even get to be asked about ""how would you like it done.""  It was just done right, with the right amount of pink inside.  The mashed polenta base was mesmerizingly yummy.

Passion fruit & chocolate cheese cake-- boy...by the time we got to this part, the tummies were honestly packed with satisfaction, and the bodies were in heavenly coma.  I took a few delicious bites and had to take the rest home.

Beautiful experience.

Ordered a few appetizers, Ceasars salad, Burretta, fried calamari and a pepperoni pizza. I liked them all except the pizza. The crust was too salty for me. They brought complimentary baggette bread it was so fresh, crusty and went
well with the olive oil and vinegar. For dinner we each ordered pastas, fettuccine alfredo, linguni with seafood, and the table side pasta they make inside the parmigian cheese. Overall the pastas was ok. Also I had checked in on yelp and I told my waiter about the free drink when you check in and he never brought it out. I
was too shy to ask for my free drink the second time. 
For dessert I ordered the tiramisu table side presentation. It was amazing. I recommend that one. All and all I would dine here again but I will try there fresh whole fish. The restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated.",-WLZPVvx3ihakIJagb_7mQ,0,0,4,5M0KNoObBX_IMNjOEn3UFw

Better yet, Happy Hour menu was generous, best I've seen. 50% off wines, pizza, meat and cheese platters. Try the white pizza with shrimp and arugula.

The staff is so welcoming and nice! We sat at a table on a Monday afternoon and the manager, Alessio, immediately greeted us in Italian. Che meraviglia! 

The menu is not extensive but variegated. I got the half panino con prosciutto crudo San Daniele with a side of tuna tartar and my friend got the gnocchi alla sorrentina. How delicious! All the ingredients are fresh and the gnocchi were made in house. Oh oh and the burrata was the touché! It comes with a truffle oil and tomatoes, a great combination of flavors. 

An espresso was just what we needed to end this great meal. 

This is how an Italian from Italy likes to eat: fresh delicious food, good company, warm staff, and a characteristic ambience that recalls your origins.

We explained that we were going out that night  to another restaurant and that we did not want anything heavy and he helped out with the selection of octopus which was fantastic.  The octopus was flavorful and mixed perfectly the pesto type sauce and celery and roasted potatoes.

My wife and I then split the Mediterranean Sea Bass which was exquisite.  It was roasted in a paper shell with spinach, potatoes, nuts and grape tomatoes.

As far as price- it's not a cheap but you know that going in.  I think for the quality of food and service it is worth the price.

5816667,2017-09-13,0,WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag,"Check-in on Yelp for a free cocktail coupon! 

This is one of the stops on the ""Food Tours of America"" Food and Dessert Tour and has quickly become one of my favorite spots in the Venetian! 

Located in the heart of St. Marks Square, the ambience pays homage to authentic marketplaces in Italy. They make their pasta in-house every day and when you try it, you can definitely tell! 

Favorite item on the menu? The Table Side Tiramisu. That's right: TABLE SIDE TIRAMISU. Just like ordering table side guac, they roll out with a little cart and make that sucker right in front of you. They drench the ladyfingers in espresso, whip the marscapone cheese, pour it over the ladyfingers and finish it off by hand grating the chocolate on top. It is a MUST try! The consistency is less creamy than traditional ""set"" tiramisu, but it truly is worth licking the bowl for. 

If tiramisu isn't your thing, the ricotta cheesecake is also a creamy wonderland of decadence!  

As for dinner, the meatballs are the smoothest, most velvety creation I've ever tasted and their Swiss Chard Ravioli is a treat enough to share or keep to yourself! (Tip: save some of the table bread and dip it in the pesto cream sauce!) 

If you sit on the patio, you'll have a great seat for the street-performers every half hour (opera singers, jugglers, human statues, musicians etc) but these performances do draw a crowd and reverberate throughout the Square, so if you're looking for a more intimate evening, I'd opt to sit further inside.",kiifWjFj0hjdMST9ly_AUQ,0,1,4,4cO6JtevkTZIEa5z2qWPUQ

5919165,2018-02-10,4,WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag,"Located within Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian, it's one of a few restaurants among the shops in the very well done (pseudo, of course), St. Mark's Square.  This version of St. Mark's may not be the original, but it's way cleaner and without pigeons or their leave behind excrements.

Under a lovely painted perfect blue sky, a classical trio, and the faux outdoor dining -- awesome.  A bit Disney, perhaps, but they've captured many of the senses to the real thing in Venice.

My gf and I sat at one of the ""outdoor"" tables, and was served by Udelle who was the utmost pro - lovely, conversational, laid back, and totally set the tone for the night.

The menu had a wonderful mix of Italian specialities and fish...and so many tempting and pleasing choices.  We proceeded to order (after chomping on amazing fresh and warm bread):

1.  Meatballs Appetizer [$14 for 3 balls, 4.0 stars] -- I gotta have them!  A little overpriced, but a great ball (and I don't say that to many places).  I loved the sauce, it was a great starter for things to come.

2.  Mama's Lasagna [$25, 4.5 stars] -- Tasted freshness all the way and one of the best I've had (mine's better).  Would have preferred the noodles to be thinner, but excellent nonetheless.

3.  Chicken Pesto Pasta [$26, 4.0 stars] -- we asked for creamy pesto, and we got it.  Nice portion, but a little on the boring side.  Needed veg or pine nuts, or something to break up the monotony.

Overall, it was very enjoyable and I'd definitely be up to coming back.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,13,11,4,Tp3qGsnYf3XvrGSlRztuPw
