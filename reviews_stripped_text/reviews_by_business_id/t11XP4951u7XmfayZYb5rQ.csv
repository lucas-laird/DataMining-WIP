The owner was also there to assist us, and also hook us up. Really good customer service. I had a to go and the owner assist us with free drinks while waiting. Like whhhhaaaattt!!!! I can also see all the chicken getting grilled and chop! I will recommend this place to everyone especially if you work out ""need some gains"" and trying to get some grilled chicken for less price not having to do it yourself on your busy day. The owner was the Man! If I can give this place more than 5 star, I would!!! Specially coming from a business owner myself!",nTn9X1UjMwcHge0q3d2xzg,1,2,5,DZcmzNVtQiZ0cNjEWWR0DA

I just grabbed a steak burrito and it was very good. It reminded me of my Santa Barbara days. The steak was seasoned and not skimpy. The rice was also good, not too bland or salty. The burrito came with beans, steak, guac, sour cream and lettuce. The lettuce was unusual but it added a layer of freshness. I only gave four stars because I did not sample the chicken which seems to be the moniker of the establishment.",MwpK7PqQX7fgTFM2Pfy61w,3,1,4,NK7Q2aqBC5heDoJNl9DZuQ

As I stated, I used to come here all the time. I developed a love-hate relationship for this place. A lot of the high points and low points of the eatablishment were still present during my recent visit.

Some lows. The language barrier is still annoying. Most of my issues with this place can be tied to this. It took awhile for them to get my order correct, before the main guy took over, the woman who was initially taking my order just kept repeating the special for the day. I hate having to hover to make sure my order is correct.  I asked for all green sauce and I was almost given red. I was almost given a 2-liter of coke since I was about to be given a totally different order than what I asked for. All of my chicken was dry and some of it was tough, this was the first time I got chicken that was bad.

The highs. Even though there is a language barrier, everyone working there is really curtious. I was given extra roasted onions and jalape√±os when I asked. I was given some extra chicken for free. Like I said earlier, it was dry, but it was still free. The green sauce saved all the chicken.  It has a really nice bright flavor, it has to be made with crack and angel tears. Everything was pretty affordable. Chicken that was prepped in house, grilled and chopped up right in front of you.

I'll keep coming back when I have a craving for grilled meat. I'll just have to remember to come in when they first open up to get the first batch of freshly grilled and moist chicken. I'd recommend this establishment to other people.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,0,0,3,W1nmsh0GMY9IEjd1vxiz5w

Am not a fan of Mexican, but this has such a different freshness. I love this place.",Nx4R_BdL5nspyQOgG3VwUQ,0,0,5,cxKDIucyac_J1snDJjG9PA
