277119,2015-06-20,1,J2Am_nJkdicGk2S1DzwuPA,"This is the conversation I just had at the drive through:
Carl's: would you like to try our all American burger?
Me: no thank you. Can I get two all natural burgers, one with no tomatoes?
Carl's: ok, so two all American burgers? Do you want those in a meal?
Me: no, I want two all natural burgers, one with no tomatoes. No meal, just the burgers.
Carl's: ok. Do you want 1/2lb or 1/3lb?
Me: don't they come single patty or double?
Carl's: yes we can do single patty on those.
Me: ok, both single patty then please.
...then I ordered a kids meal...
.......then I waited in the drive through behind only 2 cars for about 15 mins. I know the car in front of me only ordered a kids meal because it was on the screen when I pulled up, and I had to sit and wait for carl's to take my order for about 5 minutes, so I had plenty of time to notice.......
...........THEN when I got my food and got home and my husband opened the bag and unwrapped his burger, we realized we did, in fact, end up with two all American burgers instead of two all natural burgers. They have hotdogs and potato chips ON TOP OF THE BURGER!!!! Can you say disgusting?? I won't be going to that Carl's again. I'd rather go out of my way and stop at a different one!",wkHiYUtL5vcpYSPdCFnk3g,2,0,1,3CTImCcsLRx1kTliDB4GUQ
555196,2014-09-23,1,J2Am_nJkdicGk2S1DzwuPA,"The worst carls jr. I have been to in the Pacific time Zone.  Welcome to whale-burger. 

The service is slow and my food was cold.  If I wanted to reheat my food I would've bought it yesterday!  In the drive-thru there was only one car before our 3burger and 2side order, order and it took longer than 15mins because there was an issue with their order and the Carl's jr operator had to explain the situation to the other fat-neck turkeylegged-forearm smoking female customer why changing her order at the drive-thru window takes longer.  Hurry the famous-star up you double patty neck thickburger. Carl's jr operator, make that beached whale pull her smoking blowhole around so other people can get their already made food that's already sitting there getting cold which is all ready to be paid for and eaten.  There is a drive-thru line waiting to poach that humpback Honda accord and sell her to the Spring Mountain markets of Chinatown.  People are starving !

After expressing my displeasure, they acknowledged their mistake and tried to rectify the situation by offering a free drink and a cookie and then asked if we wanted any condiments and we requested ketchup and ranch for the fried zucchini.  Still displeased by being nurtured with sweets for our time from sitting in a ""fast food drive-thru"" we paid form our cold food and drive three major streets over home to eat our food.  

The fried zucchini was cold and I had to put it in the oven.  The burgers were smashed and slopped together in such inattentive mess that there was sauce all over the wrapper coating the outside buns of the cold burgers.  As if the Carls jr food assembly line took their frustration out on the successive cars who's only crime was paying for food behind a bad customer's poor order.   The food literally looked like garbage.  Pieces of lettuce soaked in condiments sliding around inside a wrapper slapped together with squished tomatoes and a smashed bun made the food very unappealing to taste.   The only thing that wasn't cold was my shake which melted from waiting and is now sitting in my freezer to be frozen again.",TwvQWKJ4F1pkwkLeDA_sdA,3,0,1,IHZOI1-tY_t56-I1-gGJdQ

Do not, I repeat, do not go to this place after 8pm. To anyone who is reading this petty, what may seem like a typical review, please head my warning as i have been to this establishment many times during evening hours and it is absolutely atrocious.
The food not only takes COUNTLESS minutes to prepare, there's never a %100 guarentee you're gonna get what you paid for. 
The service I received is the only reason I decided to finally get on and yelp about this. I'm fucking done with this locations garbage. 

Ex.1: I ordered my most favorite sandwich from this place, a double western bacon cheese burger only to return home and discover my onion rings were missing and their signature BBQ sauce was that of a generic paste. They used their sauce packet BBQ cause they were either out of their signature BBQ or the cook had a lack of knowledge.
Ex.2: That wasn't even the worst part. I think what made it all worse was the time I spent WAITING for an order that was destined to be fucked up. There were 3 cars ahead of me when I ordered at the drive through at 11:50pm. By the time I finally reached the pickup window, it was already 12:18am not joking I'm trying to be as honest as possible cause people who exaggerate on Yelp are theworst. 
Might I add that one of the cars actually left without picking up his food? Must've realized they were gonna take forever. I suppose I'm part of the problem though cause it's me that continues to revisit this place time and time again hoping for there to be some change cause it's no lie when I tel you I've been coming here for about a year now and it's always the same. There's only ever 2 employees working graveyard and it's treacherous. Moral of the story is DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION AFTER 7-8PM. It's just not good. You'll waste time, money, gas. For reals. Please listen to my complaint.
I tried to keep it short but this place burned me for the last time. I had to get it all out.

2911406,2016-04-02,5,J2Am_nJkdicGk2S1DzwuPA,"Located just north of the Raising Cane's on Rainbow and Warm Springs, Carl's Jr. is pretty easy to find. Never been a huge Carl's / Hardees fan, but recently have discovered their chicken sandwiches.

(+) Chicken sandwiches are tasty! I have tried the Chicken Club and BBQ Chicken Sandwich in the past week and have enjoyed both. 
(+) They have a 2 for $6 promo where you have a choice to mix or match any 2 of the following: Western Bacon Cheeseburger, Famous Star, BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and the                    Carl's Turkey Burger. Not a bad deal! Also the $4 deal with 2 sandwiches, small fries, and a drink all for $4! 
(+) friendly employees, for the most part..

(-) as friendly as the employees are, sometimes service can be slow as molasses! Easily my biggest complaint here...and sometimes it happens when there is no signs of any customers around.
(-) while some of the promos are good, the prices are a tad bit pricey if you want to try something not tied in to a promo. $5.69 for a chicken club from a fast food joint? Damn.


This place is alright. I like the way they do their chicken, so I will be back. If it isn't a part of a promo though, I really don't see myself trying other things on the menu. Just doesn't seem worth the price they charge for most things.

3 stars.

* Once you walk in, the floor seems kind of sticky. Like someone spilled soda on the floor and used that to clean it. The workers don't really have that welcoming presence that you would normally find at a normal restaurant. 

* With the 4 for 4 deal, you get a spicy chicken sandwich and cheeseburger with fries (& a drink). The burgers, at first look, looked so flat. Like there was nothing in there but a patty and cheese. First bite into the cheeseburger and my mouth felt like a Sahara desert. The patty was dry. Like I practically drowned it in ketchup so my mouth had moisture. The spicy chicken sandwich wasn't that bad but it wasn't even spicy. They might as well have called it a chicken sandwich. The fries were good though. Tasted like McDonalds fries (which is good because those are my favorite).

My favorite is the western bacon cheeseburger and my husband likes to try different burgers they come out with occasionally. Their shakes are really good and I like how they have criss cut fries as another option for fries.,P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,3,RiqJRi_fjyyDtOu9n0EijA
