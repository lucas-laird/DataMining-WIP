Drinks kept filled, food came reasonably quick, and a well mannered waitress. We ordered the the all you can eat BBQ deal. As far as I'm concerned the meats were good and tastey, other restaurants of this kind may sometimes have more side dishes but I feel they are condiments and is not much of significant part of the review. From where I am from we don't have anything like this, but I go have Korean BBQ in Chicago and the prices we pay individually for one kind of meat is similar to the same price per person for this Korean buffet bqq so I don't see it as a relatively more expensive place.",8Kh6xDzaRThvQEGeld2GvQ,0,0,5,SCN2J53ALW7LRRNSH82vDw

90410,2013-03-30,1,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"I was wondering why this place was nearly empty, but not for long.

Their AYCE menu is split up into three categories. Nevada (~$15.99) has the basics of KBBQ: beef brisket, pork belly, marinated chicken, and a few other meats. Vegas (~$19.99) and the last option (~$23.99) offer more protein goodness like beef tongue, spicy marinated meats, and large intestine. You can't go wrong with any of them, really. It's meat. 

Kimchi, sliced fish cakes, bean sprouts, broccoli, marinated jalape√±os, and potato salad make up their banchan. Pretty standard quality and flavor. Wish that I got to try their steamed egg though. They don't have rice paper, so you can either chow down on salad or order rice.

Service was inconsistent considering that my coworkers and I were some of the few diners that evening. They would bring the meats and banchan out quickly, but didn't respond to our repeated requests for water. I know we're in the desert and all, but should we really have to ask several times? Even when the water pitcher was finally brought over, the eight of us drained it before the ice had a chance to melt.

Despite being able to hear our voices echo in the sheer emptiness, our simple requests went unheard. Their food is decent, but can't make up for the poor service.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,2,1,2,0UCBwd3uvf4kIj6AkRzLfA
95696,2015-05-20,0,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"I usually go to Tofu Hut, but they were very busy and had a long waiting list. I tried this place a couple weeks ago and felt that they lacked in their customer service. Not only did they keep ignoring our table and walking past us, but whenever they ask if we need anything or if I ask for food, they would forget what we had asked for. While we were waiting for our second order of food, some other lady had come over and just turned the heat off. Once we got our food, we had to ask them to turn the heat back on. Upon getting the receipt, we noticed that a party of 5 or less is 15% gratuity while a party of 6 or more is 18% gratuity. No wonder they have bad service. They get their tip anyway.

I had tried giving this place another chance today since their food tasted good and my boyfriend hasn't had Korean BBQ in a long while. It was the same issue: bad service. We had to ask the waitress to refill our water multiple times. Not only that, but one of the waitresses had turned our heat low and when we had gotten our food, it wasn't cooking fast enough. My boyfriend had accident turned the heat off and we just sat there, waiting for a waitress to come over. It took 5+ minutes for a waitress to be seen and she just tried walking past us. When we got her attention, we asked to get the heat started again and she just nodded and went to help another table. We got her attention again she assumed we wanted to change out the grill. She understood once we said it clearly and then walked away. Knowing how their service is, we got up and walked to the front for them to give us our check and to pay. 

I would not recommend to come to this location for your ayce Korean BBQ. They set a limit of an hour and a half to eat, their gratuity is automatic, and their service is horrible.",eQhp-4UQtrWecCGBfoGFAA,0,0,1,qb2FSLwnyNnE-ZXUOv3B8Q

It started from the moment we sat down. We were waiting on 2 people and they were literally 2 minutes away and we asked the server (after calling for her because we had been sitting there for 10 minutes without being greeted) if we could start ordering. Her being rude you could imagine how she sounded when she told us we have to wait for our whole party to show up and that ""we could wait"". If we could wait we wouldn't be trying to order for the whole party as they're parking to meet us. A minute later the rest of the party shows and we get ready to order. We were told that if we eat all you can eat that we have to order the same thing...we had no choice!! One of my friends just wanted soup. Her sister just wanted noodles. Me and my girl wanted the all you can eat. THIS IS NOT PERMITTED HERE. We were told if we wanted to order that way we had to sit at different tables!!! Keep in mind the fine print on the menu does not say any type of RULE like this. They have a alacart part of the menu so how could this be a ""rule"". After explaining to the server that the 2 others that came with us will not be eating off our all you can eat and that what they are ordering had nothing to do with them cooking the food on the grill on the table they still insisted that this was not permitted. We decided to go to tofu hut instead which is real close. They had no such rule and the place was packed. This is not the end. We had to pay for the 2 sodas that we never drank. So of course we asked for to go cups and they acted like they did not want to do it... long story short, don't waist your time....oooohhhh and I forgot. If you plan on eating there alone, just turn around because you have to have a person with you. So no eating there by yourself...smh",RZi7YeX7tm_UecPjBuekTA,0,0,1,I2FKIrJz29jrgvMkby64ew

Now that sister location, Maru in Summerlin, has closed we decided to return to KGBH after years of absence.
What happened? This place used to be as close to BBQ in Korea as you could get in Las Vegas.
No more! The meat was too thin and possibly old. The side dishes were too few and absent the favorites such as cucumber Kimchi and bean sprouts.
Worse, they no longer serve a scallion salad which is fundamental to any good Korean beef BBQ.

They are either dumb or careless (because their price for AYCE is not bad), they will ask you to order the food and they will never give you help ""how to order"", and they have no slightest idea how long it's going to take them to bring the food you order to your table. 
So when our party of 5 ordered beef, it took them 20 minutes, to bring us a plate of beef, and the portion was only good for one person! We asked didn't you see there are five of us? They smiled and said, you can always order more!
OK.... And the next thing we find out is, you'll have to wait before you can order more, because there are tables waiting to make the first orders. 
They don't seem to have enough waiters and meat slicer/ operators, at all. 
All tables are complaining, none of us would consider to come back. 
The taste of the food? Two items are good for me: steamed egg- I love it, I ordered it twice. The beef is pretty good to. However I would not pay $30, to have steamed egg and beef slices,  with extremely slow and chaotic, careless service. 
The worst part is: they all think they're doing the right thing, there was no apology, at all, needless to say any sign of future improvement.

The service was alright. After they seated us they took their time to ask us if we were ready to order with out giving us a menu.


If someone does go here please please read the menu at the bottom

There's also 3 different menus 
Nevada 15.95
Locals 19.95

-parties are seated in random order; they don't keep track of who came when, so there's a good chance you'll wait longer than the people who just walked in
-if you order in English (as I did) you'll probably get ignored, but if you order in Korean (as my husband did), you have a chance they'll at least write your order down (though they won't actually bring it all)
-it's nearly impossible to get drink refills, and it's also difficult to get the servers to bring essentials like chopsticks, straws, and napkins to the table
-if it's not clear already, it's worth noting that the servers are inefficient and unfriendly, to say the least
-but despite this bad service, the most shocking part is that **THERE'S AUTOMATIC GRATUITY FOR PARTIES OF TWO** (maybe because their service rarely warrants any tips?)

This place is a favorite of a friend's so after we helped another friend install a TV mount and put up his TV, this is where we came for lunch/dinner on a Sunday afternoon. 

There are two options available for AYCE (All You Can Eat). Vegas Package at 19.95 and Spring Mt Package at 23.95. The entire party needs to pick the same package (fear of unable to restrict the sharing among the group without strict supervision)

Vegas Package includes Cha Dol (Brisket), Premium Sam Gyup Sal (Pork Belly), Pork Skin, Pork Neck, Beef/Pork Galbi, Beef/Pork Bulgolgi, Spicy pork/chicken/pork belly, teriyaki chicken, baby octopus, spicy/regular calamari, gyoza, steamed egg, casserole, Korean bean paste stew, house salad, and ice cream (you can see they put a sticker over the previously offered rice paper roll). 

Spring Mt Package includes everything the Vegas Package does, but additionally, pork shoulder, thin cut sam gyup sal (pork belly), beef tong, dak chang (tripe), chi ma sal (flank), honey garlic shrimp, shrimp with salt, seaweed spring rolls, jap chae, and spicy soft tofu soup. 

For an additional only $4, my friend and I wanted the Spring Mt package but the other 6 wanted the Vegas package so we opt'ed for that. 

We had ordered the brisket, pork belly, spicy chicken, beef galbi w/ some steamed egg originally. The portion sizes were pretty big. I don't know if it varies due to party size but for each order, we got a really large amount of brisket, spicy chicken, and beef galbi. Overall, pretty decent quality of meats throughout. Various banchan available including kim chi, potato salad, fish cake. The brisket was good. Not much of a fan of marinated meats but they were ok. 

Not a bad place. Only downside is the offerings are quite minimal. Beef tongue is not included in the Vegas Package is a bit saddening. Wish they had beef tongue included as there already isn't much of a selection in terms of non-marinated items. Steamed egg was decent but I feel like its much smaller than those others that offer steamed egg as well. Quite deflated even before getting to the table, which makes it even smaller than it already is. 

The ventilation in this place is horrible, if they even work at all. Our hood that spanned the table did not seem to be ventilating anything. Upon entry of the restaurant, you can already tell its pretty bad when there was only 2-3 groups here and it smelled pretty heavily already. Service wise, not bad. They gave us a pitcher of water as well as went around with another to help refill. Fairly decently attentive in terms of ordering and asking if anything is needed.

They have this oil and salt mixture that I cannot find at other KBBQ places. It's amazing, and complements the meats so well. Honestly, it might be the reason why this review is getting five-stars.

I would go here every week with a friend and without a doubt it was my favorite place and it was awesome. However They recently got rid of the a la carte.
 
Let's be honest, korean bbq is expensive and it's hard to find a good place. When I USED to go I would order the beef brisket and split it with my friend and this was enough for the both of us. This would allow a fair price with plenty of food. We ordered the same thing everytime and it never got old. It was our go to for korean bbq! However they got rid of this option and you can no longer just buy the entree as they force you to get the ""all you can eat"" which is significantly more expensive.

If you ignore the price, the food was awesome. I won't lie, the beef brisket is probably the best I've tried. However, my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth as the waitress was rude to us.

Back to the review.  O.K.  This restaurant was a bit hard to find.  It is actually up on the second floor.  When you walk into the restaurant, it is very open, clean, and inviting.  It was a cool place.  I give Atmosphere a solid 4.

Service... well, let's say that our waitress started off strong.  Got us the water, the appetizers, and extras.  As the meal progressed, she kinda forgot about us.  We had to request more water, more food, and the check (we had to track her down).  I give this a 3.... should be lower, but she was sweet.

Now, for the food.  Well, for $19.99, you had all you can eat.  However, they provided you with the variety tray.  After you finish the variety tray, you can add more of the one's you like.  Personally, I do not like this.  There are just some items that we do not like to eat... instead of wasting them, we ended eating anyways.   I rather CHOOSE the selection.  Most Korean restaurant provides you with a buffet cart to pick from.  I was a bit sad to not see Galbee ribs.  They had boneless instead.  Trust me, one of the great joys of eating a Galbee rib is sucking on the bone.  Yes, a bit disgusting. sounds a bit ""gay"".  hey, I am married, I can say that without thinking otherwise...LOL... and, by the way, like the Seinfeld episode... nothing wrong with being gay... they just have a different preference... okay... moving on... the veggies and appetizers were good/average.

They also just don't taste good. The brisket is thin, light, and full of flavor. If you need more flavor then use the sauces that they give you. 

There are ladies who come around to help you cook and what not, but you honestly never need any of their help because come on.... if you're a man, you know how to grill, if you're a woman, you know how to cook. Let's be real. There is no need to review the service because it is an all you can eat. They will be there when you really need them. 

The all you can eat is only 15.95. If you are looking for Kalbi (Korean Marinated Beef), then you would go to Sura. You would be paying over 20 dollars there.",-RgTsYBz_fsGP3_Rn_Q6ow,2,1,4,SMNC4kiYErBG9fQhIGVkpg

1918908,2016-03-21,4,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"A friend recommended coming here, but i've definitely had many better places.

First of all, the GIANT sign outside the door that advertises $16.95 for AYCE is for the most basic option only. The next option is $20.95 and $24.95.

Personally, there's not much options. They're all pretty basic compared to other restaurants.

It was extremely slow on a saturday evening. Doesn't seem like many people eat here, so there's no wait.

What did bother me was that with a whole place thats practically empty, they wanted to seat us next to a table with people. Like couldn't we have sat at least one extra table over so its not so crowded in one corner?

And we asked for more than one salad bowl because the guys eat ALOT of salad, but they refused and kept saying that their salad bowl is huge. So I guess they prefer making many multiple trips to give us salad refills.

Some of the meats are good. I did like the beef brisket, but it was a bit more on the fatty side cause it had a lot of fat. The bulgogi and angus rib finger were very similar. Soft texture but good marinade. 

Pork belly is very thick and dry. Everything else was ok.

Potato salad is good. But was very sad that they don't have rice paper which is a staple for me when eating korean bbq.

I don't like their bbq grills either because they stick easier, and when fatty oils slide through, giant flames jump up from the table. And they get burnt faster too.

They did come by a few times to cut our meat for us. Thats about it.

And they automatically charged us 15% tip even though there was only three of us.
So im assuming that they charge automatically charge you 15% tip for everyone, small or large groups.

The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated. I took my dad their once after church, he doesn't usually like to be adventurous with food but there were enough familiar options that it is a safe place to take your older, non-asian family members as well as your friends.

So today, here we are. 

BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! 

Had to flag our server for water refill, ordering of beers, more meat and to change to change our grill. 

Ordered extra rice and pork belly never came!

We upgraded from Vegas to Spring Mountain- ordered our 1st shrimp and by the time our server came back it was 20 minutes after. Ordered our 2nd batch of shrimp, 10 minutes later had to flag our server down AGAIN and ordered our 3rd batch of shrimp-- She came back and said we are on our 1.30 mark and that would be our last order! UNBELIEVABLE! 

We ordered Sapporo, it was given to us no problem. Ordered miller lite and she wanted to ID us, we asked and said you've given us the Sapporo without asking for ID why is it that all of a sudden she wanted to id us for a second batch of beer.

Gratuity is automatically included and I think that is why their service is going down!

This is truly a good clean place to have k BBQ but they should not include gratuity automatically to the bill! 

This is where we bring ALL our family and friends from out of town BUT never again until they turn around and offer efficient, courteous service! 

So EMBARRASED for bragging about this place to our cousins! 

Had to get a copy of our receipt and the name of our Server- Angie. Just an advice- be genuine, efficient and enjoy the company of your customers! Might as well have fun while working and truly fulfill the needs of the hungry customers.

Not only will we never be back, we didnt even stay for dinner, even after being seated.

The $16 has about 8 items, the $20 about 12 items and the $25 has about 15 items. Problem #1 your entire party/table has to get the same menu. Problem #2 (more of a personal once because it is my fav) they dont have Kalbi on any of the menus. Problem #3 they charge full price for anyone over 7, now i want to meet a 7 year old who can eat just as much as a full grown adult.

 We left and went to Sura where the selection is about 4 times that of Korean Garden, they charge half price for kids under 12 and yup they have Kalbi. The service there is great as well.

Price is on the higher side for what's included. For $23.95 per person, there are others places in the area that's cheaper and better. 90 minutes ayce, but u must cook last order 15 min prior to the end. So that really means it's ayce for 75 min. 

Tip is at a mandatory 15%. They tell you that you have to insert the chip when using credit card.... and when doing so, the lowest tip amount is 15%.

You get your typical house banchan sides, steamed egg, bean paste soup and salad. The choice of meats varies from what price point you choose. 

Our favorite is the Angus Beef Fingers, not sure why they call it that since it's not in strip like chicken fingers but more like slices of meats. It's marinated in the bulgogi style. 

If you're looking for price point choices this is the place to go. When they do get busy the service can be  a bit slow.

It's located in the same shopping center as Ichiza and Tea Station. We came in and were seated right away. The dining area is pretty big and we really enjoyed the ambiance. 

There were three different AYCE options: Nevada, Vegas, and Spring Mountain. We went with Nevada. First, we ordered brisket, pork belly, and steamed egg. It came with the house salad and your typical KBBQ starters (kimchi, broccoli, tofu, etc.). I thought the salad was okay. The waitress quickly brought out the brisket and pork belly. The brisket was delicious, which was enough to seal the deal for us. Pork belly and steamed egg were good, but not amazing. We also ordered the marinated chicken halfway through. The chicken wasn't my favorite, there wasn't much flavor to it. 

To sum it up, the AYCE kbbq was a good experience. My friends and I will definitely come back again, mostly for the delicious brisket. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly and attentive.

Lunchtime rolled around and we just happened to find ourselves on Spring Mountain road across the street from a large sign that said, ""All You Can Eat Sushi.""  We pulled in to the parking lot and checked out the sushi place, but my friend wanted AYKEKB instead.  I live in Torrance, CA where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Korean restaurant, so I was hesitant.  But my friend insisted and we soon found ourselves walking up the stairs to Korean Garden.  The place was nothing special:  Formica tables with a grill and a smoke hood.  The place seemed a little dated and not very busy.  We were greeted by a couple of ajumas and shown to a booth by the window.  The menu was of the Set A for $, Set B for $+, Set C for $$, etc.  We chose our meat and ordered drinks.  Beer choices were Hite, OB, Sapporo and Coors Lite.  My friend had a Hite, I had a lemonade (canned).

The good:  The service was excellent.  Our meat dishes were brought out promptly and the staff lit the grill and proceeded to cook it for us.  Banchan were plentiful and replaced as soon as we ate them.  The meats were excellent.  We had two servings of brisket, rib meat, bulgogi, spicy chicken and pork belly.  The seasoned meats were not overly seasoned so you could taste the actual meat.  The unseasoned beef was tender and flavorful.  I loved the fried salt for dipping. The meat and service were both worth at least 4 stars.  Well worth the price.

The bad:  The banchan.  I know most people don't go to this kind of place for the side dishes, but they are part of the meal.  The napa kimchi tasted old and extremely sour.  The texture was too soft, almost as if spoiled.  This didn't seem to bother my friend who is more of a Korean noob.  More was brought out and it was just as bad.  Persian cucumber kimchi tasted very bitter.  Twice.  I love meat, but I also love a good kimchee on the side. This kind of ruined the meal somewhat for me. Other banchan were OK, beansprouts, shredded daikon in sweet vinegar, fried tofu. 

Overall, I liked the meal, but they really should do something about the side dishes.  I'd really like to give this place 4 stars, but I can't.  This place is pretty good for the tourist or people who just want to try something a little different. Great meat, service and a decent price.

I have never been to a more disgusting place ever. I do not want to go into the sanitary and cleanliness of this restaurant due to Yelp rules but I will say that ""Dirty Dining"" should definitely investigate. 

Honestly not a big fan of Korean BBQ but family wanted to eat here. It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalape√±os, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself. 

we had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her. Our drinks came after we got the food which was pretty unacceptable. I was thirsty!

3014455,2010-09-21,0,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"have you ever visited Korea or gone to a very traditional Korean restaurant that is run by Koreans with Korean servers?  If you have, you are well aware that their service isn't all about smiles and chatting, but one of diligence and speed.  Some reviewers before me complained about the service being awful, but I assume they aren't used to the way things are run in places like this.  It may not be an excuse, but as long as I get my drink refills and food on time and they pass by and glance at our table to ensure that we are constantly well kept, I don't care if Chung Li smiles at me or not.  If they do their job well, I'm happy.

With that off my shoulders, let's get to the juicy review!  This is the sister restaurant of Maru in Summerlin, and I have to say that I prefer this place over Maru any day of the year.  We discovered this place on a whim after trying the restaurant below this one (it was horrid). We walked in and there's a faux well in the dining area and everything is clean and well kept.  That's always a good sign.  They seat you or you tell them where you want to be seated, you get the menu and begin the experience.

They have a variety of traditional Korean dishes, and with the Korean patrons eating there when we first arrived I knew this would be good.  We ordered our typical dishes--bulgogi and kalbi, shrimp tempura appetizer to start.  We asked that they cook it in the back, and they did.  Our tempura was out on our table within five minutes along with the usual side dishes.  I personally love the picked radish and croquette.  Their rokio is good, too, although not the typical white pearl onion version.

Our food arrived promptly, and we waited no more than ten minutes (if that) for the food.  It was good.  I mean really, really good.  When the waitress brought out the salad and then--wait for it.....the radish beef soup,. i wanted to cry.

Let me explain my need for this soup.

When I was five years old my parents took me to a Korean BBQ restaurant back home.  They served this awesome clear broth soup with what I assumed was thinly sliced potatoes and maybe a touch or two of beef.  As simple as it sounds, it's a traditional soup appetizer to have with a Korean meal, and I've eaten it every time I had BBQ out at a restaurant.  For two and a half years we searched Korean BBQ places in Las Vegas for this appetizer, and for some reason none of them serve it.  Finally, after 2.5 years of searching, when the girl brought the soup out in its traditional low-rimmed bowl and I had to use the typical long-stemmed spoon to eat it, i teared up.  My childhood wafting in my face with the smells of radish and beef broth.  It was a great moment.  The soup is simple and contains nothing but clear brother flavored by the radish and beef, with thin slices of radish and one or two pieces of shredded beef in the bowl.  It's simply yummy.

After eating two bowls of it along with the great BBQ and appetizer, I was stuffed and thoroughly happy. I craved the BBQ daily for a week and satisfied my craving for dinner that week.  I never get sick of bulgogi and kalbi.  

When I finally cooked it at our table one night I decided that was the way to go from now on because I could burn my bulgogi a bit more than the cooks in the back would to get that sweeter flavor.  If you ever go to a Korean bbq place, cook it yourself.  It's fun and tasty!

Overall, a great experience, and my only BBQ place where they serve my childhood soup.  I'm looking forward to more of their food again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.  I know that I sing high praises over the soup and the food, but it honestly is that good and is the only spot we will eat Korean food from now on.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,4,ZzlUrD2XI9QA5ON0cJk4rg

 1) They bring the meat to the table but they take forever to come back to put it on the grill. (Trust me, I would love to do the cooking myself but I got called out before for touching the tongs/scissors). They need an excuse for that gratuity.

2) They automatically get gratuity because it's their house rule. I get it that they cook the food/cut the meats on the grill but most of the time they are not around to do it anyway. They probably know that if they leave it to the customers to tip they would get 0 tip because of how bad their service is. 

3) The time limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes is not enough because I spent 45+ minutes of that time, waiting. I was not able to enjoy my meal because they were so slow that I practically just waited all that time. Waiting for the meat, waiting for the drinks, waiting for the bill, etc. 

I probably would not be back anymore. I would rather shell out a few more dollars in a nicer spot where they actually care for their customers rather than be given mediocre food and bad service. My suggestion would be, go here off peak hours - maybe the service would be better.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,3,1,2,wBnrml2YtroSQf_CSbPGpA

This was my 3rd time coming to this restaurant because I enjoyed it here the first couple times, but this is most definitely my 3rd and final time. Today is my mother's birthday & we wanted to take her to a nice dinner that she would enjoy. We chose Korean Garden BBQ. Everything was okay, even though we were being served by a waitress who had a horrible attitude and no personality whatsoever. About an hour into the meal, our extremely rude waitress asked us if we would like our stove turned off IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR MEAL. We clearly were not done, we had a party of 8 people, we weren't even an hour into our apparent ""all you can eat meal"". After we informed her that we wanted more meat, she said that we had a time limit and we would not be given anymore food when we STILL had over 30 minutes left. After taking a look around the restaurant, we had seen other parties that had been there just as long as us, IF NOT LONGER, and they were not told that they had to hurry their meal up. You know what this is called in this day and age ? RACISM, as we were the only white individuals in this restaurant. After we made a complaint to the so called ""manager"", our extremely rude waitress came out and said ""Sorry because the customer is always right"" about 8 times in a row. An apology means nothing if it is completely staged and not genuine whatsoever. Terrible, overall terrible restaurant.

3114607,2017-01-03,1,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"One of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants! This place has been around for years. It was one of the very first K-BBQ joints that my fam and I discovered here in Vegas.

From what I was told by one of the servers, they remodeled the entire restaurant about 3 months ago from today (1/2/2017). The interior became more modern and they've added some new decor. A nice upgrade from before.

Service has never been a problem here and the staff are always attentive. They will keep coming back to your table to ask if you need anything else or to see if the grill needs to be changed. However, this restaurant does get busy and they may miss your table at times when helping other customers, but no biggie.

Compared to other K-BBQ restaurants in Vegas, I prefer their All You Can Eat (AYCE). I base it off the quality, cleanliness, and selection. There are 2 different AYCE prices to choose from. You can either choose the ""Spring Mountain"" menu or the ""Vegas"" menu. There used to be a menu selection called the Nevada, but their menus have changed since they've remodeled.

The Spring Mountain one has a lil bit more items to choose from for just $4 more per person. It would be the better choice. ;] Especially if you like more meat options, seafood, and other miscellaneous food items.

If you're craving for some Korean BBQ, but aren't sure which one to eat at, give this place a try! It's been around for years for a reason. :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,6,3,5,YlYS_trvMjaznEFrkOT58g

3210898,2015-07-04,1,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"Went tonight for my wife's (she is from S. Korea) birthday as she was craving Korean BBQ.  We normally--in the past--have gone to Sura but decided to change it up for this occasion.  Well, we now know that we will NOT be going back EVER to this place!  I will say that the place had decent food...brisket was good and so was the pork bulgogi.  But, the banchan was just mediocre...and based on the review pics from the past it seems liked we didn't get the full selection of side dishes.  

We got there around 6:00 PM and and we started to cook the AYCE ""Nevada"" BBQ (priced at $16.95/person) around 6:14 PM.  I only know this because I started to snap some pics of the group around that time on my iPhone.  Why did I check this a little later on, you ask?  Well, our server rudely wanted to turn off our grill around 7:15 PM and we told her we still wanted to eat a little more.  She then told us that the time limit was 1.5 hrs for the AYCE and we had only 10 more minutes.  Say what?  I was quite shocked as I have never been to a KBBQ that actually had a TIME LIMIT!!!

So, I checked my phone and saw that I snapped the first picture at 6:14 PM.  Which means we didn't have only 10 minutes left, but actually 30 minutes left when we were rudely advised.  Ironically, we were all getting stuffed anyway, and was ready to wrap up soon.  Now keep in mind, that some other tables who came in before us were STILL eating when we were told we had to wrap it up.  I guess they must have had ""cooler"" waitresses than ours.

I asked to speak to the manager and she smiled and listened, but you could tell she could have cared less (""Oh yes, uh huh, ok, sorry...."").  She even told me--as I spoke in a normal voice complaining about how we were cheated out of a half hour in our ""timed"" 1 1/2 hr allotment (geez, that kills me to even have to mention that!)--that I needed to ""calm down"".  After, just standing there for several minutes with no offer to make us feel better or even a nice gesture in words, I said ""Thanks anyway...I guess you can go then""...and she did!

So, be forewarned that depending on who your server is...and I guess if you don't fit the mold of true Koreans/Asians (I'm Korean-American, BTW)...you may be told to wrap it up and stop eating as your time may be up!  So, combined with lousy, slow service, you could be getting very little BBQ for what is supposed to be AYCE.  My advice to you is to go to Sura or another local AYCE Korean BBQ.  At least there you won't get horrible service and a ridiculous time allotment for eating.  If you don't heed my warning, then maybe you better bring a stopwatch to verify that you really are getting 1.5 hrs to eat their so-called ""AYCE"".",2sr6IVXA9KHmcclxQfVizw,3,0,1,8qZVsgxM2dDO5BYAUjGdiQ

Finding the place:
This place is in it's own plaza with parking. Just be careful if you go in another plaza because there's no connection to this plaza. You'd have to go back onto the busy street if you accidentally go in the wrong one.
The place is on the 2nd floor. You can use the elevator or go up the stairs.

Parking:
There's enough parking. Just drive around the back.

Service:
Slow. We went on a Sunday. Initially there was one girl working but as it got busier, another girl came. Service was still pretty slow with the 2 female servers. There's no buzzard...you'd have to wave your hand or do something to grab their attention.

Food:
Not a lot of choices. Meat was not fresh. Meat was frozen as you can you tell from the picture I uploaded.  But you know, for the price that we paid, I guess that's all we can expect.",HTc9vrq0L7r76NxZRHhKnw,0,0,2,F0bdZTvQEMlyVNqbAPDrcA

We'll start with the good: It's open late-- likely to appeal to all the partiers with drunk munchies from nearby XS and Tryst.
They've got a nice large banquet room for large parties that was just perfect for us. 
And I dare say it does strike me as pretty authentic. They even give you a raw egg to crack over your boiling hot soup which is served in traditional korean style bowls.

However, the good things just don't make up for the rest of the experience, which is mediocre at best. The service during our last trip here was pretty unremarkable-- maybe they were just having a rough night but it certainly wasn't appreciated by us.
The soup is not bad but I have had better in california. The quality of the ingredients just didn't seem that impressive to me. And the meat is certainly my biggest complaint of all. The kalbi is ok but not particularly juicy or flavorful, and it is certainly overpriced. All the good stuff on the menu is a bit overpriced and you don't really get that much.

We were not disappointed.  This place is upstairs next to a massage parlor.  I can see parking being a little difficult because there were limited spaces, and tons or places to eat in this strip mall, but we didn't have any problems.  Also, if you read the signs its only one hour customer parking.  I was there longer and didn't get towed, but could be different another time.  Upon entering there were only two other tables being used.  I thought there would be more considering we came in on a Wednesday night around 8pm.

My parents were new to the Korean BBQ Buffet, and the host was very informative on how it works, but at the table they have a bunch of fine print to read.  They only allow two or more people to do the buffet.  Also, you have a 90 minute time limit to order once you have put the first order in- so you cannot sit there all day.  Also, of the two buffet choices, everyone has to choose either one or the other TOGETHER.  Any leftover food can be charged to you, so finish everything.  Now, once the food is out, you can ask them to take some back.  But if it sits at the side of your table, its yours.

We all opted for the $20.00 buffet choices.  There was another one at $24.00 with a couple more options, as well as a A La Carte option. To start, we ordered the chicken, short ribs, Bulgogi, and the Brisket.  They came out with the food rather quickly since nobody else was there, and we began cooking.  We immediately asked them to take back some of the Bulgogi since its looked overwhelming.  But this was not the case- throughout the night, we kept ordering small batches of Bulgogi.  It looks intimidating, but its not once you cook it.

The food was really good, and the service good too, they would sometimes come by to cook and cut meats up at our table.  My only gripe was that it did get a little busy out of nowhere, like 8 more tables showed up.  During this time we asked for more meats, and it took them about 15 minutes to get the meats to us.  They also swapped the grills which is a nice touch too.

There were no issues with the bill, and they automatically put in tip depending on if your party is 5 or less, 6 or more.  I will return here, but maybe not for a while, there are so many places to choose from on this street- I want to try them all.

I cook my own food and request a lot of meat at a time to make up for the service. I also ask for a pitcher of water so I don't have to keep requesting refills.

The service here is so-so.  Our waters didn't come until we were half way through our meal and they were not refilled unless asked to.  Also be warned, the control knob for the grill sits under the table in the center.  When turning on or adjusting the fire setting, two waitresses felt it ok to just reach over me with out so much of an 'excuse me, pardon me' before hand.  That is not ok.  

Despite all of that, the food here is pretty good and I'll probably give this place another try.. maybe.

The restaurant is located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown, and the decor is very plain (typical Asian restaurant). The service is just alright - we were seated and served very quickly, but subsequent visits from the waitress were few and far between (annoying when you're trying to take advantage of an AYCE).

The side dishes were pretty good, and I was happy with the larger than usual quantities. The AYCE I ordered included pork belly, beef brisket, spicy chicken, and spicy pork. I usually judge the restaurant by their spicy pork, as it's my favorite, and this one was a little bit hit and miss - the first order we got was really good, but the second one seemed flavorless in comparison.

Today I went there with my little family. We get our first set of meat.... my husband asked for a fork since he doesn't know how to use chopsticks. 5 mins later still no fork and my husband is now using a spoon to eat his salad. After the first order of meat we were ready to order our second set of meat.... our waitress is catering to the other side of the restaurant. Mind you, this place was NOT busy. They decided to seat us far from the rest of the other guest. So about 15-20 mins of looking around to get someone's attention the lady who is currently on break decided to walk over and ask us, how can I help you?!?! So we ordered and received our meat and started cooking it.... 30 mins later our waiter walks over with our order not thinking we were already served. Wow so it would of taken like 45 mins to actually get our order if we ordered with our actual waitress. Finally, we are finished ordering and need led to get the bill. AGAIN our waitress busy assisting other guest but us. We waited 30 mins still no waitress in sight. So we got up and just paid without the bill. We didn't even wait for the ice cream because it probably would of been an hour before we got serviced.

3813381,2017-08-08,10,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"One of the OG Korean BBQ joint in Las Vegas. I have been coming here since my High School years, so it has a sentimental value among my siblings and I. The customer service has been consistent throughout the years with no big issues. However, do call ahead because it can get busy especially during large conventions and Lunar New Year events. Do keep in mind that this review is based on being an AYCE Korean BBQ. Korean food has exploded in the past years in Las Vegas and there is large influx with the opening of Hobak, Goong, Magal along with other well known AYCEs like Hwaro, Tofu Hut, Doh and Gen in Henderson.

A few items that we enjoy is the delicious, Beef Brisket. This particular cut served here is one of the favorite choice and the thin slices allow for a quick grill and eat. The serving per order is reasonable oppose to other places like Gen, where a limit is set to 3 meat dishes at a time.  Another aspect of KGB that we favor is the variety of Banchan, there is a good variety and some are quite tasty especially the House Salad. Another family favorite is Beef tongue, yes Dila ng Baka in Filipino. Tender and soft, pairs well with the sesame oil that is provided as a dipping sauce :). Plus they have various options for squid; regular or spicy and both are delicious.

The restaurant is open and functional with a good amount of spacing between tables and chairs. Plus with the modern look makes the restaurant more inviting than others. Great option for those in larger groups needing a good variety of options at a reasonable price point. Parking can be a hassle on the busy weekends but you can park in the main Chinatown Plaza and take a short stroll to the restaurant that is directly above Kaya Sushi.

They now automatically apply tip to your bill. I HATE that. It's not like we had a large party, there was only 3 of us. We were all going to tip anyway, but they shouldn't automatically pull 20% from us like that, especially with the level of service we received!

Overall, the food was decent for the price. They have 3 options, from $15/person, $20/person, and $25/person. 

Three AYCE menus:
Nevada ($16.95): Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Pork, Large Intestine, Steamed Egg, Bean Paste Soup, and House Salad.
Vegas ($20.95): ""Nevada"" items plus Kalbi, Bulgogi, Spicy Squid, and Japchae.
Spring Mountain ($24.95): ""Vegas"" items plus Beef Tongue, Dumpling, Shrimp, and Beef Tofu Soup.

We settled for the $20/person choice and ended up getting marinated meat, buldogi, and marinated chicken. Food was decent. Not the best I've had, but better than waiting 2 hours for the same thing in Tofu Hut.

The high points:
Super friendly and personable staff. One thing I really appreciate is that they didn't automatically jump in and cook our food for us without asking, like some other places do. That's part of the fun, and we like to cook and eat at our own pace. 

The decor and hip vibe were a surprising bonus!

The pork belly was tasty, and the beef short rib was an above average cut of meat. 

The spicy squid and spicy baby octopus both came marinated in foil packets with veggies. They cooked slowly, evenly, and were tender and flavorful, instead of the charred rubber you end up with at other places. We seared them off *just* a little bit before nomming.
The beef intestine was surprisingly good, and of the few times I've had it, it's the first time I've enjoyed eating it.  I'd recommend giving it a quick dunk in the spicy sauce from the squid/octopus before devouring because YUM.

The prices are different depending on the menu you pick. You need 2 or more people to do the AYCE meat.  You order your chosen meat, and they arrive in a good amount portion.  It also has a wide space, so it is great for big and small groups.

You usually cook the meat yourself, but the staff will help you in a quicker pace if you are struggling. My friends and I enjoy eating at Korean Garden for the Steamed Egg Soup and Beef Tongue.  The Steamed Egg(Gaeranjim), is one of my favorite dish at Korean Garden.  Like the name, it is steamed egg with a small amount of nice broth.  It makes the steamed egg more like a egg soup, but more thicker and fluffy. My recent visit we ordered the Pork Neck, which was nice and tender.  For the big meat like Neck, you need to cut it into smaller pieces.",SiXUv1oE6uTAbbHXOaXy4Q,1,0,4,X3hzPaGiugIl0PNF3-zSFA

Their portions are very generous, as you can see in the photos. The service was really good. They are very friendly; they check on you every now and then; they cook the meat for you; and they were very accommodating of us having a baby. They made sure that we were all comfortable and having a great time. The meat was of great quality. I loved the plain beef and pork so much. Their bulgogi beef is also very good. Everyone loved it.

When our party of 4 arrived for lunch, the owner was having a business meeting at a front table with 2 other men, and ignored us. We stood ther efor at least a minute or two before a woman, who was talking on a cell phone,  came out to seat us. Then she disappeared. 

The decor is clean, not gritty dirty like some places, simple, and fairly spacious, with vent hoods over the tables and grills for cooking on the tables. Our waitress showed up with the charm of a woman going to see the IRS. She didn't smile and barely talked. 

The 3 meat dishes we ordered were huge, with a lot of meat. The banchan (side dishes) were less than the good places I like, with only 6 instead of 8 varieties. The Kal Bi was flavorful, the Bulgogi tasty and the Chicken decent. 

The total with a soda, tea and 1 beer, with tax and tip was $100, so not a bargain for lunch. I prefer Mother's Korean Grill a block away; it has a lot nicer decor, much better service, and the food is good. You don't have to go upstairs, either.",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,6,5,3,i-pspd891PRbfphEKZy1hw

I do wish they were more accommodating to one of our party members who was a vegetarian and just wanted to spend time with us. They basically charged her $24 for some noodles.

We were able to choose 2 different types of Korean BBQ, a soup, and a beer or soju for just about $26. This is a great deal when it comes to Korean BBQ. The portions were ideal for 2 people. Most of the waitresses were friendly and helpful; however, we had one girl as our main waitress and she was not attentive and awfully rude. She left the bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on the stove too long and it almost burned, so I had to flip them over, cut the meat, and distribute myself. Anytime we asked her for something, she seemed angry and frustrated. We said ""thank you"" for everything she brought over (with extreme delay I might add), and I never heard her once say ""you're welcome"". She spoke fluent English, so I knew that wasn't the issue. Also, the food... I guess coming from the NYC area I am extremely biased; however, I was rather disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near my expectations. The bulgogi was in large pieces and not juicy and the pork bulgogi was not spicy (pork bulgogi is supposed to be a spicy, flavorful dish). The side dishes were the most disappointing part. Usually, in Korean BBQ houses, you receive a bunch of side dishes to compliment your meal. Korean Garden BBQ House only gives about 4.

First, our server brought us our first batch of meat. She threw the meat on the grill and left us. WITHOUT TONGS. That server never came back. I thought she left and went to get the tongs. But she never did. I had to ask another server to get one for us. 

Second, there were six of us but they said we can only order 4 kinds of meat at a time... so, ok.... we grubbed and finished the food, no one even checked with us if we needed anything, or refill our water, or even ask if we want to order anything else.. but ofcourse we do.

I have been here before, but it wasn't this bad service wise. The food were good but the serving is small considering there were 6 of us at the table. Small variety of banchan too! Not even fishcakes!! ='(

4701530,2015-01-14,1,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"I've only been to a handful of Korean BBQ spots in town because they tend to fall short of my Korean food standards. I enjoyed Tofu Hut for their Soon Dubu Chije, but I haven't returned since the SNHD closure. Anyway, I was hesitant as usual to visit Korean Garden, but I was surprised to not hate it. :D

Three AYCE menus:
Nevada ($16.95): Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Pork, Large Intestine, Steamed Egg, Bean Paste Soup, and House Salad.
Vegas ($20.95): ""Nevada"" items plus Kalbi, Bulgogi, Spicy Squid, and Japchae.
Spring Mountain ($24.95): ""Vegas"" items plus Beef Tongue, Dumpling, Shrimp, and Beef Tofu Soup.

Rules: Everyone at your table needs to choose the same type of menu if they're doing AYCE. Minimum of two people. There is a time limit of 1.5 hours. Automatic gratuity of 15% for parties of 5 or fewer and 18% for parties of 6 or more. AYCE menus are not available during convention weeks. Finally, the more obvious; no sharing with non-AYCE diners and you cannot take leftovers.

So, the food? The Banchan was bleh. We were served cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, potato salad, fish cake, and pickled radish. The cabbage kimchi was terrible, but the radish kimchi was all right. The potato salad sucked too. The other two were just whatever. The House Salad was good; really fresh lettuce and a nice dressing. The mandu was the frozen type, so it was just okay. The Beef Tofu Soup or Soon Dubu was bad. This was the main reason we chose the ""Spring Mt."" menu because they normally charge $13 to order this soup separately from AYCE. First, they give you a lunch portion (very small hot pot - I placed my chopsticks next to it in the photo for reference) and it has NO flavor. Either they do not use a stock/broth or their stock/broth sucks. There's no depth and no salt, so all you taste is water and gojukaru (Korean chili flakes). The contents are decent though; beef, lots of soon dubu, zucchini, and onion. Bottom line: Don't order the tofu soup.

For meat, we ordered Brisket, Kalbi, Pork Belly, Spicy Pork, Beef Tongue, and Shrimp. Everything was good! The kalbi didn't have the best cut (it's supposed to be short ribs) or marinade, but it was surprisingly decent. We really liked the brisket, beef tongue, and spicy pork (this marinade wasn't phenomenal either, but it was still relatively good). The shrimp was fresh and tasted great grilled. 

Overall, the meal was satisfying and decent. Unless you're hellbent on having Kalbi, Bulgogi, Squid, Shrimp, Beef Tongue, Dumplings, Japchae, and/or Tofu Soup, stick with the ""Nevada"" menu for $17. However, for just an additional $8, you get everything and it's still a killer deal.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,2,1,3,Phf7DmfCrgf_uf1-Oe6b_g

The food was great; I definitely prefer their sides to Tofu Huts, though I still like Honey  Pig's Kim chi and pickles better. I did miss beef tongue, which they do not seem to have. Sad face. 

It may be due to where our table was; directly along the wait staff's path to the kitchen, or due to the fact that we ate pretty late at night and the restaurant wasn't packed, but we didn't seem to have the service problems a lot of other yelpers encountered. 

Pros:
- Great food, lots of different sides. My favorite bean paste stuff I've had in Vegas.
- You'll have infinitely better luck getting in here than at Tofu Hut. Also, more parking.
- Quite affordable for the amount and quality of meat. Much nicer meat cuts than tofu hut.

They did a stamp card for awhile. I dug that a lot, but they only did it for a bit. Wish they'd bring that back. Also, if they added some Korean pancake in the menu, it'd be perfect! Haha. 

Anyway, when you get here, you'll never wait no longer than 5 mins. If busy, no longer than 15mins. It's large and you'll never have to wait more than an hour like some other kbbq spots. Also, if you have a large party like 6+, they have plenty of tables to accommodate you and your guests.

Initially I meant to go to Tofu Hut, however I was not going to wait an hour for it. Hunting on Yelp, I discovered Korean Garden BBQ House. What interested me were their pricings: 

They have 3 different pricings: Nevada $14-15.99, Las Vegas $19.99, and Spring Mtn $22-23.99. Nevada having the shortest list of items to Spring Mtn having the longest list of items - depending on which pricing you choose, you may choose as many items on that list to your liking.

I chose the Las Vegas pricing (Nevada pricing does not offer Japchae or Bulgogi.) I ordered Japchae, Marinated Chicken, Bulgogi, and Pork Belly. Second Round something Rib Fingers, Bulgogi, Beef Brisket, and something item that slipped my mind. The portions of meat were huge considering two types of meat were on one plate. 

The service was meh (staff forgot a couple of items we asked for) which doesn't help when the menu states - parties of 5 OR LESS 15% gratuity is already included -_- poop. I guess you can't complain(maybe you can) because the staff does cook and cut the meat for you. 

Like what other YELPers say - staff in the beginning are attentive and helpful, however later on... they just aren't haha. The bill took a while to arrive that I ended up walking up to the counter and paying - bout $50 for my meal. 

You may not make this mistake (I did) so just a note, do the math for the pricing you choose - add tax(8.1%) and 15% gratuity to make sure you actually want to pay $xx.xx for this meal (since now you can't choose how much gratuity to give but can choose what pricing you'd like)

I could have lived without the Japchae and if I could, would have left just 10% to 13% gratuity.",cO-pVqt2ZKLItpeQZi5gjg,1,1,3,6T7BC7Va1QEnpZLtg7EP2A

On the weekend it gets busier but still they can easily accommodate a large crowd. Although the variety of items you can order pales in comparison to Hwaro, the meat is high quality and if you like kalbi like I do, it's worth it. The spicy octopus is fresh and packed with flavor. The japchae is delicious as well. What I don't like about this place is the service. The older lady always seems annoyed by our requests. They limit the number of items you can order at one rime, which is annoying when you have 9 people that want to order more than just 4 things. They also give you a HUGE potion of the cheaper meats like the brisket while skimp on the select cuts of meat like the short ribs. This annoyance makes the meal take longer because you can only order so much at a time. Also the service is similar to that of the DMV, mostly because even if you only have a party of two, they automatically add 18% tip to the bill. Yep the fine print on the sign at the table says parties of 5 or less there's a tip of 18% added. This is so annoying to me because the service sucks. Even if you're the only table in the place, you still have to hunt down your waitress at times. Will I be back? Probably if I'm super hungry and don't want to wait the line at Hwaro.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,1,3,CfgwfZSmQUOnV4QsQD491Q

There is two sides to the menu, Vegas Package $19.95 and Spring Mt. Package $23.95. If you come with a group be prepared to have everyone agree on the same package. They will not let you choose separate packages. 

The reason for three stars, is because their food is good and they give good amount of meat and sides. Unfortunately, their service isn't very consistent. Our server was nice, but she seem to be more attentive to the front part of the restaurant than our side. We were in the back corner.

We had to ask for our steamed egg a couple times, something we ordered when we first sat down. Maybe it wasn't her, could have been the cook in the back. But she never really came by to check on us much. She would come by to turn down our grill but we wouldn't even have time to ask her for a refill for our drinks, she would just walk away. 

Another lady came by and cooked for us. Which was nice, but she did take the tongs out of my fianc√© hands unexpectedly...which was a bit rude, didn't even ask for it nicely . They also never really came by to fill up our water or tea until we waved them down. We were checked on very Little. The restaurant wasn't really busy when we were there,  until we left. It was just a little disappointing when you see other guest getting better service than your own table.

5514844,2009-06-29,0,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,"I was w/ my Korean mother-in-law, looking to try this newly opened Korean restaurant. She heard from a friend that the place served a pretty good lunch special... she begged to differ. I know she sets the bar pretty high when it comes to Korean comfort food, she's been cooking it all her life for her family and her restaurant. So with that in mind... she was not a happy camper. There was a lot more misses than hits and I agreed... it was just subpar. 

Service: was subpar. We repeatedly asked our waters to be filled. I would understand if they were busy, but the restaurant was barely half-filled. When we asked for a little more banchan, Mr. Server only came back with a small plate of kimchii. =/ 

Food: was just okay. We ordered several lunch specials. Portions were smaller than what we had anticipated although the presentation was pretty. (See pix)

Prices: pricey. Korean food is not cheap by any means. Since prepping includes washing and rinsing and chopping and mixing and rinsing summo and squeezing... I know the drill. I've served as a prep-er under  my kimchii-mama-in-law's direction. So the amount of work that goes in every dish is crucial to making an delectable meal. The quality at Korean Garden BBQ house is lacking luster, lacking flavor, and lacking overall yumminess. I didn't see how much lunch racked up to be, but I suppose it didn't add up to the kind of lunch she didn't think was worth paying for what she did. She was saying a whole bunch of Korean words about the place I didn't understand that didn't seem forthcoming at all.

We asked the lady 5 times for SIX forks. After the second time we asked, she finally gave us THREE. Then we had to ask her another few times to finally give us the last three. Ridiculous. When we ordered our soups, there was no bowls, no serving spoon. What do you expect us to do? Share from the same bowl?

We then later asked our server to take a picture of us. She grunted and said ""I'm so busy"" [there was barely anyone there] but she ended up taking the pictures anyways ---- Then she dropped my boyfriend's phone and didn't even bother picking it up.

The brisket was fantastic. The bulgogi was delicious. And the spicy chicken was amaze-balls! I really enjoyed their side dishes too. Service was okay. The owners were there and they were really nice and hospitable! When your grill gets dirty, they replace it for you. Everything was near perfect.

The only reason why I didn't give it a full-on five star review was because the service was slow.. They didn't give us rice, tongs, and our grill was too hot. Not to mention we constantly asked for our water re-fills. So their service was what deducted a star from this review.

Walked in. Pretty basic looking, looks decent. While the menu is smaller than other places, I thought it was great that the cheapest option doesn't include seafood. We don't eat seafood, so why pay extra for dishes we weren't going to order anyway? Anywhere we go, we get brisket, pork belly and whatever is available that is marinated. Bulgogi is on the $20 menu, so we stuck with marinated pork. We also got steamed eggs which came out fast!

Service was fine. They kept the food coming and changed the grills out quickly, without us asking. At more expensive places, we've asked for various items multiple times, with the waiters forgetting. We didn't experience that at Korean Garden.

So if you are looking for the best korean BBQ in town that is easy on the budget, look no further!",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,0,0,4,fiO8dX6u_G10dJ5h5r9b4Q

The service is not the best.  While we were waiting to be seated,  the waitresses continously said excuse me and walked right in between my friends and I when there was space to go around.  Even after we moved to get out of the same spot,  they still tried cutting in between us.  

When we finally sat down and looked at the menu we chose the vegas because it sounded the most appealing.  Oh and they made their prices more expensive than last time I was here which is pretty lame. The food was good but not the best ayce in vegas. You are limited to only ordering 3 items at a time which makes the process much slower. And again with the service, we didn't get water until half way through our meal. They also ran out of rice and so we also had to wait 30 minutes for it. 

It was not worth it in the end. The price of eating here went from the $20 vegas to $26. The service was not 15% tip worthy.  They are the only place that charges automatic gratuity for parties of 5 or less for service that is not worth it. 

For $26 there are better options like honey pig or sura.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,3,2,2,WY89h6i1eupe7wbIMyDu2Q

It would be fine and all expect the gratuity charge was separated from the actual printed receipt and was just hand written on a different piece of paper. Kinda weird.",7vzosYBptYT-mLsLjoXkfw,0,0,2,BKXzOGzksFYQCMcInqmimA
