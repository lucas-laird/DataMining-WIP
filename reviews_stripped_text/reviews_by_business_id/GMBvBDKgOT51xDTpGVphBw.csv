If you have no other option and have to eat indian go ahead! Otherwise just keep away from this place. The buffet had 2 vegetable entree, 1 dal, sambhar, idly, rice and veg appetizer. I really did not like any of the food.

We had the buffet and everything was bland. Indian food is about spices, and here there was a total lack of spice in most of the food. I came in hungry, tried the tandoori chicken and the chicken curry and another chicken dish and all of them turned out to be equally bland. I did not have the courage to eat the goat curry after that. It may be just the fact that it was a weekday, but it was a disappointment.

421433,2015-05-18,2,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"Before I start my review, I would like to preface this by saying that you WILL pay extra for rice if you decide to eat here. 

I just got done eating my carryout from Bombay. DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN JALFREZIE. It literally tasted as if the cook dumped an entire container of salt into my dish. I have had Jelfrezie at many other Indian restaurants, and none of it has ever tasted like straight up sodium. 

When we placed our carry out order, the guy on the phone said no chicken pakora. When we called back to ask if they could do veggie pakora instead, we were told that they did in fact have chicken pakora, so we ordered some. When we opened the box, it was not chicken, not even veggie, but their chilly pakora. Good thing I like it spicy or I really would have been out of luck. 

I dined in here with my fiance yesterday, so I will share that experience with you as well. 

I have a gluten allergy, and the waiter was semi helpful. He definitely could have been more knowledgeable about allergies, but he knew the ingredients of pretty much everything on the menu, so I was able to figure out what I could eat with little issue. 

I had mattar paneer, and it was delicious. My fiance had chicken tikka masala, and it was ""okay, but the cubed chicken had a weird consistency."" The mango lassi is good. The basmati rice is delicious, though it does cost extra, and our bill came out to $9 in rice although we had just 2 orders of it, and on the menu it mysteriously says that rice is ""$2.50+""

I was very disapointed when my carry out order was handled so horribly and the food tasted so bad, as I had considered this place to have pretty good food when I dined in.

There are many other Indian restaurants in the area. My reccomendation: try one.",X2eg_nHO5t2BLpq2EDIJ8g,2,0,2,FHQ7pyO197MMplsvXwg02A

- The tandoori chicken was very stale and GAVE ME DIARRHEA after one bite!!!
- The lamb tikka masala and butter chicken had the exact same gravy which isn't right
- The lamb was uncooked and very hard.
- The chicken in the butter chicken was very stale with really bad quality meat. Butter chicken should have white breast meat but they had put leg etc. pieces. Seemed like very old leftover tandoori chicken pieces.

479811,2017-12-09,0,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"Dishonest and unprofessional. This is in same complex as another Indian restaurant and we ended up here by mistake. Few points about dishonesty
1. We reached at 2.30 pm. They said only buffet can be ordered, so we ordered for 3 and half. My mom doesn't eat onions/garlic and there was nothing to eat for her, so she just sat there without food.
2. When she was not eating, he comes and says, now cook is here and we can order jain food. (We could have ordered non-buffet already as buffet was closing at 3.00pm).
3. In the end, he charged for my mom's buffet as well as full charge for additional dishes. We separately ordered her nan and rice dishes for her as we were told she alone cannot eat buffet. But they charged for her dishes, they did let her eat rice etc from buffet, but charged for buffet anyways. (it was not a mistake, because they didn't correct it when asked. It was knowingly done)
4. The buffet had chutney etc, but no pakoras or samosa were finished already. No response when asked about it.
They were talking nicely and it didn't occur that cheating business was going on on the side. When I carefully looked at the detailed calculation later, we spend hell lot more than just few extra dollars. It was too late to go back and fight and felt cheated.",f138Q6cUAF3Sf58lksrLtw,0,0,1,2w9EIvuCCk14TEHwhKAC-g

The naan is soft and has the right amount of ingredients.  As of March 2015, they are undergoing some renovation - which might make seating and indoor temperature an issue for the next couple weeks. 
There's one more reason why they are my favorite: once I was there with my mom, and she required a special diet for religious reason for a certain day. And these guys, prepared special meals for her - without extra charge or cringing.

2223035,2011-06-28,2,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"As the months have passed since our last visit to Bombay (which was only days after our first visit), I have to ask, ""Why haven't we been back?""

The service at Bombay is really top-notch, and I generally find Indian restaurants to be reliable in their warm welcome and swift attention. Bombay exceeded my expectations.

We first visited because, holy moly, an Indian dinner buffet? Really? Game-changer!

Alas, that first glimpse of the dinner buffet almost sent me back out the door. Tomato soup? ""Yellow curry?"" Were they trying to court the tourist who might be more comfortable with the idea of ""buffet"" than ""Indian""? When we peeked under the dishes (almost everything was covered), nothing looked very good, or much like what you see on other Indian buffets.

But, there we were, and parking was a dream (something that keeps me away from my former fave, Tamba), and the fun of going somewhere new is my own catnip. (Plus Indian restaurants always have that clean, cold water like nowhere else. Bombay is no exception. I've asked for their filtering secret, but waiters just smile and turn away... like girls in a Don McLean song.)

We settled into a big booth and peered at the decor. Hmm, former Chinese restaurant? (Seriously, does anyone know?) I kept staring at a photo mash-up of the Las Vegas Strip and India that suggested if you exit the Venetian just right, you'll step into the Taj Mahal.

We started with samosas. With samosas I want fragrance, slight crispiness, not too much dough, and a spicy filling. Bombay satisfied me with texture and taste plus two fresh-tasting chutneys (mint and tamarind), although I could've done with a bit more fragrance. (I say that about everyone except Kamal Palace in Long Beach. They ruined me!)

On our second visit we also had paneer pakora. Fine, not too dry, fun to try once.

The list of vegetarian dishes was commendable, but I didn't see my favourite: shahi paneer. I lurve shahi paneer so much that I'm thinking of a name change. (Hey, it would only be one consonant, and it might help people finally pronounce my name right.) 

Indian foodies in the West seem to tend toward healthly eating, so I know this is so uncouth to admit, but I just adore-adore-adore a creamy sauce. Shahi paneer, aka royal paneer, is aptly named in this category.

It's not fair to dock a restaurant because they don't carry one dish. Then I'd be no better than those little kids who will only eat chicken nuggets. But, as almost every other Indian place in town (that I like) has shahi paneer, including the little place in the Riviera food court, this wasn't boding well for repeat visits. I like new things, but I also like what I like.

As long as I'm making confessions, I'm only really happy with an Indian main course if it has paneer in it. I know, I know, that's as terrible as admitting my love of shahi and makhani sauces. Don't misunderstand me, I squeal over aloo and pakora and kofta for sure, but paneer... cheese... that bar is set. Someone open a Wisconsin-Indian fusion restaurant and I will be complete.

Paneer dishes at Bombay include palak paneer (alas, the only Indian food I dislike - that's right, I hate cooked spinach - worst poster child for vegetarianism ever, I know), mutter paneer (nice, but can be bland with an overbearing amount of peas), and paneer tikka masala. I went with the last option. 

The paneer tikka masala was solid fare, as was the naan (plain and garlic) and rice, although the wording on the menu is a bit unclear over what's included. On each visit, we ended up paying separately for both naan and rice despite the words ""Served hot to eat with bread or rice"" above the list of dishes, which would imply that one is included. This is followed by the somewhat contradictory ""Add $2.00 to make entrees combo served with one Naan/ half rice order."" We asked, but I have to admit that I'm not sure what the server said, other than it sounded like this wasn't available. Hrm.

Overall, it comes back to the word ""solid."" Not ""transportive"" nor ""breathtaking,"" but also not ""iffy"" or ""meh."" Prices run a little high compared to other area Indian restaurants (Gaylord and Origin excepted) but are right on the mark if not reasonable for the Strip location. To answer my own question, I think we haven't gone back just because there are other places where I can get exactly what I want. But, with the closures of Kohinoor and Saffron - Flavors of India (not to be confused with the Eastside place), Bombay - a ""solid"" 3.5 for me - gets bumped to four stars. 

Or: 2-star buffet, 3.5-star taste, 4-star menu variety and ambience, and 5-star service and location/parking.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,6,1,4,WnbPA1Q9USzygdHFVkSF_w

2268712,2013-10-01,0,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"Been looking for a good Indian restaurant around town and decided to give Bombay a try. I went in on a weekday during lunch and asked for a menu, but was told that only the buffet was available. I didn't really want to have the buffet at first, but since I was already there I figured why not. I also noticed that I was the only non-Indian person in the restaurant and everyone was having the buffet and enjoying themselves.

The buffet was fairly small and consisted of about 8 entree items, 2 different kinds of rice, a minimal salad bar and 2 kinds of dessert. I'm not too familiar with Indian food so I am not sure what everything is called (although most had signs above it), nor did I try everything. Some of the items looked a little old (like it had been sitting in the warming tray a while), but the items I tasted were warm and tasted fine. It's worth noting that the tandoori chicken and chili chicken were pretty tasty. I was a little disappointed that they did not have chicken curry, which is what I usually order. The waiter was friendly and came by to pick up my plates each time I got up to go back to the buffet and also refilled my water when it ran low. He also brought me a basket of naan during my meal that was warm and tasted fresh.

The restaurant itself was decorated nicely, although it felt a bit warm and stuffy while I was eating. Perhaps they  need to turn on the a/c? Just a thought. Also service is slow because they only have 1 waiter during lunch, who also doubles at the host/greeter. But this really wasn't a problem until it came time for me to pay because there were only 4 tables seated while I was there. I was never brought a check, and just handed the waiter a $20 bill and asked to pay for my meal. The waiter returned with $6 in change so I assume the lunch buffet costs about $14.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,3,PwvoqjGCGteFxbfBgWqMdA

3248203,2011-02-15,3,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"What a pleasant surprise this was tonight.

My wife and I discovered the existence of Bombay, in the shadows of Wynn's ""Encore"" tower and were immediately attracted by the words ""dinner buffet"" - a rarity when it comes to Indian restaurants.

The restaurant is conveniently situated just across the street from Encore in a large complex with plenty of parking. When we went in we were immediately struck by the unusual decor, all blood reds and deep blacks, definitely a Chinese restaurant in some past incarnation. We asked to take a look at the buffet and the friendly hosts told us to go right ahead.

The buffet looked OK enough, however on this particular evening it was missing some of our key favourites so we decided to order from the menu.

At first I thought the prices were a bit high. It was understandable, I thought, given the Strip location. We ordered a serve of Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala for me and Paneer Tikka masala for my wife, with a side of basmati rice and garlic naan and plain naan.

The samosas arrived and I was surprised and pleased to see three instead of the two mentioned on the menu. They came accompanied with the usual tamarind and mint chutneys and also a marinaded vegetable chutney. I thought the tamarind was especially excellent. The samosas were very tasty and I appreciated the crispy fried texture of the crust which made for a nice change from the more doughy (but still good, just differently) crust from other restaurants. The filling was aromatic and not too dense. Just right.

When our main dishes arrived I realised the prices weren't higher after all. For an Indian restaurant these portions are huge. Yes, they still come in bowls that look small compared to what you expect to find at American restaurant, but they are deeper and wider than the standard Indian serving and for the first time in, I think, ever we actually had to get to go boxes to take our leftovers home.

Initially we both thought the food was ""OK enough"", however these dishes really improve after a couple of mouthfuls and your palate adjusts to the complexities of the seasoning. My chicken was delicious and while my wife usually prefers a Shahi Paneer (which we didn't see on the menu) she enjoyed her Paneer Tikka Masala. 

The naan was very good, I particularly liked my buttery garlic naan and the rice was a simple yet delicious accompaniment.

Our server seemed genuinely pleased at our questions about how long the restaurant has been open (apparently since November) and was delighted we'd enjoyed our meals. His demeanor made Bombay one of the least threatening most relaxing Indian meals I've ever eaten, surprising for its location.  We will definitely be back.

On our way out the door, after we were presented with a loyalty card which offers 15% discount off a future visit, our host encouraged us to ""tell our friends"", so here I am - telling my friends.

They have lunch buffets but when we got to the buffet the food looked like it had been sitting there for hours it didn't taste fresh or hot anymore.

And served with naan. We were not disappointed by the fresh made meal. So I suggest just ordering from the menu! It was delicious and were super happy we decided to stay.

I also ordered a mango lassi, and this was refreshing. 

The location is by a strip mall on the Strip and across from a church. We were immediately seated.

No buffet that night.

So call this place and ask they offering this plate and the person who answer the phone said they offer Dosa all day everyday. I was do thrilled and went with my wife to the dinner and, thinking last time we had shitty Dosa at Bollywood Grill on Sahara and Rainbow, Also Indian masala in Rivera Casino. They all made with old rotten taste vegetables in side and i couldnt even eat them with the spoiled food smell. Here i am at Bombay india Cuisine waiting.... WOW i mean big WOW!! its huge like a golden gate wrapped up and crispy and fresh smell with fresh Souses all around me. I was asking the waiter why you guys not telling people about this plate. Seriously, it was the greatest DOSA plate i ever had after long time. I mean longest time. Then my wife order Goat Biriani for her and it was as good as Dosa. We had great time.

Like a shining beacon of hope i spotted the words Bombay Indian cuisine.

The husband has this theory that Chaas/buttermilk (salted Lassi) is the answer to the mother of all hangovers and boy it works like a miracle.
This restaurant is located at las vegas blvd which is not very far from the strip, the area however is a little shady.When we walked in around 7:30 the place was pretty empty (never a good sign).We got a table for 7 people and were seated right away,the staff  didn't seem to have a care in the world and loud bollywood 90's music was playing in the backdrop.

We quickly ordered salted lassi for everyone and it arrived pretty quickly in tall fancy glasses (used to serve milkshakes in diners).Once i had a taste of that my doubts were cleared as was my splitting headache.The drink was delicious and refreshing.
We went on to order Tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, chilli chicken and chicken biriyani with some naan (Indian bread).The chili chicken was great,other dishes were just average.The portions are good and eventually the staff warmed up to us and also lowered the volume on our request (I was actually starting to enjoy the music, guess i was high on buttermilk).

Overall the food is three stars but i will give them a four for the buttermilk that saved my life literally.

4652444,2013-12-05,1,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"My parents were looking for some Indian food during our stay in Vegas and Yelp pointed us to Bombay Indian Cuisine. This place is located just past the Encore Resort on the Strip in a strip mall next to some really touristy souvenir shops. 

While not impressive from the outside, the inside was quite nice and tastefully decorated. We showed up right at 11 am, so we were the first customers.

The buffet selection isn't large (roughly 8 main items, a salad bar area, and a few appetizers) and it's a bit overpriced (~$15 per person at lunch). However, the food was quite good. I especially liked the goat curry (it's awesome that they had goat curry to begin with) and the tandoori chicken. I wish that the dishes were a little spicier, but I tend to like my food spicier than most people do. The samosas were a bit on the greasy side (even for samosas). The naan was cooked perfectly though. Overall, I was satisfied with my meal. However, this place doesn't compare to any of  the myriad of wonderful Indian restaurants in the Bay Area.

5199294,2011-04-04,4,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"Yes, they have a dinner buffet, but even for this Indian buffet devotee it was bit too pricey and not up to snuff visually. Everything was the same shade of brown, and the overall impression was that the food had been out for a decent amount of time. Plus, there were few vegetarian options. which are generally my favorite! Thus, we decided to order off the menu, which is a rare occurrence when I step into an Indian establishment.

The most impressive thing about Bombay was our server. He was impeccable. He had worked at another restaurant in town for a brief period of time, and he remembered my name and my husband's occupation. He was incredibly kind and attentive. He recommended the mixed vegetable curry and paneer tikka masala. For $2 extra you get a combo with rice and naan, which brings each entree to around $14. 

When the naan first arrived, it was clear we had been served a reheat. As soon as we said something, our server whisked it away and soon returned with hot from the oven, fresh naan. The new naan was good. As for the entrees, the tikka masala was definitely the stand out. I would order it again. However, the mixed vegetable curry reminded me of a Haldiram boxed meal. These meals aren't bad, but when I eat out, I expect a bit more. Some of the vegetables were canned, and the curry flavor didn't seem unique. 

On an interesting side note, if you're looking for big, black leather booths (this seems to be a common Vegas request), they have them here. Of course, the fluorescent lighting and Indian fare probably aren't really vintage Vegas.

5516445,2012-04-15,0,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"Oh, my goodness- I've never eaten at two restaurants on the same day before, but I did today!  My evening meal was at Bombay Indian Cuisine, which sits in a plaza in the shadow of the Encore, and very close to a wedding chapel or two. 

Immediately upon entering the restaurant I was hit with a lovely aroma of deliciousness- it was fabulous. It was about 6 pm on a Saturday and there were only one or two other occupied tables.

The space is nothing special- no carpeting, no ""atmospheric"" lighting. There are two dining areas that look exactly the same: hard, black wooden chairs (not the most comfortable, but serviceable) with bench seating on the wall side. The bench seats were topped with high, shiny, black, tufted backs.  I liked the lighting they used over the tables, except that until our meal was served, our fixture was blinking with almost a seizure-inducing regularity. I'm glad it stopped or I would not have been able to eat at that table.

The food was deeeeelicious.  We started with the chicken pakora, which actually wasn't anything special as far as seasonings, but was sufficiently enjoyable.  

I got rice and naan to accompany my entree: the lamb tikka masala. I don't know why  I chose lamb- I just didn't want chicken or paneer.  The entree was a very attractive deep orange/bright red color, and was both rich and satisfying (photo has been uploaded). I could have done without the meat altogether and just sopped up the sauce with the naan, it was so good.

I must say that I was surprised that they gave us burnt naan. Had it ALL been burned I would have sent it back, but only the top layer of pieces came out that way. I didn't mind that some of it was crispy/crackery, but I preferred the warm, soft pieces underneath (and I'm not a fan of charred bread!)

The Bombay masala tea didn't taste very ""Bombay masala"" to me, but it was refreshing. It could have been Nestea or Lipton, for all I know. On a hot day I would have really enjoyed it, but the restaurant was cold enough that I kept my jacket on the whole time.

The service was great- the servers were very polite and unobtrusive, and made sure we were well attended throughout our visit.  They didn't give us a hard time when we presented a restaurant.com coupon, which I appreciated.

Waste of money with disappointing staff behavior as well.Never recommend to anyone.
Nothing good to write about.

Forced to give 1 star as we don't have choice to give 0 stars.",Z48jh7HpXduIKpESTYa_yQ,1,0,1,jtDofGrsb030BJtDyqMOqg
5840120,2015-02-14,0,GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw,"For a local to drive to the Strip on a Friday night to try Bombay Indian Cuisine one would think not. However, the restaurant is conveniently located off I15/Spring Mountain Drive near The Wynn and, most importantly, the food was delicious!!  

My daughter and I  started with chicken samosas, lamb and chicken kabobs and onion bhajis.  The chicken samosas were well balanced with flavor, and not doughy.  The kabobs were moist and flavorful - I liked the lamb the best.  Onion bhajis were yummy, I just added some mango chutney for some heat.  

For my main course I ordered the chicken tikka masala and the mutter paneer, both of which I would definitely order again.  Each was nicely balanced with flavor, and portion.  

This was my sixteen year old daughter's first experience with Indian food and she was to go back and try more menu items.  I agree.",YfJQQyu9-gjyFe-nEDwfHw,0,0,5,CW9lN7DAt2wJLjpg5-qDqg
