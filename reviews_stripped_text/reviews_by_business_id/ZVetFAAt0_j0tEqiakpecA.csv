234756,2016-12-16,0,ZVetFAAt0_j0tEqiakpecA,I enjoyed the food and the service I received was fast. The food was hot and delicious. Most of the others who have rated don't seem to understand this is fast food not a five star restaurant and I feel they have been unfair to this location.,CveyY6Osgb3Md9gqyI1nYg,1,1,5,_V54f07P1W4Ww5iRh9ZORg

578552,2017-03-12,0,ZVetFAAt0_j0tEqiakpecA,"If I could, I wouldn't give this restaurant any stars. This location is the slowest place I have ever visited. 
Upon arrival, the cashier made us wait nearly ten minutes before taking our order because she's pulling double duty: cashier for the front of the house and cashier for the drive thru. Once our order is taken, the cashier now cooks our food. Seriously! Add on an additional ten minutes. Now our ""fast food order"" has taken twenty minutes and counting. Thankfully my baby is sleeping and not screaming because honestly, this defeats the purpose of eating at a fast food restaurant!  What truly pushed me over the edge was once I received my order, I was missing food so I brought it to the cashier's attention. She tells me that I didn't order the combo. I told her that I wasn't going to argue because I was hungry and I didn't want to wait any longer for something I had ordered. 
 This was the biggest waste of time. Do not come here if you value your time.",FrrEv2F1h54NCao1oRb6mg,0,0,1,rMboL-FFYGgvuXb_bHQ7oQ
686136,2014-07-14,0,ZVetFAAt0_j0tEqiakpecA,So this one time i ordered tacos fries and cookies. I pick up my order and go home. Next thing you know out of the blue my cookies weren't there! I freaked out and called them just to them laughing at me complaining about my cookies. They also gave me a free cheesecake (so nice of them) but I'm allergic to dairy:( Overall not to shabby,WLNFB4fCExo6VVXHaBKB4Q,0,0,3,Q22dV2hkosJ8gR8VYz4Eqg
843662,2017-09-17,0,ZVetFAAt0_j0tEqiakpecA,"I come to this Jack in the box fairly often because it's the closest to my home and as a college student I don't have a lot of time to cook, so I usually get the same order, home style ranch chicken club meal with no bacon, or h'angry chicken hash with no buffalo and wakey bakery hash with no bacon. This time however, when I ordered the latter meal, the girl told us she couldn't take off the bacon, and instead she took off all the cheese. We said it was okay because she told us they were putting the bacon into the sauce, we were clearly confused and thought best to ask once we got to the window. Once we got there, we asked how we should order it next time so there wouldn't be any issues since I most likely would come back again in a day or two. She went on an explanation as to how they make the dish, saying all the cheeses and sauces are added and then they put the bacon, when we pointed it out that she had said the bacon was added later her eyes opened as big as saucers and she said it was in the sauce again. Then they went to charge us for cheese that was suppose to have been on the hash... until finally they told us they were just gonna give it to us free, most likely to finally be rid of us. A second after I got the bag I checked and they had spilt the cheese on the bag , we just left because I wasn't about to continue this conversation. I guess it's time I change my location or fast food restaurant, there are some only a minute away form this location.",F_G1_-ngoK2Jlc0NlC1ZTw,0,0,2,zDU6kSDGtujXjJ05KZYRhQ

1540233,2017-04-30,0,ZVetFAAt0_j0tEqiakpecA,I spent $30 for a sloppy made order. Worst Jack I've ever visited. No napkins. Food looked like it was smashed. Waist of $$$.,SemEACVPuUoE02qSvOJkBg,0,0,1,3bHoAt7XIOCAtu2OTSpMHg

Then I got to the fries.... yeah you could've just kept those for yourself. No one should be subjected to that crap you call fries. Just eww. Did I mention that it was awful?

When I arrived at my destination I realize that items are still missing. I'm very disappointed at the fact that they had to fix my order one time and the second time it was still incorrect.",k8gIuQHuUYdfy4iUWGw7Eg,0,0,1,3QL98ByeKsmsp2L6VlJS5Q

3684280,2018-06-16,0,ZVetFAAt0_j0tEqiakpecA,Me and my girlfriend were just sitting down enjoying a meal. The manager rudely came out screaming and cussing because someone had taken her phone. Then she started accusing me and all the other customers. She wouldn't call the police to have our bag search or anything since we had done nothing but just wouldn't stop complaining about it. My girlfriend went to the counter and ask the guy for a receipt so we could get a review as well as the manager's name. He said give him one minute and never came up. We gave him about 5 minutes then I went to the front. The manager came back and asked me what I needed. I told her we just wanted to talk to the other guy and she said she could help me. I said no you can't let me talk to him she said Okay one minute. It's been about 10 more minutes and he still has not showed his face. This is pathetic service! Go figure a lady who works for a company that robs the welfare system by under paying their employees every day calling me a thief!,aaHxdvkxUybuunz3Es5s4g,0,0,1,9kPRtI5kr8kCN2Kxng42Nw
