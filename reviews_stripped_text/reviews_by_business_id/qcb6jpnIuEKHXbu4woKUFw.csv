And then before preparing my sandwich I had to ask him to change his gloves for sanitary purposes since he had been using the same gloves to eat his food. He was offended by my request and he complained and tole me, ""they don't have any large size gloves, and it's hard for him to wear medium size gloves."" Finally after he changed gloves and made my sandwich I told him to make my order ""to go"" and instead he charged me as ""dine in"" which is extra money with tax verse getting it ""to go."" I'm never coming back to this store again! I was very I unsatisfied with the cleanliness of this store even the spinach on my Sandwich was old looking.

I am fluent in Spanish but I choose not to speak it at times when I'm ordering since it's a little more complicated for me. Although they continued talking to me in Spanish and were very rude. They kept rolling their eyes every time you asked for something else, it's their job to do so! She even coughed on my food which completely killed my appetite! I still chose not to be rude and ate in the facility but as I was i don't think one of the ladies knew I was eating in the dining area and started ranting about me being so needy in Spanish! This place is a joke! I felt disgusted my whole visit! I never wanted to give a place a no star but this would absolutely go on that list!! Don't come here at all!!!",ClTYJcrwUY8VKDs1rGv_pw,1,0,1,pglF8sPVTlEqgC8q2F_6VQ

Came here today for lunch.
Immediately the lady at the front had an attitude with us.
I decided not to order after she said: are you going to order or not.
I took my business to Panda Express.
My classmate still got a sandwich.
She proceeded to treat the guy behind us very nicely.
It was a little weird.
After my classmate ate most of her sandwich she noticed that the chicken was pink on the inside!
Like wtf are the standards at this place?
Never again unless you want undercooked chicken.",HQUx_q8IhSrJX3GPdUvO_g,3,0,1,ZcECY2r8zn3wtOHNJzzGNg
3031901,2016-05-22,2,qcb6jpnIuEKHXbu4woKUFw,"This is a review based on service, since we never were able to get food. We came this morning after a night out... It was about 3:30 A.M. We approached the door and rang the bell. At first we thought it was just taking a while... So we rang it again... And continued to wait... We saw some one in the back by the sink. She continued to ignore us. I figured... She must not of heard the bell. I rang it again. It wasn't until she waved us away... That I realized we were being ignored. We were dressed casual, but nice. We weren't hammered... Or acting crazy. We always go to this subway... We've never had a problem. I can honestly say... We will never go back. We will gladly bring our business down the street to the subway in Boulder station.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,5,2,1,64WqMxW-RmHF_fjijRHqMA
4656708,2015-02-16,0,qcb6jpnIuEKHXbu4woKUFw,I come to this place often because it's right down the road from my house. It's also 24 hours and there's never a line. I usually go for the late night munchies. It's always the same young kid. Pretty cool guy. I would recommend the place.,kBlma2kzCdtKXOzO4xhKFA,0,0,5,-blkrUrOb5iPAl4vvLzgyg

In addition, the quality of the lettuce bin was concerning due to the brown pieces and they tend to be more scant on the toppings compared to other Subways.",AXrouzqDq0yTGObjHuMAdQ,0,0,2,m7TNWGcd_-YRIkn2-XFTTA
5436011,2017-05-14,0,qcb6jpnIuEKHXbu4woKUFw,"I am a huge fan of Subway, and I have been to this location many times before. However, I have never had such a rude employee. I went in there with my boyfriend to get dinner at 8:30pm. I work graveyard so this is a normal time for us. I will point out now that both employees had no name badges. I start to make my order and the lady gave me an attitude as if she couldn't hear me, I brushed it off, then I repeat myself, she grabs the bread and snaps ""what meat?"" I repeat saying ""spicy Italian please."" ""What cheese?"" More attiude, ""Swiss for the wheat, pepperjack for the italian herb."" She throws the cheese on the bread, not even made just a pile of cheese, grabs the meat and doesn't even give us a lot of meat. Brush it off, she snaps if we want it toasted or not, his yes, mine no. Here's where it gets worse, I start telling her what I wanted, attitude after attitude, now is where I NEVER have had a problem at ANY SUBWAY. I wanted extra olives. Like, a lot of olives, I'm even willing to pay for it. She barely gives me any, then when I ask for more, like, a lot more, ""I can't give you more, it's a footlong."" My boyfriend says ""really? We come here all the time and we have never have had that problem."" She puts on a few more, and I mean a pinch more."" I am trying to stay calm because she gave an attitude to him as well. I become tempted to walk out, but I am starving. He finishes his and he is having issues as well. We pay, we leave. I get home and find hair in my sandwich. Not mine, I have long black hair, boyfriend has short black hair, this was short and grey, like the ladies who ""helped"" us. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Horrible service, food looked disgusting, wasn't even chilled properly. Just gross.",rCN79u0_GPYSYIGndNPMvw,0,0,1,5j0h70pLxLxyO3nGMRbwAg
5950009,2016-11-19,0,qcb6jpnIuEKHXbu4woKUFw,If you don't no Spanish you're basically screwed. I couldn't understand an effing thing from these people. They had such a thick Spanish accent I had to of said what 20 times and they got everything wrong starting over twice completely. They couldn't understand me nor them. I'll never go to that place again.,SEjXquVnM0_2w1sr25RcKg,0,0,1,FtVChukWgRM6M1N_fUCuMQ
