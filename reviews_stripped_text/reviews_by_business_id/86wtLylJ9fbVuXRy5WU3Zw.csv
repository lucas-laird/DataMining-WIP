Friendly encounter with owner Frank he took his time to introduce all the items...
1) they use all organic and while some places use corn flour and misc others I'm allergic to ..they stick to Oat flour and organic coconut sugar 
2) those GF items are on the green shelves 
3) still tons of selections on GF sections - I can't wait try their whole cakes
4) I had key lime cheesecake..oh so yummy, it's vegan so it's creatively crafted with different ingredients to taste and feel like cheesecake - success 
5) they also do coffee and smoothies to come soon ..

Came here at 6:00 and at first i thought it was closed but ti turns out that they were open from 10;00 to 8:00. so don't be fooled by the sign on the door. Everything looked good, bought a vanilla caramel cupcake, the red velvet cupcake, and the chocolate cupcake. We also bought a chocolate cake pop with coconut sprinkles on the bottom. The cupcakes were dense, however they were very flavorful. I enjoyed the rich dark chocolate flavor in the chocolate frosting of the cake pop and cupcake It was so delicious and i highly recommend it for dark chocolate lovers. The vanilla caramel cupcake was also very good, i enjoyed the vanilla frosting and caramel drizzle on top, the cupcake wasn't very sweet, but the frosting was so it balanced out. I was also surprised to find a nice caramel filling in the cupcake. And the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake, OMG! i loved these cupcakes, i know i will buy a birthday cake from this store in the future when it's my birthday.I can't wait to visit this bakery again.

( I go once a week)

3 weeks ago I went in to get some Carmel Corn and they were out of the regular white paper bags it usually comes in. So I got it in the plastic bag , but noticed the amount was a tad bit smaller.

2 week ago I went in and noticed the same thing , there was a little less .

This week my husband went in and came home with my pop corn .. OMG the bag was SO SMALL it would of covered just the bottom of the white bag and FOR the. SAME PRICE and even worse it tasted STALE.

I was also disppointed because the ONLY cookies I like are the oatmeal ones and for 3 weeks they have been out.

We spend quite a bit of money in there for vegan treats , because I am vegam and picky what I eat.

But if this is how it is going to be there , I will be finding another place to go.

1443969,2017-07-17,0,86wtLylJ9fbVuXRy5WU3Zw,"This place is mouthwatering! Usually vegan bakery items don't taste as well as regular bakery items, but Vegan Bites is an exception. I came to Vegan Bites because I was going to a dinner and one of my friends is completely allergic to dairy. I decided to give this vegan bakery a shot and I wasn't disappointed. 

Recommendation: Buy the coupon which is $15 for $25 worth of items. 

With the coupon, I was able to buy a dozen of truffles and 8 of the mini cupcakes. All of the items were decorated so beautifully, especially the cupcakes! They had many bakery items from cake pops to baklava. Vegan Bites is very accommodating, not only do they have vegan items but they also have a large range of gluten free items! 

Truffles: 5/5 
I got a dozen truffles for $11.99 and I got a various combination of Coconut, Cacao, and Oreo. Each truffle is made with coconut oil and other natural ingredients, but it still manages to taste like a normal truffle. My favorite was the Oreo! You can taste a little bit of the coconut oil, but it's still delicious!

Cookies: 3/5
Although the cookies looked delicious and were only $1, I didn't really care for the taste. They were okay, but I've definitely tasted better vegan cookies. 

Cupcakes: N/A
I did buy the mini cupcakes the dinner I was going to, but I didn't get to try any. The cupcakes were $11.99 for 8 mini cupcakes and they were meticulously decorated. They have many flavors including red velvet, carrot cake, cinnamon, chocolate, and vanilla. 

Staff: 5/5

I have tried some store bought products in the past that were pretty good (cookies and such) and was hoping this bakery would give me a pleasant experience with more options. It did.

 I decided to try the oatmeal pecan cookie, coconut truffle, and the almond truffle. 

The  cookie was huge, moist and delicious. I asked the lady what was in it and she said pecans and oatmeal. However, she neglected to mention the golden raisins. I like raisins but admittedly there were too many for my taste. I ended up picking half of them out. In total I had about 30 raisins and maybe 1 whole pecan. My suggestion is they add a few more pecans.

I still enjoyed the cookie and if you like raisins you will too!

Now for the truffles, they were awesome. 5 out of 5 stars. They were moist and super fudgy. A definite must try item!",6YxoXqSs79DGz0U9hgx_Ow,2,1,5,3cUdXHyfFfoxlDORsjgh4g

1976640,2015-08-20,9,86wtLylJ9fbVuXRy5WU3Zw,"Maybe mid-week is not the time to go. Although service was friendly, stock seemed limited: mostly cupcakes and (dry-looking) cookies during my visit, with only a single flavor cake pop available. I've had some incredible vegan desserts in my time, would consider their protein bars on a future visit.

Quality is fair, but only a place I'd recommend if your diet requires you to see out vegan or gluten-free options. Cake pop was rolled in granola, which was fun... but outer layer was hard to bite through, and interior flavor was incredibly moist, but in that dense, straight-chocolate way that I associate more with a fudge than a cake.

Bonus points for offering a Yelp deal; $15 for $30! Some of the prices are a bit steep, which is to be expected for a specialty bake shop: cupcakes and cake pops both just under $4, mini-cookies 75cents/each. 

I also appreciate that coffee is available, saving me an additional stop. Note that they offer brownie edges by the register, for all you freaks who don't understand that the middle, gooey center is the best part!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,11,3,4LF1D9-2kAkOugW5DhW-vQ

2029934,2017-09-22,2,86wtLylJ9fbVuXRy5WU3Zw,"I absolutely adore this place. 

I found them last year, around this time, while searching for a birthday cake that my co-worker could eat and enjoy without fear of bodily retaliation. I was excited to find VeganBites - allergy-free, vegan, gluten-free, AND organic. I ordered a 10"" round double layer chocolate cake and requested it be gluten-free.. 

The cake was a hit in the office. Even a couple co-workers who, to that point, made every effort to avoid and discredit the taste and validity of anything gluten-free or vegan, devoured their slices. You can taste the quality of ingredients, too. I knew then that, at the very least, I'd be back again for my coworker's next birthday. 

Fast forward to now and custom birthday cake for the co-worker #2...

Remembering her love of peanut butter cups, I sent an email inquiring whether or not a ""PB cup""-inspired cake was possible. I forgot that peanuts are not allergy-friendly. However, the team offered an almond butter alternative. They took the time to outline options and provide feedback that would get as close as possible to the end goal. At the end of the day, my co-worker chose the oreo crumble flavor from the regular menu. I placed the order online and included a note that someone else from the office would pick up the cake. Everything was so easy. I can't say enough how much I appreciated the team's responsiveness, patience, and willingness to help. 

As expected, this year's cake - this time, with gluten - was again a hit. 

My only complaint is that I live on the other side of town. But that's a ME problem. YOU? You should pay this place a visit.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,4,3,5,OmrOAjSjamhDjdeW357W5g

The loaf wasn't  good, and as for the cupcakes -half were delicious  and the other half were kind of hard/old tasting. Frosting was a bit gritty. Not amazing by any means.

We decided to try the yo-yo's which is cream between 2 cookies and a topping.  We tried 4 different ones which we all shared.  They were good, but I personally would have been more than happy just having the cookies as the cream was a little sweet for me.

However, 5 stars all the way because the cookies were soft, moist, delicious and you would never know they are both vegan and gluten free.

If you can't do it then that's totally fine but I'm more disappointed in the customer service she came out very rude and unresponsive on the phone (long awkward silent pauses) when ask why she couldn't do it and what other options there was besides an extra $10 charge . I didn't receive no apologies either. It doesn't make sense to me that a 9 inch cake can't not support words saying happy birthday and other decorations . She could have at least reasoned with me and did one decoration of a paw print where their was open space available on the cake surface . Furthermore, being a vegan options are some what limited in food places and I love supporting any local vegan places out there but if customer service is lacking, it's not worth going to .

They insisted that we take the rest of the loaf that they had (about half a loaf) whilst only paying for 1 or 2 pieces. We tried to refuse and failed. The owner explained that this bread is difficult to get right as it is gluten free and chocolate and apparently those two characteristics don't play well together. Overall, a pleasant experience. I've been going to Vegan Bites for a long time and I must admit, we stopped going for awhile as the quality deteriorated (I believe this was under previous owners but I'm not certain).

Since I had never been here I just opted to get a couple of cupcakes & some other random baked goods just to try things out. They were having a 2 for 1 special on brownies (sweet!) so I got 2 walnut brownies & a chocolate chip cookie just cuz.

For the cupcakes I got red velvet & oreo. Both were yummy but I liked the sponge for the oreo best. Loved the frosting! Brownies were yummy, a little harder then I'd like but still tasty. That's mostly a personal preference & not a diss to the brownies lol, I just prefer them a little softer. Cookie was perfection!!!

I might have gotten them on the wrong foot with my homemade desserts made with dates, dates, and more dates. Glad to find a bakery that is in complete alignment with my values, and tastes better than my homemade treats. My kiddos are glad too!

Everything is absolutely delicious.  Just the right amount of sweetness and amazing texture (even with the gluten free options!).

The brownie was good...not to die for omg, this is heaven...but good. In fact, I wouldn't even guess it was a vegan brownie.

I will take the rest home and see how the family rates the goodies...

Update: Kids loved the goodies.  DH said cupcakes were too crumbly, but ""alright."" The cookie and banana bread was also alright according to DH.

4352995,2015-07-15,0,86wtLylJ9fbVuXRy5WU3Zw,"So after my review lamenting dry cupcakes, the owner contacted me asking for a second chance as seen below.  I was offered a free cupcake and a refund, so I finally made my way back.  The store manager was in and she was so nice! She knew who I was, and my name before I even said it .

So she didn't give me 1 free cupcake....she gave me 5! One of each of their non gluten free selection.  She said they had just been finished two hours ago,  and they were red velvet, chocolate, vanilla, carrot cake, and coconut. After filling up my cupcake container, she then was like, do you want cookies to? She gave me their chocolate chip cookie and their walnut fudge brownie. Then she was even was going to give me a refund still. I told her no need, she gave me so much already.

So I headed home with my hoard of baked goods.  Now after waiting about an hour they were still pretty cold from refrigeration and a bit dense but not necessarily dry, so after giving an initial taste test, I wrapped up the container in a plastic bag and let them sit over night.  This proved to help greatly, waiting at least until the reached fully room temp, it melted the coconut topping a bit, but it helped make the texture great on all the cakes....except the vanilla that was still very dry.  I did appreciate no raisens in the carrot cake though ! Also the texture of the coconut was great in that it was filled with coconut pieces. It was my favorite.

Now the icing on everything was a bit sweeter than I prefer still, especially the vanilla.  However the texture was nice and creamy.  I hope as they are open longer they get more creative with fillings and flavor profiles, maybe add some fresher components like a refreshing fruit compote or curd in the center to add acid and counteract the sweetness....and just lessen the sugar except in the chocolate that seemed to be a good sweetness level.  I know they do have what seems to be a cupcake of the week, which was the coconut in this time around.  While it was my favorite, it and everything could use an extra punch to set them apart and really make the flavors sing.  

Now the brownie was hands down awesome! No need to alter anything, it truly was a fudgy peice of happiness.  The cookie was decent, almost brownie like as well, I could taste they use coconut oil.   Not sure if the intent is for it to be in the flavor, but over all I liked it.  Neither of these tasted overly sweet either.

So basically customer service 5, cake base 4.5, icing 4, originality 2.5, baked goods 4.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,0,1,4,1_c8DBr2Pp-PdkqC1Jo38Q

The truffles are AMAZING.  I wish id ordered more of these! (I got the almond truffle)

The apple puff pastry pie was also AMAZING!!!  

The chocolate coins were good as well.

Now for the bad:  The ""cheesecake"" I tried was very disappointing.  I tried both the strawberry and the Keylime and didn't finish either of them...they were very salty for some reason and just didn't resemble cheesecake at all.  I know cheesecake is not the easiest thing to make vegan but it can be done. Veganbites does not seem to have it down though.   I don't like leaving bad reviews but I feel like anyone who orders this expecting cheesecake is going to be extremely disappointed.  I know I was.  

All in all I will return because they do have some really good product.   My advice to them would be to pull the cheesecakes from the menu until they can perfect the recipe or at the very minimum re-name them because they taste nothing like cheesecake.  I say this with nothing but good intentions, because I want to see them succeed, and I don't want anyone else to walk away dissapointed like I did.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but either way I was shocked that anyone could actually put those out to sell...they simply weren't edible to me.

If you are going to get coffee here they carry dairy creamers that the non-vegan staff have no clue aren't vegan. They will tell you that all the creamers there are 100% vegan, non dairy creamers because they are clueless. When I made the owner aware of the situation he not only was the most condescending jerk I have ever talked to, He said, and I quote, ""as a customer you should investigate any and all places that you choose to shop if 100% vegan compliance is important to you."" I think that if you are entering a vegan establishment you shouldn't have to investigate. It should simply be vegan.  And shouldn't 100% vegan compliance be important to a vegan establishment? If you can't trust that the coffee is vegan or not I wouldn't touch anything from the kitchen. They obviously have no clue what is important to vegans. They would rather cater to the surrounding businesses than to the vegan customer base. another quote from him, ""Although we aim to please every customer and value your opinion. In the spirit of giving all customers the option to choose the type of creamer they like in there coffee, we chose to carry dairy creamer. Many customers in the surrounding businesses have asked for this choice"" I feel those customers that want dairy creamer should go to mad house coffee right across the street if they want dairy, But if they are going to a vegan establishment they should espect VEGAN.

I will love to come back and try your cakes next. Thank you for your delicious treats!",T1XUUXIEU5uj3NmdWAdIlA,2,1,4,1aZnEr4CR9iwf33nbJQOoA

Baklava was great, cookie was extremely dry and customer service left plenty to be desired.  

Prices seem average.  Would be curious to try one of the cakes still, but they don't seem to care much about return business.",8Bo4V4xh1F3ix4AbolZBnw,1,0,3,zPK_jX9e1_3boNdpH54rAA

I have friends who are, and I wanted to make sure that they had something sweet to eat at my wedding reception.

I chose this place based on its Yelp reviews, and I stopped in two weeks ago to find something to serve.  They had a double chocolate chip cookie that was ENORMOUS, and I bought one of those to try. 

It. Was. Delicious.  

So I called last week, and ordered a dozen.  

When I picked up, we tried one of their brownies with walnuts:  to die for!!!  

Service was great, and super nice.  They made the whole process so easy!!

The cookies were a huge hit, and I had NONE left to take home.  

Excellent job, Veganbites!  Thank you so much for helping to take care of my guests!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,7,5,O7t2QzDvh0jgZ1ZavLe6gA

We have never tried vegan pastries before but we will definitely try them again. The cake was great!  The chocolate brownie without wheat was also great.

They also serve coffee and you can custom order cakes. All vegan! Amazing for people with food allergies. The lady who served us was very friendly and greeted us right away, she was delightful the whole time.
 The cookies and cake pops were very moist and delicious. The popcorn was a little stale but the flavor of the cheese was still great so it didn't take away from the awesomeness of a vegan being able to have cheesy popcorn. My mother in law visited a few days later and she is not vegan and tried the truffles and claimed they are the best she has ever had and shared them with everyone she could find!

It was my first time and I wasn't sure if I'd like it so I only got a slice, but I wish I'd gotten an entire loaf instead.

It was a double layer marble cake with chocolate butter cream filling and lavender with white roses all over the cake. OMG the taste was smoothing lightly sweet taste.

For my co-worker's birthday, I ordered a 9 inch single layer chocolate cake with oreos, bak lava (has honey), and  truffles (almond, coconut, cacao, and oreo).  They misspelled my coworker's name (not faulting them too much...his name is unique) and were able to re-do the the top of the cake in a few minutes. 

I wasn't sure how my non-vegan co-workers were going to feel about the treats, but they all loved it and said the cake tasted better than other cakes.",aZTs40ElMahNIDFhgXLzNw,2,2,5,8Mot0aFKDpg3CuskQoWoEw
5751021,2018-01-02,4,86wtLylJ9fbVuXRy5WU3Zw,"This little gem has me totally enamored with their delicious vegan, gluten-free treats. The entire menu is vegan (aside from the baklava, which is made with honey and clearly labeled as such), and nearly everything can be made gluten-free. There truly is something for everyone; there are cookies, cupcakes, cheesecakes, pies, cake bites, and more.

I have been quite a few times and find myself repeatedly ordering the red velvet cupcake with ""sundae"" topping: frosting topped with rainbow sprinkles, chocolate syrup, and a maraschino cherry, a.k.a. pure happiness. I also am a huge fan of the ""yo-yo"": two cookies with frosting sandwiched between, and coated with your choice of rainbow sprinkles, Oreos, or nuts. 

If you're fortunate enough to drop in around Thanksgiving, Vegan Bites has the most amazing pumpkin pie. Seriously, their heavenly pies will totally make your holiday season complete. In addition, there also is an option to pre-order apple or pecan pie. 

I could go on and on about the amazingness of Vegan Bites, but instead, I highly suggest you try it yourself; you will not be disappointed!",rJvKwSkbrHphPUK66Fw86A,9,12,5,7o8Qy9fYOPcyCshAp9S2cA

1) wheat-free and gluten-free recipes.
2) organic. Let me say this again, ORGANIC! Ok, I was shouting with glee.
3) homemade almond butter here and used in the recipes. 

What I happily discovered:
*Free coffee days
*Almond butter cookies are a great texture and delicious 
*Friendly staff, thank you Courtney
*Fresh from the oven. We boxed up a fresh batch of cookies and a glazed lemon blueberry cake loaf 
*Check-in and there's a Yelp coupon for a discount on a cake

I could have gotten a nicer cake at a grocery store. 

THEN when I called. I was able to talk to one of the workers just fine, then when the worker handed the phone over to the  owner/manager. She pretended that she couldn't hear me over the phone. 

Finally, she calls me back and says that they can't use fondant and that the designs have to be hand piped.  There's still 0 excuse for it looking the way it does using any technique. 

If you screw up, own up to it, fix it. Stop making excuses.
