The staff I've encountered is courteous, helpful, and respectful from the person taking my order, to the delivery girls and guys!  The website was user friendly as well. Dody is fabulous and funny (you had me laughing on the phone girl), Anthony is kind, respectful, and professional, and Alex is very helpful going above and beyond. Hey Papa John's, give Dody Anthony, and Alex a raise!!

BTW, I have zero affiliation with Papa John's. I don't usually write reviews (you can see this is only my 2nd review). This is an honest review of my experience. When I came to Yelp to write the review, I was shocked at all the negative comments.

1572786,2015-07-27,0,9pTewioF128zRmHKAYGYDQ,"I'm a big fan of Papa John's pizza, but this place has made so many countless mistakes that I just had to write a review. Yes, countless mistakes. The first was when we moved into our new apartment a year ago. We were tired from moving and just wanted pizza. So I picked them up from the store and took them home only to notice they got one of the toppings wrong. It wasn't a big deal or anything major, so I let it slide. 

The next mistake was a few months later. We again were craving pizza and my fiancé was at home while I was at work. She ordered pizza online and accidentally put pick up instead of delivery (I had the car and she couldn't go out). When she tried calling to change it they said they couldn't change it once it was in the system. That's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard. They wouldn't even let her cancel the order. So I had to take my break and work to pick up the pizza and bring it home. My fiancé  made a complaint online and one of the general manager's responded back and told her they would mail her a voucher for a free pizza in order to rectify the situation. We thought that was pretty nice of them. Things, however, only got worse.

A few weeks later when I wanted to use the voucher the manager or a higher level employee at the location looked at it and said ""How do I know this is authentic?"". Mind you, it had the GM signature on it. My response wasn't a kind one, something along the lines of ""Why the hell would I bring in a fake SIGNED voucher for some pizza?"". He eventually gave me the pizza after asking me 21 questions about where I got it and if it was real. It really pissed me off.

Then a few months later, I was at a client's home. The family had ordered pizza from this location and the delivery driver had the wrong pizzas. The order was completely wrong as the driver asked for a higher price than the one states on the phone. That was that.

I haven't been here since last fall and I'm hoping the place is a lot better. But honestly, this is one of the worse pizza places in terms of customer service. Don't get me wrong, some of the employees there are absolutely pleasant, helpful and nice to talk to while you wait for your food. But there's definitely enough bad apples and mistakes made to take away from what the good employees do for you. Look for another pizza place.",77Fn_IVf2_DhqK9LaXRvsw,1,0,1,TgVZdMw7puvypfnwoPWjYg

It is fine if they were busy, but professional restaurants should greet their customers as they walk through their front door, or at least acknowledge their customers and let them know that they ""will be right with them.""  When they are no longer busy, they need to apologize to each customer for the wait.  It was like we were invisible. 

One young lady was at the front of the store, but kept on going with her personal conversation on her cell phone even with customers (4 of us total) waiting in the front.

Have had a couple issues in the past with online ordering and picking up, problems with credit card verification on their end and incorrect orders etc, ... but nothing to stop me from going.

UNTIL

With my most recent online delivery order I made a pizza half and half, only to notice that something was confusing with their summary.  I called to verify, and they confirmed my order.  However when it showed, half was incorrect.  I called to have another sent and Heather told me that there would be one on the way. Within 5 mins I received a call from the manager (can't remember her name).  I figured it would be to go over things, however without any hesitation she instructed me to have the pizza ready to switch out saying that she would not have the other pizza delivered otherwise.  At first I agreed to this strange request, but then after a seconds thought told her I found it strange that with their mistake I would have to wait an additional 30 mins just to switch it out. She blamed recent issues with people wanting free pizza, and I didn't see how this applied to my situation when it was their mistake. She then said to only put back the half that was incorrect, but at this point I was over it.

Seriously? How can a place deliver the wrong pizza on a very casual night, when the order is placed at 5pm?

Originally I scheduled the order for 6:45 but realized that that was the dinner rush and the likelihood of my pies being ready in time was slim so I called in to move it to 8:30 to make it easier and more likely to be ready as this was a time sensitive event. I go and pick up the pizza at 8:15 and I'm assuming this person who was the manager looks at me dumbfounded and states that the pizza was just delivered. 

I inform her that it was a carry out order. She just stares at me so I ask again...""Soooo,  are we going to call them back..because it was for carry out?"" She then starts to blame me saying ""Well you put it in as delivery.."" I proceed to show her the confirmation for carry out then she shifts the blame from me to ""the internet company who puts in the orders"" all the while taking no ownership of the fact that it is now 8:30 pm and I still have no pizzas.

Are you kidding me, it's a fast food pizza!  No thanks papa johns, your competitors down the street are just fine!  Ridiculous!",3w6Gaq-SiVJwr7BOSRcu9A,0,0,1,zbGvORfBPHRKzNOqTXg1yA

I guess you can't get attitude from the manager when you order online, but I've never had an excessive wait and no mistaken orders.  I guess I must be lucky.  Also, PJ's is the ONLY chain that actually puts extra sauce on a pizza if you request it.  Overall, this place is fine.",aq7PsU-EerT2gSPsBc_FCw,0,0,4,kDONUaCwefLzmgumosEd8A

I love the fact that they have the free pizza offers and that you get points with your order that can me redeemed for a free pizza.  Plus in my book. If I can save some money and feed the family I'm happy. 

This visit we ordered online and picked it up. Did the usual 2 pizzas...gotta have leftovers :). We got a large cheese pizza...easy peasy. It was good. The 2nd was the works with green peppers. I was told it was good as well. No complaints about the pizza. I decided I wanted a salad, they offered papa John salad for $4 or 2 for $5.50 so I opted for the 2. When I went and picked it up I saw the salad was the kind you buy at the grocery store. No biggie, I took it. When I ate it (didnt even eat half of it) the lettuce was limp and gross...just didn't taste fresh. What can I expect from a packaged salad. I def. won't be getting it again.",0N4Pu81o_EsB-GHw0mLUCw,0,0,3,Ws42WBc-DbbGEvRBam9JCg
5131035,2016-12-29,0,9pTewioF128zRmHKAYGYDQ,We have been having great experiences with them until recently. One of the main problems is that I always ask for extra garlic sauce and the past 4x the pizza has been delivered with no garlic sauce. It's seriously my favorite part of eating papa John's pizza. Also my order has been wrong with different toppings a few times and the delivery driver didn't care. Im starting to think I don't want to order from here anymore which is a shame because we usually order a pizza once a week.,4XfdRdy0umATT-LBBtkszA,0,0,2,MZujIqT-55oxOc4OkD4q7g
5595259,2017-07-09,0,9pTewioF128zRmHKAYGYDQ,"Their tag line, "" better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's"", should be changed to "" better pizza, horrible service where the manager hangs up on you, Papa John's""! I was sent an email with a special discount. I followed the link and ordered a pizza for delivery. Like I've done a dozen times before. I'm sure they drivers remember me, I tip well. The promised time of 19-29 minutes seemed great. Ordered at 7:23pm. At 8:20 pm I called to ask about my food. I was placed on hold immediately. 4-5 minutes. The girl finally picked up and I asked about my dinner, gave my name and address.. she seemed confused. She said the address they had for my order was next door to them and they cancelled it. I asked ""why didn't you call me? you have my number."" She couldn't answer, but said she would get a manager. The manager, no name offered, came to the phone after a solid 4 minutes. (This call is now 10 minutes long). In a nut shell he said they thought it was a prank call and cancelled it.  I gave him my address, name and even offered my customer number from the web order. He didn't care. He was equally silent when I asked why didn't he call me to confirm the address? He responded with blaming me for the mix up and HANGING UP ON ME! No apologies,no offer to correct the error. He just hung up. This is not the first time I've had issues with this store. It will be the last. There are 3 other pizza places in the immediate area, they now get my business and money. Good bye Papa.",cMYJyZhkNsNCR0TyWdjl3A,0,0,1,DU0r7ZTkuW2YNcv-dE77PA
5774927,2015-04-04,1,9pTewioF128zRmHKAYGYDQ,"I would give this location zero stars, if it was indeed an option. I order my pizza via telephone, and was told the total. My family arrived and was told they are not accepting $100 dollar bills unless the order total was within $20 of the change due. This is not posted ANYWHERE in the restaurant and was told there was nothing they would do to help me..

The professionalism is at the bottom of the bucket, not one employee is wearing a name badge. The male employee making the pizza dough at the front of the restaurant has long hair that isn't in a hair net or tied up.. Employees are ordered around by the manager in a disrespectful fashion, with little regard to customers being in the restaurant.

I will be making a formal complaint with the local health district and Papa Johns Corporations.

We will discontinue patronizing this business.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,3,1,1,ez2Y_NpmAcx5TuhywpLf4Q
