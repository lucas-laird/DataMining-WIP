52273,2016-10-30,0,UbjXRe-Ku_MWpX27vtIEFw,"Ordered from this location 2 days ago for delivery. We got 2 of the pasta bowls, a medium pizza, a sandwich and a brownie cookie thing. When we got our order, the pizza box was crushed and everything inside was mashed. So I called and asked for it to be remade and sent out. They did, no argument. When they got to my door, I gave them the destroyed pizza so they knew I wasnt trying to get free food, but they said to keep it. (It was tossed out anyway because all the toppings where stuck to the top of the box and the soggy cradboard was peeling into the pizza).

Anyway, point of the story is that my friend got horrible food poisoning and was puking all night. She was still feeling terrible the next day and didnt eat anything. I've never seen her in so much pain. Like she was dry heaving at one point because there was nothing left in her stomach. Her stomach was not happy, not at all.

I personally didn't get food poisoning, but I didn't have any of the pizza, or brownie cookie or her chicken pasta bowl. So one of those 3 items got her sick. I had the other pasta bowl and sandwich. I just hope it wasn't the remade pizza that got her sick because that is beyond wrong to do to someone on purpose. 

Needless to say, there was no left over pizza day. I tossed out everything out the next morning just to be safe. I've ordered from here a few times. This was the first time I've asked for anything to be remade and the first occurrence of food poisoning. Coincidence? You decide.",HYFfp2c5YaWXIBcxuKTz2A,0,0,1,I5nV-mpobL4T-31iNuDgAg
166964,2014-04-08,0,UbjXRe-Ku_MWpX27vtIEFw,Disgusted. My first and last time ordering from this dominos. I ordered HOT wings and got REGULAR soggy fatty wings. I could have probably saved money by making my own or throwing some frozen hot wings in the oven from the frozen section of the grocery store. My pizza which was thin and crispy looked like a card board burnt disc. Sad this what I ordered to feed my son for lunch. Never again.

Pizza is hard to screw up, because even overcooked is really extra crispy lol, so I don't mind. Unless my pizza is charcoal, or missing ingredients, I'm happy.

Dominos is pretty consistent with their pizza.  We ordered 2 medium 2 topping pizzas $5.99 each and then $9.99 for 14 wings.  Bill came to $26 so I am guessing there was a delivery fee which I failed to check. 

Pizza #1 - Thin crust, extra bbq sauce, chicken and pineapple.  It was perfect.  I wish I had some right now.

Pizza #2 - regular crust, extra Robust tomato sauce with jalepenos and pineapple.  It was pretty good though I preferred the other.

Wings - Spicy and ""slimy"".  I don't know what it is with these places.  Seems I have only had non-slimy wings from our friends at BWW. Hm.  (anyways grilled them up and they were better)

All in all this is Dominos-nothing real special -just the usual chain place pizza. Nothin too crazay.... its just a ""quick lets order some fast pizza cuz I don't want to cook right now"" place.",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,4,2,3,tiKSQ_T_iQ6BRrHfCJp_Hg

The kid standing next to you took my order ... she said yeah we can't find it what would you like we can reorder and the wait will be Another 15 minutes and I'll throw something in for free. I said how about you pick what you want to give me for free because at this point I'm no longer hungry . I asked for my receipt because I later head a guy say he paid 7.99 for a large pizza ? The girl at the register couldn't find it ... I pulled up my bank app on my phone and showed her how much I was charged and let her know I wasn't given anything for free!!!

When the pizza arrived in under thirty minutes, I asked the delivery guy if they still had the 30 minutes or less policy.  He said they did not.....impressive!

Pur order consisted of a tasty two topper.  Everything tasted fresh and the crust was seasoned and not tasting like cardboard as I had previously remembered.

Dominio's has this thing they do with the chicken bites where they throw some toppings on them.  I ordered the tomato and bacon.  They were were delicious.
