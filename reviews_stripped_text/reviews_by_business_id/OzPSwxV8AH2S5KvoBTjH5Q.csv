58924,2016-08-06,0,OzPSwxV8AH2S5KvoBTjH5Q,"This place is absolutely the worst. I must admit, I have given it WAY too many chances... only for the fact that I love tropical smoothie, and it's the only one in my neighborhood. 

Most of the people who work here look like they have either just got out of jail, or need help for a meth addiction. Which could explain the circus of shit that I hear on the speaker, and the fact that they are so RUDE and unprofessional. I pull up to the speaker today, and there is a woman laughing. She had me repeat my order 3 times, and she said it back to me.. Still laughing. I pull up to the window and a girl opens the window, and doesn't say anything... So I said, can you give me a total?!?! She said, what did you want to order? You've got to be kidding me. I said, didn't I just order and say it 3 times and you repeated me? She had a blank look on her face, like this was her first human interaction, or she was so high out of her mind she couldn't function. When they FINALLY handed me my order, it was a different woman. Her hands were so dirty, and her nails were chipped with old black polish.. It looked like she just spent all day changing oil. Needless to say I won't be eating the food I ordered, because I have no idea if these nasty people are wearing gloves. So there's 12 dollars wasted. 

Like I said this wasn't my first experience with this location, and it is my fault for going back. 

The other times I've tried to eat here, there seems to always be a problem with the speaker. It's so frustrating... The people are always so rude. They are ALWAYS out of something. You can never read the menu sign.  

Has the health inspector been here recently? I don't think the people working here would pass inspection. Who is hiring these junkies?",TXrUoqGq9GC6WpLRrekOGw,0,0,1,XN8steoZcPENysoZKbQTdw
212731,2016-04-25,1,OzPSwxV8AH2S5KvoBTjH5Q,"2nd time being here, I pull up to the drive through speaker and no one is there after about 3 mins I pull up to the window and continue waiting, I was about to leave when the same man from last time opens the window saying he was in the bathroom... I order my drink and after w little while I get it. As in driving home I notice there are things in the drink that are hard and not chewable. I thought maybe they were seeds or something but when I got home I inspected the pieces and I found a little part that was not anything that was supposed to be in the drink it was a little purple shard of something, felt like little rocks when I was drinking my smoothie... It was somewhat sharp too. 


Not the best... Customer service is poor... Our order was not done the way we asked. We got two smoothies unsweetened and when we got them they were both sweetened... We went back and when we told the guy over the speaker he just said ok. The smoothie was done right the 2nd time, but it is irritating having to drive back.",r4sY-L0PSxG5i379gzqCbQ,2,1,2,Z39ZdI1PdA3xObQJHGaLRQ

I felt bad for the employee because she had to apologize multiple times for the items she didn't have.

1412225,2015-08-18,2,OzPSwxV8AH2S5KvoBTjH5Q,"Almost passed this location up. Their new logo makes it look like a generic Tropical Smoothie but I guess the entire company is rebranding.  This must be a new location because I couldn't find this one to check in on Yelp. 

I pulled up to the ""24 hour"" drive thru since I didn't want to walk the kids in.  After repeating ""Pear'ific Green Tea"" 4 times (she couldn't understand me), she asked me to pull up to the window to continue ordering. I asked if there's a menu at the window for us to look at while we are ordering. No response, so I pulled up to the window as requested. She said ""I couldn't understand you through the drive thru. What did you want to order?""  I repeated ""Pear'ific Green Tea with no sweetener or turbenado.""  I asked for a menu for the kids to review.  She left the window and came back with the catering menu.  I'm losing patience at this point as it's definitely more troublesome experience than if I had just walked in. She leaves the window again, so I decided to just go in to the restaurant. 

The experience inside wasn't much better. The menu is all the way up against the back wall but the ordering counter is about 20' from that wall and there's a partition in the line of sight from the ordering counter. Strange setup. The kids couldn't read the menu from the counter so they walked over to the bar where the menu is more visible (however awkwardly far from the cashier). What made it even worse was that while ordering at the counter, the cashier was ringing us in at the drive thru window. Lol. It was just such an awkward experience. Maybe it was because she was the only employee there so she had her drawer setup at the window to accommodate the drive thru?

After we finally got our smoothie orders in, I added on a spinach salad. She asked me if I wanted the small or the large. I told her the large as all 3 of us were going to share it as a side to our dinner. I asked her for the dressing on the side since we were going to accompany it with our dinner at home. She replied ""all of the toppings are in separate containers on the side.""  Perfect!  HOWEVER, when I got home and opened my salad, the bed of spinach was under all of the containers of toppings (yes the containers are placed IN the salad), and the toppings took up about 3/4 of the box. Large salad?  This was not even close to enough for all of us to share even as a side. There was maybe about 6 oz of spinach in the box, some turkey bacon that had a weird taste (almost tasted like fish, if that makes any sense at all) and the peaches on the salad are from a can with syrup. Ick. Not even in the slight bit satisfied. What a waste of money.  I used to order salads from Tropical Smoothie all of the time. They were huge and delicious.  This was definitely not THAT...

The cashier wasn't as friendly as the staff at other locations, however she wasn't rude either. She was just there to take my order and then make it. 

We did get a good deal on our smoothies because we ordered during their ""happy hour"" so it was buy 2 get 1 free AND because it was Sunday I got a free supplement added to my smoothie. That was probably the only positive to the experience. 

Overall (and unfortunately), this location failed to deliver what I expect of this brand.",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,2,0,2,K022jFxFQjryXatouRULLQ

There was even a Sysco delivery driver with a huge food delivery who was on able to get a hold of anybody. The corporate phone number on the website was continuously busy.

How many people have MOT chosen to eat there because of this? Completely inconvenient and a waste of time for a mediocre meal at best.,HrzV84db7_s60_hjzCB7TQ,0,0,1,GibP4Mxk4lE2j6OH5N3QgA

3847165,2018-06-23,0,OzPSwxV8AH2S5KvoBTjH5Q,"Lesson learnt: I should ALWAYS read reviews/tips on here first and not just fly by somewhere on a whim because yesterday was one of the worst experiences I've had at a business where it took me 8.5 HOURS to make an order, not receive it and finally get a refund! If you have 5mins and want to laugh at my expense, I'll explain..

My partner and I had a small window of time (about 15-20 mins) before I had to drive him to work and our stomachs were rumbling, so the plan was to order a sandwich and a shake each and eat it on the way to dropping him off.
We bumped into TS and went inside to order. Greeted by a lovely lady who turned out to be the manager and took our order. Unfortunately the first smoothie I ordered, they didn't have the ingredients for, so I found something else and that was that.
About 5mins into waiting for our breakfast, the manager got an important call and had to leave. It wasn't until that time, when there was another customer waiting to be served, that she told her that 2 people had already called out that day, she had to go too and they were extremely short staffed with only 1 person left to serve the restaurant, deal with drive thru and make all the orders. Had we been told that this was the case when WE ordered, we would've known service would be very slow and would have opted to go elsewhere as our time was limited.

Nearly 20mins into our wait, we still had received nothing and had to go. We asked the guy (still the only server) if our order was nearly ready and he said he was ""just doing it now"" and said it'd be a further 10 mins. We told him we were sorry we couldn't wait any longer and had to leave with just a refund. We needed to leave so promptly that I said I'd come past again on the way back from dropping my partner to work for the refund, which he said was fine.

Cut to 30mins later. I'm back again for that refund and am glad to see that a second server has just turned up to help. He seems a bit confused at the thought of performing refunds, so I'm waiting a further 10mins while he calls his manager. He comes back to tell me he can't do it. He needs a managers key and the manager won't be back for a few hours. So a 2nd wasted journey here in the space of 1 hour!
He tells me not to worry, the manager would get my refund back to me. When I asked him how, he didn't seem to know and when I asked ""So if a customer needs a refund in the next few hrs you'll have to tell them 'too bad'?!"" The response was just ""yyyep"".
I was pretty shocked at the incapability and disorganisation of this business but had no choice but to come back later when I was assured a manager would be around at 7pm.

Cut to 7pm. I'm back. Just 1 server in the whole place AGAIN so I wait.. again! 

Guess what? He's not a manager and can't refund. Are you kidding me?!!

As I'm about to get massively frustrated at this poor server who has no idea of my morning with his colleagues, a manager walks in, clearly on a whim from their reactions. HOORAY anyway though.

After ANOTHER 15mins of this manager seemingly confused, pacing back and forth and not being able to pull up my order, I FINALLY GET A REFUND and run out of there. NEVER to return!

From reviews of this place, problems have been: lack of ingredients, lack of staff and very slow service, all of which I experienced today. It seems that TS have a good team of workers who just can't do their jobs properly due to poor management and massive disorganisation.

I will be avoiding this place from now on and can only recommend you do the same, if not, GOOD LUCK!!",Xsyw11gZiltqWL5RvWGKJg,0,1,1,m5d_3jdKP268sd7X6EtS1A
