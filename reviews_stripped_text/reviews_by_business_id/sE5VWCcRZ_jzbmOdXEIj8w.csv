So I made a call to make sure that they would put me in a room that is nowhere near the construction and they accommodated me! Everything is brand new in this place, The View two outside the food Guest Services everything was perfect... I will come back to this hotel, because by then all construction will be complete and will not have to worry about that disturbance... bye anniversary was great thanks to the Monte Carlo hotel resort casino!",xR0x15GUTC3gkyYWbjDQHA,0,0,5,Z71Pt8av-gRpkUAEz-LZdw

Everything in most casinos in Vegas are sky rocket high prices, but the Montecarlo was higher than every casino we went to. The Starsucks coffee shop line was twenty two minutes long and they ended up combining my wife and my drink into one. So of course I had to wait another ten minutes for them to correct this error.  Kinda like meh at this point. When we asked for help or directions we were always pawned off to another venue. The price was cheaper than other hotels and I see now why. Other than that, it wasn't too bad.",jjhDCkBqLyTlGJsyn1sjwA,0,0,3,89RUY80ruyWgQs4o28hilA

Our flight was cancelled so we stayed an additional two days! Good place to be stranded I think! Very beautiful hotel and casino! They are doing more construction so watch for that! Didn't bother us at all!,YouthXlMakq8Z5DtWQHKyQ,0,0,5,4WkJA8qXM0ZAwPacuMgdHw
3100899,2017-11-30,0,sE5VWCcRZ_jzbmOdXEIj8w,Ever again just horrible. No food areas in the casino to go eat had a 30 food and beverage credit that I could not use because there's no places. On top of the they tried to charge another 10 for over night parking when I was in the valet. It was not what I was expecting,U-vL6jZvu67yB2pPwm_Zsg,1,0,1,DEkxQxe2xMLqz5juqP6Vzw

I literally woke up at 5am to the sound of construction.... what a horrible way to wake up,.... at that point we switched rooms ...so careful if u are staying here, make sure the room u are staying in does not have current construction going on as they are currently remodelling ... we did however get comped the room and one of the managers was very helpful in accommodating our issue...his name was Octavian I believe...thank u for all ur help!!",HigAvW7FYl0gnKkk2wRlzA,3,1,3,RCT1JrUuk6JVaIwShTjy7g

I am being charged a resort fee of 35.00 a day, but if I want to use the pool, I have to take a shuttle to another one of their hotels. The pool at this location was removed. The management staff was less than helpful and really didn't care about how my reservations where poorly handled. Beware of this hotel, just use their other properties.

5243970,2018-02-18,0,sE5VWCcRZ_jzbmOdXEIj8w,"This hotel should have stayed closed during their remodeling, only two restaurants were operational and were tough to get into. Many things were not working properly, no phone, TV broken, no room service. Not MGM quality and really does not fit into their other properties. I've stayed at better Motels than this place. They charge for a resort fee and there is no resort! Their staff really tries to overcome all of this, but it's literally a train wreck. When it finally becomes the Park MGM hope it improves but as an M life member, I'll stay somewhere else next time. One other thing is if there is an event at the T-Mobile arena, go park somewhere for awhile as you won't be able to get into the property. Oh forgot to add when doing the Automatic checkout, that even had a computer glitch. My suggestion is wait a year before staying here.",Mj5_0pZxhVL0BBnrz2oTKA,1,0,2,9cODLL31lqL43Imy8L-JLg
5409485,2018-02-18,0,sE5VWCcRZ_jzbmOdXEIj8w,"Hotel under remodeling right now and through May 2018 when it re opens as the new Park MGM. The entire place looks horrible right now. No choice in shops or restaurants. No foot traffic. Starting here is no different than staying at a holiday inn. 

I was extremely disappointed that when I booked this room for 3 nights, no where on the website did it warm me about the inconvenience of construction, meaning: looks disastrous on the front facing the strip, nothing to direct you wheee to park. With the business of the strip, it took close to an hour to find the entrance to self parking due to all of the closures. 

My room smells old and musty. The furniture is old as if it has been thrown together to get by until the new furniture arrives. The carpet is dirty and disgusting. I refuse to walk without shoes. But the worst I would say is the lack of amenities and the fact that I felt deceit when no mentioned was made  of its current state when I visited the hotel website.

5790065,2016-01-23,0,sE5VWCcRZ_jzbmOdXEIj8w,"This hotel/casino food court is one of the better ones in regards to variety and the hours. We recently visited while on vacation and loved the choices of food that we were able to get. We stayed at the Cosmopolitan, but wanted to get a quick bite to eat where it wasn't so crowded, but where we could stay out of the elements as well. We took the Crystals Tram to Monte Carlo/Aria where we ended up at this food court. It's not very far from the tram stop, which is great. No far miles of walking.

The food selections here include: 
Starbucks, McDonald's, Manchu Wok, Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill, Sbarro, Subway and Original Chicken Tender.

The Subway and McDonald's are open 24-hours a day. 

We did make a stop at the McDonald's as well as the Subway when we frequented here twice. Those eateries will get their own individual review.

We found the food court to be rather clean, not smoky at all from the nearby casino, which was actually great. We could eat without smelling smoke. Many tables and chairs to choose from as well.

Overall, a great food court that we would probably go back to again to try the different food options.",7nEnXfmm3ICIJtGtFAMMuQ,1,1,3,uuIlB9VrmO0wGR2hz5aPlQ

They are dirty, worn and run down.  I've stayed here three different times in the last 6 months.  Never again until they fix the rooms.  Disgusting stains on the carpet and the desk chair.  The carpet in the hallways is torn, badly stained and rumpled. Truly unbelievable. It's such a shame as this is an MGM property. You'd think they'd care.",CKX385oaC4rTpklIxR9BFw,1,0,2,D-MqHZ_V9VsUG6_FMUgqdA
