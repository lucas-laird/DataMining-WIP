The location is very convenient if you are on Fremont Street (The Old Strip) partying with friends, going to First Friday, or touring. It's very small so if you go when its busy, you might have to wait awhile but for the most part, the food was very worth its price (cheap for large portion nachos and drinks).",UKHs5O6rJOTLKFH1cozFSA,0,0,4,87HoaqsBe9x-MFNdTh4h1Q

The hostess finally came by and said she'd send a server over. We waited another 15 minutes and no one showed up. We finally decided to move back to the bar since we knew at least the bartender was working and could put in an order. Apparently prep work was more important than paying customers, because one of our party overheard her tell the barback she was too busy to take our order.  One hour of waiting later, we walked out.

All the hostess were sweet and nice and everything was good up until my friends' orders came out so I waited for my order which never came. Our server was busy waiting a large group that came in after us, which was understandable but time kept going and the table needed refills and my friends' were basically done eating their huge plates of food before we were able to flag down our server about what happened to my order. A huge platter of tacos went to that table he was helping. He said he'll let us know and then goes over to the big party. Basically takes care of that big party the whole time. He walks by and says it'll be out soon. It's been well over 40 minutes for two tacos with rice and beans by that time. My friends are stuffed and done with their food and I had to go, it's close to an hour now. So I flagged the waiter down and just politely asked if we could just cancel my order. He tells me it's literally done but we've been sitting there and everyone in my party is sitting there done while he's been serving that one large party. I  needed to leave so I just told him it's ok I'd rather not take it because I wouldn't be able to eat it or keep it on me. I'm not one to take home food either if I didn't buy food for the whole family. He comes back and inquires about why I don't wanna take it home so I tell him I have things to do and I don't wanna eat all of this in front of my family and he replies with ""so you don't eat in front of your family?"" Which was pretty rude so I told him well I'm not gonna sit there and have them watch me eat and not have bought food for everyone? I've waited so long for this food and literally everyone was finished and we had to move on. The place was not even busy. Plus I don't understand why a small order was suddenly done when I wanted to cancel it and he's being rude to me about it. Oddly enough after getting us our check he apologizes and says it's all his fault. But it's insincere because just a minute ago he didn't understand how I wouldn't want to take the food with me when there could be a number of reasons why and it's no ones business. I would've been fine if he just canceled it but having to explain myself and having his comments just really made a bad experience.",XtHLD11D1qvqPmUTDGclhA,2,0,1,wE_USmPO-wNxRE1xrLRQzA

They brought up a booster seat but we both decided a high chair was better.. they seated us at the end which was a great choice for our crazy toddler.
Lots to choose from , great portion sizes .. 2 people could share 1 plate of nachos because they pile it high.
Our waitress was super laid back she was so awesome in making sure we had everything we needed .. even the food runner accommodated us by getting us an extra side of chicken from the kitchen at it wasn't even his table.

Javony is one of those people.  As we walked in, it was hard to miss his presence in the room. He was teaching an impromptu salsa class to a bachelorette party while chatting up a nearby table of WWII Purple Heart veterans, impressing them with his deep knowledge of twentieth century post-war geopolitics. At the same time he was calmly performing the heimlich on an over excited frat boy. All smiles, casually exuding Bill Clinton levels of charisma, Javony welcomed us to Nacho Daddy. 

The conversation zigged and zagged between unconscious bias, the Syrian refugee crisis, Chinese calligraphy, and his recent paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. His fresh take on tired issues reinvigorated my views and forced me to question everything I knew. The hours flew by - as I felt the conflicts between mind, soul, and body melt away in his calming presence. 

Javony would never say this himself but following his double stint in the peace corps (Malawi and Haiti) he donated both kidneys (and two thirds of his liver) to a baby panda.

Having passively made millions in Silicon Valley selling his car safety algorithm to Tesla (saving millions of future lives), Jovany decided that with all options ahead of him and no need to work a day in his life, he would help people from all over the world find their true selves. What better place to do that than Nacho Daddy Las Vegas - the veritable crossroads of human civilization (try the queso it's like making out with Buddha Jesus and Moses at the same time).

I can only hope you, too, can share even a moment, a glance, a thought, a smile, or a margarita with Jovany at Nacho Daddy - a professional human being.",MGBPp03TSc_p3NUYue0_9A,0,0,5,kzuut-n9vvNypBttaxeVjA

My review is more based on the service and perception.

Experience: We walked in and there are four hostess One with her back towards the entrance. They turn and look at us but did not say anything. Finally, one of the girls in the back turns to my kid and asked how many? Our server seemed to be rushing us to order drinks and order off the menu not giving us any time to look. We ordered our drinks and our food. I tell him I have a free house margarita for the Yelp check-in. He brings it over and All you can taste is the syrup, grossest margarita ever with no alcohol. I checked and made sure their house margarita had alcohol, I only took one sip and my jaw hurt. Tried mixing it and it still gross that i gave up. 

Food: We ordered the shrimp spicy nachos with spinach chips, chicken enchilada nachos, and the cheese quesadilla. The food was maybe a 3.5 to 4 star quality. 

Prices are good and location is good too, it's away from the strip maybe about a block away so it's not as busy and also not that far. 

Overall I would not return and would not recommend. Also, next time I'll listen to yelp when it says something suspicious about the five-star reviews.",sidtCSJUGHPwtkXZ8BLzUg,2,0,2,eZyCbMtwXqjLONMvKWelSQ

The free margarita you get for checking in was way better than I expected. We went twice during our 4 day trip. The first time, we got the buffalo chicken nachos and the spicy shrimp nachos. I opted out of the spinach chips (the bf is a picky eater) and got regular chips. I wish I would've tasted the spinach ones though. 

Second time we got the buffalo chhicken again (the white queso is yummy) and the tostada nachos. I think out of the four, the tostada nachos are the largest. Two orders were enough to share for sure.

Chips are fresh, simple and bottomless.  The lobster and crab enchiladas are flavorful and surprisingly the rice that comes with the combo is delicious.  Four cheese nachos also simple and great for cheese lovers.  The street tacos are good; however, the meat itself is slightly dry. 

Overall a great experience.  I recommend this and I don't do reviews often.  Definitely one of my go to places when I'm in Vegas.

The filet was cooked juicy, and not dried out.

My wife my stepson and I walked into a restaurant and while it was busy it didn't seem packed.  We were told it was a 25 minute wait.  The wait was accurate and we were sat by a very friendly hostess.  There was a pretty good delay between being sat and being greeted but once we were greeted our server was friendly and attentive.  We did not order any appetizers but I had three different margaritas.  I had the house (nacho daddy), the pineapple mint and a blueberry margarita I saw on a previous review but was told wasn't available but they made one for me.  My favorite was the house margarita.  Their sweet and sour mix was quite good.  For dinner I had the not your average burger nachos.  They were very good.  I added sour cream, but it was the ground beef, bacon and lettuce mix on top that really did it for me.  My son had the filet fajitas.  He destroyed them.  My wife had the burrito.  It was ok, it was a burrito.  Nothing really stood out about it.  The restrooms were tidy and this place has a great YELP check in incentive.

1346916,2017-02-08,1,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"My fiancé and I dined here on our most recent trip to Las Vegas.  We had been drinking for quite sometime and I needed some sustenance.  This place had some great reviews so we decided to check it out. 
It is located on the far South corner of the MGM Grand.  Location is kind of weird.  I thought we were going to end up at the Tropicana.  We had to go out of the building to enter.  We arrived right as Happy Hour was getting started and they had some very reasonable prices for food anywhere, but Happy Hour made it an even better deal.
They have a scorpion tank when you enter, which freaked me out, but the man thought it was cool.  Because we were there early, it was not loud or crowded, but I imagine if it were a different time of day it could be very loud and very crowded and it is a good size restaurant with lots of wide open space.  
I checked in on Yelp and got a free house margarita.  The man ordered a house margarita on Happy Hour.  Margarita was solid for a house/happy hour special.  
You do have to pay for the chips and salsa, but they are minimally priced and unlimited.  They have both a hot and mild sauce that they will bring to you.  They were good.  
For food we ordered the pork tacos which I really loved.  The man liked them less so.  It isn't that he didn't like them, but he likes, ""American tacos"" with their hard shells, lettuce, tomato and sour cream .  These were pork tacos with hot sauce and queso fresca  He didn't like the soft flour tortilla (It's more authentic!).  He didn't like that the hot sauce was chilled and the pork was hot.  Essentially, everything I loved about it, he didn't care for.  I thought the sizzling hot pork with the chilled hot sauce was a gorgeous blend of hot and cold.  The queso fresca was awesome and they had limes that you could squeeze over the tacos to add that bit of acidity. We apparently just have very different tastes in tacos.  
I really enjoyed the food here.  If you want authentic, hole in the wall Taqueria,  go to Tacos El Gordo, but if you want good food in a casual atmosphere with reasonable prices then this a solid bet.  I would come back.",9Y1ljNsHeK-FpJ3SAYFC4w,3,2,4,Tp-we9cjnUhC3VRvO-YY0Q

Since it was Tuesday they had a great Tacos Tuesday deal. Tacos were dirt cheap and full of meat. They were probably some of the meatiest tacos ever. You could easily share an order or just eat the meat. The tacos don't come with too many extras, so they're a little plain. We also ordered the filet mignon nachos. Those things were bomb! Huge chunks of meat as well. 


Service was excellent. Our bartender was very entertaining and knowledgeable about all the dishes and drinks. We also scored a house margarita courtesy of the yelp check in offer. I was a bit skeptical at first because the yelp page had a consumer alert warning for multiple positive reviews from same IP address but it was Tuesday and I wanted tacos. 

I wouldn't bring the kiddos here. Cool spot to have date night or hang with some friends. Happy eating/drinking!",5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,24,18,5,sHLVilfCscOeogQW51vF3w

First off the temp was really warm and she immediately fixed it for us.  Then she took the time to recommend what margarita to pick.  She even went and got a sample for us (we decided on the blood orange margarita and it was fantastic).  Then we wanted to split a nacho and she was super helpful in explaining all the menu items.  We decided on the BBQ chicken nachos and the pulled pork chimichanga and let me say she was on point with her recommendations.

He didn't write anything down, so when I changed my mind on salad dressing, he went ahead and brought the one I originally asked about, and when our bill came he went ahead and charged us for the margaritas despite both of us checking in for the free ones.  I understand everyone has a bad day, but I mean, did he have to mess up *everything* we requested? It's all good though, because he was having fun which means we werent upset.

Note, this review is not biased because of that, however I should note that I went here twice within a few days and the free house margarita was honored both times.  The second time was with a group of 10, and we easily had $100 of strong and good margaritas on the house.

Our servers were Ryan and Judy (across two visits), and they were both extremely friendly, attentive, and had very poignant recommendations.  I followed Judy's recommendation to get the shrimp and steak fajitas and was extremely pleased.  A very good spread of toppings, a generous serving of meat and choice of flour or corn tortillas.

We ordered bottomless chips and salsa for the table, and there was never a dry bowl or empty basket for our 10 person party.  We never had to ask for more chips or salsa, it just kept coming.  As far as I know, everyone enjoyed their meal.

We did, oddly enough it was a Friday night around 8pm and the place was pretty empty. A few tables here and there but you can tell this place was really designed to be packed and loud.  Glad it wasn't.

We started with margaritas, and I got the spicy cucumber margarita.  Boy oh boy.  I do love me some cucumber water, and I like spicy things, so those elements combined with a margarita and good booze?  Heck yea.  It was just ever so slightly too sweet, but I would get it again 10/10 times.  Just a little less sugar.

This place is obviously all about the nachos.  Though they have a TON of other options, lobster tacos, enchiladas, burritos, etc.  Obviously, I went for the nachos.

But with SO many to choose from how do you pick?  I could have gone for the classic guac and sour cream, or the extravagant loaded with this and that, but instead opted for Sloppy Joe nachos!  Yea.  Who doesn't love sloppy joes???  And nachos??  Right!?  So yea, this was a cool idea, and I had to try it.  Glad I did.  The sloppy joes were good, and the chips held up under the strain of seasoned and sauced ground beef, cheese, and the like.  I would be interested to try some other combos next time.

I think what I would do next time is have everyone order different nachos and then share them family style so you can try a bunch of them.  As it is the servings are large and I could not finish mine.  So a good ratio would be one nacho order per two people I think.

Everyone else complained that their drinks were all overly sweet and some chose not to finish drinking them at all.  Too bad.  The goblets they come serve in are large and about $14 each so seems a shame.  I would have asked for something else, or it to be remade less sweet.  But just a heads up if you tend to not like sweet drinks (I don't blame you).  I tried one and it was way too sweet.  I still stand by my spicy cucumber margarita as my top choice.

The service was good, and the place was nice.  
Like I said YMMV but we got there at a good time on a good night and had fun.
I don't know that I'd come back, as there are so many choices around Vegas, and I think this is a chain, so I'd avoid it maybe for that reason as well.  But if a group made the choice to go here, I know I would be able to find something I liked, no question.",uih53bykBGPNn3Lv09ofkA,4,3,4,4-e717McMsaXDuPFDLOYgQ

After running 13.1 miles we figured this would be the perfect place to sit down and celebrate. We had a group of 5 and we waited no more than 5 minutes for a table. Our waiter came out and got us our drinks quickly which was nice. 

The atmosphere is very laid back. The TV's inside the restaurant were playing mainly rap music videos which my party really enjoyed. 

The food was amazing. We ordered the bottomless chips and salsa and didnt have to wait too long to get refills on chips. We also got the trio sampler which came with some of the best queso I've ever eaten. One of my friends ordered the nachos to share and my mind was blown by how huge the nachos were. They definitely don't skimp out on the food here. 

Overall the service was about average. Towards the end of our stay our waiter got busy and didn't visit us as often and we had to try and find her to get our checks.

FOOD: Started with the dip trio. Salsa was spicy & flavorful, but not mouth burning. The guac was delicious! It was chunky & you could taste the onion and garlic. The cheese was zesty with jalapeños, but again not overpowering. I had the chicken chimichanga. I take my chimis bery seriously. Many places claim to have a fried shell but do not OR dont offer the fried shell. Well isnt that a burrito then? This chimi was large in size and had a perfectly fried shell! The chicken inside was flavored very well which mixed masterfully with the guac on top. One negative: there were also beans & the way mine was rolled it seemed like the right half was chicken & the left half was beans instead of being a great combo of each in every bite.

SERVICE: id have to agree with prior reviews & say it was disappointing. Our waitress greeted us with her depressing story about how shed rather be home in bed. Not what anyone wants to chat about before dinner. Perhaps some customer service lessons for the crew are in order.

$5 Margaritas and small plates during happy hour!!

Our server, I believe her name is Judy, was very honest and helpful with recommendations.  For example, she recommended items that were not only delicious (we ended up ordering most of them), but they weren't the most expensive items on the menu either. I found that important because there are so many servers at other restaurants whose recommendations aren't actually that tasty, but just happen to be the most expensive item. Or, all the items they recommend are really expensive, which I find they're just bs-ing for a bigger tip. 

Anyway, Judy was attentive, honest about the food, friendly, and polite!  My husband and I shared the filet mignon shrimp combo fajitas (so damn good!) and despite us having a smaller cost order, our service was excellent! You know how sometimes the service kind of goes down because not much was ordered? Not the case for us that night. 

I'm also a HUGE salsa lover, but not a lover of all salsas-if the salsa isn't spicy and if it's watery...no thanks! But the salsa here is the blended type (which I love because it'll stay on the chip easily and it's my watery) and each kind was tasty and spicy in its own way. 

Only thing we didn't like too much- the house margaritas had too much of the mix in it. If it were just a little less, then they would've been the best house made margaritas I've had.

Nachos were really good, I was happy to see all the vegetarian options. I would have liked my nachos to be more cheesy. They were perfectly spiced however and the flavors all melded very well. Huge portions and so two people can easily share. I had a peach margarita along with my meal which was quite strong but good.

We frequent Las Vegas a few times throughout the year and we always eat at the same Vegan eateries and although those other places are good... NACHO DADDY is the absolute best!!!!! We came in for the first time with our car club family and have never heard of this place before, and since we were invited we kinda were just gonna settle with a salad or something because most places don't offer a vegan menu. Surprisingly this place hand one and we were super excited. 
I ordered the Fajta Bowl and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas. We had some special request and the waitress SERRENA got our order right on the spot!! 
Fast forward to today. We are going back home to San Francisco so we stopped in for breakfast since they opened at 8. And guess who our waistress was... We got our seats and our waitress SERRENA immediately remembered us from the other night AND she also remembered what we ordered AND the specifics (no cilantro, add jalapeños etc) i was immediately impressed and she is super sweet and friendly! The funniest part was when she caught my husband inspecting his vegan chicken and she came up to ask if everything was ok. We laughed because one he got caught and two because the reason he was inspecting it was because it taste just like real chicken and the flavor was amazing! Hands down the best service and vegan food in all of Las Vegas!! I hope the manager reads this and let's Serrena know that she's an awesome person and is a huge reason why we will return!!",s2mC8x80m86Vzs62Z8fbHA,2,0,5,twpzONcs5jx5XgJ0T_lEJA

The bartenders have a laid back, but attentive, attitude while mixing a delicious house margarita (which was in fact on the house when I checked in on yelp)!

I had the Fajitas, wings, chips and salsa and the blanco queso - I actually didn't order the cheese dip, but it was seriously good on everything. I ended up dipping my wings in it, putting it on my fajitas and of course dipping my chips in it. 

One of the owners was there that night and he was hanging and partying with the chef, who was a lot younger than I thought he would have been.

I had researched this place before our trip, so I pretty much had an idea of what I wanted to eat. We all ordered different nacho dishes and margaritas and tasted each other's food. Hands down, the best thing we ate was the thai chicken nachos. They were a smaller portion than the other two plates we had (tostada nachos and barbecue chicken nachos), but they were extremely flavorful! I was very impressed by this dish. The margaritas were good, but (unfortunately) not too strong. They were also very sticky from being overfilled, resulting in the drink running down the side of the glass.

The Famous Scorpion Shot: I ordered it. I thought I could drink it, Scorpion included. That didn't happen. The Scorpion looked tiny in other photos and videos I had seen on previous reviews. I assure you, it is not! It's about an inch and a half long, served as a garnish on top of the lime. I asked the server how to eat it. He said he preferred chewing. That wasn't going to happen. Then, I thought about swallowing it whole. So I dropped it in the shot, thinking I could swallow the whole thing and not even flinch. WRONG! Once I put the Scorpion in the shot glass, it magnified the size. Now it looked like a yellow and brown monstrosity, and all I could think was, ""This thing has got to come out of me at some point."" I chickened out and grabbed the nearest fork and fished that sucker outta there! I did, however, drink the entire shot of tequila without flinching. I should get some credit for that.

My friends mentioned we were there to celebrate my birthday, and the server didn't hesitate to offer me a free shot! That was pretty nice. I definitely didn't expect any freebies in Vegas, on the strip, during a holiday (Halloween) weekend. Overall, this restaurant and service was great!

Taylor, the server, was warm and professional. 

The namesake nachos are delicious and can be shared as an appetizer by 4 people. We got the filet mignon nachos but I really wanted to try the buffalo chicken.

Fish tacos sounded like a good option for a snack but the waitress upped the ante by suggesting the signature tacos because of the homemade tortilla. I can't possibly say no to that - I was game. And indeed, as she claimed, these grilled fish tacos on homemade tortillas were fantastic. What a great suggestion, one that got us to revisit this place a few days later.

What I will say about Nacho Daddy is that the service and hospitality was excellent in both of our visits.

Las Vegas has that affect on people, simply just walking the strip is electrifying and come 2:00AM, we realize that our stomachs weren't having as good of a time as we were - they were hollering at us, saying, ""we need food, dude!"" So, as we took the corner, we noticed there was a Buffalo Wild Wings and a Nacho Daddy. Of course, we've eaten at BWW before but never heard of Nacho Daddy and so we decided to take the dive and try it. We're happy we did.

The second we walked in, we were greeted by a gentleman by the name of Jacob. Jacob was our server and aside from wielding what was the world's greatest mustache, he also had an incredible personality, was welcoming and not for a second did we feel unappreciated. We took advantage of the free house margarita by checking into Yelp and it honestly was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. I've had a lot in my days on Earth and honestly can say Nacho Daddy takes the cake for the best tequila ever. Aside from the margaritas, the nachos were bomb. It was as if God himself cooked our meal for us. Not a dry chip on the plate as advertised. I had the Crab & Lobster nachos which I treated myself to with my winnings from the Bellagio (thank you Mr. Bellagio) and it was incredible. We also tried a chicken sandwich and some other nachos which were also really, really, really, really (x250 really) good. Service, atmosphere, food, it was all a 6 star experience.

When we ordered appetizers she basically said don't get that and get this and the price difference would be 10 dollars. I'm not cheap and I understand up selling but don't throw huge up sells at your tables constantly when their ordering. Food good. Service bad.,LcsmIE_oE0MM51y23KoMuQ,0,0,3,zURJzp_Cn5r5hWc94EcFpQ

I have been here twice so far; once for a hosted event and once for a weekend lunch. Their menu has something for everyone, including more than half a page dedicated to real, fulfilling and creative VEGAN options! The avocado tacos are heavenly. 

Like their namesake suggests, they are taking your average plate of nachos over the top with unique interpretations of familiar flavors. My favorite nacho option is the Thai Chicken nacho- full of the classic Thai flavors but with a Tex Mex essence. 

Their drink menu is also impressive, with high quality, amazingly fresh margaritas; you can watch them squeeze the limes fresh at the bar! We tried the house, blood orange, Daddy's, and spicy cucumber margaritas- all delicious! If you're feeling extra brave, you can attempt their signature scorpion shot! 

This location may be in the center of The Strip, but has all of the welcoming atmosphere and service you'd expect from a local restaurant and the pride in their Vegas roots shows. From the managers, bartenders and servers, they spend so much time connecting with guests and expediently sharing top notch Mexican offerings with locals and tourists alike.

She let us know that her favs off the vegan menu were the Loaded Nachos and the Spicy Burrito. Done and done! When the order came, it looked SO good... we dug right in. A few bites in, I was questioning my entire life. I'm always such a paranoid freak when it comes to eating vegan at a non-vegan restaurant because people are humans and mistakes happen, but I'm not trying to realize it at the end of the meal. I had to ask Ryan to re-confirm for my insane mind that these delicious nachos were vegan, because the cheese tasted like straight up OG nacho cheese. It was definitely vegan but I feel like it would fool a non-vegan any day! I would add chikn to it next time, just to further my pigdom. The burrito was really flavorful! They somehow marinated the chikn to perfection and it actually held up a nice texture, unlike when I try to marinade chikn at home.

This Nacho Daddy is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops outside. To get here you have to walk about halfway through the shops, and then follow the signs for Harmon Street Restaurants. Then you go outside and walk a bit further and you will find it. It's next to BWW and Hot N Juicy. Not sure if there is anywhere closer to park, but it's quite a distance from the parking garage. 

I met a friend here at 5:30p on a Tuesday. It was pretty quiet, yet it took a while for our server to approach our table. When she finally showed up, she was upbeat and friendly. She explained some specials to us and recommended a few items as well. We both got white peach margs on the rocks, which were good, although I feel like mine was a bit heavy handed on the sweet n sour. It was happy hour (3-6 weekdays) and tequila shots were only $4, so maybe add a shot if you like it a little stronger.

As for the food, it was nothing to write home about. It really tasted like Taco Bell, but with strip prices. We split an order of filet mignon nachos, and fried avocado tacos. The nachos come with beans, cheese, filet mignon, guacamole, pico, and sour cream. We asked for the pico on the side as it had jalapenos in it, but still the nachos were pretty spicy. I believe it was the ranchero sauce that was over powering and took away from any of the other flavors. The tacos were also spicy and I couldn't even really tell I was eating avocado. I was disappointed because my friend had raved about them, and we both really just thought they were meh.

So given that the name implied that nachos were their specialty, I was expecting a great foodie experience.

The filet was over cooked and tough (which is the opposite of why you buy a filet to begin with) and it was covered in an awful salsa. Had the salsa been left off, the nachos would have been better. We also ordered chicken tortilla soup. It was supposed to come with chicken breast, however the chicken was left off but our server quickly corrected the error.

First of all, our server LAUREN was absolutely adorable! Beautiful, attentive, funny, and had the chillest personality. Second of all, I came here for the VEGAN NACHOS. Let's just talk about this really quick. Vegan. Nachos. Do I need to say much more? I do? Okay, let me continue. They are vegan, and gluten free, and DELICIOUS! The portion is huge and so is the FLAVA! I would recommend this restaurant to any one with food restrictions or allergies like my self. The FULL vegan menu and the crazy list of tequila options are... LIFE CHANGING. I dare you to try the scorpion shot.... I was to cowardly to do it... but it looked intense.

2222678,2018-06-29,0,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"In short, this place has super cool vibes, awesome service & ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOOD! 

Our group (7 people) initially stopped by around 12:00pm on Saturday but was told it was a 45 min wait. We dropped by again on Sunday around the same time and was seated almost immediately (but the rush came shortly after). You could call ahead and add yourself to the waitlist. 

FOOD (items I tried):
- Filet Mignon Nachos: Seriously the ultimate plate of nachos. SO BOMB. The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. The sauces, cheese, and guacamole just infused together SO perfectly. I could finish one plate by myself if I were SUPER hungry, but I think it would be best for sharing.
- Smothered Burrito (w/ both red and green enchilada sauces): HUGE and pretty good. You could add queso (instead of enchilada sauce) for an extra $2...but I think I prefer the red enchilada sauce. It also comes with a side of chips & salsa which we didn't end up touching because of our nachos.
- Daddy's Margarita (free w/ Yelp check-in): Pretty yummy & refreshing! I noticed the frozen margaritas were A LOT stronger than the iced ones. Pick your poison.

SERVICE, ETC.:
Our server was Huck & he was super great, friendly, and helpful. The food took a while to come out. But when it did, we all got our orders at the same time (though some plates weren't as hot as others). 

The World Cup game was on, so the super big flat-screen TVs scattered throughout the restaurant were perfect for the occasion.

It's opened pretty late so it's PERFECT for late night drunchies.

TBH, I'd choose this place over a buffet any day. A must-try if you're in Vegas!",Fs0HDT0DA3maBBG4hs9qSg,0,0,5,X-EMuAivazPCuvzA860xpw

Had the Asian Chicken nachos, which sounds weird, but it works.  Interesting flavor mix.  When they say ""Never a dry chip"" they mean it!  I for one, hate a plate of nachos where half of the chips have nothing on them.  Not here folks.
Second meal was the Daddy's Bowl.  Very hefty portion and good flavors.
Chips and guac were pretty good, too.
The peach margarita was tasty, but I'd skip their house margarita, its a bit on the sour side.

I was super excited to eat it and as I worked my way through it there wasn't much steak in it. For a $5 up charge to have the steak there seemed to be only a few nibbles and tons of rice. I think the burrito would of been a 10/10 if there was more steak in it. I'm also not totally convinced it was filet mignon either. Seemed more of a skirt steak similar to what you'd use for carne asada. It was a stringing beef. Either way, I feel like the flavor was there but it was just lacking on the beef that I paid extra for. I'd be willing to try it again though.

I ordered Buffalo chicken nachos, what I got was some nasty pile of stale tortilla child with sour cream and Buffalo chicken sauce that took 30 minutes to prepare.

3. For happy hour we got the mini BBQ chicken nachos & mini nacho average burger nachos. My husband really liked the nacho average burger nachos, meat seasoned well and lots of lettuce/tomatoes.

I ordered lobster and crab soft tacos (the priciest soft tacos they had on the menu...prolly coz of the seafood) and loved that the food wasn't heavy. The tacos tasted fresh and light...and unlike many other mexican places I went to where you felt sluggish, bloated and sleepy afterwards...I felt energized after eating those tacos for sure.

Prices were reasonable, especially given the fact that they are in close vicinity from the strip. The waitress was also attentive, too.

The three of us split two nachos, the spicy shrimp and the steak nachos. Both were great, lots of flavor and plenty of food for sure! We added guacamole to the shrimp, but it came later, and honestly for the extra $2 it wasn't really worth it.

Free margarita with the Yelp check in, so that was nice! Apparently you can upgrade to a higher quality margarita and then just pay the difference, but I'm not picky and the house margarita was just fine, especially at the price :-).

Combine this with the fact that it was taco Tuesday, and off to Nacho Daddy we went.  It was a quick Lyft ride from the NYNY where we are staying.  I highly recommend taking grandma to Vegas with you to watch the kids at night!  

We weren't really sure what to expect.  On a Tuesday night, Nacho Daddy was pretty mellow.  When we walked in, I noticed a huge terrarium just inside with giant scorpions as long as your middle finger.  Yikes!  Of course, my husband thought it was cool.

We decided to sit at the bar.  Our bartender was a cool kid who had been working there for a few months.  He was very helpful as we asked about the nachos and tacos.  We went with the carne asada nachos and three chicken tacos/three carnitas tacos for $5 each (taco Tuesday deal).

I can tell you that the nachos were legit, super delicious.  Tacos were very good as well.  Pork tacos were stuffed with carnitas.

Can't forget to mention the drinks - I had a margarita.  It was classic and came with the right amount of salt.  My husband is a daredevil and went with a tequila shot with a (dead) scorpion on it.  Why?  I don't know.  Apparently they buy these dead scorpions by the jar from Arizona and people actually eat them - as did my husband.  He also bought one for the bartender.  They are allowed to accept up to two shots per shift from customers, haha.

Definitely worth a stop!  Check out the giant scorpion and have some nachos.",PesNFqw_8e20OK33RVfEeQ,1,1,5,K_1oCoxxrVpIRb9fKF6Uqg

It was not terrible but definitely not great. The meat replacement they add on top was very salty. I'm not sure if that was because of seasoning they used or if that particular brand of replacement meat is salty. The pico they added was alright but needed cilantro and lime for sure. The vegan sour cream was better than I assumed it would be. The guacamole was surprisingly good. Chunky and full of lime taste which was delicious. Another weird thing is the waitress came back to assume is out good was almost ready several times and told me twice ""they're just figuring out your vegan bowl"".

But, really, you can get any kind of nachos you want and they are bomb; great flavor combinations, quality ingredients, and truly the worst part is trying to decide WHAT you are going to choose.  I've personally ordered the BBQ pork nachos which were OMG so GOOOOD and my own creation from their Gold something something, that was basically filet mignon and cheese.  Yeah.  SO GOOD.  The standard Mexican nachos got all the goodies on them and the buffalo chicken nachos are literally everything you think about when you order buffalo wings, BUT ON NACHOS!  I have a friend that ordered the ceviche and she says 'YUM', but I thought the portion was a little small.

For the amount and quality of food you get, the prices seem reasonable.  When in Vegas, you MUST GO HERE TO EAT.  If you don't, you will be sad.

I ordered the loaded vegan nachos. The reason I ordered this one over the Chik'n nachos was because of a review i had read on Yelp about the chick'n so I was naturally hesitant. Plus the chick'n nachos was around $1 more I believe. 

Well they ended up bringing me the chick'n nachos instead of the one that I actually ordered. I was bummed but I didn't send it back because I didn't want to waste all of that food. It ended up being pretty good so I was satisfied at the end of the meal still. 

Additionally, we got the triple dipper - I ate the guac and sauce while my boyfriend at the queso. We both agreed it was very good.

Our waitress (with mermaid hair color) was very attentive and kind to us while we sat at the bar as well.

It was pretty busy on Saturday night.  They told us it would be about 35 minutes for a table and that they could text me when our table was ready.  We walked over to the Miracle Mile shopping center next door and as soon as we walked in, they texted saying our table was ready.  It hadn't been more than 10 minutes.  I definitely prefer that a restaurant over-estimate than under but this was a little extreme.

The waitstaff is friendly and eager to give you recommendations and advice on what to order. We went with the queso for an appetizer and their supreme nachos to share. Both were excellent. I had a house margarita, which was good but a little on the sweet side.

If you are feeling adventurous, they also offer a scorpion shot where you can shoot a baby scorpion in some tequila - or whatever liquor you choose. When in Vegas....you have to try something like this once...plus it makes a great photo opportunity. The scorpion will set you back about $9, on top of the shot - so not a cheap adventure, but how often do you have the opportunity to eat a scorpion?",orOVeBYy9w7LkdyZqxniJQ,1,2,4,xNbdtsPCr9C3p2SrbQpFKA

First and foremost--this place was HARD to find. It was listed as being in the miracle mile mall, but you actually have to enter from outside. Once we were outside, getting back to planet hollywood was no issue at all, but yeah, just a good note. If you are coming from the strip and facing the walgreens attached to the mall, you want to go down the block on the right, i think its 2 blocks.

We started off with a pitcher of skinny spicy margaritas. That isn't on the menu, but they were able to do it for us which was legit. Those margaritas were good and a great way to get the weekend rolling.

We had vegetarian queso, quite tasty. I wanted to get nachos with also ordering queso, I figured I should reign it in and I got Chick'n tacos. Anytime I can get fake meat at a restaurant I do, and this did not disappoint.

NotYoDaddy could've been content to be lame, them being located on the strip(kinda) but totally showed up to work with pride. We had queso, margaritas, and a Pacifico to start out our afternoon of debauchery in Vegas.   
We were slightly slowed up by fiending out on the queso that was super rich, but was garnished with sliced serranos, onion, tomato and jalapenos that provided a little acidity to cut through the fat, but only made it easier to shove in our faces so vigorously, therefore making us exhausted but still scraping out the little plastic molcajete that it came to us in. We still had a bit of sense at that time and ordered some happyhour taquitos, chimichangas, and a Kale entree salad from the regular menu to go along with the 4 fritas (frozen margaritas) and 5 tequila shots we each had over the next 90 or so minutes bellied up to the bar. Needless to say, it was hammertime in wifeypoo&markypoo's head but managed to make it back to the Cosmo with some to-go leftover nibbles in hand. We paid a paltry 82ish pesos americanos and tipped our cracker-jack bar attendant 30 buckarinos for recognizing that she was dealing with 2 happyhour true play-uhz like your humble narrator and his beautiful lady.

The only thing that turned me off a little bit was the price, UNTIL I actually got my food and realized that for the quality and quantity it's totally worth it! I had no idea my nachos would be stacked so high. Pictures just don't do them justice. It's most definitely worth a stop, especially if you're a nacho fanatic like I am. You won't regret it. 

There's some appetizer trio with salsa, guacamole, and queso that they light a little fire under to keep it all warm and melty. Oh my goodness. Quite possibly the best queso I've had. I would most definitely recommend it. Also, the white peach margarita is wonderful! 

Definitely wishing this was a chain in Texas, but then again I doubt it would be this good if it was.",FALCgxNULl9_JIs7FbW9wA,0,0,5,ZBJAwX6g1kCQSljBEcEe4Q

Although no one could tell me what it was made of besides that there was oreos in it which the bartender informed us that oreos are indeed vegan me and my husband looked at eachother like no way! But a quick google search informed us that it was false bummed! But the cake was still delicous ;) 

Our second night we had crispy avocado street tacos, spicy burrito and the grilled corn with sour cream instead of mayo and the lovely waitress gave me the option to have the corn cut off the cob!

I saw another review that mentioned him...I can confirm he is excellent.  I was very impressed.  

As consumers we take a chance when eating in restaurants.  We were watching a special on tv that highlighted  restaurants that was rodent infested.  I was disgusted and even more hesitant about eating out.  Then we meet Reuben and Oscar... the head Chef and assistant.  They were walking out and we stopped them to give compliments on the food.  They thanked us and what was more surprising ...invited us to tour the kitchen.  Keep in mind, I just watched the show so I really was hesitate about going. Well, the pride they take in what they do was shown in the cleanliness and organization of that kitchen and prep area.  Some faith restored...so impressed we ate there the next day and will tell everyone to visit when in Vegas.

I highly recommend the Thai chicken nachos if you happen to like sweet, peanuty, tangy Thai flavors. The portion size is generous and can be easily split between two. I like the fact that the nachos were filling without leaving you feeling like you ate a bowl of greasy cheese. We also ordered a kale salad which was fresh and offered a nice balance to the hearty nachos. 

The place was spacious and had a fun but low key vibe. I also loved the music videos from the early 2000s that were playing in the background!

Brought my two buddies here, after assuring them it would be awesome based on the the reviews.  Saturday night, around 8 not too crowded.  We had a waitress, who though very nice, was largely absent after seating us. When our food order arrived, we spent about 5 minutes waiting (and later searching) for her because we had 1) no plates 2) no silverware 3) our food order was wrong.  When we explained that we ordered the nachos with no tomatoes or onions (which were all over the nachos), she asked if she wanted to send it back.  We explained that we don't WANT to send it back, but need to send it back because we had someone in the party who can't do those items, and she begrudgingly abliged.  No apology, nothing.  The first and only thing should have been an apology and an offer to replace, we were very clear in our order..

When we were eventually brought the plates, they were soaking wet, as if right out g the washer..  we had to wipe them all down.  The food was good, but the service just RUINED the experience- I am no longer, according to my buddies, allowed to pick where we go out to eat , that's how bad this was- damn!

The place was pretty quiet when we arrived, perhaps because people were still recovering from all of the excitement from the night before, or maybe because the location of the restaurant is off the beaten path... it sits on East Harmon a little away from the corner of Las Vegas Blvd, getting overshadowed by the infamous Taco Bell Cantina. We opted to sit at the bar and was greeted by the bartender immediately. We kept it simple and decided to share an order of Ultimate Supreme Nachos. They were good, not overly outstanding, and could've been warmer. I do appreciate that there was a really good toppings-to-chips ratio and the bartender even offered to bring a few extra chips, if needed.

Staff was cool and friendly.
Yelp checking gets you a free margarita but it was mostly sour mix. Not a hint of tequila.

We both had Huevos Rancheros which was quite a bit of food but not the best overall. Still, thankful for refuge from the chilly morning and away from crowds.

Or so we thought.

For some reason, the two large doors (think wide garage doors) on both floors were opened. This was around 11am and the temp was around 40 degrees. The entire restaurant was quickly  colder, forcing many patrons and some staff to put their jackets/coats/sweaters/scarves back on. WTF? And nobody was sitting outside or appeared to want to sit outside. 

We were told by out waitress that a single person asked to have the doors opened so they were opened. Which, didn't make sense. So everyone else must suffer and have their hot food chilled? Why wouldn't they just go sit on the patio outside?

We didn't want to be a pain but it was getting to the point of possibly leaving before our food arrived which I didn't want to do. We pushed a bit more once our food arrived and she then said that the owner usually opens it when he arrives (he wasn't there yet) and she'll see what she can do to get it closed back up. They were closed about 5 minutes later and we all rejoiced. Actually, only the downstairs door was closed. About 15 minutes later, it was reopened and thankfully by then we were finishing up.

I get patio weather and wanting to draw in the crowds but it was FORTY DEGREES. Most everyone wanted to eat inside and the hottest part of the day had not hit yet. At the very least, please take the temperature into consideration - during the winter - before freezing out your customers.

We had the Triple dip to start, it was a great appetizer with queso, guacamole and salsa. We also tried a couple different margarita flavors but personally I loved the mango. 

As entrees I had the signature tacos with pork which were gigantic! It comes with two tacos absolutely stuffed with meat. The tortillas were really good and fluffy sort of like Cafe Rio's. My favorite part of the dish may have been the rice it was SO good. 

I also tried the buffalo nachos. Definitely would be a good hungover or drunk food but I got pretty full at that point! The last thing we tried was the churro sundae which came with two churros and three scoops of ice cream. I feel like they could have reversed that with two scoops of ice cream and three or four churros. The ice cream seemed to melt before we could get to it.

Overall it was an awesome experience and I think people will have a really good time here. They also have scorpion shots which I witnessed but don't think I'll be participating in. Good times, great food and drinks!",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,5,-cC9-el3Qs3qzPjDtrq2Fg

They stay open until 2 am, so you have plenty of time to pop on by in the evening for some delicious nachos and the other food offerings that they provide.  

The nachos themselves are AMAZING, and we love the white queso dip that it comes with - the jalapeños add a great kick to its rich, creamy flavor.  But it has more than just nachos, despite it being its namesake!  The street tacos I ordered here were some of the best I've ever had.  They were full of meat and toppings and very filling!!  The rice and beans were very satisfying as well, so it was an all around delicious meal.  

We ordered it to go and ate in the room, but the atmosphere in the dining area is awesome as well, and we've eaten in there before.  It's like a more lively and fun Buffalo Wild Wings!  The prices are also quite reasonable for something on The Strip and for the quality and size of the portions!  

I love Nacho Daddy!  I'll definitely be coming back every time I'm in Vegas!!",ug0rcheH6Qzws7oGSnOAiA,1,0,5,usL3UkQDfiOf3pf3THU3xw

3111059,2018-06-13,1,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"Our experience started off poorly because I was very annoyed that we had been ripped off on the street buying the tall frozen cocktails and when we arrived they said we had to leave them by the door. On the Las Vegas Strip, that is a lot of trust to put in the hands of others. The girl said we could chug them otherwise and that wasn't going to happen but it was late and we were starving. I asked if we could put them somewhere out of reach near our table and that was refused and I just feel like this is poor customer service. I was happy to buy a drink there but they clearly didn't care and it said the mood for a poor experience. 

I was not overly impressed with the nachos and I was really unimpressed with the skinny margarita. We have been spoiled by having some really fantastic nachos and some delicious margaritas and these were not living up to my expectations. I've had plenty of skinny margaritas that didn't taste like club soda but this one was particularly awful. Our waitress was nice and offered to remake it for me but I just couldn't stomach the mixture with the club soda so she took it off of our bill. I drink vodka club too so this was particularly odd but it just didn't taste like a margarita!

We shared a plate of the nachos and we took advantage of the yelp check-in offer to get a free house margarita but the Nacho Daddy margarita is NOT it so don't be fooled. I guess just ask which is the house - we just paid the $3-4 upgrade fee. 

Overly disappointed with the experience and hostess's customer service. I definitely think it's worth trying other options on The Strip",_NpSl8OWMrQH45mfqia9zQ,2,0,2,9NEhEUeyz9zx9TH8D6rIhQ

3139816,2017-11-07,3,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"Nacho Daddy I believe can be either a hit or miss and this last visit that I just had here which was the second one fell in between the two. I'd received a gift card of some sort to use up before next year and I had a good friend in town and after playing tourist we struck up an appetite. I thought to myself well why not try Nacho Daddy out again. 

When we first arrived there was somebody who was standing at the front whom we thought was the server. I inquired with the young lady about taking a table outside and was told that she wasn't the hostess but yet a server.. You know just hanging out I guess. The hostess was off at the bar talking. Interesting.. Anyways while we waited for the hostess to be done I told my friend I would run to the restroom. Came out to only still find him just standing there. The thing I thought was most odd about this was that they weren't even busy so us not being able to be seated right away was throwing me off. Nonetheless we finally were escorted out to one of the table tops outside on the little patio. Weather was great so why not enjoy some great drinks and people watch?

Our server came out, introduced himself and even made some suggestions about some of the drinks. With the check-in on YELP they were offering a free ""house margarita"" which we ended up throwing in a few extra dollars to upgrade it to a more better tequila! Nice touch I have to give it to our server for having a great explanation and knowledge around the different tequilas! 
Now with margaritas generally when you order them you are asked with salt, sugar or nothing on the rim. Being so indulged into conversation my friend and I didn't even notice this wasn't asked until we got these margaritas with all this salt haha. No biggie! Manager came around to check in on how everything was going and ended up fixing those again for us this time with no salt. Very much appreciated. Overall score for the drink was a 4/5.

On to the food! Yes! So I've been on this whole seafood kick lately so with that being said I went for the shrimp fajitas for two! Yes.. for 2! I had already made plans to order enough to eat there and then also bring some home. When ordering this for two I got some hesitation from our waiter and a face that all but kind of said ""are you sure"" listen if something says for two and that's what one person orders you have to be careful about having a prejudging tone/expression because it's a great thing I'm not overweight or else I would've felt some type of way like that wasn't necessary regardless if you are trying to make a point that it's a lot of food. Anyways.. The plate came out and sure it was a lot but were there even enough shrimp to warrant that $28.99 price? The jury is still out on that. How did they taste? GREAT! So that's all that matters right? 5/5 for those. My friend ordered the steak nachos and loved every bite. 

Overall the visit was pretty decent. You may ask about why 3 stars out of the 5 huh? Well like any other restaurant rule, the food can be damn good but if the service is spotty that can make or break the whole experience. I think that in the start of the visit the area of opportunity could be to ensure you always have somebody at the front hostess station and even if they have to run to the bathroom or help another person whatever the case is, having somebody to fill in for that time frame can go a long way. Perception is reality so having the server who was there just chillin but not helping was off...",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,4,3,3,m_aLplDNgzTYGviwR8FPNA

*Fellow Vegan friends, beware of the lack of menu knowledge from Nacho Daddy's staff members*

Literally at loss for words. Yesterday My vegan friends and I went to Nacho Daddy for lunch, not only because they had great yelp reviews but also because of the accommodating Separate vegan menu they offered. Between the 3 of us we ordered, the Vegan avocado tacos, The vegan chicken bowl and A VEGAN CHIMICHANGA! As the chimichanga was served to the table my friend had cut the end piece to find out that the ""Vegan chicken"" was shredded. To our surprise we all had never seen ""Shredded vegan chicken meat"" so to be on the ""safe side"" we politely called our waitress over to ask her about the inside of our chimichanga, she reassured us that the meat WAS VEGAN and that it was house-made and delivered from a outside commissary daily. Because of the reassurance WE ATE THE ENTIRE BURRITO! In fact, We were so impressed by our faux meat vegan burrito that we anticipated ordering some again later that evening. As I ordered 3 vegan chimichangas to go expecting the same burrito I had ordered earlier.. I come to find out it was completely different. It had black beans, corn and rice... and NO shredded vegan chicken...hmmmm...I called in to verify if there may had been a possible miscommunication, but when I talked to the manager Edward (who also claimed to also be vegan) he told me that the burrito with the shredded chicken WAS NOT VEGAN. I repeat, NOT VEGAN!!! I even checked the receipt from earlier that day and it said ""V.chimichanga."" So either it was the kitchens mistake or she grabbed the wrong burrito. Regardless, WE asked her... she saw us eat it.. and she reassured us!! Edward apologized and said that he would replace the burritos but honestly, I am just completely disgusted. Eating meat goes against everything I believe in. It goes against my personal faith and beliefs. I can cry right now because I feel cheated. I spent $100 on a lunch, to be swindled into eating a burrito filled with dead carcass. I no longer have faith in Nacho Daddy.

My boss and friend both ordered off the nacho menu. I went with the Baja seafood combo. The combo was 1 crab/lobster enchilada and 1 fish taco. The taco shell was by far my favorite. It was homemade and super flakey unlike any other taco shell I have ever had. The fish on the taco was also such a nice size. The rice wasn't dry and that's super important! Overall, I was very pleased with this dish and would recommend it to anyone that doesn't want nachos. My friend is a nacho queen and she raved about these nachos.

3276824,2018-01-02,5,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"I first tried it at Life is Beautiful music festival back in September and I tried to go again to their location in Downtown the same weekend but it was way too crowded! I came back and once I found out there was a location on the strip, I knew I had to go again! 

We ordered the Naked Grilled Wings with BBQ sauce with ranch to start off with appetizers. Beware: their portions are pretty filling! If I knew this, I would've not ordered an appetizer! I ordered the Fiesta Nacho which is big enough to feed 2 people (I shared with my brother!); it consisted of chicken breast, salsa, onions, beans, cheese, green/red chips + tortilla chips, queso fresco, pico de gallo, guac and sour cream! SO GOOD. These nachos are life changing and I can't look at nachos the same way again. 

My dad ordered a burrito as it was his favorite type of food and he loved it! My mom ordered the tamale-enchilada entrée combination and she LOVED it. Nacho Daddy gives such a great amount of chicken breast meat and the portion size is definitely filling. I love how the tamale is open faced which is a different twist on how tamales are usually made! 

The service was okay. They ran out of items we wanted to originally try. They ran out of the Daddy's Wings which is why we ended up ordering the Naked Grilled Wings (which was not a disappointment at all!) On top of that, they ran out of deep fried ice cream & ended up getting the Caramel Apple Nacho (which was not disappointing at all either). Overall, we ordered items we originally didn't plan to but still loved it!!

Nacho Daddy is going to become must-have when I go to Las Vegas! I can't wait to come back especially because I didn't get the chance to check in on Yelp for a free Margarita~",h6HbVmgIY8WPa6LF9XyqQQ,6,6,4,JsbaJffZwM2D5X4j1l98jQ

Pitchers were 35 and the single serve size was 10. The pitcher poured like 2 drinks maybe... so if you want average nachos and ripoff drinks, then I guess it's fine. There's simply better places to go, but most of Las Vegas is designed to rip you off. I mean, it's the gambling capitol of the world, so I guess by Vegas standards this place deserves the 4 stars or so it has, but otherwise it's a 2. Would be 3 if the prices were more reasonable.

3436661,2018-06-12,1,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"I absolutely have to give this place five stars, no doubt about it.

Prior to EDC, I made a post on reddit asking for recommendations on late-night eats, based on where I was staying. A number of people recommended this place because it was directly across from where I was staying (Marriott Grand Chateau).

Other than EDC, I planned my trip around eating. My flight was supposed to get in around close to midnight, which means I'd have sufficient time to drop off my bags and go to Tacos El Gordo, but unfortunately, my flight got delayed!!! So by the time I got to my hotel, it was too late :'( luckily, Nacho Daddy was still an option and we walked across the street for some nomsss. 

That night, we ordered the triple dip appetizer and the filet mignon nacho to share between the five of us. It was enough for me to get full and for the others' midnight snack. THE QUESO IS SO BOMBBB. no idea what kind of cheese it is but I highly recommend it. The filet mignon nachos on the other hand, literally cannot go wrong. We inhaled it.

So anyway, this place was so good...that we came here Saturday morning with our party of 9, of course, no shame. We ordered the triple dip appetizer and three orders of nachos: filet mignon, lobster and crab, supreme tostada. Again, I think the filet mignon was the favorite of the three. 

Our servers were generally attentive, but I think the most important part of dining during EDC weekend is keeping us fed, so they did their jobs. I'm definitely coming back if I'm in the area.",_JV_qWg6qrTY30TzLtxX4g,2,1,5,XVpLCoUQ_4jz0V8eOfoGEw

Ordered ceviche for myself and kids nachos and kids quesadilla. Ceviche was tasty and very fresh. Only thing is I think there's to many chips for the serving. Picture to follow. Kids nachos were big portion we added chicken to them which was very good. Quesadilla was not very tasty. Needs to have less cheese and more crisp tortilla. It taste more like oil. Our server Gio was friendly and upbeat! Made good conversation and took care of us. Overall it's a good place to eat as a family. Lots of tvs and we got the Sunday night game after asking the GM! When we asked a server passing by he came back saying the owner wanted to watch the hockey game. So when he came by asking what could he do to make our expierence better we asked for the Sunday night game which he said ok to. We thought it was wired when we got the first response.

He was very sympathetic to our plight and made our dining experience extra special to ensure we left feeling better about our time in Vegas. 

The margaritas, nachos, and chips and salsa were all fantastic.

At least, that's what I would do. I wasn't hungover when I came here, but I bet this place would hit the spot after a wild night out. We ordered the Fiesta Nachos and the kitchen staff at Nacho Daddy did it right. The nachos were mixed with both rich (cheese, refried beans, guacamole, and sour cream) and savory ingredients (pico de gallo, sauteed onions, salsa, and chicken). The pico de gallo actually fooled me into believing I was being a little healthy. LOL. 

Service was okay. It was early when we went and I don't think they were all that attentive, but we were fine with it. There's no rush when you're in Vegas anyway.",G2yIrMZIQymVqNv5uvbIZg,4,5,4,_JcbgCCNibJwioU-inoxHg

For the prices they charge - you would expect a mountain of nachos. NOPE. At $15-$20 for a plate of nachos - that are smaller portions than the $8 nachos at Dave & Busters and Buffalo Wild Wings - it was quite a disappointment. They have a lot of ""specialty"" nachos - which is great for the variety - but the prices are ridiculous. The waitress, when we asked about portion size, told us we could probably all three share 1 nacho order and be fine and full. We were so hopeful! We still ordered 3 plates of different nachos - no one left full - we all left hungry with no food left. Ridiculous. Go somewhere else for nachos.

I am not sure if they are all the same size, but we went with the Supreme Tostada Nachos and they were definitely enough for two people. Even though there wasn't a lot of food per se, there were enough calories in all the cheese and saucy goodness to last for a long while. All in all the dish was balanced and done very well, with the chips remaining crispy while we ate and flavorful salsa and ground meat distributed all around. They did screw up on the Daddy's Wings though; while the meat was perfectly done, the sauce on the outside was way too salty and made the wings pretty hard to eat. Maybe just a fluke?

Hostess said our waiter PJ would be over shortly, we waited a little over 6 minutes before a gentleman came over commenting he's noticed we've been waiting a while for our waiter, could he get us started on drinks. I was very grateful for his attempt, commenting that we had just discussed leaving due to not getting waited on until he stopped by. We already had our menu so we knew what ones we wanted. Went with two Margaritas and two glasses of water. PJ actually was the one who brought our drinks to us, explaining it was a busy night, trying to make small talk. My boyfriend had counted during our wait, it was less than 17 tables and more than enough staff that at the most he'd have 3 to 4 tables...so, no excuse! Sure, could have been busy at your dinner rush but we came in shortly after 8:00pm, not a full house, we don't need excuses. Took our food order and we waited, and waited.
The kind server who took our drink order must have mentioned something to the manager because he walked by saying ""is everything ok now that we have our food?"". That was kind of innaproapate, either stop before this and visit, or know you rectified the situation by speaking with your employee behind the scene.
When PJ brought the food he commented that he'd be checking in a lot, giving us all his attention, that we'd probably get sick of him. He was nice, this is probably his first serving job, just relax and it'll be ok! We saw him the traditional one stop before the check. 
We've both been in the restaurant industry, boyfriend a chef and I used to be a server, once you find your Niche you're golden...I hope it's soon for him. He just needs confidence, he's got the rest down.

The portion size was huge, too, so I brought some back to the hotel with me in a box. I'm also a fan of the free margarita with yelp check in! The ambiance was pretty relaxed with music videos playing on the screen and blasting over the speakers. 

My only con is that these nachos really upset my stomach. I'm not sure if it was too much grease, or artificial ingredients, or what, but the rest of the day I had pretty bad stomach cramps and it kind of put a damper on things. For that reason, I don't think I'll be back, I don't want to risk that happening again. :(",0TuuWj7R5QsMDxWAcy9rxQ,0,0,3,K0w9xHiZDtsu9RO-1oEYnw

Really? ) that I wasn't able to taste the food itself. I only had the meat and the guacamole which was all I could eat and taste properly. If you want nachos I'd suggest you ordering something else.. it sounds delicious but at least mine wasn't.. I complained about it and they didn't charge me the nachos (fair enough since I barely touched it) and got me free dessert which was THE BEST CHURRO ICE CREAM EVER! Really, so so good!!

Nacho Daddy is what Yelp says a 3 star place is...""A-OK"". The venue itself is a cool theme with televisions everywhere. Nacho Daddy is a cool place to catch a Golden Knights game or your favorite out of town team. The staff at Nacho Daddy is friendly and the food comes out fairly quick. The food is where the rating fell off. By no means was the food bad, but it also wasn't what we were hoping for either.

Used my check-in offer for the house marg which was super sweet and not very buzz-inducing, but a nice gesture nonetheless.

Food came out quickly in generous portions. BBQ chicken nachos hit the spot and were packed with flavor, not lacking any meat or toppings. Their BBQ sauce is a surprising winner.

Now for our uninvited table guest...Lord knows if he came from outside or the terrarium up front, but a big juicy cricket hopped right on up to look me eye to eye just as I was finishing my nachos. Not very appetizing. The manager gave us 25% off the bill which amounted to about $6. Maybe more of a concession would've been made if I had bitten into the darn thing, but glad I had a gift certificate to use anyway to cover the rest.

It turns out that they were waiting for our wings to come out and they take a while. Eventually a waiter came to our table and asked if we would like to start with the nachos, even though the wings are technically the appetizer. We, of course, said yes! 

I shared the Fiesta Nachos. So good. The chicken was shredded and had a lot of flavor. The chicken itself wasn't spicy in my opinion, but there were some jalapeños throughout the nacho mound. I do think that the chips got a little soggy because they were sitting out for a while, but the flavor was still good. The naked wings were also fine.

Our first visit was mid-morning, and we were hungry. Some of us love breakfast, some of us don't (kind of a hard group to work with in the mornings. . .). We had heard great things about Nacho Daddy, so we walked around the corner from Planet Hollywood, and found a seat at the bar. Kasandra greeted us, and quickly suggested the Bacon Cheese Enchiladas for my breakfast-loving husband. The rest of us ordered Crispy Chicken Sandwiches and Pork Tacos.
Needless to say, we were so happy with the food and the service (thanks, Kasandra!) we came back the next afternoon for snacks before going to the airport.

Yayyy they had their scorpions stocked! I had been to the downtown location over a year ago looking for the scorpion shots, and they had run out of scorpions. I was so psyched to get to try them this time, and the location so convenient.

The bartender recommended a really smooth silver tequila - I can't remember what it was. It came in a double shot, totaling $14 I think. Totally worth it! However... I did not dare eat/swallow the scorpion. I was not that adventurous. I totally disappointed everyone in the restaurant who watched when they heard the bartender ring the bell (they do that to bring attention to someone buying the scorpion shot). Oh well, I got my photo and experience of having a dead scorpion in my mouth for a few seconds! Haha.

4051883,2017-11-08,6,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"Sorry Daddy, but you are Nacho my type.

I have dined at the downtown Nacho Daddy location and I also attended a Yelp Elite event at this location.  I returned to this location shortly before 6 pm on a Tuesday with a friend who had never been to Nacho Daddy. 

Despite it being happy hour, there was not very many people dining and we were quickly taken to a large and comfortable booth to wait for our server. Personally, I felt like service was a little slow considering how empty the place was, but our waitress was very friendly.

We started out with margaritas which were excellent. No complimentary chips and salsa here, Daddy's a stingy one. 

Since there was a taco Tuesday special (3 for $5), we decided to share a plate of the avocado tacos that I thought were the standout item served at the Elite event. Sadly, these were not as light and crispy as I remembered and they were served drenched in salsa.  

I had never ordered nachos from either of the Nacho Daddy locations I had been to, so it seemed fitting that we share some and we decided on the Filet Mignon Nachos. While the nachos are quite large and easily enough for two people to share, I found the ingredients to not be well dispersed and the ranchero sauce overpowered the other flavors on the plate. 

Total damage for 2 margaritas, the tacos which were on special and a plate of nachos to share was over $50, pretip. While this is by no means overboard for a dinner on the Strip, I do think it was a bit high for what we actually received. 

I will keep Nacho Daddy in mind for the rare occasions I need a vegan-friendly spot to take guests for a meal. Personally, I don't foresee myself coming back for more than a margarita.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,5,6,3,Z0AUBrtMM30VzovVd6ex6A

The menu had a ton of ""non nacho"" options for all the haters, but I narrowed my focus to the nacho options. I had to try the filet mignon nachos, which sounded so perfect. I had zero regrets doing so. The nachos were super flavorful, and the beef on there was amazing. Our party all ordered different nachos with the intent to share, but we all horded our own as soon as we got them. Beware of this. 

They also have a scorpion shot drink, with a real scorpion in it! We don't drink, but asked if we could have a scorpion anyways to try. It didn't taste great, but added to the experience! Our server was super nice, and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of during our visit.

It is slightly difficult to get to this place because it seems like it is in the Miracle Mile shops, but it is actually outside and to the side. We had a tiny bit of trouble finding it. But that could just be our poor navigation skills. 

Once we found our way in we were seated pretty quickly. Although the table was still dirty. They wiped it down right away and apologized. Not a big deal. 

Our server was Chase who I believe is also a bartender. (I remembered his name because i have a toddler who loves Paw Patrol). Chase was fantastic! I personally cannot do tequila as it makes me sick. So i asked him besides margaritas what could i have? He told me he could make the margaritas with rum instead. I was so happy with that. I ordered the White Peach Margarita (with rum). My Hubby got the Nacho Daddy Margarita. They were big and tasted great! They each had 3 oz of alcohol. 

For food we ordered the Vegas Golden Nights Nachos (Nacho Daddy). OMG! Incredible. These nachos were everything. A perfect ratio of chips to toppings. Piled with marinated filet mignon, provolone, yellow queso, sauteed onions, mushrooms, bell peppers and pickled peppers.  We added jalapenos. 

I would go back to Vegas just for these Nachos. It will be very difficult to find something similar in California. Keep up the good work Nacho Daddy. We will be back!",OSDwgMHoeu5SpX5uCw06GQ,0,0,5,9432gk6bWxP40zwlONe0Rw

Holy. Cow. Just go. If you're considering it, just go. We had Edward and Rebecca serving us at the bar-they couldn't be friendly or more attentive. Edward recommended a new menu item- Nashville Nachos. Chicken, Mac n cheese, chipotle spicy mustard sauce, hot cherry peppers, pickles, cheese... and it was the size of a cookie sheet/piled high to feed an army. My gf got the Cali burrito- Filet mignon, garlic fries, homemade salsa and chips and it was soooo delicious and filling. Just a perfect experience/atmosphere/gem.

Place gets three stars due to it having a decent beer flight for only $9. Ordered the VGK Nachos - man are they disappointing. Small plate with Luke warm to almost cold toppings and cheese. For a place with Nacho in their title they don't do a very good job with nachos. Also ordered wings. Only two kinds...BBQ and Buffalo. No other sauces or types available. They were decent but only 8? Really. I might go back to try something else for the beer and music but avoid their so called signature dish - it's all HYPE!
UPDATE! 
Was contacted via email by Taylor Smith. At first she seemed genuinely concerned with the not great experience we had. But she only said ""we did get voted best wings by Insider"". Who cares??!! I'm talking to you about giving me 8 wings instead of 12 and charging me for them. They're not great! 
She was not concerned with my experience and clearly is a HR/Mgmt flunkie charged with responding to reviews. She doesn't care what you say...the customer is always WRONG.

Service was pretty blah. First they forgot our margaritas, then they forgot about 1/2 our order and had to come back to ask us what we wanted again. Good thing they did though because I wanted the vegan fajita bowl and they forgot it was even vegan! 

Food came out and they forgot we ordered the garlic cheese fries, a side salad, no onions ina. Sandwich, and sour cream. So they had to go back and make it and bring back out.

I went with the Supreme Tostado Nachos after much debate. They have so many options it's hard to choose. They laid the most beautiful plate of nachos I've ever seen in front of me and I was instantly in love. The chip to topping ratio was on point. It wasn't a heaping pile of chips with a few toppings.

It's a little strangely located, on the outside of the Miracle Mile shops, around the corner from the main drag. You can only get to it from the outside, not from inside the mall. We didn't have a problem finding it, but the location did surprise us. 

We were promptly seated. I was quite frankly a little shocked to see that the windows and doors were propped open despite it being 100 degrees outside, but the air inside was kept refreshing and cool. Unlike a lot of places in Vegas, I wasn't shivering from the blasting AC, and I wasn't sweating through my clothes from stale air. It was literally perfect.

As for the food, it was AWESOME. We ordered two things of nachos, the BBQ Chicken and the Nacho Hamburger Nachos. True to their slogan, there was not a single dry nacho. The flavors were really unique and enjoyable, but both my husband and I preferred the flavor of the Nacho Hamburger Nachos. Two plates of nachos was a lot of food for the two of us. We were able to finish it, but were feeling pretty full and a little bloated for several hours afterwards.

I also ordered the tortilla soup which was really delicious, and I added a side of avocado to it which was perfectly ripe and a great addition.

Everyone has to love Nacho's...so what a better place to go to than a place called Nacho Daddy while in Las Vegas. 

The address is Las Vegas Blvd, but it is on the front of a side street. Not far from the strip. 

A lot of ingredients and mixers for drinks are all made in house! Which means better and fresh flavors. 

Make sure to check in on Yelp while there and you get a FREE margarita. Not a cheap, piss pour one either. It was the same as the one we paid for! Had great flavor, mixed well too. 

STAFF: Everyone was very friendly. The waiter spent time with us and the menu. Not once did they try to rush us and get us out of the place. 

FOOD: Lots and Lots of it. Nachos can be split with a few people they are that big. However, since I was bowling nationals that day, I wasn't going to be eating much and ate it all to myself. Yes, I am a pig I know. Lots of flavor, not over whelming though. I had the crab and lobster nachos. I would def. order them again when I go back. 

SERVICE: OUTSTANDING. Everyone was very attentive and helpful. Not once did we hear I am sorry you are not my table. Everyone asked if we needed anything else, etc. 

CLEANNESS: Tables cleaned while you are sitting at them. Never a mess left at a table once people are gone. Food was picked up off the floor, which is a good thing because we know how messy nachos can be. 

PRICE: You might look and think it is expensive...however, the size of the platter that the nachos come out on is HUGE and with lots of ingredients. 

If you are in Vegas, this is a must mid day snack stop!",OvSvbUCHdtto3CXK1EwTxA,8,5,5,7am8FBeUoAtr29murAf3UA
4544510,2018-02-10,0,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"So first impressions: Vegan food has an actual menu! Most vegan options are pretty limited on the strip, but they have chick'n ""meat"" and the flavors are very well done. Looking for vegan options on the strip was limiting me to Wahlburgers for the impossible burger and fries. So when I saw this menu? I was in! 

We ordered the chicken fajita platter and the special chick'n chimichanga. Both were vegan, although my dinner date didn't care for the black beans or wild rice. The flavored were good, and the unlimited chips and salsa have a good flavor. I liked their guacamole, it was really fresh and well flavored. I don't think the beans and rice were terrible enough to knock off a star, and the service was good, but a little slow. I liked the flavors, and the food was plated nicely and had good portions. I didn't the nachos, but they looked PHENOMENAL. Next time it's nacho time! 

Entrees were about $15, and a small appetizer with two waters made it a big meal. Overall, $45 with a 20% tip for two wasn't bad at all.",J4LtMG4yMuAleDGBFO6b2w,0,0,5,epY2xp-_Gx0Sb1vXqs2tQg

Service wise I could tell some kinks still needed to be worked out like having a hostess up front and ready to greet people. My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar during visit so our bartender was great. She was super friendly and quick. 

As for the food they have various options like enchiladas, tacos, salads and obviously nachos. They have a decent handful of vegan and vegetarian options which is awesome. I had the loaded nachos this most recent time which were quite tasty. The only downside for me was that the chips get soggy too quickly. 

Overall I'd come back to this location again if I'm around the strip and would recommend it for others visiting to check it out.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,2,0,4,6YoLw1YitrcMp3FQ59n0UA

First off, don't forget to check in for a FREE Signature Margarita! Can't go wrong with that, had a good amount of alcohol and was a great way to start the meal. The ambiance is perfect for groups with plenty of tv screens playing either sports or throwback hip hop songs. Now onto the food: 

Filet Mignon Nachos - SO GOOD! The meat is very tender and everything about the taste was perfect. The only thing I would fix is maybe adding more chips since those ran out real quick and the portion size isn't the largest I've seen, but it's definitely quality over quantity here. 

Thai Chicken Nachos - made with spinach chips, these were definitely not your average nachos. Wasn't a huge fan of these since the chicken was cut a bit larger so it was a bit harder to scoop. 

Peach Margarita - got a pitcher of this and it poured 5 cups easily. Absolutely loved it and would recommend it to others. 

Overall, I'd make another stop here the next time I'm in Vegas with some friends. The service was great, ambiance was chill, and paired with some delicious nachos means you're in for a good time.",i2C52tULd1dfVrLWlzrQJw,0,0,4,eSjxMlsYJ7N4aK0q3yGffQ

I ordered the vegan loaded nachos and had them delivered to my hotel. In 30 min, I had a pile of perfectly gooey nachos at my disposal. Their vegan nacho cheese is legit!!! This is not a couple of daiya shreds thrown about, this is cheeeeeese, on every single chip. They loaded them up right, with smoky, spicy salsa and beans. They were so good, my cheese-hating (vegan or otherwise) husband dived right in with me. Thank god, too, because there were a ton of nachos!

My second encounter was when I stumbled upon their storefront just when I was feeling hungry. I saddled up to the bar and was served by Scarlett, who was super sweet and made me feel right at home. It's hard eating alone anywhere, but in Vegas it can feel especially isolating. I felt right at ease with my complimentary margarita (free when you check in!), chick'n tacos, and vintage Kelly Clarkson.

I love that this chill place has lots of vegan options, delivery, and multiple locations across Vegas. I don't love the tank of scorpions, and how they dare you to take a scorpion shot. Eek! Creepy and unkind, not a great mix. The nachos are fantastic, though, and I look forward to coming back after a fun night on the town.",H183Fg4ku9mIQsmAa0fsOQ,4,3,4,P1YkNkBDF0WI26cOQGnr-Q

I don't know if there was suppose to be a hostess there or not b/c after he sat us he went behind the bar to bartend. I waited ... And waited ... And waited, until about 12-15 min later the same guy walks over and asked if we have been helped.  He apologized and said he would tell his MgR, and so he did.  He took great care of us afterwards. Food was great and delicious.  Drinks (I got micheladas) were on point and really good too!  The waiter promised me he would take care of 1 drink and my appetizer.  I thanked him and told him he was great and maybe someone was having an off day that I understood.  The 2nd part comes in when I get the bill, he took care of my appetizer and 2$ extra but not my drink as promised.  I would have been ok if he told me he was going to take care of my appetizer only, but don't tell me your going to do something and not do it.  That's the worst !   Worst part about the experience is it was dead, so they had no excuse on the amount of time to attend someone.  Would I recommend it to someone ... I don't know if they have service like that maybe not, but the food is really good!

4657433,2018-05-17,0,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"Good food and service. Have been twice now....first time two days ago for dinner. We shared the boneless bbq chicken wings, they were okay, slightly dry. I had the grilled lobster tacos which were very good, soft corn tortillas and a good mango salsa. I also ordered a side of black beans instead of refried, and they were good. Hubby had a pollo burrito, solid choice, and it came wet(but not very). The other two in our group had a Carne Asada burrito and enchiladas. Both enjoyed their dinners as well.

Today we went back to try breakfast. I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage. It definitely is big(I only ate 1/2), but here's the thing....it was okay....but not one of my top ten. So, in my humble opinion, and being a native Cali, this was pretty plain, and had a fair amount of grease dripping out. The contents were hash browns, scrambled eggs, cheese put on top and then it appeared that the sausage were patties that had been weirdly chopped and put on top of the hash brown/egg/cheese. It almost looked layered. No pico, no crema, no guac or avocado.....just plain. I literally was dumping the salsa(that came on the side), and Cholula to get some moisture/flavor. Hubby had the steak omelette and really liked it. 

We probably would return, but I feel like you need to know what to order, as not everything is a standout. But I do think they are known for their nachos(hence the name, lol), and we did see a lot of them being served around us.  In the end it's not going to beat any of our favorite Taqueria's in Nor Cal, or the Central Coast, but the food here is fresh, and the service is great.

I don't want to forget....we did enjoy two pitchers of margaritas with dinner, Patron Anejo, on the rocks. Not cheap on the pours, and tasty!",xjFKMQNUdeqL3nwEQ3gdvw,0,0,4,zmZgi5IZi748Uru8uoUkUQ

They have $20 bottomless mimosas (current at the time of writing, June '17) and our bartender had no problem adding bubbly when we thought the OJ ratio was a bit high.  Second piece of boozing advice is their Cadillac Margarita is MUCH better if you ask the bartender to make it with lime juice instead of sour mix; makes it taste much more like a proper margarita, but I know some people like the (sweet) sour mix that I think makes margaritas taste like lime sports drink, so get it normal if that's your thing.  The Grand Marnier floater makes it compete pretty closely with Margaritaville's $12 'perfect margarita' which has no mix, just booze and lime.

For food, I've had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde (green sauce, not red) and they were definitely above average as far as enchiladas go.  Obviously not authentic Mexican but reasonable for a touristy Vegas Strip restaurant.  The chicken quesadillas are huge; my wife ate half and was full.  I had one and it was also above average.  For the price, and location, I'm giving four stars because most Vegas Strip places are just mediocre food at high prices, and I left here feeling like I got a good meal and some decent drinks, at a price that matched.

A bit of side entertainment while we dined was watching some other folks at the bar order the tourist trap scorpion tequila shot, basically $20 for a shot of tequila that has an actual scorpion inside that you're supposed to eat.  The advice I heard the server giving them was chew it, don't try to swallow it.

The chimichanga was my least favorite of the three, it was pretty heavy with too much carbs and the pork was not super seasoned - it was too much of a mush. The Filet Mignon Nachos, however, was amazing!!! highly recommend it. The meat was well seasoned with crunch from nachos and creaminess from cheese and extra toppings from the tomatoes and guacamole.

Not surprisingly this place specializes in nachos.  They have over a dozen different options where it is more than just changing a topping a two.

We started with the queso dip.  This was actually one of the best ones that I have had.  It was a nice portion and the unique aspect was that it was set up almost like a fondue holder having a flame underneath to keep the cheese melted.

We then had an order of the spicy shrimp nachos and the smothered burrito.  Both hit the spot!  The nachos are definitely big enough for 2 to share and be more than filled.

Why yes... yes I did.

This place was AWESOME and we had a great time coming here. After spending all day at Marquee Dayclub seeing Galantis (amazing live btw, trust me), we were looking for a new spot to try that we hadn't been to yet. My fiancee and I come to Vegas at least once a year, and so we've got many trips under our belt and believe it or not, feel like we've tried nearly everything out there. 

I've always felt that The Strip lacked a really, really solid Mexican restaurant. Sure, there's Diablo's Cantina, but... meh. It's just okay. When we found this place on Yelp, of course I was down to give it a try. Mexican food is DELICIOUS, amiright? And a free margarita with a Yelp check-in? We'll now you're just being nice.

We headed over there for an early dinner around 5PM. The spot wasn't packed but there were people in there, and it definitely started to fill up with a fun crowd by the time we left. I still technically call this place ""on the strip,"" but you will have to walk about 40 seconds down a side street to get to it so if you don't immediately see it, it's just around the corner. 

I ordered a chicken and carne asada taco plate and my fiancee got a salad. Both were absolutely FANTASTIC. We also got this delicious drip trio which came with chips (duh), guac, salsa (AMAZING!), and the most out-of-this-world bomb-dot-com queso dip that was just the best ever. If you're anything like me, you know that what can seriously make or break a Mexican spot is their chips and salsa -- for me, even if the food is meh, and the chips and salsa are amazing, it's a win in my book. Happy to say, this place nails it on all regards.

As I mentioned, food is amazing quality. Carne, Chicken, and my fiancee's salad were all on point, and the drinks were delicious, refreshing and strong (as they should be).

If you've made it this far in the review, I'm not sure why you're still reading and haven't already started heading over there... unless you have at which point I'll commend you for being such a damn good multitasker. Anyways, you won't regret your trip here.

There is a aquarium in the front with a couple scorpions unfortunately they weren't social during my wait for the table.
We got seated in about minutes. There were plenty of TVs for any night you're looking to catch a game.
We got started with some chips and salsa which are a great way to soak up a tiny bit of alcohol. and our server started us off with a couple waters and took our drink orders. We got a frozen margarita no salt and a ginger ale We ended up with a classic margarita with salt and a pepsi. The classic margarita is good and strong. I'd call it a potential hair of the dog candidate. 
It took about 15-20 minutes for a delicious plate of nachos make its way out but unfortunately it wasn't ours. The next two plates were and they were piled high with toppings. For the price a definite deal. They have a wide variety of nachos with different proteins for your tasting pleasure. We ended up getting the BBQ chicken nachos and the classic nachos. The chips kept their crunch throughout most of the plate I never ran out of toppings. 
The service during this trip was just a little distracted. Our server seemed to have their mind elsewhere and brought out drinks that were different from what we ordered and had food sent out that wasn't ours but the nachos were good. Nacho Daddy is a place worth checking out if you're a nacho fan or simply need to absorb some alcohol with a little hair of the dog for the hangover. I don't think distracted service is a normal thing at Nacho Daddy.",O6Z9UYHiY5ZE8v2r-sjlpQ,1,1,3,xxTbkphtq-DiKSuI_Y1nig

The service was a little hit and miss. The bartender didn't seem to want to be there and left half way through our dinner so we got a new bartender which was a lot more attentive. 

For food we got a couple different nachos and split them all. We got the buffalo chicken nachos, pulled pork nachos, and fiesta nachos. The buffalo chicken nachos good, but very heavy on the sauce. The pulled pork nachos were extremely good and more than enough for 2 people! The fiesta nachos had a nice kick to them as well. 

There was a nice large menu of margaritas to choose from. We got the Cadillac margarita and it was on the sweeter side. Not too bad, but maybe a little too much triple sec.",BXB5vsysPvq11GwS9bvyiw,0,1,4,e3pZ-3x950JG1UwrQ-mM6g

We shared the lobster and crab nachos- they didn't really have enough of the seafood and had too much sriracha- next time I'd ask for it on the side. Also they were not very hot when they came out. The Mexican corn side dish was delicious. 
Others in our party had the chicken enchiladas and plain cheese nachos and said they were good. 
The Mexican Candy margarita was very pretty to look at and was delicious- it is very sweet!!
The ambiance in the restaurant left a little to be desired - it was pretty warm in the restaurant. Granted it was over 100° outside and the restaurant has very high ceilings, so I am sure it's hard to keep it cool, but we would have been more comfortable had the restaurant been cooler.

I got the chicken tamale and checked in on Yelp for a free house margarita. Our waiter told us to upgrade to the larger size for only $2-$3 for a higher grade of tequila, which 2 of my friends ordered. Here are my thoughts...

Chicken tamale: 3 stars. COMES WITH CILANTRO (not marked on the menu). It was definitely not the best tamale I've had. Not awful but I love tamales and I couldn't finish this one. It was too salty but not flavorful, if that makes sense. It lacked taste, and the salt only made it worse. 

House margarita: 5 stars. Tasty and adequately alcoholic. The tequila in the house margarita actually tasted better than the upgraded one my friends got. This seemed more alcoholic as well.

Upgraded margarita: I can't rate this as I didn't order this but my friends said the tequila didn't taste good and it was barely alcoholic. Stick to the house margarita!

Service: 1.5 stars. Our waiter was nice but ohhhh my god was he slow. It took him 20 minutes to grab our bill, then another 20 to figure out how to separate our checks. My biggest complaint was his response to me not realizing there was cilantro on the chicken tamale. I specifically checked the menu to make sure cilantro wasn't listed, as for many other food items, it was on the description as an ingredient. When I told him I can't eat cilantro, he said ""you should've told me this when you ordered"" and he annoyedly took my plate back. Pretty sure all they did was scrape off the mound of cilantro on top, as I could still taste it and saw bits of it in my food when I got it back. Waiter has a point that I could've mentioned this, but he could've been nicer in his tone and the menu was misleading.

Would not come back, but if they're still running the Yelp deal for a free house margarita, sure, come here I guess...",97SsUShPcqF71hX7Nrvq4w,0,0,3,flxnMd_H6nDbJbo5LGpsbQ

There's a free margarita with check-in, and they do NOT skimp on the alcohol. You can have it either regular or blended, or even upgrade to a fancier margarita and just pay the difference. 
The nacho servings here are so huge that we shared 1 plate of nachos for every 2 people. My friend and I got the spicy shrimp nachos and we loved them!! They're a perfect amount of spicy, and the shrimp is seasoned and so flavorful!! I love how there are so many toppings that no chip has to be eaten dry.

Even though it says Miracle Mile shops, the restaurant is located on an ave slightly off the strip which confused us while we were looking for it.

The restaurant is pretty large. As you enter, they have a small waiting area with a scorpion tank, very funky. There is a large bar, a dining area, and a small patio section with 4-5 tables which is cool for people watching.
The decor is decent but not special, but the ambiance was pretty dingy in the inside dining area, and not very clean. There were also pigeons flying in trying to snag scraps to eat, which was very weird.

For the food and drinks, the nachos were excellent. We got two different types of nachos, and those were made to perfection. However, the other entrees weren't as good. My burrito was very dry and lacked flavor, and the quesadilla was burnt. Some of the other entrees my friends got were nice, like the fajitas and sandwiches.
The drinks were really great too. We tried a pitcher of their orange margarita which was very well made. The spicy cucumber margarita packed a kick, but was refreshing.
A commendable thing here is the availability of a vegan menu, which I've hardly seen in vegas.

The service however, was really slow. There was only one server for the entire section who was overwhelmed. She was very friendly and trying her best to keep up with the crowds, but it took her a long time to get to each table. The food took a really long time to get to us as well.
Prices here are really competitive, and very inexpensive for the quantity of food. Entrees are around $12-15 unlike the main strip restaurants.

This is a strong 3.5* restaurant with decent prices and food. It's not a glamorous restaurant on the strip, but I will recommend this place for a filling meal, and specially for vegans.",oNG7plVQxJsllPv4yQF0dg,0,1,3,xffcqLSSCkv-3hoPumy0Dg

4906068,2017-07-15,0,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"Great vegan eats, but service was sub-par.

I was roaming the Vegas strip late one Friday night (after midnight) and discovered that Nacho Daddy had a wide assortment of vegan options, so I had to give them a try. 

I was greeted by a friendly bartender who offered me a menu. After that, he didn't come back for quite some time because he was busy chatting with guests and co-workers. I understand that engaging with customers is great, but it took away from the quality and attentiveness of service that not only I received, but that others around me received as well. 

Everyone raves about the amazing vegan nachos, but I wanted to be a bit more daring. I ordered the vegan chick'n quesadilla and it was outstanding. The only thing that seemed slightly off was the consistency of the vegan sour cream (very watery/runny), but otherwise I loved the dish. They were very good about repeating back my order multiple times, leading me to believe that they pay attention to detail and want to ge vegan orders right. I even had a chef (or manager?) ask me if I received the vegan quesadilla, although it was a bit odd that this happened after I had finished eating. 

Back to the service. I didn't get any silverware or napkins with the meal and it took a while to get some. 

The drinks were hit and miss. The white peach margarita was very good. I hesitated due to its $13 price tag, but it was large and delicious. The house margarita was just bad. Very syrupy and too sour. I rarely leave a drink unfinished, but I couldn't even drink half of it. 

Speaking of the margarita, my bartender forgot the drink, not once, but twice. Maybe it's because it was free with my Yelp check-in? Who knows. 

The patrons next to me didn't get the best service either. They ordered a flaming drink, but the bartender never lit the tealight. There were also multiple occasions that drinks and entrees were brought to the wrong people. 

Overall, the vegan food really boosts this review, as the drinks were inconsistent and service were mediocre.",uL7KK7uGrSe2kh4GGE7CpQ,0,0,3,YHUGy214LH6nxyVLrIZYkw

Every bite was better than the last and I was in vegan queso heaven. I checked in through Yelp which presented us with a free margarita       Our waitress let us know that we could have any Margarita with $8 off if we didn't want the one they were offering for free. So of course we upgraded and grabbed two with $8 off of each drink. I'm not much of a margarita guy but I will definitely reconsider from now on. In addition to these delicious margaritas I was given a birthday shot of.....I'm sorry I forget what it was called as I became pretty tipsy by that point (I will find out later). 

Our waitress displayed exceptional customer service. She was knowledgeable, accommodating and delivered prompt service to our table.  I do not remember her name either but I'm sure she remembers us . 

There is so much to love about this place that I can't write enough about it to express my overall satisfaction. In addition to how awesome Nacho Daddy is (love the name btw) they have MULTIPLE Vegan options so that everyone can enjoy their delicious nachos.

Nachos had a great ratio of chip to toppings. They advertise ""never a dry chip"", and that was completely accurate. The group favorites were between the BBQ Chicken and the Filet Mignon nachos.

We made reservations and when we got here, the place was pretty dead (that was a hint) and then we got seated in about five minutes.  We had requested a booth from the supervisor on site and he said we will be getting one but when the host seated us, she didnt give us a booth until we asked  again.  Their communication was not all that great.  

Guest 1 - Spicy Cucumber Margarita, Lobster Tail Tacos (Drink made me sick)
My first round of spicy cucumber margarita tasted like sweet juice.  i even ate the jalapenos and they tasted like green pepper......  The second round I tried it and it was almost like the first round's spicy japaleno was forgotten on the first drink, and doubled on the second.  It made my stomach hurt and i have never experienced that before in my many spicy margaritas.  Then my food came out and the presentation was very nice.  Things tasted great but I felt like the lobster tail was very minimal.  I was not impressed at all.  Definitely overpriced for it.  

Guest 2 - White Peach Margarita, Chicken Fajitas (food made her sick)
FIrst round of white peach margaritas tasted very well, but the second round was so sweet, my coworker could not drink it.  Her food presentation was very nice but she said after her first taco, her stomach started to hurt. She barely finished her food... was not full nor buzzed.  

Guest 3 - Malibu bay breeze, shrimp fajitas
First round of her drink was very good, in a tall glass cup. Her second was downsized to HALF the size.  Her food was not cooked right and we're not sure what made her stomach hurt but even the next morning after, she was not feeling it.  

I will spare you the lack of service from our waitress who I felt like kept on kicking us out (it was very dead, and we were there for less than an hour)

The menu is definitely dedicated to the different styles and types of nachos you can get. However they do have some other options like burritos and enchiladas to choose from.

We got a Daddy Margarita (basically a house marg) and a nacho supreme with beef. The nachos were pretty good, decent sized for $19. You do have to order chips and salsa separate for $3 if you're wanting some. 

The service was meh. I felt like it took a long time and was a definite buzzkill to the frozen daiquiri I drank before.

Inside is cool - lots of different decorations like old bookshelves, western decor & much more.

Nacho Daddy is located right next to the new Buffalo Wild Wings outside and around the corner from Planet Hollywood.

Before I even get to anything I want to say that if you check in with yelp you'll get a free margarita with the purchase of an entree. They'll include the tax on the margarita in your final bill but you're still saving around $12.

The interior of the place is sports themed and they have large TV's hung everywhere around the facility, which is nice because I didn't want to miss the NBA playoffs while I was busy eating. The atmosphere is very nice and they'll also have some sports music playing in the background.

Now onto the food. The food is huge. HUGE. I shared a filet mignon nacho with my friend and we were both full from eating it. The nacho itself costs around $20 but you have to consider just how large the thing is.

The menu has definitely gotten bigger and better since then! I was definitely impressed. They have a great selection of gluten free/vegan options that sounded appetizing. And a lot of non-gluten free/vegan options for those of you who don't worry about that kinda stuff.

We were just a party of 3, my friend, my son and I. We were seated rather quickly in a big booth. Kayla was our server and brought us menus. She was absolutely wonderful from start to finish! I know we've all been out to places where the server was less than pleasant.. It really puts a damper on things. This was totally not the case with Kayla- or any of the employees. Even the guy who bought us our food and the lovely gal who was clearing our table. I'm getting ahead of myself though.

Kayla made sure we knew what Nacho Daddy was all about before leaving us to browse the menus. T Money ordered off of the kids menu- 2 plain patties Lliterally, plain.. No cheese. No bun. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Zero..) and fries. I appreciated she didn't think I was a total weirdo ordering that for my kid and she let me know I wasn't the only parent that had to do that. We had a good laugh- I seriously appreciated that because sometimes I get a weird look ordering that. I wasn't too hungry, so my friend and I ordered the trio of dips with fresh tortilla chips- Queso, guac and salsa. My friend ordered two tacos on the flour tortillas sans sides. I also ordered the Daddy margarita and a house margarita later on. 

Everything was brought out surprisingly quick. My margarita(s) were great- not too sweet either, which is just the way I like it. The guac was awesome. It was fresh and chunky. I didn't taste the queso (dairy allergy) but my friend gave it the thumbs up. And they serve it with a little tea light underneath to keep it warm and flowing. T Money's patties were a decent size. You can tell they were hand-formed and were also pretty thick. His fries came out hot and super fresh. He is legitimately the fry king and he liked them a lot. 

To be frank, I hadn't come back to Nacho Daddy after the first time because our first time kinda sucked. This more than made up for it- enough for me to want to come back and regularly frequent this joint. They have some great happy hour specials I'd like to try AND the loaded vegan/gluten free nachos look amaaaaaazing.

Unfortunately, the margarita was overwhelmingly sweet and sour mix.  Their sweet and sour is made in house and actually pretty good, but the margarita itself was not well made.  I know it was free, but if it was a true representation of their margaritas, I wouldn't get one here.

Aside from that, this is a good place to eat affordably on the strip.  It's part of the Miracle Mile Shops, but the entrance is located on the outside of the shops.  There's plenty of seating and TVs everywhere for watching whatever is on.  

As the name suggests, they have a large variety of nachos to choose from.  I couldn't decide which one to get, so I chose the Burger Nachos ($13.50) because it had a star next to it.  It had everything a burger would normally have, but tasted a lot like a taco salad.  They weren't bad, but something I could easily put together at home.  I was more impressed by my friend's enchilada nachos.  It tasted just like enchiladas, but in nacho form.

It's a cool place to go with your friends and grab a casual bite.  Just don't get the house margarita.",c_HRWeQtTIyT1ICK09C6FQ,6,4,3,e1JpBoJSTcmuU6gJeSNI9A

The food is very good and so are the prices. The service is 3 stars, but I am rating 4 stars because of the vegan menu. On my first visit, the service was friendly, but slow, although the place was not crowded. On my second visit, it was crowded and the wait staff was busy. The service was even slower than the first time. The waitress never showed up to our table. Thankfully, another waiter saw the hungry look on our faces and realized that we had been waiting 20 minutes and had not even placed a drink order. The waiter that was not assigned to our table went out of his way to make sure that our orders were taken and that we got our food. Overall, I like the food and the atmosphere.

Something unexpected - as my wife has a very restricted diet , they have TONS of vegan options .  An added bonus for us !

5200452,2018-04-19,1,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"Vegan/Vegetarian review: 4.5 stars

           Eating vegan on the Vegas strip is not an easy feat. After shuffling through tons of eateries on the strip, Nacho Daddy seemed relatively centralized, appetizing, and decently priced. So I and a couple of meat eaters ventured over to the joint as it was my turn to pick a place where I had more to eat than a lousy salad and fries.
Sure enough, Nacho Daddy provided an extensive vegan menu of nachos, burritos, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, fajitas, and salad bowls that left me at a lost as to what to pick from this massive list.

Not being a risk taker, we played it safe and got:

Vegan Chicken Nachos - 4.5/5
        Traditionally loaded, with everything you could possibly think that would go on nachos, came on this dish...
Protein (marinated chickn), beans, guac, pico de gallo, salsa, bell peppers, roasted corn, onions, mushrooms, and vegan queso with spinach chips (nothing special)
        The chickn taste like store bought gardein strips. While not unique, I'm still grateful!  The cheeze is decent, and all the fixings were pretty good all together. It's nachos, so while it's easy to make delicious, it's hard to stand out!  As a vegan dish, the true test is the ""cheese"", and its flavor and texture. Although I knew it wasn't real cheese, it was still pretty tasty and a decent sized portion was given. My only ding is the lack luster vegan chicken. 

Fillet Mignon Nachos (GF) - 3.5/5
          A little less loaded on these guys... These house made standard tortilla chips are loaded with beef, refried beans, sour cream, ranchero sauce, guac, pico de gallo, and a mixture of cheese.
          The meat eaters said that the fillet mignon pieces were scarce and a bit dry. They even admitted that the vegan chicken version looked more appetizing. XD But, they said theirs was still decent, because who doesn't like nachos!?  Haha

I had to go down in rating on their behalf, but stuck with the 5 stars for the massive vegan menu (despite not being a vegan place), not charging extra for the 'vegan' title, generous amount of food, and friendly service, although a bit slow. 

I need you guys to be in business when I visit,  so 5 stars it is :D",ORyW9PcAUtOT3ksstADyyw,4,2,5,OXbXLP0lquQYRel_0IjyHg

The menu was vast with so many surf, turf and vegan options I couldn't decide what to order. The first person to give me some warm feedback was Jovany. His honest opinions were so refreshing and ordered the Sizzling Shrimp Tacos without any hesitations. Then, he was delighted we were from OC and gave us two Nacho Daddy shot glasses on the house.

The chicken was seasoned really nicely but everything else about it was average. I'm kind of a cheese snob so I expect a Mexican restaurant to not use cheddar on any of their dishes but that's just a personal preference. Maybe if they threw some queso fresco on their salad and I had a few of their margaritas I would be more in love with it. 
Price wise it's a little expensive for what you get but considering it's a very touristy area I think they are priced about right. 
The bar tender was very attentive, 5 stars for the service. My water was empty a lot, but between the combination of her being SUPER busy and me being SUPER thirsty, it's nothing to get upset over.

Until we saw reviews, we really wanted to check it out. Came here for lunch only to get their nachos to-go. We ordered 3 of their nachos to take back to our hotel for a party of 8. 

* Ordered: 
- Filet Mignon nachos (5/5 stars): As soon as we got our order & had to wait for our uber driver to pick us up.... we completely finished this entire box between 4 of us before uber even got to us! LOL! We had to order another box. The mixed fish, cheese, & salsa make this a good combo with chips.

- Seafood nachos (3/5 stars): This was our least favorite, but was still finished by the end of the day. I think the mango was too fresh that it didn't taste as well with the seafood & my cousin agreed.

- Fiesta nachos (4/5 stars): This was our 2nd favorite. Packed with meat, cheese, & colorful chips. Definitely looks like a fiesta in a box. There was a lot of meat in this one.

Missed out on the full sports bar & drinks but they do serve happy hour, gear, & games to participate to win in! All 3 boxes were good for a party of 8.

On my first visit my waitress was very apologetic and even took it out of our bill.  ...On my third visit I brought 2 other friends. Again I ordered breakfast, vegetarian omelet and was also specific, egg whites no cheese.   I again was given cheese on my eggs.  ...So here's my final follow up review, overall the food is great. It is on the greasy side but great food and great atmosphere.  Orders with specific changes however seem to get lost.  I wanted to give you 3 stars but because my first visit was so exceptional that I gave you the extra star.",pMB4fZGQ1BToR23-kXohqQ,0,0,4,Adq-cQ3zRXySUVEJdoXBew

5310702,2018-05-16,1,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"I must say, I do not know why my fiancee and I waited soooo long to go here. We finally went on Tuesday afternoon around 2pm in the afternoon. Place is located on Harmon Ave. Right next door to the Hot N Juicy restaurant, and near the Miracle Mile shops. Surprisingly, place was not packed knowing that is on the Strip. You will be able to find parking, not unless you park in the Miracle Mile garage. 

Cool little spot on the strip. You will not get much of this, but they have outside patio dining, inside with table top and booth seating. They even have souvenirs if you are dropping in from out of town. 

We were seated right away, and given a huge menu to take a look at. Looking through the menu: they have awesome appetizers for sharing, entree, combination plates, desserts, long list of alcohol, and nachos galore. Of course, they are known mostly for their nachos, free margaritas if you check in on yelp, and their scorpion shots. 

What we ordered: the triple dip appetizer (queso, salsa, and house made guacamole), filet mignon nachos, and the ultimate enchilada (comes with beans and rice). Wait time was perfect since we were hungry enough to order appetizers this time. If not, you may want to come when you are extremely hungry or craving good mexican food.

The appetizer, queso was evenly seasoned with the perfect amount of spice. Guacamole had good amount of lime, onion, and has been one of the best that I have tasted in awhile. Salsa, was good all around. Now, do not let the pictures fool you. The filet mignon nachos is good to share for two. But, I was able to finish by myself (this has never happened before)! Loved the chili, salsa white sauce guacamole and cheese mix. One bite to just a few more is not enough!! You will want to keep eating. The enchiladas filled up my fiancee and he eats big. Again, do not let the size fool you.

Unfortunately, so we were both full, we did not get to try the dessert. We will soon be back. Thanks Nacho Daddy for the awesome food, service, and atmosphere.",pa8zvcFxnj6jFtywlxKf_g,1,2,4,A4AS0d5Xt7vfgMF5AwjnJQ

Nacho Daddy is tucked away on Harmon just outside of the Miracle Mile shops with street/sidewalk access only (a little hard to find at first.) They have a separate vegan menu section and use Gardein chick'n product (optional) in their vegan quesadilla, fajitas, burrito and nachos. Kudos to Nacho Daddy for making their vegan cheese (cheddar style) in-house -- it was delicious. I had four meals here spanning my week in Vegas; thus, I tried several vegan meals, and all were delicious. I highly recommend the vegan burrito and vegan chick'n nachos (huge portion for $16.50). I like hot/spicy ... and be warned their hot salsa is definitely ""hot."" On the downside, their is a large aquarium at the front entrance which houses large, disgusting black scorpions. Clue to Nacho Daddy: This is more disgusting than cute. Perhaps a health hazard and certainly and stomach-churning site for some. You're doing so many things right (include the large screen TVs) ... why be ""cute"" with the live scorpions?

Navigation issues aside, my Vegan Fajita Salad was much tastier than I expected it to be. The vegan chick'n was marinated in flavorful spices. Nice touch with the grill marks too. The pico de gallo and guacamole were fairly mediocre. The fajita pepper & onions added heartiness to the romaine lettuce. But the real standout ingredient was the onion thyme vinaigrette.

I started with a white peach margarita and it was SO good! I had to restrain from chugging the whole thing right away. My husband got the blood orange margarita and it was good too (a little tart for my liking). I then tried another margarita that was one of their specials. I don't remember the exact name, but it was something sunrise related? It had fresh raspberries and agave. It was delicious! And these margaritas are enormous! 

My husband and I shared the appetizer street tacos. We got the lobster and crab variety. They're served in doubled corn tortillas and with a delicious corn salsa. So yummy! 

I ordered the supreme tostado nachos. Seasoned ground beef, shredded cheese, yellow queso, refried beans, pico de gallo, fried jalapeños, lettuce, avocado lime salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  Amazing! Honestly we probably could've shared these as well. It's a HUGE portion! 

My husband got taco-enchilada combo with chicken on both. I personally would've ordered the mojo pork simply because I prefer pork, but I tried a piece of the chicken and it was very good! Super tender and juicy and very flavorful! 

They lose a star because we waited a substantial amount of time for our food to come out. And our appetizer came at the same time as our entrees. We also received our food after the people next to us even though we ordered before them. Not the end of the world, but I'm talking 30 minutes we waited.

I got the BBQ pork nachos. They were OFF THE CHAIN. PLENTY of nachos! Great tasting BBQ sauce. Pork was perfectly tender and covering all of the nachos as they claim. The cheese hit it all off wonderfully. I got a pomegranate margarita; it tasted great and was very potent, loved it.

My wife and I split a fried ice cream dessert. It was certainly ON POINT.

First of all, the name says it all it's NOT YO DADDY (and not yo daddy's nacho). I'm almost 100% positive that anyone that likes this place is 1 of 3 things. 1. Drunk and sunburnt on the brain. 2. A person who literally has never been to a movie theater (and had waaayyy better nachos for half the price). 3. Someone who doesn't even know hat nachos are supposed to be. Heck, try Cheesecake Factory appetizer nachos (those are actually really good and Cheaper), try Taco Bell nachos, or the nachos from del taco, you'll have a better result. Instead of putting your soggy Costco chips covered with dry flavorless chicken and NO toppings (e.g. Sour cream, salsa, etc.), why don't you just close your business and sell it to Starbucks so it can benefit us (and yes I know there is a Starbucks already right around the corner in the Elara lobby). Worst nachos ever. And why put nachos in a cardboard pizza box for ""to go"" purposes? They must not have tested that. Try walking to your room in PH, Elara, or Grand Chateau with these things and see how warm they are. Oh nice touch to have the cardboard stuck to the melted cheese... FYI if it's not in-n-out, I don't want cheese paper or any other type of container stuck to my food.

I will say this. After 10+ hours of reflection, I have some additions. Their management (Taylor) is very profesional and seems to genuinely care about the business doing a proper job. So credit (and the 1 forced star that Yelp demands) goes to her and her staff. If the food prep staff was as professional, perhaps my review would have been a bit different. Nevertheless the Decor in the establishment is nice and appropriate for what they must be paying for a rental space in a center strip view Vegas hotel.

I know it was the holidays when we came but it was a really long wait for the host to come. I get the holidays and such but there were servers and bartenders looking at us and no one could even acknowledge or say hold on a second that sort of killed my vibe.

They have cute stuff like #getstung if you down get the scorpion shot.

I got the crab and lobster enchilada  and it was just okay when I had the meat without the anything else it sort of tasted meh like just defrosted. The rice was really good and so was the queso.




LOVEEEE ME SOME GOOD QUESO.

My boyfriend got the mojo pork tacos and it was really meaty and juicy but I really wish it had more seasoning it was missing something.

also they offer a margarita when you do yelp check in and that was pretty good.",wU9ykgSWO0f3QMW83n3Y9Q,0,0,3,TtNYA61RrJvqB3H3uLu7MA

The menu was pretty extensive with a variety of nacho, taco, enchilada and fajitas choices.  After looking over the menu I decided to go with the filet mignon and shrimp fajitas. This place is known for its scorpion shot which features a real scorpion. I wasn't feeling that adventurous so I went with the Cadillac Margarita instead. The margarita was good and made with house made sweet and sour and premium liquor. The fajitas were served table side sizzling and what you would expect from a spot like Daddy Nacho. The filet was tender with a good portion of shrimp mixed with peppers, onions, jalapeños and cherry tomatoes. I was particularly pleased with the side of rice, refried beans, guacamole, lettuce and pickled onions that accompanied the fajitas. Overall a good spot that I'll be sure to visit again.

The nachos are bomb, don't get me wrong and the Yelp Check-In to get you a free margarita was cool...but the service wasn't as great. 

Let's talk about the food first. We all got nachos, you have to get the nachos, why would you get anything else at..Nacho Daddy. The plates you can easily share with two people but no. We all got our own plates = bad idea. The plates were good and I do recommend sharing since it is big. Or just go in there hungry cause we did and we finished our plates...again bad idea LOL.

We checked in with Yelp to get our free margarita and that was great...till the bill came. I know couple places that do this and if you don't check your receipts or they hear that you're on a business trip, they add on random things on your bill. Please always check your bill before you pay cause our waitress did not take off the drinks even though she knows it was FREE. She handed the bill to us not checking if it is correct?! So when we waved her down, we told her all three of us didn't get that taken off the bill, her response didn't seem like it was the first time she seen it happen. It sounded like ""I hope they don't realize I didn't take it off their bill"".

I'm now talking to another HR person Peter who  wants to hear my experience at nachodaddy also. I'm very impressed how quickly they responded to my Yelp review and my email and my call.

This world where everyone's favorite food group (that's right, FOOD GROUP) is not only featured, but the focus of their menu. How awesome is that? Could it get more awesome? Yes it could (if they put one in Reno) being in Vegas is pretty amazing! 

Located right outside The Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood it is pretty convenient, especially if you're in the shopping or Nacho mood. Patio seating with an aircraft hangar style door, also a great centrally located industrial concrete bar, and warm sunlight (in case it happens to be a cold day, as it was for us). 

Because we seemingly don't know how to settle for a stock off the menu selection we went with the Supreme Tostada Nacho, but asked for the pico on the side and also a side of the enchilada sauce, but without the lettuce (cause that did seem weird, right?). First, how awesome was the bartender? They brought out our order and he immediately noticed the presence of lettuce and threw up the stop sign. All apologies, it was returned to the kitchen and a fresh prepped replacement was brought shortly thereafter. Second, these were the best nachos ever!!!! Ermergosh! Such a great blend of flavors and I was halfway through the order, before I remembered we had the sides. Unfortunately, I had waited so long that the enchilada sauce had cooled before I got to it, because I'm sure warmer would have been better (still pretty good). 

I digress, let me finish this thing. Aside from amazing nachos, the bar hosts plenty of tequila (as they should), some decent beer (some local), and a friendly, smiling, engaging, conversational, smart, fun staff.

When I visited Nacho Daddy with two others we ordered: The Moco Loco Nachos, Lobster & Crab Enchiladas and Chicken Tamale. The table favorite was the Moco Loco Nachos. It was so delicious that I stopped eating my own plate (enchiladas) to eat this plate more!

To start off, our server was fantastic! She was so patient, friendly, and obviously knew the menu very well. She was happy to answer our questions and honor the yelp check in for a free house margarita. 

The menu is quite large! There's gotta be some item for everyone. We ordered the four cheese nachos, the mexi-Cali burger, a chicken tamale, and the breakfast tacos. Everything was served hot and looked presentable. My tacos were bomb!! Their rice was a little dry and bland so you may need to throw some hot sauce on it. Their nachos are really good!

I had the triple dip (I believe it's called) and Filet Mignon Nachos. The spicy salsa tastes much like plain tomato salsa with some jalapeño peppers on top to make it spicy. The queso dip wasn't bad but the guacamole tasted like smashed avocados with nothing else added.
I thought the steak on the nachos would have a grilled flavor and there would be a little more of it.

The server was absolutely amazing! Rachel was very helpful in deciding what to order from drinks to apps to meals. We settled on the queso and salsa for a start and the presentation was very unique and fun! They put a tea candle underneath the dip to keep it warm. This allowed them to have a higher cheese ratio because it never cooled down, making for a tremendous queso dip! Probably on the the best I have ever had. (And I make a great one at home)

For our main meal we had tacos, bowls, and burritos. The kids meals were plentiful and varied. The kids tacos were huge and my 9yr old could barely finish it.
The adult pork tacos almost busted at the seems with the delicious shredded Carnitas. The unique chicken Thai tacos were sweet savory and spicy, and will be reordered when we go back again this trip. My wife had the Thai chicken bowl and it was similar to the tacos but varied enough to mention. With the corn in the bowl it added a sweetness that really complimented the dish. The beef burrito was so big my 12yr old son took half back to the hotel with him.

For drinks the house margaritas are wonderful. They aren't too sweet and you can still taste some of the tequila. Bonus points for being served in mason jars!

I have to reiterate that our server was the best part. She helped us order to be sure we didn't repeat thing were were getting like chips and salsa and queso. She was engaging, enthusiastic and charming. You could see how she cared about her customers happiness.

Service was ok, just a bit slow at times but understandable since our party had about 18 people all putting in various orders at various times, and only one server, MJ. She did a great job handling all of us. Billing was perfect, no issues there.

I had the beer battered lobster tacos, that came with a side of rice and side of beans....standard fare. The tacos were tasty, loaded with salsa that almost overwhelmed the entire dish. I wish the lobster would have been a bit larger so it balanced out all the lettuce and salsa better.

5789016,2018-01-26,0,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"Every time I come to Vegas, Nacho Daddy is one of the first stops I make. And I always end up going multiple times! It's conveniently located on the corner of Harmon and S Las Vegas Blvd. Plenty of tables, bar seating, and easy to find.

If you're going on a weekend, they're open 24 hours and it's a perfect place to get late night munchies! During the regular week, they're open until 2am, which is still pretty nice.

Their drinks are hard core legit. There are plenty of pamphlets and coupons around the strip and at your concierge desk for BOGO or a free margarita and they're pretty famous for them. I like the fruitier ones like blueberry, strawberry, and mango. But their classic is a classic for a reason. And they are HUGE. They are also known for their scorpion shots, which has a pickled scorpion in a shot of tequil. never tried one, but I'm sure it's a real conversation starter. They also have a full bar, so no matter what you're in the mood for, they can probably do it. But you have to have a margarita at lwast once here.

Secondly, their NACHOS. They do not disappoint their namesake. Literally not a dry chip! all the cheese mixtures they use are so perfect and melt evenly on the chips. They have a number of meats and other toppings too, but I've yet to have a flavor combo that goes wrong. Last time we were here, we got the filet mignon golden knight nachos and it was heavenly.

We've also been here before for breakfast! I got the churro pancake. it was MASSIVE, came with syrup and caramel sauce, and had a hidden lining of churros and cinnamon toadt crunch. Honestly, it was a gluttonous feast. I didn't finish it though. My husband got the huevos rancheros and it was perfect. Corn tortilla slathered in eggs, cheese, salsa. The guac on the side was great too.

Some other great things about this place-- staff is always super friendly, there are a ton of TVs that are always playing music videos (sometimes hip hop, sometimes throwbacks, always fun), and they have a scorpion tank in the front of house. Best part is you get a quality experience for a quality price.

I. Love. Nacho. Daddy.",KFFg3owYflKqEGOUz81FoQ,2,0,5,B5tTVx_1c4iX-pzPBpnmSg

I came back to Phoenix bragging that I ate a Centruroides scorpion and didn't get stung... my toxicology friends corrected me and pointed out the type I swallowed actually is not a Bark Scorpion and am not quite as cool as that (apparently the shape of the tail was the clue).  Our group took the shots together, and one of my friends made the mistake of chewing the little bugger... don't do that.

Margaritas were excellent, nachos were killer (one of the best bangs for your buck in Vegas - try the shrimp or the filet mignon nachos!), but honestly the service was even better.  Audre was our hostess and was absolutely amazing.  We actually came back a second night during our week-long stay to take more scorpion shots, mainly because of the friendly atmosphere.  It feels like a nice local bar in a small town, and it's able to avoid the flashiness that covers the rest of Vegas.

The second time was the polar opposite. We were seated quickly which is the only plus unfortunately. It took about 10 minutes for the server to even acknowledge we were here. By the time she came, we all knew what we wanted. It took maybe 25 minutes to get our food after ordering despite the fact that it wasn't busy (Monday evening).

At one point our waitress vanished and I couldn't get a water refill, but when she was on point, she was very on point. Side note- she was very cute and had a rocking hair cut. Anyway, randomly picked Nacho Daddy for a night out with my friends after we finished our conference responsibilities for the trip and we wanted nothing more than to get away from the conference center and down the strip for some food (and refreshments for my friends, which I passed on). The waitress gave great recommendations. Between the four of us we got the cheese enchiladas, the filet mignon nachos, lobster tacos, mini fish tacos, and the Mexican corn. I had the corn and the fish tacos. 

The corn was tasty but not the best I've had -it was very, very light on the cojita cheese, and the seasoning was only on side of the corn, and barely had any crema. Elote is one of my favourite foods, so I was a tad disappointed. The fish tacos were tasty, I liked the mango salsa. My friends enjoyed their food and drinks as well. The servings were humongous, and the prices were reasonable- and it must have been happy hour because my tacos were discounted. I asked about the Yelp check in but it was after we ordered and apparently we didn't have the right kind of margarita, but definitely take them up on that, it's a great offer. 

Would definitely try the nachos if I were to ever return, I just felt like getting something with more protein than cheese (full disclosure, I'm pescetarian- I did like the option of the vegan menu but wanted to try two smaller menu items instead. Would try them in the future if I were to return though!).

She was so informed about the menu and her recommendations were spot on. I loved the kale salad and hope they keep that on the menu for a long time. It was perfect. I don't need to eat fat on fat in Vegas everyday, so Nacho Daddy was perfect. The nachos were AWESOME! Generous portions and a real value for the Strip. I also liked the coffee. They serve French Press. So I was able to get three cups out of it and feel like I was awake after a long night staying up. I highly recommend this place and it's a great place to relax and get off the beaten path. Everyone at the restaurant was attentive and friendly. Huge plus, the place is extremely clean and spacious!! Thank you Nacho Daddy!!",Jd49KV7wo5eHrDMnvRMFfQ,0,0,5,zNuWlgiZeHEBceFQdvtAHw

We ordered the chip trio (queso, spinach & artichoke dip & salsa). Absolutely fantastic! Great service, food & environment.

5957366,2017-03-12,0,QXV3L_QFGj8r6nWX2kS2hA,"I while I am tempted to say, ""I've never met a nacho I didn't like"", that would be untrue - I am a picky nacho eater. I am passionate about my nachos and Nacho Daddy did not disappoint! The nacho menu options were broad and included both traditional and more interesting toppings. I ordered the Supreme Taco Nachos, which our excellent server Ryan ""spiced up"" by adding hot salsa and extra jalapeños! The ratio of toppings to chips was good with the toppings distributed throughout the chips so there were very few plain chips. The toppings were not too wet which helped avoid ""chip sog"". Thumbs up to the nachos!

In addition to nachos, the Nacho Daddy menu offered lots of choices including delicious-looking appetizers, soups, salads, tacos, burros, enchiladas and more. The drink options, including a full bar, also added to the enjoyment.
 
We will definitely return...perhaps tonight!",tja4z5O1WnsAAkKcdSDg6Q,0,0,5,95bDBxfDmF_iAREWpKAzdw

I live in Vegas and had family in town, they picked this spot. You can guarantee that I will be back, even as a local resident in Vegas. Had a really great experience! It is easy to leave a negative review, but the positive ones are harder to come by. Just wanted to share my experience in the hopes it helps others.",Ir52M7Y5G5T1tTlotAQFSQ,0,0,5,i0hEj9PXrlxCFuIFxXYJkg

We are visiting from LA and decided to try some new spots. I definitely recommend this place! And thank you to Jovanny for taking care of us and our 1 year old while we dined here! We tried the Vegan Loaded Nachos and Filet Mignon Nachos.. both were very yummy! Both had a good spicy kick as well. Also tried the House Margarita, not overly strong and very tasty.",gVZagbXcx6ElS-uCkStOUQ,0,0,5,cOLp1JLiwQj4aWYXwud3-Q

Matt waited on us today and he didn't check back on us one time after food was delivered. I finished my tacos and never got hot sauce. .  That being said, the ambiance is cool and margaritas are decent but not strong at all.  We will try again and hope for better service.",wXOlHcc_2jhGynzJKilguw,0,0,3,IdbjCbIyfWcpYICoNzWuhg

We ordered margaritas and the dip trio to start.. salsa and gauc were both okay but the queso was thebomb.com... (do people still say that!?)  Anyway, I ordered the surf and turf tacos (steak and lobster) and they were both awesome.  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals too- most ordered nachos (obviously!)..

Let's talk about  it. I am a local and came in for happy hour and obviously set at the bar. The bartender her name started with a C and she was Caucasian with dreads. She literally distributes the worst customer service known to man. We had to ask repeatedly for water, our alcohol drinks and sour cream. She didn't care; she was in her own rude world. I felt neglected as a customer; she made cynical comments like ""I work for tips"" etc. I complained to the host and asked for a manager but one never came over. Just avoid this location . Please note it wasn't busy and we received no silverware !",6f6qNWoCEHkVmvId8U9lCg,2,1,1,jyPPAotUqzhOXUIZsZc-wA
