169385,2015-08-03,0,mXtcO2phv1wYcI_OhL6D9g,Siam Thai's food is very flavorful but the cook was too heavy handed with the spice level. We asked for 1 on their scale of 5; we got a 3. (I can eat it but my sister could not finish her share.) Reading other reviews it appears the cook is not consistent with the spice. No one wants something they've paid for to be so hot it's inedible. Other Thai restaurants do a better job of cooking to their scale. I thought the prices were fair and our take out order came quickly. The owner seems like a nice lady. She expressed her concern that they are not as busy as they thought they would be so I wish her luck. My sister & I won't be back; not a good match for our desired style of Thai.,Nro2yW4LlfaQUCqnz35rxg,0,1,2,dNPzVAKtfB4sEuqpPw_GDg

I pulled over and immediately came to yelp looking for reviews and was happy with so many positives.  I parked and asked if I could see a menu since my children were asleep in the car.  They quickly handed me one and I began figuring out what I wanted to order.  I drive up to the window and placed my order and began to wait. 

I was handed a cup of ice water while I waited and thought that was nice of them... Now I know why.  My order of veggie pad Thai and fried egg rolls took 25 or so minutes!  I didn't mind waiting too much since my children were napping and needed the sleep.  When the girl delivers my order I was told I should have called in since tonight was busy... As I drove off I decide to check it and see I only got four egg rolls when the menu says five pcs.  I drive back and asked about it and was given attitude.  Basically I was told all their regulars knew it was only four pieces and the menu board said four pieces so I should have known it was four even though the menu they gave me minutes before I ordered said five.  After that I asked for a refund of the egg rolls as I didn't appreciate being blamed for their mistake and me not knowing the correct amount.  We came to an agreement that I would get one more egg roll and no refund.  I saw the woman put something in the microwave and was hoping that was not my egg roll.  She checked out the to go menus and made a comment that now she will have to change the menus and I'm the only one who has ever had a problem with it.  She then went out to the menu board and came back and said that the menu board and the non to go menus all say four and that they will give me an extra egg roll this time but wouldn't next time.  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?????  She acted as if I was trying to screw them over  (one egg roll mind you) and it was all my fault.  At that point I was done.   I told them I wanted a refund and handed back the food.  Basically 30 minutes wasted and no food to show for it.  I was really looking forward to supporting a local business tonight, but with so much attitude and blame on a customer, that didn't happen.  I'm a very honest person and was not rude to them in any way.  If the menu I'm handed says five pieces I expect to see five pieces.  There was no reason for them to be rude to me in any way over this.  Needless to say, I will not be back.",xwMEIW_-uzPn9bX4C1I8jA,2,0,1,o8fKEUGmRoBjQyreOlnYgw

Actually kind of nice if you order takeout you don't even have to get out of your car. But we were eating in tonight. Decor is minimal but clean. Ordered pad kee mao and spicy basil with chicken. Both at a heat level 2. I like spicy but since we haven't been here before we decided to play it safe. So glad we did. Most places this heat level would be a 4. Any spicier and it would have been too hot. But both dishes were delicious. Fresh veggies, white meat chicken and freshly cooked with the veggies still crisp tender. Very good. Service was very good but we were the only ones dining in so I wouldn't expect less. Our water glasses stayed full. We will definitely be back.",CjTgCaIc__WF6MoPGCbQqA,0,0,4,Hj47mxOgct48bMAEJHbUZw

I found this place couple months ago and have been coming here very often ever since. It is quite a drive from where I live but their consistent food quality, reasonable prices and friendly services are well worth it. I haven't tried everything on the menu but so far my favorites and recommendations to you are the papaya salad, pineapple fried rice, tom yum soup and chicken prik king. Their portions are generally bigger than most Thai places while the prices are approximately the same or cheaper. Also, their Thai Iced Tea Bucket is an amazing deal: a giant cup of delicious Thai tea for only $5. Try it and you won't regret it! :)",HRZUIaX5fW85du-g5IiPsw,0,0,5,N49LOOJVh6wZ3u_8Hki6Ig

They have thai tea for only $2.50. It is as good as any I've had. 

Curry was really good. I ordered it spicy level 5 because I wanted to hallucinate from eating thai peppers. Did not disappoint, I am tripping balls on how hot it was. Probably shouldn't have driven home, but there's no breathalyzer for thai tea and ghost pepper.

Only thing that was a little odd was they charged extra for extra rice. I kind of thought that was like bread at any other restaurant. But whatever, compared to the other stuff around here, this place was amazing.",zcmCg2nsT0pBinXiVEA5Wg,0,0,5,8aNo5i2jV8Xnt1QINZRy2w

Haven't tried that method yet, but called in an order for pick up and it was ready in a very-reasonable 15 minutes. Pricing is mostly pretty good, but I found the $8/bowl tom kha a bit steep- portion size was good but can't imagine what a large must look like or how they pack it to go.

Garlic black pepper chicken dish, spice level 3, is quite good- served with an ample portion of white rice, well priced at about $10. Lunch specials really are the way to go though, at $7/ea with several entree choices, plus soup or salad, egg roll, and won ton.

However, the last two times have been excessive for the wait time, and today will be the last time we ever go there.  The food is decent, as I said, but for the price, you can actually go down the street for better ambiance and much faster service.

We literally sat in the car waiting for the order of pad thai, potstickers, and fried banana with sweet sticky rice for 45 minutes!!!  Many times I thought, ""This is ridiculous.  Let's just go.""  But after you've paid and made the time investment, if you leave, you will still be hungry, so we continued to wait.  

When we ordered, she said it would be a few minutes longer, but she should have been very clear about what that meant.  It wasn't until 30 min of waiting and rang the buzzer that she told me there was a large order right before ours and that it would be five more minutes.  15 minutes later, our food was finally presented, along with two free cans of Coke and an apology.  Gee, what a generous offer.  Plus, we don't drink sodas.  She offered two bottles of water instead and apologized and said one of the chefs was out sick and didn't show.

Well, I understand staffing problems.  The biggest problem I have with what occurred is that she should have been honest at the beginning and said that it would be 45 mins before we could get our order due to staff shortage, large orders, etc.  I would have accepted that and chosen a different place that would fit my schedule.  But this seemed to be dishonest and greedy, as I had already paid and included a tip and was stuck sitting at an empty drive-through window.

Do not appreciate the way it was handled, felt very insulted by the offer of Cokes at the END of the 45-minute wait, and will not be going back.",oCvta34TPCZXuvRHJgPSvA,1,0,2,w_MnpG1ctogv6Ppp0I-OXQ

There were not  many people in the restaurant yet we had to ask for service. Twice. We ordered a dinner for two. The chicken skewers were ok but perhaps a bit dry.  The soup was awful. It was full of lemongrass bits that were hard like pieces of wood. And I know lemongrass is a flavoring but for heavens sake, there must have been 30 little rounds of tough lemongrass floating there that was hard to avoid and got in my teeth. The server just shrugged and  didn't even offer a replacement or an apology. I sent it back less than half eaten. My friends soup didn't have so many bits of lemongrass. The rice was a bit more sticky than I am used to but I actually liked that.  and the chicken stir fried with broccoli was very fresh and tasty  but the pad Thai was barely ok and also rather dry.

The walls are pretty beige with thoughtful welcoming symbols and sayings you are always greeted with such a beautiful culture. 
And quite lovely food. Although a quick place served in not so fancy to go containers, Siam Thai infamous Thai Drive thru window, the presentation is always quite lovely and pleasing. 
I am a fan of panang and pad Thai. 
I don't eat a lot of meat but the seafood here is fair weather. So be a little adventurous. The price tag is fair. The food is fast.  The service is endearing and more than adequate. I love the chatter and everyone is very happy. 
Siam Thai is more than a safe bet. Its definitely a staple of quick and easy food that is satisfying and guilt free in most cases of you skip dessert :)

We got the appetizer platter tonite.

Looked at a couple places in the area and stumbled into this hut like restaurant. First impression:  Teeny tiny little dining area kinda like a small apartment and the kitchen is the next room over. Husband is a big guy, offensive line man big so he looked like a giant sitting at one of their tables - We giggled while he tried to delicately spoon the sweet and sour sauce from the cute dish onto crab rangoons with the teeny little spoon provided. The menu is good with basics and some nice additions like mango sticky rice for dessert and thai coffee. The food is really tasty; pad thai was on point, took me back to my vacation in Phuket. Green curry we asked for shrimp and they did not disappoint, there were at least 10 good sized shrimp in the regular serving. Chicken satay was freshly grilled in the room next door, delicious and not dry like some places. What really struck us was the cleanliness, this place sparkles! Service was fast attentive and friendly. The only thing I didn't like, and this sounds odd, but there wasn't any music playing or any background noise. With a place this tiny you can hear yourself breath and your partner making mouth noises you wouldn't normally notice!

We ordered Tom Yum w/shrimp, Pad Pak w/beef, Pad Thai (authentic-finally!!), Garlic Pepper w/Chicken (fantastic), Papaya Salad, and Mango Sticky Rice (so yummy).  I didn't realize the Mango Sticky Rice was a dessert but I'm so glad other people recommended it because it was delicious.  I just ate it for breakfast a few minutes ago.  
  
The Tom Yum with Shrimp was very tasty and was slightly sweet which is different than I've ever had.  My only complaint is that nothing was as spicy as I like.  I ordered everything 4 and 5 out of 5.  Most new places I go to don't make the food as fiery spicy as I like it because they are used to the wimpy people (j/k) who can't handle spicy food.  I'll just let them know I want it like much spicier next time.  The owner IS incredibly sweet and we are looking forward to going back. 

They don't have a website so I'll post pictures of their menu that you can hopefully read.  I never take pictures of my food, sorry.

UPDATE: I'm sad to report that we ordered from here a few more times and the food seems to be inconsistent. The last time everything we ordered was under-seasoned and bland (pad woon-sen, pad thai, garlic pepper chicken, tom yum soup and curry) and NOTHING was spicy even though I ordered 4 out of 5 and 5's on a few things. I thought Thai restaurants had Thai chili peppers that can be added to make things spicy. I was very disappointed in the quality of seasoning and lack of flavor this last time.

okay as of right now, the food and prices are great! even portions are great.
just what they should be. so far food has been hot every time & i swear they have the best sticky rice & thai iced tea.

but! the only reason im taking away a star is the customer service. the owner truly doesnt understand what that is. she is rude and i almost didnt go back over her. 
the young kid that works there makes up for it though. always a smile and always fun.

Don't be put off by the tiny building, drive thru, or spartan design of the interior. 

-Very clean. The tables and chairs are spotless, and the staff clearly takes care to keep the place tidy.

-Simple menu. 30 or so items, clearly labelled. You'll find what you want quickly.

-Good prices. About twice as much as fast food, but easily four times as good.

-The FOOD. I'm a fan of pad thai, so I fell back on a favorite. I was not disappointed. The 'medium' heat spice is surprisingly spicy, however its one of the few times that the extra heat added to the taste, and not just 'hot' like sauce packets. I'll go mild next time, but I definitely boxed up the remaining for later. Enjoyed every bite. My girlfriend had the yellow curry. I make a curry dish myself, and sadly I think I may end up making it a great deal less now. The curry had a nice heat and flavor to it, and lended well to the fluffy rice and chicken. We both had Thai Iced Tea as well, and it went perfectly with the heat of the food.

-Staff was friendly, refilled water regularly, and checked on us often enough without being overbearing. I overheard them speaking with what was likely a family friend, and at least the handful of things they mentioned were made in house, not purchased or frozen.

Overall, I was super happy, full, and pleased that this place is only a couple blocks up the road.",A3XEzfHKeIw-Dt_t1z5SMw,1,0,5,t9fB6zYcnC1R5Sg5ocFQmQ

I grt there and they no longer have the bbq chicken on their menu at all. I was disappointed with that but I decided to order the spicy basil beef (spicy 3) it was really good and flavorful. The lunch special shows 6.99 for chicken, pork, and beef items and an extra 3.00 for shrimp.  When I ordered the spicy basil beef  she tells me it's an additional 1.00 for beef, ground beef. I was taken back from that but hey I was there already and hungry. I open the container and the lunch special comes with an vegetable egg roll, won ton, and salad. The won ton was good, the egg roll was soggy in the inside and the salad had no dressing, just lettuce and carrots and I paid the extra 1.00 and there wasn't even a great amount of the beef.
