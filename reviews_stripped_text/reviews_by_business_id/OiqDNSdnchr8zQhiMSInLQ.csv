22955,2014-07-24,0,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,Wonderful! Very authentic japanese soba shop. Really a great find in sin city. They even have the soba yu at the end to drink the sauce. I had the tempura zaru soba. Great! Tempura was crispy and the soba cold.

It's a very small and cozy restaurant, where you can quietly enjoy your meal--in contrast to the hyper and distracting atmosphere of other Japanese joints I've visited here in Vegas. There is only one server but she did a good job being attentive to us despite having 75% tables full. I must say, before writing this review I came across a few recent reviews of yelpers being very critical of the service...it's unfortunate some yelpers feel entitled to bash a hard working server without first knowing their circumstances or give one star claiming the owner should hire additional server (despite admitting food is good) without first understanding the challenges small business owners face to stay afloat. It's a shame some people thrive on negativity, instead of being more supportive of great small businesses like this I-naba.",yXCdwFGDsVvMffSHPgxyrg,1,0,5,jUH5L7i3uxnf_da63p4udA

My kids udon was good, not great, but mine was disappointing.  Fishy and salty. My husband's vegetable tempura udon was the best of all of the soups. 

Service was so slow that our appetizers came out after our main dishes. After asking our waiter he said they are making it now.  Wow really!!!  I should have noticed earlier that a party of 4 that was seated after us got up and left after about 20 minutes after no one came to take their order.  Needless to say I will not be back.

587222,2013-06-30,0,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,What a gem of a soba noodle shop!  I couldn't believe that this place wasn't packed on a Saturday night.   Excellent soba shop.

587659,2015-02-27,1,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"Short: Bad service, good food, great tempura.

Long: I'll just jump in with the food: Tempura was spot on. Not the best, but great with all the fixings. I haven't found better outside a festival. The soba was decent, and next time I'd ask for more wasabi. Prices, for $12 for soba and tempura, was alright. I don't feel ripped off, but I don't feel like I got a great deal as well.

The service, surprisingly for a Japanese restaurant, was some of the worse I've had. The waitress wasn't rude and she wasn't overwhelmed, but just super gloomy and disrespectful.

Here's what happened: Walked in and had to wait for her to pop out of the back to tell me to sit anywhere. She wasn't smiling, seemed more bored and annoyed than anything. I sat and waited... and waited for her to bring me a menu after passing me by for a while. I ordered water (because I like water) and looked through the menu. After I ordered, I waited... no water. The waitress was just hiding in the backroom the entire time. When she brought me my food, she brought me the water as well--lukewarm water in a tiny cup! What. The. Hell? I know people who order water seem cheap, but can't I get a normal glass and some ice? Other people, who got soda, got normal glasses and ice. Since I was thirsty I had to down the cup and I was never refilled--which is pretty bad when everything you're eating is salty. 

Then, while I was half way through my meal, she came up while I was eating and asked me if I'd like to order anything else and HANDED ME THE BILL. What? Seriously, who trained her? You do not hand someone the bill while they are eating. You're telling them to eat and get out as fast as possible. I'm paying $12+ for a meal; I'm in no hurry to get out, and I didn't show any signs that I was in a hurry (because I wasn't). If she wasn't so gloomy, she might have ripped the food out from under me and pulled the money out of my wallet before shoving me out the door.

Again, the service wasn't horrible. I just don't want to go a restaurant to feel depressed and disrespected. The food and the environment was good, the waitress and the service I received was bad. I really do hope other people have experienced better service, or this was a one off thing. Still, there is no excuse for this.

Everything was so-so.  Disappointed in the nanbanzuke which I have always loved normally with saba.  This one lacked flavor.

Soba - Didn't really care if it came from Japan or not because something was lost in the shipping process.

It was fine; we each got an udon bowl that was decent: one order of the udon with thin sliced ribeye (fat noodles) and one with tempura (medium noodles). Noodles and broth were ok, but they forgot to put in the order of kara-age (there were 2 tables to service, so i dont see a reasonable excuse), and then they overcharged me a dollar for my dish, AND they used whiteout on the bill to change it to the incorrect price. The guy was gracious enough when I pointed it out, but I just left with a (figurative) bad taste in my mouth.

Will be back to try the soba and other dishes, since the food is probably 3.5*, maaaaaybe 4*, but with the multitude of options in Chinatown, they need to step up their service to get into the regular rotation.",6arPqqPM-4O_OpT_Gf8agA,1,1,3,oMXWewUjgXmzt5n86A_wIw

Yuzu Limeade - this was delicious and so refreshing. Sour with a slight bitter taste, I think this was my favorite thing I had here. 

Battera - pretty tasty, not too fishy and the slight pickled taste really worked well with the rice

Grilled eggplant- this was ok, comes with a mound of bonito flakes on top, which is always tasty.

Cold Soba - Soba noodles were good, a bit sticky and clumped together, and the dipping sauce was ok, I needed a bit of tang with lemon or yuzu to brighten up the flavor

Chirashi Bowl - fresh assorted seafood, I had a piece of scallop which was very tasty. The bf enjoyed all the different pieces of fish and seafood. 

Overall, pretty tasty, but not something that I would crave coming back to for the Soba. I would like to try their other udon on another occassion though.",OUQH3QBOJ0oJQw02yjJcog,0,1,3,y2wTLQPL-TjGiAkrTNZWbw

1115710,2012-03-29,4,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"Inaba puts the ""Zen"" in Amazen!!

My first time experiencing Soba noodles and this level of authenticity in Japanese cuisine, and it was fantastic.  I hope my next comment doesn't offend anyone, but when I'm in a restaurant that serves a regional cuisine, and both the staff, and the customers hail from that region, I know it's going to be good.  Inaba falls in this category.

My fellow friends and Yelpers joined me for dinner Wednesday night, and we all left pretty satisfied.  Here are some general notes from our experience:

The Ambience - The restaurant was playing some very quiet music in the background which was nice (Japanese interpretation of Canon in D)  The room only has about 12 tables, and is decorated with muted tones of bamboo, greys, and blacks.  Peaceful is a good way to describe this place.


The Menu - Page one of the two page menu explains a little bit about the noodles, the tradition of this type of cuisine, and why it is so special  (it is).  Be sure to read it!  The other page features a few small plates, and various Soba and Udon dishes, both hot and cold.  


The Food - We ordered Kakuni (Braised Pork Belly)  Salmon Oshizuki (pressed cured salmon on top of sushi rice w/ salmon roe) and the Sansai Tororo w/ Soba (buckwheat noodles w/ mountain vegetables and grated yam)  

Kukuni -  It was flavorful, but not quite as tender as I've had in other places.  It was a nice way to start the meal, but not my favorite bite of the night.

Salmon Oshizuki - A bit too much rice for my liking, but again this was simple and tasty.

Sansai Tororo w/ Soba - WOW!  The flavors were subtle and delicate.  If you are not used to this cuisine, you really need to treat it like classical music, and look for the beauty of the subtle flavor nuances.  Just because it's not blaring and loud, doesn't mean it's not great!  The broth was a dashi/soy broth with no oil sitting on the surface and just the right balance of salt.  The veggies were crisp enough to give texture, but stayed in line with the rest of the dish.



Inaba is in the infant stages of greatness.  The menu will be updated as time goes on, with new items making appearances.

1231953,2015-07-03,1,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"On a scorching Vegas day, you can't go wrong with cold noodles. And these noodles are the bomb! But low-carb dieters, beware! There's a lot of starch going on here ... and that's a good thing.

I had never had cold soba noodles before, but after reading the reviews on Yelp, I thought I would give them a try. My husband prefers udon to soba, so he stuck with the fatties. We both ordered off the lunch menu: eel tempura on rice, and cold soba noodles in broth with eggplant and daikon for me; and salmon sashimi with salmon roe on rice, and cold udon noodles in broth with tempura shrimp and vegetables for him. Both were perfectly paired, and the broth-to-noodle ratio was great. I loved my eel and only wish there were a little more of it. The salmon roe added a nice fishy quality to my husband's rice, and while we both liked the udon, we agreed that the soba was the better choice.

We planned to try the battera as an appetizer, but they were out of it. But there was plenty of food to go around -- too much, in fact, for us to finish! I also had a yuzu limeade, which was a little too tart for my taste, and the whole meal was around $40 (with tip), which was more than reasonable for the amount of food we received.

We plan to go back to I-Naba to try some of their other tempting menu items, including black cod (my favorite!) and the aforementioned battera. And maybe next time I will order the cold soba noodles as a side dish, so I can experience them plain with a side of dipping sauce. But hot or cold, I look forward to revisiting this tasty treat.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,1,4,SvPIS8Dop_d9CJFXoNC0Cw

Welcoming staff. Comtemporary design. Nice atmosphere. 

According to my friend, their menu was design the ""legit"" or ""real"" way of how japanese should do their menu's... opening from the right to left. I WOULD HAVE NEVER NOTICED LOL. 

Small menu of some appetizers, cold and hot noodles, drinks, and desserts.

This visit, i had ordered the vegetable ten zaru, which was a cold soba noodle served with shrimp and vegetable tempura on the side. 

On the table, there is a little description on the healthiness of eating soba. Quite informative to read. 

Each person is given ""water"" which has some flavoring in it. Something close to the barley tea water you get at some korean restaurants? 

Each order is brought in it's own individual tray, and each item separated in its own individual dish. Other than what i had listed above for my order, it also came with a little fried rice like thing that tasted quite nice. Nothing too flavorful but still good. The soba sauce came with a side plate with wasabi and green onions, and a plate of some seasoned, perhaps sea salt that you can add to the sauce as well depending on your own preference. I added all the green onions but a little wasabi and salt for the experience. Luckily, i only added a little of the wasabi, because that wasnt really something i had liked. Haha. 

But back to the main course. The soba was cooked beautifully, nice and al dente. The tempura was freshly fried, and crispy. Everything was flavored nicely. Nothing overpowering but was refreshing because it was a cold noodle dish on a hot day.

As i had mentioned briefly earlier, there is a health benefit to eating soba. One is that you drink the rest of your soba sauce with the soba water that will be given to you, during your meal. What the health benefit was, i dont remember, but hey, why not? 

Price wise it was fairly decent. Range from i believe 10 - 14 dollars depending on which ""combination soba"" you get. As for other items, im not sure. Nice place to eat on a hot day.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,-IYgX3w7Lk3ik7nHP3bY5A
1404170,2014-10-03,4,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"This place will get a 3.5 stars from me, with some reservations. The problem from my point of view is there are a lot of inconsistencies everywhere. 

I've been here quite a few times. This place reminds me of places like Ichiza, meaning, I-naba has components of a dish that are really good, but in the same dish, a lot of the components are really lacking. While I think that they are doing something different that's kinda unique here, it really didn't blow me away like I feel it should have.

Nabeyaki udon - they made it with these really thick udon noodles which I never had before, and I thought that it was different, but really didn't do anything for me. I wish there were more vegetables like carrots and mushrooms. They did put in a tempura kabocha, but it was undercooked. The shrimp tempera was cooked really well and and had a light, crisp batter. The soft boiled egg was cooked nicely. The broth was ok, just a bit too sweet for my taste. I thought for $12 bucks it was a little too pricey for what I received.

I have been here and tried their yakisoba, and while the soba noodles are a lot different than what I have had in the past, it didn't really do anything for me.

Service wasn't really that great. We had to share menus. Is it really that hard to order more menu cases and print out some more menus? I guess so. She also didn't know who ordered what. Maybe the kitchen gets confused as well. But, we came in a really big group, so maybe they aren't accustomed to that. Or she's new. There are usually a lot more questions than there are answers.

But, food wise, it's ok. I don't really know if I would come back here. It could be that this type of food doesn't really fit my style. I prefer bigger, simpler, and bolder flavors.

I don't know why, but part of the reason might be because of the soba's simplicity and subtleties, that requires the companion that comes with it to create a deep contrast.

Inaba is no exception. Their ten-zaru (cold soba with tempura) is the best, but their ten-don (tempura rice bowl) is a must try if you haven't.

What's more, Inaba has Wappa-meshi, which is a traditional Tohoku / Hokuriku cuisine. I tried beef / salmon / unagi and they were all good!

This restaurant serves the best Udon noodles, I went to this restaurant with couple of yelp friends. The food is excellent, it was my first time at this restaurant, so I ordered what I consider to be the best type of noodles, Udon. Its thick and it absorbs more flavor of broth between each string of noodle. I ended up getting their seafood noodles, which had clams, shrimp, salmon (bit over cooked), and fish eggs. The broth was had the right amount of salt and spices. They also serve cold noodle dishes, but if you are going their in winter then i would go for the hot ones. 

Negatives:

I-naba, that just opened less than a year, is one of the more authentic Japanese foods, but their ramens are great and their shabu-shabu meals on Sundays is to die for.  Love their sake selection.

It's just the concept of paying for a meal where the star attraction is the noodles and the dipping sauce it comes in just isn't that appealing. I'm used to a bowl of noodles where the broth is the highlight of the dish or the ingredients are and the noodles just complement as well as add some filling in the bowl.

Being this was my first time at I-Naba i opted to try the evening's tasting menu which was a 4 course dinner for 18. Portions were small which reflects traditional Japanese style. I didn't remember to take a picture of the tasting menu. With that in mind i'm going to describe what came out without knowing their proper names or the other option available.

1st course - braised mackrel 
Served cold which was a surprise to me but still pretty good. The sauce they braised in it was light and refreshing and paired quite nicely with the mackrel 

2nd course - deep fried shrimp with a hunk of fish cake attached to it served with fried tofu and eggplant in sauce
The fish cake is very Japanese which is the only way i can describe it. Flavored with herbs and heavy with course cuts of vegetables. not exactly what i was expecting with it comes to fish cake but it was still nice. 

3rd course - Bowl of udon soup with slices of rib eye
Even though this place is known for it's soba noodles the udon is excellent. The broth was light and refreshing as well as complemented the udon noodles quite well.

4th course - shaved watermelon ice with sesame ice cream
The sesame ice cream had honey drizzled over it and was a small scoop but packed a very rich and pleasant sesame taste. They did an excellent job shaving the watermelon ice as it wasn't prone to melting quickly and had a rich watermelon taste.

Not exactly what i was expecting at all when i came here but will gladly return.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,9,5,4,2RJjKJucTskXxfONs_dzHg
2002546,2012-06-16,0,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"Potted plants rest outside the doors of a minimalist, graceful establishment - one that alludes to the history and ceremony to the experience of a traditional soba house that is I-Naba.  While Ichiza might offer a crowded and loud experience out of the corner of Tokyo, I-Naba would be a gentle breath of Kyoto.

Upon the invitation of a friend of mine, I joined her for lunch at the newly established restaurant that I had heard NOTHING about, specializing in Soba noodles, which I had only enjoyed in yakisoba.  Headed by one of the prime chefs from Bellagio's famous Picasso restaurant, there is nothing like this restaurant's offering currently in Vegas - no Soba houses to speak of - but thankfully, this restaurant really, really delivers.

Graceful lines and floral arrangements grace the interior.  Service is attentive and friendly, helpful to answer any questions about the presentation or function of the ladle, spicing the broth to enjoy your very healthy, buckwheat soba, etc.  

Service was a little slow on the refills of my water and tea, but the food came out quickly, hot, and gorgeously presented.  

While the noodles were of course, delicious and I enjoyed being able to flavor my broth myself, I was just beside myself with the appetizers, which chef really shone.  The calamari-stuffed vegetable tempura was the standout in the midst of some excellent dishes, along with fresh, flavourful sushi whose presentation was only matched by the floral arrangements.  I could have equally been happy ordering several appetizers versus an actual entree.  

When one ventures into a space such as I-Naba, they're really not just looking for quality food so much as an experience in an unfamiliar realm of cuisine - but the ceremony and care of food from top to bottom was just wonderful and I look forward to returning again.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,11,9,5,ixNyT7_jZX28EfpKmJhy0Q

I been wanting to try cold soba for so long and a found this place. It's near a random area and hard to find cause the sign saids ""NaNa"". 

Anyways, we ordered: 

Kake: Udon with broth. It wasn't even hot. It was actually just little less than warm. The noodles were a little thicker than usual and I swear there was only 15 strings of noodles. The broth was seriously lacking in favor. Maybe I'm more into bolder flavors but honestly it needed to be a little more salter. 

Zaru: Cold Soba. Disappointment. It was so boring and felt like I was dipping into store bought premade dipping sauce. It felt watered down and honestly didn't taste like much! 

Katsu Don: Pork over rice. Whatever. I only took a couple bites and was done with it. It needed Katsu sauce to make it a little more somewhat exciting. 

My favorite was sadly the salad.

The hospitality the owners showed doing tasting menu for big group was class act (they even willing too do all separate checks for us). Showed me lot about there passion for their food!

We started with tempura style salmon pieces believe not even part of the tasting menu. The first course was sashimi platter was AMAZING! By far my favorite course of the menu. Not only was the presentation elegant and modern but it tasted as great as it looked. The Umi, too spicy yellow tail tartar, traditional cuts of salmon, yellowtail, and tuna, the quail egg (unfortunately only one), and every flavor and texture on one plate. Second course Tempura course. We have lot of different things but most enjoyed was the tempura batter. I know every restaurant the batter consistency will vary but this one was beautiful. It was nice light, everything perfectly perfect coating, not greasy at all, and on point. Third course was grilled Black Cod with clams. The Black Cod was seared perfection with nice crust and the sauce combine with the clams over the top in butter sauce was divine. Fourth course Shabu Shabu. The broth was out of control GOOD. By the end after all the fresh seafood, and vegetables broth was sooo Ono. Last thing thing added was the Udon noodles out of control. The presentation with the ceramic looking base for the pot was very nice touch! Fifth course was the dessert! Even at the end everything was amazing! Two different kinds one owe crepe with green tea ice cream and some kind of sauce on top. Other one really enjoy more was red bean on bottom, think coffee ice cream on top, fresh cuts of fruit on top, and sauce over the top. It almost looked like fruit cup but at whole another level. Everything was tasty, presentations were top notch, and barely touching the menu. So look forward too coming back sooner then later.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,4,4,1J5vu6Ov-x3CI0CpzfGR_g

2261969,2012-04-24,0,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"With a bourgeoning Japanese community thriving in Las Vegas, there's an emerging Japanese restaurant enclave that's exciting to observe and participate.  We're definitely coming into our own, rivaling that of LA and evolving into a Japanese foodie hub of the Southwest. And there's definitely demand, every Japanese hotspot is crowded, reviewed by every critic and blogger in town, and in the Top To Do Lists for Dining in Sin City.  Next stop, total world domination!  Muwahaaaaa!

And it's not just the fine establishments that are getting the attention, it's the casual restaurants that truly define a culture and represent the heart and soul of food....                                      

Inaba Japanese Soba Noodle is a small chain from LA which serves, as the name suggest, Soba and Udon Noodles... It's another Japanese staple cuisine, where noodles are the hallmark of everyday cuisine, with a variety of different executions from cold Soba Noodles with various accoutrements, to hot steaming bowls of Noodle Soup to warm up the body on a cold day....

We decided to make our way over to the other side of town and get there just as it was opening up for dinner, we thought it would be crowded...it wasn't.  But after a while, people came in  and filling up the restaurant. As is the case in most restaurants off the Strip, the interior is really nothing to write about, except that it's kinda depressing....no ambience to speak of - but we're here for the food so no quips!

We started the meal with a small plate: the Braised Pork Belly which is a favorite of ours. This is a home-cooked comfort food version of the dish, (unlike the polishd, glossy kind you get at the snooty, hoighty, toighty Japanese restaurants on the Strip) with Braised Pork Belly, Carrots and Daikon and Spinach topped with Scallions.  It's served with a side of hot mustard and it is a quintessential comfort food dish. I wasn't overly impressed with the pork, (my piece had a knuckle, so it wasn't belly) so it was a misnomer, however it had all the robustness of the typical dish, (minus the layers of fat) the Daikon was cooked perfectly and the soup was delicious.  

I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon, a noodle soup cooked in a pot chock full of delicious ingredients!  The Udon here is not your typical fat noodle, here it's a little thinner but just as tasty, the chewiness of the noodle was orgasmic to the bite and the broth was robust but not overly salty!  On top of the noodle: Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Hard Boiled Egg, Salmon, Squid and Greens- it was  a lot of food!  Most Noodle dishes come as a set, so with it came a rice dish -Kakikomi Gohan. A light, subtle flavored rice with vegetables and light seasoning gave a balance to the hot noodle soup, a textural departure..if you will...

A little note about the Gohan (rice)-it's not fried rice, it's actually rice steamed with Vegetables, (for further information and rants: check Yelp,  review by Alex S. is truly informative if not a  little funny to read - he's pretty passionate)!                                                  

I keep forgetting that I really can't have hot noodle soup unless my body is below freezing, my head starts to sweat like a waterfall and doesn't end until, luck would have it,  I'm out of the restaurant!  (Btw, the Nabeyaki is like a cauldron...it's boiling hot).  
But wanting to try this dish, it did not disappoint - I loved the toppings and I would recommend this to those who love Noodles and really Hot Broth!

Rick ordered the Tendon, (Shrimp Tempura Bowl):  Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura over a bed of Rice with Soy Sauce.  An excellent dish; the Shrimp was fresh, the Tempura batter and frying was well executed and overall I would get this dish again in a heartbeat.  You can get a combination most of the dishes, which is a noodle side dish, either Soba or Udon, and either hot (Kake) or cold (Karu), he ordered the Hot Udon Noodle.

His Udon was great, different than the Nabeyaki, (much simpler with less lava like qualities) it had few toppings but still a simple and great add-on.  This Noodle with Rice Combo is Carb lovers dream and we literally rolled ourselves out the door!

Next time, we have to get the Ten Zaru, (Cold Tempura Soba Noodles with Tempura), it's my favorite and perfect on a hot day!! Also, I want to try more of the small plates: Zuke Tororo, (Marinated Tuna with Yam and Quail Egg) the Battera, (Cured Mackerel over pressed Sushi Rice) and the Hirame Kobujime, (Kelp-infused Halibut with Ume-Shiso over Pressed Sushi Rice).

In any case, it is a much welcomed addition to the collection of top quality Japanese restaurants that our fair city has accumulated, and Inaba stands out with its focus on noodles, awesome concept and great delivery!!!

Good thing I did because there's a right way to eat it and I never would have been able to figure it out on my own. I-naba does have directions on the table, but I recommend reading up on it beforehand. My first time eating soba in a restaurant was a fantastic experience. I will be back.

The waitress that day was so insanely kind. She was patient and willing to answer questions. In fact a solicitor came in asking each table for donations. She approached the woman and said in the sweetest voice, ""Please leave now. Thank you."" The solicitor kindly left.

I ate two things:
Battera Small Plate- 6 thin pieces of cured mackerel on vinegary sushi rice forming a perfect rectangle. Excellent.
Vegetable Ten Zaru- served on a tray you receive vegetable tempura (yam, asparagus, mushroom, etc), dipping sauce for tempura, small bowl of rice, cold soba noodles on a basket thing called a zaru, and the soba dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is salty and savory. Grab a bite full of noodles, dip the last end into the sauce, and let that end sit in there as you eat the clean noodles from your chopsticks. Enjoy the flavor of the clean noodles and when you get to the sauce soaked part you will enjoy the contrast. When you finish the meal set aside your dipping sauce. They bring the water the soba was cooked in. Pour that water right in the cup up to the top and enjoy it like a soup. Those first sips can be pretty salty so keep adding the soba water to dilute it.

I am satisfied with the portion and meal experience here. Although I could see how super hungry people who crave meat in every meal may not be contented.

They do have beer here, not bad selection either. They had Asahi, Innis & Gunn and Samuel Smith. Looks great inside too, very comfortable and calm. The music was very good, like loungey rhythm Asian music.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,25,19,5,WIwHWFxTZWvE2uwyUPnG4A

Cold noodles are a refined craving to be sure.  But as I sit in paradise 3 weeks after leaving Vegas for the summer what I am craving more than anything is I-Naba soba noodles.  Some would liken it to crack.  They are just junkies!  This is such a deeper, more fundamental craving.  This is a spandex to the figure-skater kind of essential craving!

THE MEAT: The place is low-key, and probably looks much better at night.  They have a chiller stocked with sake and friendly Japanese servers.  They placed a plastic kiddie bowl and spork in front of my son.  Cute.  But I wish more of these places served fruit juice for the little ones.  We settled for the Yuzu limeade.  It was good, but for my taste a little too sweet and tangy (it made my jaw tingle and think of a concentrate).  The salmon oshizushi was tasty, the rice may be thick but the salty cured fish and eggs balance it out.  Hubby and I go gaga for any Jap sesame dressing on salad, I love the fact that their tempura sauce comes with grated radish, their half bowl udon kake was substantial and very good, and finally their Katsu-Don (pork on rice with egg) was excellent.

The few items we were not so pleased with was the Kakuni, braised pork belly (the cut was surprisingly lean and just missed the mark of pork belly fatty orgasm) and the Zuke Tororo, marinated tuna and grated yam (instead or slices of tuna, we had a tartare next to a bed weird slimy and not very pleasant tasting tororo).

2837546,2013-01-11,0,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"After being mesmerized by the No Reservations episode in Japan where Anthony Bourdain enjoys cold soba noodles made from a reputable master (begin around 19:23... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLtRN_C0ev4), I was excited to learn Las Vegas now has its own place for authentic Japanese soba, a firm vermicelli sized noodle made from buckwheat. Although the soba is not made from scratch on the premise by a resident soba master, I've heard that it is shipped in from their sister restaurant in Torrance, where it is made fresh daily with imported Japanese buckwheat flour.    

To summarize my three trips here, I've included my take on various offerings:

Appetizers: 
Chawanmushi-  velvety egg custard with seafood, similar in quality to Kyara across town, with slightly better price point ($4 vs $5)
Battera- Holy smokes/Holy mackerel this is some nice thinly pressed smoked mackerel atop well seasoned vinegar rice!

Entrees:
Chirashi bowl- beautifully arranged assortment of sashimi and roe over sushi rice, strongly recommend pairing with the cold Zaru soba 

Noodles:
In the dilemma between hot and cold soba, I felt that the cold soba was the clearcut favorite for me (I've also gathered from reading other reviewers that their udon is not the typical thick chewy noodle, but a thinner softer variety so you've been warned)  The Zaru soba is simply plain chilled soba noodles served on an artistic bamboo basket (zaru)  with some shredded nori and accompanied by some scallions, wasabi, and dipping sauce of mirin, dashi, and soy sauce.  Proper technique is to take a few strand of noodles with the chopsticks, dunk the bottom half of the noodles into the cup with the dipping sauce (some like to add the scallions and wasabi into the dipping cup whereas placing them directly onto the soba can intensify their flavors), and it is encouraged to slurp them into your mouth so that you first get the taste of pure buckwheat flavor followed by the combined flavor of all the ingredients together.  The texture and inherent flavor of the noodle is best appreciated in this form and it is a very refreshing afternoon meal especially in the summertime although I also didn't mind eating it during my last visit in the wintertime. 

Drinks:
Yuzu limeade with mint- bubbly, tart and mildly sweet, akin to a very refreshing non-alcoholic Asian mojito
Soba tea- the broth from which the soba is cooked is chalk full of vitamins B1, B2, and rutin (good for lowering blood pressure and a potent antioxidant to boot) and the gracious staff presents it at the close of the meal which can be consumed as is or combined with the dipping sauce as a nice hot broth.
  
While our Western palates are conditioned to routinely appreciate an unctuous hunk of pork belly or a rich and gooey mac and cheese, it's nice to occasionally balance it out with foods more subtle and delicate, producing a much cleaner finish and leaving an overall sense of wellness rather than having a cloying aftertaste and feeling overstuffed.  Inaba offers a wide array of items that accomplishes just that so best to not arrive ravenously hungry and be sure to set your AYCE sushi cravings on the wayside when approaching this oasis of zen accompanied by the soothing tunes of their never-ending playlist of Beatles/Michael Jackson muzak.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,9,5,4,69GSzPk8iVmK8WeWE1T-3Q

 I ordered the Zuke Tuna bowl combination with cold Soba and a side of braised pork belly. I wanted a light meal but I have a weakness for pork belly so I caved in :-/ The main meal itself was very light and refreshing. The tuna was delish and the rice was perfect :-D The Soba stick together slightly but had a wonderful chewy texture and the flavors was very light not strong buckwheat flavor that you can sometimes get with soba. I gotta say I just love slurping my noodles :-) Makes you feel like a kid without getting in trouble for doing it too ;-) The braised pork belly was obviously on the heavier side. Nothing is light about pork belly, actually I always feel sick right after eating it too....but I don't care, it's worth it ;-)  The flavors are wonderful...my only complaint is the piece itself was rather large for one or even two bites and its not so easy to pick up with chopsticks because of it's size and weight. Other than that little minor thing the meal was perfect :-)  Plus I washed it all down with their complimentary iced green tea and  a Yuzu-Limeaid that I had to try....which was awesome!

So, I hear a lot of things about people making comments about Cold Noodles and how they don't care where the noodles come from or who makes them. Then honestly don't eat out or write your reviews because you obviously just are not well rounded enough to appreciate the culture of others besides your own. 
Getting back to my review, the people who work here are Japanese and I like that because it makes the atmosphere seem authentic. Also a lot of the cliental when I come in are always Japanese. 
I order the limeade because it is homemade and tastes like a mojito mix, which I love mojitos. 
On to the food! So experimented around, ordering hot/cold, appetizers, the specials, and there hasn't been a complaint about any of it. I love the noodles and I love getting my hot water for the sauce to turn into soup after. 
The service regardless if they were slammed or empty as always been attentive to my orders and needs. 
My only issues are about the portions, I feel that because although it might be just right for me it is lacking in the size for others. I feel that every time I bring a friend to eat with the portion is not enough and they have to order more.

Going off strip when one does not have one's own car is always difficult.  It's easy to tell the taxi cab ""Bellagio"" or ""MGM"" and they know exactly where to take you. . . True it's not exactly rocket science to notice a huge casino/hotel down one road.  But say that you want to go off strip to a small restaurant and you're in trouble.  Word of advice - give them nearby major intersections and for I-Naba look for the ""Nana Noodles"" sign.

The restaurant and menu is small and simple. . . Initially I had my heart set on the Chirashi with soba combination as advertised on their website but I could not resist a 4-course tasting menu for $18 obviously with wine pairing for the first two courses(add $7).

Course 1 - three pieces of cured mackeral nigiri.  Now I'm not a fan of saba to begin with so cured saba was not my thing.  The shape was unique, completely squared, which I found difficult to eat with.

Course 2 - Tempura fish cake/shrimp and eggplant.  Let me explain, the shrimp is blanketed with fish cake and the whole thing is deep fried tempura style, served with grilled eggplant and in some soy sauce.  It was lovely.

Course 3 - Hot udon soup with a side of fried rice.  THE. BEST. UDON I have had.  The noodles were not as big as I would expect it to be (yes that's what she said for you immature folks out there) but it was the right size for me and absolutely delicious.  The broth was very nice, not too salty, not too bland.

Course 4 - Honey covered yogurt with frest fruit.

The service was great and attentive. . . We asked our server if she would not mind calling a cab to pick us up and informed us that the cab is due to arrive in 15 min.  15 min?!  Ok, we'll walk around the shopping center and maybe buy a huge thing of water for our hotel room, we just rounded the shopping center when our waitress came running after us telling us that the cab called with an update that he will be arriving in 2 min instead.  Great service, absolutely great.

I could not have been happier with our choice to visit I-Naba for udon (especially after I overate at the buffet for lunch).",1Px8_etTU-O0NTBLemwDJA,25,22,5,R8Wz6kAEBCff9qYUfKOmbw

I really like that they offer cold tea but let you ask for hot tea. The ambience was really quaint and the place was simply decorated for a home-feel. They had soothing instrumental Beatles music playing. Many Japanese were there paying their patronage.

There wasn't much special done to their chilled broth and the rice that came with the meal must have been sitting in the rice warmer for a while. It didn't complement or accent the soba very well. It had the slightest taste of soy added to it, but not any other real flavor. I did like that the eggplant (nasu) in the chilled broth was warm. The eggplant was done quite well. 

Their noodles provide a moment of zen, just like what Steve W. said. Their service is pretty good, except I find their way of giving a check somewhat inefficient because they bring a little cup and after you leave money in the little cup, they seem to be expecting exact change because they don't check on you for a long while. We were almost going to switch out our bills for smaller bills when the server finally came to check on us. 

I know... they're the only ones in town doing soba. But I have had really good noodles. This place is okay for me. I would love to give it another shot in three months when it's scorching outside.

Hits the freakin spot. Which, as everyone knows, is at least 2-3 times harder than just hitting the spot.

Soup base is nice and flavorful without being overly salty or overwhelming.
Nice balance with the noodles which were cooked to perfection and pleasantly chewy.
It's hard finding dishes this subtle that leave such a big impact.

I like it a lot here. We need one of these in San Diego.


**PROTIP**
The ground yam paste (the white pasty stuff...made of yam...which has been pounded into a paste-like consistency, from yams, which, I've been told, are transformed into a white paste via pounding yams.) can go in either your rice or your broth.

I'm not a huge fan of mushy things.
If you aren't either, just put in all into your soup and give it a good stir.

Their little storefront is a bit hidden inside the Decatur and Desert Inn shopping center where Smith's is located and once you find the provocative ""massage parlor"" it's right next door. 

Their menu has expanded a bit from when they first opened, but I won't go into that, you can see the menu here : http://www.inabalasvegas.com/#!menu/vstc1=brunch
I-Naba also offers specials in their menu in store that include an appetizer, entree, and dessert for those who would like to partake on a more complete lunch. 

My personal favorites are the zuke tuna bowl with hot udon combo ($12) or the battera (cured mackerel sushi). The hot udon increases my heart rate and makes my nose runny because I'm slurping its umami deliciousness so quickly. Just like smelling a pineapple to see if it's ripe, I use my runny nose to tell me whether or not I'm having a great bowl of hot noodles. 

I've never had a problem with the service, any language barrier issues, or my drinks being filled, BUT sometimes I'm sad when I go there on Tuesday's and they're not opened :(.

Verdict?  It was OK...

The best part of the Zaru Soba was probably the noodles which were thin and chewy.  Otherwise, I wasn't impressed with the broth which I thought was not enough flavor and a tad bit salty.  Also, the portion was TINY!!  They really should have an option for a larger size.

I also ordered the Saba Nanban Zuke.  Dislike!
First, it's fried but served chilled which I definitely wasn't expecting.  
The skin is still on (which I prefer not to eat) so it was diffcult separating the meat from the skin, especially using chopsticks.  
It was also tossed with some sliced veggies and a yuzu-type marinade.
Sorry but I didn't find much to like about this dish.

At the end of the meal, they bring you a little pot filled with broth that was used to cook the soba and it's supposed to be mixed with the your leftover broth.  I thought it was a little strange, but I actually enjoyed it =)

Service was spectacular!!

I love this place!!!!!

Soba noodles are thin, spaghetti-like noodles made from buckwheat, which makes soba noodles protein-rich and full of vitamins...

which means ...no guilty conscience! 

I usually come by myself after the gym to have their zaru, which is just their plain soba noodles that is served with dipping sauce and a side of fried rice. Usually satiates my hunger right after a workout...but there are occasions where I have ordered a second order just because these noodles are that good! After finishing my noodles the server brought a cup of sobayu (the water that was used to cook the soba) to add to the remaining dipping sauce and drink like a soup. This ""soup"" is supposed to be very good for you and full of vitamins and nutrients from the noodles. 

On occasions I have taken friends here and tried other items on the menu and have not been disappointed by anything. The miso glazed black cod is great. They also have specials that are inserted into their menus. 

Service is great. I usually never have to ask for more tea or anything at all besides the check when I am ready for it. They are very attentive. The price in my opinion is fairly cheap for the quality and service that you get. Inaba is a gem...YOU MUST TRY.

It took over an HOUR for the food to be served. How long could it possibly take to whip up some cold soba noodles and tempura? Ridiculous. By the time we got our food we couldn't even enjoy it. Waste of time!!

I-Naba represents a nice opposite to the recently opened Ramen Sora. Sora's ramen is especially good on cold winter days, while I-Naba's soba, or buckwheat noodles, are usually eaten cold with a dipping sauce, perfect for those hot Vegas summer days!

I stopped in on a Wednesday night, about 90 minutes before closing. Only three other table were occupied, most of them nearing the end of their dining experience. I iopted for the Ten-zaru (cold soba noodles with a side of tempura) and battera (cured mackeral on pressed sushi rice). The battera was okay, it was wasn't disappointing or wow-ing. My only complaint with the tempura is I would have liked more grated daikon, otherwise it was just okay too.

The star of the meal, the soba, was above average. It was cooked the way I like, a little chewy and still able to absorb the dipping sauce. They even serve you a portion of the water the noodles were cooked in to make a soup from the dipping sauce, pretty authentic!

The service was also above average. Not only was my ice tea refilled regularly and without prompting, I mean with two servers and only four table I would hope so, but I was not made to feel rushed when the other tables finished their meals and left. The servers were not eyeballing me to hurry and leave so they could close up, which is always nice.

My only complaint would be the prices/value. The prices are a touch on the high side for soba noodles. Maybe it is just the noodle lover in me, but I do wish the portion of noodles was a bit larger.

Inaba is noted for their hand made soba; however, this particular store get their noodles from their California's counterpart biweekly.  

Zaru Soba is the thing to get here.  It is known.  Perfect for a hot summer day or anytime really. Comes with a simple bowl of Fried Rice, Soba Tsuyu (dipping sauce usually some sort of dashi, mirin, soysauce, sugar?), and scallion and wasabi to tweak your dipping sauce.  Soba are made out of buckwheat flour but wheat is commonly added to bind the noodles together.  The flavor is a delicate.  It's kind of hard to describe but its a little rustic and earthy.  I usually put all the wasabi and chopped scallions in the dipping sauce and have at it.  Don't be afraid to slurp.  More air to the back of your nose heighten your taste buds.  When you are finished ask for a side of Soba-Yu.  It's the water full of nutrient from cooking the noodles.  Add to your Soba Tsuyu and drink up.  Simple and healthy for you.

BUT my greatest obsession is their Chirashi Bowl. Beautiful arrangements of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Scallop, Shwimp, Squid wrapped in Shisho Leaf, Tamago (egg), Marinated Chopped Tuna, Salmon Roe, Shisho Leaf, Gari (sushi ginger), Daikon Radish Sprouts, and Nori (shredded seaweed) all on a bed of tasty sushi rice.  Chirashi rice usually contain more rice vinegar than in nigiri or sushi rolls, so you don't need a lot of soy sauce to dip your fish in.  They do give you a ramekin of soy sauce and sometimes bits of fresh Wasabi as well.  There's so much going on in this bowl of goodness that it'll always keep me craving for more.  

Eating both the Zaru Soba (Buckwheat Noodles with dipping sauce) and Chirashi Bowl can be a challenge because the sushi bowl comes with a house salad.  The add-on of a small side of soba for $4 if you dont want a full serving. The miso sesame ginger dressing that comes with the salad is savory.  I usually just dip my chopsticks in the dressing and pick up a few greens to eat.

Service is polite and quick.  They're closed on weds and only open during lunch and dinner hours so plan accordingly.

The service is 1 star.  I'd give it 0 if I could.

This review is based on two separate occasions.

The first time I went there, it was a late lunch at about 2-3P on a weekend.  There were only two other tables occupied when I entered and they were midway completed with their meal before we were even seated.

I have my 5 year old with us.  So when the waitress comes up to our table, I ask, ""What's good for kids?""  Her response, ""Kids?""  I said, ""Yes, kids.  What do children normally order?""  She says, ""Children?""  I say, ""Yes, children.  What do children usually get here?""  And she says, ""Get?""  At this point, I can tell this is going nowhere.  But trying not to lose it and be polite, I say, ""Is there a kids menu?"" since some restaurants have a separate kids menu.  And again, she says ""Kids?""  So I point to other table and I say, ""What did those kids order?""  She says, ""Kids like noodles.""  Keep in mind that about half the menu comprises noodles.  So I say, ""Which noodles?""  And she says, ""Which noodles?""  So by now, I'm a bit turned off and just order without the waitress' input.

I'm not sure where they get their staff from.  It seems like they just flew in from Asia and handed them a uniform.  I'm not being difficult or picky.  I myself am 100% asian and my mother also tried to speak to her in Japanese with zero success.  She's over 70 and was disgusted.  She is also 100% Japanese.

The food came out about 45 minutes later.  Luckily, I had my phone to keep my kid occupied.  Otherwise, we would've left and gone to McDonalds.

The second time, I plan ahead and try to be smart about it.  I call ahead and ask if it's crowded or if there is a wait because it's dinnertime and a holiday weekend.  They said the restaurant is mostly empty.  So we truck on down there.

As luck would have it, the second trip is worst than the first.  I see a party of 7 walk in right when we do.  Knowing that these people move at turtle speed and trying to order before the party of 7, I tell the hostess that I am ready to order before we even hit the seats.  And what does she do?  She walks away and brings ONE menu for a party of 5.  I have no idea what she's doing and I say, ""I'm ready to order"" again.  And what does she do?  She walks away and brings four more menus.  So at this point, I'm worried.  I say, ""We don't need more menus.  I said I'm ready to order.""  So we place our order and I watch her carefully as she goes to the party of 7 and takes their order without putting our order in.

And of course, I sit there for an hour while my 5 year old yells out, ""What is taking so long?""  And of course, the party of 7 gets their food before our party of 5 despite placing our order first.  My 80 yr old father who can barely walk is outraged, feels compelled to go to the ""manager"" and asks what is taking so long.  The restaurant is less than half full.  They apologize profusely and say the other tables' order is simple and that's why they got their food first.

Simple?  Simple?  Seriously?  How hard is it to slice fish, put it on rice and cook noodles for 5 minutes and put it in a bowl?  How do I know this?  Not only do I love soba, I've cooked it myself at home at least 30 times.

All five of us ordered the same exact item.  It's not like we ordered unique items per person.  They could have mass produced each component and threw it on the plate.  Let's face it, Soba is basically ramen.  You cook it and give you a bowl of pre-made sauce.  It's not like they are making the actual noodles from scratch the moment it's ordered.

They had one waitress, one manager, and what must've been one cook for a holiday dinner time slot.  Unreal.

So why a 3 star rating?  They gave us a discount on the bill and the food is good.  I tell the manager that if they cannot handle 5 identical orders with a restaurant is less than half full on a holiday weekend at dinner, what would it be like if they were at capacity or had a line?  She apologized profusely again, agreed with me and said that our party and the other party arrived at the same time.  Still no excuse.  It was two tables in a restaurant that was 1/4 full when we got there.

Bottom line, don't bother unless you can wait an hour plus for noodles and a chirashi bowl that should take 20 minutes tops.  I will NOT ever return.  You have been warned.

Inaba employees, management and owners:  I hope you read this because you have a lot to learn about managing a business.  Have you ever wondered that the reason why your restaurant is half full is because you cannot support a full restaurant?  And now your restaurant will be even more empty because I will not return and will tell everyone under the sun to never go there regardless of how great your soba is or ever will be.",mkJSCIBWuga8845-Zu4y3w,0,0,3,RBCOYDEHSeDBSn9dq10elQ

I never had any handmade soba here in the US. Only times that I ever had it were when I was in Japan and I really enjoyed them. 
We had seafood tempura for appetizer. Most of them were good except the squash, which was under cooked. 
I had a cold soba and mini Katsudon combination and Mr had a niki udon. My cold soba was mediocre at the most. The broth wasn't that tasty and soba was really hard. Katsudon was ok - I've had it better.  
Mr thought his niku udon was ok. I tasted the broth and sadly I've had it better too.

Luckily, when we had arrived, it was not busy.  We were happily greeted and seated quickly.  I was excited that they had black cod on the appetizer menu, but that smile quickly disappeared when they told me they were already out.  Siiiiigh. Okay, well I then went with the Agedashi Tofu.  It was tasty and enough to share with my other half.  I totally slurped it all up.  

For my main course I got the Salmon and Ikura Don with a side of Zaru Soba.  I was quite pleased with the portion.  If you are from Hawaii and ate at Gyotaku, its like their bento combos.  You get a big portion of salad, your don, and adding on the Zaru Soba you won't leave hungry.  

Well I'm one to not say no to dessert so we did have the animitsu.  That was good, but I need to try this coconut ice cream.

4571021,2012-10-16,3,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"I finally returned after my first visit - I was intrigued by the yuzu offerings and also these new tasting menus.

Today the tasting menu looked amazing (first course - choice or battera or mackerel escabeche - saba all the way), tempura or some other yummy second course, choice of hot udon with beef or shrimp, and pineapple ice with coconut ice cream.  However, I wanted non-noodles tonight.

I ordered the nasu agedashi that I had the first time and it was slightly different.  Noticeably, the ikura replaced the delicious lemon peel.

Next, I enjoyed the 6 piece battera, mackerel with kelp.  Delicious and perfect.

My indulgence was the special of the night, a sashimi plate with tuna, salmon and hamachi.  It was served in a bowl of ice, with a thin slice of radish holding the wasabi, tuna resting on shiso leaf atop shredded daikon and carrot, folds of salmon and slices of hamachi, with one sweet shrimp with tail on standing up.  I really loved the presentation of the sashimi plate.

My yuzu tastes included the yuzu-limeade (refreshing, hint of yuzu) and the yuzu yogurt sorbet (too much honey on top, did not like the pop rocks, and the flavor of the sorbet was a bit odd to me too...masking the yuzu - served with blackberries on the side) but it was worth trying since I like to taste all things yuzu that I can find.  There are other places in town advertising yuzu desserts, so I hope I can get around to those eventually.

I've been thinking about this place ever since I finally tried it last night. Let's cut to the good stuff. To start, we shared some calamari tempura and they were delicious! I usually see tempura as just a single ingredient dipped in the batter, but these had some nice complexity to it with the calamari wrapped around some sort of green veggie (I'm so not a foodie).

For the main course, I had a chirashi bowl with cold soba. I've never had soba before and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The sashimi in the bowl was not Kabuto-level, but it was nevertheless utterly delectable. Though it may not look like a lot of food, I finished the dish completely satisfied.

The cold barley tea that they serve was the perfect complement to the meal. To top it off, they had some sort of shamisen rendition of Michael Jackson's Beat It playing. It was quite fitting for the three-year anniversary of his passing.

I LOVE this place so much!!!  It's one of my favorite places.

Even after countless visits throughout the two-ish years I have been coming here I have left satisfied each and every time.  It has become a Vegas tradition for me to come here every time I go to Vegas and drag whoever else is with me on that trip here.  

The food is always great and very light and refreshing and the service is always, always on point.  After trying a few more things on their menu I can say with greater certainty that I love this place.  I never left feeling icky or bloated which is good because I mean, it's Vegas.  You already feel like crap because of the 100+ degree weather.  

I love their soba.  I have had it cold and dipping form.  You cannot go wrong either way, it is so delicious.  Their udon is delicious too, I think it is cause of their broth.  So flavorful but not too overdone.

Their prices are fair, for the quality.  I got the stuffed calamari and it was good because the breading was not too thick.  I could not figure out how it was stuffed though.  Their unagi was so good, nice and thick pieces that did tasted amazing.  I am craving more of it now, sad that I have to drive so far for it. They have a location in Torrance that I've heard is just as good but even then Torrance is quite a drive for me.  

It is in an odd little location that you probably would completely miss unless you were looking for it.

4744327,2013-01-25,2,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"When I get a craving for noodles, I-Naba is where I turn to.  I didn't grow up eating soba, and at first glance these dishes seem simple and expensive.  After trying soba noodles at other restaurants, I can say that I-Naba delivers the most balanced and satisfying soba dishes that I've tried.  Whether served cold or hot, in the summer or winter, I-Naba completely satisfies me in a way that few restaurants manage to do.

Choosing your meal involves a few choices, none of which will disappoint you.  Decide on the type of dish (hot or cold), type of noodle (soba or udon), and if you want a combo or not.  Combos include several options to eat with your noodles, including tempura, sashimi, and a variety of vegetables.  Over summer I've come to enjoy the Ten Zaru Soba, a cold dish served with shrimp and vegetable tempura on the side (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-naba-las-vegas?select=iR40c0u-T28dF5_aA4Htfg#iR40c0u-T28dF5_aA4Htfg).

Service is attentive and very polite.  The restaurant has a quieter ambiance, with cool string instrumentals of popular music playing in the background (I've heard Beatles and Canon in D).

And what I liked was they put the noodles into the cold soba broth so I didn't need to dip my noodles in with each bite [for the lazy eaters]. And the broth wasn't too overpowering or anything. It was just perfect. The sashimi tasted very fresh. The chirashi came with a slice of tuna, salmon, scallop, shrimp, tamago, and spicy tuna at the bottom over the rice with seaweed strips sprinkled on top. I'm usually not a fan of spicy tuna but there's is amazing! It's not mushed up like other places but just chopped into cubes where the fish is still whole so I don't feel like I'm getting any fillers in it like the usual spicy tuna. I-Naba's spicy tuna has a kick tho!! They mix it with fresh wasabi which was amazing. I definitely recommend this set! I was full off of this but if you're a big eater tho.. Go ahead and order the noodles and bowl separately since the sets are half orders of each. Ah and the salad dressing was veryy yummy too and I'm not even a fan of dressing on my salad.

We usually share the Chirashi Combination ($14) and have it with cold Udon.  I love their little chirashi - it's the perfect size for lunch and the price can't be beat.  The Husband usually eats up the udon on his own.  (I did once make the mistake of eating all the chirashi and udon myself and I was beyond full.)  Sometimes their chirashi can be such a pleasant surprise with scallops and the like.  Other times, it's filled with the standard tuna, salmon, and ikura.  I was actually disappointed that squid wrapped with shiso wasn't in my most recent order.

Sometimes we throw in a few of their other items:

* Kakuni ($6) - Braise black pork belly, enough said.

* Salmon Oshizushi ($7) - It's pressed cured salmon with salmon eggs.  The Little Guy loves salmon eggs, so that's why we added this to our order.  It's something we've only ordered once and not again though.

* Nasu Agedashi ($5) - Fried eggplant served in a dashi broth and more salmon eggs.  Again, this was something we ordered because of the extra ikura, but not something that we have since repeated.

* Roasted Chilean Seabass - This one came off their Specials board and it was so yummy!  Great choice.

* Sesame Trio Dessert - Again, another one from the Specials Board and what a treat!  The creme brulee, the macaron, and the ice cream were all so good! 

Service - we love when we are remembered and the waitress automatically brings a bowl and silverware for the Little Guy.  She also remembered our egg allergy and came out after our order was put in to remind me that I didn't request tamago out of my chirashi!  Yay for her!

Freshly made.  Preservative free.  Perfectly cooked.  Delicious earthy taste finishing with a clean, starch flavor.

Ordering is simple.  Soba or udon.  Cold or hot.  6' tall, size zero exotic with legs that go on forever or more to love, voluptuous beauty with curves in all the right places.  (Caught your attention huh?  I mean noodles only or combo) 

The cold (zaru) soba is the best dish.  The udon is unusually thin but flavorful.  Cold it has a chewy, heavy, mouth feel that becomes boring.  Hot, despite the flavorful broth, one dimensional in flavor.  The hot soba suffers the same fate.

Eat the soba in its entirety before any side dish.  The proper way?  Add wasabi and scallion to the soba then dip it in the tsuyu.  Do not to dip the wasabi.  Slurp.  Repeat.  The goal is to enjoy the subtle differences between bites thanks to the randomness of wasabi / scallion ""grab"".  (I'm being serious).

Little known fact: slurping is important as it provides comedy to everyone else at your table.  Little speckles of tsuyu on your face and shirt!  

Starters / sides are straight forward.  The nasu agedashi (fried eggplant in dashi) is excellent. Not oily and incredibly flavorful as it sucks up the dashi.  Salmon eggs add the perfect salty, briny foil.  The kakuni (perfectly braised pork belly with its melting fat complimented by grated daikon) and the Battera (zesty, cured mackerel ""sushi"") are both worthy.

An incredible addition to the Vegas Asian food scene.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,17,14,4,CbkWvOl4yHw3VELSnPNL-Q

I grew up eating cold soba noodles. My mom would make them to keep cool during the hot Summer months. And I loved them! However, the noodles I ate were dried in a package thats probably been sitting on the shelf for a year. And the sauce came pre-made in a bottle. I first came across 'real' soba last year in California. So my heart skipped a beat to find out Inaba was joining the family of authentic Japanese restaurants in town.

SOBA: Chilled buckwheat noodles topped with nori were served alongside a bowl of tsuyu (sauce). I added the scallion and wasabi and got to dipping. A noodle is a noodle is a noodle--NOT. Noodles, like everything else have flavor. And in a soba dish, especially one served cold, the taste and bite of a noodle can make it or break it. This excellent dish can only be described as delicate, fresh, and clean. After I finished my noodles, my server brought over a cup of the water the soba noodles were cooked in. You mix the hot water with the tsuyu and drink. He informed me that its full of vitamins and very good for you! The soba was also served with a side of fried rice. A dash of soy sauce and some togarashi, it didn't stand a chance.

VARIETY: With the warm weather upon us, I needed a refreshing pick-me-up. But there are hot soup options available which I will be digging into next time. The star of our appetizers was the Battera Mackerel. In traditional Osaka style, the mackerel is served square. The filet is pressed in a box which results in a thin piece of fish and its cube shape. It was unusual, but it is now my favorite mackerel in Las Vegas. It was cured just right! The Nasu (Eggplant) Agedashi was lightly fried and served just like my usual agedashi tofu. Although delicious, I would've liked the eggplant a little softer. I ordered the sausages for my friend who needed something particularly savory. But I stole one for myself. Tasty, but skippable.

DRINKS: Boricha (roasted barley tea) is served in place of water. I believe you can order hot tea for an added cost. And I didn't see any alcohol on the menu either.

SERVICE: The two servers were so polite it hurt. I love the Japanese. They were sweet-natured and apologized for the smallest of infractions.

Like my eating partner, I can imagine many people leaving here underwhelmed and dissatisfied. How many people do you know would leave the house for cold soup? But for those of us who can appreciate the simplicity of Japanese cooking, this specialty restaurant is doing everything right. They treat you and your food with the utmost respect it deserves.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,35,31,5,oAM0okn8Ef7IefuaGqx7MA

Besides the amazing Yuzu Limeade, I didn't enjoy much of the rest of my meal.

Yuzu Limeade ($2.50): Made in-house with Mint and Lime. This is very good! Tart, and tasty...makes my mouth water thinking about it!

I ordered the Katsu-Don ($9): Breaded Pork Cutlet over Rice. This has a TON of RAW EGG and onion in here. The egg makes the pork soggy and leaves a bit of an odd taste...and every bite has raw ONION in it.  Gross!

I paid the extra $4 for some Soba Noodles since they were recommended to me. These were just ok...I don't understand the hype here. The broth is a bit boring, and the noodles didn't do much for me personally.

I tried some of Eva's Agedashi Tofu ($5): Tofu in Dashi Broth with Grated Daikon Radish. Pretty good, and I am not really a fan of tofu. The broth helps out a lot here. 

Can't say I will be back, but it seems like most others enjoy their food here, so you probably will too.  I'd just recommend staying away from their Katsu...there are MUCH better choices in town.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,5,2,2,iCYrY2mIC-GDPUHV64F6zw

I ordered the Ten Zaru
It came with cold soba noodles with some seaweed. You dipped it into this sauce (high concentrated broth) and it was delicious! The texture was similar to al dente of pasta. The broth was savory! You can add wasabi/green onions to your sauce.

With that order, it came with soy sauce seasoned rice, which was okay to me.. Not a fan of the rice. But the shrimp and vegetable tempura were really good! Probably one of the best tempuras I've ever had. It was so fresh, the batter wasn't overdone or floury. Also, it came with a side of curry flavored salt and green tea flavored salt for your tempura.. that was a first, I really liked it!

The meal was really good. I was able to eat it all and be satisfied... so for people with larger appetites, like men, you might have to order more!

The location is in Chinatown in this older plaza. All the workers have really great mannerism and was very attentive to us. I definitely recommend it!",x3ZmjvgHB2-HI6VGTU7z6Q,2,2,4,f9Ev4QND372XZ6ETgZHs1A

The interior decor was very simple and bring surrounded by all Japanese customers made this place all the more authentic. With all the meals, excluding the 'small bites' come with your choice of either soba or udon noodles with a cold or hot broth. We ordered a variety of small bites including fried soba chips which were buckwheat chips served with a side of wasabi guacamole. Next we ordered the calamari with stuffed vegetables lightly battered and fried served with a side of tempura sauce. The braised black pork belly followed after. Overall the presentation for the food was amazing but the taste was not so impressive, merely just okay. The chips were simple, and tasted just like wonton chips; calamari was very tough and chewy, but the taste itself was well balanced with the herbs and carrots; finally the black pork belly was good but lacking the full robust flavor like the one from Goyemon. For entree we ordered Battera sushi ( 4 pieces of mackerel nigiri served with cold soba noodles), chirashi sushi bowl (as seen in Seven Magazine served with hot udon noodles), and the Tori Udon (served with chicken and egg). As mentioned before the presentation was exquisite but again lacking the 'wow' feature. Dont get me wrong, the noodles were well cooked and the broth was savory, but it tastes like any other both you can get from another Japanese restaurant. For dessert we orders the buckwheat crepe served with side of red bean, ice cream, and topped with walnuts and honey. The crepe itself was very soft and spongy and okay. 

When you come to I-Naba, this place makes you think about what a traditional Japanese noodle house would look feel, and taste like. Very simplistic place to get dinner! I think this place would've been more enjoyable if our food came out faster. Although the place was small, when it's full with people maybe the cooks can't crank out the order as fast. As a result everyone who was ordered were waiting for quiet a while. Four stars overall!!",dA0QWjx56wIVbGaL_r52mQ,1,0,4,ocDtTXIqKwhSjQStFx_Jlw
5307730,2014-05-20,4,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"There's no post-meal guilt here; satisfaction all the way. The noodles come with more food than I can eat, but that just means a better variety for whomever I've with (I'm a charitable meal partner, what can I say? ""Try this! Eat half of it!""). 

The vegetable ten zaru soba, along with the soba noodles and sauce (accompanied with green onions and wasabi), comes on a neat little tray with a bowl of rice and a varied tempura with dipping sauce and salts. It's not always guaranteed you'll be served the nutritious soba broth to pour into the sauce afterwards, but when you do, it's a nice extra treat. Consider it your lucky day if you want.

I'm also a fan of the yuzu limeade (in its entire citrus-y glow and fresh tastes), the satsuma-age (fried fish cake), and the chawanmushi (super comforting steamed egg custard). I've heard many compliments on the kakuni (braised pork belly), and how it can be savored alone or with a bowl of rice, but I'll leave that to those who are more fond of meat than I am.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,9,9,5,0AQ_agtMfu37etCnQTfpGg

I know I-Naba is THE place if you want soba but I honestly am not a huge fan of soba ... but, they also have udon. Now, I LOVE udon and I simply adore the ones at I-Naba. 

No, there's nothing particularly special and out of the world at I-Naba but you will find something quite comforting: noodle in hot soups! Not only do they have those but they also have sushi to their menu, although not as extensive as some would want it to be. 

So far, I've tried their Niku (beef) with soba/udon in hot soup, salmon and ikura with sushi rice bowl, and nabeyaki udon. 

I simply love their udon. I prefer my udon on the thicker side and I love how al-dente it is. Its still got a bite to the noodles! Yummy! Their niku udon is solid. As for their nabeyaki, they say it's got seafood and chicken and it does. It has clams, squid, and a piece of delicious salmon in it. However, I would've probably liked it more if it had more veggies. I don't particularly care for the clams or squid ... but the salmon was yummy! 

Their salmon and ikura bowl was really good as well. Their salmon is cut on the thinner side but it always looks and tastes fresh. Same for their ikura. Sometimes I just want this bowl with some udon ...and for lunch, they have that! They have a combo where you get udon with a smaller version of the salmon and ikura bowl. However, the type of noodles in the combo that you get are a thinner version of the udon. 

Anywhos, I've never had a bad meal here and the prices are decent. I also don't have anything bad to say. I love I-Naba and will continue coming here :D !",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,1,4,7mp5_jHt3x0Th6mrED4xVQ

5390419,2013-03-19,2,OiqDNSdnchr8zQhiMSInLQ,"I-Naba had been near the, if not atop my must try restaurants for quite some time now.  Unfortunately my friends and I, okay mostly my friends, tend to be creatures of habit and 100 check ins to Shabu Shabu Paradise and Bachi Burger combined later and I still had yet to try these noodles I'd fantasized about ever since watching Anthony Bourdain eating them on some snowy mountain in Japan (yes I had fantasies based upon another man slurping noodles.   Deal with it)

Well a month or so ago I finally got my chance to make fantasy reality.  My friend that accompanied me was excited to see they had Asahi Black as a beer option, and seeing someone excited by default makes me excited.   We continued the excitement with an order of excellently prepared edamame.  So far so good.   There was so much I wanted to try on the menu but because it was cold outside I decided to go with the ten kake hot soba noodles with tempura on the side.  I felt the same sense of excitement as I did from when I was in middle school and snuck into the discount theater by my house to watch Basic Instinct.  BRING ME THE GOOD STUFF.   

Finally the noodles arrived, and within seconds I was getting down with noodles like Sharon Stone.  Unfortunately that's when the excitement stopped.  I'm not going to discount all of my well respected elites and non-elites who love these noodles, nor the tastes of heroes of mine like Anthony Bourdain or Anthony M of Yelp, but I guess I simply don't get it.  The soba noodles just tasted like anything else I've ever had made of buckwheat, and the broth, while soothing as all soup broth is to me, was just too subtle for my liking.   It's quite possible that's the point, that maybe it provides a level of elegance that my tastebuds either just that day or in general might lack a craving for.  I much found myself yearning for a rich ramen broth instead.  I thought the veggie tempura tasted fairly standard, which is to say they were tasty, but they didn't seem fresh out the deep fryer, which is to say they were a little cold.   

Service was extremely friendly throughout, and I thought the pricepoint was extremely reasonable.  Buckwheat disappointment notwithstanding, i-naba certainly deserves a retry from me to explore their other options, many of which sound promising.  I went in expecting Basic Instinct, but left with Sliver (first yelp review in history mentioning both of these movies at once?   You're welcome)",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,3,BctCDG68WsTOMTh9TUx8AA

Before visiting I-Naba, I hadn't eaten soba noodles in nearly two years...I've been thinking (but not really trying to look for) about finding places to eat soba in Vegas so when I heard good things about I-Naba, I decided to drop in for lunch.

It's a cute and casual little place that's easy to find, on the corner of Desert Inn and Decatur. There are potted plants lining the outside and scattered throughout the inside, which makes it seem very natural and neighborhood-friendly. The way tables were set up was very eclectic, lacking that straight-line formation most restaurants use.

The waitress was very helpful and friendly. I particularly appreciated the fact that she didn't judge me for smelling everything and just seemed to be amused by my quirks. Thank you, kind waitress. I tipped you well.

The menu is simple and there are neat little info cards on all the tables describing the nutritional value and components of soba noodles. Now this is what I'm talking about! Love it so much.

I could describe every aspect of I-Naba word-for-word...Except the soba noodles. I can't quite describe it. All I can say is that the noodles are perfectly firm and the dipping broth is mild but somehow maintains its flavor. I got the batteru combo so it came with cold soba and four pieces of pressed mackerel sushi. I normally don't like mackerel but this was just so soft and delicious.

When I finished my meal, the waitress gave me sobayu (the water used to cook the soba) which you mix with the dipping broth and drink it as soup. The sobayu on its own smelled very sweet and fragrant. I literally sat there and inhaled the steam for a good few minutes (this is where the waitress seemed amused). The resulting soup was all kinds of amazing. 

Leaving I-Naba, I felt full but not overly full like I usually do after eating at a restaurant. What a refreshing change.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,13,11,5,sFA6d0ndN65kfsSxCVbDDw

Clearly, the star attraction were the soba noodles. These aren't your typical, store-bought soba noodles that are usually darker grey in color. The soba noodles here are lighter in color, with tiny little specks throughout each noodle. It has a firm and almost chewy consistency, and balanced well with the cold broth. 

Along with the delicate, contrasting crunch of the tempura, everything tasted okay. But yet, something was missing. I can't quite figure it out -- the meal seemed to lack any soul, if that makes sense. 

At any rate, it just seemed like $25 for what we ordered was a bit skimpy. I was still somewhat hungry. Then again, wasn't that what I wanted?

It was a hot and humid day here in Vegas and eating cold soba seemed like the right thing to do! We arrived shortly after they opened for lunch. We were seated right away and there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. 

They have a simple 2-page menu. I ordered the cold Zaru Soba. My husband ordered the same along with a Katsu-Don. The soba noodles were thin and cooked perfectly (not too hard, not too soft). The dipping sauce was refreshing and made just right, not very salty, but not bland either. They were sooo good that I wish the portion size was bigger, but I guess you can't go wrong for $8. If you are looking to eat light, this is definitely a good place! My husband liked the soba as well. He liked the Katsu-Don, but they did put a lot of green onions in it. Ewww. We were disappointed that they no longer had the ""Green Tea Trio"" for dessert. Our server told us that they had it a long time ago, when they had a chef dedicated to only making desserts. But not anymore. :( So I ordered the green tea ice cream and my husband ordered the Shiratama Anmitsu. Normally I don't really care for green tea ice cream, but this one was actually very good. The green tea flavor wasn't overpowering like how it usually is everywhere else. It was light and tasted more like a sorbet. 

I like how most of their food is freshly made in-house. The servers were very polite, friendly and attentive as well. I think the only bad thing about this place is their hours.

I still believe the two chicks who work here are the best when it comes to customer service, and they do work very hard. 

.....But, listen very closely because I got something to say about INABA..... 

INABA LAS VEGAS has recently gotten their liquor license. Unfortunately, this has resulted in tragedy for anyone of proud Japanese lineage.  The other night, I came back to INABA to find it packed with hipsters, emos, scene kids, and ""Wine & Cheese"" people. Everyone was piss drunk and shouting like idiots. The sophisticated Japanese fine-dining atmosphere had been raped and sodomized by drunk Vegas douchebaggery.  To make things worse, the huge group of ""Wine & Cheese"" people were doing nothing but shouting racist jokes,  and sexual references.   Japanese women are very polite and they tend to just ignore things like that, and that's exactly what the waitresses did. What I didn't understand was that one of the drunk white dudes kept walking into the kitchen every couple of minutes. Is this guy somehow associated with the business? 

The positive thing about this situation is that the noodles actually tasted better during my recent visit. The zaru soba tasted like it was made fresh in the morning. The texture was very chewy, and the length of the noodles was very long. The vegetable tempura was kind of cold this time though. 

I don't think I'm ever coming back to INABA because it has become the new Ichiza. INABA will do well here in Vegas. And I only wish the best for the owner.
