49846,2015-09-08,1,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,Checked out a new place for dinner. Henry the owner served us and he gave us great service. The food on the menu is fairly priced. Will definitely come back when i want to have a drink and munch on food. The decor is fun and hip.

520438,2015-03-12,0,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,"This restaurant is AWESOME! The place is a factory style Japanese yakitori. 

A great selection of yakitori to choose from. 

Some of the best selection include lamb, smoked pork yakitori, chicken yakitori and rice ball. 

I'm usually not a big fan of lamb and pork as these type of meat tend to have smells. However, Haza has done a great job eliminating the meat smell. The smoke pork yakitori is a must have! It melts in your mouth with great texture. 

Friendly service provided a dining experience. Highly recommended to anyone!",b-mo6nakAWzMuySL95htTQ,4,1,5,KM3Dd1P6r--4m4rTxlp3Qw

894613,2015-10-05,2,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,"Unfortunately we will not be returning to this place. My boyfriend read great reviews about haza in the newspaper so we were excited to try it out. When we arrived we were very impressed by the décor and ambiance. It is beautifully decorated with string lights and drapes. All of the lamps appear to be handmade from liquor bottles. There is a projector screen and they have a nice winery atmosphere. They seem to have repurposed crates and the tables are made out of wood. I love the décor. Even the plates, glasses, and silverware were nice. It is very hip and classy. That was probably the only good thing about this place. 

First off, their soda machine was down so we had nothing to drink but water. So we decided to order sake. We didn't even drink it. It was bland and I have had sake several times before. Then we ordered ginger soup. It was awful. It tasted like hot ginger water. Like I could have boiled ginger myself and served it. Then we asked for something else so we go miso soup. Same thing, just hot water. The skewers are not described properly on the menu. It says 4 and that apparently does not mean four, it means four pieces of chicken not skewers. Waste. Then we ordered the grilled mackerel. It smelled like dirty ____. Nasty. We did not eat it. The food was very disappointing in general. We had higher expectations and thought this would be our new ""go-to"" restaurant. 

So we spent almost $90 and left the restaurant starving, annoyed, and unsatisfied.",KeKu4ub03KcMtV5F9-i5pQ,4,1,1,Mz5PUuM1V9XQD7l44MsVqw
1049939,2015-05-21,0,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,"This new Japanese restaurant has a beautiful interior. From the lamps made from liquor bottles to the curtain projector screen to the jazz band, this place is trying extra hard to create a unique atmosphere. At first their menu looked pricy but the place and food is worth the pricing. Their food has great presentation and their portions are right for their price. Their menu is a bit small but they have a decent variety for everyone to enjoy something. On to the food!...the Haza Grilled Corn was interesting but I don't know if if try it again. The Soft Shell Crab was amazing and breaded perfectly. It kind of look like a giant spider but I tasted wonderful. It comes with some fresh seaweed and lettuce but I didn't touch it because the Soft Shell Crab tasted good with rice. The Grilled Mackerel was literally their best dish here. I will come back to this restaurant just to eat it. The Chicken Wings Skewers were decent but it wasn't too special, it more of something to order to help me get full. My only critique is the Clam Ginger Soup, I could not even eat a little but if it because the broth tasted so fishy like the clams weren't clean and the ginger was too strong for me. I wish they had a regular miso soup instead. Lastly, they only offered Tempura Ice Crem which made me sad because what Japanese restaurant doesn't offer Mochi Ice Cream:( other than that, I would come back mainly for the atmosphere and the Grilled Mackerel.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,2,0,4,jjPUwftWClhbtcBVLkQN2A

The food was subpar at best and was not seasoned well! Ambiance  was great really artsy and earthy however if they think they will make it off their ambiance alone they forget they can forget it!!

1837001,2015-03-13,11,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,"From the start, service was an issue. Our server explained their menu by saying, ""this isn't like Outback where each person orders one thing, you order a bunch of stuff to share.""  Then we were given metal forks and knives to eat our dishes, while Asian customers were given chopsticks. I guess I look too white to know anything about Japanese food? I found the (also white and female) server's assumptions  to be laughably offensive.

On top of that, we were given the wrong bill. How you manage to mix up your tables when there are only two parties in the entire building is beyond me. 

The only reason I'm giving more than a single star is because Chef Henry came out and introduced himself, which was much appreciated. Other staff were sitting around talking or playing with their phones.

Menu is limited, dishes were average and bland.
CLAM GINGER SOUP: Tasted like ginger water.
MISO FISH SOUP: Large bowl of miso soup with fish instead of tofu. Very simple.
VEGETABLE TEMPURA: artistic presentation, but tempura coating was very thin and falling off. Server forgot the dipping sauce.
VINEGAR GRILLED MACKEREL: Decent chunk of mackerel, wish the skin was crisper. 
SAUCE GRILLED SQUID: Generous portion but very rubbery, bland despite the sauce.
STIR FRIED UDON: Ample serving of chewy noodles and veggies, comforting flavors.
Nothing stood out as something I would come back for.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,3,2,DyE2rhfH2cv46HQaO99bzg

2393711,2015-06-10,1,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,"New, chic and hip lounge in Vegas! This is definitely a new hot spot to check out conveniently located on Spring Mountain and Jones and only a few minutes away from the Strip! Everything from the décor to the food, the owner has put in his best detailed work! I had the opportunity to talk to Henry, the owner, and he told me a little background of the restaurant. I find it incredible that the owner hand-crafted every single table and center pieces for his restaurant. He took a class to learn how to weld and made the rustic, mixed with modern elegance tables that you see when you walk in! The color schemes are also very stylish! It is silver and purple-- a very modern look! The restaurant has large windows so you can see what is going on from the outside! I love that design and look that really makes the restaurant stick out from other lounges.

Of course, ambiance is important... but most importantly, the food! There is great selection of different types of food you want to try! From yakitori appetizers to whole deep fried fish! I was able to try many different things on the menu! I love the yakitori. You can choose from chicken wings, chicken skin, pork belly, beef, and etc. Not many places have chicken skin as a choice, but I was very impressed! It is packed with flavor and had the perfect crunch. I also tried the appetizer shooter. It was very different, but good to taste. It had a citrus flavor packed with seaweed and other delicious seafood in that small cup. My favorite would be the lamb chops! It was cooked perfectly and was very tender. I also had the whole fried fish which was a special that day. The fish was already chopped up and deep fried and put back into the fish as presentation. It was a very beautiful and tasty as well! I love whole deep fried fish. The price is also very reasonable. For about $15/person, you will have plenty of food and drinks and endless night of entertainment!

Overall, great dining experience! It is very chic and hip and a fun place to hang out after work and let your tie loose!",SWCLYANLMiXiPhW0mzicVQ,5,2,5,rmHCHJpBTE1EJ3Qi70zyzg

Food was pretty subpar. Tempura pretty tasteless, Clam Ginger soup bland, and the squid was rubbery. I did like the mackerel, even though the skin could of been more crispy. 
I would say the biggest problem is service. No chop sticks ?? Hmm, very strange. Attitude of our service probably even more strange, as we were told how to order and eat. We were also told that this place and I quote ""Isn't like Outback"", where you each order an entrée. Hmm, okay now it was just starting to feel insulting.

       - Gaming the System? - When most of your 5 star reviews are from people with barely any reviews, you can bet that the owner of this restaurant has friends. On the other hand, all the low star reviews are from people with lots of reviews.
       - Decor - There's an unfinished industrial look to this with interesting paintings on the side and unique decoration. It's definitely interesting.
       - Seating - The metal/wood benches they have for tables loss their appeal when you realize they're uncomfortable and you have no back support throughout your entire meal. Made me feel like cheap cafeteria seats again.
       - Price hike - Looking at a menu from last July, I realize that they really upped their prices while bringing down their portion and quality. That's one way of increasing revenue.
       - Tip - When you run your card through those ipad card readers, they usually give you 3 preset %'s and a custom. Those are usually 15%, 18%, and 20%. This place however had the options 20%, 23%, and 25%. Really? You rip off your customers and then expect a 25% tip? This isn't the Eiffel tower restaurant. I didn't see my napkin folded on my seat when I came back from the restroom.
       - Fuku Burger - After spending almost $50 at leaving hungry, we went to FUKU burger in the same shopping plaza. That's how small their portions are.
**Ordered**
       - $10.88 Stir Fried Udon - Bland udon fried in bacon and garlic. Portion size was tiny and it wasn't very special at all.
       - $3.88 Chicken Heart Yakitori - 2 skewers of 3 small pieces that didn't taste very good.
       - $4.88 Chicken Skin Yakitori - Out of everything, this restaurant's one silver lining was the chicken skin skewers. The crispiness of the chicken skin was very good.
       - Yelp Check-in Chicken Yakitori - 3 of the most dry skewers I've had in a while.
       - $20.88 Grilled Lamb - When you pay 20 bucks for 4 tiny rack of lamb riblets, you begin to wonder to yourself if you should of read the reviews of this place before coming here or just see that it was 4.5 stars. Let me tell you, I won't be making that mistake again.
**Recommendations**
       - I would never recommend this place. It has Gordon Ramsey Steak prices with tapas portions and barely above par taste.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,7,4,1,_twFt-0lJPxWvP4pJCs2Qg
5569519,2015-08-01,0,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,"I went here for the first time with friends last night.  I loved it.  We ordered a selection of dishes, all of which were cooked to order.   This food is Japanese Yakatori cuisine and well worth trying if you haven't already.

The dishes were prepared and brought out as they were made with the heavier flavors being last.  The ingredients were all fresh.  I liked the contemporary decor and ambience.  

We had the grilled squid, mackerel, grilled hamachi kama jaw, soft shell crab and we ordered a second portion of the lamb chops which were truly exquisite.  Henry and his wife, the owners, were very welcoming and helpful.

I will definitely come back next time I am in Las Vegas-----I just wish we had this place in San Diego where I live.  This place is a rare gem waiting to be discovered.",PP14R1qOKf3MmA-GICa1cw,0,0,5,_JNmh8C2NenAV-qcczpN-A

5923384,2015-03-02,4,WJWFSF3o83yl2jHDKbScJg,"As a new-found regular of this place, I can definitely say this is a great hang-out spot for big groups of friends. Servings were made to share and everything is made to go with the only beer they carry: Sapporo.

Let me see if I can help you down the menu:

Firstly, Appetizers: Seafood salad has so much ocean life variety, there will be enough for your hungry group to munch on and still have room for everything else on the menu! Honorable mention from this section goes to the Grill Slice Beef Salad for being a healthy dish without missing out on how awesome the kitchen can cook its meat

Fried: I personally love the HAZA Special Fried Tofu from this section! This dish is not like any typical fried tofu from other restaurants I've eaten fried tofu in. Other than how deliciously perfect this dish is, tofu servings are pretty big for how much it costs! You definitely get a bang for your buck with this one. Japan- style Calamari would have to be my second love from this section. You get to choose whether you want the leg or the body. Note to self for when I want something different the next time I order calamari here.

Grill: Vinegar Grill Mackerel is a much try! It's probably the first dish I fell for on the menu. There is nothing much to say about the Shiogama, but that it is one of the most special dishes HAZA has.

Yakitori: cannot pick favorites here. The secret sauce they have for the different Yakitori servings is something I'd pay money to buy in a bottle and dip anything grilled in.

Last, but not the least, Dish: 3 dishes on this section that are note-worthy: the Stir-Fried Udon, the Rice Ball and the Grill Lamb. I'm not one to jump on the idea for dry noodles (none I've tried were too memorable to say the least), but this one is so tasty! Couple your dishes with rice balls; you won't go wrong. And if there is one thing you have to get out of all the ones I've just recommended, it'll be the Grill Lamb. Single-handedly will turn you!

Top 5, in no particular order:
1. HAZA Special Fried Tofu - Fried
2. Vinegar Grill Mackerel - Grill
3. Stir Fried Udon - Dish
4. Grill Lamb - Dish
5. Shiogama

Next time you're in the area, try this place out. I've loved my experience every time I come in. I hope you will too!",K_hNFPXdzKuEhBN1i7hhEw,8,3,5,VfS9mTbyOsQj5JDnJT3C7A
