George's deli is pretty fair priced, I got the George's special in a small size. Plus any order sandwich small or large comes with a free side of potato or macaroni salad, and you get a free drink with Yelp check in.

I got the macaroni salad which was pretty mediocre, nothing overly different from any other macaroni salad I ever had but you know, everything tastes better when it's free.
 
The sandwich on the other was pretty good. I mean I only had like 5 min to eat it being that I was pressured to rush back and clock back in to work, but from the few bites that I actually chewed, the sandwich wasn't dry at all or greedy with the deli fillings. For a full meal that was only 7$ and tasted better than subway (well I guess that's not saying much.. Sorry subway)

..George's deli was a pretty good deal, I wouldn't mind trying it again when ever I get another 15 min break to run over and eat lunch.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,0,0,4,OCujTKgsu0vxs8ky3l9QXA

He even asked if I'd like to try a sample of it. I was also told that they opened a month and a half ago, and that they would begin offering delivery about the middle of June 2015.

George Jr was very friendly and helpful and made a good spokesman for the deli.

I had the George's Special sandwich and a side of marinated artichokes. Their selection of chips and sides was fairly small, but appropriate for a fairly new restaurant keeping things fresh.

They slice the bread in 3's so it was interesting to see that when I opened it up. Customer service was great and even though I had onions I was still fairly pleased with what I got. Bread was crispy but soft inside and the Turkey to bread ratio was decent. Overall, the cost is a bit on the pricier side in my opinion, but it was a great sandwich.

I had the pastrami sandwich and was very impressed with quality of pastrami. The flavor was there and it tastes great. The downside, and it cost them a star, is there simply wasn't enough and it wasn't spread throughout the sandwich. The last inch or so, of each end, was completely devoid of meat. Maybe next time will see if they'll add extra.

Everything else is really nice. The ambiance is good, for a sandwich place, price was somewhat OK, and everything is spotlessly clean!
