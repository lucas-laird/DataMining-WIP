As we returned to our hotel room one Saturday night in Vegas to freshen up to go out and gamble, we thought we'd save some time and order up some pizza so it would be there after showers and primping. The day before, we found a flyer stuck to our room door for Top This Pizza and we figured we'd utilize the good coupon deals they were offering. I called the establishment several times, but the call didn't go through (tried on cells and the landline in the room) so I placed the order online. They called about fifteen minutes later to confirm the order. Then an hour and a half goes by.  I figured ok, it's Saturday night at 11pm in Vegas. Understandable. Finally, the delivery man calls my cell and says he's downstairs at the valet and would I come down there to pick up the pizza. I asked him why he wasn't coming up to the room and he informed me that they did not deliver to the rooms, even though they called previously to confirm the order and the room number.  I was pretty surprised, and as I was still trying to get ready to go out for the night, I sent another one of our party down with some cash to pick it up.  Several minutes later he called again asking where I was. I reminded him that I sent someone down and described the person collecting the pizza. He called twice more in a matter of minutes, becoming ruder and ruder as I assured him that our friend was indeed down at the valet looking for him, and had been for several minutes.  We asked again why we paid a $6 delivery charge if they refuse to deliver the pizza to the room to which he replied, ""We don't like to deliver to that location.""  We then told him to shove the pizza up his butt and went downstairs to Johnny Rockets instead.  Glad I was paying cash! Save yourself some aggravation and do NOT order from these clowns.",7MuF6U2wbZI8fwXQgPllOQ,3,1,1,kaqfu1JQfmNvu-BAXHV9aw

I waited 5 minutes and left. I came back at 1245 and asked again and was told it would be another 15 to 20 minutes. The only reason I kept trying was I was doing laundry next door.

Ordered a 16"" with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers for delivery. When it got here I was amazed at how little cheese was on it, which sure to the lack of made the rest of the toppings dry out pretty badly, and since mushrooms start out pretty dry to begin with, not having a protective layer of cheese makes them almost inedible. The sauce was decent, so I give them credit on that part, but it wasn't applied fully to the edges of the pie which made some slices inconsistently crusty-er than others. I will probably not be ordering from this spot again, I don't feel that the quality of the food is justifiable with their pricing (my pizza with delivery charge came out to about $25) as I can get better quality pizza for 2/3rds the price almost anywhere.",FZIB7hJwHIAL_hHwlc6tJA,1,0,2,8v-WOVxj5jrTjhb2z3jh6w

Called me to ask where he was supposed to deliver and i was like what the heck i gave you guys the address and he said he has the address but he's not gonna drive around trying to find the hotel. Are you serious? He had the most unpleasant attitude and demeanor when he finally arrived. Oh and before that, someone calls me from the restaurant asking me for my credit card number. I was like,  uh i am not giving you that since i ordered through grubhub.

4496272,2012-11-13,0,Ijdoi6pDMK3Burw3TtAOZg,"Despite the response posted by the business 6+ months after this terrible experience, I stand by my original review. The original, incorrect pizza was NOT gone when the delivery driver returned, as the response stated; in fact, I reviewed the emails exchanged between myself and the Customer Care department at Eat24 following this experience, and verified through those messages that there was more than half of the original pizza available to be returned after my very hungry roommate ate, as he had been instructed to do. Most importantly, the only real reason to dignify this absurd, overdue response to my original review is to respond to the claim that I'm attempting to hurt their business. When the incorrect $50 order was received, I asked to return the complete, untouched order and receive a refund. I was lied to and manipulated as the business tried every trick in the book not to correct the situation, finally being delivered the correct pizza FOUR HOURS after the order had been placed. Stating that they had gone 14 miles round trip to correct the error seems to be moot, as 1.) any business with even a modicum of customer service skills would have corrected their error without question from the start, and 2.) at no time did the reply address the fact that whomever was operating their shop that night had lied outright to both myself (the customer) and Eat24 (the business by whom they were represented during this comedy of errors).

Please note that Eat24 issued a full refund of the money spent on this order due to the fact that the Eat24 Customer Care Rep stated that all of his communication with this establishment had been exactly as I'd stated, as he was actually the person with whom the ""owner"" spoke that night. Eat24 also cited the fact that the business did not take reasonable steps to correct the issue when presented acceptable solutions. More than 6 months have passed; this situation should have been addressed at the time, when it was more than a ""he said, she said"" scenario. 

I proudly support local, especially family-owned, businesses, as I myself used to be part-owner of a small business that, after nearly 20 years in the family, was unable to compete with large corporations. I will not, however, blindly support a business that, when faced with a simple error, takes astronomical steps to avoid providing basic customer service and conflict resolution.",wqPHUkjqoTkOWYDOiS9odw,4,0,1,LW9oFxr13ljxjQq7IFDNgg
