The chips had no taste the salsa tasted like tomatoe juice.  The gentleman playing the music was good maybe alittle close to the table when we were eating, kinda hard to have a conversation but he was good. We are in Vegas a lot through out the year and like to eat where the locals eat but I can say I don't think we will ever make it back here.",t5rY60bdg_-hBqQaQwW0tQ,0,0,2,AtxMtQCUPsJcX1D_X9Gsmg

The prices are kind of insane considering the food isn't very good.
Even the rice,beans,and salsa sucked. I mean,how do you manage to mess THAT up?

We ordered oysters,menudo,camarones a la diabla, and some kind of fish filet. Taste-wise,It ranged from gross to eh.

The service,however,was good.
We weren't ignored ever so I'm giving them the second star.

I'll probably never go back though.",nliXQN8mJsHM6bSjtxqV4Q,1,0,2,45zyN-dNFJWZf3b8KINQBA
1872586,2009-10-29,0,wYEAocX0vkcGN-i5rSszrg,"El Patron is truly a hidden gem in a somewhat seedy strip mall. From the outside it looks like a typical Americanized Mexican joint circa 1979, however, upon entry we were transported to a Mexican oasis. 

We had a couple of hours to kill before boarding our plane to come home, so we plopped ourselves at a table and decided to give the menu a try. At first glance I was impressed by all of the offerings that spanned way beyond the typical (and boring) burritos and enchiladas. 

We noshed on prepared tableside guacamole, ceviche, appetizer platter, nopales, homemade flour tortillas that arrived at our table warm and a cup of complimentary soup. 

And to top it off, we enjoyed our meal to the sounds of a pretty decent live musician playing everything from Beatles ballads in Spanish to REM tunes in English. 

El Patron is a lesson in not judging a book by its cover.",9IF2ZMnkrZlvxCHcO0h1EQ,0,0,4,T2Y2TxLJoevRcoHmDrRVzQ
1939421,2008-06-18,1,wYEAocX0vkcGN-i5rSszrg,"We are Mexican food fanatics and this place impressed us.  Granted, we are ""gringos"" from the get-go, but in our combined 90-something years on the planet we've eaten a sh**load of Mexican.

Ordered the combo appetizer platter and everything on it was great. Especially enjoyed the quesadilla with authentic Mexican cheese (sorry, I forgot what it is called) oozing forth from it's homemade tortilla blanket.  Great margaritas at $6.50 each.  We each ordered a combo plate for our main meal ... Chili relleno was fabulous and the chili was not overcooked, beef enchilada was chock full of shredded beef, chorizo taco was quite well balanced with the spicy meat and cooling lettuce and chopped tomatoes.  House guac is above average, but El Sombrero on Main St. still has the best I've ever tasted. My husband's combo with carnitas burrito, cheese enchilada and chicken taco was excellent too.  

Service was prompt and friendly. Highly recommended restaurant and do NOT pass on the homemade tortillas.  You have a choice of flour or corn, but I asked for a little of both and they happily accommodated us.  Oh yes ... FYI, they also have one of those roving mariachi duos, if you'd like to be serenaded while you dine.",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,3,1,4,VXuZ2o9iZj40jFEXXcKunA

Passed a billboard for this restaurant on LV Blvd.  Searched yelp for sports bars which lead me off the strip and into scary land.  All the""sports bars"" I visited were horrific to say the least. Just when I was about to give up on football, I coincidentally drive by this restaurant.  The staff was kind enough to seat us in a closed section near the bar so we could watch the game.  We enjoyed salsa and hot re fried beans with chips.  They were having a Sunday brunch buffet which was delicious!  Didn't have the seafood, because I was starving and didn't want to wait.  I would definitely visit again.",kmFM2mmJnzw8cxKAHt40UQ,1,1,4,UsmxqbJiE8THLYCFeN8KRg
2594407,2010-02-21,0,wYEAocX0vkcGN-i5rSszrg,"This place is interesting.  It's got the ambience of upscale, but the owner obviously tries to cover all the bases by making some really down-home dishes.  The nopales salad with white cheese on it is enough to bring me back all by itself.  My only problem with this place, I guess, is I was looking for the place where the locals go, some hole-in-the-wall rice-and-bean joint, and this clearly isn't it.  I'd definitely go back, though.",w0yV8aE6ROzWixLOpu1njg,1,0,4,2zQdLsbH8c6HNHIvyDKT5Q

He says that this is the first restaurant to give her competition (and on a couple items it wins!!! Like the chili rellenos) I like it because its clean and nice.  All of the staff is awesome too!  We live in LA, a mexican food mecca, and we can't wait to go back to Vegas and go to El Patron for their fabulous, muy sabroso food!

but damn if they haven't won me over.

As others have said, the food isn't over the top spectacular...but solid, reasonably priced, and there are a few noteworthy treats on the menu:  nopales (quite authentically prepared), queso con chorizo, and some delicioso-flaming-platanos-drizzled-in-something-or-other-vaguely-alcoholic.   mmmmmm....

The convenience factor is what keeps bringing me back to El Patron.  In and out with no headaches.  Right on Maryland Pkway, easy parking right there, never a wait, instant seats and service...and waiters who remember my orders.  Its also, nice, dark and subdued inside...and you know me...obsessed with all non-neon-slots-stucco-vegas-y places hidden in Vegas.",IQTzpSyZphASEnQS2I0Ckw,0,0,4,6emqzkbm2qCy8-OT4tCfuA

3212197,2010-10-15,4,wYEAocX0vkcGN-i5rSszrg,"Okay, so I am huge fan of Mexican food in general and during the week, this is my lunch spot of choice. They are clean, quick and very affordable. The salsa is spicy enough for most, but if you ask they will bring out a bowl with more heat. Yummo! The lunch specials even include a beverage which is almost never the case. My heart longs for there tasty Horchata which has to be homemade and to me beats every other restaurant in town! I must add it is not included as a beverage in the lunch special, but well worth the $2.50. I usually get the Cheese Enchilada and Chile Relleno Combo which makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The cheese tastes authentic and perfectly melted while the Chile Relleno has this unique kick to it's sauce and the batter isn't too thick. My one dislike of this place is the rice and beans which seem to lack any flavor at all. Regardless, this place has a soft spot in my heart AND my big belly:)",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,3,3,4,GCkkOYWGtiXg0r73ab4qKw
3413422,2010-01-10,0,wYEAocX0vkcGN-i5rSszrg,"Honestly I wasn't really expecting to find anything special in Las Vegas but was taken here at the recommendation of a friend who lived here. Let me just say that the flour tortillas I had were some of the best I have ever had and that's also compared to when I lived in Tucson. They hand make their tortillas in the restaurant and I definitely could taste the freshness. The chips and salsa were okay but on the plus side they made the guacamole from scratch at the table.  However, be warned, the hot salsa is HOT. I think they may use habanero peppers because it had a  really slow intense burn that just lasted and had me tearing up a bit.. 

For my meal I got the pollo patron which had an unique flavor being that it was marinated in a variety of chiles and other spices. The portion was huge and definitely worth the price. When I do return to Las Vegas and want good Mexican food, I'll make sure to stop here. One caveat my friend shared with me. If you're looking for ""Americanized"" Mexican food, there are other places that are better but this is the place to go to for the more authentic plates that you can't get at Chile's or some other place like that.",mow4fZ1VcGDV88JNfXXXjA,0,0,4,7oL2JLojjL-D1MTneDW2HQ

I mean even the guacomole tasted whack.  I had to do my own ghetto cooking at the table to make it taste better.

The reason why I feel bad is because they have some awesome tortillas and their shrimp ceviche is pretty good for las vegas. (which means it still sucks but, it doesn't taste like ass)

Don't go unless you get just tortillas and a beer.  It's too expensive for how bad the food is.",qd16czwFUVHICKF7A4qWsQ,1,1,2,e92iHmM75JVFClo5gJWe9g

I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch special. It was OK. I would've preferred there to be more sauce on the enchilada and some pico de gallo some where on the plate.

The atmosphere felt authentic, I mean, I have been to Mexico and it felt the same? LOL

This place is HUGE!!!  We were seated by the window facing Maryland Pkwy in one of those curvy window alcoves like families go to with kids in a Wendy's.  It was kinda comforting.  We drained our water glasses and tried to get the waiter to leave a pitcher to no avail.
However, we split mixed fajitas (beef, chicken and shrimp) and it came with bell peppers, onions + beans/rice/guac and the evil sour cream.  Both of us got fideo free with the meal.  Chips were good, salsa okay, bean dip decent.
The best and most surprising thing was the tortillas - we had flour - they were so warm and beautifully mis-shapen in homemade-esque fashion.  So we got more and just ate them when the fajitas ran out.
Note..the menu is as big as the place.  Bigger menu than even the Michoacan restaurants I think, if you can believe that.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,2,2,4,HFpbk202wLEqq8d58-JOBQ

Yeah, that band playing a full on concert-length set got pretty annoying after awhile, especially when we started shouting ""WHAT?"" at each other across the table.  But in the times I've been to El Patron, the food's always been good, they serve bean dip with the tortilla chips, and the place has a nice family-run, local feel that makes me go back.  I'm still a fan.",XOSjRes1mDv5H2e3mWKCOw,0,0,4,1-pahJ6d_SSjAmKVjShmNw
5750976,2010-01-24,1,wYEAocX0vkcGN-i5rSszrg,"I really wanted to like this place, because a friend raved about it. In fact when we went, both he and my husband continued to rave about it.

I wasn't impressed. The guacamole was too citrus-y for my liking. The margaritas were weak and tasted way too sweet. My shredded chicken tacos were dry.

The service was pretty good though, they were friendly.

But what sealed it for me was when the 8 or 10-person band came over to play happy birthday to the table next to us and stayed for not one, not two, not three songs ... Well, let me put it this way. We managed to eat dinner, finish our drinks, box up our food, pay and leave. And they were still playing. Unfortunately right next to our table (I couldn't even push my chair back without bumping into someone), so I couldn't hear anything anyone in my party was saying. I would like to say I got into the ambience but it was loud and annoying and sealed the deal in my opinion of the place.",v2HxTx0A8MkJ1oM1yJ4www,0,0,1,VYJiwXl3pypvDp2nWA5DJg
