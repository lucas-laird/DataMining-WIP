We came in here to grab some food before heading out to Freemont for the St Patty's extravaganza. This was my first time trying Jack-n-a-Box since we did not have any in NY. The name ""Jack-n-a-Box""   always makes me think the spoofy version called ""Yak-in-a-Box,"" in a cartoon from my childhood which name I can't remember off the top of my head for some reason.
 
Anyway, I got the Sourdough Jack-burger, which has bacon, swiss cheese,  and  mayo sauce. It was actually pretty good. As for the environment, it was weird in there only because of the people who were totally loitering in there, plus  this place had that weird fast food joint odor.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,1,1,3,f2jwIf24d4KgdDKuXU-cHg

I've tried these at every other fast food place sooo not the same. There Jalapeno Poppers are always hot and fresh with just the right amount of spiciness. 

I like this location because there fast and very generous with the ranch dressing!",hv_M1Kf1EPWDBB1bgnzu6Q,3,2,3,nxItMCMXodZfkv-FNvT5jQ
3832872,2011-09-17,1,yZIA98HUgPYx4BY8iZr3IA,"Ok so while we all have amazing ""palates"" here ;p (which by the way is really the roof of our mouth and not our tongue so not sure why most tend to use it in a ""taste"" term.) Occasionally it is too late; nothings open or were just buzzed and need something in our stomachs.  Lo and behold, Jack In the Box! (""Lo"" by the way is short for ""look"" as in look and behold - yes I looked it up to make sure ;p)

So I went overboard as I just left my local PT's favorite spot and ended up with 2 teriyaki bowls (not so hot tonight the rice was all mealy mashed up), an order of tacos, some jalapeno poppers, 3 egg rolls and an iced caramel coffee. Yea I went way over board lol and did not even eat it all, but hey it was late and I was mega hungry!

This spot I have only been to a few times and its ""a-ok"" for what it is.. and that's Jack in the Box.

I told told the girl I wanted curly fries with the order TWICE!! Took my order and told me to drive up to the parking spot. I was waiting at least for 10 minutes. Don't know why. There was one customer that drove up while I was parked and still managed to get her food first and fast. I'm still waiting and they give me the order with two regular fries. I had drive around to change the order.This whole process took at least 15 minutes. I drive off and find out that she did not put ketchup in the bag even after I asked. The food was good, but the service was horrible. Given the fact that there was no customers inside the restaurant and 2-3 staff members, why just why ??

4034335,2018-05-31,5,yZIA98HUgPYx4BY8iZr3IA,"The twins being hungry for lunch decided that Jack in the Box has something they both will enjoy. This is the first visit to this store and upon entering was highly impressed since the store while only moderately busy with customers was very clean. The cashier was very friendly too. The order process was smooth and uneventful. After I placed the order verbally the cashier even shocked me. He stated, now I'm going to read the order back to you. Then he did just that. When I did finally receive the order it was all correct too. 

I ordered 6 of their Jack taco pairs without the hot sauce and lettuce. When they put lettuce on their tacos it just does not taste properly. Probably since their tacos take a bath in the grease for awhile. This grease bath although bad for one tastes good with their house ranch. I have one twin that likes chicken and she ended up with the chicken sandwich. I ordered this plain too since the sauce does not do any justice to the chicken. My son wanted cow so he had the junior jumbo jack plain too. The cheese and other toppings he does not like. Besides I like mine like this too . I did have to sample the jumbo jack to ensure that it would not poison my son. Mission accomplished it was super good. For the value of the food,quality, and service this Jack in the Box would have Jacks seal of approval too.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,21,14,5,Jhpz8EojMZthTow5SL_b-Q

There is something worse than not having breakfast at all. It's paying for breakfast then finding so many egg shells in it that it's inedible. Of course, since I was driving from one gig to another, I was clear across town and couldn't exactly turn back. I figured the manager should know that her or his cook stinks and needs to learn how to crack an egg. I called the restaurant and told the manager that I had to throw away my breakfast because there were so many egg shells in it. Her reply was, ""Thanks for letting me know."" End of conversation. No I'm sorry, no hey let's send you a coupon or rectify this in some way. Nope.

They CAN NOT manage to get my order right, even though I eat there 2+ times a week. Either forgetting to include all of the tacos that we order, or just decide to give you whatever sandwiches they want to provide for you.

Today, for instance, I was able to get the last of the forgotten items from my last visit, before leaving, I looked through the bag and verified the proper number of items. I get back to work, divvy up the food and notice that instead of giving me one each of the 3 sandwiches that were ordered, they gave me two of one, and one of another.

They decided not to bother answering the phone this time, so I guess it is time to go to corporate to try and get this rectified.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,1,utgWenDxsuHLVGF2a_0owg
