I guess this is a new location. It wasnt busy when i walked in but its like as soon as i was done ordering there was about 5 people that walked in and continued to be busy so my timing was on point!! Got a #17 regular (since i had a coupon for a free sub) its really good!! They use ribeye meat! U serious?! Yes pls! They call out ur name for the order and my sandwich was made really fast. Got the tasty cakes coz i was curious. Sweet tea not so sweet but it was tea. 

Def returning and PAYING for an actual sandwich.  Thumbs up!!",RIroUg2XJyrqzfc-waGZcA,1,1,4,SeG_tr2819fT9XZtRqBJhQ

Both Latoya and Iesha (I hope I did not butcher their names) were extremely friendly and had great customer service. They made all 3 of our sandwiches exactly like we wanted, but their friendly attitude will be why I come back. They found out I was getting married and they were so excited! They even threw in some free cookies with our order all for being a bride. This is how service is supposed to be and they made my day that much better with their upbeat enthusiastic personalities! I would give them 5 stars any day.",yVZUekUwQ6btm_Lu5Gcs7Q,2,1,5,Y1hGImhFLGDBm7IUym0V9g
327435,2016-04-21,0,pKxVsJvj3s9UF1LcnnBrOw,Came back her on Tuesday to get my girlfriend the number 13 again. I never ate at this sub shop before. LaToya recommended me her favorite sub the number 43 a chipolte cheesesteak with peppers and onions. When i say the customer service here is great. She said if didn't like the sandwich she will make me any sandwich on the menu for free. I've never heard of that before. She makes sure you are truly happy before leaving.  The 43 is by far the BEST sub I've had coming from L.A California. Thanks for taking time to talk with me. Good luck to you and your business.,F9PjzUYNpQIE8XdZ3n_HDQ,1,1,5,iaBT4onT8k7DS9_Oovm1Dw

Ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, only got a couple pieces of ham, forgot to heat like i asked, forgot the mayo and onions, so they gave me a mayo packed instead.

The guy who was making our sandwiches was very engaging and asking us all types of questions about where we were from and what we did. You could tell he really enjoyed his job and talking with people. It's not very often that you come across a business like this where everyone seems to be in a good mood and smiling and happy to work, with the public. Food was excellent, as it always is at jersey mikes, but this was an exceptional service that needs to be recognized :)",6y3brTYD1GHdTeaC9Iht_w,0,0,5,6LZBffohZFOvnG72A-CFkg

2675727,2016-09-18,4,pKxVsJvj3s9UF1LcnnBrOw,Jersey Mike's never fails! The man and I came in here to get some cheese steaks. We always get the #56 which is the Big Kahuna Cheese steak. I always get no jalapenos and have them add chipotle mayo. The chipotle mayo adds a really nice flavor to it and makes it so much more creamy! The steak is never dry either. The man got the big kahuna but with chicken instead and the chicken was really good here! It wasn't dry either! And yes I'm surprised because I've had some dry ones in the past at other places haha. The cashier girl was very friendly and didn't seem irritated at all. The man behind the counter was cleaning while we were eating and still started a conversation with us! Great store and nice location. It's right off the 95 on the Rainbow exit. It's in the the Best of the West next to the Chili's! Perfect if you're going shopping in the area and want to swing by. My only complaint is that I wish they (all the stores) would stay open longer! They close from 8-9 every day.,Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,8,7,5,eOQc_837PUPSWN_lh7zujg

The food definitely lived up to the reputation set beforehand. I had the big kahuna cheese steak. Delicious near, extra cheese, mushrooms, and jalape√±os. Muah! I was sad that I could only eat half of it, I wanted it ALL! I tried a bite of Adam's and it was also delicious. (He had the club with extra vinegar & oil)

In addition to the yummy food the employees were so nice and courteous. They even let us know about a deal they have that allows free chips and a drink when you show your movie ticket receipt.

They were talking about opening their own business and hiring one another lol that's great to have people you enjoy to work with you.

Ive had different staff three different times, and each and every time they were attentive and super friendly! I mean, it is a little pricey for a giant sub, but its so delicious.... its worth the treat! We always get the giant subs so we can eat at least 2 meals (usually 3) off it. The famous roast beef is always so delicious, tender and flavorful! No one makes a better one (says the boyfriend)! I have fallen in love with the California Club! I was so upset when they told me that its discontinued! I swear that everything I like, every restaurant discontinues!! They were so nice and offered to check if they had avocados in the back, if they did, they would make the Cali club for me! They had an avocado...I was overjoyed! The sandwiches were both seasoned perfectly Mikes Way! The super awesome staff even puts the Mikes Way ""juice"" only on half, then they give us a little cup to go of ""Mikes Juice"" for later. This is super helpful as the sandwich doesn't get soggy, its perfect to eat later! Hands down, this location has the most friendly staff! We will certainly continue to come back to this location!!",xcouy9WRvPg5y73NkAHbUg,1,0,5,-KF9eKLsQGynFak_UI2RBw

4042139,2016-03-19,9,pKxVsJvj3s9UF1LcnnBrOw,"Came here a few nights ago on my way home from work.

Had to be right around 8:30PM and the staff was clearly ready to get out of there, (They close at 9PM) and I can completely understand. I work 14 hour shifts so when its time to go i'm more than ready.

I walked up to the counter and the guy working told me it was going to be a couple of minutes because they had already prepared to close...

I understand you guys are probably exhausted from working part time making sandwiches but just because you were hoping to close early doesn't mean you need to give attitude to customers coming in close to closing time. 

When a store closes at 9PM that's when you start closing procedures not 45 minutes before. You also don't try and make customer's feel bad for forcing you to do your job.

There's a Which Which across the street i would suggest trying them, because the staff there is always friendly despite the time you arrive.",oG9VFtr_ye8v2tDnS3NOYw,10,7,2,JrKxOGh_69FMaU2V6Mulpw
