205385,2014-07-07,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,"Grabbed lunch here while attending a conference.  I expected the location to be a little closer to the convention center, so thankfully, it was not crowded.  The chopped salad was very tasty, but the service was slow (par for Vegas).  I probably wouldn't visit again, but that is based on location more than the quality of food.",6PbZxUM5XDvNwBwglrTbBg,0,0,3,TbLJTptIMcfaOUK75saMPw
619989,2011-07-03,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,"This restaurant is part of the Las Vegas Marriott Suites which is across from the convention center.  I was there for a conference needless to say.  I have to say for a hotel restaurant, this place is not bad.  I had food here a couple of times for dinner and breakfast.  The grilled sea bass was a bit over cooked.  However, their sliders were awesome.  Their apple walnut dessert was superb.

The bar area is a very lively place although small.  This was the first time I stayed at a non-gaming hotel in las Vegas and I must say, it's very refreshing!",Y5GpG2xu4dOpSMW7Hxs1YQ,3,0,3,-y_hueonFlTRaAWlhPKREg
1182634,2016-08-04,1,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,Although the Marriott Burger tasted good I feel they did not follow directions in the back. My waitress asked me if I wanted cheese and I declined  it. The food came out slightly over done and with cheese.  :/,kf32vjGglV-sAGYuMP0uLA,0,0,3,hOPc_HpE0UAGxat5FDPcNg
1930712,2012-10-20,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,"Had some business in the hotel so instead of leaving and eating else where i figured why not try the place out. 

They remodeled the beginning of this year so the interior looks pretty damn nice and very clean. 

I asked around and it seems everyone agreed on the Old School Burger. Ignore what the menu says about two thin patties the patties are thicker than normal sized patties you find at any fast food joint. If this is thin to them i'd love to see what a normal patty or a large patty would be. 

How's the burger you ask? If In-n-Out wasnt a fast food chain and had took their time to make a burger, the Old School would be the Double Double. It tastes damn close except for two things: i ordered it with no onion where as In-n-Out i would ask for grilled onions, and the sauces are different. In-n-Out i'm pretty sure uses thousand island, Cafe325 uses what they call ""Mighty Mo"" sauce which looked and sort of tasted the same but i'm pretty sure it's home made.

The fries were SUPER crispy and firm but not hard and still soft in the middle. Also they were salted with noticeable chunks of sea salt not regular table salt. 

Overall this was a pretty good lunch.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,7,2,4,Po7PYsATzB8BbOtztC-mTw
2122647,2018-03-24,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,"it is not a cheap place to eat at but not terribly expensive. The staff...I have never encountered such professional and eager to serve staff! All of them, from the bar tenders to the servers were amazing and with manners that made you feel you were at a $$$$ restaurant! 

We ate there one night because we thought it would be convenient and since our experience was outstanding we decided to eat there again the following night; the food is excellent for a hotel restaurant and the people working there were special.

Try the home made potato chips! I cannot even begin to describe how good they were; they are made to order and come out piping hot...delicious!

3450047,2014-03-28,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,Breakfast buffet is terrible. Only reason I didn't give it one star is the service was good and the coffee wasn't terrible. We walked each morning after our first to Envy in the Renaissance for breakfast. Would not stay at the hotel again either for this reason. The bar closes at 11pm so if you are out and about and come back late you can't even get night cap.,09uSmR_Ur0K956UZf33Q5g,0,0,2,mbXLYp0ky-6w2rH8nsGMPQ

We were hungry & didn't feel like going anywhere else since it was so hot out that day. So we thought we'd give Cafe 325 a try since its conveniently located downstairs. Best decision ever. The food here is fresh & excellent. The best part were the drinks!! We were impressed! I can't believe how such a small bar has  great bar talent & expertise. The bartenders here are friendly, amazing, & they make the best drinks hands down! Huge thanks to Nicole, Justine, & Imelda they definitely know what they're doing when it comes to alcohol. Will definitely be back for some drinks & food when I have friends & family in town. Great hidden gem!",-AXCpsIGp5Wq1e6wVX4YlA,1,0,5,6pW96HKbcjEu0t4QuViJFQ

They have a full bar right near the hostess stand. The cafe isnt very big but they manage to keep the people moving in and out. We ate breakfast for 2 days and lunch other day. We did a buffet breakfast. They have the typical eggs, bacon, sauage, fruit you know the usual food. It was good though. We also had lunch and there burgers are awesome. 

I was happy that our hotel had such good food. If you an elite member at the hotel you get a free breakfast.",tCiMbGe6Wx12vtITn7jWRg,9,8,4,SjyoS1Pq1y8ISDQE97uH2g

4714315,2011-11-04,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,"A nice alternative to eating at the convention center while attending a trade show across the street.

I have only eaten lunch here, but every time the food and service has been great. The prices are a little high for what you get, but compared to standing in line for 30 min to eat a hot dog, it's worth it. 

The place is quiet and has a few tvs in the bar to catch up on news or sports. It's a nice break from the convention center crowd. 

I usually have a sandwich or burger. Most recently I had the Bahn Mi Turkey Burger with picked vegetables and sriracha mayo. It was really good. There are also a few side options, such as fries, salad or chips. The servers are always friendly and attentive.",cD9vAXIG-UQnASjnBjsQLQ,5,0,4,1zo4Fpj4BxGf9F09NHAx3A

5134468,2017-02-13,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,"Just to be clear, this restaurant is located in the Marriott Hotel but the service and selection is on point to get your day started. I'm not coffee drinker, but everyone was ""getting' they coffee on"" with little to no wait via the Starbucks tied with the bar. 

They offer A-LaCart items and groupings or you can just hit up the buffet to get your choice of food. Platinum Marriott Rewards members eat for free or you pay the $22 p which is on par with other places for a full on buffet. One of the things I enjoyed is that the Pancakes, French toast and Omelets are cooked to order for you and included as part of the entire buffet. Those items don't sit around in the steamer getting hard. Nice selection of fruits, yogurts, condiments, breads, pastries and more. One thing I enjoyed the most... plenty of bacon!!!! They also had turkey & pork sausage along with potatoes and more. At first I thought I needed to hit up the strip but realized I just wanted a solid meal to get my day going and the convenience of staying at the hotel and the restaurant made it perfect. Full bar is available and fresh OJ... (add patron ) also was great and the entire staff checked on me while I sat back and watched ESPN Sports Center and the News on 2 neighboring TV's.

In addition to the breakfast I had 2 times, I also hit them up for a last minute room service for a burger. They tell you 45 mins initially, but they that's required response. I like how they made sure to prioritize and get it delivered in 15 mins. All the condiments I requested and more so I again enjoyed everything about the restaurant... especially Happy Hour which is nicely packed with good folks!",fwasfCCwbxLjxLNhYLuF3Q,1,0,4,e-5Ud68CCdRrcpSNG5YwtA
5403718,2015-09-03,0,6beJGNWviNq_VbODEULexA,"I am here on business and decided to try the cafe for dinner last night. I got the fresh grilled fish entree, which ended up being sea bass. I am not eating carbs so they gave me extra veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, and spinach...my favorite veggies!) instead of the mashed potatoes. Everything was seasoned exceptionally well. The fish was a large portion, tender and a bit crispy on the bottom which was wonderful. The asparagus was cooked through and more the tops of the asparagus (best part) and not all super chewy like I get some places. There was plenty of food for me and it was down right delicious. The wait staff was very attentive and sweet. I picked my own table and it was a 4 top, and they did not complain at all even though they were a bit busy. I absolutely loved the whole meal and experience. The restaurant was beautiful as well.  For dinner, at least, I would highly recommend. I have not tried their breakfast so I don't know about that.",xikFf70wmLbwT2OJuFY6eQ,0,0,5,WHuKz54dDIPhcjkEVjrGZA
