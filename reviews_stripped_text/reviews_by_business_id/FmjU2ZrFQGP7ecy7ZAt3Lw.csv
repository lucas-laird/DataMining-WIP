Second, did not Check receipt till I got home and noticed they charged me 9.5% sales tax when the sales tax in Nevada is 8.25%. 
Will not purchase anything from their google trucks again and everyone should stay away.",WSJJF_FyRz0osgBQgndlDg,0,0,1,rXQQUXuVitnCwSaoskySqw

Asked the employee if I could get another one made because of the poor display and she said ""Yes"" "" for the same price as a new sandwich ""
I will never come here when I visit Nevada again!",LNuC2EsYUjV1fKtkLu_lOA,3,0,1,_IYmeiATPYL7wD0XNi5iZQ

Super generic garbage served quickly on a cheap bun with a side of pre-frozen fries. No effort, no standards. Stop ripping people off!",cHI80uDWd-0GekQ_PdvQug,0,0,1,bf8AVUDbWc_nVyrZT2-pZQ
