164500,2014-07-05,0,Doqz6-NiXEPhr28koWESKw,So the service is horrible and  the food is lacking.  We waited for 45 minutes for food and the plates were so hot it seemed like it had all been sitting under heat lamps  for a really long time. My husband ordered pancakes and there was a syrup container made out of cast iron. It was so hot you couldn't pick it up and the syrup looked funny. We asked for another one and she picks it up and rushes to put it down at a nearby table (because it was freaking hot) and she leaves it there. She waits a few minutes and brings the same syrup back and tells us she got a new one! So a few minutes later we watch our server walking around with a large ice cream sundae. She walks around and talks to another server for 5 or 6 minutes as the ice cream melts. A couple then gets up and leaves. She watches them leave in a huff and then serves the ice cream to an empty table and left it there to melt   I ordered an omelet and it was alright. A friend ordered liver and onions but they forgot the onions.   We didn't get refills on drinks. The cashier at the end of the meal was also rude. Don't go to this restaurant. It is not worth your money or time.,sHICl9W9oiqUp77CU3If9w,0,0,1,f8aVCLGURABkTnoxk8swdA

Initially I was lured over by the dessert display case on the outside & decided to look at a menu before committing to going inside. They definitely had burgers & shakes on the menu.

I ordered the Angus sliders with a side of thousand island dressing & a chocolate/strawberry shake.

The shake came out 1st & I was a little disappointed that it was brought out in a not so big glass, oh & where was the mixing cup with the extras?! Overall it was an ok shake, tasted like chocolate covered strawberries. So, I'm assuming there were real strawberries in there.

The sliders were really good & cooked nicely. It also came with a side of tasty fries & a little thing of coleslaw as well. Not a big coleslaw fan, but it wasn't bad.

The waiter was pretty entertaining & we had about 3 different people ask if we were doing ok, so that was a huge plus. I would definitely consider coming back & trying some of the other menu offerings.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,1,0,3,AOIB8j-PRuh56ZyVc5hADA

1336868,2018-01-12,0,Doqz6-NiXEPhr28koWESKw,"On Thurs 01/04/18, while driving home from work, I got a craving for the spaghetti and meatballs at the Grand Café (Santa Fe Station). I have had this meal on numerous occasions and always enjoyed it. We are locals to Santa Fe Station and have been players and guests at their dining venues for many, many years. 
My husband and I arrived for dinner and were promptly seated. Of course, I ordered the spaghetti and my husband the hot turkey sandwich. We both added a salad to our meals. Here we go: 
Salads, while cold, were limp and the vegetables appeared ""stale"". Clearly not fresh. Husband left most of his. 
Food came out ... I was never aghast when looking at a meal but when I saw what they placed in front of me I was dumbfounded. The meatballs were completely black on the outside. There were two full meatballs and one that was a half - looked like it fell apart and they left it on the plate. The meatballs looked like they were sitting in a pan all day, or even longer, and just blackened away. Needless to say, I let the server know and over came the manager. He looked at the plate and agreed. Asked what I wanted and I told him spaghetti and meatballs that were not black. BTW ... husband's sandwich was OK ... just a bunch of white bread with some turkey and gravy on it. Not the most appealing. 
I waited and waited. By now, my husband had finished his meal. Out comes the manager with another order of the spaghetti and guess what ... black meatballs yet again. He proceeded to tell me that the chef baked them up fresh ... are you kidding me? You can bake meatballs in under 10 minutes? They were just as black as the first order. I can only assume that they scraped as much of the black off that they could and then put it all in the microwave to heat it up. The toasted bread that came with the meal was completely limp and wet ... microwaves will do that to bread. I couldn't believe they would let that meal out of the kitchen and place it in front of a guest. I told the manager that this was totally unacceptable and that I was done. He offered me another meal ... if I wanted a sandwich or burger I would have ordered that. Then he offered a pastry ... now there's a great dinner! We got up and left. I without any dinner and wasting over an hour of my time. 
The following day I wrote Santa Fe Station via their website and provided feedback on this experience. It has now been over a week later and I have not received any response or acknowledgement. I must say, this is not the first time of having a bad dining experience at the Grand Café, and when providing feedback, no one ever responds.",5AUFGTX05o-uSGHzVn3dgg,0,0,1,P1gSCzcPQiTspa9xiWsyVQ

I used to eat here pretty frequently about 5 years ago and the food was always really delicious, that I remember anyway. 

Seems their menu has shrunk considerably and so has the quality of food. I got the chicken fried steak which was good but totally overloaded with breading, and it was almost as if they fried it to long or it started to get to that point because the edges of the meat and the breading were fried hard. Eww.  My Cesar salad looked really sad with wilted lettuce. My hash browns were over fried and my eggs were wet slimy like. Bleh! My cousin had the fried chicken which she said was good but her steamed veggies were still hard, complete with dried out carrots and a cold baked potato. 

The only reason I would come back here is prob if I was severely intoxicated and it was the last place on earth to eat something to help soak up the cohol.

Reuben sandwich - Holy moly this sandwich was greasy!  It literally dripped grease the entire time. Grease aside, I wish they sliced the pastrami thinner as there were definitely pieces that needed to be cut with a knife and not with bare teeth. Still, it was tasty.

Overall, the Grand Cafe is a nice clean place if you happen to find yourself as the Palace Station hotel and you're looking for a quick place for dinner.",akmzZ87dhGitfq_c600cQw,0,0,3,NGR1kjX2UDmeIjXUu6AJoA

We were heading out of town for the afternoon and decided to stop off at Santa Fe Station for brunch. Our intention was to hit the buffet but the line was too long. The Grand Cafe was right there and didn't look too busy so we decided to just eat there. Now it is Saturday so the place wasn't empty but it wasn't terribly crowded as far as Saturdays go. We walked right up to the hostess, told her there were five of us. She said to wait while she found a table. I could see plenty of empty tables but whatever. While we were waiting, the manager came out and asked, ""How many?"" I responded, ""Someone is already helping us. She went to find a table."" The manager then very rudely snapped at me, ""How many?"" I told him five and then he turned away from me and started talking to another hostess. Meanwhile our hostess came back and led us to a table. 

Our server showed up right away to take our drink orders and then she disappeared. It took a very, very long time to get our drinks. While I'm on the drinks...the kids' menu showcased two drinks. They were very large photographs. There were no other drinks mentioned anywhere on the kids menu. When we placed our drink order my two youngest each ordered one of those drinks. We were told they are not part of the kids meal and we'd be charged extra. The drinks also showed up in regular glasses instead of the kids cups with lids. I found this very weird and misleading. Why showcase both drinks on the kids menu if they are not kids drinks?? My orange juice tasted really sour as if it were old. 

We placed our order and waited, and waited and waited. A server for a nearby table saw my look of death and came over to assure me our order was being put on a tray right then. She'd just seen it was up and ready. Yeah, right. We continued to wait and wait and wait. Finally, our server showed up and apologized saying that the corporate chef was there. I have no idea what that means or why that means service is so slow. I was just happy to have our food. We had plans out of town and our tickets required us to be there at a specific time. We were now running late. 

Ok, so the food...bleh!! It was sooo bad! My oldest son ordered the french toast. It was so soggy it was dough. My youngest ordered pancakes that were not cooked through. My husband had the same issue. My hashbrowns were the most disgusting I'd ever had...ever. They were bland mush. I specifically ordered an omelet without mushrooms. It had mushrooms. I had ordered a side of fruit. It came with tastless melon and one strawberry that had been quartered to give the illusion that i got more than one. Nice try. My husband ordered a side of bacon and it never came. We spent maybe five minutes with our food before giving up and deciding just to leave.

The Grand Cafe just isn't what it should be. None of them are consistent at any of the Stations which always baffles my mind.

4014416,2015-12-17,2,Doqz6-NiXEPhr28koWESKw,"Nothing really 'Grand' about the café in Santa Fe Station.

This review is mainly for my sandwich.  Those in the know, know I like my club sandwiches.  Bacon, no bacon, ham, no ham, turkey, extra turkey, white bread, wheat bread, rye bread, even 7 grain bread -  I pretty much like them all and base a lot of my dining in American restaurants off of this particular sandwich.  If I don't know what to order off of a classic menu, I always gravitate towards a club sandwich.  Only rule I have is...the damn thing better be a TRIPLE layer!  That means 3 slices of bread!  I dare not call it a proper club sandwich without that extra layer of bread.

Being a late night for some reason (were we shopping?) and too lazy to cook, all the places we thought about eating on a weeknight had closed after 9 PM or were too far from home.  Not in the mood for fast food we somehow ended up at the Grand Café.  

Luckily it wasn't the swing shift yet so we actually received prompt service, we got seated after a 2 minute wait.  Our server met with us right away asking us for drinks and handing us menus.  At this point it was near 10 PM so I barely grazed over its contents. Guess where I ended up at?

*Turkey Club ($8.99) - Triple stack sandwich with thinly sliced turkey, bacon, cheese (I went with cheddar), lettuce, tomato & mayo on your choice of bread (think I went sourdough this time around)

Sandwich only comes with fries!  If you wanted a house salad, Caesar salad, or bowl of soup you had to add an additional $2.99.  What a rip!  Yay fries!  Take that you carb lovers, you.

Didn't take too long for our order to come out from the kitchen, 20 minutes or so.  Figured it might have been quicker since the café was near ghost town empty.  I had to say, it looked pretty impressive on that big plate.

Turkey Club was fairly large, a nice triple layer sandwich with all the fixings.  A good serving of sliced turkey (cold cuts), actually crisp, thick bacon, nice slices of cheddar, fresh lettuce & tomato.  I actually couldn't wait to bite in!  And when I did, ugh!  They forgot to add the mayo!  Dry as a brillo pad!  After asking for a side of mayo and slathering it on each quarter, my club began to resemble more of a sandwich.  Overall it wasn't half bad!  Bread was toasted just right, provided great texture with the fresh veggies.  Bacon added some much needed fat (which equals taste).  It was a good sandwich.  Not the best club sandwich I've had, but surprising for where we actually were.  Fries were good too, cooked well-done just the way I like them.

Best part about the deal was the price, $8.99 is a decent value for a restaurant club sandwich.  I only managed to eat 3/4 of it so I had another quarter to box up and take home.  Midnight snacking!

I know most of these Grand Café places in Station Casinos don't get a good rep, and for probably good reason.  This one isn't so bad so I'll go with an average 3 stars.  I might actually come back here for another Turkey Club sandwich!  Maybe.  If I don't win at bingo.  Or at slots.  Or at blackjack.

It amuses me when reviewers hold these type of casual coffee shop restaurants to a gourmet standard.

i arrived at the Santa Fe Station Casino and Hotel at about 12:15 on 1/12 eager to begin my video poker adventures after a six hour flight.Famished after consuming Jet Blue dreck and playing for an hour, I chose this Grand Cafe for lunch.Menus were not presented promptly and the kitchen was inexplicably slow, turning a lunch that should have taken 40 minutes into an hour event......but who cares, I'm chilling on vacation.

My bacon cheddar burger arrived medium,as ordered.The meat was decent but I could have done without the limp lettuce and tomato which gave the burger a jarring ""Burger Kingy"" vibe.Stick those on the side, please! The accompanying shoestring fries were decent. They were tasty and not oily. The miniscule portion of cole slaw was, to be kind, not memorable.My female server was pleasant and attentive, offering me extra napkins just prior to me noticing that I needed them.

Look,,,,,,if you are in this casino and want a functional, serviceable and cheap lunch ($9.49 bacon cheddar burger and fries!), you need look no further than this Grand Cafe.

Or so I thought. I returned to Santa Fe Station the next day(1/13) because I love playing in their casino. I had lunch there, ordering a plain Caesar Salad ($7.99) in anticipation of a heavier dinner.I was very underwhelmed. It took a half hour for the salad to be brought to my table. When it came it was extremely dry. It consisted of a large plate of lettuce, a few croutons and no anchovies. It was like someone put a half-teaspoon of Cardini bottled dressing upon the lettuce. When my very nice female server asked how everything was I told her the coffee was good but that they had a problem with the kitchen, both with the slowness and the incompetent salad. She asked if I wanted to see the manager but I declined.I deducted a star because of this experience.

I saw signs advertising a $9.99 t-bone steak special and thought it looked good! We were sat right away and even though we had a stroller(son was sleeping) they accommodated us perfectly. I order OJ which was tropicana, not the nasty machine stuff you find in the casinos, hubby had raspberry iced tea, and daughter had apple juice. Which surprisingly for a casino they brought her juice in a cup with a lid! I ordered the t-bone special which comes with a baked potato, hubby had the sourdough turkey sandwich, and daughter had red velvet pancakes. 
T-bone- no flavor!!! It wasn't tender at all either. But for it being $9.99 it was edible. The baked potato was large!!!
Sourdough turkey-This was the winner hubby did good! He also added a caesar salad for only $1.99 and it was fresh and flavorful, not over dressed. 
Red velvet pancakes- I DID NOT like these however hubby and daughter did! 

We all left pretty full and our waiter Reul(sp?) was very attentive and funny so service definitely gave this place an extra star! It was a little odd a few employees talking rather loudly about how one didn't want to take tables although Reul already had 5 in the middle of the dining room...But that only made us think poor Reul this girl is trying to make him work harder! But honey if you're in the service industry the only way to make money is to take those tables!!!!",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,0,0,3,Q5dDfHU6ioWj8tGIz8J9RA

   For whatever reason, on Saturday night Santa Fe Station closes the Feast Buffet at 9 P.M. It was 8:50 P.M., on a Saturday night, and I wanted to reward myself with a nice dinner. With the Feast Buffet closing, I stepped into another Station Casinos icon: The Grand Cafe. Unfortunately nothing about it is Grand.

  The Grand Cafe of today trails behind the Grand Cafe of a few years past in value. With the exception of their daily special, the prices are inflated. Gone are the entrees that include a cup of soup. My dinner: fettuccine, bread, cream of mushroom soup, cola, and tip came to $17. For that price, I would prefer Olive Garden or Red Lobster. 

  There were a couple issues that caused me to lower the review by half a star. Far too much of the fettuccine was taken up by bread. Attention to beverage refills was slow.

  My impression of the Grand Cafe is it is a convenient 24 hour restaurant to grab a bite in Santa Fe Station. And, if I am not mistaken, Grand Cafe is the go-to place for desserts in Santa Fe Station.

 These are my recommendations for the Grand Cafe management to improve their restaurant. Offer more items, lower the pricing, include soup with all entrees, and provide better refill service on beverages.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,2,1,2,EAAiXowmgcaRWLXh6bPhpA

We ordered a turkey club, an open faced hot turkey sandwich, 2 shrimp cocktails, endless mimosas and a double Jim Beam with a club soda back.

I think our server was new. As we waited about 10 minutes for our drinks I saw our server lose my mimosa from his tray. He wiped up the spill himself and brought a new mimosa with my husband's drink. My husband takes one sip of the club soda and finds that it's actually 7-Up. We wait a little longer and our sandwiches come out. The hubs says the turkey club is bland and boring, my open face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes is fantastic. I ate all of it.

Finally we attempt to flag down our server as I've only had 1 mimosa under the unlimited mimosa plan. A manager gets our drink order and our server shows up 10 minutes later saying he totally forgot about our shrimp cocktail. At this point I'm full and really don't want it anymore so we cancel the 2 cocktails. 

The open face turkey sandwich was the highlight of the meal whereas the forgetful, clumsy service was the low. Hopefully we get a better server next time.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,0,0,3,8x8NZZbWiez4IV0S3fzOKg

Intrigued by not only the concept of 'locals' casinos, but more so by the early morning activity at such places, and twice impressed by the quality of the pancakes and pastries at Station Casinos Grand Café it was amidst Las Vegans and visitors that breakfast was enjoyed within the confines of Santa Fe Station and similar to its Strip adjacent brother and Red Rock location in Summerlin the breakfast fare was once again far superior to several more pricey competitors while the baked also proved by-and-large impressive shortly after emerging from the oven just after 6:30am.

Lengthy but narrow, with a sort of 'patio' overlooking the gaming floor adjacent to the well stocked pastry case, it was on the right side of the restaurant with a view of the television showing Sportscenter that I asked to be sat and greeted by a friendly Hispanic man just about to go off-shift water was quickly filled and a pair of pastries delivered, my order of entrees transferred to a middle-aged Caucasian fellow who seemed to take a minute to get his bearings at the beginning of his day.

Beginning with a simple donut, the $1.25 ring resembling those at Dunkin but not quite as soft in crumb, it seemed to me that while the baked goods were indeed fresh that this fried one might have been a bit old and moving on to the Blueberry Muffin a far better bite was found, the base quite buttery even before adding a little bit more while the top was speckled with pearls of sugar giving the whole thing a light crackle as several fresh berries burst in each bite.

Eventually flagging down my original server for a water refill, even though I'm rather sure he was off the clock, it was not long before entrees arrived from the fellow who seemed to have finally woken up and setting aside ""faple,"" as in fake maple, syrup in favor of the good stuff the pancakes again proved light and fluffy with light topping of whipped cream and fresh strawberries while the waffle, too, was quite admirable with a good crunch and soft center, the crisply fried breast of chicken perhaps a little more greasy than some would prefer, but at the same time a whole lot better in its hand-battered herbal flavor than the previously-frozen fingers served at 24/7 spots elsewhere.

Sated and happy, but also intrigued by a few novelties within the case of cupcakes and croissants, it was with two items boxed and bagged that I settled the tab and taking my leave to less smoky environs than the casino itself it was with coffee in hand that I partook in two chocolate concoctions that again proved quite pleasant, the rich double chocolate chip cookie with slivers of almonds rich and almost 'brownie-like' while the actual brownie was more like a slab of sheet cake with slick chocolate ganache and patriotic sprinkles that may not exactly justified the $4.50 tab, but would have been absolutely excellent warmed up beneath some ice cream as offered amongst the menu's desserts.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,8,4,pZQ48Vc1cr_wXkOedGQIZw

Our server and boy I hope his name was Jonathan, was EXCELLENT.  Answered all questions about the prep of the meat and said if we were not happy, he would gladly get us something else.  The sandwich isn't as good as 7 yrs ago but was not awful like our last experience.

5516836,2012-12-30,0,Doqz6-NiXEPhr28koWESKw,"Let me preface this by saying that I have eaten at SEVERAL of the Grand Cafes in the Stations Chains (the worst by far to this point has been the one at Red Rock) over the years. I used to eat in them back when they existed the first time, then when they became Denny's and Coco's, and again when they were brought back again as Grand Cafes. I have to say that with the exception of Kim, Wayne, Charles and Joey on the Graveyard Shift (and they are the reason I raised the overall to 2 stars instead of 1 or 0 stars), I have pretty much had nothing but horrible experiences at the one at the Santa Fe Station.

The most recent issues have occured over the last 2 days (12-29 and 12-30-12). For starters, they have decided that you can only have one slice of toast (cut in half to ""2"" pieces of toast) on your breakfast meals. Then, NONE of their cooks apparently have learned how to cook an egg over-easy. Next, when you ask for a side of toast (again only one slice cut into halves), it is $2.99 for that one slice of bread. Then, on their menu it says you can substitute soup or salad, however when you try to order the soup over night, they tell you that they no longer serve soup at night.

I am sure that Stations people won't see this, but I do have to say that if you go to these cafes, you have a better time than I have the last few times. I hate to say it, but I think I am going to have to start going back to Denny's for my early morning breakfasts.",zI9jW4l0kjtwN4k1LHHmxw,1,0,2,UeIoR0DDSbuXoXmJeer5AQ

Once again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. 

Like usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. 

I'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: ""The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant"". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the ""FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT""

If it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe.
