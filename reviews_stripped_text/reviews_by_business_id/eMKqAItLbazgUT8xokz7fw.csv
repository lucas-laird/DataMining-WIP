23963,2011-07-01,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"I'm looking at all the previoius four and five star reviews and wondering if we went to the same place...

Having read their website's bio of the chef and their commitment to fresh ingredients, I thought it was well worth a try as my wife and I like to try to support new, worthwhile eateries in our part of town.  

there was a sax player playing over some canned background music or a synthesizer or something...it was just o.k. musically, but waaay too loud.

I was interested to try the ""fried vegetable logs"".  The waitress brought a pile of fried mixed vegetables...swimming in a pool of greenish liquid, and topped with melted cheese.  I asked about the liqud and she told me it was from the green chili sauce (which I was never able to detect except for the runny pool of liquid at the bottom of the plate.  consequently, the fried vegetables were a soggy mess.

After that came the salad...well, not exactly.  Just a few minutes after getting our soggy appetizer the waitress kind of aplogized and told us our main courses were on the way out, and that if we wanted, she could put the fried vegetables on the table behind us, since our two top was too small to hold the tree oversized plates.  As far as I was concerned she could take it anywhere...just take it.  Sure enough, out came the main courses, but no salad.  That came about five minutes later, and again due to a lack of room the waitress offered to put it on the table behind us.  I was starting to get frustrated so I told her that I'd just pass on the salad.  As she was taking it back to the kitchen, the manager saw her return it, but didn't say a word to us about it.

The entrees themselves were underwhelming at best.  My pork chops were dry adn swimming in a brown sauce that had too much salt (and too much demi glace).  And there were enough chunks of bland potatoes for three servings...this from a guy who loves potatoes.  My wife's club sandwich was unremarkable at best.

As we were finishing the manager/maitre d' came over to ask how our dinner had been.  Too little too late.  I toldhim it was fine, just because I wanted to be done with the whole experience.  And now I am.",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,4,0,2,lybQVjHoAl6mn2zt3Ggz2A

Pulling into the parking lot, I didn't expect much. Nothing too spectacular visually from outside.

I ordered the salmon upon the suggestion of our server and my wife had the blackened chicken breast. As our dishes first became visible in the window yo be delivered to our table, we knew we were in for a pleasant surprise.

Every aspect of the food was incredible. Presentation? Amazing. Freshness? Amazing. Preparation? Amazing. Flavors? Amazing. Price? Incredible.

We got ""The Salad,"" which really is THE salad. It was huge, it was delicious, and I would happily order that as a meal. We also got the chicken curry and the Lake Victoria. The server warned us (several times) that this was a lot of food, and indeed it was. We stuffed ourselves silly and still had plenty for at least one more meal. The food was equally delicious as leftovers.

124300,2012-10-29,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"In my quest for obscure, off-the-strip locations, along comes a recommendation from a former colleague to try out a no-name place by the name of Wine 5 Caf√©. He described it as a Kenyan/American fusion restaurant, and claimed an amazing burger and 'transcendent' chili fries. It's a bit far from where I make my rounds these days, but a recent commitment brought me towards the north-west part of town and I finally made my visit. Was it as good as he claimed?

Wine 5 is located in a crummy strip mall in not the best looking parking lot, but don't let the exterior fool you as it almost did us: the restaurant is clean and quaintly decorated. There are a number of 4 top tables in the middle, and a few booths to the side that are decorated like they're on someone's front porch. The rest of the walls around the restaurant look like the front facades of small houses as well, almost like a mini version of some themed casino you'd find on the strip, but more tolerable. The menu has some great sounding items, it looks a bit heavy on the breakfast items but there seems to be lots of good choices. I'll have to come back to try some of the Kenyan-influenced dishes, as I was there on this day to try one of their 'flat burgers'.

And flat this wasn't; my Jetpack burger came out and this thing was absolutely huge. Topped with avocado, grilled sweet onions, spicy butter pickles, lettuce and tomato, this thing was stacked to the top of my knife it was presented with. The bun was crispy and flakey on the outside, yet soft and gooey on the inside. The meat had good flavor, although maybe not the best quality ever; it wasn't the best beef flavor, but more like your standard pre-made patty. The onions had amazing sweet flavor and were the star of the burger. The pickles were more like flavored cucumbers but totally delicious and something I need to emulate at home. The avocado disappeared in the burger but was a good touch when I came across it in a few bites. The tomato was slightly grilled but still hard and fresh; it seemed almost uncooked despite the grill marks, but was quite good. This burger was not at all what I had been anticipating based on the location or menu description, but ended up being a fantastic surprise.

The fries came out very late as I believe they were forgotten at first, but were extremely good as well. They were thicker like steak fries, coated with a combo of celery salt and other seasonings. Like most steak fries a majority were crunchy and cooked well as I like, with a few soggy ones mixed in. A side of fries is definitely enough for two, as they are served in a very large bowl.

My girlfriend had the Exception, which is a red wine and spiced braised burger, with cheddar cheese, grilled tomato slices, onions and lettuce. It had very similar flavoring to mine; the additional treatment to the patty made for some nice complexity to the flavor, but I felt it was missing my excellent pickles. Even though it is a bit out of the way from us, I can't wait to go back and try a few more of their selections, and I'm very curious to see what they do with their smoked bacon. Their burgers range from $7.95-8.95, with the fries at $2.95 for a heaping serving, all very worth it. We didn't get to try the chili fries during this visit either, but you can be I'll be back soon to try those as well.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,5,M997B2kxWDRS3JybbOv2mg

The drunken frito misto (hope I spelled it right) platter was an amazing appetizer. its says it serves 2 but could easily serve 3. but just like everything else here the portions are HUGE.  I got the salmon ruben for my entree and it was great. I thought that salmon on a rueben would have been odd but it wasnt at all. the sandwich had a tasty remoulade with cooked cabbage and wasn't that usual sour kraut from a can that alot of restaurants put on there ruebens. The salmon was cooked perfect and juicy, the rye bread was buttery and crispy delicious. Overall decore was cute and thoughtful ( even the place is relatively small the place feels big and open with giant glass windows to see right into the kitchen), service was professional ( all servers wear ties and white dress shirts italian bistro style) and friendly and I never felt abandoned,  food portions are gigantic and everything seems to be made from scratch very fresh tasting.

244893,2012-08-26,1,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"We have been to this place twice.  The first time was just shortly after they opened and they had a very limited and casual menu.  This Kenyan fusion thing was very strange.  We ordered a combination plate that had several different items on it, because we thought it would be fun to try things we hadn't eaten before.  After sampling each one, we decided we wouldn't be trying those things again, and probably wouldn't be coming back to this restaurant again.  We were there for dinner during the week and were the only ones in the place, which is scary to begin with.  

I went again tonite with friends who had been there before, and said they enjoyed it.  So, I'm game, I'll try any place twice.  But after this experience, I will never go back again.

I know some people will gag when I say this, but I love liver and onions, and when I see it on the menu, I will order it.  The menu had quite expanded, and was much more upscale than the first time we visited, as were the prices.  Liver and onions was $19.95.  My friends had the pork chop the last time they were in, and they ordered it again.  Our waitress, who was the only waitsperson in the place while we were there, was incredibly incompetent.  I won't go into our complaints with her.  She was bad enough, tho, that I left no tip.  I have never done that in my life.  But I digress.

The plates of food were huge.  My friends said their pork chops were good, but neither ate the veggies (carrots, asparagus, green beans) because they said they were too raw (I wished I could have eaten them off their plates!)  When I ordered the liver, I told the waitress that I wanted it medium, to tell the cook to please not overcook it.  When it arrived, it was buried in a huge pile of deep fried onion pieces, with a few pieces of asparagus on the side, and plain mashed potatoes.  A small dish of what appeared to be gravy with chopped carrots in it was on the plate.  I tasted the gravy and it was overwhelmed with vinegar.  When I finally got the waitress's attention, I asked for some other kind of gravy that wasn't so sour.  She brought out a bowl of what looked exactly like what I had, sans carrots, and in tasting it, it was exactly the same.  I pushed it out of the way, and someone from the kitchen came out and after talking to him, he brought out another bowl of ""gravy"" which was better, but still vinegary. 

After digging through the deep fried onions, I got down to a thick piece of liver, cooked to death and all but inedible.  I ate the asparagus which was perfect, and a couple of bites of plain potato, and left the rest.  When the waitress finally came back to our table, she asked if I was still working on it, and I said I couldn't eat any of it, because it was awful.  She took it away.  My friends finished their dinners, and we waited at least 15-20mins for our check, finally calling out to the waitress and asking her for the bill.  She brought me my bill for $28+ ( I had a beer), and when she came to collect, I said she should be ashamed for charging me for that meal, especially since it was obvious nothing had been eaten.  She said ""Why should I be ashamed"", and took my credit card and rang it up.   My friends asked for coffee after our meal, and the waitress said she would have to make a new pot and it would take about 4-5 mins.  After waiting almost 15 mins, we left .   I should have called the manager or owner and complained to him, but I didn't.  I just decided it was lesson learned, and I would never go back.",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,3,0,1,xbgwILkLzMYlaunV8SXR3w

Believe the other reviewers; the samosa appetizer is PHENOMENAL! I could have made a meal of them.  We were a party of 4, so asked to dine family style-waiter agreed that was a good idea. Our 4 entrees could have fed 8! Best was the Traditional Nayama and Ugali. A wonderfully seasoned 'chicken stew' traditional in Kenya. Excellent balance of spice and sweet with a wonderful mix of flavors. Two dishes came with spinach - one of our group called the spinach 'green crack.' I found it too salty however, and I love spinach. Taste of Nairobi is also a must order; no leftovers for that dish. Other 2 dishes were surprisingly unique in flavor - pork chop and (spicy) grilled shrimp. Everything had an excellent and unique sweet/spicy flavor a la Kenyan spices. Available wines paired well with the dishes. 
Nothing seemed overpriced. The owner/chef even visited our table, perhaps because we were there until 10:30 (they closed at 9). We will be going back to this hidden gem!

289113,2015-08-02,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"As usual I'm trying to be objective and rate an establishment on three aspects: food, service and interior space.

Food:
Ordered Philly sandwich and W5 assorted grill. We ended up waiting about 40 minutes for food. I wish I was told that some items may take a long time then I might have ordered appetizer or something different to avoid such a long wait.
Mixed grill plate ended up being rather below average quality - salmon was raw inside and tasted unseasoned, pork was OK, chicken wing is... a chicken wing and steak even though was cooked as requested (MR) had a lot of gristle in it to the point of frustration. Philly sandwich interpretation wasn't bad. Steak fries had a lot of breading on it (of which we were told).

Service: prompt and attentive so no complaints here.

Interior: cozy and I could see the owners effort.

749294,2011-07-04,1,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"I think Wine 5 Cafe is a good addition to the restaurant scene in ""Old Summerlin"", as the area has come to be called.

Four of us went together around 2pm and two of our group were able to still order breakfast, despite the menu saying we couldn't - always a plus.  On the Breakfast side, two omelettes were order and enjoyed - the Very Cheesy and Fluffy was exactly what it said and the other omelette, ordered scrambled, was full of good stuff.  What I noticed about each was that the chef really knew his business about eggs.  Neither dish was over- nor under-cooked, neither was dry and neither had a plate of egg water under it.  This is surprisingly uncommon and implies both dishes were cooked in a pan, not a griddle - increasingly uncommon.  Each was also served with a healthy portion of hash browns, which were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - salt was needed, however.

On the lunch side, my brother and I each ordered a burger, he, the ""Hickory Smoked"", and I, ""The Exception"".  I found the Exception to be basically well-formed with a great bun and their signature red onion marmalade, however the meat was a bit over-cooked and not flavorful despite being cooked in ""spices and red wine braised"".  Also, the shredded iceberg doesn't work for me.  I wouldn't necessarily describe this burger as exceptional.  My brother's Hickory smoked was perfectly-cooked and very flavorful with bacon and pepper jack cheese.  If I ordered his burger, I would be inclined to give this place its fourth star.

On the appetizer side, we tried the ""Nairobi City Park Ahi Tuna Tacos"".  We'd never heard of African tacos before and given the great variety of things that can be found in the Street Taco concept, we were game.  After questioning the name, the waitress informed us that both the cooks are Kenyan and most of their food has elements of African seasoning.  Let me say, I wish this came through more in my burger because these were some of the best fish tacos I've ever eaten.  The chucks of Ahi were well-seasoned and mixed with great in-season tomatoes that were perfection!  We were supplied with extra tortillas free of charge - another plus.

I found our waitress to be pleasant and helpful and concerned with actually connecting with each guest and her recommendations were for the most part right-on.  

A few other notes - the wine list was quite good.  Though I didn't have wine, I knew about 3/4 of the list. And, of those that I didn't know, they seemed like good selections.

What would make this place 4 star?
The burger.  Although my brother's was good, I have to give my rating based on my food mainly, and the burger needed help.  I think this is probably a consistency thing however, not a major problem.  Once in a while food is not perfect.

What would make this place 5 stare?

I'd have a hard time making this a 5 star joint, which has nothing to do with its food, but its marketing.  I think a 5 star joint has to be at the top of its particular field.  Wine 5 actually sits between two types, upscale and diner/breakfast place.  Since it is not at the top of former, I can't give it the full 5.  But that's just how I play the ratings game...

Bottom line:  Great menu with fresh variety and something for everyone.  I'll definitely go back to see if I can give it that fourth star...",Og5Uu8lxOTnTT6dQmxFmzg,5,2,3,IrWZ4poefATa3e_Wy6mvnw

My husband and I dined at Wine 5 Cafe after finding it using a Yelp search. I have to admit that  I was dubious as we pulled up, given that the restaurant is located in a strip mall and the restaurant was quite empty. But I'm glad we stayed as this place is a true treasure (and one that we will visit again --very soon).  The inside decor is quite cute and has the feel of a French bistro. The waiter was very attentive but not intrusive.  
I had the curry (Taste of Nairobi), which came with a very generous portion of chapati bread and a side of  spinach stew (sauteed spinach with onions).  The curry was light (very little coconut milk, if any) and contained three huge pieces of chicken, potatoes, fresh green beans, carrots, and squash.  The portion size was generous and I took more than half of the curry home.  
My husband had the Traditional Nayama and Ugali (Tender Braised Beef, White Polenta, Spinach Stew, Onion Jam, and Sweet Potato Logs).  The beef was tender and well seasoned, cooked to perfection.  The spinach stew was great, seasoned with big chunks of onion).  The sweet potato logs were fresh, well seasoned, and crisp, without being greasy or heavy.  The onion jam (which I had never before tasted) was amazing.  The polenta was bland.  But the waiter quickly informed us that you're supposed to mix everything together.  Again, I was dubious, but it worked and the end result was amazing.  
Also, my husband likes a lot of spice.  While the restaurant does not have hot sauce, the chef prepared homemade hot sauce for my husband, which he added to his food. 
The only recommendation I have is that if you want some of the traditional Kenya dishes, such as goat or oxtail, you should dine early.  My husband initially asked for goat, but he was told they were out.

1350097,2013-08-08,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"This little, unassuming hole-in-the-wall joint is delicious, comfy, and affordable. The menu offers mostly American food, with some Kenyan inspiration. I was hoping for straight up Kenyan fare when I came. And while there are only a few Kenyan dishes, none of the food letdown. The club sandwich (as much of a ""club sandwich"" as this place is a ""wine cafe"") has been ordered by someone in our group on both of my visits and has been the standout each time. Usually, a club sandwich being the choice order in a restaurant would be a signal of a lesser restaurant, but this is not the case here. The club is a phenom - the Yasiel Puig of sandwiches. The Kenyan dishes are tasty as well, as well as an interesting change of pace.

Now back to that name. Sure Wine 5 Cafe has wine, but it is a little misleading. It would be like calling McDonalds: Soda Pop 11 Eatery. This is a laid-back, no-frills restaurant. The decor looks handmade, and that is part of its charm.

As a 'thermometer on the quality of food, we tried the ""Chili Log Fries"", aka Chili Fries.  I'm not even a chili lover... but I loved these!  Way better than a comparable establishment's 'Oxtail Chili Fries' (which were featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives).  I would HIGHLY recommend this cafe.

Went here on Saturday night about 8:30, there was no one else there, so no waiting! Party of 5, two had burgers, one steak sandwich, one Cojita salad, and one appetizer that was 2 triangles filled with beef and vegetables, fried.  I have to say each of our dishes were excellent! I can't remember all the names because of the Kenyan titles, but nobody was disappointed whatsoever. The menu choices are a blend of Kenyan dishes, but also includes their twist on Traditional American faire like burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc. there are a couple vegetarian choices.

The waiter was super attentive and very friendly. The ambience was very cute, and traditionally decorated with Kenyan/African style knick knacks. The only criticism I might add was that it was quite dark, but it sure felt cozy. 

I strongly recommend this small, local restaurant. The food we tried competes with any of the chic places downtown or on the strip, is a great price, and a true hidden gem!",1MR6ehSniewcxWnVUjscIQ,3,1,5,fUym8bLQDMFHaERYsvWmcg

2002572,2012-03-05,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"Okay, this was miles better than any of my experiences I've had here.

To give a little background of ""Jez, why did you go back to a place you don't care for?""

One of the staff contacted me, apologizing profusely, and asked if I would re-evaluate the restaurant on a different day.  Due to the fact that I received a lengthy E-mail that was professional, polite, and written from the heart, I really couldn't say no.  So I dropped in one evening and informed them that I would be joining them for breakfast the next day.  

Breakfast was a pleasure.  I had the award winning French Toast, a decadent meal of french toast stuffed with sliced bananas, nutella, covered with ice cream, strawberries, powdered sugar, and chocolate sauce.  Totally bomb.  Never having for breakfast again, as would have made a much better dessert, but wow, just delicious.  I ordered the Chai which was different from the traditional chai that I enjoy at Indian Restaurants - it's smoother and less spiced, which offset the sweetness of the entree.

My lovely partner had an omelet with perfectly seasoned potatoes and caramelized onions that were plentiful and well prepared.  

As far as I'm concerned - this restaurant, as far as breakfast goes, should be a regular staple in the breakfast wars scene of Cracked Egg and Babystacks and all of those because they offer a mean breakfast at a great price and- out of all the servers I had, the girls who I met the previous night and the one who served me breakfast were sweet, smiling, and on the ball.  

It was a pleasure to meet the owners - they stressed their attention to detail in that they read reviews and take them to heart - pointing out changes they've made based on the opinions here and how they broke apart from the casinos to strike out on their dream.

And for my main dish, I got a sandwich, which was also a very large portion but nothing outstanding about it. And the bf got a burger. Good food, but seemed pretty American style, didn't see the Kenyan influence to it. Didn't enjoy any wine though, and I guess that is why I don't see the rave about this place.

2336633,2012-11-28,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"The last thing I expected to be doing this morning was writing a yelp review....but....I was so moved by my dining experience last night that...here I am.  I actually do  consider myself a middle-aged foodie because I love to eat and since I've been doing it for so long I am very qualified in this area.  I've traveled the world and have eaten in some of the finest restaurants in Italy, Greece, Spain, Las Vegas and California's wine country.  Ok, enough about me.  My husband had heard a commercial on the radio for Wine 5 Cafe and came home, brought up the menu online and looked at me and said ""it's not far from here, let's try it"".   So, on an ordinary Tuesday evening we set out from our Northwest Vegas home and drove about 10 minutes to this quaint and friendly store-front.  I knew the strip mall and personally wasn't expecting much.  But ""date-night"" on a Tuesday sounded spontaneous. The restaurant looked empty from outside and, again, I immediately thought this isn't good.  As we walked in we saw only one occupied table with about 7 other guests.  We were immediately greeted by our hostess/waitress who proceeded to ask us where we'd like to sit (table or booth) and she brought us to our booth.  The menu starts at breakfast continues through lunch and then dinner.  I immediately took in our surroundings which were quite quaint, simple and clean.  I took in the wait staff (our waitress) and I could also see into the kitchen.  From my point-of-view it seems like this is a mom n pop set up but I'm not sure.  I always like to try to support locally small businesses.  The menu explained that they are an American Kenyan infused restaurant and I was immediately intrigued.  I'll be honest, I only looked at the dinner entrees and when I saw catfish I knew that's what I wanted.  My husband ordered the rib-eye with mashed potatoes and veggies (asparagus, carrots and green beans).  My fried catfish fillets came with a choice of mashed potatoes or rice and a suprisingly terrific side of sauteed spinach that was absolutely delicious.  The portions were more then generous and my husbands med-rare steak was actually med-rare! We love wine but as our son tells us....we're wine snobs.  I don't think so and can usually always find a wine to order.  I had a glass of a red blend of Bogle, again surprisingly good.  My husband had a cab but wasn't so thrilled.  I saw our waitress opening fresh bottles, also a good sign. My husband devoured his steak and I delved into my plate of two catfish fillets, mashed potatoes, fried sweet-potatoe fries and a large serving of steamed spinach, along with a serving of tartar sauce.  I was in heaven, I loved the spinach and had a hard time moving on from that.  The waitress came by and asked if I'd like some home-made hot sauce and I said most definitely.  This is what I used gingerly with the fish and not the tartar sauce. Don't get me wrong everything was seasoned perfectly but I never pass on hot sauce. It was hot and a nice compliment to my fish.  I was only able to eat half of my plate but I insisted on taking every last bit home for my lunch today - can't wait! Our waitress, who, by the way, was very friendly and extremely attentive.  She checked on us many times wanting to know what we thought of everything but wasn't at all annoying.  She asked if we were interested in seeing the dessert  menu and, after reading a review of the restaurant that happened to be right about our booth, we said sure, bring it on.  I eat almost anything and everything so I deferred to my husband to decide on a shareable dessert.  I had already seen what I wanted, a nutella dessert which luckily the waitress recommended and we decided to splurg on.  WOW, so delicious, so perfectly sweet and yet not too sweet. It was a sugared french toast with nutella and sliced bananas in-between, 4 small dollops of vanilla ice cream on top with a few slices of fresh strawberry.  This was the perfect end to a near-perfect dinner.  I'm hoping that this small establishment, that's been there for about a year and a half, is busier on the weekends then our quiet Tuesday evening.  They are a small gem in an area of Las Vegas (northwest) that truly needs one!  My husband and I joke all the time that since we've moved here from CA about 3 years ago that we don't have ""go-to"" restaurant, you know a place that no matter what your mood or what time of day you know you can go there and get a good meal at a reasonable price (an they are priced reasonably!).  Well, we both said to each other as we were leaving....maybe this is the go-to restaurant that we've been searching for.  We will be back and we will bring friends and family Please give them a try too, you'll be pleasantly satisfied!

When the Pellegrino came out it was the medium sized bottle and when I got my check, I was charged $8.29!  Really!!!!!  Even at the higher end fine dining establishments on the strip doesn't charge more than $6 on the real Large size bottle of Pellegrino.  We ordered the Mkokotemi Frito Misto (for two) $19.99. We wanted it because it was a sampler platter of tacos, fried shrimp, egg roils and spicy chicken wings. The egg rolls, beef & chicken tacos were really good with excellent flavor. However, the spicy chicken wings had no flavor and was bland and the shrimp was the size of a quarter and not fried like the menu stated. I asked the waitress about the wings.

I agreed to order what she suggested. The burger came with a good time frame. It was a very juicy burger, but was not anything I thought was particularly special. The vegetable logs, which were various vegetables battered and fried, were pretty tasty but a bit oily.

This was the first time I was served African style food. It left me with an impression of satisfaction; I did leave with a full belly. There is a vast menu, ranging from tacos to seafood entrees.

3577052,2013-08-17,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"I hadn't planned on coming here but found myself in the shopping center and went in, intrigued by the menu.  The decor is a bit weird but not in a bad way.  I'd call it quaint, but it doesn't really exude a Kenyan vibe.

Only 3 other customers were there when I went in, and 3 more came in behind me.  I was seated quickly and given water.  I ordered the chicken curry with chapati.  It took a while to arrive and when it did I was pretty shocked.  Granted, a Kenyan/Indian dish is probably going to surprise, but it was too much.  The curry did not have chunks of chicken, but two entire chicken legs mostly submerged in a pretty watery and weak curry sauce.  It was really difficult and messy to try to eat.  What really killed it for me was the potatoes in the curry were mostly raw.  The smaller potato chunks were fine, but the larger ones were really undercooked.

I have never sent a dish back at a restaurant before but I had to send this back.  It was just inedible.  

Instead I got a burger with pepper jack cheese and bacon.  This, too, took a while to arrive.  It didn't come with fries or any side, which was fine considering my appetite, but I wasn't asked if I wanted fries or a side and I think this would be pretty normal.  The bun was big but nothing amazing, the cheese was fine, the bacon was good, but the burger itself was pretty bad.  I asked for it medium-well and got it well done.  I'm not going to complain about this as I'm fine with that, but I will complain about the fact that it was clearly a thin frozen preformed patty.  Honestly I'd rather have McDonald's, especially considering that the burger with no sides was $9.67 after tax!

I feel like maybe I ordered the wrong things.  I'm a huge curry fan but the curry wasn't good, and maybe it's my fault for ordering a burger when the curry didn't work out, but I also think a restaurant shouldn't just put bad frozen food on the menu to attempt to appeal to more customers.  

I think the prices of the other dishes were reasonable, however with almost $10 for a bad burger with no sides, and considering that it took almost an hour for both the curry and then the burger replacement with the restaurant not busy, I have to just say stay away.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,0,2,CmUP-NSWReyxGaj00iITFQ

If you are in a rush and dont care about the quality of your meal dont come here, they take their time and do it right.
For our anniversary dinner I wanted lobster, good lobster, so I went in and spoke to the owner and told him what I wanted; 2 LARGE lobster dinners. I requested 12-15 oz tails and prefer them fresh, hey I dont want much right? oh yeah and can you cook said lobster properly? he took my reservation and didnt even ask for a deposit. we showed up for dinner and were directed to a table already set up and waiting for us, they even had burning candles, BTW we were early. within 30 min out comes our dinner served by the chef personally. 4 countem 4 large Lobster tails beautifly prepared and cooked to perfection.

Seating:
We were greeted promptly and were sat relatively quickly (our server/host just had to set the table/wipe down the booth). Of course, I noticed the Mimosa station upon entering, so when we were asked what we wanted to drink, I asked for a (Delightful) mimosa... and coffee. :)

Food:
There were a lot of choices on the menu and a short description of what was included. A lot of ""Traditional"" American breakfast fare, some with a Kenyan twist. I wanted to try the ""Hakuna Matata Rafiki Breakfast"" (yes, Lion King fan here ;)), but my eye was drawn to the ""Tatu Estate Brunch Special"" -- aka Chicken and Waffles! ZOMG. Chicken. So. Good. Waffles. Crispy! The sweet potato fries topper was a pleasant surprise, too. It was all flavourful, but not overpowering. The spinach nu jue complimented the entire plate.

Also tried the Mandazi. We  didn't know what it was, but our server explained it as deep-fried dough. Hello donuts! Kenyan-style. It paired well with honey. 

Serving size was great and more than enough (except for my bro who's bulking up and inhaled his steak and eggs) ;) 

Service:

However, it's definitely worth it.

They're open for all three meals, and even though their web site states that their breakfast menu is only available until noon, they were more than happy to take breakfast orders when we ate at 1pm. They also have an early bird breakfast daily from 7-9am and a weekday happy hour from 3-5pm, both of which feature $5.55 foods and drinks, and both of which we sadly missed. Maybe next time...

They has a Yelp check-in offer for one free drink per person w/ purchase, which I used for their house white wine, a Moscato. It wasn't the best Moscato that I've had - just sweetness without much to fall back on. But then again, I wasn't here for the wine, and I didn't care enough to order a more complex wine, so I'm pretty much ignoring it for rating purposes.

Owing to a glowing review by the Vegas Burger Blog, I decided to order the River Road Jetpack Burger ($9.99), which contains avocado, grilled sweet onions, house pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes. The bun was nice and the meat was seasoned fine, charred, and cooked properly to my request of medium-rare. The sweet onions were very prominent, but the pickle wasn't so noticeable, and I could've forgotten that there was avocado in the ingredient list. Still, the construction of it reminded me somewhat of Bachi Burger (which I love), and the addition of their milder hot sauce (ask the server for this or their very hot sauce) gave it enough depth of flavor. I wasn't completely blown away, but I'd consider having this burger or another of their burgers in the future.

I tried a bit of the Nairobi Farmer's Splendid ($8.99), which one friend was raving about and ended up ordering. It was better than my burger. It's a mixture of ground beef, roasted corn (one of my favorite things), black beans, fried eggs, and cheese that can be eaten with mandazi, a fried bread that seems light and not greasy. The same sweet onion is provided on the side, and this along with the aforementioned milder hot sauce were welcome but not necessary for enjoying this dish. I'll probably have to order this on my own in the future.

We were considering going elsewhere for something creamy and frozen, but we ended up getting desserts here. The Churro Split ($9.99) was the more interesting of our two choices at first glance, with churros, bananas, pineapple, pecans, vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate, and creme Chantilly. The flavors and textures were all there, and the pineapple was especially sweet and juicy, but I don't think it came together cohesively as a dish.

On the other hand, the simpler sounding Sweet Goblet ($7.99 - with creamy cheesecake, Oreo cookie crumbles, strawberries, and reportedly a fresh berry coulis (but definitely some whipped cream and chocolate syrup) - exceeded expectations. It had figurative and literal layers that blended together harmoniously in a faux waffle cone serving cup. It tastes richer than the mundane sundae that it sounds and looks like, and it's simply satisfying as a dessert, especially if you like cheesecake or cookies & cream.

Overall, my impression of Wine 5 Cafe is that it's simple food done right, whether it draws inspiration more from its Kenyan roots or its American home. And like a lot of places, I wish it were closer, but at least it's not far off the highway. My Northwest and Summerlin friends should definitely take notice and give this place a try.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,4,0kYWy1E7ZJNPEqelOZBozg

4259869,2011-08-08,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"Disclaimer: though my husband worked with the owner a few years back, at a casino, we were not given a freebie in any way/shape/form for our meal here. So this review is the real deal (then again, all of mine are). I just wanted to make this clear.

How did we find out about this place? My husband ran into the owner while on a shopping trip- they worked together so they did some catching up. My husband asked me to look it up, the menu sounded really good (and was reasonable), plus, a couple of the reviewers here (only 15) mentioned the Salmon Reuben, which I was eager to try. So, a couple weeks later, we came for lunch; this was yesterday. This used to be Gallo's (pizza & pasta)- I never actually went here, but the former company I worked for (which was around the corner), ordered food from this place on a regular basis.

We don't live in the area, so this a bit of a drive (located in the Target shopping center, on the corner of Cheyenne & Tenaya), but the 95 makes it a bit easier. But the trip was well worth it. The ambiance is very nice (this is what remains of Gallo's), kinda reminds me of Mimi's Cafe but not as kitschy, more on the elegant and tasteful side. It almost feels like a bistro (minus the snooty wait service and the high prices). The servers are dressed in white shirts and black pants. 

Tino (the owner) sat with us for a bit, for a quick chat/visit. I already knew what I was going to order. The official name is Mr. & Mrs. Reuben- your choice of beef, chicken, or salmon. My husband ordered the Cheyenne Pork Sandwich. We also got a side of fries. The water is filtered BTW (my husband tasted the difference). The sandwiches came with a side salad with a vinaigrette dressing (wasn't listed in the menu). My sandwich was so yummy. Normally, when the sandwich falls apart, I get frustrated, but this was a different experience. The salmon was a generous size, and it was flavorful and juicy (not dry at all, or overdone- hate when fish is overdone). The marble rye was very good, and the sauerkraut was a decent amount as well. This instantly became my favorite! I am a huge reuben fan (but I don't get it as often as I would like) and this was the first of its kind, for me. I didn't finish the bread part though, because it was a big sandwich- I finished the rest of the salmon (heck ya!). Plus, I had the side salad (pretty good, actually, except the occasional bitter leaf) and the fries (served in a parchment-lined bowl, standing, and perfectly seasoned. My husband let me have a bit of his sandwich and the pork was really full of flavor (I don't eat pork much). The bill was around $23.00 for the both of us. It seemed slow for a sunday afternoon, but they told us that typically July & August are the slowest  months. There was another party besides us.

This is a Las Vegas gem- so I am calling on all my yelp'er friends out there to come to this restaurant and show your support (and write those reviews too). There are appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, and entrees, as well as sides, and breakfast, too- it is described as a restaurant with fusion food featuring a Kenyan twist (the head chef- my compliments BTW). Some of the names of the dishes feature streets in town like, Cheyenne, Tenaya, and Warm Springs. Many of the items are under $10.00, maybe six items on the menu are over $10, but  under $20.00. There are so many things on the menu that seem really delicious. We're eager to try other things on our next visit. My husband really wants to try the PB & J French Toast!!!  

The website probably needs some updating. The hours are listed as 9-9 daily, but it's really 11-9 mon-fri, listed on the takeout menu (order for pickup) and the front door. 

Oh, I almost forgot- this restaurant was mentioned in the Las Vegas Review Journal and Seven magazine (the best of Las Vegas issue)- not bad for being open for 5 months. Check out the link for the LVRJ:

I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but couldn't sell the spousal unit on African fusion food.  Finally I sold it as a new sandwich place (I felt bad at first) and we were both glad we came here! 

We called ahead and reserved a booth (easier to corral the wee one than at a table) and it was waiting for us when we got there.  It is nicely decorated and cozy; you can almost forget it's in a strip mall.

We had the samosa appetizer (the hubs was skeptical, but it was delicious!), W5C Mixed Grill (which was a sampler of pork, beef, salmon, and shrimp with some awesome veggies and rice), and the Taste of Nairobi (like a whole chicken... maybe half in super yummy curry and chapati--a tortilla-like bread).  You can pick how intense you want the spice level (we opted for medium, which was yummy  but we might go for a little spicier next time).  The portions are large, we ended up taking a lot of food home.

4484652,2014-01-11,0,eMKqAItLbazgUT8xokz7fw,"My last review of Wine 5 Cafe was for a restaurant that had the same name, but a different menu and vibe of today's.  Gone is the Italian guy and the continental menu, and in is the African touch.  Though we liked it then, we hadn't been back; we returned this time after reading a glowing review of the place in our Zip Code magazine and checking the latest Yelp star rating.  And it didn't disappoint!

We were dismayed to walk in at about 7:30 pm on a Tuesday and find that we were the only ones there.  I felt bad using our Yelp check-in offers of a glass of wine.  Well, apparently not bad enough :).

Service by our waiter, Robert, was excellent and efficient.  We shared the samosa appetizer - two giant samosas with cups of red hot sauce for spicing it up.  Delicious, though not the absolutely best I've ever had.  We also shared the Nayama and Ugali main course and loved it, though I'm still incredulous that the sweet potato logs were really sweet potatoes and not yucca.  I like yucca more than sweet potatoes, so they were great.  Lots of polenta, slightly chewy but flavorful beef, and a wonderful spinach stew that could have used a lighter hand with the salt rounded out this balanced and colorful dish. 

With its pretty and eclectic decor, this is a lovely, refined space that's not usually found in strip malls in the nabes, and the prices are more in keeping with what locals expect away from the Strip, i.e., reasonable!  I sure hope our dining √† deux experience was an aberration, because Wine5 Cafe deserves to be full every night, even on Tuesdays.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,1,4,z9GQFBGN1-NQMToLMLY8lQ

I walked in the door at 630pm, and was not handed a menu for about 20 minutes. At the time I was handed my menu, I ordered a glass of wine...AT A WINE BAR...and that took about 30 minutes.

I dine in large groups often. And, it is not unusual for the service to be slower than usual. However, this experience took slow to a new level!! And, it is the reason I gave this review 2 stars instead of 4.

I ordered the ribeye which came with veggies, mashed potatoes, a unique sort of fried bread, and a cabernet sauce. It was all delicious, but not hot.

I, also, ordered the Churro split. It is basically a banana split creation with grilled pineapples, bananas, churros, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. It was beautiful, but everything was out of a can...the fruit, the whipped cream...nothing was made in house, and you could tell.

Overall, the food was good, not great.

Coming in to last night's dinner, I was looking forward to trying their curry. I pretty much love curry of all kinds and with a name like ""The Taste of Nairobi,"" how could you not be intrigued? But Jieun wanted to try the curry, so I let her order that and I looked for something else that sounded interesting. I had settled on the ""Traditional Nayama and Ugali"" since it was something I had never even heard of before. But then Sun ended up ordering that. Long story short, the waiter recommended the ""Nairobi Pork Chops"" and that's what I went with.

Holy crap did we end up with a ton of food on the table. Absolutely everything was delicious. The curry was curry--nothing too amazing--but it was delicious all the same. Being a complete fatty, I love how it comes with bone-in dark chicken meat. Sun's Nayama and Ugali had an interesting flavor and I would have been very satisfied if that was the dish in front of me. But I think I might have to go with the pork chops as being my favorite of the three. The pork was tender and juicy and everything that surrounded it (veggies, mashed potatoes, gravy, greens, and garlic mini bread thingy) just combined to deliver an extremely satisfying and comforting experience. Best of all, my dish was the cheapest of the trio.

Next time, in the interest of preventing me from getting even fatter, I think we will split an entr√©e and perhaps try an appetizer. Seriously, the portions are humongous. I suppose the entr√©es at Wine 5 are perfect for taking home leftovers. The thing is, I'm never good at portion control when the food is this outstanding.

We went here for Sunday brunch. They don't have too much of a selection for brunch and they stopped serving breakfast at 12. We like to sleep in late on the weekends, but I like places that serve breakfast until later on the weekends. So it was a bad choice for us. We both love eggs benedict, so that's what we both ordered. They only had one kind available, and it was sliced pork. It was a little odd to me, and it was good, but different. I'm usually very open minded when it comes to a lot of things. My mother is Filipino, and they eat some really odd things. So I've tried everything more than once before I usually make up my mind. The sauce wasn't hollandaise sauce either. I couldn't figure it out for the life of me what it was. The other odd thing is they served carmalized onions ontop of some of the fruit which made it warm. That was not very appealing to me.

I would like to try a couple of other breakfast dishes here again. The place has a pretty good selection on the menu and it's a quiant little place. The serve was good, but the waiter was a little too attentive. Such as making a little too many odd remarks and checking up a little too often. It was a little slow in there, but you shouldn't bother your customers too much when they don't seem needy.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,5,1,3,hk-G_B2RlHWp6ky-KcE5eA

I will say that the menu was more American than I anticipated, but I am not one to complain about a pork chop!

The first impression of Wine 5 is wonderful. They have managed to make their strip mall location cozy, and the servers greet you warmly immediately upon your arrival. 

They do have a nice wine list and the server suggested a South African wine, but I was a total cheap-o and went with the glass of wine you get complimentary with a check in! It was okay, even better because it was free. 

For dinner, I went with the Nairobi Pork Chops. I thought the meat was the slightest bit dry, but I ate every last bite with a smile. The sauce and sides were on point. Delicious mashed potatoes! The servings are beyond generous especially given the price point. I would say this is one of the best dinner date values around!

For the lunch crowd, they have a daily lunch special for $6.95 includes soup, salad and sandwich.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,12,4,mlbpBnBo1QAjt5aTyLW5zQ

It is abnormally windy and gloomy in LV today, so what better way to brighten things up than some Kenyan grinds?!?  Upon entry, the waitress explained to is that it would be an abnormally long wait, which was concerning considering I had prior engagements.  We were later told that much of the staff called in sick and the long wait was primarily due to the party of 20+ heads that got there right before us.  not a good sign since I was sort of in a rush.

The ambiance was kinda bizarre.  I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  The only thing that I could attribute to the African culture was the quirky little aardvark utensil holders, otherwise, it was a word mixture of accents that reminded me more of an small town style American restaurant.  There were even encased decisions resembling a window where those inside appeared to be looking in a saloon of some sort, idk, like I said it was weird.  Not too mention all the art was of white people...no offense, but white peeps from 1920 Europe or something.  Things that make you go hmmm.

On another note, the kitchen on the other hand was open and put the meal preparations on full display.  You could see how each meal was whipped up right before your eyes.  The wait was not nearly as long as the waitress initially stated.  I got the Samosa that tasted kinda line Filipino relleno in an empanada, not bad, especially for an appetizer.  My buddy got the amped burger, another got the the omelet sandwich and another with the ginormous chili cheese fries.  Everything was amazing, but far from Kenyan...unless you count my thoughts of running a cross country marathon after having consumed all the rich foods here.

The ""Taste of Nairobi"" chicken curry was like a soup - in a great way - with whole chicken pieces (2 drumsticks and a thigh) and fresh fall veggies (carrots, squash, green beans), and beautiful on the plate. The huge bowl of curry was accompanied by a raft of chapati (African flat bread) and a side of deliciously-spiced greens. The chef knows how to use spices here! Each dish on our table was a unique, African flavor experience.

I made a reservation for 6 for dinner last night.  I started with the Iceberg Array salad ( large enough for lunch alone).  It was a yummy salad with sweet potatoes, grilled shrimp, corn, black beans, peanut chicken, tossed in a light creamy dressing, with shredded beets on top.  So good and refreshing.  For dinner, I kept it simple with the pork sandwich, stuffed with bits of roasted pork, bacon, caramelized onions, and sweet pickles.  Again, really good.  Everyone in my party loved what they had.  Not a complaint to be found here.  Very reasonable prices, lovely decor, friendly and prompt wait staff.  

The portions are very generous and full of flavor.  I wish I lived in Vegas, just to come back here again!  

Dessert was amazing as well, I highly recommend the Chruuo Split, with churros, grilled pineapple, banana, strawberries, vanilla ice cream and pecans, maybe one of the best desserts I've had the pleasure to enjoy.
