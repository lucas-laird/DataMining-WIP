The pasta is wonderful.  Oh man, ""it don't get better than that"".   Great place.  can't wait to visit again!!!!!",XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,0,0,5,9gZ7bRn-AWKm5SeK3dyabw

We were there earlier one evening. I had something called scungili salad. Scungili is conch, which people from the East Coast might recognize. I had never had it and it was absolutely delicious. I get the impression you need to know what to order here though, because the pizza was nothing to write home about and most of the Italian dishes looked like Italian American gut bomb food. Nice atmosphere, very relaxed local place to go to get away from the strip craziness.",7Ek4da_Btvznc4Q4S0_Bag,1,2,4,pS2-mW2VYbaFzVwrUuH7Mg

It is a solid, not great, but it is always good.  I never had a great meal, but I never had a bad one.

One thing really irked me.  The menu said that the Cannelloni is stuffed with chicken, then I was told after I ordered that it is stuffed with beef.  I was very unhappy. Change the menu!",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,2,1,2,_2ATGV4S4gtL3QdJOdTbNw

The meatball sub sandwich and cheese ravioli are my personal favorites.  I highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat for lunch.  I have not dined here for dinner, so I have no opinion on it.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,2,1,4,ZARb3mYQp_EWcq6VwYnbVQ

FOOD: true italian. the caprese is one of my favorites, perfect. cannelloni is really good as are all the pastas. i've tried the veal here, & i think i just don't like veal. pretty expensive, but who cares? it's freaking good!

DECOR: straight out of the sopranos. this is one of those places where the mafia goes to eat, which makes it extra cool. it has a plain brick interior, like a pizza hut. there r black velvet paintings of gangsters on the walls, not famous ones, these look like personal family portraits of their friends. but they must know where all the good italian food is, right?

MUSIC: they have a live band most nites, & they were great.

SERVICE: really personable & actually nice, which is rare in vegas where everyone's a mercenary.

BATHROOM: regular

OVERAL: i go here whenever i can when in vegas.",PUPb7ahTlJ44qZLGSHAfRw,0,0,5,sLG9qH28ZmqKW8X1bBHaDg
