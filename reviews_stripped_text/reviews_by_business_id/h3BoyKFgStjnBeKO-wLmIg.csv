I've ordered from Maestro's many times before and have always gave them the benefit of the doubt, but how could a pizza place really mess up a plain cheese pizza?! I ordered for delivery multiple times and the pizza ALWAYS comes cold, tissue-thin uncooked dough, and the taste is soooo bland! EVERY TIME!! They really like to get more of YOUR bang for your buck by watering down condiments which they charge an arm and a leg for and thinning out the dough so much, all you get is overly-processed cold toppings. I really have had it with this place. They just get more and more worse. NO MORE. BEWARE. Digiorno offers better pizza than this place! Geesh!",8nAchwrSfEKafmFnAehCGg,3,1,1,E80YfRrtDyTgsSE7ZfCJ1Q

Me and my co-worker ordered lunch- 16"" veggie supreme/ half with pepperoni added and it was absolutely delicious!!! The pizza was perfectly cooked, not too thick/thin, FRESH and hot! The slices were big but I guess it comes with the price... $27.56 for the pizza and two orders of fries. 

We literally work across the street- they said 40 minutes or so and did take that long but it was soo worth it! I love their pizza and it's the second time we order it from here.

Also, I've ordered from here before with my family and dealt with the previous owner I think it was and he was really really nice. I would've given them an overall 5 for service and food. 

As of then it's just been one other time and I don't really like the customer service the woman at the register gives but I guess it does the job. 

Just as long as they keep a good cook that's all that matters!

Unfortunately, there was not an option for a ""normal"" supreme like with pepperoni, sausage, onions, bell pepper, mushrooms, and maybe some olives. Maestro's supreme adds marinated pork, ground beef, ham, and tomato. A bit much for me so I ordered 14"" spinach,mushrooms, onions,and sausage. Damn that was a great pizza! The crust wasn't consistent though. There were thick parts which were kinda doughy, but the thin crust was awesome! I took one star because of the crust.

509458,2014-09-19,0,h3BoyKFgStjnBeKO-wLmIg,"If you're looking to find a new pizza go to place, this is it! About a year ago my brother and I started a pizza escapade. where we would order a pepperoni special at every new mom and pop shop we went to. When we ordered the first pepperoni pizza, it had been 1 am (the hours went later back then). The quality was absolutely superb. We decided to give it a second chance 3 days later to see if it had been a fluke, this time going during the day, and it was equally as delicious. Over the past year I would say that I have gone to maestros over 100 times (yes, I did get a pizza every week at least). While I have never ordered delivery, the pickup and dine-in service was consistently excellent. Regardless of whether the place was empty, or if they were having a party of 50 people. 

Having gone to maestros so many times, I've tried almost everything. Recommended eats from each type are:
Pizza- Medium pizza special, Maestro's specialty pizza, Meet Meat, and Veggie supreme
Italian Grinders- meatball
Pasta- Meat lasagna and tortellini Maestro
Philly Cheese Steaks- Maestro combo
Calzones- Five cheese
Greek corner- Gyro (most consistently delicious gyro in vegas. very good portion as well)
Appetizers- mozzarella sticks and calamari fritti (so crispy and flavorful)
Dessert- Chocolate cake. Beware of the baklava by the way. Sometimes it can come out stale tasting. Avoid getting it at night.

Finally, I'd like to add that Maestros is not a business stuck in its beginning. They continue to make improvements to service, interior restaurant layout, and food quality. Happy eating!",vI0wXHLsJnt1mu5iyCZSUg,0,0,5,jLnFnQ8qrvybjzTMg7iajg

Unclear whether there is typically table service (as we received) or if it's a walk-up order place (as a customer after us did). Much of their business is delivery and take-out/pickup. 

Service was okay but not personable or attentive; drinks not refilled, orders came out slow and one at a time, eventually the cook brought them out after noticing they were sitting on the counter as waiter took a lengthy phone order.

Menu is extensive: pizza, chicken wings/tenders, salads, burgers, hot and cold sandwiches, gyros, and about 10 $7 lunch specials. Most of group got lunch specials- I opted for buffalo chicken salad ($9), portions for all were huge and no one actually finished. Best value was 1 topping small pizza and drink.

Salad I ordered was large, portion of chicken was large too, but there was way too much wing sauce puddling in the vegetables rather than being able to really use the salad dressing (bleu cheese). Filling and fresh.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,3,7fL16pd9nbKTB9MuGuakGw

First of all, the person who answered the phone was very nice and polite.  I ordered a spinach pizza with chicken, which was amazing.  I also got the sampler for two, since I love mozzarella sticks.  They were solid, but the french fries weren't that good.

I was told my food would arrive in 45 minutes and it came within 20, which is a big plus.

The pizza quality is REALLY REALLY GREAT.  I cannot stress this enough.  The cheese is fresh, the chicken is premium.  I will definitely be ordering more of their menu.

We weren't sure if we were out of their range so we called to ask. The guy on the phone was rude right off the bat. I've been in the food business and knew that during lunch time things can get hectic but starting off with a negative attitude is never a good start on the phone. We asked if we were in their range and he said yes. We ordered the food and he neglected to tell us how long it would take. After about 30 minutes I called to ask how long and he rudely says he told me 45 minutes. I don't recall it but still no reason to be rude. After an hour and 20 mins passes I called again and he tells me 'look, we are very busy. You will get your food soon just wait ok? We are a very famous place you are lucky we are delivering to you!'  WOW!!! I'm so sorry my lordship I didn't know your special PIZZERIA was some world renowned establishment!!  Needless to say we cancelled our order and will never recommend this place!

3480529,2015-06-21,5,h3BoyKFgStjnBeKO-wLmIg,"Last night we decided to have take out pizza and wings and we ordered take out from maestro's.  Normally I don't like ordering food too late at night because it seems like if it's too close to closing they either rush it or it's not what you ordered.

Last night I called and placed and order for 2 medium pizza and calamari and 48 wings.  After I placed the order I say on hold for about 6 minutes and the line was disconnected.  I waited a few minutes and called back to see what happened and the lady said she was trying to call me back.  After that was settled and the order was really placed I went to pick it up. 

In their defense .....normally they are effing awesome with their pizza and wings. Last night had to be an off night or something.  One of the medium pizzas was actually a little burned.  When you think of how you want your pizza you want that joint moist with cheese dripping and vegetables bursting in your mouth.  Both pizzas were dry and the crust tasted like it came straight out of a box.  

In the last 4 years of eating here last night I can honestly say I was disappointed.  I hate it when your favorite pizza joint used to bring the delicious and then either they are saving on ingredients or something.  Listen....get it together...we as your loyal customers know when your cutting corners.  I can barely even remember any sauce on the pizza.  It evaporated in the oven.  



I think if I ever decide to order from here again I'll have to explain that I want to see the pizzas before I pay for it.  Well....maybe I won't do that but I'll let them know they let down a loyal pizza king.",_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,8,8,3,TRHCLVFmWckl9RLqP4dC6Q

One- I was charged 12.95 for wings and fries that were 8.95, when I called I was told the prices had gone up. I informed them that they needed to change their prices on the paper menu and the online menu and that it was false advertising otherwise.
Two- My order took an hour and twenty minutes to arrive!!!! I was completely starving by the time the food got here! I am pregnant so this was significant.
Three- My calzone was burnt!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When you call them on the phone, they're actually happy to hear from you. We order maybe once a month or so, but they remember hubby by name, every time.

We've ordered the pizza a couple times. It's really good.

But usually we go for the gyros, which are always delicious. Hubby orders his with extra meat, which makes it an enormous damn sandwich. The 'regular' gyro is plenty filling all on it's own.

My only complaints are with the appetizer menu. Anything in that section of the menu is just about guaranteed to be frozen/packaged and not very good.
