I asked for a minor change,  and even offered to pay for it, and was told no. I don't remember if it was a request to switch dessert or change a side to veggies,  but I was surprised by the response.  The place looks nice. Decent food, nothing memorable.  The worst part was the iced tea. It was watered down with little fresh tea flavor.  We've only been the one time so maybe this was an anomaly.

The jalapeño hush puppies are super addictive, the all-you-can-eat shrimp deal was more than my husband and I bargained for (it was so much amazing food)! The macaroni and cheese was divine, our vegetables were perfectly cooked and flavorful. The staff was wonderful, especially Bob, who was super attentive and made wonderful recommendations. Bob suggested the Strawberries Madagascar (a fun and delicious dessert, prepared table side), which we absolutely loved! I have never tasted anything like it at another restaurant. We also tried a few flavors of Abita beer, which were an added treat. The food is authentic, and the ambience is wonderfully elegant and upscale.

The outside of the building is beautiful and a bit deceptive when compared to the actual dining room, which had way too many tables in it. So many that the servers couldn't navigate the room without bumping into my chair EVERY time they passed me. The dining room was very loud, too. Perhaps due to the fact that the place was packed, but loud nonetheless for a white table cloth experience. We started out in the bar, but moved to the dining room because live music from upstairs poured into the bar and made conversation challenging. This was topped off by  a child at the next table who cried loudly for at least 20 minutes. No one on the restaurant staff asked the parents to take the child outside so people could eat in peace. The service was ok to start, but our empty plates sat in front of us for 20 minutes before I asked the server to clear them. Bottom line: excellent food, but if I go again, I'll get the food to go.

For appitizer we had the Big n Easy sampler, a variety of their fried items such as frog legs, crab cakes, aligator tail, and fried oysters!!! Wow it was amazing! Already a good start... Our server brought out hush puppies and homemade bread! Yum! 

I ordered the seafood delight which was blacken catfish with grill shrimp topped with a Cajun Parmesan cheese serve with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli!! It was AMaZInG!! No wonder it was her favorite!

Hubby and I have been here twice now - once with the family and then a few weeks ago for date night with friends.  I am happy to report I am so glad we tried this place!  Thanks fellow Yelpers for steering me away from what this restaurant should be known for - NOLA deliciousness and instead have stuck to steaks and catfish.  I have not been disappointed.  

Both times we have had the friendliest servers who waited on us hand and foot, even towards the end of our meal when the restaurant was full. The food was delicious as well and would have received a higher rating except the baked potatoes were beyond over cooked and cold.  Wasn't impressed with the desserts either - but maybe because I was too stuffed.  I also would have really loved to try the real Cajun cuisine instead - I was tempted but I knew better (thanks to Yelp!). 

The steaks and other sides were amazing as well as our appetizers. Grilled Oysters - Yum!  Alligator - Yum!   Asparagus - Yum!  Grilled Mushrooms - Yum!  Catfish - moist and flakey huge Yum!  Hush Puppies -OMG Yum!

Hubby was not a fan of the seasoning used on the outside of his prime rib but that was a personal taste issue - the prime rib was still perfectly cooked. And they really know how to grill a ribeye (but my sexy hubby chef still is the master!) 

We will definitely be back but I will Yelp first to see if the ratings have improved enough for me to try the Jambalya, Gumbo, Dirty Rice & Shrimp Creole that I really want.",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,3,1,3,0GKoo3qRZ0W7QGWQsxIXGA

197809,2013-05-29,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"I have a new favorite restaurant! 

Ever since I moved here I have been craving some good Cajun food, and after a disastrous attempt to find some at the Henderson Crawfish Festival, my boyfriend surprised me by bringing me to Rhythm Kitchen for my birthday. The sign fooled me at first, since it advertises itself from the outside as a typical steak and seafood place, but once I saw the menu I was really excited. Alligator tail! Frogs legs! Gumbo! Crawfish! I wasn't sure where to start. 

After much consideration, we eventually settled on blackened alligator tail for an appetizer. Yum! The sauce on it definitely has a kick. The bread basket they bring out also has these tiny little hush puppies that have a little jalapeno in the batter for some flavor. Usually I think hush puppies are just bland fried corn meal balls that aren't even worth eating, but they manage to turn (what I think) is a bad food idea around and make theirs exciting. 

For an entree, I went with the crawfish and catfish etouffee, and my boyfriend got a steak ""oscar style"" with a crab cake on top and covered in Bearnaise sauce. Both meals were amazing, and his also came with a side of yummy macaroni and cheese. Everything was well cooked, the sauces were amazing, and we were two happy customers. 

We also got a couple of the deserts that also did not disappoint. 

Besides the food, the atmosphere is really nice. The actual building is meant to look like an old southern plantation house. I read other yelp reviews complaining of the service, but our server was friendly, attentive, and was pretty knowledgeable about where the chef got their product. I also like that the bar is completely separated from the restaurant, and has its own happy hour menu. I would definitely like to stop in for a drink and a couple small plates at the bar sometime.

The place is very large and attractive, but virtually empty at noon this Sunday.  We were given the choice of the bar. dining room or upstairs and we initially chose upstairs, because there were more people up there which would possibly make it more fun.  But upstairs they had a HUGE TV screen with a football game on and a few noisy men drinking beer and cheering on their team.  Decided the dining room was more conducive to a nice Sunday brunch.

After looking at the fairly extensive menu of mostly cajun and creole selections, I chose French Toast with Bananas Foster, and my husband got shrimp creole.  I also opted for the $18 all you can drink mimosas, and definitely got my moneys worth there!  A side of potatoes came with my french toast (?) and while I didn't want them, my husband saId he would have them hash browned.

The food came on my third mimosa, and was very well presented.  My french toast was just delicious, altho way more than I could eat.  My husband said his shrimp creole was very good too.  Not spicy hot, but well seasoned.  I tried a bite of the hash browns and they were great.  Very crispy and seasoned perfectly.

After my fifth mimosa, I asked them to please cut me off.  That might sound like a lot, but even now a couple of hours later, I have only the slightest of buzzes, so not a lot of champagne was wasted on them.  But they were still very good!

A few more people came in as we were eating, and a bridal shower party of about 10 young women came in as well.  I was very surprised that there were so few people there with as good as the food was, at least what we tried. 

Our bill before discount was $55 plus the fixed gratuity of 18%, and we ended up paying $39.55 after the coupon was deducted.

I would say that we will try the place again, probably with another coupon.  It is on the other side of the world from where we live so not convenient to visit regularly.  But we definitely enjoyed it!",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,0,0,4,YY9_SQtMZ-_7Yz5Kt1_CUw

So today...It's past lunchtime and everyone is starving, so we decided to explore the area for a sit down meal and stumbled across the Rhythm Kitchen.  From the outside, it looked like a New Orleans home (wraparound porch, ceiling fans, etc) in the middle of nowhere, on the inside, the restaurant was completely empty.  When we walked in, there was no hostess to be found, so we picked up our own menus and seated ourselves.

When I opened the menu to pick my lunch, and there was absolutely nothing there for a vegetarian.  At this point, I am thinking this was going to end up a disaster.

Then the Jesse the waiter arrived to take our order, I asked him if he could whip up a vegetarian meal for me out of their offering of sides - broccoli, asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinach on a bed of rice pilaf.  He said, he'd have to ask because it's not a normal entree offering and the individual sides would cost over $20.  He comes back and tells me the manager agreed to sell me the meal for $10.99.  Kind of pricey, but I wasn't going to complain at that point.

When my meal came, it was surprisingly delicious!  SOOO DAMN GOOD!  All of the vegetables were seasoned correctly and cooked to perfections (a bit al dente), the rice was equally good.  It was so good I scarfed it down in about 5 minutes.  When Jesse came back to check on us, I told him that my meal was awesome, and he just looked at me and said ""Really?"".  I guess the Nevadans just don't get the whole veggie thing.

In the end, my lunch companions and I all expected a disaster, but were all equally impressed and surprised at such a find in the Rhythm Kitchen.  Great food, great service.

I'll definitely be back for lunch again, maybe even dinner...They are open until 10pm on the weekdays.

I went with a friend with a Groupon for $40 worth of food, and they let us use the Groupon for liquor as well, a nice touch.

We ordered the crab cake appetizer. First, they were not crab cakes, they were crab balls. I believe they were put in a deep fryer, and not pan fried. They were basically crab ball things you could buy at any warehouse club and dunked in the deep fryer. They were also very salty. Presentation was good and the dipping sauce was good as well.

I had a bowl of gumbo for an entree. It was ok, again quite salty and it had some shells of what I assume is some shellfish that was in the gumbo (shrimp shell?). No big deal. I would eat it again. 

My friend ordered the ""all you care to eat"" ribs. They came with a side, and he chose Cesar salad. Salad was tasty but overdressed. The dressing tasted like just about any bottled dressing you can get at a grocery store. I tasted a small piece of the first plate of ribs and they had a distinct taste of ""natural gas"" or lighter fluid. It was a bit strange. They refilled his plate and he said the second small rack (I assume appetizer size) was good. The third plate tasted freezer burned and stale. I don't know how they make their ribs, but it seems like maybe they have pre-cooked ribs that are frozen and they either boil them and then grill or just directly grill. The BBQ sauce on the ribs was good.

Service was good, but they do seem tremendously overstaffed with a host, several servers, bus boys, etc. 

The menu itself seemed too large. Do they really need to serve pizza on the main dining room menu? I think I would come back to try the happy hour as they are one of the few places that promote Eberle winery, one of my favorites. Although we did not order any wine, the wine list was ok, but seemed a bit overpriced for the location. The 1/2 off Monday wine would be good.

The establishment is beautiful and they seem to get the people through the door. However maybe to many people we could tell that out server was way to busy but she handled it well we could see she had a party in the separate dining room along with a full station in the big diningroom.

What really made me want to write a review was how well our server handled the table next to us they started out upset about the drinks not coming out fast enough from there on out she couldn't do anything right she explained the bar was backed up to every table but this one took it to heart. Every time she addressed the table after they were short and rude as if they wanted her to bage to take the order and eat there they saw how busy things were and they throw a hiccup on the flow of everything. Goes to show if you feel you aren't getting good service look around and see if it's because your server is in over there heads or just lazy. I have to say none of the servers at rhythm kitchen were lazy all great employees but could use an extra set of hands. I highly recommend this place the food is made with heart and the staff busts there butts.,RQAVau4J3nRL2COX4VFeog,1,0,4,E8yXqG6TSG2K_tDIoijqgA

I had been bringing big groups there when the Saints were playing football, and they had always had Monday Night Football upstairs in the big lounge which had plenty of room and lots of tables.  They were always understaffed, but if you had a lot of patience you would finally get a drink and some food.  Then one Monday night they didn't have the upstairs open, so I tried to reserve tables downstairs in the small lounge.  I was told I couldn't do that, and when I told the person in charge that I had about 15 people coming in to watch the game, she literally told me that she didn't care.  So my group had to leave the restaurant (along with a lot of other people who couldn't be accommodated) and go somewhere else.  
I may have been placated by a simple ""I'm very sorry, but we are understaffed tonight and unable to accomodate you"".   But all I got was an ""I don't care"".

I informed the waiter we had a Groupon at the beginning of the meal and he told me to give it to him at the end. He brought me the check and then I had to flag him down to remind him of the Groupon. He took it off the check and brought it back with my new bill (the gratutity was already on the check). I paid the balance in cash and a few minutes later the waiter comes back to the table and tells me it is $20 short. I appoligize thinking i gave him a $5 instead of a $20(it was really dark in our section) and give him $20 more dollars.

570481,2011-08-21,2,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"On each occasion that I've driven by this faux French Quarter building that rises out of the desert on an uninspired stretch of S. Decatur, I get nostalgic for the time I spent in New Orleans several years ago.  The food and the good times were epic, and I was not blinded with expectations that I would find anything like it here in Vegas.

My boyfriend bought a Group-on for this restaurant on the mention that I'd like to try it sometime.  I warn you that this review is projected through the rose-colored wine glasses of love, so grab a barf bag if you must.

We made a reservation for an early Friday dinner, but there were tables still open when we arrived.  The hostess attempted to seat us in an area of the dining room where the tables were occupied by families with children.  I was puzzled about that since there seemed to be lots of tables available and we were obviously a couple out for a romantic evening.  We were going to order a bottle or 2 of wine, we were going to have inappropriate conversation, we did not want this to occur in front of  children.  I gently advised her we would be more comfortable in that area where other child-less nuzzling couples were enjoying their wine & food.  She guided us to a more suitable table.

Our server was a bright-eyed gorgeous young thing who was impeccably turned out in a formal uniform (all the service here were in beautifully professional waitstaff suits).  She was very friendly & took our Group-on with a smile.  One thing that really impressed me was her knowledge of the wine list.  I required assistance choosing a wine so she asked me what kind of flavors I was looking for.  I told her I wanted something dry and citrusy, she recommended the Viognier which was the perfect choice.  And she stored it in a chilled wine bucket.  Fabulous!

Soon after came the bread basket.  I sampled only the hush-puppies which were crispy, dense, spicy & savory.  I detected a smoky pork flavor which drew my hands to the bread basket several more times.
We ordered the blackened alligator to start with.  The blackened seasoning was perfect, perhaps a bit too salty.  I'm not the biggest fan of alligator's swampy flavor profile and sinewy texture, however I found the few bites I took enjoyable.  

Boyfriend had the Atchafalaya crawfish delight, he subbed grilled asparagus for the vegetable medley for $2.  He was utterly delighted with his large portion of blackened catfish smothered in cajun rice and spicy etouffe.  I was all about the crawfish etouffe.  Our wonderful server suggested I add shrimp which gets them an extra star.  Crawfish butts are very small (I already knew this), so the addition of a few large shrimp pumped up the smooth, savory, spicy stew.  I noticed some strange things on the menu such as pizza & Caesar salad which seem to be placed there to add variety so that the menu will appeal to more people.  I found this move to be disagreeable but I understand it's financially smart to cater to different tastes.  Though who goes to a Cajun/Creole restaurant for pizza?

The bar adjoining the restaurant seemed pretty popular, their happy hour deal seems like a great way to enjoy the food & drinks for a lower price. 

I know it's a long review, I wanted to give a counter response to the shorter reviews that declare that this place ""sucks"" or that they didn't meet expectations.  I would admit it's more in the category of Antoine's than the Commander's Palace.  It's also not a budget restaurant but it would be a wonderful place for a romantic date, as long as your hostess doesn't sit you around a bunch of screaming kids.",Ie8mjxHu5sUtA9yQvueUBA,1,0,4,4yHvPpA-9CGmsVRRSq4IIw

Our server Heather greeted us immediately with a wine menu. We choose 2 Tito's martinis with blue cheese olives instead. The martinis arrived in just a few minutes chilled to perfection.

We stared with an appetizer of Firecracker, which was Ahi Tuna with a spicy guacamole served with Won Ton chips. The presentation was lovely and so was each bite.
My husband ordered the Shrimp Creole with a whole wheat pasta. (Love it when restaurants offer a whole wheat pasta.)  He also ordered a side of the mixed veggies. I had the Shrimp Fettucine.
The Fettucine was very fresh tasting but a little bland for me, no problem as there was a very tasty, spicy sauce (bottled) on the table. 
The entree my husband had was exquisite! Just the right amount of spice.
Overall, we enjoyed the Rhythm Kitchen immensely. The decor, the music and cleanliness are something we always look for when dinning out.

We ordered the Broiled Oysters, Etouffe with Crawfish, Cobb salad, Gumbo, and Strawbery Shortcake for dessert.  The waiter was very slow in bringing out our food, however, he was very knowledgeable about all of the menu items.  I must say that we were extremely dissappointed with the Broiled Oysters.  It was $11 for 6 oysters.  Ok, no problem.  But the oysters were really small (almost as of they cut an oyster into 4 pieces and placed 1 piece into the shell when serving).  It was covered in sauce so you couldn't really tell much other than it was really, really small.  The sauce was so so, and the oysters didn't taste fresh.  I am use to having my oysters at the 777 Brewery at the Main Street Station Casino (the absolute freshest oysters ever) and very reasonably priced!  The Etouffe with Crawfish was awesome though and we really enjoyed that.  The Cobb salad was good as well, although the bacon used on the salad was not freshly fried bacon, but rather, it tasted like the bottled stuff you buy.  If I'm paying $7 for a tiny side salad everything had better be freshly prepared, period.  The Gumbo was average, I've had better, but acceptable.  The biggest disappointment, however, was the Strawberry Shortcake!  The picture on the menu looked fabulous and I am a huge Strawberry Shortcake fan.  Guess what came to the table?  Two slices of storebought pound cake, covered with whipped cream (the whipped cream was freshly made, at least they did that) and drizzled on top was frozen strawberries in sauce (looked like the stuff I buy at Smart n Final).  I was expecting fresh strawberries and maybe some homemade poundcake!  What was I thinking?",QHyWbzSDFTlWYeC2ee_WUQ,1,0,2,nkQ6EJT9UaDSSivAbdAb8w

I arrived at rhythm kitchen with the sole purpose of getting gumbo. It was a craving. Well, when I arrived and was ready to order the waitress (Emily) informed me that they were out of gumbo. Needless to say I was thrown off and a little upset because what kind of Cajun place doesn't have gumbo? So instead of ordering something else, I was just going to stick with the appetizer and grab something to go later. Emily and her manager (I forgot his name) were so great and so phenomenal that they spoke to the kitchen and made me my own personal batch of the best gumbo I've had to date. I'm not sure if the management has changed or improved but all in all, I have yet to have an experience in Vegas quite like the one yesterday. Everyone should go try it! :)",7lCMwww2rd_S1ePPQQ_jQQ,2,0,5,EisKsCLnte9y-wG28zxAeQ

Lacking this sort of first hand experience with New Orleans, I was tickled pink with the Crescent City Pasta, a shell fish dish with lime and spinich.  

We all approved of the hushpuppies and honey butter.  The tea was hot but service was slow.  A slight restaurant stench greeted us upon entry in lieu of a hostess.

The decor and ambiance reminded the folks of New Orleans and, all in all, it was a delightful lunch.

First, his wife's iced tea had something floating in it.  If not for the rest of the evening, wouldn't have given that a 2nd thought.  My wife got lobster, and it was woefully under cooked.  The server took it back.  It took a long time for it to be brought back to the table.  I was nearly done with my meal.  Upon return is was so rubbery it couldn't easily be chewed.  So, like our son, my wife then requested the all you can eat crab.  The crab was good, but getting more was sporadic, and they never brought additional butter/lemon when they brought more crab.  We had to request it every time.  I requested Beignets for desert, which I love and would have been the highlight of the meal for me.  They were woefully under cooked, to the point I didn't eat them, which is a serious rarity for me.  As an ""apology"" the server brought us a Creme Brulee, ""which everyone loves"".  And, actually, our son and my wife do love it.  But, the top was mostly dark brown to black.  Our son did try a bite from the very small area that was about the correct color, and it took him some effort to break through the sugar.  The sugar was so thick that while it was a medium brown on top, it was still grainy underneath.  We suspected that was why the top was so dark, that they kept the torch going to try to get through the overly thick layer.  We wondered, we don't know this, if it was served to someone else and sent back, and therefore available to give to us.  Other than that bite, it wasn't eaten.  The server indicated that the manager would be by the table, so we waited for the check.  The manager never came by and then the server brought the check.  To their credit, they removed the lobster and the Beignets from the bill.  But, it was our last time here.",5sAZ1-oNPL261aFi1CaWKA,2,1,1,enFHPtFvEyYEWq98hJRXDQ

Looked dry from where I sat. Hubby had Etouffee and he liked it but had better elsewhere.  We all had Caesar salads, very tasty and the only dressing not made in-house. I had the Shrimp Brochette Appetizer with a salad for dinner, the shrimp with bacon could have cooked a little longer so all meats could cook through. Had a stomach problem later that evening. Bread Pudding, good, Beinget too doughy and overly powdered with sugar.  Nothing spicy, though I thought the Etouffee would be.

Service, well we had a reservation and the hostess wanted to seat us at the first table as you walked in to the main dining room when most all tables at that time were empty.  We asked for another table and she really didn't want to move us any further than the table next to it because as she said, later reservations were planned for those tables.

In spite of there being only two other tables occupied, it took our waiter over 15 minutes to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to bring us our drinks.  So we sat at a table in a nearly empty restaurant for nearly 1/2 an hour before we even got a drink.  The bread basket our waiter said he was going to bring right out, didn't materialize until after we received our appetizers and only after we asked for it from another server.  So even though the service sucked, it may have given more stars in my rating of the food had been good, but it wasn't.  The jambalaya was spicy, but the consistency was terrible and the chicken in it tasted as if it had freezer burn.  My friend ordered the day's special of barramundi fish over coconut risotto.  The fish was old and the risotto was a big clumpy mess.  Even worse was my friend got sick after eating it with what were the symptoms of food poisoning.

Beautiful classic Louisiana style dining room. Our Staff Server Tahnni was quick, efficient, and friendly. She really knew her wine and food menus and made fine suggestions.

We had Charbroiled Oysters, Rhythm Kitchen Oysters, fried Seafest Platter, Halibut with Beurre Blanc Sauce, Red Beans and Rice, Chicory Coffee, and Bananas Foster. Everything was cooked perfectly. The oysters, shrimp, and cat fish had a great taste and were plump and juicy. 

Beurre Blanc sauce is a butter, vinegar, and white wine emulsion.. 

Some of the best Louisiana / Cajon cooking I've ever had. The corn meal coating used for the fish was light and flavorful, NOT at all  heavy and oil filled like others I have had. Wonderful basket of rolls and the extremely flavorful hush puppies were quite a treat.
 
If you have a need for spicy or mild with a Louisiana flair then this is the best place in the Las Vegas Valley. The building on Decatur is a fine looking place that stands out from everything around it

 Don't miss this, get there soon before the World finds it. What a place for a first and romantic date!!

The server was good but if she wasn't servicing this large group I think it would've been exceptional. Got a free app to start by joining their email club. Shrimp and crab cocktail. Shrimp was pretty good but crab could've been a little fresher and had a few shells. I would pass on this. Husband had a 22 ounce prime ribeye that was on special for 44 dollars served with garlic mashed and asparagus. Steak had a great char on outside and cooked a perfect med rare. He enjoyed it very much. Now on to my crab legs.. They were very fresh and perfectly steamed. Every piece came out in one whole piece and were juicy and sweet ( I'm a crab extracting expert though hee) I might've ate ten lbs I'm not sure but I left super full and extremely happy.

I've been intrigued by this place since they started building it last year - thought the building was in an unusual location - thought it was going to be an office building - wrong ! 

When i finally saw a sign saying steaks/seafood i was thinking - great a local spot for me to frequent. But by the time they open, i move, but i still drive by often so i gotta try it. 

I was a little surprised by the lay out - open dining area, tables close together , no booths per se and the tables are too damn small ! The entire upstairs is a banquet area - good luck there ! 

We order several apps - Crawfish tails($8.99 ) , alligator tails ( $9.29 ) , calamari ( $11.29 ) , Charbroiled oysters ( $9.79 ) - overall, very average. The calamari is way over priced for what you get. The oysters were decent, I challenge anyone to taste the crawfish tails blindfolded and guess what they are - too much coating, small lil niblets . 
We also shared a seafood gumbo bowl ( $6.79 ) - my daughter impressed me ( she tried it first ) - "" they burnt the roux "" - WOW ! she actually listened to me after years of making gumbo - i tried it next - she's right and you can see it - lil flakes of black in the gumbo, bitter. And they still served it ??!? 

I went with the bbq ribs ( $16.99 ) includes 2 sides - mushrooms and asparagus - i loved the sides, they love butter and cream ! the ribs - the meat was good - the sauce a little to sweet for me ( strong molasses flavor ) 

Daughter tried the salmon ($16.79 ) with spinach and mushrooms - good. 

The girl ordered Seafood delight with rice and broccoli ( $15.29 ) - basically shrimp, catfish and i believe oysters in a cream sauce - delicious ! 

We shared a bananas foster ( $8.79 ) - not bad but damn expensive for what you get ! 

had a nola beer - abida - very tasty ( $5.75 ) 

Overall, it's a toss-up , gotta give them a little time to work out the kinks, i think the pricing might be a little high. Definitely will try again in a month or so to see if they've improved. I wish them all the luck 

Happy Eating !

I heard a few personal reviews at work, and they were all good, so, I decided to give them a try.  Went in on a Friday night just in time to beat the rush.  There were many open tables when we arrived, but the place was packed when we left.  We tried the crawfish and alligator tail appetizer, which was very good, and they provided complimentary bread and hush puppies.  The hush puppies had a little bite (possibly jalapeño), but were good.  My hubbie had the n'awlins seafood delight, which was catfish that was smothered in what seemed like a spin on an alfredo sauce, they call it alfredeaux with green onions, tomatoes, and veggies on the side.  I do not like catfish, but it was very good.  I had the crescent city pasta, which was linguini with scallops, crawfish and shrimp, in a tasty lemon herb butter sauce.  It was very good as well.  I am not a wine drinker, but I tried the bayou belle, and believe me they do not skimp on the alcohol.  I had one drink, and by the middle of my meal, I was wondering how I was going to walk out of the restaurant amongst the crowd..lol.  My boys had the cat fish and the shrimp children's meals, and they enjoyed their food as well.  The ambiance is nice-soft jazz music, candle light, and even when crowded, it wasn't overly noisy.  My only complaint, the tables are too small.  With the candle light, sauces, plates, salt and pepper shakers, drinks, etc.  we needed a bigger table.

It was awful from the moment we walked in!  My husband ordered an iced tea and said it was pure sugar, switching immediately to Coke. 

Amazing how poor the service was, even surrounded by an empty restaurant. About 20 minutes after we sat down, (in an empty restaurant let me remind you,) the waitress dropped a bread basket and a plate with stale looking butter. Upon opening the napkin, we realized they withheld the bread and gave us hush puppies. After finally receiving bread, having asked for it, I realized why we didn't get it in the first place... It was warm at best when it arrived, and within minutes it was hard as a rock, revealing that it wasn't even remotely fresh, or good!

My husband got the tomahawk and said it was on par or below a famous Australian steakhouse chain!  

My 2 lobster tails were rubbery and tasteless!  I even got one stuffed with crab cake and it was awful...  

We even ordered the beignets, hoping to salvage the meal with sugar... Nope!  I think I took 2 bites and left the rest on the table!

The food was delivered on time and was very good.  Extremely tender steak sandwich, which I intentionally order to judge a place sometimes.  Nice portions with a yummy side of cole-slaw.

The seafood gumbo is average, you can tell there are shreds of seafood in there, but you can't tell WHAT it is. Bland seasoning, we had to ask for Tabasco to give it a kick. The only sauce with any flavor was the etouffee. The Jambalaya was the worst, according to the person who had it, the chicken was dry, the shrimp was extremely overcooked, mushy, and the rice tasted like it was cooked two weeks ago and reheated.

We made it for the reverse happy hour 9:30-11pm at the lounge. FYI The lounge is towards the north part of the building. The food and well drinks are like $3-7 and since we are in Vegas I thought they would bring out happy hour sized portions like other restaurants do, but instead they bring out regular sized portions at happy hour prices! What a novel concept. It's so funny how some restaurant advertise happy hour and the portions are so small. Imagine ordering ribs at happy hour and getting one rib for $3. I mean come on, thankfully this place doesn't do that.

We ordered the pizza, b/c I was hungry and I didn't want to chance not liking the first dish. We then ordered the pickle chips, jambalaya, clam chowder and BBQ pork sliders. In all honesty we're not fat people, we just didn't know the size of the portions. Vegas does this to diners perceptions. You have to over order to get a full meal nowadays. All the food ordered was great, but the chowder and pork sliders were a bit salty.

She, however, could not make up for the horrible, inedible food that was served to us.  Starting with the breadbasket, the meal was a disaster.  The hush puppies were little balls on greasy, undercooked hush puppies.  We had two appetizers, the fried green tomatoes and the crab cakes.  The green tomatoes were the worst I have ever had and the same can be said for the crab cakes.  The breading on the tomatoes was under spiced.  The crab cakes were under spiced and we were questioning if there was any crab there at all.  I ordered the jambalaya, and the only explanation for it was that it had been made a couple of days before.  The shrimp and chicken were so over cooke they were inedible.  Not to mention the base which was mush.  I complained about it and it was taken off the bill in the end.  My sister ordered the fried oysters dinner, and it was almost inedible.  The oysters had the same breading as the green tomatoes, which has way too much cornmeal in it, and the oysters were way over cooked.  My niece ordered appetizer size of ribs and a side order of broccoli, which she said were good.  We thought, how could they mess up dessert?  So we decided to try the beignets and bread pudding to share.  The beignets had uncooked dough in the middle.  The bread pudding was the worst I have had, ever.  And I love bread pudding and have eaten all over the world.  The bread pudding was like day old bread with a little milk poured over it, served in a large square, that was cold, with a hot bourbon sauce poured over it.  Inside of the large square was dry hunks of bread.  They took that off of our bill as well.  But even with the two items taken off the bill, it was very expensive, especially for the bad quality of food served.   I have been to New Orleans and have eaten great creole food.

Although I was anxious to try the alligator, I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor that seasoned the alligator bites. It was good, just nothing amazing. With your meal, the restaurant serves hush puppies and soft butter. I haven't had hush puppies in years, and I don't recall them ever being anything special. At Rhythm Kitchen, the hush puppies were really good.

It was all you can eat baby back rib night, which was the reason for our visit. I loved the tender ribs, but should caution that the chef packs on the rib sauce. I had to ask for my next round to come ""lightly sauced,"" and even lightly sauced was too much to handle. Getting more ribs upon request though was absolutely no issue. The turnaround was within 4 minutes. This is great! The ribs were meaty and tender. 

The entree came with a loaded potato with green beans. The loaded potato has butter, sour cream, chives, and cheddar cheese. No complaints there. The green beans were good, but they are not made al dente, which is how I like my vegetables. The garnish for the entire plate is chives.

From the bar, I ordered the Hurricane. It was very good with my meal. For dessert, I was anxious to try the bread pudding topped with vanilla sauce. I have had great bread pudding experiences; at Rhythm Kitchen the bread pudding is missing something. It was not as moist  as it looked, and therefore required an extra helping of vanilla sauce to get it down. The vanilla sauce was very good.

1543859,2012-03-02,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"After dropping off my car for repairs, we ended up in a conundrum for what to do about dinner.. only clue we had was a Cajun craving that hubby was suffering from.  So... I agreed to try Rhythm Kitchen, which hubby had visited for lunch once before and enjoyed.

We were promptly seated, the waitress was friendly and timely, and the food started.  First, the bread basket.. personally, I'm not a fan of biscuits and I'm not sure how they made those rolls out of biscuit dough but I'll admit the honey butter was a nice touch.  I'm also not a fan of hush puppies but Hubby declared them ""fantastic"" and he scarfed them down happily when I said they were all his.  Perhaps I should note that Hubby is from the south while I'm a born & bred Yankee.  He thinks spicy is a condiment while I prefer to actually taste the food itself ;)

Then, his appetizer arrived - some oyster thing that I don't recall the name of.  He loved it, which is good because he had six of them to eat.  I can't eat oysters, so I happily let him have them all.

Our entrees arrived promptly, and that's when things got really good for me.  Mine was called Crescent City Pasta, and it was basically a seafood fettucine alfredo with cajun spices.  The pasta was perfectly prepared, the sauce was well balanced - and obviously freshly made, which totally impressed me.  There was a lot of crawfish, shrimp, spinach & mushrooms.. and two scallops, which would have made me laugh but the dish was excellent.  The textures, flavor balance, and freshness of it all just melded together into a great pasta dish that I will definitely return for.

Oh, and Hubby's dinner - Crawfish Etouffee.  I tried a taste, it was definitely good - though a much stronger tasting dish than I was in the mood for.  He, however, loved it and managed some serious damage to it - despite having eaten all those hush puppies and oysters already.

But, we both had a lot to take home also - it'll be another Cajun night tonight =D

Oh, and our waitress Tawny.. sweet girl, fantastic timing, and almost psychic on her arrivals to the table, whether to just check on us or to replace a soda.

Only thing I would change is their ""DJ"" on their music tape that hawks Louisiana food between the music tracks.  They don't need to push the food, the people are already there for it.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,5,2,4,JDjNbgeMO2EdYPd6WiErvw

My boyfriend got jerk chicken and the sauce was so good! I got shrimp creole and again, amazing. We topped that off with a plate of beignets-you could easily split these between 6 people.

I approached the restaurant to plan an event for a Fraternity Bid Day Party. I approached them three weeks in advance and when I came in he told me the F&B minimum was $2000 for a Thursday when his pamphlet only said $1500. I let it go because I realize its extremely difficult and nerve racking have a fraternity come into your business and have a party. He tells me he'll just have to clear with the owner. I get a call next day, we are all set to go. I pay for our event IN FULL two weeks before the date of the event, even though the receipt says $2776 because they charged us for a $150 ""linen fee"" and a $500 deposit on the space even though the GM said there wouldn't be one needed. We paid again, IN FULL, two weeks before our event. Three days before the event, I get a call from the GM saying that the owner saw the party and they can't do it ""because theres a lot of liability involved"" but gives me the owner's number. I call the owner and he tells me someone was shot two weeks ago (before talks of the party) and they don't have a license to even throw the party. Now I'm not unreasonable, so I say all I want is a little help finding a new space seeing as how three days out of a contractually obligated party, the restaurant pulls out. I even would have been cool with a comped meal after we had to tell 300 people now that our party was cancelled. Owner tells me he can do nothing and then proceeds to avoid my phone calls, text messages, and emails for the next week. General Manager of the restaurant does the same thing, but proceeds to add me on snapchat three days later. Completely unprofessional and bottom line ridiculous for ""professionals"" in the industry. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone...0 Stars",v1NhR7_ZVdrLQiKFFitQew,2,1,1,5WN0s1AnUsmrdJNqRq9c8Q

This place is a joke.  Food was poorly executed, especially since we were in an empty dining room, listening to musac.  Poahed eggs were hard as rocks and the omelet was rubbery and dry.  $72 for brunch.

Owner/ manager walking around with a bloody mary in his hand (I guess I would be getting drunk too if my business was failing), instead of paying attention to his surroundings.  I think they pay more in linen for the dining room then they do their kitchen staff.

I had the rib eye which was worse than the rib eye I by from the grocery store.  I've had bigger and thicker rib eyes for sandwiches.  The red beans and rice, which by the way is my favorite,  was disappointing.  The beans were under cooked and the veggies were over cooked.

I expect better quality food for a restaurant that is trying to be fine dining, prices and all.  The service was great and the server really was on top of it.  It was sad that such a nice restaurant was empty on a Saturday night we were the only table in there at 9pm WOW.

Now to the creepy part...... the manager kept counting how many people arrived and would linger and hoover over our table, never once said a word to us just spied.   Manager man I'm also a manager in a well know high end strip restaurant and can I say it looked as if you were making sure we were over 20 people so you could add the 20% grat rather than the 18% grat.  HA HA how funny is that.  You didn't make a good impression on me as well as my party.

Now the not so good part. If you come in early, they tend to seat you near the kitchen. The problem is that there is NO partition between the kitchen door and the nearby tables. The dark classy ambiance is ruined by the brights lights and sound of the door opening and closing. Next, when I ordered an iced tea, the waiter asked if I wanted a raspberry flavored tea, I said sure and even asked if I wanted it refilled. What he didn't tell me is that the tea was $6 as well as the $6 refill, twelve dollars for iced tea is a joke.

We took advantage of the Valentines Pre-fix menu for $125 per couple. 
When we first walked in we weren't greeted with an overly warm affection. 
We were seated on the lower level and handed menu's when I had realized that my husband said that when he booked the reservation he was told we would be on the top floor. I asked the hostess , she said oh I didn't know!? Not my problem!
We went upstairs and a nicer woman approached us , she asked about our preferences with our steak. I knew that our menu included champagne , but was expecting water at least before our food. That was not the case , we had our salads out before anything to drink . I quickly asked the server to please bring us some water. Hello!! I have previously been a waitress several years ago , and it was always a given to get beverages on the table before food! She then seemed a little annoyed and gave an excuse that she was just helping our server. ??
Our waiter was nice. 
We started with Caesar salads and a sweet roll, both were good.
Second course was crab cakes with Remoulade sauce. They were a little spicy  and tasty. They were playing a video DVD of John Mayer in concert , until a man with a keyboard started playing romantic tunes. Next it was time for our steak and lobster, my husband had to stop our waiter before we left to get us steak knives, hello!!! The meal was very good , it came with asparagus, and Savoyarde potato . Everything was pretty good. It was cooked very well and tasteful. 
Dessert was yummy , a hazelnut crunch bar that was soft and melted in your mouth with a crunchy layer on the bottom.

2035674,2012-07-15,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"This experience was so bad I made an account just to state it.

My fiancé and I went to Rythym Kitchen for a wedding dinner. We arrived around 745 only to wait what felt an eternity to get a basket of undercook dinner rolls and hush puppies. The majority of the party was already in attendance when we arrived. The party was 15+ at one point until hungry guests began to leave. If it had not been for the bride and groom, my fiancé and I would have went across the street to eat at Subway. This notion would have led to a much better evening had we seized the opportunity. Instead we stuck it out only to spit up undercooked dinner rolls and wait until after 900 pm to be served our appetizers. 

At one point my fiancé asked our server why was it taking so long for our food to be served. She responded that she put the orders in as soon as we gave them to her. The thing is no one ever walked around and asked if we were ready to order. Meanwhile all the menus were laying down as everyone knew what they were ordering. This whole time the manager was waking around with his nose up in the air not even thinking to ask how everyone was doing. My fiancé called him over and explained the lack of service and the disgust of his hungry patrons. All he had to say was "" I'm sorry you feel that way."" and some other b.s. about all our party not arriving at the same time. We were the last 2 people to arrive and this is where the waiting began. They could have taken orders from the rest of the group and we would have had plenty of time to decide. This manager was not apologetic whatsoever. He did not say he was sorry for the inconvenience nor that he would see to it the rest of the evening would go smoother. He stayed away from our section after this encounter.

The food finally arrived with some dishes meeting the expectations of the guests and others not so much. The ribs were burnt, the fried oysters were all breading, blackened salmon meant burnt instead of seasoned,  and steaks were overcooked. We had to ask for more rolls, requesting they be fully cooked this time. Drinks were staying empty for 10 minutes. One guest got water poured into her glass of Sprite. I could understand the slow service if the place was having a dinner rush, but aside from our group there might have been three other small parties in attendance.

All party members were disgusted to see a 20% gratuity added to our bills because of the size of our party. Most were asking to have the service be removed for the lack of service. The father of the bride was able to get his burnt ribs removed from his bill after speaking with the manager. This manager never apologized to the group.

Everyone in the group was in consensus that the service was bad, the manager was rude and the food was okay at best. Not one single person in the group would have stayed in the restaurant if it wasn't for the bride and groom. I almost did not pay for the gratuity fee as we left the restaurant, but I walked back in to put the rest of the bill in. On my way back out I expressed my disgust with the manager and told him I was never going to dine at Rythym Kitchen again. 

If you do decide to eat at Rythym Kitchen, I hope your experience is much better than ours.

Reading other reviews on here I can see a consensus with large groups having bad experiences, while small groups have good ones. I will not give this place another experience as I do not feel it is worth my time or money.

""Hi Shawn,
Unfortunately it's our policy to ONLY accept one offer  at a time. It's posted with our 1/2 off wine that it CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal. In addition, your Living Social deal also stated CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal. 
We do remember when you were here - and you had a Groupon you tried to use in addition to the Living Social and 1/2 wine special. 
We apologize for any confusion you my have experienced - however if you use Groupons/Living Social deals often it's standard that the deals can NOT be combined with any other offer.

Hope this helps!""

The funny thing about this response is that I didn't have a groupon that I was trying to use and YES people I understand NOW that their policy doesn't allow the use of two or more offers.  However when one is told in the beginning of their dinner by someone that is representing such policies that you could get 1/2 price bottle of wine after they knew of living social, combo that with it being my first time there and trusting the server to guide me.  I WOULD HAVE NOT ORDERED THE WINE IF I WERE NOT TOLD THAT I COULD GET IT 1/2 PRICE!!!  The ""lady"" that came to the table even said the server was wrong and he will never make that mistake again.  Great so fix it ma'am and stop saying its my fault.  As I said to Scott G to his response if I ever received a response it would be the caliber it is..  Lame.  

Also I didn't experience any confusion just embarrassment for me and my guest with being told the police were going to be called and being rudely spoken to by that ""lady"" manager.

There was literally, not one time, in which I had to ask for a refill. He seemed to have some invisible alert that notified him when one of our glasses started getting low. With his encouragement, we started with the Big Easy sampler. It had crab cakes, fried oysters, (insert o face) fried alligator tails, and frog legs. Now, to be fair to myself, I tried it all. Nothing tasted bad but, I'm still not a fan of frog legs. The texture was way too chewy for me. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the fried alligator tails. They were seasoned well, and with the crispy flour coating, I just told myself they were a different kind of chicken nugget, so my gag reflex wouldn't overpower my taste buds. They didn't really taste like chicken, just a different kind of meat. The fried oysters and crab cakes were both good. I had a little oyster shell fried into my oysters, so that kind of threw me for a loop. And the crab cakes didn't have enough ""crab"" flavor for me, probably because they were slightly overpowered by all the green onion.

For our entrees we shared the crawfish duet and seafeast platters. The crawfish étoufféé was rich, thick, and delicious. And I had a genuine regret that one of us didn't order the endless fried catfish dinner, after we ate the catfish from the seafeast plate. I was also a big fan of the red beans and rice and fried shrimp. I could have taken or left the fried crawfish tails, I think because I wanted whole crawfish I could peel and suck all the juices from and the little tails just weren't doing it for me. And there wasn't much to say about either the boiled, peel & eat shrimp or, the fried oysters. I'd say the entrees were good enough that we'd want to go back, and try some other things. For our dessert though- I died and went to heaven. Beignets, that were so hot and fresh you had to let themc ool off to eat them. And vanilla ice cream covered in fudge and raspberry sauce, with strawberries and raspberries on the side. I'd go over and over again, just to get dessert. (Or the fried catfish or crawfish étoufféé)

I ordered the raw oyster and tuna for the appetizer and steak for the entree.
Raw Oyster: The oysters were big and fresh, very satisfy.
Tuna: Taste about average.
Steak: The waitress warns me that steak is huge. If I like medium-rare, I better order the medium, because it is hard to cook through. I end up order the medium, but it comes out medium-well. I did not complain at that time because the steak still tastes good. The waitress better not giving people the wrong information again.

Service:
It is pretty obvious they lack staff, the host boy is cleaning the table and changing table cloth. The lady who wore kitchen uniform was delivering food in the front of the house. The servers are friendly, but they do need more help to run the business.

We just came from my daughter's tourney at Majestic Park AND it was hotter than hades out...what did they expect.  Plus it said CASUAL on yelp, so we came as we were.

I started with the server's recommendation of the Marti Gras Punch.  It was super sweet and undrinkable.  What a waste of $9.  I told the server several times that it was too sweet but she did not take it off our bill or offer me another drink.  IMO that is poor customer service.  She asked me if I like the drink and I told her it was too sweet and I could not drink it, and she did not do anything to remedy the situation.  

My food wasn't any better.  The gumbo was so salty I gagged trying to eat it.  I wondered if they did that to balance out to overly sweet cocktail.  I mostly ate the bread bowl and my daughter shared her Lemon Pepper Peel and Eat Shrimp which was not bad.  My son and husband both enjoyed their dishes...but you can't really screw up fried.

Everything seemed in order however when we arrived, no one seemed to know what was going on. Our vegan arrived early and had to explain what she could and could not eat. Several times throughout the night our server needed to be reminded that there was a vegan and he made the mistake of calling one of our guests ""sir""...several times. I don't know if the server didn't care because it was a guaranteed tip or what but none of them were attentive or even in touch with what was going on. Honestly, had I not been hosting my best friend's bachlorette party I would have made a big stink about the pre-added gratuity. 

The food was really nothing to write home about. We were excited because my friend (the bride) had lived in Louisiana and therefore we were having a Cajun themed party- the food fell very short of expectations. Some of the meals were under-seasoned and some were very over-seasoned and sadly the vegan meal was not cooked properly. Dessert was good, but again, they messed up on the vegan option- I mean really, is it that hard to put some powered sugar on some berries??

The truly worst part about it was after the party I reached back out to the events manager to express our disappointment and the response seemed a little defensive rather than  apologetic.

Reasons for a 4:  the food was great. We had the all you can eat buffet and there was about 6 selections to have. Nothing absolutely spectacular but the food would be a reason to return. 

Reason for a 2:  so we had a buy 2 get 1 free buffet. The waiter accepted it, and 20 min into eating her comes over and starts interrogating us ""where did we get the coupon from."" The question was asked about 7 times; however, does anyone remember where they get any coupon from? Following this he and another man had a full on argument in front of everyone about how we shouldn't be able to use the coupon. I felt BEYOND awkward and following that argument the service went from good to terrible.

I went with a friend and also discovered that if you check in on yelp and show the server the check in, you receive a free beverage (soda or coffee or glass of house wine).  That was a great way to start the meal!  I just went with a soda and my friend had a hurricane to drink.  She said it was good, but nothing special for a hurricane.

My friend and I shared the sampler of southern fried apps...frog legs, crab cakes, oysters and alligator with dipping sauces.  All were very good and it was the first time I had eaten alligator...tasted like chicken! Hahahahaha

For dinner I had the Crawfish Etoufee.  It was very good.  My only comment is that the rice that it was served with was Cajun style and for me, was way too spicy.  I am not the biggest fan of spicy food because I feel that my mouth is on fire and I can't taste and get the real flavor of the dish.  My friend had the blackened catfish covered in the same etoufee with the spicy rice.  I took a bite of her fish and it was delicious.  She had the same comment about the rice as well...too much heat!.

For dessert we shared the Mississippi Mud Pie and an order of beignets.  The beignets were lite, fluffy, full of air, and totally covered in powdered sugar.  VERY GOOD!  The mud pie was good as well and had a good coffee chocolate flavor.

Would definitely go to RK again...it was a little pricey for dinner so would want to go for lunch and check it out.

I made the mistake of having my wedding reception here based on a recommendation from the culinary school that my husband and I both attended. Through the entire planning process and the actual wedding day we had to deal with (in my opinion) the downfall of this whole place, CW (Chris Washington). He was rude from the start and made us feel like we were an inconvenience to him. 
I could get into crazy details but I'll just go over the main points. 
The day prior to the wedding my bridal party and I went to set up the room, CW strolls in telling us that he was in the middle of a movie so if we could make it quick because it's his day off that would be great. He disappeared as soon as he showed, so when we were having issues we couldn't track him down for help. After we set up we had a small pile of trash in a box that was from the decorations, I asked where I could throw it out, he informed me to leave it in the main stage and he would take care of it. Not only was it there the next day when the whole wedding arrived, but it stayed there the entire reception and it is in our pictures looking tacky. 
Issue number two with what was supposed to be a stress-less beautiful day is that we prepaid $2000 for the venue and food for our reception from 4-8. We had TONS of food out for our guests. I was so busy being a bride that I barely ate, at around 7 I realized how hungry I was only to look over at the buffet table ---which was completely empty. I went up to Chris to ask about it and he told me ""we threw it all away, health code regulations"". MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO CULINARY SCHOOL! We know good and well the health codes, the food was not only perfectly fine but it wasn't his decision to make, we paid for that food and if I wanted 20 Togo boxes then I should've had the option. The food was only out for three hours, and when I asked to see the food in the trash he said it already went to the dumpster.... I know you and your employees ate our food! Crooks!!!!! 
Finally, after the wedding we accidentally left a few things behind, a sign on the door, a bag of party favors, and a gift bag that we missed when packing the gifts. When I called to inquire about them I was told nothing was found and sorry.......

The Studs: the hush puppies served along with bread as your meal-starter; the crabcakes were nicely made -- good ratio of crab to other stuff; and the blackened catfish was also well prepared. 

The Duds: the scallop app - no flavor to the scallops, though they were well-cooked; the crispy calamari was heavily breaded and deep fried - YUCK; and the crawfish etouffee was poorly spiced and a far cry from the goodness I know.

Once we were seated, it took 15 mins for them to bring us water (still no contact from the actual server). 30 mins sitting, the server finally came up and asked for the drinks. Our Drinks took approx 10 mins to get to us, oh and 40 mins in, we still have not ordered food or appetizers. The server delivered our drinks and finally took our appetizer order only. 60 mins sitting there... our appetizers came out and the runner who put them on the table, did not explain what anything was, just set them down. We had to track the server down to find out what was what on the appetizers. The server then took our order (60 mins after we sat down). Between when we ordered and when our food was delivered, we saw the server a total of 2 times... no refills on our drinks...we actually had to ask other servers for refills.

For the $300+ bill that we got for 4 people, this type of service in UNACCEPTABLE!

This is a 3.5 star kinda place... a little better than just ""OK"" but not 4 stars.

This is for the restaurant side as we didn't go to the lounge/bar side.

Dinner on a Tuesday night....

Service:  
Great!  Jesse took really good care of us. Of course, the place was pretty empty and it was just us and a couple other tables.

Ambiance: 
Nice.... White Table cloth kinda place but not stuffy... definitely can wear nice jeans to.

Menu: 
Good selection of all different kinds of ""New Orleans"" type of food (crawfish, alligator, catfish) plus the usual fare like chicken and pasta dishes.

Taste:  
Hushpuppies are AWESOME!  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside... and not grainy like most hushpuppies I've tried. Plus, these have  nice kick to them... I think there were pepper pieces in them.

Shrimp Broquette appetizer: nothing special.... the menu described it as being wrapped in bacon... but we didn't see any bacon... it came out like a Shrimp kabob on a skewer with bell peppers and onions on rice pilaf.

Jambalaya was pretty good... not the best I've ever had but meaty and filling.

The Crawfish Etoufe was ok... I've had better.... but the size of it... Wow!  I think this could easily be shared. And it was filled with lots and lots of crawfish which was really nice.

The Vegetarian Plate made a great side dish.  It's listed under Salads... but we ordered it as a side to our entrees... and it was pretty big and came with grilled asparagus, zucchini, steamed brocolli, mushrooms and rice pilaf.

Price: A little on the pricey side... I think for 3 people our total plus tip was $140.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,3,3,3,U8X-URf84Bjw8ZyUSMkKSw

The facade of the building, the entrance/lobby, and the dining room are so beautiful. Elegantly decorated- once inside you will forget that you are in Las Vegas.

We had sides of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. After dinner we had the brownie dessert and creme brûlée. The bill was 80$ and that is when I just didn't feel the wow factor that I was hoping for when I made the reservation. Food was good, just not amazing. I didn't leave thinking about when I might return. I didn't want to tell my friends all about it. I can't put my finger on what was negative or how I would suggest that RK could improve.

3015071,2012-10-26,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"There are many steakhouses in town, many options for cocktail hour, but this place has a few things going for it--frog legs and alligator.  I figured that it was time to come back and try the food; like others before me, this place is a hit or miss, and this time it was a rollercoaster ride.  

We started with the cajun grilled scallops over rice and fried alligator.  White alligator meat isn't a problem, but the dark meat is a bit game-y.  I ate it, but I didn't enjoy it as I should have.  The scallops were definitely blackened and good with the sausage they skewered together.

The main course was a Snake River Farms NY Sirloin that the server said was wagyu-like.  I am going to assume he meant American wagyu because the meal was only $39 and included blue lump crab meat.  Anyway, the steak was pretty tough for a Snake River Farms cut but it was well seasoned, no doubt.  The crab meat was nice, and I never ordered an oscar-style steak before.  That being my first time topping a steak with anything, it was okay, but I didn't enjoy it as I should have.  The side of mashed potatoes and the veggies were just as big as the steak.  Needless to say, they really should cut the side dish portions down.  It was a waste.

Dessert was skipped because the food portions were huge as it was.  Overall, for $156 bucks it was okay, but I wouldn't come back again.  The service was interesting; he was a nice guy, but the rush to leave the table after our order or after checking on us felt just a tad like we were imposing on his time.  I still tipped him reasonably well because he kept the water topped off.

There's just one thing I'm worried about--the air fresheners.  I cannot begin to explain the overwhelming scents of Febreeze in this restaurant.  It's to the point where I swore something rotted and they were masking it, or the carpet is musty and they're masking that.  I just don't like seeing Febreeze spray bottles in my hostess's hands when we walk in and those standalone units above a few booths.  Scary to me.

If you believe my opinion counts, then here it is:  don't go there unless it's one of those ""we need to try every restaurant in Vegas at least once"" kind of moments.  Portions are a good size, but the overall experience is lackluster.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,0,2,R6FEpA7KQgvbT2ROEPSZQw

3024292,2011-01-27,2,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"I love judging books by the cover....thats how I ended up tonight with my mom at the Rhythm Kitchen.

For months I have driven by this impressive edifice at Decatur and the 215 and wondered what kind of awesomeness went on inside.  It was clear from the facade there was some type of N'awlins food going on and with mamma's money paying the tab, I finally had an excuse to venture over.  

I was immediately struck by the size of the place.  The lounge and bar area is big and almost completely separate from the rest of the restaurant.  The dining room is even bigger and nicely apportioned...Im a sucker for table clothes and they of course have them.  Smile.

The menu has many Creole specialties and is fairly expansive.  The wine menu is pretty average and I was disappointed to see that the wines by the glass were kind of pricey for the quality.  They did redeem themselves by having three types of beer from Abita in Louisiana on draught which were tasty.  

A bread basket is brought out to start that has dinner rolls and............wait for it.........................HUSH PUPPIES!!!!!  I love hush puppies and these were excellent, not those janky fried mush balls you get at fast food fish places named after a pirate.  We also ordered one of their appetizers and got the Crab Cakes which came as three large crab balls.  They had a nice batter on the outside and rich, warm crab on the inside.  The remoulade sauce was a nice complement for them as well.  

I ordered the Seafood Gumbo and my mom got the Shrimp Jumbalaya and both were generous servings with rice and, peppers and Andouille sausage.  The funny thing however was that there wasn't much difference between the two in terms of look and composition.  Strange.  I mean we were both happy and the taste was excellent but they were almost the same.  In fact, I might suggest getting the Gumbo because its significantly cheaper.  But yeah, the doppleganger effect was odd.   

Overall prices are reasonable, service crisp and friendly and food pretty darn good.  They're not reinventing the wheel at Rhythm Kitchen but they are serving up decent New Orleans style cuisine.  

Sometimes its best to leave a mystery a mystery because your not happy with what you find out and its better to dream about all the possibilities that could be.....thats not the case here.

Our most recent visit was this past Saturday. We arrived at 5:00, and we're pleased at how quickly our meal came. We ordered two emtrees and shared everything. We ordered the Crab Cakes Elaine and the Shrimp Brochette and gave both dishes 5 stars! 

The Shrimp Brochette featured skewers of bacon wrapped shrimp, peppers and onions. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked...the shrimp were plump and tender and the creamy rice that accompanied  it was amazing (it was a creamy beurre blanc!)

We really enjoyed the flavor of the Crab cakes! They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and smothered in a delicious shrimp etouffe! The etouffe sauce was very rich and flavorful, with a hint of spice, but not too much, and also came with rice. 

Both dishes came with sautéed squash and zucchini, which was perfectly cooked al dente and had a hint of garlic taste.

The service was quick and personable...Eric was our server and was very attentive.

In the past we have also enjoyed the Jambalaya and the Catfish with Shrimp Creole, and agreed that Rhythm Kitchen served us one of the top 3 filet mignon we have had at a restaurant!

We came here for Thanksgiving dinner a couple of years ago and it was delicious! We did not have the buffet. We ordered the dinner and we loved the fried turkey!  All of the sides were flavorful and the pies were scrumptious!

The environment/atmosphere was theme-wise, on point. The hostess was what you'd expect I suppose. Our server was extremely nice and attentive and I tipped her accordingly. In fact, honestly everyone seem nice or at least pleasant enough to make you have an enjoyable experience. From the other reviews I read, I was not necessarily expecting but prepared for quite the opposite. 

As I stated above, I'm summed up as a pretty hard but certainly fair food critic. The food wasn't that impressive especially for the prices. I don't have a problem with spending a good deal about of money on food because it's an experience for me and something I greatly enjoy. I do have a problem with spending a lot of money on mediocre food. Perhaps it was what we ordered that didn't impress me which was: Seafood Gumbo, Alligator Tail, Frog Legs, Fried Crawfish w/Fries, Shrimp (which were fried also - My mom did however love it) and ribs (for my little guy). My youngest son said the best part was his Caesar salad because he liked all the dressing they accidentally poured. 

Overall, the food wasn't bad, but unfortunately it wasn't what I hoped it was. I will definitely go back to try some other dishes simply because the service from my waitress was great. I wish I remembered her name. She was a younger Asian woman with a smile that brightened your heart. And no, I'm not a creepy dude  I just appreciate good service. 

I'd say if you've never had real N'Oleans food, you'd probably really like this place. So go try it out. 

PS: My only Tip would be, after reading other reviews, avoid eating here on popular holidays where any restaurant would be overly crowded or busy and instead go on an off night of the week so that you experience it for what it is without uncommon distractions.",ili7kmzpzbJUgQ5wv0kymQ,3,0,3,W2rGJlHL1a9noNL9sAX2Zw

Eric was our waiter. He was super nice and funny. We asked about the check in special and free dinner entree birthday coupon... he had to go ask about it but in the end we were able to use them

After all our drinks came... they brought us the bread and hush puppy basket. bread was soft, fluffy and warm. Hush puppies were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. They had a little kick to them which I liked. I wish they were a little bigger though. The one small suggestion I will make is trading the unsalted butter for salted. The roll was good but the unsalted butter just made it pasty... a little salt would have brought out the slight sweetness of the bread.


We ordered the calamari, $12, as an appetizer. It was pretty tasty. Perfectly seasoned and not overcooked. I wish the sauce was a little thicker though. It had good flavor but it ran all over the plate when poured.

Dinner entrees can be served with soup or salad in full or half. We all ordered half a caesar, $4. Croutons were yummy...not break your teeth hard but crispy. One of my friends didnt care for the dressing... l thought it was.good...My friends ordered the pasta special $27... I believe it was shrimp and half of a lobster tail over linguine in a tomato, white wine, shallot and garlic sauce or something like that. Came with a breadstick which one of my friends was a little burnt on th bottom. They said the pasta was pretty spicy but they enjoyed it. I ordered the 14 oz ribeye with red beans and rice and it came with brussell sprouts, $26. steak was a perfect medium rare and seasoned perfectly. Nice grill char on the outside. It was tender and juicy. Red beans and rice were perfectly seasoned with a slight kick of spiciness and not watery or over cooked. Sauteed brusell sprouts were tasty, slightly buttery and sweet and not over seasoned. 

We were too full to order dessert but the selection looked good. They did bring out a sundae for my friends birthday.

Over all.. we had a pretty nice dinner. Some minor adjustments and this would have been a five star night. Service was great. The staff was super nice and friendly. Food was really tasty.

Additionally, I have sampled a friend's shrimp pasta and several of the fried appetizers - the appetizers were nothing special, but the shrimp dish had great flavor!  

Aside from the food, though, Rhythm Kitchen offers many different wines and specialty mixed drinks, including some classics like the Sazerac.  The classy atmosphere feels like fine dining, but the prices are quite reasonable, especially during happy hour.  This is a great place to take loved ones for special occasions.

Upon arrival, I asked the server if we would be able to use two Living Social coupons in one sitting and he told us we could so we decided to order up to $80 worth of food.  My dad was interested in a glass of wine and the server offered us a special that was half off the bottle so my dad decided to order that since it was a great deal.  The food was delicious.  We had the spinach and artichoke with crawfish dip and the sampler as our appetizer.  They were sooo good!  Even the butter for the dinner rolls were to die for!!!  And as for our entrees, I wanted the prime rib but they were out so the server suggested the rib eye steak and I am glad I ordered it because it was really yummy.

We were having a great time until the bill came and the server told us we could not combine the coupons with the half off bottle deal so we thought that was okay so we decided to just take the coupons.  Then the server came back again and said he could only take one coupon and not two.  That was when we asked to see the manager because if the server had not told us in the first place that we could use both coupons or even suggested the half off bottle of wine, we would not have ordered all that!  When the manager (his name is Scott) came, he just pointed at the coupon's restrictions at the bottom and we totally understood that (we only asked if we could use both in the first place because even though the restrictions state that we cannot combine coupons in a single transaction, some places were able to take more than one in a transaction) but as a manager, what he did next was completely unprofessional.  He just said ""Okay, let me ask him (the server) if he would be willing to pay for part of your wine"" and then he just disappeared into the kitchen before we could say anything else.  What kind of manager asks his worker to pay for part of the bill even if it was their fault for misleading the customer?  The server came back out and the manager was never to be seen again.  Hm, figures.  The server told us he was willing to pay for part of the wine because he knew it was his fault and he took full responsibility of it but we told him we did not want HIM to pay for anything.  In the end we just paid our bill and still left him a good tip because at least he was nice, sincerely apologetic, and he was a good server.  He just needs to get his information straight.

The ribs do tend to vary on tenderness and amount of rub.
Sometimes I get a really soft tender one and sometimes its a bit tuff.
It must depend on the location in the smoker and how long it has been smoked.
So, send it back if it is tough and they will fix without question.

The beignets are yummy.  I order these first as otherwise I won't have room.

The wait staff is friendly and responsive.   This is a really nice fancy place.

Walking in, we weren't greeted for a while, almost left. Then things got rolling in a better direction. Loved their ambiance. It's a large space, so you have room. It wasn't crowded at all that night....weeknight post happy hour. It was promising that we would get good service and food from the start.

Had the Firecracker appetizer. That was great: ahi, guacamole & wonton chips. All good. Tried the Lump Bleu Crab cakes; they were good but probably will not order it again....too many other good looking appetizers.  For a crab cake, I think it was too spicy for my liking. Personal preference. The vegetables were blah but the Mac n cheese was all that! :)

Loved their Cashew Vinaigrette Salad, which was not something you can get just anywhere. Had lots of cocktails, all were good but I don't remember the names of all the ones we tried in my group of 4.

Ordered the Surf n Turf, steak and lobster special that evening. My boyfriend likes steak, I prefer seafood. All was good. Steak was better than I thought, had some flavor to it. Cooked medium rare, as we asked. Lobster was pretty good. It was a little tougher than I like.

He explained that the dining room didn't open until 5p. He leaves, doesn't take our name or anything. A party of 4 walks in as the male host walks up. He greets them & takes their name, also explains to them that the lounge opens at 4p, but the dining room opens at 5p. A lady in the party says that she saw online that they opened at 4p. I stand up & tell the host that when you search on Google, it does say that the restaurant opens at 5p. He looks at me & says, ""That's Google that's not us."" The lady leaves her name & leaves.

Beignets shouldn't have filling, but they definitely shouldn't taste like that, especially not when you are paying & 9 for 3 of them!  They made the ones at Disney seem like a delicacy. The service overall was pretty good, the entrees took a while to come out, probably because the appetizers came so quickly. They did get really busy, though.

We used a groupon for our meals that came with a glass of wine each but we wanted to try multiple wines so management gladly allowed us to each have the sampler so that we could both enjoy a variety of different wines offered there. We  sampled delicious rose wines and rieslings, as well as some fancy reds. 

The building is quite beautiful, as is the interior. They played soft jazz, creating a pleasant, romantic experience for my girlfriend and I. I'm no expert on southern architecture but I get the impression that it was designed to mimic a fancy southern dining hall and I absolutely loved it. The decorations and color schemes were very consistent with their lousiana theme and you all know how much I love me some well done ambiance.

 The staff was friendly and accomodating and they were happy to give us clarification on the finer points of the menu, as well as to give us their personal recommendations. I ended up ordering the seafood over whole wheat penne, which included the crawfish that I was so desperately craving. My girlfriend had a cajun rice dish that included some tasty Andouille sausage. Our dishes were well seasoned-- not dry, not overcooked. They didn't skimp on the seafood or the portions over all.

We walked in and liked the decor, which was unique by Vegas standards (i.e. not in a casino or strip mall).  There was a live piano player, table cloths, etc. - fancy but not stuffy. We had the kids with us, and they brought a kids menu with crayons. It was early, and the place was about 25% full.
Upon our questioning of the menu, the waitress smiled and admitted it was her second day.  She was really good though.  I appreciate her honesty rather than trying to BS us to upsale the check.
I had the Atchafalaya Crawfish Delight.  The blackened catfish was great, as was the cajun rice.  The ""seasonal vegetable medley"" turned out to be green beans.  These were clearly frozen green beans that were heated.  I gave them to my kid who is used to eating such veggie delights so it was cool, but I expected more.  That being said, the crawfish-etouffee-covered-blackened-catfish was good enough for me to get over it.
My husband had the Rhythm Kitchen Platter.  We all (kids included) had a frog's leg, which was fun.  Other than that, it very good. He had the greens as a side - lots of shredded pork included without being too salty as greens sometimes are.
Kids shared a pepperoni pizza, which was better than expected since we were at a cajun seafood place.

Today is my birthday and so in tradition I came in for dinner. James was our waiter and let me tell you...by far the best waiter I have had in this town. He was as attentive and took care of everything. There was a change to the crab cakes that has thrown me off. They are more like crab balls now instead however the flavor is still there. But then my creole came out and it was liquidated a tad more than normal but still good flavor. James noticed that I only had a few bites and asked me if the dish was good or not. I said it was good but it is not what it normally is, he then said he would send over the manager Alfonzo, I told him that wasn't necessary go ahead and box it up I would still take it with me. James then proceeded to comp my desserts and Alfonzo came over and told me he comped my meal and my appetizer of the crab-cakes. This is just a shining example of why this is my favorite restaurant they like feedback! They listen and take care of their customers especially the regulars!

I highly recommend the strawberry Madagascar for dessert. It is fun to watch them make and it is so very good! Oh and service was pretty good as well.

This is definitely been true with Rhythm Kitchen.

From the very beginning I have wanted to like this place, I crave great cajun cuisine quite often and it helps to have a place you can rely on. Like BBQ, Cajun / Creole restaurants in the Valley mostly fall drastically short of mediocre.

I have been back several times since my first review, and I have to say, I am starting to warm to this place. 

Their jambalaya is not great, but it is good enough to get a 3 stars from me. 

The rest of the food still lingers around the 3 star range, the service is 3 star for sure these days, up form a dismal 1 star, but it is in the high 3 star range so I go with an overall 3 star review.

We made reservations on a Monday night. It wasn't very busy at all from the looks of it. We were seated promptly and brought water but then the waiting began. It took a while to receive the wine we ordered but then were told they were out of stock of the one requested so the manager made another recommendation, Notorious Cabernet Sauvignon. It was a great recommendation. The first problem was the waiting. Salad and oysters on the half shell took a good 35 minutes to come out. Then it took another 45 minutes for our meal to come out and when it did come out it was lukewarm. I'm guessing it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a bit because the rice was a bit dried up too. The oysters were super bland as if they had soaked it in water too long and the crawfish étouffée just wasn't the flavor that I craved. The truffle Mac and cheese was more creamy than cheesy and was missing something. The cashew vinaigrette salad was wonderful though.  With all the waiting and the mostly disappointing food I can't give this place a good review. Yes, the server was nice and knowledgeable and the salad was good but I can't think of anything else that I liked.

We got a bunch of different appetizers and quite a few entrees as well. I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment. 

The second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge. The dish I had with the shrimp was actually tasty but just too small of portions for what I paid (I think about $22). 

Overall, I would probably return again but only if I had a Groupon and only for the crawfish dip or tomohawk steak.",ohboKlO6Kg5kBpWhEZF_5g,2,0,3,7A1O1ztRC492UHS_ApZESA

That's never really a good thing, that its reviews are so all over the map that it's a decided three stars. I went in with an open mind and did not want the Yelp-tariat to sway my experience one way or another. 

When we walked in, no one was at the host station for several minutes. I realized later that it is because they have one host, and that he was seating a table when we walked in. Not the best way to be greeted at a restaurant--an inexplicably empty host station, but it ended up being okay. We were seated soon after the host reemerged. 

The hush puppies were absolutely spectacular. We asked for extra. They have a nice kick to them as well as the savory fried deliciousness that hush puppies are famous for. They had delicious flavor and were maybe my favorite part of the meal.

I was really, really in the mood for steak, so despite the menu advertising that they use choice USDA meats from corn-fed cows, I got the petite filet for $23. (Saying that your steaks come from corn-fed cows isn't exactly something to be proud of. Most of the beef in the US comes from corn-fed cows. It's not unique so the fact that it was advertised so prominently on the menu was confusing to me. Cows don't naturally eat corn--they eat grass. It's our American methods of ranching and food supply in the last 50 years that have decided that cows eat corn. But I digress.) I also ordered a side salad for $4. The rest of the group ordered a couple other things: crab cakes, pastas, and catfish. 

Everyone enjoyed their meal, and I must say that even though I have my reservations about corn-fed beef, my filet was delicious. Everyone seemed to like their dishes as well. My mom ordered something off the Restaurant Week menu, one of their pastas, and she loved it.

The one fail for the meal was dessert. The ""bread pudding"" is not bread pudding but more a coffee cake with a really odd white bourbon sauce. Not like the bread pudding I have had before and really dry and tasteless. The creme brulee was not fresh--the sugar topping was not hot or really crack-able. 

All in all, a really enjoyable meal, save for dessert and the corn-fed cows nonsense. I would definitely like to try it again!",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,6,3,4,IatTfVusVqeuz4fXgS1Naw

We had a 5pm reservation and were promptly seated.  From there it spiraled downward horribly.  Our waiter, JAMES, was beyond rude, and worthless. As we watched the only other 3 tables receive decent service from James, he seemed to ignore us purposely.  Not sure why either. He never gave us bread or Hush Puppies.

Also, we had to ask three times for extra lemon for our dozen Oysters that came with one lemon wedge. Wait, it gets FAR WORSE. My wifes son, excused himself from our table to inform James that it was his moms Birthday and asked if the staff could sing Happy Birthday to her. What happened next left me speechless !!  James was also training a new waiter, can not remember his name as we were never introduced to him, and we watched as he tried to keep up with his horrible trainer.  He was an ex military looking gentlemen from Pittsburg, we learned later.  This trainee was awesome, too bad he was being trained by an ass !!  Image my surprise when James and his trainee come to our table with 2 desserts that we ordered, and says "" We're gonna sing Happy Birthday to you now, but I DON""T sing so my trainee is gonna lead and you two (myself and Blake) are going to have to jump in ""  WTF is THAT?!?!!  I don't sing ??  Really. Either do I !!  WOW  !!  Are you listening management or owners ??   JAMES DOESN""T SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY !! Who does that in fine dinning ??  I was ready to go off on the entire place but reluctantly sat there speechless instead.  So, as Blake was going to pay the bill he asked me how much of a tip he should leave on a $154 bill?  My reply....Did you get good service ?  Tip accordingly.   I was beyond delighted to hear that Blake deemed James' service to be worth $6 !!!   LMAO, great move son !!  
For the record, my wife is in the service industry and we are locals who OVER tip regularly !! 

So, as I started off saying, James had the audacity to grovel to us to leave him a great review on Yelp, because it makes him look good to management. HaHaHa you asked for a review, you got one.  If management cares to fact check my review, I think I've made it abundantly clear, but here are THE EXACT DETAILS :  July 13, 2017, 5 pm reservation for 4 only 3 of us made it,  dinner and appetizers plus one glass of house Chardonnay $154, gratuity $6, waiter JAMES who was training a new guy from Pittsburg ( very pleasant ). 
Thanks for the memories Rhythm Kitchen ... :(   Time for us to start a new tradition for my wife's Birthday !!",utGCNXlbwHB0oja1pSEOhQ,0,0,1,9ntAdgtEI4uala_-zG0gUA

3862211,2009-07-27,1,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"The BF did some research on Cajun/Creole restaurants in Vegas before we headed there again for the second time this month. I was a bit skeptical when he asked me what I thought about trying the Rhythm Kitchen - probably because there were only 2 Yelp reviews and neither of gave me warm fuzzies about the food. Since Creole/Cajun food is the BF's favorite and we're always looking for new restaurants to try, we thought we would give the place a try. On 7/24, we took a drive down Decatur to the Rhythm Kitchen for lunch. The restaurant is a wonderful modern establishment that unfortunately sits all by itself in a deserted area. When we arrived at the restaurant my first instinct was to turn around and leave. The parking lot was pretty empty and it seemed like a ghost town. That coupled with the fact that the place had somewhat of a foul odor. I should have followed my instinct and left. For starters, they give you a lunch menu, but beware because most if not all the prices are exactly the same as those on the dinner menu. And you pay dinner prices for lunch size portions. Are you kidding me! Here's the scoop on what the BF and I ordered: 

Jambalaya - Spicy but lacked that authentic Cajun seasoning and flavor. It was also a bit too soupy. Not bad, but I've had much better. 

Shrimp and Catfish Po Boy - Large pieces of shrimp and cornmeal battered fish. Just ok. Again, it seemed to be lacking something. A bit bland for my taste. 

Red Beans and Rice - Disgusting. Truthfully, the Popeyes Chicken across the street tastes much better. 

Cajun Rice - Not sure why they opted to switch the andouille sausage for spicy sausage (as indicated by the waiter), but I didn't care for this side dish. Like the red beans and rice, the Cajun rice had zero flavor. 

Sweet Tea - I was really excited to see that they offered this southern delicacy. However, I was very disappointed. How can you serve ""sweet tea"" when the tea is not sweet??? 

On the upside, they serve you delicious hush puppies with honey butter and they will keep them coming. Just be sure to finish up before 3:00 PM because they will hover over you and attempt to rush you out so they can close up shop early. Bad customer service, especially for a new establishment.

I asked the server about the alligator because the menu had it available both blackened and breaded.  She explained how each was prepared and then said that I could get half of each.  That's what I ordered.  My wife ordered the chicken with pasta in cream sauce.  We did not have any starters.

Our iced tea was brought quickly and a basket with hush puppies and two rolls was brought.  The butter for me was awful.  It was honey butter.  Maybe it's a southern thing.  I like salted butter and this was just too sweet for me.  It was also hard as a rock from being kept in a very cold refrigerator/freezer another hang up I have.

Our meals came and I totally enjoyed the alligator.  If I got it again, I'd definitely get half of each.  It really is good.  There was a nice dipping sauce that came with the dish and the alligator had a spicy flavor.  My wife liked her pasta.  It was tri-color withe a Southern style Cajun Alfredeaux sauce.  I think the sauce was a bit off putting for her.

We had dessert.  I had the Mississippi mud pie and my wife had the crème brûlée.  My mud pie was mostly icy chocolate ice cream--something I wouldn't get again.  My wife really enjoyed her brûlée.

Service became an issue before and after dessert.  The place got busy and it didn't seem like the staff could keep their acts together.

Food was Ok and took forever to come out.(35 mins) We were told that they were also short staff on the kitchen.. smh..
Gumbo in Garlic Bread Bowl- Seasoned well, but luke warm and runny. Also didnt come with the crab as described on menu
Catfish & Shrimp Creole- very good tomatoe topping and fish cooked perfectly. Green beans were a little undercooked
Filet & Dirty Rice- Cooked perfectly.. buttery and great smoky flavor on steak
Strawberry Madagascar- Lacking in presentation. The waitress actually left because she forgot something while pan was in front of us still cooking. Table cloth that food was on was extremely dirty. Tasty though
Key Lime- Perfect! Just enough sour and sweet, tasty buttery crust.

4073476,2014-10-18,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,Very nice classy place.  Not the greatest New Orleans cuisine but good.  Prices are a bit higher than we have found at other New Orleans styled places in the Las Vegas area.  We are glad we gave it a shot but even more pleased we had a Groupon for this meal.,R5NR-spcs5frYzLr_liadg,1,0,4,nHqCdHjqCa3evyX8h_8jnw
4085938,2014-11-20,6,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"Had a groupon for this place. First walked in, had a sinking feeling that I was in an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. The place is so big, didn't know where to go. Hostess sat us down, place was kind of empty. More of those nightmares starting to creep in.

You walk in and you already smell desperation. Not from the servers. The service was fine overall. Just that the place didn't know what it wanted to be. It's trying real hard to be fancy. Waiters with the vests, white linen, wine pairings, candles on the table, music you'd hear waiting for the weather on the 8's on the weather channel plays. It just didn't feel like it connected. This is supposed to be New Orleans style cuisine. I'm expected a party, some jazz, some energy and I got...elevator music? Kitchen....nightmares....

Food. The hushpuppies were fine. Bread was old, dry and flaky. The gumbo was not good. It was microwaved as the middle was molten hot and the outside was luke warm at best. Crab inside was fishy. Hardly any sausage. The Crab Cake Elaine was a travesty. Crab Cake over seasoned AND burnt, etouffe tasted strange. The red beans and rice was the worst I've ever had, over cooked and flat out gross. Brussel sprouts came out cold. The Mac and Cheese was also Microwaved AND overcooked. Hardly resembled Mac or Cheese. Kitchen...nightmares....

Spoke with waiter (Rob) and told him we were not happy with what we got. Traded mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and got the shrimp kabob appetizer instead. Waiter informed us that there was a rookie chef in the kitchen and that it was obvious that the crabcake was overcooked. Kitchen...nightmares...

The mashed potatoes were okay, which is saying a lot for how this meal was going. There were bits of garlic in there, which was nice. Sucked that the mashed potatoes were still really lumpy. The shrimp kabobs were strange as well. It was obviously overcooked on one side, charred to hell. My first bite was grittier than all hell. Think that the sauce got burnt on that. The rice pilaf was better than the red beans and rice, but that's like saying the Jets right now are better than the Raiders. Ain't saying much. The rice pilaf was still overcooked and watery. Brussell sprouts again and this time i just unraveled them and they were just stone cold in the middle. Kitchen...nightmares....

Before I even finished eating there, my stomach hurt. It must have known that it was going to pay too much money for this type of food. I left a comment card on there and I did tell them that I could pay $2.50 for Stouffer's and be eating that while watching Breaking Bad in my underwear. It didn't make sense to have the waiters act like this place is some high dining establishment when they can't be bothered to have decent soup or even make mac and cheese. Kitchen...nightmares...

The server was nice, didn't want to send food back, but it was really the worst food I've had in a long time. It was awful. I'm so glad I tried to stick to things that would get me too sick. The rookie chef thing might be true or it could just be an excuse on why mac and cheese is getting microwaved. Whatever it is, it shouldn't be happening.

He was friendly, receptive, polite and checked in all the time. I mean when he dropped off a dish, he would say pardon me while I set this dish down.... And this happened at all three courses, appetizer, entree and dessert.

The food was good and in large portions so it was hard for me to finish everything. For the appetizer, I had the raw oysters. I am generally a fan of west coast small  oysters but these were southern medium oysters so it was only ok for me. For entree, I had the scallop entree which was a huge portion. There were three skewers with two large scallops each and it was plenty for me to take home. The dessert, a chocolate cake was yummy and was a good ending. 

The bar area also had a lot of TVs for sports fans to enjoy the games.

Actually, one of the first to be born 19 years ago at that hospital. I love the laid back atmosphere and the aroma. I was there for an event upstairs. There was no air conditioning, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I didn't want to experience the humidity of Baton Rouge in August, but all the rest of the two-story-plantation-like ambiance I wanted! As a rule I NEVER stay for dinner at networking events. Well, I did last night and I'm glad I did. The service and the food were excellent. The char-grilled chicken with the rice and veggies were so delish! My companion had blackened chicken that was also very good. The hush puppies and rolls were to frick frackin die for. I had to control myself or I wouldn't have enough room for din din. Being Italian-Lebanese I am a huge bread eater.

Before we decided to walk out I asked our server if they served beer, he said "" of course!"" And brought over the beer menu.  He then started talking to us about beer and was extremely knowledgeable on beers as well as everything else on the menu.  We decided to stay based on his service alone.  I ordered the crescent city pasta and my boyfriend ordered the AYCE shrimp special.  The clam chowder starter and pasta was pretty good but probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back.

He had never been either but said he had heard great things from quite a few people. Considering the alternative was Millers Ale House (no thank you) I agreed to give it a try. The appearances of the front entrance are deceiving- this place was much fancier than either of us anticipated. Thankfully, I make it a habit to shower and wear make up whenever I actually make it out of the house so I felt comfortable there but my friend was in a baseball cap. It wasn't until I pointed out a dude in a windbreaker jump suit that he was able to relax.

Their drink menu is almost as big if not bigger than the food menu (which I greatly appreciate) and I settled on the wine flight. $13 for 3 glasses of 2 oz of wines that I got to choose. They were all delicious. 

Our server was friendly if not a little too robotic Stepford Wives for me- but her enthusiasm was appreciated. Upon asking what her favorite dishes were, she pointed out all of the ones I could never eat- fried, laden with lactose or chock full of gluten. As soon as I confirmed that the 'Shrimp Creole' was tomato based and that spinach could be substituted for the rice, I was happy..even if she made a face at my modification. (Don't feel bad for me- I'm used to it).

A basket of hush puppies were brought to the table automatically and my friend devoured all of them- so I assume they are good! The food itself didn't take long and the shrimp dish I got was delightful. Yum, yum, yum.

Best part- my friend treated ME! 

I will definitely be recommending Rhythm Kitchen but not sure I all return often- they need just a few more healthy (ish) dishes please!",47-nM4VOQRwu86nJ4r3dEw,2,1,5,wMuP6RE3Pp0z9MNRxPqbQA

I had a sampler platter for an appetizer and was not impressed.  The seafood did not taste fresh and was overly fishy tasting.  I ordered the jambalaya, which was ok, but I have had much better.  My boyfriend had the fried catfish, in which he left almost all of it on the plate.

Service was poor.  Had to ask for a bread basket, food took about 45 minutes to arrive after we ordered it and the waiter Chris, was clearly in the wrong job.

We attended last week on Friday after the air show. We arrived 5 minutes before opening and we were the 1st to be seated. Business picked up quickly and there another 4 families sat within the first 10 minutes of opening. 

The ambiance of the venue is great, the live pianist was ok as well, his toupee was horrendous though...just saying! 

The food was great!  For our appetizer we had the calamari. It was VERY fresh! My husband ordered the all you can eat catfish and was fully satisfied. I had the crawfish etouffee, it was fabulous. They definitely don't skimp on the crawfish, which I love and that was very fresh as well. The dish is also not for person who does not like SPICE! For dessert we had the beignets and they were good...not Cafe Du Monde good but good and the portions were large ;0)

The service is where the issue is. I hope the owner reads this review because it was inexcusable how bad the service was. Their host was even bussing and waiting on tables...Giovanni was very helpful and even apologized for our poor service. Our server for the night was Erin. We waited 10 minutes for a refill on our drinks at one point after reminding Erin twice. If you decide to eat here, hope that you don't get seating in his area. It took us 2 hours and 20 minutes from beginning to end, which is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. 3 tables that were say in a different section and seated after us left waaaaaaaaaaaaaay before us.

However, I came here with a wedding party of 15 which had been reserved for months in advance and the service was awful! The table was not even set, the personalized pre-fixe menus didn't appear till well after we had been seated and tried to get drinks. I should mention that we came last Valentine's day and they quite possibly had some staff flake out. Anyway, our table was pretty frustrated by the lack of organization--there was no one waiter helping us, it was sort of whoever happened to walk by.

When I finally did get a drink it was warm and the outside of the glass was incredibly sticky. I believe we spent around two or three hours here overall, and during the waiting we had some interesting people watching--the story we conjured up was that a pimp had taken out his favorite girl for V-day, and they had nothing to talk about so the spent the entire dinner looking at their phones and not making eye contact. Tres romantic. Then our food came, and it was like really slow dinner theater. 

The food, as I mentioned, was amazing. However, one plate came out without any sides. We asked one waiter and got told they were out of potatoes but would bring some green beans. Then someone else near me asked another waiter if they had any more mashed potatoes and we were brought out a couple of steaming plates of potatoes, and she had no idea what we were talking about when we mentioned the Mystery of the Missing Potatoes.

4223858,2012-02-23,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"My family of four eats out once a week, on average.  Last night was Fat Tuesday and we decided to finally try Rhythm Kitchen, hoping for a fun evening with good food.  What we experienced was anything but.   

Our reservation for 6pm came and went as the restaurant ran out of menus and was unable to seat any patrons until already seated diners selected their meals.  The waiting area is unable to accommodate more than six people who are standing, so it was quite crowded.  We were finally seated in a room that appeared to have too many tables set up for a comfortable dining experience.  There was also a man playing a grand piano for the patrons.  Unfortunately, the low ceilings, loud conversation from too many people in a small room combined with his music made for an unbearable atmosphere.  And we hadn't ordered our meals yet.

The drink menu on the table boasts of a happy hour from 3-6:30 each evening.  There are also happy hour appetizers available on this menu.  I asked our waiter about the appetizers and he told me that the happy hour ended at 6pm.  I showed him the correct time printed in their menu and he then stated that the items had to be ordered in the lounge in order to take advantage of the specials.  I thought it was odd that the restaurant would place the menu for drinks on the table in the main dining areas only to add some caveat in order to take advantage of what they were offering at specific times of the day.  

We placed our meal orders (without being asked if we would like anything to drink, mind you) and attempted to speak with each other, but were unable to hear anything due to the noise level inside of the room.  We asked to be moved to a quieter location, which they were able to do, only to find ourselves in an even more cramped area.  The waiters had to turn sideways in order to squeeze between our table and the wall in order to serve booths on our right.  Because we had asked to move, we were now at the mercy of our harried and quite forgetful waiter as we weren't in his section any longer. We procured our own water and serving utensils at some point during the dinner.  

Most restaurants in New Orleans carry Abita Beer.  It is a local beer and quite tasty with Cajun food.  In the aforementioned drink menu, Rhythm Kitchen was offering 2 for 1 Abita beers in honor of Mardi Gras last night.  Our waiter finally showed up at our table and my husband mentioned that I would like an Abita Beer.  With a confused look on his face, our waiter asked my husband to repeat himself.  He then stated that Rhythm Kitchen didn't carry that beer and he had never heard of it.  I showed him the menu and he left quickly without asking which Abita Beer I would like to order.  He returned with a dark stout beer and left so quickly that I was unable to stop him and ask for an amber, which I prefer.  He returned fifteen minutes later to check on us, giving me an opportunity to ask him to bring a beer that I would be able to drink as the stout had been sitting virtually untouched the entire time.  Our meal was almost over by the time I had an Abita that I've enjoyed during my trips to New Orleans, but I savored the taste.  Although I was concerned that it would take too long to get my second beer, my husband insisted as it is a difficult beer to find in Las Vegas.  

Having already spent two hours at RK, we didn't order dessert and asked for the check.  Our waiter, in one final moment of ineptness, had charged us $15 for the beer that I had ordered.  This is a good beer, but $15 for a draft beer (as it was 2 for 1) seemed a bit steep.  My husband went to the bar to ask the bartender how much a draft beer cost and bumped into our waiter.  After reviewing the bill, our waiter explained that we had been charged for a pitcher and apologized.  My husband came back to our table and our waiter stopped by with a revised check, having taken off the charge for beer entirely.  

Although the food was good, the service and atmosphere were inexcusable.  I'd rather spend $150 on a memorable meal that conjures good feelings, not bad.  I won't be going back.",fp6jXecdJgZLcvcuDUf6nQ,2,0,1,mqX2ppAgPpLH9QUcOsDgrQ

So I ordered a beer but specified that I did not want it before my meal. It arrived well in advance of the food. I ordered the catfish fillets, which were unremarkable, but then what can you do to catfish fillets? The side dishes (some kind of relish and cole slaw) were substandard and stingily portioned. Our bill came - yes, one bill. We held him to his word and forced him to provide separate checks as promised. There was an 18% gratuity added to the check (!).

As soon as I got upstairs i heard Radio Citizen's Hop song and knew it would be a decent place. They easily accommodated our last minute group of about 20 people. The upstairs is decorated in a very contemporary style w/my favorite color deep purple.  The food was well-seasoned and my only complaint is the pasta sauce was too oily. The best was the staff; it seemed as though they liked where they worked and went out of their way to be helpful.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Southern/Creole/Cajun food and we've been on this adventure to search for some good NOLA-style food here in the desert. We've actually already found it, unfortunately, it wasn't here. 

Customer service was top notch. Atmosphere was great, except the low lighting, that was horrendous. Christina, our server, was great. Here's the reason for the 2-Stars... 

As soon as I walked into the building, I was pretty impressed at the staircase leading to the second floor. It's a fine dining establishment and the decor is nice. 

Although I haven't actually been to NOLA, I've set the bar pretty high for NOLA style food because it's sooooooooooooooooo good! 

I like good food and I love it when I find a place is able to WOW me enough to get me to come back for repeat visits. Unfortunately, Rhythm Kitchen fell short of making any kind of impression on me. Their food is quite forgettable, the food wasn't up to par with what I've experienced else where. Again, I haven't been to NOLA, I will be visiting in Aug, so I am hoping that this is not the way the food really tastes because this was so disappointing.

Very nice waitress.

Negatives
Of four of us that ordered steaks I was the only one who didn't have to return mine.  We are all prior military and have eaten some crappy food so to actually return something means it was really, really not what we ordered or very bad.
Hostess, sadly, was really clueless.

I'm glad that we went a little out of our way to try this place. The restaurant was much nicer than I had expected since I thought it would be very casual, but none of the other diners was dressed overly formal.

To start, I was impressed by the bread basket. The hushpuppies in the bread basket were a nice touch and very good.  We had the cajun grilled scallop appetizer and I couldn't believe that an appetizer had such a generous portion. The scallops were perfectly prepared and the other flavors on the skewer and in the rice made for a great tasting dish overall. The appetizer was almost generous enough to be a light meal. 

For my entree I had the shrimp creole which was very flavorful and had plenty of large shrimp. The spice was just the right amount that didn't overwhelm the flavor. My husband had the catfish with red beans and rice. The red beans and rice were quite yummy. The catfish was good, but it is definitely lighter than the heavily fried catfish most people are probably familiar with.

To finish the meal we had the key lime pie and fried ice cream. The key lime pie had a nice tangy lime taste with a buttery graham crust. It was almost as good as the key lime pie I make. The fried ice cream was good and chocolatey.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,1,4,NJW2l_kdLYJpIHrc2eytsA

We were seated quickly and introduced to our waitress as we were told it was her 2nd day on the job.
We ordered calamari as an appetizer, small salads and our entrees all at once and requested that no food should be spicy.
The hush puppies had no taste other than jalapenos... hello no spicy? We asked for more bread but please no more hush puppies and we get another basket of hush puppies...? what? the more experienced waiter/ supervisor spent most of his time talking to the 5-6 tables with diners about their special ""Injected"" turkeys they will be serving for thanksgiving. I mean this guy spent a lot of time describing to diners how they ""inject"" their turkeys in preparation steps before cooking...???
They bring the entrees and one of them is wrong....I hate sending things back but...anyways it comes back wrong again... forget it! I ate it that way.. too fearful of sending it back again and having who knows what happen to my food.
The gumbo was tasteless, the ""garlic breadbowl"" the gumbo was supposed to come in was just a plain bread bowl? the jambalaya was good... but nothing to impress. The caesar was good, the bread in the basket was good.
Water was constantly being refilled which was good. 
It seems the food is hit or miss but the service is attentive and at the same time clueless... it seems everyone is either new or all their waitstaff are in a daze... from not paying attention to bringing food to the wrong table...to forgetting part of your order ..like ""the sides""..

4451876,2014-03-16,3,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"An exceptional experience with Cajun food + white table cloth service and charming staff + delicately lit dining room, and gorgeous views of Las Vegas through large glass windows (if you get a seat upstairs).

My family and I came to Rhythm Kitchen during Las Vegas Restaurant Week. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and waited for the hostess to prep our table. After we were ushered into their dining room, which is classy, yet has a feeling that you will be served Cajun/French Creole food from the heart.

Not everyone in my party dined on the RW Menu, but I did, as did my mother and God-mother. 

For starters when I checked into Yelp the restaurant offered a free drink, including their house wines. I opted for the white, a Chardonnay that was decent, but not anything surprising. My father ordered the house Merlot, also a decent varietal, but nothing special. However, they do have an extensive wine menu that I glazed over seeing numerous choices from France, Spain, and the like.

Next - for appetizer my family opted for two orders of the alligator tail, one grilled with a spicy seasoning and the other deep fried. The alligator was surprisingly tender and had the consistency of a medium-well done steak. I like both versions, but preferred the grilled with the extra spice.

We were also served tasty, warm rolls and hush puppies with honey-butter. AMAZING hush puppies. Deep-fried to perfection, and a lovely spicy taste... I think there must have been some jalapenos added to the batter. But these were quite addictive.

As for my order, I started with the Cashew Vinaigrette Salad- Mixed Greens In A Spicy Cashew Vinaigrette Topped With Red Onions, Red Peppers & Crispy Wontons. The addition of red onions and red peppers to this salad made all the difference, adding spiced-up flavors one does not typically have in a garden varietal salad. The crispy wontons add a very nice mix to the mouth-feel and are kind of like a ""better'"" version of a crouton.

Next up, main course: N'Awlins Seafood Delight- Blackened Catfish Over Rice With A Rich & Creamy Alfredaux With Shrimp. This was a delicious, creamy main course. The catfish was main star, having a flaky grilled exterior, and a melty white fish center. And it was a good portion. Shrimp were plentiful as well, no skimp on the shrimp here. The alfredaux pulls everything together, making you believe you are in New Orleans... not South Las Vegas.

Lastly, dessert. Homemade Bread Pudding Served With Bourbon Sauce. Their bread pudding was certainly... different. It is a firm cake, dense. The bourbon sauce here is served cold and it is a white sauce (some places offer brown). I was not a fan. I was expecting a warm bread pudding and a warm white sauce. The was neither. But. It wasn't *bad* and had a very NUTMEG flavor to it. It is just different, that is all.

Overall - Service was prompt, genuine and our server was congenial to our large group. Food overall was as expected with pops of surprises and flourishes of creativity from whoever is chef here. I would certainly come back.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,5,2,5,YwZZT-jfQnwpFMtFytDkpg

I went on a Friday evening with a party of 4, so the place was just beginning to fill when I arrived. I totally understand the culture of Las Vegas does not lend itself towards hospitality or courtesy, but when you attempt to have a Southern style restaurant, you need to take the expectations of your clientele into consideration. 

Aside from the lack of hospitality, the food was good and had great presentation. I am vegetarian, so there is not much to choose from. I had the Garden District Spinach Salad with no bacon or egg. The full sized salad was a nice dinner portion, but I probably could have gotten away with the half after eating bread and hushpuppies. The Hushpuppies had a nice amount of spice with good texture. 

The best part of this restaurant was the beignets.

My family and I celebrate every holiday by cooking a large meal at home, who cooks those meals? The ladies! So I get an email from Rhythm Kitchen letting us know they are serving a great buffet of Alaskan Snow Crab Legs, Jambalaya, Fried Shrimp, Beignets, Blackened Chicken Pasta, etc... for the holiday, and it said they accepted reservations. When you have a family of 11 with a range of ages from 5-92, you need reservations! I made a 5pm Reservation originally for 12!
 
A lot of folks may call me picky. I was as cool as a cucumber on this evening when it came to service. I know it was a holiday, we were a large party, and we had kids. But our table was not ready. Why have reservations? As far as our ""service team."" Our server ignored us, argued with my guest, forgot items when asked on multiple occasions....When the incident with my Grams happened my Mother's Day card fell on the ledge above their dining room. I asked a staff member for help, thinking maybe things fall sometimes, she brushed us off!!

There were few edible options on the buffet. One of which were the crab legs, BUT, they weren't split. I have a 5 and 8 year old. I couldn't eat for 30 minutes because 1) We had to wait for crackers(my sister literally asked and tested them on how long it would take to get, I finally gave up, got up, and went to their service door to ask someone) and 2) I had to feed them. All of the other hot food items were dried up or looked down right dangerous to eat. Dessert items consisted of sliced fruit and a banana cake. The cake was the only other item I ate that night. Our party of 11 never spotted a beignet once. 

The staff were impolitely cleaning and making a ruckus around us before the buffet was supposed to be over. The hot food, besides crab, wasn't refilled once after we were sat. We had until 7 per their email. Just so many little things made our dinner so completely horrible. When it came time for use to wanna get out we were held hostage. I had to again, go to the service door to have our card ran to get released from the Heck Hole those people call Rhythm Kitchen.

I told him to take his time.  Well about 3 mins later I get a steak that was a charred mess.  It did not resemble a steak in any way, shape, or form. I touched the end and it crumbled off.  Yes, crumbled. The worst steak ever.  I didn't ask for a new one since I was in a group.  But I will say this. I will never, ever, go to this place and pay for a meal..Undoubtedly the worst ever.  The rest of the food was fairly decent.  But this place should NEVER advertise itself with the word steak in the title.  I wish I would have kept the jumbalaya. At least it looked edible.  And to be fair, it looked like the person next to me who ordered the steak had a decent one.

Suddenly the service was 100% better, but it shouldn't take a threat of a negative review to make the level of service excellent. You should treat each customer like they could possibly review your establishment. Our waiter did his best to make things right and I appreciated it.

The ambiance is really cool...It's what you would imagine at a spot in N'awlins. White table cloths, up stairs downstairs and southern hospitality included. The prices are reasonable and they had a great menu selection. I had bbq chicken pizza the first night I was there with a lapu lapu cocktail. Both were delicious, but be warned...they don't pour light on the drinks! The drink was fantastic and I left with a wonderful buzz from one drink! That's rare for me..LOL! My husband had all you can eat shrimp for $25. There are 4 different varieties and he had 3 of the four. He had the fried, lemon pepper and I believe bbq...he said that they were all very good, the fried was his favorite. These were good sized shrimps too! He really enjoyed his food.

The second time we went, I had a drink...can't remember the name of it though, but it was berry flavored and delicious...my husband and I shared buffalo wings...Omg..they were sooooo good! They had lots of flavor, but not overpowered by the taste of vinegar like most wings I've had...they had a bit of crispiness to them too... Best wings I've had to date! I totally look forward to going back for the wings...

The service was fast and friendly both times...we felt totally welcomed...loved the R&B selection of music that they play in the lounge. There is also outdoor patio seating for Happy Hour. I'll likely come here every time I am in town.

If they don't want walk-in customers on Crab nights, maybe they should state ""reservations only"" somewhere instead of having your hostess chastise your customers. 

So we get seated and were promptly greeted w/bread and water and Chris our server, whom we've had before. He was excellent as always, took our order, which included a salad and crab. Out comes the crab and the salad like 10 minutes later....and no bucket for the crab shells. We had to ask Chris for a bucket, we noticed every other table w/crab had a bucket. No biggie except we had crab shells everywhere until Chris got us a bucket after we asked. We did notice that several other customers got the ""reservation lecture"" from the Hostess. Had we not had a Groupon, we would definitely had gone somewhere else, besides the service from Chris, I can't really say there was anything spectacular enough to bring us back, especially not the lecture. 

I've worked as a Hostess before, and they are the first point of contact for customers in the restaurant, the two girls working at Rhythm Kitchen last night were neither friendly or welcoming and would seriously be a deterrent to us coming back, especially if coming back w/o a reservation involves a lecture everytime.

4958489,2013-09-03,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"We had a Groupon to Rhythm Kitchen that was about to expire, so we made the drive.  Very glad we did, and we will 100% return.  The bread basket is gratis and contains a roll and some hush puppies.  These were fine, not the best bread basket we've had, but it was good.  To start, we had the alligator, 1/2 and 1/2, which is both fried and blackened.  The meat was cooked well, the breading was crispy and light and the blackening seasoning was very flavorful.  I hadn't eaten alligator in many years, and this was exactly how I remembered it.  This was a winner.  We also tried the clam chowder, which had some great flavor and lots of ingredients (clam, potatoes, etc), but the base was a little thin for my taste.  The soup goes very well with the hot sauce on the table.

To eat, I had the N'awlins Seafood Delight, which is 3 good sized pieces of blackened catfish over rice served with shrimp and a Cajun alfredo sauce.  This was serviceable, but I could have used a lot more heat given that it's a Cajun dish.  The sautéed vegetables were good, and you get quite a large side.  I didn't dislike my entrée, but I doubt I order it again.

My wife had the filet blackened with stuffed lobster.  You get to choose any side, and she selected macaroni and cheese.  This is made with truffle oil, and I think the chef is a little heavy handed with the truffle.  It was overpowering and pushed the cheese flavor to the background.  It's a good sized dish with a nice crust on top, but the truffle oil overpowered it.

The steak was cooked to a perfect rare, and it was FANTASTIC.  The combination of the blackened seasoning with the steak was a homerun.  I am not a filet guy (I prefer ribeyes) but I had several bites of this steak.  It was juicy despite the lack of fat in filets and it was seasoned perfectly.  It was blackened but not burnt in any spots.  It's in the running for best filet I've ever eaten, as well as best steak I've had off the Strip.  I cannot wait to return to try the 22 ounce bone in ribeye with blackened seasoning.  

The stuffed lobster was good, but the crab cake was a little sweet for us.  The lobster was cooked very well and it's a large tail for the price.  We would order the lobster again, but I doubt we get it stuffed next time.

Service was excellent, refills were brought quickly and trips to the bar were also very short.  Lana, our server, was attentive without being overbearing, and had some great suggestions for us.  Very friendly and she allowed us to relax instead of hurrying us out the door.  

We will definitely return, it may be a few miles from us in Henderson, but it's easy on and off the 215.  Next time, the blackened ribeye....",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,4,1,4,6YYYoUw-qz0kJifzyoLwZA

4974805,2011-02-20,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"I guess you could call it our first official date PB (post-baby).  It was a last minute decision to check out Rhythm Kitchen on a Friday night, especially since we drive by it all the time and have to wonder what it's like.

We walked in to an elegant foyer and for a moment, I felt a bit under dressed.  There were two hostesses manning the front, one of whom I had the impression was the owner or manager.  With no reservations, we were easily seated at a table right by the pianist.  (They just added the pianist on a regular basis.)  It was really nice inside the dining room, and rather busy.  Despite the upscale feeling, there's a very casual crowd inside which works out great.  You can have a nice dinner out without the stuffiness.  

Since we were on a time limit, we ordered only entrees and waited for them to arrive.  In the meantime, a basket of hush puppies and one bread roll with sweet butter arrived at our table.  (We are a party of two, only one bread roll?)  Nonetheless, we enjoyed the piping hot hush puppies and the warm bread. 

There was a bit of lag time as we waited for our food and I was under the impression that it felt like it was a bit understaffed.  It looked like there were three waiters, which had me concerned with how long it would take our food to come out since the wait staff definitely took their time with each customer (getting drink orders, getting apps started, explaining items on the menu, etc.).  It gave us a chance to enjoy the lovely music though.  

Our food did arrive by someone else and the Husband chose Seafeast Platter ""Combination of catfish fillets, oysters, fried shrimp and cold boiled shrimp."" ($17.79) It came with one side, and he chose a Baked Potato with his.  He appreciated that it was loaded with butter, sour cream, green onions, and cheese.  The deep fried catfish and oysters were pretty good, and not overly oily or fatty.  It had a good batter on it.  His platter also came with their chow chow relish.

I chose the Grilled Cajun Scallops ""With andouille sausage."" ($17.99)  It came with two sides, and I chose the Baked Potato and Sauteed Mushrooms.  The scallops were on a kabob stick (about 9 large scallops), along with sausage, bell peppers, and onions.  Rice and gravy sat underneath my protein.  The scallops were pretty good, not overcooked at all.  More on the rare side, which I prefer.  And the mushrooms were cooked very nicely too.  I pretty much devoured my dinner (as a customer noted from a nearby table).  This same customer also commented on how delicious her crab chowder and deep fried alligator was.  She even offered some to us!

Since we were in a rush, I quickly asked our waiter for our check and let him know we had a baby waiting.  He seemed like he understood our urgency, but took the time to clear our table first.  (Yes, I know he was doing his job, but I think he missed the point that we needed to go and now!)

The manager/owner took the time to talk to us and let us know about the bar/lounge connected next door and their happy hour.  She also mentioned that they have banquet facilities upstairs and there's a live band that will be coming on a regular basis as well.  (I think there's a cover charge.)  She also mentioned joining their email list so we could find out what entertainment was going on.

Overall, we both were pleasantly surprised and delighted with our experience at Rhythm Kitchen.  One would have a better experience if you can enjoy a leisurely dinner instead.  Yes, it might be a bit pricey depending on what you get, so it helps that they are in the Entertainment Book.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,15,10,4,Vgn2lydoxXS7S1k1_pgOSg

It was time again for my friend to come into Vegas and continue our tradition of eating at Rhythm Kitchen.

We dined on 6/26/14 at 9pm
We had our same waiter from all of our previous visits.
The one that goes by Dr. Bob
Always a great waiter. Very friendly and great to talk to.

This time around we got freshly made, just out of the deep fryer hush puppies.
The waiter also brought us out a brand new bread that the cook had made.
The waiter mentioned it was probably a sour dough of some type.
Whatever it was, it was really good.
And since the owner frequently checks all of the Yelp reviews, I would like him to note that this new type of bread is very welcome in future visits.

I once again had the blackened chicken pasta, which is always a great dish.
Chicken cook perfectly and great pasta with the Cajun Alfredeaux sauce.

My friend had his usual favorite, the filet mignon. The waiter made sure that the filet was cooked perfectly and that it had it's proper rest period before serving (5mins)

Just another fantastic dining experience.

I guess they were out of season as the 2 tails were $59...a bit steep but the $50 groupon took a nice $25 off.  I think blackened is the way to get lobster now as this was probably the best lobster I can remember having in a long while. The tails were cooked perfectly and the blackened pepper flavor hit the spot.

I was in a toss up over giving 3 or 4 stars because there were a few low points to the meal despite the lobster being top notch...

-The truffle mac and cheese lacked any kind of truffle flavor whatsoever, not even a hint.

-The side of vegetables were way overcooked

-The bread in the basket was so hard I clanked it on my dinner plate and it was like a glass hitting glass sound. 

-The butter that went with the bread had an odd texture where I doubt it would soften up if it were left out an hour as though it had been dunked in liquid nitrogen. I think they were preformed into little rose pats and then thrown in the freezer (last month).

-It was prime dinner time and I only counted 3 other tables dining in this large room which meant you could hear other people's conversation.

-This last one really gets me. I understand if gratuity is added to parties of 6 or more. But if it's just 1 or 2 people dining, I'm not sure why gratuity of 18% needs to be added. I was actually going to tip 20% on the bill prior to the discount because the service was good and the lobster was delicious (so their insurance against me being a cheapskate actually saved me $1.00)...but I just find it insulting that the waitress needs to take out an insurance policy on her tip because I came in using a coupon...oh this guy might be cheap, I better hit the insurance button. I probably would have given 4 stars if not for this.

Let's start off with the atmosphere.  Very nice, date night / romatic setting with the mood lighting and candles.  Def wine appropriate.  The service was also exceptional....my wine glass was filled as was the water and misc.  Friendly and attentive.

Now to the important stuff...the food!

Easily the best hush puppies I've had.  Packed with flavor with a tiny bit of spice...very very good.  

Went with the alligator and the crab topped bread bowl gumbo.  Gator was nice and tender, good tasting as well as the sauce.  The gumbo was AMAZING.  Wonderful flavors exploding in your mouth, with nice chunky pieces of crab thrown on the top, making a beautiful and delicious presentation.  If you do not try the crab gumbo, you missed out of the reason I will come back here.

I tried the platter for dinner.  It came with fried catfish, oysters, shrimp, frog legs, and cold shrimp.  The catfish was good, but I've had better.  Wish it was less breaded...same can be said with the oysters.  The fried shrimp was one of the best I've ever had...just packed with flavor and was still juicy and not overdone like most.  Never had frog legs before...tasted like a chicken with slight saltwater aftertaste...kind of fishy.  It was pretty good, but I can't compare it since I've never tried it.

Was way too full with all the above, so couldn't try to stuff dessert if I tried.

The alligator is a little chewy and the blackening seasoning they use isn't my favorite by any stretch.  Other than that, it has a wide variety of authentic offerings of good quality.

The inconsistency in service is what kills me about this beautiful restaurant.  Every time I go, the servers are just off with their timing.  The sequence of service is off.  The entree plops down right on top the appetizer so you can't enjoy them because your rushed, then you wait 30 minutes for another glass of wine or the check.  

One experience that I'll never forget is Mardi Gras.  Being a Louisianan, I can totally appreciate how busy Mardi Gras is, so waiting was not an issue at all.  I made a reservation for a party of 8.  Upon arrival, they told me it would be a wait, which I completely understand, due to the holiday and the size of the party.  We decided to go upstairs have a cocktail and listen to the live music.  15 minutes passed, and I went down to check and nothing.  45 minutes passed, nothing yet.  I again went down, and the older lady at the counter said it still wasn't ready.  I advised the lady that this was disappointing as we had reservations.  I'm a hotel manager on the Strip, so service is important, and told her that I didn't understand the lack of service or concern for the fact that my party had been waiting for over an hour even though we had a reservation.  Her response was, having a reservation just means that you'll get served this evening, not that it will be at any specific time, and that they can't turn away walk-in business so you have to wait. This is not a joke....I know...craziest thing I've ever heard.  I asked why they asked for a time when they took my reservation and why they didn't think to notify me upon making the reservation that they followed this bizarre service practice.  And how exactly does making a reservation differentiate me from a walk-in that is guaranteed service?  I used to manage a Cajun Restaurant that also specialized in seafood and steaks in Louisiana, and I was shocked.  Not just by this terrible protocol, but also by the distain and tone in which she spoke to me.  Even Louisianans don't have backwoods practices like this that are inhospitable.  When I asked to speak to the manager, she advised me that she was THE OWNER.  After that, I figure what's the point.  I gave up and went upstairs to enjoy my friends and the great live music.  We waited a total of an hour and 45 minutes.  By the time we got a table, the all you can eat crawfish and crab were almost all gone, so the serving that we got was mostly cold, broken, and small.

If you want a pretty authentic Cajun meal in a nice environment, but don't mind the shotty service and poor management, it's not a bad venue.  Otherwise its a great concept, but doesn't seem like they are very experienced in simple principles of restaurant management.  I used to go once a month or so, now I only go when my friends whom I've taken there request to go with me again.  I prefer the service at Lola's even though it's not as nice a place.",HnSXyElF3N1nwtHm4yMO_A,1,0,2,TvQ59_y8AS-ysYM0wgcrag

The building is huge and the ambience was nice but definitely trying too hard to be fancy instead of just being New Orleans. The Sazerac was watered down but the charbroiled oyster appetizer was good. The Caeser salad was to be expected and a good portion for a half salad. Next up was the Atchaya half catfish-half crawfish étouffée which was delicious and flavorful which left me bitter about eating the worst jambalaya of my life. It tasted like they dumped the box out and didn't mix the spices since I managed to get them all in one big powdered bite. I ordered it with chicken and shrimp but it came without shrimp and the worst andouille sausage ever, seriously it tasted like a ballpark hot dog with spices. Tried to finish it off on a high note with banana fosters but they used little to no (betting it was none) Myers rum to caramelize the bananas which were obviously green as they had absolutely no sweetness to it. Service was fine, no issues other than slightly slow.",l4Wne4b7nQVCAMWpfjnj9A,1,0,2,b7krRSz6mQ5Kg-yxonkTfg

- Nicely situated off the 215/decatur exit. Amazingly large building 
- Can't use Yelp Check-in for free drinks. ""Only one coupon at a time, now."" HAHA. Taiga Modern Groupon hooked it up THO! 
- You can use Groupon for AYCE! ""Camera watching, can't share."" haha, meaning both have to get the AYCE Crab, $32. Figured that's a similar price as a Bellagio/Bacchannal so we passed. 
- Free bread basket. 2 Dinner rolls/6 Hush puppies. Hot but stale. Butter tasted like whipped cream. 
- Appetizer: Spinach and artichokes topped with BBQ crawfish and mozzarella cheese. I enjoyed the crawfish with the dip, but compared to Red Lobster it didn't have the same rich consistency as theirs. Some chips were stale others were crispy. Somewhat of a hit/miss. 
- Jambalaya: Andouille sausage sauteed with onion and peppers in a spicy canjun sauce. Topped with rice and served with shrimp. 8 shrimp. Too dry and not spicy. For tasty Cajun Jambalaya go to Costa del Sol. That packs a true punch in flavor. 
- Crescent city pasta: Linguini tossed with crawfish, shrimp, scallops, mushrooms and spinach in a Cajun lemon herb garlic butter. 4 Shrimp. Excellent taste! Loved the amount of crawfish. High recommendation!

-  Lighting too dim for my taste. haha. Dim red...

       - Fried foods - Crisp exterior with juicy insides. Not too oily either.
       - Price - A little on the pricier side, but you get what you paid for.
       - Shrimp size - Large to Jumbo.
       - Decor - Classy Cajun feeling. Good date place.
**Price**
       - $50.00 for two.
**Ordered**
       - Rhythm Kitchen Platter - The fried items are very crisp and not too oily
              - Catfish - Comparable to Hush Puppies but not as tasty as Catfish Alley.
              - Fried Oysters - First time having fried oysters. They were fan-freakin'-tastic
              - Fried Shrimp, Cold Boiled Shrimp - The shrimp were a lot larger than I expected and delicious.
              - Frog Legs - Never really liked frog legs. These were a tad bit on the hard side.
       - Jambalaya (Lunch Portion) - Very good. Similar to the Jambalaya and Elephant bar, but with more ingredients.
       - Fried Seafood Po Boy (Shrimp) - Six hefty shrimp in a po boy with steak fries. Way better than the tiny shrimp po boys from Sweet Factory. (Other options to fill the po boy: alligator, oyster, or catfish.)
**Recommendations**
       - Pretty elegant and scrumptious place for a night out.

Oysters on the 1/2 Shell: flown in daily from The Gulf, these succulent big-as-your-palm beauties are served with a fresh, sharp horseradish and a cocktail sauce. I was astounded to find that they served Shiner Bock on tap, and the Texan in me just had to go for a cold one and oysters.

N'awlins Delight (blackened catfish in a subtle cream sauce with shrimp): oh my goodness, pure heaven. The flavorful sauce paired with the blackening was absolute perfection, with the fish moist and flaky. Served with rice and al dente veggies, it was a delight for the palate.

Étouffée: Wow! A beautifully dark musky roux was absolute perfection. Crawfish and/or shrimp, both are a suburb addition. And along with the freshly made French rolls... I have to say it again... Wow!

Our waiter came by, quickly, asked if we wanted any drinks...we both were parched and just wanted water.  I think since we only ordered water the waiter wasn't very happy.. we were then greeted by an amazing spirited waitress.  She said she was in training, I wish I had got her name, but she was NOT new to this industry. She was wonderful, attentive, she told us about the specials, which the other waiter did not, he asked if we had any questions about the menu, but never mentioned specials.  We both ordered 2 of the specials. I had the Lobster dinner special and my man had the steak special.  The dinners were great. My lobster was cooked to perfection.  My man said his steak was delicious.  Our waitress was very attentive, made us feel very at home. She convinced us to save room for dessert. She said she wanted to try here skills at the table side flambe...so we opted for the strawberry Flambe that came with shortbread and ice cream. We told her we would only order if she did it for us. The other waiter kept coming by and trying to be attentive but she had beat him every time. He ran around like a chicken with his head cut off.  He was so distracting.

5466099,2011-09-03,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"Before I get into this review, let me preface that I will try this place again.  I was hoping for a little more from my first experience here, but I must see if what I am looking for actually exists here.

First off, let me compliment a big thing: The outside of the building looks great.  It looks like something out of New Orleans, even if it is a standalone building.  I've found architecture in Vegas to generally be incredibly boring, unless it's on the Strip or in a residential area before the 1990's.  Thank you for actually trying to BE something instead of the bland store front.

I've been wanting to try the place for weeks, as I am well-versed in Cajun food from my Grandmother, my numerous visits to the French Quarter, and my own cooking experience in a restaurant.  So I know what the food is supposed to taste like.

But the food here was bland.  Semi spicy, yet bland, and I've no idea how they managed to pull that off, seeing that it's such a contradiction in terms.

We ordered the alligator tail for an appetizer, and I had to try their gumbo.  The alligator was decent enough overall, but the gumbo was missing... something.  It drove me crazy trying to figure out what it was, even to the point of thinking about it on the drive home, before I went to bed, and when I got up the next morning.  I had actually brought some home, and I still tried to figure it out, to no avail.  It was mildly spicy, but didn't have that rich roux flavor.

The service was fine and the atmosphere was fine, so I had no complaints with either.  I was concerned that I was a little underdressed, but viewing the table next to me put those concerns at ease.

Tricia put it best: They need someone who better understands the food, as Cajun is a very different beast that either people love or simply don't get.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't ""bonafide"", either.  They definitely need a more robust roux, one that makes the sweat stand out on your face and your nose sniffling a little.  Anyone who has attempted Cajun cooking knows that outside ""The Trinity"", the roux has to represent as well.

5507975,2016-01-21,1,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"We had a Groupon and some errands, so dinner at Rhythm Kitchen was our play. Afterward, I will say that the Groupon lessened the blow this place had on us. We arrived relatively early in their flow - there were 3 other tables when we arrived and 3 more were seated while we dined. The place looks well appointed and the servers are attentive. It is not overly decorated and nothing about it says southern, Cajun, creole, bayou or Louisiana. It could pass for a steak house, Italian place, upscale American or even Greek. There is no atmosphere to it. Our server took great care of us, flowing by every once in a while to check on us and asking how things were. 
I wish I could have really told him, but since words like bland, plain and pedestrian would be used, there's not much he could have done. After reading other reviews, I am convinced the chef/owner is not there on Wednesday nights. It is sad that caliber of food comes out of the kitchen. We had such high hopes.
We first received the bread basket. While the yeast bread was good, we weren't much on the hush puppies. They were a bit heavy and not much punch to them. That said, we know hush puppies are an individual thing. Not everyone likes all of them. They just weren't for us. The weird thing was the butter served with it. I am not certain what the tang is. It almost seemed like it had been mixed with something like sour cream, but the second pat didn't taste like the first and it was then that it seemed like they use unsalted butter...maybe that was it. We started our meal with the crawfish tail appetizer. This was quite tasty. The tails are small, but you just eat three or four at a time. They are lightly dusted and fried.
Since we wanted to try a selection of what they offered, I ordered the Seafest Platter and the wife ordered the Big Easy Sampler. Overall, both of these were very disappointing. The catfish fillets were good, but did taste like small pond fish. They had a nice crust and were only slightly greasy. The breading on the oysters were lacking in flavor. The oysters themselves were good, but the little wads of crust took away from them. There was nothing special about the fried shrimp. As a matter of fact they were no better than any other fired shrimp anywhere else. Same with the cold boiled shrimp - I would also make the observation that placing cold shrimp among just fried items is not the best idea (one piece was actually still a bit frozen in the middle). The alligator bits were very tasty. They were the stars of both our dishes. The frog legs did not rise to the same level. While they were good, they were only passible. The demons of the dinner were the crab cakes. I have never had anything so distasteful ever. I am not sure what they were going for with those, but the sour, bitter and basically foul taste ruined me on these dishes. I actually had to spit out the piece I had cut off and absolutely could not eat any of it. I cannot think of any word to describe the horrid taste of these crab cakes. The icing on the cake was the beans and rice. Plain white rice and bitter beans - they almost tasted burned. I couldn't even finish those.
Let me state, I grew up in the south, both along the coast and inland. I have fished, gigged, plucked, trapped, netted and caught most of these (except for the alligator) as well as cooked them. That said, the items we had for dinner were nowhere near what one would expect from such a restaurant. Plain, bland and just not good. We've had better flavor from a bag of Zatarain's. Then I check reviews and see that our meal items look nothing like any pictures posted by other reviewers. *this must be how they get back at folks who use Groupons. This is why we feel the chef is off on Wednesdays. We can't believe he would let this stuff be served.",QD3eqZPXh4Ft9rfdRjULFA,2,0,2,Kc1Zn6a_i_NUBEibn3hJEg

5550113,2011-01-05,1,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"Overall, the food is very hit and miss here.  What's really sad, is all the misses were the New Orleans (cajun/creole) food.  I'm not sure what the owners are doing here but they need to hire someone that has experience cooking food from Louisiana, because it is obvious they don't.

Service was very good.  This isn't an issue.  

Food that was good was really good.  The hot wings come with one of the most delicious sauces I have tasted, made with Crystal.  These are breaded (a cardinal sin on hot wings), but so moist and delicious I didn't care.  The NY steak my husband ordered was cooked so well it could easily compete with the best steakhouses on the strip.  It was charred well on the outside, and delicious on the inside, as if they let it sit the perfect amount of time to keep the juices in the meat.  I wanted this dish much more than the one I ordered.

The bad food was really bad.  Unforgivably bad.  I ordered the fried oysters, one of my favorite dishes ever, and it was just breading and hardly no taste of the juicy oysters.  I think they chopped these up which horrified me.  I ordered some fresh steamed broccoli, and it was mushy and flavorless.  What a waste of good broccoli.  My husband had fries with his steak and it was the cheap, frozen steak fries you can get from Ellis Island or any of those other low cost places.  

With a restaurant.com certificate our food was about 38 bucks, and that included beer.  I am unsure if I would come here again, they would have to make some serious improvements on cooking some of the food before I will.  My husband still talks about how good the steak was so we may come back.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,3,3,vJG_oQn-PodDUgOTcs2iLw

My two children ordered the turkey dinner which was complete with turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and even a slice of pie.

My husband ordered the filet - oscar style - which includes a crab cake on top with Bernaise sauce, which was out of this world. The filet was tender and juicy, and the crab cake was large and perfectly cooked (no skimpy crab here - it was full of large chunks of crab meat). 

I ordered the Cajun platter with catfish, shrimp, and crab legs (hey, you only love once, right?). Everything tasted delightful, and was crispy - not soggy - like some other restaurants. Our waitstaff ensured our experience was one of a kind, and my daughter even compared the ambiance and food to a certain Disney movie involving a frog-prince.

Why charge for kids who are clearly below the age limit or not even ask to be sure. So the Included gratuity is higher? For 3 people? For a buffet? No where does it state in the fine print for this gratuity included on your website. Just would have liked to have been aware. Is this a usual practice here? We dine here regularly and have never been automatically charged for 3. The meal offerings certainly did not surpass my anticipations. Catfish was all breaded, a couple of pieces had actual fish.

See Tuesday night's are crab night all you can eat.  Now I am allergic  to shellfish so when we go I order the rib eye (Yes I am also very picky on what I will eat) so it worked out perfectly for us. Now they changed it to a sea food buffet upstairs from the main dinning room, They are charging 39.95 per person, I asked them what they had on the buffet to see if there was ANYTHING I would eat. Well there isn't! I asked if I could order off the main menu and pay for what I ordered ( I wasn't going near that buffet) to which I was told, "" you would have to pay the 39.95 to sit up there and the additional money for any thing I ordered off the menu""! The other option was to sit downstairs but the crab legs wouldn't be all you can eat,!

The ribs are truly fall of the bone type of ribs. And when you order the next set, they are just as good as the first time around. It truly is an art to find ribs this good in Las Vegas. The only place that comes close is probably Balboa Pizza/Ribs in the District at Green Valley. 

Atmosphere is cozy and dark inside like many old NOLA type restaurants but the service is variable depending on who you get. The first time we were there, our waiter was virtually non existent. However, on the second visit, our server was on top of everything and quite attentive.

Went there on a weekend for dinner around their opening time (5pm), there was only 2 tables in there. So we got seated right the way.

They bring you a basket of hush puppies right the way with sweet butter.... oh my...... move over the ""Hush Puppies"" restaurant... these are the best hush puppies I've had. They are not your typical fried corn meal batter. These are really flavorful and fill with some kind of stuffing and Jalapeno peppers. Nice intense flavor with a hint of spiciness. We had to get a refill of one more basket.

For starters we ordered Grilled Cajun Scallops as appetizer $10.29. They were really fresh and skewered with some vegetables and over some rice. But the Cajun flavor could be strong though. 

For entrees we ordered the all you can eat fried catfish fillets for $13.95 and Jambalaya for $14.29

The fried catfish were really tasty, the batter was seasoned just right so it's very crispy and flavorful. And these fillets are big pieces, and it's a real piece of fillet, not the fake small pieces other restaurants usually serve. And it's all-you-can-eat.... for $13.95! Can't beat that. They will bring you two more pieces each time when you get a refill and it's really fast. I think catfish is one of their popular items so they always have fresh batch coming out.

The Jambalaya was OK, the Cajun flavor was not as strong on this. And not really spicy. Maybe that's why the have a bottle of Louisiana's Hot Sauce on each of the tables.

Really attentive and excellent service. The atmosphere is romantic and quiet.  They also have a bar on the other side. But if you want to enjoy a romantic atmosphere, sit on the restaurant side. They also have a balcony upstairs and it appears to be another bar/ party room with a stage. It was closed when we were there, but maybe you can book it for private parties.",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,0,0,4,C6VnHApqmT-G3i70rkxl1Q
5890975,2012-07-30,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"Went for my birthday,May 28th. What a disappoint. Did not want to complain,
Because it was my birthday in front of my family.

 They were only 5 tables in the restaurant. Bad service, brought wrong dressing for salad, food was cold. Service was lacking. Could understand if busy. Never saw the server even for refills, finally at the end of the meal.
WILL NEVER RETURN,,paid way too much for bad service and cold food. Doesn't even deserve a star. 
Sent a email to the manager about my experience,never responded back. I guess you just do not care about the guest experience.

Remember that Las Vegas has many restaurants, this is one that I will not recommend to anyone. I am in the food service industry and talk to many people about where to eat in the city.",xfFbRSH1T609k_aR_D99FQ,5,0,1,TiBel3rCUwk0R1bfzll7qg

The bartenders know how to mix a drink and the bar food is tops.  The happy hour is daily (4-6:30) and is the best in LV.

The restaurant is also excellent.  Can't beat the service, attentive without becoming part of the dinner party, the atmosphere is elegant and the food fantastic.  We've enjoyed the shrimp creole, salmon, prime rib and most of the bar food.  Go here and go often.

BTW, the desserts are also very good.",c2ycyOWS2kXqJepFQeQHYw,0,0,5,XpKr3m-1Q4wc56Th1MbjnQ

Sat at the bar this time instead of restaurant.  Service was quick and friendly at first .. but we finished out drinks and food and waited awhile for the bartender to return and  ask if we wanted another round.  The bartender was polite and friendly.  The food was good and the martinis awesome ..however the idea that the bartenders have to set up water at each table that arrives is ridiculous, and really slows down the pace of the service.  Everything was great except for the service timing.",x5_8fVWAR1hyS61_Ai4l1Q,1,0,3,U2QDFYmo_x79i2mfKmYfRA
5937238,2015-04-10,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,I dinned here last night and had  both good and bad experiences.  The bar staff was great..mt drink was the best however when we moved to the dining room im sorry to say the service was apathetic and we were treated as an afterthought.  Our server acted like we were a bother to him: no introduction no compassion no hospitality.  I didn't realize that bread wasvto be offered until I looked around and ALL the tables except ours had bread. He ran by and SLAPPED the desert menu on our table without a word! And we were the first ones there!! For the prices and supposed ambiance we should have been treated better. Also the hostess took a call as she was seating us making us stand around. Again we were THE ONLY ONES in the dining room!! The food was good but with service like this it is NOT worth spending Your hard earned money only to be treated with apathy and disdain.

5950179,2018-01-06,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,So I ate here last night for my anniversary.  And I have to say I will never be back it started off OK the place looks nice but then the weather does not like to listen to what you say so of course he got the mail wrong brought me the wrong entrée.   Then he acts like it was my fault so then I get the right entrée and the shrimp is raw and it's Fried shrimp.    So I let the manager know and they still charge me and he said sorry  for your experience.  With an arrogant attitude.  If you want bad service and nasty food this is the place for you.,qlwcD8jLPoT-Maa3tXqkxA,1,0,1,bdmn-4R2dOXt5lAZrS1mVw

This is a really great date night, after work, Friday night highlight type of place.  The vibe is so cozy yet spirited with locals who apparently frequent often.  The staff is super friendly and so professional with etiquette and proper manners. Small confession, I came to relax so I didn't even realize the bar menu wasn't their entire selection of goodies. They were so attentive to me hors d'oeuvres orders I never branched our for anything else because the selection was so satisfying.  Properly portioned, cooked to perfection, I didn't notice I was missing anything.  They treated me like I ordered a full course meal! One thing I can say, bringing New Orleans flavor to Las Vegas is a HIT! Surprise your sweetie for Valentines Day.  They make fresh Banana Foster at the table, flames and all!

Most of their recipes are only 5 bucks and are generous pours. Will is their  bartender and an awesome one at that. Very attentive, knows his craft and always with a smile. The food here is also great, I've had everything on the happy hour menu and my fave's are the firecracker ahi, baby back ribs, rhythm kitchen oysters and calamari. From their main menu the crab and also the étouffée. Superb! One warning though, if you order the Zombie, I suggest a designated driver... Enjoy!",MQspyjYtgbzpjAwBZTmqdQ,0,0,5,C8GxoO0rOPGRMk3Z_ZB5Kw
5965317,2013-07-06,0,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,"Been before, years ago. Trying it out one more time. Got disappointed with the gumbo, I seem to remember. 

Something different methinks. Riveted for me and the wife. And why, yes, we WOULD like an appetizer plate too!

The appetizers come out and are seasoned nice and tasty. A first for frog legs for her. I've had them before. Wifey was not too impressed. She did like the rest of the platter though. (As did I)

Rib-eyes come out. Huzzah! Big problem. Steaks weren't seasoned at all. AND the waiter seems busy (dunno why, restaurant isn't yet.). The sides were ok, we've both had a couple of bites of steak and secede we're done. 

Server comes back, asking if we wanted doggy bags. Nope.....kinda the worst tasting rib-eyes we've had. Surprisingly, he took the Borg straight off the bill, even though we didn't ask. 

If you want a rib-eye and you are in THAT area.....just go down to McMullans Irish pub. Almost never disappointed with their food.",N6EEjh_LOfmXDh-I13NKbQ,0,0,3,Mm5jTWngqUBzD3-g9EzU0w

I was soooo looking forward to some Cajun food, but I cannot comment on the food because I didn't get a chance to eat any. Our server was nice, but it was clear he never served before....and I am a waitress that works at a strip casino. I was with my husband and two friends, my friends arrived first and they told me they waited 25 min for their drinks and they were the only ones sitting at the bar. We sat at a table in the bar area and I told my waiter that I would like an order of alligator while we looked at the rest of the menu. It was ""All you can eat ribs"" night, and my hubby and friends wanted that but couldn't get it cause we were told they ran out. My friends said there wasn't anything else they saw that they wanted (picky eaters, definitely not the restaurant's problem) so they wanted to leave because they were already annoyed with they drink situation.  This is 20 min after we sat down, and still no app.  I told our waiter that we wanted to cancel the app order, and he looked at me like he had no idea what I was talking about. I totally understand messing up and forgetting an order, but he came back with our bill for our drinks and said that he didn't put the app order in cause he wanted the app to come out with our dinner. My husband asked him what was the point of having an APPETIZER if it came out with the dinner, the waiter just stammered and tried to make up an excuse. Disappointing.

Two of our group enjoyed plate after plate after plate (and yes, I could go on) of the all you can eat crab legs - apparently they enjoyed the crab legs.  I, myself, do not enjoy crab so I went with a shrimp pasta alfredo-type dish which I enjoyed greatly.
