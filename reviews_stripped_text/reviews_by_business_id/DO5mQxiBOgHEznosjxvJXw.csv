There was no rice just the salad and a lot of sauce that was really sweet. They should describe what comes in the plate on the menu. I could've done without the sweetness. Flavorful, but not the best I've had. Guacamole was okay. Chips were my favorite part. They were delicious and crispy. A little salty. The mango mousse was also extremely delicious. Highly recommend.

415143,2016-04-29,0,DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw,"I'm glad to see  the new mall owners are trying to make the Boulevard Mall a nice place again and Olvia's is a new, slightly upscale restaurant with unique food choices. You can enter from the street or inside the mall. Back in the day, there were a few restaurants in front of the mall. The Vineyard, which was one of the first buffets I've been to, as well as Panda Inn, which was the parent of Panda Express. But I digress... The drinks are limited and only two kinds of margarita: regular and cadillac which was $5 more. At least make the float of Grand Marnier visible on top or serve in a sidecar. Not a big difference between the two. Tacos are served during lunch only. We started out with guacamole. It was very fresh but could have used more seasoning. The salsa was fresh as well and was spiced well. I ordered the scallops. The whole dish, including the rice with corn, cilantro, chicharrones (I think) was seasoned perfectly. The scallops were large and juicy, cooked perfectly. Not to too spicy, but did have a nice kick. There was nothing left on the plate, not one piece of rice or kernel of  corn, it was that good. My friend had the swordfish, grilled and seasoned perfectly. It rested on top a sweet potato mash that was a great accompaniment to the meaty piece of fish. Next time I will try the ox tail enchiladas.",1JNqxJr8cDb689up53NGig,1,0,4,f7cfjhFWX7sVnWYBk0xAOA

Meanwhile a couple next to us had been seated after us and received their drinks (different server).

However, the food is the reason for the four stars.

My husband and I went to try Olivia's because he literally happened upon the place; it was political night though. There was an event, HIP. I'm all for politics, just not when I'm dining. We stayed though. There were three bartenders and the restaurant manager (an assumption) behind the bar, where we decided to sit and dine. They were all extremely attentive probably because they still wanted to make sure their regular patrons were getting tended to. I never had an empty drink!!

Now for the food, my favorite part. Husband got steak tacos, I got oxtail enchiladas. Both so incredible! Everything is fresh. Their verse sauce is homemade and the most delectable I've had so far in the Vegas valley. The oxtail meat was rich, however, a little greasy. Not bad though.

My husband's steak tacos must have been good because he didn't let me try any of them. The chunks of meat were size able for the small tacos. Overall, I'll go back. Minus the politics though.",mjbHPwsvpGkM83rqgVf_SQ,0,0,4,k-aCqbpDrezs135e5x8B-g

770071,2017-03-09,0,DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw,"Yesterday was our fourth visit,  Everything was different.  There were no more spicy dishes on the menu.  Beer menu was different.  Portions were smaller.  Prices were higher.  The bartender did a very fine job of trying to explain why the octopus was no longer on the menu although the prior visits they told us it was most popular,  They said it was a mistake and we could still get the dish,  The great thing was the dish was very spicy and delicious.  Now it was bland as a bowl of oats,  When we asked the manager he was condescending and pretty much undid everything the bartender did to meet our needs.  He was insulting and told us people complain about spicy and if we wanted it spicy we should have specifically told the cook that,  Well we ordered an item not on the menu that we had before that was spicy.... pardon me that we did not think to mention to the chef we wanted it the way it was before.  
The menu has changed repeatedly in the short time they have been open.  We thought this would be a place we liked and frequented but everything that made it special has been removed from the menu and I am not interested in being insulted by the manager again.  He actually acted annoyed and angry that we asked about the old menu.
Too bad.  Another place off our list.  Sad.",mRaT_pOsA2pK9nUjBVoEiw,6,2,3,qJ70aoFoBTgNFVJ4LBA_UQ

The sheer gumption of the location only amplifies my likeness of what is being done with this restaurant. 
The ascetic and ambience is a understated elegance. Clean lines and muted tones. The craft cocktails are brilliantly done, truly! I can't say this next line emphatically enough, the service is truly as good as you are going to find in absolutely any fine dining setting! Brilliant etiquette and attention to detail! 
Pupusas de chicharron is what were started with. Great flavor without being overwhelming. Perfectly executed and a wonderful segway to the entree. Very important to not dominate the dining experience with the appetizer. The star is the entree. 
Seared scallops and lechon asado with bitter greens and a sweet vinaigrette. The scallops were plated with a yellow rice. The scallops were amazing! Just as good as if I pulled them from the Chesapeake Bay myself! The pork shoulder was was elevated. Very tender with sweet pickled vegetables and guacamole. The wonderful composition of combining flavors from all over Latin America and marrying them together in very creative ways is not only creative but a breath of fresh air not only to the palette but to the area.

1788666,2017-01-03,0,DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw,"Ok, so I'm a little behind on posting this but I could not let this go as I overheard someone thinking about trying this establishment. I would like to concentrate on that word for a second ( at least in the business context). This is a new company trying to "" establish "" themselves so i would think they would do what they could to ensure customers return multiple times and more important, pass the word on so more patrons would visit their business in the future.  I came here during my lunch hour two weeks ago with some co-workers. We were sat immediately as it was not busy at all. We were originally sat at a booth and we asked to transfer to a table. We were accommodated and ordered our drinks. Our order was also taken very promptly. There were four of us there. We all ordered enchiladas ( three chicken and one shrimp if that matters ). I also ordered the fideo soup. Our server brought the soup within five minutes. I tasted it and did not enjoy it as it was not the fideo soup i am accustomed to. The server asked if there was a problem with the soup and I explained it was just not what i expected and he said he would remove it from the tab. I explained that was appreciated but unnecessary. I ordered it and didn't like it, and that was not their fault. He said not to worry about it. He would take care of it. So far so good but then the bad started to happen. We are now 20 minutes in and still have not received our meals. As the server walked by we asked him how much longer. He stated "" it is coming out right now. We make the food fresh so it takes a little longer "" . They proceeded to sit a table of eight and took their order. Another 10 minutes and still no food. They brought out a dish but it was not our order. He apologized and said he would be right back with our food. In the meantime, the table of eight received their food. Our server passed by three more times ( each time stating the food would be right out ) and the last time was as we were getting up to leave. He said it would be a ready in a second. I then said that our lunch hour was over. We started towards the door and saw that the server was complaining to the manager. He motioned towards us and they began to walk our direction. We paused at the door. I was then caught off guard as I was expecting an apology and maybe a "" ask for me and i will give you a discount at your next visit"" comment or at the very least an apology for wasting our time. The manager then looked directly at me and paused. I assumed he was waiting for a complaint but all i said was we have to leave because our lunch hour is over. He then shocked us all with a sarcastic remark stating "" What? Do you want an umbrella or something"" ( It was obviously raining that day )? We were all very surprised and left at that point. It is a shame because we were all very excited about trying this new option for lunch as we work close by. I cannot comment about the quality of food as we never received anything other than the soup. They did not even ask if we wanted to take the food to go as it was probably still not ready. If you decide to give this place a try, I recommend making sure you're not on a time crunch.",WmFQ5IXscbWFJ8l5B8SUDw,2,0,1,Hty0yE-nr0lP157YiAfcKA

The salsa tastes and looks like it was filtered through a sweaty tube sock.  They don't have any other types of salsa just the one. Even the Manager Frank is a douche canoe. He walks around with a holier than thou attitude wearing a jacket that can only be sported by Hugh Hefner if he wore burlap sacks. When he came by asking if everything was okay, we voiced the pico problem and he told us that ""it is what it is"" and told us not to come back!  We seriously were so disgusted by this place that we didn't even finish our meals. About the only thing that was worth their weight in nasty salsa was Maria, our waitress. She tried her best to make us happy but ultimately, when your hands are tied by a crap manager and crap food, you're not going to be able to do much. We actually felt sorry for her. Nobody should have to work in those conditions. She is sweeter than cotton candy and deserves more than a raise. Maria, if you are reading this, we salute you.

FOOD
Absolutely delicious! So much flavor and the presentation was astonishing. The portions were just right too! Pricing wasn't bad either. The quality of food is worth it. I wasn't disappointed with any of the things I've tried...from the appetizers to the entrees and of course the desserts!  

SCENE
The vibe in this place is awesome! It's upbeat and friendly. It's a perfect spot for large groups such as family gatherings or a romantic date for two! Other than that, it's comfortable, clean, and classy! 

STAFF
Besides the food, the staff was my next favorite thing about this place. I went with a large group of 8 for dinner and the staff there was very welcoming and inviting! They were so attentive and friendly and made sure that we were ok and satisfied. Rest assured, we were more than satisfied with their service. No matter how many questions we had or how big our orders were, they answered and took them with smiles! Thank you to our server, ROLANDO! He was awesome and provided the best customer service you can ask for. Along with the rest of the staff, they were overall amazing as well!

The food and the service can only be described as upscale, and even though it is more expensive than the local neighborhood, it is definitely worth the price. I had the carne Asada chile Relleno, and it was superb. They roasted the pepper and stuffed it with carne Asada, mushrooms and cheese, but skipped the usual batter and deep frying. This produced a much lighter, yet still hardy dish. The rice and accompanying sauce were excellent as well. 

The chips and salsa were obviously made on site, and the guacamole was some of the best I've ever eaten. I finished the meal with a wonderful flan that I know I'll have on my next visit. 

Service was excellent all around, and it's hard to believe a restaurant this nice is located in the (recently renovated) Boulevard mall. Make the trip; it's definitely worth it.",wmE7kY21MnhX2_wQdeKz7A,2,1,5,SfugVlu6qN9r2pRHR5iuIA

Awesome start with free home made chips and salsa. Chips weren't too oily and the salsa had just the right heat.

With the calamari appetizer ($10), I had expected typical fried calamari with some kind of dip, but instead we got nicely seared, chipotle seasoned rings and legs on a bed of arugula with citrus dressing.

The fish tacos ($11) were just so delicious, I almost have no words at this point. I have issues with cooked fish 99% of the time. But these tacos were unbelievably moist, flaky, and seasoned just right!

Out waiter was friendly, but did not tell us about happy hour beers so we paid full price for 5 drinks when we would have been even more ""happy"" with $2 Coronas.  Didn't know until we exited and saw the happy hour sign which was posted at the mall entrance, no sign at the regular entrance.  :(

Food was effortful but not that good.  We had the charbroiled octopus which had good texture but was a little too smoky and salty.  The waiter recommended the 2 for 1 shrimp cocktails, tasty but too much food considering we said we were originally going to split a ceviche.  

By the time the entrees arrived, lengua tacos and paella, we were already very full so we packed most of it to go.  The seafood on the paella was good quality, by charbroiled the same way as the octopus appetizer, so felt like a repeat.  The bed of rice with chorizo under the seafood was good.  Lengua tacos were fine.

There was a singer with a microphone singing Spanish songs the entire hour+ we were there, singing to different tables.  It was super loud and we couldn't have much conversation.  Seemed like too much entertainment for the 4 or 5 tables that were occupied in this large bar and dining space.  He was a good singer but it was just too loud.

They also have great drink specials. A great afternoon starts with some cocktails across the street at Champagne's, followed by a trip here for some more drinks and delicious food. 

There are also a lot of seafood options that I haven't tried yet, but am excited to eventually try. It seems like a higher end place when you go in, but don't let that discourage you. There are lots of reasonably priced and delicious options.

4843298,2016-08-29,0,DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw,"I know what you're thinking.  Mexican food at the Boulevard Mall... The Boulevard Mall???  But really, I don't give out four-star for nothing, so it may be worthwhile to go and here's why. 

First thing first, it has its own entrance from the outside to the restaurant.  That's always been one of my major concerns - what if the mall closes before I leave the restaurant...  I don't want to spend the night at any malls, let alone the Boulevard's.  

They also have an ""outside"" patio that's actually al fresco to the inside of the mall.  So, yes, you can people watch or be watched by the mall-goers.  Either way, it's awkward fun. 

And then there's the food.  It's a modern take on Mexican food that's not offensive.  I personally think most fusion or modern food is unnecessary and culturally offensive.  However, Olivia's straddles the fine line between creativity and preserving each dish's element of essential flavors.  

This is what I remember what we had that was good: steak tartare pizza, calamari and scallops.  Our server asked if we wanted any dessert and we declined.  A couple minutes later, he returned with a mango mousse - compliment of the house.  It was good and refreshing.  

We tried other dishes too but I cannot recall what they were anymore.  Old age may be to blame or the delicious margarita I had at Olivia's that's currently on my mind.  Either way, I intend to refresh my memory by going to Olivia's again.",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,2,2,4,qtP64qlxY5eqXgFS6Ky4ug

This is a newer place and it's kind of in an odd location. Hopefully for them, they'll survive due to the food. 

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: They only have 1 type of tequila. It isn't very good and it comes with a nice little hangover the next day. So beware. 

We ordered the guacamole--it was super good. Nice and full of avacado chunks. 
Shrimp and fish tacos -- I didn't have any, but my fiance said they were delicious. 
I ordered the Waygu beef steak. It doesn't come with tortillas, which it should. But I did order flour tortillas as a side. Mine was almost cold...but everyone else said their food was hot.
The steak itself was really good and cooked how I asked. It wasn't as tender as Waygu noramlly is. And it was a little overpowered by the cumin. So that was nice to taste the rest of the night. :|

From the beginning we were so impressed with the appearance of the restaurant and the attention we were given from the start. The food was amazing to say the least; he had a Cuban torta and I had the chicken burrito. We also ordered some drinks, a margarita and some preparadas and the drinks were just as great as the food, not too strong and just the right taste.

5509094,2017-02-06,0,DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw,The food was good and our waiter was great but he had so many tables and he was running around like crazy trying to keep everybody happy. It was a shame to see the manager walk up to him to tell him to bend over and pick up a napkin while he was so busy when that manager could have bent over himself! The staff all seems afraid and stressed out which stressed us out! They were really doing a good job but the manager was just walking around with a negative attitude and it really affected our experience in a bad way. Don't want to go back to a place where employees look scared at work! Fear management is a horrible thing to experience.,92rcHyakG93YAqEbmBhFBg,0,0,2,tmMmlBEr2LwubHThQWKpeA

This restaurant is in a really nice, large space.  Can easily have an office holiday party here.  Great bar area, with big screen tvs throughout the restaurant

Rolando was our waiter & was amazing! He & his busser were on point throughout our whole meal!

I could not have asked for better Latin food:

Grilled Calamari - I will never eat calamari another way again, grilled to perfection
Shrimp Nachos - Nachos are my one of my favorite foods & Olivia's does them right
Tuna Ceviche - Beautiful presentation & flavor

We would not have changed a single thing about our meal.  Jose Marquez, chef, came out to greet us & we could not stop gushing over the yummy meal!

Don't let the mall location fool you - great food, great mojitos, and a nice, clean, modern ambiance, plus a valet parking option.  Very tasty chips, salsa and guacamole to start, were followed by a superb chipotle calamari that was sautéed, not fried. So good!

The paella was out of this world, with shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and fish (white bass) over a delicious spicy rice base.  Truly excellent!  Fish tacos with the same white bass were great, too.

The service was impeccable; very friendly and really helpful with recommendations from the extensive menu.  We'll definitely be back next week!",u3xIBeZsvP_9ADcZhfgy0Q,1,0,5,M52F3BF4LQTKzSMn_8QeRg

5924327,2016-07-20,3,DO5mQxiBOgHEznosjxvJXw,"I don't understand all of the 5-star reviews on this place. Maybe it's just the service? Maybe they're just pleasantly surprised to find a semi-ok place in a practically defunct mall? Maybe this was just an off-day for the chef? Maybe I'll never know.

Ambiance: They made the place look pretty nice! You almost forget you're in a mall.

Service: Definitely friendly enough and timely enough, except the secondary server / busboy was wearing so much cologne we assumed he'd bathed in it and expected him to give us a sales pitch for it. It literally -- and I'm using that word as it's intended, not in a figurative way -- stung our nostrils every time he came by to refill our waters. That's a huge turnoff when people are trying to eat/smell/taste things. I can't believe the mangers let him work like that. Our actual waiter didn't have the same problem. Also, just like a couple other Mexican places around town, be prepared for multiple people to try to get you to order their guacamole. I love guac, but I hate up-selling.

Food: The free chips & salsa at the beginning are pretty decent. The chips will remind you of Mundo, if you ever went there. The salsa is a tad on the bitter/fire-roasted side, so if you like that style, you'll really dig it. Not very spicy st all. We ordered the calamari and the carne asada chile relleno. Calamari is grilled, FYI - not sure if we just didn't see that or it didn't say. It had a good flavor, but included way less for the money than most similar offerings, so don't expect to get a whole plate of it. For $10, you get maybe 8-10 small pieces and some salad. The chile relleno was a let down, especially since it's listed as a ""fan favorite"" on their site. It's basically meat, potatoes, mushrooms, rice, & beans in a large green chili with red sauce & a bit of cream. The meat was ok, but not as flavorful as I expect carne asada to be. The biggest issue with it was that the potatoes were not cooked all the way through; we ended up not being able to eat many of them. The red sauce it was bathed in was very odd, way too bitter & smoky for our taste (so take their salsa, which was good, and turn up the bitterness & smokiness until it's obnoxious, and that's how the sauce seemed). That could just be us, though, even though he usually really enjoys smoky sauces.

NOTES: You should know that the happy hour just changed (today, apparently) and is now 7-10pm instead of 5-7. My loss, your gain! Also, don't get your hopes up for sangria, cause it's not (at least not currently) on the menu.

Though I certainly appreciate friendly service, it doesn't outweigh the taste of your food (and the under-cooked-ness of it), especially when it's supposed to be a house special of sorts. I plan to come back and try a couple other things and will update this review if those things warrant an extra star.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,6,2,3,BNzoZhaAYrBDkoWG5ma6sg
