We were at a high top tucked in the corner, but there were others around us so it wasn't like we were out of the way.

Ordered a variety of stuff: sushi, sashimi, tempura, apps, etc. Make sure to order an app first, they come zipping out. Each dish just came out one after the other-- just when we were about to finish something, another dish popped up. I would say, a tiny place to improve is the sauce for the tempura, it needed something more to it like a spice, sweetness, or acidity. 

I like how the staff are dressed in black, zip around and get things done. The seating staff, waiters and waitresses, as well as chefs and busing staff coordinated really well.

825781,2017-10-02,1,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"Wow! 
It was a Friday night and we hit The Cosmopolitan hungry and without reservations. After looking over menus, a hostess engaged us and lured us away from STK ( the wait time helped too). 
We liked the vibe and decor at Zumba. The hostess and servers were personable and attentive.
Will, our server, covered the menu for us and gave recommendations. He also explained the dishes were smaller, similar to tapas, and suggested 3 dishes per person. There were 3 of us but one friend had eaten and just took a taste so 6 dishes fed us  fine ( we didn't have room for dessert if that helps judge  quantity). 

We ordered, and totally enjoyed the following items:

-watercress salad (it had a great kick with the wasabi dressing... loved it)

-salmon and tuna tartare (they kinda smash it but don't by judge the look as it is fabulous)

-dynamite spider ( huge and yum)

- spicy beef (really nice light smoke to it from how it was cooked)

-shiitake mushrooms (delicious! We showed restraint by not drinking the sauce)

-pork skewers (great flavor and rich)
 
We left full and happy. We thanked the hostess for enticing us to come in as it was a really delicious dinner. 

I recommend Zuma for sure! BUT I also recommend you think about how much will satisfy you and how much you want to spend. And if you tend to eat large portions for dinner, I'd say go here for drinks and try some dishes or skip blackjack and go all out on this yummy food experience :-)",k4MuXYIkuCrBaC4xEjRhVw,0,0,5,i-K5JW0kRvHNH2XYA-CbkA

BUT, we went for a few drinks and dessert last night (NY day) and it was by far the worst experience we've had to date there. We sat at the bar and ordered our normal drinks, my favorite is called the rubabu (which main ingredient is passion fruit), got the drinks and immediately I knew something was wrong with my drink; I asked the bartender if they could remake it because it was too sour and she said ""we ran out of the passion fruit liquor part so she had to use an actual passion fruit which made it sour."" She did remake it and added something to it to make it less sour but it wasn't the same. This particular bartender made our overall experience horrible; she  took forever to take drink orders, was quiet, not personable, and never offered us water (when we ordered a dessert). I think I was most surprised that they weren't disclosing that they ran out of an important ingredient in many cocktails, I almost wanted to tell people at the bar not to order that drink because of it.

Missed a few fine points, like no soy sauce on the table and not bringing a fresh napkin after the original absorbed a spill.

My one complaint is the music. It was so loud and conversation was impossible. They have a DJ and the music is better suited for a dance club than a restaurant. It diminished our experience and dinner was far less pleasant than it should have and could have been.

The sushi was a big notch below Tao (where I ate 24 hours ago) and everything cost more than Tao (the sake I had last night is $40 more here).

1791963,2018-01-08,1,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"Between 4 and 5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars for great service.

This restaurant had me at first glance due to all the Japanese whiskey and shochu they had at the bar.  I'm partial to Japanese whiskey lately, so already I was entranced by the beautiful presentation when we were waiting for our table (we had reservations but came an hour early, and they accommodated us after 20min).

I ended up ordering a cocktail, Shibuya rhythm, and it was delish!  One of the better cocktails I've had, not too sweet but refreshing and just a right balance of alcohol.  I'm always disappointed by cocktails, so I stick to just wine or straight whiskey/martini, and I was glad I gave their cocktails a chance.  Hubby had the Ginza boulevard, and he liked it.

For the food, I recommend:
- pork belly skewer:  the best pork belly I've had, so tender, it literally melts in your mouth.  Vegas must have some direct line to pork belly Gods, because Momofuku ramen had pretty damn good chashu, but this beats it.
- truffle wagyu sushi was different and delicious.  I'd recommend this for the new experience.
- we also enjoyed the truffle mushroom rice hot pot ($55, kinda pricey).  It tasted exactly how I imagined it, but in a good way.  Hearty, rich, deep mushroom flavors with added shaved truffles on top.  Can't go wrong with that.

We also had sauteed shishito peppers, tuna and salmon tartar, and they were all alright.  The only dish I wouldn't recommend is their tempura.  Oddly their prawn tempura was disappointing with a thick batter.  I like my tempura light, crispy and delicate, and it was none of those, although the prawn was juicy and fresh.

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and was impressed by the majority of the dishes.  Another reason we will always stay at Cosmo when in Vegas... the restaurant list keeps getting better and better!",HdHgQagoQCO2JAwsAnmwxg,3,4,5,6FkCVI3xIPm63hBx_yxy6A

I tried a couple of drinks while I was there as well, but one stood out as the superior.  The Burning History was very very cool to watch as it was being prepared, but it tasted even better.  Really loved it.

1941758,2017-11-27,1,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"Zuma is fast becoming an all time fave. We've eaten here about four times now and have yet to be disappointed and is now our ""go to"" when friends and family visit from out of town. 

It's located on the third floor of the Cosmo hotel above Morimotto and Milk bar in the old art studio. 

It's a fun atmosphere with loud music for great energy yet not too loud that you can't hear when talking with friends. 

The whole back of the restaurant is a large glass window overlooking LVB and Harmon Blvd. 

They have three kitchens, one Robato for wood fired creations, a sushi bar, and a main kitchen in the back (out of sight). Part of the experience is being able to look in on how the Robato and Sushi kitchens execute with experience. 

What makes this Japanese restaurant different than other Japanese restaurants is the quality of the craft and great complexity of flavors. For example the fresh sweet corn is made to order. It's grilled over charcoal, stacked, skewered, basted in warm shiso butter and garnished with micro greens. 

As a vegetarian my go to is the spicy tofu salad with avocado. The tofu Is warm, crunchy, and spicy and the avocado to cools it down nicely. This is a great dish to share... its a lot of tofu for one person. Everyone alike usually likes this dish. I also order the vegetable tempura, sushito peppers, and sweet corn with a side of sushi rice and this is usually enough for me. All these are plated beautifully and taste equally as great as they look. This is true. 

At our most recent visit, the Bone in Rib Eye was an absolute hit. It's served with fresh black truffle shaved table side by the waiter and dressed with a butter sauce (see video). The table side preparation alone had at least one vegetarian longing for a bite. It's very large and generously fed 4 last weekend. The group also liked the grilled Chilean sea bass. Served with green chili and ginger dressing, some at the table said it was the best they've ever had. 

Zuma is on the pricier side, but for a special occasion or a Vegas night out, it's worth the money many times over. Ive always had top notch service.

1989411,2018-05-13,0,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"Zuma is a contemporary Japanese fusion restaurant that opened in early 2017. It's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo hotel where most of the restaurants are located. This is a great place for any event - birthdays, girls/guys night out, date night, etc. There is a semi-private room (with a great view of the strip) towards the back of the restaurant. I loved the open kitchen concept. Pricing is on the higher end side but equivalent to others on the strip. 

Onto the food!

Lychee rose martini: I could seriously have 10 of these. It's so delicious! It had the right amount of flavor of both lychee and rose. 

Kurobuta pork belly with yuzu mustard miso: my absolute favorite dish. You have to get this! It literally melts in your mouth. 

Wagyu beef sushi with truffle: upon arrival of this dish, you can smell the truffle. However upon eating it, the truffle is actually very light in flavor. I was expecting more of a BAM!-in-your-face truffle flavor. The wagyu beef was excellent. It was my first time eating shaved truffle and it melted nicely in my mouth. 

Uni, ikura, barley miso sushi: the uni was so soft and not fishy at all. However, this was probably my least favorite dish because it was more on the bland side to me. 

Salmon and tuna tartare: presentation was lovely! The salmon had a slight fishy taste to it compared to the tuna but it wasn't in a bad or overwhelmingly way. I loved the crisps that it came with. 

Thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, truffle, and salmon roe: salmon roe was great! It reminded me of the popping boba but the savory version. The sliced seabass was delicate and mild in flavor. Truffle was once again very muted and I wished it had a stronger flavor. Pairing the salmon roe and seabass brought a nice texture and taste to the dish. 

Jumbo tiger prawn with yuzu sauce: another dish that I highly enjoyed! The sauce had a sweet, garlicky taste to it and I'm a fan with anything garlic. 

Saikyo miso marinated black cod wrapped in hoba leaf: I highly recommend this dish. The cod was so soft and had a sweet flavor from the saikyo miso. You really don't even need the dipping sauce that it came with. 

Tiger prawn tempura: tempura batter was light and airy. The yuzu sauce was a perfect pairing with this. 

Service was attentive and great! I wish I remembered the name of our server but he was awesome! He checked on us regularly and kept our cocktails and drink full. The only thing I wasn't really a fan of is the bathroom. While the inside was nice, it's only 1 stall (for each gender). 

I highly recommend this place. Just be prepared to spend a pretty penny here :)",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,2,0,5,Q7U-fofJ05LRMrEYZ756_g

Him and I had been apart for a while because of my crazy work/travel schedule and were looking to treat ourselves to a nice, fancy, Vegas dinner. I couldn't even recall the last time I had eaten sushi and I was so excited for it. We dressed up in our finest. We arrived at Zuma at around 6:30 PM on a Saturday night and hoped that they could seat us right away as we were starving from being at the pool all day. As we approached the hostess booth, we realized it didn't look too busy. We asked if they had a table for two. They said: ""would you want to sit at the bar?"" We told them we wanted a table, and they said all they had available was the high top. That didn't seem to bother us so we sat right down. We were then greeted, almost immediately by our beautiful server whose name is Sam. She was very warm and welcoming and told us that if we needed anything to let her know. She served us nice, warm still water. I hate ice water and I was so excited and thirsty. There were so many amazing items on the menu, it was hard to choose. Luckily, Sam had tried almost everything on the menu and was able to explain in great depth the appearance, the size, and the taste of each item. Definitely very helpful. We decided on a few rolls, we also got the sushi and salmon box, pictured below and the tofu salad with the spicy Siracha edamame. My fiancé and I shared everything. It was unbelievable. Everything about it, the appearance - the taste - and the creativity of the menu items. We got a delicious yellowtail roll, and also a salmon avocado roll. It was just the perfect amount of food to share between two people. There was literally nothing left at the end of our experience. I definitely recommend this place.

For $50 includes 4 course meal with a house specialty martini. Such a great deal I had to try it. Started off with a yellowtail sashimi dish w jalapeño and ponzu sauce, one of my favorite dishes at any sushi restaurant. Main entree was the baked salmon, love the crunchy skin and even though the salmon was just slightly over cooked, it was still really good. Dessert is included as well and even though I'm not a dessert lover, I had the coconut soufflé with ice cream, which was fantastically delicious. Very nice ambiance, extended menu and good food in a bustling casino on the strip.

But the big question is: Was the food as 5-star worthy as the ambience? Most definitely! My party didn't even have to wait long for our orders, which was surprising given the great amount of visual effort exerted in every dish we received.

It's perfect for bachelor/bachelorette parties, dinner before a night on the town, company dinners, or a date night. Restaurant lighting was dimmed but still light enough to see your food/significant other's face with the perfect mood music to set the night.

Yes the food was pricey but the quality and presentation of it sure makes up for it. We ordered so many dishes but we really couldn't pick a favorite because they were all that good!!!

For appetizers we ordered:
-shishito peppers
-prawn and black cod dumplings
-crispy fried calamari
-Hamachi usuzukuri pirikara which is yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish with ponzu and pickled garlic

From the Robata Grill section we got:
-yaki taraba gani-king crab with ponzu lime butter (see attached photo.)

We also got a couple orders of spicy tuna rolls and special rolls.

And that dessert platter....OH MY GOODNESS. That freakin presentation man.....wow. Yeah, it was normal dessert items with gelatos, mixed fruits, chocolate cake but my favorite item there was the ginger bread. I thought it was monkey bread at first because the texture and flavor was similar. Loved that cinnamon baked into the breading.

2864657,2017-09-04,0,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"Summary: Expensive and not worth the wait or their so - called experience.  

We came here around 9:30pm for dinner, party of 2. Prior to this,  I had called the restaurant and they told us that their first open reservation is at 9:45pm. However,  they do have a bar area where it's first come,  first serve and it's usually faster for quick bites. That sounds great,  let's do that bc there was only two of us.  How long can it be,  right? I was horribly wrong. Not only was Zuma crowded,  but their bar area can fit a handful of people.  The tall tables but the bar/ window area are not part of the bar.  Those require reservations.  Okay,  fine.  Might as well wait as we are already here and their escalator was out of service so both elevators had lines to go down.  45 mins went by and we were finally seated in front if the sushi chef.  It smelled like a fish market.  Again,  fine,  as we didn't have reservation.  

Now,  for the service and food.  While our server was friendly, he was scattered.  We didn't get hot towels to clean our hands, while others did.  One of our orders were delivered to the wrong table.  And each item took 15-20 mins to come.  We couldn't fully enjoy a dinner as their was a long pause in between.  Furthermore,  for a ""high class"" sushi house, you'd think they'll give you better chopsticks,  right? Nope. Cheap chopsticks that soaked up whatever dish you're eating will carry over onto the next.  

As for the food,  hit and misses.  But overall,  not worth the price.  The spicy lobster miso soup had three small pieces of lobsters and the broth tasted like chicken brother with ramen spices; it lacked the miso base. Similarly,  the majority of their dishes were salty or heavily sauced that you can't enjoy the freshness of the seafood.  This defeats the purpose of going to a sushi house.  

Overall,  I would not be back and do not suggest eating here as there are so many sushi restaurants on the strip with better quality,  services, and price.",8ktLyldH9JwNpD70-Ho2Tg,4,0,1,zFvdzXBIfzE_PBxavZMRlA

In the 2 years living here, never had tried it till last weekend... Man! So not disappointing! Probably one of the best palate experiences I've had being here... Just amazing food. 

There were 4 of us and we went with the Omakasi Signature style choice at $138.00 per person
This had the:
edamame
robata asparagus 
spicy fried tofu with avocado and japanese herbs
seabass sashimi with yuzu, truffle and salmon roe*
sliced seared tuna with chili daikon and ponzu sauce
lobster 1 1/2 lb with spicy ponzu and wasabi mayo
salmon and tuna Tartare
Ribeye with black truffle shavings (Just ridiculously amazing)
Black Cod
There was an assortment of sushi that was that was on a tiered presentation
And an assortment of desserts

The quality of the sushi was up there with Nobu... Just so flavorful! 

To drink I had a Japanese Old Fashion, okay maybe 3 of them... Made with Japanese Whiskey -  Suntory Toki  - just amazingly smooth and delicious!

As you can tell by what they served, we weren't hungry when we left. The food and service were just incredible! I cannot wait to come back and try more of what they have!

2966006,2018-06-28,10,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"Zuma is loud and pricier than lots of Japanese restaurants in town...but it is also worth it. Simply put, I love it here!

I've been to Zuma Las Vegas at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino on several occasions over the last 2 years. My first impression was that it was way too loud...but once you have a sip of one of their delicious cocktails, you are ready to meld with the ambiance...and once your lips meet the delicate and fresh Japanese cuisine, everything fades and gives way to the symphony of flavors in your mouth. 

I brought my love here recently for his birthday, and we opted to celebrate with the Seasonal Omakase. We had the pleasure of sitting at the Izakaya side of the bar and watching all the action and excitement amongst the chefs. If it is just the two of us, this is my favorite seat for entertainment value, though I believe that the sushi bar would be equally enjoyable. James was our server and he was not only knowledgeable, but also fun and engaging over the 3 hour meal, characterized by the freshest ingredients and artful presentations. I'm a huge fan of Omakase and Kaiseki styles of Japanese food, and this experience at Zuma stands out as the best on the strip! Simply amazing! In fact, the Seasonal Omakase was so enjoyable that we didn't hesitate to come back the next week with a couple close friends during restaurant week 2018. For Restaurant Week, $50 gets you a complementary cocktail, appetizer, chef's choice of Maki and sushi for the table, an entrée, and a dessert.  Such a beautifully elegant and delicious meal of incredible value...so much so, that you may feel like your parking ticket was the most spendy part of the night.

When you encounter passionate and fun staff at a restaurant, you know you will have a good time. When they are doing it with food that leaves a lasting impression, you know you've found something special...something that I want more of. If it wasn't already apparent, I am a huge fan of Zuma!

The moment you walk into Zuma, the experience is beyond amazing! The restaurant design and decor is breathtaking. The service is impeccable. The food and drinks are ""wow"" level. 

We started at the bar and it was mesmerizing watching the bartenders work passionately to make their signature craft cocktails. The Geisha Smash is the drink to get. We had 3! Smooth and all the flavors balanced perfectly. I also had a signature drink that was comparable to a Salty Dog, I forget the drink name, and it was a cloudy pink drink that was quite tasty as well.

We tried a bit of everything on the food menu and we got a good variety. I don't think we had a bad dish in the bunch, and we had many different dishes. I apologize as I don't remember all details of the menu items but can label accordingly once the menu is posted. My favorites were the thinly sliced sea bass with salmon roe, king crab, hot pot mushroom rice, lobster, corn on the cob, soft shell crab sushi, branzino, passion fruit dessert, molten chocolate dessert. So many delicious dishes. I don't think you can really go wrong with anything here.

All in all, we had a very memorable experience and I am so impressed with everything here at Zuma. We may have to get a group together so we can use the group dining area in the back for the view!

I feel this place has more of a focus on the food than some of the other restaurants in this hotel. Some, without naming names, are more about the scene than the food. Luckily for us, Zuma comes through with excellent food.

The skirt steak came with a cool chimichurri sauce that was pretty good. Every dish comes with salt (himalayan?) on the side. Use very carefully, and don't use a lot, doesn't need that much. The robata skewers crushed it, the chicken wings and the beef with shishito pepper were pretty big and full of flavor. Get sushi if you want but I'd focus on their other dishes, like from the robata, skewers, or the bigger plates.

Handcrafted ice and cocktails sitting in barrels are a few of the more inspired drinks on the menu. I overheard a convo the bartender had about sour beers and my ears perked up. He gave me the beer even though they don't sell it and only use it in cocktails. What a nice gesture!

Do not come here expecting just sushi. It's an izakaya! Sushi is there, but it's not the main event. Enjoy the robata grill and the shared plates.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,0,0,4,GEddkun0oFo0hmJu-tf98w

Sushi: Uni - excellent, Snapper - excellent, Amaebi variant - excellent
*sushi is a bit expensive for the quality and presentation, you are essentially paying for the service.  Quality can be found at many other sushi spots that cost way less.  It is the not in the restaurant but in the handling of the fish by the proper sushi chef.
*Uni - $15 / 2 pieces, Snapper - $12 / 2 pieces, Amaebi - $15 / 2 pieces
Calamari - Ok. It is very crispy and light and nice with the thin slices of peppers but I feel like the squid was a bit lacking in depth.  Small pieces.
Tempura, vegetable and seafood - excellent.  Tempura could've been crispier and more airy.
Pork Belly - excellent but expensive.  $15 for six 1"" cubes is a bit high but again you are paying half for the food and half for the service/ambiance.
Unagi roll - terrible for the price. It was a boring roll that lacked in depth and was a bit too wet.  (forgot price but was between $15-$18).  IT tasted like a roll from an all-you-can-eat restaurant.

At $178 a person I can honestly say it was worth it. The food quality was amazing & we left satisfied & full. The waiter told us the last thing they would want is for someone to order the omakase & then hit a fast food place to fill up. Service was superb. Everything came out fresh & piping hot. The way they navigated us through the courses was perfect. It is noisy in the restaurant & tables are close so if you're looking for a quiet romantic place to celebrate this ain't it.

We sat at the sushi bar and was immediately approached by our upbeat and super happy server Joseph. 
As first time diners we had no clue what to expect. Joseph went through the entire menu with us and gave us some of his favorites. We started with some sake and I got the Wasabi Mule. I could have used a Lil more Wasabi but it was pretty delicious! 
We started with the 
shishito peppers with lime and sea salt and the sweet and spicy Edamame.
We then ordered the wagu beef and truffle sushi roll. It comes with two pieces and is slightly expensive but worth every penny. It honestly was the best item from a restaurant I've ever had. We ended up ordering the same thing numerous times because it was so good!
We had a few other rolls as well. the pirikara hamachi roll,
spicy yellowtail roll with serrano pepper, avocado and wasabi mayo. Spicy tuna roll and the yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish, ponzu and pickled garlic. We ended our meal with Joseph's favorite, the spicy tenderloin. Absolute perfection!

It's very upscale and they give you fine dining experience.

They give you warm towels in the beginning to clean your hands. They pour your soy sauce in your soy sauce cup for you. They set up everything for you.

My friend ordered a wasabi mule which is a drink on the menu and it was really refreshing.

What I ordered:

Calamari: Very good with the perfect batter.
Uni Nigiri: Uni was really fresh here, I really enjoyed it.
Kinmedai Nigiri: Had a very good taste to it.
Saba Nigiri: Saba has it's reputation for being very, very fishy but in this case it wasn't super fishy. It had the right fishiness taste - wasn't overpowering.
Suzuki Nigiri: I always enjoy suzuki so it's my go to order.
Tai Nigiri: Good.
Mirugai Nigiri: Realllly good here, I love mirugai and this place definitely had fresh mirugai.
SS WAGYU: This is served raw and meshed up. Lots of flavor.
Saikyo Black Cod: Good portion. It comes with a citrus sauce but I recommend eating it alone. It doesn't need sauce.
Spicy Beef Tenderloin: HANDS DOWN, this was my favorite thing on the menu. We ordered meat at a sushi restaurant to balance it out. Been to Ruth Chris, Mastro's, Fleming's, and other steakhouses and this was by far the best meat I've ever had. It's next to Wagyu but this was PERFECT.

For two people the total came out to be $252.22 including tax. I really enjoyed Zuma, especially the beef tenderloin.",-keGVPsNuiBafntOOf7kSQ,2,3,4,vBp3ZDZC8J6gJlSbMSPRNg

If you're willing to get a little spendy, this is a great spot to visit with an adventurous group of diners. I came with my husband and in-laws, so a group of five, and we had an amazing time from top to bottom.

It's kind of like Japanese tapas: the dishes are smaller so you'll want to order a number of dishes and share them all. They range from salads to sushi rolls to meat skewers, and I think there was only one dish we didn't love out of at least 12. The nigiri is fantastic: super fresh and, though tiny, delicious. The sushi rolls are creative - we especially enjoyed the yellowtail and serrano pepper rolls and ordered seconds. The pork belly skewers were also a highlight, super tender and melt in your mouth. 

Beware of being up-sold to dishes you don't really want here. The wait staff are really efficient, friendly, and helpful, but they'll also do everything they can to sneak more plates onto your table than you asked for. We managed to avoid this for the most part, but did end up copping to a $60 dessert plate which looked grand but was really just a taster of a few different options with big presentation. Still, it was all pretty delicious.

The drinks are also great - the old fashioned with Japanese Suntory whisky was delicious, as were the espresso martinis, which my specialist sister-in-law said was the best she had. The attention to detail is also a nice touch, with ZUMA printed into the ice cube in the former and on a sheet of chocolate on the latter. We also got assistance from the sommelier to help us pick a sake, and after learning about some good ones we've tried in the past she helped us pick a bottle that we all loved.

There's an option for a set priced meal at around $130, or $170 for the premium version - but we wound up paying less than that per person including drinks, so I'd say skip that and choose the dishes you want to try most. As I said, this is a pricey restaurant, but if you're ready to spend you'll have a fantastic meal and a fun time here.",uCNgCZCuo07ew0sWPB1z7g,11,9,5,q2d_ZCMwGG82bLOEk5q5Eg

The fish was very fresh and well cut, with tantalizing rolls and appetizers. My compliments to the chef for the creative use of Serrano pepper which appeared in several of my favorite dishes: a yellowtail / Serrano / wasabi roll and a calamari with lime and Serrano. Delish!

I don't personally drink anymore, but my party tried several cocktails including a stellar whiskey drink that include a hand cut ice cube and smoke burned from a Japanese tree. The reported it to be phenomenal. 

Two things to keep in mind if you are going: #1 - as with all places on the strip, you are better of making a reservation. My group got lucky and found a spot at the bar, but most groups were waiting 30 minutes or more. #2 - You will spend money to get the best.

Ordered:
x crispy fried calamari with green chili and lime - good, but not amazing. hard to fail calamari. 
x yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish, ponzu and pickled garlic
x kinoko no kama meshi - good again, but no different than most dishes I tried in this style. Better than the one at Nobu IMO.
x rice hot pot with wild mushrooms - OMG SO GOOD! This came with a generous portion of truffle shavings and I could actually taste it in the rice after they mixed it up. It's one of their most popular items so ORDER IT. My friend who doesn't even like truffles liked the dish :) 
x spicy yellowtail roll with serrano pepper, avocado and wasabi mayo - Loved this roll. Super fresh!
x salmon and tuna tartare - reminded me of the one over at Morimoto... very good. 
x chicken wings - probably my favorite thing of the night. Super flavorful and tender. Highly recommend this one :)
x chicken skewers - just ok
x jumbo prawn - This one was SOOOOO good. It tasted like lobster, but BETTER. It was HUGE! MUST ORDER. 
x king crab with caviar sushi - light and refreshing, but not worth the price. 
x dynamite spider roll w/ soft shell crab - filling roll with lots of soft shell crab. I really like this one.

Everything was really good, but for $145/pp it was a bit steep. I don't mind paying a lot for food, but I thought for what we got it was too expensive. I like Sushi Samba over at Palazzo/Venetian better :P Some of their dishes are mind-blowing!",uNuPyXHbbtHnhWhPLamESQ,1,1,4,nF5wvf8e-x1Yab0SjBHoUw

3761080,2018-03-12,1,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"My wife and I were looking forward to trying this location after having a fantastic experience at Zuma in Miami Beach a few months ago so the bar was already set at a high level.  

The thing that I wanted to note at the beginning was how well this location is managed.  I made a note to compliment the manager on their points of service.  From the servers holding up their walking patterns to make sure that guests were allowed to pass first to just he overall demeanor of everyone, the training is obviously elite here.  

Our server was Jasmine and she was on point all night.  She was friendly, helpful and went out of her way to make sure that the night was fun and eventful.  When you are going to be dropping around $300 including tip for two people, you already have high expectations but she was fantastic.  Jacob was also another bartender who we met about halfway through and he was excellent as well.  He even went out of his way after our dinner to offer us a a rum cocktail with two of their custom branded ice cubes that had a nice touch.  The rum was Ron Zacapa and it was a nice way to end the evening.

I started with wine which was my usual ""Go to"" while my wife had the Raspberry Passion Fruit cocktail which she had enjoyed in Miami.  She eventually went with Kiyogi Fizz after Jasmine recommended it and the presentation was off the charts.  This thing was a work of art and also tasted great according to my wife.  Jasmine was mixing, shaking, torching and did everything you could do to make a drink other than ferment the alcohol herself.  

As for the food, we started with the Jumbo Tiger Prawn which is a must-have if you ever come here.  Its not just unique, it's also an excellent dish.  We picked it clean in about 5 minutes.  We also enjoyed the Prawn & Black Cod Dumplings.  My wife had wanted to try the Salmon & Tuna Tartare the first time in Miami but we didn't get it so she pushed for it this time around.  It was an interesting and also quite good.  

We opted for the 9 Piece Sushi Selection which is always going to be a gamble since you don't know what they will give you.  You can make requests on certain things that you don't want like I did with Sea Urchin and Squid.  Our order included Salmon, Ebi, Sweet Shrimp, Scallop, Golden Eye Snapper(My Favorite), Japanese Mackarel, Yellowtail and Tuna.  The one disappointment that keeps this from being a 5-star is that the sushi was off in some instances.  It had a tap-water taste to it.  It was like it had been washed under a faucet which is not ideal.  It didn't ruin the dish but it definitely could be noticed.  My wife felt the same way and she said that she would not order that particular dish again.   

We certainly did not come away disappointed and would recommend Zuma to people coming to Vegas.",ruqe3slVDfXdXVMPtM976g,2,1,4,jI7W5OeINCRH82NH3iqYpg

3832452,2017-05-04,0,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"This is my fourth attempt at overpriced sushi joints. We came here cause my fiancé and I love sushi. Also, we were staying here at the Cosmo. 

The food is standard. I love sashimi and I love rolls.  I've been to all kinds of sushi restaurants in California and New York and Boston since childhood. With joints like Zuma that charge prices like Nobu, all you're really getting is very high-quality fish. This is only noticeable in the sashimi and even there, it's not a huge difference.  You'll pay like $15 for two pieces of sake, whereas other places may give you 4 pieces for same price. The sashimi was delicious. Their rolls, however, are always simple and not particularly imaginative or yummy. Highly forgettable. I genuinely think these boujee sushi joints have lackluster rolls, a bunch of pretentious small dishes that are tasty but honestly not worth their prices.

Sadly, this place is getting a 2 star review, not because of food, but for extremely rude, trashy service. For food I would've given 4 stars because I know how the game works with these restaurants so for what they're trying to be, they're doing that angle right. 

But THE SERVICE SUCKED FROM EVERY ANGLE. supposedly they're open till midnight, you get in and they say kitchen closes at 10:45, we got in at 10:30. So that was fine we said we can make our order quick, but there were being rude from the hostess to the manager to our server. Like rushing and being rude and making faces. Your kitchen closes at 10:45, so does that mean between 10 PM and 1030 we treat those customers like crap? Then you should change your closing time to 10 since that's when all of the attitude here seem to go to the garbage. The restaurant was like half empty when we got in so we ask for a booth, they said no, it would be a long wait. But my fiancé was persistent and said it's OK, we'll wait, and suddenly they were able to give a booth within one minute. They are so lazy that they didn't want to put a spoon and fork on the booth table. Pathetic!!! I've dropped way more money at other restaurants, and I would go back because their food was good but their service was also incredibly hospitable. This isnt McDonald's, so if your service is bad, that's a huge problem and I will not return to your nasty establishment that's probably going to go out of business within a few years.",kOXTDwwlJ_9NKm9xhMPQOg,5,0,2,FUbNIQnHrovFDcZkfoBdPw

There is more fine wood work in Zuma than in many forests.  The table we sat at was made of  a very large log of some rare wood which was magnificent.  The lighting and music matched the decor and it all comes together as a perfect vibe to enjoy the fabulous food. 

We had sushi, robata meats and the truffle rice.  Each dish was served on a unique serving dish,  The rice came in a small wooden box that looked like it was made to last centuries. The rice was prepared by adding a soft cooked egg and then a black truffle was shaved into it. 

The food was very good, but the ambiance of the place made it a real experience. This is a great place to dine.",Lb5a2VJFaH1w48GewaZctw,0,0,5,1WX9wFG-PjV4p_DYsQ6N8A

Service: We were seated exactly at our reservation time and the lead host greeted us immediately with warm moist towels to freshen up. 
 Appetizers and dishes came out promptly except for the dishes out of the Robata grill.  Delayed most likely because of the packed house. 

Upscale Izakaya fusion:  The buta - bara yuzu miso/Pork Belly skewers were fantastic.  The kankoku fu kohitsuji/lamb chops were tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly and I'm ordering next visit.  The ishi ebi no tempura piri kara tofu/Rock Shrimp was good and ""tempura'd"" perfectly.  All rolls were fresh as one would expect from Zuma

Ambiance:  Massive sex appeal at Zuma. There's an open room upscale Izakaya dining area with lots of wood, contemporary lighting and upbeat music in the background.  All details are upscale to provide a beautiful dining experience.  The 3 food prep areas: Sushi Counter, Robata Grill and Main Kitchen is open to the dining area for your viewing pleasure.  

I love Izakaya/Japanese tapas style dining that calls for many dishes to be ordered and shared around the table.  The prices are on the high end/Strip pricing and you can rack up a bill quickly. The plates are tasty, but the portions are small.  Couple that up with a very sexy dining area and you have a perfect restaurant to visit for a business dinner when the company is paying.

And the great was the Sushi.  4.5 Stars on this alone for me.  On the next visit for sure the orders will be 80% sushi 20% other.  I mean just look at that picture posted...pure bliss.  Stunningly fresh and succulent sea bass, hamachi, maguro, scallop....then caviar topping off our roll?  Yes PLEASE.  

The rest of the experience?  2.5 Stars.

Our first drinks took 20 minutes to arrive.  We ordered the hyped Burning History and a Gin n Tonic.  If I'm the bar manager, I want drinks going out asap.  The sooner customers have it, the more time they have to order more!  The Burning History was nice to watch and drink, but it didn't give me any warm fuzzies.  The next round of drinks took another 20 minutes.   Why?????

We sat at the tables near the sushi bar and man, it was nightclub ambiance throughout.  Dark, LOUD MUSIC, and LOUD MUSIC, lol.  I don't have a problem with it, but you who is reading this be warned.

Our server seemed all over the place.  We were unattended for what felt like eternity often, and the tables surrounding us were all twiddling there thumbs also.  He was running around to everyone but his own tables.

The biggest disappointment BY FAR was the most hyped by the hostess and the server.  The spicy beef tenderloin was a complete bust.  Man, one of the biggest wth were they thinking moments.  We ordered medium rare, it came medium and tough.  The refire took another 10 minutes and while cooked correctly this time, Still. So. Underwhelming.  Trust me, don't order this, its complete MEH.

The rice hotpot with black truffle and mushrooms is a ""signature dish' but is rather forgetful.  First 2 bites was ""not bad,"" and then quickly got bland and regrettable as it is totally not worth the money.

The King Crab in ponzu sauce?  Heckkkk noooooo.  As noted by other reviews, tiny 4-5 bites, the crabmeat is tiny, the sauce just ok.  Way overpriced.  Perhaps the high price is for the presentation if you IG, but thats about it.

Return visit?  OF COURSE!  The Sushi!  The nightclub feeling!  Still have to try that Tartare!  The lobster!  More Robata!

I think perhaps the biggest mistake was having sushi first because it setup the rest for such high expectations, but they all missed.

Their Alaskan king crab leg was just okay. Their giant grilled prawn was dry and had no flavor.

The food WAS PHENOMENAL!! So so yummy. We had the calamari, which was seasoned SO perfectly. So perfect in fact, that it didn't come with sauce because it didn't even need it! Just sprinkle some lime on it. We also had their spicy tuna maki roll. So so good. The quality of the fish was there!! And the last appetizer we ordered was their shrimp and cod dumplings. AND WOWZA. Best dumpling I've ever had.  the cod had such a good taste to it. For our entrees we shared their wagyu skirt steak and king crab. The wagyu skirt steak was so tender. It came with chimichurri, sea salt, and wasabi on the side, which I wouldn't think to eat with steak but oh mannnn, it made an amazing steak so much better. And the crab had a lemon butter sauce on it and it was so meaty! Lastly, we had their chocolate dessert. It was a chocolate lava cake with a caramel and praline(maybe) sauce  with a vanilla ice cream. It was very sweet, but it definitely topped off my dinner.

We each had a couple of those drinks... both very well crafted and balanced.

Working our way down the menu, we sampled things like 'Giamndara To Ebi No Gyoza'..which were prawn and black cod dumplings. So good... there was fresh sushi and sashimi as well. Everything we tried from that list, like the scallops, were so fresh and well prepared.

It's a pricey comparison to some of the local eateries  that offer a similar concept and style as Zuma - (Yonaka comes to mind) - but Zuma has an ambiance, a style,  and a drink list, that are to be sampled if you have a chance.

I was genuinely disappointed my first few visits as they had some growing pains... but, they seemed to have figured it most of it out. Still not quite able to reach the bar set in London.

The decor and ambiance are fantastic. Great design textures featuring ""laser"" cut metal lighting columns, large exotic slabs of wood and stone. The restaurant design/decor may be the one area this restaurant exceeds expectations. The ambiance has a modern and trendy energy. There is usually an active bar scene as you enter.

The food is excellent and the menu is extensive. Obviously the sushi is the star of the show but there are many other great choices available. I highly recommend the wagyu sushi roll. 

The service isn't anything special and sometimes disappoints. Not quite in par with the decor and food quality but not bad though.

The kitchen is an open kitchen in the center of the restaurant so I was a little worried we'd walk out smelling like char-broil, but that exhaust vent over the hot coals grill did the trick and you don't even smell the food cooking AT ALL so no worries about having to re-wash your hair to de-stink.

Third floor of the Cosmopolitan has a lot of restaurant choices, but Zuma is my new favorite. Izakaya is a type of bar/restaurant with small inexpensive (not in the case of Zuma!) plates meant to be eaten with alcohol. Aka Japanese style tapas? 
We ordered a lot, here are my favorites ranked highest to lowest :)
1. KUROBUTA PORK BELLY SKEWER: 2 pieces served with yuzu mustard miso. Heavy on the miso with just a slight kick of mustard. Favorite order of the night. Kurobuta is like the wagyu of pork. Fatty, but melt in your mouth kind of fatty, not that never ending chewing kind of fatty. 
2. MISO BLACK COD WRAPPED IN HOBA LEAF: In Japan, this dish is called Gindara misozuke. Gindara is a type of cod, closest US relation is the black cod. Buttery, melt in your mouth texture with a miso sauce to eat it with. It's a must order when you go to Izakaya and the portion size was great. 
3. SUSHI ROLLS: I can't remember the name, but what we ordered were all great. 
4. SOFT SHELL CRAB WITH WASABI SAUCE: A good starter plate. The sauce was what made the plate. If you like wasabi, order it. If not, don't order for just the crab. 
5. SHIITAKE WITH GARLIC SOY BUTTER: The flavor was good, but it overpowered the shiitake and the mushy presentation was not my favorite. Shiitake has a lot of flavor on its own and I couldn't appreciate it with how buttery they were. 

DON'T ORDER: SHRIMP TEMPURA (boring, did not stand out for any other restaurant) SPICY LAMB WITH MYOGA (served with a gojijan sauce, Japanese don't normally eat lamb... so don't order it at a Japanese restaurant, duh) 

Dark, romantic vibe that got a lot louder as the night went on. Music was pretty low so easily able to have a conversation. They have strip view seating, but it's in a party table section so don't expect dinner with a view here.

Strong sake menu and the sommelier can help you out with your choice. The JAPANESE GARIBALDI: V8 on the rocks is what we decided it was. Low alcohol content, tasted more like juicing cleanse than date night drinks.",8XKSiMpMxgdwI3qjuqmXFg,5,3,5,O2bDAuDa3UE6Eiwn8_FUpA

The service from my waiter was amazing. I felt like he had good suggestions for the menu and he was so so helpful in helping me choose different dishes. I came by myself, and I wanted to try a few different things without over ordering. He was great at helping me choose some larger portioned dishes with some smaller dishes. 

I had the saikyo miso marinated black cod wrapped in hoba leaf, yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish/ponzu/pickled garlic, zuma chirashi maki roll, and chocolate molten cake with ice cream. I highly recommend  the yellowtail sashimi, zuma chirashi maki roll, and the chocolate molten cake. All of them were very flavorful and so beautifully presented. I felt like the black cod's sauce was great but I barely dipped it in the sauce because I felt like it overpowered the cod. That's just my preference, but I probably wouldn't order it if I came for a second time. I think I'd want to try something new.

Overall, the food was good but I probably wouldn't get the black cod because I felt like the sauce was overpowering the cod. The other dishes were great and would definitely recommend those.

I liked the scallops and pork belly skewer a lot. We also got the rice pot with shaved truffle that was heavenly and the tempura was juicy and crispy. The steak was another solid dish.

I've heard about this particular Japanese Tapas/Robata grill place for a while and was excited to go try it since I was staying at the Cosmopolitan. It was just a jump, skip, and a hop away from me. 

Zuma is located on South Las Vegas Blvd. right on the strip. It's inside of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino on the third floor. I believe there's validation at the front entrance if you're driving there. 

Just like the hotel itself, Zuma is a trendy and upscale Japanese restaurant with large windows facing the street. There's a bar area in the front for drinks and customers can also order food there. The interior is spacious with many small and big tables. The ambience is darkish with a lot of mood lighting which is pretty much the norm for a lot of the restaurants inside the Cosmopolitan. There's a raw bar on one side of the restaurant and another cooking and Robata Grill station on the other side. We were seated right away. (It wasn't really crowded on a Tuesday night.) Our server was both polite and kindly suggested a couple of dishes he liked himself. We ordered a few to share and got some tasty cocktails too. When in Vegas.....

Overall I would definitely go back and try more of their other dishes like the Robata meats, skewers, and signature dishes. They have so many delicious looking dishes on the menu, I'm sure there's something for anyone's discerning tastes. 

Lychee & Rose Petal Martini : I was hesitant in ordering this, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be too sweet. Instead it as the right amount of fruit flavor to alcohol. I had two of these. : ) If you like fruity cocktails, this is the one for you. 

Steamed Baby Spinach w/ Sesame Dressing : This was good. It's a cold dish. The sesame was all mixed into the spinach, but I still wished there were more of the dressing. 

Prawn & Black Cod Dumplings : This dish seemed like a favorite here so we ordered it. It's similar to Chinese Fish Dumplings except with Black Cod. If you like fish dumplings, you'll like this dish. 

Japanese Sweet Corn w/ Shiso Butter : This was a good side to order. The corn were all slathered in butter. I had to floss majorly bad after but it was worth it. : )

King Crab w/ Ponzu Lime Butter : This was one of their Robata Seafood items. I love King Crab so I had to order this. This isn't a big portion; probably about one leg. The ponzu lime butter really makes the dish. I loved dipping the king crab into the sauce! If you're there with a group, I'd suggest ordering more than one for the table. 

Green Tea & Banana Cake w/ Coconut Ice Cream & Peanut Toffee Sauce : This was delicious! I'm glad I picked it from all the other desserts on the menu. The presentation was on point too. The thin slices of banana on top was a nice touch. The coconut ice cream was light and smooth. However the green tea part was only a thin layer on the bottom of the banana cake so that was a letdown. I feel like they should've at least have half of it be green tea.",LeUQnmx7UP7fnjnujCGSlw,96,83,4,_3z92EyE4mmPqofWhpcPQg

We were told it would be about 30 minutes, which we expected since we arrived without a reservation. We waited in the hall for about 20 and decided it must be getting close so we sat at the bar and had a glass of wine. Once our wine was gone ( probably 20'more minutes) my husband went and inquired about how much longer. We were told 20-30 minutes more which I did not understand because from where we were sitting I could see at least 4 empty tables and space at the sushi bar the whole time so we decided to go else where. As we were walking out the gal said, ""oh I have seating for you now. ""
So at about 8pm we were seated at the sushi bar ( mind you the 4 other tables are still open) the waiter gave us the menus and the bar menu and asked what kind of water we desired ( sparkling, bottled or tap). 5 minutes or so later he poured warm tap water in our glasses, found a wine menu for us and left. We sat for another 10 or so minutes after we set down our menus waiting to have our order taken. At 8:25 pm we walked out never to return. Our order was never taken and we never saw our waiter again.

Atmosphere: 5 Stars 

Overall, I really enjoyed my first time dining experience there. The Japanese fusion cuisine that is similar to the concept of Morimoto but better! Loved the open kitchens. The price is on higher side but it's average price for the strip Japanese cuisines. 

The view of the strip for the party room looks awesome. If you are looking into booking a 10/12 people party, you should check out Zuma. 

Services was good overall. Our server was attentive. However, the hosts were not so welcoming. Somehow they gave a snobbish vibe. Not really a great first impression but all good after we sat down. 

I enjoyed most of the things we ordered. However, the sushi rolls/nigiri didn't look appealing to me. Our server recommended us to get a few rolls. We order one first to try. It was not impressive at all. When I return again, I will not order any sushi rolls. The drinks of the day we ordered were all pretty good. One with lychee and one with raspberry and passion fruit. Both were yummy. 

Things we've tried:

1. Salmon and tuna tartare (5/5): it was nicely presented similar to Morimoto. The ingredients were fresh. 

2. Seabass sashimi with salmon roe (4/5): unsure of what type of seabass it is. It was fresh and nicely flavored with yuzu and truffle. 

3. Grilled Yuzu Miso Pork Belly(5/5): probably one of my favorite of the night. The kurobuta pork quality was excellent. It reminded me of Raku. Definitely getting this again next time. 

4. Shishito pepper (3/5): it was like any other shishito pepper. 

5. Prawn and Black Cod Dumplings (4/5): it was nicely flavored but not worth the price. 

6. Rice hot pot (5/5): with the truffle, this dish is priced at $55. Quite pricy. However, I enjoyed the rice with variety mushrooms and of course the nice flavor from the black truffle. 

7. Miso Black Cod (5/5): One of our favorite that night. High quality of fish and perfectly marinated miso. Highly recommended. 

8. Zuma chirashi (2/5): It was mediocre like I mentioned earlier. Won't order the roll again.

9. Ribeye with chili yuzu (4/5): it was nicely cooked and the sauce was a great compliment to the steak. I like that they cut it so it's easy to share: 

10. Lobster with ponzu butter (5/5): loved it. Great quality of lobster and perfectly seasoned. Will order this again.

11. Chocolate soufflé (3/5): average soufflé. 

12. Chawamushi dessert (3/5): not impressed with this dessert either. It was bland to me.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,6,3,4,hFiejmbXxHSicxoY5GGrUg

Chef Erick Melendez was up for the challenge!
We started off with drinks. Both of us got the Rubabu. It's a little on the tart side, but oh so refreshing! The juice is sweet enough without any added sugar. I also thoroughly enjoyed the foam that sits on the top of the drink throughout its consumption. Even though it's an alcoholic beverage, you can't taste any hint of alcohol. So beware standing up after two of these (as we found out for ourselves).

The vegan/soy-free/sesame-free items that Chef Erick made for us were the Zuma Kappa Maki (ginger, cucumber, & avocado roll), a citrus avocado & tomato salad (not a menu item), Shishito no Suage Wafujio (shishito peppers with wafu salt), slow cooked leeks with shaved truffle (not a menu item), grilled sweet corn, and grilled shitaki mushrooms with garlic chips. Chef Erick really pulled through for us. It was amazing how much attention was put into every detail of making our veggies look and taste amazing!

Since I am not vegan or allergic to anything (that I know of anyways), Erick also made me some extra dishes. These were the Gindara to Ebi no Gyoza (prawn & black cod dumplings), Tomato to Nasu no Wafu Salada (tomato & eggplant salad with ginger & spring onion dressing), and the Maguro no Tataki (sliced seared tuna, chili daikon, & ponzu sauce). I would highly recommend all of these phenomenal dishes. 

Last but not least, for dessert we had the fruit platter. This was by far, the most beautiful bowl of exotic fruit I've ever seen, and the taste of this fresh fruit matched it's beauty.

We opted for the premium Omakase menu, and it was amazing as it had Sashimi, Sushi (including a sushi roll), tempura Lobster, King Crab, Waygu Beef, and others. On their menu, the crab was $42, and the Waygu was $195. It was the only way to access some of the high end options on the menu. It also came with this amazing dessert with tropical fruit, keylime pie, and a molten chocolate lava cake!

The last time we came to Las Vegas we made reservations to eat at Zuma located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitian. This place is pretty new and always busy. 

I had the Bartender Ava, she is amazing and made me and my boyfriend excellent drinks. I had the Burning History and he had the Hachiko both very excellent. 

This last time we just visited Zuma so that we could indulge with these drinks again. The entire third floor was extremely packed, but we were able to sit at the bar at Zuma and enjoy these cocktails again.",98rLDXbloLXekGjieuQSlA,1,0,5,WlPsPtduS2xcuxqviizhkA

5022900,2018-02-17,2,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"I'd dined at Zuma last year during the first weekend of March Madness and came away so impressed that I knew that I had to take my wife here the next time we were both in town.  We had dinner reservations for 6:30 on a Tuesday night, which was likely a good thing because by 7, the place had largely filled up.  We were seated at the robata grill, which offered a great view of delicious looking (and tasting) food being prepared.

Our decision on food was easy based on my previous experience.  We had the Premium Omakase ($178/person, which was a $10 increase since my previous visit).  We received 13 courses; seven of the dishes were the same on both visits, with the new ones likely based on seasonality and availability of ingredients.  I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get the Mushroom Hot Pot this time, which was mind-blowing in its deliciousness despite its simplicity, but all of dishes we received this visit were obviously prepared fresh to order, beautifully presented, generous in portion size, and amazingly satisfying.  Service throughout our meal was attentive and our meal was well-paced/sequenced, which was a feat worth mentioning since our food was coming out of three separate kitchens.  While very pricey, Zuma's omakase game is strong and I highly recommend it as it offers a good cross-section of everything that Zuma offers.  In my opinion, Zuma continues to be the best kept food secret in the Cosmo.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,4,3,5,FRbOHoMmX35XeM0ypMuYDQ

5094792,2017-05-19,16,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"If PF Chang is your idea of Chinese food, you'll love this Japanese version.

Heavily Americanized, contemporary interpretation of Japanese cuisine prettied up and priced for the Vegas Strip.  The concept isn't new.  Essentially a copy cat of Nobu or Morimoto's.  Navigate the menu carefully and the quality may surprise you.

Straight up, this is NOT a sushi bar, skip the sashimi and sushi.  The fish is of average quality and masked by sauces.  The hamachi topped with green chili relish and sitting in ponzu was totally overpowered, all the subtle sweetness of the fish lost.  Rolls look like it was the ""chef's"" first try at making them.   Uneven thickness, fillings not centered, sliced at odd angles and formed with different amounts of pressure so some pieces are densely packed and others fall apart.  The flavor of the dynamite spider roll (soft shell crab) was nothing special.  

Tip:   Dishes are meant to be shared.  

The signature roasted lobster with shiso ponzu butter is very good.  Perfectly cooked, still translucent on the inside, cold water lobster with a hollandaise like butter sauce.  The more delicate flavor of ponzu blended with the herbaceous shiso greatly enhance the sweetness of the flesh.  A similar ""sauce"" is used with the charcoal grilled king crab leg with ponzu lime butter with equal success.

Continuing with grilled items, the jumbo tiger prawn (U2 - U4 size) shell split to expose the flesh for grilling, excellent especially when finished with yuzu pepper.  The aroma from the pepper brings it to life.  The crisp grilled branzino fillet with burnt tomato ginger relish also fantastic.  Crispy skin, flaky flesh bordering on over cooked but who cares, isn't that how grilled fish should be?  The bitterness of the burnt areas blend very well with spicy ginger relish.

Finally, the lobster tempura.  Very good.  Spot on cooking to keep the very bland batter crisp but the inside tender and juicy.  The spicy ponzu cuts through the oily finish and brightens up the lobster.  The wasabi mayo, somewhat cloying but good wasabi kick.

Lots of craft cocktails, OK sake, wine, and beer.  The bold flavors of the dishes pair with anything.  High resort markup.

Good service but there is still some clumsiness when explaining menu items.

Overall, not bad.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,20,22,4,OMeSlzrMVUQYDtHVzTd9wA

The ingredients stay true to Japanese food, but done in new ways.  Definitely worth a visit if your looking for a premium meal in a hip/casual environment.

Highlights, the miso cod, flavorful without being overly sauced and a pretty good portion.  Tempura was perfectly done, nicely presented and dashi (sauce was flavored with shiso and grated diakon)...just like home cooking, but with a twist.  Cocktails were excellent, again containing some Japanese ingredients, cleverly combined with traditional ingredients.  And a surprise banana cake for our anniversary desert was amazing.

The hochicko and Norisan were also pretty good.
The food on the other hand wasn't too memorable. The glazed ribs were ok in flavor but weren't very tender. The mushroom hot pot was pretty bland - mushrooms had a nice texture and it was light, but it lacked in flavor overall. Bright spot was the sweet corn, had a nice sauce.

First atmospherics, the custom groove music playlist perfectly volume synced to the crowd buzz level? Check.  Ample service team running around supervised by aloof/hipster floor managers? Yup.  High end dining room dark enough so you can't read the menu prices? That's the plan.  And most important a beehive of customers shelling out American moolah by the Ben Franklins. That's the whole idea.   I must say that besides good food and on point service, the most important part of creating a great dining experience is You!  And a lot more beautiful people like you!   The energy in a dining room comes from the customers who animate and fill the place with buzz.  That's the magic elusive ingredient that blends and masks everything to a smooth endorphin feeling meal.  Ok, so Zuma got all of that in spades. 
Food.   Above average sushi bar.  Once you got two choices for Toro (chuu and oo) you know they got the Chefs and suppliers from the A level to make almost everything.  Another markers is Japanese uni (Hokkaido) vs. the us west coast version.  Smaller darker gonads that are more sweeter and intense without the funkiness than their bigger American cousins.   So give the sushi bar a A-.  What's missing is 4-5 unique kinds of fish or shellfish.  They did have kimidai which is a kind of snapper and their scallops are from Hokkaido so they do get points. 
Kitchen does a great job with a wide and diverse menu.   Mixing Robata, tempura and hot dishes in with the usual high end starters.  As others have said, kind of riffs on Morimoto or Nobu signature dishes.  Nothing super new and I personally did not like the basil/shiso flavoring of their creamier gratin dishes.  Miso Porkbelly skewers did stand out in my mind.  Also the giant grilled prawn a better choice than the lobster.  Another A-.   At this price and execution level you can't really go wrong with any dish.  
Bar. Now here they get a solid A!   Very creative and eclectic menu for cocktails.  Got to get the Burning History.  Kind of a Japanese whisky sour complete with torched MaCallan whisky stave.   And hand chipped clear ice to boot!  This was done well and at tableside for the ohhh factor.  Another one is the fish in the bag gin tonic presentation.  Winna!
So if you got some cash to burn it's better to waste it here than lose it on the first floor.   At least you will have a full tummy and a great fun memory.  All you get downstairs is regrets!",rNy2uc39H9kkgn3yMAvr_w,1,0,5,DchEF45sNJy8Xb6F_IZGqQ

Zuma is located on Level 3 of the Boulevard Tower at The Cosmopolitan resort casino and hotel which is a great spot to be. Definitely one of my favorite hotels in the city. We started with the Prawn and Black Cod Dumplings which were terrific definitely one of the best appetizers on the menu. We also tried the Kurobuta Pork Belly Skewers which came in a close second place. In 3rd place came the Tempura Assorted Vegetables which were really good. We made these three dishes our appetizers and we had no complaints.
For our entrées we ordered the Salmon that had a Teriyaki Kyuri Zoe sauce and sliced pickled cucumber. This dish was middle of the road and up to par but lacked something. I feel like they could do a little better with this dish. The dish that they hit a homerun with was the Kobuta Ribs Yawaraka Nikomi. They are glazed ribs with cashew nut and scallions. They were delicious and everyone at the table was very happy with them, good job Zuma!
As far as complaints go my first is that they need to stay open later this is Las Vegas not Utah. Not only is this Las Vegas but the restaurant is located in the Cosmo which is one of the hippest casinos in the city so it's really frustrating that they close the restaurant side at 11 PM the bar doesn't close until midnight but what good is that when you go there for a late dinner and then told that the kitchen is closed down but you could have a drink at the bar. Long story short the kitchen needs to stay open later. The only other complaint that I have is that they need their own Wi-Fi.

Pulse pounding music is meant to distract you from the fact that you are being served some fairly ordinary Japanese dishes that have been retrofitted to the ""tapas"" concept that every supposedly ""innovative"" chef is using as ""new"" and ""modern"" despite that fact that some cultures have been eating this way for eternity.  Oh well, since most of their intended customers have never actually experienced other cultures, I'm sure it's impressive to them.  The most important thing is to take pictures of what you been served and post it on your favorite social media account with the caption ""The BEST thing I've ever experienced.  I'm HERE and you're NOT.  I'm BETTER than you.""  Unfortunately, the food is served in large dishes (strictly for presentation) on small tables and no effort is made to pace your order (as that would involve some actual thought and restaurant management skills).  This makes for a very uncomfortable dining experience.  You could try and discuss this with your companions but you'd have to literally scream over the blaring non-stop electronic music.  Perhaps they would prefer that you tweet your thoughts to your dinner guests.  But at least you can have all this for about $150/person.

The quality of ingredients and menus are pretty equal, but the sexy ambience and décor are what take it up a level for an improved dining experience.   Four visits in the past year with two of them being special occasions (Valentine's and my wife's choice for her birthday) make it obvious I enjoy being there.

""Lobster No Oven Yaki"", roasted lobster with shizo-ponzu butter, is presented beautifully and tastes spectacular.   I dug into the head of the lobster face first for that money flavor both times we had this, felt no shame whatsoever, and actually feel bad for people who don't do it.  

Another eye-rollingly good dish is the ""Yaki Taraba Gani"".  The simple menu description of ""King Crab with Ponzu Lime Butter"" really should add something like ""Whitney Houston Crack"" or ""Fuck money, eat this"" because it's awesome.  You're really only looking at maybe 5 or 6 bites at best and that last piece is definitely worth fighting for.  I'd suggest rock/paper/scissors, but a stun gun works too. 

And the mustX1000 order for the table is always the ""Salmon and Tuna Tartare"".  That amazing box of such glorious fish is something I cannot get enough of.  It comes with chips for scooping, but I feel like they get in the way of my enjoyment.  Get a spoon and dive in!  

The biggest issues have been with the timing of the food.  With multiple kitchens going (robata, sushi, etc), I could see how it wouldn't be easy for a server to manage.   We've had side dishes come out 10- 15 minutes ahead of entrees, hot dishes come out before starters, and all it did was clutter the table with stuff we weren't ready for.

Love: 
Beef Tenderloin 
Black cod !!!! 
Porkbelly skewers 
Yellowtail with radish - cold dish 
Mai tai cocktail 

Dislike:
Rock shrimp tempura - tasted fishy 

If you get the beef tenderloin or black cod, make sure you order a veggie dish to offset all that protein. Dishes come as soon as they're ready so that's a plus but sometimes you want to pick at multiple dishes at once and that didn't happen... seemed like everything came out one dish at a time. The waitress recommended 4-5 dishes per person but we were stuffed after 2-3 dishes each.

5558380,2017-05-08,0,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"This place was absolutely amazing from beginning to end. We had a large group and they were able to comfortably accommodate us on a Saturday night. The food was not only beautifully presented but delicious. There was not a single bad item. Everything was so good, but I would definitely recommend the skewers and dessert. If nothing else, get the lava cake and custard dessert. I've never had a more delicious lava cake... it was probably the best I've ever had any where. The custard was so amazing with the matching fruit purée. Just thinking about it makes me drool. 

The service was also amazing. They really want you to have a wonderful experience and work to accommodate all your requests (even adjusting the air to reduce draft to the table). 

This restaurant definitely shot to the top of my restaurant list and would recommend to anyone looking for an amazing dining experience accompanied by melt in your mouth food!",uARJ8P1wQyrKut_AQNOT0g,1,1,5,vpOyLUN0hWa2C5p2nAwQjA
5558527,2017-06-07,0,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"I'm pretty sure I ordered almost half the menu for our party (even if I can't remember every plate, I definitely remember the bill) and I can say that everything was pretty marvelous. A little Americanized as I wish it had more of the traditional items you would find at a hole in the wall izakaya, but nonetheless it was an indulging and fragrant meal for all the senses to enjoy. 

Seafood is where they shine here, don't be tempted by the meat selections they keep pushing on you. My favorites dishes were the king crab with ponzu lime butter (it's just the crab claws mostly), rock shrimp tempura, scallops with pickled plum and shiso, branzino with burnt tomato, and grilled sea bass. If you could only pick two from that list, I would probably recommend the branzino and tiger prawn in terms of the price/worth/belly-satiating ability.  

Whether it's raw or cooked, everything was fresh and carefully constructed. I'm not usually one to 'follow' a dish's components such as utilizing the accompanying trio of dipping sauces or garnishing with a lemon, but at Zuma, every time you see a bed of rock salt, lime, mustard, relish or anything else on that plate - just do it. It really does complete the dish and as a majority of the dishes have sauces that are heavily butter-based, it really helps to cut the heaviness with added acidity, crunch and various tangs of saltiness. When it comes to the Japanese, they surprisingly love all things mayo, butter and cheese. Wanna indulge like them? Get the sweetcorn with shiso butter. Just walk the strip 3 times afterwords.   

I will say Zuma is not for everyone. My prime rib loving boyfriend would not have the common sense to appreciate this place. This is a different atmosphere that asks for patience and minimalism from the customer. Plates will come out one by one at the chef's leisure and portions are Izakaya style (think Spanish tapas). This also means that they're meant to be shared so if you suffer from only-child-syndrome or have territorial issues when it comes to your food (I empathize), it's either time for a lifestyle change or order multiple of each plate. That's not to say that each dish was light - some like the crab dish and rib-eye felt pretty heavy in the stomach despite it's miniature size. These types of plates are not meant to stand alone, but to accompany your alcoholism as the Japanese do so after a long day of work. Thus, this is definitely a place to go all out on your liquid intake more so than your food intake if you want the full experience. If you have an appetite that needs to be satisfied all at once or just love meat more than our ocean friends, I would suggest you going across to STK.
 
Also, just for kicks I normally like to order something simple to judge how fresh the ingredients are and tried their salmon nigiri - no soy sauce. If eyes could roll into the back of your head and come back to focus in a complete 360 degrees - that's what I think happened to me that night. I almost thought I was eating the seared belly of a salmon. It was like pure Salmon bacon that a part of my soul never knew it was missing.",sYPuLHkyWjOjjNPYgrkt-Q,1,1,4,959nlkrgENKVS4-yH5ltnw

Although we had made reservations, we were being so well taken care of & having such fun talking to Brian &Jose we decided to eat dinner at the the bar.  Their food recommendations were spot on.

We started off with a BURNING HISTORY cocktail.  The crafting & presentation of the drink was a Vegas show in itself!  Jose filled a glass with smoke from a burning stave from a seasoned from a whiskey barrel.  He then added a hand crafted ice cube, house dehydrated orange, and sun Tori took whiskey shaken with honey, ginger, yuzu, and egg whites.  Delicious!

I would also recommend asking for a Penicillin Shot (not on the menu): Scotch, lemon, fresh ginger, & honey).

Favorites: 
SPICY BEEF TENDERLOIN 
GIANT PRAWN ROBATA
SHITAKE MUSHROOMS
PORK BELLY SKEWER

You can't beat the great service, the positive energy, the fresh flavors and quality foods at Zuma.  One of if not the best meals I've had in Las Vegas.

The disappointing part of the evening came with the food.  Started with the yellow tail and sea bass appetizers.  Not spectacular, but certainly very good.   The high point of the meal was the watercress salad - it was truly exceptional.  Most of the main courses were very tasteless, highlighted by the miso cod.  It had virtually no flavor on its own, and with the sauce it was only slightly better.  We didn't even feel the need to finish it, something I never remember doing with any miso cod.  A mushroom side was also suggested, that was so salty, there was no trace of mushroom taste.  We ended with a roll, and very limited flavor, and what flavor was there, was not the greatest.

Also not thrilled at all with the drinks.  Had two martinis - very small pours, and very little alcohol.  Tasted like I was drinking only juice.

We had looked very forward to Zuma opening, as loved Blue Ribbon at Cosmo, and was looking for another choice that rivaled, Nobu, Sushisamba, etc.  Sorry to say Zuma did not even hold a candle to these.  We will not be returning.",Y0qhtu7hHefyYctCLpExTA,4,0,3,n3-shnC78JLvdjol49ycaA

I promise it will stir up many positive conversations, explode your taste buds with fresh seafood goodness, and make you insanely happy. There's too many tempting things on the menu to only stick to one or two items anyway! Just GET EM ALL! Haha. 

It brings you an array of items fresh from the sea such as sashimi, tartar, the most tender juicy beef you'll chew up, fish, prawn, soft shell crab, and so much more that I actually can't even remember so you'll have to see for yourself! Oh and of course they end the course on the BIGGEST sweet note I've ever had in my 23 years of LIFE! Seriously. 

A few highlights from their tasting menu shared amongst my lovely group of 6 was the sashimi, a thick piece of incredibly buttery cod (I think it was, I may be wrong, I just remember it was FABULOUS), the tartar mashed up to perfection served with crispy chips, a jumbo prawn that is the biggest piece of shrimp I've ever eaten, meaty soft shell crab served with a creamy wasabi mayo, and the ginormous boat featuring an array of what I believe was all their desserts! One of the gelatos within this dessert boat was red like raspberry but had a strong hint of wasabi, super unique and actually tastes better than it sounds haha.

5676426,2018-02-26,0,nbQH8MXjxqsDzHRNTZ8esQ,"Food: izakaya birthday dinner with the hubby. I thought it was just ok. Reminded me of Morimoto's in Napa. We had the basic omakase since the upgraded one had lobster and caviar and other things I don't care for. It was honestly too much food. Plus it didn't help that he asked if we ""would like the edamame"", which sounded like it was free but it was not. The winners were:

- spicy edamame (flavorful, large portion)
- miso sea bass (melt in your mouth)
- steak (delicious marinade with red pepper flakes or shichimi maybe and toasted sesame seeds on top) drool. 
- grilled asparagus 
- grilled scallops (ask for it without butter. The butter was out of place and messed up a gorgeous scallop)

I was kinda annoyed because I told our waiter I don't like wasabi and yet 3-4 of our dishes contained a dipping creme or creme on top that was mixed with wasabi and he didn't think that counted, so that was super unpleasant for me and made me feel pissy. 

Ambiance: 
Tables are tight together but it's fun to watch the open habachi kitchen. 

Service:
Our waiter was attentive, but a stream of different servers bring you your food and some are not very good at telling you what the dish is and what is in it. They also need to change the hostesses outfits. They are the most horrendous skirts ever. Supes ugs and doesn't even go with the Asian theme of the food.

There is the normal dysfunction between the front of the house and the kitchen for the first week.

Our server was waiting on food, thus we all ate our main courses at different times. There doesn't need to be 6 managers focused on turning tables. They should put one in the kitchen expediting the food and ensuring everyone gets their food on time and hot. 

The management finally realized that we hadn't gotten all of our food and comped our last order.

But for real, so good it's ridiculous. I feel like we spoiled ourselves to pretty much every other sushi place ever because this is just top notch quality. Your taste buds will sing  praises, your wallet will cry. But WORTH! 

Note: portions are minuscule! It is basically like tapas but smaller. Example, I ordered the king crab and it was I believe 42$ and what came was about 2 ounces of meat, with a finger licking butter sauce. If you can afford to pay to get teased , go for it, if not , skip that plate as it was crazy how small it was lol, that said - I would eat it again and again and again? 

The semi fatty tuna and salmon nigiri  I still have dreams about it. The ribs literally fell off the bone, delicious would be an insult. 

Only thing I didn't like was salmon and tuna tartar, not the actual fish as it was yummy but it was accompanied by rice cakes to use as dipping things and the tastes just clashed. 

Talking about accompaniments, use and eat everything that comes with it, it's meant that way! Except the rice crackers lol. Example, lime came with ribs , squeezed it all over the ribs and they were elevated in taste. 

Soft shell crab was amazing and came with wasabi mayo which is best mayo. 

How to get here? Go to the cosmopolitan hotel, park in self parking and go near the area with signs for Boulevard Tower Elevators and park there ! There's signs so you know what floor the restaurant is on and you exit the elevator super close by so easy to get to and don't have to walk across entire casino if that is a factor.

Now for that price, I expect a meal to be absolutely perfect, but there were a few things we found to be poorly executed that brought our experience down a notch.

I think the thing that bothered us the most was the noise level, which is extremely loud dance music.  I know it's Vegas, but it was simply louder than we expected for such a high end meal.  DO NOT come here expecting a quiet romantic meal.  

The food was all very good, but not $500 meal level good.  The presentation was spot on, but various itmes were sub par.  The sushi portion, for example, was good but not transcendent like you would expect at this price point.

Food volume and pacing were also an issue.  We were literally served 15 separate dishes.  This made for a very uneven pace to the meal (longer than 2 hours with long gaps between courses) and my wife and I felt like we were going to die from how much we ate.  I wish we had gotten fewer dishes of higher quality.

The service was immaculate and I can't say enough about how nice the staff were.  

The decor was great, especially the main bar which is one solid tree trunk, so cool!

I first went to Zuma for my bachelorette/30th birthday with a group of about 7 girls and we were instantly greeted with a smile and professionalism.
