955084,2017-03-30,0,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,"Yesterday, March 29, 2017, my daughter and I decided we were hungry and wanted to order delivery, but we both had appetites for different foods. I chose pizza, she chose Mexican cuisine. She wanted Carne Asada fries and was able to find La Taqueria through Uber eats. I placed an order for two carne asada fries. The total came to $23, roughly, but that was including the $5 booking fee charged by the uber eats service. Delivery was prompt. Super fast, to be honest.

The carne asada fries come with the marinated grilled steak, cheese, onions, tomatoes, and guacamole. I thought sour cream was to be included, as well, but didn't detect any. These ingredients were served atop crinkle cut fries. My daughter also requested sides of jalapeños, cilantro, and extra onions, which were free of charge. 

The food arrived hot, presentation was OK, but it looked appealing enough. For the price, (about $16 and some change) the portion size is perfect. Lot's of fries, a decent serving of the steak, cheese, and other items. 

Now, for the taste. Both my daughter and I thought the food was really good. We tossed the jalapeños, cilantro, and onion onto the fries and loved the combination of flavors! The only complaint I have is that there were too many hard, grisly parts in the steak. I did not enjoy having to chew, only to bite down on grizzle, and have to spit it out (sorry, don't mean to be disgusting). I also wish the meat was more tender. But other than that, it was money well spent. We also received more than enough plastic forks, knives, and napkins, without having requested they be included. And the best thing about these fries were that they were awesome the next day, today! I removed the tomato and onion, placed the fries, steak, etc into an oven dish, heated on 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, took them out, placed them back into the container they arrived in, and topped with the condiments. Honestly, I think they were better today than they were when we first received them. Yum!!! So, so good! 

This place gets no less than 4 stars from my daughter and I. I know, without a doubt, we'll return in the future, maybe to try some of their other menu items. The final verdict? I definitely recommend to others!",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,4,zg1YGXr1eB9kzRCj3kmK0w

There are menu items you won't really find at other typical Mexican restaurants like tacos ahogados or avotacos. The staff and owners are friendly which makes me feel comfortable coming back as a customer. Although I dislike its location, it gives me a reason to even go to the mall, but it would be great if this restaurant opened other locations. As far as the food goes you can't go wrong. From the typical street tacos to the homemade rice and beans, this place is great to satisfy your Mexican food cravings. And if you're hungover, you can't go wrong with chilaquiles.",OVVKRouK7C5gV2m2BDTCpA,0,0,5,RmcW3FwOm3dgVe08EN-XqA

This place is located inside the boulevard mall food court. DONT PASS THIS PLACE UP! I am salivating like crazy just writing this :-/",ltUb21ZilinnvIjGbO9FAQ,1,1,5,EOOQTCoNprv4Qdft1vkYBw

Mind you, I'm also 5 months pregnant and ended up in the ER at midnight with horrible cramps. Ordered the taco combo and husband got the nachos. He felt nauseous as well, but luckily never got sick. I have never once got food poisoning, so I don't have a weak stomach. I eat anything and everything, but never again will I eat from here. Huge mistake, and cost me a scary ER visit with my baby, and $150 copay... which was worth it to make sure Baby was ok. Still feeling a little aches but luckily no more of the real fun symptoms.",EiBrzfhx2m0GrP4lXQwoxg,0,0,1,8rHBQx0PRyG33rt_Sa8ZZQ
1121264,2015-07-02,0,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,"I was in the mall and decided to give this place a try rather than my favorite place at the food court. Unfortunately, the burrito was just average. The texture was good and it was huge. However, it was huge because it was stuffed with a ton of rice and beans. Where was the meat? There was just a little bit of the meat, so it tasted like a vegetarian burrito. The service was good, but I'm disappointed.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,1,0,3,Blu5mMpgq_B4MbsaRFvZ9A
1206639,2014-10-25,0,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,"If you're looking for authentic flavor, but in a hurry this is THE place! My personal favorites are the Carne Asada Fries and some Empanadas!  The fries are so big that it is definitely a two person job!  Everything is fresh and made to order!  Also has lots of healthy options for those of us watching our figures, so that makes it even better for me.  I feel like I get my cheat in without doing any actual damage.  Good stuff all the way around!",Jk99Z6k2yHXwQ-uLNTG41g,1,0,4,VD3a8gQYGxyGUYQNy-oU-A
1320468,2014-10-25,0,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,Hands down the quickest and most authentic Mexican food I have ever had in the Boulevard Mall at the food court of all places!!

2062803,2017-01-11,0,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,"I had their food via delivery service. The food was pretty good! I've had better in town for this type of Mexican restaurant. I ordered their wet burrito with beans and rice. The burrito and the wet sauce was a little bland for my taste but still good. (That's with having ordered mild and medium salsa)

*TO THE BUSINESS: Please improve your packaging for your food! It arrived in a complete disaster and was spilling and dripping all over the place.  A styrofoam plate with loosely covered foil wrap and a styrofoam box for a WET burrito is unacceptable for food delivery or carry out! My burrito had no sauce by the time it arrived bc it was all leaked out.",DqH1yK5mk7aYeF9PYk9ilw,1,0,3,QuJ-ihPlleou3zTZJ7OroA

2913188,2014-11-13,0,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,"This place is exquisite. Normally I wouldn't expect much from a restaurant in the mall, but La Taqueria is full of flavor. The food is fresh and tastes like a lovingly prepared homemade cooked meal.  Items on the menu include the very traditional sopas, empanadas, enchiladas; there are also original items like the avotacos. The food is seasoned with signature sauces that you won't find anywhere else. La Taqueria introduces large traditional Jalisco meals at very reasonable prices.",XnQNQxlYx-4kp2c_QTFyTw,0,0,5,C84OacUs2KkQrVOFQV4cZw

I mean the topping were good, the meat was tender and flavorful, but the chips were kind of chewy. The same with the fries all was good but the fries could have cooked longer. Will definitely order again. Next time we'll try the tacos and burritos",CL3ufYrsVeBoqGPjDeVEsg,0,0,4,JS8Sxd3yuSBo_DeGLhIwpw

Beef, rice beans, pico, guaq, mild salsa, garnished with some fresh squeezed lime for each bite.  All I have to say is WTF, why is this place in a mall.  The food is awesome.  From what I have ordered there has always been a balance of fresh flavors.  You guys rock, I will return to try more items on the menu.",Pl1YRXDibRLFADVH2hTx7A,0,0,5,3zuzI4-9pD9igIhdMEgBfA

4511679,2015-11-24,8,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,"La Taqueria is located in the food court of the Boulevard Mall.  It may never rate a Michelin star, but it far surpassed what I would have expected from food court fair.

Most fast food Mexican restaurant give you a choice of hard or soft taco shells.  If it's a slightly better place they might even give you the option of flour or corn tortillas.  La Taqueria takes things just one step farther, offering you the option to eat your tacos on lettuce shells.  This is fantastic news for those who've chosen to go gluten free.  For me, it was just a very healthy and very tasty option that elevated my simple order of tacos with carnitas into something a little more special.   I ordered a plate of 3 lettuce tacos, each of which came on a very large leaf of what appeared to be romaine lettuce.  The lettuce was crisp and fresh, and was showing no signs of having been out of the cooler before my tacos were made.  I headed over to the salsa bar which had three different kinds of salsa and a variety of other veggies.  There was a mild red, medium red, and a green salsa.  There were chopped onions, chopped cilantro, sliced limes, whole radished, pickled jalapeno slices, and some kind of pickled onion or radish to choose from.  I loaded up my tacos with fresh condiments and headed for the tables to try them out.

Mmmmm.... Cool Crispy crunchy lettuce, warm tender moist carnitas, spicy salsa, juicy pico de gallo... These were damn good tacos for a food court.  I must admit the atmosphere is standard food court with a sterile feel and completely lacking in any character, but the food makes up for it in spades.  It was a fresh and tasty lunch that felt pretty healthy compared to some of the other stuff we ate in Vegas and I left feeling pretty satisfied.",WqrwIIhDfNpf_B-K9jx4KA,9,11,4,ePi2A98G6gYqeGxBUKuIIQ
4794954,2018-01-23,0,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,The food here is absolutely horrible. I got a bean and cheese burrito that was completely oily and a taco that looks disgusting. I was missing items including the sauce that goes on my Burrito as well as sour cream and guacamole that I paid extra for. My food is also very cold.,6uz2ySNhGxHcbxYXBS4g9w,0,0,1,SIWU7U8m1r8yTMmX96M2bQ

5819965,2015-04-21,1,z85R3JrM5xkudu2SZxObPQ,"I wish I could say something good about this place but sadly I'll never get to know if the food is any good because of the cashiers horrible attitude. God forbid if you have any questions about how the food is served or special request to have the taco toppings placed on the side. All your questions get you is attitude and a sense that they want nothing to do with answering your questions let alone serve you. I've never seen such a small mom and pop shop with poor customer service considering they depend on your business to remain open. All I wanted was 2 avotacos with the lettuce, cream and cheese on the side. They made me feel like I was asking for a million dollars. I'll probably try again earlier in the day when you can expect people to have a decent, welcoming attitude.",v3in4pF9w0wxtPNF09za5Q,1,0,1,uJCIYXY7zEQjXf_dzTql5g
