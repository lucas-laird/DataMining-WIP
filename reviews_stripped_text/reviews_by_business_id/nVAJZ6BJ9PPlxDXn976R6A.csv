So on 10-25-12 at about 10:30am I stoped by for a quick bite to eat; and when I walk inside the lines were from the register to the door. Needless to say I made an about face and went to the drive through. Considering the lines inside I thought I would be waiting quite a bit in the drive through lane. That however was not the case. I did have to wait but it was noting like you would expect from approx 7-9 cars lined up. My order was not mixed-up, everything was the way I ordered it, and the food was still hot when I receieved it.

We don't have In-N-Out Burger here on the east coast, so when in Las Vegas, we figured we had to go.  There is no good way to get there if you are on the strip.  Even though it is down the street from the strip, you pretty much have to take a cab.  Sadly the cab ride is more expensive then the food itself.  But I guess that is part of the experience.  When we got there the line was literally out the door.  This scared us, but the line did move pretty fast.  My husband ordered the double double animal style, I ordered the cheeseburger meal with fries and a drink.  I did not get animal style as I wasn't sure if I would like the sauce or not.  I should have gotten cheese fries, but I didn't.  While my husband was waiting to get our order, I searched and searched for a seat.  Finally I was able to grab a seat in the corner.  

When my husband brought our food to the table, it looked good.  I am glad I got the cheeseburger and not the double double, as it was just enough for me.  The bun was fresh and soft and slightly warm, the burger was extremely juicy, and the special sauce complimented the burger nicely.  The burger also had a good amount of lettuce and tomatoes on it.  The abundance of fries was just right.  My husband's double double animal style was double meat, double cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles.   He too was very pleased with this meal.  In-N-Out is known for all fresh ingredients, never frozen.  I have to say I enjoyed it and thought it was much better than a five guys.  Since everyone is pretty much taking a cab to get to In-N-Out, it is pretty easy to get a cab back.

traveling by bus from the strip will cost you $1.75 each way.  the wait for the bus was never more than 10 minutes.  keep in mind, that the bus fees are different from the bus fees on the ""deuce"" bus, which is $3 each way.

The cab driver actually said he gets a ton of people from the strip who just want him to drive to In-N-Out. He was right as there were a ton of cabs cycling through the parking lot which made it easy to get one to drive us back to our hotel. I was ecstatic to try this place as I am a huge Five Guys fan and wanted to compare the two for myself. 

I was so disappointed. When I order a hamburger, I am looking for something that I know is detrimental to my health. It's a hamburger! The burgers at Five Guys are greasy as hell and give me a stomach ache after I consume one. I ordered the animal here and it honestly just seemed too healthy to me. It was good but it didn't satisfy that burger craving. I can see how people like In-N-Out over Five Guys but it really just depends on personal preferences and I just happen to be on the other side of the fence.",F8yemVpDI3bF2Y3ok449hw,3,0,2,Vrw5pzljMWoKGDgqct6ZZA

I was staying at the Mandalay Bay, and i heard from people that it's walkable, but it was so hot (May '09) i didnt want to melt to death on my way there and not taste those amazing animal style fries before i die, so i took a cab. Got on the cab, didnt want to risk the cab driver driving away or keep the meter running, so we went through the drive thru and drove right back to the hotel. I dont think the round trip was more than $15, might have even been like $10. Either way, it was worth it. 

My usual is double double animal style with animal style fries. At first i thought that the animal style fries would be over doing it, but i have to say if there is one bad thing about In-N-Out is their fries, kinda plain. I guess i'm just used to the greased up mcdonalds fries :P but when it's topped with cheese, thousand island-like dressing and grilled onions?? heaven.

My friend really wanted to try In-N-Out and so we went.
Took the RTC bus 201 on Tropicana Rd.  Took us across the high way.  In-N-Out is right there.  Cannot miss it.  Convenient.  

The burgers were yummy.  Fries were a little bit different, but its a good different.  Fries were cut thinly like McDonald's. They were crispy, but not greasy. There is a nice texture to it.  Its made fresh from Idaho potatoes.  
Overall, In-N-Out reminds me of 5 guys.  Fast food joints that specialized in burgers.  So, if you are craving for CHEAP, but GOOD burgers go to In-N-Out.  

This place is SUPER popular.  There were TWO long lines that snaked around the restaurant.  One line is to order.  The other is to wait for the food.  The Drive-Thru line wasn't any better.  Cars were lined up and waiting for their food.  Wow!! 

Customers waited calmly and patiently for their food.  No one argued or acted out.  Usually, people get testy when they have to wait for their food. Phenomenal!!

Its a fast food place and there were tons of people there.  So, the restrooms must be super nasty correct? WRONG.  The restrooms were super clean and tidy.  Amazing!

Don't get me wrong, its okay, but I was expecting Greatness due to all the hype this place always get. I got ""Animal Style."" Which is just some chopped grilled onions mixed with some 1,000 island sort of sauce. We ordered four meals including shakes and our bill came out just over $20. So if I were to judge based on price alone, it would be a 5star, because you can't find $5 meals to fill you in much places.

There were about 6 people in line when we got in and the line wrapped around the store by the time we got our food. There has to be some reason behind this, right? Time to find out..

I never discussed this place with anyone, but for some reason ""double double animal style"" was implanted in my head from somewhere.. o_0 so I ordered whatever it was, along with a side of fries. 

The burger consisted of cheese, grilled onions, pickles, tartar sauce(? or some type of sauce), and two patties. Them patties are thin! Man, the pics on the menu are deceiving. They make the burger look so juicy, succulent, and filling! The fries I could've done without. They were bland and the texture reminded me of styrofoam, of which my sister confirmed.  

All in all, the burger was alright.. nothing spectacular. Personally, I'd prefer Five Guys or Smashburger over this. Hmm, service was decent and efficient, so our orders weren't screwed up which is a plus (yay!).",74MEs3l1jQTaBPpOgv8t7w,0,0,3,Juz0toCleU1_FtlnAYbMKw

Terri was the exact opposite of customer service, and they completely messed up my order despite verbally repeating it accurately back at me (the receipt mismatched with my order).

When I started making my order, Terri repeatedly interrupted me with redundant questions, which held up the already huge line behind me (the line curved into the dining area). To make matters worse, Terri scoffed at some points of my order (I was ordering a veggie burger, which is pretty common considering I'm not the only vegetarian/vegan in the world). I had to ask Terri to repeat my order, but they spoke waaay too fast. I had to ask Terri to repeat my order again at a normal pace, which held up the huge line even longer. Just when I thought this couldn't get worse, Terri literallly talked back to me when I asked for my receipt (I felt really sorry for the people waiting in line). Seriously? It's just a piece of paper. Chill.

So guess what? Despite Terri repeating my order accurately, the receipt showed a completely differently order. I had to ask for the pickles when my order was ready, and I guess Terri really didn't want me to get french fries. It's okay, I got fries from Jack-in-the-Box instead.

I haven't been to an In-N-Out since I was a teenager. It's also been a good 5 or so years since I've pretty much stopped eating fast food. With that being said, the bathing suit portion of my trip was over so I was a little excited to indulge a little.  

There was a line wrapped around the building but it didn't take more than 5 minutes to order. It probably took about 15 minutes to actually get our food. I had requested the animal sauce on the side, however they put it on my double-double anyways. I was not waiting for them to fix their mistake so just took it. I also got an order of fries. 

So it tasted like a fast food burger. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. I absolutely did. I just didn't have that east coast girl meets west coast burger euphoric experience. Although to be honest, I didn't love the animal sauce. A little too creamy/mayo-like for me. I would have preferred if my burger wasn't smothered in it. 

Big plus: it was probably the food I ate all weekend that wasn't overpriced.

The burgers were cheap,$1.69 for a cheese burger, which along with their tasty fare is probably the reason for their success.

Hamburgers are very good.  French fries not so much.  And you would think the milk shakes would be made with ice cream, but alas no milk shake mixers here.  It's from a machine like Mickey D's.

If you've ever had french fries from Five Guys, those are GREAT french fries.  These were bland french fries.  I guess people get them animal style to make them tolerable.

In n Out is as consistent as they get. I have never been to a location where the food and service slightly varied. Always hot, fresh, cooked to order burgers and fries. I usually get a single with cheese and spread only.  When hungrier I get the double double. 

What you need to know about this location, is that it may be the busiest In n Out there is, and that is saying a lot because they are all busy. Being that this one is very close to the Vegas strip, you can imagine it is busy at all hours. If you want to avoid the rush, you might be able to at 10:30a when they open. That said, the location is run well like all of them, so it is well staffed and they handle the massive volumes just fine. The seating is usually full, but usually by the time your food is ready enough tables will free up that you can grab one, as long as you are paying attention. When I ate here yesterday I ended up joining another couple that was at a table of four. Not an uncommon practice at this location. Parking can also be limited, but usually not a problem. You will see people at this location pull up in Ubers or taxis on their way to or from the airport. People love it so much some can't even wait to get to their hotel before grabbing a burger there.

The place is totally packed, but they are fast there.  The long line goes by fast and once you order, they cook your food quickly.  Which is key.  Waiting there when you see all the other people eating those amazing burgers while the smell is everywhere is torture.  

We each had two cheeseburgers and split fries and a shake. I actually prefer 2 cheeseburgers to a double double.  Thats just me in general.  I don't usually order double cheeseburgers anywhere.  Same with shake shack, I get regular cheeseburgers.   As soon as I took a burger out and bit into it, the rental car expense and the yearning was completely validated.  The bun is great, and the sauce tastes really good.  Ketchup / mayo combination?  Tastes kinda like Big Mac sauce only better.  Technically , I'm not sure how good the actual patty is - it's pretty thin and cooked throughout..but it's fast food and tastes amazing mixed with the cheese, lettuce, tomato, sauce and bun.. 

The fries are made right there when they put these potatoes through some sort of machine that slices them up, and they are delicious without being too greasy.

It just amazes me that for 2 people to eat this meal, it was like 12 bucks.  It actually depresses me that they don't have this on the east coast and I will have to wait until I go back to vegas or somewhere else out west to experience in n out again.

I would say it was soo worth it!! At first I was hesitant to walk here because when you search on Google maps, you basically see that it's located near a highway and think it's not pedestrian friendly and may not be safe. However, there IS an underpass (??) for pedestrians to get here...although definitely NOT kid-friendly. 

***TIP***

To get here, you should stay on the side of the Excalibur hotel

Anyways, I got two Double Double, Fries (Animal Style!!) and a large Neopolitan Shake. It was EXTREMELY busy but the staff were friendly, pleasant, and VERY hardworking. Finally got my food, bit into it, and I thought WOW~ I think I just bit into one of the best tasting burgers I've ever had in America!! I would say compared to Shake Shack, In-N-Out burgers are scrumptious and they taste MUCH fresh and their fries are cut small, not super-oily, and are filling. Their shake was SUPER thick and tasty as well!! After you finish your shake, you can use the same cup to get a refill on the soda machine so be sure to get the shake instead of the soft drink so you can get both!! :)

My relatives promised me to make a pit stop at In-N-Out before my flight back to NYC and my heart filled with hope as we pulled up to the parking lot just to see that it wasn't opened! 

5 years later I returned to the In-N-Out in Vegas! I was a complete noob however - thinking that ordering a 2x2 animal style made me a In-N-Out insider. Boy was I wrong. When I returned a few months later I had my bombdiggity order ready:

*Well-Done animal style fries (Well done is a NECESSITY. Otherwise the fries legit become soggy messes under the special dressing + onions that look like bacon).
*Extra toasted bun (always order the bun first), medium rare animal style single w/out pickles, w/ a whole grilled onion, cut in half.
*Neapolitan Shake (Chocolate + Vanilla + Strawberry) 

The wait was minimal as it was around 10:30-11PM on a Friday night. Probably took about 10 mins for our food (it's fresh, never frozen!). My only complaint was that the bun was kinda cold :( I also could have done without the shake (suuuuuper thick). Other that that the food was fabulous + the fact that it's so affordable makes In-N-Out a staple whenever I'm in the West Coast!

P.S. There are no cabs readily outside...but cabs do stream in on a regular basis. We had to wait maybe 3 minutes before one came through with more patrons =)",ZFZB-acrqGQol0PXCgd3pg,1,1,5,GKNls6Aj-Hmtdg7GWzMMqQ

This place is garbage. Like...I would rather have McDonald's than this any day of the week. The recommendation that I got was to order my fries wild/animal/whatever style. Apparently, this is part of their ""secret"" menu, although it's not so secret because every other person in the place had their fries this way.  

The burger tastes kind of like a sonic burger, which isn't too bad but the sauce that comes on it is horrid. And those fries... Those disgusting fries. This goop that came on the fries with a bunch of diced onions completely ruined them. 

At first, I went back up to the counter to ask for a fork to eat the fries. The place was slam packed, and the girl behind the counter was nice. The next time I went up was for ketchup... Still nice but with a mix of ""you're an annoying customer"". Whatever, I didn't care. 

I said this place was packed. The only place available to sit was at the bar style, long table. I had a front row seat to watch the kids yell out people's order numbers. God forbid that someone didn't pick up their order within 10 seconds. The whole crew would start screaming bloody murder. 87!!  Order 87!!!!  87!!!!!!!!!!!

This location has the food that we've all grown to love from In-N-Out, so it's not that (5-stars for fast food). It's just this particular location. If you're staying on the Strip and have a car, then you can get here rather easily. If you try to walk, grab a water bottle and maybe a Cliff bar because you're in for a hike. There is a path that gets you here, but it takes forever. I wish they could have located on the Strip someplace instead. I guess you could take a cab, but then you're basically jacking up the price of your burger.

But because it's within cab distance and easy driving distance, this location is PACKED. I mean, beyond what a normal packed In-N-Out is like. This created quite the messy restaurant. Parking looked to be a disaster as well. I will say that the service was amazing, as they were churning out burgers, fries, and whatnot like a tornado - yet the quality was still there.

Will these things keep me from going to this location the next time I'm in Vegas? No, because I don't have an In-N-Out where I live and I'm not going to let that opportunity pass me by.

The bun was stale and dry and the bottom bun was broken in half which made the whole sandwich fall apart when I tried to eat it...I was so disappointed I just threw it all away. I would have gone back and demanded a different one but I had already made it home and wasn't going to drive all the way back for a $4.00 sandwich.

I ordered the cheeseburger combo ""animal style"", which is one of the options they have on their secret menu. The sauce made my burger that much more juicy & enjoyable. The fries were very different in comparison to anything I had ate before, which makes sense since I had never enjoyed fresh fries from an establishment. 

The location itself had tons of seating, either indoor or outdoor (by the gift shop). It was very clean for a fast-food joint.

Good: Price and Quality. Where else in Vegas near the Strip can you get a good quality double burger, fries, and shake for around $7? The workers took their time and showed enthusiasm, which is always a bonus for fast food. Location is close to Strip. If you don't have a car you can still walk there. While it's on the North of West Tropicana Ave. past I-15, take the sidewalk on the South of W. Tropicana Ave. (Excalibur side, not NYNY side) and head West. There is a walkway that loops around the overpass and you can make it there safely via sidewalks/crosswalks. Don't forget about the store on the North side of the restaurant.

My friends and I came all the way from Philadelphia to Las Vegas for a Bachelor Party.  We stopped in In-N-Out for a bite to eat before we hit the strip.  We ended up waiting a half an hour just to eat.  This place was pack tight.  There could have been fire code violations for how crammed it was in this place.  I figured it must be good if I am waiting this long. So I waited and waited and pretty much waited some more. 

Order Numbers where all over the place. Order number 56, 48, 27, 57, 58, 69 etc.... It gets a bit frustrating when you think your next but in reality your not even close.  

Finally I got my burger and sat down with my friends hoping for a delicious bite of a juicy burger.  My first bite was pretty much my last.  Figuring to buy a double it would be big enough to fill my appetite but that wasn't the case.  The burger was fresh but not that great in a taste category.  My milk shake was the thickest milk shake in the world.  It coated my throat with a chocolaty mess, which it ended up giving me a stomachache.  

By far the best thing to order was their french fries.  They are made from real potatoes and you can watch the fri-guy put the potatoes in a contraption and cut them up.

1718530,2015-12-09,0,nVAJZ6BJ9PPlxDXn976R6A,In-N-Out Burger is located fairly close to the Las Vegas Strip. To get there you would want to to to the New York New York resort and walk down the street. It is best to be on the Ex Caliber resort side as there are no crosswalks or sidewalks on the New York side. It is about a 15 min walk each way (From the NY NY property). You do have to walk under a bridge on a walking path that is a little shady (homeless living there- but still felt safe). Once there you walk to the first stop light with a crosswalk to cross the street and you are at In-N-Out. Food is the typical great quality- served fresh and full of flavor. This was a nice experience to get In-N-Out again. The staff here is very organized and knows how to handle crowds.,AEowRtLGb_AdqFAZ8e6C9A,3,1,5,Y20Mho3XF-88kSY4UCw0cg

I like a decent chunk of meat and see the juice spew out just a little. A burger is not a burger if its not at least bit greasy. 

But I admit these are the best fries I ever had. Not greasy but crisp and no salt needed. You can actually see them make the fries fresh from the potato.

Fear not, they are a well oiled machine and not even 10 minutes later I am sitting down eating my delicious cheeseburger (animal style) fries and a coke. The burger is perfect.

1990488,2011-10-23,2,nVAJZ6BJ9PPlxDXn976R6A,"I'm a Cali girl, so In N Out will always have a place in my heart. But when you come to a city like Las Vegas, you just have certain expectations. Like that if you want In N Out at 5am in the morning, is it too much to ask that you be open in the city that never sleeps? Oh wait, is that New York? Well, you know what I mean.

Anyway, this place still closes at 1am, to all of our disappointment. So we decided to eat here for brunch the next morning before our drive back home. 

The ginormous neon sign off the freeway isn't hard to miss. However, I am confused that the size of this location is just like any other In N Out I've been to. The line was almost literally out the door. They are obviously busy, why not make the place bigger? It was interesting to hear people in line talk about the secret menu to their friends. Being a Californian, it's funny to think we know things others don't, like we're special or something. People ordering quadruple-stacks and animal-style fries - it gave me a new appreciation for the joint. 

It's not the best burger I've had in my lifetime, but I would have to say it is pretty darn tasty. I myself enjoy the toasted bun and the grilled onions. There was one point in my life where I would solely eat the animal-style fries for lunch for quite a few months (that's french fries with the 1000-island-like spread, melted cheese and grilled onions). And let me tell you, I was concerned for my health and had to eventually quit. 

So although I do not frequent this place too often nowadays, I realize now that I'm not sure I would like to live without it. I have heard too many a story of people who move to different states and miss the taste of an In N Out burger...and now I truly understand. 

Just be open 24 hours a day in Vegas. You are missing out on profit from post-party patrons. It just makes sense, don't you think?",XXCS_jLbbOvH5g0JQvey-w,1,2,4,awDSg65dB1ZYHoGL9wzghw

For the most part their burgers and fries taste very bland without adding a lot of salt, ketchup, and that simple Thousand Island sauce they use on the burgers. 

The beef is a very thin patty that is not all that juicy. The fries are dry and many times overcooked. The shakes taste artificial and from out of a machine. 

The cooks pour way too much salt on the burgers and fries, drowning the burgers and fries in salt.

I see nothing special about In and Out at all. 

Now...when you compare it to Shake Shack burgers, fries, and shakes, Shake Shack comes out way ahead in taste, service, quality overall...way better than In and Out.",-ktMv62TKswYW-ZRTi-kJg,2,1,1,3haKKv8IcRyxJx-zR7dbKA

Having recently been to a bunch of burger places I felt I was ready to see where In-N-Out would rank. I ordered a double double animal style, fries, and a strawberry shake. Every one of those items was outstanding.

First off, the restaurant is very clean despite being completely packed. All the staff were nice and helpful, not a surly employee in sight. I was impressed at how quickly the line moved and that the wait for the food itself was short considering I was here at the height of the lunch rush.

My burger was fantastic. Extremely flavorful on its own, but in tandem with the cheese, sauce, veggies, and bun everything came alive. I think the meat patties at Shake Shack may be a *little* bit better, but the superior bun and sauce more than make up the gap for In-N-Out. The fries were perfectly cooked and the shake was the epitome of a strawberry shake.

Here's the real kicker though- the price. This is the location right by the Vegas strip. Having ordered basically the same thing at Shake Shack I was prepared for a $20 price tag. But no! It  came out to $8 and change! You simply cannot get a better deal for your money.

Also, they have a drive-thru, of course as 99% of all fast-food places do these days.

It was fine for a once in awhile ""treat"" or splurge, but I wouldn't make a habit of it. As I write this, and my food has settled, the burps and after taste are quite uncomfortable :-/

 I finally got my order. A cheeseburger combo. It just looked like any old random fast food burger except it was wrapped a little nicer and the person who handed it to me had a smile. I opened it up to inspect what was inside and it had the florescent yellow processed cheese square, a slice of tomato, lettuce, some beige goo and a pathetic lumpy brown disc that resembled beef. Took one bite and decided to give the fries a chance. They were bland, but when salted or smothered in catsup, they tasted much better.

I'm not a big fan of cheese on my burgers (besides, there's enough on the animal style fries!), so I got a double meat, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they actually charged me less than a double-double would have been. So they actually do subtract out the cost of the cheese. Score!

We came here around 9:15 pm on a Monday night.. and it was PACKED. So plan accordingly.

This is THE iconic In-N-Out of Vegas. It's right next to the strip, and therefore, YES....IT IS ALWAYS BUSY. Go there expecting a long wait and you won't be as disappointed. They also get 5 stars for the crap they have to put up with from drunks and tourists.

This is also the location I mentioned in another review in which I witnessed a group of 4 walk up to the counter and I overheard this:

GIRL:  Can I just get like a grilled chicken sandwich
EMPLOYEE:  I'm sorry we don't have any chicken sandwiches on our menu, just burgers.
GIRL:  Really? I don't really like burgers, do you have anything else?
EMPLOYEE: (controlling a smirk) No. I'm sorry, just what's on the menu.
GIRL:  Okaaaaaaay........ummmmmmm.......I guess let me have a burger, but can I have it with bacon and avocado?
EMPLOYEE:  Oh I'm really sorry we don't have bacon or avocado.
GIRL: (Turns to boyfriend) Just order me something, this place is stupid! (Walks out of line and plops down in a booth with arms crossed.)

In the words of Jimmy Fallon on SNL: ""Really?.......REALLYYYYY?""

And for God's sake don't write a review based on how many cars were in the drive-thru....In-N-Out may have ties to J.C. and Bible verse numbers on the cups, but they can't perform miracles...so stay focused on the interactions with the employees and the food.

I would give the company as a whole 6 stars if I could for low prices, quality ingredients, and insanely good and efficient service (This is the only fast food restaurant that can top Chick-fil-A).

- Fresh Ingredients
- Lightly Toasted Buttered Buns
- Creamy Shakes. If you don't mind mixing flavors, try their Neapolitan shake. It's not listed in their store menu b/c its a ""secret.""
- Extremely AFFORDABLE! 
- Double-Double Animal Style. You won't see this on the menu board either. This is off their ""Secret Menu.""
- Fast and Friendly Cashiers
- Yummy Pink Lemonade


Whats ""OK"" about IN-N-OUT:

- Mediocre Fries. A fellow Yelper, Ben G mentioned ""they get cold very quickly."" I completely agree.
- Thin (but tasty) Meat Patties


I love Shake Shack for many reasons. It is definitely pricier than In-N-Out, but for the quality and deliciousness, its worth it. Eventhough Shake Shack's fries are just OK, I like their fries better than the ones at In-N-Out. The meat patty at Shake Shack is also thicker and juicier. 

Question: Would I visit IN-N-OUT or Shake Shack more if they (in my dreams) opened side by side?

Answer: IN-N-OUT. You get the same high quality ingredients (yes, a thinner meat patty), but you don't have to fork out as much cash! I can do without fries. 

This was so worth the walk from the strip (which was NOT bad at all).

{Note} It's packed in here, but people eat quite fast. You should be able to find a seat inside soon enough. If you're going in a big group, it may be quicker for you to find seats outside. 

{Tip} Their ""Secret Menu"" is really not a secret. Go on their website, click on Menu and you will see a tiny folder labeled ""NOT-SO-SECRET-MENU."" Now you're in the loop :D",dHxvSPU6PZqX1LQRXajGDQ,26,27,5,ZKuThbAM7CJ4_wttTYaZqg
2561011,2014-10-22,43,nVAJZ6BJ9PPlxDXn976R6A,"Gem finally goes to In-N-Out!!

After a delayed flight, plummeting blood sugar, a mile-long line & a mini melt down at the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center, I was ready to fight somebody for my first ever In-N-Out meal! I've forever heard & read about these legendary West Coast burgers & fries that we Midwesterners are not so privileged to have, but I wanted to try them first hand to see if they are worth the fuss.

1st stop after the rental car nightmare: a mad beeline to the popular Sin City In-N-Out location on Dean Martin Drive near the Strip where I had my very 1st I&O experience! I first noticed all the lovely, adorable palm trees (my fave) by the building & loved them! No palm trees in the mighty Midwest either :-(

I already knew about the cult ""secret menu"" & had my order planned out forever ago! I got a double-double, protein, gem-modified, animal-style: 2 mustard-griddled patties, lettuce-wrapped with cheese, mustard, tomatoes & pickles but held the extra spread & grilled onions. I also got a regular order of french fries & a regular, black coffee because I was exhausted from traveling. 

I always order lettuce-wrapped burgers at restaurants when the option is available like at Five Guys or Red Robin, etc. When I got
my meal, I inspected it & it looked like fast food artwork, beautiful! (see my pics)

The menu says their french fries are fresh cut, but they kinda reminded me of McD's fries only a lil thicker with a perfect amount of crispiness & have some potato-like, looking edges. They are completely different than the darker/limper/potatoey/natural-looking, hand-cut 5 Guys kinda fry that I love, but these fries are really friggin' good too, 4 gems!

My 2 burgers were nicely wrapped with fresh, sliced tomatoes & dill pickles in one large, solid, crisp piece of leaf lettuce with cheese & mustard oozing out of every insanely, tasty bite! That's right, it's messier but OMG more flavorful & juicy than, smh, Five Guys! I never polished a burger, let alone a damn double off that quick in my entire life! I was in burger paradise & still dreamin' about it, um 5 gems!

This I&O is bright, large, & very clean. For those of you unfortunate enough to have never dined at I&O, you place your order at the counter, your food is made fresh to order, you get a number & they call out your number when your order is ready to pick up at the counter. The staff here was friendly, the place was busy & it took about 15 min to get my food, not so fast but definitely worth the wait! Burgers at 5 Guys are never gonna be the same :-(

A lady next to me was eating food from Wendy's, and I didn't even try to hide my disapproving look! How the hell do you eat Wendy's at I&O, the audacity of some people! That's like going to Lou Malnati's in Chicago & bringing in Pizza Hut! I wanted to scream, I don't have I&O by me you ungrateful woman!!

I&O doesn't have free peanuts or all the extra free toppings like 5 Guys. But what they do offer & make are straightforward, kick-ass tasting burgers that don't need all the extra goodies, they have a really cool marketing edge aka ""the secret menu"" & bonus they sell coffee that ain't too bad either! I now get the I&O madness over these gemazing, Wild West burgers!

I came, I saw, I was In (I devoured), I was Out!! Now, I may just be inclined to catch a redeye to Megas the next time I get a craving, cuz I would do anything for...Good Food!",tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,48,49,5,rt9ew4Ny_aiEL91CpUl6Xg

The burgers are very good, I heard even just the cheese burger without the animal style sauce is state of the art. Fries are good as well, and please make it animal style as well. Trust me, you want that to happen. Hence the term, Double-double animal style. 

It's a given that at any west coast destination, upon exiting the airport, make a direct trip to the nearest In-N-Out shop. It's probably a time honored tradition,, as far as I'm concerned at least.

Such a simple menu, burger or cheeseburger, fries pop. That's it!!! Keeps it nice and easy. Cheap prices too!! I read the Yelp reviews and the consensus was to have a double burger with cheese and fries done animal style. Mmmmmm, ok!!! Loved the burger especially with the grilled onions which in my opinion made it. Freshly made before your eyes and pretty darn good. I tried out the fries animal style which consists of a thousand island type sauce over the fries. I found it to be messy and not my thing but I hear it is popular as hell. The burger is what won me over so it didn't matter too much about the fries. 

Always a line-up and that many people can't be wrong. They specialize in the one item and excel at it so it is another gotta go there each time I fly over to Vegas.

In N Out Burger is hands down the best cheeseburger I had ever eaten in my life. When we went to Vegas 2 years ago, I had my first In N Out Burger. We went to L.A. last summer, we got off the plane, got our luggage, got the rental car and proceeded directly to In N Out Burger @ The 405 and Inglewood Avenue. 

They can make a burger as big as a 4x4, I got the 3x3 myself with well done cheese fries. The fries are decent, I know a lot of people don't care for them, but the burgers are the best you will ever have. 

The location in this review is nice and convenient, its a short walk from New York New York right down Tropicana Ave under I-15. They also have a company store, which we bought some mugs and T-shirts at after lunch.

I always recommend In N Out to friends going to Vegas or Cali.

The burgers are overly salty. Saltier than I am when I'm trying to get my revenge on the person that cut me in traffic. The fries, although are perfectly made, are not perfectly seasoned.

Let me start by saying that people come from around the world to Las Vegas and THIS is most divination a ""destination location"" 

I have been to so many In N Outs and never seen one as dirty as this one. From the bathrooms to the tables and floors, down right dirty. In fact, if I didn't know how amazing the meal was going to be I would have looked at this as another McDonald's. Which is an insult.

In N Out is supposed to be a family owned and operated company that cares about the quality of their food and the foundation of which is was born. And yes, you are just fast food. But you're more than that. Which is why my expectations are so high. If the owner walked through this location at this time someone was for sure getting fired.

Go for the double double or 3x3 and get the usual toppings but add a whole grilled onion - game-changer.  The ingredients are always fresh and delicious.

The one downside with this location is it's proximity to the Strip.  While this may make it more convenient for you to get here, it also makes it convenient for the masses to converge onto this one location during the lunch hours.  The lines can often wrap into the dining area, and seating is doggone difficult to find (pardon my language).  The service is usually pretty quick with the army of burger flippers, fry guys, and runners that they have, but it can be pretty hectic.

 The staff was very friendly and helpful on decisions for my co workers who ordered burgers with unnecessary amounts of Patty's. I however opted for the fries.

This particular In-N-Out Burger has a sign right next to I15 that reaches to the sky which calls many autos off the freeway.  It also got to us as we headed to our hotel!

First, it was so crowded that we should have taken our clue from that.  The line to order went all through the entire restaurant and there was not a clean table in the place.  My husband got in line and I finally found a table someone was abandoning and claimed it for us.  In a corner just for two.

When my husband finally arrived I was thrilled to see the burgers, fries, and drinks, as In-N-Out is my favorite burger joint in Vegas and CA.  Well, one bite and I had wished we were at Jack-in-the-Box!  Very small piece of meat, dried out, and just awful!  Fries?  I don't even know how to describe them.  Needless to say, this ruined our going to another In-N-Out the entire trip.  Usually we make 2-3 runs to one when we are in Vegas, as TX's has none.  I guess they don't have to be so up-to-par as the others since most of their business comes from the freeway and the stip.

A BK Whopper is no fancy fast food burger, but to me it's more Miller High Life. It's the champagne of burgers. Has actual meat and grill/charcoal taste and a good balance of toppings. Fries are way better too! INOB fries are disastrously bad! Like deep fried cardboard!

Simple menu, cheery staff, and a cute look earn this place three stars. How it takes 15 min to get an order also when they have approximately three things on their menu is beyond me and beyond the pale!

Not used to waiting for fast food since I've never been to this establishment, the cab driver even held the meter for me.

Expect the usual great tasting food and fantastic customer service. Nothing has changed about those qualities that In-N-Out is known for, but do expect the following:

- There are long lines that can stretch out to the door, but they move fairly quickly.

- Be prepared to wait more than 10 minutes for your food to be ready. This was not due to service, but due to the large volume of orders.

- Limited seating. Actually, there's plenty of seating, but it might be tough finding a spot; bring extra people to seat stalk and reserve spaces.

- Sticky floors and messy tables. Considering how this place receives a lot of traffic, I can imagine that it'd be difficult to keep it spic-and-span. However, the employees do their best to make sure the restaurant is cleanly.

Our numbers were 30 away when we placed our orders, but getting the food took very little time - so this is a very efficient location.

The food came out perfectly. Hot, flavorful, delicious! I also got an order of animal-style fries (highly recommend, but you need a fork to eat them).

Even the famous Taiwanese director Ang Lee went to eat their burger after the 2013 Oscars Ceremony, where he won the Oscar for Best Director! That news was repeatedly reported in Taiwan and made me really want to try In-N-Out! 

I was so glad to find out there was a In-N-Out burger in Vegas and it was somehow ""close"" to our hotel according to Google Maps.

It took us forever to get there.. Almost an hour because we took the wrong side of the sidewalk. It was really sad to see the sign of In-N-Out but we couldn't pass through the highway to eat there... We were about to abandon because we were really tired from walking non-stop on the strip for the past few days and it just seems impossible for us to get to In-N-Out. We really had that ""so near yet so far"" feeling!!! 

Advice: Do not try to get there from New York New York because there is no sidewalk after you have passed the hotel and all you have is highway and cars driving really fast and drivers calling you crazy. Please take the sidewalk along Excalibur hotel (W Tropicana Ave) and walk straight until you arrive on Dean Dr Martin, then you will see and smell In-N-Out! You can also take the taxi to get there (easier and faster)!

Even before we got there, we could smell their burgers/fries and it smelled so good! There were a lot of people and the parking slot was all filled with cars. It was a little bit hard to find seats for 6 people but we didn't want takeout since it is always better to eat it there, right? 

I ordered the animal-style hamburger (with hand-leafed lettuce, tomato, a mustard cooked beef patty; add pickle, extra spread with grilled onions) and an animal-style fries (melted Cheese, Secret Spread that looks like Thousand Island dressing and Grilled Onions). I should have picked the cheeseburger instead of hamburger just to have more textures. I would like to try their Protein style (burger wrapped with lettuce instead of buns) since it sounds ""healthier"". 

Although some people find the animal-style a bit too greasy and heavy, I find it perfect since it made the fries even more flavorful! My parents' friends loved In-N-Out so much that they said they wouldn't mind eating this everyday while they are still in Vegas (they loved it more than Shake Shack)!",WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,4,0,5,SLLFZQVtl6JnRIq1-8UTwg

I have never had one of the workers ask if we wanted ""special sauce"" on our burgers it has always been ""spread"". That wasn't a big deal to us we just thought it was funny.

My hubby ordered a ""4x4"" and I ordered my usual ""Grilled Cheese"".
We always ask for it with grilled onions and for them to add mustard.
Well, they repeated the order back to us true I&OB style.

We pulled away (napkins covering the food so couldn't see it just yet) and eagerly pulled into the parking lot across the street to get our grub on.

The fries were black, and I mean blaaaaack. They were mostly nubs instead of regular long fries. 

I have been eating I&OB for decades and know they are the most consistent food chain out there. I had only one time ever had an issue at a location where the fries were black and I called their 800 # to complain and I have to say I never ever thought a fast food company would go so above and beyond to satisfy a customer. I was very very impressed.

Sure, I could call and complain about this visit but I'm not looking for freebies and I know for a fact I will be eating I&OB for many more decades to come as it is just too darn delicious. I instead just talked directly to the manger so he was aware as I know he knows that preparing the food a I&OB correctly is the standard they want to uphold.  He was very polite and apologetic.

I was surprised at how cheap it was! These burgers are seriously a great deal. It comes with onions, lettuce, cheese, tomato, the usual - and they have their special thousand island-tasting sauce. The fries are pretty good too, especially when dipped wit the burger sauce. It's not the best burger out there, (there are many others I would recommend in my own city), but I still like it. 

Not sure how I feel about the service, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The manager came to our table to randomly talk to us, and he came back about another 2-3 times to talk and ask questions while we were eating, and gave us some hats. I thought he was just bored or really liked us because he we were from out of town, I don't know - but when we finished our food he asked us if we had a working phone, and to call a certain number so that we could put in a good word for him. I forget his name now, but he was very demanding about it. Now we know why he talked to us for so long... and he said we HAD to call that number while we were still in the restaurant. When we said we would do it later he still insisted that we do it right then and there which made us feel a little uncomfortable... tsk tsk.

I had eaten a burger here in NorCal a few years ago and was unimpressed, but my palate wasn't as refined so I figured I'd give it another shot.

My dad, brother and I went at lunch time on a Friday. The line was long but orders were taken quickly and food was coming out constantly. It was truly impressive!

Now as for what I ordered: a #1 Double Double with everything (including onion), fries and a Coke. I picked up some of the ""Chiles"" too.

So the Chiles are just baby pepperoncini I guess, but they were tasty. The fries were weak. I know they're fresh but they're dry and crunchy, like canned Potato Sticks you can get in the store. The burger was tasty, and while I hate Big Mac sauce and thousand island dressing, I actually did like the In-N-Out sauce. I'd put the burger a notch above Wendy's but that's it. My brother got a vanilla shake and it tasted like someone blended up McDonald's ice cream cones, including the actual cake cone. Meh. It's also taken a few hours to dissolve the salt left in my throat from the food.

Five Guys destroys In-N-Out in every regard. The selection of toppings at Five Guys is astounding and their boardwalk style fries have NO EQUAL. Now, In-N-Out is good, and I'd give it a 3.5 if I could for the food. The 4 is earned by effort of the staff and execution.

I quickly called in n out, but it transferred me to corporate. I explained to the lady what had happened and she contacted the manager. I was already turning back to in n out. When I got there these 2 boys were going through all the trash cans and I felt so bad. I insisted that if it wasn't there, it's fine. 
However, one of the boy said to me, that this is fun and he didn't mind at all because it was different and not the same boring routine. He had a positive attitude and was very determined. The fact that he was so happy to do this instead of being grumpy from going through the trash, made it a better experience. 
The other boy decided to check the waste in the back and it felt like a miracle! He came out with the retainers in the wrapped napkin, just how I left it.

One thing is for certain, a trip out west is not complete without a visit to In-N-Out Burger.  On my trip earlier this month, I was fortunate to have In-N-Out Burger twice, once in Los Angeles (at a wedding!) and once at this location just off the famed Las Vegas strip.

Going to In-N-Out is always an experience.  The restaurant sign is reminiscent of all the bright neon lights of the strip.  You pull into the parking lot and it's packed with cars, plus at least 5 taxi cabs too.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a line to take your order, but it moves at a decent pace.  Above the counter is the menu.  It's pretty simple and minimalist.  The hubby and I ordered two Cheeseburgers at $2.45 each and an order of Fresh French Fries at $1.65.  Including tax our order came to $7.08.  Wow!  That's the cheapest, most affordable meal we had in our 4 days in Las Vegas.  My husband called me a cheap date!  But hey, when you have an In-N-Out craving, nothing else will suffice.

There is definitely an interesting crowd inside the restaurant, so we opted to take our food to go and brought it back to our hotel room to have with a bottle of red wine, classy I know.

I really wish In-N-Out Burger would expand to the East Coast, but I'm also pretty sure this will never happen as all of their food is fresh and never frozen, so it cannot travel too far from their processing centers.

Unfortunately there is some kind of virus in the air here (must be the wind patterns) that makes people shit bricks over In-N-Out. I must have contracted it because now I can't help but like it. :(

The hamburgers are decent fast-food fare as long as you add grilled onions and leave off the GOD-AWFUL spread. With the spread they taste exactly the same as McDonalds. The shakes are tasty - it's not hard to make a good shake. The fries are pretty bland but can be saved if you order them well-done.

There are so many better chain hamburgers to be had. Five Guys is way better, and Smashburger is the best. But when you're on the long, lonely road to L.A. (god forbid), the Barstow In-N-Out is pretty much the best thing along the route. And if you're a Californian tourist coming in to town, you probably can't help but be drawn to the giant sign like a neon beacon.

In and Out fries are not that great, but the burgers make it totally worth it(and you better like burgers because you can't get anything else there aside from pop and or a fantastic shake!)...unlike McD's and the rest of the places, they are literally using fresh beef to make the burger, the buns are fresh and buttered and they come with FRESH sliced tomato, onion and lettuce and a special sauce that is to die for...they use real cheese for the cheese fries too!

Yes, for a big place, it was packed with people inside and out. I also noticed there were taxis parked. That's a good sign right. People are paying extra money to get good food.

I love their simple menu. You choose from 3 types of burger, fries, drinks, shakes and that's pretty much it. Yes, I love the simple and basic. I order 2 cheeseburger combos. Even though it was a full house, my order was ready within 10 minutes. I love the efficiency too! You can't tell how the burger by looking at the photo. You gotta eat it to get the full experience. Buns were nicely toasted. The beef patty was soft and juicy. It also had organgy sauce for the burger kind of similar to Big Mac sauce. But it tasted perfect. It came with load of fries and I did tell myself that's way too much fries. I never finish my fries EVER. The French fries were out of this world. It was so fresh. You can hardly taste the oil or grease. As it says on the paper tray, potatoes are cut fresh daily. Sadly, fries were gone in no time. I need to order extra next time. I also got a vanilla shake. It was creamy and thick. It's the old-fashioned way.

Once again, this is the freshest burger AND fries I ever had in my life. I would give 6 starts if I could. I love the old-fashioned way too!",rYGi5DJ_54qeoWkkqB21jA,1,2,5,DoIeGogKmLmC-G6lqm0dRQ

We came in the mid-afternoon but there was still an impressive line up of at least 15 people, plus others waiting for their orders. What I saw in the store added up with what I had previously heard - a clean store, tiny menu with rock bottom cheap prices (especially compared to fast food in Canada), and a general old school kind of feel. There's no corporate attempts at modernizing, just the same thing that has made In-N-Out what it is today. 

Naturally, I'd heard of their not so secret menu by this point and came armed knowing what I wanted. The line chugged along and orders were coming out of the kitchen at a blistering pace. When it came my time to order, I went with a double double animal style, well done fries and a strawberry shake. I'd like to think I sounded like I knew what I was talking about. 

We patiently waited for a little while and beheld the spectacle of the well-oiled machine of this In-N-Out's kitchen. A few dozen orders later, I had my deep, red tray in hand and hunkered down to eat.

The fries were noticeably darker than my friend's, but not over done, just an eye-pleasing golden brown. They took on an interesting texture being cooked such that they weren't very fluffy inside, just crisp nearly all the way through. It wasn't a fry epiphany for me, but I definitely preferred them over the regular fries.

The burger itself was a sight to behold - the sauteed onions, extra sauce and pickles nearly pouring out of the container. It was a great flavour overall, even if it did somewhat overshadow the beef itself. What bites of unadulterated beef I could get, they were good - beefy, and moist and a little bit of zing from the mustard it was cooked in. The only downside and a very nit-picky one was that the thick slice of beefsteak tomato was distractingly thick and cooled down the burger. All in all, it was a wonderful, hot mess of a burger.

The shake was a fine execution of the classic dessert drink - thick, but not impossible to suck up the straw and the pleasant familiarity of the strawberry flavour.

With my visit later in the day to a Michelin-starred restaurant, I was able to tick off two big items on my foodie ""to do"" list. In-N-Out definitely lived up to the hype for me, and I look forward to when I'm next in a city that has one.",zyaQNsI73cLOKttvGnj4bw,1,0,5,gpoGDqJVfUf66X5slUDMFg

I was told by the staff that this is the busiest In-N-Out in the nation.  The staff really didn't need to tell me this.  It's obvious when you come here. The drive thru and lines inside are both always long.  There's people everywhere and I mean everywhere.  Getting a seat inside the restaurant is rare.  You will see a lot people eating outside, on the curb, in their cars, and even at the In-N-Out Company Store. This location is actually not the last In-N-Out before you head to California, but it is the closest to the start of the Las Vegas Strip and airport.  This is the reason why it's so packed.  Plus, a lot of people love In-N-Out. A lot of out-of-towners can't get enough of it. The staff at this In-N-Out is very prepared for the madness.  They're all well-trained and manage to handle the volume of people with efficiency. 

I recently ate here just because it's been a long time.  Last week was actually the first time I ate here as a Yelper.  I went with the usual, which is two Flying Dutchman's with Spread.  My meal was as good as it was the previous week.  I've had their Double Double, 3x3, Animal Fries, and a Grilled Cheese at this location back in the day.  That was a while back, though. 

This In-N-Out used to be the fun one to go to. I say ""used to be"" only because they no longer create the fun burgers.  The first 100 x 100 that I have seen was at this In-N-Out.  The first Monkey Style Burger that I have seen was also at this In-N-Out.  My understanding is that they will not make both these burgers anymore or they were never allowed to.  It doesn't matter if they don't make these burgers anymore.  In-N-Out has a fan for life.  I'll see you soon, In-N-Out.

Sometimes you worry that a place will never live up to the hype.  Like Slumdog Millionaire.

Well, you don't have to worry about that with In-N-Out Burger, because it is what all fast food establishments need to strive for.  It is the best of the best.  Clean restaurant, incredibly good service and staff, and most importantly the best fast food you'll ever find.

There isn't much I can say that is negative about In-N-Out.  I guess the only thing is that it's ALWAYS BUSY.  But the line moves really fast, and that's because the service is really good here.  Having a smiling happy and friendly staff goes a long way.  I just feel like your entire experience could change if you saw a long line and a bunch of miserable employees serving them.  I didn't see that, and I appreciated it.  I even asked for a bumper sticker (and felt bad asking given the rush inside), and the employee never gave me a single notion that he was annoyed about this special request.  He went to the back room and grabbed me two of them without thinking twice about it.  

Double double animal style, animal fries, neo shake.  That's how I roll.  The neopolitan shake is so thick that the flavors don't become one odd flavor, you get different flavors in every sip.  The burgers are nice and juicy and everything just works together really well.  I find fries boring, but not when they're covered in grilled onions and ""spread"".  

We made a point to eat here twice in a 3 day span.  I rarely eat fast food, but just couldn't help myself.  This particular location IS walkable from the south end of the strip.  Coming from the Trop, it took about 15 minutes.  It's a little tricky to figure out, but google ""walking to in-n-out vegas"" or something like that, and you will find detailed instructions.",4Qijwb2RDiUGc4SBjA2lJg,3,2,5,6PO0Zm2A2JQpcD-KPdkGxA

It's not all because of the huge crowds, although that's part of it. The problem was that the service is shoddy, which should not be the case even at a busy location. On certain travel weekends, Kettleman City, located roughly halfway between the Bay Area and LA, gets pretty darn busy, but they can handle themselves. Here, they call orders prematurely and don't get all the fries ready. I also saw a woman with a serious enough complaint to get a coupon or something from the manager.

Finally the burger it looks beautiful!! Again pick it up 1. Ice cold soggy and 2.tasteless just covered in sauce which I know I asked for so its not the sauce I'm complaining about. The bread was just mush and not soaked by the sauce just cold and wet! I took one bite and could not believe what just happened after waiting on the long line for my food and all the anticipation this just happened!!! I was completely heartbroken I had no desire at that point to even get up and have them remake my meal.. I was hungry and beyond aggravated.

I've tried it before in San Fran back in 2008, it was good but  did not impress me too much and I was not aware of Animal style.... fail...... so when I was planning a trip to Vegas, I had to make sure to revisit In-N-Out Burger and make sure my double double is animal style. I really enjoy the way the burgers are carefully crafted, every bite has everything i want in it, and it doesnt end up being a big mess that falls apart. From the crisp outer but soft innerds of the bun, freshly cooked patties, fresh veggies, and the flavors of animal style all mixed together to call for a completely enjoyable experience. I could have lived without the animal on the fries, did not enjoy that as much, just a little overboard, i think it was the carmalized onions that didnt mix well on the fries for me. I did observe that they cut the potatoes in the kitchen, not to mention the service is very friendly and efficient.

I walked to In-N-Out Burger from the strip (~15 min walk under a bridge, and sidewalk accross a bridge, and cross at a heavy intersection) but I would def do it again, no brainer.

     I got in late tonite and decided, let's give it a go again. I got an order to go of 3, double-doubles with pickles and onions, an order of fries, and a chocolate milkshake.
     The order was ready pretty quickly (I went through the drive thru). It looked and smelled pretty good, but I was starving. My hotel is only 4 minutes away, so that was nice.
     I unpacked my order and it all looked tasty. Appeared very fresh. The fries were somehow a bit cold already, possibly stale. I felt like it had some black flecks on them, like when the fryer oil needs a change. They were ""eh"". Base off of this particular order, I wouldn't get their fries again, but I know it might occasionally happen.
     The burgers were quite large. Almost to the point of overstuffed, but because of the lettuce and tomatoes. The beef patties were cooked well and had a good taste. A bit of the problem with the over stuffing is the animal sauce made it VERY messy. The ratio of patty to everything else is a bit off. Eating the burger, a lot of it slides all over and you end up with kind of a wet handful of bun, sauce, lettuce, and tomatoes.
     Overall, I think I may have had enough In-N-Out Burger. I probably wouldn't go back again.",_cEuH9i5R7u1hbcgK253bQ,1,1,2,7V5CkGkd4Hap_jaP2-lsKA

I am not one of those.  And I am not  a hater.  I enjoy their burgers, in fact I try to stop by whenever I am in an area that has one.  

What's sets INO apart is its ""animal style"" aka Thousand Island Sauce.  You get it on your burger, you can get it on your fries.  Whatever.  It ""enhances the taste"" but to me it's all gimmick.  The INO patty is bland with no flavoring (ie ketchup, sauce, etc) it's awfully boring.  The fries are bland as well.  

You all probably think I am being unreasonable, but tell me otherwise.  All the people taking about juices from the burger....I feel the patties are too small to begin with you the ""juiciness"" will be limited unless you go double-double or 4x4.

This burger chain has been around for decades and I have never been to one that does not have a crowd with lines at the counter and cars backed up at the drive through. Be persistent though and you will be rewarded with a quality, well put together burger that tops just about every other fast food burger chain out there. 

This particular store has a separate merchandise shop and it is a fairly large property with more tables inside and out than a typical In-N-Out. There were also more parking spots and on the weekday afternoon I visited, the lines were manageable and my wait time from ordering to stuffing my pie hole was only about 10 minutes.

This location is close to The Strip so I imagine that there are times where the crowds and the wait are going to be terrible but the employees here seemed to be happy to be working and even came around a few times asking if they could get us anything else and clearing away our detritus and debris after the burger mauling that took place at our table. That kind of service I have not seen previously at other In-N-Outs so maybe they are trained to do that to keep people a bit happier while they have to wait. I did observe several locals that were very social with those of us visiting and they were all very proud of this particular location and they were really selling some foreign visitors on the food and the culture. Vegas should sign these people up as marketing ambassadors. I think by the end of the wait, the Japanese tourists patiently trying to hear their order number called were ready to denounce their own citizenship and move here based on the sales job from the local guy in line! 

I'm sure the waits can be long here as they are at almost every other In-N-Out I have ever been to but the comforting reward of their burger in my hot little hand is worth it every time.",WHe5tyJbVpkvO_3meMUrdg,8,6,4,zgbrx1yS25XS5tHWzEM0Ug

I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.  

The burgers actually have seasoning on them.  It is always refreshing to bite into a burger and have your taste buds thank you.  You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.

I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well.

Before even entering this place is annoying because you have so many people bothering you for money. It's Vegas, I get it, but isn't fun dealing people essentially waiting for you to get out of your car to ask you for money. Then you go inside and you're in what seems like the longest line ever. Like a Disney(world/land) ride all for the burger and fries. Then if you eat in you've got to figure out where to sit. Good luck because this place is packed with tourist from all across the midwest essentially getting that elusive double-double.

So you order and get that double-double because it has that special sauce of theirs and some fries. I don't do it ""monkey style"" or any other of those weird secret menu things they may or may not have. I just want a burger and fries.

The burger is fine. Typical fast food burger, and I'll say that the meat is better than most, but the fries are the absolute worst. They are not cooked or something, like a soggy potato. Not good, not good at. I can't have a burger without having some fries with it and I can't eat these fries so I can't be a fan of this place.

So many bomb bomb bomb burger places in Las Vegas and I totally get that this is one of those, ""I gotta try at least once"", but I'm okay after that.",dsX3MiQiTy3OVI8MKn0I4w,8,4,2,EtbTEqiUoewtqEE81OHf9Q

Apparently a lot of other people thought the same because there was a decent amount of people here at 4pm in the afternoon (too early for dinner).

Luckily with my too close for comfort stalking skills, I was able to snag a table for me and my group just as someone was about to leave. As in I stared them down while they hurriedly clean their table for me :)

The cheeseburger I got was pretty standard. Good as always. Cooked well, bread a tad crispy on the edges, fresh tomatoes and lettuce and just enough sauce to flavor it. Fries were good. I loaded them with black pepper and they were good to eat! (that's an understatement if you know how much black pepper I actually eat). And I got my usual half pink lemonade/half sprite mix. 

Overall, it was a good first meal of the trip even though the BF literally lives down the street from one in SD.

Theres a reason this place has so much lore to it - if you havent already, make it a point to go there.

OK for a quick bite? Sure.  Slightly better than a normal fast food place? Sure.  Perhaps 3.5 stars if I'm rating it as ""Fast Food.""  Overall though, even if there were I&O's near me (Central Connecticut), I can't imagine I'd eat there often.  I'd equate it to Skooters in Windsor Locks, and can quickly rattle off numerous other burger places I'd rather go (some pseudo fast-food like White Hut, Shady Glen, and Five-Guys, some real restaurants like Catsup & Mustard, Ted's Montana Grill, Bobby Flay's Mohegan, Red Robin). 

FOOD:
I don't get it. A lot of hype, if you ask me.  The burgers were better than normal fast food, sure, but they weren't really that great.  The texture is nice and pleasing, and it  tasted a bit more like beef than McD's/BK, but that's not saying much.  

And the fries...blech.  Flavorless shoestring.  I have a nearly offensive level of appreciation for ketchup, and the fries made me ALMOST say ""screw it"".  The fries at Five Guys are much much better. 

SERVICE:
Ordering was quick, but the wait after wasn't.  We had to wait absurdly long because their printer stopped working, and the guy I assumed was the manager didn't notice since he was busy flirting with a customer, (While the place was packed...flirt on your own time, not mine. Thanks.).  

Cleanliness was pretty damn good for a fast food place, particularly considering how crazy busy it was...I have to give them that. 

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
It peeved me that for our takeout they just threw ketchup packets on top of uncovered fries.  Thanks for reaching your dirty mitts into the ketchup packet bin, and dropping it all right on my food. Sure I'm going to be touching those potentially dirty packets with my fingers, and then eating with the same hands...but I don't need I&O skipping that step.

The thousand island dressing didn't drown out the fried onion flavor on the burger or fries and the tomato and burger still had some room to show off their flavor too. It wasn't a let down, it was quite good. Better than Five Guys? No way.

This joint is right off the 15 so don't expect to walk there if you're staying at a hotel on the strip. Grab a cab and head out. The employees at this In-N-Out were attentive, efficient and very polite.

Was this likely the best decision before attempting to run my first ever half marathon? Likely not, but we'll look past this for now.

The trek, while a touch long, especially if you're trying to conserve your energy and legs for a run, is not impossible. There are a few tricks to the walk, including making sure you're walking along the same side of the street as the Excalibur and non New York, New York on your way across the freeway. When the sidewalk splits, make sure you take the right path, not the left, as this will lead to the bridge over the freeway.

Anyway, enough about walking there and on to the food. At 2 pm in the afternoon, the place was packed, but the cashiers moved through the line efficiently. Within 5 minutes, I was up at the front and placed my order for a double-double animal style with fries and a vanilla shake. 

I then proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for my order to be made. The burger definitely didn't disappoint. Nice and juicy with good flavors. Best burger ever? Not even close, but for a fast food burger, it definitely ranks up near the top.

The fries, however, were disappointing. Little flavor. For a fast food fry, I have to give the edge to Five Guys on this one.

The shake was nice and thick and vanilla-y.

For a chain that arguably serves up one of the best, if not THE BEST, burgers in the nation... In-N-Out Burger has also become known for their non-""fast"" food service.  That's ironic considering their menu options are the fewest of all quick service joints...single or double patty, with or w/o cheese, fries, shake and/or beverage.  

You would think it be easy and quick right?!  Well, not exactly... not when you have a gazillion ways to serve up your burger and fries (Animal style, 2x4, 2xmeat, etc.).  Serving it fresh, made-to-order, and the way you like it is a great reason for their slug-paced movement.  

Their double cheeseburger is one of the greatest things California has ever given to America.  Get it animal style, their most famous secret menu item, and you'll have pure awesomeness on a bun!

Some information for those who may be staying in a hotel on the Strip without a car, as I was this time, and are wondering about walking to In-n-Out, as I did. It is doable as long as you take the right approach.  

If you are coming from Las Vegas Boulevard (the Strip) and want to walk down Tropicana Avenue over top of the I-5 freeway, you must stay on the south side of Tropicana Avenue. That is the side with the Excalibar Hotel as opposed to the north side with the New York New York Hotel (and Casino, but that is superfluous in any Vegas hotel name).  When you get to the street across from In-n-Out, you cannot cross Tropicana immediately but must cross Dean Martin Boulevard, then Tropicana, then Dean Martin again.  The direct route has no crossing signal.  Why did you have to stay on the south side of Tropicana when In-N-Out is on the north side?  You will come to a spot without sidewalks, and in that traffic you do not wish to take your life into your hands.

The good news about the walk?  The food is worth the trip,and you can feel virtuous enough from exercising - hey, you burn calories in the 100 degree heat - that you can add a milkshake without guilt.",pD_W9KOdAOGhAV2_9UsfqQ,1,1,4,iI22CbJoZukQhp81HBB7QA

Yes, this burger lives up to all the hype. No, the fries don't (perhaps if I'd gotten them animal style, they would have, but they were just ok), but the burger is really the gem here.

We ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a vanilla/chocolate mixed shake. The burgers are huge. I could barely fit it in my mouth. It comes with lettuce and tomato for only $2.45. It was delicious with their house sauce that they put on it, kind of like Thousand Island. They gave a generous portion of fries for $1.65. Their fries are crispy and not greasy at all. I seen them fry it in the fryer, but it's as if it was air fried. It's one of the best tasting fries out there. Their shakes are thick and creamy, not overly sweet for $2.20.

My friends and I ordered the animal style burger and fries.  I was never a fan of their fries.  To fresh and health for me.  The cheese on it sucked too.  Tasted like it was melted down rubber.  The burger was good though.  One burger was good enough for me but one of the guys ordered an extra one that nobody wanted to eat.  So I offered to help him eat it by eating half.

No, it isn't the best, meatiest, most original burger ever, and the fries are kind of soggy sometimes and forgettable, but all that is meaningless when you pull in, expecting to either stand around and cast a hawk-eye for any soon-to-be vacated seats in the crowded eatery, or resign yourself to consuming your greasy feast in your car, made that much better by In-N-Out's well-executed cardboard container trays. 

I like the reputation of In-N-Out for being a good company, who treats it employees well and pays them decently. I like how this reputation seemingly trickles down to my actual experiences with the employees, who are always chipper and efficient (sans Chick-Fil-A's sometimes eerily robotic, hyper cheeriness). I like that the restaurant I frequent when I'm in Vegas always seems to be quite clean, and that the price is so reasonable for a luscious burger and fries with a drink ($7 and some change). I appreciate the nifty cardboard container trays that display your food neatly so you can consume on-the-go, in your car, or if necessary, standing up because there are no seats available. And goodness, that legendary ""Animal-style"" burger is so, so delicious: two thin, crispily-laced burger patties, cool crunchy pickles, melty hot cheese, grilled onions that manage not to reek, and richly fatty sauce, all sandwiched between two warm, soft but sturdy buttery/toasted buns. Add those little shoestring fries and an ice-cold Diet Coke and I am SO HAPPY. And, although the feast is a caloric bust, I don't feel gross and sickly like I do after eating at most other fast food chains.

SO good, I guess it is a good thing for my waistline that there isn't an In-N-Out in my residency.",FcBDHJQEJ_n0RV4hZsJu9A,4,4,4,t_9uzoyHuKvonewoLLjdsg

Other people in the area agree, the line out the door and the line for the drive-thru going out into the street and almost to the I-15 on ramp while the other fast food neighbors are pretty dead is telling: everyone loves In-N-Out, including famous chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain.

He wasn't impressed. He expected a large menu of every burger combination possible complete with foie gras and shittake mushrooms.
Sorry, this isn't that sort of place. Here they keep it simple, honest, and fresh.

The waits are long, almost 30 minutes sometimes. You do weird things like put bible verses on your packaging. Your sauce is ~mysterious~ And still, I always come back.

Five Guys and Smashburger both give you a run for your money. But to get a double-double with fries and a drink costs less money than a basic burger at those two places. Mind you, that's before the fries and the drink.

The milkshakes are Ixcacao-approved contraptions! The special sauce is probably the closest you'll ever see to me eating anything with a mayo-base. You season and blend it well enough with whatever else you use in it to take away that icky mayonnaise taste from it.

The long waits for your food show your dedication in making a quality product. The long lines show that it is indeed something worth waiting for. The fact that you, a California institution, sees Nevada as a worthy contender for expansion shows your generosity. 

I practically grew up on you, In-N-Out. And for that, you'll always have my heart. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
In-N-Out
Quality.
A local institution practically.
Milkshakes to die for.
A secret menu that goes on for days. 
Retro decor. 

Cons: 
Not open 24 hours.

Best cure for a hangover ever.    This place is right off the strip so it's kind of too far to walk to, but you can see it right over the highway.

In & Out is what some would consider Las Vegas's Chick-fil-A [since we don't have one of these fine establishments].

There's a lot of hype surrounding this place, but not quite enough taste to back it up. Don't get me wrong, it's good...REALLY good for the price...but it's not in the same conversation as Shake Shack or Five Guys. It's just too ""fast foody"", if you will.

Well we may not have the answers to some of these conundrums for a while (unless you've recently been abducted by aliens), but I was able to find a conclusion to that last one.

So maybe I was late to the proverbial party, but I hadn't had the opportunity to try In-N-Out for the first time until I ended up in Nevada back in September. The trek to this spot from Las Vegas Blvd is not as straightforward as one might hope, but I do pray someone reads this review and learns it is walkable, I promise!

Once there, you'll start to get this feeling like you're entering into a genuine food experience. I mean the place isn't spectacularly designed, but between the retro logo and little palm trees across the counter, you get this subtle Californian vibe you didn't know you wanted and you're glad you got.

The line was several people deep, but In-N-Out is a well-oiled machine and lives up to its name with the way it takes orders, calls out numbers, and keeps people moving. Plus, you can't really spend a while choosing because the menu is basic. Burger, Cheeseburger, Double Double (you can figure that one out), fries, and shakes. 

Okay, I'm no food novice. There's a little more to that menu than meets the eye, and I wasn't about to miss out on it. Animal style fries? Check. Neapolitan shake? Check. Throw in a Double Double and we're good....well, maybe I let my eyes do the talking because I also added a hamburger to that order (more on its unfortunate demise in a sec).

Verdict? Really good. Aesthetically, the Double Double was beautiful and it stayed together nicely through each juicy, meaty bite. The flavors blended perfectly and created a fast food burger above the caliber of most others. Beyond that staple, I did enjoy my beastly fries, though they fell a tad short of my expectations. I mean cheese, grilled onions, and their secret spread still tasted great on top of it all so don't shy away from this secret selection. The shake rounded things out nicely with its trio of flavors. 

Overall, I'm glad to have an answer to that edible life question: In-N-Out Burger is good. I'd say it's even great. Amazing? Maybe not, but I do wish my stomach was big enough to have eaten that extra burger. He met an untimely end in a garbage can along The Strip because I just couldn't eat anymore.

Let me tell you a little story about a wedding.  As a pre-wedding party, the soon to be newly appointed MR. and MRS. Thought it would be a good idea to order 100 burgers, quarter them and serve them as appitizers as part of a pre wedding party in a massive suite with a giant deck overlooking the strip.  

When we (and I'm not the MR in the equation, jut a helpful friend)  went to the place the order, the guy at the counter was in shock.  He looked like he wanted to say.  ""Wait.. How many?  You know if you eat that many, there is a high possibility that you might die of a hard attack.""  Dont worry my good man,  these burgers (some animal style and some not) will be disbursed among the good people that came to Las Vegas to watch us get wed.

So yeah,  Me, the MR and MRS ordered about 100 burgers.  But thats not the best part.  We arranged to pick up these burgers at 8pm that night.  So what do we do.  Order a burger right then and there, fully knowing that there would be plenty to go round later.

Finally had a few hours to kill before my flight left and decided to make a pit stop here with a buddy of mine.  He was broke from the Vegas shenanigans so I offered to front the bill.  Between him and I, we had to double doubles (made mine animal or something), two sodas, and split an order of fries.  This only cost about $15, not a bad deal.

Not an extensive menu to choose from and after asking the guy at the counter, it was pretty straight forward to figure out.  Basically, how hungry are you?  Explained a little further down, I should have opted in for the choice below the double double, but I have no regrets.

The wait wasn't excruciating, granted we stepped in and ordered before a herd of about 20 people rolled in, but it was about a 5 minute wait to get the order.

Fries were meh...tasted like 10 minute old McDonalds fries, which is still good but meh.  THE BURGERS, MY GOD!  I don't know their trick but the patty was kinda crunchy on the very edges and just the right amount of greasy.  I can compare the taste to Elevation Burgers free range burgers, if anyone is familiar with them, they are in my top choice of burger joints.  My buddy had no trouble polishing off his double double but, sadly, i was a bite and a half from being able to finish before my stomach finally told me that my eyes were bigger than it was.

This is going to be the new tradition of being the first or last stop in my Vegas trips.  I can't believe it took me 6 trips to Vegas to even try it out.

My friends and I asked our taxi driver to go through the drive thru window here because I wanted to check out what all of the fuss over this place was about. I got the Double Double Animal style w/ fries and a lemonade to drink. I enjoyed the burger, but felt it tasted almost exactly like a Big Mac from McDonalds (maybe a little fresher). The fries weren't seasons very well, if at all. While I enjoyed the food, I just didn't feel it was anything worth mentioning, and certainly not worth driving a distance away for. 

For all my friends on the West Coast always telling me how great this place is, I was anything but impressed.

stepping off the plane, my friend and I wanted our very first stop to be In-N-Out, so we took a taxi there...yep, WITH our luggage...and found a table near probably the only outlet in the place, where the workers kept coming by asking if we were fine... not even giving us any sort of fuss about charging our phones and waiting for our third person to arrive two hours later.
*quick shout out to worker Ed for making us laugh with stories about how much Spirit Airlines sucks*

So the food:

I did a little research and found out about the secret menu and ordered the Double Double - Animal Syle combo. This was fast food but it was so different from McDonald's or Burger King. The beef tasted fresher and the animal style hint of mustard plus the secret sauce really made it stand out. 

No matter what time you go, there's always a line but the employees (there's like 40 people back there) are quick and organized.

Oh and the misconception about In-N-Out is that they're more expensive than most typical crappy food chains like McDonald's. Which is not true. For a cheeseburger with the typical vegetables compared to a Bacon McDouble sandwiched in bleach white bread at McDonald's it's the same price.

Excellent quality, employees wear gloves, they are extremely friendly and attentive to the customers needs and don't argue, everything is consistently organized, their coke products are ALWAYS fresh unlike the McDonalds across the street who have ghetto people with shitty ass cocky attitudes and give you hardcore attitude, this place RESPECTS customers.

Don't spend your hard earned money at a crappy place like McDonalds(because cheaper prices mean cheaper experiences). Spend it somewhere that actually respects the money you earn. From what i was told when i tried to get a job there, the employees at In-N-Out actually love their job because of the good pay they earn, the organization of the work, the simplicity of the menu, and the consistency in business they get from the quality they serve unlike McDonalds where the employees feel like they have to work their and hate their lives and only work for a paycheck.",j7SH8LM1L8eExP2AO71UbA,0,0,5,XiECyQ5SboylJJDU_B8MbA

This is probably the busiest location in Las Vegas as it's the closest to the airport and The Strip.  They are always busy and there's always a line but they work pretty quickly and efficiently that the wait time isn't too long.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating available.  

The customer service is always pretty good both inside and at the drive-thru.  What I thought was pretty neat was that when you order from the drive-thru, they ask if you'll be eating in your car because they give you paper place mats to put on your lap if you plan to eat in your car.  Pretty nifty In-N-Out!

Their menu is simple yet so satisfying.  They only offer a few types of burgers but they do the job pretty well.  You can also ask for ""animal style"" burgers or fries, it's their own concoction of a sauce-very similar to Thousand Isle dressing.  I've had it but the burgers and fries taste delicious all on their own and you don't really need the dressing. 

I love, love, LOVE their french fries because they're freshly cut potatoes.  You can actually see the employees behind the counter using their handy-dandy potato slicer.  This makes that much of a difference because the fries taste so much better if they haven't been frozen.  

I think it's awesome that this location draws so many tourists.  Every time I'm here, I feel like I'm at the airport.  One, because it's so busy and two because I always see so many tourists and hear all types of accents.  There have been numerous times where I'll see a couple with like, 4 burgers and 4 orders of fries just trying to get their In-N-Out fix as they don't have one back home.  It's pretty hilarious but totally understandable.  

I really wish there was an In-N-Out back home in Hawaii. We desperately need some good quality and low-priced fast food joint like this!",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,2,6,5,LStmcOm6YqcG5zmES-PBpQ

Much better than McDonalds or Burger King that's for sure. The fries is what really got me. It was the absolute worst fries I've ever had. No exaggeration, it tasted like cardboard. Now I see why people order it ""animal style"" to mask how absolutely tasteless their fries are. My friend assured me that it's much better in California (probably true). I made the big mistake of having my first In n Out experience in Vegas apparently.

In conclusion, In n Out isn't that great in Vegas. You should try Carl's Jr. instead which was my favorite. Fat Burger is decent too.",o65m3ddoFQHX6fkpnWfxPQ,4,0,3,rXWzqPyriANMbvRCQxtxXQ

It was something my mother wanted to try, and decided that's what we were doing for dinner that night. This was the closest location to where we were. 

Unfortunately, the parking lot was completely filled, and the drive-thru was overflowing. So there was almost no chance of parking. My mother has a handicap placard and so we were going to park there. If we didn't, we would have to go find parking somewhere else, like a block or two away and then walk back to the restaurant. 

What gives this place one single star is the fact the handicap parking place was filled... by an employee in uniform hanging out with his friends during his break. Obviously the friend couldn't find parking any better than we could, and just took a spot that wasn't meant for him. My brother, who was driving the car said something to the employee, who was very clearly just standing at the vehicle and talking/laughing with his friends. The employee basically said, sorry. Sucks to be you. It left a very bad impression. The employee treated it as if to say, look around. Do you really think you matter? This place is full. Who honestly gives a shit that you aren't going to eat here? That was the attitude this employee had, and it was absolute and complete disrespect. So we left. 

Would I return? Absolutely not. I don't need to go somewhere that employees disrespect potential customers, as well as people with disabilities and their need to use a clearly marked handicap parking space to bullshit with their friends on a busy night. There's more than one In-N-Out in Vegas. We went to find another one, and I'm glad we did. They didn't treat it like a frat house either.

But but but, the animal style burger was very good. And the price tag was even better. We were completely sticker-shocked after spending a few days in Vegas. Side note here but if you ever wander up and down the strip, take note how much a cup of coffee costs at Starbucks. Outside the casinos: $1.40. Inside the casinos: $2.80+ Soo... how can a burger cost $2??? Which, of course, just made me even more angry that night when I paid $46 for the Wynn buffet...

I would definitely recommend getting the burger animal-style... bf likes his burgers ""classic"" and he got screweddd. what a sucker. The difference lies in the pickles, the caramelized onions, and the sauce. He got... I don't even remember what was in it besides tomato, lettuce, and cheese because I took a bite and went ""HA!"" then continued eating mine.

Still, West Coasters need to stop prancing about In-n-Out like it's the queen of freaking Sheba. One friend (from California, mind you) claimed the burgers in the LV joint weren't as good as the ones from California. For that, I call his big fat bluff.
