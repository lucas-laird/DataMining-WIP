While we were still eating I ordered some food to go for my kids at home & then when we got the bill we were charged $1.20 for a ""to go"" fee.  Being in the restaurant business I understand about a to go fee but only if you were to walk up to the counter or call in a to go order.  We were diners still dining in your establishment & we still got this ""to go"" charge.  I complained to the cashier & she recommended that I fill out this card that she handed to me & yes a female manager called me back but told me what I already got charged for.  There are so many other places in the area that you can get food to go without being hit for a to go fee & that is what I will do next time.  I mean come on, you rely on locals for business then treat them like that.  I really like the food here but will take my business to Sam's Town, Boulder Station, or Arizona Charlies instead.

Sandwiches and burgers in the $7-8 dollar range are above average. I recommend the triple decker reuben sandwich- lots of good quality corned beef- ask them for the dressing on the side though as they tend to drown it. Burgers are good- recommend the patty melt. Downside is the fries are sub par.

I've also tried a couple of their Chinese dinners and they aren't too good IMO- pass on those.

Service is typical Vegas- hit or miss and usually at a snails pace.

644070,2014-03-05,0,jLHE095dxq83qNVNndqUFQ,"I don't know if it was my low, practically nonexistent  expectations of this restaurant, or my hunger but I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. It was solid coffee shop food. Not cheap though as I would expect from the East side Cannery,  I paid $8.99 for the Southwestern Chicken sandwich and fries.  I was torn between my normal coffee shop pick of eggs benedict or breakfast, as I pretty much know what to expect from coffee shop breakfast or the risky chicken sandwich pick - I took the risk.  I was expecting the chicken sandwich to be jerky dry as is my general experience with chicken sandwiches. The chicken was a little dry but by no means as dry as I thought it would be. The bacon the sandwich was not crispy, possibly the precooked microwavable kind, but it was edible. The portion size was decent and I left quite full for lunch.  The chipotle mayo was on the side which was great because then I could gauge how much mayo I put on the sandwich. I didn't try the pickle. You could choose between potato salad, coleslaw or french fries. I picked french fries they were frozen, not fresh, but at least they were hot when they came out.  I will say that I used a little trick I learned from a friend and ordered the fries without the salt to guarantee that they would have to make them/fry them upon order and I wouldn't get fries that had been sitting around. I don't always do this but based on the other yelp reviews complaining of cold fries I felt this was an strategy that needed to be implemented here. Service was extremely slow and lunch took well over an hour, but our server was friendly at least. 

So I was also debating between ""meh"" two stars and A-OK three stars, but with the friendly service I picked three - yes there are better coffee shops out there so I would probably give them 2 1/2 but as it stands and we can't do 1/2 stars I will go with A-OK.  I don't anticipate ever going back as this really wasn't my cup of tea and it is not conveniently located for me but if you are there already it is solid coffee shop fare.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,3,3gkumlzlBbf1Wsz9AJnC3Q

Meat was thin, tough and tasteless, bun was dry, fries cold, and coleslaw was warm and tasted rancid.  

We had a nice server but she didn't come back to check on us (no doubt she new how bad the food was), she showed up after we stacked up the plates and said we have to order a drink with the special and she didn't know that.  We ordered a drink which took a long time to arrive, along with our bill.

When paying, we were asked how it was and I said pretty much inedible.  She said we should have told our server and that was the end of that.

Stupidly, we went back in the morning because you get a free breakfast and we thought how can they screw up eggs and toast!

I think I've tried almost everything on the menu -- from breakfast : skillets, biscuits with gravy, pancakes, waffles, the usual bacon, eggs, omelettes, to lunch : chicken wings/fingers with fries, burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads, and dinner : infamous fried chicken with mash & veggies, prime rib, New York steak, spaghetti and meatballs, fettuccine, salmon, and their Chinese food.

A well rounded menu if you ask me. I guess something for anyone to enjoy.

Few of my favorites..
*Fried Chicken - always told it's made to order, can take 20-30 mins to make, comes with side of potatoes and veggies. I've asked to change to veggie to broccoli and broccoli is a $1 more.. Why? Because it's the only other veggie they have? 
Chicken is nonetheless very crispy on the outside and really moist and juicy on the inside.
*Pork Fried Rice - the usual BBQ pork, peas and carrots type of fried rice, really simple yet done right!
*Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles - crispy noodles topped with gravy, carrots, bokchoy, baby corn, mushrooms, and beef, I love ANY pan fried noodles!
*Chicken Potstickers - my son's favorite, pan fried and filled with lots of chicken, I believe it's 6 in an order.
*Wor Wonton Soup - love the broth, wontons are filled with lots of meat, and veggies are always cooked right.
*Breakfast Skillet - big portion for one order, your choice of meat, veggies, cheese, all scrambled with eggs on a bed of potatoes.

I must add they're 30% inconsistent.. I've gone here and have had some of the items a bit on the saltier side or not cooked right at all.
Service is a hit and miss too. Otherwise they're all still friendly.

Really can't go wrong especially if you're in the area or in the Eastside Cannery gambling because we know how long (or short) that could take and can leave you being hungry after winning (or losing)!",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,5,4,3,bwctj8ZONWNFuzzXzRLKYw

They have great specials and so many options. From Asian Specialties and all day breakfast favorites such as steak and eggs or French toast, you really can't go wrong by choosing to eat here.

If you play in the casino and have a players card, be sure to ask for a comp from the hosts.

I enjoy the steak and eggs as well as the shrimp cocktail. Both are inexpensive and will keep you full for the daily grind on the casino floor.

There's never too long if wait and service is quick.

If you're pressed for time, you can also place your order To Go!

They need to be doing more than just filling drinks and cleaning tables. The busser was filling our drinks to the point that it was annoying they didn't even need to be filled. But the opposite with the server, she was so overwhelmed we barely saw her. While she ran around like a chicken with her head cut off the busser repeatedly wipe down the same clean table over and straightened placemats on the same table. Restaurant 101, allow your busser to have more tasks to lighten the load of the server which is going to result in a happier customers who come back. If I wasn't a server and able to see what is happening I may not come back. 

Additionally when we were sat it was an extremely long time before we saw a server and when we asked the busser about the server she stated she's in the back. And just continued filling drinks never attempted to go find the server. Obviously the server is busy and can't drop everything right that second but any restaurant I've ever worked in over the course of the 20 something years that I worked in restaurants if you see (which I'm sure she did) a table that is sitting there for a ridiculous amount of time and they ask for a server, then you need to go get a manager and the manager needs to take the order. To try to salvage the situation. All of this is a reflection of management and not the team.

Lastly the fruit plate says it comes with a muffin but the muffin didn't come on my plate when I asked for it I got a minuscule itty-bitty tiny muffin that smelled like a foot. When I started to unwrap them up and I smelled is rancid terrible smell and I put it closer to my nose and almost puked. The fruit plate is almost $10 if you can't provide a decent muffin then take the muffin out of the description. When I went for breakfast I experienced very good service. Biscuits and gravy are disgusting. All the other reviews on here that they are really good blows my mind, if you want really good biscuits and gravy consistently go to the skyline. I've lived in this town for 20 something years and still haven't found anybody that can compare to them. The biscuits and gravy here need some kind of salt and pepper maybe some bacon grease or sausage grease, it's basically cream with disgusting pieces of huge chunks of meat. You need to salt the fries when they come out of the fryer. Also I cannot stand when restaurants deep-fry bacon. It's lazy and it ruins the bacon.

On our last visit a year or so ago, I really thought that we were in a low quality Denny's.  The food was bland and yucky.  Both our items seemed like they had just come out of the freezer bag and off the warming rack.

Then last night we took a chance and hit it up again and I am so glad to report that the food quality has gone way up from our last experience.

I wanted prime rib and they were running a $9.99 special.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought I'd take the risk and I am glad I did.  The prime rib was amazingly good.  Juicy, tender and very flavor-able.  For a minute you could close your eyes and imagine yourself @ Lawry's!!! Well maybe not quite that, but very, very good.

My wife had the Chinese and it too was tasty and fresh.  

I hope they keep these improvements since it's a place that is close to home and I like to play the nickle video poker machines at the Eastside Cannery.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,0,0,4,vvsbrIBm1V-Hw1cl4X9DOQ

3519838,2012-12-29,0,jLHE095dxq83qNVNndqUFQ,"While driving around on Christmas Eve looking at Christmas lights we passed by the Eastside Cannery and decided to see what they had to eat.

After looking at the menu at Snaps we knew this would be the place to try something new. It is decorated with a 1960's feel. 

The hostess greeted us and seated us right away. It was just after 8 pm and they were pretty busy. I was at least given a menu to look over but it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and get our drink order. It was frustrating but since it was Christmas Eve and they did appear busy I figured it might not always be like that.

We started off with ""Idaho Potato Wedges"" that only cost $3.99. It had Shredded Cheddar, Sour Cream, Chopped Bacon, and Green Onions on the wedges. You will get way more then you thought for the price and they taste great.

Since it was so cold outside I thought the ""Homemade French Onion Soup"" sounded comforting. It was! The portion was perfect and the Swiss Cheese was just bubbling over the top. Under the cheese a very thick bread that soaked up and held up nice considering all of the yummy cheese on top of it. The broth had a very deep flavor and the onions were so flavorful. It only cost $4.50!!!

My man had what they call a ""Monster Burger"". It has Fried Egg, Onion Rings, Cheddar Cheese and Pastrami. He had them leave the egg off. He said the burger could have been seasoned better but the pastrami was very good. 

The inside was clean and the staff friendly.

You can choose booth or table. They have some bigger tables for larger parties. 

They serve beer and wine. There is a bar and they have plenty of tvs to watch sports on.

If you are hankering for some Chinese food they have a separate Chinese menu!

At one end of the bar you will notice the take out sign for all to go/pick up orders.

Check the website for the Cannery to see the deals/promotions they have going on in Snaps. They currently have a few very good meal specials.

I had the prime rib dinner that came w/soup or salad, dinner rolls, baked or mashed potato and vegetables.  Not a bad deal at all.  The rolls were actually really yummy, but they had the super market baked taste.  I chose soup - chicken noodle that came in a cup the size of a large tea cup.  The salad was standard - ice berg lettuce.  My steak was a really good size.  Not the best prime rib of course, a little over done.. not cooked too properly, but still good.  Came w/tons of butter, au jus sauce and horse radish.  Can't beat that!

The breakfast special was good too, I had the pancakes w/sausage and the pancakes were enormous and fluffy!

Their menu, for the most part, is pretty standard with a few exceptions. All the traditional American fair is here, along with a Chinese menu. I can't really recommend the Chinese dishes, I've ordered off that menu twice in the past and wasn't impressed either time.

My wife and I ordered the club sandwich and the fried chicken. They warn you when you order the fried chicken that it is made fresh to order and usually takes between 20 to 30 minutes to make. Trust me that the wait is worth it if you like fried chicken. It's really juicy and perfectly seasoned. As for the club sandwich, it was great, mainly due to the bread. It's served on parmesan toasted bread and filled with sliced turkey, avocado and bacon. The parmesan bread kicks it up a notch and just makes this club standout over a typical one.

It had a large bed of Napa cabbage and sliced red bell pepper along with mandarin oranges, crispy chow mein noodles and cashews. The cashews really made the salad they were roasted and crispy.

- We were a little bit nervous ordering Chinese food in a restaurant called Snaps, but it turned out to be pretty good. Although very salty, but I think that's how most Americans prefer their Chinese food, drench was soy sauce. 
- Friendly service. Attentive. 
- Nice diner setting. 
- The upgrade didn't apply to the chicken. It was 7.99-4=$3, not (7.99+1.49)-X=$3. Lame
- I'd probably come back when they have another deal in the mail or possibly for the breakfast specials.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,5,4,4,Q1Xx3CiAqf5OUSAXgK8Zqw
5513410,2013-04-29,0,jLHE095dxq83qNVNndqUFQ,"I have eaten at Snaps a ton of times since they opened up the Cannery.  Hell, I even liked the diner at the old Nevada Palace when it was here.  The Eastside Cannery is close to home and it's a well run casino that is welcoming and warm.  The employees are great all around the casino and the same could be said at Snaps.  

I try and have dinner with my folks once a week.  Usually on my night of carb-feasting.  But, last week I went to a couple of UYE's and didn't get a chance to.  So, I made sure I would hook up with them this weekend.  I'm not much of a food snob and I'll go anywhere that is decent.  So, Snaps, the diner at the Eastside Cannery, was the call.  I like diners, there is always something  for everyone.  The menu varies, breakfast any time of the day to a Chinese menu.  But, I knew that I wanted breakfast with extra hash-browns.  That is a great carbload for me.  So, here was our night:

Parking is always easy to find at the Eastside Cannery.  I don't mind a little walk but, they have a shuttle if you need it.  Nice touch.  Anyhow, I met my folks in front of the restaurant and we were immediately seated in the back near the kitchen.  Our drink orders were taken pretty quickly.  Our waitress, Ronnie, came to our table to see if we had any questions before we ordered.  But, since we have been here many times before we knew what we wanted.  Ronnie takes our order and our drinks came out as soon as she left.  

The place was quiet - except for a drawing going on in the main casino and a nasty hum coming from the sound system.  That kind of got on my nerves but whatever.  It was quiet because one, it's a Sunday night and two, we were there at 5:00 pm.  It's what you get when you eat with the retired.

Our meals come out and everything looked great.  The food was hot and our drinks were always being refilled.  As we were finishing our meals I realized that I didn't get my 2nd order of hash browns and Ronnie made sure to take it off of the bill.  She was apologetic but it happens and wasn't a big deal.  So, for dinner it was just around the $30 mark and we left satisfied.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,2,1,4,GKGfkqTdQ10juLF5Tq3g3g

We have tried breakfast, soup's, dinners .Depending on the time of day we have always received our food pretty fast and have never had a problem.

I have tried a few of the Chinese dishes here and have liked what I ordered. I also have gotten the  Cobb Salad  for $8.99 which is not too bad and it comes with 
Turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, bleu cheese, eggs and cucumbers... Its a good size and really enjoyable!

Over the years of course depending on the server you get you usually always get good service as well.

If you gamble at the cannery you may receive coupons in the mail to use. That has been awhile since I have received any, but they do it.

They are open 24 hours but we have gone where they closed down for cleaning. 

Check them out when your in Cannery. The food is not bad at all.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,14,11,4,Ufsl1NASu_MG1QWoCcLIeQ

I never got past the Chinese menu, and was generally pleased with what was served.  But there were a few dirty utensils that needed to be replaced, and bits of sticky rice were found in two empty soup bowls which were quickly removed for new ones.

Vegetable Egg Rolls were tasty dipped in a very good vibrant, light Sweet & Sour Sauce, and well-prepared pan-fried Potstickers tasted very good.  Wor Wonton Soup contained an ample amount of bok choy, broccoli, celery, carrots, peapods, bamboo shoots, shrimp, chicken, pork, and juicy pork-filled wontons.  Kung Pao Shrimp featured baby corn cobs, celery, carrots, peanuts, sweet Red Peppers, hot Red Chili Peppers, and of course shrimp in a very spicy sauce.  Diane pronounced her Fish n Chips as good but ""really greasy.""  Service was friendly, efficient, and ubiquitous.

Mmmmm yes they do make a great shake, the glass is rimmed with the most sweetest and thick caramel one could imagine. Really adds a nice taste blend with a vanilla shake when you scrape the sides of the glass with your spoon! Can you say ""Mouth Orgasm""?

I used to dine here a lot with my boyfriend Chris as he lived around the corner from Snaps. We ate here several times a month for close to a year and a half so we have tried many meals here! We still talk about our old Snaps days, lolol. Yes, seriously the restaurant is called ""Snaps"".

Service is hit and miss, sometimes we are ignored and sometimes they are up my ass with servicing me. 

The food quality is good and so are the portions. 

I really like having breakfast here, I think that is really their specialty.
Can't go wrong with denver omelet, pancakes, french toast and their signature skillets. Make sure you are HUNGRY! 

I have also tried from the Chinese menu and they make a great sweet and sour shrimp. Huge shrimps, mmmmm. 

They have a great sourdough burger in which I believe they now call the ""Frisco"" burger. Mmmmm try it, you will see what I am excited about. I have to cut this burger down with a knife every time just to fit it all in my mouth to eat. Thick buttery fried sourdough bread, bacon, guacamole, double cheese, 1/4 Angus patty, lettuce, tomato, purple onion and fried onion strings. Mmmmmm is soooooo good! 

Prices are reasonable however are slowly increasing lately and the restaurant is very comfortable with booths and tables. 

Snaps is located inside of the Eastside Cannery.

Try it!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,10,8,3,FLz-Sl9oVdRnabuOPTrlog
