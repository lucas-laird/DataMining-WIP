Came in on a random week night , in town for a work conference... sat at the bar. 2 other people walked out and one other person commented to me about bad service. Pretty bartenders but seem to good to be friendly to patrons.  Also, and this seems to be a major issue for a few people here, a guy in a suit outside the Mirage is handing out 2 for 1 fork know coupons for this place. Turns out that is ""only for 2 types of beer and ""well"" means ""well vodka soda"" only. That's it. And they don't seem to understand why that is not cool with a lot of people. 
Update: my 1 well vodka and soda (because that was the only ""well"" option apparently, was $17.",kQrOS9q2B3ZU_8rR4nZoJQ,2,0,1,w2GO3f-0U3SyAK4mRf86QA

We were going to the ""Love"" Beatles Cirque de Soleil show and just wanted to grab something easy to eat and have some drinks before the show. When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess informed us that there was a $50 minimum per person to sit at a table during major sporting events (i.e. Thursday night football, Saturday college football and Sunday NFL football). This was listed no where on the MLife/The Still website when I made the reservation over 2 weeks ago. She said it was a very new rule and understood our frustration because it wasn't anywhere on the website. We could sit at the bar where there was no minimum, but there were no seats available. It's too bad, because the tables were mostly empty and we probably would have had a $50-$70 bill had we sat down to eat and drink.",teANKueNXDX2-gqo4BU-fQ,0,0,1,efTLjsTYY1zpE3PydRtYCQ

Let me say that Mirage serves some decent beers at its various establishments. So you can always find a good beer. 
The Still had about 50 beers. 25 were mainstream things to cater to regular non snobby beer guys. 
Of the rest there were some excellent beers most of which I'd sampled. So if you are looking for something different. Prob try yard house, public house, Holsteins.

757534,2016-04-11,1,zQmHSe6IOiSNF84m9BVZ8A,"This is one of the biggest scams as a restaurant. It's a fantastic place if you want to pay double for everything. First, you have to pay for your drinks separately from your food. It's some weird food truck concept inside of the Mirage. The waitress was nice, but she could have warned us that the drinks would be double priced. And I'm not someone who gets mad over price if the atmosphere and service are spot on, but it's basically a jazzed up sports bar. We didn't even order food. This is Vegas. Big and great should be what happens. I looked at the portions of food for the price and I knew I was walking out. The only reason I stayed for the drinks is because I don't believe in sending things back just in price when I am surprised. All we had was a Long Island with shelf liquor ($25) and a White Russian ($16). I just feel like I was rammed with no lubrication. After that, I definitely wasn't going to walk up to their ""Food Truck"" and order food. Yet again I know it's Vegas. I expect to pay high prices, but I also expect a great experience for those prices. I pay for Bobby Flay. I pay for Emeril's. I pay for Gordon Ramsey. They are worth it. This place is not and I've heard a number of people complaining of the same thing.

Our bartender slaps a single coaster in front of us then disappears forever. Few minutes later, another bartender slaps a drinks special menu in front of us...and disappears forever. Literally took 20 minutes to get first drink. 40 minutes later, we are hoping for a second drink, bartenders actively ignoring us. Deliberate avoidance of eye contact, ignoring the polite hand wave, another 10 minutes before we got our second drink. And the drink order was wrong. The bartenders have so much attitude and so little professionalism. As a long-time Las Vegan, with an out of town guest, I was embarrassed. Suggestion to management-if you're going to hire club girls and boys to bartend at a high volume bar, give them a little training.

Huge bar and a food truck located inside of the restaurant that you order from. We tried four things: wings, steak tack, fish and chips, and chips and salsa. WE LOVED EVERYTHING. We are from Ohio and it's hard to find chicken wings that are good out of the Ohio/ PA/ NY Region and we were pleasantly surprised. The couple next to us also got tacos and were raving about them. The food took about 10-15 minutes to be delivered to us and the bar staff was really friendly. They have a huge selection of beer, cocktails ect so you won't get bored waiting for your food trying all the different drinks they have to offer.

1.  Yes, its convenient.  The Still is located on the casino level of the Mirage Resort and Casino, near the guest elevators right across from the Pantry Restaurant.

2.  Yes, its quite convenient.  They were open till midnight the night my brother arrived.  Not wanting to venture outside of the hotel, we choose the Still literally out of convenience reasons.

3.  Yes, the bar area is very spacious.  The bar is impressive and has a notable presence in the center.  Tables and chairs, as well as an area in the front near the hostess stand (a good vantage point to people watch) make up the seating areas.  

4.  Yes, they have a late night happy hour.  From what I can recall, its mostly draft beers that are half off after 9pm.  My brother chose a draft beer from their happy hour selection, while I ordered a cocktail (not included in happy hour).

5.  No, placing a food order isn't that convenient.  There are food menus available at the bar (where we were seated), but guests have to physically go and order the food themselves at a ""food truck"" in the rear.  The food place will provide a number placard, and the staff will deliver the food to your seat.  My brother ordered the steak tacos which also came with a side of chips and salsa.

6.  Yes, the service was ok.

A satisfactory visit, though I'm not sure if I would return on a future trip.  In the end, the entire experience was just ok.",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,13,8,3,0vJFlSUwHLlv5KauzuhtEA

Concept is great but execution was terrible. Server was no where to be found. It was busy and there were probably like 3 servers total. They might've been short staffed which is understandable. The procedure in ordering is confusing. You have to order drinks through the server but you'd have to order tacos with the cashier at the food truck. It took about 15 minutes for me to order a drink and then I had to get up and walk over to the food truck and had to wait another 15 minutes to order since there was only one cashier.

Apparently this is a restaurant that just opened and quickly gaining in popularity. This is a sports bar and like most sports bars they have a certain type of a food there. Definitely had your drinks. Wine as well but not an extensive list.

Grab a seat and you'll be greeted by a waitress who will take care of your drink orders. When you order, you go back to the built in trailer in the back where all the magic happens. Order and pay for your food at the window and bring a number back to your table and your food will appear in just a few minutes. Lucky for me I was going for wings that night and noticed that their menu had quite a few traditional bar foods that were infused with an Asian twist. For example, the wings were Korean BBQ spicy wings. Awesome. YOU MUST TRY THIS. Because there was a basketball game on, they were half off. Who knew? So I ordered double. I also had the steak tips here that were marinated in a sriracha marinade and then served on a bed of fries. Eh, this was a little underwhelming. Not bad, but I would have prefered to have a few more order of wings to be honest.

For drinks I had just a regular Margarita on the rocks and hubby ordered the Roy Munson; Bulleit Bourbon, blackberries, lime, mint and clover honey. He really enjoyed his, I took a taste and holy hell it was strong. My margarita wasn't skimpy on the tequila either  which never hurts at all.

Good music that's not played too loud to a point that you can't hear your date lol. I wasn't starving so the appetizer's were more up to my speed for the night. Also if you are looking for a full meal type of place I think this place may not be for you because most of the menu items they offer seem to only really be finger foods and nothing that is considered a full entrée. When you check into yelp you receive as of now a free chips and salsa which by the way are great! The salsa is mild and could've been more hot and spicy but having it made mild may be the best fit for everybody. The ordering here works a tad bit weird the server girls really are just ""drink takers"" because they don't accept any food orders. Strictly drinks! When you are ready to order you actually have to go up to the dedicated window and place the order there with the cashier. After you place your order you are given a number to take back with you to your table. The chicken winds and BBQ quesadillas were the two items ordered. Now of course with this being a restaurant inside of the casino you can expect to pay more for simple items. Our wings ran about $14 and the same I believe for the quesadillas. Were they outstanding? Not at all pretty average for so the price didn't quite equate to the worthiness. $65 later I was ready to call it a night I am sure I would return...If I have a comp lol.

We were greeted by the hostess and she gave us an option of wanting to sit at a booth/table or a high top table.

My girlfriends and I ordered cocktails and water and it took our server a while to come back with our drinks and she never really came by our table to check to see if we were ready for a second round.

But anywho, there was a check-in offer for chips and salsa from the appetizer menu that we enjoyed. We also shared the sliders over fries, and an extra order of fries on the side.

3794472,2017-01-17,1,zQmHSe6IOiSNF84m9BVZ8A,"This review is in regards to customer service not the food.  I have repeatedly stayed at the Mirage and the service is fantastic so I was very stunned with the poor customer service at this restaurant!

I stayed at this casino over the past weekend to enjoy the play-offs and watch the games from The Still.  On Sunday, at about 1:15 in the afternoon before the Packers vs Cowboys game began, my boyfriend and I checked in with the hostess.  All the tables and bar area were full already  (as expected since the game was about to start).  The hostess was very friendly and took our name down and said she'd give us a call to our cell.  

We decided to watch the game steps from the front from one of the large flat screens hanging from the ceiling.  Within 20 minutes, a group of four guys walked up to the front (hostess had walked away momentarily) and they were greeted by a young guy who was sitting at one of the outer couches under the flat screen we were watching from (we thought he was a guest since he was enjoying cocktails and food while watching the game).  The four guys explained they were walk-ups and wanted to check if there was any availability.  The young guy dressed in casual jeans, a beanie, and plaid shirt proceeded to tell them there was a wait but that he would seat them at a four person table he pointed to.  The hostess walked back and the young guy (obviously worked there but was off-duty) told her that they were next to be seated.  I walked over to them as the hostess seated the group of four and explained to the young guy that we had already put our name down with the hostess and had been waiting for almost 20 minutes now.  He asked me how many in our group and I told him 2 people.  He told me, ""we aren't accommodating groups of 2, only a minimum of 4.""  I told him that would have been nice to know initially and that the hostess had not explained that.  He told me ""oh well we're not seating you two.""  I was so shocked by his response that I had to walk away before he spoiled my mood any further.  My boyfriend and I ended up getting food to-go from the cafe next door and watched the rest of the game from our room.

also...we NEVER got a call for when a table opened up.  

My frustration and disappointment is with my interaction with the young man.  The hostess was friendly and welcoming and I'm sure the food is delicious but I unfortunately never got to try it.  The Still, please continue to train on customer service and professionalism and if you have a 4 person minimum rule, then please share this with the entire staff.  

I will continue to return to this casino and will give this restaurant a second chance next time I'm in town.

2 stars for the friendliness of the initial hostess we were greeted by.",xxVnCbRgbKYv3sMAq9AuGA,2,0,2,MjS32Ovtf2-5FA89xqYfYQ

Across the way at the brand-new swanky mirage lounge, a larger and better quality Long Island Ice-T was only $16, when I asked the waitress about the horrendous  price her response was this is Vegas sir, you should know that. Then why is a long Island iced tea $12-$14 typically in any other establishment?   

OK here's the other deficiency in the  design  with this place....

Some restauranteur  who probably thinks he's a genius decided that we're going to take the popular food truck concept and we're going to park one inside of a restaurant, and then charge Bobby Flay prices for food truck portion  fried food.

Here's the best part. When the place is busy, you wait in line to get into the restaurant. They finally seat you, then they inform you that you now have to stand up and wait in line at the food truck at the back of the restaurant. No I'm not crazy, this is actually what happens

Now you're waiting at the food truck at the back of the restaurant. And you're informed that you have two bills. You have to pay the food truck at the back of the restaurant, then you have to pay separately for your beverages to the waitress at your table. No I'm not crazy, you get two bills and have to pay twice. You have to wait into different lines. And you're paying prices  higher than Wolfgang Puck's restaurants.  For fish and chips.

The Still is pretty new from what I can tell and we had a very enjoyable meal at the bar after a long travel day. The open windows, TVs, bar and music are very lively and you can look in as you walk by. The hostess led us to the bar and it was the perfect spot for us. I loved the Airstream food truck in side and that is the kitchen. We placed our drinks orders at the bar and the pretty servers took care of our wine and beer. The craft beer selection was pretty good and I opted for a Pinto Noir (it was $18 a glass so I only had one). After we ordered drinks, we stepped over to the Airstream food truck and placed our order in the window. We both ordered tacos and they come with a side of tortilla chips. The menu is nicely displayed on the side of the truck and after you pay, you get a number to put by your seat. A server brought us our tacos a few minutes later and I was really impressed with the flavor. 3 tacos for $16 was not bad at all and it was a very filling meal. Be sure to check in on Yelp as well and you can get a free order of chips and salsa. The salsa tastes homemade and authentic with the right amount of cilantro and tomato.

My group had split up... one went to Starbucks, one went to gamble, one went to the restroom, and THIS little lady went weeeee all the way to a bar--  The Still. 

I found a seat at the bar with a view of TV's and scantily clad girls serving drinks.  Okay cool.  

I waited a while to be acknowledged, and was finally given a food menu & a beverage menu (wine & beer only).  I'd asked about their cocktails when the menus were brought, but who knew the cocktails were on the back of the food menu, NOT on the beverage menu.  So basically I sat there waiting to ask, yet again, for a cocktail menu.  I wasn't there for food so I didn't even bother checking the dinner menu.  Guess that's partially my fault.  

Finally one of the girls stops by so I can ask about their specialty cocktails?  ""On the dinner menu,"" she says, okay got it.  Decided on 2 drinks & had a question about an ingredient, then I waited............

And........... 

And more.............

I tried to pretend watching TV so as not to stare them down to get their attention.  I watched the girls serve several men at the bar, from drink refills, taking orders, closing tabs, taking payment, etc., but somehow I couldn't order a drink??  

I waited for an unreasonable amount of time before slowly scooching my chair out from the bar, slowly lowering myself to the floor, slowly scooching my chair back under the bar...  I saw one girl notice my deliberately slow exit, but ""still"" (yes, pun intended) nobody hurried over to take my order.  Well dang, guess they ASSumed only men tip well for exposed boobies??!!

Service:  I sat at the bar this visit and I was greeted immediately and given a menu as I was seated.  The kitchen got the food out quickly.  The bartenders checked up on me frequently, good stuff.

The Still's Philly Cheese Steak Panini:  This quick visit I took down their Philly Cheese Steak Panini that came out with their crispy crinkle fries.  The Philly Panini was great as the ribeye and provolone really made the sandwich.  It was prepped with the perfect amount of peppers and onions.  That's a quick way to ruin a Philly if the ratio is off.

Ambiance:  The center bar is attractive and well stocked with craft beers.   They had this industrial contemporary cabin theme I can't really describe  but it's casually fun with dark wood everywhere along with the steel beer plaques adorning the wall.  In the back is an old trailer that was converted into the kitchen.  The website boasts 27 TVs and an 8,000 square feet dining area.  Definitely roomy and a great place to watch sporting events.

The Still is pricey as most restaurants on the strip are: i.e my Panini was $18 and my lone ipa was $9.  The food is good but a little too expensive to compete with similar restaurants like a Yard House or Miller's Ale house.  The service and staff is great and I was hoping there was a Happy Hour around 5 pm to 7 pm as I work on the Strip. I'll visit again just from the multiple TVs and friendly staff alone. If you're on the Strip and there's a sporting event going on, The Still is a great place to park and watch.  I'll probably catch a evening Golden Knights game there after work sooner versus later, but that's another Yelp story.  Enjoy! =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,5,2,3,E1pZQzTXazmBFeRz__OBvQ

The still has an interesting setup, with drink service at your table but an airstream trailer In the back of the room where you place your food order. The food menu is limited, but mostly solid. When you place your order there, you pay for it separately from your drink tab. They give you a numbered sign to take to where you are sitting and the food is then delivered to you. 

Overall the food was good. We got fish tacos, a chili dog, and an order of chips and salsa. We added the chips and salsa due to the free Yelp check in offer. The fish tacos were solid but the chili dog was really quite good and enormous!  Chili dog came with fries and the tacos came with chips and a chipotle sauce.

Prices were quite high for ""street fare"" but that's the new Vegas. Staff was friendly but not around nearly often enough. Beer list was lackluster but that's the expectation in LV. Overall solid and the Yelp offer helped with the overall cost.",vO-RYeLAdBMkVOJu3fy7Kg,0,0,3,lGOPujhvoJI7me3Ch-nKgQ

They're amazeballs.

As a New Englander, I can't promote their lobster rolls (nothing on the west coast comes close, sorry), but guac and chips, wings, sliders, and tacos are winners.

There are TVs everywhere to catch up on every sport, but if your party is large enough and you want extra privacy, they have a great private room in the back, which some great value packages.

We are always looking for a place to go and watch the Golden Knights games. This is our favorite place so far. Just for walking in with Knight's gear you get a free beer on game nights. Free shot every time the Knights score. We purchased their Tuesday Taco deal. $25 each for all the tacos, chips, salsa, margaritas, and tequila shots you can eat/drink. What a deal! I had my first shot ever. I'm gonna stick with the margaritas. LoL!  Our waitress was Alexis. She came by multiple times to check on us. Sweet lady. The way the food ordering works is you go up to an old Airstream RV that has been turned into a kitchen to order. Carol took our order. I loved Carol. She's like the grandma we all wish we had. She was dancing, talking to people, and loving life. She's my favorite person I've ever met out in public. She makes you want to come back to The Still just to see her! After ordering you have guys that deliver your food within 5-10 minutes. And don't get me started on the deep fried Oreos. OMG! They are a must! Sooo good!

5134941,2016-05-11,2,zQmHSe6IOiSNF84m9BVZ8A,"I can't give this 5 stars simply because I'm not a Sports Bar girl.  That said -- it's amazing I can give any sports bar 4 stars.   To be frank I'm not looking for a sports bar full of screaming men in my hotel.  I'm looking for a pub with solid brew selections and munchies.

THE STILL delivers both with ease.  Which is harder than you think in these silly casinos.  Because, you see, a proper pub is always its own location on a street -- and has been there forever.  I absolutely CRINGE when Vegas and other tourist spots manufacture a 'fake' pub.  A McPub that's too new looking or trying so hard to look 20 years old.

Somehow Still pulls off looking cozy, familiar, and friendly.  It appears to have been there for years but is only months old.  It's not a movie 'set' of a pub.  The Mirage has lacked a proper drinking spot since forever and has finally struck gold with this location. 

The seating can be 'outdoor' on couches essentially 'on' the casino floor -- but thru 'open' windows and doors table seating, bar seating, some very visible... some very discreet.  A nook for everyone.   

In the back is the food truck.  It operates separately from the bar and so... yeah... that's kinda weird.  Two checks in one business.  But hey -- my sliders hit the spot and the salty old school fries were long lost friends.  

I must sound like a shill at this point and so onto my criticisms --

1.  The food truck options were tasty but one item was definitely missing:  pizza.  The general manager said there wasn't room for a pizza oven.  I disagree.  Get creative people.  You could make mini-pizzas in a mini-oven.  Pizza 'Sliders'?  It's Vegas.  

2.   The bar and truck being separate entities.  In the sense of why you must pay two vendors two bills within one establishment.  It was explained to me why they had to be separate I'm not buying.  And it's silly inconvenient.

3.   A Stella smaller than a pint was like $9. 

4.   My most serious complaint is marketing related.  The name of this joint.  THE STILL.  Yuck.  The only thing Vegas isn't is still.  I know it's named after booze hardware, but I 'still' don't like still.  And the name is hard to remember.    

The writer in me has come up with STILL LIFE as a partial fix... but ultimately would prefer some other name.  No, not the Mirage Pub, but something with a little more life to it.  

So if you're staying at the Mirage do yourself a favor and try this place.  It will be your new best friend.  And somehow your old best friend too.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,2,1,4,RUU5jgeuECG5OwFyejx0FA

We ordered two beers and two mixed drinks.  They tried to charge for both mixed drinks.  Manager states ""he can do whatever he wants"".   You have to wonder if The Mirage let's these guys pull this within their premises,  what else are they allowing to go on? 

I would stay away from this place.",tlcugWUUYrXPtIBZ--jayA,2,0,1,6ltmAORi0zadwgDR7JO4lQ

Definitely a pricey place, but what in Vegas isn't! I decided to order Chandon, hubby got an old fashion, and a friend ordered a mule. Both DH and friend said there drink was good, and you can't really mess up Chandon!

We also decided to order some food. We went with the chicken tacos, they were amazing! But for $16, they better had been! To order food, they have a standing taco truck towards the back of the bar, which was pretty cool. Only complaint, it's too damn high! Got to remember us short people!! 

I also checked in on Yelp, and we got free fried Pb&J - AMAZING!! I'm not big on fried food, but had to try it!!

Doug, the manager on duty, and Catherine, a different server, did what they could to fix the problem; and I thanked them both. However, the damage was done.",IVqh3rm8VeXiD7JdI1iCuQ,3,1,1,S16NhjViaA2_Pue12k45dA

I liked that there are large tables and board games for groups of people to entertain themselves,  and don't understand why people are complaining about having to walk (50 feet max) to the back to order food.  The sliders were AMAZING and the Korean Spicy wings were great. Our drinks were also spot on. I do acknowledge that the food and drinks are a bit overpriced, but it is Vegas and their happy hour prices make up for it. Overall this is a great alternative if you aren't into the club scene and still want to be in a social environment.",MW19DXqXjiBFYrbKcdB-bA,1,0,5,hpoXWc_3uMDhAhnNBYt2dQ

If you're looking for a fun spot to watch sports, chill, and feel like you're not inside of a casino then this is your jam. Inside of the Mirage and towards the back you'll find The Still with a giant Airstream food truck in the back. The venue is huge with loads of bar seating and tables. They even have a man-cave where you can have a more private dining experience if you plan ahead and work it out with the venue.

The drinks are creative, strong, and your options are somewhat endless. The signature cocktails are on the pricier side averaging $16 but hey, it's Vegas! Bottles and pints are more affordable and you can get a pitcher of the beers on tap. YAAAAS! 

My favorite part of this place is the food truck. There are servers walking around but if you want food then you get up and order it yourself at the truck. You pay for it there too. I've had almost everything on the menu. My favorites are the chicken and steak tacos that are packed with flavor, the crispy fish and chips, and the chicken club sandwich. I was wildly disappointed by rice the poke bowl. The rice has been underdone twice now and the first time I ordered it, it was the last dish to arrive almost 30 minutes after most of my dining pals received their food AND the rice was crunchy. 

Great news is that their staff is friendly and the management came over right away to apologize, offer me something else, and took it off the bill. They even brought over some fried oreos for us to try and Oh. My. God. They are fluffy, chocolaty, and oh so delicious.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,19,20,4,Btec2PwD7oAtuyQ-9hjUDQ

The decor is really cute, kind of like industrial/rustic.   So the back of the restaurant is a kitchen that was built to look like a food truck.  You order drinks at your table but go to the back of the restaurant to pay for and order your food which they will bring to your table.  We ordered two orders of buffalo wings ($16 /order and a churro sundae $8).  We also ordered some drinks at the table ($8 beer, $16 other drink).  Portions were decent, we loved the wings,it was saucy but still crispy and the blue cheese dipping sauce it came with was really good with lots of blue cheese chunks.  Churro ice cream was just okay.   Drinks were good.   Overall positive experience, nice ambience and good service but minus 1 star because we thought it was kind of overpriced.",C4k1B4Dv5zrqbMNilaMmXg,0,0,4,cFpmhFOoGtHXE1yHiZAk_w
