So I was with a group of 8 and we are all young adults (18-21). It was Friday night and I understand that they are very busy. I think they were automatically biased with us since we were young. The service wasn't great. My friends never got there water after telling our server multiple times. When we asked to get more bean dip and chips the food runner acted like it wad the hardest job ever. And it took a while for our food to come out. Now I understand that it was a couple months ago.

The moment of truth: we walk in and were greeted quickly. We got our table in about 10 min. The busser asked for our drink order. 5 min later the waiter comes and asks if that's what we ordered. Mind you it was water a magarita and a chocolate milk. 

We ordered our food I got a combination enchilada Chile relleno and a taco. The taco was very greasy. Oh we asked for spicier salsa for our chips and we got charged 3.99! The enchilada tasted as if it was from a frozen package. My husband ordered the beef tongue. He asked for flour and corn tortillas and they actually only gave him one of each. When he asked for more they charged us for it. Never in my life have I been to a legitmate Mexican restaurant that charges extra for salsa and tortillas. And the kicker is every time we asked the busser for something like that salsa or those extra tortillas the waiter always came to our table and asked if we wanted that.

EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISk!!!

My client from China was in town and wanted to eat ""Mexican"". We decided to go here as my gf has previously had a good experience at the downtown location. 

The place was virtually empty with only one other table occupied. We ordered quite the spread, from guacamole, to the sea food sampler, tamales, fajitas, enchiladas, burritos, enough food that the waiter asked when the rest of the party is arriving. 

Oh, how can I forget, we also order 2 horchata's and a water. 

The water came out quite fast, but after a more than 5 minute wait, no sign of the horchata. I got out my seat to ask the waiter where the other drink were (it was a little awkward with my gf and client watching me downing my water with our chips and salsa). The waiter told me that it was coming out shortly as the current batch ""smelled sour"" and that a ""new batch is being made"". 

I accepted his response and went back to my seat. A few minutes later I saw our waiter come out of the kitchen with the two glasses of horchata. 

Before he approached our table, he stopped to speak to the manager. The manager then proceeded to take one of the glasses of horchata off our waiters tray, smelled the horchata, then proceeded to do the absolute most unthinkable thing, he took a sip of the horchata, placed the glass back on the tray, and nodded yes to the waiter. 

At this point my jaw dropped to the table. As my mind was still processing what just happened, the waiter came over and served the 2 glasses of horchata to our table without hesitation.

I looked at the waiter and asked him what are you doing serving these to us? I said no one is drinking these, nor are we eating anything here! (The waiter looked at me and realized that I saw what happened). He said he was ""sorry"" and asked me to    ""allow"" him to ""deliver better service"".

By now, I was already standing up and telling my gf and guest that we're leaving. 

Never got to try anything beyond the chips and guacamole and Las Vegas tap water.

895368,2017-02-16,0,h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A,"Last night my husband and came here for dinner and were greeted by a very friendly staff, our server, Jose S, was promptly at our table serving us our happy hour drinks and chips, salsa, and beans :)  I asked if they had a vegetarian/vegan menu, or what they could offer for vegans.  We were told they could do a veggie burrito no cheese no sour cream, or a bean tostada no cheese no sour cream.  Sounded great, so I ordered the bean tostada, and my husband ordered the burrito.  The food came out within a matter of minutes, if even that long.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced, so quick that we hadn't even really tried the chips. After we received our food we inspected the plates, we noticed that the beans on my husband's burrito were whole beans, and my tostada had refried beans.  This is huge red flag to us, as some restaurants still use lard in the beans.  We asked Jose if there was lard in the beans and he confirmed that there was. Well, I was unable to eat my tostada after that, never even took one bite. It looked great, I'm sure it was, just not for me.

My mistake for not asking about the beans before we even sat down. Been vegetarian for over 20 years and made a rookie mistake; lesson learned (again).

The chips, salsa and beer were great!  My husband offered part of his burrito, I declined and stuck with chips, salsa and beer.  He said his burrito was good.

I, in no way fault Jose, as he was extremely helpful and attentive!  I just wish we would have warned about the animal lard when we said we were vegan.  

It's really too bad, because my husband and I would have been regulars, as we really enjoyed the service and atmosphere of the establishment, but we will not be returning.  There are many Mexican restaurants in town were we can eat.

Over the years, I have seen this location change from different restaurant to different restaurant.  I was really excited to try this place. I wish them the best.",y71erP7EtXSD1EK-1A6ddg,0,0,4,F2aZMKfe0itIy98Oad1Y5Q

It took about 20 minutes to place or drink order and when it finally came out, they forgot my drink. I had to order it again, nothing fancy, just a Diet Coke. There were 6 of us there for dinner and we had to ask for additional chips and salsa rather than it being offered. We placed our orders and finally got our food. What a joke. They spread the beans out in a thin layer on the plate to make it look like more food. The chili rellanos looked like a kids sized chicken finger and the ceviche was like shoe leather. The fajitas had no flavor. Every item looked like it came off a kid's menu. We had to send 2 plates back and have them removed from the bill they were so under cooked.  First, and definitely the last, time I would ever set foot into this price gouging poor excuse for a restaurant. Poor staffing for a holiday, poor wait staff, poor food, poor judgement on our part to stay, overall a miserable experience. It was so poor, I had to re-install this app just to warn people.

After being sat, we are greeted by our server who seems nice but then another server comes over to basically tell him to take a hike bc he's taking our table. He did it right in front of us, causing some tension between the two & the new guy seemed to be kind of a dick with an ego. Then I start looking at the menu & EVERYTHING is so overpriced!

We ordered a margarita and had chips and dip and it was really good. The margarita was actually pretty good also and pretty strong.

Got his usual Vegetarian Burrito (no cheese, no sour cream...they always exclaim ""no dairy"") and I also wrote that he wanted it wet. With red sauce. Didn't come with sauce ok whatever.
The burrito was cold and he said it didn't have the same flavor as usual. He heated it up and ate it. 

Side of beans and side of rice were warm and their usual taste.

I ordered lemonade and took my chances on it not being sweet (I don't eat sugar) and it wasn't. It was strong lemon water and I loved it. 

Hubs wanted mango juice. I tried it and while yummy...wowza it was sweet af.

I ordered guacamole and it wasn't in the bag, oh well. No chips and sauce option...and the order came with none.

For fun I ordered a pineapple raisin Tamale. Wow it was weird and pink. I guess it's a flavoring in the masa. It was sweet and had a chai like cinnamon spice. Tossed into trash.
It honestly tasted just like a fruit cake!!!!!

It was fun to order but now we know that the location Downtown is better and it's better to go in and enjoy our burritos.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,8,3,2,yGW72lY_NOwdDkq0N2eDxg

Got a $10 order of nachos with carnitas and they were mediocre. Chips were super greasy, as if they were dumped directly from the fryer into the box. Carnitas were simultaneously fatty and dry. 80% of the toppings on my order were pico de gallo.

I guess their prices have to be high so they can keep paying their enormous staff: anywhere from three to seven employees were behind the front desk during my visit. They easily outnumbered the customers, and yet bickered over who was going to take my order.

HOWEVER, this review is not just for the restaurant. Its for the stellar staff of C d J.
Ate lunch there yesterday, with a friend from out of town. I was playing with my ring (its custom-made and I saved for a long time to get it), because my fingers hurt. I must have taken it off, and forgot to put it on, when our food came. It got left behind :-(
This morning when I noticed, I frantically called every business and friend I had been to yesterday. When I finally called Casa don Juan, I had all but given up hope. But the nice lady there said, ""Yes, I have it here.""
We tried to offer her and the staff member who turned it in a reward, but they wouldnt accept it. So we promised to write a review and eat there more often :-)
Which we are glad to do! Their carnitas finally gave me a reason to use the word ""unctuous"". My friend raved about her cocido soup. My husband loves their seafood. Not to mention complimentary chips, bean dip, and (yummy) salsa. This is not the cheapest Mexican food in town...but its a ""destination"". Wonderful Mexican decor. Sweet waitresses dressed as Frieda Kahlo, and jolly waiters dressed in mariachi-type outfits. AND a lady who turns out endless fresh tortillas from the griddle at the center of the restaurant.

I dragged my boyfriend here for dinner 12/13/15. It was around 4pm when we arrived, so we were seated immediately. Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to the table. Nothing to write home about, just cheap fillers.

My boyfriend was a bit under the weather so he wanted soup. Our server informed us that they do not serve soup on the weekends? Huh? I think there may have been some confusion because I have never heard of that before. Usually, soup is served on weekends only and not during the week. Plus, there were 4 or 5 different soups listed on the menu. I wanted to clarify, but he had already decided to get something else. He ended up choosing the beef fajitas, and I chose the carne asada plate. We also got a chile relleno to share.

The chile relleno was $5.99 and it was tiny as hell. I didn't like it AT ALL. The cheese was not even melted inside! It didn't look anything like the picture, which was a lot bigger and much cheesier. Super disappointed with that, and at $5.99 it's a total rip. The carne asada plate looked good though. Lots of grilled onions topped the steak. The steak lacked a bit of seasoning, but was still good and perfectly medium as I had requested. The onions really added an extra depth of flavor when combined with the steak. The rice and beans were meh. I don't usually like Spanish rice anyway, and this was no exception. The beans were the same beans from earlier, just with a sprinkle of cheese on them. I did like that the tortillas were homemade, they were really delicious. 

The service was pretty crappy. Our server was running around the dining room, so I knew he was busy, but we unfortunately suffered because of this. Our waters went unfilled for quite some time, and he never came back to check on us. It wasn't until we got a bus boy's attention that we were finally given service. He kept apologizing and telling us that he was sorry for the lack of service but they were going through a shift change. I appreciated his efforts. Finally after our server came and cleared all the plates, it was another 10 minutes while we waited for the check. This was totally not okay. I will not be back. For both of our meals, it was right around $45, with tax and tip.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,1,2,s-o11Y1PY_WPuLyb1hC-aA

The last time we got our usual takeout, it was subpar and bland. I'm hoping it was just an off night but I was really disappointed when I got home and opened the carnitas platter. I was even more disappointed when I tasted it =(

I was hesitant to come here after the over-priced, bland food we got at their downtown location a few years ago. But we live right across the street from this new location and the other restaurant we had planned on going to had a 30 min wait. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and flavors once our food arrived. I breathed a sigh of relief after the first few bites because I was expecting to be disappointed and to swear this restaurant off forever. I hope they keep it up since we live so close and it's nice to have a Mexican restaurant in this area. The service was stellar. Even the busser was incredibly friendly and super prompt clearing our plates or bringing extra chips/salsa.

The only downside was that the salsa was a bit disappointing and I still think the food could have used a tad more seasoning, but overall it tasted good. We had the carnitas platter for 2. It was the perfect amount a food for 2 but we're kind of little piggies and eat a lot. 2 normal people might have some leftovers to take home. The homemade flour tortillas were so yummy and filling!

So first i tell my self hey this place is new i love the classy sign  I'm gonna try this food also because a good mexican spot doesn't really exist in Summerlin. So it all began when i opened the door and saw 2 Angels at the register, one was a server one was i believe the hostess, they greeted me with happiness. Even was curious enough to ask about my day which then i explained. Then unfortunately i was in a time crunch so i couldn't dine in. So i did what any other logical person would do  and i ordered the regular burrito with carne to gauge what type of place this gonna be. Me and the two angels continued to talk while i sat patiently on the very comfortable seating area they have made for us patrons. Where then i started to notice all the amazing decor in this classy place Mr.Don Juan and im sure his beautiful family own. So i get my food i wish them a great day. I get to my car i start to look in the bag AND GUESS WHAT? CHIPS AND SALSA.!!! I didn't know i got free chips and salsa with the burrito. The Salsa was so good i ate all of it before i got home, making me wish i ordered extra salsa(get extra salsa if you go here) finally i get to my desk where i am sitting now excited to see what the burrito tasted like. Ever heard of love at first Bite? As i bit into the burrito i could no longer see straight all i saw was hearts and stars, just as you might see in a looney tunes cartoon. Burrito to say the least was a 10 it reminded me of this other amazing restaurant i enjoyed while i lived in San Francisco. It held its form perfectly and didn't get soggy and every bite was filled with deliciousness. Thank you Mr Juan or Don. I will be returning here for my birthday party as long as that awesome happy hour is still around! If you love yourself go here. I want to see this place stay in summerlin forever!",IKzUdQR0M3CKTCzIwq0VsA,1,1,5,trualk2QYCPG8BSOQQruAw
2477798,2017-09-05,0,h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A,"Bear is the Mexican food freak in the family, and he is constantly on the lookout for great places.  Most of what we've had so far has ranged from pretty good to 'meh', so when he scoped out Casa Don Juan online, I figured that we didn't have a whole lot to lose trying a new place.  

When we arrived, I recognized it IMMEDIATELY.  We do a lot of things around that area of Summerlin, and the Lyft cars I've been taking pass by this place all the time.  But I never thought to try eating here, so it was nice to finally get the chance. 

First thing's first: it's always a good sign, when you walk into a Mexican place, and the first thing you see is an area where the tortillas are made fresh.  When I saw that was the case here, I couldn't help but smile on the way to our table. And yes, the chips and salsa we were greeted with was ALLA THAT. 

The place itself is a bright, colorful repository of art and items that display pride in Mexican heritage.  If you didn't notice any of it, the menus sporting the images of famed artist Frida Kahlo and her other half, Diego Rivera, should be a dead giveaway.

Fresh-made tortillas help elevate any dish, and it was evident from the chicken flautas I started off with, all the way to the pork chimichanga, stuffed with so much tender, juicy meat that I barely finished it! So you KNOW we ended up skipping dessert. (Maybe next time).

As far as service goes, they have it down to a science.  Our server, Jose, was assisted by several other wait staff members, but I'd have to 'guesstimate' that we waited no longer than ten minutes for any courses we had, if THAT. 

If I had any complaints, it's that the usual combo of sides - refried beans with cheese and rice - seemed as bland as it is at other restaurants we've tried.  The flavors of the entrees make up for it somewhat, but it would be nice to have the option of whole pinto or black beans. Which, to be honest, they may have - we didn't get the chance to ask.  But I will update this review with what we discover on our next visit.

Meanwhile, Bear FINALLY has found his ""Shangri-La"" for a decent plate of huevos rancheros.  And that to me says more about how good this place is than the fresh tortillas.  We WILL be back.",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,2,0,4,ymlg6yOJZfQ5JnG9goCmKw

First of all the rice was mushy and reminded me of rice that is cooked in a bag, the refried beans were bland, as for the enchilada sauce-- it was extremely void of flavor, just salty. The chicken is cooked without sauce and then has a splash of sauce added to it before being placed in an excessive amount of masa.

2809953,2015-08-18,4,h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A,We checked this place out because our friends raved about it.  We will give it another try but this experience was just average.  First off everyone is very friendly which is a plus. Another plus is the chips. They weren't greasy at all but I had to add salt for my taste.  Good bean dip and salsa both complimentary.  My husband ordered a watermelon jalapeño margarita and I did the pomegranate margarita both very tasty.  My second round didn't taste nearly the same and when I sent it back the waiter came back and it looked and tasted like they just dropped pomegranate in the margarita I just sent back.  Hummmm.  I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it so like a sport I drank it.  After stuffing my face with chips I wasn't hungry so decided on a al la cart tamale cheese and jalapeño. Decent... I had hoped for more cheese and more than one jalapeño but whatever.  My husband ordered the fajitas... Big disappointment here. Fajitas are meant to be sizzling!!!!!! Nothing when they arrived to the table. The bummer part was the table next to us got theirs sizzling hot.  It presented like the food was sitting around for awhile.   The chicken was dry and shrimp was small.  Overall wasn't terrible will try it again but mainly for drinks and chips!  We may even take advantage of the free shuttle service that will take you home!

The servings tho are much smaller than the Don Juan restaurant downtown on Main Street. The customers are completely different. They cater more to the white retired/upper class people. Which is okay, it's just different vibe than original location. I'd rather drive the extra mile to downtown restaurant for serving sizes and the diversity of customers. Plus the waiters at summerlin location check on you every 10 minutes, but it feels as if it's every 5. Where as the other location doesn't check on you rarely at all. So that's a thumbs up to summerlin. Restaurant decor in summerlin is decorated to make upper class family feel more comfortable.

3756445,2017-10-14,0,h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A,"It really hurts me to write this review, because I used to really really enjoy coming here all the time. I would come here at least once a week and I would bring my family or come by myself. The service was great, especially Juan, and I would always take care of my waiters and leave a nice tip. The food was one of the best in town!! Unfortunately, the last few times I've come here the service was BAD, it took forever for them to even acknowledge I was there. Then last night,  I tried sitting at the bar, and the girl behind the bar was not nice or friendly at all. When I had to ask for chips, salsa, to make an order she just had an attitude. I tried to address the manager/owner lady when walking out, asking her about Juan and trying to tell her how bad the girl was behind the bar, but she just kept ignoring me and pretty much just said, ""goodbye."" 

This is why I decided to leave an honest review because I used to truly enjoy coming here, but not anymore. If I were the owner/manager I would want to know if any of my employees were not being friendly or not providing excellent service. When Juan was there he would go above and beyond to welcome me with open arms. He knew what I used to always order. I noticed Juan was like this with all the customers that came in. Since I haven't seen him there, the service has dropped tremendously. One more thing I noticed was the chicken tacos I used to get had so much more chicken, then they do now. I really hope they make some changes in a positive direction, so i can come back and enjoy this place with my friends and family again. I know I'm not the only one that has been experiencing this poor service either. I used to talk about this place to all my friends and family and they all have agreed that the service is not the same anymore.",mBkKOt_GQFkS_l66CgPffw,0,0,3,G0wl0X4XdL8zo-ayewv74Q
3756920,2015-08-30,49,h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A,"It is with heavy heart that I write my first not so good review:( 

I pondered writing this review for a while for several reasons. First of all, I swore to myself that I would only write 5 star reviews because I don't really like saying negative things about a place. I'm motivated by positive experiences not negative ones. Secondly, I didn't want the review to be clouded by my negative feelings that were initially present, as I was still shocked by the service and the bill days later! Finally, I debated on the number of stars to give since I've never written a review with less than 5. I'm an all or nothing type person so my initial thought was to give it 1 star but decided that it would be wrong to do that since I was able to eat the food and finish my drink. 

Just before posting this, I asked my daughter her opinion and she said 2 stars. She wanted to walk out after 10 minutes but she is kinda agro. She thought I was being generous by giving it 3 stars so let's just say it was 2-1/2 stars! 

I also hate writing really long reviews because I start to bore myself! However, this review probably needs to be long because there is so much to talk about. Ok here I go! 

So my daughter had just moved to Vegas,  and had been asking the locals if they knew of a good Mexican restaurant. Everyone told her Lindo Michoacan or Casa Don Juan. So when I came to visit, we decided to come here as it was close to where she lives. 

Ok I'm already bored so I'll just get to the point! Bad service, mediocre food, weak drinks, and high prices!",QgqYTatCHt5KlGJIgw6gAA,59,50,3,5ZJkzmju_Pu2ax2rH2TOIw

One start less the moment you read your bill and there is a $2.99 charge for the habanero sauce I requested. 

I've eaten here half dozen times. The salsa is ""mild"" and acceptable. I understand the demographic placement of this restaurant so that's fine. Asked the waiter for something a little hotter... And boy did that burn on the way out - no pun intended. :-) 

Spent $118 on 3 adults and 2 children. Shouldn't a salsa be complimentary on a $20 dish? It's not the 3 bucks- it's the principle. 

Paid the bill anyway and refused to have the charge removed- that wasn't the point (but they missed that). The manager on staff schooled me on the need to charge for sauce. I don't feel I needed lessons on salsa. I have eaten at many Mexican cuisine restaurants. I am native Mexican.

But trust me, everything starts to taste the same at Casa Don Juan.  I'm not usually here by choice.  When I'm here, it's probably because one of my co-workers wanted to come here and I was out voted.  I should investigate the voting, but I'll just let it go. I'll play it safe and get their fajitas. A big plate with very little substance is what you get at Casa Don Juan.  Only about 25% of the plate is the meat.  The rest is the cheap stuff like the rice and the beans.  The tortilla chips they give you is very inconsistent. Some days, they're perfect, fresh, and airy.  Other days, they're hard, greasy, and salty.  Price for a meal here isn't the best considering what you actually get.  If there's a shining moment to Casa Don Juan, then it's the service.  The servers here are marvelous. Overall, the food is just okay. I've had better.

The place was packed but they have a lot of seats so they found us a table immediately. 

The wait staff was again very friendly and prompt. However, the waiter did misinform my son on what was in his dish so when it arrived, we had to send it back (the waiter was very apologetic). 

I liked my chili relleno and beef taco combo the first time, so ordered it again. This time, the taco fell apart as it was served on a bed of grease, so I didn't enjoy that part but the relleno was tasty. My wife had the vegetarian burrito which was ""pretty good"" to her.  

We also ordered queso dip with jalapeños- I'm not a big queso fan one way or another but my wife likes it and thought it was tasty. 

Finally, I don't know what it is about ambient noise in this place but they had someone playing with the music and I guess someone on staff wanted it loud while another wanted it quieter and there was a war about it as it kept going up and down on the same song for like five minutes til the loud person won!

Overall, I think the food is good and will chalk up the other stuff to the place bring new and finding their groove. I'm not so sure if this place is as good as I thought it was after the first visit, but I think it has potential",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,1,0,3,CqKclFDsocPdvBeKdLrCCg

However, we ordered a side of queso and chips and what we got was not what we were expecting. The chips- tasty. Queso - shredded cheese in a box : / Now, two things; one every restaurant I have ever been to (between WA and TX) queso has been melted cheese dip. Two, I understand that the word means cheese. But since there are little to no descriptions on the food items, I went with what precious experience lead me to believe. In addition to this little dilemma, they didn't deliver our large coke. So after ordering $63 of food and not getting the queso (that I was expecting) and our coke, I called to let them know. This is where things got worse. The female who answered the phone was rude. There was no apology, just ""queso at our restaurant is shredded cheese and we refunded your money for the coke"". Needless to say, as good as the good was it wasn't good enough to make up for lack of customer service.

4287631,2015-05-21,2,h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A,"Thank goodness I purchased a Groupon, because this place is not worth the prices listed. I get it, you're in Summerlin and I've heard the prices are just as high at their Downtown location... but for the quality of the food, they should be lower.

Restaurants sometimes have the enormous 10 page menus, and Casa in fact does. It's a little too much with the stories and photos. If I wanted to read a book, I would go to the library. Unfortunately I was hungry. We walked in and were seated in a 2 seater mini table close to the Frida wall. My son knows about art, and knows Frida, as well as Diego Rivera, so this was pretty cool. We got to look at the prints whilst waiting for the server. I took a look at the 30 page menus and tried to decide what to order. The menu is Bilingual, and I speak and read Spanish, but for some it may be tedious. Some descriptions about the food is not on there so you either have to Google it or ask. 

It seems like the server for our section was the server for 2 others as well. The others seated after were asked for their drink order before we were, and it's probably because of the order of the tables... but still... we were waiting at least 5 minutes more than they were. Either way, we got our order in. 

I decided on the fajitas that included shrimp, chicken, and steak. My son went with a burger (basically because I make him the other items on a daily basis) we were given chips, bean dip, and salsa. My son was starving so he attacked the salsa and said it was good. The chips were pretty tasty as well. Our food eventually came out and my one request was that I did not want peppers in the fajita mixture, also, the same couple who was served their drinks first, also got their food before we did.

ANYWAY! Our food came out and the server left. I looked at my sons and it looked like your typical burger, the taste was good, and it wasn't cold so that's a plus. The fries included were thinner fries and were delicious as well... Now.. my food. Being that I ordered fajitas sans peppers I was ok with onions. I looked and there was about 4 pounds of onions. Now I like onions, just not the amount that was included... it was more like meat with my onions. Not only that, but they were caramelized to death, which was pretty disgusting after the 4th bite. The lettuce included was also brown and wilted. The steak, was cooked to death, it was also caramelized, the shrimp, the few that was included was were also on the tough side, and the few pieces of chicken I got were ok. 

The total was around $30ish, and we only ordered waters. I was going to go for desert, but, the plethora of onions killed my stomach and appetite.  I would've said something, but, our server was always running around and not in our area. I ended up with HELLA left overs, unfortunately when you try to cook food that is overcooked, the outcome is bad.

The salsa was meh, not much flavor and it isn't very chunky. We did like that the beans came with the chips. They don't offer any other salsa for free, I wish they had a salsa sampler. The green salsa or red salsa which are other options were $1.99 the habenero salsa was good in flavor and had a little more kick at to it, 4 chips in a row and you will for sure feel the heat. $2.99.  

My husband had the steak burrito wet and felt that the Asada was amazing. I had the chicken chimichanga the special portion and it was absolutely delicious, one of the best I have ever had. The chimichanga when ordered at most places can come to greasy or lacks in quality meat and cheese. This was top notch. 

Beans are important! These beans taste homemade. A  rare find in this Las Vegas version of Mexican food. 

The waiter was great, he let us know about their happy hour which we took advantage of. Here is the deal, the happy hour will be running about 3 months while they are first open and runs from open until close! 2 for 1 margaritas, beers at the right price. $2.50 to start. After we had our food and margaritas, the manager came by to make sure we were taking advantage of the happy hour as well! That is great customer service. 
I am actually not a fan of rice and beans however; theirs were on point. Real, authentic and tasty. 

Margaritas were good as well, I  prefer a little more taste of tequila to mine but at least they weren't filled with too much sweet and sour. 

We were continuously checked on by both the manager and the server. Which was refreshing. 

The music was low which I normally prefer but this time around I wish there was a live band to shut the woman sitting next to us up. She was on the phone ignoring her lunch date and being loud. Talking bad about other people. Everything else was amazing. People need to have more respect for others. 

The only downside other than miss chatty Cathy was that we finished our meal and margaritas before getting the check. I prefer to have the bill by the time I finish my food.

Next up, they offer meat or seafood substitutions that aren't listed on the menu. For example, my dinner plate came with a taco, the waiter offered fish or shrimp as a substitution but FAILED to mention there was an additional charge to choose fish or shrimp. 

This is not the only scam type move they do, they offer to get you more salsa and refried beans, again in that ""friendly"" tone, BUT if you pay attention to the menu, in SMALL print, it says refills for salsa and beans costs $4. They FAIL to inform their customers of such a charge.

It's not so much that we paid (were scammed) a few extra dollars, but it's more of the principle and genuine service factors.

The lady at the front did not even acknowledge me.  I complimented her flowery headband and told her that I was meeting some friends. She just pointed and said that they were sitting at the back.  So I proceeded towards where my friends we sitting.  The restaurant was okay.  It was large enough, but the seating area were just too close together.  David, the waiter was really nice.  He's the reason I gave this place a 1-star, otherwise, I would have given it 0.  He immediately took my order.  My ""limonada"" took awhile before I got it.  I was parched so I sipped that drink like there's no tomorrow.  Ii didn't get asked for a refill.  I only ordered 3 tacos, and it took forever to get to me.  Everyone at the table were done with their food at this time.  I was snacking on the chips, which by the way tasted really stale.  The busboy took the salsa I was dipping the chips in and when I told him I was still using it, he tried to put it back on our table, ahem, I don't think so.  His thumb was inside the bowl touching the salsa.  No way, Jose.  I asked if I can get a fresh bowl of salsa and lime.  He said that he will get it for me.  Still waiting for my tacos.  Still waiting for the salsa and lime.  Hmmm.  They must have forgotten me.  David handed me my bill and I haven't even received my food yet.  LOL!!!  45 freakin' minutes later, I finally get my tacos.  Still no salsa and lime.  I had to ask  again if they can bring me a fresh bowl of salsa and lime.  Nothing extraordinary about the tacos.  Tough meat, guac, small diced tomatoes and a few leaves of cilantro in a soft taco shell.  I only ate one and picked the other two.  3 tacos and a medium size drink....$16.  WTH!!!! I could have treated all my friends with that at Taco Bell.  Lol.  And as we were handed the bill, David informs us that tip was not included in the bill.  He said that normally the tip in included but they forgot to add it.  OMG!!! 
Overall, I will not be coming back.  There's a lot of Mexican restaurants in town that I can truly say is very authentic and delish and this place is definitely not one that I will come to again.  Try it for yourself.  Things could be better for you.  This is just my opinion",B2x3kEXXo8iUdtS9FhGO4A,0,0,1,ngLmiOZB8dpqvJs5vgxYJA

4484655,2016-02-23,8,h4Q-uSoOIhMoIsOhat6l3A,"I've passed by Casa Don Juan Summerlin a bunch of times, but just got to try it on for size tonight.  And it fit!!

There was no wait - we eat late, and were led to a very small booth right away.  If we had stayed there, the food would have had to sit on our laps.  But it was no problem to change to a table so that the food and my purse could be comfortable.

Our waiter, José B., was excellent.  He brought Herb a taste of the draft Modelo Especial, and before we ordered he brought him some of the mole sauce to taste, too, so he could see if it was too sweet, as it often is at other places.

We enjoyed the bean dip and salsa that came with the complimentary chips.  The dip was warm and the salsa just spicy enough.  The chips weren't the best I've ever had, but they were fine, and unsalted, the way I like them.

I had a decently priced glass of wine with a fairly generous pour, and Herb's $2.50 Modelo was a bargain.

I ordered the fajitas and was able to combine chicken and shrimp for $14.95.  I don't quite get why some of my fellow Yelpers find the prices outrageous here.  There aren't many Mexican restaurants that sell fajitas at this price, and they always charge more for shrimp. (There is a $2 upcharge for choosing the steak and shrimp combo).  Moreover, the amount of meat, especially the shrimp, was enormous.  It came with frijoles, rice and guacamole.  As usual, I forgot to ask for regular beans rather than refried.  I had expected just a thimbleful of guac, but the portion didn't seem that much smaller than the one ordered as an appetizer by some nearby tables.  In contrast to some other reviews, the fajitas arrived sizzling, the onions weren't overly caramelized or disproportionately overabundant, and the lettuce was fresh, too. I took home half of my dish, along with all the tortillas, rice and beans that I couldn't finish.

My husband's mole, so often thick and gloppy, was a much lighter version here, and red, rather than dark brown.  It's definitely not as rich, but that's a good thing.  There are many different kinds of mole, since each region in Mexico claims a different recipe as its own, and it was nice to see that it wasn't a copycat of every other place in town.

We sat in the Frida Kahló room, truly a shrine to that artist, but really, the whole place is a feast for the eyes.  Authentic Mexican decorations abound, and it made me yearn for the days when I'd visit that country sometimes twice a year after my three summers in school in Guadalajara.  I asked a busboy if I could steal one of the big Mexican people sculptures lined up on a pony wall; he said he wouldn't tell, but the camera trained on them would record it.  Oh, well, my purse wasn't big enough, and besides, they were bolted down.  I checked.  :)

We really enjoyed Casa Don Juan and look forward to returning.  My only complaint was that José couldn't tell me how to say ""draft [beer] in Spanish!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,10,8,4,im5tgTJM9QNeHJvD7IX3Vg

Coming from a San Diego born Mexican it's really hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas this place has a few good things but overall falls into my category of meh Mexican food! What saves them is great service our waiter was new and didn't know much but he's was kind and willing to find out for us. He also brought me some spicier salsa it was an habanero one that was barely spicy and didn't help much. The tortilla s are hand made so are very delicious. The rice and beans are edible which to me is surprising and The restaurant is cute the outdoor area is very spacious and shaded for nice afternoons. I've also had huevos rancheros at the downtown location and they were actually pretty good! Maybe since this was a different location they use a different sauce. I might be back to try their lunch or dinner but I'm not overly optimistic. Sometimes homemade is the only way to get what I want!,XIqU5ZETUxALemsHGPQOrg,0,0,3,Y-qaWVs7Qmd-i7j9TJdDIA

I'm not really sure why this place has 4 stars because the food was underwhelming. It wasn't bad, but not great, just meh. I tried the fajitas, both beef and chicken, both were okay but lacked that sizzling, authentic Mexican taste in the seasoning and smoky grilled flavor that accentuate the flavor of the meat. The sides of beans and rice were very small in proportion to the meat, and were lacking in flavor. Just when I thought the dishes could be somewhat salvaged by the salsa and guac', I was wrong, and both were bland as well. Service was almost non-existent. Our server wasn't as attentive as he should've been for a big party. If you don't really like your food seasoned or packing in flavor, then I guess this place might suit you, but then you wouldn't be able to call it authentic Mexican food.

We use to go here often since it's across the street from our house and we love Mexican food. We stopped going because they charged another parties dinner on our card and we noticed when we got home we had just paid $120 for two meals. We were given the run around all day trying to get the money reimbursed. They had a problem with it and it took up our whole day trying to get it resolved. Now, tonight I was craving a bean and cheese burrito with wet sauce and rice and beans on the side so I went and ordered that to go. When I got home, all I had was a wet bean and cheese burrito, no rice and beans. I was pretty upset since I just spent $14.05 for just a burrito and didn't get the full entree. My husband went back to the restaurant and they said that was correct, I had only ordered the ""wet bean and cheese burrito"". My husband said no, she spent $14.05 because it was suppose to be the entree. They proceeded to not agree and not fix the problem. My husband just said forget it and drove back home. That price is pretty outrageous for just a bean and cheese burrito with no meat but the main point is if the girl taking my order was actually paying attention, she would have heard that I wanted a wet burrito with rice and beans on the side. They don't care to make anything right with the customer when there's conflict. I work in customer service and if something is wrong, we do our best to fix it.

But tonight i came with a couple friends because we were craving a michelada. Our bartender Mayra seemed to not be too thrilled to have us in her section. She explained that they don't make micheladas without shrimp, which is odd,
Because I've ordered micheladas there without shrimp before... nonetheless, We ordered micheladas with pacíficos. She brought out our beers with salt and lime and no tomato juice/ Clamato... when i brought this to her attention, she had an attitude and brought us a small cup of Clamato for two ""micheladas"". At this point we were over the attitude and the disgusting drinks and left. Really enjoyed coming here because of Juan during lunch but probably won't be coming back again during dinner or for a quick drink any time soon.",l8vG8mpEEZo08lw4d8eBHQ,2,0,1,8tUZYoRpNUT7TKo6L-tHnA

I've popped in here a few times for happy hour (3-6pm) and have left happy each time because their Micheladas are some of the best I've had in the area. This is my go-to beer drink and I make them myself at home so I'd like to think I know my Micheladas. They have Bohemia beer which right away is a plus because a lot of Mexican/Spanish food restaurants don't have it for some strange reason. The mix they use is devine, it has the perfect taste and is only slightly spicy. They dress it with a Tajin rim and a skewer of lime, jalapeño, and a cocktail shrimp. I had chips and salsa along with a small bowl of dipping beans along with my drinks each time. The salsa is great too, not too much tomato sauce. But the beans were my favorite, I about licked that bowl clean.",IK3ESfOGnftvxFRoBXiLlw,0,0,5,nrXK1iroedVcsTESKqN23A

Warmly greeted at the door and seated quickly. Happy hour margarita available at 2 for $8.99 so ordered that plus a glass of water so we could peruse the extensive menu. Fresh chips with salsa and bean dip delivered to the table. Chips were not greasy at all as per other reviews. 

My friend went with the Super Burrito, with carne and pork. He managed to get through about 3/4 before declaring himself stuffed. I had the carne asada plate at $15.99, and it was so much food that I had to pack half to take home. I felt the prices were fair for what you got, which was good quality food. 

No complaints at all other than you can't get the bacon wrapped shrimp other than with the mega meal package. My friend used to go to a place near Encinitas just for these bacon wrapped shrimp and was excited to see them, but alas, we coudn't get them as an appetizer. Sad face.

Overall, quality food, plenty of it. Prices a bit high but not outrageous. Drink prices did look a bit spendy though, so go during happy hour. Nice, clean place, and very good service.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,4,4,4,dm8rQG46F_Ji1DNaoOMdUA

This location has a fabulous outside eating area, which was perfect to try out with the long waiting line.  The chips and salsa were fresh, however not the best I have ever had.  The margaritas were super!  The Cadillac was my fav of the day...:). The service wasn't bad, especially considering how busy they were on a Sunday afternoon no less!  The prices were a little high I thought considering the portion sizes and it was lunch time.  Really there wasn't much difference between the lunch and dinner prices.

Cost more than the beer!!  2 oz of ""cheese dip"" for $6.50!  It was basically cream cheese sour cream and a couple slices of jalapeño. Tasted like straight sour cream.

We ordered taquitos as the appetizer and half a dozen tamales for the entree.

Anyway, the food took awhile to come out and they brought the taquitos and the tamales out at the same time, so that was a bummer.
