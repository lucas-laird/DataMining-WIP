The poor man before me, requested a refund because he'd been waiting a LONG time, and about to miss his flight.  The cashier basically dissed him, and said his order would be ready shortly.

Well, now I knew my 15 minutes were going to take 20-30 minutes too!!!  I also asked for a refund and was told the same thing.  TEN MINUTES later, I got my order.

We walked into the dining area and neither waitress tried to make eye contact with us to tell us if we need to seat ourselves or wait so we caught another guests eye and asked them what they did and we sat ourselves. The waitresses looked absolutely miserable-as if they didn't want to be there or were so tired that even smiling was an issue. We sat at a table for 11 mins and finally there was one waitress that was walking by us and i flagged her down for her to tell me she just had to drop off a check and she will be back-she handed them the check and went to clean up another table and it seemed like she was there for at least 5 mins-at this point we got up and left and walked right past her but she didn't bother to apologize or ask us what's wrong.

We then go over to the on the fly and after we have our order i expresses my concerns about how miserable the waitresses look to Diana, the manager (who looks no happier to be there) and she proceeds to tell me they are having a bad day but she will talk to them- umm ok..fix the problem now!? Everyone was looking at each other side eyes because the service was horrible in the dining area.

The only competent person was the guy checking us out ahmedin, who looked happy to be there but also understood why we were so annoyed.

The woman he asked for the sauce told him to wait and then slowly walked to the back took 2 mins back there and slowly walked back and slowly put the sauce in the container and handed it to him-again, i wouldn't expect this from a David Burke restaurant-did he just get lazy and doesn't care about what they are doing to his reputation?

An airport is not the sort of place where one searches out fine dining.  In fact, it the sort of place where hungry travelers seek out average dining at stratospheric prices.  Such is the case at Burke in the Box at McCarran Int'l Airport in Las Vegas.

The good:

1)  The only place I could find on concourse D near my gate (53) which accommodated sit-down dining.
2)  Wide selection of hot dogs, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered a cheese burger with blue cheese, raw onions, lettuce and tomato.   The burger came with a generous helping of (what appeared to be) re-heated French fries with truffle oil.  I also had a 20oz Stella.
3)  Good selection of adult beverages
4)  Modest selection of dessert

The bad.
1)  OH MY GAWD: The bill.  $24 for a burger and a beer!!
2)  Understaffed.  The gentleman in the table next to me got up leaving his sandwich on the table to go the bar and order another drink.  While he was away the waitress cleared away his half-eaten sandwich.
3)  Pretense at fine dining.  The place is self serving trying to portray itself as haute burger-land: something which it is not.
4)  Televisions hanging on the wall with the volume up very high. 
5)  The waitress added bacon to my burger - which I didn't ask for and charged me $1.99 extra.

Overall:  I wish more airports were like Dulles Airport in Washington where the prices in there are pretty close to those you'd pay outside of the airport.  The food was decent but it was not fine dining: no way.

Were the burger, fries and beer had come in at $15 I'd be singing the praises of this high-rent burger joint.  At $24 - not so much.

In Vegas one has the opportunity to gamble at almost every turn.  Rest assured that if you venture into this establishment that you'll come up with snake eyes.",7iovp-aCS4pN7WbpFsP0Tg,1,0,2,Gdcimi7Ry9eqgr1Temmygg

To be honest, the reviews I read had me a bit worried but I know that each patron has their own experience and every business can have its ""off"" days.

Today was not one of those, really.  We were flying through on New Year's Day and I actually felt bad for our server...because she was the only server.  But I tell you what, she did a great job considering how full the restaurant was!  Her name was, I think, Kanesha.  

It's a seat-yourself establishment and they have these neat little transponders on the tables with 3 buttons:  request service, request check, or cancel request.  We pushed the request service button quite a few times, not actually sure if was working or not because no one was coming to our table.  But after we observed this nice lady run all over the place, we realized she was the only server working.

She came to our table and took our orders right away.  Given the stress she  had to be under, she was extremely pleasant and very efficient!  Our drinks came out very fast as did our food!  Which was a real surprise.  We probably sat down, ordered, and received our food in 30 minutes or less.

If I could give this restaurant a rating based on the service we received by Kanesha, it would have 5 stars!  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre.  I ordered the smoked turkey panini sans bacon, my mom and her husband ordered the margherita pizza and Caesar salad to split.  To be honest, I liked their pizza better than my sandwich.  I did not try their salad, however.  The best part of my sandwich was the panini - it was actually pretty delicious.  

I've been a traveler all my life (since I was in diapers) so I've grown to learn that airport food is not always the best...especially considering they charge you an arm and a leg for the food.

I am slowly but surely working my way up to this goal with much planning.  So imagine my surprise -- nay, sheer delight -- when I espied in McCarran Airport Terminal D, David Burke's ""Burke in the Box.""  Whaaa?  Since it was 10:20 in the morning, I was nursing a hang- and gambling-over, and we had almost two hours to kill before our flight, I thought breakfast here (at a Top Chef-touched eatery in the *airport*!!) would really scratch a lot of itches.  All it did was irritate.

After drooling over the breakfast menu (I couldn't *wait* to sink my teeth into a pretzel bread eggwhite sammie with tomato, 'shrooms, and feta), the server informed us breakfast was over at 10 and we were now on the lunch menu.  I'm sorry, breakfast ends at TEN did you say??  I get that this is Vegas and time doesn't really exist/count here, but on what planet -- besides high schools -- do people eat lunch at 10:05?  So I ended up ordering a *ten dollar* tuna sandwich and husband ended up ordering a Caesar salad.

Wow, David Burke.  Just...wow.  Salad was romaine, cuke, tomato, Asiago (completely unconventional ingredients in a Caesar) and KEN'S DRESSING IN A BAGGIE.  So boring husband kept dozing off in the *plastic bowl* it came in and nearly poking himself in the eye with the *plastic cutlery*.  My sandwich was fine -- the tuna salad itself was actually quite good, with all white meat albacore, capers, celery, onion, and a touch of mayo -- but the rye bread was really thick and really dry so I ended up just eating the salad off of it.  The fries it came with were crispy and golden but didn't have a ton of flavor, and the *tissue thin paper napkin* couldn't keep up with my greasy fingers.  I overheard another waitress telling a different table that for $1 extra they could add Asiago and truffle oil to their fries.  Gimme a break, Burke.  Truffle oil fries and Ken's baggie dressing on the same menu?  Make up your mind.

Service was actually pretty good, especially since it was our server's second day.  He was on top of the ball and we never had to wait long for anything.  He even swooped in with a drink refill before I had the chance to open my big mouth.

There was only one real waitress for the entire place, and I assume only one cook in the kitchen.  They were swamped.  Luckily, we arrived at the airport early or we'd have been in danger of missing our flight...because it took a very long time for things to come out of the kitchen.  It wasn't the waitress's fault, though, and we still tipped her over 20%.  I know what that's like, and it's not fun.

The notice on the menu said that all burgers came out well-done.  That's fine with me, as I prefer backyard burgers to gourmet ones.  However, what used to be 8oz was dry as a bone and super lightweight.  They must have pressed hard on the patty while it was on the grill repeatedly, and then took it way past well done.  The potato kaiser roll that it was on was partly dry as well.

The boy ordered the proscuitto and arugula pizza.  It was a thin crust pizza, so I thought at first that it was expensive for something that was going to be not very filling.  Well, it turned out to have half an inch of melted cheese on the thing that solidified into one huge block.  It was very heavy and filling, although if you took off half the cheese, the tomato sauce they used, combined with the proscuitto and peppery arugula was quite good.

White Chicken and Mushroom Chili soup had good flavor - could've use a bit more mushrooms.

The dish advertises chipotle mayo as one of the ingredients - there was a little package of standard mayo on a side - and even if there was something inside the sandwich, it was impossible to taste. If you mention ingredient in the menu, it is better be present...

First things first, everything is pricey, but I guess that's expected in an airport in Vegas?  I paid 16 bucks for a preztel panini and an Arizona Arnold Palmer.  The pretzel panini was chicken breast, bacon, tomato, provolone and a dijon mustard sauce on a pretzel roll.  It was pretty underwhelming.  Upon first bite I noticed that it was lacking flavor.  None of the elements in the sandwich stood out.  Could have used more sauce or some sort of seasoning.  I was tempted on smearing on a packet of yellow mustard, but decided against it.  On the other hand I did like the pretzel roll that the sandwich was served on.  The only real saving grace of this meal was the french fries.  They were thick cut, skin on, nicely fried and pretty tasty.

I would be willing to try the burgers, but seeing that it's in an airport in Vegas and I'm in Chicago it might be a while before I'm presented with that opportunity.",k6yIWgBW-up28RBEzkreCQ,0,0,2,UadqSEmC4c5uhqVZp-QC3w

Who on this planet would ever describe a Cobb Salad as great...even if it's the best Cobb on the face of earth???? I declare both Theresa G and Rol T be banned from posting reviews on Yelp.

Speaking of which, David Burke, whoever he is, I'm sure would be mortified beyond embarrassment with the quality of food being served here. He wouldn't be caught dead eating it. In fact, he may possibly die after eating here....the food quality is THAT BAD. I'm surprised I'm able to even write this review. I should be dead after eating here.

As we all know , you cannot give a zero Yelp rating.

We were greeted by bartender John.  This guy is a trip.  He will talk to you about anything.  Make sure to ask him about domesticating saber tooth tigers.  We start off with drinks and take a look at the menu.

They have a good selection of food items.  Yes it is expensive, but you are in an airport in Vegas.  In fact you will  pay Disneyland prices at any airport, so it's expected.  I went with the sliders that came with fries.

The portions are generous.  The slider were very good and the bun was lightly toasted and the meat medium rare.  The menu is a bit deceiving about the truffle fries.  You won't get them with your side order of fries unless you ask for it, then there is a surcharge.

It took about five minutes before we were given the chance to ask for cups before the server returned with two cups filled with tap water. Good to know it's really not self serving water unless you want to purchase it. Is that supposed to be an attempt at being classy?? Well we ordered appetizer and when the food got to the table, we had the cheese (asiago and truffle oil) fries, we were then asked if we wanted silverware. Well... maybe that would be a good idea... at least our own plates by now??? Drinks are pricy and not worth it with it's lackluster selection... overall fries were steak fries cut and pretty... neutral. Bland more so.

Soup came out first, as expected, but considering its clearly an entree I'd expect it to come out relatively the same time as my boyfriends food. Common sense? Doesn't take a long time to prepare soup... Oh, but it's okay because our server told us a burger cooks longer... obviously. You mean the same burger you didn't ask what temperature he'd like his patty cooked to?? I took one sip and... I understand soup is composed of various spices and purée or stock or what have you but... this tasted purely of sugar... I couldn't even muster the will to get through another bite. The perks of her bringing my soup to me early though I guess. So then, my boyfriend gets his ULTIMATE BURGER, where the only modifications he made was no tomato, add bacon and blue cheese cheese option, and it comes out as a dry and pathetic display of... a lettuce patty bun bacon and blue cheese slob. Um... are there any spices on the patty? Looks very plain considering it's names ultimate. After our server dropped it off I asked for another soup. You can't force me to eat synthetically sweetened tomato slosh. It was pink, so there might have been more cream than base... Thankfully she took it away from my sights and I requested for a different soup. The beef chili!!! Who can mess up a chili??? Oh yes, Burke in the Box can!


My boyfriend could not finish his food. This place that CLAIMS to ""blaze across distinctions between chef, artist, entrepreneur, and artist"" could not make a simple ""sandwich"", their ""ultimate burger"" look appealing to a starving homeless person, let alone the prices would scare anyone away who does not want to throw away their money after surviving in Vegas. Seriously, gamble your money at the slot machines before gambling with their quality here!!! And even so... go to some place without ""in the Box"" in their name. Jack is wayyy more appealing. Is it foreshadowing that if you eat there you'll have enough food to put in an entire to go Box to only throw it away? Oh... no one gets to go boxes because they never want to see this puke-inducing food again. No one will ever be drunk enough to enjoy anything from this experience.

So, chili was a fail, I only ate the crackers they gave me that I sprinkled onto the soup for flavoring. Added salt... didn't help. Pretty damn bland. I completely abandoned the hopes of finding anything that should be SOOOOOO simple to make as anything decent to consume there. The crackers were nice since there was no connection in the making with an ""in the box"" company. And as hungry as my boyfriend was he could only eat 2/3rds of his burger, in which he claims that the ONLY flavor from the burger was the blue cheese.

Barely saw my server. Since food was so terrible I can only assume all the back of house was smart and left, so the front of house had to make the food. Actually, this place should be shut down and seriously bring in a Mexican restaurant. Any will do because all the food options were probably as bad as Burke in the Box. And as young as we are I don't think my boyfriends recent heartburn is anything else but this food related. So... fooders beware of Burke in the Box... it's really bad.",MclaDy871lm4GPlQcpTCiQ,0,0,1,gCQ8IcWHz9Zqa9EvwBrk_w

I ordered a split bottle of Prosecco and their margarita pizza. I enjoyed my wine and pizza. It was light and thin crusted. I ordered mine with extra basil. The only negative that I had before ordering the pizza, is that I couldn't get any fresh Parmesan cheese. They only offered peppers.

Now this is not fine dining by any means - this is a sit in restaurant. If you are trying to make a close connection, I would advise you not order here because they do take time in preparing the food. Definitely not fast. They do have a station where you can buy food to go. I don't know if I try this place again.

The ""double"" drinks were still pretty weak (seemed like I was just drinking a $12 single), and the pizza was the absolute worst one I've ever had.  Wouldn't be surprised to find they were frozen ones being microwaved in the next room.  I ordered the prosciutto and arugula one.  It ended up being a flat tasteless (frozen looking) cheese pizza with a pile of ""toppings"" thrown on top on the middle. Not cooked onto the pizza -- cold on top.  The prosciutto tasted like it had gone bad, so I ended up just pushing it off the piece I ate.  

Service was really poor, too.  I was sitting at the bar, and it took over 10 minutes to get the bartender to take my drink order.  He waited on literally everyone else who arrived after me, while avoiding making eye contact.  Finally, he acknowledged me by saying ""did you need something?""

I get it if I got my order to go, give me my dressing on the side. If I'm dining in, and paying $14.82, my salad better be mixed with the dressing with croutons. Nope, for $14.82, you get no croutons with 2 packets dressing that you can get at your local gas station for 50 cents a piece. Nope, you are better off buying a bag of salad kits from Dole.
