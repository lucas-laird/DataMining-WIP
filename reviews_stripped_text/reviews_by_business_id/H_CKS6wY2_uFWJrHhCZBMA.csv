314646,2015-12-28,0,H_CKS6wY2_uFWJrHhCZBMA,"Found this place on Yelp! and saw the great reviews; however, the chicken tenders were quite disappointing. The only reason I would say that is because the texture of the chicken itself is off. I felt like I was eating fried fish because the meat just dissolves in your mouth which is quite odd for chicken. The batter was light and fluffy which I enjoyed. The sweet potato fries were a mixture of undercooked and overcooked fries. The only solid thing was French fries and soda. I probably will not return, sorry!",IgcTFv2ujhHZflWJgVXR5A,0,0,3,weg-JZFfJl2y0UUzrSWEdQ

They are fresh tenders, moist and delicious, and the batter is to die for, twice the size of any others I've tried and prepared fresh to order. Their House Secret Sauce is amazing. It goes well with the tenders and their fresh cut fries too.
As I was staying at the Luxor Hotel, I went to the food court and I was immediately attracted to the rotating sign over the store. I love the roadside feeling of this place. Original vintage hub caps are part of the decor of the front counter, I even like the formed tin they are attached to, even the counter help wears uniforms that resemble mechanics of long ago. They offer great sides like mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and their okra nuggets are cooked to order. What steals the show talking about their sides, are the fresh cut fries. They serve them with every entree, they even have a jumbo serving of them that easily satisfied the four of us. We ordered both the sandwiches and the tenders and we were given a pager as we waited for the orders to be prepared. That was a real upscale touch with the pagers. About 8 minutes later our pager went off, and went to pick up the order everything looked amazing. The food is placed in heavy paper boats lined with paper, none of that foam stuff that other places offer. I asked for an extra cup for us to share our milkshakes, and guess what? It is hearth friendly compostable clear cup! Wow!
I love this place. I understand they have an other location at the Monte Carlo Hotel, but I have not been to that one. Certainly a place I want to visit for great tenders that won't break the bank. I will let the casinos do that.",9wIbXqBLqYQa-Dgfkj5NVA,2,3,5,-Ms1S7_LE0qaLMQocI82Pw

We really enjoyed these freshly fried, lightly breaded tender chicken strips. We watched the guy freshly breaking them and putting them in the fryer as ppl ordered. The sauce they came with was decent and they also have ranch and bbq if you ask. The fries seemed fresh as well.

Whether you're looking for a quick bite, or something to soak up all the alcohol you had earlier the Original Chicken Tender is a great option! I ordered the combo which was a 3 piece with fries and was pleased with my meal.  It wasn't too heavy, not that much grease, and the sauce that comes with it is what makes the experience great.  I don't recall what sauce it was exactly kind of reminded me of a ketchup and mayo mix but with something else too.

I was thrilled to find what I at first thought was a Dairy Queen. Wrong resort.... that would have been at the Excalibur or one resort over from Luxor.

I really enjoyed the crispy and delicious the chicken tenders were. And how large, hot, and non greasy they were.

Since I was on vacation I did not quibble about prices that were slightly above average.... but this was a food court. Just having the option to order and enjoy fried okra what I special treat. 

I would have been satisfied with the regular dipping sauce, but order their gravy at an extra cost. it was the only thing that had a processed taste... but I still ate some of it.

I did use my coupon from Luxor for a free soda pop, with unlimited refills.

the total bill was about $13.00, but this was for a lot of food, looking at a food court. and don't let the word food court fool you. This one was massive and clean and food courts are where most people in Las Vegas high end LUXURY resorts can eat at anyway.

I bit into a piece of white meat delicious-ness that was perfectly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside and was so fresh, it was about to burn my tongue out of my mouth. Yes, I did discover that this ""fast food"" joint FRESHLY makes their chicken. I witnessed the cook pulling out the chicken tenders to flour them in breadcrumbs and then deep fried them. It took a little longer than your standard Mcdonald's fast food speed, but 12 minutes is worth it. Shoot, I can't even start on how their house sauce that comes with their chicken tenders makes me want to have all chicken tenders in the world have a mandatory marriage to that sauce. 

I believe 2 chicken tenders are about 5 bucks, just get one of the combo meals. You can upgrade the side to sweet potato fries for a buck more if you wanted.

There were several options of course. Pizza, hotdogs, subs, and burgers. Being a sucker for chicken tenders I had made up my mind. I ordered the meal that came with 3 tenders and accompanied with a cup of french fries. 

There was a short wait but all for good reason. Their tenders are made fresh. They are battered and fried shortly after you place your order. None of that frozen shit.

I ordered the 3 piece meal, which comes with fries for $8. Swapping out fries for mashed potatoes cost an extra $1.  I added a big biscuit for $1.50. Yeah Chris Rock said it... Big A$$ Biscuit!!! We up to $11.50 for 3 Chicken Tenders, mashed potatoes, biscuit and tax. 

Biscuit - MC Gusto ain't got nothing on Denise Austin, because these biscuits were hard a$$... Buns of Steel! I bit in and thought my tooth broke off. Hard on the inside, hard on the outside, like my arteries.  Yea, I got jokes today. So sad, because I was so drooling when the guy brought out the paint brush and started basting the biscuit with a little butter before wrapping it up. I didn't eat another bite, I threw it away. And they didn't give me butter or honey.

Chicken Tenders - The tenders are pretty good. I don't know if they are $4.95 for two pieces good (while in Vegas, you pay Strip prices), but they were good. Definitely $4.95 for three pieces good. One problem is that the breading was already falling off before I even tried to pick one up. It's light and crispy, but the falling off thing is an issue. The original thousand island based sauce (it's like a chipotle thousand island dip) is money, while the bbq sauce is not.  

Mashed Potatoes - If you're charging me an extra $1 for mashed potatoes over fries and you forget to put gravy on the potatoes or on the side, I am gonna be pissed. I didn't find out until I got back to my room and I wasn't about to walk another 500 steps back for them to fix it.  

Maybe things sucked because I ordered after 10 p.m. (they are open until midnight every night, so no excuses!). At these prices, they need to get things right.

Yes, I did send her back up there for more Pepsi. I thought maybe they were having sympathy on the kid but would turn me down.lol

After a week of disappointing crusine that cost an arm and a leg (and this from a New Yorker), it was refreshing to find a place where you get what you paid for. The tenders were nice and crispy but in terms of flavor kindof bland compared to Popeye's chicken. You definitely need sauce with these. The place looked clean and the staff is helpful. Good place after a long day and a week of paying for expensive food that isn't worth it",oeccoAoBtpGHkCxRBA23EA,0,0,4,It15y89-Sufc63_RGQitxQ
